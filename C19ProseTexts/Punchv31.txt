T)EACE—dove-eyed, rosc-lipped Peace—under the mistletoe!
- Peace, in her sweet simplicity, believed that she had taken hands, and given her own hand to the
lips of high contracting parties, some time last spring: in Paris spring-time, when the Boulevards are
fragrant with violets, and the chesnuts have all but ceased to smoke and crackle. But, somehow, Peace
—being a woman—has ever been the dupe of deep protestations and frothy vows; and so—and so—it has
again happened; and a Mighty Emperor, whose crown is almost among the stars, and whose waving sceptre
hushes into obsequiousness sixty millions of souls (and a few handfulls over,) has disputed with the Lady
Peace in a higgling, haggling spirit, even as Ben Manasses, the old clothesman, would higgle and haggle
with Mary, the housemaid, in exchange for current coin of a perquisite hare-skin. Not very chivalrous
this in a sublime Autocrat, topped with a star-reaching crown, and endowed with a soul-hushing sceptre;
but so it is, and it is for mere millions of mortals to take autocrats as they find them, even as the sheep
took pastor Polyphemus.
And so, ere the year runs out, Peace is again and finally to be saluted in Paris; and Ma. Punch
takes the genial opportunity presented by the completion of his Thirty-First Volume, to utter a few
words of counsel to the contracting parties again about to press with their lips the hand of Peace; and
most especially to that Party whose tricksiness has made the necessity—a necessity, it may be, a little
too readily granted—of the solemnity.
w Mr. Punch has given orders for a certain number of this his Thirty-First Volume to be superbly and
significantly bound, and forwarded to Lord Cowley, the hospitable English Ambassador at the Court of
France, that His Excellency may, on the consummation of the ceremony, hand over to the representative
of either saluting party, the rewarding tome, in token of the event, and in communion of good faith to be
kept and cultivated.
Mr. Punch foreshadows, with a movement of his pen, the ceremony as, of course, it will be performed.

ir PREFACE. "S^" [December 27, 1856. «■ -. i v.
The Lady Peace clothed in white, and garlanded with olive, stands under the mistletoe; type of
English Christmas. In her girdle she carries the Red-Rose, the Violet, the Citron blossom, and the
Tulip—England, France, Sardinia, and Turkey—tied in a silvery string.
Alexander Romanoff will first advance to the Lady Peace. He tries to smile, but winces a
little as he looks in her sweet gracious face; and to the thoughtful observer, it may appear as though His
Majesty trod upon particles of glass, strangely enough conveyed into the Imperial boots. His Majesty will
then take the hand of the Lady Peace, and resolutely determining to gulp the salute, will bend his head,
and, haply biting his nether lip, and the Imperial moustachios twisting like little snakes just new from the
egg on some Isle of Serpents, the Emperor of all the Russias will inflict the salute. And the salute
given, let us hope that what Peace has received as a kiss, may not be developed as a frost-bite.
Victoria of England, in her own frank, hearty way, will next salute the Lady Peace, kissing her
like a beloved and loving sister.
Louis Napoleon of the French, with a face unbending, "like a Dutchman's over a bed of tulips,"
kisses the hand of the Lady Peace, and stepping backward places his hand in his pocket, in which is a little
hole—as though the smallest of shot had passed through it—made by the war.
Victor Emmanuel, like one of Tasso's paladins, approaches the Lady Peace, and gracefully
manipulating the moustachios that have springed so many hearts, impresses his lips upon the benignant hand;
though, it may be seen, with a wish lurking in his eye, that the ceremony had been, for at least another
campaign, deferred,
Abdul Medjid, 6miling as at his own condescension, salutes the Lady Peace, looking at her in no
way with the looks of a sick man.
Francis Joseph, his tongue a little protruding the cheek next to Russia, kisses Peace with military rigour.
Frederick William salutes Peace with a sounding smack; and the Lady might say—but does not—
as was said to Jenny Diver on a different liquid on a different ceremony—" One can tell by your kiss that
your champagne is excellent/'
And Peace being saluted, the Volume of Mr. Punch is distributed, and with it hearty wishes to
all men of
% Mml tffetwte anir k Jpapg |to fear.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ONDAY, June 23ri. Lord
Lyxduurst moved the se-
cond reading of the BUI for
admitting the Jew to Par-
liament. Lord Stanhope,
better known as Lord
Mahon, the historian, op-
posed it, seeing, he said, a
great difference between
allowing people to admin-
ister laws, (as Jew Lord
Mayors. Jew Sheriffs, Jew
Sheriffs officers, and Jew
churchwardens do), and to
frame laws. He was also
afraid that if Jews got into
Parliament, unrestrained by
the oath of abjuration, they
would begin to denounce the
Christian religion, and to
blaspheme its mysteries.
This cogent argument
seemed to have much weight
with the Lords, and after a
few more speeches, they
decided by 110 to 78—ma-
jority 32—that they would
not give Bason Rothschild the chance of flinging a New Testament
at the Speaker's head, and delivering a ribald speech in derision of the
Twelve Apostles. Where these Lords live and among whom, is one
question, and another is, in what estimation do they hold the assembly
of Gentlemen who assist them in legislation?
In the Commons, Ms. Walpolk's motion for an address to unsettle
Irish Edncition was of course rescinded, but he and the other Conser-
vative leaders, not liking to be beaten, actually coalesced with the sup-
Witers of the counter-motion, whioh was expressly intended to upset
alpole's work. They pretended to see in its terms (which were
certainly weak and awkward enough) nothing adverse to their own
views. This mockery (vehemently denounced by the Herald and
Standard) did not satisfy the earnest ultra-Protestants, and they

behaved in a manly way, and divided on the real question. We are
sorry to say that there are 95 of them. By the way, Mr. Punch, as a
friend of Her Majesty, protests against the system of sending one
sort of message to her on a Tuesday, and then on the Monday and before
she can answer it, bawling after her, "Hi! m'm, hi! That wasn't
what we meant—this is it." Mr. Punch conceives such conduct to be
extremely American. The House adjourned after Ms. Bomb a Bowter
had expressed the anger of his royal and priestly clients at the support
which England is giving to Sardinia.
Tuesday. The Joint Stock Companies' Bill went through Committee
in the Lords, obitante Stjpeblapide, and then a Bill for knocking a nail
through the head of 120 Sleeping Statutes, and fastening down those
Siseras for ever, was read a second time. Lord Derbt then played
his adroit counter-card against the Jew Bill. The abjuration oath,
which shuts out the Jews, contains a declaration against descendants
of the Pretender, and is therefore absurd and profane, there being no
such people. Lord Derby brings in a Bill to strike out the reference
to these descendants, and having thus purified the oath from absurdity,
leaves in the words excluding the Jew. To-night he carried his second
reading, and on Friday took the measure through Committee. Lord
Lyndhcbst described it as a Sham, and Lord Campbell as a Botch.
It will probably pass the Lords, and the Commons will strike out the
excluding words—and then the Lords will re-insert them, and to on,
until the farce is over.
Great fun at the Commons' morning sitting. The Nabob of Surat
Bill came on for third reading, and the two heads of the ridiculous
double Government of India, Hogg, the Company's Chairman, and
Smith, of the Board of Control, abused one another soundly; Poscua
declaring that he had been deceived, aud would never depend again
upon anything so "slippery" as Government, who had promised to
help the Company to cheat the Nabob, and were afraid to do so; and
Fabes retorting that the difficulty arose from the "slippery" Court of
Directors, and rebuking the other for his habitual arrogance in talking
as if he, Hogg, were the Indian Government. When officials fall out,
Nabobs get their own, and the third reading of the Bill was carried by
a tremendous majority, 213 voting for Meeb Jatfieb, and only twenty-
eight going into the pigsty. let the Commons did not think that
one good act in a day was enough—so in the evening they counted
out.

[Jolt 5, 1856.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Wednesday. Spooner defeated an amendment intended to throw out
his Anti-Maynooth Bill by 174 to 168—majority 6—and then Henry
Herbert talked nonsense against time until a quarter to six, to pre-
vent the second reading from being carried that day. Next night,
Sfooner declared that he was Victor in the Maynooth fray, but that
as such practises were resorted to, he should withdraw his Bill till next
session, and be advised the friends of the College to consider some
plan for settling the question, for, he Swore (" if it should please God
to preserve his life ") on the first day of next session, he would give
them notice of a new Bill. So the poor Catholic students will have
food to eat and beds to sleep in until February, 1857, at all events.
Thursday. The Divorce Bill came to the Lords frcm their Select Com-
mitt ee, and Lord Lyndhurst most ably explained its present character.
What is proposed is this. A new Tribunal for deciding upon matri-
monial causes. That a divorced woman who acquires property shall
have it for herself. That she may sue, in ac'ions, as a single woman.
That a wife thall be placed' somewhat [more upon a footing with a
husband, as regards the obtaining divorce; that in all cases of a
husband's infidelity (accompanied with cruelty), in certain still worse
cases, and in those of bigamy, a woman dial I be entitled to ask divorce.
Lord Lyndhurst—ever "a woman's man," hut now so in the noblest
sense of the word—added, that he had endeavoured to get the Com-
mittee to assent to abolish the scandalous and unfair "action for
damages," and to substitute prosecution; and he instanced a remaik-
able case, in which the present system inflicted the most cruel and
wicked wrong upon an innocent lady, who was permitted to give no
evidence in a cause whose result was to brand her with infamy. But
the Committee were not prepared to go so far. They, however, added
a little boon, namely, that a wife who has been deserted for two years,
instead of four, should be entitled to alimony. Lord Lansdowne gave
eloquent support to the Bill. The Lord Chancellor, Keeper of the
Royal Conscience, defended the refusal to give more equality, on the
ground that "unquestionably the public regarded a husband s errors
as less criminal than a wife's, that it was not unreasonable to expect a
wife to pardon a husband's infidelity, but that the reverse wa« not. to be
expected. The cases could not be considered as equal." Lord Campbell
supported the Bill. The Bishop op Oxpord {Mr. Punch does not mis-
represent him, for the Church's stalwart friend, the Standard., manifests
indignant surprise at his Lordship's speed)) objected to the proposed in-
creased facility of divorce. He thought it ought to be confined to persons
who could pay £2000. "The lower classes did not demand theprivilegia
afforded to the higher and wealthier clasess." The Bishop op St.
David's thought with Dr. Wilberporcb. Lord Campbell, in reply,
cited Mr. Justice Maule's scorching irony, when a poor man, whose
wife had robbed him, and absconded, had sought to provide his children
with a mother, and had committed bigamy. Judge Maule's speech
concentrates so much of the poor man's case, that Mr. Punch must
quote it. "You have acted wrongly. You ought to have brought an
action for criminal conversation; that action would have been tried
before one of Her Majesty's judges at the assizes; you would probably
have recovered damages; and then you should have instituted a suit in
the Ecclesiastical Court for a divorce a mensd et thoro. Having got
that divorce, you should have petitioned the lime of Lords tor a
divorce a vinculo, and should have appeared by counsel at the bar of
t heir Lordships' house. Then, if the Bill passed, it would have gone
down to the House of Commons: the same evidence would possibly be
repeated there: and if the Royal assent had been given, after that you
might have married again. The whole proceeding would not have
cost you more than £1,000." "Ah, my lord," replied the man, I
never was worth more than 1,000 pence in all my life." The judge's
answer was, "That is the law, and you must submit to it. The
Bishop of Oxford contrived to carry a postponement of the next stage
of the Bill, which he means to "amend. Let the Lords protect the
Women of England against the Priests.
In the Commons Mr. Wilson stated, tha* at last there is to be a
regular Australian Mail. Once more, the Aide■ men triumph, and Sir
Geoki.b Grey withdraws the Bill for reforming the London Corpo-
ration! The Solicitor-General procured the second reading of his
Bill for taking away Wills and Administrations from the Ecclesiastical
Courts, a reform which may possibly be carried. The Cambridge
University Reform Bill was passed, and several new tunes will be
played on the Aruniiues Cami.
Friday. The gallant Admiral, Sir Agamemnon Lyons (immorta-
lised by Mr. Punch in a cartoon which is considered the great glory of
the family), took his seat as Lord Lyons, of Christcburch, as may be
seen in the initial of this article. He was introduced by Lord Byron,
who whispered a quotation from his own Don Juan.
the Prince U all for toe land-service,
In the Commons, Clay threw over his Church Rates Abolition Bill,
and the night was occupied in discussing where our National Gallery
is to be. The Bill for turning Mr. Wilkins's place into an Hotel baa
been got rid of, and the question is, whether the pictures shall stay
where they are—go to Kensington Gore—or be placed in Kensington
Palace? The Court is understood to favour the second plan, but upon
this occasion a motion by Lord Elcho for a commission for further
inquiry into the subject was carried by 153 to 145, the Court and the
Government being both beaten, despite of support from Mr. Disraeli.
The House turns restive. Coi»rxosBY harangues,
The Court's defeated, and Sib Eastlake bangs.*

THE LOVES OF THE BALLET.
We should he glad
to learn from the
Family Herald or
some other equally
high authority on
matters of Love,
Courtship, and Matri-
mony," what ought
to be the conduct
of Marie Taglioni,
when she receives the
sort of attentions that
are offered to her by
Monsieur Charles
on the stage of Her
Majesty's Theatre in
a little divertissement
called La Bouquetiere.
The gentleman makes
his advances to the
lady by leaping to-
wards her, and flou-
rishing his toes in her
fac:; so that instead
of throwing himself
at her feet, he may
be said to throw his
feet at her in the
most extraordinary
manner. It is per-
fectly true that a
lover may he thought
to have a full appreciation of his mistress when be is prepared to literally "jump at her;"
but, she might, peihaps, be as well pleased with his advances if they were not made in a series
of leaps that threaten to make at least a3 much impression on her toes as on her heart, and

which prove, by his springing up and down like
an Indian-rubber ball, that his affection is not of
a boundless character. If Henry, in every-day
life, were to pay his addresses to Maria by
springing after her like a spread-eagle, there can
be no doubt that if Maria's friends did not
interfere, the police would soon be on the heels
of Henry. It seems, however, that a lover in a
ballet may make himself agreeable by means that
would place him in Bedlam, were he to practise
in the world the same captivating tricks that
induce a premiere danseuse to throw herself into
his arms, and to abandon one half of her under-
standing by causing ber to place herself on one
leg, while resting on him for support, and repay-
ing him with a smile rendered more valuable by
the painful nature of the attitude into which she
has twisted herself.
Comparative Petticoats.
The Cardinal at Paris had, at the ceremony of
the Imperial Baptism, no less than "Seventeen
Breadths in the skirts of his dress." The Holy
Father is not content in following the female
fashions, but is determined actually to take the
lead in petticoats. Surely a lady may be excused
indulging in ten, twelve, or fourteen breadths
in her dress, when we see a man blow himself out
with seventeenP Such an enormous "tuck-in"
as the latter does honour to the well-known
voracity of the Romish Church, and these seven-
teen breadths are worthy to rank amongst the
foremost of Papal Indulgences. We suppose,
every Cardinal is allowed the Indulgence of cut-
ting his petticoat according to his cloth?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GREECE IN WANT OF THE GALLOWS.
itu the last Mail we have
accounts from Athens,
that Highwaymen—in
so far as there are high-
ways — are becoming
very numerous and
troublesome in the
ridiculous kingdom of
Greece. According to
the report of two pri-
soners, whom some of
these rascals had cap-
tured, and released on
the payment of ran-
som:—
"The brigands had fx-
pressed to them much dis-
appointment because hi-
therto they hftd not suc-
ceeded in capturing any
English or French officers."
It is almost desirable
that the disappoint-
ment of these scoun-
drels should cease, and
that they should have
their wish — that of
capturing some Eng-
lish aud French offi-
cers; and this, indeed,
would be quite desi-
rable, but for the cer-
tainty that the mis-
creants would inflict the most atrocious outrages upon any who should be so unfortunate as
to fall into their hands. The capture of one English and one I rench officer would, no doubt,
induce a combination of French and English energy that would eventuate in leaving not one
villain of them unhanged, except those who might have the better luck to be bayoneted or
shot down. In catching a French officer or an English, whether the officer were a Crimean
or not, these blackguards would very soon flud that they bad caught a lartar.

A CARD FOR AMERICAN COURTIERS.
Messbs. Noses and Son have much pleasure
in informing gents, and others connected with
the Ameiican legation, that an outfit for attend-
ance at the Court of Queen Vic torn a may now
be had for twenty-five shillings. The suit con-
sists of a good stout shooting-coat, with pockets
for the hands to avoid the expense of gloves, a
pair of coarse "pan's," and h'gblows warranted
to trample upon all the forms of decency. Wrap-
rascals for Birthday Drawiog-rooms made to

calculated to insult the British Court to be had

An Apology for the Police.

Flirtation.—A poetical young Midshipman,
being called upon to describe Flirtation, com-
pared it to hugging the shore of the United
LOGIC IN THE HOUSE OF LOEDS.
Is it possible to conceive any human creature, except an uncommonly
irrational woman, holding such an argument as the following, ascribed",
in a parliamentary report of the Lords' debate on the Jew Bill, to Earl
Stanhope?
"It waa also held that a man who had not an income of £300 a-year waa disqualified
from sitting in the House of Commons. Why, then, should there not be disqualifi-
cation on religious grounds f"
A writer of some reputation for sagacity advises us to answer, and
also not to answer, a fool according to his folly. In the exercise of the
discretion allowed by this counsel, we will venture to reply to the
question of the blockhead whose words we presume to have been put
into the month of Earl Stanhopb.
As a man is disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons on
the ground of his not having an income of £300 a-year, why, then,
should there not be disqualification from sitting there on religious
grounds? Simply because the want of £300 a-year, or thereabouts, is
a pretty good reason why a man should be excluded from the House of
Commons, and his religious opinions are a very bad reason. Unless
he has an income of his own, he must depend upon other people for a
subsistence, and it is highly probable that those other people who keep
him will, on many questions of practical importance, influence his vote
to the public detriment. But it is highly improbable that his religious
opinions will exert t he least influence, detrimental to the public, on his
vote, upon any question of practical importance. All the mischief that
religious opinions can do m the House of Commons is already done by
those of the Roman Caiholic members, whose politics are subservient
to their Popery. That mischief is not much, or the Emancipation Act
would very soon get repealed. To ask why, if a man is excluded from
the House of Commons for not having £300 a-year, he should not also
be excluded on religious grounds, is like asking why, because poverty
disqualifies from memben-hip of Parliament, red hair should not con-
stitute the same disqualification?
"We hope the above explanatory remarks will meet the eye of the
foolish peer whom the reporter mistook for Earl Stanhope, and will
prove in some degree intell'gible to that noble simpleton; at the same
time we feel that an apology is dne to the youngest of our junior
readers, indeed to our mere spellers, for insulting their understanding
by the refutation of nonsense too imbecile to be worthy the title of
sophistry.
PARADISE, OR PURGATORY?
Being particularly desirous to know what kind of'a musical dish the
Philharmonic Society had set before the Queen and the subscribers at
the concluding concert, Mr. Punch, on the following morning, sent for
the two journals in which the two ablest musical critics of the day keep
watch and ward. The great and important novelty of the night was
a composition, called Paradise and the Peri, by Dr. Schumann, and
Mr. Punch't mind was thus set at rest, and his curiosity satisfactorily
met.
THE TIMES says—
"We have only to add that raradite
and the Peri, as a musical composition, is
destitute of invention, and wanting in
intelligible form. In short, anything so
hopelessly dreary, so wholly made up of
shreds and patcheB, so ill-defined, so gene-
rally uninteresting, we have rarely heard.''
And the question being thus decided, and the foolish idea of the
heterodox, who think that there is no such thing as an absolute fact in
musical art, being thus overthrown, Mr. Punch is happy to place on
imperishable record the opinions of his brother critics with whom, he
begs to add, that he cordially agrees, without having heard the compo-
sition they describe.
THE DAILY HEWS says—
"From the impression on ourselves, as
well as the evident effect on a highly
critical audience, we believe Paradise and
the Peri to be a work of great genius and
power, of which the beauties will develope
themselves more and more as it is oftener
heard a.
Pretty Little Platitudes.
He who can compose his own mind is evidently superior to the com-
poser of such an opera as La Traviata.—The Alderman who conquers
his appetite is immeasurably above a conqueror like General
Walker. Britannia, who roles the waves, is not to be admired half
so much as the Woman who rules her temper!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"The very Idea of Work this Beatjtiiul Weather is Repugnant to my Feelings."
[Extract from our Young Friend
* *'t Letter.
PARSING A SENTENCE.
We lately suggested the purchase or hire of a Murray's Grammar
for the War Office, and we now venture to propose that an additional
copy of that popular composition of "the rules for speaking and writing
correctly," should be furnished for the use of the Court Newsman.
We are not aware who the individual may be that attends to the
Literary Department of the Court, nor do we know whether the
Editor of the London Gazette, whose intellectual faculties are so suc-
cessfully devoted to the Lists of Bankrupts, and other interesting
matter, is charged also with the additional task of drawing up the
Court Circular; but, if so, whoever he may be, there is no doubt that
a Grammar (if he would read it) would form a valuable addition to his
library. _ .
That we are not recommending a superfluous outlay, will be clear to
any one who reads the following paragraph from a recent Number of the
Court Circular:
"At the Drawing-Room on the 20th Instant, Ladt Hositwood wag presented to
the Qukbk upon her marriage, by the Dowaqke Lady Honeywood."
Everybody knows what is really meant by the above lines, but if they
were to be interpreted according to strict grammatical rule, they would
be understood to announce that the Queen was married on the day of
the Drawing-Boom, that the marriage ceremony had been performed
by the Dowager Lady Honeywood, and that Lady Bonbywood had
been presented to Her Majesty on the occasion. Surely this, or
nothing is the true grammatical sense of the words "Lady Honey-
wood was presented to the Queen upon her (the Queen's) marriage, by
the Dowager Lady Honeywood." We hope that in the estimates
for next year, a vote of two guineas will be taken for the attendance of
the Court Newsman at some evening school for adults, where a plain
English education may be obtained.
SWEET SENTIMENT!
Beware how you address yourself in anger to any one. An angry
word is like a letter put into the post—once dropt, it is impossible to
recall it!
A REGULAR SHIFT OF FOFERT.
Roue having manifestly become too hot to hold the Pope, except
under the refrigerant influence of cold steel, in the form of bayonets,
the idea of divesting the Papacy of its secular character, is getting to
be seriously entertained by Roman Catholics themselves. A French
priest, the Abb£ J. H. Michon, has just published a pamphlet on the
separation of the temporal from the spiritual authority of the Roman
Pontiff, under the title of La Papaute a Jerusalem, proposing that his
Holiness should transfer the Holy See to the metropolis of the Holy
Land. The Latin and Greek Churches have long been breaking each
other's heads in the most scandalous manner at Jerusalem; and it is
feared that those heads would be brought into still worse collision by
the triple-crowned head of the former Church betaking itself thither.
The See of Gobat, also, would be invaded, if not displaced, by the
transference of the See of Peter, so called, and Bishop Gobat might
be disposed to resent that proceeding as a decided case of Papal
Aggression. The result would be, on the whole, a state of things not
calculated to tend to the conversion of the Turks, who are little enough
edified, as it is. by the conduct of devotees/ amongst whom they have
to preserve order with a whip.
For these reasons it must be regarded as decidrdly unadvisable to
transport the Papacy to Jerusalem. Among Protestants, we believe,
the prevailing opinion is, that the Pope had better go to Jericho.
Our Narrow Thoroughfares.
The Commissioners of Regent Street had a meeting last week, to
take into consideration, whether it would be possible to enlarge the
street, in order to accommodate the growing dimensions of the ladies'
dresses. It has been calculated that at present the thoroughfare is not

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PRAMA IN A BAD WAY.

T is a curious fact
that the two great
attractions of the
present season hare
been a case of Con-
sumption at Hbb
Majesty's Theatre
and a case of death
from Malaria at the
Lyceum. The in-
teresting Piccolo-
mini has been musi-
cally coughing at
one house, while
the gifted Ristori
has been most ef-
fectively gasping at
the other, and each
sufferer has been
exhibiting the ef-
fects of her malady
before a series of
the most brilliant
and fashionable au-
diences. We con-
fess that with all
our admiration for
Piccolomini's charming acting in La Traeiata, we were delighted to
see her in full health and spirits in La Figlia del Reggimento, where
her liveliness and her pathos find full scope without any portion of
painful feeling being mixed up with them.
We have heard it whispered that in order to take advantage of the
prevailing taste of the public in favour of dramatic disease, a variety of
maladies are in preparation at the minor theatres of the Metropolis.
A tremendous effect might be produced by an elaborate Influenza in
five Acts, at the Princess's, commencing with a cold in the head, which
would afford ample opportunity for the display of Mb. Charles
Kean's peculiar abilities. A prodigious sensation could be caused in
the third Act by a sneezing fit to soft music, forming a kind of catarrh
accompaniment, and winding up with a series of vigorous blows on six
trumpets, with a (nasal) organ .behind the scenes, which would be a
very peculiar feature.
There are many kinds of illness which could be adapted for stage
representation without the unpleasantness attaching to the idea of a
fatal result, and a good domestic drama might be concocted in which
Mb. N. T. Hicks would possibly draw all London by a powerful deli-
neation of a hero with a whooping cough. A fine situation might arise
between himself and the villain—we aon't know who is the regular
Victoria villain at the present moment—where, in the midst of a terrific
quarrel, the utterance of both might be simultaneously choked, that of
the villain with rage, and that of the hero with a fit of whooping
cough. In the midst of this the heroine, who might be suffering
slightly from nettle-rash—(a good opportunity for the introduction'of
real nettles)—would add powerfully to the effect by rushing in upon
the scene, exclaiming, "Rash man, forbear!" when the villain replying,
Nettle-Rash woman, avaunt! "—and the recollection of her sufferings
being revived, a tableau would ensue, on which the curtain would fall,
leaving the audience in a state of stupor, from which the cry of
"^Porter !" would alone rally them.
For one of the Theatres at the East "End, where bold and broad
effects are in great demand, a Drama founded on, and called Tooth-
Ache, would admit of the concoction of one of those famous bills which
were once in great vogue, and which still possess a charm for the un-
sophisticated portions of the community. The "characters and inci-
dents" could be set forth at considerable length/and might include the
INCIPIENT DECAY OF THE DEXTER MOLAR!
with the
FRIGHTFUL APPROACH -OF THE FORCEPS!!
and
HORRIBLE HOLDING OF THE JAW OF HILDEBRAND!!!
The principal character might be a dentist of mean extraction in love
with the daughter of Hildebrand, sumamed the martyr, (from his being
a martyr to the tooth-ache), and the denouement might consist of the
refusal of the dentist to finish an operation he might have been allowed
to commence on Hildebrand') tooth, until the latter had consented to
the marriage of his daughter with the humble but talented practitioner.
A scene, in which the low-born lover would hurl defiance at the very
teeth of the aristocrat, would be sure to bring down t bunders of applause
and the struggle between pain and pride,, in which Hildebrand should
at one moment wish to have it out in one sense, and then in another,
would be sure to bring down the gallery, raise up the pit, and moisten
the lids of the boxes, or unhinge them in a most extraordinary manner.
A RAILWAY TO EOME.

And, nicely steering through Messina's Straits,
Went to Philippi: whither Brutus was
Cited by Julius C.hsar's angry ghost.
O venerable crew, especially
Thou, ever memorable Trumpeter,
Thou Hero who didst wear the scarlet coat;
Ye, against whom, of course on your return,
The storm arose, and overset your bark.
Who were all drowned, because ye could not swim
Away; all drowned, except John Periwig,
Who, tied unto the curled extremity
Of a dead swine, escaped; immort al Shades
Who now are jolly in the Elysian fields,
Prepare to hear what will your wonder move
Beyond whate'er ye may have heard, or seen,
On that side ev'n of Styx. What do you think P
A Railway is in progress between Home,
Between the Eternal City, and a place
Which modern jargon doth Frascati call.
Where to locate—as certain people say
Of whom you never dreamt—the Terminus
Is not yet fixed: the choice doth lie between
The Baths of Titus on the Esquiliue
Hill, and the Coliseum at its foot.
This is a Terminus, I rather think,
That never on the steep Tarpeian rook
in your old time was worshipped as a god.
Patres Consoripti, only fanoy, now,
The puffing engine, and its warning scream
Heard in the Coliseum; and the cry
Of "Tickets, please!" reiterated near
Where once your populace "Hoc habet!" oried.

And cross therein the ferry of the Styx,
To see the Stoker, and the Engineer,
The Road of Iron, and the Iron Horse,
In strange cod junction with the EsquilineP
PUFFING THE SHERIFFS.
AT'the Election of Sheriffs the other day for London, the claims of
one of the candidates were made to rest on the fact of his belonging
to "one of the first houses in the City." Now we don't understand
the possibility of there being more than one "first," and though we
may talk of the "first six" or the "first twenty" there can in fact be
only one "first house in the City." Now the "first house in the City"
is undoubtedly that occupied by our old friend Tan nek of Temple Bar,
and therefore if the new Sheriff is a partner in the first house in the
City he must have a share in that easy shaving concern, which has long
marked the spot where monarchs have to wait the will of the Civic
potentate for admission.
Another reason given for the election of a Sheriff was, his alleged
determination to spend only one-third of his income, a piece of domestic
economy in which the citizens would hardly be expected to feel a very
lively interest. It is certainly advisable that the Sheriff should live
within his means, for it would be awkward if the Sheriff should fall into
the clutches of his own officers, but this calamity may be avoided
without resorting to a degree of "nearness," which a pledge to live on
a third of one's income would seem to'

and plague everybody who may happen to enter the place whioh they

case incapacitated from finding bis own way about by frenzy and
distraction of mind P We know a party who merely waiting in

ANOTHER GROSS OUTRAGE ON AMERICA.

American Gentle-
man has been denied
admission to t lie Opera,
because he was not
dressed in the Opera
costume. He was at-
tired in nankeen trou-
sers, a striped waist-
coat like a livery
servant's, a blue-fogle
handkerchief, and had
on a pea-green cut away
coat with brass buttons
as big as cheese-plates.
In vain was it repre-
sented to bim in the
politest manner by Ms.
Nugent, and other
gentlemen connected
with the Theatre, that,
the above articles (f
dress were against the
sumptuary laws in-
variably enforced at
that aristocratic esta-
blishment: the Ameri-
can gentleman only
stormed, and raved,
and blustered; and,
after many loud repe-
titions that he was a
free and enlightened
citizen of the United
States" (everyone pre-
sent admitting the ex-
treme freedom, but no
one allowing him the
smallest ray of enlightenment), he declared that if he came in a smock frock, or even in
a bathing costume, they had no right to refuse him admission. These propositions were
strongly disputed, and, on the free and enlightened citizen's becoming a nuisance, he was
civilly shown the door that leads to the nearest police-station. The American Minister was
present in the Theatre at the time, and, upon
being told of the above incident, left in great
dudgeon.
Much, as we love nonsense, and fond as we
are of caricatures, from which we derive no
contemptible income, we do hope and trust that
a pair of nankeen trousers will not be waved
as a drapeau de guerre between America and
England. The cit'zen was not compelled to go
to the Opera. If he disliked conforming to the
Opera costume, why did he not go up to the
gallery P or, better still, he had his remedy in
stopping away. We imagine that, if a "Britisher"
presented himself at Washington, and insisted
upon being introduced to the President in the
old Druidical costume, that he would not be
exactly allowed to enter.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.
Up to the second of our going to press, the
American Minister had not packed up his car-
pet-bag with the intention of leaving England.
If he is as sensible as the American papers say he
is, he will only grin, and advise;his Yankee friend
to return at once to America, where, thank the

My dear child, always call your Pastors and Masters by their right

habit.
Master L. Very well, Ma. I'm put in the fourth form—that's the
lowest in the upper school, you know—under Old Bloke.
Mrs. H. (reflectively). I didn't know there was a Master of that
name.

QUEEN ANNE IS NOT DEAD!
Some Irish Papers are seriously contending that Queen Anne after
all is not dead. They maintain that there is no one living who saw her
die; that the motives of interested persons for keeping her death a
secret, are too obvious to require any comment beipg made upon them;
and that the many assertions, so tauntingly heard in familiar discourse,
to the effect that "Queen Anne is dead," of themselves imply a doubt
that demands some investigation. They demand, therefore, that, in
spite of all the historical testimony that is accumulated by mercenary
partisans of the present Court upon the subject, there should be a
solemn investigation into every detail connected with the rumoured
decease. They simply ask that the body of Her Majesty be
exhumed, and examined by anyone but Dr. Taylor; and also that an
Inquest, of which the Jury should be composed of none but Irish Peers
of the Realm, should sit upon it. In addition to this, they further
suggest that a large Reward, something like £50,000, or £500,000,
should be offered for the recovery of Her Majesty, so as to induce her
to come forward, supposing she be still alive, or to induce others, who
may be in the Koyal secret, to tell of her whereabouts. These Irish
gentlemen wildly hold forth, that nothing short of a national scientific
inquiry like the above, will effectually set at rest the old vexata quastio,
as to whether or not "Queen Anne is dead!"

THE STATE BALLET AT THE TUILERIES.
Amusement may be furnished to some of our readers by the following
statement, from the Paris correspondence of a contemporary:—
"The Austrian, Prussian, and Bavarian Ministers at the Court of the Tuileries are
already dancing about the Empekok to plead the cause of Kino Otbo."
Diplomatic balls are not in general essentially different from balls of
an ordinary kind; assemblies for the performance of polkas, waltzes,
and quadrilles. At the former, as well as the latter, these exhibitions
of grace and agility are generally managed by the concurrence of ladies
and gentlemen; but the Austrian, Prussian, and Bavarian Ministers,
dancing about Louis-Napoleon, execute a pas de trois, or, if the
Emperor also dances, a pas de quatre, quite peculiar, in being entirely
masculine. Dancing about an Emperor to plead the cause of a King
is a mode of intercession which we did not imagine to be adopted in
actual political life, and we should never have expected it to be
practised at any Court but that of some potentate in a ballet.

H. stands for Hum.
Mb. H. Drummond came out with some strange para-
doxes during the debate on Mr. Spooner's ludicrous
Maynooth Bill. Paradoxy, indeed, rather than orthodoxy
or heterodoxy, would seem to constitute Mr. H. Drum-
mond's faith. What does Mr. H. Drummond think that
his initial H. is likely to stand for, if he goes on in this way?
Does he want to be called Hum Drummond?
BALLOONS OF THE BALL.
Ladies' dresses are generally airy at this time of the year, but those
of the present season are particularly so. In Paris—the Head-quarters
of Fashion—the Holy See of the modish world—air, atmospheric air, is
actually a component part of female attire. A gentleman, evidently a
lady's gentleman at any rate, the correspondent of an elegant morning
journal, describes himself as having attended at the late Imperial bap-
tismal ball at tbe Hotel de Ville. The immense circumference of the
skirts thereat exhibited, astounded him; and by his account it appears
that the expansion of female drapery has become so excessive as to
constitute the wearer a peifect nuisance to herself, and as great a
nuisance as it is possible for a creature of loveliness to be to all about
her. It renders the exertion of getting into and out of a carriage a
difficulty amounting to a perfect trial', and its inconvenience is bitterly
complained of by many of the sufferers whom an imperious necessity
compels to submit thereto. And yet a heartless punster might perhaps
have the barbarity to describe this dreadful inconvenience as an airy
nothing, since, in some instances, at least, it is created by the mere
force of air. The gentleman above alluded to records a conversation
with one of the complainants, whereof the following is an extract:—
"' Is it permitted, Madame,' said I,'to go a little below the Rurface, and ask of what
material this vast expansion is composed ?1 'Oh yes I she had a pleasure in exposing
it—crinoUne sometimes—sometimeB a number of—one over the other—and sometimes
a jupqii it tubes d'air.'" ,
The air-tubes mu«t be preferable for lightness, both to the crinoline
and the number of dashes one over the other; and "light as fairy foot
can fall" must be the step of the girl who is buoyed up by this airy
under-clothing. A boy, by the way, would perhaps express the opinion
that the would bound after the manner of a football welt blown up.
But, though light, it is questionable whether the jupon a tubes d'air
has the recommendation of coolness. Air is a bad conductor, and when
confined, arrests the passage of heat. Much caloric is generated
during a quadrille, and its escape would be opposed by the air-tubes.
If additional lightness were desirable, the jupon might be distended
with hydrogen instead of atmospheric air; but the substitution might
not be unattended with danger. Hydrogen is an inflammable gas, and
some mischievous juvenile might be tempted to puncture the puffed
garment, with the view of creating merriment by occasioning its
collapse. Were any flame in the vicinity, unless the flame were a
peculiar flame, an explosion might be the consequence, which, commu-
nicated horn jupon to jupon, would cause all the ladies in the room to
blow up, one after the other. This is not the way in which young
ladies in a ball-room would wish to go off. In wearing their dresses,
therefore, with an air, they should not give themselves such airs as
hydrogen.
One obvious advantage of the air-petticoat appears to have struck
the observer whom we have quoted; and who proceeds:—
"A little knowledge Is a dangerous thing, and as my informant was — ty, I ventured
to ask if the fair one could blow herself up, and let off the air at discretion for the bit*-
Vtre of those around."
This, it appears, was quite practicable; and it would greatly simplify
the question of getting in and out of carriages: though to see a lady
blowing herself out in any o her manner than that which is usual at a
pic-nic or at supper, might appear somewhat ridiculous. To promote
the bien-etre of-tbose around in letting the air off, a few drops of essence
of lavender or violet or otto of roses, might be introduced into the air
tubes pieviously to filling them, and then the lady would fold herself
up as a flower does at evening, exhaling fragrance as its petals
close.
If the air employed in clothing Beauty with a balloon were tbe
protoxide of nitrogen, or laughing gas, the hilarity necessarily attendant
on its liberation would perhaps be augmented.
In concluding our observations on this delicate subject, we may
remark that Ma. Carlylb might, with great propriety, apply the term
Windbag to the wearer of the jupon a tubes d air; though soma per-

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
he 30th of June, Mon-
day.— Lobd Derby
declined to go on with
his jocular bill for
omitting all the ab-
surdity from the Oath
of Abjuration except
the one absurdity
which excludes the
Jew from Parliament.
The East India Com-
pany was again ex-
Eosed. The Directors
»ve been doing the
creditable trick of
perform ingagenerous
action at somebody
else's expense—they
have been presenting
£500 to the inundated
French out of the
money belonging to
the public. But this
is a trifle to the Corn-
cany, which, as Lord
Ellenborough ex-
plained, is in the
habit of spending
£33,000,000 a-year without any independent audit. It was announced that Mrs.
Thompson, mother of one of the heroes of Kara, was to be assisted partly by the
War Office, and " partly another way." With the public impression of the War
Office, it will be thought that whatever the other way may be, it will be the
preferable one.
The House of Commons was occupied to-night and the following night with a
debate upon the American Enlistment Question. An Irish nobody, named Moore,
who commits abusive speeches to memory, and utters them with some energy,
moved a resolution to the effect that Ministers deserved to be censured for their
conduct. The discussion was not lively, for no one was the least in earnest. The
best speeches were the Attorney-General's and Mr. Gladstone's, and the
latter, after cutting the Ministers to pieces, went out and voted for them. The
plain English of the case is, that we wanted recruits, and that the Americans and
our. Government here knew perfectly well that Mr. Champion was to get tbem if
he could. For a long time no notice was taken of the matter; but, as Pierce's
Government wanted a clap-trap, they suddenly pretended to resent what they had
been tacitly sanctioning, and we, who no doubt had committed an infraction of
American law, had to back out of the fix as well as we could. In strictness, there-
fore, Government were wrong; but, under the circumstances, it was no case for a
vote of censure; and, besides, who was going to endanger a Ministry in July, and
with the white-bait dinner actually fixed.r So, on division, Ministers had 274 votes,
and Moore 80.
Tuesday. A blood relation of Pat O'Daiset and Misthress Caset, need we
name Lord Donougbmore, complained of the expense of an Irish Lord's proving
his right to vote for the representative peerage. This costs £150, whereas an
English peer can take his seat, for £5. All things considered, Mr. Punch may
congratulate his friend Lord Fermot (Burke Roche), who, it has just been
decided, is not a lawfully constructed peer of Ireland.
Wednesday. The Commons rejected a bill for regulating the hours of labour in
the bleaching factories, where it appears "young girls are worked 16,18, and 20
hours a-day in a temperature varying from 90 to 130 degrees, and from some of the
apartments in which, persons are habitually carried out in a fainting state." It
was perfectly right, ana in accordance with the principles of trade, to reject this
bill, because it was shown that had these children been relieved, it would have been
impossible to sell the article they produce at the same rate of profit as now. Mr.
Punch is much disgusted, and he is sure his Manchester friends will be equally so
with Mr. Walter, who made the nnphilosophical and unenlightened remark, that
"It was alleged that bills of this kind interfered with manufactures; but political j
economists overlooked the million of children yearly added to our population, by far {
the most interesting and important of our productions. The Legislature would, in
bis opinion, grossly neglect its duty if it did not take care that the youth of this
country, upon whom i s future strength and greatness depended, were so brought
up that the development of their mental and bodily powers was not impeded by
over-work."
Thursday. The Divorce Bill came on again, and the Bishops, led by Dr.
Wilbebjorce, exerted themselves to damage it as much as possible, by taking
out the clause which proposes to do some little justice to women. But Mr. Punch's
appeal to the Lords to protect the women of England against these priests was not
made in vain, and the Bishops were signally defeated, the division being 43 to 10.
the touters who hang about St. Paul's Churchyard, and
insult you if you say that you don't want a marriage licence,
having made a grab at " compensation." In supply, Lord
Palmebston said that, as the plunder of Sebastopol would
give only half-a-crown a-pitce to our officers, ana sixpence
to our men, the Government had liberally determined to
keep it all to themselves. The entry of the Guards was
alluded to, and it was seated that the rou'e was not settled;
but it is understood that Sir Richard Aibet desires to
bring the men skulking in by the most private way, as be
conceives that the Guards are the Queen's Guards, and
that the people have nothing to do with them. The
bungling routineer of the Crimea comes out again: Sir
Bichard has evidently learned nothing,—let Turn learn
this:—
"Another of Sib Richard's blundering freaks,
lie 'H get our Guardsmen christened AiKKT-Sneaks."
Friday. The idea of work this beautiful weather was quite
repugnant to Mr. Punch's feelings, so he calmly counted
himself out, and drank himself, iced, at Greenwich.

BIRDS AND BURDENS.
Whether it is the heat of the weather, or any other
influence, we will not pretend to say, but there has certainly
been an unusual oddness lately about some of the advertise-
ments. Among others, we have an announcement headed
"First Class Fowls and Eggs from the Same"
which proceeds to talk about all sorts of strange birds,
including "Buenos Ayrean duck?," and at last reaches a
sort of climax in the words—" Fowls, by Baily, 2s. j by
post, is. Id." How the fowls can be "by Baily" it is
very difficult to understand, unless Baily is the name of
some remarkable bird whose progeny is popular. We are
happy to find these fowls so cheap as to be sold for two
shillings, though we are a little astonished to hear that
they can be sent "by post" for an extra penny.
We know that all kinds of things may be sent through
the Post-Office, but the idea of enclosing a fowl in an
envelope and thrusting him into a box, after putting a
Qdben's Head upon him—to say nothing of the processes
of stamping, sorting, and all the other arrangements inci-
dental to transmission by post—is, to say the least of it,
rather a novel one. It is to be hoped that a letter-carrier
is not often burdened with "Fowls by Baily," or any
other member of the feathered tribe; for we can scarcely
conceive anything more difficult of delivery. We can
understand the sending of "winged words" in the shape
of correspondence, but we do not think that Fowls ought
to be allowed to creep in under such a category.
Free Libraries v. St. Fancras.
In the Commons, the Solicitor-General made signals of distress touching his
bill for reforming the Doctors' Commons nuisance, declaring that in trying to please
everybody he had offended everybody. The rapacity of the ecclesiasticals has been
curiously evinced ever since the measure was introduced j every official, including
I It is instructive to know that the individual, by whose
j influence the adoption of Mr. Ewart*s Free Libraries Act
was defeated in St. Pancras, was—a sweep. "The school-
master is abroad," said Brougham; bat the schoolmaster,
I being abroad, hardly thought to be knocked down by a
chimney-sweeper. This is Broom against Brougham with
'a vengeance!

"PORTER'S PROGRESS OF THE NATION."

HE door of the
House of Commons
ought to be a very
valuable one, con-
sidering what it
costs to keep up
every year. The j
following sums are
what John Bull
pays annually to
guard the entrance
of the Legisla-
ture :—
The First Doorkeeper
receives . . £300
The Becond Doorkeeper
. . 160
The reader will
confess that £550
every twelvemonth
is a "swingeing"
price for a door!
The company within
ought to be a little
more select, when
the doorkeepers re-
ceive such enormous
salaries to protect
it. Yet, if they did
their work effici-
ently, no one would
begrudge them their
large pay. If they seut back every unworthy member: if they allowed only the
pure, the good, the honest, or the clever to enter, we should be the first to suggest
that, far from being overpaid, they were shamefully underpaid in proportion to the
vast amount of benefit they rendered to the community. But, with their duties
thus rieorouBly cirried out, there would soon be little or nothing for them to do.
The office would, very quickly, become fxtiuct. St. Stephens' would present
the curious spectacle every night of "No House," and two doorkeepers to guard
the door of it 1
And why two doorkeepers? Is the door such a heavy cumbrous affair, so
very difficult to push aside, that it takes two men to throw it open f And yet,
w hen we look at the number of small, weak men who have got into the House,
this cannot be. Perhaps one door-keeper attends specially to the Whig*, and the
other touches his hat only to the Tories. Or, It niay be that the majority
claims the uudivided attention of Janitor No. 1, whilst Janitor No. 2 (the one
with the smaller salary) keeps a watchful eye over the less important movements
of the minority. Or, more likely still, one goes to sleep whilst the other watches,
and thus they relieve each other in turns.
But the amount of Porter's work does not end here. On looking at the "Civil
Service Estimates" (that tremendous Blue Pill which Joun Bull is obliged to
swallow every year) we find the following cheerful items:—

at £300 each
at £170
£900
180
340
160
140
130
110
"Message" carried, and pays himself his own salary into
the bargain. But, we are a great country! We pay door-
keepers of the Houses of Parliament more liberally than
the great authors whom thewoild has admitted into the
Temple of Fame, and, to messengers who run with the
private notes of members, we give greater salaries than
any pension we should award to an astronomer who had
been surveying all his life the paths of Eeaven.
Altogether, we think we can fairly congratulate our
readers upon the very- bright prospects of "Porter's
Progress of the Nation.
BLOOD AT THE SEA-SIDE.
We take the subjoined very promising advertisement
from theTimet:—
SEA-SIDE.—Board and Residence.—A gentleman and hie
wife nearly allied to a titled family, REQUIRE the SOCIETY of one
or tiro LADIES wishing lor pure air and w-a-batbing. The dlstanoe a
few hours from town. References given, and terms liberal. $tete real
name by letter to , care of .
At first blush this seems to be a very advantageous offer
to any two ladies of eternal friendship desirous of purity
of air and saltness of water. Nevertheless, gentlewomen
cannot be too cautious. "Nearly allied to a titled family."
This sounds well; aud yet, in what degree of consanguinity?
It is plain that there is nothing sordid in the advertisement.
The gentleman and his wife are too near nobility to think
of housing and boarding lodgers. Th»-y simply "Require
the Society of one or two Ladies." S-ill, were we two
ladies," we should like to know the exact degree of rela-
tionship between our nominal landlord and landlady and the
House of Lords. Again, it would surely answer the
advertisers' views—allowing that, at the last moment,
they could be induced to take payment for bnard and lodging
—did they sp:ciry tbeir exact heraldry. However, people
who are taken by such an advertisement, full soon know
how much such advertisers quarter on the spoons of the
establishment.
You would imagine that was sufficient—but pray have a little
There is another charming little item (a "little one thrown in ") of
Temporary Messengers . £600
You wou'd suppose that it could go no further, but it only shows how incon-
siderate some people are. You would not send out a messenger, and not pay
his expenses? Shabbiness like that could not be tolerated in au establishment
where the doorkeeper receives just one-fourth of the sum granted every year to
destitute men of genius. Consequently, there is an additional item, and it could
not be more reasonable, considering exercise generally engenders in messengers an
inordinate thirst for beer.!
Messengers' Journeys
£200
You think this is, at last, the finish, but it is only another proof of your parsi-
mony and intolerance. Messengers do not carry letters. Tbey are only the
bearers of messages. The distinction is a very large one in a country where there
is a Post-Office. But as St. Martin's-le-Grand is not large enough to transmit
the business of Parliament, we are. furnished with another elegant item in the
shape of—
Porters for carrying out Letters for the"several departments . £500
Thus, for doorkeepers, messengers, and porters, we have the pleasure of paying
annually no less a sum total than £3,710! We "guess " that, for a considerably
smaller figure than that, the President of the United States gets his little
HEALTH OF THE DRAMA.
During the last week, the Drama has not been laid up
with any fresh complaint. Its morality has fortunately
been spared another attack. We are glad to state that
every play-bill has presented, as compared with previous
weeks, a clean bill of health. There has not been a single
case of consumption—not even of galloping consumption
at Astleys. It is also our pleasant duty to record, that
the crime of poisoning has for a time ceased, which must
be looked upon as a most favourable symptom. There has
only been one slight attack of Malaria at the Royal Italian
Opera, but nothing has resulted from it. The Press, having
seen that the drama, which presented some very ugly
features, was properly ventilated in time, may be thanked
for preventing the evil spreading any further. The other
side of the water is equally healthy. At the Victoria as at
the Surrey, not a single victim to measles, nor hooping-
cough, nor small-pox, nor even the influenza, is on the
play-books. Altogether, as far as the health of the Drama
is concerned, there has been duiing the last few days a
welcome change for the better, and we hope the improve-
ment will gradually continue until there is no longer any
necessity for the drama to encroach again on the province
of the hospital.
The Character we English have Abroad.
"Did you ever meet with the Bating Englishman on
your travels, Count.?'' inquired a y«'ung Ldy of a cele-
brated French traveller. Pardon, Miss (was the Count's
reply), it is true I meet every year a large number of your
compatriotes, who tiavel as the English only can travel, but
it never was my pleasure to meet what you call The Roving
Englishman. Mais en revanche, Miss, I can tell you I
have been fort.una»e enough to meet more than one
time—The Raving Englishman.1"
SENSELESS PREJUDICE.
In rejecting the Oa hs of Abjuration Bill, the House of
Lords has at least shown a great want of Commons' Sense.

be career is opening to female
talent wider and wider. Not
long ago we had to congra-
tulate two ladies on having
obtained diplomas and es-
tablished themselves in prac-
tice as physicians. Subjoined
is an advertisement which
shows that the fair sex is be-
ginning to occopy a position
in the commercial world, and
that beauty is taking an im-
portant part in business:—

Too long have young
ladies of independent feel-
ings, but in circumstances
of an opposite kind, had to
choose between going for a
governess or for a wife. An
engagement as a canvasser
will afford an escape from either species of domestic servitude. As
the power of persuasion is- a pre-eminent attribute of womankind, there
is no function for which women are better qualified than that of can-
vassing—except, of course, that of nursing. Many a young lady can
handle the ribbons, in the sense of driving a gig; though in these rail-
way days, the possession of that accomplishment is not so imperative
as it formerly »as on the commercial traveller. In every other respect
of qualification for that capacity young ladies have much the advantage
of men, and are far better adapted to go about soliciting and coaxing
people for orders. We may then fore expect that T. G., which initials
have hitherto been supposed to stand for Travelling Gent., will hence-
forth be also understood to mean Travelling Girl, unless it shall
become customary to appropriate T. L. as a distinctive cypher, to
Travelling Ladies, or Travelling Lasses. Taverns will then, of course,
contain a Ladies' Commercial Room, sacred to Commercial Ladies,
and whence all other Indies will be excluded. In this apartment a
tariff of commercial prices will be insisted on, and a stipulated charge
will he made for tea and bread aud butter, pastry, lemonade, bntis,
ices, lobster-ealad, can de Cologne, patchouli, and sal-volatile. Tlie
Times, and also Le Follei will be taken in.
Representative Women.
Soke strongminded women are of opinion that ladies ought to be
eligible for seats iu Parliament. Against their view has been urged
the argument, that if this were the case there would be too much
talking. There is too much talking in the House already; but the
admission of ladies as Members would not perhaps increase that. On
the contrary, it might tend to diminish discussion, by creating additional
inducement to pairing off.
NO ANSWER PROM NAPLES!
England and France make a communication to the King op
Naples, but, says Lord Clarendon, bis Majesty deigns no reply.
How long is this to last? If Bomba is silent, is that any reason that
English cannon have lost their tongue?
THE CHAFF OF A COMMON LAWYER.
A Dog-pight, a horse-race, a masquerade, a public execution, to
persons facetiously and insolently disposed, afford suitable opportunities
for insulting each other, or for insulting gentlemen, by that, species of
personal banter which cads call " chaff" An investigation of a charge
of manslaughter before a Magistrate, however, will hardly pethaps be
considered by most people to furnish a quite legitimate occasion for
such indulgence in low raillery. Among the few who may entertain
a different opinion.on this point, it appears that we must class
Mr. Clarkson, the Old Bailey barrister. This person, in the exercise
of his vocation at Bow Street, pending a case of the kind above
mentioned, is reported to have combined the cross-examination of
Dr. Elliotson with certain jocose personalities which may be included
under I he head of chaff. Dr. Elliotson having stated that he had found
continuance in a shower-bath for eight minutes and forty seconds very
disagreeable, the following remark was— according to the report—
addressed to him by funny Mr. Clarkson :—
"Bnt then yon did not go in as an excited lunatic, I presume, which makes all the
difference. (A kmgh.)"
We are not told whether or not the learned and funny gentleman
gave a peculiar force to bis joke by laying an emphasis on the word
'excited;" bnt what follows is calculated to suggest the probability
that the .witticism did partake of the nature of an inuendo:—
11 By Mr. Bodkin. The temperature being much colder in April than in June, must
have made the bath much more trying to the deceased, but even at the end of June I
found it very dreadful.
"Me. Clabkson. It was not so agreeable as Mesmerism? (A laugh.)
"Dr. Elliotson. By no means. I should like you to try the difference. (Laughter.)"
There is an abuse of language known both in law and in manners as
impertinence, but it is not always the same thing among lawyers that
it is among gentlemen. Impertinence with the former is mere
surplusage—words which are beside the question. By the latter
impertinence is understood to imply iosult also, which legal imper-
tinence does not necessarily imply. Mr. Clarkson, however, ingeni-
ously combined those two kinds of impertinence) in "chaffing"
Dr. Elliotson. Everybody knows that Dr. Elliotson has for a long
time been engaged in investigate g the subject of Mesmerism, and, in
common with many other men of science, has arrived at a conviction
that its apparent phenomena are real. Now, whether Mesmerism is a
fact or a delusion, Dr. Elliotson is, at any rate, a teamed arid skilful
physician; and to rally sncb a man on that subject is, at best, the same
kind of jocosity as would be exhibited in poking fun under the same
circumstances, that is, in a ctjurt of jus ice and apart from the matter
in hand, at Father Newman on the subject of miracles. It is also
like reminding a glazier of putty, a tailor of goose, or a shoe-maker of
wax-ends, as is commonly done by the class of people who supply
Old Bailey barristers with clients, and from whom Mr. Clarkson
probably learned to talk in that sort of way to Dr. Elliotson. It may
to be sure be suggested on the other hand, that Mr. Clarkson really
believed, and was therefore as an advocate justified in insinuating,
that Dr. Elliotson was mad on the subject of Mesmerism. His way
of thinking perhaps is that gregarious kind of thought which regards
belief of any wonder as madness until the wonder conies to be generally
helieved. He knew that Dr. Elliotson had sacrificed many fees to
the spirit of research which impelled bim to pursue the study of
Mesmerism—that he had sacrificed fees to scientific enthusiasm. Very
likely the enthusiasm to which fees are sacrificed appeal s.tbe uttermost
lunacy to Mr. Clarkson.
It will have been observed that Dr. Elliotson proved himself quite
capable, not only of standing chaff, hut also of meeting it with a
suitable and good-humoured reply. For this ability to give Mr.
Clarkson "as good as he brought," as the saying is, Dr. Elliotson
was no doubt indebted to the large professional experience which has
familiarized him with the tone of low as wtllas of high life, and taught
him bow, upon occasion, to adapt [a repartee to the calibre of the
inferior classes.

'Tis a nuisance, my Prince, fur you; yea 'tis a bore
That jou can't have the Pictures at Kensington Gore.
Ah, the stubborn, perverse, disagreeable crew,
That outvoted the Court, and the Government too!
Hang the dogs!—I bad rather not say who they are,
For fear that I might be had up at their bar:
Let them triumph! we know that they 're all in disgrace,
Excluded for ever from honour and place.
Never mind, noble Prince, we our crosses have all,
Your great matters if I may compare with our small;
But when you complain of your bad luck, you should,
I would humbly suggest, also think of your good.
Just consider how great is the length of the rope
Which your taste is allowed—how extensive a scope
Your invention enjoys, since you're left to assume
Unrestricted control of the Army costume.
Recollect with a fiat obeyed as divine,
The uniform, both of the Guards and the Line,
You dictate, unchecked by a mutinous vote
From improving the soldier's cap, trousers, or coat.

To abolish your power upon martial attire;
In spite cf the Commons, in spite of the Peers,
Sure as Pate for our forces you '11 still hold the shears.
When you fashion the clothes of an a^my ao fine,
At a small disappointment you should not repine;
At not haviDg jour way in a matter so light,
As the choice of a National Gallery's site.
Then but think, noble Prince, of the baton you wield;
A Field Marshal's—Hyde Park, I believe, is the field;
So that you'd give direction to Williams of Kars
Iu case jou were ever to go to the wars.
A Field Marshal, too, knows that though forced to retreat,
A General is not always finally beat;
Better fortune next Session may possibly bring,
And more vigorous pressure accomplish the thing.
Let the whip be with greater severity plied.
And a little more dexterous influence be tried,
And the Public may yet have to travel footsore
For a sight of its pictures, to Kensington Gore.
Falmerston and the Pope.
A Correspondent in a Dresden paper avers, that the Pope, in
defiance of the Cardiuals, resolved on having Lord Palmebston gibbeted
in Roman type; to which end his Holiness determined on printing his
Lordship's avowal in the House of Commons, that " the Roman states
of the Church were never better ruled than by the government which
was formed after the flight of the Pope." There is a slight error here
which, on the suggestion of Mr. Punch, the Pope will no doubt see
corrected. Thus, for "never better ruled," read "never so well
ruled?" Mr. Punch is only sorry that the French didn't leave
well alone.
A New Saint.—We understand that, in recognition of the filial
duty of Mr. Bowyeb, as a son of the church, the Pope has promised
in due season to put him in the Calendar. Mb. Bow yer will be

RUDE QUESTIONS TO A WIFE.

ell us, do you recollect
what jour feelings were im-
mediately after you had
given >our husband cold
meat for dinner? Did you
not feel a.«hamed, and angry
with yourself, and vow that
you would never do so
again?—Do you mean to
say you have never searched
your husband's pockets?
Have you not blushed a
papal scarlet when you
found Hi-it they contained
only some cigar - ends, a
musty glove or two, a few
halfpence well puned with
biscui t c r um as, and, perhaps,
an old playbill ?—Can you,
also, lay your band upon the
tea caddy, and solemnly de-
clare that you have never,
on any rare occasion, opened
one of the poor innocent's
letters? and have you not
been ready to cry with vex-
ation, when you found that
your suspicions had been
roused by noi hing better than
a tailor's piteous application'for money ?—Do your powers of recollection
enable you to give impartially the secret history of every " Sick Head-
ache," that has prevented your coming down to dinner? and, also, is
your memory strong enough to describe the various remedies that have
been employed before the same, could, or would, be relieved?—Have
you never, in a fit of uncontrollable indignation, threatened to go home
to your mamma? and can you, without much prejudice, inform us who
was to blame in each instance for such provocation ?—Have you anything
to reproach yourself with regard to that same "mamma? She is an
excellent woman, of course; but was it the best policy, do you think,
to have her so incessantly in the house? or, granting that necessity,
was it prudent, or kind, do 'you imagine, to make all the arrangements
of the house subservient to her comfort? and to neglect your husband's
wants to attend to her whims and fancies? Aud again, we must put
to you the rude question, whether, on second reflection, it would not
have been, perhaps, better to have denied her the veiy free use of that
black paint that she delighted in besmearing your husband with every
day from head to foot? and we trust you will tell us whether the
result of those noircevrs was not to make out your husband (supposing
he was already a little bit of a " black sheep") to be a thousand times
blacker than there was any humane occasion for ?—Have you never pur-
posely mislaid—in other words, hidden—the key of the cellarette, when

when an invitation has come that your husband was particularly anxious
you should accept, equivocated just a little by saying that" you had not a
gown to go in? and was not the object of such equivocation, if we
might be allowed to hint such a thing, to put your husband's well known
generosity to the test ?—Talking of dresses, do you recollect that beautiful
noire antique that you saved by a beautiful financial coup de main-out of
the pies and puddings? Was it fair to the poor fellow when he is so fond
of gooseberry-pudding, and you know he has said over and over again
that he could dine off cherry-tart ?—Are von quite sure that the cook
does not know how to cook tripe? or is it because you think it vulgar
—or because you do not like it yourself—that you always refuse to let
your husband have some for supper ?—Which is the most advisable, do
you think, to allow smoking at home, or to drive your, husband out
of doors to have his cigar elsewhere ?—And, when he has come home
late and tired, do you think it kind, or generous, to pester him with a
long string of questions as to where he has been? and what he has been
doing? and whether he is not ashamed of himself? and whether it
would not be better for him to spend his money on his family? &c, &c,

CAPTAIN PEN.
Our readers are requested not to draw any uncharitable inference
from the absence of Our Special Correspondent" from his proper
place in the triumphal procession of the Guards. Mr. Punch knows
that circumstances not at present to be dwelt upon, prevented the
appearance of "Our Special Correspondent," upon whom, on his way
with the troops to the Park, so many fair hands would have rained
roses. However, at the time we write, it has been decided to mark, in
as significant a maimer as possible, tbe vital services of "Our Special
Correspondent" as the saviour of tbe remnant of the Crimean Army.
To this end, a herald (probably Mr. Planch£, as the most accomplished
equestrian) will ride upon a piebald horse (piebald, to mark the black
and white of letters), the herald wearing a tabard formed of a copy of
the Times. He will carry a magnificent gold inkstand (the gold from
the Ural mountains) in which will be a snow-white swan-quill. In this
manner will Captain Sword delight to honour Captain Pen.
GOOD EXERCISE FOR STOUT PERSONS.
A Few years back, there was produced at the Odeon in Paris a
comedy called Un Voyage autour de ma Femme. We do not think
the same enterprising individual would like to undertake the same
journey now. As fashion has increased tbe circumference of a woman
to almost that of a petit Paris, we fancy our hardy voyageur would be
tired before he had circumambulated even one half of the outer Boule-
vards. It would be like walking round the skirts of a crinoline
metropolis. Seats should be erected at certain distances, to enable the
tired traveller to rest.

one half of men were drunkards or thieves, and that the other half
were no better, with the further iniquity of beating their wives. We

TRADE REPORT.
There has been a great stir in the cloth market
during the last week. "The military official"
from America, on the pressing advice of Mr.
Dallas, has submitted to be measured for a new
pair of pants; the ambassador condescending to
observe, by way of mollification, to the citizen,
"measures not men." The velvet trade has
received a considerable impetus, one stock, at
least, having been ordered at a wholesale house;
the velvet was Genoese, in compliment to the
King of Sardinia. We have further to mark
a lively advance in tbe article of bristles; which
we attribute to the circumstance of a new set of
blacking-brushes having been ordered at_ the
American Legation, for the use of those Citizens
who may vouchsafe to have their free and inde-
pendent shoe-leather polished before it con-
descends to tread upon the flooring of St.
James's Palace; and further, Russian duck and
soap have risen, a dozen of towels and six
pounds of best mottled hiving been ordered by
Mr. Dallas for those of his effeminate fellow-
citizens, who may feel disposed to wash their
hands before they permit the Queen of the
Britishers to kiss them.

A CRAVEN'S HORSE.
We have pig-iron, why not liorse-iron? Now we have little doubt
that this query was quickening in the large brain of William George
Craven, Lieutenant in the First Life Guards, when he determined to
drive his horse in a dog-cart against the railway-engine of the South-
western Railway that started from Windsor at T50 to Staines; iron
beating horseflesh by a minute or two, and so on to Hounslow, the
gallant animal and its very high-spirited master being, however, slightly
distanced by what our amiable and dulcet-tongued friends, the
Yankees, call Beelzebub in harness. Now, the distance from Windsor
to Hounslow is thirteen miles, and this distance the horse covered in an
hour and an odd minute or so. Iron, somehow, beat mere horse-flesh:
Lieutenant Craven's noble steed being scarcely up to the chivalrous
notions of his master; for the wretched animal, we are of course
understood in an equine sense, on proceeding to the George Inn, was
merely equal to its gruel, having no pluck whatever left for corn.
About a pint of gruel could the horse swallow, but not a pinch of oats.
Belcher, the groom, however, benevolently walked the horse about
the yard, as it had not got its wind." In an hour's time the faithful
groom again put the horse into the dog-cart to return to Windsor.
At Bedfont, the horse could scarcely stand. "and trembled violently."
The groom, however—perhaps the poor fellow wished to emulate the
spirit of his master—remained firm, and drove to Egham, where tbe
horse was taken out, and whereupon it broke into a cold sweat; and.
to conclude, where, after a few minutes' further trembling, the horse
dropt down dead. "Upon being opened, the cavity of the stomach
was found to contain two or three quarts of blood."
This accident was duly inquired into at the Staines Petty Sessions,
on the prosecution of Mr. Poster, a busy-body who, on the part of the
Prevention of Cruelty Society, will interfere with the liberty of the
subject as sought to be enjoyed by officers and gentlemen desirous of
beating, if only by a neck, steam and iron with horse-blood and bone.
However, Lieutenant Craven was not unsupported. One Mr.
Jennings, for the defence (we presume an attorney), in the serenity of
his legal belief declared that it was "an absurd charge. The distance
was not more than thirteen miles, and the horse could have done
double the distance in the time, which was over an hour." Twice
thirteen are twenty-six! T«enty-3ix miles in an hour and four or five
minutes. Sharp driving this. If attorneys set out for Paradise at this
speed, we can only say that tbe pace is a little more fast than sure.
A veterinary surgeon (name not given) thought the horse had died
"from apoplexy, but had not opened the head." Who knows? The
disappointed animal may have died from sheer chagrin, from downright
vexation of spirit, at its inability to fulfil the desire of its Craven
master. Further, the surgeon aforesaid "did not think that keeping
up with the railway train from Windsor to Staines, a distance of seven
miles, was calculated to injure a horse." Why, of course not. The
horses of the sun do a little more than that every day. If Apollo
had been subpoenaed, he could have proved this. Perhaps, however
Mr. Jennings had never heard of the witness.
The Magistrates deliberated and differed. They gave Mr. Craven
the benefit of a doubt; a benefit that, we hope, he will be enabled to,
make the best of. Doubt is, at, times, not a bad poultice. With respect
to the groom, however, the Magistrates fined him in the full penalty of
£5, with £5 costs; or, in default of payment, to be imprisoned for two
months and kept, to hard labour. We further learn from the report,
that "the decision evidently excited profound surprise." Doubtless,
the innocent Arcadians of Staines expected to have Belcher sentenced
to take his place in the shafts of the dog-cart, vice the horse deceased,
and with Lieutenant Craven adjudged to the box, to be run against
a railway-engine for an hour and a few minutes, with unlimited
gruel at the journey's end, and the heartiest feed (if he could only
swallow them) of the gallant Lieutenant's own wild oats.
To conclude, the inexorable Mr. Foster applied for the costs of
Mr. Craven's prosecution (just as boys at Eton are made to pay
for their own birch), price £20. The bench granted £10 costs
against Mr. Craven, as they thought Mr. Foster's application
a very reasonable one." Being so very "reasonable," it was, how-
ever, cut down to half. But such is the reward of moderation at
Staines!
Happily, we live not in heathen times, when the creed of Pythagoras
had its believers; otherwise Lieutenant Craven might have thought
of a future horse, the property of a future attorney, to be groomed by
a future groom, and examined by a future veterinary surgeon. As
hones go to the dogs, so might men pasting into horses go to dog-
carts. Only imagine, now, a fine cavalry young gentleman, suffering
the law of transmigration of soul, doomed to the shafts of a dog-cart,
with an attorney (who does not think twenty-six miles an hour sharp
driving), blue-bag and all on the box, whipped and whipped, ana
driven against a railway-engine, the impatient driver being a little late
from his chambers, Red-lion's Inn, to catch the Northern train for the
Northern circuit.
But let us be thankful that we live not in heathen days; and let
Lieutenant Craven pay his groom's fine, and his own quota of
expense, and rejoice that he is a Christian!

THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SANCTIMONY AND FIDDLE-FADDLE.
hat amusing organ of Calvinism,
the Record, launched out recently
in an article severely denouncing
fashionable amusements, especi-
ally dancing. In this effusion,
evidently conceived in a strong
spirit of old Geneva, occurs the
following passage:—
11 Truly godly persona could uo more
attend the race-course, the opera, the
theatre, or the bail-room, than they
could 6waar, lie, or steal."
if the individual who penned
the above sentence is a truly
godly person, of course he never
goes to races, operas, plays, or
balls, let he speaks so specifi-
cally in condemnation of dancing,
both as practised in ballets and
fasliionable ball-rooms, as to
make it clear that he is familiar
with the former style of dancing,
aid that he thinks at least that
lie has also seen the latter. But
at this rate, surely, he would
seem to be not so much a
truly godly person as a truly great humbug.
This writer in the Record should not take it for granted that dancing
in decent society is the same kind of thing as the dancing that he may
have witnessed, and perhaps assisted in, by the payment of one
shilling.
When this man says that truly godly persons could no more frequent
the race-course, the opera, the' theatre, or the ball-room, than they
! could swear, lie, and steal, may_ he not, however, deserve credit for
: some degree of good faith? Is it not possible that such truly godly
persons as himself might be quite capable of doing all those seven
things f
Stealing, lying, swearing, dancing, play-going, opera-going, and
attending races, are the seven deadly sins of the writer in the Record.
Music and dancing attended the return of the Prodigal; but we do
not read that cursing and swearing might as well have been indulged
in on that occasion.
That a man looks ridiculous in dancing may perhaps be said. Man,
attitudinising, and cutting capers, with flying coat-tails, may be
described as man presenting a somewhat undignified appearance. It
may be not unreasonably argued, that dancing might as well be confined
to the ornamental sex—that is, to the sex, one of whose chief uses is
the adornment of life. But to place dancing on the same footing with
stealing and swearing, indicates an idea of dancing which can only
have been derived from participation in that amusement on occasions
when profane oaths and the picking of pockets were usually its
attendant circumstances.
The morals of the fashionable world, this writer also contends, have
been depraved by the introduction of sculpture representing the mere
human form. But what doei he think of ladies' present dresses? Are
they not ample enough for him P Barefaced, indeed, and more than
half bareheaded, they certainly do leave the wearer; but the rest of
their arrangement is such as to render her an object, of that cool admi-
ration with which we contemplate a fashionably-draped lay figure.
When their flowing skirts are lifted an inch or two out of the mud,
they just disclose a pair of boots, which are simply neat and gentleman-
like, with "military heels "—to.which spurs, probably, will be annexed
in good time.
The fact is, that, except as to the head and face, the dress of a
fashionable lady accomplishes precisely the same object essentially as
that of a nun; it conceals those personal advantages which are too apt
to attract notice; it wraps the wearer up, and averts particular atten-
tion from her; it acts as a screen, and its various colours are not even
so conspicuous as the conventual black and white. The writer in the
Record is evid-ntly almost as ignorant of fashion as he is of theology,
and ought equally to abstain from writing on either subject.
THE LAMENT OF THE LAMBETH ROSE-BUSH.
Oh, the roses of the Temple they b'oom so fresh and fair!
And the lime-trees of the Temple put forth spring shoots so green!
For the steam-boats that, in times gone by, used to pollute the air,
Have been forced to take to anthracite, so smokeless and so clean.
In the Gardens of the Temple the little children ramble
And roll about like kittens, on the sward in gamesome bands,
And never smear their little frocks, in infant romp and gambol,
Nor smut their little faces/nor soil their little hands.
In the chambers of the Temple, the dried-up lawyers even
May from their dusty windows their parchment faces show,
And without a dose of blacks may inhale the breath of Heaven,
And all because Lord Palmehston has willed it should be so.
Some day I shouldn't wonder, if to the Court's amazement,
Thanks to oxygen, from carbon superfluous set free,
Some old Q. C.'s tongue, a-dnst as the lime was 'neath his casement,
Should blossom into flowers of speech, as blossometh the tree.
But, alas for us poor roses, doomed to death in Lambeth garden,
Alas for flowers, and shrubs, and trees, that round us pining, pine,
The gard'ner can't produce a bloom, worth (he says) a single farden,
To grace the Archbishop's button-hole when he goes out to dine.
When smoke gets into boiling milk, "It's bishopped!" cries the cook-
maid:
While in Lambeth Palace Gardens a harder fate is ours,
For by smoke,—in spite of gard'ner's care, in spite of any book made
By Lindley, Paxton, Loudon,—we are "Archbishopped" flowers.
The potteries belch about us their chlorines, when they're 'salting,'
And ns children of sweet Flora, send, like their clay, to pot;
And what with making gas, boiling bones, and tallow melting,
A breath of genuine air's a thing that isn't to be got.
The little children round about are scrofulous and sallow;
Their play-ground is the kennel, or the river's banks of mud,
Where in filth and fcefor nurtured, like pigs in filth they wallow,
And, sickly human flowers, die, like us, nipped in the bud.
Oh, sure a time 13 coming when to Lambeth, like the Temple,
The law against smoke nuisance extended we shall see;
And then we Lambeth flowers, by the Temple flowers example,
Once again will bloom and blossom as in days that used to be.
And rosy Lambeth children shall play about our borders,
No longer clothed in sooty black, but once more jolly green;
And the gardener will exult, when by the Archbishop's orders,
At his grace of Cants top button-hole a home grown bouquet's seen.
Most Tremendous Feat.
Miss Eats Cooke has announced for her forthcoming benefit at
Astley's, that she will take aflging leap over a lady in full dress, and clear
the entire body without touching a single flounce. The distance,
measured from skirt to skirt, is calculated to exceed, by two or three
yards, that of the longest leap on record. There are wagers to a con-
siderable amount, both in sporting and equestrian circles, that the
daring young lady will not be able to accomplish the difficult feat.
She has been strongly advised by all her friends to abandon the fool-
hardy undertaking, and to jump over sixteen hoops, or half-a-dozen
elephants, or a Greenwich hotel-bill, or any other bulky object, instead!
SMOTHERED WITH ORDERS.
Triumph of .Verse.
Let Mr. Martin Farquh»r Tupper be crowned with poppies!
He has written a poem, called The Opium Trade. The beautiful effusion
is so true to its purpose that, ere reading three verses, Punch fell fast
asleep!
The Italian Scourge.—Italy, all agree, has the fatal gift of beauty.
Most Italian eyes are beautiful, but the dominions of King Bomba are
particularly famous for lashes.
Louis Napoleon's baby has received another Order,—the Order of
the Seraphim, bestowed by the King of Swedin. It is understood
that until further notice, no more orders can be admitted. Time must
be allowed for baby to grow before there is room upon it for another
decoration.

Judging from the American correspondence, we certainly agree with
Porlia in the sentiment that

UNEA.SY TRAVELLING MADE EASY.
A Drawing-room at St. James's is very like a railway:
—a lady may know when the Train that she travels with
starts, but she never can tell at what hour it will reach its
destination—much less what accidents the train may
encounter on the journey, or whether, indeed, it will ever
arrive safe at all. It would not he a bad plan to start an
"Insurance Company for all Drawing-room Tradts."
It might easily be done with a capital of £1,000,000, under
the "Limited Liability Act." Tickets, previous to start in l-
should be issued to ladies at a low rate—say five guineas
a-head, which is not much, considering there are frequent]y
ostrich feathers and jewellery in each head. These tickets
should guarantee the countesses and duchesses against all
loss or injury that their dresses might sustain during the
perilous journey. Gentlemen might also be taken in,
receiving compensation for any trifling damage that was
inflicted on their silk stockings, cocked hats/or shirt-frills.
Such an " Insurance Company would be a great boon to
the public (as prospectuses invariably say), filling up a
vacuum in many an injured pocket, besides relieving the
minds of innumerable dowagers and chaperons, who at
present start on the trip with the greatest nervousness and
fear of the consequences. We have heard an aged mar-
chioness say, "that she would sooner at any time cross

Look out, Mr. Crampton!
Mr. Peacock* would tell Lord Palmerston that, "if
he contemplated any scheme of reward for Mb. Crampton,

ing or waking, never forget the fact.) that, should Loss
Palmehston attempt to make him even governor of
Heligoland, or Lord-lieutenant of Herne Bay, Mr. Pea-
cocke will a tale unfold, and straightway bring down more

who Bigned petitions against Sunday music, how many J

"LET'S HAVE NO WORDS."
Mr. Wilkinson put no doubt a very sensible notice on the paper
when he proposed that except upon the introduction of a measure to
the House, no member do speak for more than half an hour at one time
upon the same question, nor upon any occasion for more than one bour!
It would indeed be a great thing to cut down the garrulity of the
Commons, and to stop the mouths of members by effectually causing
them to shut up at a reasonable hour, but we are afraid that this early
closing movement is not likely to succeed. There are certain indi-
viduals in parliament who will have their say, and who would find a
method, of eluding any rule, however stringent, that the House might
lay down. If there were a standing order against speaking "more than
half an hour at one time upon the same question," the loquacious party
would take care to talk upon two subjects at once, ana thus gain an
entire hour, and all kinds of fictions would be resorted to by the M.P.
who might be determined to keep his tongue continually going. If
speaking uninterruptedly were not permitted beyond a certain limit,
he would probably introduce a snatch of singing, and thus claim the
privilege of starting again, on the ground that the speaking had only
lasted during the time prescribed. The " exception with which the
resolution of Mr, Wilkinson commences, would also open the door to
such an amount of evasion as would be sufficient to destroy the whole
effect of the rule; for " the introduction of a measure" could always be
arranged in some way or other, and it is not improbable that'a member
who had made up his mind to talk away for a whole evening, would
fulfil the requirements of the exception as to the " introduction of a
measure" by walking into the House with a pint pot in his hand.
The only remedy we can suggest for the garrulity which impedes all
the business of the session, is not to permit any legislative slow coach
to stop the way, but to have a large room set apart for talking, while
all the voting should be done in the House itself. Directly a member
began to make a speech, he should be walked gently towards the door
by the proper officer, and turned in among the orators, who might be
allowed to talk all at once, while the real business of the country could
be carried on by the working members. The talkers being thrown
together would be reduced to the necessity of talking each other down,
and the evil would thus cure itself. We object to the proposal to
allow half-hour speeches, which would be quite as bad as those of
longer duration, for the session would be swamped just as completely
by a succession of droppings from a series of water-spouts, as by the
uninterrupted dribbling of one or two pumDS. For this reason, we
look upon the separate system as the only effective mode of bringing
about the silent system in the House of Commons. Talkers cannot
get on without listeners, and if all the loquacity of the legislature were
to be concentrated in one spot, the nuisance would be brought to an
end, for even the most inveterate speech-makers cannot go on without
an audience.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
R. Punch, with the
frankness which is
but one of the
thousand virtues
combining to form
that perfection
which he beholds
nowhere but in his
looking-glass.stated,
last week, that the
preceding Friday
evening had been
far too fine for him
to waste in London,
and that he had
gone down to Green-
wich. Even there,
however, his engage-
ments had not been
entirely irrespective
of the interests of
his readers, for he
ascertained, by per-
sonal inquiry, that
Ministers hail fixed
Saturday, the 19th,
for the whitebait
dinner which pre-
cedes prorogation. In his delight at this news he forgot how time passed, or
indeed how anything passed except certain decanters; but he has some recol-
lection, late in the evening, of being stumbled against by some Members of
Parliament, in white waistcoats, of whom he instantly demanded what had been
done in the Houses. Their replies seemed to him to be rather foolish. One said,
"Lords pass Divorshbill," another observed "Commons chaat Bishopnewzeal'd
out of salary," and a third endeavoured to explain to him what had been done
with the Partnership Amendment Bill, but got so inextricably involved in the
tangles of a word like "Limdlibility" that Mr. Punch was obliged to wait until
the morning, when he found that the Capitalists, who persevered in their hostility
to helping men of small means to unite them (though Ton Baring was very angry
with Palmerston for saying so) had succeeded in damaging the bill. They carried,
by a majority of 3, a clause providing that loans made on the principle of the
measure, namely, the sharing profits instead of taking fixed interest, should not
be recoverable till all other creditors were paid. This is a very crippling insertion,
and Mb. Muntz, who hates the Bill, exultingly declared that it was now worth
not one farthing. On the whole, Mr. Punch is glad that he went to Greenwich,
wherefgood manners prevailed, and no greedy Bakings and.MuNTZES tried to keep
all the loaves and all the fishes.
July 7ih, Monday. The Lords, without going to division, coolly threw out the poor
Nabob op Surat's Bill. Mr. Punch would observe that his chief reason for
thinking that the Bill was just and righteous was that old Hogg, Chairman of
the East India Company, flew into such a fury against it, evidence which would
generally be sufficient to determine anybody which way to vote. But Lord
Ellenborough, who certainly is no friend to the Company, has examined into the
subject, and thinks that the matter was not a case for Parliament: ...
"And ao the Nabob
• Will not get a bob."
A pleasing quarrel has broken out between the Attorney-General for Ireland and
the Irish Master of the Bolls. Between them, James Sadleir, brother of the late
John Sadleir, and implicated, it seems, in his frauds, has had warning, and has
escaped from justice. The Attorney says in the House, that the irregular
remarks" of the Master gave Sadleir the hint, and the Master retorts from the
Bench, that the Government never intended to catch the man, who had given them
political support. A penny-a-liner would here infallibly earn' three halfpence by
remarking that "as our friend Sir Lucius CP Trigger says, in Sheridan's Rivals^ the
quarrel is a very pretty quarrel as it stands." The Tipperary people are furious,
for Sadleir has run away without vacating his seat, and the House seems in
no hurry to expel him. The absurd Medical Profession Bill was thrown over,
its patron declaring that to get it discussed now was a Task beyond Comtek.
The rest of the evening was occupied with the bill, from the Lords, for constituting
the new tribunal of Appellate Jurisdiction. Poor Babon Wensleydale came
down, and got a petition presented, asking the Commons to alter the bill, so as to
leave his rights untouched. Eight lawyers, and Sir James Graham and Lord
John Russell did the talking, the former layman pitching severely into the Lords
for their ridiculous way of hearing appeals, and also into the bill, which he thought
would debauch the bench and the bar, and Lord John denouncing the measure
as unconstitutional. The second reading was carried, but not by much of a
majority—191 to 142. and on its next stage, on the Thursday, after rather an
amusing debate (in which Mr. Raikes Currie made desperate efforts to emulate
the peculiar oratory of Mr. Henry Drummond), the Government was signally
defeated, and the bill shelved by 155 to 153. The Appeal to the Lords, therefore,
survives in all its costly absurdity. i
Tuesday. In the Lords the principal topic was the
Scutari monument, which Lord Harrington does not
like, and Lord Pasmure does, Drither circumstance being
of the slightest consequence, as Babon Marochetti has
got the commission to execute, and the enormous price for
the job has been voted.
! In the Commons the Public Health Bill was rejected
: by 73 to 61, and a good deal of abuse was lavished upon
the Board of Health. Its chief, Mb. Cowfeb, plaintively
said that "its only desire was to do some work (laughter)
I for tbe benefit of the public." He has bad to ask that its
life may be continued for a year. The Queen has issued a
commission for inquiry into the question, what Bite shall
be selected for the new National Gallery. Two questions,
one regarding the alleged ill-treatment of certain naval
officers, and tbe other that of certain military officers,
were then brought on, with different fates, yet with equal
inutility; for the first was rejected by 38 to 31, and the
House was counted out upon the second, Rosati appear-
ing at Her Majesty's Theatre in a splendid new ballet.
Wednesday. The subject of examination for' the Civil
Service was brought up, and Lord Godebich stated that
at preterit the examinations caused the rejection of one
Candidate in three, and therefore he thought the system
could not be pushed farther. He said, fairly enough, that
for tide-waiters and letter-carriers, no high literary standard
ought to be proposed, but we think that from Under-
Secretaries of State a little more should be expected. For
instance, Lord Shelburnb (who has just been raised to
office, and to the peerage, because he is the son of the
excellent Mabquis of Lansdowne), should not write to
his constituents that he is "unable to resist the oppor-
tunity of endeavouring," &c. We resist importunities, we
forego opportunities, Lord Siielhubne. The examination
question, therefore, is to remain where it was. Tbe Irish
Tenant Right Bill was thrown over, having quite answered
its purpose, namely, that of providing its promoters with
some clap-trap for their constituents.
Thursday. Lord Campbell elicited a sort of promise
from the Government that during the recess a bill should
be prepared for including strychnine and some other poisons
in the law that very sensibly prevents arsenic from being
carelessly sold. As such a bill could be drawn in ten
minutes, and passed through both Houses before the pro-
rogation, we should like to know why the people are to be
left for six months at the mercy of the boys behind the
druggists' counters. The bill for improving the Dwellings
of the Irish peasantry passed, and a bill was introduced for
enabling the Bishops of London and Durham to resign,
and—for resignation is a Christian virtue which ought to be
rewarded—for having provision made for them. Mr. Punch
concurs in this arrangement, for it is impossible that either
prelate can have saved money. The annual income of
Dr. Blomfield is £10,000, and he has enjoyed it for
twenty-eight years, having previously had four vears of
Chester with £1,000 a-year, total receipt, £284,000; and
the annual income of Dr. Maltby is £24,000, and he has
enjoved it for twenty years, having previously had five years
of Chichester with £4,000 a-year, total receipt, £500,000,
according to the mere regulated diocesan emolument,
which the wicked suppose to be marvellously below the real
receipts. It is a marvel that the two poor old gentlemen
are not obliged to go, like noble Colonel Nbwcome, upon
some foundation, wear gowns, and say Adsum. At any rate,
if they have colds in their episcopal heads when they get
their provision, they all say adsum is as adsum does.
In the Commons various Innocents were Murdered.
The Vaccination Bill, the bill for giving the Burial Act
administration to the Board of Health, the bill for reform-
ing Doctors' Commons, and, as aforesaid, the Lords' Appeal
Bill, all dying the death. No particular epitaph is needed
for them. Perhaps Mr. Punch may say that the people
who opposed the Doctors' Commons reform are bold. The
terms of compensation proposed to them were abominably
lavish, and if such an accident as a Reform Ministry should
occur before tbe bargain is renewed, the whole nuisance
will be swept away with about as much compensation as is
awarded to a mass of black beetles, when shaken out of the
trap into hot water.
Friday. More complaints against the East India Com-
pany occupied (the Lords, after which Lord Lyndhurst
made a spirited appeal on behalf of Poland. Lord Cla-
rendon said that the Emperor of Russia was such a
kind and generous man that the Poles had better trust to

In the Commons, the Hero of Kars took his seat for Calne, amid hearty cheering. A
d sperate row upon the Sadlelb question raised on Tuesday, made the evening pass pleasantly

A PBINCE OF DIAMONDS! ,
Pbince Estebhazy proposes to come out in a
blaze at the Russian Coronation: his dress is to
shine like the firmament wilh diamonds. We
learn that the buttons of the "dollman"—the
dollman, it seem?, is the jacket hanging [over
the shoulder; though »e should rather translate
it man-doll or doll of a man—are all diamonds
of the finest Hungnry water, and the clasp of
the heron-plume alone worth £30,000. We have
heard, in very mixed i*ociety, various opinions
of the uses of au Esterhazy so bejewelled.
"What a treasure he'd be," said a meek gentle-
woman to her gossip and friend, "what a
treasure he'd be if only shared among poor
widows and orphans!" "Shouldn't jou like,
Bill, to toss him an hour in a blanket for the
chance of what he'd leave behind himP" "Veil,
I declare," said Mr. Lazakds, of Hounds-
ditch, to Mb, Abkdnego, of the Minories,
both much given to the sur'onfication of sove-
reigns; "Veil, it ve only had the shakin on him
in a bag, it shouldu't he our fault if artcr that,
the mother that bored him knowed him."

(To be played in an Omnibus.)
It asked to go outside "to oblige a Lady,"
plead as an excuse that jou would, but you dare
not, for "you only recovered from the Typhus
yesterday," and instantly there will be room for
the Lady, as every gentleman present will, all of
a sudden, be only too glad to go outside.
"QUIETNESS."
"Men are but children of a larger growth," says the bard. Children,
the truant libertines of garden or orchard, will cram of all fruits within
their power of picking; then comes sickness, then physic,—and then,
it may be, restored health, and will renewed to cram and be ill again.
Men take their fruit fermented, and, being fuddled and fractious, what
are they but mischievous, roaring babies, whom for quiet-sake and the
repose of the household, it is absolutely necessary to silence and send
to bed? If in the case of the bigger baby, the child of five feet eight or
ten, the bed is made in a grave, well the sickness is cured past all
return, and the child of larger growth [is never noisy, never naughty,
again.
A paternal Government, no doubt for] a wise purpose of its own, to
be at some time made manifest to a people at present in darkness,
permits the anxious mother to physic, at the peril of her own know-
ledge, her invalid, or ill-tempered babies. The syrup is sanctified by a
stamp, and the Chancelloe op the Exchequeb, with both instinctive
hands in his pockets, smiles as the hardy parent uncorks the precious
stuff, and pours a full conscientious dose into baby's mouth. Soon the
roaring baby holds its peace: its little head, like head of poppy, full of
oblivion. In this way mothers, time out of mind, have been allowed
by the remunerated state to put their little ones to Buch vitreous
wet-nurses; the Milk of Lethe, Cherub's Cordial, and such.sweet-named
nourishers.
And now wives have taken the bigger children iin hand, and—the
custom, it seems, is common as camomile in Bolton—and physic their
husbands. Mas. Betsy M'Mullen has, no doubt, accidentally
"accelerated the death " of her spouse, by pinching him onward with
certain doses of tartarised antimony and cream of tartar. It would
seem that tipsy husbands abounded in Bolton, and in their hours of
liquor they were, if they only knew it, much beholden to their wives,
who, purchasing at once their diplomas and their medicine for a penny,
are apt to administer the aforesaid antimony to their inebriated halves,
even as they give Government anodyne to their restless children.
The conjugal powders are called, in the town of Bolton, "quietners."
In the case of poor Me. M'Mullen they have been proved worthy of
their name. These "quietners" are sold at one penny each; commonly,
openly, as salts or rhubarb. "I do not remember," deposed Ma. J.
Rowland Simpson, druggist, of Bolton, "that men ever purchased
them." Husbands are so timid. Wives, however, were constant
customers; although they were rarely permitted to carry away a single
"quietner" without at the same time carrying with them, if they so
needed, the conscientious counsel of Mr. Simpson, who would warn
them "to be careful of it, and to divide each powder into four
doses."
It was deposed by a servant that Mbs, M'Mullen—when she thought
her husband the worse or the better for liquors-would give
"pinches" of this white powder. Shakspeare speaks of
"A lover'a pinch, that hurts and yet's desired."
It must be otherwise with the pinch conjugal; especially when the
Tartarised partner of a bosom pinches tartarised antimony and cream
of tartar, with Tartarus ending all. As, however, Mbs. M'Mullbn is
in bonds, awaiting an inquiry, to be conducted and presided over by
robe and horse-hair, we touch our hat, and leave her to the issue.
We have only to suggest to the Government that, henceforth,
druggists dealing in poisons—vending the means of mortality in penny
packets—should be compelled to put out an external sign of their
interior traffic. For instance: as, for the most part, druggists have a
bright ruby-coloured lamp over their doors, we would have quartered
in the red field a skull and cross-bones proper. This would give fair
notice to all purchasers. Even as the gilt bunch of grapes over the
publican's door avouches him licensed to sell his penn'orths of oblivion,
so would the death's-head mutely declare that cheap poisons were to be
had within; moreover, dumbly warning the drunkard of "quietners"
and the grave.
Philosophical Reflection on a Cabstan
Bepoee entering into a cab, numbers of cabmen will surround you
and almost fight for the honour of your company; but when you leave
it, not a soul takes any notice of you, and you may consider yourself
lucky, if the fellow you have been patronising does not turn round and
abuse you! And so it is the same with friends. They will nock round
you when first you enter into a fortune; but how many are there at
your side when once you have gone through ifcF
LITTLE ANGELS.
The order of the Seraphim was almost as good an order as could
have been bestowed on little Louis Napol&on. There is only one that
would have been more appropriate; the order of the Cherubim: since
plenty of other children have been invested with that order in being
commonly described as tombstone cherubs.
Medicine and Attendance Bill.
The Medical Bill is thrown over for the present; and, as it proposed
to inflict a registration-fine upon all practitioners, without procuring
them any equivaleut advantage, we should sny that its abandonment is
a good job tor the profession. The only Medical Bill likely to do the
doctors much good is that little Bill which, we trust, they will get
settled I' ;v them all at Christmas.

EDUCATION.
ow that the "little
dears" of domestic life
are home for the holi-
days, the cheap school-
maaters are baiting their
honks, and throwing out
their lines, in the form
(if advertisements calcu-
lated to catch the eyeB of
poor parents <nr grasping
guardians. We nave now
almost daily an entire
column of the Times de-
voted to the announce-
ments of "Homes for
Little Boys," "Colleges
for|Youug Ladies," "In-
clusive Terms," "Pa-
rental Treatment," and
other advantages, at
prices ranging from six-
teen to sixty guineas
per annum. As some of
our leaders may be look-
ing out for a "good
school," and as there may
be a tew who think no
school so good for a child
as the "school of adver-
sity," we place before
the public a selection,
from which a choice may be made by those who are'anxious to get a young idea taugiit how
to shoot, without any very serious expenditure in shot or powder. To those who are anxious
to bring up a child cheaply, or rather to cut him down to the very lowest flgure, we think we
may safely recommend the following:—
EDUCATION.—For £18 per annum, YOTJNG GENTLEMEN are BOARDED, Clothed,
and Educated. The situation healthy. In the country. This advertisement is worthy the attention of persons
in want of a good school. Unexceptional references given.
As we presume the board will be ample, we may be justi6ed in estimating its very
lowest cost at Is. per day, which, for a year of forty weeks (allowing twelve for vacations)
will amount to £14; ana taking the education at id. per week (the price of mere manners
at the cheapest semrnaT with which we are acquainted), and the same sum for washing,
we have a residue of £3 6s. 8d. a-year for clothing each young gen' leman. There must
be something rather diminutive in the wardrobe to be had for this primaeval price, and we
should say the costume would not be quite as modest as the outlay.
The next advertisement is a curiosity, even amoDg tcholastic announcements:—
_ a good voice and taste for music (whether cultivated or
», for'half the terms, In a first-class school. Gonteel parentage Indispensable.
This seems to offer an eligible opportunity to a family having among its members a " regular
screamer" of the female sex, and anxious to get ria of the nuisance. Why a young lady
with a voice, "cultivated or not," should be accepted at half-price in a first-class school is a
marvel to us: nor do we see how "genteel parentage" can mitigate the horrible effect
of having a female Sientor in one's family. Aristocracy of birth seems a stiange kind of
compensation for plebeian lungs, and as far as our own taste is concerned, we should not
consider patrician parentage a counterpoise to the voice of a coalheaver.
There is something bold and original in the following, which to that numerous class of
pupils who look on books as a bore, and who indeed had rather not look at them at all,
will prove a boon of no ordinary nature:—
"EDUCATION, chiefly without Books.—A gentleman, whose experience has convinced him
i that the usual routine pursued in schools is very objectionable to the pupil, guarantees to parents to advance
their sons on a system sound and expeditious, at the same time most pleasing and easy. The situation is very
healthy.
This idea seems to be taken from the practice of the late—but not by any means
lamented — Squeebs, who repudiated the Dook system, and proceeded on the sound,
expeditions, pleading, and easy system of setting a boy to spell horse in the best way he
could, and sending him to form an acquaintance witu his subject by rubbing the animal
down; so that a lesson was obtained at the same time in orthography and natural history.
We have not (pace for other specimens of scholastic advantages at ridiculous rates, but
we can assure our readers that the educational columns in the Times at this season of the
year will well repay perusal. We must not omit to do justice to the simple-mindedness of a
certain "principal" of a two-and-twenty guinea concern, who announces that "floricultural
grounds are fitted up for the recreation of the pupils." Considering the effect which the
"recreation" of exuberant boyhood would probably produce on a "floricultural" arrange-
ment, we cannot help comparing the fitting up of a flower-garden as a playground for boys
to the preparation of a cbina shop for the anticj of a mad bull, or the carelul collection of a
brood of chickens for the express gratification of the Terpsichorean propensities of a dancing
donkey.
The Lathes' Oracle.—We move as an amendment, that, m consequence of the egregious
absurdity of the Ladies' Fashions, Le Follet change its name for the future to the more
appropriate designation of "La Folie," or " The Female Folly."

THE PET OF THE BRITISH JURY.
To Trial by Jury Britons owe
The happiness of being free;
'Tis called, because the fact is so,
Palladium of our liberty.
A iiiry is the wisest plan,
Whenever folks each other sue,
That ever was devised by man
For rendering onto .all their due.
A British Jnrv knows no fear,
No favour does it e'er display
To Rank and Wealth, to Prince or Peer,
Who try twelve upright souls to sway;
Impartial both to rich and poor,
To neither class disposed to bend,
The British Jury, evermore.
Is found the British Tradesman's friend.
When for his bill—however large—
An action he's compelled to bring,
If British Jurors dock his charge,
Oh, how extremely rare a thing!
From an f xoensive minor's sire,
Or an indebted lady's mate,
Of any sum he may require
How seldom will they aught abate!
Should any aged trifler break
His infant daughter's tender heart
By breach of promise—don't they make
The toothless old deceiver smart!
The Juryman and Father feels
The Tradesman's and the Father's pain,
The British Tradesman ne'er appeals
To British Jurymen in vain.
The other day a case occurred
Whereof the justice all must own,
The Times contained a tale absurd
How tbat a tailor—name unknown—
An army clothier's agent, not
Denoted even hy a dash,
Had out in the Crimea got
Scored by the Provost Marshal's lash.
Although this story was a myth,
To common vision very dim,
There was a certain tailor Smith,
And his friends fixed it upon him;
An action 'gainst the Times he brought
Upon these solid serious grounds,
A British Jury gave him nought
Less than just full four hundred pounds.
Nine injured^British Tailors, they
Did, sure, in tbat one Tradesman see,
And so condemned the Times to pay
For damxpe done to three times three;
Then sing, Nine tailors make a man,
And in a box there were twelve geese:
So of four hundred pounds we can
Make forty-four pounds odd a-piece.
Little Facts worth Knowing.
Wns a man has a very red face, it never, by any chance,
arises from drink.
He who arrives late at a dinner-party, after the company
Is seated down to table, generally escapes from the bother
of carving.
Old ideas, like old elothes, put carefully away, come out
again after a time almost as good as new.
The first bottle is always ''too dry," or "too strong,"
or " too thin," or else it " wants axe," or " body," or " keep-
ing," and it is only right tbat there should be somethiug
wanting in the first bottle, or else there never would be any
improvement in the second.
Talk Scotch to a beggar, and he will soon leave you.
Always accept a seat in the carriage of the lady who has
eaten no dinner, for the chances are that, as she has touched
since luncheon, there Is a good aupper waiting for

, OLD FRIENDS WITH OLDER FACES.
It may be rather ungracious to abuse the
bridge that sometimes carries us over, but our
patience has been sorely tried by the rickety
old pile of masonry and carpenters' work that
traverses the Thames at Westminster. An
inspection of the works in progress has intro-
duced us to two individuals, whose ccuutenances
we thought we recognised. One was regularly
ploughed up with the furrows of age, while the
face of the other was not by any means out of
those indentures which seemed to show an
apprenticeship to life and its sorrows. The
couple were calmly and deliberately assisting
each other to do nothing, and we felt sure we
were looking upon a pair of old familiar faces,
which were identified with some old familiar
foolery. They turned on the gas of memory
into the dark corners of our mind, in which we
keep stowed away the shadows of the past. We
at once recognised the forms before us as those
of the "man and boy," who will go down to
immortalitv in connection with the Nelson
column.' We speedily perceived the cause of
the unsatisfactory amount, of progress in the
works we were gazing at, and we can form some
conception of when they will be finished by
stating the question thus—as the Man and the
Boy were to the Neltou's Column, so are the
Boy and the Man to the new bridge at
Westminster.
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.
Master of the House. "Oh, Feed, mt Boy—when Dinner

IS READY, YOU TAKE
A Sweet Sentiment.
There are refined kinds of sentiment as there
are of sugar; Man, for instance, takes his in the
lump-yhard, though easily melted with a tear;
but with a woman, it is always moist.
THE RETURN OF THE GUARDS.
Gallantly they marched, in the dank grey dawn of morning,
Of that, sullen, sad March morning—'tis two years now and more—
Our Guardsmen, summoned suddenly, with scanty word of warning,
From the pleasures and parade of peace to savage work of war.
What thoughts were theirs while passing scenes of pastime, haunts of
leisure,
Under closely-shuttered windows, through thoroughfares all dumb,
With that stern, solid tread of theirs, to the soul-stirring measure,
Where the screaming of the fife weds the rolling of the drum.
There were high-born there and low-bom, stripling subalterns, yet tender,
To Park and Club and Opera, bidding a long adieu,
Exchanging/f?7e and ball-room, mirth, music, grace, and splendour,
For the trenches and the tent, trumpet-call and drum-tatoo.
There were privates, lower pleasures and humbler joys forswearing,
Chat in canteen and beershop, social glass and merry song,
Or home sorrows and home sunshine, more prized because so sparing,
And all the dearer now they 're lett—none knoweth for how long!
'Twas so long since those proud colours had served for higher uses,
Than to grace the Palace pageant, or the Birthday Park review,
And many feared lest pleasures of the town and their abuses,
Had made those arms less stalwart, had left those hearts less true.
The summer went: the autumn came: with eager ears we listened
To the tidings that flowed frequent from the far-off scene of fight;
How manly voices trembled, how womanly eyes glistened,
As we read, at last, how the gallant Guards cleared Alma's gun-
crowned height!
Then winter came: in grief we learnt how they lay in their strong leaguer,
At war with mightier opposites than stubborn Russian foes,
How to plague and frost and famine, hunger-bitten, naked, meagre,
They were giving lives, ungladdened by the glory of their close..
All remember how from grief and from rage at that sad story,
The heart of England leapt into triumph once again;
As we read the tale of Inkermann, the bulletin of glory,
Of the field that those brave bearskins held so stoutly, one to ten!
Still following their fortunes, we heard of murd'rous sallies
Fronted and foiled, night after night, in the trenches, hand to hand,
'Till through the realm of England, from the oottage to the palace,
All bent in prayer for those stout hearts that so the trenches manned.
And then came rumour of repulse; but who of us believed it?
Too well-we felt that, come what might, our soldiers must be true;
And when the great town sunk in flames, with calmness we received it,
As but an end we looked for—not their triumph, but their due. 4
At length our Guards come back to us: our streets to grace their entry,
Fill with such festive gladness, as our dull streets seldom show,
From the Queen, set at her balcony, through window-clustered gentry,
To the workers thickly lining the footways, row on row.
They are coming! to those old sweet tunes that quicken hardest natures,
"Auld Lang Syne" and "Home, S ffeetHome" marching merrily along;
Weather-stained coats and war-worn arms, and battle-bronzed features,
Catching glances, changing greetings with friends amidst the throng.
Hark! the Drums, that beat at Alma, so loud and so unquav'ring—
See! the flags that waved.shot-tattered agaiustlnkermanu's grey sky—
The eyes, that looked death in the face, month after month, unwav'ring,
The feet that moved but forward—that only paused to die !J
How many a humble heart in those close-packed crowds is swelling,
As rank on rank moves by them, but his face is wanting there! _
What a knell that music sends into many a stately dwelling,
Recalling loved and lost ones, who this triumph may not share!
For few among the thousands, who saw that March-dawn peeping,
Lift in this July sunshine their firelocks laurel-crowued;
Under Scutari's dark cypresses a quiet sleep they 're sleeping,
Or on Crirrean hill-sides, swell a nameless grassy mound.
So common joys of high and low, no less than common sorrows,
All London's mighty multitude to kindly concord sway,
Till grief takes calm from gladness, joy from woe a chastening borrows,
And all hearts own a solemn mood, that fits this solemn day.
God bless the gallant bearskins! Still in her time of danger,
May England reckon sons as true, as these her sons have been,
So from hand-grasp of the spoiler, and from foot-print of the stranger,
Still shall her hearths be sacred, and guarded still her Queen!

he advertisements in the

of the season, as will be
found from the follow-

mering the object of his atten-
tion, will RECEIVE into her

dress, apply ■
A physician who has for
years made stammering
his study may be all natural enough, but why his lady should be seized
with a desire to receive little girls of the Upper Classes is a puzzle
we will not attempt to grapple with. We must presume there is a
supposed affinity between stammering and aristocracy, and that
every little girl of the upper class has a hesitation in her speech,
which renders her eligible for introduction into a family whose head
has devoted his life to the sure of stuttering. The "drawl" used
to be looked on as a characteristic of nobility, and an individual who
brought out his words by slow instalments was formerly regarded as
the pink of fashion; but we never heard tbat stammering was accepted
as a sign of noble birth, or admitted as a passport into the best
society. We are, however, learning something every day, and even the
dog-days are not without their lesson.

A HERO CANED.
Canes continue to be poured in upon Brooks, who in the
words of certain of the donors "put the senator from Massachusetts
where he should be;" knocking Mr. Sumner down with a precision
worthy of the best footpad in the worst times. For our part, we think
Brooks cannot be too much caned. Nevertheless, with a modesty
certainly unknown to Blueskin, he receives every new cane with a new
effusion of modesty. He knocked down an unarmed man by stealth,
and blushes, and well he may, to find it fame. Thus, he says to the
men of Charleston, "1 accept the Palmetto cane as an evidence of the
generosity of my friends in Charleston, and not for any merit of my
own." Jack Sneppard might have envied such diffidence. We have
heard that when all the canes are duly presented to the hero of the
bludgeon, it is intended to solicit Brooks to sit for his fuil-lengtb,
when he will be painted grasping all the sticks, even as Chatterton,
the marvellous boy, paints, death—
"Ten bloody arrows in his straining fist I"
We have further heard that, to vary the cfferingof sticks, a testimonial
garrotte, manufactured from the iron of a nigger's chain, beautifully
polished, and preciously mounted, will also be presented to Mb.
Brooks. The testimonial will be in every way worthy of the man;
worthy of the act that has so endeared him to the heroes of the South.
FASHIONS IN PARIS.
SATURDAY AFTERNOON FOR EVERYBODY.
At a meeting of the Early Closing Association—which is a society
for protracting the close of human life by procuring the early closure of
shops—on Friday last, the establishment of a Saturday half-holiday was
strongly advocated, especially by Lord Stanley, who never rises to
speak without talking very muoh like a rising statesman. Anybody
who doubts that the adoption of a half holiday on Saturdays would be
as advantageous to the employer as to the employed, should read what
Lord Stanley had to say on that behalf. Though averse to doing
things in general by halves, we think the Saturday half-holiday a thing
entirely desirable, notwithstanding that, by superficial buffoons, it may
perhaps be represented as a. half measure. The early payment of wages
is necessary to the attainment of this desirable object; but workmen
must be paid sooner or later, and as the half-holiday will be beneficial
to the masters on the whole, they might as well pay the
A LADY'S LETTER WITH NO POSTSCRIPT.
It_ is hard to find our 'admiration thrown away. We admired
the indignation, for we thought it simply noble, of the Princess
Clementine, when we heard that Her Royal Highness had cast back
in the imperial teeth of Louis Napoleon the offered sum of something
like £8,000 per annum from her property.tconflscated with that of
her brothers' by the imperial will: now Her Royal Highness is too
thrifty—too like her well-beloved father—to do anything of the sort.
She asked for justice: she demands it still." That is, she requires all
her property; but, in the meantime, she does not refuse to take the
present offer, by way of instalment. The lady has plenty of ready
indignation, but for that reason does not refuse ready money. Were
such her intention she would doubtless have written a postscript.
Now there is no postscript: and, as a gentleman Louis Napoleon
will of course send the 500,000f. rente.
Our Paris Correspondent writes to inform us that the fashions this
year in that gay capital are distinguished by three different character-
istics:—1st, The amount of paint; 2, the extreme smallness of the
bonnet; and 3rd, the extreme largeness of the dress. The paint is laid
on the face; an English clown, he says, could not well lay it on
thicker. The background is a French white, and this is touched up
with little dabs of rose, black, blue, brown, and other colours, according
to the various positions they have physiognomically to occupy. He
states that, out of compliment to these fair painters, a new serial is on
the eve of publication, to be called, as a female companion to a work
that had a great success a few years back, Les Francoises peintes par
elles-nemes. The bonnet gets smaller and smaller as the dress looms
bigger and bigger. Our Correspondent imagines that the diminutive
size of the one is influenced by the growing expansion of the other[;
and it is his lit m belief that by the time the bonnet has dwindled down
to the tiny dimensions of a lady's watch, the dress will have swollen
out to the bulky capaciousness of one of Edgington's tents. The
former will be almost invisible, whilst the latter will be highly service-
able to mothers in a thunderstorm, as not less than a good round dozen
of children will be able to take shelter under it.
QUESTIONS FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE.
The Chancellor op the Exchequer says that the "system of
competitive literary examination" is "wholly unsuited" to the sub-
ordinate class of civil servants employed "in the Customs, the Coast,
the Excise, and the Post Office." However, one would think that a
public servant employed in the Customs, if he is really to be a civil
one, ought to know something of Manners and Customs, especially of
manners. Tide-waiters might be required to get up the theory of tides;
Excisemen to have hydrostatics and chemistry at their fingers' ends; ,
and letter-carriers to possess an extensive knowledge of letters—if the
cram system, which education at present principally consists in, is
calculated to develope practical talent, and may not be with accuracy
compared to pumping carbonic acid gas into bottles of soda-water.
A question intimately connected with the foregoing is, whether, in
the existing state of things, it is not desirable that every common
infmruer should at least be imbued with common information?
Bargains.
"Man (says Dr. Adah Smith) is an animal who bargains;" and,
judging from the number of "Fearful Failures" and shops that are
always "Selling Off under Prime Cost," we should say that both man
and woman carried their love of Bargains often to a most ruinous
extent.
the law op storms.
The man, who, when there is a domestic storm, steps in between
man and wife, is as bad as he who, when it's raining violently, walks
between two dripping umbrellas, for he gets protected neither by the
one nor the other, but on the contrary catches it from both sides.
How to make Home Healthy.
The air of the seaside is above all things good for ventilating London
and all metropolitan homes. Many a house, that, from various breezes
and innumerable domestic storms, had grown close and oppressive to
the persons living in it, has become pure, healthy, and sweet again
from having a good draught of sea-air blown through it! Every house-
hold should regularly once a-year take its troubles down to the seaside,
and plunge them boldly, as if they were a big bundle of rubbish, into
the Sea; and then, with lightened consciences, and clean hands, the
family returns to town, the better prepared to grapple with the troubles
of another year.—The Family Doctor.
A Game that Doesn't Pay.—Unhappy the husband whose wife

pookets the winnings, and the poor husband who generally has to
pay for the losses.

A WASHING TAKEN JUST IK TIME.
It will probably have been forgotten—and the reader is therefore
reminded—that not long ago, soon after the commission of a murder by
a madman, Mr. Punch called the attention of all patties concerned, that
is of_ everybody, to tbe advisableness of shutting up every person
showing decided symptoms of insanity. Mr. Punch supposed the case
of an unfortunate man—say a barrister—taking it into his head that a
benevolent and wealthy lady had encouraged his addresses, and, under
that delusion, persisting in persecuting her with them. This indi-
vidual was supposed by Mr. Punch to be continually figuring in police-
courts by reason of his behaviour towards that young lady, and of other
frantic conduct. Mr. Punch pointed out that, though this person
might be considered by some sages to be only mad north-north-west, it
was quite possible that his madness might shift to south-south-east;
that were he, at the time then being, to destroy anybody's life, he
would, if tried for murder, be acquitted on the ground of insanity; in
short, that such a lunatic, like every lunatic, was a dangerous lunatic,
and ought not to be suffered to go about.
Not the slightest notice was taken, at the time, of the warning
suggested by Mr. Punch.
But, according to a police-report, published on Friday last,
"At the Bow Street Police Office Richard Down, tbe person who has contrived for
many years to maintain a public notoriety by the systematic pernecutlon of ladies of
wealth or family dlbtlnctlon (of whom Miss Bordbtt Coutts has been the principal
victim hitherto), was brought before Mb. Henrt yesterday afternoon, upon tbe
authority of an order previously issued by his worship, directing an inquiry into the
defendant's state of mind."
Mb. Dunn had been writing more letters to ladies. Fortunately the
ladies in question were the Duchess of Cambridge and the Princess
Mast. The letters were handed over to the Commissioners of Police,
who communicated with the Home Secretary, and the result was
the appearance of Mb. Dunn at Bow Street as a lunatic at large, and
an order by Mb. Henbt that he should be placed under restraint.
How far that order was justified will perhaps appear from the
following statement made, amongst others, by Mr. Dunn to Dfi.
Sutherland :—
"That he had written to Loud Palkfiutoh to complain that he oonld not walk the
streets without being watched, and that if his annoyance were not put a stop to, he
would pnt a case of pistols in his pocket, and Bhoot the first person he met who was
watching him."
Thus it will be seen that the mind of Mb. Dunn, the barrister, had
veered very considerably from north-north-west; had got at least as
far as south-east, and might soon have arrived at south-south-east, as
in the parallel case supposed by Mr. Punch. Another time, when Mr.
Punch takes the trouble, and goes out of his way to give Society a
serious warning, he hopes it will be taken at once, so that a truth
apparent to him from insight and study may not have to be taught to
others by sad experience.
OFFICIAL ARITHMETIC.
We should like to know the sort of arithmetical examination that
submitted to by the official who prepared the return on which the
following paragraph is founded.
"Coumtt Courts.—A return, moved for by Mb. Wilsoh, M.P., shows that tbe
estimated charge upon tbe public funds to be entailed by the County Courts Bill, now
before Parliament, amounts to £170,000, of which £77,700 will be paid out of the Con-
solidated fund, and £140,000 out of parliamentary grants."
According to this precious document, it appears that tbe sum of
£170,000 when divided into two unequal portions, amounts to £217,700,
and accordingly tbe latter sum is required to pay the former. It is
true that the public pocket is happily well stocked, but nevertheless
we see no good reason why it should be subjected to the process of
paying some £17,000.'more than the sum that has to be provided for.
We should have thought that the blunder in the return was rather too
palpable to be allowed to pass; but having once gone forth it will no
doubt have to be referred back through the Circumlocution and other
offices before it can be rectified. It might appear to ordinary eyes that
the error is as manifest as if one and one were declared to make a total
of three; but official eyes have evidently failed to perceive that into
170,000 the larger figure 217,700 will not go, and that accordingly the
payment of the lesser Bum by the larger is a financial operation of a
rather costly character.
TOO MUCH LIGHT.
ue King of Prussia has bad a narrow
escape; and, we rejoice to find it,
although in great peril, passed through
the danger without a scratch. His
Majesty, as a monarch, and, of course,
the father of bis people, has always
legislated as though he feared tbe evil
that must arise from too much light.
"Children fear the dark," says
Landor, "men fear the light:" and
they have good reason for their
dread, as the late accident at Potsdam
may significantly illustrate. In a cer-
tain vUla there is a door openirg on
to algarden; which door consists of
one pane of glass, the present of the
Emperor Nicholas. Tuis glass is
without flaw or air-bubble—one entire
and perfect sheet of crystal, from tbe
Russian manufactory. The Kino of
Prussia, mistaking the glass for the
open door, walked into it, smashing it
to pieces; but, happily, in no way
damaging the Royal person. Now,
had the glass been flawed, or specked, or bubble-spotted, the very
defect would have warned His Majesty of bis whereabout. But there
no warning flaw—no conservative speck—and the transmitted light was
perfect and unbroken, and—what might have been a national calamity,
ensued. Is it not wise, then, in a paternal government to guard ana
protect its tender, short-sighted little ones from the danger of too
much light P
A Cheat of a Proverb.
We beg to state that the proverb "Lightly oome, lightly go," does
not apply to the gout, nor to one's mother-in-law, nor to the rheu-
matism, nor to freckles, nor to a light sovereign; for all these plagues
come lightly enough, and yet there is the greatest difficulty sometimes
in getting them to go.
No more Grey Hair!—Ask every person who tells you "how
grey you 're getting!" to pull out a grey hair, and you '11 soon have
none left.

intentions.

degree of blackness, on the hoardings and empty houses in

doubt that the notice we have taken of this subject will be
extremely gratifying to the pious individuals who are being
so pertinaciously placarded and puffed; for as they are
continually denouncing pride and all the mundane failings,
tbey should naturally be extremely averse to any course
that is only calculated to engender a vanity which it is their

PIOUS PUFFERY.
We have from time to time called the attention of the public to the system of
pious puffery which has been brought into existence by the demand for religious
excitement, and which has been extensively employed for the purpose of adver-
tising popular preachers, or pious periodicals. In what may be called low religions
neighbourhoods, the plan of bill-sticking has been very generally adopted with
the view of obtaining notoriety for certain names, and the walls appear to be divided
between the theatres and the chapels, the pet parsons and the popular comedians.
In one particular neighbourhood the broadsides proclaiming the attractions of the
conventicle are so blended with those inviting audiences to the playhouse, that it
is really difficult at first sight to distinguish one from the other; and a glance
is likely to create in our minds a confusion as to whether the Rev. C. Spurgeon
is to be seen " every night at half-price," or whether it is Mr. Wright or the
Rev. Something Binney that appears "during the week" in "A Bottle of
Smoke at the Adelphi." We are strong advocates for the I" Religion of Every-
day Life," in its legitimate sense, but we object very much to the introduction of
religious phraseology—which is a very different thing from religion itself—on all
occasions, and at all times, and in all places.
We fancy that we have rather subdued the speculators who must have disturbed
the tranquil humility of Dr. Cumming's mind by puffing him. iu order to sell his
books—lor there is rather less of that offensive sort of thing than there used to be,
but there is a class of preachers over the water who are being advert ised to an
extent that would bring a blush into the countenance of Professor Holloway,
or any other of those celebrities to whom columns have been raised on the
advertising sheet of every Newspaper. Now Mr. Spurgeon is becoming as
familiar to the readers of posting bills on the Surrey side of the Thames, as "Tom
Barry" the ex-clown at Astley's formerly used to be, and Binney in three
sermons seems to be taking the place once occupied by Ducrow on five horses
on .the dead walls of |the Metropolis. • Our gallant old favourite, N. T. Hicks, is
"BRADSHAW A MYSTERY."
"Mr. Punch,
"Among the millions who read and profit by yon,
the railway-traveller ought to be especially thankful, iour
exposition of Bradshaw was at once humane and masterly.
Nevertheless, you omitted to do justice to a great social
lesson at present illustrated in Bradshaw for July, 1856.
Take care of the pence, says the pocket proverb, and the
pounds will take care of themselves. In like manner I
would counsel the student of Bradshaw: take care of the
minutes, and he may find the hours all right. The
exceeding worth of ten minutes was emphatically taught
me on Sunday July 6.
"My destination, Mr. Punch, was Folkstone. What
said Bradshatc.1' I quote that print.— "July 6, Leave
London 8h. \0m. a.m." I particularly request you to
mark the " 10m." As a traveller, Mr. Punch, I am always
before my time. I am not one of the people who take a
i running leap from the pier to the packet when the paddles
are turning; I do not vault into a railway-carriage with
the whistle screaming departure. No, Sir! a clear, clean
ten minutes at least, I always allow for calm and needful
preparation. I never, Sir, was too late in my life but once;
and that was when my wife only bad to put her bonnet
on; an operation that has certainly increased in difficulty
as the bonnet itself has diminished in quantity. When
our wives have no bonnet at all to put on—ana they are
fast coming to it, skirts now swallowing everything;
indeed, so much so, that one's better half has become at
least four times one's double—when they have no bonnet
whatever, ithe time to put it on will be until the end of
time itself.
"However, to return to "Sunday, July 6, Leave London
8/5. ~10m. a.m." I took my seat at some four minutes to
eight. Very good. Before my time, as usual. The four
minutes passed; the whistle screamed, and the clock struck
eight as we flew to Folkstone, arriving at that ancient
borough in two hours and ten minutes; it must be
owned, a most satisfactory transit from the Thames to the
sad sea waves.
"Now, Sir, had I, with many a hopeful traveller arrived
at one, two, or three minutes past eight, believing in
Bradshatc's 8h. 10m., I had been left behind. Bradshatc,
who ought to be infallible—for consider the trust that
credulous mortals put in that podgiest and smallest of
quartos—Bradshatc said 8A. V)m. when the railway bill at
the station printed Sh. Simply eight hours, with not a
single supplemental minute.
Well, Sir, what moral does this present to the traveller
(especially when consulting Bradshaw) if not that of 'take
care of the minutes, and the hours will take care of them-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ULY 14. Monday-
Both Houses vouch-
safed attention to
Foreign Affairs.
Lord Lyndhurst
and Lord John
Russell wished to
know whether we
were going to have
any Italian irons in
the fire now lighting.
The former dis-
claimed the slightest
belief in the honest
intentions of Aus-
tria, and denounced
Bom ua with honour-
able indignation.
To him replied Cla-
rendon in certain
general phrases,
which announced
non-interference, but
which meant that
we must be guided
by circumstances.
Lord John Rus-
sell spoke up for Sardinia, and for a declaration to Austria that sbe should
no longer interfere in Italy. Palmerston could but answer as the Foreign
Minister had done: be expressed hopes that though Bomba had returned an
impertinent reply to the remonstrances of England, he migbt listen to lectures
from Russia and Anstria; and Pam added, that Sardinia would be assisted by
England and France against any unprovoked attack. Disraeli professed his
inability to comprehend the intentions of Government, but believed that they
intended to do nothing. Mr. Bowter, speaking for his constituent the Pope,
stated that Cardinal Antonelli had declared to the French and Austrian
Governments that he should soon be able to manage without foreign armies,
and Bowier abused the Sardinian Government, and especially Cavour, for allow-
ing attacks to be made on the Church. The crisis, of course, is most interesting.
It is the declared fear of the Manchester School that Sardinia will be encouraged
to get herself into the approaching fray, and then that Lord Palmerston means
to engage Eogland in the battle for Italian liberty. Mr. Punch wishes he could
think his friend the Bottleholder half so much in earnest.
The Lords did some damage to the Scatch Education Bill, (afterwards passed) by
striking out the clause abolishing the religious test for Schoolmasters. The
Commons did still more damage to the Partnership Bill, by inserting a clause' making
it necessary publicly to advertise loans made to a trader. The hatred of the great
capitalists to the small ones has been triumphant; they carried this proposal,
which destroys the whole object of the measure, by 108 to 103, and the Government
threw up a now useless bill. Mb. Low*, however, stated that the existing law
was not generally understood, and that all loans to a trader did not necessarily
create a partnership. The bill for the abolition of Gretna Green went througa
another stage. Why has not the blacksmith clamoured for compensation f
If the Black beetles of Doctors' Commons can claim it, surely the priest of
Hymen may.
Tuesday. The appointment of the Duke of Cambridge to the head of the Army,
in place of Lord Habdingb resigned, occasioned some complimentary tributes
to the latter, of whom Mr. Punch has always said that he was all bravery and
kindness, except 'when exposed to Court influences, and then he could neither snub
great people nor stand up for the interests of the Army. May many years of
happiness and honour await the gallant old hero of the Peninsula, Waterloo, and
the Sutlej. The Bishops' Bill then came on for second reading, and an edifying
debate ensued. Lord Redesdale opposed it, remarking severely upon Bishops
who promised to resign if provision were made for them, a bargain which he
unhesitatingly characterised as Simony. The Bishop of Exeter opposed it,
because he considered that a Bishop could not surrender his charge except to
an Archbishop, who had conferred it. Lord Derby opposed it, as violating
Church principles, and the Conservative leader contrasted the conduct of the
soldier, Hardinge, who at once resigned his office, on feeling that he was unfit
for it, with that of the priests, Blomfield and Maliby, who would not resign
until they had bargained for allowances. Soapy Sam took the same view. The
Archbishop of Canterbury supported the Bill, and stated that the Bishop of
London would have been a much richer man had he not been profusely charitable.
The second reading was carried by 17 to 35.
In the Commons, the First Lord of the Admiralty explained the new Government
plan for providing better Naval defences for the country. He proposes to enlarge
and improve the Coast Guard, from which we shall be able ou emergency to draw
from 5000 to 7000 of the best class of men, who will be trained to the duties of the
Queen's service. The plan met the approbation of the House, including that of
Mr. Punch. Lord Palmebston proposed that a holiday should be taken on
Wednesday, that the House might go to Aldershott at the public expense, and
see the Queen review the troops. He also explained that the Public was to
pay for lunch for the Members, and he only regretted
that their wives could not very well be taken down also.
Really this is rather too strong. Of course we do not
grudge a Member the price of a couple of return tickets
to the Camp, or a sandwich and bitter beer for himself,
or some cold fowl and Madeira for Lady Maria, but
the system of holidays whenever anything is going on is
growing upon the House. The Derby, Spithead, Alder-
shott, the Guards, the Fireworks, all offered an excuse
for neglecting duty. However, the arrangement was made,
and carried out, and Frederick Peel says that the bill
will not exceed £200. The Irish row about James Sadleir
came on again, and the Attorney-General for Ireland
showed that he himself was not to blame for letting
that delinquent escape, but the impression that his great
political friends do not regret that escape, is not exactly
obliterated. Mr. Oltveira made another laudable but
ineffectual attempt to get us cheap foreign wines, and
Mr. Punch would like to hear the sentiments of Mr.
Villiers, upon Mr. Olivjbiba's propositions.
Wednesday. Lord Palmerston, the new Knight of the
Garter, was, according to the Globe, beheld about the
middle of the day on horseback, at Aldershott, leading a
procession of ten omnibuses, crammed with Lords and
Commons, clamorous for lunch and the spectacle—panem
et Circenses. Decidedly Mr. Punch thinks that the whole
party ought to have been utterly ashamed of themselves,
especially the Premier and the Commons, who, instead
of hurrying off, like a lot of nurserymaids, to stare at the
soldiers, should have stayed in town, and discussed the
Divorce Bill, which Palmerston threw over on Thursday
on account of " the lateness of the Session."
Thursday. The Lords had another fight upon the
Bishops' Retirement Bill, against which the Bishop of
Exeter has protested very feebly, and the Bishop of
Bangor very vigorously, as will be seen in another of
Mr. Punch's pages. Lord Campbell applied to the
Bishop of Oxford the word "Brute," and declared
that the Bill was not Bimoniacal. Lord Shaftesbury
advised its being passed lest the Public, seeing that
dioceses could be left in charge of inefficient bishops,
should draw the conclusion that bishops were useless
articles. The Chancellor states, and Mr. Punch is only
too happy to give world-wide publicity to the fact, that
the Bishop of London bestows in charity £15,000 a-year.
The Bill passed through Committee.
In the Commons, on the Corrupt Practices at Elections
Bill, Mr. Henry Berkeley made a Ballot demonstration,
which came to nothing, but in the course of his speech he
introduced, by wholesale, charges of corruption against
various places, whose representatives rose and contradicted
him. Mb. Iite stood up for Bath, and Mr. Hebbebt
Ingram defended Boston, against which borough a person
calling himself "Colonel" Sleigh, who has somewhat
suddenly ceased to be acceptable at a Pall-Mall Club of
officers and gentlemen, brought a charge of which Sib
George Gbey significantly said "It might be true."
Friday. Lord Lucan has found out that the Chelsea
Board has let him down easy, so he is in a violent hurry
for the report, and abuses Mb. Villiers for delay. The
Lords could not help laughing, and Campbell mildly
rebuked the blundering Cavalryman. On the Scotch
Schools Bill, Lord Breadalbane came out with such a
good bit of English sense, as threw poor Lord Dungannon
into hysterics. "He hoped," said the Marquis, "that if
the clergy should persist in depriving the people of educa-
tion, by their differences on nice religious questions,
Parliament would pass some measure by which the inter-
ference of the clergy of any religious denomination in the
education of the people would be rendered impossible."
Lobd Bbeadalbane deserves better than to be a Lord
Chamberlain.
In the Commons it was announced that the Dulwich
College Bill is to be abandoned, so the Poor Players
have another opportunity of asking to share in the Rich
Player's bequest. Lobd Palmerston, on some questions
being asked, waxed wroth, and haughtily told the House
that ne would not be catechised, that the advisers of the
Crown were responsible for their acts, but would not take
the Commons into counsel about every small matter. The
salary of the new Minister of Education was fixed at
£2000 and the Civil Service Robbery and Oppression
Bill was withdrawn. Finally, the Leases of Settled Estates
Bill (better known as Tommy Wilson's Bill) csme on,

and Mr. Hadfield for once did good service by moving the insertion
of the well-known clause for saving Hampstead Heath from the brick-
layers. Some lawyers followed their instinct and took the unjust side,
but in vain, and Mr. Punch burst into an old Oxford ditty when he
heard the result of the division: 84 to 42.
"Tingle, tingle, tingle, went the Speaker's bell at nine,
Dinner called many members home,
But none of 'em ran
Till they'd smashed the plan
Of the fierce and artful Tom."

THE BRITISH PUBLIC IN THE PIG-MARKET.
What an inveterate propensity have nearly all companies, as well as
individuals, whose business it is to accommodate the public, to incom-
mode the public instead of accommodating it, and that by subjecting it
to inconvenience of the most offrnsive character! What brutal inat-
tention is recorded in the following paragraph—the conclusion of an
account of the late Review at Woolwich, in the Times:—
11 The railway arrangements on this occasion were execrable. Nothing could be
worse. The trains travelled at a snail's pace, and the exit from the station at Woolwich,
through which many hundreds of people had to pass, was a very small door, which,
being only half opened, afforded an aperture about a foot wide. Great was the dis-
satisfaction of the vast crowd, which, to the ruin of their clothes and the no small
injury of their ribs, had to squeeze their way through this narrow passage; but the
officer's reply to all remonstrances was, that if the door were fully opened, no one man
could collect the tickets. That is very possible, but surely the obvious remedy was to
have employed two collectors."
There is something in such usage of the public as this which is
literally beastly. To pen them up in a drove, and let them squeeze
their way out through a small aperture one at a time, was to treat
them exactly like pigs or sheep; creatures about which the only con-
cern was to count them off, with the mere view of making market of
them by the cheapest method. It is not the particular railway in
question that is alone chargeable with this disgusting incivility, which,
moreover, is not peculiar to railways. The same blackguardly spirit is
observable in the rude and inconvenient arrangements for admission,
and for what is called accommodation, which disgrace most of our
theatres and other places of entertainment. What is remarkable is,
that the miserable savings effected by the sordid economy which is at
the bottom of the churlish and hoggish contempt of public comfort,
displayed by managers and such like people, amount to a profit as
beggarly as the feeling which suggests that niegardly, mean, barbarous,
and insolent neglect. Whereas the opposite style of conduct—an
attentive and hospitable policy—is highly profitable: the handsome
line pays handsomely. But who can expect anything but discomfort and
brutality at a railway-station or a pit-entrance, when coarse discourtesy
impedes and embarrasses the access to the- Court itself, and peers and
peeresses, with their clothes torn off their backs, despoiled of their
stars, and divested of their garters, are let in, so many at a time,
through bars and gates, like cattle, to the presence of the Sovereign?
WHY THE CRAVENS LOST THEIE SUPPER.
When people advertise their proceedings, it is reasonable to suppose
that they do so in order to attract notice and to get themselves talked
about, and a benevolent disposition will endeavour, as far as is con-
sistent with propriety, to promote the wishes of persons thus putting
themselves forward. Mr. Punch recently observed in the papers an
"Advertisement," stating that at the entertainment given by the
Marquess op Westminster to the Queen, some people called Craven,
j were absent. There were three or four of them, Mr. Punch forgets
exactly how many, males and females, who it seems did not go, and the
fact was deemed of so much importance that it was notified in the
daily journals.
Now the Marquess gave a splendid party, and its profuse hospi-
talities are still talked about. The Cravens no doubt lost a good
thing. But why was the fact advertised to the world? Who are the
Cravens, that the world should be called upon to take notice that on a
particular evening they did not get a dance and some supper? If there
i3 a party in Great Coram Street, or Pinsbury Circus, and Mrs.
Bobbles, Mr. Frederick Bobbles, and Miss Malvina Bobbles are
prevented from attending, because the younger children have the
measles, or Malvina's godfather is laid up with the mumps, the
distressing circumstance is not set forth in print for the discomposure
of mankind. And what, to mankind in general, are the Cravens more
j than the Bobbleses? If the Cravens lost a pleasant party, Lord
I Westminster saved their suppers, and the affair, thus balanced, might
have been silently lefc to take its place in tie infinite chain of
causation.
i But Mr. Punch does not like lightly to accuse people of impertinently
intruding themselves on the world, and he would gladly find some
reason why we were bothered about the Cravens, and their misBing
the party at Lord Westminster's. Now it just occurs to Mr. Punch
that the name of a person called Craven came up the other day in
connection with a case of abominable cruelty to a poor horse. Next,
unless Mr. Punch mistakes, Lord Westminster is, much to his
credit, at the head of the humane Society which deals with such cases,
and which succeeded in inflicting a punishment (trumpery, indeed,
except for the exposure) in this Craven case. Now, if the Craven of
the horse case be one of the Cravens who did not go to the party, the
matter is more comprehensible. Is it possible that a very illustrious
Lady indeed had read in Her Punch and elsewhere, something about
that case? Is it conceivable that Her ideas upon the subject were
signified to Her intended hostess? Is it imaginable that an intimation
was conveyed to Craven of the horse-case that his presence was not
essential to the success of the fete? That his relations took sulk, and
stayed away too f That this produced the announcement in the
papers?
If so, although the exact wisdom of calling attention to a case which
sheds no particular lustre over the name of Craven, may be ques-
tionable, there was a reason for the announcement, and the Cravens
are removed from the category that would comprise the Bobbleses,
did they advertise that they were absent from the Great Coram Street
party. And this important inference Mr. Punch (who would assuredly
not have adverted to the subject but for the challenge given by the
advertisement) is happy to make manifest, for the delectation of a
universe, trembling with eagerness to know everything that is done by
the Cravens.
CONCEIVABLE COLLISIONS.

What would be the Patriot's prospect—what would be the Pontiff's
hope?

MORE SERVANT-QALISM.
i ervant-Galism has
lately reached anew
phase, and visiting
cards are now print-
ed for the use of the
"Young Ladies"
who condescend to
"accept office" as
cooks, nurses, and
housemaids in pur
domestic establish-
ments. We have
heard an instance
in which a servant
going into a new
place, has left cards
with all the small
tradesmen she may
deign to call upon,
and we have no doubt the Marine Store Dealer would be among the first to
receive, and lo acknowledge, the compliment. We only hope that if the fellow
has the audacity to retum the call at any respectable house, he will at once be given
into the custody of the police, which will be the best mode of introducing
him to his proper "station."

BISHOPS.
In the debate on the Bill for giving needful rest (witb
£6,000 a-year and Fulham Palace) to the Bishop of Lon-
don, the Earl op Shaftesbury dwelt on the lamentable
ignorance of " many classes of the community," who for
the most part believed that Bishops "had nothing whatever
to do, that their incomes were too large, and that their
numbers might well be diminished." We fear there do
exist many such heathenish unbelievers in the full efficacy
of Bishops. Nevertheless, his Lordship may take comfort
from the conviction that, on the other hand, such heretics
are at least equalled in number by the truly devout, whose
faith it is to believe that Bishops have at least everything
in this world to do, that they are not paid a twentieth part
enough; and that for the amelioration of every human
calamity there is but one great specific,—namely, the
multiplication of Bishops!
Complete Quietude.
The " quietness" produced by the antimonial powders
sold under that denomination by certain chemists at Bolton
appears to be of the kind mentioned in the hatchment
motto "In Ctelo Quies."
PLEASURE EXCURSIONS FOR PARLIAMENT.
That all work and no play makes Jack, a dull boy, is a maxim which
applies as well to a public body as to a private person: at any rate it is
applied by Lord Palmerston to the Houses of Parliament. Every
now and then the noble Premier gives the Legislature a holiday. A
little while ago he took it to the Naval Review at Spit la-ad, and now
he has just indulged it in an excursion to see a corresponding Military
exhibition at Aldershott, treating it on both occasions at the public
expense. This is good policy, not only with a view to retention of
office, but also for the purpose of getting Parliament to do its work
cheerfully and with alacrity. After a holiday, legislators may be
expected to set to with redoubled ardour and diligence at their
appointed tasks.
We trust that the noble Lord will carry out the experiment which
he has commenced with such signal:'success, and that the newspapers
will soon, very frequently contain paragraphs of the following kind:—
"Yesterday being Coronation Day, the Houses of Lords and Com-
mons were taken by the Government for a day's pleasure and recreation
to Hampton Court. Noble lords and honourable gentlemen were con-
veyed in vans gaily decorated with flags and flowers, and accompanied
by bands of music which played ' Cheer, Boys, Cheer' the 'Ratcatcher's
Daughter' and other appropriate airs. Tie merry party alighted in
Bushy Park, where an awning was spread, under which both Houses
assembled, and each Member received a piece of plum-cake and a glass
of wine. After having partaken of this refreshment, Parliament
adjourned to Hampton CourK and spent several hours in inspecting
the pictures so fraught with historical recollections, and in admiring
the gold fish and other interesting objects abounding in that picturesque
locality. Among these, the miz-maze, or labyrinth, attracted particular
attention, as beirg pleasantly suggestive of the intricacies of debate.
Having examined every object in the Palace and grounds wonliy of
attention, the delighted holiday-makers returned to the Park, where,
under the before-mentioned awniDg, a substantial meal was provided
for them, consisting of good old English fare, roast beef and plum-
pudding, which, a benediction having been previously pronounced by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, soon disappeared. At the con-
clusion of the repast 'Non Nobis' was sung by professionals in
attendance, and was followed by the National Anthem; all hands
joining in the chorus. In the evening the merry legislators returned to
Town, highly gratified by the daj's treat which they bad experienced.
They were taken back by the same conveyances as those in which they
bad been brought down, and, during the whole of their journey, evinced
their exhilaration by cheering and singing songs. We understand tbat
it is in contemplation to celebrate the anniversary of Her Majesty's
Coronation regularly, in future, by a Parliamentary excursion to some
attractive place of resort in the vicinity of London. The necessary
expenses of the trip will be defrayed by a generous nation, which will
be only too glad to afford its hard-worked legislators the means of
enjoying that relaxation necessary no less to the cheerful than the
effective performance of their duties."
The Premier, the other day, regretted that it was not in the power
of the Government to take the ladies of Members to Aldershott. In
future, perhaps, this drawback on the Parliamentary holiday will be
obviated, and the ears of the pedestrian on the towing-path of the
Thames will often be saluted by the notes of harp and violin pro-
ceeding from a steamer ascending the Biver, with Members of Par-
liament on board, and their wives and daughters, taken up to Eel-pie
Island or Thames Ditton for a holiday.
A SORRY SAINT.
In a letter to the Record the following accusation is brought against
somebody by a nameless noodle or an anonymous hypocrite.
"Great rejoicings were felt that the chair at a very important meeting on behalf of
the Church Missionary Society was occupied by a very distinguished individual. In
a few days after, to my deep sorrow, I heard, as the last piece of in
him, that he had gone to Town, and been seen at the Opera."
f information respecting
This fellow describes himself as "One who is jealous for our Evan-
gelical Societies," and his jealousy apparently causes him to think, or
pretend that be thinks, the Church Missionary Society's reputation
injured by the circumstance that a meeting of that association had been
presided over by a very distinguished individual who had subsequently
been seen at the Opera. It must be very "painful"—to condescend to
the use of a sanctified vulgarism— very painful" to this victim of the
evangelical green-eyed monster, to consider—as he must—that the most
distinguished individual in the kingdom, or, more accurately speaking,
the queendom, has oftentimes been seen at the Opera, the National
Anthem having been usually sung on those occasions. For that very
distinguished individual is, not, indeed, the chairman of the Church
Missionary Society, but, with all respect be it spoken, the chairwoman
or president of the Church itself. This consideration must exceedingly
deepen his already deep Borrow, and in that deep create a lower di ep,
if the sorrow of this sorry fellow is unaffected Borrow, instead of being,
as we rather think it is, affected sorrow, and, in one word, sham.
HOMOEOPATHIC GLOBULES. (Third Dose.)
Oncb a humbug, always a humbug.
Ofall patients, the medical patient is the greatest coward.
It's all very well to say "Physician, heal thyself," but no Physician likes doing it.
Those cases pay the best In which there is nothing the matter with the patient.
One "Malade Imaglnaire" to a Doctor is an income—two a brougham—six a
fortune.
The highest skill of a Doctor is in putting his patients on bread and water without
their knowing it; making the bread into pills, and colouring the water so as to niako
them believe it is medicine.
Ills, pills, and bills are members of the same family, that often meet at the same
bedside.
The patient may do without the physician, but the physician cannot do without the
paUent.
Lake and His Sword.
Thb folks of Ramsgate have presented Colonel Lakb, one of the
heroes of Kars, with a sword: we are happy to announce the fact.
Perhaps the gallant officer may now be permitted, with that swoid in
hand, to cut bis way through routine, or whatever obstacle it may be,
between his merits and the Palace.

When pig* are made such objects of attentive interest, it is rather hard

INCIVILITY TO CIVIL SERVANTS.
Everybody knows that the Civil Service of the country has been for
some time complaining that it is deprived of five per cent.—or one-
twentieth of its income—for the pretended purpose of paying a super-
annuation allowance, which very few get in any shape, and which
nobody can get from the money that is stopped, inasmuch as the whole
amount is swamped for general purposes. The Civil Service, feeling
that it had a grievance, has been for some years trying to get the
grievance redressed, and it is now proposed to send away the grumblers,
with one of those tremendous fleas which Governments seem to keep
for the purpose of patting into the ears of the most reasonable, and
consequently the most troublesome malcontents. The Civil Servants
are civilly enough told, that they are quite right in saying they have
been improperly made to contribute five per cent, of their income, and
they are to be relieved from the payment for the future, by the easy
process of not giving it to them to pay—or in simple language, they are
tbreatened with a reduction of five per cent, on their salaries. This
mode of set tling the matter seems to be very much as though a person
who had been systematically robbing another for some time were to
say to the victim, "It is very true I have been taking from you what is
your own, but in future I'll call it mine, and then you can't say I'm
robbing you."
The conclusion come to by the select committee savours very much
of a rather heartless joke, for after having been many months con-
sidering how an admitted grievance can be redressed, the committee
proposes a plan for cutting at the root of the evil by lopping off
altogether the income which is the source of the obnoxious super-
annuation tax. The mode of adjustment proposed, is just as if a man
accused of treading on his neighbour's corns, were to say, "Very true, I
had no right to tread carelessly on jour corns, but I'll just cut off your
foot, and then you'll have no corns to tread upon." Such is the
principle involved in the recommendation of the committee, which
amounts merely to this: "The Civil Servants complain justly of having
to pay five per cent., and therefore the five per cent, had bet'er be taken
from them, so that when they have not got it to pay, they cannot
complain of paying it.",

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN UNRECORDED EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF AET.
he chronology of the year
would not be perfect unless
every little event were re-
corded in Punch; we think,
therefore, it is our bounden
duty to register for the
benefit of posterity a most
important fact which has
hitherto not been hailed with
its proper share of popularity.
We allude to the artistic
decease of the Octagon Room
in the Royal Academy. It
had previously undergone
cleaning from the hands of
some of the old washer-
women who operated so
efficiently on the chefs d'antvres
of the National Gallery, and
the natural consequence is
that it has been rubbed clean
out of existence! The dark-
ness remains, but the pic-
tures have been removed.
Without the show of the
colours and the glitter of the
gold frames, it is curious to
notice how very black the
walls are. The darkness of
the place is now to its fullest advantage alike aeeD, heard, and felt.
It looks like a remnant of the dark ages, or a sable reminiscence of
the Vernon Gallery. The obtcurity would do honour to a coal-cellar,
and the light is so effectually excluded that it would answer the
purpose of a photographic "chambre noire" most admirably. It is
not used for any exhibition requirements, but the Secretary, we are
informed, makes it his hiding-place.

THE SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL MILITIA.
To Henry, Lord Bishop of Exeter.
My Lord Bishop,
Allow me to take the liberty of suggesting one argument
against the Bishops op London and Durham Retirement Bill, which
does not appear to have occurred to your Lordship, as you have not
mentioned it in your protest against that measure.
What—supposing the bill to have passed, and the Bishops to have
safely resigned—what if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, or whoever
their appointed paymasters may be, should, by direction of Government,
coolly turn round upon them, and deduct four-fifths of the little
allowances which they have bargained for as a retiring pension, under
pretence of stoppages on this account and that? What if, moreover,
those official defaulters should defer the payment of the remaining fifth
to some future and indefinite period, and should require the Bishops to
doff their mitres, and strip off their aprons and lawn sleeves, without
supplying them with common hats and suits of black to withdraw inP
Is "not the case above supposed pretty closely paralleled by the
treatment of the Tipperary Militia?—the principal difference being
that the case of the Militiamen was a case of only 70s. promised, and
payment refused, except to the amount of 14?., to be paid somewhen.
The Militiamen declined to divest themselves of their uniforms, or
lay down their arms. So far from disarming themselves, they fired on
the regular troops; but on whom are the Bishops to fire in case they
are swindled and cheated,—and why should they not be cheated and
swindled as well as the Militia P
Government, indeed, may think—if we break onr promise to the
Bishops of London and Durham, we shall not be very likely to get
other Bishops to follow their example. But Militiamen are practically
as necessary as Bishops, and faith ought to be kept with the former as
honestly as with the latter, unless Ministers think that to bamboozle
the Militia is the way to get that force recruited on future occasions.
That, to be sure, seems to be what they do think; otherwise why do
they reward Militia regiments that volunteered to go to the Ionian
Islands by letting them stay there for want of the means of transport?
The principle of this conduct appears to be based on the sentiment, that
the Militia are now done with, and may go to the deuce. But the
Militia, although disbanded, may be wanted again; but the services of
a Bishop who has once resigned will never again be required. Therefore
the temptation to cheat the Bishop is much greater than the induce-
ment to defraud the Militiaman, to say nothing of the very much
higher degree in which the cozenage of the Bishop would be lucrative.
Although you have unsuccessfully opposed the measure in question, I
hope that your Lordship will succeed in insuring the performance of
the engagement which has been contracted with the Bishops; and that,
while your hand is in, you will also obtain a similar measure of justice
for the Militiamen.
In that consolatory assurance, I beg to subscribe myself your Lord-
ship's most obedient servant,
erases.
PS. If the Bishops really get paid, they will be lucky. They will
obtain rewards that have not often before been conferred upon
retiring merit.,

THE SLOW GROWTH OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
In England, the growth of buildings, like that of its institutions, is
exceedingly slow, if sure. Years are taken over a building that on the
Continent would be run up in almost as many months. A celebrated
German Statistician has sent us the following incredible particulars:—
To erect a Simple Column . . It takes in England 12 years.
Ditto, with Lions, everything complete „ 21 „
To Build a Common Bridge . . „ 15 „
Ditto a Suspension Bridge , „ 25 lf
Ditto Houses of Parliament . . A Trifle under 100 „
With statues, the same authority proceeds to say, they have a curious
plan. They erect the pedestal first, and then leave it in one of their
most public places to be ready for the statue of some celebrated man,
when they have caught one. Thus, in Trafalgar Square, they have a
pedestal that has been waiting for years. It is supposed to be for the
Coming Man, but apparently he is in no hurry to make his appearance.
Forgetfulness Extraordinary.
In what state of mind could the gentleman have been who wrote the
following sentences in the Morning Herald?
"The Tatnworth Baronet betrayed both causes. He fell—he deservedly fell, and he
died of a broken heart."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

the werry first thing as ever i does when i goes to the
Chuistial Palis, is to cut a cheer!
[Observation of Old Lady, July 17th, 1856, as ever was.
"GIVE THE WORLD ASSURANCE OF A MAN."
Mb, Punch has observed that there have lately been several in-
stances in which Life Assurance Offices have resisted the claims of the
policy-holders. He is not about to enter into the details of any of these
cases, in most of which the resistance has been ineffectual, and the law
has made the offices stick to their bargains. Neither is he going to
reproduce Lord Chief Justice Campbell's just but very severe
remarks upon the greediness of some of the new offices to obtain
business, which afterwards burns their fiogers. Caveat Confirmator.
But considering that any man whose income dies with him, and whose
family does not, is guilty of something very like crime if he neglects to
make assurance-provision for those he leaves behind him, Mr. Punch is
disposed.to be proportionately disgusted with any institution, which,
through carelessness, avarice, or clumsiness, brings the assurance
system into any kind of discredit.
He will waive the graver part of the questiop, the greediness to get
business, and will venture to offer a few impertinent remarks upon the
carelessness or clumsiness of the people, who, in spite of the tremendous
and elaborate investigation they affect to perform, contrive to get let
in, and have to come to a Court of Law for relief, which Mr. Punch
hopes it will continue to be the rule to refuse, and the exception to
grant. • •
Mr. Punch's reverence for the business powers of so-called men of
business is not abject. The "practical rueD," who smile compassion-
ately at schemers and visionaries, are the men who perpetually make
the most frightful smashes and blunders. No attorney, for instance,
can keep, or comprehend accounts, and a stock-jobber, the supposed
incarnation of shrewdness, is the most credulous gobemouche in London.
But these assurance people have a system which, one would think,
might 3pcure safety, and prevent a man's later—latest—life from being
troubled with terrors lest his helpless family may be involved in a
struggle for the pittance he has toiled and. saved, for years, to ensure
them.
The inquisition into your own health, habits, and history, which is
the first step in an assurance transaction, is exceedingly minute. You
answer, in writing, as to everything which can bear on the subject. Then
you give a reference to a doctor, who is privately examined as to all
that he knows about you; and thirdly, the friend of jour soul, with
whom the goblet you sip, is cross-examined to know whether you only
sip it, or drain it, and in what company, and at what hours; and in
some cases, a second friend of your soul is demanded, nay, both of these
are occasionally required to give references to respectable Damons and
responsible Pythiases of their own. Next, you are visited by, or visit,
the Office's own medical man, who feels your pulse, and tests your chest,
and catechises you out of your own deposition, in order to catch yon, if
you have been inaccurate, and he sends you before a Board, who repeat
the scrutiny. And finally, after all these precautions, you are accepted,!
or rejected. He must be a preternatural knave who can slip through
the meshes of this net, unless somebody who holds it be a preternatural!
donkey.
Mr. Punch has no objection to the most scrutinising inquiries being-
made before a policy is granted; on the contrary, the more minute the
investigation, the better. And since the twenty-five or thirty questions
by which it is sought to discover the physiology of yourself and that of
your father, mother, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, brother*,
and sisters, is insufficient, he begs to frame a few more, conceived in
the same spirit, which he would add to the "particulars required."
Only he would insist, (hat when everything has been asked, and every-
thing tested, the record should be closed, and the bargain, if made,
should be irrevocable. For instance—
31. Did your great grandmother ever complain of having been
frightened to d^ath P
32. Are you in the habit, of reading Mb. Alison's Histories, or the
Morning Advertiser, or any other publications tending to
lengthen life?
33. Do you cross the street carefully, and have you ever been run
over by Pickfobd's vans, and how often?
31. Have you an admission to the Zoological Garden;, and if so, do
you nabitually go close to the dens of the carnivora, or get
into the serpents' cages P
35. Is your wife a strong-minded woman?
36. Do you know any Americans, and is there any chance of your
getting into political or other arguments with the owner of a
revolver?
37. Are you a polite man, who does not mind running out of a hot
Opera house to get up a carriage on a wet night?
38. Did you ever sit out an Elizabethan drama of modern construc-
tion, and how many years ago, and who attended you, medi-
cally, afterwards?
39. Do you run after fancy preachers, and do they make you cry?
40. What was the general state of jour ancestors' health, in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries P
41. Was any member of your family ever swallowed up by an
earthquake P
42. When you go to Gravesend, is it by boat or rail; and in the
former case, do you alwaj's hold fast by a rope P
43. Do you always take care not to tread on orange-peel in the street?'
44. Have you ever been afflicted with Irishmen, or any other
epidemic P
45. Who cuts your hair?
Now, let the offices add these, and any number of similar questions,
to their string of inquiries. And let them examine your friends on
oath, and your doctor as the Americans cross-examine a nigger witness,
namely, by putting him in a corner and kicking his shins until he
answers categorically. And let them have half a dozen Boards, or
even one medical officer whose head is not made of board, and let the
very utmost be done to obtain information. But, as aforesaid, a
bargain should be a bargain—not, of course, that one rogue may make
a prize, but the ninety-nine honest men who save, perhaps screw,
through years of weary toil, to secure homes for the loved ones when
their natural protector shall be at rest, may not be disturbed by a doubt
whether their cherished work has been carelessly or clumsily done,
and whether a corporation—" that which has neither a body to be kicked
nor a soul to be "—otherwise disposed of,—may not take advantage of
its own blunders.
Mr. Punch is justly proud of his patent-leather boots, but were he a
Juryman on a trial when an office disputed a policy, he would eat those
boots before giving the Defendants a verdict.
QUEER, QUESTIONABLE QUERIES?
A nr. Brewers' horses principally Brood mares?
What becomes of all the ' Bits" of a woman's mind?
Is " Death's Door" opened with a skeleton key?
How Is it that bo many men, who are extremely amiable in private, make
selves, the moment they emerge into public life, so supremely ridiculous?
When a lawyer composes his mind, does he do it in 6-8 time?
Would you Bay that a lady waa "dressed loud," who was covered all over with
bugles?
Shouldn't the Lord Cuakcrllob marry well, since he has the pick of all the Warda
in Chancery?
Is there any truth in the report that the Arabs who live in the Desert have sandy
hair? and is it also true that those who live by the Red Sea have carrots?
In selling a Newfouudland Dog do you know whether it is valued according to what
it will fetch, or what it will bring?
The Wish of a Veteran.
"Dash it, Sir!" cried a poor old Major, on bearing the amount of
the retiring allowances of the Bishops or London aud Durham,
MI wish I were an officer on half-pay in the Church Militant."

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PERAMBULATORS AND PEDESTRIANS,
OR MR. CROSSWIG'S ANNOYANCE.

What a lot of nasty little ugly babies in the streets,
Being wheeled about in those confounded little chairs one meets!
I mean those Perambulators, pushed by stupid, careless, blind,
Lazy, dawdling, idle, addle-headed servant girls behind.
Little screaming chits of creatures, little wry faced roaring brats,
With their little absurd bows and feathers in their silly hats,
Foolish little coats and jackets, flimsy little fancy frocks,
Chubby faces, turned-op noses, and preposterous curly locks!
Slommaking untidy slatterns, moonstruck idiotic sluts,
Glazing, open-mouthed, upon the Grenadier who yonder struts,
Staring at the linen-drapers' shops, or into vacant air,
Looking every way, except the way you 're going with your chair!
Howling loud your goblin charge is, all the while for rage or fright,
If you've two they cuff each other, pinch, and kick, and scratch and bite;
And, whilst you go blundering on, with zigzag course and wandering wits,
Probably your blessed babes are struggling in convulsive fits.
Not perceiving any object which is right before ycur nose,1
Bolt ahead you drive your carriage on unhappy people's toes,
Crushing corns and bunions, so that those who watch your heedless path,
Will observe it marked by victims dancing mad with pain and wrath.
I myself, Sir, I was looking at some prints the other day,
Standing quite, I do assure you, out of everybody's way;
Bang1 against my outer ankle a Perambulator drove:
Sir, it hurt me Uke old Harry; grazed the skin off, Sir, by Jove!
She—the trull—the wench who did it—there was she, a goggle-eyed,
Gape-mouthed hoyden, staring one way this, and one the other side,
Not a word to ask my pardon, not a word, Sir, uttered she,
On she went, and took no notice, as I limped and writhed, of me.
Had she, while she was about it, pushed the babes between my legs,
Bringing down my weight upon them as upon a nest of eggs,
Warning would to foolish mothers by their fate have been supplied,
And in those Perambulators wretched infants would not ride.
LUXURIOUS BISHOPS.
There Eeems to be very considerable difficulty in un-making a
Bishop, and indeed nothing short of an Act of Parliament can pull a
prelate out of the see that lie has once got into. We rather admire
the conscientious feeling which has induced a brace of Bishops to retire
when they feel they are no longer able to discharge their duties; but
it is to be regretted that their episcopal life has habituated them to so
much luxury, that nothing less t han £5,000 or £6.000 a-year will be
sufficient to provide for the necessities to which their old age will be
liable; and what must be the rate of living of a Bishoo in full swing
n»y be calculated by considering that it requires £6,000 a-year to
provide for the evening of his days, when he is naturally disposed to
i quietude.
THE BOY JONES AGAIN.
The Boy Jones—like his brother sailor, the buoy at the Nore, he is
never to be thought of as a man—has turned up again; and, we hear
confidentially from the special reporter of the Morning Bung, that he
causes the most lively uneasiness to Lord Palmebston, lest he
should gain access to the palace, and supersede him in the good graces
of his Royal Mistress. It is averred that Jones is of German descent;
and this report would appear to be borne out by the instinctive facility
he seems to possess of intruding himself into all things and all places.
It is said that Doctor Pketorius is so much alarmed at the probable
intrusion of Jones, that he every night sleeps with a gun loaded with
drop-shot at his bed-side. Gustav Waagen has been heard to inquire
of two or three distinguished members of the Athenscum as to the
artistic tastes of Jones, who, in Gustav's opinion, may prove even a
more ugly customer than William Conyngham. For our part, we
believe that, however snubbed by fortune, Jones is destined to a fixed
prosperity. We believe the boy was changed at nurse; and that a
minute inspection of one of his arms, or both, would reveal the mark of
one or two patrician strawberries,—strengthening the proof of this
event. Anyway, Jones may be profitably disposed of, in a manner
rewardful of his own genius, and highly beneficial to Europe.
Jones, in his function of cabin-boy, has lately visited Greece. Lately,
off Athens, he had leave to go ashore; when, we learn, he had not been
long on dryland, before he was apprehended in King Otho's palace.
Now as, in all probability, King Otho may soon be required, for the
good of Greece, to quit the throne of Greece, why should not the Boy
Junes be elevated to it? Jones the First would at least be as
majestic would at least make as respectable a father of the Greek
people as the first Otho, whose better part of Boyalty is that better
half, his wife. All the instincts of Jones smack of Royalty. Is it not
his boast that, adventuring into the nursery of English Boyalty, it was
his high privilege to hear a Royal baby cry? Our voice is—" Vive
Jones the Fiest, King or Greece!" His elevation may be quietly
managed, and at almost no expense; the only necessary cost will be
for the enlargement of the crown; for what suits the pippin of Otho
can hardly fit "that globe of thought, that palace of the soul," sur-
mounting the shoulders of Jones.
THE HANGING EEPORT.—" PEIVATE AND
CONFIDENTIAL."
Y Lords' Committee have
made their hangman's report;
and, after'much pondering, re-
commend—that, henceforth,
criminals shall be privately
hat ged. Much public scan-
dal will be prevented by this
private and confidential way
of killing: a mode to be
adopted at the same time
that the debates of their
Lordships are heard with
closed doors, all reporters
attempting to make their
way into the House being
given into custody for quick
conveyance to the Tower.
Entering pretty fully into the
details of the new plan of
execution, their Lordships
recommend that the outside
world should be warned of
the approaching tragedy by a
black flag hoisted above the
prison. We have heard that
their Lordships recommended
this display in earnest com-
pliment _ to the Bishop of
Oxford, under whose pastoral care the Committee was appointed.
The black flag must always recall to a grateful generation the memory
of the black apron. For ourselves, we think a Bishop better em-
ployed in the vineyard of his Master, than in the ropeyard of the
Judges.

PROTEST BY THE BISHOP OF BAJNTGOR.
The protest of the Bishop op Exeteb against the BSll
for enabling the Bishops op London and Durham to'
retire, and for permitting the Country to pension them,
was published on Thursday. We have been requested to
give publicity to a similar protest, made by another Bight
Reverend Prelate, which was inserted in the Lotds' Jour-
nals on the following day.
"Dissentient,
"1. Because the Bishop op Bangor considers that a
Bishop who is able to give receipts for his income is per-
fectly competent to discharge his episcopal duties, and 1
think you are a pack of schismatic dissenting apostates if
yon attempt to disturb the peace of the Church.
"2. Because the Bishop of Bangor is perfectly well
aware, and in fact suspect, that all the fellows who pre
'end to demand more efficient services from the other
Bishops, merely aim at the ruin of the Church of England,
and if I had my way I would put you in the stocks.
"3. Because the Bishop op Bangor thinks that the
retiring pensions ought to be equal to the income, and I
am disgusted with your profane and fraudulent attempt to
defraud and plunder those who minister at the altar.
"4. Because the Bishop op Bangor regards you all as
firebrands, who ought to go in penancs through London
with a fool's cap on your heads, and biroh rods elsewhere,
and I hope you will have grace to be ashamed of your
wickedness.
"Christopher Bangor."
A Musical Compliment.
A celebrated Musical Critic, who doesn't often pay com-
pliments, speaking of tbe great difficulties of the violin
says, "What with most players is only 'Science in Fun,'
becomes 'Sport in Ernst.'"
THE TICKET-OF-LEAVE SYSTEM.
The last Ticket of this kind has been taken out by Mb.
James Sadleir, who has fled, it is rumoured, to Sweden.
We beg to state, however, that it was a Ticket-of-French-
Leave.
NEW CUT THEATRICALS.
The last juvenile performance for the present holidays (school re-
opening on the 24th) took place on Wednesday night, in the spacious
and well-furnished front nursery of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, whose
children, assisted by some young friends and schoolfellows, had got up
the Miller and his Men, followed by an act from Elizabeth, or the Exiles
of Siberia.
The theatre had been a present to Master Willi am Jenkins, from
a kind uncle; the characters had been cut out and painted by Master
Henry Jenkins, and Master Walter Sparrow; the scenery was
coloured by Miss Catherine Jenkins. The costumes of the cha-
racters and the decorations of the stage throughout the whole perform-
ance were in the most exquisite taste; and in fitting the first piece,
written for a larger stage, to the resources of a child's theatre, great
ingenuity was shown. The interior of tne mill, with which it concluded,
was executed by Master Charles Cowderoy, who obtained the first
drawing prize at Dr. Smacker's classical, commercial, and mathe-
matical academy, this half.
The children read the characters very nicely, minding their stop.",
and sounding their aitches, and there was very little quarrelling behind
the blankets which had been stuck up to separate the performers from
the stage. We do not wish to excite vanity by praising one more than
another, for they were all very good, and in amusing themselves tried
to amuse their friends. If we are asked, why we have written an
article upon the subject, we reply that we really do not know, for the
entertainments were those of a strictly private party, and we rather
suspect that we do it chiefly out of a good-natured desire to gratify the
performers and their friends, who like to see themselves complimented
in print. In the same spirit let us add honourable mention of Mr.
Jenkins, the head of the family, who not only opened his beautiful
nursery for the amusement of a numerous body of guests, but in the
most hospitable manner provided for the entertainment of all who
witnessed the performance.
A COUNTRY THAT OWES US A GREAT DEAL.
It is said that Mr. James Sadlelr has escaped to Sweden. That
country has become the refuge of all tainted persons, who are either
afraid, or ashamed, to remain in England. It is in a fair (or rather
unfair) way to prove itself the Botany Bay of our Bankruptcy Courts.
All our social convicts transport themselves there. It has taken,
vis-a-vis to our country, the unsavoury place of Boulogne, since grown
respectable. The promotion should be duly recorded, for the satis-
faction of all commercial criminals, in the Gazette. The slave who
lands on English soil, is from that moment free. The fraudulent
bankrupt, once safe on Swedish ground, is in somewhat a similar
position, for he enjoys instant freedom—from arrest. Let him be ever
so black, no one can touch him. He can snap his fingers at his
creditors, and sing to the tune of the thousands that he has swindled
them out of, "Noli me Tangere." We doubt if the future crops of
Swedish turnips will be much improved by this new system of English
owing? In the meantime, since Sweden takes a peculiar pleasure in
making itself the sanctuary of the very worst classes in Europe, we
think a satisfactory answer can be given at last to the tiring, stale
question of "What shall we do with our convicts?" The answer we
triumphantly mske is, "Transport them to Sweden." As it is the open
home of our bankrupts and swindlers, it would not object probably, for
a small consideration, to become the abode also of our convicts.
Apology for Ex-Episcopal Incomes.
A BiSHor ought to be well paid for the performance of his duties.
Now, one of the principal duties of a Bishop is, when necessary, to set
an example of resignation.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
T the meeting of the Lords
on Monday afternoon
{July 21), Lord Ltnd-
hubst took an oppor-
tunity of expressing his
exceeding regret (that
was the polite word he
used) that so many bills
had been lost or aban-
doned. The Lord Chan-
cellor said that he
shared in the regret, bat
urged that "very many
useful measures" had
been passed. Mr. Punch
never breaks his pro-
mises, and having en-
gaged, at the opening of
the Session, to compare
its results with the pro-
mises which Ministers
then induced Her Ma-
jesty to make, will take
his own opportunity of il-
lustrating Cranworth's
ideas of number and of
utility. As usual, another
instance of the East India
Company's unscrupulous treatment of the natives was afforded, the Rajah op Coorg
being the victim this time. The ill-treatment of the Irish Militia, whom Government,
now that the War is over, can afford to wrong—and does, was next adverted to, but
of course Lord Panmube "had received no information as to the special grievance
brought forward. Then the question of our relations with the Brazils was raised by
Lord Malmesbuby. In this matter Mr. Punch has the satisfaction of informing
the Ministers that their conduct obtains his approbation. The Brazilians, no doubt,
want slaves for field labour, for those articles of commerce have been largely killed
off, lately, by cholera and the yellow fever. But, in defiance of all rules of political
economy, England has set hertelf against a certain branch of trade, namely, the
slave-trade, and if the Brazilian Government cannot or will not suppress the
traffic, John Bull is unenlightened or Quixotic enough to be ready and willing to
pay for ships and guns to do it. We have found it necessary to hint this fact to
Brazil, in consequence of the increase of the trade, and the Brazilian legislature
bawls out that we are bullying a weak nation. But weakness is not to be an
excuse for wrong. If a man sees a lubberly boy sneaking from his duty, and,
remonstrances failing, gives that lubber a refresher with a horsewhip, the man is
not, therefore, a bully. We ruined our finest colonies, and threw_ away twenty
millions of money to be able to raise clean hands against the domestic institution,"
as the Americans call it, and shall certainly raise hands with something in them,
other than money, if necessary.
Next, we had confirmation of the fact, that Bussia has already begun to cheat
the other parties to the treaty of Paris. Lord Clarendon stated that the fortresses
which she had to surrender, and which were to have been given up uninjured, had
been dismantled; and he thought, good creature, that this was a most "unusual"
proceeding, but he hoped that "nothing further" would occur to disturb the
goodwill between the countries. As consolation, we are to have a Russian
Ambassador here, Count Krepowitch.
The Commissioners for consolidating our Statute Law report that it may be
reduced from 15,000 acts to 300, and from 40 volumes to i. Mr. Punch trusts
that for consistency's sake, when this hydraulic packing is performed, the number
of lawyers will be similarly reduced.
The Bishops' Retirement (and Pensions) Bill was read a third time by 26 to 15.
and passed, the Duke of Somerset declaring that the bargain deserved a still
stronger name than Simony. Assuredly, no unhappy Parson, tempted or driven
to a corrupt negociation about a presentation, can ever be punished again.
"A sin In crape is trice a Bin in lawn."
In the Commons, Mr. Villiers lashed Lord Lucan for his cavalry officer
impertinence about the Chelsea investigation, and said that Lucan, if reported
accurately, had been guilty of an "unmitigated untruth." Mr. Mubbough
discharged his mission m the House by making a ridiculous exhibition of himself
in reference to the German Legion, and mouthed out some Victoria Theatre trash
about Britons bleeding under the dirks of German hirelings, who corrupted the
morals of our virtuous soldiery. Anything for a laugh this hot weather. Mr.
Vernon Smith, with unusual discretion, selected an evening of Indian temperature
for his Indian Budget. Only about 30 Members stayed to perspire under his speech,
which occupies nearly six columns of the papers. The principal fact disclosed
is, that in Mr. Smith's opinion, the Company has not mismanaged India so
much as could have been anticipated, for the deficit in the coming year's revenue
will only be £1,152,109. so exact is the mis-Government in calculating the result of
its future blunders. Had Ms. Mantalini been in the House he would have said
"the nine pound be demd."
Tuesday. Lucan gave himself more airs, and Lord
Pan mure rebuked him severely, significantly advising him
to avoid such language as provoked a reply. Mr. Punch
may as well mention here that the Chelsea Report has been
produced, a book nearly as thick as the hf ads of the parties
accused by the Crimean Report. His fiery glance, how-
ever, scorched up the hay in a second, and found the needle,
the point of which is that the aristocratic officers appointed
to whitewash Lucan and the rest of the awkward squad,
have of course, done it; and he need hardly add that the
precious result (though it will justify any amount of
triumphant cackle at the ould ocksifers' Clubs) will not in
the slightest degree disturb the opinion of the country as
to the helplessness and blundering of the Crimean "Bot-
toms with the Asses' Heads."
In the Commons, the Bill for improving the County
Courts, charging the cost of justice upon the country, and
not upon the suitors (a right principle) passed, and the
appointment of a Minister of Education was carried by 77
to 35,112 Members only caring to be present on such a
discussion. Mr. Heywood brought in a motion for a
Commission to re-edit the English Bible, but withdrew it
after a brief speech, in opposition, from Sir Geo kg r Grey.
It is a fair question for consideration, whether it is or is not
desirable to disturb the time-honoured and nobly English
text of our authorised version, (whose manly ana touching
style the Raman Catholics declare to be one of our towers
of strength, and which has been so invaluable in preserving
a standard of language among us) for the sake of cor-
recting many errors, some of admitted gravity, which mar
its excellence. Mr. Wilkinson then vainly attempted to
carry a resolution for shortening the speeches in Par-
liament. Mr. Fox's suggestion that the leaders should
speak first and, by exhausting the subject, prevent donkeys
from exhausting the House, was not bad. Sir J.
Fitzgerald tooK a good time, when the streets of Madrid
are red with the slaughter on the barricades, to press the
claims of the creditors of Spain, and then came the case of
General Beatson, who organised Irregular troops in the
late War, troops whose irregularities were so grave as to
cause his being superseded. He felt aggrieved, and per-
haps was rather indiscreet in showing bis wrath. The
War-Office stated itself to be waiting for information, but
by a curious coincidence, within twenty-four hours, a
Government letter was written, exonerating the bold
Beatson from all charges.
Wednesday. Lord Palmerston brought in the Bishops'
Bill on the preceding night, but the House would not let
him press it, and the debate was taken this day. Parties
were split. Sir W. Heathcote, Mr. Henley, and Mr.
Napier, Conservatives, opposed it, Mr. Walpole, Con-
servative, supported it. Sir J. Graham and Mb. Glad-
stone, Peelites, opposed it, while Mr. Cardwell, Peelite,
supported it. Some of the Radicals opposed and others
advocated it, and the conflict of parties ended in Ministers
getting a very respectable majority in its favour, the second
reading being carried by 151 to 72.
Thursday. The Lords did nothing particular, beyond
insisting on adhering to their objectionable and priest-
prompted alterations in the Scotch Schools Bill, which,
being ruined, was withdrawn next day in the Commons,
where the alterations had been rejected.
In the Commons there was another fight on going into
Committee on the Bishops' Bill, and the Solicitor-
General and Mr. Gladstone pelted one another with
excessively bad Latin, to the great instruction of the
country gentlemen, and the Manchester and railway
members. Mr. Hadpield abused the bishops generally,
and declared that they were not fit to hold a candle to
certain dissenting preachers whom he named; but the
House apparently had not taken the odd advice given in
the love-letter of a faithless sea-captain, which was read,
alas, in a breach of promise case the same day, "I very
much wish you will take to liking Dissenters." The Bill
went through committee after several divisions, and
passed on Friday. Mr. Roebuck moved for the expulsion
of James Sadleir from the House; but the process was
wisely deferred until after the recess. Sadleir is doubt-
less a knave, but the fewer precedents for expelling
Members without legal proof of guilt, the better.
Friday. Lord Wensleydale, whose original coronet
has been so cruelly kicked about both Houses during the
session, took his seat with a bran new one, of the kind
called Hereditary. Lord St. Vincent, father of the lady

Loi :> Combermere, who has been opposed to him throughout the
litigation in the Sombre case. When Mr. Punch has said that the
first-named nobleman is ninety years old, the only reason for not
speaking of this demonstration, and of the whole miserable history,
with the strongest expression of disgust and contempt, has been
assigned. The Lords struck out of the Leases Bill the anti-ToMMY
Wilson clause inserted by the Commons.
A very young officer, aged 24, and named Boyle, whom the Eahl
op Cokk and Orrery (another Boyle) returns for Frome, took his
seat. And official notice was given of the fact that Mr. Edward
Strutt, a very worthy man, who, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lan-
caster a short time ago, displayed the faculty of going to sleep in the
House upon all occasions, and at the shortest notice, is transferred to
li-ii-h his nan in the Lords, as Baron Belfer. Having been a
cotton manufacturer, he will know where to buy his night-caps. Mr.
Layard, Lome from the East, expressed his, Mr. Punch's, and the
coun ry's supreme contempt for the Chelsea Hospital salve for curing
the reputations of Ltjcan, Cardigan, and Company. And then came
an exhibition from which some entertainment had been expected. Mr.
Benjamin Disraeli, in imitation of an old custom of his friend Lord
Ltndhurst, had undertaken to review the Session, and as there has
seldom been such an opportunity for that kind of sarcasm in which
Ben used to exoel, a tolerable, but not a large audience assembled in
the hopes of a piquant speech. Even Lord Lyndhurst himself came
down, to see the parody on himself, as Bistori did to see Bobson.
But Ben was an utter failure. Nobody expected large views, or good
taste, or common justice, and so far nobody was disappointed. Cat
everybody expected a rallying, slashing, stinging Philippic, with a
sprinkling of anecdote, epigram, and nickname, and instead of this,
Benjamin gave the House two hours of a prosaic recapitulation of the
disasters of the Session—a far better summary has been given in every
London journal. Of course, Lord Palmers'!on had it all his own
way in reply, and, to do our Bottleholder justice, his style of treat-
ment is always lively and effective. He could not disprove the
assertion that Government had utterly failed in its duty to the
legislature, but he attributed the absence of legislation to the melan-
choly fact that he could not make laws, despotically, as the con-
stitution permits Parliament to consider, delay, and reject them. This
is a deplorable truth, and perhaps Lord Palmerston is meditating- a
coup d'etat next week, in imitation of certain French and Spanish friends
of bis. As, in such a case, Mr. Punch will be his first victim, that
gentleman seizes this opportunity of declaring that the conduct of
Lord Palmerston throughout the Session has been eminently uncon-
stitutional. Measures of importance, brought in by Government, are
measures by which a Government should stand—or fall, and a Minister
who sacrifices nearly all his bills, involving principles, yet retains office,
commits a political fraud. There! and now up with your guns, my
Lord, and batter 85, Fleet Street, as soon as jou like.
Saturday. Both Houses met, in order to get routine work
time for the Prorogation.
DESPAIR OF HUMAN NATURE.
That every human being
is a rational and ac-
countable creature, en-
dowed with an immor-
tal soul, is a truism,
which, however, some
men and some things
in this world almost
tempt one to doubt.
Among those men are
advertising haberdash-
ers, and among those
things advertisements,
such as this one:—
"Coming. Events.—The
practical correctness of the
public press was n«ver, per-
haps, more remarkable than
in their prophetic decla-
ration that the graceful
Boumon* would entirely
supersede, among the haute
voUe, every other descrip-
tion of cloak for evening
dress, the promenade, or
the opera. This beautiful
article of attire Is now Iden-
tified with its originators,
the proprietors of the
'Spomalla' . . . (oppo-
stU • • • Chapel), and
is appropriately designated,
as a spicialitt, the 'Bour-
nous a la Bidouin.' Every
lady should possess one of
these charming appendages,
thing for aU time.'"
Mr. Pope alludes to a certain insect in human form, as "that thing of silk." Such a
thing, we suppose, is the Bournous a la Bedouin; and if so, such things are its "originators"
also, by tbeir own account; for they 6tate that "this beautiful article of attiie is now
identified with" themselves—"the proprietors of the Sponsalia." Their own idea of their
personal identity appears to be a happy one, and we are tempted to regard them as an
assortment of silks in a Co's shape. What other living entities imaginable could desc-ibe
the " Sponsalia" shop as "opposite to * * * Chapel," with such profound insensibility of
th« oppositeness of the sacred edifice to the shop—alive only to the congruity between the
"Sponsalia" and the fashionable chapel?
On the face of the above advertisement it appears that the Bournous is a sort of cloak;
but it would also seem that it is a cloak of a curious kind. The garment is termed an
appendage. To a gentleman, a coat-tail is the only appendage, properly so called, in the way
of dres«, that we can think of. How are ladies to wear the appendage called Bournous
a la Bedouin?
The Bournous is to be "a fashion in itself—a thing for all time;" the rage for ever; like
the composition of certain poets—Shakspeare and some others! It is dreadful to read such
stuff as this; for, mind, it, is not nonsense meant as such. It is serious puffery, addressed,
not to the illiterate multitude, but to the "haute volej," and to think that amongst the
superior classes there is any considerable number of persons upon whom it can produce
any other effect than that of nausea, is a reflection calculated to create a deplorable misgiving
as to the essential nature and destiny of our common kind.

for, like the composition of certain poets, the Bournous is a fashion in itself—a
THE SEE!
The See, the See, the wealthy See!
I can't resign it gra'is free;
Within the mark—within fair bounds—
I think I may say six thousand pounds—
That is little enough—but one's heart's in the
skies—
Therefore one can't be worldly wise.
I'm in the See, I'm in the See,
I am where I may ev-r be.
Suppose I do not chooie to go.
What do you say then; jes or no P
Of the whole of the income I stand possessed.
And I can't be turned out of my Mother's
nest,
For a Mother the Church has been to me,
And 1 was born for her tatted See.
I love my Sse, my wealthy See,
1 scorn the idea of Simony;
But I must take care what I'm about,
Six thousand a-year and I 'II turn out.
My offer you lira better take,
And you will, if you are wide awake,
For Death, whenever lie comes to me,
Can alone compel me to quit my See.
EXTREME SCARCITY.
Within all our experience we do not recol-
lect such an extreme scarcity of Extraordinary
Gooseberries as in this present year. However,
as Parliament has just put up its shutters, there
is still hope before Christmas of a few ripening
to their usual full-blown Falstaffian dimensions.
The faot is, the Penny-a-liner has had his eye so
fixed on M.P.'s, that he has had no time to hunt
for Gooseberries. The greenness of the one
pursuit interferes with the greenness of the
other. But now, the field of vegetable discovery
is fairly open to him. As Parliament closes, his
hunting-season begins. What Grouse is to the
Member, the Gooseberry is to the Penny-a-liner.
Proverbial Philosophy.
A New novel has been published under the
title of an old saying—Neeer too Late to Mend.
This time-honoured maxim is to bs received with
a qualification. It may hold good of our spiritual
being, buf, unfortunately, it does not apply to the
sole of our boot.

rOBTBAIT OF AN OFHCER FBOM THE SEAT OF WAR.
CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION.
(Continued.)
"Ms. Fkoissakt Jones, grateful to Mr. Punch for his enlightened
patronage, prefers confiding tbe rest of his Examination Papers to Mr.
Punch's care, to running the risk of their being purloined or suppressed
by seidiug them direct to the Commissioners.
"Rhododendron Lodge, July 26."
"Paris vaut Hen une messe," was the high-minded reply of William
Rxjfus to his parasitical courtiers, who sought to persuade the monarch
that the waters of Heme Bay would recede from the beach at the royal
bidding.
Dr. Isaac Watts, the discoverer of the propflling power of steam,
and author of Pamela, The Busy Bee, and the. Rehearsal, was haDged
for a forgery committed on Sia William Davinant. Madame de
Quebouailles, Duchess of Portsmouth, to whom the reverend delin-
quent officiated as almoner, vainly interceded with Edwabd the
Sixth for the criminal's pardon. The aged monarch was inexorable.
When his fate was certain and there was no hope left, the satirical
nonconformist revenged himself by scrawling these lines on the wall of
his prison:
*' Here lies our mutton-Mting king,
"Whose word no man relies on;
He never said a foolish thing,
He never did a-wiee one."
Gbobge the Second, enraged at the obstinate resistance of the
low-born burghers of Calais, swore, on captnring the town, to put the
whole of the inhabitants to the sword, but Pair Rosamond obtained
their pardon by claiming it as her only boon for sucking the poison out
of the wound inflicted on the infuriated monarch by Bebtrand de
Goubdon. This incident is forcibly described in Ben Jonson's
tragedy of Twelfth Night.
Wat Tyler, Lord Mayor of London, is renowned in history for
slaying Jack Cade at the fight of Tewkesbury. Queen Elizabeth,
to evince her gratitude, conferred on him the following honourable
augmentation of his arms. On a saltire vert, engrailed or, two mullets
wavy, surmounted by a chevron proper, bearing in its beak a garter
with the device " Primus in Indis."
Alexander the Qreat bore his defeat at Plafrea with the magna-
nimity of a hero, but when he saw his old friend and fellow-soldier,
Bbtjttjs, pursuing him with a drawn sword, he dropped his own
weapon, hared his breast to the murderer, and with a look and accent
of bitter but pa'hetic reproach, addressed the traitor in the sorrowful
words "Carpe diem," and fell pierced with wounds at the foot of
Pompey's statue.
When George the Third heard of the acquittal of the Seven
Bishops, he sent for Judge Jeffreys, and asked him in a voice of
thunder how he dared let the insolent prelates escape. "Sire,"
answered the benevolent and high-minded Lord Chancellor, "If
your Majesty will but—" "If me no ifs, Sir Knave," shouted the
tyrant. By St. Paul, I will not dine till I see tby fool's head lopped
fiom thy shoulders." A block was in the garden of the Palace, the
pious judge was obliged to lay down his head, and with one blow from
a cook's cleaver, it was severed from his body. To avoid the recur-
rence of such arbitrary acts, tbe undaunted Commons of England
passed the law of Mortmain, which has since acted as a salutarj check
on abuses of Kingly power.
When Frederick the Great was cn his death-bed, the whole
kingdom resounded with the sob of his sorrowing subjects. To the last
he spoke words of counsel and comfort to his weeping courtiers. Some
of his last sayings are well worthy of record. "When I am dead (he
told his son, Prince Eugene,) "you will find the name of Calais
ergraven on my heart." Then to the Princess Amelia he said,
"Child, when they have cut off my head, they will want to make thee
Queen; but thou must never take the Ciown while thy broJhers,
Charles and James, are alive." To William Wilbebforce, who
was nearly beside himself with grief, he gave his jewelled George,
whi«pering at the same time, "Remember;" and finally, he. desired
that his stepson, the Earl of Warwick, should be sent for, "that he
might see how a Christian could die."
Samuel Johnson, the great Lexicographer and author of Home's
Douglas, was a gallant soldier as well as a kindly critic. In the Bridge-
water Gallery there is a spirited portrait of him by Holbein, dressed
in the Highland garb, with his drawn pibroch in his hand leading on
the clan M'Chattan to the decisive charge at Camperdown.
Perhaps tbe neatest and wittiest repartee ever spoken was contained
in the reply given by an old if udal Baron who had refused to Mlow
Edward the Fifth in one of his exrjeditions against France. "By 'r
Lady, Sir Knight (»wore the King) thou shalt, either go or hang."—
"And by 'r Lady, Sir King, (retorted the witty warrior) I will neither
go nor bang."
It may be a not uninteresting study for some of our young Candidates
| to torn into French or Latin verse the following canzonet by Fitzball.
THE CHILD OF 80NG.
l sk% -blue doves roam forth at night
To seek unhallowed prey,
Thro' Cobomamdel's groves so white
With adamantine spray;
When Cleopatra's sea-green teeth
Disclose a deed of woe,
And Db. Johnson wears a wreath
Of cypress and the sloe;
When Fondicuebry turns his gaze
(Hesperian youth!) to high Parnassus j
And Lindley Murray, crownt d with bay-,
Rides pick-a-back on two jackasses j
Then, fond deceiver, let thy swain
Twine oyster-shells in thy dim tresses,
And die without one pang of pain,
Smothered in beds of water-creases;
And shed one tear upon his grave,
And sighing say to all beholders,
"Here lies a youth both coy and brave,
Who loved cod's head and eke its shoulders."
And let his corpse to earth be borne

Schiller, Longfellow, Lord Cremorne,

A Title to an honourable physician is " the guinea-stamp" to bis reputation.
A Doctor knows the human body as a cabman knows a town—be Is well acquainted
with all the great thoroughfare and small turnings, he is intimate with all the prin-
cipal edifices, but he cannot tell you what is going on inside any one of them.
The Soot and the Pictures.
The only argument for removing the National Gallery to Kensington,
is the necessity of taking the pictures out of the smoke; which would
be a very good argument if there were not plenty of smoke at Ken-
sington Gore. Would not the better plan be to let the pictures
remain where they are, and, by enforcing the consumption of smoke,
take the smoke away from the pictures?

THE CLERK'S PETITION.
Pity the sorrows of a poor old Clerk,
Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door
Whose eyes are gone, his hands too weak to work,
Give him a fair allowance and no more.
No silver-spoon my infant mouth enclosed,
No titled mother hung above my cot,
No lordly godfather his name imposed,
No interest at head-quarters smoothed my lot.
Within yon pile for fifty years I sate,
From ten till four the clerkly pen to ply.
While luckier subs passed o'er my grizzled pate,
And filled the berths, denied to such as L
Year after year, out of my pittance small
They made deductions that I ill could spare:
Upon the plea that when old age should fall,
I might thereby claim a subsistence bare.
The Treasury hard masters seemed to be,
And to the House with hopeful hearts we came,
Deeming with kindlier eye our case 'twould see,
And lend more liberal hearing to our claim.
Vain hope, alas !—the measure you propose
But serves to make our hard lot harder still;
Leave us untouched: we'll bear our present woes,
But save us from the Civil Service Bill.
Less sore the Treasury's hard measures press
Than the stern mercies Parliament extends.
To John Boll's self we'll go in tbe recess,
And next year's Bill for this shall make amends.
HORRIBLE QUESTION AFTER A GREENWICH DINNER.
Foot-Boy. "Ir tod please, Sib, Cook told me to abk you what
Fish you'd like to-day?"
A " Slow Coach" of Legislation.
After a Lecture at Stroud, or somewhere, by Lord
John Russell, on "A Few of the Obstacles which retard
the progress" of something or other, there was a great
confusion and stoppage at the doors on account of the
number of vehicles. A mad wag availed himself of a slight
pause in the prevailing noise, and shrieked out lustily, to
tbe great amusement of the struggling audience :—" Lord
John's Perambulator stops the way!
YE GHOSTS OF THE INNOCENTS. (A BALLAD OF BLACKWALL.)
"Now busk ye, busk ye, my ministeres,
For oh, but the white-bait's fine;
And the loaves and fishes ye love so well,
Are spread for you to dine.
"It's hot, hot, is the Commons' House,
And it's slow, slow, is the Lords'; _
And it's time, I weet, we had sometiiing to eat,
More solid than our words.
"What Bills we might, we have made all right;
What Bills we might not, are sped;
We must drink ' good luck' to the living,
And 'good rest' to the dead."
Oh, a gamesome Lord is Lord Palmerston,
On the steamer, amongst bis feres;
Like a boy out of school, a playing the fool,
With his seely ministeres.
He cracked his joke for the nuisance of smoke,
"Tbink of smoke put down by me!"
He shot his quip at the big, big ship—
"It's like my ministrie.
"For a part may go down, and the passengers
drown,
But the other parts will swim!
Say, is it not so, Bethell, Cowper, andLowE?"
And, I trow, but they looked grim!
So with joke and jeer, at Blackwall Pier,
They have landed, one and all;
And with appetites rare to their dainty fare,
The Ministeres they fall.
And first they ate of the brown fish,
And syne they ate of the white,
And the Punch did flow, and the cool Clicquot,
And the (Eil de Perdrix so bright.
Till even Fred Peel from head to heel,
Felt his red-tape girths grow slack,
And with mirth demure he hugged Panmure,
And clapped Cockburn on the back.
The board it was cleared, dessert appeared,
The waiters were bade to go;
Of the thing that passed, when the doors were
fast,
I speak but what I know.
"Now a health, a health, my ministeres,
To the Session that is o'er:
Ye '11 pledge me a cup to Whiteside;
Ye '11 pledge me a cup to Moore!
"What ails ye, Lord Stanley of Alderley?
Why blench ye, my jovial Lowe?
Why look ye so pile, Sir Benjamin?
And Cowper, why shake ye so f"
"Now nay, now nay, my Lord Palmerstos,"
Sir Richard Bethell he said:
"I trow 'twere best to hold your jest:
'Tis ill-jesting with the dead.
"Look over your shoulders, every one,
And see what.'s standing there!"
Then every guest, beheld aghast,
A grim thing at his chair.
There was never a guest but had his ghost,
His ghost, and some had three:
And by Palmerston's chair was gathered
there
Of ghosts a companie!
Each bleeding sore from a ghastly wound,
And gaping with blue lips chill;
In paper shrouds wide, with the red tape
tied—
Each, the ghost of a little bill!
Agricultural Statistics' ghost
Stood at Lord Stanley's knee;
And two ghosts of small Poor Law Amend-
ments
By the chair of Bouverie.
Straight to his feet Robert Lowe he sprang,
And fearsome his eyes did roll,
For ever, he said, in his brain there rang
The sound of a Passing Toll!
And the .ghost of a slaughtered Partnership
At his ear made a gibbering wail;
While Appellate Jurisdiction's ghost,
Like a Nemesis hovering pale,
On Bet hell's back, gave a grisly crack,
In the form of Lord Wensleydale!
Testamentary Jurisdiction's ghost
Y-clad in a Proctor's gown,
Betwixt the Attorney-General
And Solicitor sat him down.

The Public Health Bill's ghost, all white,
Sat on Cowtkk's back asinde,
And Da. Jknne&'s outraged sprite
Shook a lancet at his side!
And the guests were still, as small voices
shrill
To a wailing choru? grew,
"Look each on the ghost of the Bill he lost,
And under the table threw!"
"How dare ve sit, ye ministeres,

"May our blood rise up on your hustings,
As it embrues your souls:
Even as it lies upon your heads,
May it weigh upon jour polls."
Like a warning knell their voices fell:
They vanished: the guests sat still:
Silently Palmbrston rang the bell,
Silently paid the bill.
Silently from the room they passed,
Silently home were borne;
And sadder, if not wiser men,
They rose the morrow morn!
THE FRENCH DRAMATISTS AT SEA.
Y the aid of English authors,
we are all in a stato of tole-
rable familiarity with the
Modern School of French
Drama, wbieh begins with
a prologue half as long and
quite as important as the
piece itself; but there is
now a rage for two pro-
logues instead of one, and
the last novelty at the
Porte St. Martin, called
Le Fits de la Nuii, is a
drama in live acts, pre-
ceded by a couple of intro-
ductions. When a piece
requires no less than two
preliminary explanations
before there is any chance
of its being understood,
the probability is, that the
drama itself will be doubly
mysterious, and the File de
la Nuit is as dark as its
title indicates. This ob-
scure production is ren-
dered still more ambiguous
by a double claim to the
authorship on the part of
two gentlemen, one of whom is said to have stolen the idea of the
other; but as the other seems to have had no ideas of his own to steal,
the question of theft remains dubious.
Everybody at Paris will, however, go to see the piece, because it
contains a tableau of a Ship at Sea—regularly tossed about on a set of
canvas waves, in true Adelphi style, a pitoe of theatrical navigation
with which English audiences have long been familiar.
The French have, however, been taken by storm, for a storm on the
stage is to them a novel effect, though we are accustomed to the tre-
mendous conflict of sheet iron, the peas, the crash, and all the other
theatrical elements. We are not afraid of the importation of the ship
in full sail, for we have already had that done as well as it can be done
in the Flying Dutchman; but we look with alarm on the system of
prologues, wnich may have the effect of rendering doubly tire-
the tedious importations from Paris, which our stage and our
be said to groan under.

A FEN AMD INK PARLIAMENT.
During the Dog Day?, most people are lazy dogs. Everybody is
yawning in the face of everybody else. The very clergyman yawns in
his pulpit, and his congregation yawn more than usually. All subjects
lose their interest except money, and even upon that conversation
A Queer Young Person.
A L ady's-maid has hitherto been considered of the feminine gender;
but the following advertisement affords a specimen of one who appears

If it is the Lady's-maid, what are its branches P Surely they must
resemble the limbs of a tree.
THE TWO INVALIDS IN PETER 3 BOAT.
It is not true, and we have no patience with those who spread such
foolish reports, that the Bishops op London and Durham are
retiring, simply because they are See-Sick!
QUESTIONABLE HEROES.
If Lord Cardigan is a Hero, then we have aright to ask a question
about an equally oelebrated Tailor, who was not flogged in the Crimea.
Wc wish respectfully to know: "If Smith is a Hero P"
House of Commons, in particular, sinks into a state of most dis-
gusting apathy. It drops measures of the gravest importance as an
old gentleman, nodding after dinner, lets fall bis ileview. The destruc-
tion of these highly desirable and almost necessary bills, we playfully
and good-naturedly denominate the Massacre of the Innocents—as if
it were something funny.
The House ought to get its business over before the Dog Days. It
does not, for want of time. This want of time is occasioned by waste
of time in debate, which is not merely prolix and redundant, but
unnecessary. Oral debate is really altogether unnecessary. We all
know that no one Member is ever convinced by the speech of another.
He has made Ms mind up beforehand on the question, whatever it may
be, and the speech has no effect on him. It is meant for the News-
papers and the country. Then why go through the tedious formality
of reciting- it? Would not the simple publication of it answer its
whole purpose P We propose that the bore of Parliamentary speaking
should be abated; and that debates should, for the future, be conducted
in writing. Thus a great saving of time would be effected. No debate
could occupy more than two nights. On the first night every member
could write what he bad to say on the question before the House. On
the next night the Members could answer each other. Tbis arrange-
ment would be attended with the obvious advantage that all the
Members could be writing at the same time; whereas it is impossible
for a number of people to talk at once, so as to be understood:
although that impossibility is not perceived by all disputants.
The House, according to the plan proposed, would meet merely for
tbe purpose of voting, and of creating opportunities for asking questions
of Government, and receiving Ministerial statements. Members would
thus still be enabled to indulge in talk, and quite talk enough.
To carry out this suggestion, nothing more would be necessary than
to establish a Parliamentary gazette, for tbe publication of tbe debates,
to be sold cheap. The Newspapers would thus no longer be under the
necessity of publishing the dreary columns of prose, inconsequence,
stupidity, twaddle, and humbug, which constitute so much of the
1" utterance of our Collective Wisdom.
The Decimal System.
The Tailors, almost to a fraction, are against the Decimal System.
They contend that, if anything is decimalised, they will be thought of
less then than they are eveanow. They are afraid that instead of its
requiring nine tailors, as at present, to make a man, ten, under the new
method of counting, will probably be required to make up the manly
complement. They intend, therefore, uniting themselves into a body,
or rather a series of bodies, and apposing the tithe of an encroach-
ment on their sartorial rights.

A MAN WITHOUT A NAME.
In these days it is not often that one hears of a gentleman making any
accusation against another on the faith of an anonymous letter; and in-
deed the waste-paper basket is usually the immediate destination of such
a dastardly document. We, however, hare an exception to the general
rule in the conduct of Sir James Graham, who, on no better authority
than an anonymous letter, made a statement against somebody or
other, which statement was shown by Mr. Wilson, the Secretary to
the Treasury, to involve a simple impossibility. During the experience
of Sir James Graham at the Post Office, he surely had an opportunity
of ascertaining the true value of letters, and especially those of the
anonymous sort, with the contents of which he may occasionally have
become familiar. It is true that when the worthy Baronet was at the
head of the Post Office, the department was said to have contributed
occasionally to the political information of the Government; but it is
not surprising that some serious mistakes should have been made, if
anonymous communications were ever relied upon. We were glad to
perceive that the anonymous authority cited by Sir James Graham
was immediately demolished; for we feel it to be a general principle,
that any one who writes a letter to which he dares not put his name
will have nothing worth attention to communicate.
A Fine Opening for a Nice Young Swindler.
A Juvenile spendthrift, who had spent all his money, and more than
that, had covered himself with bills and dishonour, upon being asked
what he should do, coolly made answer, "I have but two remedies left
open to me—either to go to Sweden, or else get into Parliament."
I An Admiralty Amenity.— Bernal Osborne says, "It's my
i belief that Eked. Peel would have invented Red Tape, supposing
I there had been none in the world, previous to his taking office."
A BENEVOLENT EMPEROR.
When we hear of a professional philanthropist, we sometimes
wonder if he always pays his washerwoman. It is not needful for the
philanthropist, like the physician, to walk hospitals for his diploma; for
it is wonderful, if he will only try it, how very good a man may be,
and how very few people may know it. We begin to lose hope of
Alexander of Russia, now English statesmen begin to praise him for
bis benevolence. Do we not bear a brain? Must we not remember
how Nicholas, of imperishable memory, had a twenty years' character
for moderation; and, upon such character, must we not recollect how
greatly he imposed upon the mild temperament of the Earl or
Aberdeen, to come blazing out, like a brigand in a new suit before
all Europe P
Lord Lyhdhurst—may the fates continue to spin his web finely and
evenly as his own eloquence!—made a forlorn hope speech in favour of
Poland. What of SarmatiaP How was the Emperor of all thb
Russias affected towards a bruised, a bleeding victim; galled with
Russian iron, scourged with Russian cords P
Well, the Earl of Clarendon would say this for the Emperor op
Russia—he was a most benevolent man. Ha had expressed himself
with considerable kindness; indeed, even with interest, towards
Poland. Had he not told the Poles to put away all "delusions?"
They were in chains, and they were not to think to daoce, to cut capers
in them. Thus, we may leave Poland to the benevolence of the son, as
she was left to the moderation of the father. Never were people so
moderately outraged or so beneficently plundered!
THE CHARACTER OP THE SESSION.
The farewell speech of Palmehston was not reported. On taking
leave of his friends, and a large number of Members, he said, as he
darted smilingly out of the House,—" Gentlemen, to our next merry
meeting."

A ZEAL NOT ACCORDING TO KNOWLEDGE.
he Morning Star (in
some respects not
a bad pennyworth,
though, at present, a
little fidgety and snob-
bish) is as bitter upon
allmilitary subjects as
its Manchester and
American proprietors
can desire. No police-
man can be more sar-
castic against the sol-
diery, when he has
caught a Life-Guards-
man making love to
the cook. But per-
haps it would be as
well if the Star would
in some slight degree master of its theme. Just now, as may be inferred
from the following extract, it has confused notions touching the weapons of war.
Speaking-of the Aldershott affray; the Star says :—
"The Germans made not the least attempt to desist from hostilities, but, on the oontrary, seemed
to.show every disposition to carry on the deadly warfare. The cavalry then charged the men by the
point of the bayonet, and an orderly galloping up between the belligerent parties, succeeded in
scattering them."
The pious writer,-who is aware, we see, that cavalry are "mounted" troops,
should ask himself—no, because then he will probably get a silly answer—but one
of his housemaids, who is sure to be "up" in soldiering, how a mounted cavalry
man can charge wit h a bayonet. Not of course that such ignorance injures his
brilliant logic, or interferes with his playfulness, as witness nis account of the
Aldershott review:—
"The weather was gloomy and unfavourable, bnt that [only gave the warriors an opportunity, uv
should wppoee, of contending against the elements."
Never mind, go on. "Twinkle, twinkle, Utile Star." By the way, when will
the Stars, Morning and Evening, add the Stripes to their insignia, m honour of
'and slavery's, Mb. Buchanan?

A NEW SCHOOL OE THE DRAMA.
Oun new system of examination for public employment
has lately been adopted in France—not with reference to
places under Government, but in the disposal of theatrical
engagements of the lower grade, and a smart competition
has just been concluded at the Theatre Lyrique for two or
three vacant situations in the choruses. Beyond the mere
trial of the voice, the examination must involve a series of
rather odd experiments with daggers and drinking-cups, and
the candidates would probably De called upon to show how
they can quaff theatrioil tow, commit a dramatic murder,
carry a property banner, and assume a look of happiness
peculiar to a contented and loyal peasantry. We often
wonder how an aspirant to supernumerary honours pursues
his studies at home, and how he practises allegiance, fealty,
rebellion, and all the other various attributes which con-
stitute the character of a professional chorus-singer. As
the employes of the French Government have in fact little
else to do but to join in a sort of official chorus, and repeat
evict 1 v what is set down for them, there is, after all, a sort
of analogy between examinations for the subordinate places
in a theatre, and for situations under Government.

A WONDER AT WALTHAMSTOW.
As interesting experiment on public credulity was tried the other
day on the British Public, by means of the following letter, which a
wag, signing himself W. Clayton, addressed to the Times.
"Sir,—A curious specimen in natnral history has for the last month kept the
neighbourhood of WaltbamBtow and Leyton, in the greatest wonder and excitement.
In a-pond adj lining the Lea Bridge Road, on the premises of Mr. F. Babcliy, ' where
some hundreds of people have visited,' has been heard, quacking similar to that of a
duck.
"On Saturday evening a gentleman seeing something ripple across the water, he
struok it with a large stick, after which nothing further was beard. Mb. A. Fubdhaji,
who was present at the time, visited the pond at 4-o'clock on Sunday morning, and, on
clearing aside some of the weeds, found, nearly dead, a fine specimen of the orni-
thorynoas, or duck-billed platypus, which is now in the possession of Mb. \V. Mobbis,
naturalist, Leyton."
We were not aware that the duck-billed platypus resembled a duck
in quacking as well as in having a bill, and cannot help considering the
statement to that effect, as giving the whole of the above narrative an
i air of quackery. A duck-billed platypus is a creature not likely to be
allowed to escape from a menagerie, and still less likely to have dropped
I from the clouds. We are therefore inclined to regard the duck-like
animal in question as that sort of duck which is generally understood
i by the term canard; a species of duck which is believed in by nobody
| except a goose.
Hideous News.
The Calcutta Englishman is determined to frighten us out of our
senses. It says,
"At Sreekond some 4,000 or 5,000 Santhals have collected for a re-adjustment of
their Jummabs, and the Amlah, to the detriment of all other business, are busy
writing out new pottahs."
In utter terror and despair, we ask, what is to be done? What can
we get, what shall we send, what can we do? What'» a iummab,
what are amlahs, what arc pottahs? Would the hanging Mb. Vernon
Smith be any use as a preliminary measure P Do the people want fire
engines, or subscriptions, or tracts? Let us know what to do—it is a
shame to send such messages without a hint of their meaning.

Why buy Nutmegs on the 25th July?
Because it's the day of St. James the Grater.
MITRES FULL OF MONEY.
It is really quite shocking to read the abuse of the Established
Church and its Apostolic Ministry in which the low democratic journals
are accustomed to indulge. What a mercenary spirit is insinuated as
actuating the clergy in the following painful paragraph extracted from
the Morning Post:—
"Let the experiment be tried. Let a Bishopric be offered to one of the best scholars,
theologians, and parish priests of tbe day—find a picked candidate, and give him the
chance of a mitre, with £3,600 and residence now, and £5,000 after a few years, with a
pension of £1,500 when past work—wlU he refuse it? or will he work the less faithfully
because of the diminished pay?"
Will he refuse it P Of course he will. He will say that the money
is a great deal too much, the number of nearly starving curates at
present existing, that is, contriving to exist, in the Church being con-
sidered. There is not one of our best scholars, theologians, and
parish priests, who would accept a bishopric with a remuneration so
extravagant attached to it—who would not wave off the proffered
mitre with the determination and disgust of a teetotaller declining a
brandy-bottle.
One of the Benefits of Journalism.
In addition to the innumerable other valuable blessings conferred by
a civilised Press, we may ask how would that large and untractable
race of testy, restless, frumpish, surly old gentlemen, who have nothing
to do, be able to get through the day without the aid of the Newspaper P
It is the only occupation they have—it is the solitary thing that
keeps them quiet—it is the one talisman that prevents them from grum-
bling perpetually, morning, noon, and evening.

"Whoever dares this boot displace,
Must meet BOMBAstu face to face."
A BLOW FOR THE BASONS OF ENGLAND.
We wonder the Peerage has not taken alarm at the intro-
duction of a Bill for the abolition of the office of Curaitor
Baron of the Exchequer. The pretext for sweeping away
the Barony by act of Parliament is simply that there was
nothing for the Barou to do except to make a ridiculous
speech once a-year on introducing the Lord Mayor and
Sheriffs to the Judges at Westminster. This is really a
dangerous precedent; for if every Baron may be got rid of
and utterly done away with, if he is only heard of when he
makes a ridiculous speech, there are several members of
the Peerage who might be swept away in the most summary
manner. We are really astonished that the Lords have not
protested against the measure in question; for there is
something so sacred in the mere name of aristocracy, that
even the Barony of Nathan ought not to be lightly
touched, at least in the opinion of those who consider that
no title can be abolished without putting the Constitution
in jeopardy.
The Recorder deserves to be thanked in the name of
common sense for recommending that the introduction
of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs should be effected
by some shorter method than "a ridiculous speech," and
his proposal to do the business by a short "aside " to the
usher of the Court is certainly preferable to the old plan,
which put the world in possession of the biography of every
tradesman who had attained to shrievai dignity in the
Metropolis. Nobody cares to know that the new Sheriff
besides being a tailor or cutler, as the case may be, is also
an architect and builder; by virtue of his having been the
architect of his own fortunes.
These tiresome anecdotes of the private life of a new
Sheriff will henceforth be whispered into the ears of the
ushers in Westminster Hall, who may, if they please, retail
the memoirs over their evening beer at the Checkers, for
the enlightenment of the parlour company. Nails are no
longer to be counted, nor are sticks to be chopped, and
Mb. Wortley has certainly hit the right nail on the head
by proposing to do away with the former process, while in
throwing the hatchet away he has got rid of a most
ridiculous fiction.

troop of the 4th Dragoon Guards, under the direction of Colobbl de Bathe.
u Carlton Lodge, Rmte/ract, July 22. "Chables Wood."
Let us endeavour to analyse this wonderful piece of composition.
The writer states that he thinks it well that certain circumstances

should be known. Those circumstances are, that a certain person,
being in the receipt of a military pension, had been drilling certain
rebels during a little time, and had, on the night before he drilled them,
marched a given number of them, armed with sundry weapons, to a
stated place, in. the expectation of there meeting all the disaffected
inhabitants of a district named, who had concerted an attack on a
specified town which was occupied by so many companies of such a
regiment, together with a late gallant officer's troop, belonging to
another regiment; the whole of these forces being under the command
of another gallant officer. The historian of these circumstances has
reasons for his opinion that it is well they should be known. These
reasons are; firstly, his having observed that an honourable Member
had given notice of a question relative to the liberation of the persons
convicted of the crime above described; secondly, that hp, with the
assistance of two other men, respectively the tenants of a nobleman and
a gentleman, apprehended, on the high road, the man in the receipt of
the Serjeant's pension, another pensioner, and one man more; thirdly,
that thirty-six years have elapsed since the occurrence of these events.
How such reasons account for such an opinion, will not, perhaps, be
quite so clear to the majority of people as appears to be supposed by the
resident of Carlton Lodge; which, from his style, one would infer to be
a porter's lodge, or the abode of a gamekeeper.
We shall pursue this subject no further, for the attempt to elucidate
incoherence, and to explain rigmarole has cost us a headache.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.'
N ignominious Session
was brought to an igno-
minious end on Tues-
day, July the Twenty-
ninth. Her Majesty,
whoopened Parliament,
felt, in common with ber
subjects, far too much
disgusted with its pro-
ceedings, to close it, and
had retired to the Isle
of Wight. The Houses
had met on the previous
Saturday, but the only
thing done that is worth
recording wa«, that the
Commons compelled the
Lords to give way, and
to re-insert, in the
Hampstead Heath Bill,
the clause for discomfit-
ing Sir Tommy Wil-
son. On the Monday
neither House met, but
at two on Tuetday, a
good many ladies and other spectators having assembled in the House of
Lords, five Commissioners, looking as much like five Guys as possible,
took their seats btfore the throne, and the Royal Assent was given to
a preat lot of Bills, chiefly measures of no general interest.
Lord Chancellor Cbanworth then advanced, and was about to
read some ridiculous paper, when Loss Chancellor Punch politely
shoved him out of the way, and, bowing blandly to bis delighted
audience, read as follows, in a load and distinct tone of voice :— .
"My Lords and Gentlemen,
"We are commanded by Her Majesty to relieve ber subjects from
the annoyance of further Parliamentary exhibitions for some months
to come.
"When Her Majesty met you in Parliament at the opening of the
Session, we were at War. Yon certainly voted away other people's
money in unhesitating style for carrying on that War, and in doing so,
you gave satisfaction to the nation.
"A Peace was patched up, and a treaty was signed by which Her
Majesty's subjects gained nothing at all, and out of the engagements
of which Russia is already skulking.
"We are squabbling with America, but to fight her, unless compelled
to do so, would be absurd, and if we can protract negotiation, and if
Colonel Fremont, the only decent candidate for the Presidentship,
should be elected in November, Her Majesty may not have to
announce to you in February, that we have captured New York or
lost Liverpool.
"Her Majesty regrets to inform you that the bad and foolish
woman on the throne of Spain has lent herself to a sanguinary plot for
crushing freedom, which has succeeded, and Her Majesty's august
ally, the Emperor of the French, is concentrating troops, and pre-
paring fleets, and will probably have annexed Spain to France before
Her Majesty has the pleasure of seeing you again.
"Her Majesty's Ministers have been exceedingly well snubbed
by King Bomba, and Lord Palmerston has every hope that the
developement of events in Italy will shortly justify the placing that
country under the dominion of the King of Sardinia, as Her
Majesty's Viceroy.
"It is not improbable that Her Majesty will have to blow Brazil
to blazes for the benefit of the Blacks.
"Foreign affairs being upon this highly satisfactory footing, Her
Majesty turns to subjects of domestic legislation.
"Not one of the measures which were recommended to you in the
Speech from the Throne, in January, have you been good enough to
pass, with the exception of an Act for assimilating mercantile law in
England and Scotland, and a Joint-Stock Companies Bill. When Her
Majesty adds that you have passed a bill for improving the Coast
Guard, and the Country Police, and have somewhat improved the
University of Cambridge, the Queen bos summed up the results of
88 days in this House, and 106 in the Commons.
vol. xxxi. e
"Her Majesty would like to know what you have been and done
with the Partnership Bill, with the Local Frauds on Shipping Bill, with
the Church-rates Bill, with the Church Discipline Bill, with the Edu-
cation Bill for England, with the Education Bill for Scotland, with the
Ecclesiastical Courts Bill, with the Divorce Bill, with the Public
Health Bill, with the Agricultural Statistics Bill, with the London
Corporation Reform Bill, with the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill, with
the Civil Service Superannuation Bill, with the Jew Bill, with the
Wife's Sister.Bill, and with the Vaccination Bill.
"Gentlemen op the House op Commons,
"Her Majesty's opinion, and that of Her Majesty's subjects,
is that out of the 170 of you who have taken prominent part in the
debates, nine-tenths ought to have followed the example of the 273
who have not spoken a word during the Session.
"My Lords and Gentlemen,
"Her Majesty's Ministers ought to be ashamed of themselves for
having utterly failed in their duty. Her Majesty's Opposition ought
to be ashamed of themselves for not having compelled them to do it,
and both ought to be ashamed of the utterly unconstitutional precedent
set iu the retention of office by a Cabinet without principles or power.
"This sort of thing will not do again. Deposit that hint in the
bowls of your respective pipes, and fumigate it.
"You may go."
Parliament then dispersed, and Mr. Punch, with a pleasure which it
would be too much trouble, this hot weather, to describe, put the
stopper, once more, into the crystal phial containing his
CslScncc of ^parliament.

FACTS OF DOMESTIC INTEREST.
We are sufficiently tormented, as it is, with rates and taxes 'though
few, except housekeepers, know what rates and taxes are. The dis-
inclination to acquire this knowledge must strongly tend to make every
reflecting young man afraid to marry and settle; and the fear of
entering into the domestic state may, in some cases, be heightened by
the perusal of the following official paragraph:—
"The marriage rate, which was low, is now slightly above the average rate; the
birth rate is high, and the death rate is low, so that the state of the population, in the
light of these returns, is favourable."
However, the affectionate but thinking youth, desirous of the position,
but dreading the responsibilities, of a husband and a father, must not
be superfluously alarmed by the above statement. Married persons, as
such, are not rated to the parish higher than anybody else, and not so
high as some other people. There is no rate to pay on births beyond
the tax involved in the hire and maintenance of nurses dry or wet,
those necessary nuisances. The pecuniary death rate, over and above
burial fees, consists simply in the monstrous exaction on the part of
undertakers, to which the wise and the few are compelled to submit by
the tyranny of custom, imposed by the melancholy ostentation and
irrational sentiment of the foolish and the many.
The paragraph in question, which is copied from the Quarterly
Return of tbe Registrar-General, simply means to say that marriages are
a little on the increase—in the face of the Income-tax, and in spite of
the high price of provisions; and that, whereas the necessity for cradles
is great, there is only a moderate demand for ceflius.;

JOCKEYS FOR THE LADY'S PLATE.
E find our e'egant con-
temporary Le Follet de-
scribing a dinner dresp,
and coi cludine i*s de-
tails— too complicat. d
for the comprtheieronrif
the masculine mind, and
therefore for quotation
—with the following
item:—
"Sleeves with three jock-
eys, each drawn upln froutof
the arm with a bow."
What an alarm irg
featureinthe "Fashions
for Augu-t" to gentle-
men who are blest with
fashionable wives! One footman, to stand behind a lady's chair, has been
generally considered as constituting sufficient attendance for the lady; but now
it seems that she cannot dine, in correct style, without having three servant*, and
those jervants jockeys, at her eloow! For that must surely be the situation
indicated by the "front of the arm with a bow,"—a periphrasis quite conceivable
on the part nf the writer, who was doubtless a foreiguer, and put "front of
the arm" for "back of the arm," by mistake. It can hardly be understood that
the jockeys are drawn up on horseback; although there certainly appear to be no
limits to fashionable extravagance, and the inconvenience imposed by fashion.
Nor can we conceive that piofetsimal jockeys are intended, since those who are
hand and glove with gentlemen, would hardly condescend to wait behind ladies.
We conclude that the jockeys are mere Johnnies, attired in the cap, jacket,
leathers, and light tops, so much more suitable to Ine season, and s > much less
ridiculous in themselves, than the powder, the shoulderknot, the flaring coat,
the lliming waistcoat, and the glowing plush which have hitherto embelli-bed and
encumbered Joan Thomas. The only particular, besides dress, in which these
jockeys would at all resemble the others, would be that of running for a plate;

but in order to start for the plate of soup, or fish, or meat,
no conditions as to weight would be neoessaiy, since the
jockeys would not have to be prepared for the saddle—
ine only saddle they would ever have to go imo being a
-addle of mutton. Indeed, such jockejs a> these would
never entertain the idea of wasting any fl-sh but that con-
sume'! in the servants'hall; and no earthly cons'deration
would probably induce one of them to go voluntarily into
ti awing.
SONG OF THE CIVIL SERVANTS.

To dream of £ *. d,;
In vain may Civil Servants groan
O'er cruel charity.

And who shall answer "Nay P"

Make right a reasoned wrong P
Uprouse ye then—each grasp his pen,
And be your elbows strong.
Te'l them who share official fat,
Who'd rob you of your lean,

His Civil Servants mean.
Ask them who thus play fast and loese,

BISHOPS AND CURATES.
Wherefore should our respee'ed contemporary, the Times, give
circulation to the complaints of " Agneish Curates" and such invalids P
Were tbey consigned to a Palace of Pleasure, they would grumble
that the Palace was not Paradise. Why cannot such people leave poor
Doctor Blomfiuld alone, calm and meditative in his Fulham
hermitage? We have it on the authority of the Bishop of Oxford—
a man who no doubt loathes lucre as the root of evil—that the Bishop
of London had all his life shown "an almost heroic indiffe-euce o*
money." Wiih £22,000 a-year, Charles James Blomfield despised his
income; taking his yearly thousands even as a martyr would take his
stripes. Well, the worthy man has consented to grub on—the phrase
is homely, but so are the aspirations of the Fulham anchorite—upon six
thousand a-year clear of Palace rei.t; and straightway every beans and
bacon-red curate hag a fling at the incarnate humility.
A curate—"an Agueish curate "—wishes to know of the Times, if
curates in general "may look forward for some provision when age and
disease have incapacitated them from further labours?" There is
disaffection, insolence in the very question. This curate for twenty
years folded the sheep of two curacies. "Tbey were separated by a
hedge-row." and too pastor was "exposed to the pestilential atmo-
sphere of E«ex Marshes." And the curate sums up the case of bishop
and curate as below :—
"To a bishop who has had his labours sweetened by all that life can give of comfort,
luxury, and highest dignity,—a palace and JEAOOO per annnm.
** To a curate who, for 80 years, shall have done his devoir before Goi and man, till
broken witb miamnatic fever, or voiceless from excess of oral exertion, he is obliged
to confess his iuabiliiy to be any longer faithful In his oalUug,—the workhouse."
And is it not well that it should be so P A curate on £100 a-year,
and soaking with a marsh ague, shaking, and praying, and teaching the
waile, is still a lively representative of the ancient Christian; is still a
living extract from the New Testament. Now a bishop, with £22,000
per annum, and if shaking, shaking with the fat of the land, is, as >ar
as oar reading goes, cot to be found >n the volume to which we have
reverently alluded. The blue nose and w>iite face of an agueish onrate
may, possibly, look better even to the angels than the purple and Que
linen of epiacopus. Again, the retired bishop has six thousand a-year
and his palace; the cura e his nothing aud his workhouse; but this
nothing, this very workhouse, bring out in time the elements of
Christianity, humility, patience, resignation. It is necessary that these
contrasts should be. For let us only for a minute consider the matter;
what would become of Christianity if only vindicated by the wealth
and luxury of bishops—what, indeed, were it not illustrated and
preached by the poverty and the suffering of curates?
A QUESTION FOR THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL.
"My Dear Mr. Punch,
"You would oblige me greatly, Sir, by informing me, if you
can, what are those more salubrious spots than H stings, Brighton, the
Isle of Wight, &c, alluded to by the IUgistrah-General. The
victim of indigestion, flatulence, heartburn, giddiness, singing in the
ears, deafness, constantly recurring nausea, chronic rheumatism,
frequent gout, and occasional erysipelas,—I have resorted to them all
in tue ineffectual puisuit of health. At most of them, indeed, I have
obtained occasional relief from my sufferings, but that only by sub-
mission to a sort of privation which I consider to be the opprobrium of j
the Faculty. My appetite has seldom been impaired—on ihe contrary, j
it has generally been, by the majority of my medical attendants,
pronounced excessive. A mitigation of my afflictions has occasionally
b- en purchased by a painful renunciation of the delights of the table.
But what system of medicine is it, and what sort of a place is it whereby
and whereat health can only be restored on these hard conditionsP
Tell me, dear Mr. Punch, which are those favoured localities still more
beneficial, still more bracing, than those which the Registrar-General
has enumerated. Tell me, if you can, only where one of those
happy regions is situated; tell me where, Sir, tell me where: and
thither will I fly, that, without abjuring butter, without renouncing
sauce and gravy, without resigning my bottled stout and ale, without
sacrificing my bottle of port, but being enabled to enjoy my soup and
fish, my joint, my little subsidiary delicacies, my dessert, and my glass
of wine, in addition to my nice breakfast and relishing bit of lunch, in
short to eat and drink whatever I please, I may pass a tranquil and
contented existence delivered from those ills which flesh is heir to, or
which, if doctors tell the truth, the unpleasant truth, are acquired
principally by excess and errors in diet, and, owing to the poverty of the
resources of medical science, are as yet irremediable except by retrench-
ment and. abstinence. Tell me but this, Punch, and I shall daily quaff
a delicious draught to your health as sincerely and regularly as I now
drain a bitter one for my own. 1 shall then, dear Punch, be your ever-
grateful as well as your humble servant,

THE WEATHER.
HE heat last week was so in-
tense that Madame Tussaud's
Collection narrowly escaped
being dissolved as well as
Parliament. Several of the
greatest celebrities have bad
bags of ice applied to their
temples to prevent them
melting away. Prince
Albert in his hot Coronation
robes, falling over his bcau'iful
tigh'-fitting costume of a Field
Marshal, suffers from the heat
fearfully—so much so that, to
avoid a national calamity, it
has been found expedient to j
stand him upright, with each
leg in an ice-pail. The King
or Naples, during the last
ten days, has lost full eleven
pounds of the best Italian
wax, and this is looked upon
as the greatest wonder of all,
as it was'thinght no thing in
the world would have melted
him. A tear, also, which was
seen tricklhgdown the cheeks
of the Bishop of Exktbb, has

THE BEAUTY AND THE BLACK
MAN.
{A Genteel Version of a Popular Song)
In London Town, on the Western side,
Lived a Daughter of Rank—years back, man;
Her lily white hand she a Swell demtd,
And sold it to a Black Man.
Thoueh the Swell Cove pleased her^ight,
And her heart was inclined that way, man.
Yet she ihouaht by day, and she dreamt, by ni«rht,
More of Blacky's great wealth aud display,
man.
The
A GENUINE PORTION OP THE ROYAL SPEECH.
It is commonly supposed that Speeches from the Throne are always entirely the
composition of tho Queen's Ministers. We are enabled to state that this supposition is not
qui'e correct. The first paragraph of the Speech; read by the Lord Chancellor, at the
Prorogation of Parliament last week,'is couched in the terms ensuing :—
"MY I.OBDS and Gentlemen,
"We mre commanded by Heb Majesty to release you from further attendance in Parliament, And at the
game time f" express to yon her warm acknowledgments for the zeal and assiduity with which you have applied
yourselves to the discharge of your public duties during the Session."
"We may safely say that this paragraph was not dictated by the Premier, but proposed,
if not dictated, to that noble Lord. It was read to him in a certain silvery tone of voice,
accompanied by a gracious smile. Loud Palmerston, having considered ir, for a moment,
replied with suppressed emotion, of a risible nature, that he humhly thought it admirable.
It is a pity that the remainder of the Speech was not conceived in the same happy vein,
and that, cansis'ently with warmly acknowledging the zeal and assiduity of Parliament in
general terms, the Qceen h?d not been allowed to congratulite the Legislature, in detail,
on the results of its earnest industry, as exhibited in the enactment of sundry important
measures, which it was caled upon to settle. For instance, the Royal Lady might have
thanked her Lords and Commorjs for that Divorce Bill, so long and so grievously desidera'ed
for the relief and deliverance of so many of her poor unhappy lieges; 'or the abatement of a
gross imposition tffcctrd by that urgently called for Local Dues on Shipping Act; and for;
the just boon, at length accorded to small capitalist, in the Act for Partneiship Amendment.
Her Majesty might, also have expressed her vast delight at the sa'isfac »rv solution arrived
at by her faiihful Lords and Commons, between them, of the Ap^ella'e Jurisdiction Bill.
We have no hesitation in expressing our belief, that if our gracious Sovereign had been
the author of the whole Speech, the sequel of it would have been consistent with the
beginning.
MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH A VENGEANCE.
A writer in the Westminster Review proposes to treat offending Ministers like ordinary
criminals, aad 'o hurry off a Secretary of Sta'e to the station-house iu t he custody of a police-
man, if the said S.cretary, in his ministerial c?pacity, should have dote anything that would
be injurious to the commouwesltb. If such a suggestion should be acted on, the lire of a
Cabinet Minister would be passed in being dragged backwards aud forwards be'ween Downing
Street and the We*t iinster Police Court, varitd by occasional iuteiviews with Ma. Solomons,
or one of the other 1-arned gentlemen to whom p isoners are in the habit of entrusting their
defences. We should he having the public busintsi brought to a stand-still by the absence
of one or more of the Members, in consequence of their beiDg under remind on some criminal
charge; and we should have the Premier asking the House to con-ent to the postponement
of the Budget in consequence of the Chancellor of the Exchiqoer beiDg obliged to
give t»ent>-four hours' notice of bail before he cou'd be relea-ed from custody.
Though we are strongly in favour of ministerial responsibility, we are not prepared to
consent to the plani recommended by the Westminster Review, for if eve>y fLming patriot who
thinks he can goven the country better for,no'hing than it is no* uone bya cos'ly administra-
tion, could give a Minister in charge for neglect of duty, the Members of the Cbinet wr-.uld
be eooti ually in fh<? hands of the policeman. We should line to know what punishment
it is proposed to inflict 01 Ministers of State; whether they are to be fined or imprisoned, with
or without ha d labuur, and whether a neglect of the common weal is to be expiated on a
common wheel at Brix on.
Swell was a soldier, and wore Albert's
hat:
Still of dressing he had the knack, man;
Correct, as to gloves, and boots, and all that;
Which was not the ca«e with the Black Man.
At his shape in the glass he gaz°d with p ide,
Attirtd in the neatest array, man;
And he lo' ked as he marched with a graceful
stride,
A hero so gallant and gay, man.
The Black Man was some five feet h'gh,
A little, narrow-backed man;
She liked h'm mote than the Swell—for why?
Ho was twice—five hundred million times—as
rich, was the Black Man.
His face was like a deep mourner's clothes,
More like the n'ght thau the day, man;
His eyes they sparkled as much as his nnse,
And his mind wasn't brighter they say, man.
The handsome Swell did not des
He was a tip-top crack man.
Said he, 1 knosv—I am qui'e aware—
1 am not so rich as the BUck Man;
Bul white for black no love can feel,
Sncti a girl to sell is a shame, man:
I thmk I'm rather more genteel
Than the Blackamoor what 's-his-name, man?
Says she, My parents approve the match,
Because the cwh you iack, man;
I can't re'u«e so splendid a catch,
Tnough I go to church with a black mai.
Says he, Scratch that catch out of jour head;
By his weight in gold don't weigh man:
You '11 fiud i'. better a Swell to wed,
And say the Blackamoor Nay, man.
Said she, If truly my mind I tell,
To losi you my feelings may rack, man,
But really there is such means, my Swell,
Belonging to that Black Man:
You can't think how my heart you pain,
When you draw it another way, man.
Says the Swell, Not so bad as the thought of the
stain
On the brow of that half-baked black clay man.
Talk of a person—he's sure to cone;
The drawing-room door here flew hack, man,
And there s'o id the Native, an ebjee'. rum,
And the Swell looked blue, at the BlacK Man.
Says the Black, That lady likes jou, I see,
Very well; and so she may, man,
But 1 think she '11 be rather inclined to wed me,
As I offer the better pay, man.
The Swell, at first was mortified,
Swn, hnwever, his courage came back, man;
Tiie Fair Oue throuah his glass he cjed,
Aud also examined the Black Man;
He stard, and smiled, and rai-ed b's chin,
Snys she—Oil! leave me—away, man!
And, clinching his priz5 with a hurrid grin,
The B ack said, This is my prey, man!

NURSING THE LITTLE BILLS.
Where the sad sea-wave doth roar and
rave,
With a long and low-drawn moan,
Round weed-clad rock, and tide-worn cave,
There walketh Palmerstone.
No nst, e'en here, from toil teverc,
The statesman's leisure fills—
Not for his ease he seeks the breeze,
The briny freshness of the seas—
lie's here to tend his bills!
"He's here to tend his bills—and I,
For what else am I here?"
Methinks I biar each Briton cry,
Who walketh Brighton pier—
"The bills to long—the charges stiong,
Week after week brought in,
At lodging-house, or at ho'el,
Which items raise and extras swell,
To such a sight of tin!"
"Be still, my irjured country-man;
Thy bills, I know, are long:
I kuow they fleece thee where they can—
The ocean's harpy throng!
Each weekly bill, with sudden chill,
IJpon the purse may fall,
But weaklier bills hath Palmerstone,
Than e'er at Brighton or Boulogue
Did visitor appal.
"Wherefore," I ask, "t his daily task?
Sad man, what sin is thine!—
While others lounge and yawn and bask
By the health-giving brine-
Why toilest thou, with furrowed brow,
Dragging this dreary load,
This feeble rout, while, all about-,
More healthy children romp and shout,
And in glad miith explode f"
"Stranger," replied that man sad-eyed,
That Beedy Miuistere—
"These pallid babes, withered tape tied
Each in his go-catt here,
Are Bills, I ween, that should have been
Ete this passed into Law,
But which to save from early grave
I wa», alas, compelled to crave
Permission to withdraw.
A dreary lot is mine, I wot,
With such a sickly crew,
And oft I feel that, 1 am not
The man such work to do.
But place is place, and power is power,
And Bills must be brought hi,
And when a gcod one can't be had,
One n:ust be satisfied with bad,
Credit to try and win!
The helpless little ones you see—
Heaven help 'em—are not mine:
Their parents lelt them here with me,
While thf y 're off to the Ithine,
To Italy—the Highland bills—
Wisbaden,—Lord knows where—
Am! 1 must stay and make their bills
Pit, when next Session London fills,
As measures to appear!"
SOME ODD PISH TO FRY.
Among the Companies that the Act for
Limited L'ability has bef n the means of
introducing to the public, is a London
Fishing and Fish Manure Company. The
prospectus includes the names of some
resptctable persons, who of course know
what they are about, but, we must confess
that we have been rather puzzled as to
where a London Fishing Company is to
carry on its operations, and what are the
Fish which are likely to be caught in
this Metropolis. There are some persons
who hold that" all is fish which comes to
their net," and if the promoters of the
Company in question tuke the same view,
the supply of materials for London Fish-
ing operations will be quite exuberant.
There are alwajs a number of flat fish
floating about town who might be useful
to a company in want of shareholders;
hut we presume that those are not the
kind of fish that the promoters of the
concern alluded to will desire. A hand-
some capital is to be provided, but
nothing is yet said as to how the money is
to be laid out; and we would suggest
therefore a heavy investment in sprats,
which may be used for the purpose of
catching herrings, while a small sum
might be devoted to the purchase of a
tub to be thrown to a whale, should
such a fish turn up in the courts of
the proceedings of the London Com-
pany.

THE FASHIONS FOR AUGUST. (BY ROSA matilda.)
Oh how shall we sing of the Fashions
For August, when dogs have their day?
They are off, in their summer excursions,
All those who o'er Fashion hold sway.
They are climbiog the mighty Swiss mountains,
They are pacing the ocean's wild shore,
Q iaffiog Baden's orKreutznach's salt fountains,
Where the couleuren vogue'& "rougeet noir."
No more in hot Paris I '11 linger,
On the deso'ate Boulevards astray;
Of the rules of La mode a glad siDger,
To the sea and the mountains away!
Let me fly, like the emigrant swallow,
Wiio chases the sun round the globe,
Like a Will-o'-the-wisp, or Veu Toilet,
To throw lights upon mantle and robe.
L'Amazone de Ville now a la mode it,
On t he mountain and glacier serene;
With basquettes a la Hussarde, the boddiee
Joim tne skirt of silk-b/oidered nankeen.
With brandcbourgs matching the galons
On the edge of the basques, faites en queue;
To which, for the rude Alpine salons,
■ Add a cambric embroidered fichu.
Gold buttons, the better the bigger,
On the cuffs a la Chevaliere;
A c avat with broad nceuds is de rigeur,
And a bat of Swiss straw crowns the hair.
By the Ocean's tremendous expanse,
White quilting peignoirs are worn still,
Or robes en mille rates, a La France,
With lasquines of embroidered coutil.
For negliges de bain, you will find,
Robes de chambre wit h velvet revers,
That form a round collar behind,
With ends crossed in front, are the wear.
While for promenade en jardin or park,
Nought the charming nansook can excel,
And en chapeaux, we 're bound to remark,
The sweet jaconet cap'line Estelle.
The mantelet echarpe, of white tulle,
For walks in the bright summer mi
With one flounce excessively full,
And a narrow silk fringe, is much 1
And still in our toilettes de bal,
Light materials are used for the skirt,
Pink aod white tarlatanes, most of all,
With low body and long-pointed berths.
While plain-coloured mu«lins thi3 year
Are the rage for a demi toilette,
Rice-straw bonnets in favour appear,
With bouquets of pink daisies set.
On the one side a nceud of white blonde,
On the other a bunch of wild rose,
Hound the crown en cache peigne, a, la ronde,
A clematis wreath should repose.
Fruit is still much en vogue for coiffures;
We have seen one with barbes of black lace,
—(The effect was excessively pure)—
Leaves of velvet cerise next the face.
Above was a bunch of wood strawberry,
Below was a sprig of wild plum,
Mixedwithwhich ran aspray of the haw-berry,—
'Twas a thing to strike milliners dumb!
And soon if this fashion keeps growing,
We may look for coiffures en legume,
On capotes see the haricot blowing,
Or the graceful asperge with its plame.
Covent Garden, our belles, so unstable,
Will seek, not the marehande de modes,
And greens quit their place on our table, i
In our wardrobe to take their abode!

BOMBA AND HIS PAPA.
A PBETTY UTTLB STOEY FOR PRETTY LITTLE STATESMEN.
illy little Bomba lived
at Naples, but bis
Papa lived at Rome.
Bomb a went to see his
Papa, and his Papa
came to meet Bomba.
When Bomba saw his
Papa, he knelt dosn
to him as if he had
been going to say his
prayers, and gave him
a kiss. But he did not
kiss his Papa upon the
cheeks; he kissed his
Papa upon the toe.
Then Bomba's Papa
told Bomba to get up,
and made Bomba sit
down on a stool, and said, Well my son, Bomba, how do you do, and
how are you getting on?
Bomba said, 1 am pretty well, I thank yon, Papa, but I am not
gettin? on quite so nicely as I could wish. What is the matter.
Bomba, my son? his Papa said. Oh! Papa, said Bombs, I am afraid
there are «ome naughty boys who want to take my little crown away,
and are tr>ing to shake my little throne. That is very naughty of
them, said his Papa; but who are they 1 Oh! said Bomba, 1 do not
know who they are, quite, but I think I have caught some. What
have vou done with them, said his Papa. Shut them up in the cellar,
said Bomba (this was only Bomba's fun) in the damp and cold ana
dirt, along with the toads and frogs, and efts, and spiders, and earwigs,
and black beetles. Here is a little whip that I have them beaten with:
here is a little chain that I cause them to be chained together with all
day and all night.
You must mind that little Bomba was only joking when he told
his Papa all these dreadful things.
It is very right, said Bomba's Papa, to punish boys who are nanghty.
Ye9, Papa, said Bomba, but what do you think? That France and that
England are so unkind, they tell me I must not punish my naughty
boys. Do not mind them, my dear, said Bomba's Papa, I will speak
to France and tell him to leave you alone, or else I will give bim no
more hard-bake. England is a very bad boy, and does not mind what
I eay; but he will mind what France says. Now look here, Bomba.
See what pretty playthings I have brought you. And Bomba's Papa
gave Bomba ever so many little men and women, mate out of wood,
and ivory, and wax, all gilt and painted, so very pretty, and such a
lot of funny little bones! Oh! dear Papa, said Bomba, to give me
such a lot of sweet little toy3 to play with. Oh! what jolly bones,
Ob, what plummy little men and women. I will stick theui all round
my hat like King Louis, the French king that Ms. Kean plays in
London. Oh! Papa, I must kiss you for them. Then Bomba give bis
Papa one more nice kiss upon his toe; and his Papa put out his thumb
and two fingers, and poked Bomba in the side, and patted him upon
the head, and then Bomba said good bye to his Papa, and his Papa
went back to Rome, and Bomba went back again to Naples with his
whip, and his chain, and his bones, and his little men and women.

Barnum is busy getting up a "Baby and Perambulator Show." He
expects the Perambulators will be a great draw, as they will have the
effect of keeping the Babies exceedingly select. He says that persons
will be able to tell, from the crying alone, that they are children of
Haul Ton.
A Lady made a great sensation in the Broadway the other day by
starting a new fashion in bonnets. Instead of wearing her bonnet on
the back of her head—where no one could see it—a gorgeous Johnny
carried it behind her on a crimson velvet cushion. The result was, that
every one could perceive she had a bonnet, and the lady herself had not
the bother of carrying it. The effect was considered extremely light
and airy.
A large dairyman, upon being asked what he thought of the Falls of
Niagara, said enthusiastically. It only wanted a couple of cows to be
made into the finest milk-walk in the world!"
A female physician in Philadelphia advertises that it is "her par-
ticular specialite to cure all affections of the heart."
A coiffeur at New Orleans writes on his cards: "Mermaids' hair
dressea on the shortest notice, and a large assortment of false tails for
comets always on view in the show-room."
The heat was so unusually hot on the 13th instant, that it actually
melted a slaveowner's heart to that extent that, without knowing what
he was doing, he gave freedom to all his slaves.
The Fashion.
We have it on the infallible authority of Jenkins that it is no longer
correct to say, "the height of the fashion." When ladies wish to
convey the idea that any one of their acquaintance is at all bien mite,
they affirm that "she was dressed in the full breadth of the fashion;
only perhaps it would be more exact to put it in the plural, as a lady's
dress certainly takes now-a-days a great deal more than one "breadth."
However, the alteration in the term is a decided improvement that,
like the dress itself, is now quite "as broad as it is long."

PUNCH TO PALMERSTON.
Civil List Pensions—" Total £1,200."
MY Dear Lord,
I write this to you from a haycock, where I have gathered
myself tip for an hour or two. Your Parliament being pi oi ogued, (t his
hot weather, if nothing else, ought to have dissolved it,) I trust this
will find you in the honeysuckle bower of your recess; and your heart
expanding with the influence of the time and place, to say nothing of
the sweet consciousness of duty done; Russia magnificently rebuked
and mulcted of powder and shot expense; naughty noblemen doomed
to eat their Chelsea bun in a corner; valour and merit in lowly places
garlanded and exalted; and, indeed, all matters so harmoniously
ended, that the sounds of the distant shepherd's pipe winding to iou
through the honeysuckle bower aforesaid, are only consonant and
according with the mysterious music of the state.
My dear Lord, I have purposely delayed until the present balmy
hour, the performance of what I have nevertheless felt a dear and
tender duty towards yourself, and, a'low me to add, Punch. I have
thought it best to await the ministration of Black Rod in his most
welcome spiriting, ere I addressed you on the best distribution of the
annual £1,200 voted by a grateful and high-minded country in recog-
nition of tbe claims of what are sonorously denominated, science,
literature, and art.
My Lord, it cannot be denied that we are a poor people. We are
crushed by debt, crippled by taxes, beaten in the foreign markets by
foreigners; beside which, never was gun at Woolwich so overcharged
and so tried as the British Constitution (a fact that Firld Marshal
Albert has affectingly touched upon before the softened Fishmongers),
that, nevertheless, up to the present time has not burst, but may
probably be found terviceable for another year or two. Well, with
these difficulties to face, the conntry nevertheless makes a heroic effort,
and succeeds in paying a new £1,200 per annum to science, literature,
and art. The fi3hes are not very big, neither are the loaves very large;
but the straitened circumstances of the couLtry are to be considered,
and science, literature, and art ought to be ashamed of themselves if
not grateful Will your lordship, however, with your constitutional
good humour, deign to explain to Punch the peculiar services rendered
to science, literature, and art by many of the recipients of the little
fishes and rolU "between the 20th day of June, 1855, and the 20th day
of June, 1856?" To begin:—
"March 4.1856. Mm, Pauline Du Plat, (widow of the late Brtgadisr-Gkvebal
Do Plat, Royal Engineers,) £100, in consideration of the distinguished Fervices of
her husband, and the straitened circumstances in which she is placed by his decease."
All honour to the Brigadier-General's memory, and all tran-
quillity to his widow; but wby should the estimable lady be made by
your lordship to forage, to the loss of science, literature, and art?
Again:
"Psyche Rose Elizabeth Hosts, (daughter of the late Adnibal Bra William
Ho8tk,) £50, in consideration of the naval services of her father, and her own destitute
and iufirm condiUon."
Is there not Greenwich chest? Are there not the salaries of the
Lords of the Admiralty? Rob the one or deduct from the other, and
the £50 per annum for Miss Hosts (all-deserving, no doubt) cannot be
so unfairly levied as upon science, literature, and art, that, in tbis case,
have nothing to do with the quarter-deck or the cockpit. Nelson was,
it is true, a great author; there is no line in our language more
immortal than "England expects," &c, but even Nelson's literature
has been unrewarded in his child and grandchildren.
"March 4, Francis Petit Smith, £200, In consideration of his great, and for a long
period, gratuitous exertions connected with the introduction of the screw-propeller into
Hbb Majesty's service."
As I have said, my lord, we are a very poor country; otherwise for
the inexpressible, the invaluable seivices reniered by Mr. Smith to
Her Majesiy's service (bow triumphantly his genius walked the
wave at Portsmouth review!) you would doubtless have come to
Pailiament and asked for an exclusive grant for that propulsive man;
but no, England is staggering with her difficulties, ana the " screw" is
put upon science, literature, and art!
"March 4, Jake, Emily Sabah, and Louisa Cathcabt, the three eldest daughters
of the late Lieutenant-general < 'athcart, pensions of £100 a year each, In con-
sideration of the distinguished services of their father, and hia death on the field of
battle when in command of a division of Heb Majesty's forces."
"Cathcart's Hill" will remain a green place in the"memory of
Englishmen, perennially green as English sward; but wby, my lord,
should you blot it with pensions due to the ink-bottlef Surely it. is to-
do no honour to the gallant spirit that yielded itself "on the field of
battle" to divert the means that might solace the scholarly, the learned
spirit fighting against death in a garret.
"March 4, Mrs. Mabia Long (widow of the late Frederick Brckford Long,.
Inspector-Qen'ral of Prieoi*e in Ireland.) an additional pension of £50 a-year, in con-
sideration of the services of her husband, in consequence of whose death, frum illness
contracted in the execution of his duty, she has been left, with a large family, in cir-
cumstances of great distress."
There is some fitness in this grant. Science, literature, and art have
often been in prison, may again be there; hence tbcre may be a grim
propriety in rewarding from such a fund the memory of Beckford
Long. Again, the grant may be taken as an unconscious acknowledge-
ment of the humanity of the Bristol gaoler, who helped and buried
Savage.
I will not, this hot weather, weary your lordship by specifying every
case, but will sum up the account as I find it divided:—

Total Civil List
It was hoped that the venerab'e Joseph Gtjt, the man of many
books, the evergreen Spelling-Bock among the number, might have had
a modicum—say an odo £50—to keep his fires'ds warm for the few
years he may need it- But let scholarship shiver under grey hairs!
The cockpit and the trench have dearer claims on the annual bounty
nationally voted for science, literature, and art. Poor Joseph Gtjt is
now a little too old to enlist; otherwise, in 1900, he might yet have a
pension for "distinguished services in the field," and further in
consideration of " his destitute and infirm condition."
However, matters might have heen worse. A poor £1000 a-year has
been voted by Parliamtnt to Williams, the hero of Kara. Had it
i been thrice as much, no man would have grudged a farthing of it.
Nevertheless, I feel that science, literature, and ait have had a great
escape. It. is, indeed, lucky for them that your lordship did not make
the £1000 £12,000, and give it in a lump to Sir Fenwick, to spare the
trouble of distribution.
Acknowledgiug, for science, literature, and art, your lordship's
siderate goodness, I remain (in the haycock)
Yours, Ip^fJCS}.
A Hopeless Irish Member.
Perhaps there was never any Parliamentary gentleman whose hopes
of place were so completely blighted as those of James Sadleir. The
Government has disavowed the iutention of granting Mr. Sadleir the
Stewaidship of the Cbiltern Hundreds. Perhaps Government fears
tbtt, in the exercise of even that Stewardship, Mr. Sadleir might
prove an "Unjust Steward.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARTVATU.

BLOW HIGH BLOW LOWE.
Now that Parliament no longer
occupies the attention ot the
public, or more properly
sneaking the columns of the
newspapers, there is a pro-
spect tor those gentlemen
who dtvo^e themselves so
energetically to observing
the weather, and who will
now obtain t hat notice which
their lucubrations fail to
attract during the perma-
nence of more excitiDg to-
Jics. The indefatigable E.
. Lowe, who continually
measures the "depth of
wet,"—perhaps by standing
np to his ankUs in water—
and who enlightens us con-
stantly a3 to the "force of
the descent."—as exempli-
fied in its effects on his own
private umbrella, or some
public weathercock, will, for
the next few months, be a
valuable correspondent of
the Times,—which may one
r.'in the dearth of other topics during the recess, take Mr. Lowe's communi-
iona as the subject of a dashing, or bearing in mind the "deDth of wet," we
ght perhaps to say a splashing leader. The domestic habits of Mr. Lowe must
be such as to render him a perfect martyr in the cause of science; for he always
tells us "the greatest cold in night," which he cmi only have discovered by sleeping
oat of doors; and as he enlightens us as to the "minimum temperature on the
grass," it is probable that he selects some meadow for his couch, as literally
"a field" for his observations. One of his most recent reports announces "copious
dew." to which we fear we ought to add "abundant rheumatism." We should
really be very sorry to give even our greatest enemy his "dew" in the style in
which Mb. Lowe is in the habit of accepting it.
THE BISHOPS WISH.
{After Blookfikld.)
Be mine a modest pension clear
Of just six thousand pounds a-year;
And to complete my humble lot,
Give Fulbam Palace for my cot.
Let me enjoy a quiet life,
Away from controversial strife;
My daily meal should ne'er disturb
My trauquil mind! for meat or herb,
Or fish or fowl, I ne'er would look,
But leave it to my foreign cook.
My drink—I ask no better sort,
A bin of srx-and-twenty port;
With now and then, to warm my veins,
Some Burgundy or brisk Champagnes.
Of cash I need no large amount,
But at a Bank a good account,
On which—(my tradesmen not to vex)—
To draw from time to time my ch
My simple wishes thus supplied,
I into privacy will glide:
My Bishop's mitre I '11 resign,
And calm contentment shall be mine,
If they will only give me clear
For life—six thousand pounds a-year.
Ignorance of Indian Affairs.
The late hot weather has drawn attention to a subject to
which the British peop'c have been hitherto inclined to pay
too little—the state of our Indian empire. The accuracy
and distinctness of general information respecting the
affairs of India may be judged of from the circumstance
that an opinion has been almost universally expressed that
the only comfortable class of the Indian population are the
Hill Coolies.
MOKAL DEALEES IN MARINE STORES.
At a time when roguery is so rampant as it now is in the mercantile
world, the commencement of a moral movement in any class of com-
mercial men must he hailed with hope ; and those, who will be sorry to
hear that another Bank Manager has just been committed on a charge
of embezzlement, will, on the other hand, rejoice in being informed of
the failure of an accusation of being unlawfully possessed of certain
property, preferred against a marine store dealer. The case—which
related to a quantity of copper, brass drillings, and a pewter pot—was
adjudicated on by Mr. Combe, who decided that the su-picion of
copper (to use the phraseology of thieves), &c, was groundless.
An additionally-cheering circumstance transpired on this occasion,
when, according to the police-report,
"Mb. Lewib, of Ely Place, Attended on behalf of the prisoner, from the Marine
Store Dealers' Mutual Improvement Society."
That the room for imp-ovement among marine store dealers is con-
siderable will probably be the general opinion—although some doubt
may exist as to the extent to which the object in view is likely to be
promoted by mutual association. Marine stores may be cleared of
some rust by mutual friction, but it is questionable whether a corre-
sponding process is calculated materially to brighten the characters of
those who deal in them. Can these vendors of old iron possibly intend
"the word "Improvement" in irony? Should it not be transited " Pro-
tection P" Is not their Society an association for mutual dJetjCe con-
stituted on the principle of a union of fences?
If the mutual improvement of the marine store dealers is really the
object of this society of theirs, it is to be hoped that the kind ed class
of rag and bone merchants are admissible to the privilege of its
respectable membership. These varieties of the British merchant are
presumed to derive their distinctive titles of rag and bone *rom the
circumstance of their being open to the purchase of p-rfectly sound
linen, and making no bone* whatever of buying any goods which may
'be offered them at a sufficiently low price. Their affinity to the
marine store dealers is strongly suggested by the pictures exhibited
outside of many of their shops, of a sailor grinning from ear to ear,
and displaying a purse, supposed to contain the proceeds < f a trans-
action with the est.ablishment. The goods which this nautcal
individual may be conceived to have been disposing of are what in
every sense of the phrase may be termed marine-s'ores. T^e tar is
often represented in company with an individual of the land service,
who appears to have been getting rid of property little less marine—jj
that is to say, of his kit. These pictorial suggestions are usually I
rendered still more unmistakeable by the addition of poetry, printed in
large letters, announcing that good prices are given to all comers, for
all manner of commodities; and informing cooks, especially, of the
marketable value of dripping and kitchen stuff within.
The amelioration of this style of art and literature may be antici-
pated, if the object of the Ma-ine Store Dealers' Mutual Improvement
S.ciety, the Hag and Bone Merchants inclusive, is really to improve
their common style of business, and not merely to cultivate the craft
by means of which it may continue to be carried on as heretofore with
increased impunity.
BPANISH CHESNUTS.
Lord Palmerston says that Louis Napoleon will not interfere
in Spain. He will look on, but nothing more; being instructed by the
past. Once upon a time there was a tiger-monkey who longed for some
Spanish chesnuts—(the original Fable may be found in La Fontaine,
but our story is with a difference)—chesnuts roasting in the embers.
Tiger-monkey 1., even with a long sword tried to rake the chesnut
from the fire, but somehow burnt his fingers: then Tiger-monkey IL,
a very deep ape, indeed, took a ftney to a chesnut; and thought he
pould whip at the chesnut with a wedding-ring; but never was
monkey so terribly burnt. But we have now, says Lord Palmerston,
a most sagacious monkey, who, however temptingly the chesnut may
look and smell, will not risk the tip of his little finger for it.
The Session of 1856.
There was once a Parliament—(we do not live in such times now!)
—in which there were few or no lawyers; and the profession in revenge
stigmatised the senate as the "unlearned" Parliament. Henceforth,
seeing the number of Bills dropt ii the past Session, the Parliament of
1856 may be known as the "abandoned" Parliament.
the fullness op folly.
"Reading makes a full man," says Bacon; and "Fashion makes a
full woman," says Punch; for c rUiuly a woman, as she is dressed
according to the present fashion, could not well be made muc'i fuller.

...... THE TONGUE OF PARLIAMENT.
Mr/Wilkinson, ere the House broke up, made a laudable attempt
to reduce the length of all future speeches; but, as generally happens
with good intentions, nothing came of it. The honourable Member
proposed that no future talker should be permitted to make a speech
of more than an hour long. Now, supposing that every member
resolved upon having his hour's worth of tongue—the hour to be in no
way abridge.! by coughing, scraping of boots, crowing of cocks, orother
parliamentary utterances—would not the evil, as at present lamented,
be frightfully increased P Whereas, as the mitigated calamity now
exists, the man who speaks more than an hour does no more than
borrow (and the loan is so tacitly granted) of the man w'^o never speaks
at all. How many a worthy gentleman who, on his first taking his
seat, is resolved to shake even Woolwich arsenal, and fulmine over
Price's Candle Works, fays nothing; but remains, like the snake
symbolic of eternity, with the tale he had to unfold still in his
mouth!
Nevertheless, we should like shorter speeches even from those who
are eloquent; and as an amendment, on Mr. Wilkinson's motion
propose that, on the reassembling of Parliament, it be made a rule of
the House tbat no member should be allowed to address Mb, Speaker
if not standing upon one leg: Mr. Speaker to keep his eye upon that
leg, to the «ffect that auy attempt to change the leg, or to place the
other leg momentarily upon the floor, should be conclusive speech.
Changing his leg, the orator should be held to have put his foot in the
question, and be forthwith ordered to sit down. Members of the
Government might he distinguished by standing on the right leg,—the
Opoositiou on tbe lift. It is plain that if a man's subject be not fall
and strong enough to supply him with sufficient vigour to stand upon
one leg until t»e subject be exhausted, the matter is not worth listening
to, and the sooner the speaker sits down the better for himself and the
House that does not a*tend to him. With our proposition adopted by
the Commons, of course no member with a wooden leg would be
eligible;—not that we are aware of the present existence of any living
M.P.'s with wood in their legs, but quite the reverse.

memorative of the no knapsscks of 1S54,

Gross Misrepresentation.
The worthy Common Councilman who the other day proposed the
resolution of the Court, calling upon our excellent Lord Mayor
Salomons to present to the Corporation the portrait of himself so
conspicuous in the late Exhibition of the Royal Academy, complains
of being grievously misreported. He never spoke of the pt'c*ure as
"a great work of art." He knows better. What he did c.dl it was
"a large work of Hart."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.

No. I.—THE NINEVEH COURT.
Court ought to
be removed from
the Crvstal Pal-
ace. Under the
flimsy pretext of
illustrating the
history and man-
ners of an an-
cient people,
Mr. Layard,
Me. Fergus-
soN.and their ac-
complice*, have
contrived to in-
sert into the
building an ela-
borate squib
upon our glo-
rious constitu-
tion, and several other of our glories and social advantages.
The account of the Ninny vites which Mr. Lat ard gives in his Hand-
book, is artfully framed to insinuate what it might be imprudent to
express more openly. He goes into their history, and says that their
first King was Pull. This is a treasonable hint tbat sovereignty had the
pull over them, as it has bad, traitors would allege, over other people
besides N mn; vites. Their public records are upon slabs engraven with
the arrow-headed character, evidently implying that public men were
capable of drawing the long bow. He asserts tbat their priests gave
themselves extraordinary airs, and used to disguise themselves in fancy
costumes, and, on the strength of these, exact an obedience to which their
superior virtues did not entitle them. He says that their people of high
raiik dressed themselves effeminately, wore gold and precious stones,
dyed and curled their hair, and even put on wigs, as if persons of real
distinction would stoop to such pettiness, and he hints that their ladies
were nasty enough to paint themselves. He represents their magis-
trates as influenced by base consider-
ations, aud on the external wall facing
the transept actually shows a Beak taking
a sop. In fact, setting aside the malicious
intent of the satire, the libels upon the
defunct Assyrians are quite enough to
rouse the Nineveh Lion.
Could we lose sight of this much to be
deprecated design on the part of the con-
trivers of the Nineveh Court, we admit
that there is a good deal to see in it. The
Court is not a complete restoration—which
is well, for the complete Restoration of a
Court, as we saw in the time of Charles
the Second, is not always desirable.
But to the height of about seventeen feet
from the ground it bas been copied from
existing remains; and as the majority of
the visitors to the Crystal Palace are
(we are informed by the courteous officials) less than seventeen feet in
height, there is little danger of the people being misled by anything
that may come under their eyes.
To M- Botta? the French Consul at Mosul, Mr. Latabd'wss much
indebted for assistance in discovering the Nineveh ruins; but this gen-
tleman was not successful at first, because he was living at Khorsabad,
which was of course-a-bad place for the purpose. However, Mr.
Latard went down the Tigris on the 8th of November, 1845, after
breakfast, and on a raft formed of inflated skins. The party, having
blown out their skins well, reached the ruins in a few hours, and must
have been greatly gratified at the prospect, inasmuch as no remains of
building, not even "a trace of masonry," were visible. We do not
quite understand this complaint of a want of any trace of Masonry.
The brotherhood of Freemasons seldom haunt places where there is no
refreshment" to be got after "labour." The amiable Cowper wished
for "a Lodge in some vast wilderness," but we never heard a single
P. M. or even a humble J. D. echo the with. Did Mr. Latard expect
to find the Royal Nimroud Lodge, Brother Bosbkoku, W. M., and a
select band with aprons and gridirons, waiting for him P These effemi-
nate lamentations are unworthy of a hardy traveller.
When he arrived, nobody seems to have been up, except the Tigris,
which, Mr. Latard poetically Bays, had deserted its ancient bed; and
from the statement that the public edifices of Assyria were made of
cUy, mixed with "chopped straw," the Tigris, in flowing over them,
seems to have imitated the late Mrs. Margert Daw, who not only
sold her bed, but took to lying in the latter article. The traveller lost

little time, and being skilful at giving a good dig (he retains the accom-
plishment) soon made bis way into the mound, and found a wall,
panelled with inscribed slabs. This was not the first visit of the
Member for Nineveh to his constituents, but his canvass had, on his
previous journey in 1840, been objected to by the Turks, who, in fact,
would not let him put up a tent at all. His researches were soon
rewarded, and ere long be dug out the Great Head.

This apparition frightened the Arabs awfully, and with no great courtesy
towards their reb'gious teachers, they declared it to be either one of
their prophets or au evil spirit. Clearly the Arabs must consider their
vaccinators to be no better than our racing prophets; in other words—
subterranean untruthtellers. However, the head turned out to be
an emblematic figure, like one that had been found in Kbdrsabad;
but as the body was that of a lion instead of that of a bull, there was
some difference in the tails and details.
Digging away—playing spades like trumps—the excavators, in a few
months, found five-and-twenty halls, each a splendid haul where all was
fish that came to the net. Here they discovered all kinds of secrets.
Like a mob of Oriental Boys Jones, they broke into every part of the
Palace—which it seems the place was—and they ransacked unceremo-
niously. The real articles discovered were sent off to the British
Museum, and copies of them, much cleaner and brighter and better
than the originals, are in this Court. King Nimhold's crown and
sceptre had disappeared, but they found his spectacles, toothbrush, and
umbrella, and many things belonging to his Queens, especially a peram-
bulator, in which the maids-of-honour used to wheel about the little
Prince of Nineveh. If these things are not discovered on the walls
of the Court, it will be because the spectator does not look in the place
where they are.
The Member for Nineveh again visited his constituents in 1849, and
reversed the ordinary proceedings in such cases. He got a great deal
out of them. He obtained plates, the real Babylon willow pattern,
bowls, whether for rolling or for making the head go round he does not
explain, cauldrons, thrones, enamelled bricks, vases, and other elegan-
cies, and when his Arab workmen asked—having packed these articles
of vertu, "Vare to?" he nobly replied, "To the British Museum."
Mr. Latard also found a deity partly human,
partly fish, which some think meant Justice, for
no other reason, apparently, than its scales. It
wears the turban usual on these figures, and is
in fact made up of turban and turbot. But his
great feat was rinding the tomb of Sardana-
palus. The dreadful row this ill-u9ed and
entombed monarch made on perceiving that the
intruder was an Englishman, who knew the
Princess's Theatre, frightened Mr. Latard
almost as much as the Great Head had done
the Arabs. The volley of abuse which Sah-
danafalus showered upon Mr. Charles Kean,
and insisted on Mr. Latabd's conveying to
that gentleman, was perfectly shocking, and
showed that the deceased monarch was a true
King of the Turvey-drop dynasty. Still the
indefatigable excavator went on digging, and
found so many palaces, tbat this memorial of
them might be called the Palace Court, if such
a name wou'd not terrify every one from entering. In the Palace
of Snatchacrab, as the late Rev. Stdnet Smith calls the monarch
who came down like a wolf on the fold, seventy-one halls were disco-
vered, all covered with inscriptions, which the somewhat egotistic king
had written in praise of himself. The lengths he went 'may be judged
from the fact, that nearly two miles of bas-reliefs were uncovered. The

effect of the scene was most solemn, ssys MjuLayard, which is not
surprising, considering that Snatchacrab's s( 1'-adulatory lies must
have been awful. He also found the " pretended tomb of Jonah," but
implies that this was very like a whale. The diggings are still going1
on, and it m*y be well to mention, that there is an Assyrian Excavation
Fund, supported by subscriptions and donations, for the prosecution of;
these most interesting researches, which if Mr. Punch treats, for bis
present purpose, in a light spirit., it is because his readers are sensible
people, who know that hearty sympathy and a hearty laugh are quite
compatible. To show that he can be quite grave, when necessary, he
hereby tequests everybody who visits the
Nineveh Court, and has a sovereign to
spare, to send it to 85, Fleet Street, whence
it shall be forwarded to the above ad-
mirable Fund. He flatters himself that he
has now taken the levity cut of the reader.
One of the sculptures discovered is
called, the Esyptian Hercules driving out
the Evil Spirit, and it is not Mr. La yard's
fault if it rather more strikingly resembles
an incensed cook snatching up lire-irons
to expel a remonstrating tom-cat.
And now that people know where Mb.
Layard and Mr. Frbgusson obtained
the materials for building this Court, Mr.
Punch will walk round it, and, in his UBual
affable manner, will indicate its points of
interest. The brightness of the colours
will first strike the eye. This is all right,
so none of your half-instructed prigs need
remark, confidentially, to the ladies on
their arm, "No warrant, you we aware,
for all this gaudy display." Both paint,
and gilding are found on the original
monuments, but as gilding, to the full
extent of those originals, would have been a tremendous business, the
yellow has been substituted, in order to save, as Mr. Kob&on used to
say, "no end of yellow boys." The Assyrians used colours conven-
tionally, that is, the same colours were always employed for a certain
class of objects. The penny-a-liners of our day do the same thing with
epithets. If a child is run over, he is always a remarkably fine little
boy, whereas the man who beats his wife is as always a thick-set sullen
ruffian. The magistrate is always worthy, the prisoner is always impu-
dent, the swindler is always fashionably attired, and the complaining
lady is always prepossessing. So that the Niunyvites are not extinct.


GETTING TO THE TOP OF THE TREE.
Among the exhibitions of the London season has been a rather
neglected affair in the shape of a tree, which, to use a conventional
phrase, has been "making its bow" for some time past to the British
public. The tree boasts as many feet, in height as there are days in the
year; but by some singular mode of packing its trnnk, it appears to
stand sufficiently low to admit of its having entered the building in
which it is exhibited. As the tree does not soar conspicuously above
the tops of the surrounding houses, none of which can be one hundred
feet high, we must presume that the lofty specimen of vegetation to
which we allude has adopted a stooping position. We have not heard
of the class to which the tree belongs, but if it comes from America it
may be something in the nature of a lie-Barnum. We are quite sure
that, a ve.ry wonderful tree might be produced by taking a few leaves
out, of the book of that distinguished showman, whose pedigree, should
it ever become an object of interest, would we have no doubt display a
genealogical tree comprising puffery in all its branches.
;THE LEGITIMATE DRAMA ON HORSEBACK.
E have heard every
body for some time
complaining that
the legitimate dra-
ma has gone to the
dogs; but we are
happy to find that
SsAKSPEARE at
all events has only
gone to the horses,
tor we find Richard
the Third in full
play at Astley*s.
We have not yet
"been there to
see," but the battle of Bosworth, according to recent accounts from
"the seat of war," in the dress boxe<, is being fought in a style
which does equal credit to the head and feet, the heart and the longs of
the principal performers. White Surrey is represented by a highly,
trained animal, who throws himself into the hea'. of the action with an
energy worthy of the Surrey side of the water, and by bis picturesque
poses, his intelligent snorts, and judicious bye-play, he seems almost to
justify the apparently extravagant offer of his master to exchange his
kingdom for sucli an animal. We hope the experiment of Shak-
spbare on horseback will prove sufficiently successful to induce the
enterpriritg manager to make further experiments in the samedireotion.
Perhaps other zoological accessories besides the horse may be intro-
duced, to give effect to the productions of our too much neglected j
dramatists, and the dog, "the friend of man," might be found capable 1
of enchaining the interest of our perishing five-act tragedies and
comedies.
The student of Shakspkare will not need to be reminded of other
plays with zoological features which might be brought out with promi-
nence; and the breaking up of the zoological department of the
Surrey Gardens must have thrown so many noble animals out of
employ, that, there could be no difficulty in ge<ting up a strong com-
pany of brufes, that would be found quite equal to acy demand on their
energies.
Uncle Sam's Telegraph.
From a statement in the New Fori- Times, it appears that the project
of uniting England and America by means of the electric telegraph has
commenced in good earnest. We must, not enter on a premature cal-
culation of chickenB—but should this line of telegraph be completed,
we shall exrject all manner of extraordinary communications by means
thereof. We trust that these may all prove true; or at any rate, that
the telegraph may lie securely in its ocean-bed.
MEETING OF GERMAN NATURALISTS.
This annual gathering takes place this year at Vienna on the 16th,
ending on the 22nd of September. Among the questions to be practi-
cally decided, will be the following:
Whether an Austrian cannot retain the use of all his faculties as at
present permitted by the state, in an exhausted receiver?
Whether "the brain of Germany" is not one part beer, and three
parts smoke?
Whether Toby, the learned pig, was descended in a right line from
a boar of Westphaly P
Whether at the "feast of reason" the Austrian eagle would not be a
very poor spread f
Whether Doctor Pretoritjs, as a philosopher and teacher, prepares
to rise with his left Lg or his right? If wi'h his left, bow may the
sinister action affect the English habeas corpus; if with the right, how
the British Constitution, so lately "on its trial?"
j Whether—inasmuch as a lobster changes colour by the action of
caloric, whether, on the like principle, a boiled cardinal would not
become black?
Whether, if the Pope's eye underwent the operation of strabismus,
whether such an event would affect the legs of mutton in Catholic
sheep P
Whether, and how long, since introduced into England, has the
Hanoverian rat become naturalised game?
Whether the goose of Baron Stoltz did not lay golden eggs?
Whether the red dser of Scotland have not been led upon live High-
landers, their wives and little ones?
The Tax-Gatherer's Knock.

This capital question may be most satisfactorily answered by the
promoted Archbishop of Agram, upin whose head the Emperor op
Austria has just placed the cardinal's hat sent to the holy man fiom
Rome. "Who's your Hatter, Agram?" And Agram might, could,
or should answer, "Francis Hapsburg, who ought never to have
been anything above a hatter."
Mr. Layard truly enough complains that Englishmen care nothing
for foreign politics until they are awakened to interest by the tax-
gatherer's knock. We may thank the sea for this. We are lulled to
3oz;ng by the sound of the waves. Our fireside gods are, indeed,
compounded of salt- and, however we may paint and trick out the
tutelar protectress of the tight little bland, Britannia herself beara
the closest saline affinity to the wife of Lot.
The Position op Italy.—Italy must soon rise—and for rising the
Boot is only waitiDg for the Spur of opportunity.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RECORD" CANTING AT RANDOM.
Wi doubt very much whether we can any longer conscientiously call
the Record our serious contemporary. That doubt is suggested by the
following passage occurring in one of its leading articles :—
"We are taught to expect the blessing of God on the conduct of our affairs, when we
i act in accordance with tbn divine will; and it almost seem* as If Lord Pai.mkkston
acquired new ftrength (mm tlie moment when he agreed to put down the Sunday
bauds. The attempt to make Government responsible ; r the loss of Kara was defeated
by a great majority, and the subsequent attempt to censure Lord Clarendon on
account of the American dispute was defeated by a majority still luoie overwhelming."
We can conceive a person devoid of all veracity and conscience,
writirg in a great hurry to a set of imbecile fanatics, perpetrating such
stuff and non>eme as the above, but we cannot well conceive any other
person auil'y thereof. The writer suggests that Providtnce rewarded
JjOhs Palmerston for having " agreed to put down the Sunday bands,"
with two majorities in the House of Commons. Either Lord Pal-
merston's Government was, or was not, responsible for the loss of Kars;
either Lord Clarendon was, or was not, censurable on the account
of the American dispute. If a just Providence regulates parliamentary
affairs, Lord Palmerston and his Government, includii g Lord
Clarendon, would nave been condemned or acquitted by Parliament
according simply to their deserts of condemnation or acquittal. The
Record, however, actually represents Providence as having, perhaps,
biassed the judgment of Parliament on the cases in question irre-
spectively of the merits of those cases, but respectively ot the conduct
of the party chiefly concerned in them with regaid to quite another
affair. It represents Providence as capable of supporting a minister in
the spirit of a political partisan. It intimates that because Lord
Palmerston sided with the Sabbatarians, Providence took the part of
Lord Palmerston, no uiatter whether Lord Palmerston was in the
right or in the wrong. Can the Record seriously believe tbat because
some fanatics would not hesitate to vote black white for the pre-
dominance of their persuasion, a vote so unscrupulous could possibly
be dictated from Heaven?
Suppose Lord Palmerston had been defeated on the Kars question;
suppose the decision of the House on the American business had gone
against Lord Clarcni>on; and suppose that the suppression of tbe
Sunday bands was an ac; of piety on the part of the Premier. Would
the Record have been surprised at not seeing the pious action receive a
temporal rewaid: at the two noble Lords undergoing tribulation? But
what is the use of reasoning on first principles witb a journalist who.
having to write on serious subjects, treats them with the levity ana
thoughtlessness evinced in the foregoing extract? So little did he
think or care what he was writing about, tint in surmising Lord
Palmerston to have received divine support in Patliament for having
consented to tbe discontinuance of the Sunday bauds, he positively
blinked the fact of the noble Lord's accompanjing declaration that his
own private conviction of the harmlessness of Sunday music remained
unaltered.
WINGED WORDS.
Tub world abounds in strange birds of nearly every description, but
we have heard of nothing to equal the ram avet described in the
annexed adveitisement:—
PET BIRDS.—To bo SOLD, TWO beautiful and very rare BIRDS—
one speaks French and English. They are exceedingly tame, and caonot be
matched in Europe. Address ."
We presume that this "eb'gible opportunity" is offered especially
to "families going abroad," who may be unacquainted with the French
language, and who may find the bird alluded to above a serviceable
adjunct to their travelling party in the character of an interpreter.
Talking birds have long ceased to be regarded as impossible entities,
but a bird with pretensions to the rank of a linguist is still looked ou
as a phenomenon. We think the name of the Professor who instructed
the bird should have been inserted in the advertisement as a sort of
material—or immaterial—guarantee, and if a specimen of the bird's
French before and after six lessons could have been set forth, the
whole would have had an air of thorough consistency.
THE INCONVENIENCE OE GLOEY.
"My dear fellow, Punch,
"I wish j ou would speak to the young ladies', and, indeed,
the old ones too. What 1 am going to say may seem ui gallant; hut,
really, they worry me neaily to death. Talk of ball practice!—I think
perhaps I know wbat that is: but tbe polka beats it, especially duting
such weather es we have lately had—worse than being under the
hottest fire. One is let in to dance with all of them, and tbe con-
sequent fatigue makes a fel'ow almost wish himself in the trenches.
I have often been in the jaws of death, but never felt .myself in such
imminent danger cf being eaten up as 1 was the other night, when all
the females prestnt githered round me, and absolutely devoured nie
with their eyes. Thty follow one in the street; and, by Jove, 1 think
I shall try Rowland's Kalydor to clear my bronzed complexion; and
wear my medal in my waistcoat pocket, that they may not know wbat I
am, namely, your obedient servant, half killed with kiodress, and
expecting to be very soon smotbered witb affectiona'e attention,
"United Service Club, August, 1856. "A Crimean Hero."

THE OLD EPISCOPAL STOEY.
A paragraph in the Times, headed
following f pecification :—
"The will of the
£140,000."
'Wills," commences with the
of Gloucester and Bristol was
The bishop's will was very properly placed at the head of the list
which includes fourteen others, whereof the nearest in point, of figures
to tbat of the prelate falls short of it by £35,000. The bishop is first
of the opulent testators—the rest are nowhere comparatively. See
what it is to have run a good race. Here is an example of departed
worth for you. To have died worth not much less than £140,000, the
bishop must have had a saving faith, whatever Cardinal Wiseman j
may say to the contrary. What is more, he must have acted con-
scientiously up to it. Some bitter dissenters will probably compare
the wealth of the defunct prelate with apostolical poverty. The com-
parison will be not only odious, but old. It occurs to the common
mind every time that a bishop's circumstances aie mentioned. Why
keep repeating it? It has no effect; it never will have any effect.
The inconsistency at which it points is a truism. We all know tbat;
since we all know that we all ignore that, and when we are told of that
we very properly yawn. Bishops will go on to the end of the chapter,
no matter what the chapter says, and i( is quite right that they should
go on, preaching self-denial and accumulating wealth, universally
respected in good society. Don't talk of humbug. It has been said
before, over, and over, and over again. It isn't humhug. Tbe wills of
SS. Peter and Paul might have been safely sworn under £140,000;
at least if swearing was customary in the Primitive Church; and if a
bishop of the British religion has accumulated £140,000. is not the fact
in strict accordance with his (last Will and) Testament?
Thought on the Closing of the Royal Academy Exhibition.
A reflective publican, struck with the very numerous pictures of
some merit, but not mucb, which adorned the walls of the Koyal
Academy this year, remarked that it was a pi'y so large a number of
respectable painters should "die and make no sign."
A Mutual Want.—" Month after month," says the Art Journal,
"nay, year after year goes by and finds the Nelson monument still
incomplete." Nelson wants his lions. Iu the late war, how the lions
wanted Nelson!
The New Bishop.
The Bishop op Lincoln, it is said, will be the new Bishop cf
London. There is a wicked couplet, a pair of Neapolitan scorpions in
rhyme that says:—
11 If the devil has a son,
Surely he's Lord Palmerston I"
We do not believe in the paternity of the individual nam<=d; and we
further have to congratuK'e his Lordship that, unlike his Wickedness,
he has not "looked over Lincoln."

A GOOD BIRTH FOR A PENNY-A-LINER.
The ingenuity of the penny-a-liners is beginning to be
brought into full plsy by the dearth of interesting facts, and
the paragraph-mopgers are accordingly running riot in the
realms of fancy. It was formerly the custom to rear gigantic
cabbages and plant enormous gooseberries in the columns of
the press;but the public has become sick of gooseberries, and
cannot be brought to Bwallow a cabbBge, however respectable
the paper in which it may be wrapped, or however piquant the
sauce—or the words—in which it may be administered. Some
very lucky dog of a penny-a-liner, who fully deserves his ten-
pencc-halfpenny—the price of his paragraph—for his ingenuity,
has hit upon quite a new idea, consisting of a rather senti-
mental description of a joung married lady, alone and sea-sick
in a Calais steam-boat, whose evidently interesting situation
excites the sympathy of all on board, and leads to her bei"s
delivered at, the Cuatom-House of "2 pelerines, 15 scarf j, 17
pieces of lac*, 12 pairs of silk stockings, 38 pieces of cotton,
6 reticules, and 48 Lyons handkerchiefs." We regret that the
impossibility of working this idea more than once will prevent
its being a source of permanent inoome to the
fraternity, who could multiply gooseberries to any extent, and
go on for ever finding colossal cabbages;but a young married
lady, in an interesting situation, on a Calais boat, can only be
introduced once every few years, at such intervals as will
render it probable that she has been decently buried in oblivion
by Time, who undertakes the performance of this class of
funerals.

HEEOES TO THE HARVEST!
Militiaman, young bero, made a soldier of a clown,
Tby bayonet thou bast yielded up, and put tby firelock down;
Yet still there is a weapon which thy oountry bids thee wield,
A blade, too, which thy good right-hand may brandish in the field.
The field, not such as Alma's, nor as Inkermann's indeed;
The field, except by accident, where heroes never bleed;
The heroe3 lose but little blood, but greatly they perspire;
Because it is hot work for them—though not exposed to fire.
The field it is where Ceres smiles, not where Bellona frowns,
Far it extends on many plains, and wide on many downs;
There are the hosts, Militiaman, which thou art low to lay,
Brave hosts—how still they stand for thee !—they will not run away.
The corn-field is thy present field, outspread so broad and dense,
With corn whose colour golden is, and quantity immense;
Militiaman, the sickle is the blade which thou must wield;
Go in, then, gallant son of Mass, and reap that glorious field.
For action thou'H equip thyself as lightly as may be,
'Twere well to doff thy tunic, that tbine arm may sweep more free;
Where thy cartouche-box was before, thy beer-keg will be slung,
That is behind—well never mind—take heed unto the bung.
Go to the field where guano calls, transmuted into wheat,
Invincible Militiamen—wbo never will be beat,
Whether at an invading foe your duty is to dash,
Or 'tis the harvest only that you 're called upon to thrash.
EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON AT RAMSGATE.
"Mk. Punch, "RamsgtUe, August 6.
"I am not aware whether you are in the useful habit of in-
serting in your widely-spread, and in fact world-wide pages (you must
insert this after that,) neatly-written accounts of physical phenomena
that, at this time of the year, when Parliament has broken up, always
abound ; as if M.P.'s carri»d 'em out of town with them. But an ex-
traordinary occurrence took place at this delightful resort only yes-
terday, worthy of registration m your universal columns.
"Yesterday, at low tide, when the sands were visited by some of
Ramsgate's most distinguished patrons,—there were present Lord
Lathligs and family, the Dowager Lur Shovblboabd, Sir Maxi-
milian Mouse, and others of the 'floe porcelain of human clay,' as
I believe a poet calls our aristocracy—the sky that had been as bright
as sapphires, and the air that was as close as ever it was in Fops' Alley,
became suddenly luridly dark, and the wind arose with a snapping ana
a howling as though all the lap-dogs of Belgravia had been suddenly
trod upon.
"Before the distinguished persons could seek refuge from what
seemed to threaten a violence of the elements, the wind went over the
sand?, cutting and scratching, and before you could count half-a-dozen,
then, on the sands as though written with the iron pen of a giant, were
the aiarming letters—
£. 8. D.!
"Lord Lathlegs, as if shot to his stumps, fell upon his knees;
Lady Shovelboard fainted; Sir Maximilian Mouse fled, squeaking;
and, indeed, all the fashionable world—myself excepted—was thrown
into a state of consternation unparalleled in the memory of the oldest
bather.
"Of course, Mr. Punch, there were maDy explanations hazarded as to
the object, purpose, and meaning of the awful three letters; letters
that bind and unbind the world; but an interpretation of the phenome-
non has been pnt forth by the Reverend Doctor Gumming, who is
down here for the benefit of salt in his sermons, that has been very
generally accepted, especially by the shopkeepers.
"Doctor Cumming, in an antiquarian opening, gives the origin of
the three letters, showing them to be synonymous with Hebrew roots
(and therefore still much cultivated by the Rothschilds and others of
the Jewish preference), although subsequently adopted by the Romans;
and brought from Rome by St. Augustine, who planted them at Can-
terbury (it is well known, says the Doctor, that the Saint was landed
on the back of a Dolphin at Heme Bay; the site of his embarkation
being occupied by the Dolphin Hotel) on his early arrival in that
city. Hence, £ s. d. have been roots of peculiar savouriness to
the Church, no Bishop's garden being considered complete without
them.
"Now, it is known, says the Doctor, that sinners in fashionable life
continually leave London, leaving their bills unpaid; and these ominous
letters, these soul-startling £ s. J., have been traced upon the sand to
strike the consciences of out-of-town debtors; to open their hearts and,
whether they will or no, to unbutton ihtir pockets.
"I remain, Mr. Punch, yours truly,
"Pegwell."
"P.S. I understand that certain persons, whom I will not name, have
ordered hour-glasses filled with £ s. d. sand to take back to town with
them. Let us hope tbat sucb sand, as it runs, will in future seasons
warn them, ere they sball come from London, to come down with the
dust."
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE, BRITISH CENSORSHIP.
British juries are beginning to assert themselves. A London jury
mulcted the Times the other day in the sum of £400 for having stated,
by mistake, which it subsequently rectified, that a tailor's agent had
been flogged. An Edinburgh jury hf s outdone the London one by
conscientiously and religiously returning a verdict of damages to just
the same amount against the Scotsman newspaper far a libel on the
political cba acter of the celebrated Mr. Duncan M'Laren. This is
as it shoul d be—as some of our contemporaries say—quite as it should
be in every possible way.
Mr. Duncan M'Laren is celebrated for sanctity. He is the pious
enemy of Maynooth. He is the zealous and devout upholder of the
Scottish Public-House Act. The political as well as the private
character of such a man is sacred. His words are the words of holiness
and wisdom, which the wicked must not be allowed to gainsay. Sup-
pose he makes electioneering remarks, for instance, at the expense of
somebody else. Those remarks must be reverenced. The wicked
Scotsman did not revere certain remarks of that nature which proceeded
from the month of M'Laren. Tbat profane journal described those
venerable obseivations as venomous and malignant. Twelve righteous
men, twelve douce, canny citizens of Edinburgh, avenged the blasphemy
by a fine of £400. That 's the way to put down wicked papers that
withstand the Sundajite saints.
Moreover, Mb. Duncan M'Laren has, we believe, _ been Provost of
the Scotch metropolis. Perhaps he is a North-British Tradesman.
Perhaps the jury were North British Tradesmen too._ Perhaps, also,
tbey were fellow-saints—saints of the same unction—with the quondam
arch-baillie: a jury of sworn saints who will not care although the
profane may term them a pack of Sabbatarian Sawnies.
In Hbr Majesty's dominions there exists no regular censorship of
the Press. But what matter P Have we not British juries who answer
the purpose of Censors as well as the very Pope's Congregation of
the Index P The height which overlooks Edinburgh is not Vesuvius;
but a power, if not a potentate, controlling, with a strong hand, the
audacity of the press, exists as well in Auld Reekie as in volc&nically
fumigated Naples. An Edinburgh jury and its foreman effect the
suppression of political opinion no less completely than Bomba and his
police; and the two capitals are as happy in the equal eiijoyment of
this advantage, as they are in that of the common blessing of sulphur.
JUSTICE IN JEOPARDY.
The Reporters have lately been calling attention, again, for the fifth
or sixth time, to the tottering and tumble-down condition of the
Hammetsmith Police Court. Everybody who has seen it wonders that
the attic does not suddenly descend into the first floor, in which justice
is administered—an event that would be inevitably followed by the
further descent of the Temple of Themis itself into the kitchen below,
or its fall forwards into the ditch opposite. It is a marvel how the
law of the land can be administered as ably as it is in a Court which
the law of gravitation is likely any day to bring to the ground, without
much preliminary notice. Justice ought to be easy of access; but how
can it be said that justice at Hammersmith is obtained without
difficulty, when it can only be got at by climbing up a sort of ladder,
which the reporters have pronounced to be dangerous? It seems a bit
of a farce to make orders at the Hammersmith Police Court for the
demolition of dangerous buildings, when everybody feels that one of
the first orders of the Court should be one for its own removal to some
more appropriate building.
It is wonderful that the scales of Justice can be so steadily held,
and that right should be dealt out with such a very even hand, in a
structure that shakes at every heavy step, and on a Bench that seems
to totter whenever a suitor with tolerably thick shoes approaches it.
We are quite satisfied tbat the stupid shabbiness, wherever it exists,
which prevents the erection of a new and fit building, will meet with
no sympathy among the public, who, with all their desire for judicious
economy, have every wish that those who administer public justice
should have every appurtenance fitting to their dignity and to the
important duties they have to execute.

PEBBLES BY THE SEA-SIDE.
Bvffslippers, August 12.
OST satisfactorily does our rising
waterir<g-place continue to flou-
rish. Rank and beauty crowd
one opon the other. Hence, a
great impetus was given to our
recent donkey races: the first
prize being carried by Sir
Balaam, Strings -of-my- Heart
coming in second by a lovely
neck.
Considerable excitement was
yesterday occasioned by the ap-
pearance of Mr. Sm—t—h, of
Lyon's Inn, who, at the end of
our new and symmetrical pier
(built of heart-of-oak), fished for
white salmon with red tape; the
fish bit freely, and were landed
by his clerk in a blue-bag.
A portrait of the Rev. Terttjllian Tongs has appeared at the library, worked by a few
young lady enthusiasts in Berlin wool. The portrait represents the reverend gentleman in a
transition state, passing from Low Church to Traetarianism. The illusion is perfect; although
the malignity of criticism (for there are vipers, even in Buffslippers) has affected to detect an
obliquity of vision in the right eye. But so it is with the vulgar and the scoffing. Thus is the
True Light slandered as a Squint.
We have had a narrow escape. Buffslippers was, for a time, threatened with a calamity
that would have put us in mourning for the rest of the season. The estimable and philan-
thropic Mas. Backgammon, who has done so much for this saline Paradise, met with an
alarming incident. The wind had been unusually high, and Mrs. B., imprudently venturing
upon the West Cliff, was carried off her legs, and borne ever the expanse of ocean. She was
foiInnately beheld, ere it was too late, by one of the Preventive on the look-out, and a boat
seat to her rescue. With the greatest presence of mind, Mrs B. threw out ballast, and
the crinoline—(for the matter has been too serious to affect false secrecy, it was crinoline)—
subsiding, she made a beautiful descent. She was brought ashore in the beat, and I need not
add that everybody in Buffslippers was on the beach, to welcome her.
Our theatre—the first brick was only laid in April—opens on Monday, with a new opera, by
a native composer; the author of the Sea-Anemone Waltz and the Oyster Polka. Report
speaks highly of the new work. It is called The Shoplifter of Sensibility; and abounds with
effects. A finale in which the heroine subsides to typhus has created a great sensation. The
receipts of the night will be devoted to the funds of the Magdalen.
PECULIARITIES OE FOREIGN PRINCES.
That wonderful invention the Submarine Electric Telegraph was
employed the other day to communicate these important particulars:—
11 Princk Adalbert, of Bavaria, arrived in France this morning, lie travels under
the name of Count Andrxohs."
Why is it that Foreign Princes always travel under an alias with the
title of Count F If there is a good reason for this custom on the part
of Foreign Princes, why do not British Princes adopt a similar custom?
Thus, if our Prince of Wales should ever cross tbe water, "some
foreign country for to see," the Submarine Electric Telegraph might
send us, for example, the message following:—
"Prince Albert Edward, of Wales, has arrived in Paris. His Royal Highness
travels under the name of Loud Batkmax."
When Shaksfeare said that all the world was a stage, he was pretty
nearly right. The whole world does seem to be a stage, except the
United Kingdom and the United States. At any rate, Foreign Princes
appear to go about on the Continent precisely alter the manner of their
representatives on the stage; and when we hear or read of one of them
travelling, like an operatic hero, under the title of Count, cur imagi-
nation depicts him in a braided velvet tunic, a pelerine collar, a broad
hat with feathers in it, and green morocco boots with gold tassels.
HOMOEOPATHIC GLOBULES. (Fifth Dose.)
A Headache is one of the pains and penalties of over-indulgence.
There is just as much intemperance in drinking physic as drinking anything else.
It Is a great pity there is no Maine-Liquor-Law tor medicine!
The first time a Quack feels your pulse may be an accident, but the second should be
a repulse.
Nu man ruins his health without bringing the consequences down upon himself.
Like Samson, he destroys the temple, and buries himself in the ruins.
When a Doctor cannot make you worse, he hands you over to another.
The Cost of the Affections.—Never, perhaps, are children dearer
to their parents than when, as at present, the price of bread and meat
is excessive.
THE MEMBEKS' HOLIDAY.
Now the Session's toil is o'er,
And the Members are away,
Some unto a foreign shore.
Gone to spend their holiday.
Some are in pursuit of grouse,
On tbe breezy Northern moors;
All the Honourable House
Is at piesent out of doors.
Save, in some sequestered nook,
Here and there a plodding maD,
GettiDg up a great Blue Book,
'Tis a wonder how he can
With such dull and dreary stuff
Cram the pockets of bis brain.
Very likely he's a muff,
And his labour all in vain.
Some at Athenaeums prate;
'Tis a practice not unwise,
For employment in debate
Keeps their tongues in exercise.
These at County Meetings prose,
Those at Public dinners bore,
Whilst their hearers mostly doze,
Many overheard to snore.
I the Member chiefly praise
Who devotes his time to sport,
And ensuing thirst allays,
Not without a little Port.
Fine old Port doth very much
Goodness in email bulk condense;
Let each Member's talk be sucb,
Short and sweet and full of sense.
Members in one point, I own,
With good Port in speech may vie,
In one point, and one alone,
Choice old Port is rather dry.
An amendment I will move
On the Session which is past;
May the one ensuiug prove
Much more fruity than the last.
A LITTLE DUMB BEAUTY.
It is not often that the advertising columns of even the most
fashionable of our contemporaries contain so exquisite a little gem as
the subjoined:—
ALADY'S PET, one of the handsomest in London, a Female of the
Skye Terrier breed; colour a snow white, with blue spots. She has a beautiful
silky coat, is perfect in shape, with an exquisite head, young, and very cleanly.
Really this "Female" individual of the breed Skye Terrier would
seem to be quite a lady-like little dog—with her beautiful silky coat of
snowy whiteness, variegated by spots of blue. One would think she
might almost accompany her mistress to an evening party, but for the
circumstance that her coat could not be taken off, and consigned along
with the burnous, or what's-ita-name, of the latter to the care of the
attendants. Blue, by the way, is a colour as pretty as it is remarkable
for the coat of the canine species to be tinged withal; and we should
like to know the chemistry of the blue spots of this singularly spotted
dog. We now begin to think that we understand what our sporting
contemporary means by "Toy Dogs," and suppose this is one of them.
The proposed "Pet" of a lady we suspect to be, to a certain extent, a
creation of the canine fancy, and so far to resemble the celebrated
Alice Gray, as to be partly what fancy has painted her. Ornament,
however, to her sex and species as she may be, she is not quite perfect.
She is capable of improvement. Let canine fancy complete its work
and render her altogether a Skye Blue Terrier.
A Lodger's Affection.
A witness on a trial last week before Lord Campbell, said of a
gentlewoman. "I never expressed any affection for her in particular,
except as a landlady." Will any lodger, first-floor or back-parlour,
define the sort of affection due, and how and when to be liquidated f

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

EVEN-HANDED JUSTICE.
readers may re-
member an in-
dictment at
this summer's
PedfordAssizes,
of a certain Su-
sannah Bas-
ket!, for man-
slaughter of one
of ber daughters
— a wretched
cbildofeighteen.
It is painful to
recall attention
to the hideous
details of fiend-
ish cruelty and
helpless submis-
sion which
marked the case
—the fourteen
. .—- «=-■ hours'daily slave-
ry at the lace
pillow, the three wretched children of this she-devil—with starvation,
cold, blows, and bestial indignities, till one of the poor sufferers fainted
at the work, and her cramped fingers refused to fix the pins,—yet even
then, the dying child was driven back to its task, without food or fire,
with blows and curses, till one night the other poor sufferers heard
their sister sing a hymn and utter a prayer—"Lord Jesus, let me do
my work next week !"—and then they heard no more. The sufferer
was past suffering. We must surely all remember with what natural
horror and righteous wrath we read the sickening story—even the
hardest of us.
At Bodmin, this same summer Assizes, was f ried another case of
brutal inhumanity—not shown, however, towards an unoffending child,
but on unresisting animals: one Simon Kniver had indulged his
cowardly and cruel nature in mutilating sheep. He was detected in
the act, tried, and found guilty.
Well—we will not measure human life against ovine. But no one
will quarrel with us, surely, if wc estimate them alike.
Let us see how tbe law, impersonated in one of our most august,
and one of our most learned, judges, dealt with these two cases.
Susannah Barrett, the modem Bhownrigg—worse than Brown-
bigg in this, that Barrett tortured to death her own flesh and blood,
while Bbowrigg practised on her parish apprentices—was sentenced to
four years'penal servitude.
Simon Kniver—the sheep mutilator—was sentenced to transportation
for fifteen years.
Mb. Baron Martin, in passing this sentence, remarked that "to
torture such an inoffensive animal as a sheep was beyond human con-
ception." We do not find recorded what Mr, Justice Coleridge
said in sentencing: Susannah Barrett.
Now, we do not complain that fifteen years' transportation was
awarded to Simon Kniver. But, if the Kniver—appropriately so
called—merited this punishment, what sentence would have fitted the
blacker guilt, the more devilish brutality, of Susannah Barrett P
How are we to understand the four years' penal servitude of Susannah
measured against the fifteen years' transportation of Simon? Is
the mutilation of thirty sheep by a shepherd more than the slow
starvation, with every addition of fiendish malignity, of three children
by a mother?
We would recommend Mr. Justice Coleridge and Mr. Baron
Martin to confer together after the long vacation, and settle the point
between tat m, for the quieting of their own consciences.
"No Objection."
Certain Englishmen, moved by a belief that' even soldiers who do
not carry epaulettes can bear a dinner, have benevolently resolved to
give a banquet to " the Guards on their return from tl>e Crimea," and
the advertisement that tells the country the fact, also adds the following
sustaining intelligence:—
'" His Royal Highness tee Coumander-ix-Chikf has no objection to this demon-
stration."
We should hope not. For the name of Cambridge is as inseparably
associated with a dinner as the name of Table-cloth.
THE EUPHRATES LINE.
On where will the century pause in its daring P
What region's past reach of the screw and the sail?
What sea is too wide for our wires overbearing P
What mountains too bigh for our levelling rail P
From the Banks of Newfoundland we pay out the cable
That's to bind North America fast to onr shore,
And, thanks to O'Shaugunessy, India is able
To change thoughts in an hour from Madras to Lahore.
And now the steam-giant, onr New World forsaking,
Having bound Europe's end?,—north and south, east and west,-
His terrible track through the Old World is making,
Where the grey Past's dead ashes she holds in ber breast.
By Nimroud's huge mound soon the ring of steam-whistles
W ill startle tbe stork on his desolate stand,
ADd the throb of the engine will shake the dry thistles
That wave their grey beards on Konyunjik'B parch'd strand.
By the arrow-head rows of the records of Babel,
The arrow-head flight of expresses will fly,
And Rawlinson, Latard, and Loftus be able
To drop in to decipher or dig, by-the-bye;
Instead of the trucks with their freight of horn'd cattle,
To Smitbfield consign'd along each British rail,
Weekly cargoes of huge wingel bulls down will rattle
For the British Museum, from Bus'rah to sail.
No secrets the hoar East shall keep in ber bosom;
Her riddles we'll soon have got out of the Sphinx.
What chance will she have, poor old sou), but to lose 'em,
When confronted by Birch, Botta, Nobris, or Htncks?
Old Cheops will stare from the top of his pyramis,
To see navvies cutting his mummy-pits through,
While from Nineveh's ruins the ghost of Semiramis
On a new red-brick station looks awfully blue!
But vain all our speeding on main or through mountain,
Our bridging the ocean, our binding the land,
Our drinking tbe gold's inexhaustible fountain,
That springs in Australia to each delving hand.
Vain, vain, all our moiling and driving and toiling,
Our working and winning, gold nuggets, gold sands,
Unless reverence and love join to wipe off the soiling
Of toil from our hearts, and of gain from our hands.
CONFORMITY WITH THE CONCORDAT.
Among tbe momentous events which are now constantly happening
on the Continent, the undermentioned august ceremony was to have
been performed, and we suppose was performed, the other day, at
Vienna:—
"To-morrow the clergy will be again in their glory, as his Majesty will pnblicly
place on the bead of tbe Archbishop of Acjbam the cardinal's hat which has been sent
him from Rome."
_ If this act—supposing it to have been enacted—was not a regular
piece of flunkeyism, we know not what flunkey ism is: and we ought
to know, reading the Court Circular, as we do, every day, and being
conversant, as we are, with genteel British society. Here the Em-
peror of Austria is represented, by the Times correspondent, as pro-
posing to perform the function of a valet for the Cardinal Arch-
bishop of Agram; and in all probability actually did that ecclesiastic
the menial service of put'ing oa his hat for him. We wonder if he
helped his Eminence on with his red stockings also, and those slippers

a Cardinal as well as by a Clown.

ARCADIAN SUMMER DRESS.
N interesting spectaole has been
presented, during the late hot
weather, by those uncommonly
fine fellows, the Porters of the
Burlington Arcade. All day long
they have remained _ on duty,
wearing their thick winter-coats
buttoned up 1o the chin. Now,
the Burlington Arcade is not far \
distant from the Royal Insti-
tution, and a lesson learned in
that' Temple of Science baa no
doubt received an application in
the adjoining Emporium. Tbe
master whose livery is worn by
the Arcade porters, has heard it
Btated, at the institution, in some
lecture, that woollen cloth is a
non-conducting substance in re-
lation to heat. He has learned
that such cloth keeps the body
warm in winter by preventing
the escape of internal heat. Ac-
cordingly, he has concluded that
tbe same cloth must, conversely,
keep the body cool in summer, by
opposing an obstacle to the ingress of heat from without. It is
necessary to mention this, because the remarkable and, as regards tbe
season, the very exceptional clothing of the Burlington Arcade
Porters has been ascribed to another cause, namely, to a motive of
economy on the part of their employer. Another reason why the
theory of their costume ought to be made known is, that the public
will be instructed by the knowledge thereof in a matter essential to
health and comfort. On the principle which has been observed in
dressing those men, the attire most suitable to the temperature of the
dog-days would be the Crimean winter-clothing; and the apparel of
the Esquimaux would really constitute the most reasonable fashions
for the tropics. ■■'
FINE EYES FOR EOOLI8H QIELS.
This periodical is not read by vain and silly individuals of the softer
sex; but it has a no small number of readers who take some interest
in individuals of that sex., and that sort. .Let such of our readers as
are interested in such individuals warn them of tbe mischief and injury
which they may perhaps be induced to inflict on themselves, by the fol-
lowing advertisement put foith by certain cosmetic-venders:—
ABRILLIANT EYE.—Bella-Donna produces a Beiluabt Eye.—
The ladles of Aula hold It In high repute for its quality to give brilliancy, vivacity,
and the power of fascination to the eye. Price 25. 6d.
Oh yes! ^Mropa Belladonna—deadly nightshade—produces a very
brilliant eye. It enlarges the pupil greatly, and occasions a charming
look of excitement and animation. Smear a little of tbe extract of
belladonna around the eye merely, and this highly desirable result will
speedily follow. - But it is well just to know the reason why: namely,
that the iris, the coloured part of the eye, a flat ring, with a hole in it
looking like a black spot, which is called the pupil, is paralysed by the
belladonna, and therefore gapes. The paralysis, to be sure, is but
temporary; and any young lady who wishes to enjoy the pleasure of
making her eyes look pretty for a short time, may dilate her pupils
with belladonna once in the way or so with apparent impunity. Since,
however, Nature never made the human iris to have tricks of this kind
played with it, it is probable that the habitual performance of them
would be resented by her: and Nature generally shows her resentment
of tricks practised on the bodily frame by punishing them with disease
in the part trifled with. How long a fool might go on tampering with
her iris by meats of deadly nightshade without impairing her sight, we
are not prepared to say; let any young lady who is foolish enough try,
for the benefit of science. But the female eye is in general sufficiently
brilliant, vivacious, and fascinating, if not too much so, without recourse
to belladonna: and if any stupid; girl thinks her eyes are not bright
enough, she had better cultivate her intellect to make them brighter.
MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT!!!
A Lady of Fashion incautiously walked up the Lowther Arcade last
Tuesday afternoon. She quite forgot at the time that she was in full
dress, and tbe consequences of her thoughtlessness have been most
deplorable. As the sails of her elegant but bulky costume flapped on
either side of her, some object of certu was swept remorselessly into
oblivion. The Arcade in a few minutes presented a fearful wreck.
The passage from one end to the other was strewn with sawdust and
bear's-grease, rendered doubly daogerous by innumerable bits of glass.
Tbe extent of the damage may be estimated from the simple fact that
it required not less than five carts to remove the broken fragments.
The following is tbe bill, which was presented, in all its horrible
particulars, to her the following day:—

gratitude, one of the vessels will be christened the Dizzy.
"A Dream at Sea."
As we lay not long ago tossing, or being tossed, on a bed of sickness
in a Boulogne boat, we went off into a state of semi-somnolency, in the
course of which we began thinking of all sorts of things, among which
B.ISTOBI and the Italian and French drama came uppermost,.and a

PUNCH AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.

No. II.—THE NINEVEH COURT (Continued).
Let us approach the faqade,
or exterior, sans fafon. It
is formed by winged human-
headed bulls, and gigantic
human figures. The prover-
bial generosity of an artist's
nature is shown in the fact,
that to all the former he has
given five legs. The Ninny-
vite Quinquepeds are very
imposing creatures. Observe
the elegant tassel at the tips
of their tails, likewise their
pleasing countenances and
unexceptionable wings. They
are supposed to be allego-
ries, and if their designers
could not point a moral, they could certainly adorn a tail. The human
figures (as Mb. Latard is polite enough to call them) represent
Hercules strangling a Lion • but again the domestic idea intrudes, and
we are irresistibly reminded of a peccant puss, about to undergo a mild
whipping.
We now enter the Central Hall. The Ninnvvites, although they
adorned their buildings with colossal forms, made the entrances very
contemptible, a peculiarity in which they have been imitated. The
forms of our Constitution are very imposing; but the mean ways by
which people get into the place where those forms are chiefly observed,
need no other comment than election blue-books. A tree is painted in
the ceiling, in utter defiance of the M'Ciioakumcihlds of N ineveh, who
thought that there should be no imagination in the Art that means
making images, and as doubtless there never was a tree in a ceiling,
except a roof-tree, such a delineation is opposed to fact. Here the prigs
before alluded to have a capital opportunity for emitting a bit of
Marlborough House cram. There is also a winged Globe in the same
place, and this is more capable of defence, as that excellent eveuing
paper is supported by "mighty pens," as the oratorio justly remarks.
The columns are copied from Persepolis and Susa, for no columns
were found in Nineveh. But Mr. William Hazlitt assures us that
Persepolis itself was built out of the spoils of Thebes, so here is
a clear case of a double thievery of columns, reminding one of the
weekly newspapers, which steal their columns from the daily papers,
and then complain of the piracy of the penny prints. Susa is a
pretty name, like Susan, (derived from the Bame word,) and means
Lilies; but the swindle alluded to makes us think of Miss Edge-
worth's "great Job-lilies," which were connected with the very
imprudent marriage of the barber, when the people danced till the
gunpowder ran out at the heels of their shoes.

don't let us meet those tiresome Bickerstatfs."—" Mr. Latard—
ah, to be sure, a very rising man—there's Lord Palmkkston—do go
and say a word for that poor stupid young Bladderwick, his mother
bores me to dea'h to get you to ask for something for him."
Having given this hint, Mr. Punch expects that it will be taken, and
merely proceeds to say that the manners and custom?, both in peace
and war, religions ceremonies, royal costume and pursuits, and other
characteristics of the most ancient empire of the world, may be studied
with perfect ease upon these marvellous walls. Ages before a wander-
ing metallurgist, called Hamilcon, first brought England into notice,
by condescending to come here for tin (a good many foreigners between
Hamilcon and Miss Joanna Wagner have honoured our shores for
the same purpose,) these paintings were executed, and if Art in
England makes no better signs of vitality than it has done hitherto, it
is far from impossible that ages after revolted Australia has success-
fully invaded Britain, and made a converted Kangaroo the President of
the Anglican Republic, the descendants of tbe invaders may respectfully
admire these Nimroud marbles, and wonder that their forefathers left
nothing of equal endurance. Mr. Punch is open to fight anybody who
says that in the above extraordinary passage he has not over-trumped
Mr. Macaulat and his celebrated ruins of London Bridge.
The Inner Chamber is ornamented with casts from sculptures at
Nimroud, all celebrating the exploits of the same King, and who reigned
about 1000 years before the Christian Era, a date supposed to be familiar
to most persons except Mr. Disraeli, who, in his Life of Lord George
Benlinci, does not make it clear that he knows where to fix it. In one
bas-relief tbe KiDg is sticking a bull—and does not stoop to the base
relief of having a guard to protect him from his victim, as some German
sovereigns do. He does his woik like a man. Also observe that the
five legs given to the bulls outside are balanced by only two legs being
given to the horses inside. The King may also be seen drinking, after
his [victory, and musicians are playing, but they do not seem to have
been playing polkas while he was killing his game from a safe distance.
Elsewhere he hunts a lion. The lion has a claw or hook at the tip
of his tail, to enable him to scratch himself in those hot climates.
There is also a siege, in which a battering ram is U3ed instead of a
battering train, and ancient science has the advantage over modern,
for the place is really being taken, north side and south side too.

All visitors looking round this hall have casts in their eyes, and these
casts have been taken from sculptures in the northwest palace at
Nimroud. They will repay a much closer examination than most
loungers condescend to bestow upon them. The ordinary amount of
comment vouchsafed to these marvellous reproductions is, Mr. Punch
regrets to say, rather compendious than critical. He cannot regard
such observations as "What Guys !" —" Haven't they got Jew
noses F "—" There's a rum bird, Bill !"—" See that chap tumbling
off the wall P "—" The feller in the cart is like our Sam ! "—in which
the humbler class of spectators chiefly display their acumen, as at all
exhaustive of the subject, any more than the refined observations of
their betters, who remark, "Dear me, how elaborate—did you ever see
such a bonnet as that which just passed? —" Nineveh, is it—0 jes—
it throws great light on sacred history—here, Henry, make haste,
VOI- XXXI.
Other military exploits are represented, aid also the King's trium-
phant return, on which, instead of bouquets, the heads of his van-
quished enemies arc being strewn in his path—let us hope "property
heads," just as some theatrical managers humbug the public by a shower
of " property bouquets " to an aitist whom it is desirable to puff. We
afterwardsrget a glimpse of domestic life, in four compartments of simul-
taneous actiOD, Jonathan Bradford style—only that the killing is going
on upon the ground floor, instead of upstairs, as in Mr. Eitzball's
improving drama. And, finally, there is a grand tableau of a stormed
city, in which everybody is shooting, scalding, stabbing, slashing, and
smashing everybody, with the profoundest contempt for the laws of
philanthiopy and perspective. It is pleasing to reflect that after about
3000 years of progress, (including ever so many new religions, printing,
railways, Bible societies, electric telegraphs, and Punch,) the most
enlightened nations of the world have just been but making materials
for another picture of exactly the same kind.
This reflection will make any reader of ordinary feelings so melan-
choly, that he will be glad to come away from the Nineveh to the
STArLES Court, and implore the aid of Ceres and Xeres, in the form
of a crust and a glass of sherry.
Public Baths at Dover.
Adventurous navigators who have visited the Polynesian Archi-
pelago, relate with wonder how the natives of that cluster of islands
came swimming, in a perfectly natural state, about the British vessels.
The bathing arrangements at Dover, we understand, are such as to
render a voyage to Polynesia quite unnecessary, for anybody fond of
studying the manners and customs of uncivilised people, and desirous
of witnessing that particular spectacle.

For the fat, layer by layer, my broad ribs laid upon!

And a cabin on deck they've constructed for me,
Padded and mattressed to ease ocean's tossage,
Pitched and caulked close 'gainst the wash of the sea.

A BITTER, BITING FROST.
John Frost, aged 72, has been graciously permitted to return to
Newport: the same Frost, who led certain Chartists where they were
rarely peppered; and for whom the scaffold was in a very active state
of preparation. John Frost has found some of his former disciples;
and found them, if possible, with longer ears than he left them; for
they listened to his rant against the Government with delighted bray-
ing; and further to prove themselves as nearly as possible allied to
donkeys, they dragged the vehicle of John Frost along the streets of
Newport. We fear that the ingratitude, the insolence of the pardoned
felon may tend to have a bad effect. When Mercy has removed the
bands of a prisoner, it is rather hard that, in return for the tenderness,
Mercy should immediately have her fingers FBOST-bitten.
The Art of Conversation.
Tour Creditor never loses sight of the real subject-in-hand of his
discourse. He never wanders or loses himself in foolish digressions.
More than this, he never forgets. Months may have elapsed since his
last interview with you, but his memory is so remarkably good that he
is sure to take up the conversation again at the very exact point where
he left it off.
A DRAMATIC BOAED OF HEALTH.
A Commission" was appointed some time ago in Paris to inquire into j
the merits of the plays produced during the year, and adjudge prizes ,
to those pieces which should be found most conspicuous for their
morality. We really pity the members of this dramatic board of
health, who have had to wade through all the filth which accumulates
in the various moral cesspools—underthe name of theatres—in the course
of a year. How the work could possibly be undertaken by any but a
company of professional scavengers is a marvel, but we are none the less
ready to give credit to the gentlemen who nave not shtunk from en-
countering the vapours of the most pestilential moral atmosphere of the
present day. The result unhappily is just what might have been ex-
pected, for M. Saint-Beuve has been charged to draw up the report of |
the commus ion. announcing the lamentable Tact, that not one of the dra- t *
matic works submitted to its examination is worthy of a prize. As the
condition was that the pieces found to be more moral than the rest!
were to be indicated, and as not one is fit to be mentioned, we can only
conclude that not a single production of the French dramatists during
the hit year has any morality whatever in its composition. No wonder
that our own stage is vitiated when there is nothing but poison in the
source fiom which it is supplied.
We knew the Parisian theatres were in a very unhealthy condition, •
but we did think it possible that here and there a stream of pure senti-
ment might have been found running like a little current of disinfecting
fluid through the great dramatic sewers, and we cordially congratulate
the French government on its having commenced the task of probing
the depth of the filth which has long sent forth its vapours to spread
infection over the whole of French society. The French government
having boldly looked into the Augean stable, and become acquainted
with the amount of the contents, may be expected to proceed to the
Herculean task of not only removing what has already been deposited,
but effectually guarding against the future accumulation of such foul
and offensive matter.
JENKINS IN AN APRON.
A Pompous Odd Fellow, writing to the Times to complain of what
appears to have been a somewhat exaggerated account of a disturbance
by his fraternity at the Crystal Palace, says that wine was "drank,"
and that: the Odd Fellows are "the elite of the working-classes."
We should strongly advise him to mind his English, and leave his
French alone, one word being about as stupid a blunder as the other.
The working men of England, who are worthy as well as odd fellows,
are just the men to put such a pump under another, for labelling them
with a bit of silver-fork snobbery, the elite of the working-classes!
Is Jenkins an Odd Fellow? Did the writer go on to say that after
their bxere, the guests had a little the dansante at fresco, and enfin, each
returned chez lui, enchanted with the fete a la fourchette? No doubt,
in conversation, the genteel creature would mince out an admission
that some of the elite might have been a little Eleeted, but that was a
mere Baggertell, everything being quite Commilfoe. The man signs
himself something in connection with " Manchester Unity," but nis
letter savours much more of Cockney Spoonity. If the orator whose
harangue was stopped by the musicians upon the occasion in question
talked in such style, we do not wonder that the band struck up iu self-
defence. Mr, Punch and the working-men of England are too old and
too«good friends and allies for him to suffer snobbery to play tricks
with them, or t heir good name. Jenkins shall have no share in their
junketings. The true steel shall not be genteelly electrotyped.
The Exile at Home.
Augusts Vacqtjerie has published a little book, in which he makes
known to the world all that Victor Hugo and his family do at home.
We earnestly wish all repose, all tranquillity to Victor, that the world
may continue to benefit by his inspirations! "We all work," says
Augusts; and then he tells us how Charles Hugo paints, and how
Mlle. Hugo phys "upon the piano some melody she has just found."
And then—"Madame Hugo is writing her husband's life. Nobody
could have written it as she will write it." How these pleasant reve-
lations distinctively mark the French and the English fireside! The
Englishman's home is his castle; the Frenchman makes his home a
house of glass.
Four Thoughts for a Fenny.
Conversation is a Republic that perishes the moment any one Bets himself up as a
Dictator.
Pedants who proscribe pleasantry are like cripples who decry dancing.
Children talk or what they are doing—young people of what they will do—and the
old of what they have done.
Our habits are at first the slaves of our desires, and at last their tyrants—like an old
servant, who begins by obeying us in all things, and ends by domineering over us.

THE NIGHTINGALE'S RETURN.
Most blessed things come silently, and silently depart;
Noiseless steals spring-time on the year, and comfort on the heart;
And still, and light, and gentle, like a dew, the rain must be,
To quicken seed in furrow and blossom upon tree.
Nile has his foaming rapid;, freshes from mountain snows;
But where his stream breeds fruitfulness, serene and calm it flows;
And when he over-brims, to cheer his banks on either side,
You scarce can mark, so gradual, the swelling of his tide.
The wings of angels make no stir, as they ply their works of love;
But by the balm they shed around, we know them that they move.
God spake not in the thunder, nor the mighty rushing blast;
His utterance was in the still small voice, that came at last.
So she, our sweet Saint Florence, modest, and still, and calm,
With no parade of martyr's cross, no pomp of martyr's palm,
To the placs of plague and famine, foulness, and wounds and pain,
Went out upon her gracious toil, and so returns again.
DRESS AND THE LADY.
THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME.
A Parisian company is advertising to carry people to London and
back for ten pounds: to keep them for a week, and indulge them with
a round of our Metropolitan gaieties. This treat is to include a visit to
the Theatre de sa Majesty, but as that agreeable establishment happens
to be at this moment closed, the visit will be rather a triste affair, even
supposing admission can be procured, which is more than dubious.
Perhaps a compromise may be effected by taking the party of pleasure-
seekers to another place of amusement, which may claim the title of
Her Majesty's Theatre, as it rejoices in the name of the Victoria. We
dare say our French visitors would find plenty of excitement in the
dramas of the New Cut, and would go away delighted with le cilibre
Hicks and.la seduimnle Vincent. Another attraction is the promise
of a dinner at the Crystal Palace, which is said to be worth the whole
of the ten pounds required for the entire trip; but we very much doubt
whether, even if the culinary resources of the place could produce a
dinner worth ten pounds, the tourists would be allowed to partake of it.
( Some years ago, lefameux diner de Greenwich was the grand feature of
; these trips; but we are afraid that our Parisian friends did not go away
'with a very favourable idea of the luxury; for second-rate fish at
a third-rate house is not acceptable even to an habitue qI a cheap French
restaurant.
No shouting crowds about her path, no multitudes' hot 1
To feed with wind of vanity the doubtful fires of faith;
Her paths by hands oifioial all unsmoothtd, her aims decried
By the Levites, who, when need was, passed on the other side.
When titles, pensions, orders, with random hand are showered,
"lis well that, save with blessings, she still should walk undowered.
What title like her own sweet name, with the music all its own P
What order like the halo by her good deeds round her thrown P
Like her own bird—all voiceless while the daylight songsters trill,
Sweet singer in the darkness when all songs else are stul—
She on that night of suff'ring that chilled other hearts to stone,
Came with soft step and gentle speech, yet wise and firm of tone.
Think of the prayers for her, that to the praying heart came back,
In rain of blessings, seeming still to spring upon her track:
The comfort of her graciousness to those whose road to death
Was dark and doubtful, till she showed the light of love and faith.
Then leave her to the quiet she has chosen : she demands
No greeting from our brazen throats and vulgar clapping hands.
Leave her to the still comfort the saints know that have striven.
What are our earthly honours? Her honours are in heaven.
A PENAL SENTENCE.
A PEARL NOT WORTH STRINGING.
There is a corpulent old lady frisking about the stage of one of the
Parisian theatres, and who is described in one of those little paragraphs
which constitute the puff columu of the Entr'acte, as the Pearl of
Andalusia. We do not at all object to the admission of the lady into
the family of jewels to which she is said to belong, but we fancy there
must be some little mistake as to the degree of her relationship. If
the paragraph-writer, instead of designating her a? the Pearl of
Andalusia, had conferred on her the more venerable title of the
Mother-of-Pearl, we should have been perfectly satisfied.
"Small crimes deserve death," said'Draco, "and I have no
further punishment for great ones." So he put everybody to death.
The Americans feel the same inconvenience. United States law has
just acquitted Mr. Herbert, the legislator who killed the waiter for
not bringing breakfast, and our cousins are puzzled to know what, if
you kill a monst«r for delaying your breakfast, you are to do to a
miscreant who is late with jour dinner. We fear we cannot help them
—unless, to be sure, we suggest that they should elect such a wretch
to their Senate. Under existing circumstances, that seems the worst
punishment that can be inflicted upon a civilised

A Literary Caper.
A Writer in the Times describes himself as " One who has served in

pondents more definite Aiguatures than the one in question, which might
be adopted with equal propriety by either a policeman or a beadle, both
of whom could claim the credit of having served in the cape." Tne
description is either too wide or too narrow; for if the writer wishes
to be guessed at, he has selected too comprehensive a signature, while
if his object is to remain concealed, he should not have adopted a cape
by way of a cloak.

POLICE REPORT EXTRAORDINARY.
What is to be thought of the following statement in the account of
a police case which ha' appeared in a contemporary? The defendant
therein alluded to is a Mr. Fredebick Ward, reported to have been
summoned before Mb. Corrie, at Clerkenwell, by George Mathew
Andrews, a cabman, for refusing to pay bim more than 'is. fare, when
he ought to have paid him 3»., and to have been ordered by the Magis-
trate to pay the Is. more, Is. costs, and 3*. for the day's work of the
plaintiff. Whereupon, according to the report,
"The defendant asked for a summons for abusive langnage, which was at once
granted, against the complainant. The offence proved was, that be said that 2s. was
not enough for a 3s. fare.
"Mb. Cohrik fined the Cabman 2s., wbicb was at once paid, the Cabman at the time
eiylng It was not Justice."
Comment on the foregoing quotation is simply impossible. We do
not know whether it is true or not, and therefore we cannot Ray which
of two certain persons ought to be turned out of Clerkenwell Police
Office. If the Magistrate ought not, the Reporter ought.
Russian Theatricals.
We hear that terms have been offered by the Manager of the Moscow
Theatre to Sir Charles Napier, to appear for a few nights only as a
real English sailor in a nautical drams. The Battle of the Baltic, as it
Wasn't, bas been written by a Russian dramatist; but up to tbe last
advices, we know not whether Sir Charles has finally accepted the
part. Much, we hear, will depend upon Sib James Graham, who, it
is rumoured, intends to visit Moscow. Should he do so, Sir Charles
will immediately close with the Manager, on the understanding that he
is to have a cutlass-combat with the ex-first lord of the Admiralty.
An Old-Maidism.—Love is blind, and Hymen is the oculist that
generally manages to open its eyes.
DREADFUL ACCOUNT^OF THE HARVEST.
From all parts of the country, we continue to hear the most, alarming
accounts of the condition of tbe harvest. In many places the wheat
has absolutely been carried. There is no place in which it does not
promise bountifully: and the expected result is a harvest of surpassing
abundance! If tnis be truly so, what is to become of us? For, as
prices keep up, as bread is dear, and meat still dearer, the greater the
produce,—we shall absolutely have famine prices in proportion to the
blessings of plenty. Surely a water-spout or two, with some terrific
hail-stones, and at least a partial blight upon all outstanding crops,
would promise a little relief for the poor, who, as plenty seems to rule a
rise in price, will be crushed with abundance.
We have heard a demoniacal remedy for these high prices; which,
be it understood, we are the last to recommend. Still, it has been
suggested that a fall might follow, if a few cornfactors were sewn up in
their own sacks to make their way out with their own teeth; and that
if two or three millers were set upon the wings of their own mills, we
might hope for a fall.
The Return of the Nightingale.
Miss Nightingale bas returned to her home. It is reported that
her arrival was preceded just one hour by the appearance of two milk-
white doves. If a swarm of bees find out an Emperor at Plombieres,
surely it may be taken as a truth, that a pair of doves have preceded a
Nightingale to Derbyshire.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

EVERY LADY HER OWN PERAMBULATOR,
A Plan Proposed to render the present stiff and imib
Dress useful as well as ornamental (?)
HOW CHARLOTTE "KEPT UP HER FRENCH."
"I suppose, Mb. Twiddlejohn, we 're not to be buried alive, this
summer, like the last?"
This supposition was hazarded at the breakfast-table of Dottangoeonc
Villa, Peekham Rise, in the summer of 1855.
"The Queen, there can be no doubt of it, goes to France"; but, of
course, we 're like nobody else—we are still to be buried alive."
Ma. Twiddlijohn looked up from his egg, and observed, with the
most aggravating coolness, enough to blister a saint if Mrs. Twiddle-
john had been in the Calendar, Make your choice, my dear; first, you
are not to be buried alive j and then, there's no help for it; you're to
be interred quick. Do decide, Mrs, Twiddlejohn."
"Decide, indeed! As if anybody was ever allowed to have a voice
in this house! I'm sure we might as well be out of the world; and
everybody says so."
"I believe, my dear, you went to Margate, last season?" said Ma.
Twiddlejohn, very mildly.
"What's Margate? Margate's not France. One might as well
have been at Gravesend! Everybody else goes to France; but then,
we 're like nobody; that is, you make us like nobody. And the house
wants painting; and, of course, we 're to stop and, be poisoned. And a
month or two in Paris would finish Charlotte quite.
"Finish Charlotte!" asked Ma. Twiddlejohn; and he brought
both feet down upon the hearth-rug, and steadied himself in his chair,
inviting and preparing himself for an explanation.
"What I mean is this, and you know it as well as I do. How is
Charlotte to keep up her French at Peekham P She would have,
they say, a beautiful accent; but then, that's how you bury your
children alive."
"Mabtha !" exclaimed Twiddlejohn, and his bald head coloured,
and he was about to strike the table with his clenched fist, when, dove-
eyed. Patience caught his arm in its descent, and he laid his opened
hand gently down, and mildly coughed, and serenely said— Very
well, my dear, we'll go to France. Yes, this season we'll go to
Boulogne."
"Boulogne is not Paris, Ma. Twiddlejohn. However, so that
Chablotte keeps up her French—"
Mb, Twiddlejohn departed for the City, and returned to dinner
with that enlargement of the commercial heart that is apt to ensue
when the commercial mind, having purchased for a rise, has obtained
it. After dinner, the day and the hour were named for departure from
Peekham to the hospitable shores of Boulogne. Chablotte—the
eldest daughter of three; Charlotte, who had just tripped over the
threshold of twenty-one, and with the motion had entered upon the
uncontrolled enjoyment of fifty pounds per annum left by a godfather—
Charlotte was flushed with hope and happiness; Boulogne was such
a sweet place ; and she would so comfort her mother by keeping up
her eldest daughter's French.
The Twiddlejohns arrived at Boulogne after a brisk passage, of
which we shall not attempt to give the stewardship. Apartments in
the most fashionable quarter of the city—the reader will Know by his
pocket where that is—were duly entered by the Twiddlejohns.
How vivacious was the place! How very unlike Peekham! Twiddle-
john, conforming to the elegant prejudices of the locality, bad alto-
gether as saline a look as any Triton. With no thought of the Gresham
Grasshopper, he would daily dally with his shrimps. With real
admiration of the troops of our faithful ally, Twiddlejohn would
throw open all the windows as the dear gallant fellows—as Chablotte
had been heard to call them—marched by. Once, indeed, Twiddle-
John, in the act of shaving, looked out from the casement, and with
lathered face, and razor in hand, nodded and beat time to the music,
as those little loves—w« pet Us amours, as Charlotte said, keeping up
her French—the Chasseurs d'Afrique, brass blowing and parchment
rolling, went harmoniously stepping on.
In a few days the Twiddlejohns had become the gayest creatures
of the gay element of Boulogne. Mas. Twiddlejohn had ceased to
reproach her husband with an organised endeavour to bury herself and
the children alive. Indeed, so hopeful was she of renewal of life, that
she purchased a brown straw-hat of most matronly circumference—a hat
that conveyed but one painful regret to the overshadowed observers,
namely, that Mas. Twiddlejohn, as though holding a check-string
upon the development of her own beauty, would, to the beholder, cut
her face in half—not but what there was left enough of it for any
temperate spectator. Twiddlejohn himself was so naturalised for
v'he .time, that he bad been known to play at dominoes at the Cafe
Vermont with a French corporal. Could the house of Child's have
looked in, Twiddlejohn had surely been requested to withdraw his
account.
On the second Sunday—Peekham congregations little knew it!—the
Twiddlejohns assisted at military divine service, as performed by
His Majesty's soldiers in the Honvault camp. The ceremony was very
imposing; and Twiddlejohn explained away the doubt arising to him-
self why it was music from operas should make a part of divine
service. Perhaps, he satisfied himself with the thought, that the
music of Der FreiscAiitz, with the casting of the bullets in the Wolf's
Glen, had a military application; and France was a military country.
So passed the time; and with every day it was manifest Chablotte
went keeping up, and still keeping up her French. "When Chablotte
likes," said the proud mother, "nobody would know her from a
Parisian."
"How do you know that?" said Twiddlejohn.
"Why Colonel Beaubeau says so."
"Colonel Bobo !" cried Twiddlejohn.
"Not a Colonel, yet," said Charlotte; "but he will be; everybody
is in his turn in the French army; It isn't as with us. In France, you
know, every drummer carries a field-marshal in his kit;" and
Charlotte spoke with animation; as though, indeed she knew
the fact.
"Tiiat must be bad upon a long march," observed Mr. Twiddle-
john; and his old gravity returned to his face. Indeed, he looked as
he was wont to look under his own walnut-tree at Peekham. "Mas.
Twiddlejohn, we've been here a month on Thursday: well, on Friday
we'll go home." •
"That's impossible, papa," said Chablotte, very vivaciously:
"Tout a fait; on Friday is the ball—I should say bal pare—at the
Utablissement."
"I think we've had balls enough," said the father.
"By no means," interposed Mas. Twiddlejohn; "otherwise how
could Charlotte have kept up her French? And Captain
Beaubeau"
"Not a Captain, quite, mamma," said Charlotte, blushing.
"Is he a full corporal?" cried Mr. Twiddlejohn. "But what is
it to us; whether he's a corporal, or a drummer that has to carry a
field-marshal, or—"
At this moment, Monsieur Roger, an avocat and friend of the
gallant Beaubeau, was announced. He begged a private interview of
Monsieur Tweetlejean. The Peekham merchant would meet any
man. The ladies retired. Mr. Twiddlejohn lifted his chair six
inches from the floor, bringing the chair with emphasis down again.
He then waved with his right hand to M. Roger, and then, as the
avocat and friend of Beaubeau the future field-marshal seated
himself, Mr. Twiddlejohn gave his visitor an instructive look of
defiance.
M. Roger, avocat, told the story of his errand in his best broken
English. His friend Beaubeau had danced four times at the etablisse-
ment at least with that angel, Chablotte. He was ordered upon foreign
service; but he was a man of honour, and he was resolved to marry
Chablotte ere he might fill a soldier's grave !—
Mr. Twiddlejohn jumped, perspiring, to his feet. M. Roger,
avocat, with the most polite self-will would not be interrupted.
—His friend was but a sous-lieutenant—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"What was that? A sous-lieutenant! Fellow not worth a penny!"—
—But his friend was a man of honour. In France la carriire etail ouverte aux taleiu! His
friend would doubtless die a field-marshal; perhaps, a duke: in the meantime he must marry
adorable Charlotte. Six young ladies—all belles Anglaises—had given thtir hands at the
last ball to lea ojieiers Francois.—
"What was that to him? His daughter should never marry—"
Mademoiselle Charlotte, in the full confidence of love—she had danced four times with
the brave Beaubeau—had informed him that she was just of age; and further, that she
possessed a yearly income of some twelve hundred and fifty francs, bequeathed by her sainted
godfather—
"And what of that?"—
That, said M. Beaubeau, was even a little beyond the sum required by the paternal French
Government of any young lady desirous of investing her affections in the person of a French
officer. In the service, no money, no matrimony. Now Beaubeau, sous-lieutenant, was a
man of honour!

Mb. Twiddlejohn was in a passion—a frenzy. But what availed paternal emotions?
Charlotte had danced four times at the £tablissement des Bains wkh a sous-lieutenant of
the Chasseurs cPJfrique; Charlotte was of age; Charlotte bad upwards of twelve hundred
francs per annum, and in a little week Charlotte me Twiddlejohn was Madame
Beaubeau.
Madame Beaubeau is not allowed to have quite a Parisian accent. Yet, as the mother of
two lovely boys—they have, to the amazement and annoyance of grandfather Twiddlejohn,
been christened Castor el Pollux—as the wife of a sous-lieutenant, and with little more than
twelve hundred francs a-year in_her own right, it is really wonderful How Charlotte
keeps up her French!
POLITICAL BALLOONING.
The history of the French war-loans show the Emperor's skill in raising the wind for
political purposes, but it is new to us to find the balloon used as the vehicle of a political
manifesto. We solider English would probably prefer our political alliances being made
public anywhere rather than in nubibus. But Frenchmen are more airy than we are; and,
probably, they may have thought, when M. Godard I contracted with the Municipal
Council of Paris, on the occasion of the Imperial fe',e in 1854, to carry up in his balloon four
ladies, representing.France, England, Germany, and Turkey, that such a quadruple alliance
could nowhere be so appropriately exhibited as "in the clouds." Unluckily, just as
the nationalities were about to enter the car, a ministerial order was transmitted to M.
Godard, directing him to leave Germany behind. Perhaps Britannia had objected to make
the ascent in such company. Perhaps the double-headed eagle had herself remonstrated at
Potsdam and Vienna, against Austria and Prussia soaring to the skies otherwise than on her
back, or even taking any flight whatever in such revolutionary and heterodox society.
Perhaps Turkey felt doubtful how far she and the eagles were likely to agree in the car. At
all events—whatever the reason—Germany was thrown over by authority, and compounded
for the dangerous honour of an alliance en fair" by "a dignified neutrality" on terra
firma.
Just as M. Godard was about to start with his diminished freight, a violent south-wester
began to blow over the field of Mars, and M. Godard found—as more dignified persons may
have found since—that the houri who did duty for Turkey was decidedly in the way—that the
Ottoman Porte was by no means the best port in a storm—and that our Mohammedan ally
had better be left behind to avoid the disagreeable necessity of throwing her over. Of
course the outraged nationality of Islam remon-
strated, through the TurkiEh Ambassador. The
allies, he said, were bound to stand or full with
Turkey, and M. Godard and France and Eng-
land ought to have risked their necks rather
than give such a setting down to their Turkish
sister. The Municipality of Paris took the same
view, and refused to pay M. Godabd, as having
not only violated his contract, but risked the
peace of Europe. In vain the aeronaut protested
that diplomatic complications were nothing to
him, and that all he feared was the chance of
entangling his valve-roe1 s. The civil tribunal
refused to recognise M. Godard as a diplo-
matic personage, and adjudged the Municipal
Council to pay him his full claim, deducting a
hundred franc j for the costume of Geimany, who
didn't go up, but who has, on the contrary, been
going down ever since.
ISLE OF SERPENTS.
France and England, hang not o'er us,
Leave us here alone a while;
Fortune may perhaps restore us
This convenient little Isle.
Will you, to evacuate it,
If we linger, us compel?
All concession, how we hate it!

Let us stay a little longer
Where we are, and wish to be;
By and by we may be stronger,
If we '11 go then you shall ste.

ture of a new carpet of

at least, premature. As

BEITISH JURIES' AMENDMENT ACT.
people are aware of the nature of the security provided, by the
abundant wisdom of our ancestors, for the sufficient wisdom of the
Lord Mayor of London. Some, however, may require to be informed
that it consists in obliging the Lord Mayor Elect, as the condition of
being entitled to seat himself in his Chair, to count certain hobnails,
and to chop a given number of sticks. The consequence, or at least
the sequence, of this precaution for insuring the rationality of Lord
Mayors is, that our Civic Monarch enjoys a celebrity which is not
merely European, but also Asiatic, African, American, and Australian.
Our lively neighbours and allie?, in particular, regard him with the
most distinguished consideration, his customary appellation among
them being Le Grand Lord Maire."
Seeing that this provision for the intellectual ability of Lord Mayors
has worked so remarkably well in their case, it is intended to extend
it to the case of other persons who are called upon to exercise judicial
functions much more important than those of a mere Magistrate ; they
having often not only to decide questions concerning property to a
large amount, but also to adjudicate on matters of life ana death. The
British Juryman has been lately distinguishing himself by the most
ridiculous deficiency in common sense and ideas of justice, that any-
body out of the Asylum for Idiots can be conceived to labour under.
Twelve British Jurymen, whose duty it was to pronounce on the guilt
or innocence of certain persons charged with murder, have concurred in
a verdict worthy of twelve jackasses capable of articulating. Twelve
other British Jurymen have exhibited an ignorance of the constitutional
law of libel only less disgraceful than that of the judge, with whose
advice their decision accorded. It is felt that this kind of thing must
not go on. Wrong and ruin will be inflioted right and left; innocent
person* will be hanged, and miscreants will be turned loose on society,
if British Juries continue to be generally devoid of common sense. A
bill is therefore in preparation, and will, if possible, be introduced at an
early period next session, necessitating every individual summoned to
serve on a British Jury, to chop sticks and count hobnails after the
manner of the Lord Mayor. All those who prove unable to perform
the said tasks, will be sent to an institution for persons of " defective

We feel no compunction in quoting the venerable declaration,
"When bad men combine, good men should unite." Our reason for
this hardihood lies in the circumstance, that a meeting of gentlemen
was convened at the Waterloo Booms, Edinburgh, on Friday last, "for
the purpose of expressing practical sympathy with the Scotsman news-
paper, in regard to the verdict of £400 damages obtained against it
for defamation at the instance of Mr. Duncan M*Laren." The
Chairman, Sir William Gibson Cbaig, formerly M.P. for Edinburgh,
made some sensible remarks; concluding as follows :—
"The words founded on had been used in the heat of an excited contest, and amid i
great provocation, and if it was in future to be held that such conduct of such public
men was not open to such comments, there was an end to all freedom of political
discussion in Scotland. It would be impossible to express contempt at political
apostasy, disgust at abandonment of principles, or indignation at any coalition, how-
ever disreputable, without the danger of being brought before such a jury. He trusted
that by the exhibition of practical sympathy they should now make they would convert
the defeat of the Scotsman into a triumph, net only for that paper, but the liberty of
the press throughout the country."
To these sensible words succeeded conformable action:
"Resolutions were moved protesting against the verdict, and originating subscrip-
tions to pay the damages and expenses of the action. The subscription list was headed
by sib William and Mb. Adam Black, M.P, each contributing £20; Mb. Charles
M'Labkv, ex-editor, giving £100. The damages and costs win, it is understood,
amount to about £1,000; nearly £400 of which have been already coUected."
This is the way to defeat the designs of twelve jurymen combining
to crush a newspaper, which, in contending for liberty, offends their
fanaticism, ridicules the cant wherein they delight, and exposes the
hypocrisy which they love.

LINES BY A SCOTCHMAN
(On reading that an Act of the Australian Legislature against
the Growth of Thistles received the Royal Assent on the
19M of March).
What this? Forbid the growth o' Thristles,
Auld Scotia's cherished symbol-flower—
The hair upon ma head it bristles,
At sic an awfu' waste o' power!
'Tis idle wark, as time will show,
To root the bonny plant frae ground;
For Nature still gars Thristles grow
Where canny Scots are to be found.
What soil so puir but it can keep
A Thristle green amang its stanes?'
What land so bare a Scoteman deep
Canna pick something ail its banes?'
As weel keep bees frae honey-pcts,
Keep cats frae cream, or bairns frae tarts,
As Thristles and their brither Scots
frae lands whaur goud is found i' quartz.

This stage is, henceforth, to be watered with rose-water..
The Times "gives fair warning" that it will impale all
importers of foul French wares upon its iron pen, even as
cockchafers are impaled—there they shall huzz and die-
Great has been the consternation in the translation market.

said, an immediate sale of their pioperties; and a white
satin cloud that for so many nights carried Marguerite t*
heaven, has been presented to a distinguished critic, who,
in the form of a waistcoat, will turn the "silver lining
of that cloud upon evening parties. In fact, the Corsican
Brothers, it is said, have henceforth determined to wash
their hands of all that sort of thing. We believe it will
take an alar'uing quantity even of the best Windsor Castle-
soap to wash them perfectly clean.
THE REV. MR. MOB.
The town of West Hartlepool has lately been enlivened with an
extraordinary series of performances, arising from a row between the
Rev. Mr. Bubgess, the incumbent of a church lately erected there,
and Mr. Jackson, the gentleman who built the church. We know
nothing of the grounds of quarrel in the case; but when we read that
Mb. Jackson, unable to oust Mr. Bubglss by other means, proposed
to build up the doors of the church—that bricks and mortar were
actually carted down to the church for the purpose—that Mr. Bubgess
nevertheless declared he'd stay where he was, and appealed to the mob
to assist htm in resisting this new form of intra-mural interment—
that the mob took him at bis word, filled the sacred edifice, burlesqued
the church services, preached comic discourses from the pulpit, smoked
short pipes on the communion table (all the while, it would seem,
being Mr. Bubgess's mob, and not Mr. Jackson's)—we know enough
to conclude that the reverend gentleman is bringing a great scandal on
the Church, and that, be Mr. Jackson never so much in the wrong,
Mb. Bubgess had better pocket his wrongs and leave the place, than
stay to be the motive of such desecration, and the source of such
unseemly strife.
We trust the reverend gentleman is not ambitious of encroaching on
the domain of Billingsgate, and of creating a "Bubgess's Church
Sauce " to rival the fish-sauce hitherto known in connection with his
patron} mic.
How Women Veil the Truth.
Whin a woman says of another woman "she has a good figure,"
you may be sure that she is freckled, or that she squints, or that she is
marked with the small-pox. But if she simply says, "she is a good
soul," you may be morally certain that she is both ugly and ill-made.
A Household Truth.—A mother-in-law in an establishment is a
rare good servant, but a precious bad mistress.
THE APEX OF GLORY IN FRANCE.
he French scientific world
has been in a state of what—
to coin a word—we can only
describe as cock-a-whoopish-
ness, at the discovery some-
where or other, of a "fossil
ape," which has given rise to
a great variety of very learned
articles in several of the
Parisian journals. A writer
in the Consiilutionnel, after
devoting a full column to the
ape in all its branches, goes
off into a burst of enthusiasm
for the honour of his coun-
try, and concludes by stating
that all the fossil apes in
tbe world if added together
would amount to half-a-dozen. "Of these," exclaims the French
patriot, "Greece possesses one, England has two, while France
toujours privilegee enjoys the advantage of three." We must admit
that if the possession of monkeys—fossil or otherwise—is really a
privilege, France is especially favoured, and the scientific world of
Paris must find perpetual reason to rejoice.
When Voltaire described his countrymen as combining the ape
and the tiger in their disposition, he was thought to have been
guilty of a sarcasm; but it seems that the French scientific world is
prepared to accept one half at least of the comparison as a compliment
to the national character. We should not have been so uncourteous as
to have attributed moakeyism or apishness to our neighbours and
allies, but since the quality is claimed as a privilege of the French by
their own savans, we are much too polite to dispute the point with
such very learned authorities.

MR. PUNCH'S DESIGN FOR A STATUE TO MISS NIGHTINGALE.
Besides, was not the reign of the present,
Em>EROR of Austria inaugurated by hangings?
It is remarkable, in connection with this cir-
cumstance, that the officer in command of the
Austrian soldiers who put to death Cickruac-
chio, his children, and the other persons whom
th»y bad no right to meddle with, was a member
of the Imperial family. No doubt they all hang
together.
If, therefore, foreign professors of the halter
are to be encourag-d, like so many other foreign
artists, to afford this country the advantage of
their ingenuity in their own peculiar line, let ap-
plication be made, in the first instance, to the
Austrian Government for the required assistance.
Ihe status of the hangman will be improved
by the importation of Austrian competitors;
for the office is evidently one of honour in the
dominions of Francis Joseph, and any other
dominions occupied by his gallant troops, who
volunteer its performance, and are, doubtless,
as handy with the rope as they are with the
rifle. Perhaps His Majesty will send us that
distinguished member of bis family who com-
manded the gallant party, all volunteers per-
haps, that executed those above-mentioned sub-
jects of the Pope on account of his Holiness.
We shall doubtless receive with all the honours
due to his exalted rank and elevating pursuit,
that amateur Imperial assistant of Under-
sheriffs, and Bhall unanimously agree in no-
minating him Arcii-Jack-Keich.
HAPSBURG vice CALCRAFT.
Hanging, with which, not long ago, the public appeared to have got nearly disgusted, seems
of late to have in some measure recovered its popularity, or rather its place in the affections
of tbe educated and governing classes. It is true that Celestina Somxer escaped the
gallows, but did not the Home Secretary hang Martha Brown? and if the former's crime
was one of the most cruel murders on record, was not the offence of the latter mere man-
slaughter committed under the extenuating circumstances of extreme provocation P From
one extreme the Government will of course run into tbe other, and the executioner, in that his
office is no sinecure, will differ even more widely than he now does from the Cathedral Canon.
The increasing employment of the gallows will probably prove a stimulus to the attain-
ment of excellence in the Executioner's department of High Art: and then, as a necessary
consequence, we shall have foreign ability invited to compete with British talent. Application
will naturally be made to Germany; but, we would suggest, chiefly to that particular portion
of Fatherland called Austria.
A letter has been written to a Genoese paper by General Garibaldi, stating that poor
CiCERUACCBio, the popular orator of the modern Romans, and his two sons, boys under
age, together with four other persons, one of them a chaplain, have been barbarously
■hot, in cold blood, at Coutarins, near the mouth of the Fo, by Austrian soldiers commanded
by an officer of the Imperial family. Since, even if Ciceruacchio had rendered himself
liable to be shot, His Holiness the Pope was the only person legally qualified to shoot
him, this abominable act on the part of the Austrians was an officious exercise of the office
of the finisher of papal law. It shows thea to be born with a natural turn for that officer's
vocation. i

Of twice six guineas, by the day,
In Mr. White's hotel to stay.
Unto Southampton's Town she came,
Preceded by the goddess Fame,
Who with her swift wings did outstrip,
By many a league, the Ex-Queen's ship.
On board that vessel, Fame averreJ,
She ne'er had from her cabin stirred,
And whilst upon the ocean wave,
Did never once her person lave.

To be a wonder, be allowed.

CRIMEAN CHRISTIAN NAMES.
N the arrival of the glorious
news of the battle of Alma
in this country, a contem-
porary suggested that the
venue of the British victory
might appropriately suggest
a name for the daughters of
Britain. We are informed
by a Registrar of Births,
that this suggestion has been
considerably improved upon
by divers persons, who have
christened children not Alma
only, but likewise Inker-
mann. To what extent this
idea has been carried out we
do not know, but are quite
prepared to hear of infants
to whom their godfathers
and godmothers have given
the names of Balaclava and
Kertsch. Some children
have perhaps been called
Scutari, and we can imagine,
indeed, that all the localities
in, or connected with, the Crimea which have been the scenes of any
transaction redounding to British credit, may have been resorted to for
the purpose of deriving from them denominations for British babies.
It is not quite so likely that in very many instances a child has been
called Redan.
Alma, indeed, is a pretty, and a truly proper female name in itself;
and there is only one objection to it; an objection to which all the
other Crimean names, considered as girls' names, are equally open.
Some thirty years hence, if not sooner, they will be suggestive of a
certain date, which, for reasons best known to themselves, as we will
gallantly say, almost all ladies thirty years old, and not a few under
thirty, do not wish to' be known.
There is nothing to be said against Inkermann, applied to a boy, who
is expected to live to be a man; but of course nobody in England or
Scotland would think of Inkere»«8* as a name for a woman.

"OUE LADY OF BOULOGNE."
"Boulogne-sur-Mer, August 25.
"We have had a very pretty show performed here in honour of Our
Lady of Boulogne. The dresses and decorations were so appropriate
to the occasion that, as one of the last French novelties, I should not
be much surprised if it was translated to the Theatrical Furniture
Warehouse in Oxford Street- Our Lady of Boulogne is, of course,
the especial patroness of this vivacious bathing-place; and is duly
venerated by the pious townspeople who, doubtless, owe to her inter-
cession the annual glut of English visitors that, thick as herrings on
the Scottish coast, come hither to be caught and made the most. of.
Our Lady of Boulogne, represented by a miraculous statue, was once
upon a time brought hither in a boat; and at the present hour exer-
cises her benign influence on the boats of the South-Eastern Company,
filling them with guileless and gullible English. This is all very well;
and, as an Englishman, with a proper reverence for trade in all its
branches, I do not object to Our Lady—I mean their Lady's—daily
miracles as manifested in that interesting event; the landing of wave-
tossed passengers on the port, to the satisfaction and even to the
merriment of their blithe predecessors, all of whom look and laugh as
though sea-sickness was a dream and the steward a myth. Our Lady
of Boulogne, I am willing to believe, fills Boulogne; and the natives
have at least gratitude on their Bide when they reverence her Ladyship
accordingly.
"I hope I am tolerably tolerant. I certainly do not think the priests
I meet hereabouts are invariably the outward types of human devotion.
They do not all seem to have refined themselves to spirit; but now and
then show a considerable amount of human clay, or dirt, or mud
in their faces, smacking of the duat of Adam very much after the
Fall. Many of them breathe that peculiar odour of sanctity best
apprehended by the most delicate nostril. I say, I hope I am tolerant;
and therefore do not, like young Spoonbill, call these sable persons
black-beetles, never meeting one of them without giving a certain
scraping action sf the foot, as though the poor beetle was never
trodden upon but to the inhuman delight of the destroyer. I say I am
tolerant, and can therefore keep my temper when 1 am desired to
observe that a certain biped in black is to be considered as a faithful
fingerpost to heaven; however, looking at the thing, my feelings may
run a little counter to the piety of the general prejudice.
"Thus, at the show of Our Lady of Boulogne, I contemplated clouds
[ of white muslin, in which were young women, women no longer young,
with not a few of the sex in black and grey who never had been young.
I observed with becoming serenity, one stalwart English female bearing
a banner, very proud, indeed, of her burden. And still keeping my
temper, I saw a lad robed to personify Him who disputed with the
Elders; and calmly wondered what the boy would for all future time
think of himself as the highway representative of the Light of the
World.
"I did not sneer at the relics borne on the shoulders of young lady-
pupils, boarded and taught at the fullest and highest, at so many
pounds per annum, at so many of the schools of this abiding-place of
scholarship; I saw without flinching "the heart of gold, containing
the hand of the ancient miraculous statue" of Our Lady of Boulogne
aforesaid: I saw the entire statue of the Lady in her boat, and was tran-
quil under the infliction; but when I saw a banner on which, in plain
English, Our Lady op Boulogne is supplicated to pbay poe the
Cox version op England, I confess it, I felt the appeal to be as untimed
as unnecessary.
"For I should like to see or even to hear of the Englishman, woman,
or child, who—landing here—has not been in some way converted by,
doubtless. Our Lady of Boulogne working in the pious and responsive
breasts of tradesmen, lodging-bouse keepers, marketwomen, fish women,
and all and sundry others P Why the better half of Boulogne has been
built by such conversion! Brown, Jones, and Robinson converted
into hard cash, turned into so much ready money, are hoarded in
Napoleons, or invested in houses and lands. The conversion of English-
men stares in the countenance of the grocer, and looks comely in the
face of the washerwoman, politely known as blanchisseuse. The one-
eyed old Pomona who under the shadow of St. Nicholas, sells me a
peach for eight sous—a peach that I could buy better for two-pence in
dear, historic Covent-Garden, still redolent of cabbage-stumps and
Fox and Liberty—that half-extinguished matron has for thirty years
and upwards so largely enjoyed the conversion of England, in the
metallic conversion of England's sons and daughters, that she might, if
she would, make offering to Our Lady of Boulogne, of an average crop
of golden golden pippins in a wheelbarrow of virgin silver.
What need, then, of other conversion? I therefore calmly, humbly,
but withal earnestly, solicit Mgr. PEveque d'Arras, de Boulogne, et de
St. Omer, that in any future ceremony acted under the patronage of
His Lady of Boulogne, the Conversion of England should be per-
mitted to proceed after the old customary manner, Her Ladyship
merely dealing with the pocket, and renouncing as hopeless, or, as in
fact, unworthy of her attention, the heart and head of heretical Albion.
"I remain, Mr. Punch, your obedient reader,
"Martin Chalkclipp."
GENTLE SATIRES.
If 70a ask a lady to walk out with yon, she first looks at your dress, and then thinks
of her own.
If a woman holds her tongue, it is only from fear she cannot " hold her own."
Notice, when you have accompanied your wife to huy a lot of things at her favourite
shop, what ostentatious care she takes of your interest in Beelng that you get "the
right change."
How much more difficult it is to get a woman out on a wet Sunday than on a wet
week day. Can the shut shops have anything to do with this?
The oddest mnemonic curiosity is, that a woman, who never knows her own age,
knows to half an hour that of all her female friends.
A woman may laugh too much. It is only a comb that can always afford to show its
teeth.
Women will never be punctual. They scorn the " charms" that hang to a watch-
chain.

FIVE MINUTES' EARNEST ADVICE
TO
FEMALE DRIVERS AND CONDUCTORS OP PERAMBULATORS.
It is not in the least necessary to look where yon are driving to. If
there is a balloon up above, amuse yourself by staring at it; if there is
a burst pipe in an area down below, feast your eyes on the interesting
spectacle; if there is a Punch and Judy show by the side of you, fit
your gaze steadily on its dramatic incidents, and go on wheeling all the
time. The Perambulator will move almost of its own accord, and all
you have to do is to push it uninterruptedly forward.
If you are on the edge of a piece of water, or skirting the banks of a
river, never mind letting go your hold of the carriage. It may run
down the steep declivity, and be carried by its own weight into the
water, and the children may fall out of it, and be drowned;—but what
of that? It is an accident, and though your regrets may not be able to
repair the calamity, still it cannot in any way be attributed to your
carelessness in guiding the Perambulator.
If you meet with anot her Nurse similarly engaged, join Perambulators
with her, and then trundle gaily along, side by side, in the middle of
the pathway. Three Perambulators, however, are better than two, and
four have a decided advantage over three. The great object is to send
the pedestrians into the gutter—so that, if you can block np the entire
pavement, so much the better. Chat familiarly with your companions,
and let your thoughts, as well as your eyes, be fixed anywhere but on
the children.
If your drive should be on a great height, or the top of a cliff, be
sure you go as near the edge of it as possible, for then a stone, or a
stick, or a tuft of grass, or any small obstruction, may throw the Per-
ambulator off its equilibrium, and send the children flying over the
precipice.
The same advice applies to all piers, jetties, bridges, planks, high
embankments, and pathways that are above the level of the road. A
slight fall, or a little shaking, may frighten the children and break the
carriage, but you cannot be expected to have your eyes everywhere at
once; and if you are looking at the time at a killing soldier, or a most
taking policeman, it stands to reason you cannot see where the Per-
ambulator is going to.
In sauntering through the streets of a town, it is not necessary to
see if any cellar-doors or traps are left open; for if you exercised any
ordinary degree of vigilance, there would be no chance of an accident
occurring, and you might as well be carrying the infant in your arms
at once.
Wheel the carriage always straight a-head. If any old gentleman
has his toes run over, he is to blame and not you, for he ought to have
seen you, and why didn't he get out of the way?
Keep up the same speed in a crowded thoroughfare as in a quiet
one. Do not slacken your pace when you are passing picture-shops,
and dash on, heedless of any impediment there may be in your way, if
you see a herd of cattle driving down the street. In getting over a
crossing, rush recklessly forward, and don't wait to see if any cabs or
omnibuses are coming on either side.
Flirt, laugh, converse with all gay companions you meet, and enter
freely into the nonsense of any admiring defender of your country (be
he dressed in red or blue), who in his fervour comes up to talk to you.
Should you be invited in anywhere to partake of any refreshment, do
I not mind leaving your Perambulator at the door to shift as it can for
itself.
Lastly, always look behind rather than before you, and think of
yoursell a great deal more than of the little dears entrusted to your
i charge. _ Should they be accidentally spilt on the ground, the least you
I can do is to pick them up again. Above all, if any serious accident
i should occur, never mind about leaving the Perambulator and its frail
contents in the street behind you; but run home instantly, as quick as
your legs can carry you, and tell your mistress of it. You need have
no fear of any one running away with the children, and as the Peram-
bulator most probably will be broken all to sticks, no one will think of
touching that; consequently, both will be safe till your return.
Small Shot.
The ducked Lawyer dreads the pump.
A Doctor feels the pulse each time, to let his patient see with what
minute care he is keeping watch.
The Trumpet of Fame is often mute for the want of a good trum-
peter to blow it for one.
DRESSING IN AMEBIC*..
A Young lady writes from Newport, an American watering-place,
that " We have to dress about nine times a-day here." Young ladies at
Newport with their nine dresses must be like nine-pins; no sooner set
up than down again.
SONG OF THE HARVEST.
'Tis a wonderful thing at this time o' the year,
That there's hardly a pleace where to goo vor good beer;
The most of the ales as the publicans sells
Tastes just like the yaaprons o' brewers' men smells.
Pale ale, to be sure, you may git now and then,
But what is sitch stuff unto labourun men F
And 'tis all very well Lunnunporter and stout,
Which, if you can't git 'um, why you goos without.
'Tis a strornary vact, when you comes for to think,
In this here hot saison, this taint in our drink,
Of perwision of Natur' we oftentimes hear,
The contrairy whereof is experienced in beer.
I told this to one o'that are Band o' Hope,
Whose ways I renounces as much as the PorE;
He answered, "I '11 tell 'ee the rason, old chap—
Natur' means for to keep thee away from tby tap."
"Well, neighbour," I says, "if that's Natur's design,
How is it as Natur' don't damidge Port wine?
How is it a don't spile rum, brandy, and gin.
Refreshments which you calls as much or moor zin?"
This abut up his mouth, as you would, I suppose,
By puttun a pot o' beer under his nose;
But how much discourse can a feller pursue,
That drinks not him but water, and tea, and sky-blue?
The truth o' the case is, as Whatshisname said,
There "s a many more matters up there, over head.
As we never dreams of, and also down here,
And one on 'um is this disorder o' beer.
No doubt but we can't understand all we zee,
But the moral of most things is open to wr,
According to which, if you lights on good beer,
You'd better stick to't at this time o' the year.

Advice to Wealthy Vicars.
How to obtain A thbee teabs' holiday.—Habitually get drunk,
or swear, and disregard the remonstrances of your neighbours, until you
get cited, in the Ecclesiastical Court and suspended for three years,
which will save you all professional labour, and only oblige you to keep
a curate. You will be able to get one for £100 a-year at most, and he
will have to do all your duty, whilst you will be secured from all
censure for neglecting it, which would not be the case if you merely
kept a curate at once without getting yourself suspended.
Long Speeches.—Mb. Wilkinson says that when our great par-
liamentary orators rave for hours about their love of couutry, they
mean then: love of talking.

haps, with his drink. It may be that he will have to eat some quantity
of dirt in a metaphorical way, by-and-by.
King Bomba also accuses the revolutionary Central Committee of
Italy of having put a price upon his head. He states the sum at
100,000 ducats. That is too much.
State of the Wine Market.
Notwithstanding the ravages of the oidium in Portugal, and the
consequent probability of an extensive failure of the vintage, the prices
of Port wine rise little, if at all, above the average. The very slight
alteration in the state of the market may be accounted for by the
expectation of an abundant crop of sloe and elderberries.
Logwood is looking up, and an unusual briskness has been evinced

TRENCHERMEN FROM THE TRENCHES.
Everybody believed that the Lions had departed from the Surrey
Gardens, once zoological, now euphonious. The noble anin als were
supposed to have gone never to return. Never again, men thought,
would they wag their mighty tails to the admiration of multitudes,
never with their roarings astonish the weak minds of the little boys.
The feeding hour of the carnivora was imagined to have fled for ever.
Nevertheless, the Surrey Gardens were destined to afford, once more
at least, an exhibition of Lions beyond all comparison the finest Lions
in the world. Some individuals are accustomed to enlarge on the
achievements of Alexander the Great, some to extol the deeds of
Pericles. Others usually expatiate on Conon's exploits; very many
applaud the acts of Lysander, and not a few delight in eulogising the
character of Alcibiades. But of all those heroic personages,
whose names are historical, there is not one who, in respect of
that gallantry for which they were distinguished above their contem-
poraries, if in any other respect whatever, can bear a moment's compa-
rison with that miracle of physical development and undaunted courage,
the admiration of surrounding Europe abroad, and of the fairest portion
of humanity at home—the British Soldier.
Our readers will by this time have divined that the Lions to whom
we allude in the foregoing remarks are those Crimean Lions, who, by
their performances in the presence of delighted crowds, on the Roast
Beef of Old England, on Monday last, presented the British Public
with so splendid a substitute for the Carnivora that used to dine for its
daily diversion at the Surrey Zoological Gardens.
Iron Trade Circular.
The Iron Trade has never evinced its metallic character so strongly
as in its neglect of the indigent relatives of Henry Cort, the man
to whose inventions so much of their opulence is owing. JS the chiefs
of the Trade fail to do something for those poor people, they will not
merely prove themselves to be thoroughly iron-hearted, but we shall
understand, in a new sense, what kind of pigs are meant by pigs of
iron.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

KNOWLEDGE OF COMMON SAINTS.
£ observe with much pleasure
that a little book has been pub-
lished at a little price, under
the title of the Life and Time)
of St. Pancras. A popular
Hagiology is really very much
wanted. Most people are de-
plorably ignorant on the subject
of our parochial and street-
saints. Their names are as
familiar in our mouths as po-
tatoes, but few of us know any
more about them than about
the Man in the Moon. The1
comparison is made advisedly.
We talk of the Man in the,
Moon; but without any definite J
idea of the Man; indeed with
not much of any serious belief
in the Man's existence. In a
very similar manner we speak
of St. Mart-le-Strand, St.
Martin-le-Grand, and Sr.j
Clement Danes. Who was
St. Maby-lb-Stband, and was
she the same St. Mabt as St.
Mart Axe, or somebody else P
Was St. Martin-le-Grand identical with the St. Martin whose name
is associated with the Fields now occupied by the Nelson Column, and
the ginger-beer Fountains, and King George the Fourth apparently
riding his horse to water? Was St. Clement a Danish saint, or, as
his name would imply, "more an antique Roman than a Dane." What
was the history of Sr. Lawrence Pountney? Was he an Alderman
who came to be canonized; or was he the Sr. Lawrence who is
said to have been broiled. There is a Metropolitan parish called
St. Margaret Moses. Was this lady a converted Jewess, and is she
included in the ancestry of Messrs. E. Moses and Son. Another St.
Margaret who presides over another London pariah rejoices in the
surname of Fattens. Mrs. Gamp, for all her aversion to Popery,
might adore this saint; but how did Margaret acquire the appel-
lation of Pattens? Perhaps it was a sobriquet, applied to Margaret
in consequence of her having, in the course of her earthly pilgrimage,
been much in the habit of wearing those defensive but comical
supplements to shoes. Among the saintly qualities of St. Mildred
Poultry was there any peculiar fondness for fowls, and was she the
saint to whose beneficence we owe the origin of the genuine Dorking
breed? Everybody has at least heard of St. Bride, Fleet Street.
Bride is said to be the diminutive of Bridget; but we are not obliged
to believe this, which is possibly a Popish invention intended to
destroy any idea which Bride might suggest of the saintly life
having been other than one of celibacy. According to the Census
Returns, 8r. Andrew by the Wardrobe has been united with
St. Anne, Blackfriars. This is as it should be. Nay, we further
find that St. John Zachart has been united with St. Anne and
St. Agnes. This is as it should not be—unless St. John Zachary is
to be accepted for a Mormon saint.
There is one saint among the saints of London whose name is a very
extraordinary, if not an unaccountable one. That is St. Bennet
Sherbhog. Sir Walter Scott mentions one of Cromwell's saints,
denominated Grace-be-here Humgudgeon; and one can understand
how a saint might acquire such an "addition" as Grace-be-here:
Est it is not easy to conceive the means by which a holy man could
ave got to be called Sherbhog. Our ancestors, in whose time saints
were made, were little particular about orthography, and the name of
Sherbhog may have been conferred] on St. Bennet by reason of the
rather remarkable act on his part ofperforming the operation of shear-
ing on an inhabitant of the stye. We know that a personage the exact
reverse of a saint is credited, by common rumour with the extreme
absurdity of having shorn a p^, and is also said to have originated the
THE GOOD CRITICAL TIME COMING.
THIS YEAR.
Another happy illustration was last night afforded of the value of
studying the drama of our French neighbours with a view to the
enrichment of our own stage. An adaptation of a sparkling vaude-
ville, produced in June last at the Palais Royal by M.M. Dessobules,
Atchoix, and Boullabaisse, and there entitled Comment Vous Portez-
Vous? was brought out at this agreeable theatre last night under the
cleverly-rendered title of Iloto Are Ton? The plot, which would be
considered simple in England, but which is laid out with so much
artistic skill and stage dexterity as to assume dramatic proportions,
turns upon a visit paid by Mr. Brown, (Mr. Buppins) and Mrs. Brown,
(Mrs. Plumply) to their friend Mr. Jones, (Mr, James Midge) whom
they had supposed to be unwell, to inquire after his health. The
detail is worked out with an elaboration of which an English dramatist
has little idea. The mistake as to the number of Jones's house, the
ringing the servants' bell instead of the visitors', the "not-at-home:,"
until the page discovers the friendship of the parties, the surprised wel-
come accorded by Jones to bis friend and his pretty wife (for whom Jones
seems to have a little gallant regard) the conversation of the day, and
the hope that they shall soon see one another again, are all developed
with the polish and neatness characteristic of high comedy. Need we
say that the acting was worthy of the subject? The good-natured.
John-Bull bluntness of Mr. Buppins contrasted well with the refined
aristocratic bearing, and occasional lisp of Mr. Midge, while feminine
fascination found a fitting representative in Mrs. Plumply, whose
fringed parasol left nothing to be desired. The curtain descended
amid loud applause, which was redoubled when Buppins spoke a smart
tag, expressing his hope that in answer to How Are Ton? he might say,
"All the better for seeing you," for many a night to come—a hope
very likely to be realised.
NEXT YEAR.
Another translation from the French was brought out last night,
managers being unable, we suppose, to find a native writer who can be
trusted with the stage for three-quarters of an hour. The original is
one of those Palais Royal mixtures of vice and flimsiness that find so
much acceptance among half-bred English people. It was called
Comment Vous Portez-Fous t and, as usual, it took three Frenchmen to
write one act. The translator mis-translates a polite inquiry into the
gentish slang of How Are Ton? The whole plot consists in a good-
natured foolish husband, with a flirting wife, calling on a dandy
Treasury clerk to know whether he is ill, as they have not seen him for
some time. The husband calls in good faith, but the wife—the piece
could not otherwise be French—comes to exchange a few coquettish
glances, to give the Lothario a flower, and to have tier fingers pressed
by the scamp. The dialogue is made up of everyday trash, and
certainly the details of a not very respectable morning call are given
accurately enough, and if one went to the theatre to learn how to ring
at a door, how to avoid knocking over the umbrella-stand, and how to
chatter about Ristori, the Surrey Gardens, and the Crystal Palace
fountains, the lesson in life and morals would have been complete, had
it been decently acted. But Mr. Buppins, the husband, is a buffoon,
and was lost in a gentleman's clothes; he seemed always looking round
for a baby or a French clock to sit down upon. Mr. Midge's "swell"
is utterly unlike the real folly, and his affectations were those of a
shopman smartened up for the Sabbath; while Mas. Plumply, though
she spoke the words sensibly, destroyed the intended immorality by the
absurdity of a fat woman of fifty-two (we have her baptismal certificate)
coquetting like a girl. The vulgar and impertinent tag" ought to be
cut out at once. The manager had filled the house with paper, and of
course the cheque made a riot of applause when the curtain fell; but
sueh trash can scarcely be endured many nights by un-hired
adage of " Great cry and little wool" on that memorable
but the Author of Evil appears to have been confounded with St. Ben-
net Sherbhog: unless, indeed, Sherehog, in old English, signifies
mere hog; and then the question will be whether the sainted Bbnnbt
was like many other saints, a regular pig, or whether St. Bennet
Sherehog, also like some, if not many other saints, was a myth, and,
in point of fact, altogether gammon.

A SINGLE POINT OF VIEW.
A Prodigious deal has been said and written for and against marriage
—for and against celibacy—and the question has not jet been solved.
Punch is too careful to lay hands on so thorny a subject; but. this much
he does not mind saying:—that it is always open to the bachelor to
tty marriage as soon as ne has discovered the error of his ways, but it
is not quite so easy for the married man to turn bachelor.

CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION.
(Continued.)
"Mr. Fhoissart Jones begs to forward to Mr.Punch another set of
papers for the use of Candidates for the Civil Service.
"Rhododendron Academy, August 18, 1856."
We all know the story of King Alfred burning the cakes in the
Neatherd's cottage when that Monarch was hiding from the victorious
soldiers of Cromwell, who were scouring the western counties in
search of the Royal Fugitive; but few of us perhaps remember the
noble words of the 3»me Sovereign on hearing of the destruction of the
Spanish Armada, "How is it possible that they, possessed of such
magnificence at home, can envy me a poor cottage in Britain!"
The didactic sayings of the Seven Sages of Greece are often quoted
as containing the very quintessence of wisdom. But few of us could
readdy tell the names of those philosophers without a reference to
Lempriere or Pinnock. They were—Hannibal, Erasmus, Peri-
cles, Chaucer, Melancthon, Sappho, and Vespasian. The last-
named of these worthies wrote a beautiful little lyric, entitled We are
Secen, immortalising the glorious brotherhood to which he belonged.
Wordsworth impudently plagiarised this touching poem, for which
he is held up to undying scorn in those cauterising lines in Gold-
smith's Dunciad, commencing
"There iu a sound of revelry by night"
The Bard of Rydal Mount retorted in a scurrilous lampoon, which,
however, Dr. Johnson persuaded him not to publish. "Sir," said he,
"when a pickpocket is cudgelled for his roguery, he rubs his shoulders,
and holds his tongue. Sir, he is not such a blockhead as to justify his
larceny to the jeering multitude who witnessed his detection.
Richard the Third always steadily refused to pardon the Rye
House Conspirators. In vain did Lord Eldon and Sir John Suck-
ling urge the policy of forgiveness in the then excited state of the
public mind. No," answered the venerable monarch, "1 am ready,
if need be, to go back to Hanover, but I will never violate the oath
which I took at my Coronation."

"As soon as it was kno»n that thfi death-warrant of Stratford
had been signed by the false friend and faithless monarch, a stranger in
London might have supposed that a great victoiy had been gained by
our arms, that a new Armada had been scattered to the winds, or the
chivalry of Frar.ce crushed at another Cressy. But the Tudors and
Plantagenets had ceased to reign, and the glory of foreign conquest
was little prized hy the weak House of Stuart. The City now rejoiced
because the mighty had fallen, and the heathen were delivered into
their hands; because a treacherous king had been compelled to do
justice on one of his godless satraps. The bells rang irom the towers
of the Churches, which the terrified parsons abandoned to the mob;
the train bands paraded the streets from St. Mary's, Woluoth, to the
Mall, at Chelsea; the aldermen in their robes of office called in state
to congratulate the Lord Mayor; and even the guard* at the Tower
threw up their bearskins and huzzaed for the tyrant's downfall. Nor
were the rejoicings coiifined to the Metropolis;' bonfires blazed on the
heights of Snowdon, and were reflected in the unrippled waters of
Windermere. In the murky mines of Cornwall the news which had
been brought down with incredible speed by the Sheriff of the County,
Sir Hugh Trevakion, were read to the swarthy artificers by the
light of Sir Humphry Davy's safety lamp, In Chelmsford, Carlisle,
and Dorchester bands of music paraded the streets plajing the in-
spiring air of 'Cheer, Boys, Cheer' and at Sbepton Mallet the Cor-
poration ordered the shops to be closed, and voted £5 for a bear-baiting
j to celebrate the glorious event. Edinburgh made little demonstration
of feeling, but the wild joy of Dublin burst forth in songs of triumph.
But for the pulse of the whole nation to have beaten thus strongly,
its head must have been sound and its heart true and healthy. The
head and heart of England were then, as they must ever be, at Wobum,
where the self-denying patriots of the House of Russell sternly
rejoiced that the destinies of Britain were about to be confided to that
family, which rejecting the old-world tradition of loyalty to the Crown,
and repudiating all democratic sympathy for the people, is alone fitted
to guide t he nat ion on its path to greatness."—History of England by
a Privy Councillor.

Careless, the little Irish barrister in the Temple would be a greater

we marvel how a soldier and a leader of men could be gulled by so
witless a juggle. Yet do our modern teachers tell us few things which
we may not in like manner read in two ways—the one sweet, the other
bitter; so that whether we come to weal or suffer wo, these oracular
gentry be never in the wrong."—Michel Montaigne (Florio's Translation.)
THE CARDIGAN TESTIMONIAL.
The Earl op Cardigan is to be presented with a sword by his
Yorkshire tenants. Why should there not be a contribution of various
I pieces of armour from various towns? As we have been so often desired
to consider the Earl of Cardigan as the only hero of the War—(he
has himself told the story of the charge, or at least some of it, over a
whole forest of mahogany)—why should he not be put in a complete
suit of mail as the type and embodiment of English valour in the
late struggle? Indeed, why should not Sheffield arm him cap-a-pie,
seeing that Sheffield has already contributed to the hero such admirable
"witiles?"

Discount made Easy.
There is a certain popular song, whereof the title is "Hate Faith
in one Another." The spirit of this ballad appears to have actuated
certain persons who have started a "General Credit Company,"
described as limited. The operation of the law for limiting liability
would, some people have feared, through abuse of the liberty which it
confers, eventuate in a panic. The establishment of a General Credit
Company betokens a spirit of general conlldeDce, which we hope will
be justified.
CONSISTENCY.
Mr. Thomas Baring declined playing a rubber the other evening,
because he said, "Whist was only another version of the Law of
Partnership with limited liability, and he had moral scruples against
joining any Society formed upon such principles."

THE SEA-SIDE SERPENT.

He has arrived!—
It was doubtful on what part of the coast he would this season spread
his fascinations; even as the fisherman spreads his nets.
Even as the spider weaves its web out of his own abdominal region,
so does he weave his gossamer meshes out of his own head.
It was thought he might this season descend upon Margate. It
was wagered that, this year, he would try Scarborough. Many were
tempted to back him for Hastings. A few thought Broadstairs would
be his lair. Three fluttering hearts at Eastbourne fluttered—but in
vain!
No. He has arrived in health, and with the organic remains of all
his spirits on the coast of Trance!
The White, Blue, and Bed, became whiter, bluer, redder as he
tripped up the ladder—(as if it had been Jacob's)—that landed him
from the boat to the port. The white, blue, and red assembled on
that port—the lily skin, the violet veins, the cherry lips were, we say,
whiter, bluer, redder, as his elastic but manly foot musically touched
the Gallic shore, and he gazed a moment around him with that Vent,
Fidi, Fici air, descended from "the hook-nosed fellow of Borne."
Even as the mother fowl chucks to her chicks, and ;opens her wing*
at the sight of the sparrow-hawk, even so did matrons call to Mary,
and Jane, and Angelina; and so did their crinolines seem to expand
as'though to offer refuge to their little ones!
He passed onward; and blessed the boarding-house—thought simple,
unsuspecting fair ones—that shall take him inj.—
Eor there will be the laughter of a light heart; there will be the
promise of the orange-flower. (Hem. With the sea-serpent "under it.")
Many smoking-caps will be embroidered; sundry pairs of slippers
wfll be worked, for love is given to extremes !j
But Beware of the Sea-side Serpent. He can make himself small
enough to glide through the smallest of key-holes; but he boasts—
and in confidence laughs a hollow laugh—that not forty feminine power
shall ever draw him through a wedding-ring.
It is due, however, to the authorities of the town of X to
say, that he is constantly followed by a Humane Society man, who, to
the young and unwary, never fail to point him out as— dangerous."
JUSTICE IN MAEINE STOEE DEALINGS.
We have received a letter, accompanied by a Book of Rules, and a
leaf of an '' Entry Book," from a member of the Marine Store Dealers'
Mutual Improvement Society. It is but fair to call attention to the
following extract from that communication:—
"Our improvement constats in being cautious in our dealings—entering all goods
properly iu a book kept for that purpose; our protection is for the honest trader not to
defend a fence."
We are delighted to hear this, and have additional pleasure in offering
a few suggestions calculated to have the desirable effect of precluding
any fence from getting defended, through mere accident, by the Society
for Mutual Improvement of Marine Store Dealers. The Society does
defend its members, charged with offences in_ their trade, on certain
conditions, whereof the essentials are embodied in the fourteenth rule,
entitled "Rule of Action," which provides—
"That each member, on admission into the Society, shall be provided with a Boole of
Rules, and an Entry Book bearing the Society's stamp, and a printed copy of this
Rule, in which he shall enter, or cause to be entered, all Metals and such other goods,
as are mentioned in the Bomboat Act, purchased at or on his premises. He shall not
purchase metals of children under the age of 14 years, without a thorough knowledge
of the party, or in the instance of old iron mixed with rags or other goods. Any member
infringing on the Pawnbrokers' Act will be expelled the Society."
This rule is so far open to misconstruction, that we cannot exactly
construe it. The substitution of "except in the instance," Ate, for
"or in the instance," &c, we suppose, will remove that difficulty, but
will create a question to be solved. Why is an exception made in the
instance of old iron mixed with rags or other goods? There is a
conceivable case wherein a Marine Store Dealer might buy old iron
innocently and inadvertently, the iron being mixed up with other
goods, and having been stolen. It is that of a few old needles in a
bundle of hay, the needles having been stolen and the hay not; but
why is iron per se sold by a child under 14 years of age. more likely to
be stolen than iron mixed with other goods, particularly rags?
Suppose we let "or" stand, and take the sentence m its grammatical
sense; we must then understand this rule to forbid the purchase of old
iron of children under 14 years of age altogether, and, whether the
juvenile party is thoroughly known or not, provided the metal is mixed
with rags and other goods. We do not see the principle of this proviso:
and we would suggest; firstly, that the Marine Store Dealers'Mutual
Improvement Society should improve this portion of their Book of
Rules, in such a degree as to render it intelligible.
Secondly, since many children are better known than trusted, we
would suggest the propriety of requiring, on the part of the honourable
member of the Societv, some proof of his thorough knowledge of the
juvenile party with whom he may have had any kind of transaction
whatever, without limitation to metals in general, and old iron in
particular, whether alone, or in a state of admixture with rags or
other goods. Probably the Marine Store Dealers have not yet
improved one another so highly as to render every member of their
Society incapable of swearing to a thorough knowledge of any party
if necessary.
We observe that the headings of the "Entry Book" are "Name,"
"Residence/ "Article," "Quantity," "Price," "Amount," and
"Remarks. But we do not observe, amongst the Rules, any regu-
lation rendering extreme lowness of Price a disqualification from
being entitled to legal assistance in the event of getting into trouble
for buying stolen goods. On this head we would, thirdly, suggest a
more definite arrangement.
One of the objects of this Society is " to procure (if practicable) an
Act of Parliament, licensing Marine Store Dealers." We hope this is
practicable. Bigotry may perhaps stand for some time in the way of it
—that bigotry which excludes gentlemen of the names of Levi,
j Isaacs, and Solomons, from Parliament. There is a large proportion
of gentlemen bearing those and similar names among the officers of the
Marine Store Dealers' Mutual Improvement Society. They must get
i into Parliament; and they would also do well to get out of Cl»re
Court, Drury Lane, wherein is their rendezvous—a place of meeting
which might" be advantageously exchanged for the Hanover Square, or
Willis's Rooms.

aware that recorders were mu-
sical, at least in Mr. Milton's

We believe that not a few of the celebrities of the judicial Bench,

proficiency in the theory and practice of common and statute law with
theoretical and practical acquaintance with the laws of music. Even
Judge Jefferies is said to have had some music in his soul; but we
will not believe that. The musical talent ascribed to that scoundrel
was derived from the outrageous remark of a contemporary punster,
who said that Jefferies must be skilled in harmony, because he was a

We bail, with profound satisfaction, the appearance of two of our
venerable judges in the character of organists, and we hope that the
example of Judges Bramwell and Willes will encourage their
learned brethren generally to cultivate the musical faculty. There is
no reason why they should confine themselves to the organ, except the
grave and solemn character of the instrument, which accords' with
judicial gravity and solemnity. But Judges, like other men, require
relaxation; and, accordingly, the predecessors of the present sages of
Westminster Hail were accustomed to dance at certain seasons in the
refectory of the Temple. Why should not this custom be revived?
and then one Judge might learn the violin in order to fiddle to the rest.
Another might study the harp, another the bassoon. Tne, Lord Chief
Justicb of the Queen's Bench might take up the big drum, unless
he felt himself qualified for first fiddle, or preferred the bagpipes. He
of the Common Pleas could, if he pleased, adopt the ophicleide. The
double bass would be suitable to the Chief Baron. The Puisne
Judges might addict themselves to the kettle-drums, or any other
instruments hitter adapted to their tastes and abilities. The cornet-a-
pistons would be suitable to any learned Judge, who might amuse him-
self thereon whenever he had nothing else to do at Chambers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
No. III.—THE MEDIAEVAL COURTS.
Having revelled in the chivalric and antiquarian enthusiasm kindled
by the surrounding memorials cf the ages of romance, and in the delight
occasioned by the very great beauty of many of them, the spectator
may, satiated with the gorgeousness and splendour, advantageously
descend to the enjoyment of some of the lighter peculiarities, of those
ancient and venerable, but, to a certain extent grotesque, objects
contained in the Medieval Courts.
Entering the German Court from the Byzantine, a very remarkable
cavalry officer will arrest his attention in the centre of the place. There
he will behold a bronze equestrian statue, from the Cathedral Square at
Prague, of a knight in armour spearing a Pterodactyle, or flying saurian.
The w arrior is, of course, the celebrated St. George; the reptile the
equally celebrated Dragon. The saint ij knitting his brows in so severe

a manner that his frown, alone, might be imagined sufficient to wither
the sort of alligator sprawling under his horse, as an American sports-
man is related to have been wont to strike down opossums by a mere
grin. There is an angularity and tension about this fine figure of
St. George which is both characteristic of the age (the 14th century)
and conformable to the subject: many Metropolitan visitors wilt
doubtless remark that the saint is "giving it" to his scaly antagonist
"pretty stiff."
On the left of the doorway, opening from the Bvzuitine Court, is a
delightful monument. It is that of Akchdishop Peter von Aspett,
from Mayence Cathedral: a large person apparently, for he is flanked
by three kings, and is about twice or three times as big as any one of
them. He is performing on them a process, whicb, as it includes all
three at once, and as the kings, by the side of the Archbishop, look
like boys, might be mistaken for Confirmation. Coronation, however,
is the ceremony intended: and the apparently simultaneous operation
must be understood as a series of successive acts. The sculpture simply
means than Von Aspbrr did, in the course of his archiepiscooate, crown
three sovereigns; the Emperor Henry the Seventh, King John
of Bohemia, and Louis of Bavaria. It does not intimate that the
Archbishop crowned three several monarch* at different times, and yet
at one and the same moment: although the posture of the prelate may
appear miraculous. He is doing bis office in an ambidexterous rather
than a dexterous manner, using both hands, which, with a wonderful
twist, are applied to the crowns of two figures on the right, and one on
the left. His head rests on a pillow, whilst the kings stand parallel
and at full length with him; so that he anpears to occupy a recumbent
and a perpendicular position at once. His body is painfully bent on
one side, but he looks straight before him with a stare of marvellous
complacency. The features of the kings are somewhat distorted and
pale, or rather sallow: they express a mixture of bodily uneasiness and
spiritual satisfaction. Apparently the Archbishop's touch has expelled
from their systems certain evil influences, whicb, under the form of
hobgoblins, are wriggling beneath their feet. The exorcism seems to
have acted in a slightly antimonial way on the patients, and left them
rather ill, although with a consolatory expectation of being better by-
and-by. In examining the monsters on which they are treading, the
observer will not fail to notice their Majesties' highlows, which are
remarkable for simplicity of make and dimness of blacking.
On the other side of the doorway is a similar monument, representing
another Archbishop of the same Cathedral, Siegfrid von Kpstein,
I crowning two German kings with nearly as much ease and freedom of
I gesture as Peter von Aspett. Siegfrid was the predecessor of
| Peter; he flourished his crozier about 1249. Peter brandished his
i from 1305 to 1320. Siegfjiid's proportions exceed even Peter's.
[ Their superiority of size to the kings is intended to denote that they
were, in point of importance, much greater men; as they probably con-
sidered themselves.
Opposite to our friend Siegfrid's monument, on the other side of
the Court, is that of Ulrich von Gemmingen, another of the Arch-
bishops of Mayence; date 1545. This work betokens a somewhat
increasing tendency in Art to imitate natural attitudes and expressions.
The Archbishop on his knees is a very fair statue of a prelate saying his
prayers, and the two other bishops behind him, and who seem to be
encouraging him, have faces which, though curiously gnarled and
wrinkled, are nevertheless such as are occasionally met with amongst
living fogies. These venerable Churchmen protruda their chins, also,
in a manner whicb, if ludicrous, is not impossible.
Over the entrance to the Nave is a row of figures very cleverly
executed: a set of Pools or Jongleurs, from the Town Hall at Munich.
They are shown as playing their antics before a public assembly; and
they differ from the sculptures just noticed not only in artistic merit,
but also in being designedly comical. There are few living fools in any
Town Hall that come up to these.
Before leaving the German Court, it may be advisable to study the
f culptures of Adam Krafft, from the Frauenkirche, and elsewhere, at
Nuremberg, which amid much that is original, vigorous and expressive,
will here and there agreeably remind us of some other carvings from
the same place, the figures of the inmates of Noah's Ark, wherewith
our childhood was familiar.
Passing now into the English Medieeval Court, we may be said to
find ourselves at home. It is all very well to talk of the enlightenment
of the 19th centurv, but a glance around will convince the most scep-
tical that the 12tb, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries excelled the
present times in illumination. We see that our mediteval beauties
of architecture and statuary were not beauties without paint; as is
perhaps the case still with other beauties of middle age. Kings, in
their royal robes of gold and purple and pink; Knights appareled in
their own real coats of arms, or, azure, gules, diversified with gilt
fleurs-de-lys and rouge lions; noble dames emblazoned like tropical
birds to ma'ch, and ecclesiastics glowing in their canonical colours,
as we behold them reclining in effigy on their tombs, or standing
sentry in their niches, combine to impress us with the idea that nearly
all light had got decomposed in the dark ages, and spread over the
surface of everything in the hues of the rainbow.
The immense size of the spurs of the Black Prince, whose monu-
ment is one of those on the floor of the Court, is worthy of remark; for
it may be observed that his charger could not have teen an enviable

horse. The mailed gloves of the Prince are furnished with brass spikes
in the situation of the knuckles, which would indicate that the boxing-
gloves of our ancestors were made on an exactly opposite principle to

tbat of outs, and that such gloves were probably worn at tbe battle of
Crtpy. It is pleasing to reflect, that we and our brave Allies now
pract ice le boxe in qui'e another spirit and sort of glove*.
The centre door, from Rochester Cathedral, is quoted as a fine
example of the Decorated style, and it shows that our forefathers of the
14'h century had peculiar ideas of decoration. The large hollow
moulding of this door contains some angels, and the inner ditto some
demons, that may be compared with a view to consider whether, but
for the criterion of the wings, it might not be some question which were
which. The angels appear to be either crying or singing, or possibly
doing both. Some eccentric angels may also be seen supporting the
head of John of Eltham, whose magnificent monument is situated at
the other side of tbe Gallery, opposite the Rochester door, under the
Decorated window from Holbeach Church. This office, on an inspec-
tion of the various effigies, will be found very generally assigned to
angels, or cherubs, which, being so much smaller than the bodies tbey
attend upon, suggest the idea of winged Lilliputians taking charge of a
sleeping Gulliver.
The grotesque heads which are interspersed among the more purely
beautiful specimens of mediaeval art, convey a vivid idea of the pro-
priety with which this country was once denominated "Merry England,"
for t hey were stuck about churches, both outside and in, where they
diverted our jolly ancestois wiih every variety of grimace during the
intervals of more serious employment. Some of these corbels were
more terrific than funny j and the taste of the merry English in deco-
rating the arches of their church doors with imps and monsters may be
questioned; but what was this tn our modern practice of deforming the
doors of our own churches wi>b those much more horrible objeots, the
notices relative to the Assessed Taxes and the Income T»x F
The French poi tion of the French and Italian Court includes some
rare old sculptures from Notre Dame, exhibiting venerable persons iu
queer attitudes. Tbe Italian part is sufficiently beautiful; but the
national genius of the Italians did not luxuriate in grinning bishops
and wrynecked saints, griffins, gurgoyles, and goblins, as much as ours
and the German.
Let no admirer of the olden time leave this collection of its relics
without going into the gallery on tbe garden side of the Bjzantine
Court, and taking a look at the black marble font there from Winchester
Cathedral, adorned with sculptures illustrative of incidents in the life
of St. Nicholas of Myra:—a work of art of as early a date, at least,
as tbe 12th century. The most inteiesting of these curious illustrations
is that in which the saint is delineated as bringing a drowned boy to

as to the significance of

the miracle, much as Mr. Punch himself holds his own stick. Indeed
the whole composition is a choice specimen of Punchesque Art. We
may corceive that the saint raited tbe youth from the bed of tbe ocean
by means of his crook, which appears to have been long enough for the
purpose; or else we must suppose that h« performed that wonder by
hook or by crook; of the two, probably, with a hook.
MR. MACAULAY'S PASSPORT.
Mb. Macaulat—upon the authority of the Edinburgh Courant—has
made up his carpet-bag for Venice. Mr. Punch is enabled to give a
copy of the subjoined questions put to the historian by tbe Austrian
Ambassador in London, ere a passport was granted to the distinguished
and no less suspected Englishman.
What is your object of travel F—And in how many volumes P
_ Are you at present engaged on any History—and what is your un-
biassed opinion of the Austrian Concordat?
Will the next child born to the Emperor oe Austria (whom God
preserve) be a boy F if not a boy, what will it be F
Do you know Felice Orbini who, in the most unprincipled manner,
lately sawed through the bars (the property of the Emperor) of St.
Giorgio, Mantua, at the same time dislocating his ancle and breaking
prison f if knowing, state your opinion as a man, a gentleman, an ex-
Member of Parliament, and a historian, of the treasonous conduct in
all its phases of the Felice Ohsini aforesaid F
What is your private opinion of the government of Naples in relation
to the interior of Vesuvius i
Did you ever lend an umbrella to Louis Kossuth F
Have you ever offered a cigar to Mazzini F
Supposing you never did lend an umbrella; presuming that you
never did make tender of a line Havannah to the pernicious individuals
above-named, what would be your conduct if placed in a position to
grant or to refuse, umbrella or cigar, or both F
State the exact height of Louis Blanc in his socks.
The reader will not be surprised to learn that Mr. Macaulat met
every question with bis usual readiness ot illust ratiou, and subtiliU of
logic: but the reader may be surprised to know that even Mr.
Macaulat so completely satisfied the Anxious doubts of the Austrian
Ambassador that, after the wires to Vienna were put two or three
times in motion, the passport was, in the handsomest manner, conveyed
to our distinguished couutrjman.

The Submarine and B'itish Telegraph the other day announced that
"Anarchy reigns throughout China."
Anarchy reigning is something like stagnation stirring, cold burning, or
heat fre'zing. Tbe Submarine and British Telegraph mvt have become

"SAVE US FKOM OUE FBIENDS."
At a meeting duly summoned, on the close of the Greenwich season,
The Thames-fish who had escaped Mi. Quartermainjs's visitors'
weasons.
Took into cons ideration a paper, unsigned and undated,
Addressed to " Admirers of Whitebait,".and extensively circulated;
In whicn the said admirers are exhorted, by petition,
And every other mode of legitimate opposition,
To exert themselves to put down the scheme for turning London's
sewage
Into the Thames at Plumstead; for that this high-spiced brewage,
It is said, will poisoa the Whitebait, and so destroy the supply,
Of that peculiarly delicate and hignly popular fry.
The father of all Thames flounders in the chair—Resolved; (a» per
minute-book.)
1st. The Thames-fish, regard the said paper as nothing bat a fluke,
Dictated by the interests of Qoartermaine and Co.,
And not by those of'the innocent fish, to whom their
Mr. Jabez Swallowcamel, a distinguished member of the Con-
vertible Alliance, has very nearly ended his enthusiastic career.
Fearlessly approaching the precincts of the harem, he w*s found upon
his bards and knees, inserting a copy of The Dairyman's Daughter
under the door. The motives (if the worthy gentleman were beyond
all pra:se; but these would not have saved him from icutr-d scimt'ars,
had he not been gifted with a voice that brought all the hotel to his
assistance. The heir-apparent, in bis first wrath, asked for Swallo-
camel's head; but in a cooler moment, handsomely waived his claim
to the property.
Her Majesty, with the fullest belief in the justice of her claimsi has
already determined that tl.e six East Indian l)irectors to be given into
her hands, shall be impaled in Leadenhall Street. On this point we
regret to say her Majesty, although of the most amiable disposition, is
intxorable.
We have just heard that Me, Frjdbrick Webster has been ap-
pointed Shakspeariau tutor and grammar-muster in ordinary to the
young Prince.
2nd. That the Thames-fish do all in their power to
information;
To the ichthyophdgic portion of the enlightened British nation,
That of all foul feeders known the foulest are ceitainly fish,;
And that, viewed dieteticalJy, there can't be a nastier dish.
3rd. That the sewage, so far from killing the fish, will certainly make
thtm fatter.
So that sewage-fed Whitebait will fry in their grease without the aid of
batter.
4th. That in the interest of their own stomachs, and to turn those of
their devourers,
The Thames-fish usb all their influence with the Metropolitan scourers,
To procure the discharge of all the London sewers
At Plumstead, whereby they will prove themselves the real Simon
Pures,
As well as earn the g'atiturle of the piscinine tribes by it,
By engendering a disgust to fish, as an article of diet.
5th. That Mr. Punch be reque-ted to give publicity to this state-
ment,
lu hopes of the practice of eating fish, that it may lead to abatement.
ODDS AND ENDS OF OUDE.
{From our own Moonshee.)
Southampton, August 30.
The Qdeek of Oude has written a letter to Quhek Victoria,
and is in hourly expectation of an invitation to Balmoral. A close
paUnquin has been in the handsomest manner placed at her Oudean
Majesty's disposal by the gallmt manager of the Princess's Theatie,
who was honoured with a salute from the Royal slipuer.
One of the Princesses, accompanied by the usual functionary, this
morning took a bath, cold without. Mr. Mayall, the distinguished
photographic, was in attendance, in the hope of obtaining a sitting,
and narrowly escaped with bia head from the drawn scimitar of some-
thing in blu>- velvet.
Patrick Eneas O'Raiferty. Esq., of Trin. Coll., has arrived, and
is about to tjffer himself to her Majesty as a gentleman singularly gifted
with the faculty of arranging the most chaotic papers, and setting upon
vigorous legs the most prostrate case.
The price of provisions continues to rise in the neighbourhood. No
sooner was it known that the Royal visitors were addicted to poultry,
than the merest chickens became guinea-fowl. Capons rule any
price.
Yesterday, Mr. Martin Farquhar Tdpper had the honour of an
interview with the son of the ex-KiSG op Oude; and presented a copy
of Proverbial Philosophy translated into Hindostanee expressly for the
occasion. The sage-poet was induced by the condescension of the
Prince to read one of the Proverbs adapted for a bath,—"Beautiful is
the crystal flood, but he is not wise, who casteth away even the water
that is dirty, ere he obtaineth the water that is clean." Another
Proverb delicately touched upon the adverse condition of the Royal
fugitives.—" He who openeth an umbrella to the sun, knoweth not how
soon it may rain." The poet was dismissed with the present of a
live goose.
A shameful hoax has been attempted but signally failed. An
individual, professing to he the respected proprietor of the Lyceum
Theatre, waited on Her Majesty's Chamberlain, offering the establish-
ment as a commodious haudsoiue residence at the most moderate rent.
the offer was at once seen through, and the impostor decamped.

OUR OVERCROWDED THOROUGHFARES
What with the Bath-chairs, the ladies' dressr-s, and the childrens'
perambulators, it amounts almost to an impossibility now-a-dajs to
walk on the pavement. The gentlemen are driven into the road, whilst
the ladies monopolise the trottoir. We do not advocate the opposite
process, but we think some arranrtement might be come to by which
the two sexes could share and share alike. Could not Sir Benjamin
Hall, or some one of our metropolitan Magistrates, isane an order
directing that, for the future the ladies should walk on one side of the
Btreet; and the geutlemen on the other. As the ladies are always to
be found on the right side, let 'h«m in this iustanoe also take the right,
and the gentlemen the left side. Some such regulation is sadly needed,
for at present the division of the flagstones is extremely unequal, and
collisions are constantly occurring which cause deadly feuds, and inflict
incalculable damage on the ladies' temper and crinoline.
Tellings.
Tell me what a man drinks, and I '11 tell you wliat the man thinkrt.
Tell me at what hour a man breakfasts, and 1 will tell you whnt his avocation is.
Tell me the books a man reads, and I will tell you what his mind is.
Tell me the female associates of a man, and I will soon tell you his moral worth.
Tell me how long a man's servants stop with him, and I will tell you what kind of
master he is.
Tell a woman a secret, and the chances are it will not be long before it is told to
another, and then to another, until every one knows it.
The Austrian Workhouse.
The alleged flogging of women at Marylebone Workhouse will pro-
bably cause tbat parochial edifice to acquire a ntw name, and we shall
not be surprised if the appellation generally given to it should, in com-
pliment to the memory of a distinguished Au^rian-G r.ernl, be that of
Haynau House.

A VERY NATURAL MISTAKE.
Young Lady (who is in Hat and Coat of the period). "Can I have a Machine now?"
Bathing Woman. "Nor here, SLR!—Gentlemen's Bathing a little further down!"
CAYENNE.
M. Louis Blanc entreats the Times (and the Times, to the con-
fusion of the evil-doers, assents to the entreaty) to print a circum-
stantial account of the sufferings of the Trench political prisoners at
Cayenne. Their miseries are made as palpable as the bars of Austrian
dungeons; as undeniable as the bastinadoes of Neapolitan gaolers.
The bullets sent to the hearts of Bbunetti and his two sons (the
youngest martyr aged 13), and all murdered by Austria to oblige Sis
Holiness, were not more fatal than are the words, words of anguish
screaming from the Island of Despair against the belief of the imperial
mercy, as printed in boldest type in the ever-lying Moniteur. How
can Louis Napoleon preach clemency, moderation to Francis and
Ferdinand? how can he keep his imperial face, and talk of mercy,
justice? How can the schoolmaster point to a text of mercy, his own
fingers incarnate with the blood of victims P And vet we heard of
such merciful doings, done in thankfulness for the birth of the imperial
child! Done, too. in the name of that blessed baby! On their late way
to Biarritz the Emperor and Empress, with the child, made a halt.
One of the people asked to see the poppet. '' My friend," said the
Empress, "1 should be happy to show him to you, but he is asleep."
With all the Moniteur talk of clemency, we fear it has been the same
with Mercy. "My friends in Cayenne, I should be happy to show
her to you, but sue is asleep." When, we ask, may she be expected to
fairly wake up P
AN AWFUL SLIP OF THE PEN.
Gallantrt is a quality by which our fashionable contemporary the
, Morning Post has nitberto been distinguished; but a writer in that
once refined but now barbarous journal has, in praising Madame
Alboni's singing at the Bradford Musical Festival, made use of a word,
relative to that lady, which, we are assured, will occasion many of his
readers to faint. He permits himself to say,
One wonders how any lady of such elephantine proportions can prcserre so easy a
carriage, and trill forth her notes so spontaneously."
The idea of calling the proportions of a lady elephantine! It is pos-
sible to conceive the application of such an epithet to a gross overgrown
Mayor, or a huge burly Alderman; but to connect the idea of a
horrid elephant with a charming songstress is to perpetrate an enormity
which must create an extensive demand for hartshorn, and a general
necessity for burnt feathers. The sum of five shillings ought to be
exacted from the Morning Post for the employment of so dreadful an
expression.
The Best of all the Taxes.
It is not generally known that a new duty has been imposed on Race-
horses; a tax of £3 17*. a-year for each quadruped, to be paid to the
clerk of the course before tte "start." Race-horses wdl now run away
with more money than ever. The Race-horse duty, however, has this
great recommendation, tbat it will fall on none but those who can well
bear it, or at any rate on none but those who choose to incur it, whether
they can bear it or not; so that, in as far as these latter parties are con-
cerned, the tax, though nominally a horse tax, will in reality fall on asses.
THE THIEVES.
Punch regrets to read that the amiable Duchess op Cambbidoe has
been the victim of a robbery. All her plate has been taken. Had it
been the Duke's, one could have been consoled, for we have known his
plate taken many times, during a single dinner, and he has bome it
like a hero, as he is. But the Duchess ought to have been better
protected. It seems, however, the custom with Royal servants to
lose their employers' plate—it was only the other day that the dear
little Princesses were obliged to take their lunch-beer out of porcelain,
their mugs having been all stolen. These losses must be made up in
some way.—Hadn't Lord Palmerston better take the value out of
next year's fund for the relief of literature? We would sooner the
Princesses and the Duchess, who are ladies, had our money, than the
sort of people who get it at present.

WHAT IT MUST COME TO.
WHERE ARE THE POLICE P
In answer to this puzzling question, the difficulties of
which have made the Editor of Notes and Queries lay his
pen down again and again in despair, if we cannot state
where the Police are, we can at all events inform the
reader with the greatest confidence of the precise localities
where the Police are not; and you may be sore that at this
time of the year, when none but. the sparrows and sweeps
are left in town,; that if yon could only ascertain the
houses, or the districts, where the cooks and the maid-
servants are left on board wages, that there the Police most
decidedly are not! The mansion whose area-railings have
not the leg of mutton and the usual trimmings hanging in
hopeful prospect around them, have no charms for them;
and Betbt, when she has to find everything out of her
own pocket, is by no means so fond of offering her chops to
the Police. If we could only procure a list of the establish-
ments that are put, in the absence of their masters and
mistresses on board wages, we might, by knowing where
the Police were sure not to be, be probably furnished with
some small clue as to the charmed spot where those
invisible blue-bottles that haunt our larders a great deal
more than our streets, were likely to be found.
MILITARY DEFINITIONS.
"The non-commissioned officers," says the Daily News,
"are the salt of the Army." Our contemporary might have
added—"and certain generals of division salt-spoons."
GUARDS' DINNER ABSENTEE8.
Vabious significant absences were observed at the dinner to the
Guards, in the Surrey Gardens. Some of these might have been less
sarcastically remarked upon, had the Committee thongbt proper to
read the notes of apology which were transmitted from certain dis-
tinguished quarters. We have been favoured with copies of some of
the documents in question, and print them as mere matter of
justice:—
"Lobs Cardigan presents bis compliments to Mb. Saks, and very
much regrets that a round of public dinners, given to himself by his
dependents, will prevent his dining with the Guards on Monday, and
exhibiting to them the coat and inexpressibles in which he bad the
pleasure of winning the battle of Balaklava. But his Lordship sends
the spurs which he used during his return from that exploit, and not
even one of the envious carpers at his laurels will be able to deny that
those articles have undergone hard service.
"P.S. He wonders that Mb Sahs's good taste will allow him to
keep in his window the picture of such a person as Lord Lucan."
"The Earl op Luc an has received Mr. Bams's circular, and begs
to intimate that he shall not attend the dinner to the Guards. The
practice of making an undue fuss about the private soldier, who, in
doing his best, merely does that which he is hired to do, appears to
Lord Lucas to be highly detrimental to the interests of the service.
Besides, the Earl has no confidence in the Committee, who appear to
be chiefly members of an inferior class of society, and he has no
guarantee that disrespectful toasts, reflecting on those who are sup-
posed to have caused t he unavoidable misfortunes of the late war, may
not be introduced. The Lord Mayor may be a respectable man, but
real Lords ought not to be asked to associate with annuals.
"P.S. He is surprised that Mb. Sams should decorate (?) the corner
of St. James's Street with a likeness of such an individual as Lord
Cardigan."
"Mb. Fllder's compliments to Mb, Sams, and certainly will not
come to the dinner which it is proposed to give to the Guards. He
believes that the affair will end disastrously, as it is most, preposterous
to believe that provision can be made for supplying 2000 men with
meat, drink, and tobacco, for a whole evening, at so short a notice as
one month. He would suggest the postponement of the dinner until
the summer of 1858, by which time the Committee might, if they
availed themselves of Mr. Fildeb's assistance, be able to make the
necessary arrangements. But he must decline being party to any ill-
considered attempt, as the comfort of British soldiers ought not to be
risked in the hands of incompetency."

THE SENTINEL OF THE PYRENEES.
Six words with Monsieur Gabriel Hugelmann.
"And who," asks impatient, ungrateful Europe, is Monsieur
Gabriel Hugelmann P"
Wei), that great man, as described by himself in a bulky Damphlet
just published in Paris—price 2 francs 50 centimes—is the Voluntary
Sentinel of Civilisation and of the Napoleonic Idea, who, straddling
across the Pyrenees, and regardless of menace and insult, bawls, wilh
alternate warning, "France and Spain! Spain and Erance! The
Enemy, the Enemy!"
And it is very kind of him, and the news is quite'cheap at two francs
and a half.
Perhaps, you irreverent reader, you were going to say that you
would hand over the other half franc to be told who or what this
Enemy is. Peace wilh your premature ribaldry; he throws jou that
information into the original bargain.
The Enemy is—but stop! Let the Voluntary Sentinel accredit
himself to you.
Lately, as you may be aware, there has been performed in Spain
something which, despite the protests of the Imperial organs in France,
the obstinate Briton persists in calling a Coody Tar. In other words,
a Queen and a Soldier have crushed Spanish liberty, slaughtered
Spanish citizens, dispersed the Parliament, gagged the press, and pro-
claimed that Order reigns. On the right or the wrong of all this we
have not now to speak. II s'agit de M. Hugelmann, not of the coup
d'etat.
In fact, however, one may prelude that there could be nothing wrong
in this last move of the innocent Isabella and the innocent O'Donnell.
For the Coody Tar has not only received unqualified approbation from
the Tuilerie?, but French influence and French gold had largely
aided in bringing it about, and Spanish journals, either written or
inspired in Paris, defend and applaud it. One of these is the Journal
de Madrid, which is published in the French language, is main-
tained partly by the Imperial government, and partly by a French
company, and
Is edited by M. Gabriel Hugelmann.
So the Voluntary Sentinel of Civilisation has his antecedents—and
his salary. And there is no disgrace.in being paid to advocate a just
cause.
Therefore, knowing who the Sentinel is, let us hear something about
the Enemy.
M. Hugelmann's pamphlet (reduced from that verbiage which it
pleases the continental mind to accept in lieu of thought) announces
divers discoveries.
Firstly. The great evil which has wrought all the mischief in Europe
for many ages, is the Protestant Idea, carried out by Martin Luther
and Henry the Eighth, in antagonism] to Catholic Unity. Let us
quote him, L'ide'e de revolte centre V unite Catholique—c'est elle qui a
cause tous les malheurs.
Secondly. The English, who pretended to defend the Peninsula,
were rich in the possession of Gibraltar, and Bignalised their liberating
progress by moie ravages than the Fiench conquerors had ever com-
mitted.
Thirdly. The Napoleonic djnasty in Spain, so far from being a
usurpation, proved itself a generous protectress, " malgre," says the
naif Sentinel, "les grossieres erreurs de Chisioire a ce svjet."
The Voluntary Sentinel has made some minor discoveries, but they
are chitfly of a sentimental nature, and perhaps designed to colour and
spangle the stern logic of bis grand theme. In a political pamphlet, an
English writer might scarcely assist his defence of the state conduct of
a Queen by a sketch of her person, in the style of the opening of a novel.
The innocent Isabella may have a laille imposante, may have a lip per-
petually smiling, and may easily be recognised, even amid the brilliant
crowd of a ball. The evil Esparteeo may be d'assei petit iail/e, and
brun de visage, may not lock at you when he speaks, and may have la
moustache fine. The victorious O'Donnell may have a haute laille, a
belle tenue, and a look full of audacity. But, except in a French political
essay upon the destinies of a great nation, it is not easy to discover the
constitutional or dynastic bearing of these important facts. Miss
Agnis Strickland, who can see nothing but wickedness in our He-
volution, because Kin g William was an insignificant looking little man
with an asthma, may appreciate the reasoning of the Sentinel of Civili-
sation better than ourselves.
But now you begin to get a glimpse of the Enemy, perceived by the
loud-voic»d Hugelmann, as he bestrides the Pyrenees.
Catholic Unity and the Napoleonic Idea are to do for Spain what the
exalted personage whom he incessantly calls Le Sauveurde France has
done for that fortuna'e coun'ry. The writer leaves ui in no doubt of
his meaning. One of Queen Isabella's grand merits is her knowing,
"iin common with every enlightened man in Spain, that Religious
Freedom in her kingdom would be the signal for great misfortunes."
On the other hand, the Napoleonic Idea grandly carried out. by
Marshal O'Donnell is, though misunderstood—la mission redemp-
trice—a Mission of Redemption.
Toe Priests and the Sword. That is the future for Spain.
One knows pretty well, now, in whom and in what our Sentinel of
Civilisation is likely to discern an enemy. He has, however, spoken
out. The English and the Belgian journals are the objects of his
supreme detestation, and he is specially severe upon the Times, and the
Indipendance Beige; papers which our Editor, rich in his knowledge of
the morals of continental journalism, describes as led into error by
correspondents salaried by another caisse than that of the newspapers
employing them. "France and Spain! Spain and France! The
Enemy!" So blows the trumpet of Gabriel.
Protestantism, England, Religious Freedom, a free press, these are
the enemies against whom the Sentinel of Civilisation is to keep watch
and ward.
And Monsieur Gabriel Hugelmann is the salaried interpreter of
Napoleonic ideas.
Oa the whole, and with all Mr. Punch's almost idolatrous admiration
of the Priests and the Sword, he cannot entirely give himself up to
regret that Cardinal Wiseman is not yet Archbishop of Canterbury,
tbat the Bible Society flings its annual millions of missiles at the
Scarlet Lady's head, that Magna Charts may be seen three days a-
week in Great Russell Street, that the Times is on our table at nine
each morniDg, (except when the newsboy's love for marbles quenches
his sense of duty) and finally, that M. Hugelmann's salary is paid in
francs, and not in sovereigns.
Bawl away, Gabriel, and earn your hire, like an honest tool.
Punch promises you that there shall always be an enemy in sight, so
there is no fear of your being thrown out of wotk.
DOINGS ON THE MOORS.
A Distinguished Prussian party, including His Royal Highness
Prince Adalbert, and the officers of the Prussian frigate Dantzig,
commenced operations upon the Moor?, a few days ago, in the Medi-
terranean, but with no great success. They put up some black game,
which they were unable to bag, and in the course of the day the Prince
himself unluckily got winged by the discbarge of a gun, which com-
pelled him to abandon the sport. These Moors are very wild, and
have but recently been shot over; but a battue is in contemplation, in
which several English guns will, it is said, bear a part, and we trust
that a good account will be given of the rum birds which infest that
part, and are very injurious to the pecuniary interests of the vicinity.
Marine Armour.
A Wag at a watering place, half stupified by the roar of the waves,
suggested the other day, that, for the new mail packets to the Cape of
Good Hope and India, the fittest vessels would be iron steamers.

REVIEW OF THE FASHIONS
(By our Dramatic Critic.)
HE Fashions for Sept-
ember have been re-
ceived, and we can
speak in the highest
terms of what they
contain. They are
full to overflowing of
material. In fact,
there is too much in
them. The thing is
depreciably overdone.
There is a great deal
more than the most
devoted worshippers
of the sex would wish
for his money. What
is now used for one
woman would less
than three years ago
have covered three
women. The stuff
itself*is moat admir-
able, but we object to
the wearisome extent
to which it is carried.
It drags its slow
length along in such
a tedioas inflated man-
ner, that we do not
wonder at the action
becoming vulgarised
and impeded by it.
The truth is, the whole thing wants cutting. Cut a dress in its present overgrown amplitude
of five acts into two, and give men but a fair wholesome proportion of what is at present
given, and we are confident they would be jast as well, if not much better pleased by the
exchange. The work is foil of points and good bits, and as far as that goes hangs well
together, but would gain considerably in effect if kept much closer. We recommend to all
milliners, who have had a thimble in its production, "the judicious use of the pruning-knife."
Out of every four lengths they could easily cut out two, and the same excision might be
applied with equal benefit to the breadths.
PITY FOR OUR SISTERS OF OUDE.

J [ow much I pity Oude's ex-Queen,
Poor thing—to be compelled to lead
A life, as one may say, unseen!
It must be terrible indeed.
i low wearily her days must pass,

THE NEW CONSERVATIVE POLICY.
An opinion, for which there is some apparent reason, has been gaining ground, that the
Conservative party has fallen into a state of disorganisation. Tne truth is, that the Con-
servative body, like the human frame, is apt to get occasionally out of order, nay, seemingly
to undergo a break-up of constitution and tumble to pieces; but then, some clever political
practitioner is called in, aid he puts it together again. There it is that the Conservative
party has the advantage of Husipty Dumpty.
Every now and then the Conservative party has to bs reorganised. The Sun of England
very often sets, and as frequently rises again. So it is with the Conservative party. Our
British Phoebus set when the Papists were emancipated. British Phoebus, however, rose
again as "well as ever the next morning. The enactment of the Reform Bill was the epoch of
another British sunset, succeeded by sunrise as usual, till the corn laws were repealed, and
then the Sun of England, we were told, had Bet at last for good and all, and no mistake;
but it was a mistake; for the Sun of England is now on the point of setting once more, and
therefore must have risen subsequently to the downfall of Protection.
As the Sun of England is under the necessity of rising again punctually as usual, arrange-
ments have been made for the accommodation of the parties, or rather of the party, desirous
of beholding the resurrection of that luminary. In plain terms, a new set of Conservative
object', and cries, and watch-word*, has been devised, under the sanction, if we are not
mis'aken, of the Earl or Derby and Ma. Disraeli.
The great want of the Conservative party is a rallying cry. What have they lo conserve?
is the question in almost every mouth. Temple Bar. That is answer enough for the present.
They want to conserve Temple Bar—they also want to maintain the conservancy of the
Thames. If they can manage to conseive the sewage of the Thame?, and utilise it, they will
do something.
The conservation of St. John's Gate, Clerkenwell, will be another object of the re-organised
Conservative party. It will also be their endeavour to conserve S". James's Palace in its
present state; likewise Aldgate Pump :—to conserve the Duks of Yohk's column, and the
Nelson ditto, the sta'ues ot George the Third and Fourth, of Gog and Magog, and the
Duke at Wellington, together with those of the wonderful charity children in the costume
of the eighteenth century, which adorn the exterior of the parochial school at Kensington.
No, no, the great Conservative party is not yet extinct!
When into her close carriage put,
If ever for a ride she goes,
She's swathed and bonndfrom head to foot,
Like some old mammy in its clothes.
Knowing that crowds of people wait,
Eager to catch a glance of me,
At such times, oh, how I should hate
All muffled up like her to be!
ind then her Maids of Honour, too,
Their hapless lot is just the same,
Concealed from everybody's view:
I say it is a cruel shame-
A pretty face obliged to hide,
A girl must feel the keenest pain,
The prettiest dress, to sight denied,
Would deck one's form almost in vain..
What are their gems and jewels bright,
Set in the purest virgin-gold,
That flash with unavailing light,
Which there is no one to behold?
Life has for them no charms at all,
All day and night in gloom they pine,
Tbey never dazzle at the ball,
They never at the concert shine.
They never taste the joy so dear,
The brilliant Opera-box to grace,
And feel that glasses, far and near,
Are being levelled at one's face.
When in the lovely waltz I whirl,
With dress and beauty well displayed,
I'm thankful I'm an English girl,
And not a luckless Oudian maid.
The Art op Talking.—There are persons 'who talk for the sake of talking; there are
others who talk in order to talk well: but your fool talks to make others talk about him.
HAVE THE TORIES A POLICY P
The Conservative journals keep up a perpetual
squabbling among themselves upon the question,
whether their party has or has rot a policy?
The rabid Protestants revile Lord Derby and
Mr. Disraeli as traitors to religion and the
constitution, and the modera'e Tories scoff at
the fanatici as inipracticab'e asses, who would
risk a rebellion for the sake of an anti-Popery
cant-cry. It is not for Punch to settle the pro-
portions in which each faction may have truth on
its side, but he wonders that the opposition does
not see that the best excuse for its non-existence
as a power lies in the fact that there is no
Government. If th^re is nothing to oppose, there
can be no oppotition. In the mean time, and
until we have a Government, the only p licy for
the Conservatives is Mr. Disraeli's—the policy
of Assurance.
Another Cruel Hoax.
This has been the season for honxipg: hut the
spirit of mockery was carried a little too f ir when,
at the Surrey Gardens Dinner, one bottle of
Champagne was allowed to three Guard^m^n.—
Toast and water is poor t ipple; but. when H arkeb
called upon the soldiers to charge their glasses,
it was literally toast and nothiug.

We have to deplore the loss of Gilbert Abbott A Beckett, whose genius has for more than
fifteen years been present in these pages; present from the first sheet, July 17th, 1841, until
August 30th, 1856. On that day passed from among us a genial, manly spirit; singularly gifted
with the subtlest powers of wit and humour; faculties ever exercised by their possessor to the
healthiest and most innocent purpose.
As a Magistrate, Gilbert a Beckett, by his wise, calm, humane administration of the law,
gave a daily rebuke to a too ready belief that the faithful exercise of the highest and gravest social
duties is incompatible with the sportiveness of literary genius. On the Bench, his firmness, mode-
ration, and gentleness won him public respect, as they endeared him to all within their influence.
"His place knows him not," but bis memory is tenderly cherished.
THE RIVER OF GOTHAM.
(How Old Gotham dealt with it, ahd Young Gotham proposed
to deal with it.)
Dedicated to the Members of the Reformatory Union.
In the wise land of Gotham a river there ran,
From its source on a bare mountain-side:
Bat h rillet it was when its course it began,
And it made its own bed, unassisted by man,
As deep as it chose, and as wide.
Other streams clubbed with this: many waters in one,
From the rocks and the hollows around,
Swelling, still, as it flowed, the young river dashed on,
Spreading, now, into marsh, chafed to torrent, anon,
But still cursing, not blessing, the ground.
While this sort of game in the mountain it played,
Gotham's wise men contentedly sat:
It was nothing to them what wild havoc it made,
How it wasted its waters, how spread, or how strayed;
They'd things graver to think of, than that.
But in time from the mountain it spread to the slopes,
Where man over nature holds sway.
Hedge or wall, all in vain with the wild water copes;
Some hill-Gothamite, daily, lamented his hopes
Of harvest or math swept away.
For the boulders and rubbish and gravel it rolled
From its hill-bed, at morn were spread there,
Where last even the sheep lay secure in the fold,
Where the oats in the sunshine waved yellowing gold,
All was ghastly and barren and bare.
So downwards it went: swoln or shrunk, in and out,
Swamping fields, sweeping crops to the sea,
Leaving wide strong stretches of ruin about,
Till certain sage Gothamites ventured to doubt
If this sort of thing ought to be.
For the fields, they observed, are not far from the town,
And the river that ruins our crops,
A breach in our walls may some day batter down,
Walk into the streets, and its ravages crown,
By invading our houses and shops.
"Something ought to be done," the Town Council declared:
And the question was, "What should be done?"
First, a nice, new, straight bed for the stream they prepared:
But the next autumn rains, how all Gotham despaired
When the stream left their bed for its own!
They flung out all manner of carcass and groin,
To give the mad river a twist;
But in vain they sank labour and timber and coin:
In one rush the wild stream all its forces would join—
And what carcass or groin could resist P
They tried dams; they tried weirs; they tried floodgates and drains
(Gotham's tax-payers settled the bill.)
Cogs, levers, and counterweight?, pullies and chains,
Mechanical triumphs of hand and of brains;
But the stream, laughed to scorn all their skill.
Till some one then hint to the Town Council threw,
(Not a native of Gotham, of course;
Most in Gotham this notion were quick to pooh-pooh,)
"Since you can't tame the stream when it's got down to you,
Why not deal with it np at its source?"
Loud and long were the scoffs and contemptuous the sneers,
On this wild proposition, bestowed;
"We've worked on the stream at our doors all these years,
As our fathers before us, and Gotham adheres
To the old paths its ancestors trode!"
But the stranger persisted, unshaken and cool,
And at length a Young Gotham appeared,
Which profanely dares doubt if the famous old school
Has exhausted all wisdom, and laid down the rule
By which all after-times must be steered.
By the last news from Gotham we now understand,
That Young Gotham has gone np the hill,
To the source of the stream that has ravaged the land,
With the new-fangled notion of turning their hand
From the river to deal with the rill.
THE MONEYED ORDER OF ORDERS.
A Curate, relating a case of "Clerical Distress" to the Editor of
the Timet, says, 4
"I hare received a letter from the Bishop of the diocese respecting the ease of the
Essex curate. • • *
"The Bishop adds, 'I shall be gtad of any pecuniary assistance he may receive. '"
We don't, in this particular instance, understand the Bishop to
desire that any pecuniary assistance received by the Essex Curate may
be handed over to himself; but perhaps there are some, of course very
few, Bishops, who would be glad of any money that anybody would
send them.

from Bolonia in Italy, where he was grown.
That its ligh' houses long burned the best Roman candles,
Till the Franks snuffed 'em out; that .the Huns came, and Vandals,
And lastly the Norn an?, with pickaxe and spade,
And effaced all the marks that the Romans bad made:
That Henrt the Eighth, in Fifteen-forty-four,
Besieged it, arid finally took it, that's more:
That we kept it six years, and we then behaved handsome
Tn g virg it up for a tidyish ransom:
That Nafolion, some fifty years since, b; ought together
On its heights a magnificent army, whicb weather,
Or prudence, or something, forbad to cross over,
And match upon Georgius the Third, via Dover:
That Napoleon the Present, ex route for the throne,
Landed here—but enough of the past of Boploce.
For insttuclion of persons »ho don't like a joke's tone,
(Prepare for the rhyme) the best route is by Folkstone.

For a moderate remittance of francs, by the quarter.
And as for the much-vexing question of creed,
The arrangements are found veiy liberal indeed.

Her doves off to mass, with their meda's and missals,
Her lord is a Protest ant—ptompl to invite

And one usher is "up" in the presbyter's inle,
Lest a small Presbyterian be serjt to the school—
Kay, supposing a parent's conv;ction should go
Along with the creed of Mohammed, or Fo,

A teacher with turban, or fail, on the spot.
Meantime the eleves are well wa'ched, and well fed,
Well whipped ar.d well physicked, well taught, and well bred,
And they live in sweet air, and in 'act it's well known,
That the child is well placed who ia placed at Boolone.
But the priests have wtxed wroth, and they caurot abide
That their "faithful" should learn by the heretic's side;
That a Papist should wickedly stand up in claes

Has exploded with fatal effect in Bjolone,
"Where, (if truth, which such. Bishops dislike, must come out),
The folks are not thought to be much too devout.
On the heights or the ramoarts if Catholics walk,
They are just within smff cf our heretic cba'k,
And maybe tbe free-thinking flavour they meet,
Makes them turn up the nose at the priests' eau benite.
And we '11 just tell yo i what—if the Man of December,
(A title Mazzini's resolved to remember)
Were to offer a new Sr. Barth ilomew's day
To these heterodox Papists, the bold Boulonnois,
And cry Ttiez! (as Charles the Ninth did to bis cousin)
We fcarcely believe that they'd kill half-a-dozen.
Tne blanchisseusses, perhaps, of a few might dispose
la revenge for abuse for not bringing home cloth s,
And the beggars might make a few Englishmen rue
Tbe curses they gave 'em instead of a sou;
Bat the brave Boulognese in their memories set down
Th; millions of francs we expend in their town,
And would let tbe poor English go safely at large,
Fiing the bayonet asidj, and, for once, make no charge.
The Pastoral brings out their impudence, plump,
And the Bishop's abused for a Bigot, and Pump,
And scoffing goes on that makes Protestants stare
Oa the Port, in the cafe, and even ia the fair.
He '* a Beast, and a Swine, and a Man without Head,
An Old Fatal Ass—ani by some fo'ks 'tis said
That he issues his threat, to drive pupils away
To a convent in Calais, that keeps him in pay,
And his Crozier resembles the Hook, say the pert,
With which the Chiffonnier routs sous from the dirt,
And in short, (there's no reason for drawing it mild)
The Bishop's despised, and the Church is reviled.
The result's to be seen, but the wielders of birch
Declare they've nine mind* to defy the old Church,
And they mean to appeal from the piests to the Th\one
To avert the disasters that threaten Boolone.
An English invasion once happened, we saw
But the terror is now lest the English withdraw.
John Bull will not yield; he don't like in the least
The low-looking, leering, 8ly, fat-fingered priest,
With no price that obtains a pure accent John quarrel-?,
Provided his children don't lose their pure moral*,
But he wou't trust the pupils (you know the old story)
Of beastly P. Dens, and of vile Liguori:
And bis joung ones shall stick to their Protestant ways
Or come back to England, tbe old fellow says.
So the schools are all wi'd, and profane is the tone
In which Bishops are talked of in wicked Boolone,
And a dozen of tawdry processions won't master all
The bad spirit raised by the humbugging Pastoral.
For schoolmasters take you in corners, and swear
Tticy '11 make a new class-book, of scraps from Voltaihe,
And their wives say, quite sweetly, though hissing with rage,
"Tbe Church is, helas! in tbe rear of the Age."
While thoie who possess neither children nor school',
Saiih to tee bigot Bishops make blunders, Ike Fools.

IMPORTANT TO LADS AND LADIES.
Coriotjs question is
raised by the adver-
tisement whereof a
portion is here sub-
joined :—
"Bkabd GsirBRATnra
Extbact.—If applied once
a diy, by rubbing the
places where whiskers or
beard are wished for, with
at much as tbe size of two
peat, a luxuriant growth
of hair will be brought
forth withia six months."
Suppose a man is
bald on the crown,
and rubs that part of
his head with the
Beard Generating
Extract. Do the pro-
prietors of that won-
derful substance
mean to say that it
will cause whiskers
or a beard to sprout
on the top of his
upper storey?
The above positive aid sweeping statement as to the virtues of the Beard
Generating Extract, suggests another problem of some interest. The hat,
pilot-coat, and ankUjaeks now generally adopted by young ladies, occasion them
to look extremely gentlemanlike. Could a young lady, if shj pleased, complete
her resemblance to her brothers by recourse to the Beard Genirating Extract?

Travelling Experiences.
Avoid all tabh d'ho/es where the military congregate, fo" as your officers on the
Continent pay lesi than anybody else, you will have the satisfaction of knowing (and
feeling also on an empty stomach) that part of your dinner has been tak-nto makeup
for their deficiency. Oae half of what you pay goes to feed the Officers. They have
no mess of their own, and why sh mid they, when the poor fellows can get themselves
quartered at a moiety of the < xpense on. Messrs. let Voyageurt t They a'e billeted
on the landlord, and the landlord billets them on hii guests. Thus, in a great
measure, the better part, of the German army is fed by French and Eog'Uti travellers.
It is victualled by table d'hote extortions.
FRIGHTFUL FEROCITY IN A MARRIED
MAN.
"A lady, who had beon in a bathing machine at Sonthend, left behind
a gold watch worth £25, ami a massive gold chain, neither of which has
been recovered."
A Savage, yet manied man, reading the above in a
weekly paper, made a series of rematks, which may be
worth preserving as proofs of the ferocity of male nature :—
"Of course she did. A wor.an would leave her head
behind her, if s he had oie, and it was loose.
"Besides, what do they care for valuable property?
They don't pay f ir it—it is we who are the victims.
"Recovered! I should think not. It, waa left in a
woman's maohine, and a woman followed ber. They have
no more common honesty, Sir, than I '11 bet you a
guinea the finder found that Southend dida't suit her
health, or dreamed that her house in town was on fire, or
that the cat bad smothered the darling child there, and so
she left Southend next day, and has never looked at thj
Times' advertisement sheet since.
"Perhaps it's all a'falsehood of the woman's, and she
had boI t tbe wa'ch and chain to pay some milliner's bill,
which she was afra'd to show her husband. Won't she
plague his soul out till she gets new ones F
"And serve the blockhead right. A man who would let
any woman have a wa*ch worth £25 deserves to be served
out. What does a woman want with a watch like that, or
any watch, indeed. They only desire to look fi le, and a
silver gilt thing at £5 will do that. A. chronometer at a
hundred guineas wouldn't make 'em punctual.
"I believe the whole story's a flam. Women look a
deuced deal to) sharp a'tcr their trumpery ornaments,
which a'e the breath of life to 'em. If it had been her
husband's most valuable private paoers, or his gold watch
and chain, I could have understood it.
"Women dressed in that style wont go to Southend,
where there b only health and fresh air—they drag yon to
Pa is, or Antwerp, or Venice, that they may s'are, and show
their cjothes, and be cheated aid ch*at you, and"

perly teas turned oat of the room.

THE WINGED BULL.
Bull, three-fourths of each year the sedatest of mortals,
Desk-chained, as the slave to his oar at the galleys is,
With Autumn, grows like those Winged Bulls at the portals
Of Koujunjik's or Nimroud's mysterious palaces.
From his two breeches-pockets shoot wide-spreading pinions,
Composed of bank-paper or circular notes,
With which he soars forth from the British Dominion',
And through land and o'er ocean, ubiquitous floats!
M.F.'s, men of business, of science, of pleasure,
From the desk or the study, the club or the House,
Seek the ocean for dipping, or yachting, or leisure.
Thrash the stream for the fisb, tramp the moor for the grouse.
But our own British Isles, their lakes, seasides, and mountains,
Are too narrow our Autumn Winged Bull to confine,
His thirst must be slaked at more outlandish fountains,
So up with the steam and away o'er the brine!
He is climbing Mont Blanc with a family party,
Letting off soda-water in Afric Sabar,
Boiling eggs in a Geyser, with Pbince Bonafabte,
Or helping at Mojoow to crown the new Czar._
Stones of Venice he's chipping, in spite of mosquitoes,
Braving fierce Spanish bed-fellows, black and phlebotomous—
From a Mexican learning to roll cigarretos,
Or on the White Nile bringing down hippopotamus.
But wherever he goes in his Autumn migration,
He gives his old slough, like a snake, the go-by;
Though at home 'tis his aim to avoid observation,
Abroad he delights to come out as a Guy;
Fierce bristles the beard, which each morning saw shaven,
As smooth as the turf of his lawn or his fields.
Wild in checks flares the coat, once the hue of the raven,
And the chimney-pot tile to the wide-awake yields.
The Times cries out on him and bids him be truer,
To the Briton's ideal of quiet costume:
But there's much in the instinct that bids him abjure,
With his every-day cares, outward livery of gloom.
Were wealth and distinction less prized and less warred for,
Were life made more lovely and leisure less spare,
Bull might find rest at home that he now flies abroad for,
And dock buckram and black in his everyday wear.
GREAT PEDESTBIAN FEAT.
(From our Sporting Correspondent.)
Paddy Hoofs, the celebrated pedestrian, but better known at
Lords', and the various Commons in the neighbourhood of London,
as the 'Am mersmith Antelope," is still carrying on his Herculean
feat of walking round a lady in full dress 100 times in 100 consecutive
days. He is now in his second week, and looks as fresh as when he
first started. There are bets to a considerable amount that Paddy will
never be able to complete his arduous undertaking. What makes it all
the more difficult is the fact, that a fresh lady is substituted every day.
it has been observed that the dresses of these various ladies, instead of
decreasing, are actually getting bigger and bigger almost every week.
What the size, therefore, will be before the 90th, much less the 100th,
day is completed, the most elastic imagination snaps, like an over-
stretched piece of india-rubber, in its vain efforts to comprehend. It
is also feared that there will be no open space large enough in the
vicinity of the Metropolis to admit of the experiment, as soon as it has
expanded to its fullest dimensions, being fairly tried. In the mean-
time, however, Paddy displays uncommon pluck. His unfailing good
humour, and cheerfulness under his trying labours, such as would exhaust
the oldest and worst-paid postman of St. Martin s-le-Grand, win smiles
of approval even from bis fairest ramparts. We wish the brave fellow
every success, and shall from week to week make a point, or several
points rather, of recording the onward march of his iron-tipped bluchers
and undaunted perseverance.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE OUDE MAID OF HONOUR-
E hate humbug, and may as well,
therefore, say at once that Punch
has been corrupted by the Queen
op Oude, and that his pen is at
her Majesty's service.
Aid the way in which the affair
was managed wts in this wise.
Mr. Punch was in his office, on
Saturday !ait (the imn ortal num-
ber now in your band being retdy
for the press, aid safely locked
in the diamond studded bos in
which it is carried, guarded by
seven sworn henchmen, from his
bands to the printer's), and he
was penning a note to Loud
Gbanville, desiring him not to
be too smirky when noticed by
Alexandeb;
When a vassal entered the pre-
sence, and after the usual prostra-
tion!!, obtained leave to speak.
Speaking, he stated that there
was an Elephant at the door
below.
"An Elephant for VsV said
Mr. Punch, mildly. "That makes
the thirty-s'xth present of game this week. Our friends grow troublesome."
"Alive," humbly suggested the inferior. "With a young lady upon him."
"Pretty little Emily Cooke, on her Papa's last new purchase for the Circus; the three
hundred and twenty guinea animal, formerly a favourite at the 8urrey Gardens," remarked
Mr. Punch, who knows everything. "Miss Emily has come to show Us the article. Ask her
to bring him up."
"The staircase"—timidly whispered the faithful vassal.
"Will bear U«," taid Mr. Punch, with a good-natured smile. "Draw your deduction, and
withdraw with the message."
In a few moments a Veiled lady, or rather Lady—as Me. Chorley would write in the
Atheiueum—vias introduced.
"How do you do, Miss Cooke, but where's the Elephant," said Mr. Punch, graciously
extending his hand.
"Luck.no >v bung sheenisb, malacikan how plop eelaniskobad rung chowloprassi bog getsch,"
was the answer, given in a sweet low Oriental accent, which instantly told Mr. Punch,
(master of all language;), that a lady of rank, from India, was before him.
To reply "Adameeng lang pagong wilkanusta li geganty bin bo potuble, jinganeilo," to fling
a sumptuous cushion upon the floor, to place his visitor upon it, and to sit down opposite
to her, in the most courteous of attitudes, was the work of a moment.
A conversation then ensued, which Mr. Punch will translate; but any one desirous of reading
the original may call in Fleet Street, and wait until it is brought to him.
"The King of Literature sees before him Lalla Rookh Pooty Beeb, Maid of Honour
Extraordinary to the Queen or Oude."
"The slanting sunlight of the dawn is. not more' welcome to the awakenirg flowers," said
Mr. Punch, who has an exceedingly pretty turn for compliments.
"The Queen craves his alliance and assistance."
"The Queen can have his advice only, which is, that when the has seen what Ergland has
to show, she return to her native land, taking with her the proffered £150,000 of John
Company."
"Her messenger does not come empty-handed to you, affectionate and honourable Sir."
"If the hand resemble the foot," said Mr. Punch, "the happy beholder would pay little
heed to whit it might contain." for the loveliest little foot, clad only in a gemmed tlipper,
peeped from under the snowy veil. The ambassadress, evidently smilirg, proceeded.
I have to offer you an Elephant of the first magnitude and docility.
"Give it to good David Mitchell, of the Zoological Gardens."
"Seventeen shawls, glowirg and brilliant t»s sunsets."
"When your Queen visits Paris,, they will serve for presents to the ballet."
"A glotious pipe, jewelled and amber-tipped, with gold ornaments, and its water-vase of
crystal?'
"A clay, piioe one halfpenny, sufficeth the philosopher."
"A necklace of diamonds, the valne of a province. There may be among your household
treasures one on whose neck they might sparkle," said the envoy, approaching domestic
relationships with Oriental scrupulousness.
"Judy is too old and ugly to get herself up in n'ck-nacks, and knows it, for We have told
her, and Toby would not change his brass collar for the crown they are about to stick on
Alexandeb Two."
The veil was agitated, the lovely Lalla was in tears. Her mission had failed, and the poor
child knew not what next to say to the Incorruptible. He, ever kind, took up the dialogue.
"Tell your Royal Mistress, from His Highness Punch, that the Lord of Dalhousie in
annexing Oude, did but that which it was wise and just to do, and tie act can by no means
be reversed. Do not tell her, though it is true, that the rulers of Oude have been its worst
enemies, and that the people rejoice to be delivered from tyranny to the rule of order and law.
But tell her that it is right that those who have been brought up in a bad system should not
be utterly victims, when it is destroyed, and that provision should be made for them. Bid
her accept the Company's money. Tell her to beware of needy adventurers, hungry barristers,
and otheis who will pre ffer their worthless service.
And, my dear,"
The artfulness of woman surpasses the wiliness
of the Tempter himself. This remark may not
be novel, but it is highly applicable to the cir-
cumstances. For, Mr. Punch had just concluded
his conscientious statement of the case of Oude,
and had pronounced the only rational verdict
which can be given upon it, and was about to add
some affectionate words for the bentfit of the
ambassadress herself, when
Lalla withdrew her veil, and sat before Mr.
Punch, crying a little out cf the largest and
brightest of eyes, but smiling a good deal with
the prettiest ana rosiest of mouths, and with a
radiant blush upon her unimpeachable beauty.
"And you won't help us? the said, piteously,
yet looking as if she had a good hope yet left.
"O! won't we, by Jove," gasped Mr. Punch,
floored. "The Eyes have it, as Mb. Leflvbe
noctiirnally obseives. O Lalla, your shawls
and diamonds were vain—but your Eyes—your
Eyes!"
She went away on her Elephant, with all her
presents, and, in addition, Mr. Punch's promise
to advocate the claims of her mistress. So
nobody is to be surprised, should, he come out
with the most convincing aid thundering articles
in favour of the Queen. It will be hard work,
for neither justice nor expediency is on her side,
but that Maid of Honour's eyes have done it
all. Mr. Punch is sold to the QuErN of Oude,
and there's ah end of the matter. He has
stated, above, that this immortal number was
complete when Lalla arrived. To make room
for this narrative of his conversion, he has
reluctantly excluded a rather clever article of
Loss Palmebston's, for which he will find room
another time. It will keep, having plenty of
salt, as may be gathered when we mention that
it is upon the qualifications of Lobd John
Russell for the Premiership.
WORSHIPFUL DEMEANOUR.
Who would not like to have seen the Mayob
of Huntingdon as he appeared upon the plat-
form of the Railway Station during the Royal
Progress to the North ?—if, as the Morning Pott
relates,
"Upon the (run coming to a stand-still, the Earl of
Sandwich introduced the Mayor, who advanced to the
window of the royal carriage, and presented, with becoming
humility, the address of Lis fellow-townsmen, which the
Qckim very graciously received, and reserved for perusal
during her journey."
In what gesture did the evidence of the
Mayor's humility consist P He could not have
cast himself on his knees, for that posture, how-
ever suitable for his Worship, would hardly have
been convenient to Heb Majesty, who would
have had to poke her head out of the carriage
window in order to listen to him. Was his
humility expressed by a salaam in the Oriental
manner, or by a depression of the eves, Jesuit
fashion, or an elevation of them in the style of
EbexezebP We trunt the Worshipful Mayor
was content with taking off his hat like a gen-
tleman, and holding up his head like a man.
All's Fish that comes to Net.
The piospectus of a new company, in course
of formation on the limited principle, has been
issued. This association is denominated the
British Steam Fisheries Company. We suppose
the dividends of this company will be derived
strictly from net profits.
ONE ADVANTAGE OF STOPPING IN TOWN.
Thebe is one advantage of not going into the
country, and that is, you do get the Newspaper
a little earlier of a morning than when every one
was in town.

INFLUX OF FOREIGN EASCALS.
Those most attentive readers of police reports, the Swell
Mob, have been greatly disgusted by the following extract
from one of those interesting narratives:—
"Guildhall.—Sib Peter Laurie drew the attention of the presiding
Magistrate, Aldebhax Fibkis, to the frightful increase of crime in this
country by foreigner*, Mb. Bob, the summoning officer of Guildhall, had
procured for him a return, which he held in his hand, from which it
appeared that no less than seven foreigners had been convicted at the
last Sessions of the Central Criminal Court. Tobqotb Savella, a
Peruvian, was found guilty of forging certain bonds on the Peruvian
Government; Augustus Frietao, Louis Bohk, and Chablbs Thompson,
Germans, were convicted of having in their possession certain plates for
forging Bank of England notes; Johk Dumont, a Frenchman, was con-
victed of uttering forged Bank-notes; Joseph Francois Goble, also a
Frenchman, was found guilty of wounding with intent to do grievous
bodily harm; and Hebkak Sailer, a Russian, was convicted of fraud."
Hitherto native talent has had to sustain competition
with foreigners merely in Art and ordinary mechanical pur-
suits, but it now encounters foreign rivalry in that peculiar
species of industrial occupation which is cultivated by
chevaliers d' induslrie. Against these competitors the
British rogue bas no chance; and the pickpocket in par-
ticular will be totally eclipsed by Continental operators,
whose delicacy of manipulation is so superior to that of our
own, that it will place them at the head of the light-
fingered gentry, in the position of what may be tamed a
light-fingered aristocracy.
The last ray of Protection still flutters among the tag-rag
and bobtail, and the thieves and swindlers are getting up a
petition, which they will ask a noble lord and aright honour-
able gentleman to present to Parliament, for an Act award-
ing an additional period of imprisonment and hard labour
to all convicted foreigners.
ANATOMICAL STUDIES.—MRS. SEXTON, the Popular-
Lecturer to Ladies at Dr. K ahs'b Museum, encouraged by the great
success her lectures have met with, begs to inform her patronesses in
general, and strong-minded ladles in particular, that it is her intention
to open a summer class of anatomy at the sea-side. The great advantage
of this new course will be, that the truths will be demonstrated, not by
wax models, but by living figures. The first lecture will take place in
the open air on the sands at Bamsgate, and will be carried on during
such time as the gentlemen remain in the sea, bathing. The second
lecture will be at Margate during the same hours. The terms of sub-
scription may be ascertained at the Marine Library, the Hospital, and
the principal Chemists' shops, in each place.
TESTIMONIAL TO A MARGATE CLEBGYMAN.
We rejoice in announcing that an appropriate, and, as far as circum-
stances would allow, an elegant testimonial bas been presented by the
inhabitants of Margate to an exemplary clergyman. The following,
partly painful, partly cheering paragraph, appeared the other day in the
Kentish Observer;—
"Open-air Preaching.—During the past week, certain divines have been expound-
ing the principles of Christianity on the sands and in the neighbourhood of the pier and
harbour. The address has generally taken place on the arrival of the boats, when on
account of the number of passengers some confusion has been created. It would, we
think, be weU to hold these meetings at some more suitable spot, which would not
interfere with the traffic of the town, and at the same time be the means of preventing
the discourse being turned into derision, which we regret to hear was the case."
Of the "divines" above alluded to, only one, we understand, bad
the firmness and courage to maintain bis position, and persevere in the
line so long pursued by the celebrated Boatswain Smith. The Boat-
swain, however, used to enjoy the advantage of altitude, which the Rev.
Gentleman who held forth on the Margate sands had not, except, we
believe, on one occasion, when he addressed his promiscuous and
derisive congregation from what appeared to be a wheelbarrow. The
testimonial with which he has been honoured by his numerous and
ardent admirers, supplies this disadvantage. It is not the common
sanctified souvenir of a pair of slippers—Margate slippers are not
worked by ladies. It is a moveable pulpit, of a construction suitable
to the character of his discourses. It consists, in fact, of a tub, which
was originally a sugar-hogshead, but whence more sweetness will now
be tasted than was ever derived by the respectable grocer fromlwhom
the subscribers purchased it. The exterior of this vessel has been
beautifully painted, not with a mere coating of common paint, but in
an artistic manner. It is embellished with illustrative figures, repre-
senting a case which lately occurred before the Margate magistrates;
that of a man fined Is. for selling shrimps on a Sunday. The fine
was unaccompanied with costs. Mb. H. Boys, the clerk, we are
informed, unkindly refusing to levy them; unkindly we say, because
we are sure he must have known the pain he was giving.
We understand that the people of Margate are delighted with the
efforts which are being made by their Sabbatarians to damp the
excessive gaiety, and diminish the extreme bustle which, during three
months in every year, are occasioned there by the influx of visitors.
The suppression of amusements, it is expected, will repel the pleasure-
seekers; and hence an entire relief from the pressure of the extra-
ordinary business of the Margate season will be experienced. If no
shrimps are to be had with tea at Margate on Sundays, Margate will
soon cease to be disturbed by Sunday tea-parties, at any rate. One
attraction only will remain to draw the public from Town; and that
will perhaps still load the steamboats: the diversion which light and
frivolous minds will derive from the sight of the reverend orator
gesticulating from his presentation-tub. There will not, alas! be
wanting some persons of this, and perhaps even of a more reflective
character, who would recommend the Rev. Sabbatarian to harness to
his tub a team of those birds which are connected with Michaelmas,
put out to sea, and preach to the fishes.

"Skuop.sst-Majoe Ed-
wabd Edwards, who has
just received the medal for
distinguished bravery in
the field, enlisted into the
Scots Fusilier Guards in
1835. He was shortly se-
lected for Corporal, and in
this position exhibited so
much talent as a drill-
maBter, that he soon at-
tained the rank of Sergeant
and was then appointed
Drill-Sergeant to the Regi-
ment, and subsequently to
the rank of Sergeant-Major.

His Royal Highness a gold-mounted cane, with an inscription engraved on it notifying
the gift to be a Royal present The Sergeant-Major served with his Regiment
through the pestilential swamps of Bulgaria, and landed with it in the Crimea.
He was present at the battle of Alma, and subsequently at Balaklava, the sortie
on October 26, and the battle of Inkermann. At the latter his conduct was so dis-
tinguished that he received in addition to his medal, £15 gratuity on discharge.
Hie Sergeant-Major was present during the winter of 1854-5, and, by his gallant
example, stimulated his comrades through the hardships of that dreadful teason. He
has also received a medal for long service and good conduct, and the Crimean medal
with four clasps. During the whole campaign this gallant soldier was not absent a
single day from his Regiment, and by his incessant attention to all the minor duties of
his post may be attributed the high state of discipline the men under bis tuition have
attained. During his period of service in the East, Sergeant-Major Edwards has seen
the original number of 930 men, who embarked, dwindle down to about 120, which was
ail that returned home with the Regiment. On the occasion of Heb Majesty's visit
to Aldershot he was called out from his Regiment to the presence of the Qubex, by

during these four years he will receive £200 a-year as pay for doing
nothing; then he will get £500 for an outfit, and a lieutenancy in the
Guards without purchase, value £1,200, a position which will place
him professionally over the heads of every other Ensign and Cornet in
the whole ai my, no matter how long or how distinguished their services
may have been.
The preliminary £200 a-year and the £500 outfit will come out of
Her Majesty's privy purse; but the £1,200 commission will be paid
for by the nation; it will be one commission the less to be distributed
amongst the deserving veterans'of the late war.
And Viscount Mount Muffin will enjoy this prodigious profes-
sional start in life, solely because he is now a sweet boy; an undeniable
fact: bluer eyes and silkier ringlets than bis Lordship's never were
seen. There is no other conceivable reason why his father's son should
be thus magnificently and gratuitously launched in the career of arms, j
He will then, if peace in Europe coutituej, serve his country with1
moderate ardour at Portman and Wellington Barrack*, and at
Windsor; and in more arduous times at Chichester, Winchester, and
Dublin; enjoying four months leave out of every twelve, and being
considerably assisted in his duties by subordinates of the kidney of
Edward Edwards,—common fellows—who do not get four months
leave' out of eveiy twelve, or anything like it.
By the time Mount Muffin is fotty years of age he will be a
Genera), and being a young General, and a very fresh one, un itfigured
by wounds and unshaken by fever, he will be selected, whenever a
European war does break out again, in preference to those sunburnt
war-worn vulgar veterans of the line—such as Colin Campbi ll, Eyre,
and others—to lead our troops once more to disease, starvation, and,
if inexperienced bravery can manage it, to victory.
I Now turn we to Edward Edwabds. This man is avowedly a com-
plete and finished soldier, fit physically and educationally for any rank.
| All England knows him now. We have all seen his picture in the
■ IllvttratedLondon Neics—ve have all read his terse and manly speeches
at the Guards' dinner. He is piobably about foity or forty-five years
j of age, and married. In any other country than this, the services which
j he has rendered would have already raised him to the command of the
j regiment in which he is still but a non-commusioned officer. But cur
I military rystem is different from the continental systems. Let us eee
how it acts in the case of such a man as Edwabd £dwards.
In the first place it absolutely forbids him even to hope to bear a
commission in the regiment in which he has earned his glorious repu-
tation; for if he is piomoted, he must be ejected from the Guards into
the line, as not having been originally "a gentleman."
Commissions in the line have been freely given for nothing to "any-
body" during the late war—any boy of seventeen who could read and
write, and who bad the slightest pretensions to "gentility," might
j have one for the asking; and yet such is the "reward" which has •
been offered to Edwabd Edwards towards the end of his gallant i
career. The pay of the position would not cover the expenses of his I
dress and mess; the outfit which he would receive, £100, amounts to |
but one-fifth of that allotted to the youthful Viscount Mount
Muffin; and, bad he accepted it, ten years hence we should have
found Edward Edwards still a Lieutenant of a West-India regiment,
unable to purchase; whilst the jouthful and beautiful Mount Muffin,
who will not enter the army at all until 1860, will probably in 1866 be a
Lieut.-Col. of the Guards, without having seen a shot fired, or done a
single day's duty off the paving stones of London and Windsor.
There is but one thing to console John Bull for such atrocious
favoritism in the management of his army; or, to speak more correctly,
of the army which he has the privilege of paying; but with the good or
bad management of which it is considered presumptuous in nim to
inter fere, and it is this:
We aie assured that cur soldiers delight in being commanded by
Mount Muffins, and that they cannot abide—indeed, will not follow—
such vulgar upstarts as the glorious Edward Edwards. It is fair to
add that it is the Mount Muffin patty who impress this curious fact
on the public, and that the public need not place implicit belief in it,
unless they are very credulous.
Her Majesty—-God bless her!—loves her soldiers. Let her reflect
on these two oases which are here placed in jnxta-position; if she does,
we shall probably see Edward Edwards in the next Gazette as a
Queen's page—vice Lord Mount Muffin, cashiered for playing at
marbles ou the terrace at Windsor, during divine seivice—and although
it might appear somewhat absurd to see a bearded veteran of forty in
that juvenile but lucrative and easy position, it would not be half so
absurd or unjust as to offer to make such a man at that age, and
without money to turchase his future steps, an ensign in a marching
regiment, as a reward for long years of duties faithfully discharged,
and of dangers and hardships heroically overcome.
MONS. JULLIEN AMONG THE METHODISTS.
Altos ding to the wisest of men, there is "a time to dance."
Certain persons, who pethaps are not the wisest of men, appear to be
of a different opinion. The following piece of intelligence appeared the
other day in a contemporary:—
"On the last sitting of the conference, the Rev. Isaao Kkeuito brought forward a
resolution of the London district missions respecting the growing custom of dancing,
and other worldly amusements closely aUicd to it.
"Mb. KsELiya proposed that the rule prohibiting dancing should be made clearer
and more stringent
"Da. BrsTi.ia said it was high time for the Methodist Conference to give a certain
sound on this matter."
There is a certain sound which, if the Methodist Conference can give
on this matter, they had better give. That sound is t he sound of music,
and if there are any fiddlers, harpists, and other musical performers
among them, let them resolve themselves into an orchestra. After the
more setious business of the Conference, a dance would be a seasonable
diversion. Those constituting the band might play to their brethren
—and sisters. Polkas and other dances could be composed for the
occasion, and might bear appropriate titles. We fancy we can see Dr.
Bunting and Mb. Keeling, in deference to the rather better judgment
of Solomon, provided, each, with an agreeable partner, and tripping it
on the light fantastic toe in the graceful mazes of the Wetleyenne
waits.
The Largest Site in Europe.
_ If Dido had to build another Carthage, she would not select a bull's
hide as the measurement of the space her city was to occupy. She
would simply say, " Give me as much ground as a lady's dress will
cover"—and we have no doubt that Dido would be fairly surprised,
and, at the same time, perfectly satisfied with the extensive ultra-
Babylonian area that the skirts of her new Crinolineopolitan metropolis
would in all probability extend to.

CONDOLENCE WITH DR. CAHILL.
{To the Eev. Dr. Cahill.)
Rev. and bear Sir,
Accept my sincere condolence on the shameful manner in which
you have been treated by Lord Palmbrston's Government for the
publication of a truthful and temperate pamphlet On England and
Naples, printed and sold by J. F. Nugent, styling himself Catholic
printer. Catholic, by the way, in what sense? in the theological? or
in that of universality in business; in the sense of being ready to print
anything', sane or frantic, that he hopes to get paid for P
When you told Lord Palmerston that the Queen of Spain had
insulted his Cabinet, and that they, of course including himself, had
"stomached this insult," you might reasonably have expected him to
take some notice of your taunt. He bas not taken the least, although
you have further informed him that " King Bomba shakes his clenched
fist in the teeth of Palmerston, and for the second time within the
last month we behold the Cabinet of our most gracious Sovereign
gibed, insulted, and brow-beaten." Are you not sorry, by the bye, for
jour most gracious Sovereign, Queen, Defender of the (British
Protestant) Faith P
Not the slightest attention have you attracted from the Government
by the use of the following bold and truthful language:—
"This is glorious news for Ireland, and this new order of things, In reference to
England, may In the ways of Divine Providence, be the preliminary movement in
Heaven for the final debasement of a cruel Legislature, which for ages has robbed and
belied Ireland, blasphemed her ancient creed, killed or banished ber children, and at
this moment bas In ber pay hired bands of the lowest miscreants of human society, to
tortnre her faithful poor and to rob them of their only remaining inheritance—the faith
of their martyred fathers."
You here state a fact, for which of course yon vouch on the credit of
a priest, and the honour of a gentleman. You declare that the British
Legislature-^ Queen, Lords and Commons—are at this present time
employing hired miscreants to inflict torture on the Irish poor. Every-
body knows that as well as yon do: and yet Government takes no more
pains to refute your accusation, than it would if that accusation were
the most notorious falsehood.
Now this is what you may call persecution. It is not putting you
to physical death for the expression of your opinions—if yon opine
what you express—but it is killing you, in as far as you can be killed,
with contempt. Your friend Bomba, if instead of being his friend you
had been his enemy, and bad spoken of his Government as you have of
EAKLY CLOSING BLUE BOTTLES.
The chemists and druggists' assistants are trying to procure an
extension to themselves of the benefit, of early closing, and, as far as is
practicable, of a Sunday holiday. That he who grinds pills should
himself be ground'must be admitted to be a groundless affirmation, and
though an industrious assistant chemist may he expected to stick to his
mortar like bricks, it is not fair that he should be subjected to perpe-
tual pestle-and-mortardom.
Surrounded with all the appliances of health, to sicken for want of
air ai.d exercise is like perishing in the midst of plenty; but this is the
case of the assistant of the chemist and druggist, encompassed with
drawers and jars full of materia medica, having the counter ever under
his nose, and no other prospect before his face than coloured glass
globes adorned with astrological symbols.
That by way of change from an atmosphere of assafintida. ammonia,
camphor, nitrous acid, and chlorine, the young chemist may be enabled
to inhale a tolerable sufficiency of oxygen in its natural state of admix-
ture with nitrogen, it is proposed that druggists should close their
shops daily at eight and during the whole of Sundays, care beiog taken
that somebody shall be on the premises to supply medicines to any
person really requiring them. Of course this provision would be
necessary: for it would be hard that relief from a stomach-ache should
not be purcbaseable because the hour was past eight p.m., or because
the complaint occurred on a Sunday. The unrelieved derangement
of the interior on Sunday might be the Monday's cholera. But if
those who wanted aromatic mixture, or tincture of rhubarb, could get
it by ringing for it, that would sulfice. The one person left to mind
the shop in his turn, might enjoy rest at any rate, and the recreation
of reading his Punch, or something better, without much interruption:
for few customers would knock and ring for a bottle of Preston-salts,
a tooth-brush, eau-de-Cologne, acidulated drops, violet-powder, delec-
table lozenges, fly-papers, marking-ink, court-plaister, gum-arabic,
stick-liquorice, or Windsor soap.
If the plan proposed were universally adopted by druggists, none
would be losers. It has been tried by one individual, Mr. Jones of
Norton-Folgate, and, as he believes, without loss. Thus, from a single
instance, there appears to be not even penny wisdom on the part of
chemists and druggists in late hours and no holy-days, and such being
the case, to keep the pestle always at woik is clearly pound foolish.
WEEDS IN IRELAND.
The children of the National Schools in Ireland are, under authority,
to be instructed by their respective teachers " as to the necessity of
destroying all weeds found on the farms of their parents, or on the
highways adjacent thereto." We hope that this new insult offered to
his enslaved country will not be lost upon Mr. Meagher, now of New
York; for this patriot must consider the behest from the Office of
National Education to pluck up, burn, and destroy the baleful weeds
of Ireland, as no other than a gross, dastardly, cowardly, pusillanimous
insult offered by the sanguinary Saxon to himself?
Fashionable Extremes.
During the first French Empire, the dresses of the ladies were re-

GOOD FUN AT FOLKESTONE.
he dinner lately siren to the
Crimean Tioops at Folke-
stone, by the Folkestone
and Hythe people, ought
not to pass unnoticed; for
several reasons. First—
according to the report of
the entertainment:—
"The dinner, which consisted
of roaat beef, same pies, lamb,
mutton, and plum-pudding, was
accompanied by plenty of beer,
aie, and rum punch, alter which
each soldier received a quantum
of cigars and tobacco."
We would rather have
dined with the Crimean
heroes at Folkestone than
with their companions in
arms at the Surrty Gardens,
where the banquet, com-
pated to that above des-
cribed, appears to have been
light and elegant, but un-
satisfactory. Mb. Gough,
of water-spouting celebrity,
may say what he likes; but
most of our readers will
perhaps rather think that
plenty of beer, ale, and
rum-punch all round, is
preferable to one bottle of champagne between three.
Secondly:
"The Chair was taken by Beboeaxt Taylor, of the 6th ErinlskUlen Dragoons,
supported by some stalwart comrades, with real Crimean beards."

PERSONS WHO OFFERED THEIR SERVICES TO THE
QUEEN OF ODDE.
Day add Martin.—To provide her establishment with brushes and
blacking, under the vulgar belief that the Queen's attendants had
their faces cire'd every morning, as well as their boots.

B. Disraeli, Esq.—To supply Her Majesty with a superior kind of

Hence it would seem that among the many impositions, or shams, as
Mr. Carlilb calls them, of the present day, are to be reckoned false
Crimean beards; but the question is, whether the beards are false as
beard", or false in pretending to be Crimean? The experiment of
pulling the beard would be a test of its physical reality, and a con-
vincing demonstration of its Crimean genuineness would probably be
obtained by the same process—which would on that account be dan-
gerous.
Thirdly, a British soldier present made a joke :—
"Private Dr Cabtb said—We lost many a brave man, but we never lost our good
name or honour. We cannot forget Miss Niohtlsgalk, nor cau we forget Alls-
Management."
Bravo, Private De Carte! well said, honest soldier. It is a gratify-
ing sign of the improvement of the British army, to find a man in the
ranks make a very passable joke at a public dinner, and probably after
several glasses of punch. Punch, indeed, may be responsible for a worse
joke. At any rate the joke of Private De Carte is very much above
the average of House of Commons jokes: it is a joke with a purpose as
well as a point: and both Houses of Parliament would do well to keep
it in mind. It will bear repetition, it is quotable, and will continue to
be quotable—alas! perhaps too long.
Simpson.—To put Her Majesty
Cremorne Gardens; and to solicit the favour of an early day being'
fixed for a visit to the Royal Property, in order that suitable arrange-
ments might be made for a grand/cite to be given in her honour.
Tub Ethiopian Serenadebs (from Evans').—To be designated Her
Majesty's Band of Honour, with au'hority to sing outside the royal
balcony six-and-twenty times a-day.
Lord Maidstone.—As the Queen's Troubadour.
Mb. Atkinson (Parfumeur).—To have Her Majesty's name and
portrait to a new Scent to be called "Les Soupirs de la Seine d' Oude,"
and to supply her court generally with perfume.-
Lord John Russell.—To dramatise Her Majesty's wrongs in a
strong, national, thrilling five-act tragedy (with new Indian effects) for
the Surrey, Victoria, and Standard Theatres, as well as the Grecian,
Bower, and Britannia Saloons.

At one of the late Regatta Balls an extensive lady-patroness came
sailing into the room, witn her three daughters in her wak«, being all
of them attired in the extremest height, or, as we should now say,
breadth of fashion. Two small aquatic wags who, as the convoy passed,
were jammed against the door-post, immediately bore down upon an
acquaintance who was present, and discharged into his ears (which
unlortunately had no cotton in them) two broadsides of facetiousness:
one observing that he almost thought that "those three-deckers "—in
allusion perhaps to their three tiers of flounces—" would have carried
him from his moorings by their tremendous press of canvas;" and the
other suggesting that a lady's dress nowadays would make a good
course for a match, as it would afford au opportunity for testing the
advantages of Great Circle Sailing.

114 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 20, 1856.

ACCEPTING A SITUATION.
Mamma and that Urchin William get round safely, but Augustus and Emily are overtaken by the Tide. Well! Well!
They are above High-Water mark, 60 perhaps they •won't be very miserable tor the next hour or two.
LIBERTY PILES . THE AUSTRIAN BARS.
Mr. Punch's Artist presents his compliments to Francis Joseph,
the "hope"—(upon the veracity of that most respectable, and happily,
most retired peer, now somewhere in the Grampian Hills, the Earl op
Aberdeen)—especially the "hope" of Austria (hope told a flattering
fib!), and offers him the accompanying design for a historical cartoon
to decorate any or all of his palaces, in Vienna, at Schonbrunn, in
Pesth, in Venice, or elsewhere.
His Imperial Majesty may deign to condescend to'remember a
certain Italian, named Felice Orsini, late a tenant of one of His
Majesty's many gaols (strong abiding-places for liberty-loving rebels),
but now of London. The aforesaid Felice, in no way having before
him the fear of the wrath of his Imperial master, only too careful of
petulant people who do not know what ,is good for them, especially
when administered by careful gaolers and vigilant turnkeys,—the
aforesaid Felice, spuming the hospitality of his Sovereign, and no
doubt assisted by the Evil One, did with audacious industry, and
rebellious perseverance, file through the bars of his stone apartment,
and assisted by ill-disposed people (where trill they goto P) did daringly
steal his freedom, the theft being secured to him onTtbe cold, soil of
misty England; secured to the aforesaid robber of freedom in contempt
and in despite of Francis Joseph of Austria, his hundreds of thousands
of swords and bayonets, and parks of artillery notwithstanding; a
bitter truth, a nauseous reality to be chewed in the legitimate moutb,
and digested in the right-divine stomach.
Whereupon, Mr. Punch's Artist has thought the historic fact in every
way worthy of graphic history: to which end he has ventured a little
to enlarge and sublime the subject, by merging the individual in the
genera). His Imperial Majesty will tberefore be graciously pleased to
accept the accompanying design, not as the representation of one bare
fact, but as a hopeful allegory of a coming national truth. Thus
it is humbly hoped that his Imperial Majesty may gather from
the contemplation of the picture a modicum of humanity and wisdom,
to serve him against any possible stress. To which like end a copy
may be forwarded to his fraternal Majesty, the King oi Naples.
If, however, the Emperor op Austria should refuse to accept the
accompanying design for the embellishment of all or any of his many
palaces, Mr. Punch begs leave to dedicate it, first and especially—
To the unknown benevolences who conveyed to Felice Orsini the

files tbat sawed his bars; files that, making sweetest music, made the
heart of Libeity beat higher and higher with every note.
Further, it is dedicated to the stout, the valiant hands that "took
hold of the cord," and in contempt of the Austrian halter that then
hung over them for the deed of mercy, helped the maimed and lamed
Felice from the Austrian pit, and "landed him safely on the ground."
It is dedicated to the noble hearts that "for eight days" carried the
victim of Francis Joseph to and fro, tenderly "like a child."
It is dedicated to the devoted souls, who, with "total forgetfulness
of risk incurred, or danger courted in sheltering or assisting" him,
still comforted and sped the fugitive on his way to assured freedom;
until, the sea tbat rolls round England, made him a sacred thing;
sacred even from the gaoler-hand of the Emperor op A i stria. The
eagles scream, but the waves roar back a lion-like defiance.
THE WRONGS OF CKINOLINE.
"My dearest Mb. Puacii,
"Do, pray, let me beg and entreat of you, please, be so kind
as to notice the dreadful carelessness that everybody almost is guilty
of in not minding what they are about, and dirtying, and tearing, ana
spoiling ladies' dresses. I appeal to you because I know your chival-
rous spirit; you are like one of the knights of the olden time who rode
about righting wrongs and redressing grievances, particularly those of
distressed damsels, with their lances, and in the same way 1 wish you
would give the rude, negligent, provoking, disagreeable creatures I
mean, a poke. Oh! I have no patience with them. They know that
dresses are worn lorjg and wide now: then, sinoe they are aware of
this, why can they not bear it in mind P Instead of which, whenever
they go down-stairs, gentlemen I mean, to dinner, or away from a
play or a concert, or anywhere where there are ladies with them, those
behind us are certain to tread on the skirts of our dresses, thinking of
something else. The same at table, where the legs of their chairs are
sure to be on our flounces, and when we rise to retire, crash they go!
"Of course, owing to the width of dresses, it is now impossible to
get into a brougham, or any carriage almost, without the dress rubbing
against the sides. Now when drivers of other vehicles in the streets,
not only cabmen, but with carriages of their own, must see that, wby
is it they take little or no care how they drive, and splash ours, so that
we must brush against it getting in, and there is a beautiful new dress
perhaps all over mud P If they cannot help splashing, which they could
if they tried, the Board of Health, or whatever it is, ought to see that
the streets are kept in a proper state, swept nice and clean, not only in
London, but at watering-places now, and other places where fashion-
able peeple go, and, being obliged to appear as such, if the streets are
dirty, of course they naturally sweep up the mud, and rub it on, and one
way and the other get dirt all over, and spoil their things.
"Another thing: when men are walking along the pavement they
never mind how they carry their umbrellas and walking-sticks. Very
often they hold them lengthways by the middle, and then, as they
hurry along, with their minds absent in stupid thought, or business,
looking straight before them, up in the sky, or anywhere but where
they ought, the crook at the end catches in a fold of the dress, and
—crack!—tears it all down. If they must carry sticks and umbrellas,
they should confine themselves to those with knobs for handles, instead
of hooks getting in the way of our dresses and tearing them.
"Servants, too, are so very inconsiderate in arranging things with-
out allowing proper room. One cannot step into a balcony where
there are plants without upsetting a geranium, overturning a myrtle, or
knocking down an orange tree, or perhaps breaking a beautiful vase—
all for want of a little foresight, which, if they do not exercise it, what
advantage is it to be gifted with such a prerogative in preference to
the inferior species P
"I also think, Mr. Punch, you might give a hint to gentlemen when
they go inside a carriage, not to take up so much room as they do with
a lady by the side of them, and her dress, as the case generally is,
Sread out over their knees. Tell them they ought to try and make
emselves a little less, and then we should think more of them.
"You would confer another obligation if you would recommend
railway companies and the managers of theatres, and other amusements
to alter their seats, the narrowness of which makes them very uncom-
fortable: and this I will say, which may have a good tendency, that
almost the only place a lady can appear in, and go without being
inconvenienced at the entrance, is church, where, at Lleast, one at a
time, one seldom has to squeeze one's way through the door.
"Oh! I could complain a great deal more, but now I must con-
clude, for fear too much room should be occupied in your interesting
columns by
"Marine Parade, Sept. 1856. "Crinoline."
"F.S. If they would but think the least in the world, the inconveni-
ence might be so very easily remedied."
THE CORONATION IN MOSCOW.
By a British Cynic.
Hark! the cannon are roaring, the bells all resound,
Alexander is coming this way to be crowned;
Coronations are ever attended with noise,
For men still will be men, and boys always be boys.
Here they come, and who first P the Police, I presume,
Yes, the mounted Police, who sport helmet and plume;
"Move on there!" they '11 scarce have occasion to tay,
For nobody's likely to get in their way.
The procession comes after, 'mid shouts of applause,
Which every procession is certain to cause,
If it Hashes and shines, and is coloured enough,
No matter at all whom 'tis got up to puff.
The wearers were nothing without arms and clothes,
The excitement is caused, then, by these and by those;
Yelibw jackets and gossamer chain-mail combine,
With.embroidered.korse-cloths, in the front of the line.
Follow lances,'and pennons, and matchlocks and swords,
The old-fashioned weapons of barbarous hordes,
With scarf upon shoulders and sash around waist,
Picturesque in effect—Oriental in taste.
Black sheepskins, red skull-caps, flags white, red, and blue,
(There's a song of that name which in Moscow won't do)
And a bristling array of long red-handled pikes:
How the multitude roars! this is just what it likes.
Blue uniforms, mounted, and others than blue,
Bespangled with jewels and brilliant of hue,
Of all sorts of colours all manner of vests,
And orders, stars, crosses, and ribands on breasts-
Gowns, turbans, and trousers, camises, capotes,
Red, white, yellow breeches, and antique steel coats,
And scarlet and purple, and mazarine roots,
Yataghans, battle-axes, and green and gold suits.
Horse-trappings and liveries, domestic and state,
Having heaps of gold lace, upon chargers elate,
Chariots, crimson and gilt; helmet, armour, and crest.
Then his Majesty next and dressed out in his best,
Then the court and court ladies, and lastly the crowd,
Their shouts and their cries how astoundingly loud!
And another crowd probably, some other day,
Will bawl in the same place and just the same way.
And what sort of men did these dresses contain P
Of the whole for a sample take some of the train,
Some sixty in number; with gold braiding shone
Their malachite garb; and cocked hats they had on.
Knee shorts, white silk stockings, and shoes on their feet,
With buckles confined, made their raiment complete:
And their shorts were of plush—in their tight buckled shoes,
These same gentlemen walked, in the posse, by twos.
In their gait, 'twas remarked, they limped somewhat and flinched,
For their shoes were new made, and unpleasantly pinched.
All the slaves of a despot, howe'er smart their dress,
Are but flunkeys who feel the shoe pinch more or less.
Travelling Experiences.
L? you stop in a foreign town, go by all means to an English hotel or
Boarding-house, and there you will have English fare, be charged in
English money, and hear nothing but English, spoken. It will be
almost the same as if you were in England, excepting that you will find
the chickens rather thin, the Cheshire unpleasantly strong, the Queen's
English very queer, the company exceedingly sour, and the beer twice
as dear as in your own country.
Impudent Austria!
The Vienna Presse is about to give a German edition of Mrs.
Stowe's second black draught, Bred! And this to show a virtuous
horror of slavery! That Austria should patronise the mother of Uncle
Tom is as though Legree himself should piotect Eliza, the mother of
little Henry.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 20, 1856.
SHEFFIELD BLADES.
ant pen and pocket-
knives have been
handsomely be-
stowed upon the
Crimean Burviv-
ors of the 4th Dra-
goon Guards, now
stationed at Shef-
field; and are to
be taken as a
slight set-off to
the cheap glory
of the Cardigan
sword, presented
to his lordship at
Leeds bj his York-
shire tenantry,
and manufactur-
ed, it is said,out of
Yorkshire sickles;
probably in the
hope that his lord-
ship may never be
called upon to use
the testimonial
blade save and
except in the ope-
ration of corn-
cutting. On the
presentation of
the knives, Mr. Overend, the Deputy-Lieutenant of the West Riding,
very fitly spoke of the service of one William Russell, in the Crimea,
whose simple pen-knife has proved of greater value to England than
the swords and bayonets of squadrons and battalions. "The country,"
said the speaker, "is much indebted to him." Now this truth has
been uttered so often, that surely it is time that the country should
set about an early liquidation of what is owing.

TESTIMONIALS.
Mr. Roebuck has received eleven hundred guineas, as a small
evidence of the golden opinions he has won of his Sheffield constituents.
"We must say that we mightily- admire this simpls, tangible mode of
acknowledging a man's services; for a testimonial is, nine times out of
ten, nothing more than a double blander. In the first place, there is
the blunder of adulation, or jobbing, or snobbery, in the idea of the
offering itself; and secondly, there is the blunder in the form and
purpose of the thing bestowed. This twin mistake has been felici-
tously illustrated of late in the Yorkshire sword given to the Earl of
Cardigan-. Now the noble warrior has it, what will he do with it?
We have known of cases of testimonial in which the person plated has
been involved by the honour done him in a fearful annual expense.
For instance—there was Mr. Churchwarden Chuebs. An enthusi-
astic member of the Established Church, it was his pride, during his
period of office, to keep the church weathercock so thickly, so magni-
ficently gilt, that it was the earliest pleasure of the day to the whole
parish to observe, upon rising, which way the wind blew. Well, on
the termination of bis period of office. Chubbs was presented by a
grateful parish with a handsome silver epergne and salver. What was
the consequence? Chubbs, even when assisted by Mrs. Chubbs and
the children, could not, each like an unhappy Theseus, sit and for ever
sit gazing upon the complimentary plate. What's the use of having
anything handsome," Mrs. Chubbs would continually cry, "unless
you show itP" Whereupon Chubbs, feeling the acuteness of the
question, gave a large party, and duly exhibited the testimonials. And
fliis party was renewea year after year, at the annual expense of—but,
as Mr. Chubbs himself at last declared, he couldn't bring himself
decently to think of it. Now, had the testifying parish laid; out the
same sum upon a batch of prime port, Chubbs might have now and
then mildly and unexpensively shared the gift with a friend to the last
drop; and even when all the wine was drunk, there would still have
remained the monumental bottles.
Mrs. Goodenocgh, a kind creature, a local benevolence, for her
many active virtues was presented with a silver cake-basket. What
was the result? As Goodenough a little unfeelingly observed.
"the house was for ever after swarming with tea-parties." And
Mrs. G. put the same question put by Mrs. C, " What's the use of
having anything handsome if you don't show it P" Now, if instead of
a silver cake-basket, Mrs. Goodenough had been presented with, say
an elegant perambulator, the testimonial would have been a daily object
in the eyes of the parish for, who shall venture to say, how many years
to follow?
Nothing ?o charming, nothing so refining and elevating as the bene-
volent spirit that dictates the gift of testimonials; the only matter
quarrelled with by Air. Punch being ttie mode and form in which they
too often shape themselves. Our Gracious Maj£sty of England has,
we read it in the newtpupers, recently given to the Count VV alewski
a magnificent gold snuff-box set with diamonds, in commemoration of
the treaty of peace. Well, we know that snuff-boxes have, time out of
mind, been the chosen form for diplomatic presents; and there may be
a significance in the fact, seeing that diplomacy seldom treats that the
world is not more or less taken by the nose. Very lately John Bull
has certainly felt the thumb and finger of his dear ally, aiid has a little
too pacifically followed the leading. However, we will not encourage
these thoughts; indeed, it is impossible with the coronation bells of
Moscow beating them out of us. And yet we think the Count's
snuff-box might have been made of Russian platina, and, with all the
diamonds in the world if it would only have held them, with just a little
bit of Malachite; at once reflecting the slippery polish of Russian
diplomacy with the pure greenness of the English.
Now the testimonial awarded to Mr. Roebuck is every way fitting,
because at the will of the possessor it is, in every way, convertible.
Nevertheless, we believe we are in no way violating a confidence in
stating that, even at hard-headed, hard handed, practical Sheffield, the
testimonial might have been in its form and purpose only another
blunder i.dded to the blunders of the sort not to be numbered. For
instance, one of the Committee, with the best intentions, proposed the
gift of a large, massive silver-gilt gridiron; as peculiarly typical of the
Honourable Member's patriotic conduct, when, originating the Crimean
Commission, he called certain high folks over the coals. There was, we
confess it, thought and significance in the proposition; but of what
practical use would have been that sterling gridiron in Mr. Roebuck's-
kitchen? Neither a Secretary-of-War, nor a Quartermaster-General,
nor even a Quartermaster's Assistant, are to be broiled every day.
Such was the common-sense reply and conviction; and, very wisely, as
we think, the idea of the gridiron was abandoned.
Rising from the purely domestic to the poetically classic it was next
proposed to shape the testimonial as a candelabra, the shaft to be
formed of a group, Apollo flaying Mar»yas; Mr. Roebuck to be re-
quested to sit for Apollo (with a Sheffield whittle in his hand), and a
noble Earl, with a bagpipe fallen at his feet, to be skinned as Marsyas.
For a time, the adoption of the candelabra seemed inevitable, but
happily better counsels prevailed. It was very sensibly ruled, that
Mr. Roebuck being a man whose habits and temperament eschewed
the mere vanity of show, it would be almost unjust to their honourable
Member to consider him seated in the presence of a dozen of Palmer's
candles, contemplating bis own public virtues chased in silver, with
nobody present, save perhaps puss asleep on the hearth-rug.
Finally, and we rejoice at the determination, it was resolved that the
testimonial should shape itself in .the simplicity of eleven hundred
guineas. Had it been eleven times eleven hundred, it would have been
equally worthy of the man and his merits. We can only wish to every
guinea the property of the honey-bee. May it go forth merrily, and
return doubly-laden!
FRANKENSTEIN FOR FAMILIES.
What a happy thing it would be for families if Manchester could
only do what t he Manchester Guardian seems to cay that it can, in the
following commercial statement:—
"The difficulty of getting anythingTmore for domestics, while the yarns they are
marie from have risen another step, is extorting louder complaints than ever from the
suffering manufacturers."
Could domestics but be spun out of yarns, or constructed by
machinery in any other way, from how much perpetual annoyance
would almost every materfamilias be delivered! How few plates,
dishes, glasses, cups and saucers, would be broken by a well regulated
artificial domestic! There would be no waste in the kitchen, no sauce
would be had thence except culinary; the leg of mutton would last
many times as long as it lasts now; and the cat would not run away
with the spoon and other things anything like so often as she unfor-
tunately does at present. Having automatic female domestics, rightly
constituted and wound up so as always to go on properly, we shou'd
never have policemen sneaking down our areas, nor ever at any time
discover Crimean heroes in our coal-holes.
The Koyal British Bank.
At the first meeting of the anxious depositors, it was resolved, "that
no solicitor was to be on the Committee." This is as though, in the
days of jEsop, certain harried rabbits should have written up outside
the warren, "No ferret admitted."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BILL OF THE CHURCH.
Our dear Mother Church is jost now undergoing a species of harm-
less persecution harmless, because it is simply one of the sports of the
Parliamentary vacation, and will cease when there is something else to
fill newspaper columns—touching the inadequate pay received by her
working children, the Curates. It has been suggested that these
Clergymen would be more worthily remunerated were the nation made
aware of their deserts, and were there the means of comparing the
labours of a priest who receives £S0 a-year with those of the hierarch
whose salary is £10,000. In fact, it has been proposed that a Curate, like
a Doctor or an Attorney, should make out his bill, and show how his
time is occupied. The suggestion has given some offence, but we
really think that if all classes of clerical officials were to render such
accounts, and have them duly "taxed" before the payment, many
advantages would arise. We should know what we were paying for.
With this idea, and as a true Friend of the Church, as distinguished
from Church-craft, Punch has ventured to frame a skeleton bill or two,
as hints for the sort of accounts which he would like to see laid,
annually, before Parliament.
Beginning', as is fitting, with the lower grade of teacher, here is our
idea of a Curate's bill for a week :—
John Bull, Esq.
To the Rev. Erasmus Adams, M.A., (Little Slushton).
1866.
Sept 13. [Satin-day.) Writing three Sermons, my wife copying Into same^

the Times deprecating more than a revision of the Book, and sent article
to Blackwood. My wife had all the school-children to tea, saying, poor
dear thing, that it might be the last time. God forbid I Read to them,
and showed magic lantern. Saw some siclc persons at night, and slip-
ping in the mud near Jukes the brewer's, spoilt my only other pair of

Scjxpel ...
For the week's work, I charge one fifty-second part of r.-y ineome of £80.
£ S. D.
And now, in contrast with the preceding mean and shabby bill of the
Rev. Erasmus Adams, let us give the aort of account that would be
rendered by his Diocesan. This is a much more creditable affair :—
John Bull, Esq.
To the Right Rev. the Bishop op Belldragon. (The Palace.) Dr.
1866.
Sept. 13. Having seen It stated in the public papers that the Premier was)
visiting the neighbouring watering-place. Jellyfish, sending over my
butler to ascertain, quietly, how this was, and where his Lordship was
staying, and found it was at the Royal Hotel. Arranging for spending
a few days there, for my health is far from good, and the Bishop o*
Goldinutox Is likely to be released from his earthly ministrations
Sept. 14. Journey to Jellyfish, taking two carriages only, but sending on
my own wine, for my duty to the Establishment forbids my incurring
any sinful risk to my bodily welfare. N.B. Had the 1815 port rebottled,
to avoid the perils of shaking. Arrived without accident, (D.G.), and
providentially obtained a drawing-room next to Lord Palmbrston b.
The fatigue of the day was compensated, as is always mercifully
ordained, by a delightful night's rest
Sept. 15. Taking a warm bath, and after breakfast was about to walk on
the Parade, when Lord Palmers ton opened his door at the same moment
as myself. He seemed pleased to Bee me, and we walked up and down
for nearly an hour. I think he has right views, for he spoke, I may
say, most admirably about the necessity of promoting the best kind of
men to Church dignities, and his cheerfulness is most delightful, lie
remarked " how people would stare if he and I were to begin pitching
stones at the ladies' bathing machines." Of course he was not in earnest.
I secured him for dinner for next day but one. A good deal occupied
afterwards, in considering the details of the repast, for we are to be all
things ts all men that we may gain all men, but my excellent help-
mate obtained some valuable hints as to his Lordship's tastes, through
her lady's-maid. In the evening, made some notes for a speech I trust
to deliver next session against Godless Education
Sept. 16. Dictating to my excellent Secretary several notes In reply to cor-
respondents. Rebuked some of the inferior clergy for their restlessness,
and new-fangled schemes for enlarging the usefulness of the Church,
but relieved an applicant, a curate with a sick wife and nine children,
with a donation of a sovereign, to which he is heartily welcome. Inti-
mated to a clergyman, who "has doubts," that he should not set up his
worldly reasoning against the Articles he has sworn to, and had a long
interview with the landlord of the hotel, who seemed Inclined to use his
best energies for my dinner to-morrow. Reading Mr. Alison, with much
pleasure, in the evening, until I fell asleep
Sept 17. Bathing in the Sea—a new see for me, as my dear helpmate play-
fully, and as she insisted, prophetically, remarked. Was much shocked
to hear that the Bishop or Goldimoton is all but despaired of. A
drive, through beautiful scenery, restored my spirits. Met Lord Dkrbt
on horseback, and heard some anecdotes of the Court of our Gracious
Sovkekioh, told by blm with Irresistible humour, but perhaps a little
levity. But we must make allowances, for he is troubled about many
things, and some of his racing horses have disappointed him. Dressed
and received the Premier. The dinner went off excellently and he
especially complimented the wine (though he partook of but little), and
said, classically and happily, hearing that it had been re-bottled and
re-sealed, "Seatum, nan animum, mutat" la conversation on Church
affairs he was guarded, but I think he was struck with my argument that
for episcopal promotion he should select only a man of decided opinions,
who was firmly convinced that existing arrangements were the best for
us all. He was much pleased with my nine girls, and called them the
Muses. I trust that my endeavours have been blessed . . . .
Sept. 18. Not well, but looked through the Visitation Charge prepared for
me by my excellent Secretary, for we must labour with our own hands .
Sept. 19. A private letter from Lord having informed me that the
see of Goldington is vacant, took an opportunity of seeing Lord Pal-
hbbstox, who apprised me that he had promised it to Dr. Latitude. I
had hoped that he would have been guided to a different choice, and one
which would have been better for the Church, but the children of this
world are wise in their own fashion. Determined to returu to the
Palace—paid the hotel bill, which seemed high (£18 lis. 6U), and got
into my carriage after lunch

HORRIBLE ATTACK UPON (THE NERVES OF) AN OFFICER IN
ST. JAMES'S PARK.
"There, don't cry, darlin'—llcss 'is 'art—and this pretty soger gentleman '11 let Billy
look at his watch/"
THE CHURCH ON A LOW DIET.
"No Cure no pay" is an expression with which every
one of course is well familiar; but with as familiarity is
now engendering the most complete contempt for an obser-
vation which, we have discovered, is a manifest untruth.
For if the letters which have recently been published in
the Times may be in any way received by us as letters of
credit, there are at present very many cures about the
kingdom to which the word* "no pay" might not im-
properly attach, the pay being so small as scarcely to be
payable in our existing coinage, and iu fact it really does
not. pay to take it.
Equality of church revenues would be a doctrine only
entertainable by perdition-caught heretics and dissenting
revolutionists. But every amicus curia, or friend of the
curates, must regret that their pay is not more equal to
their work. We hear of certain medicines being rapidly
"absorbed," but their rapidity in this respect is far sur- I
passed by that of certain metals. The absorption, for |
instance, of such ores as gold and silver, by a small curate's
small family—small we mean in point of stature only, not
in numbers or in apoetites—is generally so rapid as to
border on the marvelleus. Fifty, or even a full hundred,
pounds a-year may be readily swallowed up in the shape
of bread and milk and vegetables by any "little" family;
and there need be no maternal fears of their young digestions
being injured by such clogging luxuries as pies and puddings.
Indeed, the chances are that half the sons of the Church,
that is, at least, all the children of the curates, must, even
before the sanctifying hands are laid on them, have become
from early habit confirmed vegetarians, since it is not
probable that they cm have formed a taste for meat.
Whereas the son of any of the Fathers of the Church—
we mean, of course, to use the noun in its episcopal
rendering—has by cause of his good livings (for the case
is rarely singular) far less chance of ever suffering from
any poverty of blood than from actual pluracy.
Rosa Bonheur's Ewes and Wethers.
The Scotsman tells us that Rosa Bonheur—the mar-
vellous Rosa!—has been at Falkirk Trjsr, where she
bought two black-faced ewes and two wethers, for subjects
of study. It is a pity that Rosa was not present at Prim-
rose Hill, to see John Frost's mob. She might then have
selected some wonderful specimens of English asses.
CHALLENGES TO CURIOSITY.
A Correspondent gratifies our taste for curiosities by sending us
the following couple of advertisements, which we think with him
deserve a somewhat wider circulation than that which their inserters
originally bargained for. As, however, in the light of literary compo-
sitions they perhaps may prove of interest to our readers, we shall
generously waive our usual charge for their insertion: although we
certainly are not too proud to think of taking it as conscience-money,
should the advertisers feel that it would ease their minds to forward it.
The first is from the Shields Gazette:—
CHALLENGE.
THE HOWDON KEELMEN are ready to make a Sweepstake to row
any Keelmen on the Tyne for a Sweepstake of 5#. entry, with £2 added. The
boats to be taken on shore, and tossed for choice Six days before the Race.
We should say these Howdon Keelmen are a stalwart set of fellows,
if they can take their boats on shore, and play pitch and toes with
them. Hitherto, in our ignorance, we have only heard of boats being
''tossed" by whales, and "very like a whale" would he a natural
exclamation if one were told of such a feat being humanly accomplished.
It certainly is not the sort of exercise that we should try "for choice,"
and while half-pennies exist, we are rather at a loss to see the use of it.
If the boats be merely tossed as substitutes for coppers, we suppose
that "thwarts or keels" would be called as the equivalent for "heads
or tails." But regarding the performance simply as a feat of strength,
it strikes us as coming it a little too strong.
The second challenge is given in the Newcastle Guardian:—
A CHALLENGE.
rpHOMAS AND MATTHEW CLOTJGH, brothers, of Cowpen Colliery,
-a- are open to Shoot any Two Persons In the Coal Trade for £10 or £15; 21 yards
rise, and SO yards fall, with 10 or 15 birds each; and Thomas Clouoh is open to Shoot
any Single Person on the above terms.
We think we never properly appreciated until now what advantages
we enjoy as connubial beings. Judy preserve us! how we tremble to
reflect, "that but for her we might find ourselves the "any Single
Person" whom this Mr. Clough would single out for his especial
shooting. As it is, being happily in a marital state, and having no
connection whatever with the coal trade, we feel ourselves secure
against these gunpowdery-minded brothers: who for the small charge j
of " £10 or £15 "—mercenary miscreants! our Judy even would not part
with us for that!—would be so murderously "open to shoot" us.
But it makes us nervous even now to picture to ourselves what might
have otherwise befallen us. Only imagine at our time of life, and state
of corpulence, having a "21 yards rise" taken out of us; and this but
as a prelude to a " 60 yards tall!" Compared to that, what to us were
all th e ups and downs of bubble bank-shares or cross-the-Channel
steamboats?
A Clerical Cypher.
A Certain Dignitary (or indignitary, rather) of the Church, previous
to leaving it, left his card on the Bishop of his diocese, with the initials
marked iu the corner, "P. P. C." Upon the mat ter being referred to
some ladies, they said that it was the customary abbreviation of "Pour
Prendre Congi" the conge in this instance being obviously intended for
Rome; but Bernal Osborne, who was present, exclaimed; "No, no,
no,—don't destroy the meaning, it is perfect almost to a letter—in my
opinion the initials clearly mean P(a),P(a),C(y),—in one word,
Papacy!"
What is the Derivation of "Kursaal?"
Wht, my dear young friends, you must know a "Kursaal" is a
beautiful palatial establishment, ever so much finer than Buckingham
Palace, that is generally thrown open, with its gardens, lakes, ducks
and eeese, to everybody at a German watering-place, and it is so called
a "Kursaal," because I must tell you that the Curse of gambling is
always going on there morning and night!

THE MODERN CANUTE.
^ . HE Reverend Ma.
Hope, that never flatters so charmingly as
when kings have to be flattered, told the flat-
tering tale, that all peasants born in Russia after
the coronation of the Emperor would be free.
This tale, however, turns out to be about as false
as most of the tails worn by tbe horses in a
circus. We suppose that Alexander has his
flatterers, much the same as old Canute had, and
that they wish to persuade him that he can bid
the Serf not to pass a certain limit—Baying to
it, "Thus far shalt thou come, but no further."
However, in the inevitable progress of events,
the Serf may advance, and in the rush the
Emperor may have to retreat, as Canute did,
unless perchance he prefers beiog washed away
by the advancing tide. In the meantime, it
would not make a bad historical cartoon to be
hung up in all the school-rooms (if there is
any other rod, but the rod of iron ?) in Russia,

to stand still "—carefully putting the date
under it, "1856."

Is not black bituminous smoke, like ours. It curls gracefully upwards, in light-blue
wreaths, like perfume from a choice Havannah. But we notice we have boots and
black trowsers on, and on our head we feel a heavy white hat, in form and colour not
unlike a Stilton cheese. Our presence by its vulgarity insults the ideality of the lovely
scene before us. Such a highly-silvered metropolis is tlie fit casket for suoh a jewel of
an Emperor as Alxxasdkr, who only rules to make 60,000,000 human beings happy.
We will rush out, and allow our aching eyes to rest awhile after this bright illusion on
the dingy realities of that big, untidy bricklayer's yard, called Leicester Square."
We are not aware that we are laying down any new truth in saying,
that opinions change with time and place. What is black as an
Ethiopian Serenader to-day may become couleur de rose as & May Queen
to-morrow: a slice of good luck, or a piece of orange-peel, a chimney-
sweep, or a fine day, a smile from a balcony, or a chimney-pot from a
housetop, may make all the difference in our thoughts. If it is thus
with trifles, what must it be with grievances as big as a battle-field?
How differently we think of Russia now to what we did six months
ago! We could not bring forward two better proofs of this changeable
feeling than the proofs ot two articles written by the same critic on
Mr. Bueford's Panorama of Si. Petersburg in Leicester Square.
We only give the above notices as proof how the opinions of some of
the wisest of men turn unconsciously from hour to hour with the hour-
glass of politics. But neither report—not the very black one, nor the
very white one—does justice to the surpassing merits of Mr. Btjr-
ford's Panorama. It is a flash of sunshine after the darkness of our
own Walls'-end London. To see the one after the other is like merging
out of a coal-cellar into the bright open air. It is a capital way of
seeing St. Petersburg, and gives one almost as good a peep into the
interior of a Russian town as one of Mr. Russell's photographic
descriptions. You see the town a vol d'aigle; the eagle in this instance
being, of course, a Russian one. You take your flight, merely by running
up one pair of stairs, and have the further satisfaction of saving into
the bargain all the expense and worry of coronation prices and
droschky extortions.
This is the first article, written by him before the Treaty was signed:
ST. PETERSBURG :-AS IT WAS DURING THE WAR.
"This is a city every way worthy of the stone-hearted Despot who holds 60,000,000
of human beings in chains. The Palaces look like gaols—the bouses have all the for-
bidding look of sponging-houses about them. There is tbo thick stifling atmosphere
as of a prison about the place. It is Newgate enlarged, with the Fleet Ditch for a
river. The mouth of the latter is as black as the mouth of a cannon. The sable
stream encircles the town like the band of cr*pe round a burglar's hat. There is a
choking feeling of mourning that hangs over the town like a pall, and casts a deep
shadow of borrow on all things. The trees bristle as with bayonets, the sprlog plants
appear no better than spring guns, the very pistils of the flowers seem as if they would
like to shoot at you. The air whistles by one's ear with the hissing sound of a rifle-
ball. The church-hells when they ring must have the jingle of a turnkey's bunch of
keys in them. Yoti may be sure Joy never entered such a town! It would as soon
think of playing at leap-frog with Ma. Humt's 'Scape-goat' on the salt-crusted banks
of the Dead Sea, or giving a juvenile party in a Metropolitan Churchyard 1 Let in run
away from this Bnstille of a capital, or else the bars will be closing in upon us, and we
shall be treated like criminals, or, worse still, like Russians. Such a Vlncennes of a
dungeon has a at military keeper in that monumental man of iron, Alexander!"
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
This is the second article, written by the same unbiassed authority :—
At a party the other evening there were present six young ladies,
attired in the height—or rather width—of fashion, the circumference
of whose united dresses exactly equalled that of Astley's circus. It
was calculated by a Senior Wrangler who attended, that if the material
of which tbe six dresses were composed had been cut into strips of two
inches wide, i', would have reached four times round the dome of
St. Paul's; while the air-tubes with which the skirts were expanded
would, if placed end to end, have very considerably overtopped the
Monument. Some idea may be formed of the labour which the present
mode has rendered necessary, when we state that to fill the air-tubes of
a single dress it takes the most expert lady's maid, upon an average,
upwaids of three hours and a quarter, even with the help of a good-
sized pair of bellows.
ST. PETERSBURG :—AS IT IS AFTER THE WAR.
"Here is a fair light-hearted City! Every window has a sparkle in it, every door
is on the broad grin. It seems steeped in sugar, like a huge twelfth-cake; and what
shall we say of the bright, glittering Neva? Why, it is a broad sheet of silver, that
runs round the twelfth-cake I If the town had been spun to order by a Fairy, there
could not be a lighter touch about it. It shines with a thousand delicate shifting
colours, like a plgeon's-neck, or a monster opal flashing In the sun. Do not breathe, or
else you will blow the fairy bubble away, a bubble that you could swear had been
blown by Titania herself out of the prismat'c spray of a rainhov that had been caught
span-new in Utopia. It is a long-exploded fable about the auriferous paving of London,

THE UNITED JOB AND LAZARUS BANK.
CAPITAL; SAY—ONE MILLION.

rrn a rview to the special
advantage of tbe small and
uncertain capitalist, this
Bank is established. That
distinguished actuary, Mb.
Fitzcocker, has calculated
that the halfpence annually
bestowed in charity within
the Bills of Mortality upon
persona of the Mendicant
Class amounts, on an aver-
age, to no less a sum than
£950,000 14*. 24<*. This
sum does not include the
daily coppers expended upon
crossing-sweepers, that may
fairly be put down in round
figure* at £50,000 more,
sinking the odd halfpence.
Thus, we have a total of
£1,000,000 14*. Ud. Now,
it is well known that the
Mendicant and Crossing-
sweeper class are, for the
most part, a thrifty if not a
penurious people. What is
more common tban to read
of the apprehension or death
of the beggar upon whose
person or body is found
rolls of bank-notes and showers of sovereigns? It is calculated that of
the above £1,000,000 not above one-half is expended by the recipients
for board, clothing, and lodging (leaving a fair margin of expense for
an annual visit to a watering-place.) Thus, a clear half-million is
annually accumulating in old stockings, under worm-eaten floors, and
in all sorts of impossible nooks and corners considered convenient to
Plutus.
Now it is to afford safe and peculiarly profitable means of investment
to the provident classes above named, that The United Job (it is
requested that Job be taken in its purely patriarchal pronunciation)
the United Job and Lazarus Bank is established. The persons most
interested in the successful permanence of the institution, it cannot be
doubted, will feel the fullest and deepest confidence in the character of
the concern, upon a careful perusal of the subjoined names of indi-
viduals too well known to demand another syllable. They speak for

Last year thn youngest flirt of the clan dissolved into skin and bone,
He measured seven five in his socks, but he barely scaled twelve stone,
He lost, as doctors would say, his vis, and, as patients would say, his tone.
One summer morn, 'neath the chesnut shade as he pensively strolled
about,
From a green hill-side he suddenly spied clear water-drops trickling out,
Which seemed to say,—" We're a tonic, my lad, just drink and we'll
make you stout."
At its shrine for months, with a mug in his hand, he was ^ out on his
knees to fall,
And the tonic iron-moulded his frame, till be grew as mighty as Saul,
The secret waxed too big fur his bi east, so he told Sir Benjamin Hall.
That spirited Welshman covered the well, arid madfl it a sacred spot,
And a veteran nymph presides with a glass, who declares she hasn't

When foxes were .free in those Gardens to range, and livery servants
were not.

GRAND FASHIONABLE EXHIBITION.
(From a Fashionable Contemporary^)
In the Allee des Boutiques, which is the" Boulevard des'Italiens of
Baden-Baden, there has been a grand exhibition of Jupons de toutes lev
Nations. The elite of the fashion were present. Tbe day was over-
poweringly hot, but thanks to the large dresses, the judges and jurors
were enabled to perform their arduous duties cornpletely a I'ombre.
For the first time, perhaps, grateful praises were heard io favour of
"the cold shade of the aristocracy,"—at least the female English portion
of it. The prize, we believe, was awarded to the Mabchioness of
A , who beat the Grand Duchesse de S by a full breadth.
The Banquiers, however, rail with great bitterness against the ore-
vailing mode. They declare that a muster of three ladies most effec-
tually blocks up the Salle de Jeu, whilst the addition of a fourth
actually prevents the croupiers wielding with anything like rapidity or
freedom tbeir monster rakes. Tbey represent, with pathetic indignation,
that if a lady stands in front of the gaming-table, she forms an impreg-
nable barricade, that completely sets at defiance the approach of the
most, desperate gamblers. They advocate the appointment of a sump-
tuary censor, who should be stationed at the doors of the Conversation
House with a tremendous pair of shears, and armed with full authority
to clip off the peccant parts of every lady's dress that exceeds a certain
number of yards. The maximum allowed is to be seven French yards
for morning, aud nine for full, dress. Toey maintain that unless tome
such modus operandi is exercised on the modes, ihey might as well shut
up their doors at once, instead of going t hrough the absurd form of
opening them simply to have them barricaded the next minute by
ladies. Tbese gentlemen in their extreme delicacy do not mind, appa-
rently, contemplating the ruin of others, but they have a strong
objection against being made patient spectators of their own. They
conclude tbeir list of grievances by declaring that they must either
close the Kursaal, or else a censor must be appointed. They recommend
to the office a newspaper censor, one who is just fresh from Vienna, as
they say he understands to perfection the free use of the scissors.
THE PROPELLING POWERS THAT BE!
As the child is propelled in a perambulator, so is merit pushed on by
ambition—it all depends upon how it is guided, as to whether it carries
the person safe home, or else drops him in the mud half-way.
Mutual Forbearance.
The Emperor of Russia in his new Manifesto pardons the Poles
compromised in 1831, so that the Poles may return to their country;
but as for returning to the Poles a rouble's worth of their property,
why the Poles must pardon the Emperor.

ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY ASCENT.
"Sib,
"The interest which has lately been excited by narratives of
the ascents of places of remarkable elevation, as Mont Blanc, Mount
Ararat, Primrose Hill, and other localities,' induces me to hasten to
send you an account of an exploit which has just been happily achieved
by two young English travellers in Paris. They, last night, succeeded
in accomplishing the hitherto all but unheard-of feat of scaling the top-
most height of one of the summits of the mountain chain of houses in
the newly-discovered portion of the Rue de Bivoli.
"I will not, Sir. occupy your valuable space with a dissertation upon
the character of the country in which this remarkable chain is situate.
I may mention, however, that its existence among the mountain ranges
of Europe is of comparatively recent date. The singular changes which
have been wrought in this region during the reign of the present
Sovereign of France, are phenomena which have excited the attention
of Europe. A valley of great beauty now extends from the magnificent
Srairies to which the natives have given the not inapplicable title of
llysian Fields, up to the point at which civilisation ceases, and the wild
Hotel de Yille frowns upon a waste of space. This valley is exceed-
ingly fertile, and there are few products which may not be _ obtained
from it by digging into the parte monnaie, while among its wilder pro-
ductions are Zouaves, grisettes, bonnet, gendarmes, gamins, soubrettes,
mouches, and the luxuriant flora of the demi-monde, recently discovered
by that;eminent naturalist, M. Dumas, Ms.
"We reached the Valley de Ilivoli, after a somewhat fatiguing
journey from Boulogne upon the Sea, on Tuesday night, and notwith-
standing our weariness, we determined at once to ascend one of the
highest peaks of the mountain range, from which we had resolved to
see the sun rise. We were confirmed in this determination by disco-
vering from the inhabitants at the foot of thejmountain, that we had no
alternative between taking that course and remaining all night on the
plateau of stone which forms the bottom of the valley. We were
assured that the ascent, though arduous, would be rewarded; that we
should find comforts at the summit; that we should be furnished with
a guide, and the expense would become light in proportion to the rare-
faction of the atmosphere. The mountain we resolved to scale was
fancifully christened by the inhabitants, from its likeness to one of the
inns of the country, the Hotel St. Boboche; and when we arrived, its
foot was bathed in gentle radiance of gas-light, which is one of the
novel phenomena of the region.
"We resolved on leaving our baggage at the bottom of the mountain,
though one of the hardy children of the place begged to be permitted to
carry it up with us. We eat a hearty meal, consisting of articles which
appeared most likely to keep us awake for some hours (and which
did so), namely, saumon aux capres, cold, a mayonnaise, sardines,
frontage de Neutchdtel, a bottle ot Tavel, and some eau de Seltz and
cognac. We then lit two of the cigars of the country, which are
exceedingly bad (except those at one son each) and summoned our
guide. He was a cheerful young fellow, who might have been five and
twenty, but who playfully called himself agaifon, and was dressed in
black, with a white apron. We deemed it our duty to inquire, whether
he was acquainted with the region to which he undertook to guide us?
and we also asked, whether he had a wife or children dependent upon him
for existence P In the patois of the district he replied,'Pas si bete;'
but to re-assure us, he stated,that ladies had penetrated to the extreme
height to which we were going, and had sustained no injury beyond the
loss of not very good tempers. Taking lights, which he furnished to us,
and said we should need, and inscribing our names in a travellers
album, over which the police of the district watch with much care, we
set out, and speedily arrived at the Mat de la Halle. This presented
little worth notice, except traces of the feet of many preceding
travellers.
"Our ascent then began in earnest, and the steps were]so exceed-
ingly slippery that we nearly sustained serious falls. But by clinging
to some wood-work placed beside the pathway, we escaped this
peril, and soon reached the platform called the Entresol, where a view
already presented itself. Paris lay before us in a beautiful map,
which was ooloured with the most pleasing variety of hues. Its various
divisions could be distinctly made out, and the principal objects of
attraction to a stranger, and even the charges for the vehicles necessary
to reach them, could be discerned without difficulty. But we had a
good deal to accomplish, and without pause we struggled upwards to
the Premiere Stage. Here the cocoa-nut tree is found, and we derived
considerable assistance, in climbing, from its fibres, which spread
over the ground, and afforded us a pleasant foothold. Looking down
through a gap, we discovered, at the back of the mountain, an abyss,
of a quadrangular form, at the bottom of which we could Bee a faint
glimmer of light, and curious sounds ascended, to which my companion
and myself were inclined to assign Neptunian rather than volcanic
origin. They reminded us of water escaping from the waste-pipe of a
cistern.
"At the next stage of the ascent a catastrophe nearly occurred.
The pass is tolerably wide, perhaps twelve feet at the level called
Au Seconde.^ Our guide had tarried a little, and we were all together,
when a rushing sound was heard, and he was evidently startled. We
supposed that we had disengaged an avalanche, and our alarm was
naturally excessive, when he whispered 'C'est la Crinoline.' In
another moment, an immense mass, of extreme whiteness, occupied the
whole width of the pass, and appeared to be descending upon us. The
guide hastily dragged us into a recess on one side, and there, crushed
together, we beheld the mass glide past us, detecting, as we fancied,
a delicate perfume. The awful Dody went down the very track we had
taken, and our thankfulness for our preservation iound vent in
exclamations that will occur to every pious mind.
"Henceforth the ascent became one of extreme severity, and the
labour it enforced prevented our making many observations, except
such as would have no interest for the ordinary reader. Vegetation
was manifest at various points of our route, in the form of gerania/and
fuchsia, and of a peculiar odour seldom absent from the fluid in which
greens have been boiled. We perceived no animals, except a wild
white dog, whose hinder parts were divested of hair, and wbo rushed
from a recess and barked hysterically, but eluded all attempts to
capture or even to kick him. At one moment a sound as of the fall,
from step to step, of some metallic body, possibly an aerolite, met the
ear, and it was followed by the continuous plash, as of a small cascade.
This occurred shortly after one of our party had made a false step
backwards, and struck his foot violently against some object which
seemed to give way with the blow. The guide was inclined to refer
the incident to & pied-bain, and if he was right^we met with a rarity in
the physiology of the district.
"Still struggling upwards, we attained the final plateau, and with
gasping breath; stood upon the summit of the Hotel de Boboche. I
confess myself unequal to do justice to the prospect, and the fatigue I
experienced seems to have imparted sympathetic lassitude to my pen.
We agreed to dismiss our guide, and to bivouac for the night Ever-
lasting spring is found in these altitudes, especially in the German
mattrass which is acclimatised here. & A canopy of snow greeted our
eyes, and we threw ourselves down to rest with an eagerness not
entirely vindicated by the result of the saumon aux capres and other
components of our supper. Animal life, in its smallest form, was
present around us, but we ultimately became oblivious of all trouble,
and slept till morning, when, if we did not see the sun rise, we heard
the daughters getting up, and a precious noise they made about it.

DUKES OF THE GREEN TABLE.
These exalted German dignitaries keep open hell and, with a tax
upon the undone, welcome all to ruin. Why not? When dicers of all
countries meet,—
"When rattling bones together fly,
From the four corners of the sky,"—
it is pleasant to know that, at least, the paternal ruler of the
Ducby of Baden mulcts the vice for some governmental virtue; and
if men do now and then shoot themselves, they are not permitted to
leave the world without having first contributed to the enduring good
of the country they have hastily turned their backs upon. Hom-
burg, Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden, Spa, and other similar places sacred to
Fortune in her fickle hour of pasteboard and bones, have a fair sprink-
ling of English at these grim festivities; but whether they can petter
afford to lose, or have more philosophy under misfortune, we will not
inquire: any way, they do not maintain their Continental reputation
for suicide; three-fourths of the English, according to French statists,
invariably killing themselves every recurring November.
However, it is said that the Duke of Baden has resolved to break
up his monopoly of gaming-tables, having been sorely affrighted by a
recent dream; in which His Serene Highness dreamt that, removed to
the Shades, he was introduced to a table of green flames, where he saw
his contemporary Dukes—or rather the skeletons of their Highnesses,
their wan, pinched faces only remaining in the flesh—all ranged for the
desperation of play. The cards flew, and the bones rattled. Rouge was
a glowing coal, and Noir bubbling pitch from the lake of Acheron.
Goblets were passed round, but every goblet seemed to His Serene
Highness the skull of some suicide who had duly contributed to the
table-tax of Baden-Baden. For a time, very sorely was His Serene
Highness afflicted by the sufferings of his brother Sovereigns, all of
whom scorched their bony fingers with the burning Rouge or the boiling
Noir; yet all of them, compelled by some horrible fascination, playing
and howling the more impetuously, the more dismally. For a time,
Baden-Baden remained a pitying spectator. At length, a diabolic
dwarf, with a family likeness to the Knave of Spades, approached
Baden-Baden, faying, "That's for you. Play!" Whereupon the
wretched Duke diicovered (but the reader will be pleased to remember
it waa only a dream) that it was his doom, for ever, and for ever, to-
rattle a red-hot dice-box and still to throw aces!

are your intentions honourable?
\Jir, Punch will give the gentleman's answer when he makes it.
A FABLE FOR A HARD FROST.
Once upon a time, a very foolish Welshman persuaded other Welsh-
men, even more foolish than himself for listening to him, that he was a
hero, and his listeners and good friends nothing better than slaves.
"Follow me," said Taffy, "and you shall all of you be clothed in silk
coats and velvet breeches, and live in a paradisv'of metheglin and leeks."
And the fools followed him.; the hero, however, taking good care of
himself,—followed him, and were shot at, and some of them, it is sad
to think of it, knocked on the head for their pains. Now Taffy was
taken prisoner, was justly tried, and justly condemned. Taffy was to
be banged: yes, in a few hours, as things looked with him, there would
be no more vitality in Taffy than,in a Welsh rabbit. However,
although the scaffold and the beam were up, Taffy was mercifully
spared, and bhipped far across the sea.
Years pass away, Taffy becomes an old roan. "He has grown
wiser, gentler, to let the old man return, if he will, to Taffy-land to
doze out the evening of his life, and then sleep in peace." Such was
the resolution of a soft-hearted Queen; and lo! a pardon was signed
for Taffy; signed and tied to one of the Queen's beautiful carrier
pigeons that breed and coo in the towers of Windsor. The beautiful
pigeon crossed the sea, and alighted on the shoulder of Taffy, then a
slave and a drudge, doing drudge's work. Taffy untied the paper
from the beautiful pigeon, and read his pardon. And what did TAFFr
to the beautiful bird? With melted heart, did he not caress and love
and cherish it for the dear sake of its merciful mistress? No! The
ink ought to turn scarlet that writes down the deed. The ungrateful
Taffy, with his pardon safe in his pocket, wrung the neck of the
beautiful pigeon, and flung it, a dead thing, on the ground.
We have given t his little Fable for a Hard Frost in prose: but, at the
same time, the subject is quite at the service of the Primrose-hill poet,,
and will, we trust, he duly enshrined in verse by Mb. Ebnest Boxes.

COMIC SOLDIERS.
he attention of an illustrious Field-Marshal is
respectfully invited to the following extract
from one of the clever letters of the Times'
special Correspondent at Moscow:—
"The PavlovBky, or regiment of Paul, presents an
appearance which would be grotesque if it were not
imposing. All the men—pray do not laugh—have
cocked noses. Every soldier with a nez retrousst, who
is of the proper height, is sent to this regiment, which
was founded by Paul in one of his eccentric freaks, and
a very determined pug is eligible if it be accompanied
by sunken eyes and high cheek-bones."
Does sot the illustrious Field-Marshal think
that the foreign idea of a snubnosed regiment
nvght not only be adopted, but also improved
upon, in the British service P In addition to
the Royal Snubnoscs we might have the Royal
Squinteyes, or the Royal Carrots: corps re-
spectively composed of men remarkable for
convergent axes of vision and red hair. There
might be a regiment constituted of bowlegged
heroes, denominated the Randies. Another
might consist of subjects distinguished by the
opposite curve of the lower extremities, but
for the reason that knock-kneed people are
what is commonly termed weak upon their
pins; so that a body of such soldiers would be
rather ornamental than useful. In the agri-
cultural districts are to be found numerous
rustics, rejoicing in wide mouths, and greatly
addicted to grinning from ear to ear. Some
of these clowns might be converted into sol-
diers, and embodied in a Regiment under the
name of the Cheshire Cats. Her Majesty's
service might also be augmented by an obese
legion, whereunto the title of the Heavy
Lumber would be suitable—they would serve
well enough as food for powder. A light
brigade of thin men, on the other hand, might
be raised, having the denomination of Lankies, or Spindleshanks,
assigned to them—these fellows might be employed on services where
stouter troops would have less chance of escaping the enemy's rifles.
These fancy regiments might be completed by a division of hunchbacks,
for whom the proper designation would of course be—the Queen's
Own Punches.

A STRETCH OF THE GAME LAWS.
(To the Right Hon. Sir Gbokge Geet, Bart.)
My Dear Grey,
Allow me to call your attention to a remarkable judgment,
pronounced, according to the Manchester Examiner and Times, at
Rotheraro,by a provincial Magistrate. The sentence which I subjoin,
will explain the crime to you :—
r "Mb. Pickabd said the bench did not 1 consider it to be a case of any very great
intent of poaching/ because they knew that in mowing men did sometimes come upon
hares left among the corn; but if it was an accident, the defendants were wrong in not
acknowledging and giving up the hare to the keeper. The bench wished to point out
to labourers that when they killed hares in this way, they must give them up to the
keepers, and they should fine the defendants 6.1. each and costs."
The bench referred to by Mb. Pickard consisted of himself and a
Rev. A. Fullerton. Thus saith the Manchester Examiner and Tims;
so that, unless my Manchester contemporary has been shamefully
hoaxed, or has invented a gross calumny, Justice Shallow had an
assessor in the Rev. Mr. Silence.
I wish, my dear Grey, you would investigate 'this matter, and
ascertain whether Mr. Pickard and Mr. Fullerton have been
atrociously slandered, or ought to be removed from the Commission of
the Peace.
Prom the judgment alleged to have been delivered by Ma. Pickard,
you will perceive that certain persons are declared to have been fined
five shillings and costs for accidentally killing a hare, and not giving
up the dead game to a gamekeeper. Tbere may be a statute providing
a penalty for the non-surrender of accidentally slain hares to game-
keepers independently of all circumstances. If so, what I am about to
say must go for nothing: the judgment was legal, and the law alone
is infamous.
Mr. Pickard is represented, cruelly if incorrectly, as saying that
the bench "did not consider it to be a case of any very great intent of
poaching:" as if an intent to poach could be great or small, or any-
thing more or less than an intent to poach. In talking—if he talked
the nonsen-e ascribed to him—Mr. Pickard could only have meant to
say that his colleague and himself did not consider the defendants
guilty of intentional poaching; that is, considered them not guilty of
poaching.
But now, my dear Sir George, for the circumstances of the case;
for circumstances alter cases in general, and may possibly justify the
refusal to deliver up to a gamekeeper a hare slain by chance-medley.
The defendants in this case—my authority states—were " two young
men of respectable character, named Thomas and Edwin Pepper, sons
of Mrs. Pepper, farmer, Coaley Lane, near Rotherham. The charge
preferred against them by William Broad head, gamekeeper to Earl
Fitzwilliam,—was that of unlawfully killing a hare. Mr. Broadhead
deposed that, on the third instant, whilst the defendants and a man-
servant were mowing in a field of barley, occupied by Mrs. Pepper,
mother of the defendants, a little dog which they nad with them started a
hare in some of the unmown barley; that the mowers then put down
their scythes and, together with some labourers in attendance on them,
surrounded the piece of barley; that Thomas Pepper then entered
the barley, caught, took up, killed, hid, and refused to deliver up the
hare; and when he, William Broadhead, had at last found it,
snatched it away and kept it. The defendants denied every particular
of this statement, except the facts that they were mowing in the field,
and that Thomas Pepper had killed the hare. They said he had
accidentally wounded it in mowing—cut its hind leg and ripped its
side open with the point of his scythe; that he killed it outright to
put it out of its misery; showed it to the keeper on his applying for
it: and only for the reason that he threatened them with legal pro-
ceedings, snatched it out of his bands, in order that they might pro-
duce it before the Magistrates to show how it was killed. This defence
was proved by the evidence of the servant man: and the bench—if their
decision is rightly reported—believed it. They did not consider the
killing of the bare to be "a case of any very great intent of poaching?"
whereas, if they had believed Mr. Broadhead instead of the Peppers,
they must have seen that it was a decided case, not only of intent,
but also of commission of poaching; since, by an abominable law, it is
possible that a farmer may poach upon the very land which he rents.
Thus these men were charged with unlawfully killing a hare,
acquitted of that offence, and punished on another account—namely,
because one of them retained possession of the hare, in order to rebut
perjury, whicb, as the event proved, they had reason to fear.
Observe, my dear Sir George, that Edwin Pepper, in particular,
was fined for merely looking on whilst his brother Thomas seized the
hare and refused to give it up. Both of the Peppers were acquitted
"of any very great intent of poaching;" and it was Thomas, Bingly, who
snatched and withheld the hare. Edwin naturally asked, in astonish-
ment—
"Am I to be fined, Sir, when I never left my place, or interfered in any way, either
when the hare was killed or the keeper came up? I was merely a looker-on.—Mb.
Pickabd. You are both fined 6t. and costs."
The costs augmented the five shillings penalty to upwards of a pound.
One pound is not much—to you and me—but rogues have been banged
for stealing less money, and even now, for theft or cozenage to a much
smaller amount, are liable to a lengthened period of perspiration at the
crank. There is no law to punish dishonest Magistrates in the same
manner, even when they impose unjust fines in an excessive zeal for the
preservation of game, and extreme respect for the person of a noble-
man's gamekeeper. I don't accuse Mr. Pickard and Mr. Fullerton
of such conduct, arising from such motives, because I am not sure that
the affair above detailed is not fictitious. There is a clergyman in the
case, too, and this renders it doubtful in proportion to the celebrity of
Clerical Magistrates for dispensing justice without partiality or pre-
judice. If, however, this scandalous tale is true, although you will be
unable to prevent H. W. Pickard, Esq., from continuing to write him-
self Armigero, you will yet have the power—which you will do well to
exercise—of relieving that gentleman from the duties of coram, and
custalorum, and ratalornm. You will also act judiciously in limiting
the zeal of the Rev. A. Fullerton for the salvation of hares and the
glory of Eakl Fitzwilliam to the sphere of operation afforded by the
bedside and the pulpit. Believe me, my dear Home Secretary, your
ever faithful monitor, • }JC10if;>>.
P.S.—Wouldn't a collection of British County Bench cases make a

MR. OLIVEIRA'S VACATION-TASK.
Mb. Oiavbira has set his mind on procuring the reduction of the
duties on light wines, and, if he lives, will probably effect bis purpose,
unless be is strenuously opposed by those many worthy and wealthy
people of influence, who, able to indulge in every luxury themselves,
and unable to refrain from indulging in any luxury whatever, are accus-
tomed generally to exert all tbe power they possess with a view to
prevent their inferiors in opulence from being demoralized by the least
indulgence which they can by any means withhold from them.
In a spirit of dogged determination to carry his point, and spoil the
British Public with the enjoyment of genuine wine, Me. Oliveiha is
employing his parliamentary holydays in making a tour through the
continental wine-growing districts, in order to collect information in
support of his case: facts and figures with which, in the ensuing
session, he intends to pester the Chancsllor of the .Exchequer, and
the numerous members who hare made up their minds on the question,
and are resolved to pay no sort of attention to any truths, however
important, that he may state, or to any arguments, however leasonable,
that he may advance.
Just for form's sake, however, it will be necessary that Mr. Oli-
veiha's opponents on the question of the wine-duties should set up a
few objections to his proposal for their reduction: against which the
pleas principally to be relied on are the following.
Your Burgundy, your Claret, your Cbabli?, your Sillery, your Mo-
selle, your Johannisberger, your Walpurzheimer, what are they? A
parcel of wishy-washy stuff, rot-viscera, not fit for a Briton to drink.
Your true Englishman loves his Port and his Sherry, his good strong
Ale, his Brown Stout, and Porter, and Half-asd-Half, his Old Tom.
Cream of the Valley, Scotch and Irish Whiskey, Hollands, and Rum,
He will never drink your wretched, thin, sour, French and German
trash!
If you let in light wines cheap, on the other hand, how do you
propose to make good the deficiency of the revenue? Just think
what a gap you will make in the Excise, by diminishing, to a fearful
extent, the consumption of alcoholic drinks and malt liquor. You will
knock up our trade with Oporto, and ruin all the parties concerned in
it. Flooding the market with your Bordeaux and Macon, and stuff, at
the cost of a mere song; see what an amount of capital you will swamp
and destroy—millions invested in Port and Sherry, especially Port.
The idea that any increase of consumption will take place if you let
your light wines in at a lower duty, is a gratuitous assumption, desti-
tute of all probability. Not one bottle more will be consumed in the
United Kingdom than there is at present, and the Customs' reve-
nue will simply be impaired in a proportion which, measured by the
value of the import you ask as to tamper with, must necessarily be
enormous.
Stick to old Port. It is an orthodox wine; and if you afford facili-
ties for the importation of light continental wines, you will also open
a door for the introduction of Popery and Rationalism.
Parliamentary Piecework.
The Bristol friends of F. H. F. Berkeley, Esq., M.P., have pre-
sented that gentleman wit h a testimonial, including a purse of sovereigns,
of the total value of £1,012, for procuring the repeal of Wilson
Patten's vexatious Sunday Beer Bill. This proceeding suggests a
promising modification of the Chartist principle of paying repre-
sentatives. Suppose the wages were made contingent on the work.
Remunerate the member, not by time but by measure. We should
then have good job-work instead of bad, done in Parliament, and no
doubt should be enabled to procure any reform, or beneficial enactment
that we wanted, by paying lor it.
HOW TO LOOK AT THINGS.
One-sides views are sometimes decidedly the best: for instance, if
you are a portrait-painter, and are taking the portrait of a lady who
squints!

that was playing lustily
outside. Rude Boreas was
the essence of politeness
compared to the rudeness
of those brazen gentlemen.
Every Echo, in, round, and
about London, must have
b?en made both deaf and
dumb by the incessant row
that they kept making, and
if Propriety has been fright-
ened from the isle, depend
upon it these murderous
band-itti have been instru-
mental in her departure.
Not only was Music exe-
cuted by them in a manner
which proved that their
ears were closed to the soft
tones of pity, but it was
also put to the most excru-
ciating torture during the execution. It was a perfect St. Bartho-
lomew of harmony, during which Weber, Donizetti, Rossini, Balfe,
and Russell, were ruthlessly dragged by the air through the bars of
their own immortal compositions, and stunned, disfigured beyond all
power of recognition under the hard blows of their breathless assailants.
The landlords of the public-houses are somewhat to blame, for no
sooner did these monsters begin a new overture in XXX., than they
supplied them with the score. Auber or Meyerbeer was all the
same to them, so kng as their memories were refreshed with a fresh
measure of beer. The German Green Baize Bands have been not less
lutty, adding fresh laurels to their baize everywhere. However, it
must be confessed that these disturbers of the peace and quietness of
private (families are less discordant than their fellow-confederates.
Though lagging far behind in the musical march of civilisation, still, their
movements have some little regularity in.them, and they do not throw
such dire confusion into the ranks of society as our English bands do,
by playing so uniformly [out of time, and breaking so pertinaciously
through everything like a tune. The organs murder Bleep with the
same organised hostility, and in the neighbourhood of the Haymarket,
about ten o'clock, the hideous chorus of yells arising from so many
musical murders being all perpetrated at the same time, must be heard
to be fully appreciated. It does not come within our unhappy lot,
fortunately, to record any great novelty in street-music this year. At
one time there was a feeble outbreak in the way of whistles, in con-
sequence of the success of Picco, but the innovation made a sensation
of no great note, as luckily Picco's whistle was a very short-lived one.
The tunes which have made the greatest noise during the last twelve
months, have been the Ratcatcher's Daughter, Annie Laurie, the
serenade from II Trovalore, and the Red, White, and Blue. When-
ever the It alian boys struck up the latter, the policemen always allowed
them indulgently to grind on, as they took the mention of tiie Blue to
he a complimentary allusion to the colour of their own oerulean uniform.
We fancy there has been a slight decrease in the annual hordes of Ethi-
opians, and consequently we lean to the encouraging belief, that our street
musicians are begmriing to put a cleaner face upon their vocation. The
step has still to be taken in the right musical direction, but, with pence
properly strewn in the path of genius, our artists will not be long
before they take it. We hope next year to have it in our power to
comment in favour of our street concerts, both vocal and instrumental,
that there has been, as our lively neighbours would say, "Moins de bruit,
el plus fruit." We want fewer branches of music, bat those branches
to bear more fruit!
RUSSIAN REFINEMENT.
During the late War, it was no uncommon thing to hear after-dinner
orators—when engaged in the discussion of the then prevailing topic
simultaneously with that of an extra bottle—dilate in glowing terms
upon our national refinement, and the contrast it presented to the
barbarism of the Russians. Now, however truthful and unanswerable
that assertion might have seemed to listeners who heard it during
War-time and dessert, there is abundant proof before us now that it
was utterly unfounded. The trut h is, indeed, that in matters of delicacy
Russia is some miles a-hesd of Great—and L'ttle—Britain; as a glance
at this extract from the Times will show. The writer is describing the
carriage of the Empress-Dowager, as it appeared in the Grand Pro-
cession into Moscow:—
"To hide from her the coachman's back,perforce turned towards Tier Majesty's face,
there was an array of little page's who sat outside the coach on the rail with their backs
towards the coacbman'B, and their round visages vis-u-vis to that of the Empress."
Talk of refinement, indeed! is not this the very height of it! Coarse
and untutored savage islanders as we are, we sadly are in need of such
Continental training, as an emollient to our ideas of what is decent,
and a preventive to their being brutish. Henceforth let our Gold and
Silver Sticks, or whoever else be charged with our state coaches and
processions, never be deemed capable of taking office until their
education ha3 been "finished" by a Muscovite. Holy Russia enlighten
us! Now our eyes are opened, we never more shall see a lady driven to
a Drawing Roam, without looking on the coachman's back as being in
fact one of the indelicacies of the season.
Yet may the cynical perhaps remark, that the obnoxious sight was
merely veiled from the Imperial vision; whereas, had the construction
of the carriage been amended—for instance, had Her Majesty but con-
descended to a Hansom—her driver would have ceased to turn his
back upon her, and the array of screening pages might have been dis-
pensed with. But the matter as it stood—that is, the coachman as he
sat—was but part of the great Russian System of the all-pervading
Sham. Throughout their whole Court Circle—from the Czar and
Czabess even to the lowest of officials, ever blinded by a bribe—no one
ever cares for what is going on, before their very eyes sometimes, pro-
vided they can make believe that they don't see it.
A CLEAR WAY AND NO FAVOUR.
Since the gigantic growth of the ladies' dresses, the traffic in the
streets has been considerably impeded. To remedy this inconvenience,
which passes all conception, the Prefect of Paris has determined on the
following regulations. "For the future, the lad'es are to walk on one
side of the street, the gentlemen on the other. The right, as a matter
of graciousness, is to be awarded to the former (though, in the strict
measurement of the truth, they little deserve it), and the left to the
latter. Plates have already been painted with the inscriptions,' Lbs
Dames A Droite,' and 'Les Messieurs a Gauche,' and these are to
be stuck up next week along the Boulevards, and all the large thorough-
fares." We can only regret that some such regulation cannot be
enforced in London ;—at least at Brighton, Hastings, Ramsgate, Lowe-
stofft, Scarborough, and all the principal places where at present
London is.
Travelling Experiences.
There is a much stronger odour in Cologne than the Eau de Cologne,
and that is the odour ot the Town itself. It's only the difference
between Eau de and Odeurf The Cologne Odcur is ten thousand times
more powerful than any Eau de Cologne, and goes much further. The
traveller has the further satisfaction of knowing, that he gets it
veritable, and no mistake about it.—N.B. None is genuine, unless it
makes the Voyageur stamp and sneeze instantly.
Which is the Way to the Bank.?—If it is the British Bank,
you will have to go through Chancery, and when there, it is more than
doubtful if you will be able to see your way clear out of it.
Cases upon Cases Innumerable of Vanity.
Watchmakers areTdecidedly the most conceited of authors, for yon
never take up the works of any watchmaker, but you are sure to find
his name on the frontispiece! It is rarely indeed that a watch, let it
be ever so poor, is published anonymously. There are infinitely more
names registered at Goldsmiths' Hall than ever are "entered at
Stationers' Hall 1"
Irish Topography.
We are told that " Every road leads to Rome," but the schoolmaster
who wrote that curious bit of proverbial geography must have been a
Puseyite. However, we are confident that in Ireland "Every road
leads to Trinity College, Dublin," for we never met with an Irishman
jet who hadn't been there!

PLAY-HOUSE PORTRAITS.

To this end, we begin with
Distinguished morning contem-
porary has consecrattd certain of
its columns to the portraits of the
players of the time. Ttiere they
hang, certainly as fine as paint:
8nd no doubt it was very humane
of our contemporary to devote so
much valuable space to the exhibi-
tion of artists, many of them, we
trust,'unparalleled. It has, how-
ever, imparted great animation to
what is called the dull season, to
have our senses refreshed with tbe
frequent assurance that every actor
is ttie greatest actor; leaving the
comparative greatness to be settled
among themselves. There are,
however, other individuals in the
play-house beside the players: and
be it our put pose, leaving the
artists belonging to the boards
(some appear as though made out
of them) to our gifted contem-
porary, be it our humble task to
draw merit from the box-office, the
pit, and the gallery.
BOSHFORD.
Who knows not Boshford? It is now five-and-twenty years since he
first appeared with a beer-can in the Victoria gallery. Wo sooner does
the act-drop fall, than up rises the voice of Boshford! How cheering
is bis call of " Porter!" how playful his enunciation of" Ginger Beer I
With what marvellous power of fence he puts off the wags of the
gallery! How his eye twinkles and his lip cmves and twists, emulative
of his own corkscrew, as he makes blithe answer to the interrogative
demanding his mother's knowledge of his absence from home! What
a volume of fun in his repartee, touching the inquiry relative to his
hatter!
In private life Boshfobd is deservedly esteemed. No goose-feast in
the neighbourhood of the New Cut is thought complete without him.
He ordinarily takes his gin-and-water cold without, though he.has been
known net to refuse it hot with sugar. In his parish he is much
respected for his humorous disposition, and, the theatre considered,
early hours. As evidence that the greatest punctuality in matters of
business may accompany the highest professional genius, we may state
that Me. Boshford has been a small householder for fifteen years, and
for all that time can produce the periodical receipt for his water-rate.
We shall next week give (he portrait of another distinguished artist,
the melodious gentlewoman who sells apples, oranges, and a bill of the
play in the Surrey pit; to be followed by the hall-keepers of the ot her
metropolitan houses. We are afraid our limits will not admit those
open-air artists who sell bills at the doors.
THE POOR CUllATES' PETITION.
The following petition is about to be presented to the Legislature:—
The Humble Peiilioit of the undersigned being Curates of the
Uniled Church of England and Ireland,
Humbly Showeth,
That, your petitioners are charged with the cure of souls at
stipends of £80 per annum and under.
That these small stipends are all that your petitioners have to subsist
upon. x
That by reason of the smallness of their stipends the subsistence of
your petitioners is very slender, and their persons for the most part are
slender alto. That their bodily raiment, which ought to be simply
black, presents a fertuginous or rusty appearance, and that their stocks
whereof the colour should be pure white, are very generally whity-
brown; forasmuch as tailors' bills cannot be defrayed by jour petition-
ers, and they find washing expensive.
That the acquaintance of your petitioners with beef and mutton is
very slight, and, indeed, that they enjoy an intimacy by no means too
familiar with bread and cheese.
That your petitioners are willing to labour with their own hands, in
order that, without being chargeable to anybody, they may procure for
themselves the necessaries of lie.
That your petitioners are, by existing law, debarred from endea-
vouring to better their unhappy condition by honest industry.
That one of the most eminent among the first predecessors of your
petitioners obtained his living by working at a mechanical trade, he
possessing no living of an ecclesiastical nature, and, in so far, being
resembled by yf ur petitioners.
That, according to the precedent above quoted, your petitioners
i desire to be allowed to eke out their maintenance by manual labour:
so that it shail be lawful for any one of your petitioners, and all other
: clerks in orders, whose stipends shall not exceed a stated sum per
, annum, to exercise the vocation of tailor, shoemaker, carpenter,
plumber and glazier, blacksmith, or any other species of handicraft;
also to dig, plough, drill, harrow, or otherwise work in the fields for
hire; to receive fees for the service of killing pigs, and for ministering
I to the diseases of cattle and domestic animals; to wait at parties, and
I to drive public vehicles: Provided always that no secular employment
shall be exercised by your petitioners, except during the hours of
j leisure permitted by their clerical duties.
"Your petitioners humbly hope that, if by your clemency and com-
passion, they shall be permitted to earn, by journey-work, agricultural
labour, and odd jobs, some little addition to their piesent insufficient
means, they may, what with the wives of such of them as are married
\ taking in washing and keeping a mangle, which any of their husbands,
your petitioners, would be willing to turn, contrive to make both ends
meet, without either any further appeals to charity, or the reduction of
the necessarily ample incomes of the bishops and higher clergy.
And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, and by profession icont,
Kill ever pray.
BAYONETS AND FREE TRADE.
Mb. Cobden has written one of his wise letters (and who can write
upon what he understands more wisely than Mr. Cobden ?) to; the
members of the Brussels Congress, in which he simply but most im-
pressively dwells upon the triumphs of Frre Trade as working in
flourishing England. He further says of Continental Governments,
"The continual augmentation of their military establishments will
compel them to enter upon a reform of their tariffs as the only mode of
enabling their peoples to support the constant increase of their expen-
diture." This news is no less convincing thau good. Thus, let the
Hope of Austria and gaoler of Italy add as he may to his thousands of
turnkeys in regimentals, every new battalion against the liberty of man
is also a battalion in fuitberance of the freedom of trade. If men are
taxed to buy bayonets, it cannot be but they must have their clothes
and food at a cheaper rate. Dear cannon-balls, hear it, oh Manchester!
make cheap cotton.
Charming Simplicity.
The following is an extract from a beautiful naive letter, that has
been confidentially handed to us for inspection:—" A Young Lady
presents her compliments to Captain A. K. N. Tremearne, of the ship
Princess, and if he only would bring home with him next time the
American Sea Serpent, and give it to her to put in her Aquarium, she
would feel tver so much obliged to him, and would not mind giving
him in exchange a dear little duck of a canary that she has, to hang up
in his cabin."
SINGULAR PRESENCE OP MIND.
Last week at one of the numerous fires about London, there was a
Elentiful sunply of water, but, by some accident, a great scarcity of
ose. The flames were gaining tbe mastery every second, when a lady,
who was present, touched by the dilemma, did not hesitate a miuute, but
pulling off her jupon, removed from it the inflated india-rubber tubes,
j which form pirt and rather a considerable parcel of a lady's dress
now-a-days. These tubes, consisting of several yards, were immediately
attached to the engine, and played the impromptu part of hose most
i effectually. The consequence was, the progress of thu ikmes was
arrested, and, ultimately, the building saved. The name of the lady, to
whose presence of miud this fortunate termination was mainly owing,
I is not known; as, after the damage voluntatily inflicted on her dress,
1 she, with a refined delicacy that cannot be too highly praised, instantly
sought refuge in flight Such noble acts need uo comment from
our pen
A Jolly Party.
We are happy to state that an excellent understanding subsists
between a Right Honourable Baronet in the North of England and a
Right Honourable North of England Baronet. In the course of au
oration at tbe Carlisle agricultural dinner, Sib Jakes Graham is
reported to have said:—
"Now, as a Member of Parliament and a Legislator, I can look back with vast
satisfaction to the several measures I have supported."
It is pleasing to find that Sir James Graham is upon such vastly
good terms with Sir James Graham.

THE BRIGANDS' BANK.
a £Hclcoramatic Shrtrfj.
Scene—The Royal Anglo-Saxon Bank. The Bank Parlour. The
Directors Hulksworthy, Takeaway, Pillidge, Hookit, Billy
Bobbins, and Allbone, alias Black Jack, seated at a Table,
whereon are Papers and Writing Materials. Hulksworthy at the
head of the Table, in the Chair. A strong Box before him.
Hulks. It is now seven years since our grand scheme of plunder was
first organized. Time, which overthrows empires and dynasties, at last
decrees the dissolution of our gallant gang, and a few short hours—it
may be minutes, will behold the bubble of the Boyal Anglo-Saxon
Bank burst, even as the bomb-shell which was hurled the other day on
Sebastopol.
Pillidge. And spread—ha—ha!—considerably more havoc round.
Black J. In the mean time, Guv'nor, suppose as how we proceed to
a distribution of the remaining swag.
Fake, (pointing to the Box). Have you got the booty all right there P
Hulks. In this coffer is contained the greater portion of our prey.
The remainder is below, and will be divided immediately on the closure
of the Bank portals.
Billy. Delay is dangerous, as the downy cove says in the copy-book.
Why not cut it short t
Hulks. Advice has been received that a large deposit will be paid in
some time in the course of the day.
Pill. Ay, ay. I twig. We hold open till that arrives.
Hook. Well; in the meantime let us make sure of what we hare got
here.
Hulks. Now, then, to resolve all the shareholders of the concern into
our noble selves {opens Box,' upon which a general rush is made by the
other Directors). Nay, gentlemen, hands off—share and share alike—
remember—honour among Directors of a Bubble Bank! Believe me,
the partition shall be fair and equal. Relax your gripe {they remove
their hands). Every gentleman of us shall receive his due.
Billy (to Black Jack). I hope not. Jack {they advance; the rest
remaining with Hulksworthy at the Table, look on whilst he rummages
the Cash-box). I should rayther not receive what will be generally con-
sidered our due, Jack {imitates the action of a convict in exercise on

Black J. Well, Bill, 1 can't say as I should like that spee'es of ade-
quate remuneration. Nor this here, Bill, neither. [Works an ideal crank.
Billy. Well, Jack, I suppose without bragging we may call our-
selves half-a-dczen of the greatest rogues in England out of quod.
Black J. Ay—or in the stone-jug either, Billy, my brixywixy!
Billy. Our united depredations, Jack, to the best of my calculation,
amounts to upwards of a hundred and thirty thousand pounds.
Black J. I suppose they do, Bill, to that or thereabouts. You see,
Billy, my heddication was summat neglected, and I haven't got the
natural adwantage of a good chalkhead.
Billy. I say, Jack, now we're a going to be thrown upon the wide
world, what a' ye mean to turn your hand.to? Our characters is gone,
Jack; we can't come the old dodge again.
Black J. Picking and stealing in some way or other. I don't see
what else I can do. I'm too clumsjfisted for forgery or picking
pockets. I think I shall take to the burglarious line. What s your
intentions?
Billy. I mean to repent, Jack.
Black J. Repent—ho, ho, ho, ho, bo!
Billy. Don't laugh, Jack. No levity. I'm serious. I mean to
repent, and turn missionary to the Cannibal Islands—no, I mean the
Sandwich—ham sandwich I hope, or beef anyhow. I should make a
capital missionary. I should astonish the natives with psalm-singing.

FACTS FOR PHARISEES.
Why, it may be asked, is a Sabbatarian on a Sunday like a smuggler P
And the answer might be, Because he is a contrabandist. There is,
however, reason to hope that the sincere Sabbatarians will soon per-
ceive the propriety of discontinuing their opposition to Sunday music.
At the recent meeting of the National Sunday League, in St. Martin's
Hall, Mr. R. Brown (Chairman of the Sunday Band Committee)
moved the following resolution:
"That the meeting Is of opinion, that tbe music in the Parks of the Metropolis and
in other townB of the kingdom on Sundays has been productive of much good."
In the report of the meeting we farther read that,
"The speaker gave a short account of the proceedings of the Sunday Band Com-
mittee, and stated that in every town in which bands had been established, their
establishment had been productive of good."
If the Sunday bands play the people out of public-houses, and away
from the haunts of dissipation and vice, they play into the hands of
those who are truly zsalous in the cause of religion and morality. The
Sunday Band Committee would do well to collect facts in proof of the
beneficial workings of their musical reformatory instruments. The
strictest Sabbatarian will admit that it is lawful to do good on the
Sabbath day; and if performances of music on that day are found to be
attended by a general improvement in manners and conduct, he will
perceive that they are supplemental sermons, and will learn to look on
the movements in the various pieces as airs from Heaven, instead of
regarding them in an opposite point of view.
British. Bank Balances.
Among other debtors—gentlemen, all gentlemen, and some directors
—debtors to the Royal Brit ish Bubble, we find the subjoined senatorial
names set against the subjoined sums:—
GREAT HOPES FOR A SMALL PARTY.
It is very generally believed that on the marriage of the Princess
Royal with the Prince op Prussia, the young Prince of Wales is
to go the way of all Princes of Wales, and forthwith to have a house
and household of his own. With 1 he history of the last Prince of
Wales, the Royal George, open before us, we can readily believe that
this intelligence of the early independence of the Royal Albert has
carried hope and comfort to a small party never more in need than at
present of any sort of support and consolation. Under the patronage
of the Heir Apparent and countenanced by his growing authority, there
can be no doubt (at least among themselves) to the small but very
sound Conservative body, that they will again rapidly wax into the
strength and importance of a great party; and thus at. once fulfil one
of the conditions of government so eloquently, nay, more than once so
pathetically, insisted upon^by the accomplished man, once the leader of
the Conservative host.
In return for the patronage and countenance benignly vouchsafed, as
expected, by his Royal Highness, the distinguished men of the party
obliged, will severally and individually devote their peculiar abilities to
tbe service of their youthful master. Nothing less could be expected
of the patriotism of such politicians.
The Earl of D—rby will, of course, not shrink from the responsi-
bility of imparting to his Royal Highness the best advice on all the
varied subjects of life, handled familiarly by his Lordship as his garter.
Under such a preceptor it is reasonably to be hoped that the Royal
mind will be early directed to the manly discipline of the English turf;
the true soil whence the] noblest qualities of the British statesman
flourish even as his country's oaks. A magnificent stud will, of
course, be essential to the dignity of his Boyal Highness; whilst a
free but dignified intercourse with the gentlemen "at the Corner" will
develope his txperience of men and things, (Perhaps nothing more
contributed to the popularity of George the Third than his leather-
breeches and top-boots.) Many a dull day has passed since the day
when a Prince of Wales was seen at Tattersall's; but that day
may be on its speedy return. Of •nurse, the noble Earl will not fail
to impress upon the Royal mind an awful tense of the danger impending
to the British constitution, or what, if possible, is more; to the
Christianity of Christian England, in the threatened admission of the
Jews to Pariiament.
Mr. Spo—ner, in acknowledgment of his services to his party, will,
doubtless, be permitted to read his speeches to His Royal Highness
(who, hitherto, possibly, may not have attended to them) on the
Babylonian wickedness of the Maynooth Grant.
To Mr. D—sr—eli will, we presume, be left the care of delivering
to the Prince a course of constitutional lectures on the national
necessity of the existence of the Conservative party, with Mr.
D—sr—eli, as prime minister, if possible, at the head of it
The Marquis of Gr—nby, from hisproround acquaintance with the
subject, is, of course, pointed out as His Royal Highness's preceptor
in political arithmetic.
Mb. M—ntz, as an independent member, andjust to keep him in
humour, may be permitted by the party to ask His Royal Highness—
"Wrhat is a Pound?" It is, however, to be understood that His
Royal Highness is in no manner expected to make a satisfactory answer
to that perplexing question..
Very sound views are to be expected from Sir John P—kenham;
good specimens of mummified Toryism may also bo looked for from
Thessiger; whilst all official forms will be made as plain as marbles
by the lucid exposition of Mr. Walpole. Indeed, considering the
Conservative party as it stands (if it does stand), looking at it as so
much represented political and social wisdom, we think that the present
Heir Apparent will enjoy advantages from his advisers scarcely known
to his predecessors, Prince Hal and Prince George. As, however,
the last Princk of Wales had his evil tempter in tbe allurements and
brilliancy of Siibridah; so—(we must however give this much credit
to the Earl of D—rby, who does not attempt to disguise the peril)—
so it is to be feared that our Heir Apparent may be too wholly fasci-
nated and subdued by the wit and genius of another literary man;
need we name—Lord Ma—dst—ne?

As these Members of Parliament have shown themselves so ready to
take Bank Thousands, perhaps it will not be too much to expect that
they should as soon as possible accept Chiltern Hundreds.
A Safe Secretary.
The Times, in a scarifying leader on the British Bank robbers, says—
"There was a little safe, and a little book locked with a little key, which Mb.
Cauebon, tbe Secretary ,"Ekept in bis waistcoat-pocket."
We hope that'a law will be found that shall consign a little secretary
to a little safe, to be locked not with a little key, and kept by an officer
of any one of our mansions the best judged as a stone casket for such
a jewel.

THE BLOCKADE OF BICKLEIGH VALE.
E must protest against an
incorrect expression occur-
ring in the subjoined extract
from the Plymouth Journal:—
"The question as to the closing of
paths at Bickleigh, and the closing
of Bickleigh Vale itself, will soon be
brought before the proper tribunal."
The epithet "proper," ap-
plied to the tribunal alluded
i o, is the expression to which
we object; and no doubt our
Plymouth contemporary will,
on consideration, admit that
"appointed " would have been
a better word. Our con-
temporary himself shall show
why. He thus proceeds :—
"Some gentlemen went over the
ground on Monday, and saw sundry
evidences of Sib Masbkt Lopez's
Intention to stop up every path he
ctn. Jn one case he bad built up
and closed a lane from Bickleigh
Down into Bickleigh Koad, but as
this was an enormous grievance to
the Bickleigh people, they them-
selves destroyed the Baronet's wall
... A path leading from Shaugh to Bickleigh Church, saving, it is said, a mile and
a half in the walk, has been closed. Another path to Uooe Meavy has also been
closed; and a third path, also near the Church, has been dosed. In passing through
Bickleigh Vale, the party came to a narrow part where there was a high wall of rock
on one side, and a steep declivity on the other. Here there were stationed two dogs on
one side, and one on the other, to do mischief to errant travellers, or to frighten them
back . . . Sin Mabsgv has a large breeding house for rearing game close to the lodge,
and be seeks to make Bickleigh Vale a cover for what he breeds. This is one of the
secrets, probably, of his desire to keep the public out of the valley."
Right of way is public property.* The question raised by the above-
mentioned closure of paths is, whether Sib Moses Levi, we will say,
to put the case in the abstract, by a change of name, and avoid person-
ality, has wrongfully abstracted that public property or not. This
question will have to be decided by a civil tribunal. That is the
tribunal by law appointed to try it—but we maintain that it is not the
proper one.
What is a petty theft of goods'and chattels, or a little money; what
is burglary, unaccompanied by violence—w hat is the forgery of a small
note, to robbing a whole population of the delights and enjoyments
which gracious Heaven has provided for the recreation and refresh-
ment of their souls in the beauties and wonders which beset their paths
in the fields and the forests, through tbe valleys and meadows, and
over the hills and downs of merry England P To stop those paths; to
deprive one's fellow creatures of those good gifts; to debar large
multitudes of one's neighbours from participation in those blessings for
the small indulgence of one's single self in some petty whim or paltry
hobby, is, even if lawful, odious. It is the conduct of a sordid little con-
temptible creature, whom common speech does not denominate human,
but calls the wretched personification of selfishness—inferior animal.
But when there is a doubt whether the brutality is legal or not, the
doubt is one which ought, in justice, to be decided by the same tribunal
as that which decides whether an individual accused of having taken
that which did not belong to him, is or is not worthy of penal servitude
or exile. If Sib Moses Levi bas stopped certain pathways, and
those pathways are claimed by the public, although the Nisi Priut
Court may be that in which he must be prosecuted according tojaw,
the proper tribunal wherein, if law were equitable, his guilt or inno-
cence would have to be determined, would be that where the party
whose morality is in question stands in a peculiar enclosure.
In contrast with the malevolence which has closed, or attempted to
close, Bickleigh, a correspondent of the journal above quoted places
the benevolence which has provided convenient stiles, and a comfort-
able seat, in a spot commanding a beautiful view of the Sound, appro-
priately called Freedom Field. George Soltau, Esq., is the gentle-
man who has behaved with this liberality. Mb. Soltau is a gentleman.
Mb. Soltau is a public benefactor. The reverse of Mb. Soltau is a
Sublic malefactor. It is to be deplored that a malefactor of that
etcription cannot be called to account before a proper tribunal.
SOCIAL STATISTICS.
The average number of Perambulators that are now daily admitted
to the Parks is 12,256.
Ninety-seven nurstmaids in the neighbourhood of Hackney have left
their situations without giving warning, on the ground that now the
Guards are back, their residence is too remote ftom Kensington
Gardens.
There are living in a Cheltenham boarding-home three maiden ladies,
who are known to have resided there for nearly thirty years; yet whose
united ages, as privately confessed in recent conversation, amount to
1 only 56.
No fewer than three cases have occurred of young ladies who have
been to races having paid their bet*.
Twenty-three policemen in the Xnightsbridge division have applied
for leave to change their beat, on the plea that since the Guards re-
turned they have been reduced more than once to go to bed supperless.
Thirteen married gentlemen, who, within the last week or so, have
been convicted of having smoked in their own dining-rooms, have
been severally fined a new bonnet, and in default, have been committed
to tbe hard labour of taking out their wives for an afternoon's
shopping.
Among the Tower beef-eaters it has been ascertained that there are
nineteen strict vegetarians.
I Out of a hundred bonnets that were sold last week at Brighton, it f
has been ascertained that more than ninety were supplied to ladies who \
had gone in just to choose a bit of ribbon.
In a lodging-house at Ramsgate, lately, balf-a-quarter of lamb, pretty
nearly two-thirds of a 20 lb. ham, two packages of chocolate, a pot of
Dundee marmalade, the remains of a large pigeon-pie which had had
one slice cut out of it, a easeful of Manillas, thirteen lumps of sugar,
half a canister of coffee, and almost the whole of a bottle of French
brandy, were discovered (by the landlady) to have been consumed by
the cat.
Out of upwards of 11,000 English Cabmen it has been discovered
that no less than three have been induced to take the pledge.
THE HAIRDRESSER'S GUIDE TO OPULENCE.
Does any hairdresser desire to make a rapid fortune? If so, let him>
strictly charge his assistants on no account to pester any customer by
soliciting him to putchase Bear's Grease and Circassian Cream, or
Vegetable Extract. Let a prohibition to that effect be posted in his
shop, and published in an advertisement appearing constantly in all
the principal papers. Everybody would resort, for the purpose of
gettinghis hair cut, to an establishment conducted on the non-importunity
principle above recommended, although it might be considerably out of
his way, rather than go to one close at band where he would be
worried by the attempt to encumber him with bottles of fluid which he
would rather not have, and load him with grease-pots which he does
not want. To thrust into a man's hands that which he might, if he
required it, ask for, is a barbarous act, which a judicious hairdresser
would not let his journeymen be guilty of. (The most fragrant pomade
becomes offensive when obtruded upon you under your nose; bear's
grease is unbearable, and assumes the character of bore's grease;
and the bore is a bore of such magnitude that the simply negative
attraction of its non-existence would suffice to procure the party wise
enough to abolish it no end of custom.
Post Obituary Notice.
The remains of the late John O'Connell, Esq., M.P., who, as is
well known, died upon the floor of the House of Commons, a few years
ago, in compliance with the terms of a solemn vow he had made, and in
defence of the liberties of Ireland, were finally deposited, last week, in
the office of the Irieh Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper, where the late
honourable gentleman's body will remain till further notice. The place
was given by the Government.
Another Departure from Town.
The Ornamental Water in St. James's Park has left London. What
watering-place it has run down to, not one of the turncocks; can tell.
However, considering the very foul bed it has for years been lying in,
no one can blame it for changing its lodging. The only wonder is, how
it could have stopped in its present dirty hole so long!
Soft Soap for Soapey.
Palmebston did not answer Sam's last pressing letter. He simply
cut a paragraph out of one of Sam's own clever books, and sent it to
him. The paragraph neatly conveyed the intelligei ce, with a small
speck of hope shining like a diamond at the bottom of it: "The right
of Translation is reserved."
A Most Finished Gentleman—The Chief Commissioner of Works-
is so active and determined that we understand he is generally known
as the "B.-Hall and end-all."

A DESIRABLE VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.
If ever there was a chance of seeing a Policeman in London, it
would be at the present moment, when the streets are so completely
deserted. Anything wearing the shape of a human being would stand
out as boldly as the Sphinx m the Desert; but it would seem as if a
Policeman was nothing short of a Sphinx himself, for his existence
seems to be a downright riddle. We doubt if Billy Black himself, with
all his wondrous facility in guessing impossible conundrums, would
be able to fitid out sncti a riddle as a London Policeman. We pro-
pose that the Admiralty, as Britannia has nothing to do at present
but pick her teeth with her Trident, should fit out an Expedition to go
in Search of a Policeman. And, as we are always recommended "to
set a thief to catch a thief," we further propose that at the head of
this Expedition, to take the command as Admiral of the Blue, there
be appointed a Policeman who has been dismissed from the Force. As
such a commander is likely to be acquainted with all the haunts and
hiding-places of his former companions—and to have at his Berlins'
ends a thorough nautical knowledge of the various bays and creeks in
which these rare crustaceous animals love to disport themselves—there
is some chance of the voyage being crowned with success. Upon
their return, an Admiralty Map of the country explored should be pub-
lished, marking for the benefit of future navigators the localities ot the
best fisheries. But we prophesy that the Expedition will signally fail,
unless some such commander as the one we recommend is appointed.
The principle that should guide the Lords of the Admiralty in their
selection should be "Set a Policeman lo catch a Policeman." A good
clever Ticket-of-Leave man, who had been originally in the Force,
wouldjcombine in his two capacities all the requisite qualifications for
the appointment.
Lord Lucan at Law.
Lord Ltjoan, as a vituperated hero of the Crirma, has entered an
action against the naughty Daily News. More work for the wigs!
Well, some people are never content; still we should have thought
that Lord Lucan, above all men, had had quite enough of horse-hair.

THE MOORS. GRATIFYING-VERY!!
On abbivikg at the bist pakt or touk Shooting, you pind those amiable Tourists, thi Nobbs's, have bien ovbk the Geound
a good deal. As the Bibds are wjld, your sport is not much improved thereby. Nobbs, Junior, may be observed taking
in the "Objects or interest" with his Telescope.
BEES AND BLACK BEETLES.
Grasted that Louis Napoleon has brought back the bees to
France, has he not, as a set-off, a little too much encouraged the black
beetles? Never before did France swarm with such a number of
priests! And truly, trying to be as toleraut as possible, it is difficult to
look in the lumpish, clayey faces of the greater number of these heaven-
minded, heaven-pointing men, and to believe them almost all retined to
spirit. We will not question their devotioD, their moral aliment. But
assuredly, if they have partaken of the milk of Canaan, the milk has
turned to curds-and-whey in niauy of their countenances. But these
men are of the army, the black troops of Louis Napoleon. He ought
to institute a new Order for them—the Order of the Legion of Locusts.
For there can be no doubt that, in the agricultural districts of France,
where the peasantry are mere clods of men, the influence of these swarm-
ing priests works well for Napoleon the Nephew; especially, too, as it
ever adroitly associates him with the lurid glories of Napoleon the
Uncle. But the faithful may lament that it is otherwise in towns.
There, the workmen pride themselves upon the looks of mixed con-
tempt and defiance with which they meet the uneasy glances of the
priests. "Priests may be very useful," S8y these men, " but wby bo
many of them?"
We have already told the story of Our Lady of Boulogne. Told of
the processions and the pilgrimages (by railway) done in her honour.
A pilgrimage by rail would have astounded Peter the Hermit; never-
theless pilgrims came; and pious yourg ladies Bought Boulogne beach
for mementos of the sea, and doubtless, on their return to the station,
presented a cockle-shell to be worn by the stoker in sign and memory
of the pilgrimage performed. Now it so happened that the procession,
thickly smudged with priests, passed from tiie station near a half-built
house. We tell the tale to show what the working-men of France
think of this over-supply, and over-activity of black gowns. Whilst
the priests passed this half-built habitation, irreverent working-hands
within cast down upon the holy men a plentiful offering of sand.
Great, iodeed, was the desecration; instant the search; but, even Our
Lady of Boulogne failed or refused to cause the detection of the culprits.
The wickedness made a great noise: for was it not a fcandal upon
the faith of Boulogne-sur-Mer, already twitted with indifferentism in
the matter of black gowns? The men employed in the house were
visited by the master-builder, and severally questioned upon the
enormity committed. Nothing, however, could be learned of the delin-
quent; save that he was the old, old culprit, Nobody. Whereupon,
the master with a sweet gravity, thus addressed the labourers :—"My
friends, it is very plain that some of you threw this defiling sand down
upon the priests. Now this was wrong; very wrong. For wby, my
friends, should you have used sand, when you had bricks?"
OUR WHISPERING GALLUltr
For all who have arrived at their Ears of Discretion.
He who plays at caustic wit often burns bis fingers.
Don't stretch your legs beyond your carpet.
Tne blind man shouldn't attempt to catch fleas.
A good-natured friend ts often only an enemy in disguise.
The Future blights more reputations than ever it ripens.
A pigmy on a pedestal is only a greater pigmy still.
Get your money ready before getting out ot an Omnibus, and before going into
Chancery.
Superstitions would soon die, if so many old women wouldn't act as nurses .to keep
them alive.
We expend more time, trouble, and expense In conciliating a man we fear than in
obliging one we love.
Tiie prouder the man the more obstinate he is—as the S:ate Carriage is the most
difficult to turn.

PLEASING DELUSION. IN EE THE BOUND HATS.

A BALLAD BY A BISHOP.
With Brass Accompaniment.
Ye clergymen of England,
Who livings hold at ease,
Hot little do you think upon
The troubles of the Sees!
Give ear unto my plaintive lay,
And I '11 engage to show
That a bishop's poor and needy—whom for being rich
and greedy,
Up the stormy Times doth blow—oh! oh! oh! oh!
Chorus expressive of Woe.
'Tis a law rf human nature,
As you all of you must grant,
That of worldly things, the more man has
The more he's sure to want,
Then wonder not that we, on whom
Such fatness men bestow,
Are in heart sick and sore, and in want far, far more
Than you who sit below—oh! oh! oh! oh!
That bishops who have been brought up
Regardless of expense,
In luxury must dine and sup,
Seems merely common sense:
And neither few nor far between
Can be their wants, you know,
When in health and at ease their appet ites incense
For the good things here below—0! O! 0! O!
Then think ye not a bishop '» less
To be envied than be pitied,
Rememb'ring that to meet distress
So little he is fitted.
Nor wonder he for pension wants
Six thousand pounds or t o—
Or I fear in a year, tho' he's lived like a Peer,
On the Parish he would go—o—o—o—Oh!
{Be/rain) On the Parish he would go!
If wealth does not make a man witty, at all events it
blinds others to his stupidi'y.
FASHIONS FOB, OCTOBER.
[From Mr. Punch's own Paris Milliner.]
The yellowing of the leaf is marked by a tendency to colour. As,
however, a sharp contest of colour has ever distinguished barbarian
nations, and as the Emperor of Russia has been recently crowned,
there can be no doubt that the ceremony has brought into the beau
tnonde a spirited, not to say a violent, display of red, blue, crimson,
green, and yellow. Indeed, the prevailing tints would do credit to the
coronation of Hvlequin; if we are ever to enjoy that long-protracted
ceremonial.
The Parisian silks are of a delightfully bold design, and of charmingly
lurid tints. The soie de toreador, manufactured under the patronage of
the Empress Eugenie, is of a delightful pattern; giving in one skirt,
with most inimitable foreshortening, the whole ceremony of a bull-fight.
The ferocity of the bull is really beautiful; and may almost be said to
bellow. Some idea may also be entertained of the condescension of
the divine Eugenie from the fact that the portrait of Dominguez, the
wounded bull-fighter in the service of Her Majesty, has been introduced
into the piece. There can be no doubt that skirts of the soie de
toreador will cause a grand furore during the present season; though
we have heard the chasse de sanglier, or boar-hunt, silk very highly
spoken of. As, however, boars have not yet been patronised by the Em-
press, there can be no doubt that the soie de toreador will bear tbe belle.
Other silks arc exhibiting, ba-red and striped. They are called the
soies a la Cayenne, and are supposed to have been manufactured in
obedience to Imperial orders.
There is nothing new in ball-Hresf es; the same patterns that were
danced in at Moscow being exhibited for the Parisian dame. It is said
that this measure has been imperially resolved upon, in order to exhibit
to the eyes of Europe the close alliance of Russia and France. The
corsage en cceur is very much cut away, evidently to illustrate the
political fact that both countries have made a clean breast of it.
Wre*ths a la Holy Virgin of Russia threaten to turn all heads.
They are composed of Russian laurel*, French violets, and English
hops; tbe laurels, as was to have been expected, lying very thick.
Bonnets are all to be made with an elastic edge; and have increased
in size. We have seen one that would entirely contain a cat's-head
apple. This looks like improvemeut.
Mantles, with no seam, still to illustrate the closeness of the French
alliance, with a border in gold and green of the pattern, a FIsle de
Serpens, have a fine effect; atid are made diplomatically large to cover
anything.
The fashion of sleeves is taking a more decided kind, with a tendency
to the sweeping. This change is also susceptible of a political inter-
pretation.
A new petticoat, the crinoline enfer, has been much admired, and
will, no doubt, be all the rage early in the season. It is made of the
finest tempered steel, and works upon the principle of the iron shutters
so much in vogue in England. The petticoat is, of course, globular, and
may be manufactured ballroom-proof. There is also an improvement on
the article called the jupon aux tubes de vapeur, in which steam may be
generated and let off according to the thermometer.
THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE.
Gratitude lives more in the Future than in the Past. It is fre-
quently a three months' bill, which we draw upon some good-natured
friend, who, we think, ought to oblige us, simply because he has
obliged us before. If the bill is taken up, well and good, we draw
another, and then another; but as soon as one is dishonoured, a reaction
takes place, Gratitude ceases, Invective begins, and, as a matter of
course, Hatred ensues. Take any twenty men who are sworn enemies
of others, and you may be sure that out of the number, eighteen at
least were bosom friends, that have every reason to be grateful to the
person they have quarrelled with. Ingratitude commences the moment
a friend, to whom we are deeply indebted, will no longer allow us to
extend our debt of Gratitude.—The Hermit of the Eaymarket.
Important to Spinsters.—The elastic leather b«l's, now worn
round the waists of ladies, are henceforth to be called " Embracelets.

WHAT IT MUST COME TO.
£ undei stand that the in-
creasing amplitude of ladies'
dresses is creating quite a
panic in the millinery trade,
and that the misti esses of
many of the fashionable
establishments have been
driven more than once to
burnt feathers and the
smelling bo! tie by the state
of agitation into which they
have been thrown. To meet
the requirements of the mode
now prevailing, they have
been already forced to en-
large their business premises
to the fullest practicable
extent; _ but tbe demand
upon their space is becoming
so enormous that it is feared
it will soon be scaicely pos-
sible to meet it. The largest
of their cutting-ont rooms is now found so contracted that the manu-
facture of a single dross in it is attended with some difficulty, and if
the "wide wide world " of Fashion does not soon curtail its skirts, and
adopt a mode more moderate, we shall hear of distressed needlewomen
being driven out, of doors to find sufficient room to work in. Now that
the diameter of a lady in full dress very closely approaches that of a
travelling Circus, it is obvious that no ordinary Bhow-rooms will furnish
space enough to show her its entire expanse: and it would not much
surprise us if the leading West-End milliners were to set on foot a
Private Building Company, to provide themselves with houses of more
suitable dimensions. Indeed, unless some such step as this be taken,
we shall soon be hearing of some enterprising modiste having hired the
Great Globe, or covered in Lords' Cricket Ground as her place of
exhibition.

He may wear the iron around his ankle, whilst the bloated owner of
the chain may be permitted to allure others to their ruin. Would this
be the case, Mr. Pope, were there a stringent law that forbade the
exposure of gold chains on penalty of their confiscation, the proceeds
to be paid into the police poor-box? What finds passing inmates for
Newgate? Temptation. What fills the hulks? Temptation. And
what—we wanted a climax—what urged Mas. Fitztwentystone to
immure herself in a round tower of crinoline, cutting herself off from all
her connections? Why, temptation. Mrs. P. saw the abomination
in the shop-window, and she became a she-hermit in horse-hair. And
we again ask, could this have been but for temptation?
We pride ourselves that, being very successful in this life, we possess
an affectionate circle of friends, at whose houses Mr. Punch when he
will condescend to visit, is an admired, an honoured guest. Never-
theless, we want to know, wherefore should our honesty undergo these
repeated ordeals? Why should Tomiuns (Tomkins gives good wine, but
is a little ostentatious)—why should he leave under our nose that gold
snuff-box set with diamonds, given by Peter the Great to the ances-
tral Tomkins who first introduced toothpicks into Russia? Why
should we be left alone in Sum! bus's library with his medals and his
coins, and his cameos? Why is our virtue to be thus insulted? Don't
talk to as of moral restraint. We have often struggled with tempta-
| tion; and could, if we chose, show bruises from more than one fall.
We therefore agree with Mb. Pope, when he says :—
*' Vice is a mater of such hideous mien,
That to be hated Deeds but to be Been,
But seen too olt, familiar with its f
TEMPTATION v. TEETOTALISM.
Mr. Samuel Pope has preached a long letter at Lord Stanley,
and Lord Stanley ha* delivered a long answer in return. Pope, at
the secretary of the United Kingdom Alliance, desires to make it a
penal offence to brtw, distil, import and sell beer, pale ale, gin, wines,
rum, brandy, &c.; all sinful people caught in the fact being liable to
fine, trt&dmill, transportation, and whatever other punishment the
wisdom and benevolence of the Legislature may invent. Now Lord
Stanley, as a ready-primed philosopher who, standing upon one leg,
can deliver himself upon any subject from pease-pudding to psrpetual
motion—Loud Stanley makes answer and declares, that what Pope
desires will <>ot, and cannot be. Upon this, his Lordship, as member
for Lyme-Regis, and ready-primed philosopher upon all points, is
willing to rest bis still-increasing reputation as a public man; a
reputation that, like the showman's nondescript, increases six inches
every year, and still threatens never to come to its full growth. Pope,
however, is not to be put down. Pope says: "So long as temptation
exists, certain results always have, and always must follow." Mr.
Pope would, therefore, destroy the temptation of drink, that thereby
leaving nothing to the uncertainty of moral influence, be might
destroy the drunkard. There is great wisdom in what Mr. Pope
sajs with respect to temptation. We are all, more or less, victims
to it. And therefore, mistrusting moral power, let us destroy temp-
tation. Then, most beautiful, because most perfect, would be all human
society!
for instance. Were there no bonnet-shops, no silk-mercers, how
many a husband would still have cause to "rtjoice in the wife of his
youth?" and how maDy a wife would in a little while wonder that she
conld have ever frit the least desire for anything beyond a Dunstable
straw or a Manchester cotton?
Is it not shameful, too, that in the halls and passages of city taverns
turtle are suffered to lie upon their backs, tempting alderman and
common couiicilman with the cost (to s»y nothing of supervening gout)
of calipee and calipash, when, without such aggravating self-exposure
on the part of the turtle aforesaid, the worthy gentlemen would content
themselves with mutton-broth, or, to admit the wildest possibility, with
ox-tail?
Again, why should bloated wealth dare to mock the necessities of
starveling virtue by crossing its modest path with a chain of red, red
gold blazing in the sun, and insulting want with the heartlessness of its
splendour? Do not talk to us about the moral check of honesty. In a
wild moment of temptation, the victim of penury makes a snatch at that
chain. Well, haply, similarly tempted, he has snatched before, and
the poor creature is condemned to the durance of a long seven years.
Mb. Pope, however, knows the rest: we "embrace" of course.
But could we embrace, if Vice were not before us? We should hug
nothing better and nothing woree than empty ajr. Therefore, because
it is so very easy, destroy the temptation of the vice. Could young
Bricks have ever accepted those deuced bills for Captain Tipps, but
for tbe existence of bill-stamps? Why, no. The argument is conclusive.
Straightway abolish stamps, and without a moment's warning to the
clerks, pull down Somerset House.

"Run, Bill—Run akd bring Hisabellir!—Hebe's a
Chimley A-Fi-er!!"
PLEASURE-TRAINS OF THOUGHT.
The kind, generous souls, who ate rough and almost insulting in
their manners, are like the rich man, who, when solicited to relieve
his poor relations, used to fling his old clothes at them, taking good
care first to seorete money in the pockets.
Happy the mortals, whose building is restricted to Castles in the
Air—for they know not the bother, when once the bricklayers have
got into the house, of getting them out again!
If it were not for the livery, many a master would be taken for bis
own servant!
Aristocracy on the Kail.
Lord D'Eresby, on the Crieff Junction Railway, gave a few days
since a taste of his quality as engine-driver, "performing the up and
down journey within the appointed time." I t is said that, at an early
day, on the Great Western, tbe Bishop op Exeter will try his hand as
a stoker. Recollecting his old talent for stirring coals, there can be no
doubt of his success.

HUMBUG IN HIGH LIFE.
What class of readers can that be to which is addressed the
subjoined advertisement P—
PROGNOSTIC ASTRONOMY.—E. Procter, 2, Waterloo Road, two
doora from the Westminster Road, Dear the obelisk, begs to inform his friend*) and
the public in general he stUl continues to Give Advick to those ladies and gentlemen
who may farour him with tbe time of their birth. £. P., the only person in the
autumn of 1853, who, in contradiction to the then writers of that period, having written
the tieniture of tbe French Emperor, and transmitted the same to his Msjetrfy In the
November of that year, wherein he strenuously denied tbe erroneous statements that
had been put forth respecting hnl Majesty's overthrow, which, according to their
assertions, was to have taken place In 1864. £. P. not only spoke of his then quickly
becoming Empkror, but also described his Lady Empress, tbe time of his msnisge,
that she would have issue, and thereby found a dynasty, &c. &c. All letters prepaid.
The class of natural and uneducated fools, one would think, is that
for whose deception the foregoing example of ungrammatical falsehood
is calculated. It appeared, however, in a paper chiefly read by the
c:as es called superior—in the Morning Post. The circumstance that,
before reaching the breakfast-table, our fashionable contemporary has
very generally to undergo perusal in the seivants'-hall and the kitchen,
may perhsp» account for the insertion of the above-quoted humbug in
its advertising columns. However, there is, possibly, euough folly and
credulity in the world of fashion to supply an astrological impostor with
a remunerative number of dupes. Mb. Dove, who was hanged the
other day, was a bsliever in wizard Harrison; there may be a con-
siderable flock of birds of the same feather as Dove, among the British
aristocracy—bird's of the pigeon tribe. "Superstition in the uintteenth
century," exemplified by rustics iu consulting witches, can hardly be
surprising, when a fellow advertises himself as a fortune-teller in a
London daily paper. We wonder, if a policeman in plaia clothes were
to call on our friend the Astrologer of the Waterloo Road, whether
that sage would discover who his visitor was, and would divine that the
gentleman in question had authority to apprehend bim with a view to
his committal by a Magistrate to tlie House of Correction as a rogue
and vagabond?

THE BURGLAR AND THE BANK DIRECTOR.
A Dialogue oe 1856.
Burglar. I Cracked a crib some years ago—the crushers came and
J, Sir,
Vos tent my fate to undergo and study Botany, Sir.
Bank Director. You stole—your doom is just enough for fellows of
low station,
Who know not how the law to " do" by cool "appropriation."
Burglar. I come back unto England's shore—if vork I gets to do, Sir,
Some day 1 find a crusher's been and told 'em all he knew, Sir;
So 1 must crack a crib aga<n and bring myself to grief, Sir,
And honest try to be in rain—'cos I have been a thief, Sir.
Bank Director. Well—you 're but served as you've deserved—low
fellows here, like you, man,
Have not the genius we require our shareholders to do, man;
Besides John Bull is always dull—the public always slow are,
To appreciate the genius of a centre-bit and crow-bar.
Now if you wrote yourself " Esquire, M.P." unto your name, man,
You'd turn up Fortune's " lucky pea" at my financial game, man,
Yon'd get yourself appointed booh a Joint-Siock-Bank-Director—
Burglar. Oh! crikey, vot a "sell" 'twould be for "plain-clothes,"
or Inspector!
Bank Director. There—hold your tongue—we'll just suppose that
you 're on some Direction,
Established by the shareholders for mutual protection—
Suppose you re short—you get a loan—as much as you can carry
Of the moneys of confiding Dick, and Jack and Tom and. Harry."
The burglar sighed—" You is a swell—hut I'm a common feller,
Vot '8 only fit to 'ide his 'ead in some Vitechapel cellar;
I envies you, my noble swell—vot pulls must coves like you get,
Vot never has' a twelvemonth vith'—nor snocze an hour in Newgate!"
A BONNET TO DEFY THE LONDON BLACKS!
We see that there are Ladies' bonnets, which are made of Leather!
They will be so far convenient, because a wife will then be able to put
her bonnet outside the door overnight, so that it may be blacked with
her husband's boots early the next morning. We fancy we hear a
domestic-minded lady calling over the bannisters :—" Come. Jane, pray
make haste! Good gracious me, haven't you cleaned my bonnet yet t
Bring me up the brushes and the blacking-bottle, girl, and I will give
it a polish myself." However, there may be one drawback ; for, whereas
at present the usual female average for putting on a bonnet is (accord-
ing to their own calculations) "only five minutes," a lady may, if her
chopeau de cuir bas to be tired, require at least Ten. And we all know,
that " ten minutes," in a lady's computation of Time, is the synonym for
half-an-hour. The Rule of Measurement inns thus :—
Five Minutes {with a Lady) ir em
Tm Minutes „ „
Not above Fifteen „ *

SHAMEFUL HOAX-AN ASSASSIN WANTED.
In certain of our contemporaries, a letter has appeared under the
venerable and honoured name of Walter Savage Landor. This
letter is no other than an advertisement for an assassin; and we
should think the work of somebody in the pay of Bomba. We give the
following extract:—
"At the present time [Mr. Landob is made to say] I have only one hundred
pounds of ready money at my disposal, and am never likely to have so much in future.
Of this I transmit five to you, toward ' the acquisition of 10,000 musket?, to be given
to the first Italian province which shall rise.' The remaining £95 I reserve for the
family of the first patriot who asserts the dignity and performs the duty of tyrannicide."
Imagine a Brutus on hire for £95! A reward thould be instantly
offered for the discovery and conviction of this libeller of Walter
Savage Landoe, whose genius and whose years ought alike to make
him sacred from the grim waggery of the stiletto.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SONG OF THE BELL."
(Respectfully Dedicated to the Board of Work*, and the O/iost of Schtli.ee.)—" M.P.'s voco: Vulliamy ango: Tympana fraiigo."
From the foundry-walls of Norton,
To West Hartlepool's dock-quay,
Safely, thanks to favouring fortune,
The Great Bell has found its way.
With lusty British cheers
Sling it to the sliears—
On Messrs. Wabneb be our benison,
Not forgetting £. B. Denison.
While on the shears the Bell they 're slinging,
To hoist the billy-boy a-board,_
We'll leave it, for a moment, swingiEg,
For Mr. Punch's earnest word:
Through Vulliamy's and WniTEHUHBT's
grumbles,
Official letters' dreary load,
Through Aibey's tiff* and Barry's stumbles,
We've got it thus far on its road; .
Bat ere it reaches Bridge Street corner,
To Mr. Punch it seemeth well,
That as the Bell's been cast by Warmer,
Its tale of warning it should tell.
Smartly now clap on the tackle,
With a heave-oh, hoist amain.
On honest hemp and iron shackle,
Lay good muscle's sturdy strain:
The billy-boy, below,
Is "The Wave," that's apropos:
The Bell will rest aboard the Wave,
Or else beneath it find a grave.
Ever since famous 'forty-eight,
The clock, whose tongue this Bell will prove,
Has been a grave affair of state,
For some four Boards of Works to move:
What Seymour without Mannebe planned,
Bland Manners left, scarce well begun;
Unfinished it left Molesworth's hand,
And Hall took up the work undone;
If what their rate of making's been,
Clocks by their rate of going show,
The clock at Westminster, I ween,
Will tarn out marvellously slow.
Now pause, my gallant dock-yard mates,
i'ause. billy-boy's perspiring crew;
In foaming cans the strong beer wait;,
To help you to pull through;
Wipe the sweat from your brows,
And take a jolly bouse,
There is no need yourselves to worry:
Government's never in a hurry.
Four Boards of Works, with literal mind,
Have done the Parliament's command,
That London, Greenwich time might Had,
At Westminster a clock should stand.
To wait Whitehall's official will,
Tne order for the clock was sent,
There it hath stood, and standeth still,
In spite of Denison and Dent:
"Till Barry's tower he planned," quoth Dzxt,
"To make the clock's beyond my p
Quoth Barry, "Till Dent's clock be
Impossible to plan my tower."
And now, my lad?, the grateful froth
From beard and lio 'tis time to wipe;
To work again: yet 'twere no sloth,
To pause and smoke the mid-day
The Board of Works its face
Sets against over-pace:
Where there's been so much time to
An hour is neither here nor there.
'Twere long to tell what huffs and quarrels
Gathered about the hapless job;
How Vulliamy impugned Dent's morals,
And Dent called Vulliaxt "snob."
How when, in spite of row and wrangle,
The casting of the clock was o'er,
About the bells they came to jan
In louder discord than before.
If of the clamour that attended
Upon their birth bells aught can know,
Westminster's Bells, however blended,
Will never ring in tune, I know.
The tenor will, in airy tones,
Proclaim that Denison is rude;
While the bass tells the Bridge street stones,
How Greenwich ventured to intrude.
But on one theme in time they'll ring,
And England in that tune will join,
That Boards of Works are not the thing
For aught but waiting time and coin.
Whate'er the peals those bells may sound,
Triples, bobs, cators, grandsires—none,
But to this burden will come round,
"Cir— com—lo— cu—ti—on."
Those Bells should in red tape be slung,
And when the time they show,
As over Parliament they 're swung,
'Twere well they should be slow;
That English ears may read this fact
In their retarded chime,
That Parliament, in thought and act,
Is sore behind the time.
And now that you have floored your liquor,
And blown the fragrant cloud,
To work, yet lustier and quicker.
Heave oh, on sheave and shroud:
Yet hold—a moment's rest
Ere to the Wave's dark breast
We
give the Bell—Hold hard and listen,
'bile the metallic bulk we christen.
What shall we call the Monster Bell,
That from Westminster tower—
While its three lesser comrades tell
The quarters—strikes the hour?
Titles from Saint or Saladin,
By priests of old to their peals were given;
But to christen Westminster Bells were sin
After hero on earth or Stint in Heaven.
In Rouen tower George d'Amboise rings,
Holand hangs high in the belfry at Bruges/
In Lincoln minster and Christchurch swings,
A mighty Tom, with a clapper hugeous.
While the tower they hang in looketh down
From a Parliament-house of prate and prattle,
On the sottishness, stench and squalor that
drown
Human beings pent closer and fouler than
cattle.
While their hours are chimed with the drunken
jest.
The ruffian's curse, and the wife's shrill
screaming:
Wnile they mark but days of toil unblest,
Nights of theft and riot and fevered dreaming;
For the bells that ring in with Parliament cheers,
'What name speaks enough of brazen and
hollow,
Of empty words in idle ears,
Of professions on which n<
follow?
Shall we christen the bass from c
ally.
Or the Kaiser, whom our statesmen deb'ght
so to honour?
And the treble from some of the Barnacle
fry,
Who oblige old England by living upon her?
Better than such names no names at all:
Yet no ground for nobler Punch discovers.
Let the Bell hang anonymous under the pall
Of smoke and sin that o'er Westminster
hovers.
Heave oh! up swings the mass of metal,
Hold on, good shears—they swerve—they
strain—
They bend—down by the run they rattle-
Bang, clang, the Bell comes down amain!
T)own with the foremost crashing,
Into the Wave's hold smashing.
The timbers yield—od-rot 'em—
And the Bell lies sunk to the bottom!
Amen—sicjiuit— fitly and well,
The Government essay at shipping the Bell!
COUNTRY VISITORS.
The Ducks and Aquatic Birds of St. James's Park btc at present on
a flying visit to a few of their friends and relations in the country.
Some are gaily disporting themselves at the charming little watering-
place Sir William Hooker has in the Kew Gardens, whilst others
■my be seen daily joining in the festive circle that is assembled usually
of an afternoon in the circular basin opposite Kensington Palace. They
are entertained with an unvarying round of hospitalities, and even little
children, that cm scarcely "toddle" yet, delight in crowding round
them, and showering upon their crested heads the crumbs of their
open-handed affection. All the visitors are, we rejoice to state, in
first-rate feather, and are evidently deriving the greatest benefit as well
as enjoyment from their rural trip. They by no means appear so black
aa when they were in London. Their plumage is infinitely brighter,
and, as there is a narked change in their appearance every week, it is
extremely doubtful whether they will be recognised as the same birds
that less than a month ago left our murky Metropolis. In fact, it is
said that some of them have so wonderfully improved since they have
been billing and Kewing in the country, that birds, who went away
from the Ornamental Water in the sable raiment of Crows, will actually
come back in the spotless garments of Doves.
Others have altered so much for the better, that on their return to
their. loved, and no longer muddy inclosure, their dear "ducks of
mothers" will certainly not know them again. There are but few
hopes of these fugitive birds returning to Town much befoie the regular
London season. In truth, the extensive alterations that are at present

'HAVE FAITH IN ONE ANOTHER/
(With the Reasons tchy you should.)
Have faith in one another.
And whate'er yon're told, believe;
Man but seldom does his brother,
There are few whose tongues deceive;
Wi'b but very little humbug
Has the oldest stager met;
Have faith in one another,
And you '11 find it answer yet.
Have faith in one another,
When an article you buy;
It is seldom that a dealer
Will delude you by a lie.
What is called adulteration
You will find extremely rare.
Have but faith in one another,
And examine not the ware.
Have faith iu one another,
Black and white no promise need?,
If there's some demand for parchment,
'Tis for drums and not for deede.
Lend to all that seek to borrow—
With security away!
And have faith in one another—
Tis the rule with man to pay.
Have faith in one another—
Clerk with cash but seldom flees;
And we know funds scarcely ever
Are embezzled by trustees.
Oh! believe not in the treadmill,
And depend not on the crank;
Have faith in one another,
And put money in your bank.
THE QUESTION TOR SLAVEOWNERS.
Abb niggers in Creation's plan,
Part of the family of Man?
Or are they but the kind of apes
Most like us in their ways and
shapes P
My Southern friends, I have about
This point a very serious doubt,
I am not joking in the least
When asking—Is a Black a beast?
I find you are prepared to fight
Of keeping niggers for the right.
As you would for the right to keep
Horses and oxen, pigs and sheep.
All this is well, if 'tis the case
That niggers are a bestial race;
They are your cattle, herd, or flock,
And you '11 do battle for your stock.
Nay, wherefore not your niggers eat,
If they make palatable meat P
Which question there's no reason
why,
If they are brutes, you should not
try.
That brutes they are, feel sure you
must,
So ready as you are to trust
That Heaven, the just cause that
defends,
Will fight with you, my Southern
friends.
This confidence of yours is such
That it my faith shakes very much,
And renders me to doubt inclined,
If they 're a portion of mankind.
You know, if human beings true,
That they 've the self-same rights
as you,
The rigat, if Might sole Right you
uiHke,
Their freedom, if they can, to take.
If Justice reigns, you know you
brave
Its power, in holding Man your
slave;
You k'ck against the eternal laws,
Eie doing which, you'd surely
pause.
You know that, if those laws you
spurn,
They '11 certainly your kicks return;
They will be even with you yet:
And what a kicking you will get!
Dealing with niggers as you deal,
You to that fiat, then, appeal,
By which o'er animals Mm rules:
Or else you must be wretched fools.
Unless our consciences deceive,
And all is false that we believe,
And no eternal laws exist,
And Wisdom is an Atheist.
Curiosities at Moscow.
The Newspapers kindly inform us that Sir Robert Fuel has
taken with him to Moscow "a dog-cart and his smallest tiger."
We may ask whether, in addition to the smallest tiger, Sir Robert
has not also honoured the city with the presence of the Smallest
Lion?
A BANK OE CHARACTER.
Credit, respectability, reputation, rank, and religions exterior
having been proved to be no pledges for the probity of Bankers, the
public have become very anxious to be informed of some criterion, by
which they may be assured of the trustworthiness of persons to whose
keeping they intrust the whole, or most, of their money.
Since the grounds of confidence in Bankers above enumerated are
not to be depended upon, the gentleman in search of a Banker is re-
duced, by a process of exhaustion, to resort, for guidance in his mo-
mentous inquiry, to physiognomical indications; but of these the only
scientific basis is the system of Phrenology.
This consideration has suggested the formation of a new Joint Stock
Bank; to be entitled the Phrenological Banking Company; the Direc-
tion to consist of individnals whose Heads are all highly developed in
the moral and intellectual regions. No doubt can be entertained of the
soundness of the principles on which a Bank would be conducted by
gentlemen of fine heads laying their heads together.
Cists of the Heads of the Directors and other Officers of the Bank
will be exhibited for public inspection in the Bank windows facing the
street, and another set of them will be on view within, open, on appli-
cation to all parties desirous of taking shares in, or depositing money
with, the Company.
As most persons are imperfectly acquainted with practical Phrenology,
in order to facilitate the examination of the Developments of the
Directors, casts of the heads of Bishop, Williams, Rush, Palmer,
and other villains, will be placed in juxtaposition with them, for the
take of contrast. The criminal heads will include those of the Bankers
lately convicted, and, if procurable, those also of the Directors who
have eluded Justice.
The Casts of the Heads of the Directors of this Bank will be pub-
lished, and kept on sale at all the principal image-shops, and at the
Rank itself. It is submitted that this provision for the publicity of
the constitution of the establishment will be far more satisfactory than
any ordinary advertisement of the Heads of a Banking Association.
It cannot have escaped the notice of many persons, that Bankers are
very generally bald. This fact looks almost like a provision of Nature
for assisting observation so extremely important as that of the moral
organization of a Banker; and it is worthy of remark that "Con-
scientiousness" and all the other organs of the virtues are seated at
the crown of the brad. Pecuniary particulars will be announced when
a certain number of subscribers shall have come forward. All that can
he precisely stated at present concerning the resources of the Company
is, that it is composed of Capitalists witn capital Heads.

"Dear Sir, Temple, October 6M.
"I have been in Trance for a month, as you are aware,*

that my sanatory object might not be interfered with by any incessant

at night, and at intervals of leisure, upon the accumulated heap of

ANOTHER PAPAL AGGRESSION!
We have to announce the alarming fact of another Papal Aggression.
The Pope concerned therein, however, is not Pius, but Samuel.
This Pope, by Christian name Saitohl, is the Honorary Secretary of a
Society calling itself the "United Kingdom Alliance," which has set
on foot an agitation for the suppression of the liquor traffic; and
his Holiness the teetotal Pope has been trying to seduce Lobd
Stanley, who declines to become a pervert. Of all Popery, that
which threatens to " rob a poor man of his beer," is the most objection-
able and rutet atrociously subversive of the liberty of the British
subject. If there were any fear that the Legislature would ever be
induced to enact a Maine Law, depriving the sober majority of a
comfort, in order that the blessing may not be abused by the I
minority of sots, a cry of No Popery would be raised through- j
out the kingdom infinitely louder than even tbat which was oc-
casioned by Guy Fawkbs; and we should see Me. Samuel Pope
blazing everywhere in effigy. But the-sound Protestantism and com-
mon sense of thti nation enable us to laugh at the idle machinations of
Sakuel-Popeby. Everybody knows that between this present Papal
Aggression and that of this time six years, there is one important
difference. There was at least one Wiseman engaged in the former,
whereas the parties to the latter are all of them fools.
Repentance is a Tribunal at which one moment the same person
stands as the Culprit, and the next sits as the Judge—and the Judge,
though he invariably condemns the prisoner, mostly always lets him off i
upon the fnvourite French plea of "des cireonstances atlenuanles."

POOR LAW GUARDIAN ANGELS.
A Common subject of lamentation with grumblers is the selfishness
and lack of charity which they assert to characterise tbe present age.
But what truth can there be in this assertion, when the Guardians of a
Parish Union actually put forth the advertisement whereof the following
is a portion:—
BROMYARD UNION. RELIEVING OFFICER WANTED.
THE Board of Guardians are desirous of receiving APPLICATIONS
from'Persons competent and willing to perform the duties of RELIEVING
OFFICER of tbe Second District of this Union; comprising the parishes of Acton
Beauchemp, Avenbury, Much Cowarne, Cradley, Evesbatch, Felton. Bishop's Frome,
Moreton Jefferiep, Ocle Pitchard, Stanford Bishop. Stoke Lacy, and Uilingswick; and
containing an area of 27,104 Acres; at a Salary of £52 per annum.
Tbe Officer will be required to reside in such central part of the District as shall be
fixed by the Guardians, to keep a horse or pony, and devote the whole of his time to
the duties of his office, not following any other kind of business; and to be prepared
to enter upon bia duties on the 25th day of March next.
In this advertisement it is assumed that applications will probably be
made by several parties for a situation, the duties of which will absorb
the whole time of its occupant, will consist, simply, in the distribution
of alms, and will be unremunerated. A salary of £52 per annum, to
be sure, is offered to the relieving officer, but then he will be obliged
to keep a horse, which will cost him nearly a pound a-week, so that the
£52 must be intended for the maintenance of the quadruped, leaving
perhaps a small surplus for contingent veterinary expenses. Who are
tbe clergy about Bromyard P The names of these apostles and evan-
gelists ought to be known: they have been preaching to some purpose:
they have evidently produced a state of things in that neighbourhood
identical with primitive Christianity. In the blest region of Brom-
yard it is evidently looked upon as a likely thing, that there will be
plenty of competitors for the place of gratuitous almoner, willing to
devote their entire lives, without earthly consideration, to the dis-
pensation of benevolence to their fellow-creatures. In that angelic
ministration, we suppose, the Guardians of the Bromyard Union expect
that their Relieving Officer will distribute not only the ample funds
which they intrust to him, but likewise all the odd cash that he may
have of his own, after the deduction of his personal charges from his
private income.
A Proverb Picked to Pieces.
We are told that" When Poverty enters by the door, Love flies
out of the window." This mieht have been the case years ago, bat in
this money-making age we think that it occurs just as often, if not
oftener, that "Love flies in at the window, whilst Poverty is shown the
door."

THE AMERICAN BALLADS.
NLY give me the making of
the laws of England, and I do
not care who makes its ballads.
Such is Mr. Punch's adaptation
of a foolish saying, with which
donkeys who are going to prose
about verse invariably begin
their nonsense. But, though
he does not in the least care
who makes the ballads, pro-
vided they are good ones, or,
in the other alternative, pro-
vided they are not sung under
his windows, he does not deem
it beneath bis dignity occasion-
ally to make an observation
upon the character of the
popular compositions of the
day. The music - publishers
grow frightfully proud when
he does so, and instantly quote
his opinion in a legion of adver-
tisements, but this is an incon-
venience to which all great
folks are subject.
At this moment there is no
song of English origin which
is commanding the sympathies
of the public so strongly as
certain imported melodies. The
American poets have supplied
us with some lyrics which now
entrance the British public. At
a dozen theatres, every night,
one or other of these efforts of
the Trans-Atlantic muse is
thrilling the audiences, and
eliciting the most enormous
shouts of applause. For the
instruction of those who do not go to theatres, and to efface the unfair impression that
entertainments of an unintellectual character will sometimes satisfy the requirements of those
who do, Mr. Punch begs to offer a brief analysis of the three songs which have now undis-
puted possession of the metropolitan mind, and in presence of which the lover of bonnie
Annie Laurie has laid him down to die, and the daughter of the Ratcatcher haa sunk unheeded
into the mud off Westminster Bridge.
The first of these lyrics is called My Mary Anne. It is short, and it describes the sorrows
of a gentleman who is about to take a voyage, absenting himself therefore from the object
of his affections. The burden is a "farewell," with the intimation that
"The ship It la ready, and the wind ft is fair,
And I am bound for the sea Maby Asks 1"
The chief vocal effect of the ditty is a pleasing maniacal shout when the _ singer arrives at
the name of the lady. The poetical images are various. After likening himself to a
lamenting turtle-dove, the lover proceeds:—
"A lobster in a lobster-pot,
A blue-fish wriggling on a hook,
May suffer some—but O no not
What I do feel for my M aby Asse 1"
And he sorrowfully records that though pumpkins was the pride of all the produce of his
kitchen at home, none of them could compare in angel form with hi9—Mart Anse. We
hardly know to whom among the American poets to assign the authorship of this song.
There is a breezy sea air about it that reminds one of Longfellow, but he has not claimed
it, while the illustrations from nature would seem to point to Mr. Emerson. Mr. Willis,
we think, would hardly have had courage for the pumpkins, or else the tenderness of the
tone much resembles that of his recent writings.
The next song to which Mr. Punch would invite attention is even more popular than its
predecessor. It is of a more playful character, and is supposed to express the sentiments
of a young lady, who, discovering that her suitor has entrapped the affections of another
maiden, permits his attentions in order to punish his infidelity, and having brought him
to the church door, abandons him, exposing him to the ridicule of his associates. There is
a lofty moral purpose therefore in this poem, and we believe that uncontradicted public
report, which assigns the authorship to Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorn, is not inadequately
based. The Spartan brevity with which the story, which is called Bobbing Around, is told,
is artistic in its simplicity:
"In August last, on one fine day,
Bobbing around.
When Josh and 1 went to make hay,
We went bobbing around.
"Says Josh to me, let's take a walk,
Bobbing around,
Then we can have a private talk
As we go bobbing around."
The lady assents, and they visit the bridge belonging to a certain Squire Slifslof. In
the same metre, and with the same rhyme, are recorded a little playful love-passage, the
exchange of a salute, and the offer of marriage.
The fair narrator glances briefly over subsequent
events, but, intimating, as follows;—
"I knew he lov'd another gal.
Bobbing around:
They called her long-legg'd, crook* d-shln'd
curly-tooth'd Sal,
Where he went bobbing around,"
she thus describes how she avenged the wrong
to her pretty friend:—
"So after we got into Church,
Bobbing around,
I ran and left bim in the lurch,
Then he went bobbing around."
But the third of the ballads now having pos-
session of the public ear is most remarkable, and
from its extraordinary delineation of the negro
dialect and mind, we have no hesitation in
aicribing it to the accomplished authoress of
Bred, assisted, perhaps by her reverend hus-
band. It is called Keemo, Kimo. It appears to
describe nothing in particular, but to contain an
assortment of poetical ideas strung together with
that wild harmonious no-meaning, more delight-
ful than exact meaning, which gives its charm,
according to Mb. Charles Knight, to the tongs
of Shaksfbabe. It consists of nine verses, but
as any of them represents the whole, the selec-
tion we shall offer will give an adequate idea of
the composition. "The simplest charm prevails,"
and the shouts with which we have heard this
ballad greeted, each burst of applause followed
by a peremptory encore, show how a few touches
of nature make the whole world grin:
"In South Car'lina de darkies go—
Sing song, Kitty, can't yon kl' me, oh?
Oat's whar de white folks plant de tow—
Sing song, Kitty, can't you ki' me, oh?
"Keemo kimo 1 Dar I oh whar?
Wid my hi, my ho, and in come Sally singing
Sometimes penny-winkle ling-tum, nip-cat—
Sing song, Kitty, can't you ki' me, oh?
"Dey try for to sleep, but it ain't no use—
Sing song, Kitty, can't you ki' me, oh?
Dere legs hang out for the chickens to roost,
Sing song, Kitty, can't you ki' me, oh!
"Dar was a frog lived in a pool—
Sing song, Kitty, can't you ki' me, oh?
And sure dis frog he was no fool—
Sing song, Kitty, can't you ki' me, oh?
"De wedder's warm, and so am I—
Sing song, Kitty, can't you ki' me, oh?
I'm sure you'd lub me If you'd try—
Slog song, Kitty, can't you ki1 me, ob f"
With this extract Mr. Punch concludes his
analysis of the lyric successes of the present year.
The beauty, wit, and pathos of these composi-
tions are a striking contrast to the vulgar, bald,
meaningless ditties which used to delight our
fathers in the days of Kehble and Siddons, and
the enthusiasm which our modem ballads excite,
affords a noble answer to the carpers who allege
that popular taste has not improved. _ Such
strains, moreover, coming from the other side the
Atlantic, bind England and America more closely
in the bonds of social sympathy, and irradiate
with a common sunthine the hearts of the two
mighty nations. Long may the Americans send
us such poems, and long may British audiences
assemble to be enraptured by them.

One Physician is better than two, but three are fatal.
Hope Is the best medicine, and fortunately it is in the

There is one evil that Doctors in length of time do effec-

nostrums.
Medical Botanymight be restricted almost to the plucking
of Simples!
Might we not say of a Doctor what Figaro said of the
Seigneur of his period—tbat he does us a sufficiency of good,
so long as be refrains from doing us any harm?
Wise persons, when they take advice, go to a Physician,
hut fools go to a Quack—and the largedisproportton between
the two classes explains why so many Quacks make their
fortune whilst many a clover Physician starves.^
Many persons take advice as they do physic—to fling
it aside the moment the Doctor's back is turned.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 18, 1856.

MUGGINS IN MOSCOW.
Being utterly ignorant of the Russian Language, he brings the appliances
of Art to describe the items or his Washing Bill.
MR. DRUMMOND ON BEER.
To Mk. Samuel Pope, and bis "United Kingdom
Alliance," we present the following morsel of a speech
made by Mb, H. Drummond at the Surrey Agricultural
Association's late meeting at Epsom:—
"Gentlemen, I believe this question of beer presses as much on the
morals as on the comforts of the people ; and if by the means of removing
the malt tax, you can give them plenty of really good beer, you would do
more to reform their morals than by all the trumpery schemes that are
now being bo strongly advocated."
Mb, Samuel Pope, and his Allies of the United Kingdom
are leagued, we suppose, against tobacco as well as beer—
accordingly we will not advise them to put the foregoing
scrap of common sense into their pipes and smoke it, but
will venture to recommend it to them as something to
chew, and if possible, to swallow, and digest. Who are
the soberest people in the country, but the superior classes,
so called, who can get superior wine, and as much of it as
they want? but what wine is superior to really good beer?
is it not reasonable to suppose with Mr. Dbummond,
that the command of really good beer would be morally
tantamount to the possession of superior wine? The whole
of the observations made on this subject by the Honourable
Member for West Surrey upon the occasion above mentioned
are deserving of attention, being both pleasant and in-
structive, and.the obvious coupletj of—
"Hear, hear, hear,
1 i: a v DauMMoKD on Boer!'
may be suggested as the subject of a jolly catch to be sung
over jugs of good ale, if procurable, as Mb. Dbummond
. ays it is only at one place in the county, by that gentleman's
constituents.
Experimental Philosophy.
A Poob Curate says " He has often heard of the Three
Experiments of Living, bnt as for himself, he should like to
try the Experiment of Three Livings, for he has been trying
one Living all his life, and on his word the Experiment does
not answer, for it is as much as he can do to live upon it."
The Golden Calf.—One of the animal comforts of our
dear Old Mother Church!!!
SPIRIT OF THE RUSSIAN CIRCULAR.
An Ambassador has been defined to be, a man sent abroad to lie on
behalf of the commonwealth. With a slight alteration, this definition
will suit a Russian ambassador. He is to consider hioiself as a man
sent abroad to lie on behalf of the Czar.
To render a master the service of a lie, is to honour him*with an act
of the deepest humility that a human being can perform to his superior;
and is therefore the most acceptable homage that we can offer to our
august Empebob.
The views of our Imperial Master on the Naples question will be best
consulted by steady and determined lying.
In order to lie systematically, and with success, it is necessary to
know the exact truth which is to be falsified.
It suits the purpose of our august Master to compare the threatened
interference of England and France with Naples to the actual inter-
ference of His Majesty's late father, Nicholas, of blessed memory,
with Turkey. It wdl be, therefore, your duty to persevere in insisting
that the two cases are precisely similar, until further orders. To do this
effectually, you must clearly understand that they are very different.
His late Imperial Majesty interfered with the government of the
Sultan in order to obtain a footing in his dominions, under pretence of
demanding justice and toleration for his Christian subjects. If his
alleged motive had been his real one, he would of course have been
content with obtaining the securities necessary for his professed object,
in conjunction with the Western Powers.
England and Prance propose to interfere with the Government of
the King of Naples with the sole view of inducing him to treat his
subjects in a manner accordant with their ideas of humanity and justice.
There is no doubt that tbey have not the least intention of usurping
any portion of his authority or dominions.
The only resemblance between Russian interference in the affairs of
Turkey, and Anglo-French in those of Naples consists in the mere fact
of interference. Between one proceeding aud the other there is an
immense moral distinction. You are required to assert and argue, in
the most positive manner, that there is none whatever. You will also
vehemently maintain that our august Master's motive in protesting
against Anglo-French dictation to the King of Naples is a sense of
justice; because he regards it as au attempt to govern in King
Eebdlnand's stead, and an open declaration of the right of the strong
against the weak.
Always, however, bear in mind that such is not our august Master's
motive, and that he thinks no such thing. Understand that he is
really actuated by a fear for the right divine of kings, in which the
belief of men wilt be shaken by the success of an attempt to compel
the King of Naples to govern his people otherwise than as he feels
proper. The Empebob wishes to enforce the doctrine that Kings and
Emperors (by divine right as contradistinguished from popular elec-
tion) are amenable to no human censure, and that any torments or
other outrages, which it may please them to inflict on their subjects,
are to be regarded in the same light with divine afflictions ana
punishments.
You will disseminate the lies necessary for the maintenance* of this
doctrine in all quarters wherein they are likely to obtain any credit.

GOOD PRACTICAL JOKING AT ALDERSHOTT.
here is a taste in the British
Army for intellectual amuse-
ments which onght by ail
means to be encouraged.
We therefore notice, with
approbation, certain theatri-
cal performances, reported,
by the Morning Pott, to have
been recent ly given at Alder-
shott, by some officers of the
Grenadier and Scots Fusilier
Guards, and the Royal
Engineers. We trust that
the example of these dis-
tinguished regiments will
exert a wholesome influence
on some others, equally dis-
tinguished in a different
sense, and that members of
the latter corps will be in-
duced, taking the cue from
their betters, to believe that
there is more fun in playing
the Camp at Chobham, and Lend me Five Shillings, than there is in
playing brutal and filthy tricks, called practical jokes. Our fashionable
contemporary states that—
"The perfect imitation of Bockstone by Capt. Camfbzu. u GMghlbj, elicited roars
of laughter."
Certain officers would act wisely if they would act like Captain
Cahpbbll in imitating Mr. Buckstone, in preference to imitating
blackguard boys, and amusing themselves by the very stupid panto-
mime of pulling a comrade out of bed, suspending him in a chair,
shaving half of bis face, and practising other indignities on his persen.
If they are not clever enough to imitate Mb. Buckstone, they might,
at least, follow, at a respectful distance, in the pigeon-toed footsteps of
Mb. Mebrt Andrew Matthews, and content themselves with
playing harmless clown's pranks on an amateur stage.
A pun is really a niuch more practical joke than pulling anybody out
of his bed, or pouring water thereinto; for it has, practically, the effect
of creating a smile, nay sometimes even a laugh, and here is one from
the prologue to the above-named performances—spoken by Mr. Malet
of the Grenadier Guards—than which many worse have set a table in a
roar:—
"Bnt now we've peace, and Bo farewell to Mars;
The Turks, like Irishmen, hare got their Kara."
Many Russian Officers understand English—and if this joke bad
been made in the face of the Enemy, as no doubt the gallant perpetrator
was quite capable of making it, the hostile force would have probably
been thrown into convulsions, consequently into confusion, and the
result would have been glorious for the British arms.
We must, however, give a little advice as well as credit to our
military poet and wag. His prologue contains the following couplet:
"And all the actors will, 1 hare no fear,
Merit the fame they won in the Crimea."
Now "Crimea" does not rhyme with "fear." as this substantive is
usually spoken. The f irmer word can only be made to rhyme with
the latter by two methods; which are alike objectionable. The first
method is that of pronouncing "fear" as "fee-ah ;" the second is the
expedient of pronouncing "Crimea" as "Crimear." We should like
to know which of these terrible alternatives was adopted by the gallant
speaker. But we must not forget the piece of advice which we pro-
mised the equally gallant poet. There is a little book called Walker's
Rhyming Dictionary. It ought to lie—when it does not lie—on] every
poet's table. He should get that little book.
A PAPER THAT WON'T DRINK!
Amongst the wonders of the age, we are wonderstruck with a water,
proof paper! We should say this would be a capital material for all
Teetotallers to write their Traots upon, as at present most of their
arguments against the moderate use of cheering, nourishing, or stimu-
lating drinks will scarcely hold water. Lord Stanley, also, might as
well purchase a ream or two, as his style of arguing against the Maine
Liquor Law, was, as tested by a lactometer in our possession, exceed-
ingly milk and watery. It is an aquatic question, however, whether this
particular paper (which will present the new feature of beirg a paper
without a water-mark) will not, since it resists all contact with water,
be open to the charge of hydrophobia P in which case, all young puppies
and old dogs, who, being afflicted with the rabies scribendi, are in the
habit of writing " like mad" upon every possible occaf ion, will probably
entertain a most fraternal affection for it. The Natters, Pater-
familias, the Oldest Inhabitant, the Fifteen Yeabs' Subscriber,
Piiilojustiti/e, and our old agreeable friend, the Constant Reader,
to say nothing of other well-known liberal correspondents of the Daily
Press, will be evincing a most insane partiality for it. In the mean-
time it would not be a bad idea, if this waterproof paper is fairly
entitled to the virtue ascribed to it of keeping out water, to have all
milk-pails lined with it.
A HINT FOE CHRISTMAS REVELLERS.
An ingenious Correspondent says that there is something'in a lady's
dress which, at an emergency, would do admirable duty for a Caristmas
Tree. His design will probably illustrate his meaning better than any
long-winded explanation of ours. He calls hia invention j fyrsusfc^^

THE EARL OF ALBEMARLE AND HARVEST HOMES.
The Earl op Albemarle's late talk to the labourers of Win-
farthing. Norfolk, was as full of wisdom as a sheaf's full of com. He
did not howl against small beer, but gave earnest praise to "jolly good
ale and old." He told the labourers to seek their comfort and their
happiness at their own firesides; and then he told the labourers' wives
to take good care that what their husbands sought, they should find.
It is a sad thing, and often preached about, to see the husband and
father looting snd boozing at the beer-house; but it is won>e to see the
dirty, lazy wire and mother at her own foul fireside. Given, twenty
husbands drunk at the pubi c house, how many lazy, cross-grained
wives out of the twenty, have -ent them there? This is a sum that is
not sufficiently resolved. If the m%rried man makes a beast of himself,
it is not always that he alone should bear all the burden.
THE CRINOLINE CHRISTMAS TREE.
Take away the chocolate cigars, the sugar" elephants, and the ginger-
bread kings and queens, and our young Albert Durer says that his
Crinoline Christmas Tree could at a moment's notice be, also, con-
verted into a Jnpon Chandelier, that might be most elegantly orna-
mented with Chinese lanterns. Thus, there is good in all thing*, even
in a monster nuisance like a lady's dress, such as it has lately been
allowed to expand to.
THE SCHOOLMASTER "ABROAD!"
The French Minister of Instruction has written an official letter to
the English Government averring that, with respect to the instruction
of Protestant children in French Catholic schools, the tricks and
subtleties of the Bishop op Arras shall in no way be permitted; there
shall be no tampering with the faith of the children, runs the imperial
decree, but all shall be plain and above-board. Thus, it appears, that
the meddlesome monk of Arras has been most imperially snubbed.
Once upon a time, a Bishop with red-hot tongs pinched the nose of the
meddlesome Evil One; and now Liberalism (which at Arras is not a
bit better than the Naughty Principle) pinches the nose of the Bishop.
However, he has this remedy. He may, at least, quench the fire in
Holy Water; and henceforth, for his own quiet, avoid pen and ink.

The American hero, Mr. Bbooks, in consideration of the chivalrous

some may rather think, be deserves to have broken over his shouldeis.
We wonder the Marylebone Guardians have contented themselves with
evincing their sense of their Wckhouse Master's services by simply
retaining him in his office in defiance of the Poor-Law Board. They
have not presented him with the testimonial of a single stick, although
he stumped the achievement of Mb. Bbooks considerably in thrashing

ARB THE FRENCH SHEEP?
The SiicU dethrones the hybrid tiger and monkey, elevated by
Voltaire, and exalts the sheep. "The Frenchman is a sheep, but
intelligent and witty, who goes whithersoever he is led." How, being
such an intelligent sheep, he is to be led anywhere, we can scarcely
determine. Asses are led by the nose; hence, therefore, the intel-
ligence of asses!" If the pasturage is not to his liking, he grumbles,
but sings." Upon this, according to the SiicU, the shepherd rubs his
handr, and says with Mazabin, "He sings; he is therefore content, he
will pay me and give me his wool." Aud so the shepherd slumbers in
security, and pens his sheep closer and closer, until at length the sheep
revolt and become furious. Whereupon the shepherd promises fresh
and tender grass, and liberty to feed. And tbe Bheep reply, " It is too
late." Upon this the SiicU moralises—" It was too late for Charles
X. in 1830; it was too late for Louis Philippe in 1848."
But, philosophic, moralising SiicU, why stop at 184S, seeing that we
are in 1850? Why not proceed with the parallel P Tell us in what
condition is the French sueep of the present day? Has he liberty to
feed in pleasant pasture!", or is lie penned P Does he give his wool
patiently; or does he kick and butt and show ominous signs of revolt

King Bomba appears to take great delight in going to see the lique-
faction of the blood of St. Januabius. This alleged miracle is generally
considered to be a humbug, and rightly so considered, but not on those
grounds which are the most conclusive. The grand reason why it must
be a mere trick is, that such are the atrocities of which Bomba has been
guilty, that, if the stuff shown for the saint's blood were his real blood, and
already fluid, the presence of the tyrant would assuredly make it curdle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ACTORS THEIR OWN CRITICS.
£ have always had a remorseful
belief that criticism was rather
an unprincipled profession. We
know that certain men ply the
pen with no such weak mis-
givings. Like Slippery Sam,
recorded in Peachum's black
book, who, in an hour of repent-
ance had views of following his
trade as a tailor, "which he
called an honest employment,"
like him, critics may be found,
even at the best oyster-parties,
who have a morbid notion of
the use and dignity of their
vocation. We speak especially
of critics of plays and players.
Tor our own Dart, we have, we
say, our misgivings. We believe
that a man may criticise his heart, allowing him the organ to begin
with, into nothing better than a vinegar-plant: not bat what vinegar
is an admirable conservative when it is vinegar from wine; but when
it is vinegar from small-beer, its only quality is that of wry face and
stomach-ache.
We are now approaching the theatrical season. In time-honoured
phrase, the temples of the drama will all be open. We will not at
present pause to contemplate the idols to be worshipped therein.
Many of them not only idols of wood, but idols of plaster of Paris.
We are chiefly desirous of knowing the opinions of managers and
actors generally, whether it would not more materially and morally
conduce to their serenity, and haply to their consequence in public
opinion, were they all to write their own views of their own merits as
managers and players; and so defend and secure themselves from the
cruelty, the meanness, the ignorance and the misrepresentation of a too
heartless criticism? An old traveller tells us that, once upon a time,
travelling in the desert, he beheld the, body of a lion, stark and dead,
his mighty heart transfixed by the quill of a porcupine. How typical
is this of at ouce the power and the meanness of criticism! How many
a lion-like player is slain by the goose-quill critic 1 How many an in-
glorious Gordon Cumming strews his morning column with the car-
case reputations of stupendous beasts!" The offence is rank," and
must be abated.
We therefore hope that the players will take their merits in their
own hands; and so at once reduce the critic?, daily, weekly, and
monthly—for there are all such, even as there are small gilded insects
that live one day, seven days, thirty—to the Insolvent Court of
Parnassus. Now, more than ever, should actors protect themselves
from the obtuseness of critics; because now, more than ever, there are
actors whose genius ought to keep them sacred from anything short of
self-praise, self-admiration. Never, perhaps, since the Tragic and
Comic Muses were jolted in the cart of Thespis (Thespis now drives a
carriage on C springs, and bears a sucking-pig for his crest) never
could the world boast of such a race of actors as the ladies and gentle-
men whose names at the present gladdened hour make effulgent the
British play-bills. And shall we send a wild boar, nay, a hog of a critic
into this rose-garden; and while the beast uproots, and munches, and
crunches, shall it be said that he nicely discriminates? By no means;
let every rose reflect itself; in other words, let every player be his
own ink-bottle.
For how frequent, how great, is the injustice done to the player, yea,
to the poor player, by the besotted, the irreverent critic! An entirely
original drama from the French is played for the first time. The
author has sufficient knowledge of the language of Moliere to pick
Us way through the piece, keeping a sharp look-out that he may not
avoid the dirty places. Well, the entirely original drama is presented;
and though it ought, perhaps, to have been indicted by Sir Benjamin
Hall, it is consecrated by the critics, who, of course, to make amends
for one wrong, commit another, by falling foul of the implicated
players. But why dwell on this? The observant dramatic reader
most have noted the invariable practice of the critic to smear the
author with honey and the poor actor with mud. The reason has not
long to be sought for. The critic has the conceit to believe himself
literary, and so assumes common cause with the dramatist. The old
story. A bundle of quills!
Seeing then that the present age is rich beyond any age preceding in
stage genius, the ethereal quality, for it is no less, ought to defend
itself, and that too with ethereal arms. Therefore, let every player
contain a critic; he could for that matter, contain the quality of a whole
set of critics; even as we have seen a cherry-stone made to hold at least
a dozen spoons. We have no longer any patience that artists—artists
£S soul !—should be handed over to the rude handling of horny-fisted
mechanics. We would as soon hope to see an ass. by the artistic con-
duct of his teeth, bite the statue of Hamlet out of a lump of ginger-
bread, as expect to have the Hamlet of that gifted creature Tear-
tatters truly and nicely, and withal, reverently rendered. Therefore,
let Teartatters alone write of Teartatters. In this truthful time,
in this present hour of simplicity, the unassisted genius of the player
so beautifully vindicates the genius of the poet, that we can, indeed,
well afford to dispense with the meretricious show of the scene-painter,
with what we will dare to call the harlotry devices of the property-
man. When we have an unpainted Othello who, by the very force of
his genius, can act himself black in the face; when we have a Richard
III., whose ujsthetic projectiveness can add a hump to his back and a
buckshin to his leg, we of course contemptuously reject the aid of
dresses and decorations, and as an acting nation, like Apollo Belvedere,
challenge the admiration of the world by the very beauty of our
nakedness.
With this conviction, that every actor is his own best critic, we have
read with singular delight the modest estimation of his own powers by
a Mr. G. Vining, of the Theatre Royal Brighton. The gifted creature
had been criticised, as it is called, by the editor of the Night-Watch.
The bungling, irreverent critic had been biting his gingerbread. Well,
new, ana bold, and beautiful was the defensive conduct of the player.
The ink in every critic's bottle throughout Brighton must have gone
red with amazement at his bravery. The player was acting Captain
Hayikesley, in itself a bold undertaking in so military a town as
Brighton. But if genius is tremulous, it is also courageous. In the
course of his part, the Captain, with the sudden power of a man in-
spired, for he never thought of the matter before he found himself on
the boards, interpolated a speech, as thus:
"Swindler as I am, adventurer, ruffian—I might be something worse—I might even
sink so low as to become the editor of the Night-Watch—that butcher, who makes his
paper a dramatic slaughter-house; and such a critic, before going to a theatre, should
swallow half a box of antibilious pills."
The editor had not admired G. Vining; ergo, the editor was tome-
thing worse than a swindler, adventurer, ruffian; he was—in the
practical opinion of G. Vising—" a dramatic butcher." Well, didn't
G. Vining speak wooden skewers at him; and all out of his own head?
Further, the inspired player observed:—
"I'm going across the herring-pond; if justice were done, the editor of the Night-
Watch, be would bare to accompany me."
We think all this so admirable, that we only hope it is not inimitable.
We therefore earnestly desire that the example set by Mr. G. Vining
may be immediately and generally followed. Thus, if any morning or
evening or weekly critic should venture to find fault with any actor, the
actor—(of course the player must have a certain standing to be allowed
the right of reply; otherwise we may have the little ballet-girls flouting
and pouting at the broad Bheet,)—the aotor may as soon as possible be
permitted to answer the critic from the stage, interweaving, after the
admirable Vining manner, his individual abuse of the writer with the
text of the dramatist. We are bold enough to hope great instruction
and some amusement from these answers from the foot-lights.
At the same time, not to be too hard upon the critics, we think they
ought in the like manner to meet with some encouragement from the
actor, in his place as an actor, when they shall have had the good taste
to eulogise him. As thus. We will suppose that the Globe has been
very complimentary to Hamlet. Well, Hamlet can maks a very
graceful acknowledgment of the courtesy :—
"Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a scat
in this distracted Globe. [And here I thank
The editor of that enlightened print,
For his most wise, most Just and beautiful
Account of my performance.]
Of course, this mode of acknowledgment can be varied with the com-
plimentary paper, the Times, \hefihronicle, the Herald, and others, for
instance, should the manager happen to act Richard III., when he asks—
".Who saw the Sm to-day.?"
Radcliffe, on this occasion, may make answer—
[" Why J, my lord,
And having seen.it, must perforce declare,
A criticism with mora honey in't,
And yet with more of truth, I ne'er did read.—
Hichard. Criticism 1 Aught of me, good Ratldyfff f
litidelifff . 'Tis therein writ, your liichard is sublime.
Richard. The Sun'% a gentleman, and has my thanks.]
The text of Sbarsfeare may then be taken up; and will, of course,
be relished with a keener gust from the sharp and spicy personalities by
which it has been broken. For ourselves, as we propose to be very
critical during the approaching eventful season, we are prepared to
receive any amount of sweets and bitters. At the same time, our can-
dour compels us to own, that we think it would be far better if all such
meddlers as the Night-Guardian of Brighton were settled once and for
ever, and that every actor became tor all time his own critic and
commentator.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 18, 1856.
VESUVIUS IN LABOUR!
The rumour ran as on the electric wires through Europe that Vesuvius was in labour;
it was affirmed that she had been heard to utter groans so violent that they had actually
drawn tears as big as cannon-balls down Bomba's iron cheek. There was an awful deal of
moaning, and muttering, and a rumbling sound came from under the ground as though pri-
soners confined in deep cells were endeavouring to make their piteous cries heard. It was a
continual running backwards and forwards, and a slamming of doors, and a ringing of bells,
and a jingling of kejs. and a drawing of bars and bolts, such as quite took away the breath
of the oldest political nurse in office, whilst poor Aberdeen drew the night-cap over his
ears to keep the noise out. The vapouring, too, was so intense that for awhile the political
horizon was completely obscured by it.
All Europe stood on tiptoe to witness what would come forth from this terrible travail
of underground plots and counterplots, and the surmises went buzzing through the air as
thick as mosquitos that a terrible convulsion was near at band, and priests began to put
their prison-houses in order. An eruption was expected which was to bury one half of the
Continent in ashes and sackcloth; and so great was the public excitement that fleets came
all the way from England and France to be spectators of the incredible event. Some expected
a giant in monster top-boots would stride upon the quivering earth; others looked forward
to the advent of a second Cesar, who was to throw chains anew round the neck of the
humiliated Gaul and Briton. The breaths of all were suspended, like the payments of the
British Bank, in the earnest expectation of something grand, astonishing, convulsive! There
was a deafening hullabaloo, as though a thousand Italian-irons were being rattled together
in the fierce furnace of the mountain; fiery flames shot towards the skies black as crape, as
though in deep mourning for Italian freedom; Cossack oaths rent the air, and there was not
a Cardinal that did not shake at that moment with secret fear in his scarlet stockings.
The crisis was at hand! The Pope held the cradle of despotism, ready to receive the
new-born prodigy, when, after a loud shriek of derision, the mountain's sides seemed to split
as with laughter, and out crept a tiny Russian Bear! Its hair was singed, as though with
recent gunpowder, and it was no bigger than a mouse. Vesuvius in labour had brought
forth a cub! Loud was the laughter that echoed and re-echoed from Balmoral to Biarritz!

GROSS OUTRAGE ON THE SCOTTISH LION.
How vulgar it is to cast invidious reflections upon a nation! "What a very low style of
insolence do those people indulge in who contemptuously denominate an Irishman Paddy, a
Welshman Taffy, a Scotchman Sawney; and banter the first about bulls, the second concern-
ing leeks, goats, and toasted cheese, and the third touching thistles, oatmeal, cutaneous
irritation, and sulphur!
A shocking instance of the inferior description of ta«te above alluded to has been afforded
by a person calling himself "A Scot bt Name and Nature," in a letter addressed to the
Times, wherein he makes the following illiberal remark at the expense of his pretended
countrymen, whom, with a malicious tautology, he repeatedly describes as "tremendously
ecclesiastical."
"Our national character Is still that of a religions people. Our press, therefore, as fairly representative of the
national sentiment, is tremendously ecclesiastical. Scotchmen generally are not ashamed of this fact. When they
have no other religion, they make up for the want by a pride built upon the religion of their ancestors, and on the
religious character of the nation."
So that, according to this calumniator of Cale-
donia, some of the religion of Scotchmen is mere
pride, and that some is built upon the other
Scotch religion—a precious foundation to support
such a superstructure!
No wonder that this nominal but most non-
natural Scot goes on to affect to exult and rejoice
in the alleged Sabbatarianism of canny Scotland.
Tnere are, however, doubtless, a few of the
countrymen of Burns, who, less perceptive of
sly sarcasm than that humorous bard was, may
read through this epistolary insult to their native
land, and not dieeern the cloven foot that peeps
from under the author's assumed plaid trousers,
until they feel the rude and violent kick inflicted
on tbem figuratively by that horrid hoof in the
following coarse observation:—
M We have squabbles among onrselvea, bnt he Is very
ignorant of the Scottish manners who knows not that
1 scratchin' and pooin' is Scotch folks wooin.'"
Any reference to scratching in association with
Scotchmen is gross enough. It is dreadfully
plebeian to represent the maxim of "Caw me,
caw thee," to be the condition of Scottith friend-
ship. But to describe the endearments of Cale-
donian court;hip as consisting in a counterchange
of the counter-irritation produced by "cawing;"
to paint laddies and lassies assuaging the grief of
a common affection with mutual nails, is to out-
rage delicacy to an extent rendering the most
powerful hartshorn necessary to prevent the
imagination of such a spectacle from occasioning
the least refined individual to faint outright.
The danger of syncope will be increased by the
consideration that the word "pooin'," collocated
by this shocking satirist with scratchin*"
obviously denotes a remedial process subsidiary
to that operation. It is, no doubt, an abbre-
viation of "shampooing," and the shampooing,
in the case contemplated, is of course supposed
to be understood as involving a medicated appli-
cation.
This effusion of unpleasant irony, in derision
of Scotland, is dated from Edinburgh, and may
have baen concocted there by some prejudiced
southern tourist, whom Auld Beekie will be
much too far north to acknowledge for a son.
IMPALPABLE HONOUR.
We invite public attention to a remarkable
specimen of flunkey ism at a penny a-line. Having
stated that the Prince of Wales has been
making a tour lately in the South-Western
Couuties, and that, in the course of an excursion
the other day, he put up at the Crown Hotel;
Wimborne, the writer informs us that—
'* His Royal Highness so completely preserved his incognito
that be had taken his departure before the Inhabitants of
the town were aware of the honour conferred upon them."
What honour can be conferred upon a place
by a member of the Royal Family, or anybody
else, by going privately to a public-house la it?
If the mere presence of Royalty at a particular
spot is sufficient to confer honour on the people
who are there, whether aware of the honour or
not, the passengers in waiting on a railway plat-
form will be the unconscious recipients'of honour
whenever a train happens to stop at the station
with a Sovereign disguised, and travelling with
an alias, and perhaps aslerp in one of the
carriages. Everybody has heard of the man who
boa-ted of being honoured by a king who told
him to get out of his way; that is an old joke,
but here we have our young Prince represented
as honouring the inhabitants of Wimbourne, by
getting out of theirs—which is a new one.
L? there are Quacks who seem to stand up
high, it is simply on account of the numerous
Flats that surround them.

THE STICK IN THE PULPIT.
The Reverend Ma. Bird, of Cumberworth, takes up the cudgels in
the cause of one James Scott, who beat his wife because she would
not go to Church to hear the Bird aforesaid. Scott has been sent to
gaol with a month's hard labour. Mr. Bird has improved the oocasion,
and given lectures, in which he contends—
"That it is a man's duty to rule his own household; and that If his wife refuse to
obey his orders, he is justified, according to tbe law of God, in beating her in order to
enforce obedience."
Will Mr. Bird point out where "the law of God" directs the
beating of a wife "to enforca obedience?" We thought "a soft
answer turned away wrath;" but Ma. Bird evidently preaches from
his own edition of the Scriptures. We should hardly think Ma. Bird
the dove of the Church, but the butcher-bird of the Conventicle. Any
way, so long as Mr. Bird advocates the cudgelling of wives, so long
shall we be sorry to liud such a stick in the pulpit.

THE WATER-CURE OF CRIME.
You spouting Pumps, in solemn league combined
To throw cold water upon all mankind,
Yon, by the Yankee Maine Law who propose,
Each tap to shut and every bar to close,
There is a point which I must have you clear,
Ere you '11 persuade me to relinquish beer.
'Tis held by you, who go the total swine,
A wickedness to taste a drop of wine;
You say, of Crime's unfathomable sink,
The source and fountain is fermented drink,
And grapes and grain, engendering alcohol,
Are fruit whose poison works another Fall.
Cease, Pomps, awhile to spout, and lock around,
Behold what rogues on every side abound!

That liquor leads such knaves as these askew?

Did Strahan partake the spirit and the sin?

the good opinion she has of herself.
"STOP HER I"
There is a grand clan-trap line in Pizarro, which informs ns that
"A wretched mother, with a poor orphan in her arms, has Nature's
passport through the world." We should be sorry to contradict such
a devoted creature as Cora, but we really should not advise her to
present herself in that wretched state at the Austrian frontier. We
are afraid she would have her "Nature's passport" very roughly
handled by those amiable gentlemen in cocked-hats and swords, and
would be very quickly sent back, or imprisoned, unless she had some
other passport to show them as well—more especially as " the Nature's
Eassport" would not, if it had the features of any ordinary passport,
e the prettiest object in the woild to show. An angry Custom-House
official would not, we think, be exactly moved at the sight of a child,
that was stamped, and marked, and covered all over with vise's, even
though they were all perfectly en regit. The production of a Foreign
Office Passport, for which Cora bad paid Is. 6rf., would command from
them fifty times more respect and attention. Besides, we strongly
doubt if tuch a brilliant specimen of civilisation as a Dassport was
ever known in a dark country like Peru! The pruning-knife, if jnrii-
ciously used, would have excised this and other anachronisms. The
play should have been sent, like a brief, to some intelligent dramatist
of the present day, with the instructions marked outside, "Finally to
Perus and Settle."
The Long Vacation.
The British Bank has closed to enjoy the Long Vacation. There
are several sums of money, amounting altogether to upwards of £150,000,
that have left the establishment for a similar purpose. Some of them
are parsing the time gaily on the Continent with the old Directors. Two
of them, representing a figure something like £75,000, have been on a
visit for some time past with two Members of Parliament, of the names
of Htjitphbet Browjj and John M'Grbgob. It is not known when
they will return. In fact, the most sanguine Shareholder has abandoned
all hopes of ever witnessing their return.

We are sorry to find that Mr. Milneh Gibson an/1 John Bright

Mr. Gibson that he should be pelted with such English?

Burglar (who is particular on the subject of Sherry). "Marsala,
bit Jingo!"
THE TREASONS OF VISCOUNT P-LM-ST-N.
It has now become a grave question at no less than three tea-tables in
the neighbourhood of Shoe Lane, whether Viscount P-lm-st-n should
not take the place of Guy Fawkes on the approaching fifth of
November and be burnt in multiplied effigies. There can be no doubt
of the fact that, at last, the sun of the Premier is about to set. The
crisis has been long coming; but the result will be the surer. A man
who has mocked at all the obligations of a Privy Councillor, and who
has moreover been known to fall defyingly asleep, with bis hut con-
temptuously arched upon his forehead, whilst Mb. Spooner has hurled
his thunderbolts at the idolatries of Maynooth; a man who has made
jokes, and with pain we add, very bad ones, at the sacredness of con-
stitutional governments; whilst at the same time he has folded to what,
in courtesy, we must call his bosom, all the despots of the world; a
man whose moral principles are best typified by the patches of a harle-
quins jacket; such a man has too long insulted the nation, and
scoffed at decency by possession of office; and we wait his approaching
expulsion from power as a just though tardy offering to the holy resent-
ments of an outraged people.
Ere, however, Viscount P-lh-st-n is cast from Downing Street for
ever—(and we almost shudder to reflect upon the fate that may yet await
him; for though our institutions may have been sapped and undermined,
the Tower of London stands where it did)—ere the Premier, if his good
fortune still attends him, passes to the obscurity of private life, we feel
that as journalists we shall only fulfil our duty towards that part of the
world at large—we say at large advisedly, for we are proud to say, that
we number among our readers several out-door patients, who share
our opinions,—if we enumerate a few, and only a few, of the many
treasons proveable against the misnamed statesman who has all but
annihilated the moral character and the material strength of this
devoted country.
In the first place, nobody but an idiot can deny (and we are sure
lis, TJrq-h-t will not) that, long since and again and again, the Pre-
mier has sold England to Russia. We might, nay, we will, if defied,
name the exact sums of the bargain; together with the dirty and
treacherous hands they passed through, with their final application in
the purchase of landed property. Men of England, you have been sold,
like so much cattle at an auction; knocked down in your beds without
knowing it and, bound band and foot, given over to the Czar. If, in
the next generation, Russ does not become the mother-tongue of your
little ones, all we can say is, it will be—very extraordinary.
We could prove that the Premier, with a jaunty contempt of the
consequences of praemunire, has long held a private correspondence,—
nay, more,—has received favours at the hand of the Pope. We scorn
to pry into the domestic circle, but the interest we claim to hold in our
country impels ua to ask, where did a certain statue of Venus, a rare
antique, dug up in the Campagna, and now at Broadlands, come
from; and for what seivices, we should rather say for what treasons,
rendered?
At the present moment the Austrians hold the Danubian Princi-
Saiities. We think that we could show reasons for this by many
ozens, wf re we intrusted with the key of the noble Viscount s wine-
cellar. Reasons, we say, bottled and yellow-sealed, and beaming with
the light of Jobannisberg from Metternicn's vineyards.
Rut we turn from foreign degradation to home disaster. Laying our
pen-hand upon our heart, we firmly believe that to the pernicious,
ambidexterous policy of the Premier may be traced almost all our
commercial and social evils. Oh, it is terrible to reflect upon the foul
example of lax principle in high places! With polished treason at the
council-table of the nation, what can we expect but wily fraud and
reckless rapine at the banker's desk and tradesman's counter F
We fearlessly put one question—Was the trade of adulteration ever
carried to such an alarming height as during the reign of power of the
baleful Viscount? Again, look at arsenic. But who shall wonder that
men buy poisons, when prosperous treason is permitted to sell its country?
We are not prepared to stake our reputation on the fact; but we
have every reason to suppose, that the noble Viscount (noble by
courtesy !) will be found to have had an account at the British Bank;
not tbat we mean for a moment to insinuate that he ever overdrew it.
We are, however, pretty well convinced that it will be shown before
Chancery that Mr. M'Gregor has been seen at the Viscount's
political parties; whilst—and this we know—a letter is in existence
from Mr. Hugh Innes Cameron in which the writer vaguely expresses
a desire to be admitted, if only for once, into those reunions) And
the fall of the British has astounded and shocked our national honesty.
As if any calamity ought to astonish us under the circumstances it has
been our painful duty to enumerate.
We refrain from touching npon another recent misdoing, as it is at
present sub lite; but we are quite ready to show that the Noble (?)
Viscount was a frequent visitor to the Crystal Palace; and—for we
are fearfully and wonderfully made—who shall limit the moral.influence
of such a man on the spirits of the weak and wavering P
But we feel tbat we have said enough. This, however, we must and
will say. We might even at this hour of national darkness, at tbis
moment of social apathy, despair of the destinies of England. But no!
We turn with reassured heart and brightened hopes towards Tower
Hill; and—though to abject souls the sacrifice may seem painful—we
yet feel tbat our country may be avenged and saved!—{Not from the
Morning Herald; but quite at its service.)
SPORTING IN FRANCE.
Hunting and shooting are now the sports at Compiegne. The
higher prices rise in Paris, the greater the leaps taken by the Emperor.
All the horsemen are mounted on Arabian horses, and it is said the
Duke op Cambridge, an invited guest, will be accompanied by the
Earl of Lucan, who will take with him the opinion of Lord Car-
digan as to the condition of the steeds. Lord C. would have per-
sonally attended; but is kept in London in order that, after due cm-
sideraton, he may be quite ready to reply to any letter in the Times
that may discuss his military virtues.
The Empress has already distinguished herself as a shot. Having a
year or two ago brought down an imperial eagle by shooting her eyes
at him, she has added to the achievement by bagging nine pheasants.
The Moniteur assures us that the loyal and affectionate birds felt more
than they could express at the killing kindness! Why not? What
says the poet?
"Eels would be proud to lose their coat.
If skinn'd by Molly Dumplisq'b hand."
Nevertheless, we think beauty should leave such matters to the
beast. We like to think of Venus with her doves; but confess we
should not care so much for the goddess were she known to wring the
necks of the birds, and put them feet upwards under a crust.
Felice Orsini.
"Austrian Dungeons in Italy" is forbidden by the Austrian police
wherever Austria has placed her iron heel. In the meanwhile, as a set
off, Felice Orsini makes a missionary progress through free England.
Every lecture he gives is worth a regiment against the tyranny of
Austria. Thus, may a true man speak battalions!

which orb signified the prosecution, they both being close to the
violent, fixed star Caput Algol, or the Head of Medusa, a signification
notorious to prolesBors of astral science indicative of death by
hanging." (We preserve Raphael's grammar).
Apropos of Palmer, Raphael on Dovb is still more logical and
delightful. He had Dove's nativity, so could read his destiny.
According to the stars, Dove's being hanged was quite certain;
"Venus," "Ptolemy," "quartiles," ai.d "coi'junctions, all show it.
But, if Dove, instead of going to an astrologer of no merit, Harbison
of Leed^, had been to " a taleuted andJad'cious professor of the science,
he would doubtless have been saved from the fearful consequences of
the awful crime of which he had bttm found guilty." That is, Dove
was destined to be hanged, but Raphael would, if consulted, have
saved him frcm hanging! Professional rival.y is proverbial, but that
an astrologer, in order to discomfit, another, should advertise that he
ran alter fate, is rather strong. We would, nor. stand this, were we
Harrison. If he does not come to town and kit
no pluck.
Most of the other "fulfilments" are so stupid and awkward that
Mr. Punch cannot condescend to notice them. The leading events of
the year, of course, went exactly the reverse way to that predicted for
them; but what can you say to a man who uredictc "high feeling and
stormy debates in Parliament," and "fulfils" with a downright lie

1 Hooray I Hooray I 'Ere'» a Johnny with hti Calf failed down."
A ROD FOR "RAPHAEL."
The brilliant success of Mr. Punch in the fields of Astrology has, he
regrets to see, cast a sickly shadow over all the previous occupants of
that domain. Very helplessly, very stupidly, do they all come out in
their Almanacs this October. They are timid, and they protest, and
they evade, and there is in them all a Indicious apprehension of the
corking-pin with which Mr. Punch is likely to he down upon them.
They will commit themselves to very little, and they let out their
prophecies furtively, and then walk off hastily, just as t heir accomplices,
the thieves in the street, drop their plunder,, and bolt up courts, when
a detective rounds the corner.
There is one exception, however, to which Mr. Punch will presently
advert. His old victim, the unhappy Raphael—whose Almanac is
appropriately published in Newgate Street, tub mntnibui altis—
appears as usual with his jaundiced cover, and his hieroglyphic from a
twelfth-niylit character-sheet; but, alas, how changed from the Raphael
of audacious prediction and plausible nonsense of other days before he
had the misfortune to encounter the baton of Mr. Punch. Like the
Great Serpent, to be battered, when the fulness of time comes on, by
the hammer of Trior,—so says Scandinavian prophesy—he "faintly
crawls and emits insalubrious odour." His stars are all in a muddle,
they "afflict" one another, and "rnsh to combustion" like tipsy
Vauxball quadrillers lighting their cigars in the concluding promenade.
Raphael's " fulfilments" of his auguries for the present year are
sad—very sad. Contrast them with the literal precision with which
Mr. Punch's were expounded, and then say whether the s'ars favour
the Walworth quack or the Fleet Street sage. Mr. Punch foretold
every public event of the preceding year, but Kaphael—what has he
told? See here. Raphael said that in October, 1855, "Britain
would endeavour to hold the balance of power in Europe," and he
'' fulfils " with a bit of a speech from some nameless M.P. »ho mentions
that " V. and N. entwined with one laurel, means that England and
Prance are one army!" In December, "some bright s'ars in science
and literature dro ip," and the fulfilment is "the poet Montgomery,
(Raphael, ill-read, means Robert, and not the poet,^ Lobd Truro,
Thomas Cobitt, and Colonel Sibthorp, depart this lite." "Murders
occur," in December, and the "fulfilment" is that in that month a
coroner's jury finds a verdict against Palmer. Bat Palmer bad no
chance, it appears, for Raphael, prophesying after the faC, gives the
murderer's destiny. He has not the ■!.»•• of birth, so takes the date
when Palmer " was placed in the dock." "The Sun was Loid of
the Ascendant, was at house No. 10, afflicted by the eccentric Uranus,
mention the July prediction, because
Pafhael is proud of it, and puts it into remarkable type. "A dis-
tinguished lady suffers severe affliction. The highest power in the
land is afflie'ed." What do our readers think the glorious orbs of
Heaven stooped from their majesty to bring about in order to " fulfil"
this augury. "The Princess Royal's sleeve took fire!"
"The retrogradation of Jupiter" io Sep'ember clearly showed the
"disastrous failure of the Royal British Bank." Raphael, as be knew
this, might have had the good-na'ure to wam the public, and so save
an incalculable amount of misery. We shall never believe in his good-
nature and humanity after this.
But all that Punch has yet referred to in Mr. Raphael's pages, and
a good deal more, is mere impudent cackle, fit only to delude servant-
maids, small farmers in remote counties, half taught 'prentices, and a
few old women. But we now come to a piece of brutal and wanton
insolence, upon which we have no intention of speaking lightly. This
offensive quack, Raphael, a fellow who fives in a hole at Walworth,
has the presumption to declare that the stars of heaven have revealed
to him t hat Her Gracious Majesty's reign is nearly over. We quote
the fellow's own jargon.
Under May he says, " I forbear to remark on the primary direction in
the Nativity of our beloved Queen—Long may she reign."
In June, he says, "I forbear to treat particularly on the untoward
consequences of the Sun to the conjunction of Saturn in the Queen's
Nativity."
And in his summary he writes, "I cannot but reiterate my fears as
to the consequences of the untoward influences pervading the Royal
Nativity,"—adding a shuffling hope that the threatened misfortune may
affect the affairs of the na'ion rather than the Queen, which, of course,
either meant that Rapiiakl is an ignorant liar, or that the stars tell
nothing. Most people will p.ccspt both propositions. But in Raphael'*
"hieroglyphic" there is no such qualification. The sun is dark-
ened, the English crowu is falling from heaven, and death with a dart
and a funeral train are seen. •
Now this s)rt. of thing is disgusting in its impertinence. Raphael—
we are half inclined to print the snob's real name—in a low quack, and
nobody but a fool can be disturbed for a second by his rubiish. But
even a fellow like Raphael is not to be permitted >o take liberties with
the name of a Lady deservedly dear to all of us. How far he has com-
mitted the offence called "Imagining" the death of the Sovereign, Sib
Alexander Cockburs must decide; but we confess that if the case
can be met by a good whipping—which, if the h1.lv can forewe, he has
alrrady bolted—and three months of bard labour, we should like to see
Raphael taken in hand by the authorities. Harmless fun is to be
commendrd, and even harmless folly may be tolerated, but dirty
liberties like those of the Walworth impostor, who would sell his trash
by outraging decency and feeling, drsecve to be chastised. We confess
that a well-flogged Astrologer would >>e a sight we should have no
objection to see, and so we co nmend V1r IIapha*l to the improving
influences of the violent nine-tailed constellation Felts—the Cat.
The State of Parties.
To the lover of his country nothing can be more humiliating at the
present moment than the state of parties! Yes: party is extinct; and
a cold, heartleis, outward uniformity pervades all public men. A
Benjamin Disuaeli lights his cigar at the cheroot of Sir Uobert
Pekl, aud a Sra Charles Napier proposes to share his umbrella with
a Sir Jajcee Graham. Party is dead, and its tombstone is a hearth-
stone!

THE RAMPANT GAMEKEEPERS OF ROTHERHAM.
Sir Geoege Gbet will 'read
the Manchester Examiner and
Times and tbe Manchester
Guardian, he will find, by the
report of both of thosejournal?,
that W. H. Pickard, EiQ., and
tbe Ret. A. Fullekton, oom- i
hiring, as Magistrates, the
offices of judges and juror*,
have sghin, in a case of alleged
poaching, d;stingui»bed them-
selves by a conviction unwar-
ranted by evidence, and by a
rentence perfectly monstrous.
The charge was one of night-
poaching, it was preferred by a
gamekeeper who contradicted
himself, and whose evidence
was discrepant with that of a
witnefs called to corroborate
it. Tbe sentence on the de-
fendants, three in number, was
imprisonment in tbe House of
Correction for three calendar
months'; the p-isonere, at the end of that term, to enter into recognisances to the
amount of £10, with two sureties, each in £5, or one each in £10, that tbey would
not again offend for one year. The offence consisted in the conjectural capture of
a hare.
If there is no mistake in the statement of the two Manchester paper*, whereof
the above is an outline, what is the use of Sir Gcorge Grit in the character of
Home Si-cretary P What, at least, will be the use of the right honourable gentle-
man in that office, if he does not call the Rotherham game preserving 'Squire, and
his assessor tbe Parson, to account for a sentence which there seems nothing at
present to account for, except tbe circumstance that there was another Earl in tbe
case: the information baling been laid at the instance of the Earl or Effingham.
Mr. Pickard and Mr. Fullerton, perhaps, have great faith in the proverb which
says that the early bird picks up the worm.
BAD NEWS TOR GOOD APPETITES.
Although, in spite of some wet weather, the wheat upon
the whole han been favourably housed, and the harvest it is
thought will prove above the average, there- is but little
chance, we ff ar, of bread becoming cheaper. Of beans it is
reported that the crop is but indifferent; nor, so long as
any traces of disease remain, can we expect a more than
moderate yield of potatoes. It is stated, too, that rics is
likely rather to advance than fall: while, in consequence of
the incre«£ed demand, it seems there is small prospect of a
lower price for alum. It is obvious that as these are now
the principal ingredients of bread, it is to them we must
look for any alteration in the market. Pure wbea'en flour
is so little now in use, and for making bread is mixed in
such infinitesimal proportions, that it affects the bakers'
piice but little whether the supply of corn be plentiful or
seanty. Whether the practice will continue, it is for time
and tbe Times to 6how; but until Parliament deviBe some
means to stop adulteration, we fear the nation must submit
in place of wholesome bread to swallow " bakers' mixture."
For our health's sake, to say nothing of our palate, w« are
urgent in our wishes that the nuisince may be checked;
and we should vastly like to see a Bill brought in next
Session to lay a prohibitory duty upon alum, and make it
penal to use even beans for bread-making.
We would not frighten needlesaly any nervous reader,
but we real'y think, as bakers' consciences have now grown
so elastic, that a pamphlet might be written called Death in
the Bread Pan. To say the least, their manufacture proves
upon ana'yois a mere aluminous anomaly—a beany, pota-
toey, and ricey compound, full of strange paw-dutts and
queer substances: and while it is so constituted, we cannot
help thinking tbat our "Btaff of life" must be a rather
rotten one to lean upon for sustenance.

THE REV. MESSIEURS HEROD.
Here, Sir George Grey, is another of your Clerical Justices :—
"Eaton Socon, Oct 6, 1856.—Before the Rev. S. G. Fawcett.—Jase Hile, an
Inmate of the St. Neot's Union, was charged by Mr. Robert Gibson, tbe Master, with
misbehaviour during Divine Service at tbe Workhouse on Sunday, tbe 5th instant.
Committed to Huntingdon gaol for 21 days."
A Correspondent of the Times, under the name of "Humanttas,"
quotes the foregoing from a local journal, and adds, that on inquiry
into the facts of the case, he found
"That the1 misbehaviour' witb'which the female was charged was that of scribbling
in the Prayer-books with a pin, and indulging in .suppressed (laughter, with another
inmate."
This "Rev. Gentleman," S. G. Fawcett, according to Htjma-
WTTAS, "is also the chairman of the Board of Guardians." He appears
to have added one more instance to the facts of almost daily occurrence,
proving that the cassock and surplice are the proper clothes for a
Clergyman, and tbat it is highly inexpedient tbat ecclesiastics should
be drest in tbe little brief authority of a Magistrate: a costume wherein
they play more fantastic tricks than any other mortals, and occasion
angelic lamentation to a proportionate extent. Unfortunately, tbe
authority is too greaf, and its duration too long; but the latter evil
might be remedied, depending, aa it does, on the good pleasure of Sib
George Gret. Woat can be the reason that Clerical Justices are
generally, as the cabmen s%y, such "arbitrary coves P" Ooe is almost,
driven to tbe conclusion than divines are apt to entertain rather too
high an opinion of their personal divinity, and to conceive their own
will superior to all human laws. A Scotch proverb says that "fules
ehuld ria hae chapping stick*," aud the same principle that deprives a
fool of a knife ought, it would seem, to keep the sword of justice out of
the hands of a parson. The scholastic rod is the most formidable
weapon that it is saff—if it is safe—to intrust to a class of persons
who appear to inflict punishment, when unfortunately they are per-
mitted to inflictlit, in the spirit of a tyrannical pedagogue.
Blushing Honours.
Marshal O'Donnell, just before be was kicked out, was decorated
by the Emperor of the French with the grand cordon of the Legion
of Honour. O'Donnrll is now a lost man; and whoever will not bring
h>m back to his master, ought to be handsomely rewarded.
"Sir,
THE QUIET NIGHTINGALE.
When I go to Jullien's Concerts, and any performer is
about to execute a solo, I like to see him come forward, with his
instrument in hi* hand, and make a bow to me aud the rest of the
British Pub!'c. When I applaud his performance, and cry 'Brajvo!'
I am delighted by his miking us another low bow in expression of his
profound respect for us, aud fincere grati'ude for our encouragement.
It pleases nie to cause dramatic authors alto to bow from their boxes,
and to oblige actors to appear in front of the drop-scene and mitke tbeir
obeisance. I rejoice, at any sort of meeting, in heing addressed in a
deferential and facetiiius manner by minister*, statesmen, members of
parliament, and popular writers, judge then, S-r, of the disgust which
I felt on reading the following paragraph in the Court Journal:—
"Miss Niohtinoale is understood to have a .great objection to being lionised, and
this feeling, coupled with tbe impaired state of her health, induced a des're for seclusion
which required the all-powerful influeuoe of the Quern's especial invitation to induce
her to visit Scotland."
"Sir, I think that whoever becomes a public character ou?ht to
behave as such. Miss Nightingale bas fallen sadly short of my
expectations. I expected that she would make a tour of the United
Kingdom, and receive an address in the town-hall of eveiy principal
city from tbe mayor and alder men; then drive to the hotel, aud, during
her stay there, come out occasionally into the balcony, and wave a
white handkerchief to the assembled people. I did hope that at
several places she would have allowed au ad<niring multitude to remove
the horses from her vehicle, and to draw it themselves instead. I
fondly anticipated that she would preside at various tea-meeti- gs, and
distribute pi izea to g od girls and boys, and make little pprecies expres-
sive of sentiments suitable to the occasion. I looked forwaid to
reading accounts of all manner of interesting interviews with her,
obtained by enthusiastic parties. I made up my mind for nu nerous

with bishops a-.d eminent clergymen. 1 am sorry to say, Sir, that in

"TELL"ME WHERE IS PANCY BRED?"
_ In his recent work upon otrr national shortcomings, our late visitor,
Mr. Emerson—who we understand writes with none but tbe verv

those he criticises, begins at once a condemnation and a sentence by
remarking—
"The English hare no fancy."
"No fancy P " "eh P Haven't they, indeed! It almost takes our breath
away to hear a statement so audacious. The writer, it is true, is some-
times biassed in his evidence, and is in the habit not infrequently of

him as a know-nothing—or at any rate a know-nothing of English

We are not disposed to waste our "valuable space," as corres-
pondents call it, in arguing the matter coolly over with our satirist;
but if Mr. Emerson, when he revisits us (as he is pretty sure to do on
reading what attractions are in store for him), still holds to his opinion
that the English have no fancy," we rather fancy that a half hour's
gentle argument with the "Brummagem Bantam" or the "Slashing

In the almost daily lists of defaulters and swindlers now' published
by the newspapers, it is very wonderful that there are not more
Income-Tax Collectors. It is difficult to understand how the Govern-
ment contrives to get an honest man to become an instrument of that
extortion which the Income-Tax is, in so far as it is levied on precarious
income. One would think that a conscientious Income-Tax Collector
must be as rare as a benevolent Jack Ketch. We eatnestjy hope
that all the vessels bound for Sweden may be vigorously searched lest
they should contain other Income-Tax Collectors on their w»y to join

BEACTION'S LAWS AND CONVENT DISCIPLINE.
HE writer of a book called Flem-
ish Interiors, in giving an account
of the discipline practised in a
Belgian nunnery, by name the
"Convent of Poor Clares," re-
lates of the sisters, that
'' They never lie down, but sleep up-
right. I went up a narrow, oorkscrew,
htoDe staircase into their cells, and saw
tbese extraordinary beds: they consist
of a hard and almost cylindrical mat-
tress stuffed with straw, about 3 feet
long, at right angles to which is fixed
an equally hard upright palliasse, to
support the back. There Is no pillow,
neither are tben> sheets, and only one
thin blanket."

The authorof Flemish Interiors
i* not an emissary of Exeter
Hall, who has been hunting up
facts, or inventing fictions con-
cerning the Popish Church in
Flanders, with a view to dis-
credit Popery. He is a zealous
Korean Catholic; and the fore-
as redounding to the'
going particulars are narrated by
glory of bis persuasion.
Is it not enough for the Poor Clares to walk uprightly—as no doubt
they do, poor creatures; rich, nevertheless, in goodness. What eccle-
siastical quack, or spiritual fanatic, has persuaded them that lying per-
pendicularly is the way to go to Heaven? Heaven, by the bye, that
"tempers the wind to the shorn lamb," is equally merciful to the
fleeced victim rf priestcraft. Our author, with a wonderful blindness
to the moral of his tale, tells, in relation to the peculiar posture in
which these nuns make it a point to sleep, the following story, which
he had from one of them:—
"She and another lay-sister were sent, a short time ago, on a mission to England,
and this was another considerable grievance to her; but, she said, she kept her trouble
to herself, and accepted it as one of the acts of submission to the will of her superior
to which her rule had bound her."
Here we may observe in passing, that the merit of a voluntary
prostration of one human will before another human will, is part of the
religion which this lady has been taught to believe. Whoever believes
that, one would think, must be very sure that the superior cannot order
the slave to do anything wrong. To proceed :—
"The first night they arrived In London, when they put up at the hotel, they were
shown into a room where the beds were, of course, horizontal. This was a difficulty
which had not occurred to them, and they made up their minds to adopt the same
position as the rest of the world; but no sooner had they tried it, than they found it
impossible to sleep; accordingly, they relinquished the attempt, and taking the
mattress off the bedstead, placed it half upright against the wall, and had reason to be
perfectly satisfied with their ingenious
There is a certain great law of accommodation to
which rules the human organisation, adapting it to the diversities of
climate, and the extremes of heat and cold, muring it to hardships, and
aceustoming it gradually to strange food, even to the toleration of some
poisons. This same law renders the unnatural position in which the
Poor Clares have made it their Christianity to sleep, as good as natural
to them. Use becomes second nature, truly, to these ladies; they try
to make themselves uncomfortable to please a Lawgiver whose law
defeats their intention.
The tyrant custom, Othello says, had made the flinty and steel couch
of war his thrice-driven bed of down. The same tyrant appears to have
shown the same kindness to the Poor Clares: and doubtless renders
many of the tricks which fakirs practise upon themselves rather pleasant
than otherwise. If the rule of a convent should oblige its inmates to
creep on their hands and knees, they would, probably, in course of time,
find that mode of progression more easy than walking. There is no
reason why nuns should not go on all-fours, if there is any reason why
they should sleep standing. That way of sleeping is the way of a horse,
and so is that way of walking.
We have assumed that discomfort is the physical end proposed in
the adoption of perpendicular beds. To attain tbe desired object
regard should be had to the beneficent Law of Accommodation, which
the devotee should dodge, by sleeping alternately in the upright and
horizontal positions, and only so long in either position as it continues
to be unpleasant.
Stick Liquorice and Spanish Liquorice.
Narvaez is again master of Spain, and has commenced his career by
taking a stick and thrashing the King's brother-in-law. The Spanish
Government seems to consist ultimately of coups d 'etat and coups de
baton.
LOW RAILWAY LANGUAGE.
"Ma. Punch,
"Thj:se are fast times and I am a slow old gentleman. I have
not got reconciled to railways yet; they are too fast for me: too fast,
not only in speed, but also in regard to the phraseology which they
have introduced into the English language. Here, Sir, is a specimen
of disrespectful railway slang, extracted from an account of the return
of the Court from Scotland, which appeared in one of our Newspapers
whereof the style is usually correct and dignified:—
11 On approaching the King's Cross terminus the royal train was shunted into the
goods station."
"The Royal train was shunted! Allow your mind, Sir, for a
moment to dwell on the idea of shunting the Queen and the Royal
Eamily. Think of Hek Majesty and Prince Albert being shunted,
and that into the goods station. 'They were aeeotnpanied,' the Court
Newsman says, 'by their Royal Highnesses the Princess Royal,
Princess Alice, Princess Helena, Princess Louisa, and Prince
Alfred, and attended by Her Grace the Duennas or Wellington,
the Hon. Mart Seymour, Lord Panmuhe, Major. General the
Hon. C. Grey, Col. the Hon. C. P>. Phipps, Sir Jasl Clark, and
Lieut. Cowell, R. E.' And all these more or less distinguished
persons had the honour of being shunted together with their
Sovereign and her illustrious Consort!
"Sir, I can complacently enough imagine Mr. Pierce, the President
of the United States, shunted, ana Messieurs Maecy, Caleb
Cushing, and Corwine shunted along with him, and all of them
shunted into what, in their vocabulary is called the plunder-station, and
very happily so called. The process of transferring rulers of that
description from one line of rails to another may be denominated
shunting with propriety. But, Sir, let the Qubbn's English be used
in speaking of the Queen op England. I do say, and will maintain,
that 'shunted' is not a proper expression to be made use of relatively
in any way to Her Majesty, and I hope it may never again, in that
application, offend the eyes of your humble servant,
"Posipojnus DlGNBT."
"P.S. Talk of railway levelling! What language can be of more
levelling tendency than the railway term ' shunted' in application to
illustrious personages?"

Op all rogues and thieves, there's one chief, that leaves,
The others a great way behind him,
And among the grandees, in the list of M.P.'s,
Tis as likely as not that you'll find him.

He embezzles their all; then breaks: and they fall,
Along with the fraudulent Banker.
This rascal is worse than a common pickpurse,

Because he turns villain and traitor.
He sins not from need, but out of mere greed.

A WONDERFUL PLANT.

OT a few single,
as well as many
married ladies, are
wedded to Botany.
In the Botanical
section of the fair
sex immense ex-
citement has been
created by the sub-
joined advertise-
ment, which ap-
peared the other
day in the Times:—
fiREOSOTING
PLANT, complete,
for Sale. Apply to
John Clarkson, Tim-
ber Merchant, Birm-
ingham.
We apprehend
that the above
announcement has
procured for Mb.
Clarkson a weight of female epistolary communications greater than
the heaviest load of elegant little billets ever sustained by the table of
the richest young man in England on the fourteenth of February.
What is the Creosoting Plant P Is it, like the Vinegar Plant, a species
of fungus P Does it cause the .formation of Creosote in tome liquid,
into which it is put, or does it bear the Creosote in its fruit, or
pods, or berries; or is that substance got by tapping the tree P and if
so, do you tap the trunk or the branches P Is it, indeed, a tree, as one
would suppose from the circumstance that Mr. Clarksok is a timber-
merchant, or only a shrub P Does it bear any flowers, and are they
pretty P Has it any perfume P—in that case does it exhale the peculiar
odour of Creosote, or smell nice? Will it thrive out of doors, or must
it be kept in P Can it be grown in a flower-pot, or must it be preserved
in a hot-house, or will an ordinary conservatory do P Is it poisonous P
What are its Class and Order?
Driven almost frantic by the multitude of such inquiries as the above,
no doubt Mr. Clarkson tears up, crushes, flings down and tramples,
or tosses into the fire, letter after letter, to the number of thousands,
written in delicate hands, and mostly scented. We imagine him pulling
out his own hair by handfuls, enraged with the annoyance which be has
brought upon himself by the unfortunate brevity of his misunderstood
advertisement. He answers none of the questions, which appear to
him impertinent, all except the last, and even that is, in his opinion,
no concern of the querist. If it were, Mr. Clarkson would perhaps
reply by stating that the Class of his Creosoting Plant was Manu-
factory, and its Order British Utilitarian Brick.
THE WELLINGTON MODEL MONUMENT.
Let the intention of having a new statue of the Duke of Welling-
ton made, and placed in St. Paul's Cathedral, be abandoned. We have
too many statues of the Duke already. We cannot make a statue that
is not ridiculous, ourselves, nor, although we invite foreign compe-
tition, is it likely that we shall get any other kind of statue made. A
modern statue is a statue of a suit of clothes with a head on the top of
them, and, if there is a hat on the head, the statue is the statue of a
man in no measure except that of the man's face. It is a mere marble
or metallic dummy. Vain is the endeavour to idealise a coat, waistcoat,
and pair of pantaloons, and to endow boots with an ie3thetical cha-
racter: therefore let sculptors, in future, leave bootmakers alone to
exercise their taste in making Wellington boots: and let the artists in
marble and bronze cease also to vie with the artists in leather, in
fashioning Bluchers, Coburgs, Hessians, Oxonians, and Alberts.
In having another statue of Wellington made, we shall simply hare
another Gog made—if we are lucky. For Gog, and the same remark
will apply to Magog, is a first-rate specimen of British plastic art, the
spirit of which, when it has any spirit at all, is funny. Gog has some
merit. Gog is droll as well as ridiculous, but the vast majority of our
statues are merely ridiculous. Gog and Magog are comic statues!;
and well situated: the proper statues in the proper place—congruous
with the Lord Mayor s fea3t, and suitable to the Lord Mayor's
show. But Gogs and Magogs—comic statues of heroes and great men
—are unsuitable to our churches, and are neither useful nor ornamental
in our squares.
Instead of being a statue, which we cannot make, let the new monu-
ment of the Great Duke be an altogether new description of monument,
which we may contrive to make tolerably well. Let it be a public
building of large size and as much architectural beauty as we can
compass, and our architects may attain to not a little, by carefully
copying the proportions and details of some ancient or foreign edifice.
Exteriorly a palace in splendour and grandeur — a very different
palace from any that we nave yet built—let the monumental pile
contain, interiorly, an arrangement of rooms, adapted to form con-
venient habitations for the industrious classes, at a low rent.
Our British soil is dotted with workhouses, many of which have
splendid outaides. The Wellington Model Monument—a magnificent
abode of voluntary industry—would be a vast improvement on the
handsomest workhouse, both as to the outside and the in.
For the future, let all monuments to public men be architectural,
and consist of edifices such as that above proposed. Large towns
would thus be soon supplied, and adorned at the same time, with
Model Lodging Houses, and two birds would be killed (whilst many
human lives would be preserved) with one stone, or quantity of stone
or brick.
Cheap and good accommodation would soon attract all the merely
poor out of rookeries, Irishries, and other low neighbourhoods, leaving
only those who are low wretches in themselves, and not merely in their
circumstances, to lurk therein. This would be a great step towards
the abolition of the slums. The Yankee farmer, in mowing his hay-
field, leaves one little spot of grass uncut. _ This he calls his make-
grass. In it all the serpents and other vermin infesting the field con-
centrate themselves. When his bay has been wholly carried, the
American agriculturist sets his snake-grass on fire, and so disposes of
its venomous and scaly population. The slums, with the scum and
dregs of humanity, the rufiians, trulls, and scoundrel*, collected in
distinct swarms within their several limits, would be so many human
snake-grasses, although they could not exactly be made boiifires of and
consumed with their contained reptiles.
Monuments of the proposed Wellington Model are, lastly, recom-
mendable by this important and peculiar advantage, that they would
soon return a certain, and probably considerable, dividend to sub-
scribers; so that the liberal and philanthropic speculator, whilst
benefiting his species, might also adorn a Metropolis by a wise invest-
ment of capital.

and which that gentleman had forgotten, quite accidentally, to pay back."

HOPES FOR THE DRAMA.
HE Crit ic of a daily paper gives
great hopes to the British
dramatist; hopes, enshrined
in such eloquence, that we
must borrow the treasure.
Reverent reader, listen:—
11 Novelty In, after all, the true
secret of public attraction. Au
author mar bestow months and ymrs
of labour Id writing a hlgh-clasH
drama, which he hope* mar live;
and a theatrical manager may ex-
pend hundreds of pound* in placing
it upon the stage, but the chances ara
that however meritorious and costlff
their exertions, and however mtteh
they may be seconded by tlte actors,
empty fame, at the utmost, will be
the reward of the one, and after the
first night or two, empty benches
and a deficient treasury the recom-
pense of the other."
The calamities supposed
by our daily critic happily
never occur. A dramatic
author may, or rather might,
bestow months and years on
first-rate work, but we know
of no such existing fool: the
booby, like the dodo, is ex-
tinct. Again, where is the
idiotic manager who expends hundreds on what is never written?
Surely, our tender contemporary wastes a deal of sympathy for distreis
in nuhibus. But there is a manager "altogether tree from poetic ideas
or poetic pretensions," and he, 'says our flattering contemporary,
flourishes in Dniry Lane!

"Db. Y&bos was saying he had heard in Bohemia, 1 a singing horse—a magnificent
Baritone.' 'Nontemel a wheelbarrow-toae, you mean. Doctor I 1 Buppose Vibov
(good-naturedly continued our humourist), your musical horse had been taught to sing
by swallowing an oat that was musical?' It was the subject of general congratulation
that the mighty giant of the Conttitulionnel had been put down for the first time in his
life!"
"One night at the Acadtfmie, some venturous spirit cried eat' Bis' to the very first
bar of the prima donna. 1 Bravo 1' exolaimed our incorrigible Joker. 'Bis dot qui eilb
dnt.' The Joke ran like wiUfire through all the corridors, and determined the success
of the opera."
It will easily be believed, from the above brilliant specimens, that
Rossini is a perfect Joe Miller in eight or ten languages. He has been
known to beat Saphtr in German, Vivier in French, Gavakzi in
Italian, and Colonil Fhiffs in English. We are told, also, that he
makes a very tolerable joke in Sanscrit. We would offer tin- grand
Mattre de calembourgs an engagement ou Punch, only wc are afraid that
we should soon be eclipsed by such a monster jocular planet. In the
meantime it would be a great benefit to poor Rossini, if the French
and German papers would only for a short time leave him alone. The
one facetious tune of Toujour) Rossini has become a little tiresome.
"Scarcely a week passes but he produces something new; now a play, then a spec-
tacle, next a burlesque, again a melodrama; and anon we have opera—none of them
aspiring to the very highest rank, but all of them sufficiently good to satisfy until the
popular appetite calls for a new dish, and not mo expensive to render the withdrawal,
after a run of a week or two, incompatible with profit to the exchequer."
Thus, the secret of dramatic success is to aspire to nothing of the
highest rank; is to eschew "poetic ideas and poetic pretensions:" in
fact, to creep and not to fly. Arid if the "popular appetite" be satis-
fied, what does it matter; whether fed upon French efrgs, musty or
otherwise, or the milk and honey-dew of Farnassus? We have thought
this criticism worthy of attention, it is so sustaining, so elevating.
Who can wonder that we have such marvellously successful novelties,
when we have such ingenuous peas to anatomise and eulogise them r
And "novelty is, after all, the true secret of public attraction," as the
guinea-pig at the Zoological Gardens with a new farrow every moon,
squeaks contemptuously of the lioness with a single cub in "months
and years."
TOUJOUES ROSSINI.
The Continental Musical Journals are teeming again with the bon-
mots of Rossini. Mmy of our own Journals have become touched with
the same malady. If Rossini only delivers one-half of the clever and
stapid things attributed to bim.fhe can hare very little time left for eat-
ing, drinking, dressing, undressing, sleeping* or anything else. His whole
life must be passed in cracking jokes. However, we must take the liberty
I of doubtin< the paternity of several of these jokes. For instance, we
i cannot believe that a foreigner ever delivered himself of the following
j absurdities, which are but a small sample, selected at random, out of
the multitude that are daily fathered upon the poor Maestro.—
"They were talking in the foyer of the Grand Opera ona evening, about Lavjlteb,
when Rossini said ' There are two feature! In men I never could countenance, and It
wontd be difficult to say which of the two to the moral physiognomist is the most
unsightly!—the one being as vulgarly prominent aa the other is offensively flat!'
Being questioned aa to what tbey were, he answered, in a tone of excosaule triumph,
'The I'd of the vain man, and the Noes of the selfish man 1'"
"At a dinner at Greenwich, the conversation ran upon the London Mayoralty, and
some one said, that it was an institution exceedingly short-lived, when the Swan of
Pesaro exclaimed, with his usual readiness, 'Then I suppose the last of the Lord
Mayors will be Fix(y)ia?'"
"He related that he had dined once in the Desert off an ostrich's egg, which was so
large and so bad that he could safely agree with the old proverb, that1 Ce qui tit u/i au/
pour uTtfWas decidedly enough for two.'"
"Upon some one telling him that Ella was getting up a Musical Union, at which
moflte of all different degrees of goodness and badness was to be played, he exclaimed, I
'Ha! ha I I see—a kind of musical Ella Podrida f and he laughed for more than a;
quarter of an hour."
"Talking about Prefaces, he said,4 A preface should be, aa It were, the printed overture
to the book—hot an overture in music la listened to, a preface in print almost never.
The generality of persons skip a preface. It la the flight of wooden steps, which we ,
run up aa quickly aa possible before getting into the real booth of the fair.' Evi
TRUTH FOR STORIED WINDOWS.
According to The Builder, it is proposed to fill the clerestory
windows of Westminster Abbey with stained glass in the shape of
certain figures, amongat which are to be illustrations of "All Angels,"
and "Cherubim and Seraphim"—alluded to in the "TeDeumT If
this intention is carried out, we do hope that the artists employed will
exercise some little discretion in depicting those celestial beings. It is
impossible to procure a photograph of the spirits inhabiting the realms
of light, but an enlightened imagination may at least prevent them
from being delineated as inconsistent monstrosities. It is earnestly to
be desired that the windows of Westminster Abbey may not be ren-
dered ridiculous by being filled with representations of winged ladies,
and winged heads of infants apparently distended by water on the brain.
Such are the conventional Angels; such the regulation Cherubim and
Seraphim. Such chimeras as these are sufficiently disgusting even in
the print-shop windows, which are everywhere filled, at present, with
female figures, poised, or dancing in the atmosphere, over graves and
sick-beds whereby women and children are crying; the aerial damsels
having attached to their shoulders great wings resembling those of
geese. As if a spiritual being could want material wings for the pur-
pose of locomotion, and as if a material being in the human form could
have four upper extremities—wings and arms as well! Along with the
portraits of popular preachers and popular pianists, such fiddle-faddle
conceptions may, however, seem in place; but let them be kept out of
the pictorial fellowship of apostles, company of prophets, and army of
martyrs.
If fudge and fallacy are displayed in the windows of print-shops, let
not the windows of churches be stained with mendacities and delusions.
The primary function of a church-window is to admit the Light;
symbol of Truth. That light ought not to be coloured with the absurd
and the false. Otherwise "storied windows" will cast a "dim" but
not exactly a religious light—they will simply tell stories.
WANTED, A BANNER AND A CRY.
"Ay army," writes the Herald, "cannot march, or rally, and con-
tend without a banner." That is a fact, coming upon a man like a tile
from a house-roof: a fact so weighty and so cleaving, a man must have
the hardest of heads if he be not, at the same time, convinced and
crushed by it.
"The people are not changed." No! In 1835 and 1836. the people
did their duty. But what remains for them now P "The dilapidation,
the crumbling away of the Conservative party has been the work of the
Conservative leaders, and of them alone." This is so dreadful that
unassisted, we could never have imagined it. Dilapidated! Crumbled!
Only think of the flinty Lord Derby dilapidating himself! Imagine
the Marquis of Gkanbt, like a Bath brick upon a knife-board,
crumbling away!
Nevertheless, "the people have not changed!" Hurrah! All that
is wanted is a banner and a cry! Well, Mr. Punch comes to the
rescue: and promptly and, as he thinks, seasonably, suggests both.
Here they are:
Banner—Mrs. Gamp's Umbrella.'
Cry—"Muffins/"
Well—Yes.
For the Cesare witch, the other day, a horse of the lata Mr. Palmer's
ran first, and a horse of the late Mr, Cook's second. Surely the
"Cup" they went for must have been that patronised by the late
Mr. FiUikins.

IMPOKTANT MEETING OF CATS AND DOGS.
{From our Own .33sop.)
An article having appeared in a fashionable contemporary, strongly advocating the intro-
duction of horteflesh as a rival to English beef, great excitement was caused in that part
of the population which has hitherto engrossed tbe former species of aliment. The agitation
resulted in a numerously attended meeting of cits and dogs, whereat was discussed the peril
in which the threatened dietetic movement would place their supply of food. A common
danger produced a temporary suspension of the state of hostility usually existing between the
canine and feline races.
The cats at first proposed that the meeting should take place somewhere on the tiles, but
this arrangement did not suit the dogs, and it was ultimately determined that the concourse
should be held on the plane of a piece of open g<eund.
The chair was taken by a Skye-terrier, as much by the force of habit as by the suggestion of
the assembly.
The cbair-dog said that he occupied 'a disinterested position, inasmuch as his own personal
fare consisted of milk and bread and butter, morning and evening, whilst at dinner he
had regularly his three courses and dessert, being treated in every respect as one of the family
in which he held a situation. He could, however sympathise with his less fortunate brethren
and sisters, including—if he might be allowed to include—the feline portion of the assembly,
with some of whose race he had lived in amicable reltt ions.
A Newfoundland dog, whose expression indicated much sagacity, observed that if horseflesh
were to become an article of popular consumption, they (the dogs and cats) would get none
but what was rejected as unfit for human food; the consequence of which must be disease
or at least distemper.
An Irish greyhound vehemently protested that converting horseflesh into butchers' meat
would be taking tbe bread out of his mouth.
A bull-dog declared that .if he were deprived of his bit of horse, he should go mad. Let
Society look to that!
The Meeting was then addressed by a delegate from a pack of hounds, who insisted that the
proposed interference with their diet would be destructive to the best interests of horseflesh:
as it would ruin every kennel, and, consequently, knock up hunting. He deprecated any

THEATRICAL.
A Contract for Original Dramas from the
French.
To London Managbbs.—The Governor
of PentonvilltPrison is desirous of entering
into a yearly contract with all or any of the
Managers of the Metropolitan theatres for
a ready and steady supply of original dramas
from the French, executed with a fidelity
and despatch that tbe peculiar discipline
of his Establishment enables him to com-
mand.
The Governor having in his charge
several individuals, in no way capable of
devoting such minds as they have to mat-
making, clothes-peg-manufacturing, skewer-
cutting, or any other industrial branch of
employment,—are, nevertheless fully, and
perhaps a little more, than equal to the
translation of original dramas from the
French, with a despatch and at a price that
must defy all competition. By means of a
division of labour, and under tbe wholesome
fear of the treadmill, it is calculated that—
A strong, effective, devil-me-care drama,
in three ac*s, sp'ced with a little conjugal
infidelity, and flavoured with a sovpeon of
forgery, may be delivered, with the parts
written out, at a day's notice.
A domestic drauia, in two acts, good for
families,—in which un enfant terrible, in the
most atti-.tic manner, « holly characteristic
of the subtlety of the F.ench stage, causes
the separation of his father and mother,
with the suicide of one or both,—in twelve
hours.
Farces in any variety, while tbe messenger
waits.
The Governor of Pentonville trusts he
shall not be accused of any undue con-
fidence in his resources, when he states
that he believes he shall be able to send
out a very superior article; as it would
seem all but morally impossible that the
translators (perhaps he ought rather to say,
authors) of the dramas aforesaid could,
or should execute their work without in-
fusing into it something of their own
peculiar character. Hence, burglary may
come out with a [stunning boldness; aud
forgery send forth a peculiar flavour.
London Managers are requested to be
ea>ly in their applications, to be duly accom-
panied by an offer of prices.
Pantomimes (with models of the tricks)
on the easiest terms; and all warranted from

Advices from Spain inform us that the

shape uf a little girl; and that—
"The Queen has given to tbe newly-born Infanta,

LooiaA."
The cordon, of course, is "meant for the
recipient to play with. The little infanta

Cause and Effect.
It is rumoured tbat the Police in the

providing their own Suppers.

UNHEARD-OF ATROCITY.
A xew crime in these
days is a greater no-
velty than a new
planet; but the In-
quisition at Ancona
has discovered an of-
fence of which few, at
any rate, of our read-
ers, have probably ever
heard. The Santo
Ufficio Generate of
that place has issued
a document, addressed
to the inhabitants of
Mantua, under the
signature of the In-
quisitor - General, a
Dominican friar, by
name Francesco
ToMMASO VlCENZO
Airaldi, ordering
those whom it con-
cerns to denounce
within one month all
whom they may know
to be guilty of certain
impieties. Heresy,
schism, magic, incant-
ation, sorcery, blas-
phemy, obstruction to
the office of the Inqui-
sition, satirizing the
clergy, eating or giving others to eat. meat on Friday or Saturday, perverting Christians
to Jadaiom or Mahometanism, are the old-fashioned wickednesses which are enumerated.
The lis', however, contains one crime, which, perhaps, has hitherto escaped the censure,
if not the imagination, of friars. It is that "of haviig made either an express or a silent
compact with the Devil {patio tacito od espresso col Demono)." This remarkable edict has been

seen by the Paris correspondent of the Morning
Post, from whose account of it are derived the
above particulars.
Admitting the opinion of the late Me. Dove,
and that of the Ancoua Inquisition, that it is
possible at this •>•.<• of day to enter into a
compact with the Devil at all, one would never-
theless feel an insurmountable difficulty in con-
ceiving the possibility of making a silent com-
pact with him. For if a nun were willing to
contract an agreement with the Evil one, how,
in case silence wee observed on both sides,
could he know t>af the other party consented
to his terms? The new crime, therefore of the
Holy Office, does not, so much re>emble the dis-
covery of a new plane', as the discovery of that
nebulous body commouly called a bottle of
smoke, or the discovc-ty of a mare's nest.
It is also bard to und-rstand how anybody
could know that, another was guil y of having
had tran-actions, tacit or express, with the
Devil. One would like to be very sure on that
point, before denouncing the individual to the
Inquisition. To be tun-, if one man may have
a tacit understanding with Lucifer, another may
have received a t--cit intimation of that circum-
stance, in which cafe, his hest course would
perhaps be, a* one of 'he faithful, to denounce
the offender tacitly. It will, however, be time
enough 10 discuss this point whm Popery shall
have established an Inquisition at Oxford.
The Racer and the Plate.
If the introduction, among us, of horseflesh,
as an article of (ood, is effected, it will probably
become necessary, in ordering a steak at a chop-
house, to tell the waiter whether you mean a
rump-steak or a sweep-steak.
FACTS FOR THE MAINE LAW.
At the next meeting held by the United Kingdom Alliance for the
Prevention of the Sale of a Pot of Beer, the following unanswerable
argument in support of their views and intentions, will probably be
adduced. Most wonderful to relate, it was entirely overlooked by all
the speakers at the assembly la eiy held in the Free Trade Hall.
Manchester, by that not at all meddlesome, officious, fanatical ana
concreted set ot people.
A Maine Law has for ages, virtually prevailed in Turkey and other
Mahoinme'an countries. What has been the consequence? To
crime of all kinds—crimes of violence, especially—the peoples blest
with the ttmperate religion of Islam have been comparative strangers
—have been free from crime in comparison with other nations whose
creed has not, only permitted, but, sanctioned, and even consecated
the use of wine. Peace, gentleness, probity, purity unknown among
Christian wine-bibbers, predominate among the teetotal disciples of
Mahomet. The abstinence from the use of fermented liquors has
elevated the Turks, the Arab?, the Persians, the Moors, the Mussulmans
of Ii.dia, nay, those of Africa, to a degree in the moral scale high
above i ha ot the beer-imbibing British Public.
Mortover, a most unaccountable omi.-sion was made by Mb. L.
Hmworth, M.P., one of the ora'ors who discoursed wisdom on the
above-mentioned occasion. Mr. Heywohth was dt fending a position
which he had advanced in a letter to the Times, to the effect that the
licensing ot public-houses was a step towards their legislative suppression.
This statement, however profoundly logical, is not quite self-evident;
how, then, was it. that Mr. Hetworth forgot or neglected to state,
that Lord Palmerston is so struck with the soundness and sagacity
thereof, that, he is now having a Bill prepared for the immediate
abolition of the licenses of licensed hiwkers, of licenses to sell stamps,
and of licenses to sell tea, coffee and vinegar, because these licentes
are steps towirds the prohibition of the sale of those things, which are
all good—especially tea and coffee? Perhaps the honourable and *ise
gentleman may not be aware of the effect which his philosophical view
of licenses has produced on the counsels of the Premier, who, we have
our usual good authority for stating, fuither intends (with the con-
currence of ibe Archbishop or Cantehbury) to have marriage
licenses done away with, because, on Mr. Hey worth's principle, they
are a step towa d* the prohibition of matrimony.
The Bishops of Winchester are said to have formerly licensed certain
dens of ira "Orali'y. This fact, too, Mr. Heyworth strangely forhore to
cite, and to commend as a step towards the abolition of those dens, highly
creditable to the Bishops and the Church. Those prelates, by the way,
obtained, by reason of this part of their function, the name of "Win-
chester Geese," but the practice of the old Goose of Winchester
appears to be approved of by the wisdom of the present Member for
Derby.
A WIZARD VINDICATED.
Mr. Punch, last week, invited Mr. Harrison, the Wizard of
Leeds, to come to London and kick Mr Raphael, the Wizird of
Walworth. It is due to the former to s ate th»t big abstaining from
performing this act of justice bas been caused by a c;,,cumstance over
which he has no control. This circumstance is, Mr. Harrison's
having been committed for trial by the local authorities, before whom
he bas been charged with a brutal and dastardly outrage upon a silly
servant-girl, who had consulted the impostor. As the case has yet to
be tried, of course public judgment must be suspended; bat if the
evidence holds on to the bearing, that is, if the witnesses are not
idiots easily frightened, in the mean time, by terrors lest the revenge-
ful conjuror should bewitch them—the Bird of Fate seems likely to be
a Gaol Bird.

A Clever young Medical Sturent sajs:—"We should no longer
wonder at tradesmen adulterating their goods, when the very deriva-
i ion of the word 'trade' ought to act as a warning to us; for the report
of the Analytical Commission clearly tells us that 'trade' is derived
from 'tradere—to betray to deceiv'.' Consequently, a tradesman is
one who deceives, and when be sells you poisoned articles for pure
ones, there can be very little question of his oeceit."

eere is a kind of man
whose pleasure and

revels in the supposi-
tion that he is earning

pies him>elf in spout-
ing at public meetings
under pretence of
minding oiher people's
businrss, instead of at-
tending to his own.
He anVcts to combine
facetiousness with phi-
lanthropy. "I think,
Sir George, and

the proceedings of to-

both friends and ene-
mies i hat the Alliance
is still aliye." This is a specimen of his vivacious style. Again: "It is eometbing
to say that we are still alive after the perfeot cross-fire of leading articles, which ha*
been poured upon our devofed heads during the last fortnight, by the various organs
of the Press throughout the kingdom." He is not only brisk and lively, but
metaphorical—h-re is another of his brilliant allegories. "The good Alliance
ship has received fires from all sorts of batteries in all sorts of unexpected

places; and to-day we have been overhauling our rigging
and spars, and we find we are just as right and taut as we
were when we went into action." The Eentiment one
would expect, all this nauiical imagery to lead up to, is,
"Bless me, there's nothing like grog!" or some'hing of
that sort. No; it is one of quite a different sort: the
orator wants to have grog abolished. "Nothing like
slops!" is the burden of his song—and he wishes his own

However, there is some truth in what he says—bere is an
txample in point:—" It does not matter much, jou know,
as regards any amount of chaff—to use a vulgar word—
which the editor of the Times chooses to hurl at. us. We
are quite content to endure that, for the publicity he is
good enough to afford to us, and the admissions which
he always makes at the end of his articles." Thus much
of the foregoing is sure enough—that publicity will com-
pensate this k'nd of man for anything. The sort, of person
we mean is the piatform-r-poufer—the declaiming popu-
larity-hunter. The music of applause, and cheeis, and cries
of Hear, hear! is t he food of his love.

I
Cry for the Opposition.
A Conservative Cry is said to be wanted. There is
oneciy which would at least be characteristic enough in
the mouths of the stauncher members of the Conservative
parly, but the distinguished author of Coningsby himself
will hardly recommend his followers to cry "01' Clo!"
NEW GRESHAM LECTURES.
The first of a new series of Gresham Lectures was delivered yester-
day evening, at a tea-meeting of the City of London Young and Old
Men's Mutual Improvement Society, by the Bev. Mr. Juggins,
Chaplain of one of Her Majesty's principal prisons. These leciures
have been instituted by some gentlemen of eminence in the commercial
world, with a view to the increase and correction of mercantile
morality. The subject treated of in the opening discourse was that of
Penal Discipline.
The Rev. Lecturer commenced by referring to the numerous frauds,
defalcations, embtzzlements, and other cases of gross and enormous
dishonesty, which hc.ve la'ely occurred in commercial life. This was
an evil that could not be ascribed to want of moral and religious
instruction; therefore, the conclusion had forced itself on his own
mind, and that of others, that it was owing to a want of instruction in
a matter esteemed to be o" more present and practical importance. He
alluded to the suHject of Penal Discipline, to ignorance of which, more
than to ignorance of duty and doctrine, the immorality of fraudulent
bankers, directors, a-d confidential clerks was mainly owing. Sach
offenders were really not aware of the very great personal discomfort,
involved in the endurance of transportation, penal servi'ude, and
imprisonment wi h haid labour. So much had been said of the pro-
vision made in gaols for the moral and physical advantage of the
inmates, that ma> y persons had enme to regard incarceration as a
rather comfortable state of things. Now, this was a very great mistake,
whereof it was highly derirable that the minds of all those labouring
under it should be d'»abus»d; for so long as a rogue at heart renamed
in that error, he had nothing to restrain him from the commission of
j actual fraud, except soavs little fear of shame in the event of detection.
To dissipate that errontous notion was the object of the present
discourse. The Rev. Gsutleman then proceeded, at some length, to
detail the restrictions, inconveniences, and indignities to which
imprisoned criminals a c subject, and concluded by staling that he
would no w intioduce some of tho»e who had personally experienced
the unpleasantm sses winch he had been endeavouring to describe.
The lectme was illustrated by various diagrams and models of prisons,
and prison-arrangement , including the organisation and machinery of
hard labour; also by mauy interesting prints and engravings repre-
sentative of prison-die.
Several ticket-cf-leave men were then brought forward on the plat-
form in succession, and recounted their experiences of the hulks, the
crank, and the treadmill; expre-sing also their ideas and sentiments
on their general treatment, and on the penal diet-scale.
A returned convict, who, during the te'm of his sentence, had in-
curred the punuhwent of flogging, also edified his hearers with a vivid
description of his bodily sensations under the lasb.
Dr. Watts's well-known and beautiful canzonet:—
"Why should I deprive my nelghhour,
Of hid goods ngainst his will,"
was then performed by the vocilists in attendance; the company
j rining in the chorus apparently with fervour: whereupon the beverage
"which cheers but not inebriates" was introduced, and, after a most
delightful evening, the atsembly separated greatly refreshed.

"Twin Feats for One Strong Man."
Lord John Russell is stated to have made up bis minri to save the
country once more. He has prepared, we are told, a Reform Bill,
which is to cut the ground from under Lord Palmleston, and is to
p'ac« Lord John at the head of a strong Government amid the enthu-
siastic applause of an exci'ed nation. Meantime, ant by way of a
trifling feat to keep himself employed, he is gone to Piss, just to put
the Leauing Tower straight.

THE HARMONIOUS ALLIANCE.
The orchestra of Europe is tuning, is tuning,
And the discord and din are bewild'ring to hear,
For we all know the squeaking, the scraping and crooning',
That the tuning of instruments brings to the ear.
But as harmony,—so teaches concert experience,—
la bred of the discords tbat tuning attend,
Let us hope that this prelude of ear-racking variance,
In harmonious concord is destined to end.
There's big Russia his wind in the ophicleide trying
(From the Island of Serpents the instrument comes),
While Naples, the whistle of Picco outvying,
Tunes his penny trumpet to Austria's drums.
White-coat Austria presides o'er the brass, in the middle,
And Prussia comes in with his usual bass,
While Louis Napoleon leads, as first fiddle,
Spite of John Bull's reluctance to yield him the place.
Tantara! tantara! the trumpets are sounding—
Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub! goes the drum's throbbing roll—
Its mild notes the flute diplomatic is rounding,
But playing) we grieve to say, false on the whole.
At the violoncello, whose grumbling and growling
Most resembles the voice of the family Bull,
Peifidious Albion sits, sulky and scowling,
As if fain to come bang wiih't on somebody's skull.
But still through the trumpeting, fifing, and drumming,
The flute's soothing warble, the double-base snore,
I can hear other discords less tuneable, coming
Prom »ome deep-hidden orchestra up through the floor.
'Tis the low under-murmur of down-trodden nations,
Whose names European programmes may not show,
Poland, Italy, Hungary, mad with impatience,
And darkly preparing their concert below 1
What will corns of Buch conco-d? Harmonious alliance,
For Austria and Prussia and Russia may do,
Where the stick is the baton enforcing compliance,
And the clink of the chain makes the measure go true.
And France, with a sbrug, too, may follow her leader,
Forswearing the riot she ran in her youth;
But can Eogland of tht-ir blotted score long be reader,—
That score, in the key of brute force and untruth?
No—perish such music, and woe to its makers,
When God's thunder peals out the great war-song of Righ*',
When Justice and Truth, the twin-giants, throne-shakers,
From their subterrene biding-place leap to the light.
In that awful clashing of Powers and dominions,
On which side of the battle shall England be found P
God guide her free choice betwixt tyranny's minions,
And the wronged and oppressed whose blood cries from the
ground.
CARDIGAN'S LAST CHARGE.
The Eael of Cardigan, in a letter to a contemporary, makes the
remark in reference to Ma. Buck, M.P.:—
"This individual faas now identified himself with a low slanderer, whose statements
—dictated, no doubt, by some person much above his own position in society— were
the origin of all those falsehoods which have been launched at me."
The Hero of Balaklava—for he was a hero there equa'ly with
Privates Smith and Jones of intrepid memory—should have named
the person, above the position in society of his lo v slanderer, at whom
he hints. Otherwise some people, misconceiving his allusion, may
possibly imagine that he means the Earl op ~
Growl bt an Author whose Table has been "Set to
Rights."—"The proper Study of mankind" is,a room womankind
cau't get into.

LARKING."
E read in a new journal,
started with the meri'orious
intention of makirg English
people comprehend foeira
politics, and called the Inter-
national, that His Holiness
the Pope has been indulging
in a little amiable fun. He
gave a large party the other
day, and distributed presents
to all the guests. At the end
of the evening, he led his
visitors into the gardens of
the Vatican, and slily con-
ducted them to a little grove,
where they suddenly fouDd
themselves exposed to a very
ttne rain, sent upon them by
concealed machinery." The
concealed machinery we take
to have been the garden-
engine—the playful old Pope
having run behind a hedge,
and begun to work that in-
strument. But we want to
know whether the water was
preserved by the infallibility
of the pumper, from spoiling
the clothes of the guests,
who would naturally have got
themselves up regardless of
expense in honour of the head of the Church. "Was it holy water, and warranted
not to spot? If not, we think that the merry old pontiff ought to have obtained
the address of his friends' tailors and milliners, and behaved like a gentleman next
day in the way of compensation. Punch is the last person to censure harmless
amusement, and he likes Pius much better as the larky old host playing a water-
engine on his guests, than as the vindictive priest directing the fire of the French
Artillery and riding into Rome through a burning breach. But still, fair play is
fair play, and we hope, for the honour of infallibility, that
the Pope did the right thing, either by working a miracle
as well as the engine, or by giving his friends new clothes.
Any how, we fear there were in that garden people wicked
enough to say that they heartily wished the PorE's rain
was over.
POLITICS ON HORSEBACK.
Louis Napoleon proposes to hunt the stag at Compiegne,
and that he may have good sport, invites all the foreign
ambassadors to take horse with bim. However, that the
gathering may not seem too political, statesmen are sprinkled
with authors and artists. Just as if Queen Victoria,
determining to hunt the deer in Windsor Park, should mix
the French Ambassador with Mb. Planche, the Austrian
Ambassador with the lettered Ma. Laing; Lord Palmer-
ston with Mastin Farqutj ak Tufper, Baron Rothschild
with Mr. Robson as the Yellow Dwarf.
We regret, however, to read of tbe tyranny of etiquette
exercised at these meetirgs. The lanies are absolutely
required to have "two different official toilettes every
day." This is bad enough; but worse is to be told. "As
a matter of course," the ladies are expected "never to
appear twice in the same d' ess." And such is the humility,
such tbe meekness and obtdience of the female mind that,
up to the last despatches, no lady has been known to
express the least opposition to what must appear to the
generality of men as a most harassing order. L'Empire,
e'est le Crinoline!
Vane Aspirations.
Should Cornet Ames attain the rank of a General,
and in some grand engagement have to give the order
for the final charge, Lord Ernest Vane Tempest would
probably suggest, his evading the difficulty arising from
incorrect aspirations. The words of command, on that day,
would be, "H-'p, Guards, and Bonnet them!"
Motto yob, a W eit-Serveh.—" .First come, first Served."
MANCHESTER EINE ARTS' EXHIBITION.
Promises of contributions to this grand display of fine art and virtu
fall upon the genial Secretary, Mr. John Deane, thickly and sweetly
as Killarney rain. He is alceady saturated with delicious offers. A
few of the subjects to be contributed have been, after their incomplete
way, noticed in the public papers; but, hitherto, many offerings of the
highest artistic skill, and at the same time, conveying some great
national warning, some deep social moral, have been strangely passed
in silence. Mr. Punch if, happily, in a position to make good this
deficiency of information.
H. R. H. F. M. Prince Albert, in addition to other" contributions
too numerous to name, will supply the original model of the Albbrt
hat in German silver. It is fondly believed that the various Conti-
nental Courts will depute various field-officers to pay their homage to
an embodied idea that has done so much to raise the character of
the British soldier. We understand thaL under no condition soever,
will it be psrmitted to carry a copy out of the country.
Mr. Spooner contributes an anticipatory model of the "Ruins of
Maynooth College ia the year 1860." Mr. Spooner's Repeal Act of
the Grant is, every word of it, beautifully written in the ivy leaves that
grow about the crumbling walls.
"Statuette of a First Lord of the Admiralty," in biscuit, has been
offered by Sir Charles Napier; but its acceptance is under con-
sideration.
"A Model of the House of Commons, with dummy Members," in
French China, is the appropriate contribution of Samuel Laing,
Esq., M.P.
"Figure of the National Turn-cock/' in brass, has been contributed
by the National Alliance through Mr. Pope. This state-officer is to be
appointed, when the British state of legislation shall be assimilated to
the State of Maine.
"The Sword to be worn by'Mr. Charles Kean, when knighted for
his great upholding of the National Drama," ha3 been in the most
liberal manner proffered by Mr. Kean himself, with a further offer of
the faithful copy of the dress-coat (the tails lined with play-bills printed
on white satin) now in preparation for that truly heart-stirring
event.
"Model of the Tomb of John O'Connell," contributed by the late
Hon. Member, as it would doubtless have been erected had the Hon.
Member died on the floor of the House of Commons, as he "in'inded."
"Fancy Portrait of the Down-trodden British Farmer at the Harvest-
Home of 1856," done in distemper, and contributed by the Earl of
Derby.
"Copy of the New Reform Bill," written on foolscap in milk from
the Land of Promise, by Viscount Palmerston.
"The Skin of Whittington's Cat," as it came into the hands of the
Right Honourable the Lord Mayor Salomon.
"A New Cabinet, in Mosaic," by Mr. Disraeli.
THE REASON "WHY-.
By a most Unreasonable Fellow.
Teik reason why Barristers eat their terms is that they may know how to make
others eat thetr words.
The reason why our merits generally appear so large to ourselves is because we love
to measure them by the deficiencies of others.
Tbe reason why small services are willingly acknowledged is because it would
scarcely be worth while to be ungrateful for them.
The reason why egotists find the world so ugly is because they only see themselves
in it.
The reason why it is so difficult to get a good cigar is simply because "ill weeds
grow a-pace," and good ones don't.
The reason why Jews are not admitted into Parliament is on account of the enormous
quantity of gammon they would be compelled to swallow.
The reason why so many old ladies dress as though they were still yonng is because
the lashlons in the Mod*», the Petits Courritrs, the FolUts, and PsycMs, are all drawn for
young ladies. 'Wishing to be in the fashion, as every well-regulated woman is bound to
be, the " dear old things" copy faithfully the only examples that are set before them.
Un Feu Trop Tard.
TnE Moniteur, the French official paper, is, we observe, so good as
to give the English press, generally, warning not to write of the
Government of France, "with a view to bring odium upon that
Government." We accept the hint in all frankness, but really we
should as soon think of writing with a view to bringing coals to
Newcastle.
The Argumentum ad Hominem.
A Lady, whose husband had, for several Sundays following, been
jeeringly telling her that the great motive wiih women in going to
church was merely to display their bonnets, at last lost a 1 patience,
and said to him: Then, Sir, I suppo -e the reason why you gentlemen
so rarely come to church is because you cannot show your hats f"

SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
As a pif ce of news which may be interesting to those
who take delight in the pernsal of the Court Circular, we
quote the following from a provincial print:—
"The Prince of Wales continues his sporting at Osborne, with the
same spirit of enjoyment as his Royal father amidst the Highlands of
Scotland. The young Prince too has his lucky and unlucky days; some-
times bringing home his two or three brace, and sometimes, though but
rarely, he has a blank day."
We'leam from'this instructive paragraph that there exists
no royal road to learning how to shoot, any more than to
any other kind of knowledge, notwithstanding all the
pains which are doubtless taken to "teach his young idea."
Thn Prince or Wales, it appears, takes after his papn,
and as we have it here expressed in courtly delicateness
of phrase, "has his lucky and unlucky days." On his poul-
terer's account, however, we rejoice to find that he but
rarely is unskilful or unfortunate enough to have a blank
one.
We should be reluctant to drag to light a Royal weak-
ness, and perhaps suggest a text for Mr. Gough, or any
other of our Temperance pumps to spout upon. But we
must confess that when we hear that the young Prince i*
in the habit now of going out "with the earne spirit of
enjoyment as his Royal father," a pocket pistol instantly
flashes across our mind, and we begin to wonder whether,
as the context would lead us to infer, the "spirit" be
really the genuine "mountain dew;" and whether, as there
is no mention made of any water being mixed with it, the
youthful sportsmaa is accustomed usually to take it off
neat.
The Acoustic Edifier.
Lovely Daughter of Sitter. "It's beautifully like about the temples, isn't it Mamma,
dear,—just where the hair begins ?1
In order to afford the Reverend Mr. Sitjeigeon the
assistance necessiry to enable him really to edify 15,000
people at once, the serious and well-informed persons who
are accustomed to sit under him, are advised to enter into
a subscription for the purchase of a preaching-trumpet, to
be presented to their young minister, in order that by the
help thereof, he may contrive to make the requisite im-
[Artist shudders. ] pression on the ears of his rather large congregation.
A BISHOP AT THE PIANO.
A Friend has kindly ministered to the taste we have'for curiosities,
by sending us the following curious advertisement, which he copies
from the Durham County Advertiser of the 3rd of October:—
TO BE SOLD (at less than half-price), a Heavenly-Toned Piano-forte, made
by Bhoadwood and Soks, late the property of my Lord the Bishop. Apply to
G. H. RzKNisos, 12, Bridge Street, Sunderland.
If we had nothing else to do, and were in want of some amusement,
we think we should amute ourselves by taking train at once to Sunder-
land, and inspecting this "late property of my Lord the Bishop."
Before, however, venturing a bid for it, there are one or two mysteries
we should wish cleared up respecting it. In the first place we
should like to know if a piano be the better for having been a bishop's.
There are some bishops who are capable of almost anything, and it
perhaps is not beyond a prelate's power to exercise improving ibfluence
even on pianos. The idea is somewhat negatived, however, by the fact
of the instrument being offered now for sale "at less than half-price :"
unless indeed we may infer from this, that the owner is compelled to
part with it at almost any sacrifice. And what a picture we have here
of episcopal privation! Only conceive a bishop so reduced in circum-
stances that he is compelled at length to put down his piano! We
suspect, however, that the fact of the episcopal ownership is alluded to
only in the snobbish expectation, that it may, in some weak-minded
eyes, enhance the value of the instrument; and we think our character
as snob-haters is a sufficient guarantee that this suspicion would alone
prevent our being bidders.
Having for some time lived next door to a boarding-school, we have
had a pretty tolerable acquaintance with pianos, and have fancied that
our ears were conversant with all manner of toned ones, from the
shrilly tinkling " cottage " to the deeply grumbling "grand." But we
never, that we recollect, have heard an instrument whose tone we
could in any way imagine to he heavenly, although we certainly have
met with several whose music we have thought at certain times
unearthly. We are therefore somewhat curious to hear this Bishop's
instrument, and should be glad to know if its "heavenly tone " can be
properly brought out by; any ordinary mortal, or whether it requires
some "divine creature" to do it. We presume it has! been kept up
always at "celestial concert" pitch; and belonging to so high a
dignitary of the Church, of course, like Dean Swift's bear, it has been
used only to the "most genteelest of tunes." Indeed, the only proranu
air we can imagine it acquainted with, we take to be that not very
popular one (with the rest, at least, of the community)—" If I had but
Six Thousand a-year!"'

When the Nation he's schooled in abstaining,
Twines a wreath of green tea for his hair.
THOUGHTS IN WAX.
We feel that we do not sufficiently often pay our respects to the
fine art of Madame TpssAun. We are therefore glad, when quickened
in our duty by the invincible attraction of a great novelty. Now,
Isabella, Queen op Spain, has just been added to the waxen glories
of Baker Street; and although opinions may differ as to the precise
chamber most worthy of Her Majesty's presence, no doubt can be
entertained of the consummate artistic skill that presents the Spanish
queen to all possible admiration of her beholders. Her Majesty wears
a splendid Court dress, decorated with magnificent show diamonds and
other jewels—the pearl of purity no doubt being among them, dis-
cernible through a glass of forty-courtier power. Nevertheless, giving
all praise to the artistic creators of Her Majesty, we think sbe might
have been represented more to the life if a little more practical. Are
we not told when Her Majesty received the resignation of her la e
Ministers, that tears rolled down her cheeks, whilst at. th<i same time
she hid her laughing mouth with her handkerchief? Now, a little
more pains bestowed upon her waxen Majesty, would have given
her more vitality j worth, possibly, an extra sixpence from th-
pocket of the beholder. Garrick, we are told, could equally divide
his face between tears and grins; and why, by means of ea»y
mechanism, might not Isabella repeat the part in Baker Street, that
she has already acted with so much self-applause in Madrid P Again,
if the artist desired to give a poetic finish to Her Majesty, he minht.
place in the Royal band a receipt in full on the part of all English
creditors. Any way, it is a great satisfaction to the chaste, the honest,
and the wise, to know that they can improve their shining hours by
meditating the virtues of Isabella Segunda as enshrined in wax.
May she live a hundred years from the melting pot!
We know that to arrive at the glory of a pedestal in Baker Street is,
perhaps, the highest honour that can reward prosperous genius. M*y
we, therefore, put in a claim for the celebrated Mb. Spubgeon? 0'
course it would be necessary to surround the reverend figure by a
rail; and further to guard it by a policeman-visitor in ptam clothe*.
Otherwise, we c in all readily conceive the destructive effects of a fervid
enthusiasm. The pet of the pulpit, who has such familiar acquaintance
with seraphs, if not duly protected, would be picked tn bits by female
worshippers. His locks would daily disappear from his caput sacrum,
to be enshrined in lockets, warmed by the pious warmth of fair
idolators. "I'll break thy little finger, Hal, says Lady Percy in
threatening playfulness to her loved Hotspur. In like manner, young
gentlewomen, out of holy doting, might carry away every fiager and
thumb of the free-and-easy Ezekiel, who cries solemn things with the
self-satisfied out-speaking of a costermonger; and who calls sinners to
grace, as a tap-room visitant calls for "another pint."
Now these are qualities that, in a pastor and ma«ter, make many
worshippers: and, who can doubt it, is not Charles H. Spubgeon, in
the flush and strength of his twenty-third year, a sncred c ea'ure at
thousands of tea-tables? Who shall count the slippers woiked for
those triumphant feet, that walk over "the burning marie," the pil-
grim carrying as many sinners on his back, and looking waggish and
joking the while,—even as the strong fellow at a fair carries his load of
half-a-rloz*n bumpkins P Who shall count the months that have hung
upon the words of Spubgeon, smackingly receiving them as children
take do »m any quantity of brimstone for the sake of the treacle it is
mixed with? The name of Spubgeon is now associated with an event
that makes him a first-class hero of tragedy; and we think the house of
Tussaud will consult its dufy to the public, to say nothing of its own
interest, by immediately calling the preacher of the Surrey Gardens to
Upper Baker Street. We may add that a money-box duly labelled for
contributions to buy up Blackbeath, and cover it in 'or a Temple of
Spubgeon, m'ght be placed at the feet of the reverend image for the
offerings of the truly gullible.
We have one more suggestion to make for the pro6t of Madame
Tussaud, and the instruction and elevation of the public. Wby should
not Mb. Preston Brookes be promoted to the Cnaaiber of Horrors P
The man has fairly won the distinction, and why is it, not awardtd him P
Whilst there are individuals whom we conli name duly enshrined in
that Chamber, and whilst Mb. Pbeston Brookes remains unrepre-
sented there, the omission seems an unworthy indifference of foreign
merit.

"Constitutional Government was on its trial." Most wise,

the gag is the only symbol of tranquillity and order.
It is, therefore, our Imperial wilt and pleasure that the
Press of the British Isles will from and after the present-
date, consider itself to have received a first warning.
Given under our Iron Hand,
Louis Napoleon, Emperor of Ike French,
{and Ex-Special Constable of lie English^
THE ENGLISH PRESS-LOTJIS NAPOLEON'S FIRST WARNING.
Paris, October 2UA.
Whereas,—It having been made known to us that for some time past, various
infernal machines of the English Press have dealt in grossest calumnies on the
purity, liberality, to say nothing of the liberty of the French Government—calumnies
the most atrocious, inasmuch as the FiESCHi-like propagators thereof have not had
the courage to affix their names to their doings, the contrary custom distinguishing
and elevating the press of France,—This is to give notice that to the present date
we have thought the best answer to these slanders was our Imperial contempt.
We know, and in all the afi'ectionateness of the alliance, lament the indulgence
granted to. the Press of England by the mistaken tenderness of the English Govern-
ment. We, therefore, for the present, shall content our Imperial self with this
definite notice of an evil that if persisted in, may, as with a drawn sword, sever the
ties that now unite the two nations. We would have both the French and the
English people united, hand to hand, by the same handcuff; and both their mouths
gagged with the same gag. It is only by such an union, by such an iron alliance,
that the peace of the world can be guaranteed, and order assured.
It has not escaped the Imperial mind that, on a high and solemn occasion at
the Hall of Fishmongers, Albert the King Consort profoundly observed that
SONG OF THE DESPOTIC SOVEREIGNS.
Why with poor Bomba should you interfere?
England and France, can't you leave him alone?
Suppose he is a little severe,
Let a King do what he likes with his own.
Leave him alone, leave him alone,
Let a King do what he likes with his own.
Subjects were made for their monarch?, you know;
Many sent into the world for one;
You cannot deny that the fact is so,
And yet you 're for spoiling Ferdinand's fun.
Leave him alone, leave him alone,
Let a King do what he likes with his own.
Princes were wont, in the days of old,
To load whomsoever they chose with chains;
And none of their neighbours ever made bold
To question their acts in their own domains.
Leave him alone, leave him alone,
Let a King do what he likes with his own.
By a short method a sovereign, then,
Used with a troublesome fellow to deal;
He had him pitched into the lions' den,
And no one cried out on the animals' meai.
Leave him alone, leave him alone,
Let a King do what he likes with his own.
If he commanded the slave to be bound,
And into a fiery furnace flung,
Not one of the potentates, reigning around,
Against the decree thought of wagging his tongue.
Leave him alone, leave him alone,
Let a King do what he likes with bis own.
Wretches, who happened his wrath to txci'e,
He racked, impaled, or skinned them alive,
By a prerogative, and by a right
Of which you are trying a King to deprive.
Leave him alone, leave him alone,
Let a King do what he likes with his own.
Ferdinand may many dungeons have got,
Prisoners containing, perhaps, not a few,
If they in cold, chains, and misery rot,
Punished for nothing, that's nothing to you.
Leave him alone, leave him alone,
Let a King do what he likes with his own.
Teaching a small monarch ho w he's to rule,
You'Jl be dictating, next, to a loftier throne,
Yes, forsooth. Us you will next dare to seho ■'.
Won't let. Us do what We like with Our own.
Lsave Us alone, leave Us alone,
Let Us all do what We like with Our own.
Monster Cabbage.
There is a cigar-merchant in the Minories, who declares
that he had a cabbage so large that he got two bexss oi
"genuine Havannabs " out of it, besides two or three dc z -.n

pull he ever had, for it brought him in £3 15;. 0 /-, and if
he could have sold the cigars at the West-End, he thinks he
might have fairly doubled that sum.

A HIGH BUTLER.
There are many persons besides Mb. Disraeli and Lord Derby
who want places. Among them is a gentleman who thus describes
himself:—
AS BUTLER, &c, a tall respectable Single Man, aged 41, who has
high testimonials from families of distinction, and can be well recommended by
the nobleman he has jnst left.
Celibacy, respectability, and matu-e age are conditions obviously
desirable in a butler, but the advantage of procerity is less apparent.
A short man would probably be rather more at home in a cellar than a
tall one, and is not particularly likely to be less adroit in drawing a
cork. Perhaps the advertiser is willing to make himself generally
useful, under the head of "&c," and considers that his height of
stature might constitute a qualification for the footboard. StilJ, this is
not holding himself so high as a butler might be entitled to do who can
be well recommended by the nobleman whom he has just left; and we
hope oar tall friend will obtain a better situation than that which his
modesty is prepared to put up with.
Theatrical Intelligence.
The Alligator, who is to be the grand star of the Zoological Gardens,
next season, has already been engaged for the Princess's Theatre. In
is to make its first appearance on the banks of the Nile in Antony and
Cleopatra, which is to be revived for the occasion on a most enormous
scale of splendou'. As an instance, we can mention that every scale of
the Alligator is to be doubly gilt.
How ake Promises Made Fast ?—By nails or pins—according as
persons are in the habit of running away from their words. For
instance, you nail a man to his promise, and pin a woman.
A NEW CHURCH "VANE."
The Newcastle Guardian assures the satisfied world that Lord
Vane Tempest thinks of entering the Church. We know how instan-
taneously Luther was converted from riotousness to piety by a thun-
der-bolt; and the thundering sentence (so very unexpected) of the
Horse Guards may have been as summary in its effect upon the ejected
Cornet. "In fact," says our Newcastle contemporary,—
"In fact, it is whispered that his more matured, and chastened Inclinations now
incline towards the Church; a field in which he may be employed as honeBUy, as
honourably, and as usefully, both to himself and others, as in that of Mars."
Why cucumbers are nothing to clerical inclinations, if they can be
"matured" in so short a time. With this Irapidity, you may grow a
parson in less time than a dish of cress or mustard.
"As the noble family to which he may still prove an ornament have more than one
living in their gift, it is not improbable that this may be his ultimate and not un-
graceful destination, however distressing may have been the events which led tu it."
Who knows P The ejected Cornet may live to become the consecrated
Bishop; in which case the ex-soldier will still have proved his prowess
and success in a "for lawn" hope.

LONDON CJJAR1VARI.
[November 8, 1856.

"1' M MONARCH OF ALL I SURVEY I"
PARNASSUS POLICE OFFICE.
Yestebday, an individual of very pentlf manly exterior, of the name
of Murdoch, was brought before the worthy Magistrate of this office,
chafed with the reproduction, from a very mnsty shelf, of one
Vapid (known some Inree-quarters of a century ago as The Dramatist)
to i he great annoyanoe, if not worse, of a cro*d of persons, in the
Haymarket. John Baldwin Buckstone was also charged as an
accomplice.
Mb. Brown proved the fact tf the reproduction. He bad seen the
Vapid as exposed at the Hajmarket Theatre. It was a very
painful exhibition. Mbs. Bbown, his wife, a woman of a very lively
disposition, accompanied him, ana (here the witness appeared greatly
distressed) had never smiled since.
Mr. Jones had, unfortunately for himself, been present at the ex-
hibition in question. He said unfortunately, inasmuch as it had
cost him a situation of £50 a-year.
The worthy Magistrate desired the witoess'to explain himself.
Mb. Jones had no objection. The fact was he bad held the situation
of clerk in a mercantile house, of vtry stvere principles, in the City.
On leaving The Dramatist, he felt as though he had been drugged—
hocutsed, be believed, was the word. He went to bed, and ought, as
was his custom, to have risen at seven; but was so much overpowered
by what he bad swallowed at the Haymarker, that it took his wife, her
mother-in-law, the housemaid, and charwoman all together to wake him.
He did not reach the City until an hour after his time, and the partners
of the firm (they were strenuous hearers of Mb, Spurgeon) on
becoming acquainted with the cause of his somnolency, resolutely
showed him to the door; in fact, discharged him. He still felt very
weak indeed from wbat be bad taken at the Haymarket.
Mb. Robinson deposed that he had seen Vapid; and thought the
exhibition a very daring attempt on the proverbial good nature
of a British audience. In a sanatory point of view he believed
that such an i xposure was attended with the worst results, inasmuch
as it tended to create depression of the spirits, a sinking of the heart,
and extreme melancholy.
Mb. Mubdoch, as having reproduced the object in question, begged to
be allowed to ask the witness if he could state any one case in which
Vapid had so operated?
Mb. Robinson. Certainly. A gentlewoman of his acquaintance, the
lady of a distinguished sheriff's officer of the Hebrew persuasion, was
present on the first exhibition of The Dramatist, and had been in a
state of hysteria ever since. Even her husband couldn't arrest it.
Tne worthy Magistrate remarked that the case wore a very ugly
aspect; and, as it then appearel to him, the accused parties were liable
to be punished under the Police Act. However, he would hear what
they had to eay for themselves; and, warning them that what they said
would be taken down, and used against them, desired Mubdoch to
enter upon his defence. His Worship further observed that Mubdocd,
as an American, might, if be chose, be examined through a sworn
interpreter.
Mb. Mubdoch, with a very slight transatlantic accent, and with a
light comedy bow, worth in itself ten pounds a-week, said he trusted
that a pretty smart study of the snow-white swan of Avon had, he
rather guefsed, made him as far as words went, as thorough a Britisher
aii his Worship. He thought that in reproducing Vapid be was proving
himself a public benefactor. He considered himself the victim of a
base conspiracy.
"Hear! hear!" from Mb. BucKSTONB.'who was sharply reminded by
the officer of the court that he was not then before the foot-lights.
Mb. Mubdoch continued. He believed that his Vapid was a most
lively, most soul-stirring person. He had played Vapid at New York
for his benefit; when The Dramatist was expressly bespoken by the
united body of undertakers; who as a further mark of respect, posted
two mutes at the doors of gallery, pit, and boxes.
Mb. Buckstone observed that undertakers were 'generally the] best
judges of private boxes. (Roars of laughter.)
Mb. Mubdoch said he could if he liked, but wouldn't condescend to
the act, produce several witnesses who would testify to the over-
powering hilarity of his Vapid. One, however, he might name. He
alluded then to the respected matron who sold apples, oranges, a bill
of the play, &c-, in the pit of the Haymarket. She was quite ready to
depose that in his great scene—his worship would, of course,
instinctively know that he alluded to the china-closet ecene-rhis
Vapid had so far warmed the woman's apple-basket that more than two
ginger-beer bottles went off in spontaneous explosion. He thought
this the purest, the highest, and the most flattering criticism, because
most involuntary and unconscious on the part of the ginger-beer
aforesaid.
The Magistrate said he would certainly reserve the point of the
ginger-beer in favour of the accused. His worship then desired to
know wbat Mb. Buckstone had to say in his defence. Vapid had
been exhibited on his .premises; and he was clearly a party to the
exposure.
Mr. Buckstone (amidst shouts of laughter in which his Worship
did not disdain to join) said the fact was, be was one of the easiest of
managers. He wasn't a tragedy manager and didn't fine his cat for
swearing. No: and he didn't walk the stage at rehearsals, and cry
"silence" when his own boots creaked. No: and when be played his
great dagger, he meant his great apple scene as Sim in the Wild Oats,
he didn't make his actors and actresses wear list slippers that they
mightn't spoil his effects.
The Magistrate said Mb. Buckstone was wandering from the
point.
Mb. Buckstone said he knew it. "To walk was human, to wander
was divine." He could only say that he gloried in his art. He had
refused a baronetcy and a visionary income because hampered with
the condition of his quitting the stage. Why should be leave the stage?
If he'd been'made a Baronet without conditions he'd have bad " Bart."
printed in red in the playbills, with a bloody 1ST pointing to the dignity
of
His Worship said he must really call Mb. Buckstone to his
defence.
Mb. Buckstone—Certainly: always attend to the call. Well then,
Mubdoch said he knew there was still life in Vapid: but for his
(Buckstone's) part, he said, and still thought, there was more life in a
blue-bottle fly that was drowned in the small beer of George the
Thibi). The fact was, as he'd said, he was an easy manager, and being
at the time occupied with a new Spanish ballet

Mr. Buckstone. Si, Senor! A new Hispanolian ballet. I shall be

His Worship (with great dignity). Justice is blind, Ma. Buckstokb,
and cannot see a ballet.
Mb. Buckstone was about to observe, when—
The worthy Magistrate said he had fully considered the case; the
public must be protected from such exhibitions as The Dramatist, and
he should therefore sentence both the prisoners to three months hard
labour (with nobody t o see them) in Cumberland's Wheel of Fortune.
Tne parties, through Mb. Nebuchadnezzar, of the respected firm
of Nebuchadnezzar and Grass, gave notice of appeal.

And the union I prize,
And I hops long together we'll pull, John
Bull,

But you must be aware, John Bull, John
Bull,
You must be aware, John Bull,
That your Press makes too free,
For my notions, with me,
And some day out alliance may mull, John
Bull,
Some day our alliance may mull!

Bull,
France, too, had a Press, John Bull;
Which by timely duresse
I contrived to suppress,
With lead-pills, here and there, through the

With lead-pills, here and there, through the

And besides my lead-pills, John Bull, John

Bull,

I've gone swimmingly on,
And opinion is one,
For all but my own I annul. John Bull,
Yes, all but my own I annul!
I don't mean to dictate, John Bull, John
Bull,
1 don't mean to dictate, John Bull;
But I can't stand Free Print,

Free ears stop with gun-wads, not wool!
Just follow my plan, John Bull, John Bull,
You follow my plan, John Bull;
To teach tongues not to wag,
There's no school like a gag;
Then in silence and darkness we'll rule, John
Bull,
In silence and darkness we '11 rule.

You 're a politic man, Louis, Louis,
You're a politic man, Louis;
I'm obb'ged for your hint.
There's a mighty deal in t;
But I don't think our notions agree, Louis,
I don't think our notions agree.
You 're an Emp'ror I own, Louis, Louis,
You 're an Emp'ror 1 own, Louis;
You 're an Emperor high,
But a Nation am I,
And that makes a slight diff renee, you see,
Louis,
That makes a slight difference, you see.
If France by her vote, Louis, Louis,
If France by her vote, Louis,
Choose to merge in your name,
Nation'* being and fame,
To do so, of course, she is free, Lodib,
To do so, of course, Bhe is free.
But allow me to say, Louis, Louis,
Allow me to say, Louis,
That the votes for your crown,
Might have somewhat gone down.
If your Press had been rather more f i ee, Louis,
If jour Press had been rather more free.
But that matter we'll waive, Louis, Louis,
That matter we '11 waive, Louis;
Like you I hate strife,
And 1 love quiet life—
Provided that life be but free, Louis,
Provided that life be but free.
My Press is my mouth-piece, Louis, Louis,
My Press is my mouth-piece, Louis;
"Many modes many men,"
Mine's Free Speech and Free Pen—
Though in that, of course, you dou'i agree,
Louis,
In that, of course, you don't agree.
You've your own Moniieur, Louis, Louis,
You've your own Moniieur, Louis;
Wirh your notions it chimes:
But just leave me the Times—
Its broad sheet is the banner for me, Louis,
Its broad-sheet is the banner for me!

THE PROPERTY OF VERDI'S MUSIC.
he following state-
ment about Verdi
is from the Musical
World.—
"His great pleasure
consists in living upon
hia lands, in the midst of
Jds peasants,who all know
by heart the finest pieces
in Aw operas. At Brns-
setto the reapers perform
their work singing the
chorus ofRigoletto,Ernani,
Jm Traviata, and the Tro-
vatore"
This sort of hom-
age would be rather
inconvenient if ad-
dressed to all com-
posers. For instance,
Balfe would soon
grow tired of hearing
every printer's boy,
who was waiting in
the passage for cor-
rected proofs, wile
away the time by
singing "/ Dreamt
that I Dwelt in Marble Balis;'" and, we imagine that Dr. Mack at
would very quickly lose all patience, if, whilst, he finished looking at the
newspaper, the newsman's boy, who was shuffling his feet, ou's'de, amused
himself every day by shouting out, as loudly as he could, "There's a Oood
Times Coming, Boys." Auber would not be too well pleased with his
servants if they assembled round his bed-room door regularly at six
o'clock, to tell iiim to "Behold how Brightly Breaks the Morning," any
more than Rossini, we can fancy, would be delighted by his tradesmen
rushing into bis room every night before he went, to bed to sing to him
in a chorus "Buona Sera." If Brussetto abounds in so mauy cries,
it must be almost as bad as London; though in our melodious
metropolis we are fortunately spared the infliction of hearing nothing
but Verdi's music. It would only be a charity to send out to tiie
relief of these infatuated peasants a "Ratcatcher s Daughter," or to
make arrangements tbaf. they should be visited occasionally by
"Villikins and his Dinah" or else a persistence in their present
musical diet must end in madness. We can picture to ourselves how
thin, wiry, emaciated, and half-idiotic these poor VxRDi-stricken
reapers must already be!
THE SLANG OF THE SHOULDER-KNOT.
Why is a bride called a fiancee in fashionable nomenclature; why is
a wedding breakfast termed a dejeuner; and why are bridal presents
said to be of a recherche" description, instead of being simply described
as choice? Why, when the bride aud bridegroom are related to have
gone somewhere to spend the honeymoon, are we told that they left
town for this place en route for that, as if "on tbeir way" to that
would not be sufficiently explicit? Is there anything improper iu
the English words, and if so, would not Latin be preferable to
French?
What is meant by the statement that the servics was most impres-
sively read by the Rev. Mr. So-akd-soP Is there any peculiar method
of mouthing or spouting t he marriage-service wherein the impressiveness
of its performance is supposed to consist?
These questions have been suggested by the perusal of the account
of a fashionable marriage, celebrated the other d»y at the old Hanover
Square Temple of Hymen. We were in hopes that the footman's
French and the other plushisms of high-life reporting had died out;
but ir. appears that these plushy flowers are still flourishing in rank
luxuriance.
The Becluse.
Julia. Now, Alfred dear, I must leave you. I am about to shut
myself out from the world.
Alfred. Why, in the name of madness, Julia, you are not thinking
of retiring into a convent P
Julia. No, near, don't alarm yourself. I am only going to pat on
my new Crinoline dress.
A Musical Crotchet.
From Orpheus to Morpheus there is only the jump of a letter,
and yet there are singers who combine the qualities of both, singing
most somniferously. The supposition is, that Orpheus was designated
Morpheus in all cases when he was called in, as a kind of musical
nurse, to sitig perilous to sleep. %

THE COMING 'BUS.
The hoax has become too stale. Let the newspapers, although it is
the dull season, try some other subject; for we are heartily tired of
stories of the new omnibus; heartily weary of I he reports ol meetings
of inventors, shareholders, and delighted particles of the public,
gathered together, to describe and listen to and rejoice st the wonderful
new omnibus that is to-morrow at latest (if it has not done so already)
to take to the streets, and to carry Her Majesty's subjects on their
business and pleasure with decency and decorum; with ease and
despatch; sagacity on the box and civility on the knife-board. We do
not assert tlie absolute impossibility of such an event; but, we are no
longer to be worked into the easy belief of the quick-coming new
'bus. We therefore treat as pure fiction, or rather as impure self-
interest, the report of a meeting last week at Stoke-Newington, where
it was pretended that another new 'bus was exhibited. A 'bus—with
inch a length and breadth of sea', that even bully Bottom might take
his ease upon it, cosily as though in "a wood near Athens." A 'bus
where the space is so great in the centre that opDOtite knees shall no
longer grimi; a 'bus in which the ventilation shall turn even the sand-
wiches in the stout lady's basket into ambrosia, and give to the face of
the baby all the effect of "the milk of Paradise." A 'bus the outside
of which isjto be reached by an ingenious abridgment of Jacob's ladder.
A 'bus so light, so springy, that the horses while th^y dr»g it will
never be made to believe that they are doing work, but are merely out
upon pleasure, seeing life from.Bayswater to the Bank.
No, no; we are no longer credulous. We believed in the advent of
a French company who were to take the whip hand of our ignorance,
and teach us what civic travelling mi^ht be. Where have the com-
pany vanished? Dies Cayenne know anything about tbem? Will
Locis Blanc—(who has evidently offended Louis Napoleon, see the
Moniteur)—will the philosophic historian make inquiries? He will
oblige us. Not that we have any faith whatever in any possible or
probable improvement in our old constitutional 'bus. No: its very
mustiness is a venerable institution. Its wet straw is a thing to be
taken to our bosoms. Its forced pressure of seat brings us into a
nearer and dearer acquaintance with our fellow-creature; and if such
acquaintance be further tightened by an extra child or two, why the
circumstance only brings out our humanity, such as it may be, in
greater prominenoe.
We therefore cling to our old 'bus. Not that we have any fear of
its being Bupersed»d. No, no. The world may wait loDg enough.
The coming 'bus will only come with the driver, and he will be the—
Coming Man.

THE ALLIGATOR AT HOME!

disgust of the hippo-
potami, has received
a magnificent live
alligator, nearly fifteen
feet long, and pro-
digiously lively. The
animal has been visited
by a large circle of
rank and fashion.
Me. Macgregob, of
the British Bank, and
"purely a West-end
man," with , his com-
panion in advances,
Mb. Brown, of Tew-
kesbury, has attended
the alligator at feed-
iug-time, and even
both gentlemen have
expressed themselves
aatonished at the
animal's power of
bwnllow. For our
own part, we think
that, as things re-
main, even the alligator is beaten by the constituents of Glasgow and Tewkesbury.
CONSEQUENCE OF A MERE FEAK.!!
We have to announce the abdication of the King of
the Mountains, His Majesty Kanchinjinga, of the
Himalayas, in favour of a neighbouring potentate," not
a hundred miles" from Katmandoo, and whose name we
are not at present at liberty to disclose, but who will
for the future assume the style and title of the Highest
Mountain in the World. The alteration in the dynasty
has been brought about by the manoeuvres of Colonel
Watjgh, Surveyor-General of India, who may himself
be said to be monarch of all he surveys; but, as he is
nothing of the kind, the saying so would be simply
absurd.
[AN UNREASONABLE GRUMBLER.
M. Tubr complains of the Foreign Office for not
giving him a passport to Constantinople. Can't M.
Tuer go to Constantinople by sea from Southampton?
If he goes by land he may come within clutch of
Austria, and then!—
On the whole, we think M. Tube ought rather to
say of himself, when Lobd Clarendon prevents him
from running his head into the wolf's jaws—"Felix
Ter et amplius."
Answer to an Advebtisemekt.—" Do you double
up your Perambulators ? "—No, but; Mb. Arnold has
done it, in deciding that they must not come upon
the foot-pavement.
TURPIN RED1VIVUS.
The good old times are coming back, those ancient days that saw
The famed Dick Tub pen, Claude du Val, and Jerry Abekshaw,
At night we can no longer in inglorious safety roam,
Nor sleep in base security from housebreakers at home.
"Stand and deliver!" is a cry which England had forgot,
But we have now a substitute for that in the garotte •
And, if "Your money or your life!" is heard no more, instead,
A fellow with a life-preserver knocks you on the head.
A helmet he who walks by dark to don should have a care,
And a spiked collar round his neck, if prudent, he will wear,
A good revolver in his belt he well will do to stick,
Also to carry in his fist a cudgel strong and thick.
The wanderer by Jack Shepfard is at Shepherd's Bush waylaid,
And on the Green of Faddington the footpad plies his trade,
And Mr. Sykes familiarly denominated Bill,
The residents nocturnally alarms of dotting Hill.
"Oh, where can the Police be?" is the universal cry,
And Echo answers only with her regular reply,
Whilst, for all that useful body? as ihey 're said to be, of men,
We might all as well be living in a lonely Highland glen.
The Soldiers have come back again, by reason of the Peace,
And doubtless, in the kitchens, have supplanted the Police,
And therefore.the attention of the guardians of our fold
Cannot wholly be concentrated on legs of mutton cold.
Awake, ye able-bodied men, in azure garb arrayed,
Arouse ye from your dalliance with the stupid servant-maid;
Bethink ye more of broken beads, and less of broken meat,
That never was designed to be the object of your beat.
Let not old women's apple-stalls engross your manly rage,
Ticket-of-leave men rather should your vigilance engage;'
To you from them we look in vain our premises to guard,
Then what can you be thinking of, ye men of Scotland Yard?
The Lady and the Bear.
A Canadian paper tells us how one Miss Philbrick set a trap for
a bear, and how the bear bodily carried the trap away. We have heard
of cases of worse fortune; in which a lady, in her idleness, not only set
a trap for a beast, but absolutely caught him.
A NEW STYLE OP WEATHERCOCK.
Vanes are generally set up to show how the wind blows; but the
Brighton Vane has been put down to show that the wind from the
Horse Guards sets in the right direction.
THE LAND FOR THE LADIES.
In the King op Sweden's speech on the recent opening of the
Swedish Diet, the following remarkable passage occurs:—
"A j ust appreciation of the rights of women being a sure guarantee of her fidelity In
the fnlflltnent of her duties and of her mission in the family, it is my intention to
pose to you that unmarried women shall be considered of age at 25, which is
in lu
There it appears that up
irl
nearly all the states of Europe."
Sweden is clearly the land for the ladies,
to what is here considered the tolerably ripe age of twenty-five, a girl
is supposed to be in her minority, or nonage; in short, as we say, of no
age at all. At thirty, we apprehend, she is still looked upon as quite
"a young thing;" and, at about fifty as being "in the prime of life."
"Fat, fair, and sixty," is piobably the formula which, in Sweden, is
expressive of female maturity; at seventy a damsel begins to be a little
passe'e, and at eighty is considered to have attained to a certain age.
And these are your Friends!!!
First Friend. I say, what do you think? Young Rattlibbain was
in Spubgeon's Chapel last Sunday!
Second Friend. Then he thought it
some one declare that his preaching was
as a Theatre, having heard
'as good as a play!"
HOW TO PRESERVE ENGLAND.
With a certain Duke the remedy for all the evils in England was
Curry-powder.
With a certain Emperor the remedy for the evils of the English
Press would be Cayenne.
One who Stands by Himself.
The '* One Policeman or Herne Bay" has been solicited to join
his staff to that of the Unity Bank, and to allow himself to be nominated
its chairman, as it is considered that he must understand to a letter the
exact amount of strength that is supposed to lie in " Unity."
virtuous indignation.
Dr. Hale was casting his clerical eye the other day over the
advertisements, when, coming to the quack announcement, that in the
loudest brass heralds "50,000 cures," he exclaimed, with sublime
contempt, "The Pluralist!!!"
BELL S NEWS.
The Parliamentary Bell is already christened "Big Ben." As the
clapper remains without a name, may we be allowed to stand its
godfather, end call it "Gladstone," as without a doubt his is the
loudest tongue in Parliament?

EOMBA'S BOMBAST.
We have a word of friendly advice to say to
Bomba. Before proceeding to extremities, we
should recommend him to have a private con-
sultation with his cash-book, and see whether his
"sinews of war" be strong enough to bear one.
Naples', we are aware, is a reputed place for soap,
but it does not follow necessarily that the King
is now well off for it. And al'.hough Austria m»y
back him, even Austria's purse is not like that of
FoRTTJNATUS.
We are induced in our benevolence to say thus
much, beciuse we see that a contemporary gives
it as a piece of " latest intelligence," that—
41 In effect the King of Naples snaps his Sogers at all
foreign interference with his domestic poucy."
This, we learn, is " communicated" by a writer
on the spot, as a bit of sober Neapolitan opinion,
and not in any way Italian-irony. Well, all we
can say is, the King oj? Naples may snap his
fingers if he chooses: but let him take heed, lest
by doing so he burn them.

EXAMINE YOUR LAWYERS.
The idea of submitting Barristers to a severe examination, prior to
allowing them to practise upon us, has occasioned great indignation in
some quarters. The Barristers do not object to the playful little
inquiries instituted in some of the Inns of Court before the advocate is
"called," as who indeed, unless he were a fast young officer, would be
terrified by such questions as these P
Who founded Home?
Who was the first King of England f
Construe the following passage, "Nox erat, lunuquefulgebat?
How many quarters of the world are there?
How many shillings—and pence—are theie in a guinea P
Which is to be feared, thunder or lightning?
But these gentle evidences that the candidate has received a liberal
and practical education are not deemed enough by law reformers, and
they propose a real, stern examination for Barristers, after the fashion
of Oxford and Cambridge. The profession is wrathful, and declares
that the fitness of an advocate is to be judged by the public and by the
solicitors, and not by examiners at a green table. There is something
in this, and certainly were we so unhappy as to have to go to law, we
should probably select as our champion the Barrister who "gets ver-
dicts," and—such is human nature—we should prefer him to the most
accomplished of scholars and most exact of logicians. For one wants
certain tools to do certain work.
There is, however, one form of examination which we think the public
ought to demand. We will waive scholarship and logic and eloquence,
but we demand a sort of honesty. We are entitled to have our Bar-
risters passed through such an ordeal as will show whether they are
fit to be trusted—morally—with our hopes, fears, hates, desire1', and
guineas. We cannot see why the Law Reform Association should not
recommend some such examination as this, for every young Barrister
who wishes to be let loose upon society.
Would you consider it honest to undertake to be in two places at
once P
Would you risk clients' interests by taking briefs to which it is
impossible for you to devote sufficient attention?
Would you change sides in the course of a cause, and for the sake of
higher fees, carry over to the enemy information acquired from your
first briefs P
Would you, if ordered by the Court to return a client's fees, do your
best to weary him out of his claim, or to cheat him?
Would you "eagerly assent to a reference," to save yourself the
trouble of arguing out a just but complicated case of right?
Would you appeal to Heaven, professionally, as certain of your belief
in what you knew to be a lie P
Would yi.u "hng" an attorney to seduce him into entrusting you
with a brief?
Would you give an "opinion" calculated to promote litigation in
which you would be employed, rather than crush at once an untenable
or unjust claim?
Would you let an attorney mark your briefs with higher fees than he
pays yon, in order to secure his future patronage, and to help him to
cheat bis client?
Would yon, under any circumstances, refuse to advocate the interests
of an evident rascal?
Respectfully committing this view of the subject (with apologies, if
we have taken a tone of higher morality than he should have done) to
the consideration of the authorities of the law, Pvnch will close with
a hope that, the day is not far distant when one civilised man will be as
ashamed of defying his fellow-creature to a law combat, as he now is
of challenging him to a duel.
DUALITY AND PLURALISM.
In the Chapter House, St. Paul's Churchyard, on the occasion of the
late election (as it is jocosely called) of the new Bishop or London,.
we find, present,
"The Vf.nbraw.k William Hals Hale, Archdeacon of London, and Vicar of
St. Giles, Cripplegate."
Is the name of this reverend gentleman really Hale Hale, or has
Hale been added to Hale by some wag, in order to insinuate the
suggestion that Archdeacon Hale possesses Church preferment suffi-
cient for two Hales P
A Curiosity of Trench Literature.
To our great astonishment we find that there is a French paper,
called "La Verite." Now, in the sacred name of Truth, how, with the
press handcuffed and gagged as it is in France, can a paper like the
Virite make good its title? But, perhaps, it is made up of a list of all
the criminals, who have been found guilty of speaking the Truth, and,
consequently, consists exclusively of nothing but a huge mass of
"Accidents and Offences P"

FASHIONABLE RIGGING.
DISSENTERS AND DISSENSIONS.
The Roman Catholic priests have long been celebrated for their
proficiency in vituperation, and some of the leading clergy of the
Anglican church have shown that they also know how to administer
abuse at need. It is instructive to see that the Dissenting teachers are
determined to assert equal rights to the endowments of Billingsgate.
The Congregational Union was to have met at Cheltenham the other
day, but the state of feeling among the Ministers rendering so com-
bustible a convocation dangerous, the idea was abandoned, and we read
that a very distinguished schismatic, the Rev. Dr. Campbell, saw fit
to publish concerning that other shining light of dissent, the Rev. Dr.
Binney, "that there was no human being in existence who could say
so much that was false, scurrilous, and malicious in the same amount
of space." We have heard that the Bishop or Exeteb has written to
Dr. Campbell to say, that though the latter, not being a member of
the Cnurcb, is of course a blinded idiot on his way to perdition, still
the Bishop honours a man who endeavours to do his duty in Christian
love and sincerity, and should the Doctor be near Exeter the hospi-
talities of the Palace are at his service. Similar invitations are en
route from Doctors Ccllen and Wiseman. Mr. Punch is charmed to
see that the Nonconformists, who are celebrated for their laudation of
civil and religious liberty, have learned to take liberties which are at
once so religious and so civil.
MUSIC IN PIEDMONT. 1
It promises badly for liberty in Italy, when the people make idols of
singers, and forget all citizenship in adoration of a Prima Donna.
Last year the Turinese worshipped Piccolomini; her cough in
Traviata. would stir them more than a trumpet. We now learn that
the lovely little lady who, in England, has boxed the ears of public
morality with such an enchanting grace that even morality does not
frown but giggle at the assault,—we now learn that Piccolomini is
dethroned in favour of a new Queen, one Signoba Virginia Bocca-
badatb! There are no such helps to Austria in Italy as Italian Prime
Bonne. People who go frantic for music, are apt to be a little cool
upon freedom. In this way, how often in Italy has Liberty herself
oeen strangled with cat-gut!
A Ladt arrayed in the height of existing fashion presents an interest-
ing spectacle. Her dress, piled tier above tier, renders her an example
of Beauty in tiers of muslin. This peculiar arrangement of female
costume affjrds facilities for the introduction of a new pattern, which
would probably become popular. Each tier might be figured with.
representations of the portholes of a man of war, carrying guns. Thus
decorated with the semblance of decks, the little "craft might sail
down upon the spectator with striking effect. In this nautical trim a
young lady might exhibit herself at a fancy dress ball in the character
of the Saucy Areihusa—unless it may be objected that to come it, in
Cockney phraseology, so strong as this, wonld be unsuitable to the
character of the weaker vessel.

BUBBLE-BANK BOOK-KEEPING TAUGHT IN SIX LESSONS.

stock swindles. Having for some years devoted bis most carefnl attention to the sub-
ject, the Professor can with confidence
hie system (which is founded
iy upon the Scotch, but differs from It widely in its integrity and principles.)
as being at once safe, Bimple, and effective. It Is remarkable, especially for the facili-
ties It offers for cooking the accounts, as it entirely prevents any possibility of checking
them. It allows, therefore, of overdrawing without danger of detection, and at the
same time offers most peculiar advantages to those who may avail themselves of this'
director's privilege, aud may be afterwards accused of having fraudulently done so.
By its complete mystification of all matters of account, it will enable any so calumni-
ated person to declare that he was totally unconseions how his debit really stood, and
defy the most expert accountant to make out the contrary. The Professor guarantees
moreover, from bis personal experience, that no unpleasant consequences |ever will
result from this or any other advantage of his system, the liability of those who prac-
tise It being strictly limited in all respects to the harmless jurisdiction of the civil
courts.
To clerks of gentlemanly habits and expenses the Professor's System will be found
Invaluable; as it will enable them, by the opportunities It affords for perquisites, to
live on a salary of a hundred a-year, in the style and at the rate of at least a couple of
thousand. But it Is to managers, perhaps, that the Professor's method will be found
most advantageous, since it suffers them to do exactly what and whom they please, and
in short, confines their work to 11 working of the oracle." This operation is, however,
much facilitated by the Professor's plan of double-shuffle entry; which, by the addition
of a private " little book" to those which are kept for public business and Inspection,
greatly assists the Manager in all matters of subtraction, and enables him in any
financial process which he thinks will not bear daylight, to keep it just as dark as a
Caxkron obscurer.

THE EMPEROR OF THE PRESS.
Having effectually fragged the French Press,
Louis Napoleon is desirous to operate upon
the English. Oar contemporaries, however,
will not submit so tamely to have their mouths
stopped—even with French cambric. The Em-
peror, it is hinted, would like to fee the Time*
reduced to the condition of the Monifeur; its
leading articles suppressed, or written by him-
self, no foreign or political intelligence inserted,
and the only letters from its "own correspon-
dents " mutes. Take a large slice of the Family
Herald, with a rechauffe of all the stale news of
the Standard, add a few mares'-nests from the
Morning Advertiser, flavour with Police Reports
and " Movements of the Court," and then fill up
and garnish with a nineteenth chapter of a
thirty-second-rate novel ("to be continued in
our ntxt"), rather highly seasoned with a-
sprinkling of pros sel and a spice of the morality
of the ultra-KuGENE Sue school,—such is the
recipe that Louis Napoleon would now, in his
imperial favour, give us, for that essentially
French dish, which we hooe we may never see
introduced to England, which we may christen
L'oie rotie cFtut premier Journal—or. as we may
put it in plain English, a "Leading Journal that

A Nice Calculation.
A Wallsend gentleman, of great experience
in the trade, and a constant attendant on
the preaching of Mb, Spdbgeon, has calcu-
lated that, on an average, the reverend teacher
u«es in every sermon no less than three tons
of coals, and all red hot. Last winter, poor
people were known to warm their hands at his

A LADY IN A PASSION.
An Indignant Mother presents her compliments to Mr. Punch,
and I must insist upon your taking notice of Mb. Arnold's scandalous
and infamous decision about Perambulators. Who is Ma. Arnold,
an Indignant Mother would like to be informed, that he is to take the
insolent liberty of making such observations P He has pronounced
a judgment (and pretty judgment he must possess to say such a thing)
that Perambulators have no right on the foot-pavement. No right on the
foot-pavement, and where, I ask you, are they to go P Is my precious
tootsicum's carriage (not that he ought to be in one, for it is much
wholesomer for the girl to carry him, as he gets more exercise, besides
the warmth of her arms, hut then my lady is so liue and lazy that she
would put him down at the end of every street) to be sent into the
road, to be run over every minute by Pickpobd's Vans and Hansom's
Cabs? I think I see him among them, precious pet! And what for? I
should like to know. That great strong men, who are much fitter to go
into the road than he is (the darling!), may be able to get on a little
faster, or may not be obliged to look round and see that the wheel does
not come against their seventeen-and-sixpenny trowsers? Likely! But
an Indignant Mother thinks that, if anything can be worse than such
wicked tyranny, it is the reason which this Mb. Abnold pretends to
give to justify it. I suppose he calls it logic. He actually said that if
a Perambulator might come on the foot-path, why not a wheelbarrow?
Such low vulgar insinuations are beneath contempt. As if my heavenly
tootsicums were to be named in the same day with a lot of nasty
potatoes, or perhaps cat's-meat! Mb. Abnold is quite unfit for his
situation, and ought immediately to be prosecuted by the Lord Chan-
cellor, and brought before Parliament, or the Criminal Courts, for I
am quite sure that many poor creatures are punished day after day for
much less things than telling the world (where there are brutes enough
already) that infants are no better than potatoes, and driving them
(pretty things !) under the wheels of those horrible Vans, which ought
to be all put down by Act of Parliament, if Parliament ever made any
laws that were good for anything. Requesting that you will dress up
these hasty remarks, and make them much strong er, with a picture
of Mr. Arnold being horsewhipped as he ought to be, an Indignant
Mother leaves the matter in Mr. Punch's hands.
"P. S. If Mr. Arnold, or such like people, would make the horses
and carts that frighten the poor children with noise and rumbling, be
kept at home until after the time the children come in-doors, they
would do more good than by such ridiculous conduct."

Bigot. " I SEE WO REASON WHY GUNPOWDEB TbEASON SHOULD HEVBR

[This print of the Protestant Bigot of (he 19th Century, it dedicated to
hit Eminence Cardinal W—sem—N.
A PROPHETIC SCENE ON TOWER-HILL.
(From the Morning Herald, of April the First, in the Year .)
The fearful event that has just delivered England from the interested
machinal ions of one of the boldest, one of the least scrupulous, and
let us add, one of the most adroit Ministers that ever pursued, like the
snake, a tortuous policy for his own advancement,—will, we profoundly
hope, operate so terribly as an example for all time, that sever may the
yesterday's spectacle of Tower-Hill be again repeated. But the blow
is struck! And at this solemn moment, laying our hand upon our
heart, we do not shrink from the responsibility of the part we have
played in the tragedy, knowing as we do, that in our pursuit of the
noble Viscount to Tower-Hill, we have followed no meaner motive
than our love of country, to say nothing of our philanthropy for uni-
versal human kind.
Bat it was impossible that the unhappy nobleman could continue to
struggle against the accumulated proofs of treason that it was our
agonising duty to press against him. The Morning Herald had but one
course to pursue, even if that course, in its'inevitable end, drove a Prime
Minister of England to the block. Let history judge and acquit us of
all personal ill-will, all mere party malice. No: we do not scruple to
affirm that there were many qualities in Viscount P—lk—st—v that
had our cordial respect: would they had been sufficient to have saved
him from a vengeance that was made sacred by its cause! But the end
of the unhappy statesman, it is to be hoped, will remain a warning to
all future Ministers, that it is not given to them to betray England and
escape the avenging wrath of the Morning Herald.
With the mournful scene of yesterday ensanguined in the recollection
of tens of thousands—(for never, perhaps, was Tower Hill so crowded)
it is not our purpose to dilate upon the circumstances that led to the
tragedy: nevertheless, we may be permitted to cast back a retro-
spective glance on Westminster Hall prepared for the trial of the fallen
Minister. We are free to confess that Viscount P—lm—st—N bore
himself with all his constitutional ease and even gaiety on that mournful
occasion. At the very time that the toils—our toils—were closing
around him, and the faces of his friends fell and darkened with anti-
cipation (one middle-aged peeress was removed from the gallery in
hysterics)—at that very tine, the pleasant audacity of the Viscount did
not forsake him; and when he entered upon his defence, he took up the
theme with the same grace and vivacity with which it was his wont to
make a congratulatory nuptial speech at a bridal breakfast.
But the proofs were all too damning. We had proved as clear as
light the many treasons of Viscount P—lm—st—n with Russia. We
showed how in the Ota >eitan difficulty he had been secretly in accord
with the court of St. Petersburg to precipitate the Syrian war, and to
accomplish the Spanish marriages. Well, and what is the result? Has
not Russia—so long estranged from Spain—acknowledged the throne
of Isabella the Second?
Did he not also defeat a treaty between Austria and Turkey, for the

But the axe has fallen: treason has been punished! England has
been avenged! And for the important part the Morning Herald has
taken in the tragedy, we trust that we have too much real patriotism
to make any boast of that. No! all we claim of the country is the
admission that, fearless of every consequence, we have done our
duty.
, To return to the Tower. From the time that the noble prisoner
entered through Traitor's Gate, his spirits never deserted him. This
allowance we owe to truth and to the memory of the man. He was
allowed every privilege consistent with safe-keeping; and it affords a
pleasing aspect of political life to know that men of all parties sent in
their cards and consolations. For ourselves (we make no boast of the
trifle) we took care that an early copy of the Morning Herald was placed
upon the breakfast table of the fallen statesman; and derive some
comfort from the conviction that more than one of our leaders shed a
ray of departing sunlight on his approaching end.
His Lordship slept; very soundly, and breakfasted with his usual
appetite. Indeed, w glegret that as historians it is our duty to chronicle
a jest uttered by the unfortunate nobleman whilst at table, betraying,
as we think, a levity very unseemly on the occasion. Carving a cold
partridge, the prisoner raised a piece of the breast towards his mouth,
winked, and said "game to the last." It was also observable that he
ate more than his usual supply of Russian caviare, thus showing the
ruling passion very strong even in the Tower. He had also cut the
Russian eagle in the stone wall of his dungeon.
At nine o'clock several bishops, the High Priest of the Jews, with
several distinguished Wesleyans and Baptist ministers, were present,
moved to offer their services. The noble Viscount regretted that he
could not see them all, but thanked them equally for their solicitude
and good-will.
As the clock struck ten the hair-dresser was introduced, who pro-
ceeded to curl the noble Viscount's hair j for which the noble prisoner
gave the man a five-sovereign piece (the gold, no doubt, originally from
the Ural Mountains).
The fatal moment having arrived, his Lordship in the most affable
manner declared himself quite ready. Never, perhaps, did Tower-Hill
display so imposing a spectacle. The house-tops were thronged; and
at least half-a-dozen peeresses were pointed out to us who had paid
twenty pounds a-piece tor a seat in an attic window.
The noble Viscount was dressed in a rich court suit; and it was
observed that the waistcoat was somewhat ostentatiously embroidered
with heart's-ease. For our own part, as Christians, we can only hope
that the heart's-ease was not all outside.
As the clock struck eleven, 1
And now all is past, this much we must say of the departed states-

good, however mistaken may now and then have been his policy. But

EXHIBITION OF THE LORD MAYOR ELECT!
Below is described a ceremony which a simply benevolent mind
would be pained to witness :—
11 Pbebrntation op the Lord Mayor Elect.—At 11 o'clock yesterday, according
to custom, the Lotto Mayob elect was presented to the Lord Chancellor for Heb
Majesty's approval. The Lord Mayob was introduced to the Lobd Chancellor, at
his mansion in Upper Brook Street, Grosvenor Squatc. The Recorder, in a brief
address, set forth the services that the worthy Alderman had performed in his various
offices of Common Councilman, and Deputy of the Tower Ward", for which he was
elected Alderman on the death of Alderman Lucas, as also his services as Magistrate
of the City of London. The learned Recorder also entered into a brief statement of
the success of the commercial pursuits of the Lord Mayor elect, which bad raised him
to the proud position of being chosen Lord Mayor of the first city of the world. The
Lord Chancellor, in expressing on the part of Hre Majesty her approval of the
choice of the Livery, congratulated the Lord M ayor elect on his elevation. The Lord
Mayob elect, the Recorder, the Sheriffs, and the other Civic functionaries, then
withdrew."
The scene above reported is enacted annually, and everybody who
attains to what is called "the proud position of being chosen Lobs
Mayob of the first city in the world," has also to occupy the extremely
undignified position assigned to the Lord Mayor elect in the above
narrative. The heir annually apparent to the Civic Crown has always,
within a few days of his accession to the throne of the City, to be
brought up before the Lord Chancellor, and exhibited and described
to that noble and learned functionary by the Recorder. As if the
subject of the Recorder's remarks were incapable of giving an account
of himself, and stating his own antecedents—birth, parentage, lineage,
in case of his having any, education, and commercial career, in decent
English. Tradition, derived from barbarous antiquity, appears to have
prescribed, that Lord Majors shall be presumed to be, as sucb, inca-
pable of rational utterance, sure to omit, or misapply, the aspirate, and
certain to confound the letters v and w—therefore unfit to open their
mouths, except to eat, in any educated presence. The eleot Lord
Mayor is explained to the Lord Chancellor by the same kind of
prolocutor as the one who, according to the former Matthews, be-
friended the school-boy, by informing those whom it concerned, that
this young gentleman's name was Norval. We should somewhat like,
although, for the reason above given, it would a little hurt our feelings,
to witness the burlesque performed by the Recorder for the enter-
tainment of the higher legal functionary.
Left to imagination for an idea of the scene, we conceive the learned
gentleman provided with a long wand, and employing it, in his demon-
stration, after the manner of the showman of a menagerie. Continuing
his discourse in terms reverently suppressed by the reporter, we fancy
him to proceed in something like the following strain, as though in
allusion to an elephant. "We shall now cause the animal to afford
you a few illustrations of his wonderful sagacity." Hereupon he pokes
the Lord Mayor in the stomach, and his Lordship, thus stimulated,
gesticulates, kicks, and is thrown into a paroxysm of unwieldy convul-
sions. "The Lord Mayor will next oblige the company by balancing
himself on one leg "—and admonished by another touch of the wand,
my Lord assumes the required attitude. "He will now accomplish
the remarkable feat of standing on his head," and this achievement is
also effected in obedience to an additional incentive administered with
the long pole. "The docile creature will next kneel down, and remain
in that posture whilst the Cap of Maintenance is being sent round
among the honourable spectators. Pray remember the Recorder."
The promised result is again obtained by a repetition of the stimulus.
"You shall now behold him, at the word of command, seat himself
upon his haunches, and, resting upon that extraordinary basis, he will
ring a bell, fire off a pistol, and eat any quantity of gingerbread-nutB
that the kindness of any parties present may dispose them to offer him.
After which he will pick up a sixpence with his mouth; and lastly rise,
expressing his sense of the obligations conferred upon him by making
an obeisance to the company." All these acts of intelligence are accu-
rately, if clumsily, executed by the apparently half-reasoning dignitary,
who is then at length led off amid the applause of the beholders.
In answer to the congratulations of tbe Lord Chancellor on his
elevation to the Civic Chair, we do not find the Lord Mayor repre-
sented as uttering any articulate sounds; whence we conclude, that his
acknowledgments of them are rendered in dumb show at a signal
intimated to him by his Recorder.
Tbe Lord Mayor's Show, and all the other ceremonial circumstances
incidental to the Mayoralty, are of a character equally absurd with his
presentation to the Lord Chancellor. The ludicrous is a recognised
element in the Civic Constitution, and its utility is evidenced in the
practical working of that system. Perhaps some erudite German pro-
fessor will tome day expound the Theory of the Comic in Municipal
Government, as operating, with the force of a sustaining principle, in
our Civic monarchy.
AN ILLUMINATED SCOTCHMAN.
There is such a thing as being Penny-Wise—there is also such a
thing as being Penny-Foolish. The former implies only comparative,
the Fatter positive folly. Among those who practise penny-wisdom, we
may class tbe purchasers of most of our London cheap newspapers,
seeing that such persons obtain an article which, though it is necessarily
inferior to the productions of those who employ first-class writers and
pay them adequately, contains some information and some good sense.
But among the penny-foolish people we fear that we muss place the
unfortunate persons (we hope, and indeed believe, that their number is
not large (who throw away their bawbees in procuring sucb cheap
Scotch newspapers as are typified by an Edinburgh journal which has
been sent us, called the Daily Express. One does not expect profound
political views, accurate reports,'or anything else of much value for
four farthings; but, to adapt what a gentleman of the chimney-sweeping
persuasion bawled out one night at the Victoria Theatre,— We don't
look for no good grammar here; but, blow it, you might shut the scenes
to! "—the penny Scotchman might avoid horrible English in a narrative
of a simple incident that took place under, or rather over his own eyes.
In the very centre and post of honour in the Daily Express, we find the
following morceau:—
"We observed on Friday, 30th October, that Mb. Robebt Hctchirok, of the White
Horse Hotel, fjraesmarket, was beautifully illuminated, and a splendid display of ladles
and gentlemen on his balcony, which did great credit to the landlord of the above-
mentioned hotel."
We have heard of a man's being enlightened (a process not likely to
be often undergone by a subscriber to the Daily Express), but how Mr.
Hutchison of the White Horse.managed to be "illuminated " puzzles
us. As Mrs. Hemans wrote, There is fear in the path of his dim
White Horse." Passing from this mystery, we want to know why
Scotch ladies and gentlemen are to be talked of as if they were fire-
works. A splendid display of ladies and gentlemen! We hope, fire-
works "or not, that the landlord did not "let them off." until they bad
paid their bills. The balcony, according to the Daily Express, did the
landlord great credit, but we trust that he gave little. The penny
Scotchman "observed" all these things, for he says so, but his ability
to place the result of bis observations on paper is as limited as we
should imagine, from the admitted shrewdness of our Scottish brethren,
that his circulation must be. Even twa bawbees should not be wasted
on trash.
Proverbs for Palk.
Wash your dirty linen at home before you give advice to husbandmen.
Hang a dog before you give him a bad name.
Take care of your pence before you let your charity begin at home.
A bird in band is tbe best policy.
Honesty is worth two in a bush.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITISH ART.
The Times, in a leading article on the subject of
"Big Ben" of St. Stephens, reminds us that
"Old Palace Yard, between the Hall and the Abbey, has no longer its
gallows and its pillory."
Considering how many Pauls, Sadleirs, Robsons, and
other rogues are continually coming out just now, many
people may be of opinion that this is a pity. Among the
Westminster improvements," it may, in the view of not
a few persons, be advisable that the restoration of the
gallows and the pillory should be included. In these days
of art-crockery and art-coal-scuttles, if the re-erection of
the two wooden structures above-named were determined
on, it might be well to have an art-callows and an art-
pillory, tor the design of which architectural objects we
suppose enough taleut has perhaps been developed by the
school which has been formed for its cultivation.

A MAN OF ACTIVE SKIN.
Tiiz tartrate of antimony is a powerful sudorific Ipecacuanha
possesses strong diaphoretic properties. An examination for the di-
ploma of surgeon and lie me of apothecary has o'ten produced on the
student of medicine the effect of those medicinal substances. The skin
of many a brave man may have acted profusely on first going into
action. But never, perhaps, did personal alarm opera e on the perspi-
ratory organ with the tffect experienced, according to his owu state-
ment, by Mr. Laurence Hbyworth, Member of Parliament for
Derby, teetotaller, aud advocate of the Maine Law. At a tea-meeting
at Darlington the other day, this gentleman related the following
anecdote:—
"Twenty years ago. after bearing some labouring men declare that they eonld work
better without intoxicating drinks than with them, he took the pledge; b it in going
home a doubt crossed his mind whether these poor men had corrcct notions—whether
some oue or more might not siuk and die. lie- became quite alarmed, so that the
perspiration burst out of him like a.flood."
Bodily fear produced on Mr. Hbyworth, the teetotaller, the same
effect which it takes a glas3 of stiff brandy-and-water to produce, on a
man of ordinarily s'rot,g mind and nerves. What a happy thing it must
be for Mr. Hkyworth to possess a skin which acts so readily from
such a cause! Whenever he is attacked by a dangerous illness, if he
knows it, we presume that a profuse perspiration relieves his system
and his terror. No doubt this peculiarity has combined with total
abstinence to preset ve his health. Ma. Hbyworth will never be
frightened to death. Pear, in his case, will never produce apoplexy or
fatal affection of the heart. It will make him perspire instead. The
effect, of his consternation at suddenly conceiving the possibility that
total abstinence might kill him, was merely an increased secretion from
the cutaneous pores. It might have been worse.

ear. Sib,—"That you very
often admit the contribu-
tions of ladies into your
delightful paper there can-
not be the least doubt in
the world. Of course I am
not deceived by nonsense
pretending to come from
ladies, because any woman
can easily detect when a fine
Lord of the creation is con-
descending (as he would call
it) to try and write like her-
self; but I very often see
articles which no one but a
lady could have sent you.
And these, dear Mr. Punch,
are, I can assure you, the
very best things which you
publish, and it is no use
saying that they are not,
because they are.
"This induces me to
think, that if you were to
have a regular lady con-
tributor to jour pages, it
would be a great satisfac-
tion to many thousands of
persons. If you entertain
the same opinion, I shall be glad to offer myself and my services.
You must, however, my dearlfr. Pa»cA,keep it quite secret, for reasons
which I would rather explain to you than write about.
* But, dear Mr. Punch, I do not mean that, because I am a young
lady, I am to write about nothing but what you men call women's sub-
jects. The millinery is not to be handed over to me. nor yet the jokes
about babies, and things of that sort. I must be allowed to express
my mind upon everything as freely as I should do if I were talking to
you, you dear old creature, in our drawing-room. If I write what you
do not approve of, why, of course, you must scratch it out, but I do
not consent to be forbidden to choose any subject I may like.If you
think that I do not understand politics, now, you are entirely mistaken,
for Papa was in the House of Commons; and, in the hope that he will be
there again, he regularly bores Mamma and me all breakfast-time
with his Views. My brother Augustus hunts, and I have driven
over to the cover-side; so that you perceive I understand sporting
matters; and, having two cousins clergymen, 1 am not likely to be
ignorant about Church affairs. Music, dancing, pictures, and all that,
of course, came into my education; and I think that I shall win a
dear old gentleman's affections, when I say that I know a good port

wine from bad, and that I like it better (one glass, that is) than

"One thing, my dear Mr. Punch, I will confess to you. If you take
me among you, I shall come chiefly for the purpose of Giving it to the
Men. There! I do not mean, of course, that I should do so in the
terribly vulgar way of that dreadful person, Fanny Fekn, because I hope
that your readers are all ladies ana gentlemen. But 1 do think, dear
Mr. Punch, and so do hundreds whom I know, that your pages lean far
too much, not to Virtue's side, quite the contrary, but to the side of
Mankind. I do not mean that you are not very bold in Our cause
sometimes, and when serious things come up; but you let men escape
for a great many offences of all kinds, for which you would come down
in a crushing manner upon us poor creatures. If you please. I want to
retaliate, and so if you are afraid of offending your men-readers (and I
know how touchy they are), say at once that you would rather dispense
with my services. / shall not be offended, but love you all the better
for your frankness.
"Now, dear Mr. Punch, if you would like to set some matters before
your readers from a Young Lady's Point of View, you may write to
me and say so, and then you must manage to see me, as I can explain
my ideas better in conversation; and besides, I think if you do see
me you will like me a little. I do not know whether I have ever
had the pleasure of meeting you in society; but I have met several
very handsome and agreeable persons who have been pointed out to me
as your writers; but people tell such stories that one never knows
what to believe.
"I send you an address, to which you are to be so kind as to write,
and I am,
"My dear Mr. Punch,
"Most sincerely your

"P.S. No, I won't put one, because you say a woman can never
write without a postscript. There, Sir."
[We have printed this letter simply to save ourselves trouble. We shall not write
to the lady, nor shall we manage to see her. Neither, in all human probability, shall
we insert one single additional line which Bhe may send us. But in the event of our
discovering that she can say anything worth printing, the above will be her intro-
duction to the world, and now she may do Just what she likes.—Punch.]
Too Much and Too: Little.
Milan is very different from London. In the latfer Metropolis, the
cry is "Where are the Police?" in the former, "Where are not the
Police F" There, the Police, both openly and secretly, pervade every
hole and corner to such an extent that the difficulty is to know who is
not a Policeman. If we were compelled to select either of those two
towns as a place of residence, we should certainly, exercising our choice
of the two evils, give the preference to London. We draw this
difference between the two countries:—In England the difficulty is
to find a Policeman—in Austria the difficulty is to avoid one!

Jones has an Excellent View of the Sea Serpent on his Voyage from the Isle of Dogs to Hungerford Pier.
THE MITY EEALM OF MONACO.
The official Oazette of Verona of the 1st instant, records the acces-
sion of the Prince or Monaco to his dominions. This is a potentate
of the extent of whose territory a most exaggerated estimate will pro-
bably be formed by many of oar readers; since it, although he himself
is styled merely a Prince, is denominated a kingdom. They may
imagine that the sway of this monarch may, perhaps, extend over a
region, only a little inferior in magnitude to the county of Rutland.
His whole kingdom, however, is considerably less spacious than that,
its extent not exceeding two leagues. These dimensions naturally
suggest a comparison with Lilliput: but the number of the inhabitants of
Monaco is 800. The population is thus proportionate to the area which
it occupies; and may, therefore, be presumed to consist of individuals
not necessarily under the ordinary size. Accordingly, when we are
told that, at a point called the Croce, the Prince was reeeivtd by the
Mayor and other authorities, and had offered to him, in conformity
witn custom, a goblet of wine of honour, we are not forced to imagine
the vessel to have been of the magnitude of an acorn-cuo, and the
quantity of generous liquor contained in it to have been one drop. Nor,
are we obliged to surmise that the guns fired in honour of the occasion
were twopenny brass cannon: nor to conceive that the Mayor and
authorities in attendance were less tall and fat than other, Mayors and
authorities.
The above particulars, mentioned by our Italian contemporary,
induce certain reflections. Has the Pbince of Monaco any army?
If he has, of what extent may it be supposed to be, assuming it to bear
an average proportion to the population at large? A rough calculation
which we have made on this p int. places the Monacone, Monacose,
Monacotic, or Monaconian army, whichever you like to term it, at
strong. Geographical considerations do not permit the Pbince of
Monaco to rank with the maritime powers; to estimate, therefore,
the probable strength of his navy is superfluous, and might be deemed
absurd.
The administration of a monarchy so extremely limited as that of
Monaco is, probably, equally limited; and it is likely that the officers in
the Civil Service of the Prince do not. very greatly exceed the number of
those employed in the military. It is probable, indeed, that he keeps
no servants whatever, except domestics; but of these the number
may be considerable. For, no doubt, his rule is of a patriarchal
character; and he may often accomplish the object of feeding his people
by having tbem all to dine with him: when a numerous staff of cooks
and other attendants would be requisite. This liberality would, how-
ever, involve great cost; and, of course, he cannot practise it when,
as may sometimes happen, he has only two or three seudi in his
exchequer.
The influence which the succession of the Pbince of Monaco to
the throne of his ancestors will exercise on the destinies of Europe
is incalculable. We trust that, warned by the unhappy examples of
other sovereigns possessing dominions not less vast, and peoples not
inferior in multitude to his own, he will endeavour, instead of
cherishing dreams of empty ambition, to devote bis energies to the
development of those internal resources which he will not have to go far
to discover within the compass of two leagues. True, he will be un-
able to promote the welfare of the million, because his subjects do not
amount to that number: but he can study the best interests of the 800
who, inclusive of the Mayor, and other authorities, acknowledge his
own authority as paramount and supreme.
A Te Deum was sung at the consecration of this mighty Prince, who,
on that solemn and important occasion, exchanged the name of
Florestan, which he had previously borne, for that of Ciiari.es thb
Third. May the lustre of that title be destined to extend many a
yard beyond those two leagues which comprise the magnificent realm
of Monaco.
ACCIDENT IN HIGH LIFE.
{From our Fal-lal Correspondent amongst the Superior Classes)
On Tuesday last a Lady of Title, whose name has hitherto been kept
a profound secret, whilst proceeding up the grand staircase of Suther-
land House to pay the amiable Duchess a visit, neglected, we are sorry
tn state, to take the customary precaution of walking up sideways.
The consequence of her recklessness (which, it is to be hoped, will aot as
a warning to other ladies) was, that her dress, which, selon la mode, was
fully twice as brosd as it was lorjg, became so completely wedged in
between the banisters and the wall, that it, was impossible for her to
move either one way or the other. Her Ladyship's position was not
one of the most agreeable in the world. It was, in fact, as alarming as
it was awkward; for it was not a pin's point more practicable for her
to advance, than it was to retreat. There she remained for some con-
siderable period, perfectly immovable in body, though not unmoved in
temper; and every minute of that Drolonged agony will probably be
recollected by the fair Prisoner of Crinoline until the last day of her
life, when she throws off the "mortal coil" of hoops and hen-cooped
petticoats. Finding, at last, her efforts to release herself from her
ridiculous immurement perfectly ineffectual, the question naturally
arose as to what had best be done. Were the banisters to be sawn
away? or was a hole to be excavated in the wall, sufficiently large to
describe a circle in which her Ladyship could with safety tum round
and sidle off? No: out of respect to the Duchess, it was resolved by a
council of elderly ladies, held on the landing, that it was better that
the dress should be cut away. Accordingly, half-a-dozen young
milliners were fetched from Madame di Jupon's establishment in the
neighbourhood; and, with the help of large scissors and garden-shears,
they set to work in good earnest, in order to clear the thoroughfare.

During the operation, which was witnessed in the most breathless
silence by a large crowd of European Nobility, that, owing to the
passing impediment, had gathered behind, her Ladyship was supported
by burnt feathers being applied under her aquiline nose, and lumps of
sugar dipped in eau-de-cologne being dropped into her mouth. However,
owing to the distance caused by the circumference of her dress, these
had to be inserted between a pair of tongs (of the brightest Bteel), and
it was only by extending the tongs at arm's length that the restoratives
could be introduced near enough to reach her exhausted person. After
severe labour, and the sacrifice of several yards of the most expensive
moire antique, Madame de Jupon's assistants (who, if they had
been female navigators, could not have worked with greater zeal or
hardihood) succeeded in extricating the unfortunate Lady from her dis-
tressing dilemma of solitary confinement. The difficulties they encoun-
tered in cutting through the innumerable strata of silk, whalebone, guim-
pure, foundation, muslin, gauze, stiffening, calico, flannel, caoutchouc,
and crinoline, would, we are told, if minutely related, send a thrill
through the bosom of the stoutest engineer! The Lady, considerably
curtailed of her fair proportions, was carried home, more dead than
alive, in a sedan-chair. The ruins of the dress were removed in a cart.
The staircase is to be enlarged.

RAILWAY DESPOTISM.
Tee position of Ticket-of-leave men has lately been attracting con-
siderable attention, and many appeals to public sympathy have been
made in their behalf. But whatever be the difficulties, as well as the
indignities, which they have to submit to, their condition bears in this
respect most favourable contrast when compared with that of others,
with whom they have at least a nominal relationship. We allude to
the holders of those season tickets-of-leave, by which permission may
be purchased for a certain fixed continuance of Railway Travelling. It
appears from evidence which has lately reached us, in the form of a
perambulator-load of correspondence, that the issuing of these tickets
is attended with about as many drawbacks and exceptions as the
granting of his freedom to a serf in Russia. Before receiving his pass,
the applicant, it seems, has to do a sort of penance in a sheet of stipu-
lations, by which he acknowledges allegiance to the Company, and
and, with a humiliating use of the first person, he has further to
acknowledge that—
"In the event of my travelling between the above named and any other station, I shall
pay the full fare for the whole distance travelled as an ordinary passenger, and in such
case shall not claim or have any rebate or allowance on account ot such Ticket or Pass.
And on arriving at any of the above-named stations, when travelling by virtue of any
such Ticket or Pass, I Bhall not be allowed to book on for any further station by the
same train in which I have arrived."
Although voluntarily submitted to, conditions so imposed appear to
us somewhat of an imposition. But there is a still more imposing tone
in that which follows:—
"I agree to abide by all the rules, regulations, and bye-laws of the Directors of the
London and North Western Railway now in force, or which shall hereafter be in force,
especiaUy those relating to the number of trains, of the periods of starting, or the
arrival of trains, and not to require any previous notice of such alterations, or future
additional regulations; nor to hold the said Directors in any way responsible to me in
consequence of any circumstances arising therefrom; nor answerable for want of
accommodation in any train ; nor for any stoppage, delay, hindrance, or change, whe-
ther arising from accident or otherwise, which may impede the proper starting, running,
or arrival of any of the Company's trains."
It is one of the contradictions of our national character, that there
are men among us who will join in chorussing together that they " never,
never, never will be slaves" over-night, and then give up their rights
and liberties in such a wholesale way as this next morning. We who
are for ever lyrically boasting that the Briton may traverse the Pole
or the zone," as free as his native air, yet cannot take a season-ticket
between Euston Square and Watford without signing as complete an
are wholly irresponsible for any injury which they may oause their
subjects. And can we wonder then to find them so continually exer-
cising this privilege, and adding new pages to the chapter of accidents?
TREASON AMONGST THE WIRES.
In Lombardy a poor harmless fellow was taken up for sending through
the Electric Telegraph the following message:—
11 The Revolution has just commenced. The Rising could not well be finer.'
Upon being questioned by the Austrian authorities, he explained
that he was an astronomer, and that he was merely forwarding to a
friend his current observations upon the then Eclipse of the Moon! The
trembling enthusiast, upon being liberated, was warmly congratulated
by his friends; for it is the opinion of all Italians that he has had the
narrowest escape in the world of being imprisoned for life!

The Column for Grumblers.
It may with truth be said of the Lions, the Alto-relievos, and the
promises to pay attention to whatever orders its Directors may be \ various pieces of sculptural ornament and disfigurement belonging to
pleased to issue. We learn for instance that the purchaser ot his; the Nelson Column, that "out of Site, out of Mind;" for they seem by
freedom—that is, his freedom to travel—on the London and North every one to be comp'etely forgotten. By the time the tardy adjuncts
Western, is required expressly to admit, in writing, that his ticket is are finished, it will be necessary to build another column, for the
"available only for journeys between the stations therein .named;".present one will doubtlessly be in ruins!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 15, 1856.

A HINT TO RAILWAY TRAVELLERS.
Br Breathing oh the Glass— and holding a Speaking Doll by way or Baby io
THE WINDOW—TOU MAY GENERALLY KEEP YOUR COMPARTMENT SELECT.
THE CLANEICAEDE BOOMERANG.
The M arquis o? Clanricarde has a ton known by the name and title of Lord Dun-
kellin. This remarkable young nobleman distinguished himself, in a signal manner, in the
Crimean campaign, by blundering, one evening, among the trenches, and getting himself
peaceably taken prisoner, with much ease and safety. But the late Ehpkror Nicholas,
either disdaining to keep captive such a small deer, or being really desirous to propitiate
the British aristocracy, straightway returned Duxkbllin to Ins ditconsolate parent, without
exchange or consideration. Mr. Punch's readers may possibly remember the frantic bursts of
epistolary gratitude in which the elder and the younger nobleman indulged upon the occasion,
and their ecstatic adulation of the Czar, who, they said, bad shown himself the most
noble, the most generous, the most godlike creature aristocratic imagination could conceive—
this opinion being loyally and patriotically expressed at a time when the said Nicholas was
making furious war upon Quick Victoria.
Lord Dunxeixin is doubtless a great blessing to the paternal roof, bat Lord Clanricarde,
wif h a stern Roman virtue, despatches him beyond seas again with all convenient speed. He is
sent out to Calcutta, on the staff of his uncle-in-law, the new Governor-General, Loud Canning.
And the bero of the Crimea loses no time in distinguishing himself again, and in such a
way as makes it probable that he will be again handed back, with despatch, to the ipaternal
embrace.
Charity balls are the fashion in Calcutta/as elsewhere, and the Calcutta people—not having
heard, we suppose, of any inundations in India (something has reached us touching the sub-
merging of ccores of na'.ive villages, and the drowning thousands of persons) got up a hall,
at the end of August, for the relief of the sufferers by the inundations in France. Toe affair
was very brilliant, and all the beauty, and virtue, and respectability of Calcutta was present.
Likewise was present some of the beauty without the other two articles, for, according to
Lord Dunkellin's own admission, that noble aide-de-camp introduced to the ball three
ladies whose presence was notoriously an insult to the feminine portion of Calcutta society.
But not only did the gallant Dunkellin present cards to these three graces, but, as became
an aide-de-camp and representative of the Governor-General, he chiefly selected them as his
partners in the dance—though not, it is said, exclusively, his smiles and attentions being at
times acco. ded in more correct quarters.
The Anglo-Indian press may have its faults, but timidity and hypocrisy are not among the
number, and the bat'eries which the incensed journalists nave opened upon Lord Dunkellin
were banging away with unrelenting wrath and frankness when the last mail left. An
apologetic letter from his Lordbhip seems rather to have increased their anger; for he states
that he placed the tickets inadvertently, but omits to explain how his inadvertence is to justify
his deuxtemps and polkas. We shall probably hear of his Lordship's being remitted to
England by an early mail. Our readers doubtless have seen the Boomerang—the savage's
carved missile that returns to the band the more rapidly in proportion to the force with
which you throw it away. Lord Dunkellin would seem to be a kind of aristocratic
Boomerang. However, Lord Clanricarde
must not. despair—let him try the Kaffirs next
time. They will surely keep Lord Dunkellin
(should they catch him), if only in admiring
recognition of conduct, which one would rather
expect to find among them than among the
English—no—the Irish nobility.
THE TWO BENS.
Ben Hall he leads a happy life,
In Whitehall-Place, serene from strife;
Sublime o'er architects he reigns,
Lays out Park-walks, Park-waters drains.
His power can give us streets to go
Straight from Pall-Mali to Pimlico;
Our trees he plants, our trees cuts down,
The Palace guards, adorns the Town;
With a new bridge the Thames he spans,
And picketh holes in all men's plans;
New Public-office schemes directs,
More Wellington designs selects.
The Board of Works 'tis his to sway,
With fiat none dare disobey;
Lords at his house are proud to dine,
I would Ben Hall's high lot were mine.
And yet he's not a happy man,
To please all parties he must plan;
The Palace soothe, cajole M.P.'s,
And Mary'bone electors please!
From Palace whims he must keep clear;
Upon the Huntings must appear -.
His bills the Commons may o'erhaul;
No! no! I would not be Ben Hall.
Ben Thwaites's lot more pleaseth me;
He hath a handsome salary
To sit in dignified repose,
While vestry magnates prate and prose.
He has no power, 'tis very true,
Bad to prevent, or good to do;
But as he hath no power, why .he
Escapes responsibility.
Which road our sewage ought to g\
He need not settle "yea" or "no,
He's free to sleep if so inclined,
And never need make up his mind.
Yet his is not a happy lot,
For he must staaa the papers' shot;
Times' leaders stinging and severe,
With his digestion interfere.
And this dark thought his heels must dog.
Bate-payers may tire of King Log;
If out their money thi-y must fork,
They may insist upon King Stork.
So when the Times on Thwaites lets fall,
I'll fancy that I am Bkn Hall;
And when Hall's bullied in debates,
I'll hug the notion I'm Ben Thwaites.

WHAT'S A "CURE?"
Punch has no mission to repeat
The slang he hears along the street,
But when a cuiious phrase he seizes,
Punch does—as always—what he pleases.
He finds, then, in the following word,
i\o merit, save that it's absurd;
But as it's likely to endure,
He asks the question, "What's a Cure?"'
He heard, upon a river boat,
The steersman told to move his coat:
The fellow grunted like a boor;
The,Captain said, "Well, you're a Cure."
The mud was thick—the crossing clean—
A well-dressed man, genteel of mien—
Walktd through the first (he might be poor),
The sweeper muttered, "He'» a Cure.
Two youths talked "chaff" (in phrase polite),
Each asked where t' other slept last night:
"Me P Up a spout." "Me? Down a sewer."
The first—" Ain't you a precious Cure? .
A child, more apt to eat than spell,
Espied his little sweetheart, Nell:
Embraced her with affection pure,
And cried, " You darling little Cure."
Before a shop stood maidens two,
Where fine mock-diamonds pleased their view:
"O, Julia, that's the Koh-i-Noor."
"That!" Julia said, "You silly Cure."
Lastly, he heard the word applied
To Lord Mator Finnis in his pride.
A female shouted, "Well, I'm sure!
Call him a Mayor—he looks a Cure."
Thus having heard the word he mentions
Spoken with seven distinct intentions,
Punch doth the slanging world adjure
To state whence derivatur "Cure."
THE GENTS' QUADRILLE.
As Jullbbn once threw off a "Bow Polka," could he not farther
immortalise himself with a "Row Quadrille," for the beatification
of the numerops Cents who lately attended at his Concerts for the
purpose of making a Bow P We give our musical Moss, a few notions

BLACK AND WHITE.
A 11aytian gentleman, by name Damier, lately communicated to
the Times the translation of a letter which he had previously written to
the Journal des Debats, wherein occurs, with reference to his country-
men, the following remarkable passage:—
"On the contrary, the very organs now employed by unscrupulous and interested
parties to blacken and traduce them would have beeu foremost to speak In their behalf."
Strange that it did not occur to Ms. Damier that any attempt to
blacken the population of Hayti, must, like trying to gild refined gold,
or paint the lily, be vain and superfluous. The black man need not be
ashamed of his colour. It will bear comparison, just now, with that
of European races; and the next time Ms. Damier has occasion to
complain that his compatriots have been calumniated, he should reverse
his metaphor, and say that their slanders have whitened them.
Early Whites.—Last week a few very wild ducks appeared in
the vicinity of the Stock Exchange. It was thought they had come
up by the Russian railways. They, however, soon took wing, not
being inclined to speculate "for a fall."

The Tablet will no doubt bum with indignation at the
subjoined case of Protestant bigotry and intolerance, taken
from the list of "Deaths" daily published by the Timet.
Even that record of mortality is perverted by heretical malice

ment, the body was thrown into the sea."
In the first place, here are the relatives of the deceased,
Protestants of course, insulting the feelings of Roman Catholics
by trying to procure Christian burial in a Roman Catholic
country for a heretic. Defeated in this cruel and uncharitable
object, the bigots next endeavour to wound the susceptibilities
of the faithful, and bring the holy discipline of the true Church
into odium, by publishing the failure of their impious design in
the leading journal of Europe. This is all of a piece with an

Bbv. J. Clabksoh, Ipswich. Price id. Also, by the same Author and Editor, Fourteen
Seasons why we should Xot Go to the Theatre. 2d."
Before applying these publications to the purpose for which they are
above recommended, it migbt be as well if the. purchaser would read
them to his sisters, or any other young ladies with whom he may be
intimate, for the purpose of imparting, and sharing, the enjoyment of a
food laugh at what will be doubtless found a parcel of imbecile and
rivelling twaddle—if that twaddle is not too melancholy. But works
of this sort greatly tend to corrupt the mind of youth, by generating
therein a contempt for all religion whatever, which they exhibit in the
light of a despicable and maudlin fanaticism. They do the same
mischief as the demeanour, particularly in the pulpit, of the reverend
gents who write and edit them. They abound, for the most part, in a
kind of sanctified slang, which corresponds to the moaning, and mouth-
ing, and snuffling, and other nauseous and vulgar mannerisms by which
preachers of the ela ■r, alluded to usually make themselves ridiculous.
"Hay I go to the ball?" is a question which exclusively concerns
the Mimma, who is the only person to whom it can, except in a few
unhappy cases, be addressed. The cases we allude to are those of a
morbid enthusiasm which commouly, to a certain extent, vents itself in
working large slippers, adapted to contain and cherish the bunions of
popular, and mostly nonconformist, divines. There may be fourteen,
or more reasons, why we should not go to the theatre, and one of them
is the probability that we should be bored there by a dull and repulsive
drama, translated from the French, with deteriorations. But bad as
the stage may, in some instances, be, it is not, at the lowest, so bad as
the histrionic pulpit, in which the performance is acting ot the worst
tendency, and very bad acting, of the most snobbish kind, ludicrous
without being comic.
THE SWAN ON THE CHESS-BOARD.
A. New edition of Shakspeare is announced. It is to be edited by
Mb. Staunton, the champion of the Chess-ring. Our great chess-
player has doubtless many other qualifications for the work besides his
speciality; but we are credibly intormed that this also will be available
in his dealings with "the divine Williams." We hear that Mb.
Staunton has in his possession a diagram containing the game at chess
which Ferdinand and Miranda were "discovered" playing, in the
Enchanted Island. Without forestalling the editorial revelations, we
may mention that Ferdinand was playing the Allgaier or Algiers
Gambit, which he had learned from one of the Tunis noblemen who
came to fetch the Princess Cktribel. Miranda, startled by the readiness
with which her lover.throws away his king's bishop's pawn, exclaims:
"Sweot Lord, you play me false."
To which Ferdinand, in Mb. STAUNTON's'restored text, replies:
"No, my dear love,
I would not for the world. You took my pawn,
As I Intended, and I now advance
My king's kntgbt, darling, to my bishop's third;
You push your pawn np to your king's knight's fourth,
And I respond by shoving np my pawn
To the fourth square in front of my king's rook;
The best thing you, admired Miranda, now
Can do, (except to look at me, your Blave,^
Is to push ou your pawn to king's knight s fifth.
True, my attack is strong, but, play you false,
As I have said, I would not for the world."
And then the innocently playful girl goes on. as in the received
editions, to tell him that for a score of kingdoms he might cheat her.
This is but one of many valuable additions which we may expect from
Mb. Staunton, and we shall be very happy to receive his first volume.

ENGLISH OMNIBUS.
AlB—(Oh, Tio we need not mention it.)
'li sing you a new song at
once, before it is too late,
Of a fine old public vehicle,
grown sadly out of date,
Whicb, though a perfect
nuisance in more ways
than I can state,
Is suffered in our thorough-
fares still to perambu-
late.
A fine old English Omnibus,
one of the present time.
Its windows old let in the
cold whene'er the east
wind blow*,
And drip by drip the wet
admit whene'er it rains
or snows;
But how to get 1hem open
without breaking no one
knows,
When with "12 inside" the
atmosphere a little
'"stuffy" grow*,
In this fine old fusty Omni-
bus, one of the present
time.
Its cushions, when inspected in the light of other
With the richest (cotton) velvet of a crimson hue did
But now their threadbare covering's a dingy brickdust red,
And what was horsehair stuffing once now feels like lumps of lead,
In this rare old English Omnibus, one that is past its prime.
Its seats so close together bring the sitters nose to nose,
And everybody's forced to tread on everybody's toes,
Whence cheerful conversation springs, especially from those »
Who've corns or gout, and glare about as though you 're mortal foes,
In this nice old City Omnibus, just to beguile the time.
Then if outside for air you'd ride, the clambering to your seat
Would, if performed at Astley's, be pronounced a "daring feat;"
For ere you 're half-way up you hear them coolly cry "All light,!"
And then the "knife-board cramps you so, with pain you can alight
Erom this height of inconvenience, the subject of my rhyme.
And then the cad who tends the 'bus—his virtues who may tell P
How with his every breath there comes a fragrant beery smell:
How when he's bound for Brompton he '11 engage to put you down
Within a "heasy walk" of any part of Camden Town,
By his fine old English Omnibus, one of the present time.
Nor should our praises be withheld from him who holds the reins,
Who constantly is pulling up for furtive "little drains:"
And 'specially on muddy days is rarely found to fail
Of stopping in mid-street to pick up passengers who hail
This fine old English Omnibus: fun of the present time.
Now months have rolled since we were told this fine old 'bus must die,
That another and a cleanlier its place was to supply -.
Yet for that "good 'bus coming, boys," all vainly still we sigh,
And when we take our walks abroad that nuisance we espy—
The fine old English Omnibus: blot on the present time.
THE COURT OF CRINOLINE.
As it is as much a truth now-a-dsys as when Shakspeare wrote it,
that " what great folks do the less will prattle of," we may imagine
that a quantity of not altogether harmless conversation will arise from
the descriptions of the Court at Compiegne, which have been supplied
by "our own" Paris correspondent. At how many tea-tables for
instance will the paragraph which follows, be discusted with as much
eagerness as the first plate of muffins, with which we may expect it to
be introduced:—
"The guests are all expected to change their costume twice a-day; and, as we before
mentioned, no lady la allowed to appear at the chateau twice in the same dress; the'
Empress setting the example by giving every robe once worn to her attendants. As
these are of course sold sgatn, Paris overflows with the Imperial difroque, and a few
nights ago on the boards ot one of the theatres was recognised a biccade that had lately
figured on the throne.1'
We mean no disrespect, but are prepared to find ourselves "con-
demned" for it, when we express our opinion that announcements such
as this—and tbey have lately been "as thick as leaves in Vallombrosa,"
or thefts by ticket-of-leave men—are likely to be talked of not altogether
harmlessly. The female mind, it has been proved, is prone to imitation:
and where dress is in discussion, may be influenced to follow the most
unreasonable leadership. It is therefore with feelings of no common
apprehension that, as husbands, we read of what is done at Compiegne;
for if the example there set be taken as a precedent—and there is no i
saying to what lengths as well as widths the present fashion may not
lead—we shall have our wives insisting on our finding them in two new
dresses every day, which, as they would doubtless soon want three for
Sundays, would make up the agreeable total of about eight hundred
every twelvemonth! and averaging the cost of these so low as fifty
shillings each, we should still have cause to think our better halves
undoubtedly dear creatures.
As we have little wish, ourselves, to see our Judy't figured silks
figuring on any other figure than her own, and should especially object
to recognise their widths in some broad farce at the Surrey, or per-
chance the Yic, we mean to caution her expressly against prematurely
making over her defroque. And we think that ladies gent rally would
just now do well to learn, that charity not merely should "begin at
home," but should be exercised above-stairs before descending to the
kitchen. In charity to their husbands we would warn them to abstain
from that ill-judged benevolence, which enriches the lady's-maid and
perhaps the pawnbroker, but is not unlikely to impoverish the
children.
Name this Bell?
DEMONSTRATIVE DAMSELS.
The factory girls'of Lowell have sent to Preston S. Brookes, (the
fellow who brutally assaulted Mr. Sumner,) a present consisting of
"thirty pieces of silver," a rope, and a winding-sheet, with a latter
very explicitly pointing out why the first, gift is suitable, and the objects
of the other two. Woman, in America, is apt to be impulsive, and
perhaps a little profane. If the money were sent to the Anti-Slavery
Society, and Brookes were to do penance in the theet, while a stal-
wart Abolitionist used the rope upon him in the light of a rope's end, a
very vulgar ruffian would be more appropriately if less melodramatically
treated. The Lowell factory girls are known to make capital house-
wives, and therefore must be aware that nothing should be overdone,
not even indignation. Boast and baste your rascal, but don't let your
fire be too fierce.
EXTRAORDINARY CRIME.
Somebody considers that the great Bell ought to be called, not after
Sir Benjamin Hall, but after Sir William Molesworte, in whose
reign it was designed and ordered. There is something in this, but
the proposed honour to the late Sir William is impossible. The
Houses nave cost a fearful sum, of which we do not wish to be re-
minded by a "Big Bill." If honours went by merit instead of by
accident, the name of the man who made the bell would be given to it,
and it would be called what it certainly will be—the Warner.
Hebe is a curious piece of foreign intelligence:—
"We lately mentioned the marriage, in England, of the Prince of Hesse Cassel to
i*a Germau actress, the daughter of the actor Birnbaum. A resolution of the Minister
of the Interior of Hesse Cassel has dismissed Bibnbaum and his family from the
Court theatre, and Interdicted their further residence in the electorate."
It is difficult to understand how, on any principle of law, a man and
his family can be liable to exile from one country because his daughter
has married a Prince of the blood in another. Perhaps in Hesse Cassel
a mesalliance is something like murder, and all who are parties to it are
accessories before the fact. It was lucky for the relations of the
beggar-woman whom King Cofhetua espoused that Cophettja was
not Elector op Hesse Cassel, unless indeed the Elector himself
has the legal privilege of electing his own bride.
Napier at Southwark.
Parliamentary Openings.
The old saying of driving a coach-and-four through an Act of Par-
At Napier's Southwark election, it will be remembered that certain liament is a little out of date, inasmuch as coaches-and-four are them-
hattets presented Sir Charles with a hat. The gift has been proved selves driven off the road. Would it not convey a larger notion of
sadly unnecessary. For what need has a man of the gift of a hat, who space to say that an Act was so loose, so full of holes, that "a lady in
can so completely "bonnet" himself? full dress could walk through it with the greatest ease P"

SEA SONG BY A MODERN ADMIRAL.
{Dedicated to Sir Charles Napier.)
You may say what you like of your Jarvis and Howe,
Of your Collingwood, Nelson, and Blake,
But shiver my timbers! were they fighting now,
I think they'd find out their mistake.
If either of tbem in the Baltic had led,
I don't entertain the least doubt,
But what, "It a deuced good job," he'd have said,
"That Constantine doesn't come out."
That old son of Neptune, I'm sure, would have cried,
As he tosaed off his full can of flip,
"I'm glad that he won't lay his smart craft 'long- side
My rotten old hulk of a ship:
My eyes! if he did bo, his broadside would, scon,
Oblige us to sheer right about,
Yo bo! my tight iads, 'tis of Fortune a boon
That Constantine doesn't come out."
Avast, boys! the true Russian sailor, d 'ye mind?
Has got a most terrible knack,
Which you, if we come to close quarters, would find,
Of hauling down England's old Jack.
Had the Muscovites boarded us, only suppose,
With their savage and barbarous shout!
Thank Goodness, that holds back our dangerous foes,
"And Constantine doesn't come out.
Your cutlasses bright you may sharpen in vain,
Fulfilling your Chieftain's desire,
In order that you may the victory gain
By means of precision of fire.
"With Russians on board us, they '11 vainly be waved,
And we shall be put to the rout;
But, reef my top ga'nt sail I our credit is saved,

A thousand brisk Englishmen dance,
But against such a force, any day of the week,
Let live hundred brave Russians advance,
With a saucy St. Vladimir what could we do?
Hearts of oak! they would give us the knout;
Huzza! sing bnzza! then, my fortunate crew,
"For Constantine doesn't come out."
How grateful, how thankful, we all ought to feel,
That vessels so fearfully manned,
A sweet little cherub has caused not to steal
From under their guns on the land.
Down, down on your knees, then, you lubbers, and own,
With words and in accents devout,
Wbat a mercy it is that they let us alone,
"And Constantine doesn't come out."
Tarn that in your minds, I say, all you sea-dogs.
In your cheeks whilst you're turning your quids,
Turn into your berths when you've swallowed your grogs,
And in thinking of that, close your lids.
I, for my part, shall say, whensoever, may be,
I am called on to patter and spout,
You swabs. I consider 'twas lucky for me
"That Constantine didn't come out."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A STUNNING NOTION.

New fact in psychology has been
discovered by some City trades-
man. It ought at once to be made
known to the governors of all our
prisons, to the benevolent pro-
moters of reformatories, and to all
engaged in the repression of crime.
It is. that noise produces a bene-
ficial action upon a criminal in
proportion to the turpitude of his
offence. It seems that certain
tremendous Chinese Gongs have
been imported, of which the ven-
dors say,
"One for 40s., will effectually frighten
a thief; one for 60*., will appal a burglar;
one for 80s., will alarm the country for
miles round."
This is really a discovery. Per-
haps the advertisers have some
smaller ones which they did not
think it necessary to mention, but
which still might be useful in
domestic life. They might have
added that one at 30*. would cure
a fraudulent banker, one at 20*.
would convert a plagiaristic writer,
one at 10*. would prevent a dow-
ager from cheating at cards, while
still cheaper ones would be effi-
cacious for keeping the policeman
from your cold meat, the penny
journalist from your paragraphs,
and the landlady from your tea-
caddy. Are there pretty Malthu-
sian gongs that could be used in
a ballroom to prevent young ladies
from stealing hearts F The subject ought to be followed up. What if
the Gong is the destined reformer of the world? We have known
many reformers quite as noisy and as empty. We shall go in for
Gong. ============
AN AMBASSADRESS IN THE NUBSEBY.
All friends to the alliance of the Union Jack and Tricolor, will
rejoice with us to read the following intelligence, which the Illustrated
News receives^rotn its own]Paris Correspondent :—
"We are informed that the Prince Imperial has already' done what he could to
testify his sentiments' as to the Alliance, by displaying a marked preference for the
society aod caresses of an English nursemaid over his three French governesses and
two Nurses."
Now that, as the Moniteur has gravely admonished us, the pens of
our anonymous scribblers for the press are fast cancelling the bond of
French and English Union, and turning all our "friendly relations"
into those of cat and dog again, it is gratifying to learn that there exists
at the Tuileries a counteracting influence, by which the work of
these disunionists may, we trust, be nullified. Whatever "odious
calumnies" may be sniffed out in our Newspapers against his Pa's
Svernment, we think we may with confidence regard the Prince
iperial as not likely to be prejudiced—at any rate at present—by
them: and while we have his voice, or rather crow, in our favour we
may rely on it that any attempt that may be made to break off the
Alliance, as it exists in the Imperial nursery, will be loudly resisted.
Our only apprehension is, lest the "three French governesses and two
nurses who have had their noses disjointed by our countrywoman,
may cabal to get her turned out of office; in the which case England
would be losing an ambassadress, ;who although not officially recog-
nised in Downing Street, is yet exercising an undoubted influence upon
a portion of the French .Court that we could not otherwise expect to .
bias, and as regards "society," is more] "caressed" and popular than
perhaps even is Lokd Cowley himself.
A Paragraph for the Morning Post.
Ws hope we are not guilty of any breach of confidence, if we take upon ourselves
the liberty of informing our readers that the tlitt of the fashionable world will be
startled next season by the appearance of a new debutante, who is likely to set all
London ringing with her praises. This fair debutante is a Belle of the very highest
quality, such a* the upper circles of Belgravia have not once in a thousand years the
pleasure of being charmed with. What is more astonishing, the haul ton of this new
Belle will nnt be less itourdissant to aristocratic ears than the purity of her extraction.
—Morning Post.
We make Jenkins a present of the above paragraph, when it writes
its notice of "Bio Ben."
TO THEATRICAL MANAGEBS.
Gentlemen,—Being desirous of obtaining the post of money-taker
at any respectable theatre (a purely West-end establishment would be
preferred), I am desirous of laying before you my claims to the appoint-
ment of that very responsible situation. In the first place, the amount
of salary (being, of course, permitted to appoint my own check-taker)
is of no consequence. Employment of the mind, rather than any remu-
neration of the pocket, is my sole object. This fact (should I be
honoured with your confidence) will be made duly apparent by the
external respectability which it will be my endeavour to associate with
my "duties. Aware that in this outside world, appearances are every-
thing, it will be my wish to illustrate the humble function of money-
taker at either box, pit, or gallery door (unaffectedly, box would
be preferred), with all the resources that are the happy privilege of
mundane independence.
Thus, I shall be driven to the theatre in my own brougham; with, it
may be, the summer change of my own cab. For a tolerably keen in-
sight into the prejudices of commercial life has convinced me that sub-
ordinates who, in appearance, can in all things top their principals, are
the persons especially desirable for places of delicate trust and dearest
responsibility. That profound knowledge of human nature that ordi-
narily distinguishes the members of direction, boards, committees, &c,
will, I .trust, vindicate itself even in the theatrical bosom by making
selection of a man like myself, who, with a soul elevated entirely above
the consideration of mere lucre, seeks only for a post that will give to
his mental faculties a constant and no less pleasant employment.
I am aware that the ordinary remuneration of play-house money-
taker (at houses where orders do not preponderate) ranges from two
shillings to two-and-sixpence per night. I shall be happy to close at the
lower figure: my object being simply to enlarge my moral and intel-
lectual capacity by a close and various consideration of my fellow-
creatures. As I have, moreover, a peculiar manner.of taking money,—
salary is, of course, the less object.
My habits are temperate. 1 shall never exceed one bottle of cham-
pagne a-night, and pledge myself to take such refection only between
a lull of the money.
If necessary, I shall be happy to give a reference to two or three
bankers, with no end of attorneys. Address, No. 1, Sham Square.
I key Di Tips.
P.S. I must covenant for holiday-nights on the Derby and Ascot.
A LESSON FOR L&.DIES.
"While the Lord Mayor elect and some friends were Inspecting the preparations
for the Ouildhall feast, the Lady Mayoress unhesitatingly declared, with refert
to the Turtle, that' she did not like the nasty stuff!' "—Daily News.
Know you the Lady who doesn't like turtle,
And had the fine courage to speak out her mi A;
Though Aldermen round her stood scowling like Thubtell,
And even her Chaplain lisped, "Bather unkyind."
Long life to the woman who dared to declare it.
Be her gay Lady-Mayoralty marked by good luck:
Her robe fit divinely—her health last to wear it—
We don't share herjt aste, but we honour her pluck.
The good City Queen sets a lesson to ladies
Who haven t uot minds, or have minds they don't know:
Who don't care if wine comes from China or Cadiz,
And simper alike over venison and neau!
We like a companion who knows what she's eating,
(What chance for your tastes, if she's none of her own ?)
So hip, hip, hurrah, for November that's seating
A Sovereign like this on the Mansion House tl
throne.
Rossini's Last!
Here is another extract from the continental journals, that puts the
fool's-cap on all the previous stupid extracts:—" Rossini, talking of
the Opiras Casse-Voix, said, .' Look at Vebdi! His Operas are known
to crack voices as easily as a squirrel cracks nuts. One season of his
repertoire will take the edge off the finest voice in the world—his music
eats into it like rust. And you will see with Gkisi, if she sings much
in Vekdi's music, that her voice even will become quite Verdi-
Grisi!'"

The Emperor of the Moniteur, in addressing the new Russian envoy,

impose silence on sad reminiscences." Odd, that everything Russia
does must be an Imposition.

QUITE THE OLD STYLE OF THING.
A RUSSIAN LESSON.
We are apt to remark, in after-dinner confidence, when wanning
with onr subject and oar second bottle, that had the war gone on, we
should have taught Russia a lesson that she seemed to stand in need of:
but that in some respects the teaching might be mutual, this statement
by a Moscow correspondent is enough to show:—
"By an order of tbe Government every Railway train in Russia carries with it a
Surgeon, and this rule, I am told, is rigldly[enforced."
Without the least disparagement to our glorious Constitution, which
we know to be our Bulwark (and lots of other substantives), we con-
fess we think it would be well for us if our Government were in some
respects a rather more despotic one. We should like to tee our rail-
roads treated with more arbitrariness, and their iron way made subject
to an iron rule in all matters which concern the safety of the public.
The pace at which our trains are run is greater than in Russia, and
proves not infrequently, in rigid literalness, a killing one: yet if there
be an accident, it is another if a Surgeon be at hand on its occurrence;
and we are sure that our Directors would no more dream of ever having
one provided, than of adopting any other means that common sense
might dictate for our travelling convenience.
It might indeed be urged, and with some show of reason, that inas-
much as many more trains are daily run on English lines than Russian,
the rule there observed would be impossible to follow, as no Railway
could support such a staff of Surgeons as would here be requisite.
The question therefore is resolved into that of how, as we cannot have
these Medical Railway Guards, we may best do without themf And
the answer which common sense appears to give us is—to prevent, as far
as may be, additions being made to the chapter of accidents, by in-
creasing to the utmost the securities for public safety; by enforcing
greater punctuality, which is the soul of Railroad business, and by
adopting a more perfect plan of signalling, which experience has shown
to be of signal consequence.

PRACTICAL JOKING ON THE BENCH.
When the Lord Mayor presented himself, the other day, before my
lords the judges in Westminster Hall, my lords put on their black caps.
Really this was carrying a joke too far. Tbe practice of making fun of
the Lord Mayor on his accession is venerable, and may as well,
perhaps, be kept up, but the fun ought to be all harmless. To receive
a Lord Mayor with the same demonstration as that which is made in
sentencing a fellow to be hanged is not only paying him an odd, but a
dangerous compliment. Many a civic monarch on appearing before the
judges, may have been seriously alarmed by the unexpected spectacle
of the black caps placed on their heads. ■ What can a Lord Mayor
make of it? Nothing that one can well see, unless he may take it as a
humorous judicial hint that he had better eschew the example of too
many of his unhappy predecessors, and not murder the Queen's English.
But whether it is designed as a facetious admonition to mind hiss's)
and q's, or to be particular about his h'a, and r's and w's, it is a
practical joke which might, in the case of a timid Lord Mayor, be
productive of dangerous, or at least unpleasant consequences.
A DANGEROUS TRAVELLING COMPANION.
Amongst other wonders recounted in a sporting journal about
Prince Albert, we are informed that—
"The other day he brought down a roe deer from the carriage in which he was
driving."
We must say, we shouldn't like to ride.in a carriage that was loaded
in that manner. How the postilion must shake in his saddle, for he
must be afraid every minute of getting from the Prince bis discharge!
The poor turnpike-men, also, as they open their gates for nothing,
cannot very well admire the off-hand way in which the RoyBl Consort
tenders his shot. Colonel Phipps' feelings, too, are entitled to some
commiseration. With every liking for a master usually so kind aa
Albert, he cannot be fond of riding with him on these occasions when,
he is continually "banging" him up. But why take a gun in a

THE FUTURE OF THE BELL.
(From the Times Newspaper, Nov. 9M, a.d. 2256.)
*' Bella, horbida bella!" Such will probably be the exclamation
of many a charity child, in these educated da) s, as he takes h>s farthing
ride in (he galvanic railway across the lucid and sparkling Thames at
"Westminster, in his way to the Nightingale College, and sees the ruin
wrought by this morning's catastrophe. Barby's old Clock-Tower has
been brought down by the weight of the Bells, and lies in fragments at
the foot of the colossal statue of Lord Roebuck in the centre of
Palace Yard.
As usual in England, everyone had foreseen the accident for months.
Indeed the quivering vibration of the Great Bell itself, when the large
hours were struck, might have presaged its fall to any but adminis-
trative ears. The Government bad been warned, even up to the close
of the Session, when Sib I key be Solomons (some said with an eye to
bell-metal) moved that "Big Ben" should be taken down. The Duke
of Wellington, with a manner haughty enough for the extinguished
chamber in which his ancestors sat, resisted the motion, but promised
inquiry. The victor of Waterloo, according to the ancient records, was
famous for keeping his lordly word, but four hundred years have wrought
changes in Dukes, and not an oyster in his present Grace's well-known
and excellent shop at Charing Cross could have been .more silent on
the subject. The Tower is down.
The carious in details will find all particulars of the occurrence in our
usual half-hourly editions. Suffice it to say here that the Conservator
of Lights had just left Palace Yard, where he had been putting out the
great electric globe (found to answer so much better than the moon),
and the Bludgeon
Guard was winding
up the Steam Police-
man for the seven
o'clock round, when
an inexplicable noise
was heard, followed
by a cataract of
stones, clock-work,
beams, bells, pinna-
cles, and carving,
which came down in
thunder to the base
of the Roebuck sta-
tue. Its original
might have seen in
that mighty devasta-
tion a type of the
ruin which he pre-
dicted for England;
but which, thanks to
her wise and bold
dealing with her Con-
stitution, her sinking
Ireland to the bottom
of the sea, her esta-
blishing the House of
Journalists, her compulsory education, her annihilation of professional
lawyers, and above all her Private Currency Guarantee Acts, has yet
to come to pass. Now that the State furnishes every honest man with
whatever money he requires, we have no need to be dishonest, and we
wish that the spirit of Roebuck could see a Metropolis, counting
thirty-nine millions of inhabitants, guarded by a few pieces of police-
machinery, and knowing nothing of crime save what is imported from
the Empire of Africa.
So has fallen the mighty Bell, to which we see by reference to our
archives, that we devoted an article on its arrival at the foot of the now
prostrate Tower in 1856. It was raised to its place some time after-
wards, and has hung, at that dizzy height, for four centuries. What
scenes have passed around it! To what deeds, celebrations, solemnities,
crimes, has not Wabneb's thunderous metal lent its earthquake note!
Let us recal a few of the instances when the Great Bell of Westminster
has sounded. In the Revolution of 1862, when the ferocious Ernest
Jones and the sanguinary Paul Bedford usurped the sovereignty, the
Bell announced their coronation, and when: the fratricidal combat
between the two, as to which should possess the Koh-i-Noor diamond
(now in the Baptist Cathedral at Herne Bay) was terminated, after a
dreadful struggle in Maiden Lane, by Paul striking off the head of
Ernest, and proclaiming himself King Paul Jones, the Bell told
London of this consolidation of the monarchy. Forty years later, early
in the twentieth century, when the Australian fleet arrived at the Nqre
to menace the mother country into repayment of tbe Gold Dust Loan
of 1897, the Bell gave the signal to the terrible Torpedo Volunteers,
who, swimming out with their frightful engines, affixed them to the
bottom* of the ships, and blew the tyrant colonists to the five winds.
When, in 1964, the Civil War broke out between Albert the Second
and his people, because the former insisted on paying the expenses of
the State from the revenues of the estates purchased by the celebrated
husband of the good Victoria, while the people, justly deeming this
an insult, demanded to be Taxed, the Bell sounded the alarm, as the


Royal Horse Marines went splashing np the Thames to cut out the
Maria Wood at Richmond. It sounded too, as the signal for grace at
the Palace Yard banquet, when differences were arranged, and the
Dictator Punch, who had Brought back King Albert to bis people's
arms, made the State expenses a charge upon the profits of the sale of
his own back numbers, and thus relieved the Sovereign and the nation
with scarcely a percep'ible loss to himself. At the celebration of the
two-thousandth anniversary of the Christian Era, the Bell summoned
the Metropolis to receive a medal in commemoration of the Anglican
Bishops having agreed to surrender a tithe of their incomes to the
working clergy, and in 2133 the Bell rtng backwards as an unteachable
hierarchy entered the House of Lords for the last time. In 2150, when
a Hebrew fanatic, calling himself "The Asian Mystery," led Hounds-
ditch and Holywell Street to the Tower, stormed it, and carried away
the glass jewels (which the poor adventurer was unaware had been sub-
stituted for the regalia, presented to the Emperor, Fremont the Third,
of America,) the Bell would have given warning of his execution, but
that an ancient book, by one Rabbi Bendizzt, was discovered to have
stimulated the madman, and the massacre of Holywell Street and
demolition of that aged den of
iniquity was the harmless ven-
geance taken by the people.
Then came the Italian and
Russian invasion of 2178,
when' England once more put
out her strength, sank seven
fleets and routed eleven armies,
and scorning to gain an acre
of territory, divided Italy
among the descendants of
Mazzint and Grisi, and par-
celled Russia between Poland,
Sweden, and Sardinia. The
Bell struck twenty-seven times
while "Viscount Gladstone
delivered the speech of as
many hours, in which he com-
menced explaining the new
arrangement of the map of
Europe. Tbe last incident to
which we shall advert is within
the recollection of most of us,
when in 2230, Primrose Hill
broke out as a volcano, and
totally overwhelmed the cities
of St. John's Wood and Cam.
dentonia. The Bell sounded
furiously, and the Board of
Works, availing itself of the
marvellous mechanism of the
grand sewers of London, brought them to bear upon the fiery mountain,
and speedily extinguished it. The Bell's last important labour was
therefore one of kindness, and it has fulfilled its mission. Sir Iket de
Solomons shall not have our Bell.

FRAGMENT OF AN UNPUBLISHED NOVEL OF FASHIONABLE LIFE.
"How could he tell? Two long weary years had passed away;
years of suffering, adventure, hardship, and trial, since he had left her
and his native land to do battle against the hirsute legions of the
Muscovite, and how did he know but that he would have to shave
them off.
"In an agony of conflicting hopes and fears, Algebnon Fitzpymlico
turned into Langham Place. Why does he stop so suddenly, as by a
spell? and why does the life-blood rush crimson red up to his manly
brow?
"A form of feminine elegance, lovely and fair to look upon, and
arrayed in all the gorgeous amplitude of the prevailing mode—a fairy
vessel with her sails all set—appears in the distance. Can it be ?—yes
—no—yes—'tis she, indeed—there can be no doubt about it—but will
she recognise him? A cold chill, like damp dinner napkins struck to
his very heart—his brain grew dizzy and with all the premonitory
symptoms of a violent bilious attack, he clung to the nearest lamp-
post for support.
"It was Lettice. Lettice, fresh, and crisp, and sparkling as that
which had formed the salad of his noon-tide nourishment. With the
sunniest of smiles she glidingly approached, and gracefully extending
her exquisitely gloved hand towards him, and in accents soft as the
droppings of ethereal springs, she made inquiry as to how he did. But
who shall describe the feelings of Algernon at that critical moment?
feelings in comparison with which the tortures of Tantalus were as a
cheerful and enlivening pastime; there was the hand, but how to reach
it! Gladly would he have given up name and fame, land >, titles, trinkets,
all, to have pressed again that little hand; to have touched once more
that little finger—as well might he attempt to scale Parnassus as
trench upon the limits of that enchanted circle of which she formed the
centre, and which bung like a cloud-bank between him and the object
of his soul's idolatry.
"It was a terrible moment.
"Suddenly, and with electric brilliancy, a flash of triumph gleams in
his downcast eye—He has hit upon an expedient. Raising his stalwart
arm—that arm which erewhile amid the blare of trumpets and the crash
of war, had led battalions on to victory, and made the Russian tremble;
dexterously encircling the lamp-post before alluded to with the curved
handle of liis parapluie; cleverly balancing his noble form at an angle
of forty-five degrees; and in as graceful; an attitude as the circum-
stances would admit of, he—" &3. &c. {Here the leaf turns over.
LES„FETES DE FONTAINEBLEAU.
Louis Napolbon will not hunt the stag this season at Fontainebleau,
there being a promise of more serious sport in Paris. His Majesty has
given orders that the ladies and gentlemen duly convoked to the hunt,
are not to consider themselves invited. Great is the consternation at
Paris, and if a Government could be overthrown by crinoline, we
believe that the Empire would be topsy-tui vy at this moment. However,
the English public at least will gain by the misadventure; so let us,
with the moralist, bear our opposite neighbours' misfortunes like
Christians. All the green hunting suits, the dresses and decorations,
being disposable at an alarming sacrifice, a distinguished decorative
Manager, with more than a Holy well-street eye for costume has, we are
delighted to hear, made a handsome offer for the lot, and we shall have
Les Fetes de Fontainebleau, taken from the French, and presented better
than new at the Princess's in Oxford-street. The scenery will, of
course, be painted on the spot; and a moving panorama of a stag-hunt
is promised as among the noblest effects hitherto endeavoured. His
Majesty ha*, in the most liberal manner, granted the removal of any
number of head of game from the actual forest of Fontainebleau to the
theatre; thus enabling the spirited Manager to carry out his poetic
love of the real. The Emperor has further presented the Manager with
a live boar; perhaps the biggest boar that has hitherto appeared under
his auspices. It is expected that Les Fete* de Fontainebleau— but we
speak^with caution—will take the place of the Christmas pantomime.
Singular Delusion.
Redpath's salary at the Great Northern was £300 a-year. "Singu-
larly enough," say the accounts, "the Directors entertained a feeling
that he filled his responsible office simply from a desire of having some-
thing to do." There is a slight error here, which please correct as
follows. For "having something to do," read " somebody to do."

DOG-MARKET AND CANINE INTELLIGENCE.
We bave to announce that a large and sudden rise has taken place
in the price of dogs. The great prevalence of garotte-roberies is
creating an enormous demand for those faithful and courageous
animals. Dogs, indeed, are preternaturally bii<k at present, and are
lookiog up in a quite unprecedented manner. It has become the
general feeling thaf. a powerful and determined dog is a far more
eligible street-companion by night than a revolver or a bowie-knife, and
constitutes the very best of life-preservers. A state of half-strangula-
tion is incompatible with the command of weapons. A victim, firing
at the ruffian who is throttling him, might miss tbe ticke'.-o'-leave man
and shoot somebody else. If he hit the right man in the right place—
that is, shot him through the head or through the body, or thrust him
effectually in the sto nacb. or under the ribs—an inquest, attended with
some anxiety, and much loss of time, anil inconvenience, would follow.
A trustworthy aud savage dog meets all the requirements of the situa-
tion, without entailing any unpleasant consequences. H« iustantly flies
at the tumr of the villain whose band is at his master's, nr he seizes
him b? the leg; and moreover, when he bas forced him to loose his
gripe, he still sticks to him, and acts not only as a preserver, but also
as a policeman. In the mean time, be itflicts upon tbe scoundrel
precisely that sort of punishment which such a fellow is capable of
feeling, by causing his fangs to meet in the miscreant's flesh.
Thoroughbred Newfoundlands have been in high request, and cross-
breeds with the Bull bave found numerous purchasers. Toere has
been a great inquiry for old English mastiffs, aud Scotch staghounds
have fetched considerable sums. British bloodhounds have ranged
high; and Rossian retrievers have been taken at handsome prices.
Bull-terriers have been more active than ever, and pure bulls have
gone up to the very highest quotations, an extraordinary value being
attached to these dogs by reason of their immense power of jaw, and
obstinate retentiveness of bite, qualities which they might be expected
to display upon occasion, in the most satisfactory manner, and with the
nappies', effect, in pinning a brutal wretch of a garotte robber by the
nose, and causing I he savage to roar and bellow delightfully.
Active measures are, we understand, in preparation with a view to
fetting up a Large Dog Show, to take place concurrently with the
Inhibition of Eat Cattle. Government will act wisely iu encouraging
this project; since the increasing maintenance of taxable animals will
augment the revenue, besides tending to secure that protection for
life and property which is not at present afforded by the Dome Office.

Sir Al Alison informs Europe, through the sneaking-trumpst of

was announced to be tbe very last season of Arauxhall, perhaps the
"spirited lessee" is thinking of transferring the Royal Property from j
the Thames to the banks of the Nile? A country where it never rains j
would he for Vauxhall the very "Abode of Bliss," which that melan-
choly place of entertainment was so often advertising, but apparently
never found. But as Sir A. Alison makes the statement very posi-
tively that the rain bas never fallen in Kgypt for upwards of seventeen
centuries, msv we politely ask "upon what grounds P" It would
never do for Vauxhall, after escaping tbe Scylla of Lambeth, to fall
into the Cbarjbdis of Memphis! By the bje, how very dry those
"forty sentries" must b«, whom Napoleon spied looking down upon
his troops from the top of the Pyramids, considering that, for the last.

Clerks have lately been playing fast and loose to such an enormous
extent with their employer's money, that it is extremely difficult to
know whom to trust. We shall hear of the Clerk of the Weather
having embezzled something next. He will be taken up probably for
having been in the tiabi ■• of skimming the Milky Way, and appropriating
for years the cream to his own use; or else he will be convicted of
transferring some of the brightest stars from the firmament, and stitch-
ing tbem all over bis person, in order to be "a blaze of a swell," as
Esterhazt was at Moscow. If we were Saturn, we certainly should
count our rings every night, to see that none of them were missing!
Negligence is the Cause of Defalcation.

of the instruction it afforded our egg-sucking grandmo'.hers,)—1
address myself to your knowledge and experieco to decide a question
that, I venture to believe is even yet of some Duhh'c interest-
On Sunday l»st, after afternoon service in Iljde 1'atk, where the
BisHor of London delivered a most touching discourse to a very orderly
congregation of the nobility and gentry, myself and two friends took a
balloon from the station in Rotten Row, and were in a few minutes set
down at the balloon station at the entrance of the Crjs*al Palace. We
were about, to enter that resplendent edifice, when we heard and were
arrested by the tones of Big Ben, that came throbbing across the fields
from Westminster, the bell then beating five.
1 cannot say how it was, Sir; but no one better than yourself knows
that there are tiroes when the sound of bells has a fecuUv appeal to
the human heart.; now rarIting, and now sweetly disturbing it. My
friends, alik« with myself, on the occasion in question, seemed to
participate in one deep emotion. We said nothing. We entered the
gardens. We paused for a*hile, contemplating the innocent sports of
a band of frolicsome children, flaying at. kiss-iu-tbe-ting. We wandered
onwaid, and a'- length simultaneously sat down. It was plain that we
were ail brooding over one thought—plain t hat our several bosoms all
nourished, a d if 1 may use the expression, foudlfd the same note
(E na'ural, I believe,) of Big Ben.
"How fortunate was the man," thus pensively began Brown, the
name of one of my two friends—"who liring in the yea' 185G, as the
Chief Commissioner of Woik«, I think that was his appointment, had
the 'uck to have his name given to Big Ben a> d thus to be sent
floating do»n to generations, a note for all time!"
"Chief Commissioner!" cried Jones (my s»cond friend) a little
hastily; "my dear Bbown, ycur historical knowledge is a lit'le loose.

eloquent life, he filled many posts; thar of Chanc-llor of the Ex-

Bjard of Works. His soul was a little above common sewers. Now,
it was from the Governor-General of .Tkrosalem (sf'er Jerusalem
had been ceded to us by Mustyfar the Seventeenth) that, Big Ben
received his me'allic baptism." And Jones looked to me for confirma-
tion of his statement.
"My dear Jones," said I, smiling, " and my very dear Bbown, you
both are wiong— entirely wrong. From neither of these individuals
did the b»)l receive its name, hut from a much humbler though very
worthy individual: ramely, from a celebrated boxer, or pug'list of the

"Pooh, pooh! cried Bbown, "I say Big Ben cf Westminster was

"Nonsense!" 1 shouted; for I was getting a little warm at the
ignorance of my friends—" I tell you Big Ben was popularly named

When "Big Ben" thundered his unexpected first note—his E natural
—the effect throughout Westminster Hull is described as something tre-
mendous. Lord Campbell seemed the least moved ; though it is raid
two half-crowns were distinctly beard to vibrate in his lelt. breeches
pocket: however, he maintained his equanimity. A pious and no less
distinguished se'j ant exclaimed, "Doctor Cumming's right, term's
up!" A venerable attorney, with a money-lender of the Hebrew per-
suasion (waiting for a cause), fell upon iheir knees, and declared
themselves ready there and then to confess all their fins, but were
energetically arrested in their dreadful purpnse by the presence of mind
of the Ciier of the Court. After a brief convulsive in'erval, Lord
Campbell calmed the general tear by a philosophical explanation of the
cause of the alarm. Big Ben had spoken, and spoken wito such
emphasis, that henceforth learned gentlemen would be made to
remember, in the midst of their verbosity, what o'clock it was. Is this
to be hoped? How wonderful, then, will be the tongue of time, if it
can lick even the lawyers!

A MISSIONAEY FOR THE TEMPLE.
One of the foremost, out-stepping, and for<h-pu*tipg questions of
these rur times is that which embraces in its utterance the wrongs and
the rights of women. Now it whispers its plaiu'ive indignation in the
musical notes of " the Bybon of Modern Poetesses," anon it comes
thundeiing over the waves of the briny Atlantic with all the vehement
impetuosity of a Bloomer's stride; and, again, out of the mouth of an
advertising sheet we learn what the ladies can do for us, if we will only
allow them. The movement, we bebeve, originated with the classes
called (by the perverted author of Perversion) the "leisurely classes,"
but it has now run down the scale to "laundresses," as the following
important announcement, copied from the Times, will bear witness:—
rrO BARRISTERS.—A respectable Widow wishes for the Cars of
Ovricss, or Mime Chahbkrb. Can be well recommended for honesty and sobriety.
She can cock, and get up gentlemen's linen, and repair them. Address"
Can any of our "learned friends " fJesire more than this? Here is a
person who can cook for gentlemen, get up their linen, and repair
them? The "respectable widow" should, however, have described
her personal appearance, told her age and stated what wages—we beg
pardon, what remuneration—she expected. We think we know one or
two, at leas*, residing between Essex Court and King's Bench Walk,
who would not object, to pay any reasonable sum to be taken care of
after this fashion. But thmgh the Templa-s do, we dare say, need
repairing—so does the Temole, and the administration of its affairs—
the law most of all wauts to have its holes patched up and its soils
washed off, and, inasmuch as a number of old ladies have been for come
time past stitching and pasting the statutes, only to make them more
unsightly and unserviceable, we recommend the Society for the Amend-
ment of the Law, to apply to the "respectable widow." If she can
repair the lawyers, she may be able to repair the law.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SHORT MEDICAL ESSAY ON PLURACY.
BY DR. HALE.
Ploracy evidences an affec-
tion of the lining of the chert,
which much resembles bank-
note paper in consistency.
Its ii s symptom is a com-
plaint of tigh'ness, acom-
panied by a folding together
of the bands, and a heaving
up of the whites of tne eyes.
The patient pajs little atren-
iion, or anything else, to what-
ever does not concern himself
Neither the lives or happi-
ness of others, nor the duty
he owes to them, are in the
h ast respected, whilst his own
Pluracy engrosses all his in-
terest. It absorbs his enti/e
lystero, and even the tips ol
his fi ygers are aff cfei by ihe
malady, as they keep nervously
clutching at everything that
comes in their way.
The predisposing causes are
intense greediness, and a ter-
rible slothfulness to do one's
work properly. The greedi-
ness is extraordinary. A
Plu'alist, or one who is
touched wiib Pluracy, is always noted for having an enormous s*ailow. Nothing, apparently,
satisfies him. The more he has, the more he craves for; and the more he receives the
wider he opens his mou'h to receive more. This continual gaping for the good things of this
world is one of the peculiar characteristics of the disease. The consequence is that it begets
an unnatural appetite, wDich is as offensive to witness as it is difficult to gratify. The produce
of several parishes has frequently been consumed to eatiate his inordinate cravings. His
wants btcome so exacting, that it has beeu calculated five or six bard-working clergymen
could live with comparative ease and comfort on the mere amount he spends every year in
luxuries alone.
The slothfulness connected with Pluracy is not less extraordinary. It is a well-known

physical fact, that it is much easier to eat and
drink and consume the allowance of four or five
persnis than to do their" work. The consequence
is au overpowering indolence that incapacitates
the person so indulging for the commonest
duties, and the Pluralist evinces all the-e symp-
toms. His apathy becomes a disease. He jr.o»s
fat and obese, and is painfully slow to move.
He gives up walking, and rides ab >u*. iu carnages,
the herees of which are not less fat and sleek
than himself. His body expands almost visibly,
and about his cheeks, that are burstingly round
and full, there is frequently a warm poit-win-3
hue that in time communicates itself also to his
nose. He can scarcely keep himself awake, ex
cepting to his own interests, and his eyesight
becomes so impaired tha' it is as much as he
can do to dis'inguish right from wrung. A
general drowsiness creeps, ovtr his actons, and,
rnough not much given to preaching, it is very
rarely he has the enegv to precise even the
lir.'le tha'. he preaches. It is not often he is seen
in church, and, when he does go, it is not an
unusual thing for him to be caught napping; in
fac', his whole religious life is mostly character-
ised by the latter failing.
The only cure for Plur*cv is an entire reform
of the corrupt system. Bleeding m«y be freely
resorted to. The more a Plu'alist is bled, the
better he will fetl for the relief. A low diet is
like *ise recommended, with a reduced scale of
indulgences commensurate with respectable
living; for it must be understood that it is the
abuse of living, just as if a man had as many
lives as a cat, that tends to the evil of Piuracy.
At the same time, the living ought to be fully
ample aod nourishing, taking care to avoid every-
thing like excess or luxury. In his diet, it will
be as well to guard against too many soles.
Above all, make him work. There would soon
be an end to the scandalous complaint of
Pluracr, if every Pluralist was compelled to earn
his Living.

Aitt—" Charley it my darling"
Charlpy was so daring, so daring, so daring,
Charley was so daring, yet somehow durstn't fi?.ht;
For Cronstadt looked so scaring, so scaring, so scaring,
Cronstadt looked so bearing, it frightened him outright.
L's forts he vowed he'd shatter, he'd shatter, he'd shatter,
The forts he swore he'd shatter, no stone of them should stand:
But ibis was merely chatter, mere after-dinner chatter,
He chaEged his note when soberly the stones them elves he scanned.
"Your cutlasses prepare boyn, prepare boys, prepare boys,
For victory depends upon the sharpness of your fire;
But at Cronstadt we '11 but, sta-e boys, but stare boys, but stare boys,
Then home again iu safety all right gallantly retiie.
And if t.L -y ask us why, boys, our strength we didn't try, boys,
'Stead of taking it for granted if we fought that we'd be beat;
'Twas the fault o: Jimmy Gkaham, the swab (I'd like to flay him !)
Who with boys and with old women had maimed our precious fleet."
And now the War ii over. Sir Charley's turned a rover,
And arm in arm With Constantinb inside the forts has seen;
And he swears 'twas deuced lucky he more prudent was than plucky,
Or sunk and smashed and shattered every ship of his had been!
Now with all respect for Charley, who did his work so rarely,
Punch holds that British oak's as tongh as 'twas in Dibdin's day;
And Punch states without shrinking, he's not. alone in thinking,
Tnat a Is i.i.- un would have taken where a Napier turned away.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF FLOGGING.
In directing attention to the subjoined extract from a letter in the
Morning Pott, we btg our readers to observe that i'r. is a mere letter
that we quote, and not our refined and lately much improved contem-
porary's text. The writer is remarking on the subject of flogging at
iliton: in defence of which vile practice he says :—
"Now I could vouch that, from the earliest ages to Ihs immortal Krate and thence
to thoae ol the preterit head-mas'er, rbey have, one and all, appealed to the very neat of
honour. Experi'ntii docet 1 And mark me; flogging used with sound judgment, is
the only fuudamental principle upon which our large schools can be properly conducted.
"1 am all the better for it, and am, therefore,
"Ohb who has bbbn wkll SWISHED"
Is the old dunce who perpetrated the attempts at joking contained in
the foregoing stuff, ant underlined them to indicate that they were
meant for jokes—is such an obsolete blockhead all the better for having
heen flogged? Cou'd a worse booby exist? Can he have been a greater
fool btfo e he was flogged than he is now tnat he has been fljaged?
Is he not p'ainly ii corrigible P If he were not, we should recommend
him to get himself coTec'ed by submitting once more to the degrading
infli ction which he advocates with snch gust, aid the i ea of which is
bo disgusting to everybody else tbat can be dir-gnsted by aujthing.
We speak with reference to you'g men—leaving children out cf the
question—considered as the subjects of Eton discipline. There is a
cant o manly roughoes", as well as a cant of maudlin sentimentality.
B >th are sentimental affecations. As there are maudlin sentimentalists
who think it interesting and pretty to pat convicted criminals, to there
are manly sentimentalists who consider it fine, and stern, and bluff, and
old English, to stand up for the shameful fligellation of lads woo iu
law only are not joung men. When we find a manly sentimentalist
advocating the rod, we nenerally disc over that he has been at a public
ichool, and see pre ty elea'ly that his eulogy of flagging procerds from
an opinion tbat it has made an txceedingly fiue and clever fellow of
himself: an opinion tometimes very errontouj.
W AixiBS by the side of the Serpentine the other day, we saw a notice
—"Tbe public are requested to protect the wa'er-'owl." We could
see no water-owl. Could they have meant the foul water—the innu-
merable gallons of mock green-pea soup?

ST. GEORGE AT STAMBOUL.
{To the Venerable Mrs. Gamp.)
Mr Dear Mbs. Gamp,
What a pity it is that we cannot consistently abuse that
Palmerston for advising Her Majestt to confer the Knighthood of
the Garter on the Sultan! How many nice changes we might have
rung on the enormity of bestowing the Older of St. George on the
chief disciple of the Arabian impostor, were we but qualified to be the
bell-ringers! What a ding-dong we might have made up out of Peter
the Hermit, Godfrey op Bouillon, Richard Cceur de Lion, and ]
all the heroes of the Crusades, invoking their glorious shades to testify
against, and avenge, the desecration! But, bias! St. George is for
us a myth. We know no Saints but the Apostles and the Evangelists.
St. George, considered from our point of view, is a mere Popish
Saint. He is nothing more than a venerable chimera, like the British
Lion, or the British Unicorn.
We have too much reason to believe that he was a sad rogue, who,
through a confusion of circumstances, got foisted into the calendar:
that he was an officer of the Roman commissariat who cheated in
bacon, was forced to abscind, entered the Church, turned Atian,
became Archbishop op Alexandria vice Athakasius dethroned,
oppressed his people in the most abominable manner, was cast into
gaol bke Joe Smith, and ultimately, foreshadowing the fate of the
Mormon it c Prophet., got lynched by the mob. It is only too probable
that the legendary drsgon which St. George is represented as spearing,
meant, originally, a personage no greater nor less than the orthodox
Athanasius himself!
But for these unfortunate considerations, what a forest of mediceval
lances we might have hurled upon the Premier, what a clatter of
battle-axes we might have raised about his head, what a lot of partisans
we might 1 ave masted on our side, borrowing them from the old
armoury, to dig him in the ribs withal!—Unhappily it is no go.
St. George has become the patron of Etglarid much in the same
way that Guy Eawkis, if several sges of darkness were to succeed this
enlightened one, might come to be enrolled among the Brit ish worthies.
The history of the Saint is too well known to allow you and me to raise
any cry, that would not be generally laughed at, aeaintt the Queen's
principal adviser, and the tool of Russia, for profaning the Order which
flouruhes under the tutelage of St. George.
On the contrary, I am a*raid it will be argued, with too much reason,
that, by the admission of Abdul Medjid into a brotherhood of
Christian chivalry, Her Majesty, acting under the advice of her Prime
Minister, has done more than is ever likely to be effected by Exeter
Hall towards inducing the Grand Turk to abjure the errors of
Mahometanism.
The next step will be—and what may we not expect when all power is
lodged in the hands of one man ?—to confer on the Popg the honorary
membership of the Royal Society, and to invite his Holiness to join
the Anti-Slavery-Association, and exert bis influence in promotion of
its truly Catholic objects by creating some m-gro a cardinal, and
sending his black eminence to assert the equality of the human race in
the capacity of Archbishop op Kansas. Believe me, my dear old
Mrs. Gamp, Ever affectioimte]y Yours,
P.S.-Try Seager and Evans. *3®jiCS{.
HAIRBRAINED FOLLY.
A Barber's advertisement is kind enough fo inform us of the fact
that "Lost Hair can be restored." Now, we never met with a heBd so
largely endowed with the bump of acquisitiveness thaf, having lost its
hair, was anxious to have it brought back again; nor we cannot very
well understand what the puzzled owner would do with all the hair,
when it was restored to him! Fancy an officious housekeeper, or
zealous valet, bringing to a bald-headed gentleman a large sack, and
sajing to him, "Please, Sir, jou have been losing your hair now for
the last ten years, I have taken the liberty, Sir, of restoring it to you.
You will find every hair you have lost, Sir, iu this here Sack." Don't
you think it highly probable that such a domestic would, for his
egregious stupidity, be politely presented by the master with the Sack
in return?

!" faintly borne,
their oozy beds.
The mntfin-bell proclaims the parting day,
The City clerks wind, weary, to their tea,
The C usher cookward plods his steady way,
And leaves the streets to Bill Sykes and to me.
Now far and wide there's not a Blue in sight,
Like harmless loungers, safe our watch we hold,
Save that we grasp the life-preserver tight,
And the garotte arrange in artful fold.
Meanwhile from yonder station-house the snore
Of sleeping Crushers makes it very plain,
That Blues who snoozi when they the streets should scour,
Will ne'er molest our solitary reign.
Within those well-warmed rooms Inspectors paid
Out of the parish rates the peace to keep,
Each in h>s watch-coat warm and snugly laid—
The mild protectors of the public—sleep.
The choking call of
With the garotte
Cries of "Police!"
No more will rouse them
For them at morn no pompous beak shall turn
To the charge-sheet mode out so neat and square,
No prisoner nabb'd shall swell the night's return,
Or grace the hand-cuffs o'er the Inspector's chair.
Of', did the cook-maid to their flatt'ries yield,
Their fast fcow oft the rabbit-pie hath broke:
How ii.aijy wx area's beeu their triumph's field,
Hoir much cold meat laU'n 'mat i their sturdy stroke!
Let not harsh censure mock their nightly toil,
Their stolen chats and area conquests sure;
Nor Ricuabd Maybe with too much strictness spoil
The shoit and simple suppers they procure.
Nor you, householders, fix on them the fault,
If no cold joint e'er lasts its second day,
While through the cupboard-shell and pautry-vault
Tbe hungry household cat is free to stray.
Can mild reproof, or anger's hasty gust
Back to its dish the rabbit-pie restore?
Can master's threat recall the flakey crust,
Or wipe the mopped-up beer from off the score P
Perhaps in some neglected spot is laid
A heart, well staffed, brown from the kitchen fire,—
Meat, that to water hermit's chop9 had made,
Or waked a vegetarian's desire!
Say, if it goes, can nought your wrath assnageP
No hint of area-sneak a or cats that stroll?
Must Missus wiih tbe Cook fly in a rage,
And the Police still come in for the whole?
Full many a gem of the Fm'rald Isle so green,
The dark ungarnished Crusher's coat may wear;
Can you expect such flowers to blush unseen,
Or fill their stomachs with the chill night air?
Some villaee Lovelace, whom with dauntless breast,
Rustic Clabi8SAs painfully withstood;
Some mute inglorious Dando here may rest';
Some Soyeb, with a genius for food.
The'smiles of real ladies to command,
Glances to win from more than cookmaid's eyes,
Dinners and supp jrs in good style to stand,
And area-snacks and broken meat despise,
Their means forbade—nor circumscribed alone,
Their loves ar.d pockets, their beats, too, cocfiued:
Forbade to make the pot-bouse chair their throne,
And floor their glass like tiuncheonless mankind.
Far from the dangerous scenes of London life—
Garottes and Life-Preseivers— let them stay,
And past the area-railings, free from strife,
Pursue the harmless tenor of their way.
For me, who for the Crusher snoring laid,
Do in these lines obvious excuses state—
If ever to the Hulks or Portland led
Some pal should kindly ask about my fate—
Haply may some grey-headed warder say,
Oft have we seen him, in the convict rank,
Brushing wi'h measured steps the dust away
From off the mill, or working at the crank.
There in the school-room where the boys they teach,
The Cbaplain he would queer, upon the sly;
Glib texts would quote, or contrite mug would |tretcb,
Tipping the wink to pals, that sniggered by.
When, in the chapel, duller rogues would scorn
The Parson's pains that to convert 'hem strove;
He still would sigh both afternoon and morn,
And in his tearless eye his knuckles shove.
One morn I missed him on tbe 'customed mill,
Nor at the crank, nor oakum-room was he.
Another came his vacant cell to fill,
His game had proved the ticket—he was free.
And in our Office here the other day,
Upon the prison-books I found him borne,
As one who, with his ticket sent away.
Would any station (house) in life adorn."

If Life-Preserver or Garotte you're worth,
Oh youth, to Portland and the Hulks though known,
The capital you'll find the snuggest berth,
Its wide unguarded suburbs all your own.
Long though your sentence and your task severe,
The pious dodge a ticket toon will send:
You give the Chaplain all he asks, a tear,
You '11 fiud the Crusher (all you wish) a friend.
No farther seek the system to expose,
Or stop the ticket Colonel JVbb bestowed;
To spoil the child the British public chose.
Aid on the grown-up Convict spares the rod.
that's Terribly Wanted.
A Gkf at deal of labour has been usefully spent in making the
dresses of ladies uninflammable, but no measures have as yet been taken
(mumurs Jenkins) to protect the young gentlemen! This neglect
is all the more extraordinary, when we consider that scarcely a day
puses in society without some spark or other taking fire at the sight
of some beautiful young lady!
Another Impudent attempt at GABOTrmo.—Russia trying all it
can to shut up the mouths of the Black Sea and the Danube!

acts in connection with the first performance at the Windsor Theatre,
which was the origin of his notoriety, we can have no doubt that he
belongs to a class of persons whose misdeeds are punished when they
ought to have been prevented. Phrenologists' shop-windows are full
of casts of the heads of gentlemen of that class—unfortunate gentle-

them, their recurrence is as
great a certainty as the re-
currence of a tax-collector.
Nor to the "Constant
the details of these acci-
dents, is there even the ad-
vantage of variety. For the
manner of their happening
which is jury-stereotyped,
that "no blame attaches to
the servants of the com-
pany." The causes he is sure f o find in every case are either "absence
of a signal-man" (on portei's duty at the station, which is baF-amile
off and worked shorthanded), or "breakdown of a goods' train;" and
so long as, for economy, signal-men are hired at the age of nine or ten,
and goods' trains are started off in front cf the Express, with not
above a minute's margin for escape by shunting, the effects of these
causes are as sure a sequitur as is a policeman to the heels of j our
decanters.
Especial notice has, however, been directed lately to the excessive
rate of travelling at which our trains are run, their pace indeed not.
seldom proving literally a killing one. There is, however, we are bound
to say, an exception to the rule in the Eastern Counties Kail way, which
it would apoear is, iu tome respects, not so black as has been painted.
In point of speed at any rate it shows a Balutary contrast to tho*e
dangerous excesses which other Lines are prone to, and, in fact, affords
to nervous travellers the comfort of a slowness not elsewhere to be
looked for. We learn, for instance, from a mass of printed evidence
that has reached us in the form of pamphlets that have been publicly
distributed, and which we therefore break no confidence in citing, that
the average pace at which the Eastern Counties ordinary trains are
ran, so far from being excessive, barely exceeds that of an average
donkey's gallop. Indeed, we understand that the Directors have been
actually challenged by a sporting-minded costermonger, who has offered
to back his "moke" against their fastest engine— which wc should
imagine he presumes to be a donkey engine. As we do not keep a
racing prophet, and probably should not be much the wiser if we did,
we cannot predict with any certainty when the match will come off;
but the arrangements we believe are in the hands of a Committee,
which has been formed for introducing the spirit of progress into the
Company's proceedings, and of showing them that their advancement
is dependent upon that of their passengers, to whom they now appa-
rently consider time to be no object. Owing to defects in what is
called the "rolling stock," which from the way they roll about we
presume includes tne carriages, it appears the Eastern Counties train*
are at present not less slow than sure of breaking down; and indeed
are advantageous only in tbeir being trains of thought, for the period
tbey are used to occupy in transit affords, we are informed, abundant
time for meditation.
As competition generally brings about a change, the engines will
probably be put upon their metal, now they have been threatened with
a donkey to compete with them: and if t he Directors duly profit by
this asinine rivalry, we may hope next Bradshaw to see them turning
over a new leaf, or they may find that their "delays are dangerous" to
their interests. As regards the Committee who are now so zealously
endeavouring to train the Eastern Counties in the way that it should
go, we wish them heartily good speed, until they somehow have
induced the Company to guarantee it.
Reader" in his newspaper of already, and is accused of having evinced once more, ought not to be
treated as criminal. Either they weie bom with imperfect organ-
isations, or their education has been neglected. An endeavour should
be made to soften those natures of theirs which too nearly resemble
_ . the natnres of ferocious animals, and to dtvelope in tbeir minds the
he can quote as many pre-1 germs of humanity. They ought to be treated with gentleness and
cedents as for the statement, forbearance, and dealt with on the principles ot love and mercy. We
see, from time to time, advertised in the papers, a school for young
gentlemen whose minds are so peculiarly constituted that the ordinary
methods of tuition are inapplicable to them. It seems a pity that
Lord Ernest Yane Tempest was not rent to such a school. If all
}oungmen who behave as he has behaved were taken ia time—were
they placed under due control and put into proper tiaining, as soon as
ever they showed themselves prone to the commission of furious
assaults and shameful outrages—very few of them would come to point
a moral expressed in a copy of verses, and to adorn a tale printed on
the worst paper, and illustrated by a woodcut representing a horrid
spectacle.

The Images of London.
If any of our London statues should be preserved to Posterity, it
will be supposed in a'ter ages that they were all of them executed
under the influence of Chloroform, since that substance is an anaesthetic
agent.
SINGULAR COMMERCIAL FAILING.
It is a strange failing, and one I cannot account for in the English
character (says a high authority in the City): but, a man of honour, of
unblemished integrity, no sooner becomes a Director of a public Coro-
Saoy, than frequently he seems to lose all his private honesty. An
onourable msn does things as a Director, which he would scoru to do
in his private capacity of banker, or tallow-chandler. There must be
some obliquity in the commercial vision ; for I have noticed that, a man's
eyes will see the smallest speck of dishonesty quite quick enough in his
own counting-house, but that when he is seated in tne board-room of a
Committee, be quietly winks at things ten thousand times worse!

MARY ANN'S NOTIONS.
EAR MR. PUNCH",—"I DID
not suppose it possible that,
you could be so rude and
unkind as you showed your-
self a fortnight ago, wben 1
wrote you a letter iffdring to
become your correspondent.
1 declare, when I read that
letter in print, with a picture
in the corner, not the least
bit in the world like me
(though, 1 admit, rather pretty
a its way), I coloured up to
the tip-top of my forehead,
and I am sure that if I had

been melted off in a minute.
My letter was not intended
to be print< d, as you must
have known. I could quite
have cried over it, only I
remembered a very pretty
and gentle speech ot my
brother Augustus's about
crying. He said that tears
from a woman mean no more
than swearing in a man, and
that neither demonstration ought to pioduoe the least effect upon a rational mind. This

may do just
But as yon are good enough to say, in your condescending way, that '1
what I like,' I shall put my dignity on one side, and occasionally give you some of my
Notions.
"I spoke in my letter (which you had no right to publish) about Giving it to the Men.
But, really, my dear Punch, when one comes to think aoout it, they seem to me what Sbak-
speke calls 'such small game.'1 Fancy an earnest woman setting herself to satirise the
young men of the present day! That they should try, in their weak way, to satirise us is likely
enough, and that, they should be able to find nothing worse to say against us than old twaddle of
which an Eton boy of seventeen would be ashamed. What is it, they go on repeating about us,
and thinking it smart to say P That we take pains with our looks and diets. As if a man did
not judge a woman by her jooks and dress, and as if all the men in a room do not invariably
cluster round the prettiest and best dressed girl present, though she may be the greatest goose
in existence.1 Well, if we do take pains to look well, th»s is surely our homage to the intellectual
Lords of the Creation, who are caught like mackarel. A little pearl powder and carmine, and
a good deal of satin, and how you3 come swimming round, with your wise eyes, and mouths
half open to be ready to talk nonsense; while the cleverest woman in the room (to be sure,
you show sense in keeping out of her way) may sit and count the flowers in her bouquet, or
the number of grins you make in trying to attract the pretty doll's attention.
"Then we like babies, or, as some ot the coarsest of you say, pretend to like them. Mothers
talk about them! How wondeiful! I have not got any babies, but the wonder to me is how
mothers who have can ever talk about anything else. The darling wee things, with tfeir lit'le
pink hands and a'abaster faces! But I do admit that in one poiat of view a mother is foolish.
To fondle and love and teach a boy-baby, with the possibil''y of his growing up into one of the
ridiculous animals with dra*ls, all-round collars, and affecta'ion, that infest our drawing-
rooms, is rather absurd. I do not wonder that young men, seeing in one another what they
are, feel surprised that we are fond of children. A* for pretending to like babies—why should
we Dretend it? Docs one pretend to like flower", or strawberries, or crystallised green gage ?1
Is it to please your High M'ghtineases that we should do it ?—you, not one of whom in a
thousand cm apprec;ate the aflVc ion felt by an innocent woman for an innocent helpless baby.
Bat 1 am avhamed cf answering such commooplpce. nonsense.
"Well, then, we talk a good oeal. We do, because we talk well and pleasantly. We are
not vu'gir stra'ners after eff'Ct, always trying to say smart thing?, nor do we 'chaff,'—(O, I
know all those words), but. we are at. our ea<e, and try to please the persons we talk to.
Besides, we know something, for we listen to the conversa'ion of old people,' and read a
good many books. Heaven help the hearers, if, with our facilities for talking, we poured

over them.
You needn't leave your Card, much less your
Ticket-of-Leave, behind you, because if your host
troubled himsrlf in the least by attempting to
return your call, you would only be putting him
to a great deal of inconvenience, and besides you
would not be able to treat him with the same
hospitality. Moreover, such visits, paid, as they
are, with such little ceremony, are never expected
to be returned.
Should you, by any accident, meet with a
policeman, do not behave meanly or discour-
teous'y to him, but invite him by all means to join
your little festive party, unless he should prefer
to keep watch for you by remaining outside.
Morbid Philanthropy,
As a proof of the nnndlin benevolence that
is so largely on the tapis at the present day,
we may as well mention that there is some
soft-hearted, soft-beaded philanthropist, who is
actually advertising every day: "Don't beat
your Cabpkts." We suspect that this tender
creature must be a brother of the lady who is
always putting to tbe public the agonising
question: "Do you bruise your Oats'"' Some
other Howard of the pantry will be next jumping
up among.tt the advertisements, and perpetually
bawling on*, "Ladies, you surely are not so
cruel as to Whip a Syllabub!"
What is a Comet?
Monsieur 3abj.net, one of the most distin-
guished members of the French Academy of
Science, answers the above question by very
learnedly explaining that "a Comet is a visible
nothing." The same explanation might be given
with regard to many of the Comets and Stars
in our theatrical firmament. For instance, what
is Mr. Murdoch at the H«ymark-t, but,
sidereally viewed, "A Visible Notbing?"

A TREMENDOUS MUSICAL RUN.
Is an article on the Children of Great Men in a well
known periodical, we .have stumbled over the following
paragraph:—
11 The most striking example known to us is that of the family which
boasted Jean Sebastian Bach as the culminating illustration of a
musical genius which, more or leas, was distributed oyer three hundred
Bachs."
We think we may call the above instance of assiduity
the longest game at leap-frog that wai ever played in the
world. Fancy Genius leaping perseveriugly "over Three
Hundred Bachs," regularly one after another, until at last
it came, panting and out of breath, to Jean Sebastian.
No wonder it alighted, as it did, on his shoulders, for
Genius must have been fairly tired of clearing so many
"Bachs," without finding a suitable resting-place where it
could worthily settle.
ANOTHER WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR!
Thebe may be seen every day in the advertising columns
a delicate compliment paid to "Our Special Correspond-
ent"—a compliment all the more delicate, because it is
evidently unintentional. Toe compliment takes the shape
of a Bookstller's advertisement, which lays in type, not
less bold than the Truth, the unhesitating fact:—
THE COMPLETION OF THE WAR—BY WILLIAM
RUSSELL.
We congratulate our courageous confrere on this tardy
acknowledgement of his merits. We rejoice to find
that, in some honourable quxHers at least, the pith of the
Peace is fairly attributed to William Russell's Pen!
Russia's Firm Friends.
The rumour that one of the leading firms that have
taken the Russian railway loan is the hou-e of Basing, is
t he invention of some horrid wag, but good patriot, who has
laboured at once to make a sort of pun agamst the Russian
Bear, and to spoil the Russian Bear's project by the sug-
gestion of bearing.
j MB, PUNCH'S HOSPITAL EOR DECAYED AND INDIGENT
QUOTATIONS.
This excellent Institution, established by the benevolent Mr. Punch
for the renovation of those threadbare scraps of poetry which we see
daily scattered over the columns of periodicals, has been found of the
utmost service in rescuing many of these worn-out quotations from
their wandering life. To appreciate the benefits of this Institution, it
is only necessary to read a few of the lamentable cases which have been
forwarded to the hospital in the hope of obtaining relief.
L A tattered-looking creatuie. yclept, "When ignorance is bliss 'tis
folly to be wise," applied for admission, stating that it had recently
been unmercifully used in certain educational speeches. This poor
applicant, however, was found on examination to be so threadbare as
to render impracticable any attempt at renovation. After leaving the
hospital we have heard that it applied to the officers of the "United
Kingdom Temperance Alliance," and was furnished with new clothing
by the ingenious Mb. Pope. In its renovated state we understand it
appears as " When temperance is bliss 'tis folly to be drunk."
2. Another applicant, from the country, who bore the name of "trip
it on the light fantastic toe," told such a piteous tale of abuse by country
journalists in their descriptions of dances, &c, that Mr. Punch, in his
virtuous indignation, vowed to apply his "light fantastic toes" to any
such persons who might come in his way. Happening, however, in
the height of his wrath to kick Toby, he became calmer, and called for
the next applicant, (3) who was named, "One may smile and smile, and
be a villain,'.' and who deposed that it bad seen a great deal of service in
various remarks upon certain gentlemen, who of late have made some-
what free with money intrusted to their hands. Mr. Punch said that
though this candidate for admission bore the marks of a villain in its
face, he would see what could be done for it. A new suit was ac-
cordingly supplied to it, to which Mr. P. begs to draw the attention of
the learned belligerents, who contend in the columns of the Times about
the origin of the Stereoscope:—" One may grow angry and grow angry,
and be no better for it." 4. "Heatts of Oak," another applicant, pre-
sented a heart-rending condition, having been completely worn out in
speeches relating to the late war. Mr. Punch respectfully dedicating it
to Sir Charles Napier, begs to change this into "Heads of wood."
Many other quotations, who applied for admission, were relieved or
renovated in an equally judicious manner, and Mr. P. hopes that after
the trouble he has taken, he will never again, see these quotations in
their ancient form.
UNPLEASANTNESS IN THE VINEYARD.
The nature of the Vine Disease appears to have been discovered at
last: a remedy for it bavirg been found, which, if similarity of cure
implies similarity of complaint, can leave little room for doubt as to
the character of the disorder. We quote from the Times:—
"The Vine Disease.—Letters from Messina, dated the 4th instant, state that the
application of sulphur 10 the vines in Sicily has been found very successful, and in
scarcely any instances, when done.in time, has it been known to fall."
Here we bare, apparently, a case in which vegetable and human
therapeutics, and therefore human and vegetable myology, meet. The
consideration obviously suggested by this fact is, that one ought to be
gl«d that one's vocation is not that of a vine-dresser. Pruning, or
otherwise handling the vine, must be a service of danger. The diseased
vine should, for the sake of precaution, be labelled with the well-known
legend implying that nobody can touch it with impunity. It labours
uiider a cu'aneous affection, for which sulphur is a »pecific, and which,
accordingly, there is too much reason to fear, nrght prove contagious.
The Greedy Boy.
There's King Clicquot, who is so greedy, that, not content with
the German Dirt, he's always crying out for a piece of Neufcbatel!—
as though the Prussian dinner-sty wasn't complete without its little
morfeau of Neufcb&tel! But perhaps Clicquot > hinks that the flavour
of his champagne would be considerably improved by the addition of an
entree that he evidently considers "quite the cheese." , ■ . i
"WIT ON THE DOWNS.
Lady Crinoline fell from her horse the other day at Brighton, but
fortunately received no injury. However, some wicked wag wrote a
long account of the accident, and sent it the next day to all the
local papers with the malicious heading, "Perilous Descent oe a
Balloon."

SCOTLAND SNUBBED.
There can be no doubt in the breast of any impartial Scotchman
that a conspiracy has a lonr time existed among Englishmen; in fact,
the plot has become an English affair—to Snub Scotland. O'herwise,
it has been and is forcibly put—otherwise, why the exclusive use of the
word English, which simply implies things of England, to the con-
temptuous disuse of British, that comprehends both countries? In
our thriving contemporary, the Caledonian Mercury, the case is admir-
ably put. Indeed, the columns of the Mercury seem especially chosen
by all patriotic Scotchmen with a grievance. Thus, when in his recent
lectures, our tender and judicious Tha.ck.bbay, with gentlest breath
that would have scarcely stirred a white rose-leaf, ventured to say
something of the living and vivacious dust of Maky Queen of Scots,
there was great indignation. The perferviditm genium Scotorum glowed
at white heat; and sundry patriots in the Mercury did battle for Mary.
proving her every bit as nice and as judicious as our virgin Elizabjsth,
whose chastity, like a cAevaux.de/rise defied even cavalry. However,
Thackeray has made his peace; and Mary rests, like a folded, lily,
every bit as pure as when Thackeray entered Edinburgh.
And now in the Mercury a Scottish patriot draws his claymour steel-
pen for bis country. He writes, and what is more cruel, brings in
Alison : —
"Even historians, ALlsox.'for Instance, constantly use the.word English, a mere
translation from the French, who have no word for Britain except that of their own
old Province. Some years ago a letter was published under the heading; of ' Lobd Pal-
jfSBSTON and the Qubkn's English,' according to which his Lordship gave assurance
that, in UBing on some occasion which caused remark in Scotland, the woid English and
England, he meant no disparagement to Scotland, Ireland, or Wales."
And the potato slept quietly under the slight; so did the leek—but not
so the thistle. Nemo me impune! Nevertheless, it is a part of a system
to annihilate Scotland.
"I cannot help thinking that there Is a systematical design In some petty-minded
quarter to consign the word Scotland to oblivion, and that the custom above mentioned
has been introduced surreptitiously by underlings in public, departments without the
knowledge of persons in authority."
And when we consider the number of Scotch clerks in public
departments in England—cleik* who originally swam the Tweed,
carrying their clothes in a bundle in their teeth—the neglect, the
ingratitude on their part is the more atrocious. Scotchmen, it is
known, generally bring with thtm to Eogland a very beautiful accent;
and yet it is painful to witness the designs, yes, the "systematical
designs " on the part of Eoglish wives to take the very words out of
their Scotch husbands' mouths, and so to deprive them of their own
lovely Doric. We have known the des:gn so far succeed that after
only one year's residence in England a Scotchman has wholly forgotten
the Scotch bawbee in favour of the English shilling.
We think, with the Mercury's c6nespondent, the whole matter in its
length, breadth, and depth worthy of gravest consideration. Why
should there be anything exclusively English, and why not everything
comprehensively Biitish? Let the word English henceforth cease and
determine; ana let us enter into a national bond to use only the word
B itish.
For instance, let an English fcg be a British Mist:
Let the English Constitution be a British Fact:
Let. an English Mastiff be a British Tyke :—
And, above all, and as a great sustaining hope, and comfort, and
consolation unto all men, henceforth let the Bank of England bt—.l
British Bank!
A STIR FOE SEACOLE.
Dame Seacoie was a kindly old soul,
And a kindly old soul was she;
You might call for ynur pof, jou might call for your pipe,
In her tent on " the Col so free.
Her tent on " the Col," where a welcome toll
She took of the passing throng,
That from Balaklava to toe front
Toiled wearily along.
That berry-brown face, with a kind heart's trace
Impressed in each wrinkle sly,
Was a sight to behold, through the snow-clouds rolled
Across that iron sky.
The cold without gave a zest, no doubt,
To the welcome warmth within:
But her smile, good old soul, lent heat to the coal,
And power to the pannikin.
No store she set by the epaulette,
Be it worsted or gold-lace;
For K.C.B., or plain private Smith,
She had still one pleasant face.
But not alone was her kindness shown
To the hale and hungry lot,
Who drank her grcg and eat her prog,
And paid their honest shot.
The sick and sorry can tell the story 1
Of her nursing and dosing deeds.
Regimental M.D. never worked as she
In helping sick men's needs.
Of such work, Cod knows, was as much as she chose,
That dreary winter-tide,
When Death hut g o'er the damp and pestilent camp,
And his scythe swung far and wide.
And when winter past, and spring at last
Made the mud-sea a sea of flowers,
Dogbunt, race and review her brown face^knew,
Still pleasant, in sunshine or showers.
Still she'd take her stand, as blithe and bland,
With her stores, the jolly old soul—
And—be the right man in the right place who can—
The right woman was Dame Seacolb!
She gave her aid to all who prayed,
To hungry, and sick, and cold:
Open hand and heart, alike ready to part
Kind words, and acts, and gold.
And now the good soul is 'in the hole,'
What red-coat in all the land,
But to set her upon her legs again
Will not lend a willing hand?
Humanity in the Slave Market.
The New Orleans Delta insists that "the African slave trade and
African slavery conducted on humane principles, and regulated by law,
must have the preference over every other form of compulsory labour."
When Humanity has quite settled itself as a slave-dealer, of course we
shall have Philanthropy beginning business as a housebreaker, and
Rectitude making its way through a crowd as a pickpocket.

WITCHCRAFT IN MODERN EUROPE.
he belief in witches,

hastily ahju'ed by
tbeir less wine des-
cendants. There c m
be do reasonable
doubt that, a num-

witches, ate now,
at the present ail-
ment, riding about
Europe on thei
several broomsticks
sowing discord and
dissension, as busy
as the G and Mas-
ter of their Order
is proverbially taid
to be in a gale of
wind. There is, in
tbe first place, old
mo*ber Romanoff,
widow of that cele-
brated but unfor-
tuna'e Wizard of
the North, the late
Czar Nicholas. Alexandra Feodohowna is said to be d-voting ber energies
to fomenting, by means of her baleful enchantments, ill will between Victor
Euma-uh, and Fhancis Joseph. Sh" is tbe Hecate of them all. Trie

venom over Hade i and Brussels. Any adventurous traveller who will make
the ascent of the Brocken on May-day night next, will probably enjoy the pleas we
of polkiog in the most illustrious society.

A CASE OF PORK.
Thomas Perkins is an omnibus conductor; ard in so
far as bio religioui prejudice operate, may be considered
a humble imitatot of those lights of piety, Messrs. Spooner
and Newdegate. Mark Levi is a Jew; a descendant
of the f.jfyp'.ian brickmakera. Now Mark, proceeding up
LuHgate Street, is accosted in terms of ribaldry by Psrkins,
wbo mounting t'c top of his omnibus takes up a piece of
poik, and holds it mockingly towards tbe Jew, exclaiming
very foully, "Jew, will you have a bit of this?" It was
unfortunate for Perkins tbat a piece of pork should happen
to be upon his vehicle; otherwise he had not been stimulated
into wrong-doing.
"How oft the Bight or means to do ill deeds,
Make deeds ill done 1"
The unseemly conduct of Perkins is proved before Sir
James Duke who "sharply " accos's the defendant, sayiug, |
"I fine you 20*. and cost*, or in default 14 dayR' Imprisonment. It j
is Dot to he tolerated that respectable citizens of London are to be insulted I
at* they walk aloDg the.streets, merely because they are Hebrews."
At 'he latter part of the day the money was paid, ard
Thomas Perkins was saved an igoomioious jolt in the
prison-van. Wheie the money came from remains a mystery;
nut it wa* whispered about t he court that it had been
subscribed by a few piousreaders of the Standard mightily
commi-eratiti« the case of Perkins, and wi hal denouncing
rhe ii fidelity of the age, when an orthodox 'bu?-conductor
is not permitted to shake a piece of pork in tbe faces of
unbelieving Je«>, the better to illustrate the fervour of his
own Cnris'ianity. And, after all, Perkins is on>y a di>c;ple
of the belief that sha s the House of Commons on the Jew.
Perkins does but imitate his aris'ocratie betters. Why,
Lord Derby even at a Mansion-House dinner declares
bimself staunch to the principles that refuse a sent to
Rothschild in Parliament; and by so doing morkipgly
t-hakes a piece of poik in th« face of the golden Hebrew.

ENGLISH DOMINATION IN EUROPE.
{To the Editor of the Assemble Nationale.)
My dear Contemporary,
You have been considered—you and your friend Le Nord of
Brussels—to have said some rather hard things about perfidious
Albion. Perhaps you have. Rest assured that John Bull has no
desire, still less design, to extend his domination over Europe. It
would cost him much and pay him nothing, you tee. But if he really
did cherish any such project I can quite understand bjw you might
entertain an objection to it, although that may at first sight appear
absurd. If English domination means Anglo-Saxon instiutions, bow
could you feel anything but the reverse of lepuguauce to them—to trial
by j'1, habeas corpus, civil and religious liberty, freedom of speech
and wiiting, parliamentary legislation, constitutional government, and
the abolition of your vexatious, tyrannical, and useless passport
system? Knglish domination would be Continental emancipation:
would yon refuse freedom, and howl for masters in preference, like tbe
canine species?
But perhaps you think th»t English institutions are rather more
numerous than those above named. I suppose you are afra'd that
they include tbe Income-tax, the Court of Chancery, the Law of Divorce
for the rich only, turnpike gates, fraudulent bankers, ticket-of-leave
men, and garotte robberies. And I know not that there may not be
some reason in sucS fear. In that case I must acknowledge tbat you
have some little right to heboid a scarecrow, and a monster, and a
bugbear, in tbe idea of English domination.
Be pleased to accept tbe assurance of the distinguished consideration of
Tour very humble tervunt,
P.S. Believe me, the sale of wives is not one of those British insti-
tutions of which you ctu have any reason to lear the introduction.
AN AWAKENED CONSCIENCE.
We do not often dream of living in Utopia, and but seWom enjoy
those blisi-ful visions of the future, which the mind's eye of the rbap-
sodist, in f.etzy rolling, is enabled to r.evel in. But bow deliriously
should we delight in the surprise, and what a delicious new sensation it
would be to us, if just as we had cracked our second eggshell some fine
morning, and were mrnbg over quietly the third leaf of our Times, our
eye should light suddenly on such a notice as tbe following:—
"The Chancrllor op tiir Eiohrqurr acknowledges the receipt of £20,000 as

NELSON AND NAPIER.
We observed in the papers that a "Miss Nelson, an English Lady,"
had composed some poetry, "addressed to the Emperor of Russia
upon his Coronation;" and that the same "had been graciously
received by his Imperial Majesty." and the fair Muse "rewarded with
an elegant present. We immediately wrote to St. Petersburg for a
copy of the verses in question, and have just received them, transcribed
by the Grass-Duke Constantine, who adds a polite apology for the
delay. Here they are—
Humbly, Czar of all the Russia?,
At thy feet I lay my lays;
Please respect a Lady's blushes,
Who aspires to sing thy praise.
Pray forgive my appellation,
Nelsons now are something new,
Well you know the British nation
Sent no Nelson, Sire, to you.
Frisking, like an aged ape here,
When the war was past and i/one,
Came my country's hero, Napier,
For your courtiers making fun.
I, Sire, am the only Nelson,
You are ever like to see,
And your ships, from truck to kelson,
Are as safe as safe can be.
Charley, who, had he been plucky,
Might have set this town aligut,
Thinks his men were ve>y lucky
That your captains would not fight.
Climax fit to all our failures—
Russia wonders what we are.
While a Napier dreads her sailo's,
And a Nklson lauds her Czar!
r A FREE-BORN BRITON IN BERLIN.'
Mr. Morris Moobe, who is not an admirer of Doctor Waagen,
and does not very much believe in Winterh alter, has been arrested
in Berlin for no other crime, it is supposed, than his want of reverence
for Waagen, and his no admiration for Wintebhalteb. However,
Mr. Morris Moore suffered himself to be led away captive by the
police, without even exclaiming, under the inspiration of Palmerston,
Civis Romanus sum!" He is locked up all night; and as Mr. Moorb
complains, with no convenience to wash himself; as if an} body was
expected to wash himself in Berlin. Mr. Moore is shown into a
dirty den, when the oflioial, grunting Berlin French, observes—" 11 est
permis de dormir, si vous pouvez." This it is to live under a paternal
government. A man is permitted to sleep, if—he can! Mr. Moore
writes to Lord Bloomfield, the British Ambassador, who, clearly, is
not to be disturbed by the imprisonment nf a free-born Briton in
Berlin. Mr. Moore is set at liberty, and Lord Bloompield never
rumples his diplomatic dignity in the matter. In fact what was said
to Mr. Moore is evidently understood of his own duties by Lord
Bloomfield—" It is permitted jou to sleep, if you can," and it is very
plain, his Lordship can.
We have heard at a late hour that Prince Albert has ordered
Doctor Prstorius to write to Mr. Mobbis Moore a letter of
condolence.
Here's a Thought for a Penny!—If "no news is good news,"
then the papers at a penny must be the best of newspapers, for they
scarcely ever contain any news.

Air—" The Sold Dragoon."
I'm in the British Army,
A Cornet on full pay.
And in your column?, Mr. Punch,
I 'il write my duWul lay,
In the hope that some Financier
May read and set to lights,
The miseries which do pertain
To each one who indites
Himself a hold Dragoon,
In the service of oar Queen.
Before I tell our wrongs,
I'll tell jou what we do
To serve our Qubbn and country,
Like soldiers g od and tine.
As in this Isla' d many are
Who most nVm'y believe,
That we have nothing else to do
But (Less well and deceive
Those pretty charming creatures
Who love the bold T
I've got to tumble out at six,
And down to stables go.
To see the horses groomed.'and fed,
No matter rain or snow.
The "Forage" next, the "BreadandMeat,"
The '* Breakfasts" for the men
At nine a ride at funeral pace
With the Troopers until ten:
That's the daily morning's work
Of the jolly young Dragoon.
Mce "Forage " then of course comes in
When jou want to have your feed.
And "Midday stables "'s sure to sound
When you've lit your morning's weed.
But tovjours pret your motto is.
So you buckle on your sword,
And bieathe tbat gentle substantive,
But I daren't, write the word,
So very seldom used
By the proper young Dragoon.

"Dismiss" is scarcely sounded,
And your Cap'ain's lecture o'er,
"Men's dinners and their rooms"
Tbe trumpets sternly roar.
And after that the "Prisoners
If any—jou've to see,
Before you chuck your sword aside,
And feel what 'lis 'o be
An idle joung Dragoon
"Wbo's nothing got to do.
But only until three, my boy,
As then there comes the guard,
And one thing and another make
The duty rather ha'd.
There's Stables" in the evening,
"Watch setting" and "Reports,"
And g ling round 'he sentinels
And some Military sports,
Which makes life pass so easy
To the jolly young Dragoon.
Now comes the subject sore
Which urges me to write—
'Tis that nasty filtby lucre
Without whicb things won't come right;
And Christmas soon is coming
With its file of little bills,
Putting one into th* "Blues,"
And like Britons feel the ills
Tbat are borne by poor devils
In a regiment of DiagoonB.
On entering the Heavie?, the
Gay Hus-ars, or Light,
We all know it in expensive
To keep the two ends right.
But still eiiht bob a day,
After everything's deducted,
Is rather too absurd
When I tell you how it's mulcted
At tbe end of every year
From the jolly young Dragoon.
Two chargers we have got to keep,
For which we've got to pay,
Besides their cost—just eigbtpence each,
For forage every day.
Our bard and mess takes twenty days
Of that eight bob away,
And the Government so liberal
Tbe Income-Tax do stay
From the handsome daily salary
Of the jolly young Dragoon.
Our Batman shillings twelve a month,
Our bifants two pound five;
Say, seven pound ten for dinner, >
'Twill juit keep the soul alive.
For washing and etceteras,
The tear and wear of traps,
To say nothing of our clothing,
Or each change which gives such raps
To the monetary vitals
Of the pauvre young Dragoon.
Now having thus cut up our pay,
They recommend us study,
For why, to see upon the staff
That brick, young Loud Tom Noddy.
He never studied in his life,
But well he did his duty
At Balaklava's fearful charge,
Alt ho' it spoilt bis beauty,
As of many other fellows—
Most plucky young Dragoons.
Now in the House let some swell move
That we dnn'r, pay for Forage,
Nor yet for Bands or Income-Tax,
There will be no demurrage.
'Tis useless qui'e reforms to make
When tbey pay us as they do:
God knows we've done cur duty,
As soldiers good and true,
Which gallant young Dragoons
Will surely always do.
What say you, Mr. Punch,
Don't you quite agree with me,
'Twould be fairer for we soldiers
To have our Band and Forage free?
Heb, Majesty, whom God protect,
Could do it by a word;
Most gracious then the gift would be,
And no blunter be the sword
When called upon to fight
Of each gallant young Dragoon.
Now you've got lots of interest,
Or at least you ought to have,
So try, dr-ar Punch, the question,
And our pockets help to save.
We '11 take you in for ever,
And laugh whene'er you write.
If you'll only like a Trojan
Make the country do what's right
To the Datriotic lot. of men,
Called jolly young Dragoons.
THE SPANISH DANCERS.
Really the Spanish Government reminds us
of the Spanish Babets at the Hay market
Theatre, for the Eame thing has been going on
now at both places with scarcely au alteration
for the last three or four years. There are the
same movements—the eame ins and outs—the
same shuffling and plotting precisely to get hold
of the same heroine at the Haymarket as at the
Escurial. The title of the ballet is changed
every now and then—and so is the name of
the Ministry; but the action in both remains
unaltered, and t he intrigue is just as transparent
as ever. In the ono you have Peeea Nena
with a lot of seedy supernumeraries contending
madly for her hand; in the other you see
the Qceen figuring away as recklessly as ever,
whilst a number of desperate adventurers are
crouching at her feet, ready to cut each
other's throats, or to throw themselves into
the most degrading attitudes, to gain possession
of her smiles. Ballets and Ministries succeed
one ano'ber with equal rapidity, and the great
marvel is, that the people do not grow tired of
the constant repetition of the same insane
thing. On the contrary, they look com-
placently on as though tbey liked it, and even
occasionally break out into a faint murmur of
applause.
We candidly think that the next Ministry
in Spain ou«ht out of gratitude to be offered
to Buckstone, excepting that it is extremely
doubtful whether he \frould sacrifice the manly
spontaneous Biavos of his o vn popular esta-
blishment for the rascally, paid Bbatos that
are a disgrace to the management of Queen

The Two Stools of Southampton.
There appears to be a split among the liberal electors
of Southampton, owing to the desire of a certain section of
them to be represented by a commercial man. Southampton,
notwithstanding all that has lately occurred, still believes in
commercial men. It is "cheering" to Had the commercial
character still standing high in so important a mercantile
place as Southampton. In the meamime the division of
the Liberals bids fair to result in the return of a Tory,
Between the two separated bodies supporting Liberalism,
tt>e Liberal cause seems in danger of coming to the ground.
MR. SPURGEON AND THE BILL-STICKERS.
We would call the attention of Mr. Spurgeon, the Baptist preacher,
to an advertisement which is, or has been, appearing in the Times, and
of which the following is a portion:—
SPURGEON, THE MODERN WHITFIELD.—Those who wish to
learn the cause of the popularity of this modem divine, should read the New Park
Street Pulpit, lu penny weekly numbers, sixpenny monthly parts, or volumes at 6*. 6d.
Sold everywhere. 12 Sermons assorted, free by post for 12 stamps, or six for seven
stamps.
Whether Mr. Spurgeon is able to prevent the publication of
advertisements of this kii.d, or not, we do not know; but if he can, he
should. If we were Mr Spurgeon, we should be greatly annoyed at
being advertised as "Spurgeon, the modern Whitfield." This
means the same thing as Spurgkon, the young Roscius, or Spurgeon,
the Infant Prodigy; and if Ma. Spurgeon's name is thus bruited
about much longer, we shall soon have a race-horse called Spurgeon,
and entered under that denomination for the Derby, Well if it is no
worse; and if the canine intelligence of our sporting contemporary does
not shortly announce that Spurgeon will, for a certain sum, or number
of postage-stamps, in a given time, destroy a stated quantity of rats.
Mr. Spurgeon had better preach a strong sermon in self-defence
against the quackery of taking bis name for the heading of puffs; a
practice which gives him a tort of slang notoriety, calculated to impair
a minister's usefulness—unless he is one of Her Majesty's ministers.
Here is a man whose vocation is expressly that of raising the mind
above worldly considerations, and how the respect due to his reverend
office must be impaired through the association of his name with the
"Guinea Family Bible," "Shirts G for 40*.," and the "Standard or
Natural Sherry I" ,
Sucks and Geese.
The 'report, circulated in the newspapers, that the Duchess of
Atholl had turned Papist, has been contradicted by the Duke, her
husband. If the Jesuits, put her Grace forward as a decoy-duck, she
has turned out a mere ordinary canard.
The Tie of the Tim*.—The garotte-robber differs from the swarthy
Thug in the circumstance of being a white choker.
JARS WITH JARRING NAMES.
In an article on ancient crockery-work, now usually styled the
"Ceramic Art," the Manchester Guardian enumerates divers sorts and
kinds of classical cups and pots for various uses; and among them
mentions :—
"For ointments or perfumes—the lecythus, alabastron, ascos, bombillos, aryballos,
and cotyliscos."
What a nomenclature, young ladies, for the appliances of, the toilet!
eh? What work for the mouth! What grimacfs would attend the
utterance of such cracking and bouncing words!" Jane, fetch me my
lecythus. Where's my alabastroa"? I want my ascos. Have you
seen my bombilios P You will find my aryballos on the dressing-table;
and then look in the drawer for my cotyliscos." These words do not
"sound as if they should be writ on satin," do they? Tbey do not
quite "melt like kisses from the female mouth," but rather appear to
roll and rattle out of it like thunder and hail. What a clatter the old
Greek young ladies, or the young Greek ladies of old, must have been
accustomed to make in calling for their china! It must have resembled
the collision of the alabastron and the lecythus, the bambilios and the
ascos, the cotyliscos and the aryballos, together, with clash of
breakage.
AN ENTIRE IMPOSSIBILITY.

you please, for I want the places for myself, you see, and one on each

Boxkeeper. Very sorry, Sir, but I cannot oblige ycu. I can give you
one seat in front, Sir, and two just behind.

We take pleasure in cilling the attention of
the play-goer, and, especially ol the visitors of the
Ssck-and-Butkin Saloon, to the approaching
benefit of Mr. Sniffles, the active and obliging
box-kreper of that establishment. His urbanity
is only to be equalled by his vigilance. Tbe
courteous del;cacy with which Sniffles hovers
about the box-door, coquetting with the key,
whilst he watches the hand of the visitor in its
repose, or progress towards the breeches pocket,
is certainly not to be surpassed as a bit of real
nature by any acting before the curtain. The
decision, too, with which Sniffles declares every
seat to be taken except the "very back" is re-
markable as proving the physiognomical skill
tbat reads "not a sixpence" in the features of
the party who won't pay for a front place.
Sniffles may now be said to have turned tbe

DANCES FOR THE DAY.
The composers of dancing-music seldom fail to seize upon any
dreadful incident or terrible subject whereon the popular mind is
excited, and to adopt it for the theme of some species of j'g. Alma
and Inkermann were celebrated by Quadrilles; Sebastopol inspired
the composer of either a Wal'z or a Polka, or some other equally
suitable illustration, iu themosical way, of the horrors and the heroism
of war. When one thinks of the mutilations, the ghastly deaths, the
unutterable miseries and agouies which constitute tbe details of war-
fare, one finds it difficult to conceive the state of tbat mind to which
the idea of a battle-field, or a siege, can suggest the fancy of a tkittish
and frivolous tune, intended to provoke and regulate imbecile and
rather ridiculous movements. Such inspiration, one might suppose,
could be derived fiom the notion of carnage and daughter by no kind
of imaginable crrature but a mufical monkey. However, that sort of
inspiration is, in fact, drawn ve<y copiously from tbat souice; and such
being the case, we wonder, now that the war is over, that the rlar.c'Dg-
school of composers do not exercise their genius on the calamities
which still afflict society.
What do )ou say, messieurs, to the Sadleir Galop? Or the Paul
Waltz, or the Robson Polka? You might take the Rogue's March as
tbe basis of your composition. But bow could you, all of you, have
missed the chance which is afforded you by the present fothion of
nocturnal robbery? Of course, this hint will tuflioe )<>u, and we
shall forthwith be gratified by the production of no end or quadril'es,
and so forth, under the title of the Ticket-of-Uave Man and La Qarotte,

[Inquisitive Old Gent on the Box, who has ar-
rived at his destination, is upset for the rest
of the day.

ANOTHER GAEOTTE OUTRAGE.
This diabolical mode of attack appears to be on the increase.
Monday night supplied another victim. The Hon. Mr. Lillipoi,
living m the heart of Belgravia, left his club, "The Beeswing," at
the early hour of ten. The evening, for the early part of December,
was very fine; and Mr. Lillifut, who is a gentleman of singularly
active habits, resolved upon doing his best to walk home. Ma.
Lilliput had dined at The Beeswing." In the pursuit of his
intention, Mr. Lilliput went through St. James's Park and Pimlico,
and, considering that he had so very recently dined, was making rapid
approaches towards Belgravia. When about to turn the corner of a
street, about a hundred yards from his own door, Ms. Lilliput felt a
sudden compression of the throat; his eyes saw double; his head turned
round and he fell upon the pavement, without even the presence of
mind or the power to cry " Police!" In this state, it is supposed the.
unfortunate gentleman must have lain for upwards of two hours; for
he was found as cold as the flags, in a deep stupor, and with a
stertorous breathing, that, we may add, first called the attention of the
policeman to Mr. Lilliput's whereabout. His person was searched,
but nothing was found upon him but his card of address, and his club-
bill for dinner, which—as' we never make this journal a vehicle for
private gossip—we elect not to give.
Mr. Lilliput, on coming to a portion of his senses, gave a very
eloquent descrip'ion of the effects of the attack he had suffered. He
said when his throat was compressed, he felt as if his brain was turned
into Vauxball fire-works, accompanied with a strong odour of musk,
a scent, added the worthy gentleman, that was his abomination. He
had lost his watch, but as the watch had never kept time, the worthy
gentleman seemed in no way affected by the calamity.
The Hon. Mr. Lilliput, it may be needless to inform the reader,
is connected with the veiy highest members of the Aiistocracy. A
meeting of the family has been held, when it was resolved that, on the
meeting of Parliament, the law should be immediate] j altered, so that
every ticket-of-leave should instantly be withdrawn, and the offence of
the garrotte made punishable by certain death.
This being the case, we cannot but congratulate the country at large
on the assault committed upon the Hon. Mb. Lilliput : for as the
Hon. gentleman is nephew to a Duke, brother-in-law to a Marquess,
cousin to an Earl, a Duchess, and a Bishop, and further, is about to be
allied to the daughter of an ex chancellor, there can be no doubt that
at length, the crying, killing evil of the ticket-of-leave s>stem will be
put down with a strong hand. Of course, vulgar assaults we must,
from time to time, always expect; but when the Garotte enters the
bosom of a nobleman's family, it is high time for the laws to better
themselves.
Female Claimants for Boredom.
The French boast of an authoress of the name of Madame Bawb,
and ber reputation is decidedly great. But then, what, is one Bawr in
the literature of a country? Why, amongst our female writers there
is no end to the Bores! and look at American literature! Can yon
possibly imagine a greater Bawr than Fanny Fern f
THE GREAT HAMMERSMITH RAILWAX".
A Bailwat project, of much greater importance than the Russian
affair, is now offered to the British public—and also, indeed, to the
French, if the Credit Mobilier will vouchsafe to patronise the specu-
lation. The Hammersmith Railway Company, recently established,
proposes to effect a series of internal communications not inferior, to
say the least, in importance, to the junction of the Baltic with the
Euxine, St. Petersburg with Moscow, and Warsaw with Konigsburg.
To connect the great emporium of Acton with that vast centre of com-
merce, Hammersmith, and this, through the populous regions of Fulham
Fields, over the bosom of the mighty Thanes, with Battersea, and to
place that hive of industry in relation with the grand agricultural and
manufacturing district of Wandsworth, is the object of this gigantic
enterprise. In addition, it will bring the opulent parish of Hammer-
smith into more intimate relation with the other vast and wealthy
suburb of Kensington, by means of a junction with the lucrative and
prosperous West London Bailway.
Application is to be made to Parliament early in the ensuing Session,
for the sanction of this enormous undertaking, to the accomplishment
of which a serious, but not perhaps insurmountable engineering
difficulty presents itself. "Bailway, No. L" from busy Acton to the
greatly frequented thoroughfare of Back Church Lane, will have to
cross the Great Western Road. A double gate crossing this leading
outlet to London would form an almost intolerable obstruction to the
multitude of omnibuses and other carriages, private and public, which
are constantly running upon it: hence the necessity for a very deep
and long cutting, or a tunnel of equal length, or a bridge, which would
perhaps prove a bore of equal magnitude with the tunnel.
The Hammersmith Bailway Company may be recommended to con-
sider whether it would not be advisable to modify their plans a little,
and lay down a line direct from Hammersmith to the Bauk; a policy
obviously suggested by the impossibility experienced by the wayfarer
of finding a place in any Hammersmith-bound Hammersmith 'bus
between the hours of 4 and 8 a.m. _ The purchase of important property
situated on the required line might offer some impediment to this
operation, but this no doubt might easily be got over by the Hammer-
smith capitalists.
Should Parliament, though perhaps it may not, approve of this
stupendous speculation, there will be notbing whatever to prevent it
from being carried out but the want of funds, which, considering the
splendidly paying condition of existing railways, we cannot doubt will
be speedily forthcoming. No further remarks can be necessary to
induce all persons anxious to invest their capital, or their savings, to
make immediate application for shares in the grand, comprehensive,
and colossal Hammersmith Bailway.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A CONSERVATIVE "COUP D'ETAT."
IE late visit of the Ccttnt
de Pbrsigny, ambassador
for France to England, made
to the palatial hallof Knows-
ley, seat of the Earl op
Derby, tbe head of the
Conservative party, cannot
have escaped the political
mind of the country. •
A late visit paid by the
Right Hon. Benjamin
Disraeli to Paris, with an
interview—for obvious rea-
sons unnoticed in the Moni-
teur — granted by the
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH
to ihe member for Bucks,
was a subject of corre-
sponding impoit to be duly
considered by every reflect-
c ing Englishman-;
—_r" Grave, however, as were
"i""^,t-—- < hese events in their aspect,
^— we are convinced that the
country will find itself
totally unprepared for the tremendous disclosure it is our solemn duty,
as it is our happy privilege, to make. _ The visit to Knowsley, the inter-
view at the Tuileries, had but one dire purpose.
Parliament is commanded by the Queen in her own Gazette to meet
for tbe despatoh of urgent business on the third of February. We
entreat the reader to mark the date. For the second of February,
then—the date of the second was, unquestionably, the inspiration of
the imperial mind—for the second, we say, a coup d'e'iat was planned—
organised, moreover, in its minutest details—that, if successful, would,
doubtltss, have been hailed as one of those master-strokes of political
genius that, though fall as a thunder-cloud with elemental mischief
to a few, say, a few thousands, would, nevertheless, have been eulogised
and sung as the sublimest act of patriotism that ever saved a doomed
and devoted country.^ As the matter at present stands, with all the
foulness of the conspiracy exposed by one devoted quill (to which, at
present, it is unnecessary further to allude), the heffled and unsuc-
cessful traitors will meet with their proper reward iu the contempt of
the universal British nation. But let us be calm. Let us endeavour to
master the indignation of the patriot by the stern aobriety of the historian.
A waiy, insidious article on The Declining Ifficiency of Parliament
appeared in the last Quarterly. The intelligent reader could not but
recognise in this article an attempt, too thinly disguised, to substitute
for the authority of the House of Commons—evoked and drawn as it is
from the very meanest as from the very highest of the people—the des-
potism of an irresponsible oligarchy. As Ma. Cob den would have
crumpled up Russia, all the bears included, in his hand; so was it
plain to the enlightened reader of the article in the Quarterly, that it
was the burning desire of the Conservative party to crumple up Magna
Charta, and to degrade to the merest bauble the royal prerogative.
Without, we trust, any unseemly boastfulness, we confess that we so
read that conspiracy in print; though at the same time, we are free to
confess that we were unprepared for anything like the amount of reck-
lessness to which it is plain, the despair of office will, in the stress and
very hunger of ambition, urge an unprincipled party.
We will now, with permission of the reader, proceed without further
comment with our simple but terrible narrative. We have no doubt of
attention: for we feel, as once the Conservatives felt, that we have the
ears of the country with us.
Mb. Disraeli returned to London full and gloomily radiant as a
Sibyl with inspiration fiom the Tuileries. It is known that a certain
mind is essentially fatalist. It is even so with the highest and the
lowest. One man has a " star," another a lucky sixpence. Hence the
date of tbe second of the next month was suggested and accepted as the
date of promise, and next to the third, the day of the opening of the
imperial parliament.
We regret to say, but we write history, that certain retainers of
Lord Palmerston had been tampered with; and it being made known
pthat the Premier always retired to rest no later than ten ou the eve of
the opening of Parliament, having previously taken a little white wine
posset and a rusk; it was resolved first to seize the noble Viscount in
his bed at a little before eleven. A balloon duly inflated, was to be
ready, with sworn aeronauts, in Gardens. The Premier, placed
with all despatch in the balloon, the ascent was to be immediately
made, and the descent, if possible, so ordered that his Lordship should
come down in some Prussian state, where the name of Palmerston
was, if possible, least beloved; — Russia being too distant to be
hoped for. To effect this with secresy and certainty, the valet of
his Lordship, on the solemn promise of the richest consulate in the gift
of the successful patriots, had engaged himself to drug the posset; in
a word, to hocuss the unconscious Minister.
With the head of the Ministry gone, and haply, still sleeping some-
where on the banks of the Rhine, the mere members were considered
to be easy of disposal. A padlock on a pantry, with the servants duly
corrupted, a Chubb's lock on a wine-cellar (it bad been arranged to
invite the wives, where necessary, on country visits) might secure for
the due season a Home Minister or a Foreign Secretary.
Further, the little theatre in Dean Street, formerly known as the
temple of Miss Kelly, was to be hired as a place of inscrutable
secresy; and certain Ministers and their Secretaries conveyed thither by
a body of trusty adherents, sworn for specified sums, to save their
country from the unabashed tyranny of a reckless and too jocose
Minister. Of course, boldness—great boldness—was to be adopted, as
vital to the success of these designs.
Means were then to be devised to convince Her Majesty that, at the
last moment, she had been deserted by a profligate Cabinet. Calculating
upon the natural indignation of a generous mind, the Earl of Dbbby
would remain, with his carriage ordered, quite prepared to be sent for.
The Kabl of Derby, it was concluded, would be commanded to
form a Cabinet; and not to be taken by surprise, be would immediately
draw the subjoined list from his breast-pocket (" nearest his heart ")
and submit it tchis consentirg Royal Mistress.
First Lord of the Treasury . . Earl op Derby,
Chancellor of the. Exchequer . . . Mr. Niwdeoate .
Lord President of the Council . . . Earl op Cardigan.
Lord Privy Seal Marquess op Grarbt (with a Peerage).
Foreign Secretary Right Hor. Bkxjamin Disraeli.
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . . . Mr. Spooker (with a Peerage).
Home Secretary Major Brrespord.
This, it will be observed, is an imperfect list; in its incompleteness
leaving many important places to be filled by a tried fidelity, as mani-
fested during a disastrous minority of the then triumphant Conservatives.
On the appointment of the Ministry a telegraphic despatch was to
make known tbe fact at the Tuileries, and to be answered by tbe
Emperor himself in terms of glowing congratulation of the energy and
sagacity of the highest personage in the realm.
The Parliament was to have opened on the appointed third of
February; the Prime Minister, with a few strokes of the pen, con-
signing to merited oblivion the speech cf his predecessor, at the time an
unrespected alien somewhere in Prussia.
In the speech from the Throne emphatic notice was to have been
given of the re-enactment of the Corn Laws, of the Protection of
English Shipping, of the reversal of the late Sir Robert Peel's Tariff,
and of the withdrawal of the Grant from Majnootb. But, of course,
these measures were to be expected on the triumphant return of the
Conservative party to the fulness of power.
Such is the programme of the Conseivative coup d' etat, arranged
for the second of February. That the plot should now be defeated, and,
further, that it should be emphatically denied by the baffled conspirators,
the British nation owes solely to the devotion and vigilance of their
friend ever,

And stickleback,
Within that glass I nourish.
Then there's the roach,
And there's the loach,
And there's the crawfish crawling,
And efts and newts,
Don't call them brutes,
O'er one another sprawling!

How I delight
Of Nature in the study!
The water here
Is, oh! so clear:
It would not do if muddy.
My Dicky sings,
And claps bis wings,
I know that what he wishes
Is to escape
His cage, and scrape
Acquaintance with the fishes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [December 13, 1856.
CONVERSIONS FROM ROME.

His Grace the Duke of Atholl has contradicted a report, circu-
lated by Roman Catholic journals, that Her Grace the Duchess op
Atholl has embraced that faiib. Her Grace remains an aristocratic
ornament of the Anglican Church.
It appears that our friends the Roman Catholics are in the habit of
inventing conversions, and of publishing their inventions. And we all
know that when once a falsehood is put into circulation, it passes from
hand to hand with great rapidity, and it is very difficult to seize the
false coin and nail it to the counter of truth. Even after that opera-
tion it gets about aga;n, and despite the hole through it, people will
still pass it. Sometimes they stop the hole up, and boldly utter the
false coin, and this we doubt not that many Catholic journals on the
Continent will do with the Atholl forgery, spreading it about ad
majoreni Ecclesiai gloriam, that a great Scotch Duchess, much about the
wardrobe of the Queen or England, has embraced the Pope. .
We are grieved to be driven to the necessity of combating, with the
same weapois, this unfair method of advancing religion. But if battle
: must be given, it must. We have so much private information as to the
theological views of distinguished individuals that we could throw the
whole ecclesiastical world into gieat dismay. Hitherto we have
restrained ourselves, but at certain times forbearance ceases to be a
duty. We shall therefore inflict a heavy blow and a great discourage-
ment upon the Roman Catholic Church. The priests have tried to
steal our Duchess. Wnat will they say when we deprive them of their
Duke? Let them peruse the following announcement:
"Conversion of the Duke of Norfolk.—This Illustrious nobleman, long re-
garded as one of the most obsequious servants of the Church of Rome, is about to give
a signal proof that 11 the blood of all the Howabds" can still be kindled at need. His
Grace, in imitation of his noble father, is about to abjure the errors of Rome. His
belief in the traditions of that Church wis first shaken by finding that a new black
fall-down cravat, of much richness, and to which bis Grace was peculiarly attached,
received damaging spots and stains from the holy water with which he was spriukltd
in his private Chapel. His mind thus awakened to the mischievous character of one
part of the Romish ceremonial, light gradually poured in, and a humble but very Par-
ticular Baptist preacher was the means of completing the good work. The Duke will
be immersed at the Baptist Chapel at Norwich, on Sunday next."
We have more revelations in store, and before the series is complete,
we imagine that a certain C-rd-n-1 will be sorry that he has permitted
his subordinates to try to filch away one of our Duchesses.
SECRETARY AND SURGERY EXTRAORDINARY.
A Rather curiou3 letter for an honorary secretary appeared the
other day iu the columns of a contemporary. Here is a sample of this
remarkable composition:—
"1 find another statement made to my prejudice before a Disheartned magistrate
which of course must he Digressing to his feelings. This, however, might have been
answered it he had Acted as impartial as is his Duty to do, and referred those who are
trying to thrust me Down to the proper court in this District, When live Minutes would
have ended the Dispute."
The author of the foregoing seems to have had, for object, (he vindi-
cation of h'mself from the imputation of having endeavourtd to bring
some case of unreal distreas into unnecessary notice. He says that he
has been " accused of jumpiog at the present case," whereas, in fact, he
had "tryed to avoid bringing it before the public." That the case, as
well as the reference to it, is a somewhat extraordinary one, will appear
from the concluding portion of his epistle:—
"1 then commenced to advocate ber cause, and with all the Bickerings of these Dogs
in the Manger, still hope she will not be driven to the Workhouse, her whole life has
been employed at her Needle, living in the same House for the last Six Years, in Saint
Pancras Parish, carrying on the Business of a Dress Maker, until she became a patient
of the ophthalmic Hospital, and submitted to the most painful operation of having her
Eyes extracted, which haa proved a Failure.—I tun, sir, your obedient servant,
"Tht Distressed Needlemmen's Society, "C. F. ROPKB, Bon. Sec."
"76, Keuman Street"
It is not easy to conceive how an operation for the extraction of the
eyes should prove otherwise than a failure—if the object proposed was
the restoration of sight. One might wonder whether the Ophthalmic
Institution at which such an operation was attempted, with such a
view, was not situated iu Dublin, hat for the circumstance that the
Irish metropolises celebrated for.ophthalmic surgery.

A LAMENTABL E CASE OF OPPRESSION.
A Few days back, two gentlemen, friends of Leopold Redpath,
Esq., applied to the lolling Magistrate to know if he would not advise
them to bring actions at law against those thoughtless and ill-natured
persons who had taken upon themselves to stigmatise a charitable
individual like Mr. Redpath as a rogue.
The Magistrate said that he most certainly should, and doubted not
but that any jury would give damages sufficient at least to cover the
amount of the dispute in question between the Great Northern Railway
Company and their unfortunate ex-cashier.'
The gentlemen thanked the Magistrate, and said they should follow
his sapient advice.
The worthy Magistrate hoped Mr. Redpath was in all respects
comfortable P
The friends replied that the only things Mr. R. complained of was
the late delivery of the morning papers and the quality of the Sherry.
He alwavs preferred Amontilado.
The Magistrate assured them it should be rectified.
The two gentlemen, having lighted their cigars, left the court,
expressing loudly their opinions, as they got into their broughams, that
Mr. Redpath was an extremely ill-used man.
The Member for Southampton.
It now appears that Southampton is not to have the benefit of
James's powders; but it is believed will be represented by Mb.
Andrews, the public-spirited Mayor. As a patriotic coach-maker he
has every chance of heading his own poll.

SWINDLERS IN SWEDEN.
hat there exists no treaty
between this kingdom and
Sweden for the delivering up
to justice of absconding crim-
inals, is a fact of which those
of our readers who have been
lately robbed or swindled are
doubtless well aware, but of
which the Government, it
would seem, is either ignorant
or heedless. The alliterator
may indeed with truth re-
mark, that Sweden seems a
sanctuary now for scoundrels,
and in fact a regular refuge
for our runaway rogues and
rascals. We rarely now take
up the Times without a fashion-
able thief or two appearing
among the "fashionable ar-
rivals" there. Tlie profes-
sional rapscallion is extremely
(sensitive of temperature, and
as soon as he finds England
gets too hot to hold him, he
coolly at once takes a ticket
of French leave of us, and
becomea a gaol-bird of passage
for the North. When onoe
alighted on the Swedish ooast, be well knows his exi.-.teuce will
be a free and easy one, combining very,pleasantly the ease of retire-
ment with freedom from arrest. So he snaps his fingers in complaeenoe
at slow-footed Nemesis, impersonated to his mind by the heavy-
highlowed policeman, and with all serenity takes out his passport (in
another name) for Christiania.
We have ot course but little hope of ever inducing the Government
to lend a listening ear to reason upon this or any o'her matter. Never-
theless, as we observe by a recent paragraph that a couple of defaulting
tax-collectors have been lately traced to Sweden, we should almost
think the first five minutes of next session will not pass, without some-
body or other appearing on his legs to move for their return—we mean
of course by "their" not the member's, but the black-legs. Govern-
ment may have small respect for other people's privileges, but it is
generally jealous of its own: and although, when viewed in a com-
mercial light, the quick return of these absconding scoundrels might
be attended with small profits to those who have been done by them,
we think nevertheless our national honour is at stake, and demands
that inch scamps be not suffered to remain unpunished. For our.elves
at any rate, so long as we continue hearing that the rogues who
disappear from m keep turning up in safety upon Swedish soil, we
mean to do our utmost periodically—that is to Bay, in the power of a
periodical—to thm the crop as muoh as possible of these transplanted
Swedish turn-up i.

SHERIDAN ON HORSEBACK.
So great has been the success at Astley's of the combination of
Shakbpeare and horseflesh, that, we understand, it is intended very
shortly to place Shebidan in the saddle. We have not heard whether
Me. Murdoch is engaged to mount a piebald as Charles Surf ate, but
think that his light comedy could hardly be heavier if shoed. Mr.
Chippendale's Sir Peter Teazle would go very steadily on a cob, and
Miss Talbot's Mrs. Candour on a sober grey pony take any leap clean
over the irony of her author. As there can be no doubt that the idea
of producing Sheridan on horseback has resulted from the miraculous
success, under the circumstances, of the author at the Haymarket, we
think it would be only politic of the Astley's manager to mount the
comedy with the Haymarket actors. The recent success of Macbeth in
the saddle has been prodigious. NothiDg can be finer, more novel, too,
than the appearance of Lady Macbeth in the sleeping scene on a
Shetland pony. The quietude, the docility of the animal, shews that it
perfectly enters into the feelings of the rider, and thereby evinces, for
a pony, the most extraordinary sympathy with the profundities of
Shakspeare. This astonishing fact may, however, be in some degree
accounted for from the circumstance of the animal having been a whole
season in a pantomime at the Princess's.

THE INCOME-TAX CATECHISM.
Q. Wht is the Income and Property-Tax so called f
A. Because it is a tax on the mere Income of some people, and on
the whole Property of others.
Q. Of whom is it a tax on the Income only?
-•/. It is a tax on the Income only, and on no more than the Income,
of those whose Income consists of rent, or of the interest of Property.
Q. Of whom is it a tax on the entire Property P
A. It is a tax on the entire Property of those whose Income consists
of earnings, and who have no other Property than their Income.
Q. So it is called an income-Tax when it is a tax on Income arising
from Property, and a Property-Tax when it is a tax on Income not
arising from Property?
A. Yes.
Q. If persons whose Income consists merely of earnings were taxed
in the same proportion as those whose Incomes consist of dividends or
of rents, how much Income-Tax would they have to pay?
A. At the. utmost, sixteen pence in the pound on the interest of
their yearly Incomes at 3 Der cent. For instance, a man earning £500
a-year would have to pay 20s.
Q. Would this be an equitable adjustment of the Income-Tax?
A. Not quite; because earnings are mostly precarious.
Q. How does the Income-Tax affect persons of precarious Income?
A. It deprives them of the money which they ought to save as a pro-
vision against a season of loss of employment, or against old age.
Q. Where do those people go who are incapacitated by the Income-
Tax from making a provision for loss of employment, or tor old age?
A. To the workhouse.
Severity of the Season.
A Ctnical old bachelor overhearing a small wag in his remark, the
other evening, that a lady in a waltz and a fashionable petticoat, was
only to be likened to a travelling circus, had the brutal effrontery to
add an observation that the resemblance alluded to was not alone in
point of magnitude, but was carried out still further by the aggravating
fact of there being in both cases a fool in the centre.

MOORE'S MELODIES.-(N.B. MORRIS'S NOT THOMAS'S.)
"Oh, wtrp /or the hour."
On, weep for the hour
"When to nab Mokris Moobe
The ruin ions of tyranny with dirty fingers
came:
Suoh a letter I 'II* indite,
That the story of that night
Shall trumpet through the universe Lose
Bloompield's shame!
They rushed into my room,
And my papers did presume
To damage and to lunimagr, and to carry oil
the same:
To the station driven away,
In durance vile I lay,
And that whole night to my rescue, you,
Blooitfuld, never came!
Unwashed that night I lay,
Till released at one next day,
When Police-Director HiscKELDty my papers
did restore;
But each foul finger-print
On my white paper's tint,
Showed where dirty bands had tampered with
the papers of M. Moobe.
Yea—incarcerate I lay,
Till one o'clock next day—
To Manteuffel, till eleven, false Lord, you never
There are British hands above,
That the Berlin puppets move,
But Moa&is Moons defies them, and defies you
all the same!

Though Waagen smile,
And vent his bile,
Upon my picture splendid—
Though Eastlakk, Knight,
With sneering spite,
Decla'e "it might be mended."
Where'er tbey pass
I '11 write each ass,"
In language unbeseeming—
And prove they mean,
To hang unseen,
A work of merit screaming—
Oh, the Rafhael!—
The great undoubted Raphael I—
Every thief
Shall come to gtief
Who dates to doubt my Raphael!
Says Worntjm—" See,

My lovely picture scorning—
Says Waagen, "No;
'Tis but so-so:
Mantbgna's school 'twas bom in."
And Eastlake weaves
His doubts—" perceives
The picture's doubtless clever"—
With Mundleb's friends
The grant he spends—
But buy my Raphael? Never!
Oh, my Raphael!
My great undoubted Raphael!
Every thief
Shall come to grief
Who dares to doubt my Raphael!
So firm and fond
The wicked bond
That holds these thieves together,
Though with my gall

They mind it not a feather!
This work of mine
Although so fine,
To buy, as I can't leadj'em,
By Jove I swear
I'll ma'-te them bear

Mb. Mobbis Moobe to Berlin is gone,
On Waageh's heels you'll find him;
His hard-nibbed pen he has girded on,
And his Raphael slung behind him.
"Arch-humbug!" said the painter marred,
"Though Pbince Albert's self obeys thee:
One pen at least, shall bit thee hard,
One critic fair appraise thee!"
Mobbis Moobe was nabbed: but policeman's
chain
Could not bring his proud soul under;
He walked into Bloomfield in a strain,
That made that aristocrat wonder!
And said, " No police shall hinder me
From exposing Waagen and knavery;
Ashamed of yourself you ought to be, .
You wretched minion of slavery!"
SPOONERISM EXTRAORDINARY.
hebe are certain persois
who delight to make them-
selves uncomfortable, and are
constantly endeavouring to
render other Deople so. For
example, at the late Agricul-
tural Meeting at Rugby tbe
disconsolate Mb. Spooner is
reported to have croaked—
"He represented a large manu-
facturing town when the delusion
and calamity of free-trade misled
his constituents. He was not mis-
led by them, and because he voted
conscientiously he lost bis seat. *
* * He was told that tbey were
in a flourishing condition. His
noble friend told them so, and
others not so well inclined to them
as he was, told tbem that they
ongbt to he content with their
position. But such persons forgot
to tell them that they flourished,
not in consequence, but in spite
of free-trade. {Cheers.) Just let
them reflect upon that, and not for-
get tbe sufferings which they ex-
perienced when free-trade was first
introduced. It was known that
men of great capital, and possess-
ing much energy, bad survived that
terrible period of depression. It
was known, too, that the country had survived it. But bow many agricultural capitalists,
how many agricultural labourers, bad succumbed to tbe distress, and how much misery
was caused to many respectable agricultural families before they could pride them-
selves upon the position they now enjoyed—a position which nothing but the most
surprising efforts of energy, talent, and capital had enabled them to attain. * * *
He assured them that he could go on at great length upon this subject did not other
topics demand bis attention."
We have small idea of ever doubting Mb. Spoonbb's ability to
"go on at great length" upon this or any other subject. But that
free-trade has been a "delusion and calamity" is an assertion which
not even were we threatened with an orator of 40-Spooner power
would we consent to leave uncontradicted. The delunion, if there be
one, is of Mb. Spooneb's holding: who affects not to believe his eyes

when he sees the farmers fat and flourishing, and bids them recollect
how narrowly they have escaped being starved and ruined, as indeed to
be consistent, and to verify their own predictions, they ought actually
to be.
Mb. Spooneb seems to us at the Rugby dinner-table to have supplied
the place of the death's ' head introduced at ancient banquets, his
presence serving as a check upon exuberance of jollity. We are, how-
ever, somewhat doubtful if his melancholy statements be supportable
by facts: and if Mb. Spooner would relieve us from the unpleasantness
of having to question their reliability, we would urge him next Session
to move for a Return of the "man/ agricultural capitalists" who he
avers to have "succumbed to the distress" of free-trade. Unwilling
to commit himself by too cheerful an expression, Me. Sfooxer yet
admits with most becoming naivete, that "it is known" that the
country has survived its trial; and what a consolation it must be to all
who have the nation's fame at heart, to reflect that with the country
there is surviving still a Spoon—eb!
THE HIPPODRAMA OF MACBETH AT ASTLEY'S.
In the following lines, delivered by soliloquising Macbeth .—-
"I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleapa itself
And falls on the other"
It has been proposed to substitute for " itself" "its sell:" its saddle.
This emendation might be advaulageously adopted in the version of
Shakspeabe's great tragedy now in course of representation at Astley's,
and then, a horse having been appropriately introduced into the
"Room in the Castle" wherein the Thane of Cawdor makes the speech
in question, Macbeth might, suiting the action to the word, illustrate
t he new reading by vaulting over the quadruped, and alighting on his
head, or some more eligible part of his person. A new point might
thus be made in the performance, and would, no doubt, be received
with the most hearty and enthusiastic applause.
No Shall Clothes.—The word petticoat is henceforth a misnomer,
as long as the article of apparel so called retains an amplitude to which
only the bitterest irony can ascribe tbe character of pettiness.

HIS EMINENCE ON THE PLATFORM.
Cabdinal Wiseman is reported by the Star to have delivered, on
the evening of Wednesday, last week, a lecture which seems to have
combined instruction with amusement. The eloquence and learning of
the Cardinal supplied the former, and the latter may have been in part
derived from the circumstance that his Eminence appeared clothed in
the robes of his office: which of course included red stockings.
The platform which the accomplished dignitary of the Roman Church
honoured on this occasion, was that of Myddleton Hall, Islington; the
subject which he selected for his discourse, was that of " Recollections
of the four last Popes," and the object of his remarks was, of course,
the laudation of those Pontiffs. There are days, we believe, whereon
Caidinals, in common with all other members of their persuasion,
abstain from butter. This was not one of them: and certainly his
Eminence did lay it on thick. Very possibly the subjects of that
process personally well merited its application, and are deserving of all
the kudos which the Cardinal assigns to them in his rich and flowery
style: in the meanwhile the French are obliged to occupy Rome.
Pops Pitts the Seventh, by Cabdinal Wiseman's account, was a
very fine old gentleman in a physical as well as a moial point of view -.—
"Notwithstanding the afflictions which Pius the Seventh" had to endure, not a
white or grey hair was to be seen on his venerable head when at the age of eighty."
Of course this is no proof of papal infallibility, unless we may suppose
that Pius the Seventh was in possession of an Infallible Hair Dye—
for which there is, however, no receipt, associated as an heirloom with
the chair of Peteb. Neither does it imply extraordinary sanctity, for
we know an instance wherein the same peculiarity distinguished a
copper-nosed clergyman of the Church of England, who was excessively
addicted to port wine.
The Seventh Pius also used on occasions to look intensely what he
called himself:—
"He might be seen In a state of almost ecstatic adoration In tbe papal procession at
St. Peter's. * * * He (Cabdinal Wiseman) bad never seen the beautiful and almost
ecstatic devotion exhibited by that Pontiff repeated since, beautiful as .was that
exhibited by those who had succeeded him."
Bat how could the devotion of the Pope, sincere as it may be sup-
posed to have been, have appeared beautiful to the beholders F Had he
not his face in his hat—as the Abchbishop of Canterbury would
have, if engaged in silent adoration P More reason for the hat in the
case of the Roman Pontiff, who, at the time named, was being carried
on men's shoulders, as in another reDort of the lecture the lec'urer
himself is stated to have observed. Under those circumstances, being
paraded like Out Fawkes, the Pope would naturally blush with shame
and modesty. Herce he would be peculiarly impelled to bury his
countenance in his tiara.
This same Pope appears also to have been either a punster, or a
prophet, or both :—
"Pius the Seventh, hearing from the present Pope (who was then an officer in tbe
Papal army,) tbat be was subject to epileptic fits, told him that if be would enter the
Cburcb, he would never relapse. The advice was taken, and never since had Pius
the Ninth been troubled by epileptic fits. {Applause.)"
Many a true word is spoken in joke. If Pius the Seventh was a
wag, he might merely have meant to tell his destined successor that,
having once entered the Chuicb, he would never relapse into heresy,
thus giving him a sly poke for some heretical tendency with which, as
well as with epilepsy, we may conjecture him to have been afflicted.
The "applause" of the audience looks as if they took the story for a
joke: are they in tbe habit of applauding miracles when such things
are related to them?
Mo-t people have their pets. Pius the Seventh was not exempt
from this weakness. His pet was a particular church, and
"Whilst Pins the Seventh was in his last illness, the terrible news spread through
Rome that St. Paul's church was on fire; but, as if providentially, tbe boly man
expired some days afterwards without having been disturbed by bearing tbe sad tidings
about his favourite church."
At such a time one would hardly have supposed that a Pope would
have thought or cared about any tenestrial edifice; but cf course a
Cardinal knows best about Popes.
The "ordinary dinner" of Pius the Eighth, "was salt cod," tbe
Cardinal tells us, and by the further statement that this uncommonly
cheap Pope lived at a rate altogether not exceeding I v. a-day, he leads
us to infer that the repast was unaccompanied by egg-sauce.
Of Gregory the Sixteenth Cardinal Wiseman says—
"Nothing could exceed his amiability. He had even the kindness to correct tha
proof sheets of his (Cabhinal Wisehax's) works."
Was that such a very great bore? No, no. We would not hear

violence. We must be allowed to consider this too modest insinuation,
together with one or two marvellous stories of Roman clairvoyance, not
reported by the Star, but given by another contemporary, as intended
by his Eminencs principally for the ear of that celebrated American
gentleman, Mr. Buncombe.

I will not ask thee to be mine,
Because I love thee far too well;
Ah! what I feel, who thus resign
All hope in life, no words can tell.
Only the dictate I obey
Of deep affection's strong excess,
When, dearest, in despair, I say
Earewell to thee and happiness.

To see berlimmed I could not bear,
Pinched with hard thrift's expression
Disfigured with the lines of care,

Have all those things surroundiBg thee
That light the eye and smooth the'
Thou wilt smile calmly at my fear
That want would e'er approach our doer;
I know it must to thee appear
A melancholy dream: no more.
Wilt thou not be with riches blest P
Is not my fortune ample too P
Must I not, therefore, be possessed,
To feel that dread, of devils blue r
Alas! my wealth, that should maintain,
My bride in glory and in joy,
Is built on a foundation vain,
Which soon a tempest will destroy.
Yes, yes, an interest high, I know
My capital at present bears;
But in a moment it may go:
It is invested all in shares.
The Company is doomed to fall,
Spreading around disaster dire,
I hear that the Directors all
Are rogues—the greatest rogue thy Sire!
Go—seek a happier, wiser mate,
Who had the wit to be content
With the returns of his estate,
And with Consols at Three per Cent!

THE BORE OF RED, WHITE, AND BLUE.
What ft nuisance, all patience destroying,
Is " Pop goes the Weasel" to hear!
'Tis a plague which is very annoying,
The infliction thereof is severe.
But of all infestations melodious,
Which our musical faculties rue,
The most stupid, and senseless, and odions.
Is the sing-song of " Red, White, and Blue."
All the wretches who go ahout grinding,
That drag on our feeling of time,
And prevent us our business from mindiog,
Should to justice be. brought for the crime.
They force us our coffee to mingle,
And oblige us our bloater to chew,
To the swing of that pestilent, jingle,
Whose burden is "Red, While, and BlueP
Servant-maids, who encourage the caitiffs,
May disaster and grief come upon,
And policemen who bid not tbe;e natives
Of Italy's climes to move on:
Whilst we on our elbows are leaning
Our aching heads all the day through,
As we yawn at the silly, unmeaning,
Dull cadence of "Red, White, and Blue."
"Our Lady" in a Cloak.
The Queen of Spain signalised her birth-day by pre-
senting tbe marvellous image of Moxtserrat with a cloak.
We hope it is not of the same material and the same cut
as tbe cloak ordinarily used by Her Majesty; for that can
hardly be said to cover a multitude of virtues.
EXASPERATING!
A MOST KILLING BAIT.
We have the misfortune to be on speaking terms just now
with a married Cockney gentleman, who in jocular allusion
to the matrimonial noose, often talks of his wife as his
Halter ego.
A STAR BOILING OVER.
We scarcely remember to have ever seen any respectable party in a
greater state of flabbergast ation than the writer of some observations
in Mb. Cobden's Russo-Manchesterian organ, the Morning Star, of
Thursday, December the fourth. We must really reproduce a portion
of his remarks, for they are a psychological curiosity. Perfectly to
appreciate their object, it should} be understood that the Star desires,
in the interest of its proprietary, to excite as much pro-Russian feeling
as possible; and that it seeks to attain this aim by representing the
Turks, on all occasions, as the most detestable creatures in the world.
So an excitable party is set to rave as follows. We abstain from taking
the liberty of injuring his grammar by bringing it into conformity witn
ordinaly rule:—
"Is it true that which Mr. Thackibat says about the mnrder of two princes In
Turkey, by the order of tbeir grandfather and uncle, the former being tbe late Sultan
of Turkey, and the latter the present Sultan? Righteous God 1 have we English
people been fighting for such bloody monsters?"
Having thus proclaimed his discovery on which side England has
been fighting during the war, and his dissatisfaction with our champion-
ship of Turkey, tbe writer proceeds to object to the Queen's having sent
the Order of the Garter to tbe Fadishab. He considers it most likely
that one morning, while Her Majesty was asking one of her nurses
what sort of a night Princess Alice had passed, the Sultan was
occupied in putting a baby to death. Indeed, from the tenor of his
observations, the writer in the Star seems to think that babycide is the
habitual occupation of the Monarch of Turkey.
In which unhappy condition we must leave the sick boiler for the
present; but we nope that the excitement be has gone through will
not be productive of much ultimate harm to him. It will hurt nobody
else, that is quite certain.
"What! a woman who is mother of a large family of children, each of whom, with-
out dujtbt, sbe lores as dearly as her own life, to address the terms ' dear and beloved'
to a nftmster, who. in all probability was ordering the murder of an infant at the very
moment she might have been expressing the most tender and maternal solicitude for
one of her own.'" -
The Queen being thus delicately accused of nuking friends with a
murderer, her penny censor concludes by describing himself to be in
two curious conditions at the same moment. It is for medical men to
consider how far the union of sickness and boiling is compatible with
the laws of nature. The gentleman must know beat what it is that
he feels:
"I will say no more. I sickes, and my blood bolls with Indignation.''
ST. TAFFY FOR LONDON AND THE LONDONERS.
There are certain ancient. Britons, living at "Llanfairmathafar-
neithaf, Uanfihangel-nant-brane, Cambusnethan, Longformacus, JAangris-
liolus, Tintieistle, Brynguran, Polperro, Egloskerry, Kizziemuir, Ticitchea,
Matccop, Chokey, Troon, Crook, Wix, Gad" and other places of like
melodious accent somewhere in Wales. Hitherto, in so far as we can
learn, none of these aborigines have ever been exhibited at the Egyptian
Hall. However, very recently they have done the best to expose
themselves. To which end. they have petitioned Parliament against
tbe opening of the British Museum and National Gallery on the Sunday.
For the British Museum, so opened, could not but have the direst
effect on the morals of Llanfairmathafarneithaf, and for ever destroy
the primitive purity of Llanfibangel-nant-brane i The Sunday League
has published a letter in answer to these wild folks; but as tbe epistle
is written in English, the said League might as well have engaged a
bearded billy-goat to preach a homily to a bed of leeks. It is said that
these earnestly pious people do not dwell in houses; but, like the
Troglodytes of old, burrow in the ground. Neither do they cultivate
the earth; but live entirely by the chace, taking for subsistence, with
pepper and mustard, the native Welsh rabbit.
Persecution of Cornet Ames.
It is said that all means are being taken so to annoy the meek and
patient Cornet Ames—whose forbearance under Lord Vane Tkm-
pbst's more than word of mouth, would have done honour to the

MARY ANN'S NOTIONS.
ear Mb. Punch, — "Yon
must kindly let. we interrupt
myself in what I was going
to say about men in general,
because I want to tell you
something about one man in
particular. Such a triumph!
Such fun!
"This Mr. Martingale
—CUBZON MARTINGALE is
his name, and his friends
call him Kersey _ (what
affectation that is m men
giving oie another little pet
names, like school-girls,1
when you know all the time
that they2 wouldn't walk
across I he street to help
their beloved friends) was a
great ally of my brother
Augustus. Gusst (yes, but
a sister's different3) uted to
believe in Kersey, and dress
like him, and adopt his
opinions, such as they were,
and retail them to Mamma
and me as if they were
Solomon's Proverbs. He
tried with Papa once or
twice, but was put down in Che most awful manner, and with a regular
House of Commons speech. 'Sentiments, Sir, unworthy alike of the
education which it has been your good fortune to reoeive, and of the
society amid which you are so advantageously placed.'4 But though
Gusst was silenced, he was not convinced, and about a month ago he
wa<« giving us Mr. Martingale's ideas about being married. I wish I
had written them down at the tim», but I think I can remember enough
to make you see what kind of a Young Englander Mr. Kersey is.
"'Kersey's governor wants him to be married,' said Augustus, as
if he were recounting tome grievous wrong to his friend. 'Now I know
the young lady old Mr. Martingale was thinking of, and she is a
very nice, sweet-tempered girl, not exactly pretty,' but very pleasing,
and really accomplished. She is a cousin of Kersey's, and they have
known one another from children.'
"' And quite time he should, my dear,' said Mamma. This was one
for Mr. Gussy,6 who is older than Mr. Martingale.
"' Well, he don't see it in that light,' said Gussy.
"'I do not know in what light Mr. Martingale sees marriage,'
persisted Mamma, 'but I think he is standing in his own light, in
objecting to it.' And my dear Mamma looked quite pleated with her-
self end her neat little speech, which even Mr. Augustus condtscended
to nod at, as not bad. If one of his fast companions had said it, he
would have roared, and gone about repeating it everywhere.7
"' It is Jane Lindley, of course,' 1 said.
"' I'bleeve so,' said Guss, 'but 1 didn't ask. The principle's the
same, whoever it is. Kersey respectfully declines. And very right
too.'
"'Very right to be respectful, my dear,' persisted Mamma, 'but
Miss Lindley is a very estimable young lady, and would make your
friend an excellent wife.'
"'But my friend don't want an excellent wife, Mamma,' said
Augustus.
'"Then he does not deseive one, dear.'
"' Upon my word,' said Gussy, dropping his arms helplessly as he
sat on the sofa, and as I could see peiiectlv well, imitating something
that Mr. Martingale had been saying ana doing, 'you seem to think
the grand object of a man's life is getting married. It will be a good
thing when that old-fashioned superstition is done away with.''
"Mamma did not answer, but she smiled rather indigently; and
Gussy did not quite like that, and returned to his friend's particular
case.
"'Now what should Kersey Martingale marry for, in the name of
common sense? We talked the matter over in his rooms this morning.
He told me all about it. 'What should I marry for?' said he. 'Why
am I to sacrifice all my liberty, and comfort P See here. The governor

houses in the country; get my hunting and shooting and all that, and
am bothered with no keeping up appearances. Here ate my three
rooms, and there's my reivant, and who wants anything more? I'm
hanged if I do. And the governor won't let me be contented and
happy.'
"' Stem and cruel parient,' laid I.'
"' 0, of course,' retorted Mb. Gussy, 'you are on the other side.
Never mind, it's natural in you. Well, I could say nothing in reply.'
he went on, 'except that it was for him to consider whether he badn t
best stand well with his governor, who had behaved well to him, and
all that, and that I supposed the old gentleman would do something
handsome, if his views were met.'
"' You gave a son good advice, my dear,* said Mamma.'though you
pretend to say that jou spoke heartlessly. I know you, dear.'
"Guss actually coloured, having no notion of being thought good
against his will.10 However, b» went on.
"'1 taid what I tell you. 'But,' laid Kersey, 'what does meeting
bis views mean? That I'm to give up my fieedom, which is_ the one
thing of all that I enjoy; that I am to take one house and live in it, »nd
receive proper people there, and go to their houses, whether I like 'em
or sot, and grow stnck np, and cut the pleasantest folks I know,
because they are not exactly society for steady persons, and escort my
wife about, and go nowhere unless she can go (fancy that!), and never
start off out of town any more, with no fuss and preparation, and
wander about as I please, and come back in a month, or two, or six,
and nobody to control me, or ask me to account for myself—'
"' Actually pathetic,' 1 said, laughing out; for I declare that
Gussy had got into quite a whining tone, as be was describing the
dreadful slavery with which his friend was threatened.' 'Isn't it
terrible, Mamma?'
"' A few months of married life would cure Mb. Martingale of
those wild ideas,' said Mamma.
"' That's what I told the fellah,' cried Gussy, 'and that made him
ever so much wilder. 'He wasn't going to be cured.of liking liberty,
and w hat right had anybody to cure him f'
"'Miss Lindley, of whose feelings in the matter nobody speaks, is
to be congratulated, I think,' said Mamma, 'on not being made the
victim of an experiment.'
"' 0, hang it,' said Mr. Augustus, 'it would be a precious good
match for her. Kersey would have a capital allowance now, and the
bulk of the Lincolnshire estates after bis father. And a very good-
looking fellah, too, and good-tempered, if nobody crosses him. Any
how, the ought to jump at it.'
"And the magnificnt Mr. Guss went off to smoke his Weed," and
to meditate upon bis friend's noble attachment to liberty.
"My dear Mr. Punch, Kirsey Martingale has gone and run away
with a girl who sings at concerts, (quite a proper person, I believe,
who earns a good deal of money,) and has married her, and his father
refuses to see him, and has cut down his allowance to one quarter of
what it was, and Mr. Cubzon will have to live in apartments in the
New Road, and attend his wife—yes, Wife, (spell it with a big letter,
it looks like digging it into him) to all her concerts, and hold her
shawl, and carry her music home, and catch him going into the country
without her leave. She has a will of her own, they tell me, as she ought
to have, being the head of the family and its support.

all during the Huguenots13 on Thursday. Isn't it capital*

The Keviled of the Record.
In a recent number of the Record appears a paragraph, headed
{"The New Attorney-General Unsound on the Sabbath
1 Question." Sir Richard Bethell is thus denounced to the puri-
tanical portion of society, for having, in a speech at Aylesbury, very
mildly professed himself in favour of innocent recreation for the people
on Sundays. Attorney-General Bethell is a man of too large
ideas for the Scribes (and Pharisees) of the Record: who prefer the
narrow views of Little Bethel.
VERY SUSPICIOUS.

SOME "ODOROUS" COMPARISONS.
Comparisons have always, since the
days of Mrs. Mataprop, been
proverbially "odorous," and
one or two of them jus*
now are so especially in bad
odour, that we think the Nui-
sance Act should be enforced
to (auction their removal.
We used to bear, for instance,
when the security of anything
was called in question, that
it was esteemed to be "as
safe as the baok;" but of
late so many bank ruptures,
or bank breakings have hap-
pened, that we think "as
unsafe as a bank" would be a
trner reading.
"As sure as a gun," is
another of our similes which
we have lived to see tho-
roughly exploded. Experience
indeed has lo'g since taught
us that with 99| of every 100
Cockney sportsmen a gun is
never to be looked upon as
making sure of anything —
except perhaps of missing.
The comparison therefore is a
positive absurdity, and should
be discbarged before next
shooting season.
Since the Ratcatcher's
Daughter has been introduced
at court—the court we mean
being rather in St. Giles's than St. James's—the phrase "as jolly as a'sand-boy " has been
also negatived, for the sand-boy, or man, in the ballad we allude to appears to have been any-
thing but. of a j illy temperament; and the way in which eventually he came to grief could
only in Mark Tapleifs eyes have merited that adjective.
Another, and in spirit not dissimilar comparison, is that which has alike grown almost
obsolete, "As merry as a grig." This expression now has quite a mediaeval smack about it,

• iricc none but middle-aged or still more ancient
people are ever heard to utter it. As we will
venture to lay any wsger, even the most des-
perate— (say, a new hat with a Bloo.oer, or a
pair of gloves with a mote civilised young lady;
neither of whom, of course, would ever dream of
paying us)—that not the most far-sighted indi-
vidual has ever seen a grig, or has the moat
remote conception wnat that creature, if it be a
creature, really is, we think it is high time to
pass an act for its abolishment, and for the sub-
stitution of a substantive of meaning. We would
therefore word the phrase," As merry as a prig;"
(he state of merriment referred to being that
which any well-coL ducted pickpocket is pretty
certain to experience, when, after one of the
many trials of this life, he has been so lucky as
to have obtained admittance into one of the
"pet" prisons.
DECEMBER SPRING.
The Baby Grenadier.
Thi Prince Imperial has received at the
hands of the Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard,
as Enfant de Troupe, his livret, woioh, we are
told, is given to every private soldier, and in
which are recorded the state of his services, his
commissions, and omissions. The first two
entries made on the Imperial baby's part by his
affectionate nurse run as follows:—" His Impe-
rial Highness stands cold water like a duck;
and after his morning bath shows all over him
the tricolor." Further: "His Imperial Highness
(his nurse regrets to be compelled to confess so
much) has been known, more than once, to turn
his back upon powder."
Such has been the unprecedented mildness of
the season during the past week, that many of
the Christmas-trees have actually come out in
bloom.
EfiMINE v. RABBITS.
Certain Norfolk labourers, with what they are pleased to call a right
of commonage, pursue and take rabbits; and are cited before a
Norfolk bench, whereon, among humbler brother Magistrates, sits the
awtul anatomy of Lobs Hastings. Toe right of commonage is not
allowed—that is all nonsense: if 1 hess things are permitted, if labourers
are to imagine that any common right can privilege them to kill rabbits,
they will full soon take to pheasants and hares. Lord Hastings, as
given to wear ermine, especially vindicated the cause of the rabbits, and
the offenders were sentenced in a fine of lis., or, the money not forth-
coming, a month's imprisonment with hard labour. If rabbits were not
protected, ermine would snffer next.
Now it happens that the editor of the Norfolk News is one'of those
coarse-minded, vulgar people, too otten found with quills in their hands,
who call a lord a lord, with no more reverence than they name a spade
a spade. And Lord Hastings, with a lively anticipation of this man's
independence, threatened to visit him with other chastisement than
that of words, should he make a newspaper case of the lordly Hastings
and the lowly rabbits. The editor, notbing daunted, discoursed after
his own fashion upon the matter; and was forthwith waited upon by
Lord Hastings, charged to the mouth with the missiles, "scoundrel,"
"coward," "villain," " blackguard," and moreover threatening to blow
out the brains of an individual who sought to stand between his lordship
and his lordly wrath. "Iu the end," thus concludes the News, "his
lordship was turned out."
When Mr. Punch learned these facts, he felt more than sorry for the
noble name of Hastings. Hastings, a name associated with elephants
caparisoned in scarlet and gold—Hastings to be mixed with rabbits,
at 6rf. a-head! Mr. Punch, however, was speedily relieved by the
following note, whichi with great pleasure, he lays before his world of
readers :—
"The Maequis of Hastings, grandson of the Governor-General of India, presents
his oompliments to Mr. Punch and, for tale own protection, being further a minor who
will not attain his majority until 1888, begs Mr. Punch will make it known that the
Mabquis of Hastings has no connection whatever with Babon Hastings of the
Rabbits, of Norfolk."
Mr. Punch very willingly complies with the request of the minor
Marquis op Hastikgs. Iu such a case of mistaken identity, it is of
the greatest consequence that we should only skin the right noble—we
mean, the right rabbit.
Once upon a time, a lamented manager of the Royal Victoria Theatre,
full of the triumph of a cheap purchase of stage-clothes, exhibited to
one of his actors, a great bargain, a Hichabd's robe. Only thirty
shillings," said the Manager, tenderly manipulating the adorning fur,
"oniy thirty shillings, and all real!" "What!" cried the actor,
"real ermine?" "Ho, no," answered the bargain-monger, "real
rabbit." In like manner, it would seem, that a Peer of the .realm may
in no way be ermine; but, at least, real rabbit.
A GEM FROM THE EMERALD ISLE.
The Mayo Constitution contains a paragraph which commences
thus :—
"Death of an Irish Giant.—One of the last of the mythical line of 1 Irish
Giants,' in the person of Shawn Nabontbee, died at Connemara on Friday last.'1
And thus, immediately, but not consecutively, proceeds:—
If owed his sobriquet to his unusual stature, being a man of extraordinary athletic
netry—namely, seven feet in height, and weighing over 20 Btone."
So that, according to our Hibernian contemporary, this last of a
mythical line of giants was a real man, of unusual stature, being seven
feet high. Shawn Nabontree was at once a reality and a myth. To
be or not to be could never have been a question with him, since he
appears to have solved that tremendous problem by being and not
being at the same time.

THE ANTI-PEACE AND COMFORT QUACKS.
A New term of reproach, an addition to the British vocabulary of
invective and dictionary of abuse, is hereby proposed. It is the word
"Anti." Almost every good thing that Englishmen in general enjoy is
denounced by a certain minority of English fools, who would, if they
could, deprive their neighbours of it, and who are banded together for
that purpose in an association of asses having " Anti" prefixed to their
name. For instance, there exists a confederacy of simpletons, calling
itself the "British Anti-Tobacco Society." It is a pity that the
British Solomon is not now in existence to preside over these imbecile
Britons. They also are publishing Counterblasts against the Nico-1
tian leaf; and, among these, a letter addressed by their Secretary!
to the Bishop of Manchester, entitled. Reasons for seeking Legis-
lative Prohibition of Juvenile Street Smoking. The Bishop of Man-
chester must feel highly nattered by the honour thus done him, just
as he might by a spt-cal dedication to himself of a treatise on the
Quadrature of the Circle, or on Perpetual Motion. Legislative
Prohibition- of Juvenile Street Smoking I The meanirg of this quack's
Latin is, laws to punish boys for smoking in the streets. How
would the ninny have them punished? Imprisoned ?—with or without
hard labour ?—whipped? What an awfully severe pedant must be the
Secretary of the British Anti-Tobacco Society!
Persuasion is better than force, and a person in a correspond-
ing degree wiser than the above-mentioned Secrefary, has written
"Smoke Not: a Prize Ussap"—the prize, we presume, having been
awarded by the Anti-Tobacco Society— showing why the young
should not smoke." This milder and more gen'le treatise is the work
of an individual of the softer sex—softer of heart that iB, certainly not
of head, than the severe Secretary. Perhaps, however, the lady in
question—a certain "Miss E. S. C."—does not consider that the
reasons why the young should not smoke really do prevent them, for
the most part, from smoking—the attempt to indulge in that practice,
in the majority of cases, making them sick and ill.
Without actually calling themselves " Anti," there are vast numbers
of bigoted, illiberal, officious, conceited, meddlesome, ill-natured people,
who are what that word means. There are Anti-Theatrical, Anti-
Dancing, and Anti-Amusement-of-all-kind noodles, who, not content
with hating plays, balls, and other amusements themselves, want to
enforce their small antipathies on the rest of us. To deny, to restrain,
to coerce, to control others, on frivolous pretences and in petty things,
is their mean life's love; and accordingly we propose the word " Anti"
for use as an opprobrious expression to denote, a hypocritical, paltry,
conceited, domineering, ostentatious fool.
What a world this would be, if all the Antis could have their own
way! The Anti-Fermeuted-Liquor and Anti-Animal-Food fanatics,
between them alone, would reduce us to vegetables and slops; one set
of Antis would deprive ns of this comfort, anol her of that: would cabin,
crib, and confine us and each other, tie all mankind hand and foot, and
render themselves and everybody else perfectly miserable. Henceforth,
let "Anti" be synonymous with enemy, plague, nuisance, pest of
society.

the country. There is ro man who can look so far into a goose's egg

The Hon. Member, in his patriotic fervour, forgets I hat Her Majesty
is the wife of an English field-marshal, and, if upon no other account,
may have military sympathies with the gallant comrades of her
husband, as Mr Kean says in Rolla, the brave companions of his
toils, and partners of his fame." But Mr. Willtams knows the
history of Oliver Cromwell, and knows how, once upon a time-the
tyrant by means of the military cleared the House of Commons. Who
knows? Prince Albert, on a momentous Fishmongers' dinner, de-
clared that" constitutional institutions were on their trial." Bayonets,

MEETING OF EUROPEAN MAGISTRATES.
At a special adjourned meeting of European Magistrates, held in the
Conference Room, Paris,
Alexander Romanoff, aged 38, was placed at the bar, charged with
forgery and attempted burglary.
The Magistrates decided to take each case separately.
Cowley, a detective officer, resident in Paris, proved that the prisoner
had recently been engaged in a dispute with some of his neighbours as
to a right of way, and the same being referred to arbitration, the
prisoner had contrived that false maps should be produced before the
arbitrators, and by this means had obtained an award entirely opposed
to the spirit of the agreement under which the reference had been made.
The prisoner said that he had nothing to do with I he forgery, but
that if people were fools enough to be led astray in that manner, he
saw no reason for not profiting by their folly.
The Magistrates made some severe and contemptuons remarks upon
the conduct of the arbitrators in question, who, knowing tbat they were
dealing with an avowedly dishonest person, ought to have been doubly
careful. The Bench, although morally convinced of the guilty know-
ledge and intention of the prisoner, did not think that tue evidence
would warrant a conviction.
In the second case,
Ltons, a valuable officer, whose duties are chiefly on board ship,
proved that the prisoner had upon several occasions tried to break into
premises called Serpent's Isle, the possession of which had been taken
from him by sentence of law, but which he was very eager to get hold
of again. He, the officer, had received information on the subject, and
in consequence had taken precautions which had enabled him to baffle
the repeated attempts of the prisoner; but he had reason to think they
would be renewed.
The pritouer said that he had been entirely misunderstood. He had
noticed, with regret, that the gas-lamp on the premises in question was
out.of repair; and he had gone, in the kindest manner, knowing some-
thing of brass-work [a laugh), to put it right. He complained of ill-usage
by toe officer, who had incited tome sailors to kick him out of doors.
The Magistrates asked whether there were any evidence to character?
Clarendon, Policeman, said that there was not much known'against
the prisoner, except that he was an associate and friend of several
foreign thieves. His father had been a notoriously bad character, but
it bad been hoped that the son would have taken warning. He could
not plead distress, because to his, the officer's knowledge, the prisoner
had a crown given him only the other day.
Buol, detective in the Austrian service, said that the prisoner was a
most dangerous neighbour, and was always blocking up a water-course,
harbouring rogues, or poaching, and these had been the habits of his
family for many years.
Persigny, a French detective, said tbat the prisoner had been trying
to become intimate with a distinguished family in Paris, evidently with
ulterior designs. He had also endeavoured to bring about a quarrel
between neighbours, but had been defeated by the good sense on
both sides.
The Magistrates, after a brief Conference, taid that they had hoped
they were to hear no more of the prisoner, who had, as appeared on
record, been severely punished in the preceding year. They had given
consideration to all the circumstances, and had aecided that he should
have one more chance of becoming an honest man. They should not
convict him in the forgery case, but he must give up possession of the
property thereby acquired, and be must be bound over to keep the
peace in the second case. They hoped that this extreme leniency
would have its effect, but they warned him that should be appear
again at tbis bar, their course would be one of unmitigated severity.
The prisoner professed his thankfulness, and was led out, singing a
Russian hymn.
A Matrimonial Alliance. 1
Fashionable folks have ceased to many. Now, according to
Jenkins and his imitators, "tbey form a matrimonial alliance:" upon
which, Susan Jane writes to Punch to inquire, " if such an alliance is
to be considered offensive and defensive P" Mr. Punch ventures to
reply—"offensive, when misfortune or difficulty is to be attacked and
overcome; defensive, when sorrow or sickness assails; and expensive,
when certain little parties, whether or not, will join in the compact."

JUVENILE OFFENDEKS IN THE PABKS.
The following notice appears, or did within a few days past appear,
on the gates of Richmond Park:—
NOTICE.
THAT
AMBROSE CLIFFOED
or TW10K11BHHAM,
Having been detected cutting letters on a. seat In this Park
on Monday the 3rd Instant, was taken before the Magistrates
at Richmond and fined for the c
Richmond Park, 8th Xovembtr, 1856.
Of coarse the laudable intention of the.foregoing placard is to exhibit
Masteb Ambrose Clifford—whom we take for granted to be a
young gentleman, or at least a youth—in the light of a terrible example,
it does not, perhaps, quite accomplish its purpose. The amount of the
flue imposed on Master Clifford is not stated, on the one hand,
whilst, on the other, a certain prominence is given to his name: a pro-
minence which, to a mischievous boy, would be a source not of any
shame whatever, but of high delight. Could the notice have stated
that Master Ambrose Clifford had been whipped for the offence
committed by him, the publication of that circumstance would perhaps
have operated as a salutary warning to hig juvenile compeer;, and
would, at the same time, not probably have been looked upon by the
culprit as a piece of very great fun.
DUTY AND AFFECTION AFLOAT.
Sir Charlis Napier writes to the Duke Constantine to know if
when his "highness honoured him with an interview," whether it was
the Duke's opinion, as stated by Sir Robert Peel, if he had attacked
Cronstadr, it would have crumbled into dust.
The Dure Constantine "willingly affirms that Sir Charles exactly
reported the conversation he had with Sir Charles concerning
Cronstadt."
Sir Charles appeals to the Duke as desirous that his highness
should testify that the admiral bad not failed of "doing his duty."
The Duke replies, "Yours, affectionately."
We take it ttiat the duty ana the affection in this matter are exactly
worthy of one aaother.
We have made a long search in the endeavour to find any parallel
Sassage to this correspondence of Napier in the letters of Nelson;
ut confess that we have not succeeded. Nevertheless, we have
stumbled on a few expressions of Old Trafalgar which we recommend
to the consideration of the once Admiral of the Baltic, so "affection-
ately" prized by his late enemies.
There was no doubt danger to the English fleet grinning from the
walls of Cronstadt; for did not Duke Constantine assure Admiral
Napier that his ships would have been sunk under the thousand guns
threatening from the bastions P
There was a certaiu Admiral Brueys, who commanded a certain
French flotilla made famous at the Nile; who wrote home to Paris that
Nelson had purposely missed him, '" because, not being superior in
force, they did not think it prudent to try their strength with him."
Now, it happened, that at length Admiral Brueys and Admiral
Nelson hove in sight of one another; and, all superior as was the
force of the French, the impetuous, imprudent Horatio, rapturously
described how he would "double" on the enemy's ships. Captain
Berrys," says Nelson's biographer, "when he comprehended the
scope of the design, exclaimed with transport, 'If we succeed, what
will the world say!' 'There is no if in the case,' replied the Admiral;
'that we shall succeed is certain: who may live to tell the story is a
very different question.'"
At this time Nelson had possession of both his eyes; and had a
Nelson been before Cronstadr, he would, we have no doubt, have seen
all the gun;, but never an IP upon a gun-carriage. In this way Nelson
did his "duty" at the Nile; though, unlike Duke Constantike, the
brave Brueys' of the Orient was not spared that he might "affec-
tionately" testify to it.
ZONG OF THE ZOUTHAHPTON ELECTOK.
Zo James is <
F!—good bye to un-
1 hope as how that Mr. J a
let James depart in peace;
« uv^v ^uv. nil vind another pleace,
And now theie's Wigglein, that's one, Sir Eddard Butler two,
And Beste comes forrads for a third: and none on 'em wuu't do.
A good man Guv'nor Wigglbin 'tia like enough med be,
Or med be not, I only knows I doant know nought o' he.
Sir Eddard's a Consatvative, in whom I puts no trust;
And as to Bests, of all the dree I thinks his chance the wust.
In this here strange perplexutty, wi' scarce a pin to choose,
The 'lectors very natural to Richard Andrews gooes,
They gooes to Mr. Andrews, and axes un to stand,
And I hopes that Richard Andrews nil conzent to their demand.
Consider'n for the fifth time that he's now Zouthampton's mayor,
I thinks he's qualified to zit in any sart o' chair;
And if a sate in Parliament he've got a mind to fill,
I'll gie to un my interest, my vote, and my good will.
But what says Mr. Andrews, when they makes un this request,
To stand agin Sir Eddard, Guv'nor Wigglein, and Besie P
He says, " Come now, a thousand on 'ee just put down your
And then I'll be a candidate in pleace o' Mr. James."
Now that's what I calls razon, and let me tell 'ee why:
It benders envious people from raisun' of a cry,
Accusunun of vannedy, ambition, and that 'ere,
"Which now is what they can't purtend to zay agin the Mayor.
He ain1, no lawyer, anyhow, to use 'ee vor his ends,
Although be knows what's law as well as many larned friends;
He knows the laws wants mendun, too, as well as you and I,
And that's zome work as he'll git done—or know the razon why.
We wants a man o' business to represent our town;
What call have Mr. Wigglein vrom London to come down P
When here we've got a man at hand our purpus who will suit,
And zee to what you calls our local interests to boot.
A business chap's a chap that has a head for business shown,
I'll trust he '11 mind my business as knows how to mind his own.
To represent Zouthampton a stranger why invite P
1 'd rather ha a neighbour mun: I ood a precious sight.
I '11 therefore zign for Andrews, and I hope you '11 do the zame,
And, if so be as how there's one as can't put down his name,
For tisn't every chap as is a scollard and a dark,
Let un express his zentiments by signun of His Mark.
GAMMON OF BACON.
A Certain Mr. Smith has been giving himself a great deal of trouble
to prove that Lord Bacon wrote Shakspeare. It would be interesting
to know whether Mr. Smith is acquainted with Mr. Urquhart, and
in the habit of associating with him. The latter gentleman is possessed
with a fixed idea concerning Lord Palmerston; the former with an
idea of the same speciea touching Lord Bacon. There may be such a
thing as mental contagion; peculiar states of mind may be commu-
nicable, with a difference as to symptoms.
We shall not be surprised if Mr. Smith should by-and-by proceed
to aim at convincing those who may be disposed to attend to him, that
Lord Eldon wrote Childe Harold; that Cobbett was the author of
Peter Sell, and the other poems erroneously called Wordsworth's;
and that Sir Frederick Thesiger has really composed the poetry for
which credit is given to Mr. Tennyson.
Auricular Confession.
{Advice to the Bishop of

Punch tells you, my Loid Bishop, whether you think so or no,
It's no use your trying at Brighton Auriculas to grow:
For that Plant, and others like it, were tried here long i
But the soil proved too stubborn and the 1
Imperial Tipple.—We may not precisely declare the sort of enter-
tainment promised to the Emperor of Austria on his visit to Venice
and Lombardy; but hitherto he has certainly taken nothing but—
"cold without."
TO BE SOLD CHEAP.—A FIRST-BATE GAROTTE WALK, in a

neighbourhood of several rich Squares that dine late. The present proprietor will part
with the Walk at a very low figure, and throw in an adjacent Park as well, for the
simple reason that he is about, in connection with two or three Members of Parliament,
to try his hand as a Bank Director. The receipts have, for the last three months,

"SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF."
(Being some Hints on Prison Discipline, addressed to Mr. Punch ly an old
Tictet-qf-Leaver.)
'Onbbed Sra/So 'Prigs wont
work,' wont they ?—Well,
that's wun of tbe reson*
agin tryin to make em
wurk, on wich I 'ye too
or three remarks to hoffer.
In my time, all I knows
is, we didn't are ne'er a
chance to work, unless it
was on the mill or the
crank, or okum. Aid in
corse unless it was along
o' stop pin a fellers wittles,
or the black-ole or noggin
or such like. I'd like to
no who wood wurk at a
crank, a grindin nuffin, or
a mill a-turnin nuffin but
a cove's ed, or at okum-
tesin, that a liable boddied
tradesman cant make no
better afist on than a born
iddiut1 In coarse, wu'k
o'that kind wont do m&n
but aggrawate a feller and
make him savage agin
bekes and guvnors and
turnkeys and judges and
lors and tbe hole kit on
'em. Bvsides,ifyoumakes
no diffrence atwixt wun
man and annther, but
sets em all to turn the
same crank, or to foot tbe same mill, or to ravel at the same everlastin okum ook,
and tarves em all out the same wittles, and locks em all up at the same hours,
wot's the call for a cove to wurk more nor he can elp?
"But if a chap knqwed as he was expeckted to am his grub, and'warn't to ave
his grub till he arned it, and then might am better or wus grub accordin to his
wurk, and was to be kept in qwod till he larnt how to am his grub, aye and pade
up the arreres for his kepe wile he was a lamin, and made up the walley o wot he
'ad been and prigged bysides, he'd preshus soon wurk lie be bownd. And if he
fownd that by over-wurk he cood get hisself any littol cumfurts, such as his bit o'
backy or a sbave o butter to is bred, or a hextra cut o mete or sicb there 'ud be
a motive to wurk as I never see put on to a chap in qwod yit, and till you've
tride that there sort of thing on dont tell me prigs wont wurk.
"But then, you'll say, well, but if a chap's a good wurkman and you gives him
wurk in qwod, he'd soon am his kepe, and his cumfurts too, and wen he'd dun he'd
wauk his chauks, and go on priggin agin as bad as hever. Bight agin—if you
lets him go, wen is time's up, and takes no more count on him. But spose
insted o' givin a chap his forteen days or three munths, or two yere, or such like,
you was to qwod the yung uns till they 'd lamed a trade as they could live by, and
the old uns, who never was tort no trade but priggin, till thade satisfide the visitin
justisses as they could am an onest liveljhood, and all on em, old or yung, trades-
men or no tradesmen, till they'd pade there expenses in qwod and the walley o
their priggins besides. And spose wen a chap ad dun this, you sez to him, 'Mow
my man, you can go owt to git work, and if you can git it owtside the iug, you 're
welkum; but you'll cum back and report yourself at the jng hevry blessed nite,
that we may no where we has you till we tells you not to come any longer—and if
you cant git wurk hout side we'll find you wurk iiinside—but houtside or bine ide
wurk you must.' I think you'd ave a hold on em you cant ave now, and stop
their mouths too agin say in they couldn't git wurk and so they was forced to take
to priggin agin.
Well, but you '11 ask, on are yon to find wurk for em in qwod? Well I dunnow
why you shouldn't qwod a chap accordin to his trade—them as 'ad any—and ave
prisons for prig tsyiers and prig shoomakers, and prig carpenters and printers and
semstresses and such like, and do all the guvment wurk at tailerin and shoomakin
and carpenterin and print in and so win, all in their own jags, as peeple boys their
beer at the taps—and why you shouldn't^ave prig farms too, for the laburers as
couldn't do any think but spade-work, and use up the prodoose of them farms in
feedin the other prigs. Besides look at Portland—that's the only jog ov em all as
pays its way now, and y P acos you keeps the fellers there a wurkin at the brake-
water wich its useful wurk and wot you d ave to pay stonemasons and navvies for
if the conwics didn't do it. Well and isn't there a dele of such works wants doin
helsewhere besides Portland P—aint there arbours o refuge to be made, and aint
there the Med way wants embankin, and aint there London as wants sooerin. and
couldn't you ave a few of them drab men o war thats lyin eatin their hold eels off
at Sheemess and Portsmouth and Plymouth, and keoe em in the river or hoff the
coast to lodge the prigs in, while they was at such wurk as embankin arbor makin
or sooeiin?
"To be sure, all this wood 'nt be 'arf as hesy as sttippin'
yonr prigs off in cartlodes to Horstralia. or sich like, or
set'in on 'em to turn a crank or work a mill, or tese hokum.
It 'ud want good horsifeis and trades masters, and give
Kibkzl Jem and the bigwigs up in London a dele o'
trouble, I dare say. But if it wud make prigs kepe them-
selves, and teche 'em they couldn't git away from wurk.
then, I say, it'ud be worth tiyin*. But, sez you, 'it'ud
do away wi*h your seperate and silent sistems.' Well,

Well, of all the stuff ever forked, that 'ere tork about

HOME TRUTHS.
By a Homespeating Philosopher.
As sure as there happens to be cold meat, or a poor shabby
dinner of scraps and make-ups, so sure is the husband to
take some one home to dinner with him.
No child ever makes a noise: and as for babies, it is a
well-known fact, that every blessed baby that ever was
born was the " quietest little thing in the world."
It is rare indeed that you can get two mothers-in-law to
agree upon any domestic matter, more especially upon any
treatment connected with the rearing of children.
One thing is indisputable:—servants take care generally
to answer tbe mother-in-law's bell the first time it is rung.
The kitchen-chimney only catches fire on festive occasions,
and no cook ever thinks of having a nervous fit, such as
necessitates her being carried upstairs to bed in a state of
insensibility, but on some grand solemnity, when you have
distinguished company to dinner.
As the mother grows older, so the daughters grow
younger; for if the mother is only thirty-two, it would be
absurd and contradictory to give out that her grown-up
daughters were more than fifteen or eighteen at the utmost.
From the want of this simple management, ridiculous
cases hare been known, in which the mother, by deducting
1, or more, off her age every year, and neglecting to make
tbe same deduction with her youthful beauties, has at
length arrived to be of the same age as her daughters.

Advice to the Faib Sex.—A Lady has no occasion,
when she has a new bonnet, to buy any bonnet-trimmings
for it, for she has only to take it to church the first Sunday,
and her friends are sure to trim it well for her.

SEASONABLE BENEVOLENCE.

HE many very seasonable
acts of benevolence which
have lately come within our
notice, induce us to give a
valuable inch or two towards
ensuring publicity to bo me of
the most striking of them:
Sib CnARLES Napier had
been sprawling over Bome
few dozen sheets of paper in
attempting to explain, for the ninety-second time, how it was that he
came away without attacking Cronstadt, when in a he of very seasonable
benevolence he dropped the letter in the fire instead of the Times'
letter-box.
The bellicose Load Lucas had commanded his solicitor to bring
actions against pretty nearly every newspaper in England, for its
libellous criticism of nis military character; but, in the purest bene-
volence to himself, he wisely thought better of it, and withdrew his
instructions.
One of the richest of the Bishops bas been recently moved to the
unparalleled self-sacrifice of going without claret for nearly a whole
week, in order to had funds for the relief of his poor Curates.
The King op Naples recently has had the benevolence to cause one
of his three thousand political; prisoners to be Bet at liberty (the
Surgeons having certified that his dungeon fever would prove mortal
within four-ani-twenty hours).
No less than two of our most succes:ful playwrights have been
actuated lately by such seasonable benevolence, as to have abstained
for almost an entire fortnight from writing their "original" pieces
from the French.
Mb, SrooNER had prepared a thrilling speech upon the Maynooth
question, which he m ended to rehearse tor delivery next Session';
when, in a fit of quite ungovernable benevolencs to the House, he was
induced to commit it to his waste-basket rather than his memory.
And, lastly, Louis Napoleon has had the benevolence to state,
that there is at present no foundation for the rumour, that he has
succeeded in persuading the British Government of the imperial
necessity that exists for silencing the British press.
THE IMMORTAL WILLIAMS.
We don't mean Shakspeare—we don't mean the Hero of Kars—we
mean the Williams — W. Williams—Lambeth Williams —Wal-
wor'h Williams—the Cato of the New Cut—the Andrew Marvel
of the 'Marsh'—ithe Atlas who, when stout Joseph Hume gave in,
took upon his shoulders the burden of Pennywisdom and Poundfoolish-
ness in the British House of Commons. Let Britain be merry—even
under double Income-Tsx, a House of Lords, a rural police, a camp at
Aldershott, a National Gallery in posse at Kensington Gore, and a
Prussian husband in futuro for the Princess Royal—she has still a
Williams to strike terror into aristocrats, and to bear aloft the sacred
banuer of Bumbledom, in the battle of the Constitution.
What a comfort to the country that the light of Lambeth'should
shiae amidst the general darkness which broods over the benighted
House of Commons—a guiding star for Palmebston—a beacon to
keep up the sinking spirits of the immortal three — the Fuest,
Stauwackeb, and Tell of the Transpontine Fastnesses—the Cubiatii
of the Cut—the three Tailors of Tooley Street!
Williams is always great, but Williams at Walworth, on Wednes-
day week, was sublime. It must be owned that the Metropolitan
boroughs, as a rule, honour themselves, and set a noble example to the
country, by their choice of representatives. But Lambeth need not
envy Finsbury the high political principle, and the solid social virtues,
of its Doncombe—nor Southwark the lucid and rerene eloquence of
its Pellatt—or the Nelsonian heroism and measured discretion of its
Napieb, In Williams it has a member as broad in his Radicalism as
Duncombe, as eloquent as Pellatt, and as discreet as Napieb.
Let who will slumber at their posts, Williams has his eye open.
Britain shall not be crushed under a rural police—a standing army—
a bloated aristocracy, and a hungry bureaucracy—unless her murderers
pass, first, over the body of Williams! The Church had better get
all its new brooms ready—the Horse Guards will do well to'muster its
men for 'Augean stable duty'—the House of Lords would be wise to
underpin its rickety buttresses—for Williams is upon them!
Talk of William the Conquebob! talk of William the Dutchman!
give us Williams !—Williams of Walworth—the immortal Williams
—the guardian of the popular purse—the Draco of the estimates—
our protector against a too-vigilant police—our preserver from a too-
efficient army—the scourge of a bloated aristocracy—and the "Bpoke,
spoke, spoke," in the wheel of centralisation!
CRITICISM OF EXCLUSIVE GENTS.
The eyes of young De Couecy were wandering over the advertise-
ment page of a morning journal, when, suddenly addressing Belmont,
who, reclined upon a rich and magnificent velvet sofa, was smoking a
fragrant Ilavannah, he read as follows:—
"Bbkzikb Collas cleans gloves, silks, ribands, satins, velvets, cloths, carpets,
leather, Ac., without leaving the slightest odour."
"Ah don't understand that," continued the high-born young geu-
tl- man, "Collas cleans gloves! How can a Colla' clean a glove?
"Don't know'm sh'ah!" responded his aristocratic companion.
"Besides," pursued De CouBcr, " 'Collas cleans' is not gwamma.
"Collas' is pwuwal, and ' Cleans' is singulah."
"Yas," answered Belmoht; "so ah should imagine. But don't go
into gwammatical pwinciples, because the subject is too abstwoose."
In a tone of candid assent to thii sell-evident proposition, the other
gallant youtb, as he turned to the "Sporting Intelligence," half-
musingly exclaimed, "To be suah!"
"WE HARDWARE MEN.'
Polar Expeditions.
Lord Palmebston has always on going to the Poll
Felt sure of his return;—the Fates bless his cheery soul—
But we hope that won't dispose him to risk less-gifted souls
In a work so clearly hopeless as going to the Poles.
A Great Comfort.
Ms. Muntz, expelled from Printing-House Square, has found
sympathising comfort in Shoe Lane. The Times refuses to insert
Muntz; and Mrs. Gamp straightway opens her sheets to him. Mr.
Mun-jz writes, "the enclosed letter to the Times, having been kept
nine days, is refused insertion." What,a shame, that, even after nine
days, an epistle b' Muntz is not to see,the light! Why, a better
mercy is vouchsafed to puppies. But then, has not Mr. Muntz to
blame Mr- Muntz for such refusal, seeing that to the Times he writes
as follows P
"We hardwaremen remain much as we were five years ago ; we are too much used
to firt,itoiie, and tmoke, to beed either the thunder or the froth of the Times; and we
can well afford to laugh at the self-importance of somewho sit In a garret and write »«."
The hit at, the "garret" is worthy of a Brummagem
by other men's heads and hands, has made his gold out of
editor of the Times, however,—
"Begs to decline further controversy with an opponent who thinks It necessary to |
eke out his arguments with such a sneer as that in the last paragraph of the enclosed
letter."
Whereupon, Ma, Muntz sends his letter to Mrs. Gamp, who does:
not sit in a garret; but, as it is well known, inhabits a marble palace,
paneled witb cedar, and hung with gold and purple in Shoe Lane,
and writes me.

[December 20, 1856.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A SKETCH DURING THE RECENT GALE.
FIVE MINUTES AT THE CATTLE SHOW.
This year's Cattle Show was attended by an immense conflux of
people, which was swelled by us, anxious to assist at an exhibition at
once ludicrous and laudable. Crossing from one side of Baker Street,
to the other, we encountered great peril from the rapid succession of
omnibuses, which disgorged their crowded contents at the centre of
attraction.
Amid a shouting multitude, we elbowed our way in front of a file of
bill-distributors, who occupied the curb stone, presenting their several
puffs to all comers. We accepted a series of these, which did not, as
we anticipated that they would, prove very violent experiments on the
credulity of the agricultural mind. We were agreeably disappointed at
not finding among them a single quack advertisement. One of them
oifered those whom it might concern the assistai re of an "artificial
mother;" an invention which we, too hastily perhaps concluded to
have been meant for a calf.
Mr. Stbatton's fat ox spoiled us for the rest of the horned cattle-
Such was its corpulence, it panted in such a manner, that it rendered
the remainder of the bovine exhibition an anti-climax. The sheep
might have excited the sympathies of the butcher or the wool-stapler,
but they caused us no emotion. But we were highly delighted with
the pigs. The lines of beauty formed by their convolutions of fat over
the head and face, struck us as exceedingly picturesque; their attitudes
were most absurd; and their resentful cries were replete with comical
expression. We heard one of these animals screaming as if in the
direst agony. Its sufferings turned out to be occasioned by a young
lady, who was patting it with mistaken tenderness.
We have heard many country gentlemen remark on the extreme interior
similitude between a pig and a Christian. It appears in nothing so
much as in the circumstance that the pig, if teased or irritated, evinces
anger and annoyance — thereby provoking repetition of insult and
indignity.
We have not yet recovered from the wonder and amazement excited
by the monstrous turnips, and gigantic specimens of mangold-wurzel,
exhibited in the vegetable department.
As to the agricultural machinery—it was'perfectly harrowing; and
the various instruments for torturing the earth would, but for the
knowledge that the gtniui loci was eminently Protestant, have caused
us to shudder with tne idea of being surrounded by the appliances of
the Inquisition.
Whilst this exhibition continues to draw so enormously as it does,
the suggestion of any improvement may appear supeifluoui. Yet, if
the cattle were adorned with fillets and garlands; if the stalls were
decked with artificial flowers; if the necks of the pigs were decorated
with pink and bine ribbons; if the animals were attended by herdsmen,
shepherds, and swineherds, tastefully attired in the Arcadian fashion,
the whole affair would present an sesthetical character which it at
present lacks, and which would attract a still greater number of lacies
tban that which ou this last occasion attended the spectacle. A »
plentiful spargtfaction of Eau-de-Cologne, or of Kimmcl's toilet vinegar ■',
would also much conduce to this desirable result.
The arrangements for ventilation were, however, admirable; and the
state of things necestarily arising from a vast collection of oxen was
duly provided for by the arrangements for the plenteous admission of
oxygen.
SCENES IN THE CIRCLE.—MADAME CRINOLINE will, on the
eveutDg of her forthcoming Soiree, appear in her beautiful new dread of Ltoob'
■r aci si-v, tne circumference of which is expected to exceed everything of the kind,
the doors of her ball-room having been purposely enlarged to alloir of the perfect
ingretis and egreBS of the said costume without fear of disarranging the elegance of its
folds, or danger of an accident reducing the extrtmely liberal number of its flounces.
In the centre of that large circle, Madajik Crinoline- will remaiu for five hours (from
11 p.m. to 4 a.m.), and receive her fashionable friends. In addition to numerous other
feats of agiltty, such as jumping through fifteen different hoops, of which her duck of
a dnes is composed, and alighting each time upon her leer, the accomplished Lady
will, in the presence of the entire company, curtsey to every guest, drink a cup of
coffee, devour a Vanilie ice, sing a French song, walk through a quadrille, and stand,
without the least apparent fatigue, any amount of flattery from a noble Cavalry
Captain present; and, moreover, before retiring to rest, Madame Cbjmoline wlH
grocieuicmint favour the company by dancing the Polka with an Hungarian nobleman
of distluctlon, who has kindly promised to attend in his national costume. Cards will
be sent in due time (through the Messes. Gunterb') to ail Madahe de Crixouee's
friends. Supper at Two. Astley's band will be in attendance, and will play several
morccaux best adapted to the Circle in question.

MB. TREMBLE BOBPOWS A BlNT FBOM HIS Wife's CbLNOLINE, AND INVeNTS WHAT HE CALLS HIS "PATENT AnTI-G ABOTTE

RAMPANT IDIOTS.
Mr. Punch wanted an opportunity of making amends to the directors
of that admirable Institution, the Asylum for Idiots, for an expression
which, in the sensitive mind of its estimable Secretary, teemed calcu-
lated to injure the charity. In a suggestion from Calcutta touching
that model soldier, patriot, and noble.maD, Lord Donkellin, it was
hinted that a Cell in the Asylum would be a fitting place for him. We
are officially informed that the Asylum contains no cells, and that its
inmates are all provided for in comfortable apartments. We are most
happy to give publicity to the fact.
The Asylum for Idiots was naturally brought to Mr. Punch's mind
by a piece of presumptuous folly on the part of the Board of Works.
That remarkable set of scavengers, instead of attending to the drains,
are scrambling up to the corners of the streets, ar.d altering the names
thereof. Now really this is a little too bad. We almost doubt its
being believed. But the fact is so. One D'Iffanger, junior, (who
probably in moments of hallucination fancies himself as clever a fellow
as one D'Isbaeli, junior,) with a Committee, has been drawing up a
voluminous report upon street names in London. lie discovers—as
everybody who has read Peter Cunningham or John Times knew
already—that there are numbers of streets bearing the same names;
and so, with the presumption of vestrymen, Diffy (we may be par-
doned the liberty—we call the other great man Dizzy) and his lot
have set to work to devise new appellations.
They have gone about it in the way that might be expected from
their class. To a number of the streets members of the Board of
Works propose to append their own dignified names, not one of which
was ever heard of before, out of its owner's locality. These people
tuppose that BtGoiNS, Toggins. and Wiggins, are words that will
instantly conjure up the train of associations which it is desirable a
name should awaken. The only conceivable reason for having a dis-
tinctive name was to save the necessity of following it with a second
reference. There is some inconvenience in having to designate King
Street, as King Street, St. James's, or King Street, Covent Garden. So
the modest Member of the Board of Works proposes to say Wiggins
Street at once, as all the world must know where that is.
vol. xxxi.
But, dismissing these ambitious snobs, whose names have already
been trailed before the town, to the immense amusement, we should
think, of the districts in which it is proposed to stick them up, let us
look at some of the rest of Diffy's nomenclature; against which,
by the way, protests have already been made by persons whose names
he proposed to use. It displays the kind of educational process through
which the parcchial mind passes. Some names of great and good men
could not fail to have Btruck even members of the Board of Works,
whose children probably bring home Mangnall's Questions from school
for evening lessons. Some such happy accident accounts for the
presence in the report of suggestions in favour of men usually more
honoured anywhere than by "porochials." But we want to know by
what sentence of British law Londoners are to be compelled to live in
streets, christened after
Mr. Harrison Aimswortf,
"Poor" Power, the Actor,
Mb. Miall of the Noncenformist,
Booker, the Protectionist,
Adleb, the Hebrew Rabbi,
Cameron, supposed of the British Bank,
Sothiby, the Auctioneer,
Sir Culling Eardley of Exeter Hull,
And Mobley, of the Administration Reform Association!
Here are nine names which Difft & Co. solemnly propose to stick up
at the corners of our streets. Could one suppose that the absurdity
would go much further, the owners of the property thus to be adorned
had better consult their solicitors, as we conceive actions for wilful
depreciation would lie against the Board. Fancy dating a dance
invitation from "Culling Eardley Street," or asking a Quaker to dine
in "Poor Power Street," or trying to effect a mortgage on a house in
"Cameron Street."
We are sorry to trouble Sir Benjamin Hall again upon an un-
pleasant subject, but he really must restrain the vagaries of the Central
Board—this Centre—very Gauche. Unless he does bo forthwith, and
if he has not the power, he had better get it in February (the House
will suspend standing orders on emergency), Mr. Punch must become

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [December 27, 1856.
a Life Governor of the Asylum for Idiots, with a view to the benefit of
the Board.
In the meantime he would ask this question—" Whether the Board
is such an Idiot as to suppose that London will permit itself to be
called names by D'Iffasger and his allies?"
Should the answer be in the affirmative, Mr. Punch, drawing his
bludgeon, has but two words more to say to London:
"Suivez-moi!"
A STORY OF COMMON CLAY.
here is a tale of thrilling
interest told by a morning
paper of that renowned per-
sonage the great Dukk of
Bbabant. It commences
with the statement of the
following significant fact,
which lately occurred at
Brussels:—
* On Thursday hia Royal High-
ness, accompanied by a siugle aide-
de-camp, rode on horseback Blowly
into town,"
What a picture of com-
bined simplicity and grand-
eur! It will be readily ima-
gined that a narrative thus
commencing would proceed
to relate something extra-
ordinary, if not a circum-
stance quite so stupendous
as this:—
"On approaching the Porte de
Cologne, he Buddenly stopped his
horse, and, accosting a bumble
labourereniployed on the road side,
politely asked permiseioa to light
Lis cigar by the pipe which the poor man was then smoking."
A Royal Duke asking a labourer for a light—only fancy that ! What
is there to pattern it in the history of the world? The condescension,
perhaps, of a few angels, who, as we read, accepted of mortals' hospi-
tality. Nothing else; nothing less. It beats the romance of the
King and the Miller of Mansfield hollow.
The historian proceeds :—
"I need scarcely Bay that the request was acceded to with the greatest pleasure and
alacrity/1 *
The pleasure was, doubtless, more exquisite than that experienced
by the gentleman on being spoken to by his sovereign, when the
monarch told him to get out of the way; and the alacri y with which
the light was supplied to tbe Duke was perhaps almost as remarkable
as that with which the obstacle took itself away from the face of .the king.
Now for the sequel of this exciting story:—
"The Duke having enkindled bis cigar in the way designated, familiarly returned
the pipe into the bands of the labourer, and, thanking him for the kindness thus ren-
dered him, raised his bat from his head while graciously bidding him farewell."
An English nobleman under similar circumstances would probably
have given the man sixpence, and the pleasure of the recipient would
have been precisely limited by his idea of the sum. But tbe Duke of
Khabant gave the "humble labourer" a far higher than a sixpenny
recampence. He returned the pipe a very different thing from what
he received it. He received it mere clay, he returned it as good as
aluminium—if not gold. "Pipe"—perhaps exclaimed the peasant,
paraphrasing unconsciously a line of Shakspeare, and apostrophising
the 'cutty" which had been sanctified by the suction of a Duke—
"Pipe, I will hallow thee for this thy deed!" This, of course was
his thought, if not his speech, as he watched the departing apparition
of the Royal Highness who had honoured the tube. Of course, in so
doing, the Duke put the poor fellow's pipe out, never to be lighted
again, but to be preserved evermore as a sacred relic, and transmitted
to posterity as an heir-loom.

Brutal Assault.
We regret to hear that Dr. Livingstone, the African explorer, was
attacked the other evening in so brutal a manner that he is still suffer-
ing from the shock his nervous system has sustained. Taking advan-
tage of the Doctor's long disuse ol English, a facetious ruffiin contrived,
before the worthy Doctor could fitid words to stop him, to discharge in
his ear this appalling riddle:
Q. What African lake derives its name apparently; from an elderly
female fowl that has been hanging up a fortnight in the hottest of the
dogdays P
A. Hsngamey! (By which it is supposed the Cockney miscreant
meant to say Ngami.)
GERMANISM IN JOURNALISM.
We very much wish that our contemporaries, in alluding to the
pictures about to be exhibited at Manchester, would cease to
denominate them Art-Treasures. Why not ea'l them Treasures of
Art P Suppose we were to talk of Imagination-Works, meaning works
of Imagination, should we not be deemed to talk very affected stnff?
Ton might as well say Science-Discovery as Art-Treasure: or describe
a learned or a virtuous person as a learning-charae'er, or a virtue-man.
A joke, on the same principle, might be termed a wit-speech, or a fun-
saying. It is all very well to say mince-pie and plum-pudding: these
are pleasant compounds, and not hashes of abstract and ooncete, dis-
agreeable to the sense of fitness. What, however, makes Art-Treasures
a peculiarly disagreeable word is that it is a vile Germanism; sad tbe
same objeetion applies to all the various phrases consisting of "Art"
skewered to some other word with a hyphen. Let us bear bo more of
art-coffee-pots, art-cream-jugs, art-fenders, art-fi e-irons, art-caps, and
art-saucess, art-sugar-tongs, and art-spoons: in snort, no more art-
bo»h, art-humbug, and art-twaddle. Stick to the Qoeeh's Etgli.-b,
and there stop. Cjrrupt it not by adulteration with German slang;
do not teach tbe freebom British Public to adopt tbe idioms, or rather
idiotisoiB, .of the language of"
THE POOR BLACKS.
Dr. Livingstone, the ga'lant explorer cf Africa, returns after sixteen
years of adventure, with a tale worth a Qcesn's attention—could he
not have been asked to meet tbe Americans, who came with tbe ret cued
exploration ship from the north? This by the bye. We chiefly desire
to deplore the frightful barbarism into which some of the tribes, of
whom Dr. Livingstone otherwise reports favourably, have fallen. The
Doctor says that "the nen are entirely under the control of their
wives;" that when anything is proposed to a man he replies, " I will
ask my wife," and her decision is final; and, worse than all," a man"
(more unhappy eTen than Caliban) " is obliged; to cut and draw logs for
his Mothers-in-Law."
We have sometimes thought that our missionary zeal might perhaps
find work at home, but we shall henceforth have no word to say against
the African Mission—in fact we shall send in our subscription.

THE BIRTH OP CRINOLINE.
Fashion was plotting how to shape
A garment for the Fair,
When she bethought her of the cape,
Which jarveys used to wear.
In mode thereof her dress she piled
With skirts of huge extent.
Then danced around her work, and smiled,
In bland enravishment.
Deleterious Compound.
Thb Incorporated Law Society proposes a concentration of the
Courts of Law and Equity. Dreadful! Law is bad enough by itself,
and Equity is too bad, but Law and bquity combined and concentrated
will be as bad as bad can be. If their respective courts are congregated
under one roof, as is recommended, their pernicious atmospheres will
mingle. The resulting compound will resemble a mixture of
acid gas and sulphuretted hydrogen.

CRINOLINEOMANIA.
TREATED PATHOLOGICALLY BY DB. PUNCH.
BINOLIKEOMANIA m*y
be said to be essentially
female complaint,
although many of the
other sex— husbands
in particular—ate con-
tinually complaining
of it. Men, however,
though it cannot be
denied that they occa-
sionally Buffer from it,
do so not so much in
person as in purse.
Although not abso-
lutely of a contagious
character, the disease
is certainly a widely-
spreading one; and
but small success has
hitherto attended the
attempts which have
been made to check its
progress. In his capacity of mental adviser to the State, Dr. Punch
has been as usual most voluminously consulted; and, if need were, he
could point to several perambulator-loads of correspondence, in which
his advice has been most urgently requested. It would ill accord with
Dr. Punch's reputation for philanthropy were be any longer to keep his
opinion to himself, and he therefore, at the small fee of threepence, now
gives it to the nation.
That Crinolineomania is of foreign origin Dr. Punch considers there
is little roomior doubt; indeed, if he were called upon to fix the spot
precisely where the malady broke out, without hesitation he would
point to Paris. Dr. Punch has ample grounds for his belief that the
persons first affected were the ladies attached to the Imperial Court;
and it is a more than mere surmise wi'h him, that symptoms of the
mania were primarily betrayed by the young and lovely Empress. Of
its introduction to this kingdom, Dr. Punch can scarcely speak with
any certainty, but be assumes that it may be attributed mainly to the
milliners, who in their intercourse between the two capitals are pretty
sure to communicate whatever may be catching. Tne alarming way
in which the malady has spread among our countrywomen Dr. Punch
assigns to the authenticated fact that the female intellect is prone to
imitation; and it is to such influences as Crinolineomania that the
weaker-minded of the sex are peculiarly sensitive.
Although the disease is at root a mental one, the symptoms which
denote it are always most perceptibly developed in the pet son. These
are attended with but small variety, their chief feature being the
distortion of the figure, by a most, unnatural increase, or excrescence,
which deprives all those who are afflicted with it of their natural ease
and freedom of motion. Unsightly although they may appear to the
male eye, these protuberances it is thought are pleasing to the female,
a discrepancy which Dr. Punch is unable to explain, further than by
stating that there is proverbially no accounting for taste. With the
maniacs themtelves these excrescences seem ratber to be prized than
otherwise, for a vehement resistance is generally made to any attempt
that may be offered to reduce them. The protuberance is not found to
vary much in size, although perhaps it may be noticed that it is with
persons of the thinnest figure it attains its greatest magnitude. Bat in
colour it is quite chameleon-l'ke in changing, displaying in the daytime
the most variegated hues, while at night it more frequently assumes
the appearance of a mere white swelling.
Like other insane people, the Crinoliueomaniao is difficult to approach
—indeed it may be said that even her nearest relatives have to stand
some distance off her. And it is in this respect that the disease is so
destructive to domestic comfort; for when a married lady is afflicted
by the malady, her husband is compelled to keep at arm's length from
her. Whether, as the mania thus leads to a virtual separation, it might
not be regarded as sufficient grounds for a divorce, is a point for the con-
sideration of Doctors' Commons perhaps more fitly than of Dr. Punch.
That Crinolineomania is contagious in its nature has been proved in
many well-authenticated cases, where an attack has been brought on
by a visit to a milliner's, a locality which is always to be shunned as
dangerous, but which no amount of warning will suffice to keep a lady
long away from. Dr. Punch would therefore recommend that the
Eatient be removed as far as possible from these infected places; and
e would further prescribe a total abstinence from those exciting
causes, such as walks down Regent Street and illustrated books of
fashions, which are found too frequently to be iuducivc of the mania.
Dr. Punch would also suggest the propriety of putting the patient on a
low diet of pin-money, so that her straitened means might act in some
way in the nature of a straitwaistcoat, and restrain her in
degree from giving vent to the extravagance which is inseparably a
part of the complaint. This restraint, however, Dr. Punch would only
recommend in extreme cases, for he much prefers the moral force treat-
ment to the purely physical. It has been urged, indeed, that as the
mania is attended with a marked determination of folly to the head,
which, in consequence, becomes completely turned, the appliances of
argument are set quite at defiuice; but although the Crinolineomaniacs
may, in common with their sex, betray a deafness to reason, it by no
means is a sequitur that t hey are blind to ridicule; and trusting therefore
gradually to get them lauphed out of their insanity, Dr. Punch will
continue to dispense this wholesome medicine, in weekly doses, at the
small charge of threepence—or at fourpence, with the Government
Stamp.
RULES FOR INCREASING THE INEFFICIENCY
OF THE POLICE.
Increase the number of tickets-of-leave.
Render prisons more comfottable, by augmenting the diet of wine and
beer, spirits and tobacco, with occa.<ional concerts, private theatricals,
and soirees.
Annihilate all changes of beats.
Make the infliction of punishments ordered still more uncertain.
Lengthen the hours of duty of the Police, so as to make their occu-
pation more irksome, as well as extend the area of their acquaintances,
be they hilarious, burglarious, culiiations, or otherwise.
Make it penal for policemen to change their routes, so that the
thieves and garottemen may safely calculate at what particular minute
they will pass a certain point selected for robbery or assault.
Surround the "Superannuation Fund" with increasing annoyances
and difficulties.
Were these rules enforced to the letter, or rather every letter in all
the Police diviiions, th're might be some chance of the inefficiency of
the Police being so effectually increased that no ratepayer would
«! t-m of placing the smallest reliance upon them.
N.B. All salaries should be reduced, and the deductions usually
made for clothing and boots proportionately augmented.
AN EPITAPH (CONSIDERABLY) AFTER MILTON.
On that admirable, but lately maligned Dramatic Poet, the divine
Williams.
"What needs my Shakspeabe for his honoured bones,"
The veneration of Smith, Brown, and Jones P
Or that his hallowed genius should be hid
From dunces by pedantic Form bestrid P
"Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,"
What matter if Ponsard asperse thy name?
That is no wonder, no astonishment:
All are not ptdants on the Continent.
For whilst Teutonic poetry and art
Esteem thy numbers, and the German heart
Prizes the leaves of thine unvalued book,
What, if thou by a boob/ art mistook P
Thou, a dull coxcomb of his rules bereaving,
Hast stupified him by too much conceiving.
Calling thee obsolete bonhomme /—the fly
Hss buzzed about thy glory—let him die.
A REVIVAL FOR RANK AND FASHION.
Ladies of rank and fashion will be glad to hear that the reappearance
of General Tom Thumb is advertised for the 26th instant. The
levees of this interesting dwarf are to commence at an Exhibition Hall
which was, at the date of the advertisement, wanted. The Surrey
Music Hall naturally suggests itself as calculated, by its enormous
dimensions, to contain a crowd likely to exceed that attracted by Mb.
Spubgeon, and to take up infinitely more room by reason of the pro-
digious extent of the circumferences of the dresses of females so
fashionable as those who would constitute Tom Thumb's congregation.
But then, unfortunately, the Surrey Hall is on the vulgar side of the
water, whither an attraction so powerful as even that of Btunted
humanity might fail to allure the beauty and intelligence of the superior
classes.
Rogues and Registrars.
At a numerously attended meeting of thieves, held yesterday at the
Abershaw's Arms, it was determined to petition Parliament for an
Act empowering all prisoners, indicted for theft or swindling, to
demand a jury chosen from the officials of Doctors'-Commons, or tome
other Consistory Court, in order that rogues may be enabled to be tried
by their peers.

such a Horrid Baw to be Flogoed for Smokiko!"
WAITS.
The Waits this Christmas are as numerous as usual: but
as the 'bus conductor said of ladies in full drets, we have
only room for one or two of them. For instance, then—
The Russian Government waits—with its duplicate Bol-
grads, to try and "come the double" over us.
The King op Prussia waits—for a slice of Neufcba'el,
if they won't give him the whole of it.
Louis Napoleon waits—a little longer for that Rood
time coming, when he hopes to hold the Scissorship of. the
British press.
Kino Bohba waits—to see if the divinity that "doth
hedge a king" be a fence against stilettos.
Lord John Russell waits—to turn over a new leaf,
and perhaps a strawberry one.
The Conservative small party wait—for a nice young
Coming Man, wbo can "give them the office" as to how
they may get into it.
The British Museum readers wait—for the day (before
Doomsday) when the Catalogue will be published.
The unprotected British Public wait—to be guaranteed
against garotting, and to see the last of the small profits
that have attended the early returns of the licket-of-!eave
Convicts.
The Ratepayers of London wait—upon the Board of
Words, for an answer to the eewage question, which
appears at present only to be talked of.
Sir Charles Napier waits—to embrace every opportu-
nii y for " writing himself down" in the opinion of the public.
And, finally, the Russian diplomatists wait—for the
Spring, which may enable them to see which way the
Persian cat will jump.
A Mere Surmise.
A Continental Journal states that Milano, the roldier
who mused the heart of Kino Bomba (his Majest/s
subjects have done so for some years) had formerly been
in the diplomatic service. We belevc ti is is simply a
guess, prompted, naturally enough, by the fact that he
blundered his woik. The writer should remember that
diplomacy Sticks at nothing contemptible.
One Good Turn for Another.—During the War we
threatened, but could not get at, St. Petersburg. On the
other hand, the Czab, in the proposal of his railway scheme,
has made an abortive attempt on our own capital.
A SHOET WAI "WITH TICKET8-OF-LEAVE.
In this time of terror, with, at least, a hundred thousand affectionate
wives beset by nightly anxiety deepening into terror as the half-hours
pas«, and their husbands do not come home,—let no proposition be
scofnngly received and contemptuously dismissed, that shall provide
against the ravages of the social dragon of the hour, Ticketotleave.
We therefore unhesitatingly publish the proposition of a most respect-
able, most affable elderly gentlewoman; a proposition which, growing
eloquent the other afternoon over her tea and muffins, she pronounced
as showing the only certain means of safely and comfortably providing
for all ticket-of-leave men.
In a word, our amiable gentlewoman proposes to billet all ticket-of-
leave men upon the ministers of the Church. And, truly, there is
something very deserving of respectful attention in the notion.
Tbe gentlewoman sets out with a flattering description of the
functions of all ministers of the Established Church. She asks—Are
tbey not the real curers of souls P As Christian teachers and admo-
nishers, who so fit to teach and admonish the ticket-of-leave man; and
by daily precept and daily example, to bring him from the c ooked
path unto the straight one P
The gentlewoman does not profess to know either the statistics of
the Established Chuich, or of the institution of Ticket-of-Leave j but
has a lively confidence that, with very little expense to the state, the
erring sheep might be so allotted among the shepherds, that not one
wanderer might remain untended.
The gentlewoman proposes to begin by allotting, say one hundred
ticket-of-leave men to the care of each of the archbishops. With the
vast estates of either see, there would be ample accommodation, she
verily believes, for the unfortunates; whose labour might be made
at least self-supporting; whilst the morals of the men must benefit
even bejond all expectation by the influence of their spiritual and
material guardians.
To every bishop she would assign from thiity to forty Tickets-of-
Leave, according to the income of tbe bishop selected.
To every dean so many Tickets-of-Leave; so many Tickets-of-Leave
to evety prebend; and so down to vicars, rectors, and at length to
country curates, who should receive a certain stipend fiom the state
for every Ticket.
The amiable gentlewoman expressed herself very hopefully on the
result of her proposition, if fairly put into practice; and reserving bis
own opinion whether the Bench of Bishops would altogether agree in
the wisdom of the old lady's suggestion, Mr. Punch promised to put it
into piint, and has done so.
BLACK AND WHITE SAVAGES.
Dr. Livingstone, the African mfcsionary and traveller, has
encountered great perils in Central Africa; but we apprehend that
these would be much exceeded by the danger he would incur if he were
to attempt to explore the Southern States of America. He relates
that the natives of the former region expressed their vague idea that he
was an Englishman by saying, "Oh, we know who you are; you belong
to tbe tribe that loves the black man." This, of course, was a very
r-xce'lent character to bear among the Central Africans; but among
the American savages it would probably draw on the bearer the bead
of the revolver, bring the point of tbe bowie-knife, and superinduce the
uncomfortable investment of tar and feathers.
Conversation in Chancery Lane.

Bright Youth. Why, you fool, it forms part of the legal course—for
instance, every banister, after he has eaten his Terms, has to go through
his Digest!
