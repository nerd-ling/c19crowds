UNCTUAL (like American fashions) to French time, which is rather faster, especially on the Tuileries’
clock, than that of England, His Serene Highness, the CoMET, duly arrived on the appointed date.
As other foreign illustriousnesses are sometimes attended by a scent of consumed cigars, H. S. H. was
accompanied by an odour as of burned-out planets. His head in a wide-awake, and his tail enveloped
in asbestos continuations, H. S. H. hastened to report himself under St. Bride's.
“What’s brought you ?” said MR. PUNch—whose maxim, debellare superbos, is ever before him.
“Why, I was prophesied,” replied the CoMET, humbly, “ and I did not like to disgrace SciENCE,
who has been so fortunate in all her predictions of late years.”
“True,” replied MR. PUNch, more graciously. “Very true.
drive a railway car more than eight miles an hour—Steam across the Atlantic was impossible—the
Crystal Palace must crunch up by vibration, or be blown to sea by the winds—and now the Telegraph
to America will not carry a message, and the Great Eastern is an ark to which no dove will bring a
dividend. You are right, SciENCE has been happy in her auguries, and she foretold you. You are
welcome. Sit down, if your arrangements permit that attitude.”
The CoMET, severing asunder his glittering tail as easily as one of PETER WILKINs's Flying
Indians adjusted her graundee, took a chair.
“May I ask what news is stirring 7" said H. S. H.
“In our Earth ?” asked MR. PUNCH. “Well, none. The four Continents are at peace—”
“Eh P’’ said the CoMET. “I took China, America, and Algeria in my way, and gun-boats were
throwing shells, Filibusters were engaging regulars, and Zouaves were driving dark fellows into caves—”
“If your Serene Highness had been kind enough to hear me out,” said MR. PUNch, “I was going
to add—the four Continents, with the exception of Asia, Africa, and America. In Europe we are keeping
the peace with great solemnity. Louis NApoleon, setting example, insists on such extreme peace, that even
at his elections, His Majesty objects to opposition candidates. ALExANDER sends the gentle Constantine

to count English and French guns, as he would not own one more for the world—no, not for Con-
stantinople. FRANCIs Joseph, too, has a brother MAxIMILIAN, and he is here to express the ecstacy of
Austria at the prospect of our Prussian alliance being drawn closer by HYMEN.”
“ Tu, felia, Austria, nube,” said the CoMET, “is a hint which he delights to find others can take.”
“Nube—in a cloud,” said MR. PUNch, smiling. “A passable jest from a Highness from Cloud-
land, but scarcely bright enough for me—however—let it go. Then, your Serene Highness, in Belgium,
Leopold the Astute, finding the priests flying something too frantically at the throat of LIBERTY, has flogged
them off, for the hour; but she will never walk about in peace, poor thing, until they are chained up as the
Belgian people will chain them in the next Revolution. Pius the NINTH is making progress—do not
start—only through his dominions, crowning pictures of the Virgin, which Wink with pleasure, and
actually mutter “LA SALETTE.” The innocent Is ABELLA again muses on the sweet joys of maternity,
and vows, should she be blessed with a daughter, to make her an example of all the Virtues, to which
end baby is to be sent from Spain before she can even see.”
“And your own QUEEN ?” -
“Is troubled, thank Providence, by no greater care than the direction of the baptism of PRINCEss
BEATRICE, and the consideration whether at the HANDEL Festival, the Conquering Hero should come twice.”
“And Lord PALMERston. I have had an eye on him for these seventy-three years,” said the
CoMET. “I had a good mind to appear at his birth, and prognosticate his becoming a great man.”
“You are a humbug,” said MR. PUNch. “Where was he born ?”
The CoMET stuttered—and said it was a good while ago, and the place had escaped him.
“He was born at Broadlands, you astrological humbug,” said MR. PUNch, “where I hope he
will spend many a jolly year yet, especially his Reform Bill Year, now fixed as 1858.”
“LoRD PALMERston a Reformer,” said the CoMET, looking troubled. “Hm. Well. Ah!”
“Don’t mutter in that way,” said MR. PUNCH. “If you know anything, out with it like a man
and a Comet, if not, don’t be mysterious. LoRD PALMERston has promised a Reform Bill for next year,
and I am going to keep him up to his work in my THIRTY-THIRD Volume—”
“Is the THIRTY-Second complete?” said the CoMET, tremulously.
“Complete,” said MR. Punch. “I present you with a copy. Here!”
“If a New Volume of PUNCH is to be launched, I’m sure the world wants no Comet,” cried the
individual in asbestos trowsers. “I shall not show.”
And he bolted through the window into infinite space, taking with him, for the edification of the Solar
System,

POLITICAL SUMMARY.
URadmirable summary—The Essence of Parliament—being
sufficiently explanatory of the proceedings of the Legis-
lature, we avail ourselves of the space at our command to give
at some length the details of the two great events which make
the year 1857 memorable in our annals. Towards the close of
last year, a dispute arose concerning a Chinese lorcha called
the Arrow, and the Chinese Commissioner took such measures
as compelled the British Squadron, then in the Canton waters,
to destroy several forts, and to commence a war which led to
the capture of Canton, and a Treaty of Commerce more liberal
in its conditions than had hitherto existed with the Celestial
Empire.
An atrocious massacre was perpetrated at the close of the
year 1856, on board a small steamer called the Thistle, used
for carrying the mails between Canton and Hong-Kong. A
party of Chinese soldiers went on board disguised as passengers,
and as the vessel was proceeding down the river they attacked
the Europeans on board, eleven in number, and murdered
them all. They then ran the vessel aground, in a creek,
abandoned her, and set her on fire, escaping themselves with
impunity.
It was found, early in January, 1857, that the force at the
disposal of ADMIRAL SIR MICHAEL SEYMoUR was too small
to occupy with safety all the positions taken from the Chinese,
and after destroying the factories by fire, the troops were con-
centrated in the place called the Gardens and the Dutch Folly,
while the ships of war were anchored in different parts of the
river. Afterwards, it was determined to abandon the Gardens,
and occupy only the Dutch Folly and Bird's Nest forts, and
on the 12th of January, parties of troops were landed in the
western suburbs of Canton, who, carried with them fire-balls
and lighted torches, and assisted by shells from the ships they
soon involved the suburb in a general conflagration, and then
retired. The suburb blazed for two days, and on the second
day the Chinese fired some rockets upon the Dutch Folly
fort, but our superior practice soon compelled them to desist.
Afterwards, the church and club-house at Canton were blown
up by our troops, and the Dutch Folly and Bird's Nest forts
were also abandoned. The steamers were withdrawn from
the upper part of the river, and the troops took up their
position in the Teatotum fort, near the Macao passage.
Whampoa also was entirely abandoned.
To show the vindictive spirit in which the Imperial Com-
missioner YEH was disposed to carry on the contest, we may
mention that he issued a proclamation, which contained the
following tariff of rewards, promised to those who succeeded
in killing any of the “red-haired foreign dogs”—that is, the
British and French.
“1. Whoever catches an English or French rebel chief will receive a reward
of 5000 dollars.
“2. Whoever cuts off the head of a rebel barbarian will receive a reward
of 50 dollars.
“3. Whoever catches a rebel barbarian alive will receive a reward of 100
dollars.
“4. Whoever catches a traitor, will, on producing satisfactory evidence,
receive a reward of 20 dollars.
“5. Whoever can manage to burn or take a large war steamer will receive
a reward of 10,000 dollars.
“6. Whoever can manage to burn or take a shallow water steamer will
receive 2000 dollars, and be recommended for further reward.”
The proclamation added:—
“All those who are in the employ of the foreign dogs must leave their
employment in one month, and after one month, if they still stay with the
foreign dogs, and do not return to their native villages, the elders of the
pAcrº

villages will hand over their families to the authorities to be punished, as if
they were the red-head rebels. - . The Americans, Spaniards, and
other foreign nations are on good terms with ours. The stoppage of trade is
solely caused by the English and French dogs, and complaints must be made
against them alone and not us."
This insolent and barbarous proclamation led to two
expeditions, one under Commodore ELLIOTT, and the other
under ADMIRAL SIR MICHAEL SEYMoUR, and which ended in
the destruction of the Chinese fleet of war-junks in the
Canton Waters. On the 29th of May, ADMIRAL SEYMoUR
quitting his flag-ship the Calcutta, went on board a small
steamer, the Coromandel, and aided by ADMIRAL KEPPEL,
who steamed up a channel to the right of Hyacinth Island,
succeeded in capturing the City of Fatshan, and destroying
all the war-junks but three, two of which the next morning
appeared three miles astern, and fired a gun. They were
chasing the barbarian fleet! We shall have to resume this
subject in our next volume.
The conduct of DR. BowRING and the Government in this
affair with China, was made the subject of a vote of censure
by LoRD DERBY in the House of Lords, but it was carried
against him by a majority of 36. The Ministry were not so
fortunate in the House of Commons. A concurrent debate,
on the motion of MR. Cobden, and a majority of 16 against
the Government brought about an immediate dissolution of
Parliament. The general election, however, which ensued,
gave unmistakeable evidence that the country was with LoRD
PALMERSTON.
The result was, the return of a very powerful phalanx of
Government supporters, while those members of the Liberal
party who had stood aloof or had shown an unfriendly spirit
towards the great Parliamentary chief, found that even their
popular opinions and their well-earned reputation were insuf-
ficient to secure their election for the constituencies which had
formerly supported them. Thus MR. CoBDEN, who declined
to contest the West Riding, and fell back upon Huddersfield,
found himself defeated by an untried politician in that borough.
MEssRs. BRIGHT and GIBSON were forced to yield to two can-
didates of ministerial politics at Manchester; MR. LAYARD was
discomfited at Aylesbury, and MR. Fox at Oldham. Another
party, whose numbers, indeed, had before borne small pro-
portion to their activity and talent, commonly known by the
designation of Peelites, were even more severely worsted in
the contest. Their thin ranks were still further reduced by
the rejection of several of their conspicuous debaters. From
these circumstances the PREMIER met the new Parliament,
which had been convoked for the 30th April, under very
favourable auspices. His supporters formed a strong and
compact body; his more formidable opponents were driven
from the field, or weakened by the consciousness that the
public voice had declared against them.
In the beginning of June, the first distant murmur of the
Indian Mutiny was heard in this country; but as its history
belongs to the later portion of this year, we will merely
subjoin an extract from a speech by LoRD ELLENBoRough :—
“I read,” said the noble Lord, “in the latest accounts from India, that
between the 16th and 25th of April there were seven incendiary fires, and
that the 3rd Regiment of Light Cavalry was in open mutiny. How it can be
possible that a regiment having no more than 400 sabres could for one half-
hour be in a state of open mutiny in the cantonment of Meerut is what I
cannot comprehend. At that station there is, I believe, a force of 54 guns,
42 of European and 12 of Native Artillery; there is a regiment of European
Cavalry, the Carabineers; a battalion of the 60th Regiment, Queen's troops;
and two regiments of Native Infantry. The officer who commands that division
had the means of putting down any mutiny in half-an-hour. Open mutiny
is open war, and it is to be met only as open war carried on by an enemy in
the field. I cannot but think that there must have been some strange mis-
representation and exaggeration in the accounts which we have received from
India. I have, however, looked most carefully into all the statements which
we have received as to these mutinies in the Bengal territory, and I can come
to no other conclusion than that the source of all that discontent and mutiny
is the apprehension that there is an intention on the part of the Government
to interfere with the religion of the natives.”
His Lordship then went on to say that LoRD CANNING's
patronage of a Society for the Conversion of the Natives had
had a most mischievous tendency, and that the Indian Govern-
ment were highly censurable for allowing a suspicion to exist
that they were favourable to a compulsory conversion of the
Sepoys.
To this LoRD GRAN VILLE replied:—
“He thought that the remarks just made would have a mischievous
tendency in India. No information respecting the mutiny at Meerut had
reached the Government except by telegraph, and it was impossible to rely
entirely on the accuracy of information so forwarded. He was astonished at
the attack made on Lord CANNING. He did not know whether Lord CANNING
had subscribed to any missionary society, but he knew that the most
unfounded and ridiculous remarks had been circulated—such as that Lord
CANNING had given a pledge to Lord PALM ERsroN that he would convert the
whole population. LoRD CANNING's first exercise of the veto was to arrest a
police bill, because it might affect the religious feelings of the natives. Had
he issued a notification like that recommended by Lord ELLENBorough, he
would have appeared to acknowledge that there had been a change of policy.
The Government entirely approved of his course.”.
We reserve the continuance of this terrible story for our
next volume.

2 A Hint to the Crystal Palace Directors.-MR. FER-
GUson was Managing Director, and “Living Stone"
(LIVINGSTONE) is the name of the great African traveller.
3 The Height of Ingratitude.—H.M.S. Resolute, one of
the abandoned Arctic ships, was recovered by the American
expedition, and generously restored to this country.
3 “Mind your I's.”—On the 15th of January, PIERCE, a
greengrocer, BURGEss, a railway guard, and TESTER, a clerk
in the superintendent's office, were tried for stealing, on the
South-Eastern Railway, gold bullion of the value of £12,000.
From the statement of the counsel for the prosecution, as
corroborated by the evidence, it appeared that on the 15th of
May, 1855, three boxes containing gold were taken to the
"South-Eastern Railway Company's Station at London Bridge,
for the purpose of being conveyed to Paris. The boxes were
bound with iron hoops or bars, and after having been weighed
and sealed, were placed, according to the usual practice, in
iron safes. These safes were secured by CHUBB's patent
locks, the keys of which were entrusted to confidential servants
of the Company. As a further precaution, the guard of the
train usually took the safes into his own van, and was thus
enabled to see to their safety during the journey. On the
night in question BURGESs was the guard of the train, and in
his van the iron safes were placed. On their arrival at
Boulogne the boxes were taken out of the safes and weighed,
and the same process was again gone through at Paris. At
the latter place it was ascertained that a considerable portion
of the bullion had been abstracted from the boxes, and a
quantity of shot substituted for it; and on a comparison of
the weight of the boxes at the various stages, it was found
that the weights at Paris corresponded with those at Boulogne,
but varied from those which were taken at London. From
this it was evident that the robbery must have been committed
between London and Boulogne; but further than this the
strictest investigation for some time appeared to afford no clue
to the discovery of the criminals. In October, 1855, a person
of the name of AGAR was tried and convicted of uttering a
forged cheque, and was sentenced to transportation for life.
At the time of his arrest he had in his possession a considerable
sum of money. He arranged with the prisoner PIERCE that
the latter should take possession of all his property, on the
understanding that a woman, in whom AGAR was interested,
and by whom he had had a child, should be provided for out
of its proceeds. This PIERCE did for some time; but subse-
quently, when AGAR had been convicted, neglected his
promises, and thus allowed the woman and her child to be
reduced to a state of the greatest distress. This fact coming
to the knowledge of AGAR, he came forward and made known
the whole circumstances of the robbery. The boxes con-
taining the gold had been opened on their way to Folkestone
by AGAR, who was concealed in the luggage-van, and shot sub-
stituted for the gold extracted. The trial is well worthy
perusal.
4 Election Intelligence.—MR. ANDREws was a coachmaker
of Southampton, and very popular with the electors.
NOTES.
Switzerland Warming the Snake.—See France. The
KING OF PRUSSIA had laid claim to the sovereignty of Neuf-
châtel, and Louis NAPOLEON, to whom Switzerland had given
protection during his exile, was said to favour the claims of
Prussia.
“Sleigh l-Sleigh -Sleigh l’”—This person was always
considered by Punch to be a political charlatan, and he sub-
sequently turned out something worse. He opened a Bank
of Deposit for the receipt of small sums at interest, and then
made free with the money, ruining many poor people.
The Prussian Disturber of the Peace.—See Note to
p. 5, ante.
Tickets-of-Leave to Ride.—This scheme (very general
in Paris) did not answer in London.
John Chinaman.—See Introduction.
Tewkesbury and Glasgow.—HUMPHREY BROWN and
MR. MAcc REGoR were directors of the British Bank, which
made such a disgraceful ending.
Homoeopathic Comfort.—LORD ERNEST WANE TEMPEST.
See Wol. XXXI.
Emily, &c.—India-rubber tubing was advertised as an
adjunct to that contrivance for making women appear ridi-
culous—the Crinoline; but proved a failure, we believe.
Clicquot's Last.—LA WEUVE CLIcquot's champagne has
a world-wide reputation, and the late KING of PRUssIA
was said (falsely) to have been over-partial to it.
About the English of it.— Punch was right as usual.
Lunacy in Shoe Lane.—The Morning Herald was pub-
lished in Shoe Lane at this time.
Descend, ye Nine.—The Income-Tax Ninepence,
The Late Preston Brookes.—BRookes was a Southern
United States senator, and committed a brutal assault upon
MR. Som ERs, also a senator, during a discussion having
reference to the abolition of slavery in America.
The Balancing Brothers of Westminster.—MR. DIS-
RAELI and MB. GLADSTONE, ex-Chancellors of the Exchequer.
Singular Delusion.—An Apostle-spoon was formerly pre-
sented at christenings, the handle being fashioned into the
likeness of the patron saint.
A Question to Mr. Linklater.—MR. LINKLATER was
the attorney, and MR. R. P. HARDING was the accountant,
concerned in winding up the affairs of this unfortunate con-
Ceril.
An Invitation.—See Essence of Parliament.
An Irresistible Conclusion.—The Press newspaper was
said to derive much of its inspiration from MR. DISRAELI.
Punch's Essence of Parliament.—The BISHOP OF
Oxford and CoMMIssion ER YEH.

The Polite Letter-Writer.—SIR John M'NEILL and
CoLoNEL TULLoch had been long engaged in drawing up a
Report on the Disasters of the Crimea, and were very scurvily
treated for their pains. Their Report was too honestly and
independently drawn up.
Mr. Punch (mysteriously). — MR. WILLIAMs, M.P.,
stated on the hustings that he had refused the offer of a title.
Cherub Cobden, &c.—MR. BRIGHT and MR. CoRDEN
were both unseated at the General Election.
“What Next 1”—It was proposed by some of the Omnibus
proprietors to form a “Correspondence" with all parts of
London, whereby passengers were to exchange omnibuses
until they reached their place of destination. The plan did
not succeed.
Great and Important Event.—H. R. H. the PRINCEss
BEATRICE MARY WICTORIA FEoDoRE was born on the 14th of
April, 1857.

How they Settled Neufchâtel.—The KING of PRussia

receipt of one million francs from the Helvetic Confederation.
The King, to keep in perpetuity the title of PRINCE of NEUF-
cm3TEL, but to found upon that title no rights whatever,
either in Switzerland or Neufchâtel. Hence the cut.

Training for Court.—The dreadful crowding on Drawing-

arrangements of the Chamberlain's Office, continued until the
latter part of this year (1863).

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1857.
Moral, For JANUARY
In January, o'er the ice,
The rapid skater flies,
So never scorn sincere advice
“Economy is wise.”
3f. º: PATTY was an orphan,
and dwelt in a cot with a sour old aunt.
It chanced, it being bitter cold, that three
hunters came and craved for meat and
drink. “Pack,” said the sour aunt;
“neither meat nor drink have ye here.”
“Neither meat nor drink," said PATTY
“but something better.” And she ran an
brought some milk, some eggs, and some
flour, and beating them up, poured the
batter in the pan. Then she took the pan,
and tossed the cake once; and then a robin
alighted at the window, and kept singing
these words—One good turn deserves another.
And PATTY tossed and tossed the cakes;
and the hunters ate their fill and departed.
And next day the hunter baron came in
state to the cot; and trumpets were blown,
and the heralds cried— One good turn
deserves another; in token whereof PATTY
became the baron's wife, and pancakes
were eaten on Shrove-Tuesday ever after.

In February, feathered songsters pair,
The crocus and the snowdrop rear their

Then let us of intemperance beware,
And early seek, and early leave, our

OppoRTUNITY NEGLECTED.—The four-
teenth of February is pairing day, and
what a fine thing it would be if all the
talkative simpletons in the House of Com-
mons would take a hint from the occasion,
and pair off for the Session :

$t. Đallp.–At an early age, St. Dolly
showed the sweetness of her nature by
her tender love for her widowed father; a
baker, dwelling at Pie-Corner, with a
large family of little children. It chanced
that, with bad harvests, bread became so
dear that, of course, bakers were ruined
by high prices. The miller fell upon
Dolly's father, and swept the shop with
his golden thumb. Not a bed was left for
the baker or his little ones. St. Dolly
slept upon a flour-sack, having prayed
that good angels would help her to help
her father. Now, sleeping, she dreamt
that the oven was lighted, and she felt
falling in a shower about her raisins,
currants, almonds, lemon-peel, flour, with
heavy drops of brandy. Then in her
dream she saw the fairies gather up the
things that fell, and knead them into a
cake. They put the cake into the oven;
and, dancing round and round, the fairies
vanished, crying–Draw the cake, Dolly;
Dolly, draw the cake. And Dolly awoke
and drew the cake; and, behold, it was
the first Twelfth Cake, sugared at the top,
and bearing three images of Faith, Hope,
and Charity. Now this cake, shewn in
the window, came to the King's ear; and
the King bought the cake, knighted the
baker, and married Dolly to his grand
falconer, to whom she proved a faithful
and loving wife, bearing him a baker's
dozen of lovely children.
MoDERN IMPRoveyſent.—We venerate
our Saxon forefathers; and yet, by their
own showing, they were a sad lot. VER-
stEGAN says, that in January wolves were
peculiarly dangerous to his contemporaries,
“for that through the extremity of cold
and snow these ravenous creatures could
not find other beasts sufficient to feed
upon." Other beasts! WEastEGAN, thou

RECREATIONS IN NATURAL
HISTORY.
MANY of Nature's mysteries
have hitherto baffled both the
theory of the speculators and the
vigilant research of the scientific
enquirer. Among them is the far-
famed Speaking Tree of Siam. At-
tention has recently been directed
to the subject in consequence of
the treaty which has been effected
between the KING or SIAM and
the QUEEN of ENGLAND, and pos-
sibly increased familiarity with
this strange product may add to
our information as to its nature.
At present all that we seem to
know is, that the Tree, in size and
form somewhat resembling a birch
tree, emits articulate sounds when
a person approaches it. The tone
is a monotone, but peculiarly dis-
tinct, and the words, which are
Siamese, are generally those of
derision and contempt. Thin legs
are a great reproach in Siam, and
a person coming to the tree will
almost certainly be saluted with
the exclamation “Yackery bolac,"
which is equivalent to “Now then,
skinny calves." The favourite
Siamese wish “Diblog bash je-
luckin,” “May your ears be
stretched,” is often heard from the
Speaking Tree. The voice was
thought to come from the leaves,
but the late King, Biscoth Whaum,
caused a tree to be stripped bare,
and the dreadful abuse it lavished
on the operators continued after
every leaf had been removed. He
also planted a grove of them near
the palace, but the trees quarrelled
so frightfully, and exchanged such
hideous threats, that they had to
be cut down. There is a small
specimen at the Horticultural Gar-
dens, at Chiswick, but it only
squeaks like a rat. It is however,
young.
Difficultirs on HAND.—The convict question may not be
more peculiarly urgent during the prevalence of cold easterly
winds; nevertheless we are then especially troubled with bad
chaps, and sometimes find it a hard matter to get rid of them.
AN INJURED INDIVIDUAL.
ToMkINs (who has missed his bird, but peppered Wilkins). “There, Now, I've A Dooced good MIND to say
THAT I'll Neveh come out Shooting with You Again—You'RE ALways GETTING IN THE WAY l')
Quitº NATURAL.-Naturalists, when they write, are in
the habit of recording such wonderful things, that one would
imagine they laboured under the idea that, instead of a
Natural History, they were writing a History for Naturals!
FASHIONABLE PROPHECY.
Cold weather frequently pre-
vails in 1857; during which the
obstinate fashion of bonnets worn
on the occiput gives rise to severe
pains in the female cranium, face,
and jaws: whence the off-head-
dress obtains the appellation of
The Neuralgia Bonnet. This,
being a hard name, is changed for
Tic Bonnet; and ultimately the
ridiculous bonnets which have
been so long worn without having
been worn out, are called Tics.
st. Notat.—St. NoHAH was a
poor girl, and came to England
to service. Sweet-tempered and
gentle, she seemed to love every
thing she spoke to. And she prayed
to St. PATRick that he would give
her a good gift that would Inake
her not proud but useful: and
St. PATRick, out of his own head,
taught St. NorAm how to boil a
tato. A sad thing, and to be
amented, that the secret has come
down to so few.
Mortal, Fort Manch.
THE winds of March sweep o'er
the plain,
And bid the dust to fly;
The hares in March becomeinsane:
“Avoid bad company."
The MAGIC of BEAUTY, -The
belief that any old woman has the
power of charming away warts is
a mere superstition. It is not im-
possible that the miracle could be
performed if the charmer were a
very enchanting young one.
EFFECT of HIGH WINDs.-Such
is the violence of the equinoctial
ales, that, during their preva-
ence, tiles very often become pro-
jectiles.
THE GARDEN.—A moist spring favours the development of
lants, and also of certain creatures of low organisation that
eed on plants. During wet weather, therefore, at this time of
the year, vegetation is, generally, at once brisk and sluggish.

RECREATIONS IN NATURAL
HISTORY.
The perils of the Whale Fishery are
among the most exciting of all narratives
of voyages. That the whale, a savage
and furious animal, when provoked will
dash his head against a ship, and some-
times sink her, is on frequent record.
The whalers are now well armed, in order
to meet this danger, and firearms are
resorted to whenever the whale attempts
to strike the vessel. CAPTAIN FRANCIS
W. LUBBock, an American captain, states
that having wounded a red whale with the
harpoon, the creature, having capsized
all the boats, prepared to charge the ship
from which his enemies had come. A brisk
discharge of rifles, however, deterred him,
and he went down. An hour later he
reappeared, with another whale of a more
gigantic size, and around whom he was
playing, evidently inciting him to attack
the ship. A carronade was run out, and as
the monster approached, a well-aimed can-
non-ball crushed into his skull, amid the
cheers of the brave Americans, and laid him
a floating corpse. But their cheers were
stopped by a tremendous flapping noise.
The first whale had dived, gone under the
ship, and while all were occupied on the
starboard, had actually boarded the vessel
on the larboard side, and was trying to
suck up the black cook. Pikes, cutlasses,
harpoons, all went to work, and the whale
was beaten off, but too late to save the poor
cook, whom sheer fright had converted
into a mass of blubber, of which we need
hardly say the unhesitating Yankees made
good merchandise.

MORAL FOR APRIL.
In April, showers fall, short and thick,
And hard and heavy, like the stick
Which, on the beat, policemen carry.
“Experience is salutary.”
CANCER is found in the stomach of the

st. Bºtsp.—St. BETsy was wedded to a

brought home tobacco; and the knight
smoked. But he thought that St. BETsy

fain that he should smoke out-of-doors;
nor taint with 'bacco-smoke the tapestry.
Whereupon the knight would seek his
garden, his orchard, and in any weather
smoke sub Jove. Now it chanced as the
knight smoked, St. Brtsy came to him
and said, “Mylord, pray ye, come into the
house.” And the knight went with ST.
BETsy, who took him into a newly-cedared
room, and said, “I ..". my lord, hence-
forth smoke here: for is it not a shame
that you who are the foundation and the
prop of your house should have no place to

BEtsy led him to a chair, and with her
own fingers filled him a pipe, and from that
time the knight sat in the cedar-chamber
and smoked his weed.

their age to be regarded as uncertain by
reason of a dislike to be considered of a
certain age.

ETIQUETTE FOR EVENING PARTIES.
BY OUR Own BRUMMELL.
If you are at all an absent-minded man, it is prudent not
to venture to a party in goloshes. Possibly you might forget
to take them off, and so be entering the room upon a question-
able footing.
In dressing for an evening party, always bear in mind the
maxim, “Ease before elegance." Many a good waltzer has
been forced into a wallflower through the tortures of having a
new pair of boots on. If you have strength of mind you will
avoid such a fate. even at the cost of appearing in your bluchers.

With respect to the much-vexed question of propriety in the
ractice of bringing your hat into the room with you, we think

than that you might tempt some ultrà fast yºung lady to put

phrase, “Maiden, wilt tread a measure with thy ToMkINs?”
(or whatever else your name may be) because we almost fear
it has become a little obsolete.
Should you be called upon to propose your entertainer's
health, and feel at all diffident about your eloquence, you had
better plainly state that you are no orator as BRUTUs was, but
that you have no objection to sing a song, if that will do as
well. And then for fear of your proposal being negatived,
you had better strike up at once the first thing that occurs to
you—say Bobbin' Around or the Ratcatcher's Daughter, either
of which would be nicely appropriate to the occasion.

In shooting the shafts of satire, be very

constant cry was bee's-wing. Now as he
sat tipsy in his arbour, a wasp dropt into

crowded, and with much ado the man was
saved. Now St. Becky nursed her hus:

him not. But she said these words, and
they reformed him: “My dear, take wine,

ETIQUETTE For EVENING

It is a point not yet decided whether, in
conversing with a girl you have not met
before, it be etiquette occasionally to use
the word “Miss.” We think ourselves it
sounds respectful to do so, but we cannot
state with certainty whether the practice
Las obtained at Almack's.
On going to a house where you have not
previously visited, and where your person
might perhaps not be immediately recog-
nised, it is usual before making your
entree to the drawing-room to hand the
footman your card and note of invitation,
which as proofs of your identity he will
carry to his mistress, and you may then
be assured of being smilingly received.

History.
The following anecdote is given upon
the authority of Sir Hutchnsas Pluxury,
of Ashborough, the celebrated hebetologist.
He states that a shepherd on his estate had
been for a long time in the habit of taking
his place, while watching his charge, at
the foot of a large old oak tree, in the hollow
of which was an owl. Between the man
and the bird a sort of friendship had struck
up, owing to his having chastised a boy
who attempted to take the poor owl's eggs
on a Sunday. The shepherd used to solace
his leisure with a pipe, and the owl, which
at first winked and hissed furiously at the
unwonted odour, grew rather to like the to-
bacco than not. Upon one occasion the man
lay at the foot of the tree for a longer time
than usual without smoking, and his
feathered friend began to hoot angrily.
“You may hoot,” said the peasant, “and
so may I, for I'm hooto' baccy.” He took
out a tract (a pleasing incident in the
story), and began to read, when plumpfell
first one, and then another, and then
allother little white parcel upon his paper.
Looking up, he saw the owl, winking with
both eyes, dropping another to him. The
arcels contained an ounce each of the best
ird's-eye tobacco, which the good owl,
attracted by its name, had stolen for him
from the village shop, in her noc
rounds.

RECREATIONS IN
NATURAL HISTORY.
The Bees in the Isle of France
(Mauritius) have long been cele-
brated for their size and beauty,
and their hum is so melodious,
that the young girls of the island
frequently keep a single bee in a
gauze cage for the sake of his
melody. In confin-ment they will
learn tunes from a musical box,
and M. DELAMoTTE mentions three
bees that could go through the
Bridesmaids' Chorus from Der
Freischütz with much exactness.
But this may be an exaggeration.
There is, however, no reason to
doubt the following statement,
namely, that a hive of bees, before
which its mistress, a lady of great
beauty, had frequently expressed
her hope that she should have a
plentiful supply of honey that year,
instinctively conceived the idea
of working double tides, by lamp-
light. The Isle of France abounds
with the most brilliant glow-
worms, and the bees sallied forth
one night, captured hundreds of
these animated diamonds, and
stuck them all about the hive, to
serve as lamps. Obtaining mate-
rials from the numerous night-
blossoming products of the Mau-
ritius Flora, the bees came home,
guided by this fairy illumination,
and MADAME DE L-'s honey,
that year, was extraordinary both
in quality and quantity.

HOW TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND.
THE following prescription is recom-

. Of Common Sense take 5 or 6 grains.
Of Conscience , 1 or 2 scruples.
Mix well together, and take it on the spot.
You must lose no time in making up your
mind, or else the volatile essence of the
above ingredients will evaporate, and the
effect of the prescription be materially
weakened. — N.B. If your mind is ex-
tremely weak, you had better take a grain
or two more of Common Sense. It will do
you no harm, only be careful you don't
catch cold after it.

move of fashion will be to hang our belles
with bells of a similar description, so that
pedestrians may be spared their present
danger of being run down by a lady booped

RECREATIONS IN NATURAL
HISTORY.
A Most interesting narrative was read
at the last meeting of the Aborigines Pro-

expedition of a missionary, from an
American dissenting college, to a tribe of
natives of whose existence its directors
had but lately become aware, and who are
settled in the south-east of Brazil. The
worthy missionary, BRothkB ERRY
Swunks, who is somewhat short-sighted,
and who had seen little of the world be.
yond the walls of "his college, made his
way from the nearest town, in the direc-
tion of , the settlement. After a long
journey he arrived there towards evening.
and found himself among the objects of
his teaching. He describes them as tall
and active, clothed in close-fitting skins
of hairy animals, and as speaking with
great rapidity a language unknown to him,
but resembling French, as in some degree
did the gestures and manners of the natives
themselves. He therefore addressed them
in French, and apparently was understood
as they evinced much delight, and dan
about the worthy man with gestures of
admiration. But when BRother Swux ks
began to distribute tracts, they snatched
them from him, and darting up to the very
top of the lofty trees around, tore the paper
into bits, and then descended to obtain
more. On his making signs that he was
thirsty, they all rushed up the trees again,
and overwhelmed him with showers of
cocoa-nuts. During the whole night they
would not allow him to sleep from their
incessant care of his welfare, one native
succeeding the other in turning him round,
patting his eyes, and stroking his hair.
When BaoTHER Swunks attempted to
caress the children, they bit him a good
deal, and the females snatched them from
him, and carried them up the trees. In
the morning BRother Swunks accident-
ally placed lis walking-stick to his
shoulder, gun-fashion, upon which the
whole tribe took fright, and departed, and
after two days the worthy brother returned
not ungratified with what he had done, yet
wishing he had been permitted to do Inore
among these poor heathens.

ETIQUETTE FOR EVENING
PARTIES.
Rzcollect, punctuality is the soul of
evening parties. Be careful therefore
always to arrive to a moment at the time
you are invited for. If the hour be not
specified, as is occasionally the case, it is
considered good breeding to call the day
before and make inquiry of the servant.
Your conduct in the supper-room must
depend on circumstances. If it be a half-
stand-up affair, ladies' ºusiness first and
gentlemen's pleasure .tterwards, you will
be expected during the first part to do duty
of course as an amateur waiter; when,
unless you practise well beforehand, you
will no doubt contrive to cover yourself
with jelly and confusion. But if the repast
be a sit-down-all-together one, you may eat
and drink in comfort, if you only take care
not to have a lady next you: otherwise of
course you'll have to minister to her wants
instead of satisfying your own.
In taking-your departure, don't forget to
make an offer of your thanks for the
pleasant evening you have spent: and if
you then proceed to shake hands all round
with such of the guests as may remain,
you will do much to confirm the favour-
able impression which your previous be-
haviour will doubtless have produced. In
fact if you act strictly in accordance with
the advice that we have given, you will
soon be esteemed quite an acquisition to
society; and in short, to use the language of
the advertisers, no evening party will be
thought complete without you.
Moral, Fon good Young Mr.N.—He that

they are your mercurial neighbours.

between the joists from the basement to the
roof there was nothing but honey-comb and

her husband in honey. Now some said it
was the bees, but more declared it was the
sweet temper of St. JENNY that had filled

CHRISTMAS IN THE WORKHOUSE.
W R. PUNCH,-"Possibly, for what I am about to observe, many of
***, your readers will set me down as a person of exceeding selfishness,
with both my eyes always, turned upon Number One. For that, Sir, I do
not care a single snowball. , You will print my letter, I shall be talked
abºut, and that is the grand thing. A dog with a tin-kettle tied to his
tail has, in my opinion, more than compensation for the inconvenience:
for with every, bang of the kettle, and every muscular spasm of his
tail, he has still a greater number of people to stare and shout at him.
“Mr. Punch, I am perfectly sick of the maudlin sympathy and
twaddle that call people men and brothers. It is all humbug, Sir.
There were two brothers at the beginning, and didn't one brother find
the other brother one brother too many? We shall never get on as we
ought to do, until we make every man, woman, and child, go upon their
own hook. i consider the inventiºn of poor-rates as a bit of howling cant;
and look upon the collector of that particular tax as very little better
than an unduly licensed ticket-of-leave. Let me explain, Mr. Punch.
“Thursday showed its honest Christmas-head once again to my great
satisfaction. For I am a person very well-to-do; can buy my own
Christmas Turkey; draw my own port; and, in a word, don't owe–
and don't intend to owe–any man the value of a Christmas chesnut.
Why, then, for the sake of a maudlin sympathy and cant as hollow as
a showman's drum, why should I be i. º my money, to feed and
jº. a lot of paupers, who are only poor and destitute, because they
have been idle, profligate, or unfortunate, which, be the case as it may,
in no manner ought to concern me?" Men and brothers may be very
well, in their way, but a man who begs ceases to be a man; and a
brother lying in a doorway, is, at the best only a shabby step-brother!
“Now, Sir, to return to that good old institution, Christmas Day. I
enjoyed myself, as I always do, Land I may confidently say it, charmed
and delighted a large circle, as I always do, on that day. Sweet is the
consciousness of ready-money; and a man who can lay his head upon
his banker's book, has the best right of all men to pleasant dreams.
rejoiced my heartiest, and slept my soundest.
“The Friday morning, brought me my morning paper. ...What was
my disgust to see a sickly sentimentality paraded in capital type as
follows—' CHRISTMAs DAY IN THE Workhouse !” I read that in
Marylebone the º rs had roast beef ‘without bone,’ and no end of
º t. Pancras, besides beef and pudding, Hanbury's
jeer, tobacco and snuff. In Fulham Union, fruit and nuts; in-but

why need I proceed? The columns of the newspaper steamed like an
alderman's kitchen; and that with Christmas dinners to Christmas
paupers
“Now, Sir, I have had my larder three times thoroughly .
fied. On the first occasion the burglars carried off the very respectab
remains of a cold, shoulder-of-mutton; on the second, a whole
partridge (forwarded to me by an anonymous admirer); and on the
third, #. model of a Swiss mouse-trap. Well, to what am I to
attribute these midnight atrocities, but to the pampered tastes of
paupers? These workhouse people are, from time to time, let out
upon society, and, with a full remembrance of their workhouse beef and
beer, with their appetites vitiated by morbid humanity and tobacco–
they will not starve quietly and decently, but—they burglaryfy my
larder! And when I spoke of the burglary to a policeman, casually
naming the lost mouse-trap, he said—“That's nothing to what it would
e: paupers let out of workhouses couldn't do without their glass of
unch, and I’d better keep a sharp look-out for my sugar-basin and
emon-squeezer.’
“Now, Sir, I have one remedy for all this. People who can't,
as I say, depend upon their own hook, ought not to be allowed to
hang upon other people's pockets. T would therefore, manfully
put down a morbid humanity, and at the same time, abolish the
poor's rates. To which end I would have clear work, made of all the
unions. I would have all the paupers seized and packed aboard shi
(we have plenty of them) previously condemned. The vessels should
be navigated into deep water (say the middle of the Atlantic) and there
and them with a firm hand, scuttled. (Of course, one sea-worthy vessel
should provide for the safety of the persons sent, upon duty.) Scuttled
is the word; and when, in fancy, I might behold ‘some strong Swim;
mer'—pauper I mean—“in his agony,' and at the same time, should
think how he had pulled at my pocket, I should of course complacently
I|| wonder how he liked it.
“Such a scuttling would be a fine, wholesome, corrective sight to
anybody who should have the luck to see it, and at the same time
would be a mortal blow to maudlin humanity. Such is my honest
opinion; and as for the howling cant of your “men and brothers, for

consider that you ought to
have printed the letter I
sent to you from the country
about the man who starved

written, and not the least
bit in the world too strong.”
You are much too fastidious,
and I can tell you that your
lady-readers would like you
a great deal better if you
ift"not affect to be so
dreadfully moderate and
just.” We do not, care
about moderation and jus-
tice,” and we like heart.”
There is a scolding for you,
because you, have suppres-
sed my nice letter. -
“I have heard nothing
but talk about the Income-
Tax for more than a week.
quite understand the
uestion, and . I wonder
that there can be two opinions about it." #. is most ridiculous to talk
of one person's being taxed more than another, if the incomes are
the same. A hundred sovereigns are (or is, which is it?') a hundred
sovereigns, and while }. receive them, that is your incolnº, and when
you do not receive them you cease to have that income.” So that
people ought to pay and not make a fuss. ...Besides, what meanness
it is in men to dispute about, such sums. What is sixteen pence to
a man who earns hundreds? Why Augustus gives eight pence apiece
for cigars, and by leaving off two of those he would pay sixteen pence
at once, not that the Government will get much, out of him, an idle
creature! And them, if sixteen pence in a hundred pounds” is such
a tax, why don't you work harder and earn a little more, and pay the
tax out of that P.I have no patience with such nonsense. But men
must have something to grumble and growl at. Presently you will
. that the QUEEN wears a gold crown, and will vote that she
ought to have an electrotype one."
There was a }.}i sensible thing said in the paper on Saturday
morning. º in his condescending Parliamentary way, dear old
thing, handed Mamma and me the Times, instead of hº it all break-
fast, saying, ‘I observe that a considerable portion of to-day's impression
is devoted to an analysis of the Christmas entertainments provided at
the metropolitan places of º: amusement; and as this may have an
interest for yourselves, my loves, which I am free to confess it does not
possess for me, I beg leave to lay the paper on the table.' But I have
to say that I did not read all the accounts of the pantomimes, because
hate to know what I am going to see,” and I did read one of the
political articles, and I was struck with a bit of advice which it gave to
men who are so dreadfully afraid that they shall not be rich enough to
support their wives and children. It was something like this, ‘Let a
§§ gentleman work a great deal harder than he does. It will not
him. And let him do without a great many things that he thinks
are necessaries but which are not.’
“I should think so., Bless me, look at the quantity of work that
Wºmen do, without making such a deal of complaint about it. Why
I hardly know a married woman with a family who is not on her legs
frºm morning to night, and when she sits down it is only to begin
stitching and mending, and making, and darning.” And at night do
you find her sinking into a chair in a lackadaiscal manner, mewing out
that, “the stretch upon her physical powers has been considerable,”
and sending everybody to bed that the room may be quiet, and hinting
that she must really have a little respite and fresh air? Not a bit of it:
and if her husband came in after she had had ever such a day, and told
her to put on her bonnet and come to the theatre, how long would she
be about it?" The fact is, my dear Mr. Punch, men ruin their consti.
tutions with smoking and Greenwich, and late hours, (not that being
}. late in º: is any harm *) and then they are not fit for
the business of life, and fancy that “the average demands upon their
physical powers are excessive.’ I have heard that rubbish, and it
means that you are a set of idle pigs.
The other hint about doing without a ſº many things that you
really do not want, was very good indeed. Now, there are tailors'
bills. A man must dress as a gentleman, or he would not be fit to go
out with his wife," but a married man cannot dress too plainly, and if
he takes care of his things he ought not to want many suits in a year.
Then, smokinghe ought to give up entirely, it is an acquired habit, and
ighly. pernicious. As for wine, there might be great saving there.
Men'like ‘their own wine, if and give wicked sums of money for it,
while ‘a light sherry, or something with as much flavour as camomile
tea, is good enough for their wives. How a husband can drink port
wine at five guineas a bin” or whatever it is, while his wife very i;
wants new furniture or some other necessary, is to me marvellous!
But if a husband retrenches his tailor and wine-merchant, and leaves
off tobacco, he may put away money enough to pay the Income Tax
without electrotyping the QUEEN’s crown, or making his wife ashamed
of his meanness. .
“‘Ought to enjoy himself?’, Of course, he ought. What does he
marry for, except because he thinks it will make Thim happier? But
let him enjoy himself rationally. If he saved his money in the way I
mention, he could keep a little Brougham for his wife, and they could
have drives together, if my lord would condescend to honour her with
his company. Let him come home, too, in the evening, as soon as his
work is done, and read a novel to her, or take her to the Opera (orders
are easily got, I know, if he is too mean to pay), or to a concert. Or
if they only walk up and down and look at the shops, it is better than
his sitting in the smoking-room of a club, º gin-slings and
hearing stories which can in no way, concern him, and only give him a
bad opinion of woman's nature, which would be perfect if you all did
not spoil it by flattering hypocrisy before marriage and rudeness and
neglect afterwards. If a husband led the life I have advised, he would
not come home complaining that the ‘demands on his physical powers
were excessive;’ indeed he would find new interest in his business
because there would be no other excitement to occupy his mind, and
#. say he would soon be rich, and able to take her” a country
Ouse.
“I hope that we shall hear no more nonsense about the Income-
Tax, but that men will make up their minds to work harder, and save
more. Of course a person who has to work for his living ought not to
pay like a person whose living is in the Bank, or has estates;” but
this is an easy matter of arithmetic, that might be settled in five
minutes, only you like better to grumble.

THE NEEDS OF THE CLERGY.
WE, have much pleasure in quoting, from the º the
following statement to the credit and renown of a British bishop:-
“EpiscoPAL LIBERALITY..—The Lord Bishop of GLoucestER AND BRistol, pro-
vided lodgings at his own expense, for every candidate for the recent ordination, and
directed that all their needs should be promptly and liberally supplied.”
No doubt the generous lº afforded the young parsons ample
means for drinking his good health. It would not surprise us to learn
that the supply f things needful included a sufficiency of good cigars.
There is, however, some reason to fear that the episcopal direction for
the su ply of all the needs of the reverend youths could not be quite
carried out. Perhaps a few of them may have wanted a little Hebrew
not to mention Greek and Latin, and a certain amount of theolo ical
literature, and ecclesiastical history, which any attempt to supply them
with would have proved abortive.

We have been charmed with the ingenuousness of a Plymouth

written, in the very brightest footlights; for it is not very often that
the anxious caterers for public amusement exhibit such touching truth-
fulness, such affecting sincerity as enhances the character of NEw-
CoMBE. His play-bill of December 17, 1856–(will not the document
be, henceforth precious, to all antiquarians?)-informs the Plymouth
public, that two young ladies will º act—no, not act, but a
-as Hamlet, Prince of Denmark and Ophelia. Mr. MANAGER º:
coMBE, however, has something to say, to premise to a confiding public
on this matter, and therefore prints the j notice in his É. :-
“45° MR. J. R. Newcombe begs to inform his Patrons that having entered into an

self equally bound to state to those Patrons who may be inclined to visit the Theatre
during such E ment, that they will be deceived, as he has been, if they expect
to see anything beyond the acting of two Ladies, who have a great deal to learn before
they are competent to sustain, with any credit, the characters they are attempting.”

cries—hold; ponder a little; think of it; the Hamlet may not be worth
eighteen-pence, and the Ophelia dear indeed at threepende. It is ruled
by the worldly wise that a man who vends fish ought to utter no
syllable that should cast a doubt upon its freshness. But here have
we in the conscientious NEwcoy RE a tradesman who, compelled to cry
his fish, nevertheless cries it with his nose between his fingers.

A CHRISTMAS-BOX FOR A GOOD CLOWN,
Of all the cases of benevolence ever recorded at this time of the
łº who can recollect one so truly seasonable as the following, related
y the Cheltenham Eraminerr-
“SixGULAR Testimon IAL To A Clown.—It may interest some of our readers to
learn the following:—Among the most prominent performers at HENGLER's Circus,
which has just closed at Chester, was Frowdf, the mimic. We feel much pleased
to hear that his conduct in private life has attracted as much honour and justice as
his mimicry in the ring, for having been noticed as a constant attendant on Church
Services, three Clergymen of that ancient city have presented him with a very
handsome Biblo.”
We ought to state that we quote the foregoing from a daily º T,
because there is a passage in it which we have accurately copied, º:
which may, by many readers be regarded as obscure; and we do not
know whether or not, the statement that Mr. FRowpe's conduct in
}. life, has, equally with his professional performances, attracted
onour and justice, occurs in the original text of our Cheltenham
contemporary. The paragraph in question has been rather incon-
siderately headed º Testimonial to a Clown.” If the testi-
monial is singular, at least it ought not to be. No doubt there are
some people, in whose dictionary fun means sin, and laughter is defined
to be the expression of wickedness, who may consider that a Clown, as
such, has no more business with a bible than a toad has with a side
pocket. This is the opinion of the natural melancholy fool, who hates
the artistic and lively fool. The real fool who grins with the convexit
of the mouth upwards to please himself, detests the fool who grins wit
the convexity of the mouth downwards to please other people. We
should like to know the names, of the three Chester clergymen, who
had the pluck, and the º to present a Clown with a bible. A
bible in the hands of a moral and conscientious Clown is nothing odd;
a bible in the hands of a Clown who keeps, those hands from picking
and stealing anything but stage turkeys and theatrical legs of mutton.
The bible is only out of place in the hands of that Clown who embezzles
trust-money, steals shares, and disposes of securities conſided to him,
singing psalms all the while, and who is a solemn, dull, and dreary
Clown, and a sad rogue.
RECIPES FOR A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
. You must do the following things, if you wish to pass a Happy New
ear:-
To count five hundred before you venture to contradict you wiſe.
To be careful, when you are asked for your advice, (especially by an
Irishman) how you give it. -- - - -
To praise every baby that is brought up to you for exhibition.
To take twice of pudding, if you are told the mistress of the house
has had a hand in the making of it. . . - - -

matrimonial quarrel. -
To mind your own business, or if you have no business, then to make
it your business to leave the business of others alone. - -
o be cautious how you sit next to a lady of an uncertain age with
green spectacles and inky fingers, and who shaves her hair to get up
an intellectual forehead. -
To pay no visits to such persons as never return them; viz., to Yoſif
Lawyer, your Pawnbroker, your Physician, your Magistrate, yºur Coºl:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 7
THE ENCORE SWINDLE.
MR., PUNCH cannot recognise more than a single view upon
the subject of an Encore. But his own preternatural wisdom and
rectitude—he admits the fact with due humiliation—sometimes, pre-
vent his making allowances for the ignorance and injustice of others.
He will therefore condescend, upon the present, occasion, to explain
how the matter in question stands. He is moved thereto by a variety
of correspondence which has been addressed to him, and by an article
in the Musical World, in which some ridiculous provincial censures
upon MR., SIMS REEVEs, the vocalist, are disposed of by a reply so
unanswerable that it has naturally, excited the wrath of the illógical.
For it is in imperfectly educated nature to begin to revile when it
ceases to reason.
Complaints were made, and what in the provinces, passes for
sarcasm was let fly against the singer we have named, for his excusing
himself, on the ground of indisposition, from fulfilling a certain .#.
ment... Now Mr. Punch has occasionally had his good-humoured }. e
with MR. REEVEs on this subject, and begs to premise that nothing
herein contained will bar Mr. Punch of his right to º; what he
likes to MR. REEVEs or anybody else. Nor, again, will Mr. Punch's
condescending to joke upon the subject, in *. prevent his
recognition of MR. REEVEs as one of the most admirable artists in the
world. Nunc tune, as VIRGIL might have said, if he had chosen.
The answer to these complaints is, that British audiences consist of
swindlers. It is shown that MR. REEyes, in common with many other
artists, is compelled by a dishonest British public to do double the
work which he contracts to do. It is set forth by extracts from the
newspapers, detailing a long provincial tour (during which MR. REEVEs
not once failed to appear when due) that the audiences have always
exacted from him º twice the quantity of music which the
were entitled to as º habitually encored everything. An
when an exhausted singer ventured to substitute something else
for the fatiguing air which is dishonestly redemanded, they have encored
the substitution. The consequence of this selfish injustice was that
REEVEs, lacking the courage of ALBONI and MARIO, who will seldom
“take” an encore, got knocked up, not being a mere singing machine,
and had to give his throat and lungs a few º holiday. This º;
out provincial censure and sarcasm, completely met, as it appears to Mr.
Punch and every honest person, by the Musical World.
By what right, we beg to ask, does an auditor cheat and rob an
artist by encoring P A playbill promises that if you will pay a specific
sum, you shall have a specific song. ...You pay the money 8. go in with
an order), and you demand twice the music you have bargained for:
Do you serve anybody else so, except an artist'? If you buy a pair of
trousers, and they please you, do you encore your trousers, that is,
require the tailor to give you another pair? Do you encore a dozen of
oysters, asking the second lot for nothing because the first were sweet
and succulent'. Do you encore a portrait, and, because, a painter has
succeeded admirably, in taking your likeness, do you clap and stamp
about his studio until he paints you another copy for nothing?.
But “O!” say JoHN BULL, and MRs. Bull, with their usual
vulgarity, “these are real things, with a value, while a song's nothing
but air (hair, very likely MRs. Buil, calls * coming out of a man's
mouth; and it has no value, and he ought to be very proud that we are
pleased with him.” - -
Get out of the theatre, you old idiots! Get out, you dishonest old
ignorant wretches, and go to MR. SPURGEON, or a police magistrate, or
iº, and learn your duty to your neighbour ! Get out, we
ell you!
And yet why should Mr. Punch be wrath with you? Your fathers
thought in the same way about books, and wondered at an author's
impudence in calling mere words, by the sacred name of property,
And the notion is not quite extinct yet. There, we retract, we feel
compassion for you, you old creatures, not anger. You may stay. But
mind this. You have no right to steal music. If your housemaid
stole your snub-nosed Patty’s dog's-eared copy of the Troubadour from
i."º. would call that housemaid a thief, and send for a
policeman. at are you, that steal four songs in one evening P Take
that hint to heart, and when next you are delighted with an effort that
it has cost an artist years of expensive and laborious study to bring to
the perfection that enchants you, and you feel disposed to cheat him out
of it again, remember snub-nosed PATTY and her dog's-eared music.
Were, Mr. Punch a Manager, he would borrow a hint from the omni.
bus, and write across the curtain
ALL ENCORES MUST BE PAID For,
and the money taker should go round, attended by a detective, to
require. a second payment of the price of admission. On the other
hand, if it could be shown that singers, or music-sellers, or friends with
orders, had caused the encore, (for all sorts of tricks are resorted to in
order to puff "| indifferent wares) the night's salary of the singer
supposed to be benefited should be forfeited to the General Theatrical
Fund. As Mr. Punch is not a Manager, he obligingly makes a present
of these suggestions to the editor of the Musica %orld.
SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
WISHING to obtain some information as to the effect of the Income-
ax upon our social condition, we resolved to ascertain as far as it was
practicable, whether any falling off had been noticeable this Christmas
in the parties which are annually given at that festive season. For
this purpose we selected several of our most going-out reporters, and
supplied them, with instructions, to spare themselves no expense in
white kids, and waistcoats, until they had provided us with full sta-
tistics on the subject.
As a sample of the evidence with which we have been furnished, we
learn from the gentleman to whom we had entrusted the dining-out
department that, of twenty dinner-parties he has been invited to, at
eight there have been served up for the first course both soup and fish,
at ten there was soup, only, and at two only fish; at nineteen the
second course consisted (besides entrements) of either a roast turkey
and a bit of boiled beef, or else a boiled turkey and a bit of roast beef
—the latter being in one instance supplanted by a saddle of mutton,
while for the third course, at all the twenty tables, there were either a
brage ºf pheasants or a hare, a Brobdignag plum pudding with a spri
of holly in it, about a peck of mince-pies, and bushels of jellies an
what he designates as “sweet-stuff.” The cheese was Stilton at sixtee
tables, and at the other four Cheddar: with the addition of celery in
eleven cases, and in thirteen of maccaroni; while at every house where
there were children, there were at least a dozen dishes for desert.
. On the whole our reporter's conviction is, decidedly, that the dinners
º this Christmas may be fairly quoted at about the usual average;
oth. as regards their frequency, and the quantity as well as quality of
condiments provided. And he considers, therefore, that among the
middle classes, the privations through war-prices are as yet not so
extreme as certain grumbling politicians seem desirous to make out.

TOO GENEROUS BY HALF.
IF money is at the present moment a little “tight” in France, it is
because Louis NAPOLEoN has held his purse-strings a little too loose.
He is a second Antony, and although his minister, M. AcHILLE Foul D,
has attempted to describe him in prose, we can assure France that it is
SHAKSPEARE, only—the divine WILLIAMs of M. PonsARD-who can
alone, through the lips of Cleopatra, limn the imperial munificence:
“For his bounty,
There was no winter in 't: an autumn 'twas,
That grew the more by reaping.”
Qnly France is, now and then, liable to less than average crops, and
a blighted vintage.
“In his livery
Walk'd crowns and coronets.”
For has not FREDERICK WILLIAM of Prussia just joined, fallen into,
the royal procession?
“Realms and islands were

deal too much Cayenne in them.
Christmas Contrition.

spend a great deal of money in decking her Christmas Tree, calls the
room at the German Fair, where they announce “150,000 toys at a
penny each,” her “locus penitentiae.”

man in a railway carriage, as it is sure to lead to high words.

THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.
It is well known—or why has the country so many newspapers?—
that immediately on the prorogation of Parliament, LoRD, PALMERSTON
quietly set himself to work to provide for the opening. The PREMIER
has already determined upon so many reforms that it may reasonably
be predicted the next session will be placid as the Serpentine. Hai.
cyons are expected to breed upon the Thames in spite of any motion
made by, MR. DISRAELI. But amongst all the national benefits anti-
cipated during the recess by a provident PREMIER, the statesmanlike
move in the matter of the Income-Tax, will, probably, be the measure
that shall command the most universal admiration. We cannot say
that the whole of the QJFEN's Speech is, determined upon, but we
have the best authority for stating that the document will contain a
golden paragraph, of which we subjoin a faithful copy.
“The Conferences at Paris have been brought to the happiest conclusion. All
the purposes of a just and necessary war have been fully accomplished. And
acknowledging the zeal, the readiness, with which my faithful people responded to
the call made upon their pockets to carry out the issue of the contest, it affords me
heartfelt satisfaction to know that such measures of retrenchment have been deter-
mined upon consistently with the true dignity of Government, that from and after
the 5th of April next ensuing, the Income-Tax will cease and determine. The
discontinuance of so grievous, but made by circumstances, so necessary an impost,
is the best national monument that can be resolved upon in commemoration ..} the
struggle."

certainly fixes himself in the hearts ºf the people, inasmuch as he shows
himself so anxious as a Minister to keep himself out of their pockets.

LILLIPUTIAN LEGISLATION.
T the meeting to promote,
according to advertisement,
“Legislative prohibition of
Street Smoking,” held last
week in the spacious Wes-
try Hall of St. Pancras;
the fulminations were tre-
mendous, even when com:
pared with the oratorical
artillery with which the
assembled vestry usually
batter the walls of that re-
sonant edifice. Juvenile
street smoking was gravely
denounced, as the source
of a torrent of drunkenness,
crime, and Sabbath dese-
: cration, which will utterly

less it be , dammed, and

Income-Tax, Law and Ec-
clesiastical Reform ; Bol.
grad; Naples; Neufchâtel;
the Metropolitan Board o
Works; everyº". ques-
tion; every social improvement and national interest, sinks and falls
in the estimation of the British-anti-tobacco Society-for-promoting-
legislative-prohibition-of-juvenile-street-smoking, before the over-
whelming importance of preventing the peripatetic issue of tobacco-
smoke from under caps and out of round jackets. Poison, bankruptcy,
delirium (of all sorts besides tremens), suicide, and every other variety
of destruction and death being staked on this question, no other sub-
ject ought, in the estimation of the orators, to take precedence of the
uvenile street-smoking question at the approaching assemblage of Par-
iament. The Russian, Italian, and United States questions; every
sort of Reform, must wait. - -
And the solution of such trifles will have to wait for a considerable
time. If the great little-boy-street-smoking question be of primary
importance, must not an efficient baby-perambulator-prevention
measure, in justice to the pedestrian community of the Metropolis, be
H. upon the consideration of Parliament?. Are there not a hun;
ed other evils that cry out in our streets for removal—a hundred
ºttongued nuisances proclaiming a deadly necessity for abate-

Should the St. Pancras Society for the putting out the pipes of the
º lieges, succeed in their object, an industrious Parliament
may, before the less important, subjects already enumerated, are dis-
osed of, adorn the statute book with several measures equally bene-
icial to the lives and welfare (moral and spiritual) of the British public
of all ages. This sort of Maine, law once turned full on in such a
direction, they may hope to find their own and other sympathetic
efforts crowned with such additions to our legislative code as the
following:—
I. An Art for the suppression of street hoops—Amy, juvenile of
either sex trundling a hoop in any public thoroughfare, to be liable, on
conviction, to a penalty of twenty shillings or one month's imprison-
ment, And whereas the traffic of large towns having been much
impeded by the immoderate breadth of ladies’ petticoats, any lady

MAJESTY's Justices of the Peace, be fined in a sum not exceeding the

eiture of the obstructing hoop or hoops, in open Court.

VII. An Act, (applicable only to that part of HER MAJEsty's
dominions, called Scotland,) to constitute the use of the adjective
“English" in any bond, warrant, quittance, or obligation, newspaper,

VIII. An ºrt to render it a misdemeanour punishable by imprison-
ment with hard labour to strew the streets º orange-peel.
IX. An Act for the transportation beyond seas of bill-stickers, bill-
deliverers, and vendors of spurious newspapers. Lastly,
X. An Act for the Annihilation of Parochial Spouting Societies.
OUR FILTH AND OUR FELONS.
LoRD PAIMERSTON once, with that off-hand felicity,
Which belongs to his lordship in stating a case,
To a new definition of “dirt" gave publicity,
As “nothing but matter left in the wrong place.”
The notion took root; for the festering matter
That |. our houses, in village and town,
Would be food, we all know, could we find means to scatter,
Its streams o'er the garden, the field and the down.
Nor alone to material filth of our cities
His lordship's idea exactly applies,
We have moral filth too; in our Commons’ Committees,
Our papers, our prisons, laid bare to our eyes.
As our sewers with town-refuse, our gaols are o'erflowing
With refuse harmanity's festering slime,
And as that's only used plague .# fever for sowing,
So this bears fruit only, of outrage and crime.
But as sanitary doctors are ceaseless in urging,
'Tis but waste of good stuff to send sewage to sea,
So the worst way humanity’s cesspools of purging,
Is to ship off the filth, as the way used to be.
As our fields craye the one, we have tracts crave the others,
Where e'en felon-labour with use ". be tried :
Fever-seeds may turn food; why not felons prove brothers
When once (selon PAM) in the right place applied ?
VERY LOW CHURCH INDEED.
ONLY think, my dear ARCHDEAcon HALE, of the following state-
ment made by the Berlin correspondent of the Times:–
“There are livings that bring in little more than £45 a-year in money, while the
most lucrative office of a general superintendent will hardly bring in moro than
42750 to £800 per annum.”
He is writing, my dear and reverend Sir, of the Church of Prussia.
It is not easy, is it, to conceive the idea of a Low Church carried so
far; to imagine a Church of so awfully low, a figure P Fancy an
ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY receiving less than a thousand a year !
The Church in that case would be so low that a gentleman could not
stoop to live in it—could he? No wonder, then, that the above-
quoted writer should go on to remark that—
“With such small fº. remuneration, and in the absence of any factitious
prestige in society or high political rank for the º it is almost superfluous to
mention that the Prussian nobility never enter the Church; there is no chance for
any other qualities than learning, piety, zeal, and capacity to get on in the eccle-
siastical career."
It is all very well to talk of the learning, piety, and zeal, which a
... of Church economy, quotable at figures so disgustingly low as
the foregoing, may encourage; but, how can the divinity of clergy-
men, who cost so little as the Prussian, be good for anything P. How
is it possible for them to drink, the necessary port P. The Prussian
clergy must be limited to beer, like Parsons Adams and Trulliber, and,
in further similarity to the last-named divine, perhaps have to eke out
their incomes by dealing in pigs. Speaking as a moderate pluralist,
ow many livings ought a man to enjºy, that is, to hold with any º:
ment of existence, passing no richer than forty-five pounds a living
An Old Saw and a Modern Instance.
ON the day succeeding Christmas Day there occurred a º
illustration of the popular saying relative to the “thin end of the
wedge.” Several little boys received a wedge of cold plum-pudding;
and when they had got the thin end of the wedge in, it was astonishing
to see how soon the rest followed it.

FRANCE TO NAPLES.
WE are enabled by the means of an ubiquitous corre-
spondent to give a copy—the only one in existence—of the
letter of congratulation written by Louis NAPOLEON to
the KING OF NAPLEs:—
“MY DEAR Cousin AND BROTHER,
“In obedience to the wishes of His Holiness
ThE PoPE, our common spiritual father, no less than to the
promptings of my own fraternal heart, I hasten to offer you
my congratulations on your escape from an attempt that
had it disastrously succeeded, would have caused univers
sorrow to every legitimate sovereign in Europe, and despair
and consternation to the Two Sicilies in particular. Having
happily escaped, I ought Fº further to congratulate
you that the attempt has been made; and for this reason,
as it is the destiny of all Sovereigns and Fathers of their
People to excite against them, once or twice,, the sacri.
legious spirit of impious men, so is it well when the attempt
—foiled and defeated—is well over. Has not our dear
brother, FRANCIs Joseph of Austria, had his little escapade;
have not I encountered the like risk? It is the fate of the
purple. But I feel a lively conviction that you are now
insured for a long and F. life.
“Of course the diplomatic relations that have cooled
between us could in no way lessen my admiration for you
as a sovereign, and the respect I entertain for you as a
man. Indeed, I know not whether the removal of my
ambassador from your court has not considerably strength-
ened your position as an absolute monarch. For have I
not induced England firmly and resolutely to join with me
in doing nothing?, England is, at least, in a ridiculous
osition, and is not that something? And trust me, my
aith in your discriminating character always led me to
believe that you would think me incapable of seriously
breaking with you. For how can I, as the
Cayenne, presume to meddle with the discip
may think best for }''. royal gaols? .
“You will then, I trust, believe me in all affection,
“Your faithful Cousin and Brother,
“Louis NAPOLEoN.
“P.S. Is it true-I hope not—that an attempt has been
made to convey to the relatives, of the impious O a
certain sum of money, previously offered by some wicked
Englishman to the survivors of any one who would attempt
MILANo's work? But this comes of the English press.

WHENEVER a foreign journalist is at a loss for a little
paragraph to fill up a corner, he instantly, announces some
new tax as having been imposed upon the Jews or Poles
in Russia. We do not know, therefore, whether the
statement that a tax has just been levied by the Russian
authorities upon, the wax-lights used in worship at the
Jewish Sabbath be a truth, or, only a º
pedient. But if true, the addition that the tax so raised
is to be applied in support of Jewish Schools, is somewhat
extenuatory. We t the same process might be applied
to our Puseyites. Let them have their church candles,
but under a tolerably heavy tax, to..be devoted to the
support of schools where children will learn reasons for
laughing at mummeries,
The “Resolute" and the Irresolute.

America. She intends sending over to the EMPEROR

MACBETH AT ASTLEY’S.
“And Duncan's horses (a thing most strange and cortain),
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience—”
MURMURING those well-remembered lines, we entered the theatre;
and over against the immemorial sawdust of our childhood, which was,
and is, and we hope will continue to be, ever sweet and f t, took
our seat in our box, fully prepared to enjoy MR. CookE’s “equestrian
illustrations” of Macbeth. #. play had begun some little time, and
the witches had vanished, which was a disappointment, in that we had
no positive means of knowing whether they did so on horseback; but
if they did not, they ought to have done... To have seen them
careering , wildly up a precipitous and well saw-dusted platform
with cloud º and so “into the air” which the band was then
playing, would have been a tremendous “effect; ” and with the
addition of a spoonful of red fire, altogether weird and terrible—but
this by the way. And there we saw General Macbeth, looking very
smart, and brave, and warlike in his new ring'd shirt, accompanied b
General Banquo in a crimson cloak of somewhat faded splendour, whic
had evidently once belonged to Count Almaviva; but he looked bravel
too; and it was very pleasant to see them riding over the “blaste
heath,” and making no more fuss about it than if it had been that of
Hampstead. Then followed closely six warriors in waterproof º
...}. in buttons, mounted upon an equal number of “ ; y
trained steeds”; and then twelve “supers” on foot, with their #.
scored all over with red tape—which, of course we knew to be the
Scottish army—and so the scene closed in.
In the next—and upon the announcement to Lady Macbeth of the
Ring's proposed visit—we began to speculate as to the probable
manner in which “Duncan's horses,” the “beauteous and swift,” would
—according to the text—be made to break their stalls, when the proper
time should arrive for their doing so. This being the “incident’ of
all others which we were quite sure must be the crowning “illustration.”
of the play. Duncan was coming, that was certain—as certain was it
that he would come on horseback, with “all the king's horses and all
the king's men,” and a gallant cavalcade of Thanes, and knights in
fº caparison, and banners, and trumpeters, and all the rest of it.
hat we should have the horses, therefore, was settled. Any doubt at
all about it, however, was soon cleared up-in the yery next scene
indeed—by the arrival of the royal party, the royal “ }. himself
being under what we at first took to be a four-post bedstead, but which
was in reality a regal canopy, supported by four retainers in crimson
gaiters. If MR. CAMPBELI”s portrait of the “gracious Duncan” were
at all like the kingly º he must have been a very “gracious”
and affable old gentleman indeed. His delivery of the line
“but he rides well,”
was capital, combining a fº. compliment to MR. Holloway's
horsemanship, and an excellent point with reference to the speciality
of the theatre.
The next scene was that wherein Macbeth and his wife arrange the
preliminaries of MR. CAMPBELL’s murder; and our thoughts again
wandered to “Duncan's horses,” as the time was rapidly drawing near
when by rights they should be—to use a “hack” and therefore not
§§ inappropriate phrase—“out, on the loose.” We had a per;
fectly vivid notion of the way in which the late MR. DUCRow would
have ridden over the difficulty—a scene would have been interpolated
representing, in the first place, the Interior of the Stables in Macbeth's
Castle º what a line for the bill!). Duncan was at supper, Lady
Macbeth had just said so, what then more likely, that having finished
that cheerful meal, he should express a wish to his noble host to “just
É. round the stables.” a custom perfectly, in keeping with the rude
ashion of that warlike time; and so, by an ingenious device, we should
have seen the “minions of their race” each in, his respective stall,
“done up” for the night snug and comfortable; but here our reverie
was interrupted by the scene changing to
A COURT WITHIN THE CASTLE.
. Ahem!—we mentally ejaculated—no stables. Yes, to be sure—all
right! here we have the outside of them, opening quite properly into
the courtyard- but º: of Ducrow!) where were the double plat-
forms, down which, having “broke their stalls,” the infuriated steeds
would stamp and clatter. with grooms and horseboys wildly hanging
on in every sort of struggling attitude—now dragging them one way,
now backing them another, and in short going through all that vigorous
pantomime which everybody who has seen Maz knows perfectly
well is the proper way of managing wild horses? But where were the
horses *-the time was fully up-the storm was at its height, the sheet-
iron was rumbled, the lightning was flashed, the murder was com-
mitted, Macbeth had left the stage and was washing his hands, Macduff
had arrived, and was making noise enough, not only to wake up the
house, but to rouse the neighbourhood, an the while “Duncan's
horses” were patiently waiting underneath the stage to be mounted by
the English cavalry in the last act; and no more thinking about
breaking loose than of eating one another.
To speak truly, we were a little disappointed; we felt that M.R.
CookE . made the most of his materials: i
he gave us rather too much SHAKSPEARE, and not enough Cooke; and
letter-press, and more “equestrian illustrations.” For example, in the
scene of Banquo's murder; at the line—
“His horses go about—"
how good it would have been to have seen them literally, going
about, and over a bridge at the back of the stage, or zigzagging up
the mountains; whilst Banquo walks across the front, in Count Alma-
viva's cloak. And why (in the name of all that is hippodramatic) did
not the messenger who announces the coming of Birnain Wood, gallop
in on horseback? and so give Macbeth “the office” to drag him o
_*—-
r
bodily—which would have been something like a “situation.” And
again, when Macbeth says–
“Send out more a-hor-r-ses,”
what a famous opportunity for displaying the “numerous stud,” and
“stupendous resources of the establishment”—an opportunity worth
any amount of posters and advertisements, and nothing to come of it!
So following up our previous thought, we, too, say with Macbeth-
“more horses.”
But the last scene of all, was very thrilling, and in every way a
; in other words, that
that his new edition of the tragedy would be all the better for less -

on the “Fº side” was tapped under the knees till he fell down

he has succeeded in inventing a “Potato EYE SNUFF,” which he
guarantees will effectually cure the ophthalmic esculent.

COMPARATIVES ARE ODIOUS.
EveRY student of his LINDLEY MURRAY is, or should be,'well aware
that very many of the comparatives in the lish lan eare in their
formation as irre as the trains upon the Eastern Counties railway.
The addition of “er” is the general rule, but to this, as to every rule,
there are plenty of exceptions. For instance, it is more correct to use
the prefix “more” in this case, than to say “correcter;” and nowhere,
we imagine, except, perhaps in the examination papers of a candidate
for a º, Service clerkship, could we ever come across such a word as
OOder.
here are, however, several other ways of forming our comparatives
than those with which our grammars have as yet made us acquainted.
The word “more,” for instance, is by no means the only intensifying
prefix which is used for the purpose; but of a dozen others we º:
for illustration, the familiar, one of ‘ jolly. Thus, when we speak of
an acquaintance being “jolly drunk,” the first of these two adjectives
becomes a prefix of intensity, and denotes a something more than
merely pºsitive state of tipsiness. In some cases, too, the entire word
is merged, and another substituted; as, for example, when we wish to
describe a man as being something more than a positive nuisance, we
are necessarily driven to write him down a NEWIEGATE. It is how-
ever, quite, impossible to assign any reason or rule for these irregu-
larities. For example, a comparative most closely akin in meaning to
that which we last instanced, is one of the most ré and legitimate
formation, as may be shown at once by putting it thus:–
Positive . . . . Spoon,
Comparative. . . . Spooner!
CLUB FARE.
THE rate at which officials are paid at our principal Clubs is gene-
rally upon the following discriminating scale:–
The Cook receives from £800 to £1000 a-year
The Librarian r x 100 m, 150 ,,
The Secretary -- 250 , , 300 , ,
The above scale fully proves the superior value of Physical Food
over Intellectuall
And in addition to his £800 or £1000 a-year, the Cook (an elegant
French or Italian gentleman, in the cleanest of cotton nightcaps) has
the privilege of iš. pupils, and .."; ” other cooks, to say
nothing of innumerable other perquisites and douceurs.
Neither the Librarian nor the . enjoys similar privileges.
They must be always on the premises, ready at a moment’s grumble,
to listen to the complaint of any over-pampered member. To take in
a pupil would be as much as the eyes of either would be worth. To
eke out their income in any respectable way, would be voted by the
Committee a stain of dishonour such as no fuller's earth, save instant
dismissal, could possibly remove!
We wonder that, in their, leisure moments, the Secretary and the
Librarian do not occasionally descend to the kitchen, and take a few
turns at the spit, so that when the Cook has made his fortune and
retired to his château Margaur or Lafitte, they, might be duly qualified
to take his place and salary?

go round the stables,” a custom perfectly in keeping with the rude

“And Danzan's horses (a thing most strange and certain),

MTRYTHING those well-remembered lines, we entered the theatre;
and º: the immemorial sawdust of our childhood, which was,
and is, we hope will continue to be, ever sweet and fragrant, took
our seat in ºur bºx, fully prepared to enjoy MB. CookE’s “equestrian
illustrations” of Macbeth. #". had begun some little time, and
the witches had vanished, which was a disappointment, in that we had
no positive means of knowing whether they did so on horseback; but
if they did nºt, they ought to have done. To have seen them
careering, wildly up a precipitous and well saw-dusted, platfºrm
with cloud facings, and so “into the air” which the band was then
#. would have been a tremendous “effect; ” and with the
dition of a spoonful of red fire, altogether weird and terrible—but
this by the way. And there we saw General Macbeth, looking very
smart, and brave, and warlike in his new ring'd shirt, accompanied b
General Banquo in a crimson cloak of somewhat faded splendour, whic
had evidently once belonged to Count Almarira; but he looked bravely
too; and it was very pleasant to see them riding over the “blasted
heath,” and making no more fuss about it than if it had been that of"
Hampstead. Then followed closely six warriors in waterproof le
smothered in buttons, mounted upon an equal number of “. * y
trained steeds”; and then twelve “supers” on foot, with their legs
scored all over with red tape—which of course we knew to be the
Scottish army—and so the scene closed in. |
In the next—and upon the announcement to Lady Macbeth of the
King's proposed visit—we began to speculate as to the probable
manner in which “Duncan's horses,” the “beauteous and swift,” would
to the text—be made to break their stalls, when the proper

time should arrive for their doing so. This being the
all others which we were quite sure must be
of the play. Duncan was coming, that was certain—as certain was it
that he would come on horseback, with “all the king's horses and all
the king's men,” and a gallant cavalcade of Thanes, and knights in
fº caparison, and banners, and trumpeters, and all the rest of it.
we should have the horses, therefore, was settled. Any doubt at
all, about it, however, was soon cleared up—in the yery next scene
indeed—by the arrival of the royal º the royal “ }. ” himself
being under what we at first took to be a four post bedstead, but which
was in reality a regal canopy, supported by four retainers in crimson
gaiters. If MR. CAMPBELL’s portrait of the “gracious Duncan” were
at all like the kingly original, he must have been a very “gracious.”
and affable old gentleman indeed. His delivery of the line
“but he rides well,”
was capital, combining a ful compliment to MR. Holloway's
horsemanship, and an excellent point with reference to the speciality
of the theatre.
The next scene was that wherein Macbeth and his wife arrange the
wandered to “Duncan's horses,” as the time was º drawing near
when by rights they should be—to use a “hack” and therefore not

have ridden over the difficulty—a scene would have been §§

forms, down which having “broke their stalls,” the infuriated stees
would stamp and clatter: with grooms and horseboys wildly hanging
on in every sort of º attitude—now dragging them one way,
now backing them another, and in short going through all that vigorous
pantomime which everybody who has seen Maz. knows perfectly
well is the proper way of managing wild horses? But where were the
horses?-the time was fully up—the storm was at its height, the sheet.
iron was rumbled, the lightning was flashed, the murder was com:
mitted, Macbeth had left the stage and was washing his hands, Macduff
had arrived, and was making noise enough, not only to wake up the
house, but to rouse the neighbourhood, and all the while “Dºesn's
horses” were patiently waiting underneath the stage to be mounted by
the English cavalry in the last act; and no more thinking about
breaking loose than of eating one another.
To speak truly, we were a little disappointed; we felt that Mr.
Cooke scarcely made the most of his materials; in other words, that
he gave us rather too much Shakspeake, and not enough Cook;
that his new edition of the tragedy would be all the better for less
letter-press, and more ‘equestrian illustrations.” For example, in the
scene of Banquo's murder; at the line—
“His horses go about—"
how good it would have been to have seen them literally going
about, and over a bridge at the back of the stage, or º:
the mountains; whilst Banquo walks acrºss the front, in Count tº

not the messenger who announces the º

“THE RESOLUTE.”
WELL, we have been invaded by JonATHAN, and all of us Englishers
taken prisoners. CAPTAIN HARTSTEIN and his jovial, t crew, have
carried away the best parts of the Britishers—their hearts. We have
struck to the generosity of the Stars and Stripes, and only pant with a

that destiny may yet have in store for us. The Resolute, a waif and
stray amidst, mountainous icebergs, rubbed and barked, and a little,
and not a little nipped, was picked up by American hands, carried into
an American port, and forthwith docked in an American dock, to be
returned by son JonATHAN to daddy John, as spick and span as when
she first turned her bows from her English home for Arctic seas. There
was fine music É.i. whilst the Resolute lay in that American dock.
Every blow of the shipwright's hammer struck anote of lasting peace
between the two countries. Yankee Doodle and God Save the Queen were
sounded by that harmonious iron. It would take very many of the brassy

AUSTRIA’S EAGLE AND GOOSE.
THE EMPEROR or AUSTRIA proposes to beatify Milan by arriving in
that city on the 9th January, and, in order that the enthusiasm of the
Milanese towards their foreign monarch may not be wanting, in out-
ward expression, a loyal demonstration of a peculiar kind is to be made
at the theatre. The Times' Paris Correspondent says that:—
“‘Orders have been given to the performers at the theatre of La Scala to prepare
to play VERDI's opera of Ernani, and to substitute for the words 'A Carlomagna sia
gloria e onor,’ the words “A Francisco Guiseppe, sia gloria e onor.' . The verse will be
destroyed by the change, but the Austrian authorities are no strict observers of the
rules of Italian poetry.”
This violation of prosody will only increase the aversion of Italians
to Austrian measures. A more, dangerous expression of sham loyalty
could hardly have been ventured on in a playhouse; where the audience
are privileged to express their disapprobation if they *::: that is,
are displeased with anything done, said, or sung on the stage. The
above-quoted infraction of metre is a certain goosetrap, though a trap
set to catch the opposite of goose. The barbarous line will be inevit.
ably hissed, and FRANCIsco Guiseppe will be placed in the unpleasant
predicament of doubt as to whether the hisses are intended for the
sentiment, or the solecism, or both, of the clumsy compliment which
he will receive from unwilling sycophants, at the dictation of asinine
flunkeys.
A New Year's Gift to Louis Napoleon.
It is said that a New Year's Gift, of the simplest kind, found its
way to the Tuileries on New Year's ilay directed to the EMPEROR. It
was no other than an apple pierced with an arrow: the arrow inscribed
From the Land of WILLIAM TELL to the late earile, logis NAporros.

STARVATION OF LOYAL MINDS.
THE Court Circular is very niggardly of the information with which
it supplies HER MAJESTY's subjects respecting the personal and private
acts of HER MAJESTY and her illustrious CoNsort. For instance, one
day last week, the whole of the intelligence, not merely public, relative
to the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT, was comprised in the two following
ºn-highly interesting and important, to be sure, but still two
only :-
“The Queen walked in the grounds adjoining the Castle this morning.
“His Roy Al HighNess PRINCE ALBERT, with the PRINce of WALEs, the PRINCE
#.Hºnors, and PRINCE EDw ARD or LEININGEN, skated on the ice in the Home

.# Windsor Castle on the day in question? The QUEEN, drank at
reakfast either tea or coffee, or chocolate, or cocoa, or something else
—but we are not informed which, or what. HER MAJESTY, of course,
exercised her mind as well as her body—why are we not told what
books, papers, or periodicals, she honoured with her perusal? The
omission is not only most important, but perhaps unjust, for it may

have withheld from publicity an enviable distinction very probably
conferred upon Punch.,,.
Why should the public appetite for knowledge ºil; the acts
of PRINCE, ALBERT be stinted to the information, that His Royal

Park? It is as likely as not that the Prince spent some portion of the

infantry, or an art-helmet for the cavalry. After skating on the ice he

; but a loyal º is not even acquainted
to the Castle to lunch or to dine, or partook of
refreshment on the spot. The illustrious Prince may possibly have
indulged in a cigar in the course of the day, but what the fact was, in
this momentous particular, is left to conjecture. It is not impossible
that the Prince honoured MoRPHEUs by taking a nap at some time
between breakfast and bed; but then to be sure we cannot expect the

otherwise, their Lordships' House is not what it is generally taken for.
There is, near Plymouth, a certain pleasant valley which has hitherto
been denominated Bickleigh Vale, but the name whereof is now likely
to undergo an alteration. Some propose to call it Duke's Place, for
a twofold reason; namely, because it has been engrossed and appro-
priated by a person, who, although a mere, baronet, has, in that pro-
ceeding, assimilated himself to certain Scotch Dukes; and also because
the baronet in question may be regarded as one of the Duke's Place
aristocracy. Others are of opinion that it might be more correctly
termed Houndsditch for a reason of a threefold nature; inasmuch as
Houndsditch and Duke's Place in London are localities alike peculiar,
whilst, the narrowest part of Bickleigh Wale is actually guarded b
several ferocious dogs, and, in the opinion of many, the man that jä
deprive his neighbours of their customary passage through his domain

ow the baronet who has appropriated and, engrossed Bickleigh
Vale, may, to render our argument the clearer, be called SIR Moses

SIR Moses has, according to the Plymouth Journal, closed Bickleigh
Vale by protecting its, entrance with a locked gate and a pugilistic
gamekeeper; besides the savage dogs abovementioned, which he has
placed within it. SIR Moses LEVI, by the account of our Plymouth
º: has also closed several paths, called church-paths, one
of which shortens the footway by two miles.

mark the swºllen ingratitude of a greasy, prosperous coll:

of them so well-to-do (and it would seem so willing to be
done) that, in their prosperous thanklessness, they would
not give a sixpence to lengthen the days of poor old Regis-

have three fingers, of fat on the ribs—whose nostrils are
ever dilated with the savoury smell of the fleshpots! MR.
GEESIN (a Middlesex HAMPIOEN) did not express himself
too strongly when he said he “was thoroughly and heartily
sickened at the liberal interest, which he considered the
most illiberal.” And we are told that even Doctor EPPs
followed in a similar withering strain. Even MR. Coppock
shed a bitter, burning tear on the occasion; solemnly
testifying to the impossibility of returning members free of
expense, especially members for Middlesex. . The last
election cost £4000, and it was impossible to fight it for
ess.
And so departed poor, neglected Registration. We owe
it, however, to Lord DeRºy to state that his lordship
sent to Jermyn Street, where the body lay, and in the
handsomest manner offered to pay the expenses of the
funeral. MR. DisrAELI also expressed himself ready to
deliver an oration, all from his own heart and head, over the
body, without borrowing a syllable from THIERs.

FRANCE TO NAPLES.
WE are enabled by the means of an ubiquitous corre-
spondent to give a copy—the only one in existence—of the
letter of congratulation written by Louis NAPOLEoN to
the KING OF NAPLES:-
“MY DEAR Cousin AND BROTHER,
“In obedience to the wishes of His Holiness
THE POPE, our common spiritual father, no less than to the
promptings of my own fraternal heart, I hasten to offer you
my, congratulations on your escape from an attempt that
had it disastrously succeeded, would have caused univers
sorrow to every legitimate sovereign in Europe, and despair
and consternation to the Two Sicilies in particular. Having
happily escaped, I ought Fº further to congratulate
you that the attempt has been made; and for this reason,
as it is the destiny of all, Sovereigns and Fathers of their
People to excite against them, once or twice, the sacri.
legious spirit of impious men, so is it well when the attempt
—foiled and defeated—is well over. Has not our dear
brother, FRANCIs Joseph of Austria, had his little escapade;
have not I encountered the like risk? It is the fate of the
purple. But I feel a lively conviction that you are now
insured for a long and prosperous life.
“Of course the diplomatic relations that have cooled
between us could in no way lessen my iration for you
as a sovereign, and the respect I entertain for you as a
man. Indeed, I know not whether the removal of my
ambassador from your court has not considerably strength-
ened your position as an absolute monarch. #. have I
not induced England firmly and resolutely to join with me
in doing nothing?, England is, at least, in a ridiculous
º and is not that something? And trust me, my
aith in your discriminating, character always led me to
believe that you would think me incapable of seriously
breaking with you. For how can I, as the proprietor of
Cayenne, presume to meddle with the discipline that you
may think best for your royal gaols? .
“You will then, I trust, believe me in all affection,
“Your faithful Cousin and Brother,
“Louis NAPOLEoN.

made to convey to the relatives, of the º: MILANo a
certain sum of money, previously offered by some wicked
Englishman to the survivors of any one who would attempt
MILANo's work? But this comes of the English press.

Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience—”
MURMURING those well-remembered lines, we entered the theatre;
and over ºf the immemorial sawdust of our childhood, which was,
and is, and we hope will continue to be, ever sweet and fragrant, took
our seat in our box, fully prepared to enjoy MR. Cooke's “equestrian
illustrations” of Macbeth. #. play had begun some little time, and
the witches had vanished, which was a disappointment
no positive means of knowing whether they did so on
if they did not, they ought to have done... To have seen them
careering, wildly up a precipitous and well, saw-dusted, platform
with cloud º; and so “into the air” which the band was then
º would have been a tremendous “effect;” and with the
addition of a spoonful of red fire, altogether weird and terrible—but
this by the way. And there we saw General Macbeth, looking very
in that we had
horseback ; but
smart, and brave, and warlike in his new ring'd shirt, accompanied b
General Banquo in a crimson cloak of somewhat faded splendour, whic
had evidently once belonged to Count Almaviva; but he looked bravel
too; and it was very pleasant to see them riding over the “blaste
heath,” and making no more fuss about it than if it had been that of
Hampstead. Then followed closely six warriors inwaterproof º
. in buttons, mounted upon an equal number of “. ; y
trained steeds”; and then twelve “supers” on foot, with their le
scored all over with red tape—which, of course we knew to be the
Scottish army—and so the scene closed in.
In the next—and upon the announcement to Lady Macbeth of the
King's proposed visit—we began to speculate as to the probable
manner in which “Duncan's horses,” the “beauteous and swift,” would
—according to the text—be made to break their stalls, when the proper
time should arrive for their doing so. This being the “incident” of
all others which we were quite sure must be the crowning “illustration”
of the play. Duncan was coming, that was certain—as certain was it
that he would come on horseback, with “all the king's horses and all
the king's men,” and a gallant cavalcade of Thanes, and knights in
rgeous caparison, and banners, and trumpeters, and all the rest of it.
§ we should have the horses, therefore, was settled. Any doubt at
all about it, however, was soon cleared up-in the yery next scene
indeed—by the arrival of the royal łº the royal “party” himself
being under what we at first took to be a four postbedste , but which
was in reality a regal canopy, supported by four retainers in crimson
gaiters. If $1. CAMPBELI”s portrait of the “gracious Duncan” were
at all like the kingly original, he must have been a very “gracious.”
and affable old gentleman indeed. His delivery of the line
“but he rides well,”
was capital, combining a graceful compliment to MR. Holloway's
horsemanship, and an excellent point with reference to the speciality
of the theatre.
The next scene was that wherein Macbeth and his wife arrange the
preliminaries of MR. CAMPBELL’s murder; and our thqughts again
wandered to “Duncan's horses,” as the time was rapidly drawing near
when by rights they should be—to use a “hack” and therefore not
altogether inappropriate phrase—“gut, on the loose.”. We a per-
fectly vivid notion of the way in which the late MR. DUCRow would
have ridden over the difficulty—a scene would have been interpolated
representing, in the first º the Interior of the Stables in Macbeth's
ºstle (and what a line for the bill!). Duncan was at supper, Lady
"eth had just said so, what then more likely, that having finished
that cheerful meal, he should express a wish to his noble host to “just
É. round the stables,” a custom perfectly in keeping with the rude
ashion of that warlike time; and so, by an ingenious device, we should
have seen the “minions of their race” each in his respective stall,
“done up” for the night snug and comfortable; but here our reverie
was interrupted by the scene changing to
A COURT WITHIN THE CASTLE.
Ahem!—we mentally ejaculated—no stables. Yes, to be sure-all
right! here we have the outside of them, opening quite properly into
the courtyard-but º of Ducrow!) where were the double plat-
|forms, down which, having “broke their stalls,” the infuriated steeds
would stamp and clatter, with grooms and horseboys wildly -
on in every sort of º: attitude—now dragging them one way,
now backing them another, and in short going through all that vigorous
pantomime which everybody who has seen Maz knows perfectly
well is the proper way of managing wild horses? But where were the
horses *-the time was fully up-the storm was at its height, the sheet-
iron was rumbled, the lightning was flashed, the murder was com-
mitted, Macbeth had left the stage and was washing his hands, Macduff
had arrived, and was making noise enough, not only to wake up the
house, but to rouse the neighbourhood, and all the while “Duncan's
horses” were patiently wº underneath the stage to be mounted by
the English cavalry in the last act; and no more thinking about
breaking loose than of eating one another.
To speak truly, we were a little disappointed; we felt that MR.
CookEscarcely made the most of his materials; in other words, that
he gave us rather too much SHAKspeARE, and not enough Cooke; and
that his new edition of the tragedy would be all the better for less
letter-press, and more “equestrian illustrations.” For example, in the
scene of Banquo's murder; at the line-
“His horses go about—"
how good it would have been to have seen them literally, going
about, and over a bridge, at the back of the stage, or zi ing up
the mountains; whilst Banquo walks across the front, in Count
viva's cloak. And why (in the name of all that is hippodramatic) did
not the messenger who announces the º of Birmain Wood, *
in on horseback? and so give Macbeth “the office” to drag him o
-
bodily—which would have been something like a “situation.” And
again, when Macbeth says–
“Send out more a-hor-r-ses,”
what a famous opportunity for º ſing the “numerous stud,” and
“stupendous resources of the establishment”—an opportunity worth
any amount of posters and advertisements, and nothing to come of it!
So following up our previous thought, we, too, say with Macbeth-
“more horses.”
But the last scene of all, was very thrilling, and in every way a

COMPARATIVES ARE ODIOUS.
EVERY student of his LINDLEY MURRAY is, or should be,'well aware
that very many of the comparatives in the English º: are in their
formation as irr as the trains upon the #. ounties railway.
The addition of “er” is the general rule, but to this, as to every rule,
there are plenty of exceptions. For instance, it is more correct to use
the prefix “more” in this case, than to say “correcter;” and nowhere,
we imagine, except, perhaps in the examination papers of a candidate
for a º, Service clerkship, could we ever come across such a word as
er.
here are, however, several other ways of forming our comparatives
than those with which our grammars have as yet made us acquainted.
The word “more,” for instance, is by no means the only intº
refix which is used for the purpose; but of a dozen others we select,
or illustration, the familia, one of jolly. Thus, when we speak of
an acquaintance being “jolly drunk,” the first of these two adjectives
becomes a prefix of intensity, and denotes a something more than
merely positive state of tipsiness. In some cases, too, the entire word
is merged, and another substituted; as, for example, when we wish to
describe a man as being something more than a positive nuisance, we
are necessarily driven to write him down a NEwnegATE. It is how-
ever, quite, impossible to assign any reason or rule for these irregu-
larities. For example, a comparative most closely akin in meaning to
that which we last instanced, is one of the most º and legitimate
formation, as may be shown at once by putting it thus

ear.
“THE RESOLUTE.”
WELL, we have been invaded by JonATHAN, and all of us Englishers
taken prisoners. CAPTAIN HARTSTEIN and his jovial, gallant crew, have
carried away the best parts of the Britishers—their hearts. We have
struck to the generosity of the Stars and Stripes, and only pant with a
feeling to avenge ourselves by the best and greatest act of gratitude
that destiny may yet have in store for us... The Resolute, a waif and
stray amidst, mountainous icebergs, rubbed and barked, and a little,
and not a little nipped, was picked up by American hands, carried into
an American port, and forthwith docked in an American dock, to be
returned by son JoNATHAN to daddy John, as spick and span as when
she first turned her bows from her English home for Arctic seas. There
was fine music going on whilst the Resolute lay in that American dock.
Every blow of the shipwright's hammer struck anote of lasting peace
between the two countries. Yankee Doodle and God Save the Queen were
sounded by that harmonious iron. It would take very many of the brassy
tongues of the MITCHELLs and the MEAGHERs—Irishmen melodiously
raucous with the wrongs of “the first flower” and “the first gem"
-to drown the recollection of those sweet sounds in the memory of
Englishmen. CAPTAIN TSTEIN, in his manly, sailor-like speech—
with the smack of the true salt in it—hoped that the old timber of the
Itesolute wºuld float for many a day. Sure we are that they will float
with, a still enduring strength, none the worse but all the better,
for, the bit, of timber grown on the soil of America, that may here
and there be found in her #. carcase. Sweet, and especially
fragrant the pitch that newly caulked her—pitch tapped from American
plmes.
CAPTAINHARTSTEIN has º and is now on the Atlantic. Our
regret is that he could not, have been brought face to face with all
England; that...every Englishman could not have had a grip of his
sailor-hand. This was not to be, but—we give the hint to j. ords of
the Admiralty—why not, as a further perpetuation of the memory of the
gallant fellow's mission, why not christenthe next English ship launched
– The Hartstein & Further, we know not whether we would not lengthen
the name of The Resolute into The Resolute Jonathan ; or, we are not

AUSTRIA’S EAGLE AND GOOSE.
THE EMPEROR or AUSTRIA proposes to beatify Milan by arriving in
that city on the 9th January, and, in order that the enthusiasm of the
Milanese towards their foreign monarch may not be wanting, in out-
ward expression, a loyal demonstration of a peculiar kind is to be made
at the theatre. The Times' Paris Correspondent says that:—
“Orders have been given to the performers at the theatre of La Scala to prepare
to play VERDI's opera of Ernani, and to substitute for the words “A Carlomagnosia
gloria e onor,’ the words “A Francisco Guiseppe sia gloria e onor.' . The verse will be
destroyed by the change, but the Austrian authorities are no strict observers of the
rules of Italian poetry.”
This violation of prosody will only increase the aversion of Italians
to Austrian measures. A more, dangerous expression of sham loyalty
could hardly have been ventured on in a playhouse; where the audience
are privileged to express their disapprobation if they please; that is,
are displeased with anything done, said, or sung on the stage. The
above-quoted infraction of metre is a certain goosetrap, though a trap
set to catch the opposite of goose. The barbarous line will be inevit.
ably hissed, and FRANCIsco GuiseppE will be placed in the unpleasant
predicament of doubt as to whether the hisses are intended for the

unkeys.
A New Year's Gift to Louis Napoleon.
It is said that a New Year's Gift, of the simplest kind, found its
way to the Tuileries on New Year's Day directed to the EMPEROR. It
was no other than an apple pierced with an arrow; the arrow inscribed
From the Land of WILLIAM TELL to the late erile, flotis NAporros.

STARVATION OF LOYAL MINDS.
THE Court Circular is very niggardly of the information with which
it supplies HER MAJESTY's subjects respecting the personal and private
acts of HER MAJESTY and her illustrious CoNso RT. For instance, one
day last week, the whole of the intelligence, not merely public, relative
to the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT, was comprised in §§ two following
º-highly interesting and important, to be sure, but still two
only :-
“The Queen walked in the grounds adjoining the Castle this morning.
“His Roy AL HIGHNess PRINCE ALBERT, with the PRINCE of WALEs, the PRINCE
#.Hºnors, and PRINCE EDWARD of LEININGEN, skated on the ice in the Home
Who can doubt that HER MAJESTY did a great many things of full
as much; if not more consequence, than walking in the grounds ad-
.# Windsor Castle on the day in question ? #. QUEEN drank at
reakfast either tea or coffee, or chocolate, or cocoa, or something else
—but we are not informed which, or what. HER MAJESTY, of course,
exercised her mind as well as her body—why are we not told what
books, papers, or periodicals, she honoured with her perusal? The
omission is not only most important, but perhaps unjust, for it may
port of any member who Mºtºy." London scoundrel may say
have withheld from publicity an enviable distinction very probably
conferred upon Punch.
Why should the public appetite for knowledge ºil; the acts
of PRINCE, ALBERT be stinted to the information, that His Royal
Highness skated with certain other Princes on the ice in the Home
Park? It is as likely as not that the Prince spent some portion of the
º in designing a military frock and trousers, or a new º for the
infantry, or an art-helmet for the cavalry. After skating on the ice he
doubtless felt hungry; but a loyal people is not even acquainted
whether he returned to the Castle to lunch or to dine, or partook of
refreshment on the spot. The illustrious Prince may, possibly have
indulged in a cigar in the course of the day, but what the fact was, in
this momentous particular, is left to conjecture. It is not impossible
that the Prince"honoured Morpheus by taking a nap at some time
between breakfast and bed; but then to be sure we cannot expect the
Court Circular to say that Prince Aisent was caught mapping.

TICKETS-OF-LEAVE TO RIDE.
THE new General Omnibus Company are issuing notes of their own,
which you are to buy at their office, and with which you may pay the
conductor for your ride. The chief utility of this new currency will lie
in its baffling the wickedness of the boy whom you send on a message
and who, if you give him sixpence to expedite his journey by riding, o
course spends the money in tarts, and tarries twice as long as if you
had sent him empty-handed. Several questions of law, however, will
arise upon these notes. If the omnibus breaks down, is that to be
equivalent to a bank breaking, and must you go to the courts of Bank-
i." and Chancery to recover your threepence, or may you instantl
take the conductor in execution? Are you entitled to discount if,
irritated beyond bearing at the sluggish pace of some of the Company’s
omnibuses, you jump out and take a cab Is there any law to
restrain the playfulness of the omnibus officials, and will the driver
be forbidden to inquire of the conductor, “ What’s inside, BILL,
Rags, or Browns?” meaning to ascertain whether the travellers pay
in notes or coin. Can the conductor insist on your stopping in the
mud, and writing your name and address on the back of your note?
How will §." ever convince old women, inside, that, a washing-bill,
or a turnpike ticket, or any other bit of paper that they may have in
their pockets is not as good as the Note, drat the feller's imperence?
But, finally, and this is important, if two passengers wish to get in
when there is only room for one, will not the conductor favour the
one who proffers coin, the Company having already got the other
party's money? ... Such are the com . dangers of disturbing
the . and even in the case of an omnibus, there are wheels
within wheels.
Perfection of Hospitality.
. It is now the custom, in the best circles, when invitations are issued
for Juvenile Parties, to enclose, with each note, a pretty little per-
fumed packet, directed “Mamma.” Nothing more is seen of it until
the day after ..". when the contents are exhibited in a little
syrup or marmalade, and the Family Apothecary is defrauded of a fee.
All juvenile-party givers should conform to this practice—evidently a

THE EXCLUSIVE OF BICKLEIGH WALE,
THE Bill for the admission of the Jews, into Parliament, annually
voted by the Commons and rejected by the Upper House, will, this
year, at length, in all probability, be agreed to by the Noble flords. If
otherwise, their Lordships' House is not what it is generally taken for.
There is, near *ś. a certain pleasant valley which has hitherto
been denominated Bickleigh Vale, but the name whereof is now likely
to undergo an alteration. Some propose to call it Duke's Place, for
a twofold reason; namely, because it has been engrossed and appro-
priated by a person, who, although a mere, baronet, has, in that pro-
ceeding, assimilated himself to certain Scotch Dukes; and also because
the baronet in question may be regarded as one of the Duke's Place
aristocracy. Others are of opinion that it might be more correctly
termed Houndsditch for a reason of a threefold nature; inasmuch as
Houndsditch and Duke's Place in London are localities alike peculiar,
whilst, the narrowest part of Bickleigh Vale is actually guarded by
several ferocious dogs, and, in the opinion of many, the man that would
deprive his neighbours of their customary passage through his domain
is justly denominated a hound. -
ow the baronet who has appropriated and, engrossed Bickleigh
Vale, may, to render our argument the clearer, be called SIR Moses
Levi. He is, in fact, SIR. Moses. LEVI, as regards that, argument.
SIR Moses has, according to the Plymouth Journal, closed Bickleigh
Vale by protecting its entrance with a locked gate and a pugilistic
gamekeeper; besides the savage dogs abovementioned, which he has
placed within it. SIR Moses LEVI, by the account of our Plymouth
contemporary, has also closed several paths, called church-paths, one
of which shortens the footway by two miles.
Whether SIR Moses LEVI has been won over to bacon, or continues
to repudiate ham-sandwich, we do not know... It is pretty clear that
he is no Christian. Even if we are tº take. Moses, in his case, as a
Christian name, his closure, of Bickleigh Vale, and the paths through
his other property, will plead irresistibly for the Jews in the House of
Lords. It will appear to that exclusive assembly a signal example of
the kindred exclusiveness which has been supposed to be inherent in
the Israelitish character. A fellow feeling will make the majority of
the Peers wondrous kind to the descendants of JACQB, The Scotch
Dukes, in particular, will be zealous in proclaiming their adhesion to
Hebrew Emancipation., Should SIR. Moses LEvi ever be created a
Peer of the realm by the title of BARON BICKLEIGH, or EARL of
Houndspitch, the Dukes and all the rest of the noble Lords will
receive him with open arms.
In the meantime the boys are shouting “Old Close!” after SIR
Moses, with obvious reference to his closure of Bickleigh Vale; for
which act, a Committee, appointed to consider the encrg ents of
SIR Moses on the public #: has reported that, by the advice of
MR. Collier, Q.C., an indictment had better be *:::::: against
Šin Mossi'evi. it is not at all improbable that the inhabitants ºf
Plymouth, Devonport, and Stonehouse will subscribe abundant funds
for the prosecution of Sir Moses for a nuisance, if that injury can
be called a mere nuisance which consists in, depriving the inhabitants
of three towns of a large portion of their “lungs.”

THRow ouT BUTTons IN A VERY INDISCRIMINATE MANNER.
OLD MR. WIGGLES TRIES HIS NEW SEwing MACHINE, AND FINDs HIs GARMENTs
A BOARD ON ITS BEAM ENDS.
THE local Board of Health at Rotherham, in the West
$ § Riding, has been labouring with more zeal than discretion
º in their sanitary operations, having spent upwards of
S. £40,000, incurred debts, become insolvent, and had their
works seized by their creditors, on whose mere will and
pleasure now depends the water supply, and nearly all
the drainage of the town. The venturous energy of the
board, as originally constituted, may be estimated from the
following statement:—
“The execution of the works was pressed on with vigour, and the
board required that private property should be simultaneously
drained into the public sewers. They were, indeed, so urgent on
this latter point, that they undertook to execute the private inage
through their own contractors for a very small per-centage above
the actual cost.”
This readiness to sacrifice themselves and their own
contractors for the public weal redounds greatly to the
credit of the Rotherham Board of Health; but how the
contractors relished the idea of being made use of as the
channels through which the drain was to be accom-
plished, may i. of doubt. If the contractors meant
were Indian-rubber tubes, that alters, the matter, and also
the marvel of their application to the specified º:
To these remarks we would add the suggestion, that if the
Rotherham Board of Health has been going too fast with
the drainage of their town, the error is less culpable and
less common than going too slow.
A very Ill Weed.
IT seems that if you desire to smoke—who does not?-
in a railway carriage in the north of England, the only
answer you need make to remonstrance is, “I’m a
Bowton Bleacher.” Porters, Guards, Station Masters, and
all other officials recoil at this announcement. A Bolton
Bleacher understands nothing, listens to nothing,...and
does as he pleases. Could anybody, oblige us with a
similar º for the South? We th ** com liment

WHO IS TO STAND IT P
THE Times opened the new year with an eloquent sermon on the
hollowness of outside show, with a pathetic appeal to the latent love
of truth and simplicity lurking, haply, in the British bosom. Let us–
cried our monitors—no longer be impostors to one another and to our;
selves. Let us appear in our naked truthfulness, and be not ashamed!
Let not £500 per annum puff, and strain and swell to seem as big as
£1000, and burst in the endeavour. Let us live life as a daily truth,
and not dress it "ş in flaunting fiction. The º the exhortation
was very noble. Well, will the women begin? Will they reform their
milliners' bills-will they collapse to something like the tangible
dimensions of “femininitie?” Seriously, º owe us something.
Seeing that all future milliners were even in the pips of that apple,
seeing that when Adam first put his teeth into that tremendous pippin,
he let loose upon futurity clouds of milliners—flocks of tailors, flocks
more multitudinous than flocks of northern wild geese-the women
ought to begin the work of retrenchment, and further ought to subside
into the span of a fair armfull
this º opening, of 1857? A woman is hooped with iron like a

she has not outer, supplementary ribs of steel, there are the osseous

bone: , And then to read the monthly manifesto issued to women—to
Englishwomen—from imperial France; and to reflect upon the haste
the ardour with which they hurry to obey the edict We are invade

husbands and fathers, who is to stand it
Let us glance at the afficie posted up in Vanity Fair for January.
Eyen as the Chinamen peruse the imperial edict, we read and tremble.
First, we are told that—"The casaque jupe is still the most fashionable
style.” That is, the process of inflation still continues, and feminine
balloons are still !'; the world. We come to shawls, about which
the daughters of Eve—think of Eve at the Fountain, and EVE, a
daughter of EVE, in a casaque-jupe, with circumvallations of steel and
whalebone about Taradise—are all of them amiably mad.
“The furor of the §: season is the long double shawls, in stripes of bright con-
trasting colours, with black or gold borders, and deep fringe the colour of the ground.”
Yet how is it with them?"How is it with the delicate, creatures at |f
Here is a shawl, orº to hide a multitude of vanities; a shawl, in
fact, crying loud, and fitly heralding a DALILAH; but, surely not a
shawl for our own gentle, timid MARY ANNE; nevertheless, MARY
ANNE will do her best, that she may obey the manifesto, and don the
stripes | - - - -
e new sortie de bal is enough to make even the sixpences shake in
the husband's pocket.
“We cite one of white cachmere, entirely covered with embroidery of floss silk, in
China rose, blue, and black, nized with gold and silver—the design and mixture of
colour displaying great novelty and elegance. . A fringe of the same colours, spotted
with gold and silver, surrounded this graceful cloak, which was made in large plaits,
forming sleeves, and descending in points in front. A small high collar, slightly
turned back, and fastened at the throat with two large gold buttons, from which hung
two long tassels of silk and gold, completed this elegant pardessus.”
Is not this a sortie de bal for QUEEN SHEBA, with the mines of
Ophir for her pin-money?, Nevertheless, MRs. RRows, MRs. JoSEs,
and Mrs. Robinson will have a d womanly struggle to achieve
something like a sortie. If the gold be not obtainable, they must
try pinchbeck. - - - -
W. end with the mantle–a mantle “trimmed with a rich medallion
ringe;” a mantle only to be worn by CLEOPATRA, with a regal mono-
poly of the pearl fisheries.
“Nothing can be more distingué and elegant than this º which resem-
bles rivers of pearis on the rich shades of ruby, purple, sapphire blue, or emerald
green. We have seen the same style of embroidery used with great effect on the
flounces of moire dresses.”
Rivers of pearls! Mines of diamonds will doubtless duly, come in
for the mantle of February. Again we ask—who is to stand it.: ...Are
we never again to see a compassable woman in the sweet simplicity of
white muslin? A woman whose figure defies steel, and who makes no
whalebones of herself
Tewkesbury and Glasgow.
MR. HuMPHREY BRowN is about to vacate Tewkesbury. When
may Glasgow count upon the same favour at the hands of MR.MAC-
GREGoR.? Or is it that Scotland is so fond of the term “British.” in
preference to “English,” that even a dirty tumble on a British Bank
makes a Glasgow member all the sweeter for his seat P

SHOP-HUNTING INTELLIGENCE.
THE sport of shop-hunting is now so extensively pursued by our fair
countrywomen, and occupies so large a share of female thought and
conversation, that we are annually more and more surprised to find no
notice taken of it publicly in print. Year after year, as the season for
shop-hunting again approaches, we regularly ransack our sporting con-
tºº. in the hope of finding promises to devote a weekly, corner
to the records of the sport. But editors, like men in general, seem
strangely selfish creatures; and although, we find them i.; Ino
end of information on all the subjects which have interest to themselves
and sportsmen generally, we never see them print a single syllable of
news #. of which our sportswomen can anyhow be benefited.
Through the medium of his Bell every fox-hunterand grouse-shooter may
acquaint himself beforehand with the prospects of the season, and
know exactly where the best sport is likely to be had. But the shop-
hunter has no such easy means of reference, and can only gain, her
information by her own eyes and ears, and, by those of her immediate
acquaintances and friends. Indeed, considering the number of ladies
who are addicted to the * and who would be certain to become
constant readers (paying their subscription of course out of the house:
keeping, under the unfathomable head of “sundries”), we think if
any one would only start a female sporting paper, it would be pretty
sure at once to have a fair circulation.
..We would suggest for its title either Belle's Life, or the Shera, in
distinction to º which is sometimes called the Hera. In the
meantime we shalſ endeavour, as we always do, to supply the want
ourselves; , and for the convenience of the shop-hunting sorority, we
hereby pledge ourselves, with that benevolence which invariably has
characterised us, to devote to them an inch or two of “valuable space”
whenever it so happens that we cannot better fill it.
A. the sport is followed with more or less avidity the whole
year round, the shop-hunting season may be said in London to com-
mence at the close of the sea-side one. . Every materfamilias on her
return, from, Margate, is pretty certain, to discover that she wants
a hundred things for her wardrobe, and her family's; and until the
hundred things are bought her only aim in life is to get them “bar-
gains.” For this she arranges a meet at a friend's house (for the
shop-hunters usually hunt in couples), and proceeds with her to hunt
through half the drapers' shops in London, until she manages to hunt
up what she is in want of.
In the ardour of the sport the shop-hunter is rarely affected by
WOL, XXXI.1. 10
fatigue, and after spending half the day in beating down Regent
Street, will often “try back” to Bloomsbury or Holborn, unless the cry
“Soho!” divert her course in that direction. Nor is she particular in
confining her pursuit to any special object: any more than is the
Cockney who #. to go out partridge-shooting, and then bangs
away at larks. The chace professedly of a bit of ribbon often leads to an
exciting run after a new H. and it is nouncommon thing, when she
goes out on a boa-hunt, for the shop-hunter to come home exceedingly
i. at having succeeded in bagging a “perfect duck” of a new
onnet.

subjects, and SIR GEORGE GREY exhibits evident signs of dyspepsia.
One day, he turns a confirmed ruffian loose on society, or reprieves an
unnatural murderess; on another, he hangs a boy of eighteen: for gui
facit per CALCRAFT facit perse. At one time he is DRAco; at another
Becca RIA, or even a mawkish sentimentalist. The Hoye Secretary's
last exhibition of that eccentricity which no doubt results from derange-
ment of the chylopoietic viscera, consisted in performing a frightfully
imperfect act of justice under the ridiculous denomination of an act of
mercy. He procures the QUEEN’s pardon for the poor fellow MARK-
HAM, convicted of forgery, and condemned to penal servitude by reason
of mistaken identity. -
In the meantime MARKHAM has been ruined and his wife and
children have been wellnigh starved. SIR GEORGE GREY would seem to
think that the QUEEN’s pardon will sufficiently compensate MARKHAM
for the horrible misery and affliction to which he and his have been
subjected by the blunder of one of the QUEEN’s assize courts. This is
one of those hallucinations which often attend disorder of the liver in
articular. It is usually removable by blue-pill: of which preparation
IR. GeoRGE GREY had better take some. #. will then, perhaps, see
the case of MARKHAM in its right light, and perceive that it is one of
the most atrocious, injustice and cruelty. Regarding it in this point of
view, the idea possibly occur to im that it would be desirable
to procure for the flºº. y wronged MARKHAM some amends rather
more satisfactory than the QUEEN’s º for having done nothing,
and having been punished for looking like somebody else. In addition
to the QUEEN’s pardon, perhaps, he will procure something like an
indemnification in the shape of a decent amount of the QUEEN’s coin.

O, TIs I has a ticket o' leave,
And where is the prig more free?

TOBACCO-STOPPERS.
THE fact that nothing so much weakens an argument as exaggeration
seems to have been overlooked completely by the speakers at a recent
public meeting, where, according to the Daily News:–
“The baffled efforts of the various institutions which have for their object the
elevation of the masses were traced to the prevalence of the habit of º: and
it was contended that all the efforts which philanthropists can devise cannot by
possibility stem the current of drunkenness, crime, and Sabbath desecration whic
º abounds, while the people of this country spend £8,000,000 a-year for
acco."
“Drunkenness, crime, and Sabbath desecration!”. This is rather a
wholehog sequitur to the use of pigtail. We should think the ºrators
must have studied the Rejected Addresses, and taken their line of
argument from the lines—
“Who makes the quartern loaf and Luddites rise?
“Who fills the butchers' shops with large blue flies?"
According to such reasoners, every social evil is a branch from the
#. stem: and we may next expect to hear that the *::::::: of the
ames has been traced to the filthy habit of tobacco-smoking, as well,
very likely, as the double Income-Tax. -
At the same meeting, too, a letter was produced from a certain DR.
Hodgkin, who stated his opinion that:-
“The use of tobacco is a violation of the courtesy of a Christian, and the good
manners of a gentleman. Let it be stigmatised as a vice, and placed, as it ought to
be, under the observation of the police.”
DR. Hodgkin's blow reminds us of KING JAMEs's Counterblast; and
indeed we can imagine that had policemen been invented in KING
JAMEs's time, that sapient monarch would have used them to #. his
subjects' pipes out. But we apprehend that now-a-days were a MAYNE
law introduced at Scotland yº to the effect suggested, it would be a
#. to SIR. Richard to prevent its being a dead letter. Indeed, we
oubt if there be any one policeman in the force who would submit to
be made a Tobacco-stopper.
We have every wish to commend any attempt that may be made to
purify the moral atmosphere of the country, but we do not think that
the prevention of Tobacco-smoke would do so much towards it as those
who take a merely bird’s-eye view of such things may beled to state.
There are other clouds which darken more than those from clay or
meerschaum; and we regret that DR. Hodgkin, and his co-Tobacco:
stoppers, should not shºw their zeal in º away, instead of
wasting it on that which they seem now so smoking hot against.

THE SERVANT'S WARNING.
IAM married to a wretch who beats and kicks me like a brute,
So that I’m all over bruises on my skin from head to foot.
Both my eyes is black, you see, my nose is flattened to my face.
Oh, that I was still a servant, and had never left my place |
There I used to have . wittles reg’lar, vegetables, meat,
Bread-and-butter, bread-and-cheese, as much as ever I could eat.
Tea, and toast, and milk, and sugar, plenty; lots of table-beer;
What besides can any woman want?"What fools we are, oh dear!
Now I’m that reduced by want my bones is nearly through my skin,
'Cause my drunken husband spends my due maintainance on his gin,
Then, wherein, if I was minded, I might feed until Ibust,
Now my meals is many a day a drop of water and a crust.
Makin' lººd washin' tea-things, plates, and dishes, then I
thoug
Qverwork and too hard labour; more to do than servants ought.
Which I often of my Missus used to grumble and complain, .
Now I sees how much more wiser 'twou’d have been for to remain.
Harder my oncertain livin' now I finds it is to earn
#. my washin' and a mangle, often nobody to turn.
Then a little extra cookin’ slavery I used to call;
Now Islaves and glad enough of anythink to cook at all.
How much trouble then I thought it sometimes havin' to attend
To the children, such as dress 'em, or put on their things, or
menol .
Little did I think to be with half-a-dozen of my own,
Not a mortial soul to help me, doin for 'em all alone.
What a stupe I was to listen to a suitior's flatterin' tales I
hich an appy ome has cost mºnsºme wages, keep, and wails;
Missus she was right in sayin', “You’ll repent your bargin, HANN.”
Spite of which I went and did it—marryin'the baker's man.
By my fate all maids take warnin', which I mean don't warnin' give,
In a hurry for to marry, comfortable where you live,
Far the wust of all bed-makin’—now you mark the words I say—
Is the sort of bed that I made, and º which I’ve got i. º
A MINISTER’s LECTURE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I’M sure you’re all bricks, regular bricks, I may say, and I
can see it in your good-looking faces. So here goes, without further
palaver, or what MR. Bob Lowe tells me they call in Tustralia, yabber-
yabber. You want to know ºf about Russia? Very good,
I’m the boy to tell it you. But what the deuce do you want to know
about Russia? That’s the point. If it’s much, you won’t get it from
me; for I ask you, in the mame of all that’s reasonable, how could I
learn much about it? ... You shall have all I know, and that’s the best
I can do for you. Is it a bargain, or will you sky a copper whether I
shall go on or shut up? I’m to go on? Then, on we goes, and OLD
NICK take the hindmost.
I went to Russia with LORD GRANVILLE, and a very good fellow he
is. I was sent because it was wished that members of the highest
classes only should appear at Moscow as the representatives of this
country. Well, you know, we spent a lot of tin, and astonished the
natives a little, I flatter myself. But, Lord bless you, call Russia a
country ! That old humbug, NAPIER, ought to have cut her root
ul y
and branch, smashed her tee-totally; yes, I assure you, if ; had
done his duty, he would utterly have flabberghasted her. Bless
my, soul, a country! Why, I’ve seen a good, many countries,
and ought to know, somet about foreign affairs, but the likes
of Russia I, never did see, at do you think? Their lan e
is so ridiculous that all decent people are ashamed of it, .#".
French instead...What’s a nation without a language? Qught she to
have a yoice in the European family?, Blow me tight, if she ought.
What do you say?, Well then, again, look at her capital, St. Peters.
burg. It may, well, be called a capital, for there’s precious little
interest about it. Ah! you don’t see that joke P Never mind, you’ll
see the next. St. Petersburg stands on the Neva, and I neever did see
such a place. Is that better? Bravo! On we goes again.
I am bound to say that I have seldom beheld such a lot of Guys as
came to the coronation with us. Guys of all nations. From France
now, came Count De MoRNY; you know what they say about him, and
whose relative he is, but that’s neither here nor there. A downy old
bird, I can tell you, and knows how to feather his nest. He brought a
lot of pictures with him, and as the Russians like the reputation of
vertu, and know as much of art as a cow knows of a pair of candle.
snuffers, I’ll take odds that our friend DE MoRNY drove his pigments
to a fine market. Then there was ESTERHAZY, but he’s a good cha
-my try is on good terms with his government just now—whic
fully accounts for the milk in the cocoa-nut. The inian cove was
also all right, for the same reason. But as for the fellow from Belgium,
you never in all your blessed life saw such a perverted hippopotamus.
e was too proud to look down when he sneezed, for fear §. his
shoes. And a lot of others, all highly ridiculous. There was a »
too, and though he was a #. picturesque looking individual, it was
impossible for a profound thinker to look at that man's toggery, and
not feel that the nation he represented must have lost her place in the
scale of nations and be on the high-road to tarnation smash.
As for Russian living, my dearly beloved bricks, I don’t know what I
can say to you. We had French cookery, of course, and all I know
about, what the common Russians eat is, that, it is very, beastly.
Travelling is great fun in Russia, because they take anybody's horses,
stick anybody on for a postilion, and kill him if he don’t go fast
enough for your liking. I never enjoyed travelling so much in all my
life. You may like to know something about the constitution of Russia
—well, she hasn't got one. The Emperor makes, the laws, and the
º are well licked if they don't obey them. What the laws are, I
on't pretend to know, but I should say they were rum ones ſº
from the look of the people. As for their religion, I fear they ave
none, in the sense in which you and I have it, but they are always
knocking their nobs on the pavement in honour of some saint or
another, and they burn lamps before the images, and some sacrilegious
rascals are wicked enough to drink the oil when no one is loo Ing.
Those are the principal doctrines of their faith, into which, of course,
I made it my business to inquire º, for f think that unless a
chap is religious it is all dickey with him.
Well, I don’t know that I have much more to say. I bought a lot
of turquoises over there. Don’t think I’m touting to sell any of them
to you; quite the reverse; I’ve left them in London. As for taking
out articles to Russia to sell, like DE MoRNY, I wouldn’t be guilty of
such a meanness, making myself a mere commercial gent. By the way,
that thundering old humbug NAPIER called GRAND DUKE CoNSTAN-
TINE a frank and open-hearted sailor. Soft sawder. The DUKE's as
artful a card as you’ll meet, and thinks more of francs than frankness.
But NAPIER is an awful old humbug... I assure you, once more, that
if he had chosen, he could have taken Cronstadt as easily as I take this
pinch of snuff. He wanted no gun-boats, nor men, nor nothing, except
one thing, and that was pluck, I looked at the place myself, and I
know all about it. He might have taken it with six ships only, as
ADMIRAL VERNON took Portobello, near Edinburgh. -
I suppose I had better shut up, and I am much obliged for your
attention, and I hope I have entertained as well as instructed you. It
is the wish of my Ministry, I mean LoRD PALMERSTON's, that we
should be as affable as possible, and that we should do all in our power
to remove the conviction that he is the only Minister, and we are all
flºº. I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are nothing of
the kind, and I trust that the moral effect of my lecture to-night will
be considerable. I will now, with your polite permission, hook it.
Au reservoir/
Fun at St. Barnabas'.
A TERRIBLE wag of a Puseyite indulges in the following mild bit of
Christmas facetiousness. He says that “The foot of St. Peter's at
Rome, is the most perfect illustration of mistletoe in the world, for
one of the saintly toes has been so regularly kissed away that it has
mizzled in toto.”

THE subjoined despatches have been received from LIEUT.-GENERAL
ToMNoDDINGTON. They will, no doubt, be read with considerable
interest.
“My LoRD, “Greenwich, Lecture Hall, Jan. 7.
“I took up my position here last night, having made very
easy approaches to the town, in no way harassed by the enemy, who,
I am bound to º has hitherto behaved with the greatest courtesy,
inasmuch as he has scarcely shown himself. His position does not
appear very strong. . He has worked at certain zig-zags, but hitherto
has made no attempt to shell-out...It is my conviction that his total
inability to effect this operation will cause him very soon to evacuate
the place with his cab behind him.
“My position commands, the Hospital, which I can attack either, by
a flank-movement or by scaling the principal staircase. I have made a

position excellent. held it with my staff for more than four hours,
and then retired under rather a heavy fire of grape, in excellent order.
The Whitebait Battery will be unmasked to-morrow, and I expect
when duly served, will play with considerable effect upon the wavering
disposition of the burgesses.
“In the course of anºther week, I trust to be able to have at least
one other movement to report to you. For it is my unalterable reso-

SIR ROBERT PEEL'S DESCENT ON MOSCOW
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER (friend and, as he hopes, fellow-exhibitor
of SIR. Robert PEEL) presents his compliments to all Committees,
Principals, Secretaries, and that Sort of Thing, of all Saloons, Music-
halls, Institutions, and So Forth, and begs to inform 'em that he is
about to offer an Engagement to SIR. Robert PEEL, Balt., to join
him, in a Course of º for a manly set-to atween 'em
in the Metropolis of London and the Provinces º As di
ence of opinion, should never separate friends
the old sailor thinks that SIR CHARLEs and Šin Romert should go
together. Their ages may differ, but so do their abilities, and their
claims upon the patronage of an Enlightened British Public. Whilst
SIR. RoRººt can do the tumbling, SIR CHARLEs won't turn his back
upon nothing rough. As in the good old times of our dmothers
there was nothing like the show of the monkey and the dromedary, so
in this Card it is the humble but hearty desire of SIR. C. N. to bring
back the good old, days of his ancestors, with the helping-hand of
SIR. R. P. With this view as an object, SIR CHARLEs, NAppER will
give at once a short notice of the entertainment which himself and his
º *; friend of the Admiralty (if he will allow him so to call
im, and if he won't, it doesn't much, matter) will be ready at the
shortest notice, in any place, to project before the public.
PART I.
Will open with SIR. C. N. and SIR. R. P. on the deck of “one of those
ificent vessels which,” as SIR. R. P. observes, “ploughs the ocean
m
like Queens:” not that SIR. C. N.—although a bit of a farmer—ever
ffer-
or that very reason
saw a queen at the ploughin all his life. Passing Cronstadt, there will
ensue a little lively patter between the parties, a song then to be sung
by SIR. RoRERT in the character of Cronstadt to the old words of “Take
me while I’m in the humour;” to conclude with a cutlass combat which
will be supposed to land the exhibitors at St. Petersburg. -
A street in St. Petersburg will introduce my gifted friend SIR
Robert with a weather-glass under his arm. He sit down upon
ſ/ | the monolith—which he says is “the biggest stone in the world,”—and
to show the variety of the temperature will befriz to itin five minutes.
This accident will bring out the real friendliness of the Ruskys in the
/ shape of an old woman with a boiling tea-kettle which will thaw SIR
Rob ERT afore you can cry scaldings.
... We shall then be invited into the Winter Palace to see the Crown
jewels; faithful models of which have been taken and will be carried
round by SIR. Robert on a gilt dish for the inspection of the ladies.
SIR. Robert will be rºi for any question that may or may not be
put. Returning to the stage, SIR. Robert sing a song, in which
the admiral will be playfully badgered for not having brought home the
emerald from the sceptre for the sword-handle of PRINCE ERT. We
shall then exhibit two portraits of the GRAND DUKE CoNSTANTINE, on
the truly British º: of hearing both sides. There will be my Duke,
and SIR Ropert's Duke. , Ladies may choose atween em. This %.
will conclude with a grand dinner, SIR Ropert—like Leporello in Don
Giovanni—showing how he dined at £60 ahead, and even then hadn't
a belly-full. The total amount of the bill will be given in fireworks,
which will conclude PART I.
PART II.
Arrival at Moscow, we are drawn by Four Grey Horses at five-and-
twenty pounds a leg to our destination. SIR RoſſºRT, puffing a cigar
in his lively way, in the face of a policeman is all but speared like a
grampus by the Peeler's three-pronged fork. Off for the fair at
Nishnei, SiR Robert singing an entirely new song, “If I had an
Arab what wouldn’t go.” ightful state of postilions; no saddle-no
nothing. SIR. RobºFT asks 'em “If they didn’t wish themselves
cherubims,” when the coachman knocks 'em of their perch for not
iying a civil answer. True British Humanity! SIR. Robert lets
all a tear on the unfortunate, and drops 'em arouble. SIR. Robert
shows to a discerning public "how he never enjoyed anything so much.”
Great discovery at Nishnei. SIR. Robert, finds “a brick” in the
shape of a Governor; which he will make the subject of a lecture, a
comic song, and a §"; Portraits of lovely Circassians, and im-
minent danger of SIR RöBERT, when his friend and companion, SIR
CHARLEs comes to his rescue, and carries him safely of SIR. Robert
in the character of a Tea-totaller. He buys 3,000lbs. of tea for home
consumption, a general election being expected in the summer. At the
i. fair of Nishnei, SIR, RoRERT meets a Scotch.lassie, and to the
elight of the “brick” of a Governor, dances a Highland-fling with
her. Splendid view of the Coronation at Moscow; with portraits
painted º: SIR. Robert. Count MoRNY, as a picture-cleaner, an
the Belgian Ambassador as a cheesemonger. The EMPREss of
Russia dishevelled, and the grand smash of her crown! The whole
to conclude with fireworks that, duly going out, and succeeded by, a
steady electric light, will show “SIR. Robºt PEEL reposing in the
lap of BRITANNIA,” Šm CHAries NAFTER, his friend and companion,
on this occasion only, feeding him with spoonvictuals.
Full particulars will be described in future bills. In the mean-
time all parties desiring to treat, will address either to SIR. Robert

oth.

THE Scythians, as STERNE informs us in Tristram Shandy, used tº
hold their discussions under two º conditions; the state of
sobriety and that of intoxication. They debated their affairs, first
drunk, that their counsels might not lack vigour; and then sober, in
order that their resolutions might not be wanting in discretion. , KING
Clicquot is evidently a descendant of the ancient Scythians, but as
yet he seems to have acted, in the business of Neufc âtel, after the
manner of his ancestors in part only. He meditates vigorous measures
against Switzerland; but he has not yet revolved these under the cir-
cumstances which are necessary to render them discreet.

THE WEATHER AND THE CROPPERS."
BY A WERY OLD GENTLEMAN.
I’M frozen in;.
I couldn't stir out of my room, for pounds;
Last night I tumbled down and broke my shin,
My boots were listed” carefully, but, Zounds!
'Twas on a slide (I wonder why they suffer
Such things to #;" no Policeman near—
And one young villain bawled out in my ear—
“Why don’t you go and get rough-shod, Old Buffer?”
Oh, dear!, what weather—
Í sit and watch the snowfall shower by shower;
I’ve seen the snow and men go down together;
I’ve seen five cabs go down in half-an-hour;
I’ve seen two Chimney-sweeps in white pass by-
I've seen the pot-boy over at the “Grapes,”
With his big shovel in no end of scrapes;
I’ve seen a snow-ball through a window fly.
I’m out of Coal—
Two sacks this week already, and they’re gone,
And MRs. FINCH, my landlady, good soul,
Came up to me and said in mildest tone,
“I’ve sent my JIMMY and it ain't no go–
Of course he went a slidin', the young rip he
Always do—and it’s so cus-sed slippy
That your’arfunderd’s buried in the snow!”
We’re out of water—
And so of course on No. 2 we call;
And No. 2, or else her pretty daughter
Stands on a chair i hands it º'er the wall;
She hands it to our charwoman, old SwitchER—
And yesterday, in manner most improper—
The poor old creature went a . “cropper,”
And broke her nose—it might have been the pitcher!
I sent young JIM—
To get some Brandy in a bottle, well
He met the “Times,” and had a slide with him ;
“Times” tripped up JIMMY, and of course he fell,
And broke tº...”. young imps stood around him,
And one, when from young JIM the spirit trickled,
Cried “Want yer door swep º' seeming greatly tickled,
I could have punched his little head, confound him
I’ll go to bed—
And there shut out the fog and sleet and snow.—
I’ll wrap my blankets tight! round my head,
And thus get warm—“Who’s knocking there? Hollo 1

MAJOR SCOTT OF GALA AND “A WILE WAGABOND.”
MAJoR. Scott, of Gala, has been lecturing to the forlorn folks
of Gaiashiels, whom he has not enlightened. º for them,
quite otherwise. Even as Orpheus, first lyre, as he was con:
sidered, was at length torn to pieces by his audience, even so did
MAJOR Scott by too bold an experiment on the ears of his listeners,
run a like danger, of dissolution. Fortunately, however, for MAJOR
Scott he possessed a personal privilege, an immunity not enjoyed by
the Orpheus aforesaid. MAJOR Scott is Lord of the Manor of Gala.
shiels, and we hope, exclusive proprietor of the manners of MAJOR
Scott. The Major began his lecture in all the easy confidence
inspired by genius with the fullest confidence in itself and in the
credibility of its hearers. He gave a history of the condition of
Ireland in 1848.9; then, passing quickly from the first gem of the
sea, he landed on the continent of Europe, and immediately put
his foot in it. For the , Major observed that—“At , that time,
Hungary was under the leadership of that pile vagabond, LQUIs
KossuTH !” The audience gasped a moment for breath, and the
collecting it, sent forth so #. , so piercing a hiss that it searche
the very button-holes of the Major, going clean through his shirt to
his skin, thence to his marrow—his martial marrow. For it so happens
that, KossuTH has just finished a triumphant progress throughout
Scotland, sowing memories of his genius, memories of the wrongs of
his country, thick as gowans. Therefore was the time especially ill-
chosen for the Major to air his opinions on the character and properties
of Hungarian scoundrelism; and therefore, warned and shivering by
the result, it is said by those in his confidence that the Major, upon
reaching a place of security, thought himself particularly fortunate
that ..i. H. only well hissed. After all, we dare say the Major
meant no harm. And for hissing, there is an animal upon which any
amount of hissing is only so much breath thrown away, seeing that in
the matter of hisses it is fully capable of supplying itself. By the
way, the editor of the Kelso Chronicle has made up a portentous rod of
native thistles, wherewith he has so scourged the Major that, however
#. he may be to pocket the chastisement, he must feel it rather
difficult to sit down upon it.
The Swiss Holydays.
Accounts from Switzerland state that:—
“On the 24th, all the higher public schools in Switzerland were closed, and it was
settled that they should not be re-opened until the storm had blown over.”
“Don’t I just wish that old CLIcQUoT was going to pitch into
England!” will probably be the exclamation of many of our juvenile
readers on perusing the above announcement.
OUR POLITENESS ExCEEDS HIS BEAUTY.
MR. SPURGEoN has just published a sermon-pamphlet, called Turn
or Burn. Wishing to meet the reverend . more than half-

The Experience of a Borrower.
“How very provoking, my dear fellow? If you had but come yes-
terday, you might have had the money!” How true this is through
life? Whenever we ask for anything, the only Yes we receive is in

APING THE FASHION.
THE French proverb informs us that “L’habit me fait pas le Moine.”
We can only say that if “the dress does not make the Monk,” it fre-
quently makes the Monkey—as may be seen any day by walking down
Regent Street at three o'clock.

“My DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“Some of your remarks upon my last letter are sensible."
some are funny,” and the rest are very stupid.” But I am not at all
offended with you," because I know that in #. heart you agree with
everything Isay, and only add those grumbling growls to keep up the
precious dignity of your sex.” - - -
“You told me in a note you sent me, that, what Isaid in a former
letter about the ridiculous way young men talk has been considered as
‘too severe” by some of them, and that they have been writing to you
about it. I wish you had sent me their notes". They must be ul
gabies to feel hurt by a girl's observations; but if the º fits let them
wear it by all means. #. fact is, my dear creature, Ihave not said
half enough about them. We have been to a good many parties this
Christmas (and, º, the way, I send you a box of bonbon crackers for
that dear darling little thing that wrote to you last week about HANs
CHRISTIAN ANDERsen, who is a great pet of mine, so be sure that you
have them forwarded, and do not let any of your great stupid he-con-
tributors get hold of them, or not a cracker will the poor child ever
see; for men are the greatest babies of allº) and I have of course had
plenty of opportunity of listening to the sort of talk that I am too
severe about. I made memorandums of what I could remember when
we got home, on several mornings,” and I have put it together, as a
specimen of agentleman's polite conversation in 1857. I have not put
in my answers because they were only nods, or indeeds, or O yeses,
or little laughs.” Listen to him, now.
“‘Children’sº: very delightful, ain’t they, charming and fresh
and all that? I don’t care much about children myself, but I know a
good many persons that do. (This was meant for facetiousness). If
they’re little I’m always afraid of breaking 'em, and if they’re big they
break everything. My sister’s got a lot, I think they’re the best
children I ever saw, but I don’t often see 'em, because she knows I
don’t exactly hanker after 'em, as MRs. BARNEY WILLIAMs says. Seen
MRs. BARNEY: No P. You should, she’s very great fun. ey say
Piccºlomini has made a fiasco in Paris, the French people won’t

wild about her—you liked her? Yes, all the ladies liked her, because
she was a lady herself, by birth, SoNTAG the same, you know, though it
was before your time. ...What, a noise the wind makes, awful gales
everywhere. I know a fellahin the Waifs and Strays, government office,
you know, and his time of leave is up, and as he’s rather down in
the black books he ought to be coming over to-night, wonder if
he will. He'll be a waif and stray himself if he does. (More
acetiousness.) Well, no, not a friend, but I should be sorry to
ear that old Piggy CARTER had come to grief. Piggy—yes, we call
him so, chiefly because he hates it, I believe, his name's Piggott.
His mother's so proud of him that she used to call him her Piggott
diamond; there’s a big stone of that name, you know, ARchbishop

Do you like the theatre? I like to bé amused, but there's nothing to
amuse one now, unless one takesa Hansom, and goes away into the wilds
at the east-end, places you never heard of, there’s fun there, but it’s a
bore to go so far. Any friends in China? 'i only ask, because as you
may have heard, we’ve been breaking the crockery, and one likes one's
friends to be out of the way of the pieces. How those young ones are
pitching into the cake. I got twothings of the Tree, a baby in a cradle,
and a gridiron, here’s the gridiron on my watch, but I gave the baby
to ..MELLINGTON, over there. They’ve no children, and it’s a
great grief to them, because his brother, whom he hates like fun, will
come into the property, and it’s a tender place with them, so I gave
her my baby, as one likes to be charitable, you know, but she did not
look very grateful. , Seen any of the pantomimes? Well, I don't
know, which is the best; they’re all more or less stupid; besides,
there’s no fun; they go in for a great show, and clown don't burn
pantaloon with hot pokers, and wop him, and all that. That makes me
scream, but I don't care about revolving stars and glittering abodes.
O es. I know all that, they are wonderfully clever, and the other's
only like big schoolboys, but Ihanker after the hot poker. BRowNING

ULTRA-PROTESTANT PRECAUTION.
... Though every man is supposed to be a fool or a physician at forty,
it appears that the science of spiritual medicine is not necessarily
acquired in the course of many more than that number of years, even
by those who have been studying it all their lives. The followin
epistle, from a clerical pen, betrays the apprehension that a doctor o
.. may possibly abjure sound doctrine in his old age, and turn
uack:-
q To the Editor of the “Morning Herald.”
“sº-As it is quite expected that a more general measure will be introduced
into Parliament for the pensioning of retiring Bishops, permit me to suggest that a
clause ought to be inserted in the Bill to the effect that any º who shall, ºr
his retirement, secede to Rome, shall forfeit his pension grant by such a Bill.
Such a clause is evidently desirable, considering the Romanising tendencies of some
of the Episcºpacy.
* Jan. 3rd." “I am, Sir, yours, CLERicus."
But, if it is fair to deprive a old prelate of his superannuation
allowance for turning Papist, why propose to limit the deprivation to
a particular case f perversion? y should not an ex-bishop be
equally liable to lose his income for turning Methodist or Quaker, or
at the imminent perilof his old body (at least), submitting to be ducked
as a particular Baptist?.. By the time a bishop has qualified himself for
the episcopal pension-list, he may be presumed to have made up his
mind pretty well upon the subject of theology, and any change of mind
at that time of life, on such a subject can only be that species 9
change which involves irresponsibility. He would be about as likely
to go over to Rome as to go over to Utah, and to join a confraternity
of friars as to enter the Agapemone; and in the event of his doing
either of these things, why punish the poor old bishop for indulging in
a mere vagary of dotage.
How History is Written.
We all know that History is but another form of Romance, especially
in the hands of a Frenchman. For instance, the “History of the
Empire,” by THIERs, is only His-Story (and we need not say what kind
of a Story that is) of the different wars that took place with the
English in the Peninsula, and elsewhere.
HomocoPATHIC COMFORT.
THERE are some persons who are contented with very little. Lock
at LQRp ERNEST. He is indifferent to public opinion—he is perfectly
satisfied, he says, with the esteem he has for himself.

THE EVER-PERSECUTED SAINTS.
BY OUR ULTRAMONTANE CONTRIBUTOR.
In a spirit of violent bigotry, intolerance, and hostility to the mild
and liberal Church of Rome, the Times has published the substance of
an allocution lately delivered by the holy Pope in a sacro-sanct and
secret consistory. The intolerance, animosity, and prejudice of the
Times are not indeed evinced in any particular comments upon the
apostolic address, but are manifested in wicked inverted commas, in
which certain passages of that venerable document are maliciously
printed. For example, from that portion of it wherein the Govern-
ment of Mexico is affectionately reproved for its horrid and execrable
gºntumacy of the authority, and interference with the property, of the
Church, is culled the following extract:—
“The permission given by the Government to all sects Pºll.
religious rites is denounced as “an abominable measur whic
undermine the most holy Roman Catholic religion.'”
This other passage, on the subject of Switzerland, is, in like invidious
manner, selected from the allocution:—
“The state of Switzerland makes Pius THE NINTH quite disconsolate, “so nu-
merous are the encroachments of the civil authorities on the rights of the Church,
and of her Bishops and servants.” After hurling his thunders at those Priests who
obey the laws of the countries in which they live rather than the instructions for-
warded to them from Rome, the Holy Father entreats the Most High to enlighten
*::minds of men, and to bring back those who have gone astray into the right
path.”
to practise their
is calculated to
. The impious inference which the above passages are published to
insinuate evidently is, that the Roman Church would ... all tole-
ration if she could, and desires to set herself above the law. The
writer ignores, the indisputable truth that true toleration is simply the
toleration of Catholicism, and the equally undeniable verity that the
Church cannot wish to be superior to the law, because she actually is
so. How much ºf: are Catholics to groan under such bitter
persecution as that which they suffer in beholding the words of their
yenerable pontiff exposed to obloquy and derision in the pillory of
inverted commas?

A CHRISTMAS PUZZLE.
Of all riddles and puzzles that are generally handed round at this

O º Manchester Eraminer of Dec. 31) is about the very hardest to
crack:-

We are curious to know the nature of the above “Let in” —and

that the family so favoured did not find its stock of silver spoons
reduced after the “let in,” and that there was sufficient left in its
larder to provide a decent breakfast the next morning? As for
ourselves, we were singularly “let in” on New Year's Eve, for we
played at Whist, and lost a small carpet-bag-full of sovereigns to two
or three dark-complexioned old maids!. In the meantime, we recom-
mend to all such jovial societies as still love to º a good round game

HE Poultry have been gathered beneath the wing of the
Crystal Palacc, and the crowds who flocked to see them
have been such as one expects to encounter in the Poultry. . “Among
the distinguished visitors who were present,” the reporters have
omitted to announce the name of Mr. Pºnch, a slight which Mr. Punch,
*:::: distinction is in need of no such advertisement, is willing to
orgive.
The show consistin
attempt with his
but for further
Catalogue.
To have added to the musical attractions of the Palace, the show
might not inaptly have been advertised as a concert, the pieces for
performance º principally by Cocks AND Co. There were indeed
so many bright chanticleers assembled to proclaim the morn, that it
would have somewhat puzzled the Ghost º Hamlet's Father to have
known which particular cockcrow to select as his signal for departure.
The voices of the game cocks were, especially triumphant, as though
crowing over the downfall (in price that is, for on their legs they stand
as high as ever) of their late antagonists the Cochins, whose melan-
choly notes seemed sounding a lament that the good old Cochin days
are over, and that they are now quite off the road to fame. Punch
noticed several attempts to bring their disputes to the decision of the
beak, and the struggles which they made to do so, stretching out their
necks and pecking round the corner at their next door neighbours,
induced the reflection that to “live like fighting cocks” can hardly be
as enviable as the saying seems to hint.
Stepping rather quickly past the long-legged Malays, and not .#
º enough to know for what good point such skinny creatures coul
-- }. commended,” Punch lingered with reflective fondness by
the edible-looking, plump, and appetising Dorkings, and thought how
much their appearance would improve with oyster sauce and parsley.
Some of them being marked for sale at the “reduced price” of ten
and even twenty guineas, Mr. Punch was strongly tempted to smack
his mental lips at them, and estimate the value of their liver wings,
and wonder if the eggs they laid were really golden ones.
Mr. Punch next honoured the rabbits with a visit, and finding that
the prizes were awarded chiefly for their length of ears, thought of
certain ears which shortly he expects to see in the St. Stephen's Show,
and which he considers might have fittingly competed. Among the
#. the least formidable looking were the “dragons,” and as a
escendant of St. George, Mr. Punch would back himself to demolish
º number of them—due attention being paid to their being nicely
baked. The fantails and pºuters seemed the swells of the assemblage,
and strutted up and down like beadle-birds, swelling with importance.
Ladies who wear Crinoline—and who of them does not?—combine the
of more than a thousand pens, Punch will not
º: one to make individual mention of them all;
ormation he would refer the curious to the
characteristics of both pouter and fantail; puffing themselves out as
well in front as in the opposite direction.
Returning to the poultry, Mr. Punch last inspected a prize pen of
Polish; which proved to be inducive of the thought that had he him-
self condescended to have been an exhibitor, the prize in this case
would have been awarded º it being, he believes, universally
acknowledged that in the matter of polish, fº. has never been a pen
to equal that of Punch.
THE REVERSE OF PRUDENCE.
At a late Meeting of Middlesex Mºº MR. W. PAYNEbrought
up a report from the Committee in relation to criminal jurisprudence.
One would think the report in question must be brief, as the Com-
mittee, can hardly, have had much to say on that which does not exist
in England. Criminal jurisprudence is a science which we have yet to
learn: there is no such thing at present in HER MAJESTY's dominions.
On the contrary, the outrages committed, daily, by ruffians who have
been turned loose on society, clearly prove that our arrangements for
the disposal and discipline of our convicts have been dictated by the
very grossest jurisimprudence.
A MILLINER'S SHOP IS ONLY A DUCK-POND.
A Miser ABLE bling victim of a husband amathematises those
seductively pretty bonnets, that milliners will exhibit in their shop-
windows to tempt poor frail women to . inside and purchase. He
informs us that they are generally “show-bonnets,” bought at a large
price in Paris, and kept purposely before the public female eye as an
alluring bait to catch customers. But few can resist the temptation.
A wife looks—sails round it—admires and admires-ventures closer
and closer—opens her mouth—and with one bold gulp she and her
purse are fairly hooked and taken in. Therefore, our above-mentioned
victim declares that whenever, to his sorrow and cost, he overhears his
wife, in an ecstacy of uncontrollable admiration, exclaim, “There’s a
inck of a Bonnettº he always says, as tenderly as he can, “No, m
dear, not a Duck, but a Decoy-Duck, of a Bonnet. It is only place
there just to induce a pretty little Duck, like yourself, my dear, to rush
in after another!” The first time he tried this tender remonstrance, it
had the effect, he says, of saving his wife from º into the
inevitable vortex of extravagance, but he regrets to add that it has
never succeeded since!. He characterises a milliner's shop as a Duck-
Pond, full of nothing but Decoy-Ducks.
HORRID SPLENDOUR,
LoRD CAMPBELL, in his lately published Lives ºf the Chancellors,
indulges in the following jocose remark:-
* I am §º to say that since the year 1845, when the above sketch of the office
of Lond Chancellon was composed, it has been sadly shorn of its splendour."
In stating that the Lord Chancellorship has been shorn of its
s lºie LoRD CHIEF Justice of course means to say that the
.. and iniquities of Chancery have been rendered somewhat less
laring. They are still, however, sufficiently so to render the Court of
hancery much too splendid.
The Hero of the Nilſe).
THE papers speak highly of CLIFFoRD's plan of lowering boats. We
wonder if the plan is at º equal to the one that SIR CHARLEs NAPIER
tried before Cronstadt of lowering English men-of-war, for without
making a single move, or striking as much as a blºw, he cºntrived to
let down, in the estimation of foreigners, an entire British Fleet.

Do you note what a change has come

Do you see they have grown like to

Why have they become cloven; why

Why, I, blind to honour, and justice, and right,
For my Fatherland who had no stomach to fight,

WAYS AND MEANS.
THE question, which, just at present, chiefly occupies attention, is
how to provide for the abolition of the Income-Tax by just as well as
necessary taxation. To this end we have received various suggestions.
. A young º proposes the º of an additional tax upon
cigars; on all dogs except King Charles's spaniels, Skye terriers, and
Italian eyhounds; on guns; on yachts and wager-boats; on canes
and walking-sticks.
. Several young gentlemen recommend a tax on Crinoline; on bando-
line; on eau-de-Cologne; patchouli, and all other perfumes; on buns;
on ices; on bouquets, pianos, and white satin shoes.
Warious individuals connected with Exeter Hall urge the enactment
of a tax upon theatrical performances; all concerts of a secular nature;
casinos; masquerades, whether public or private; races; dog-fights;
and evening parties.
By sundry adherents of the Band of Hope, an increase in the taxation
of malt and hops, and all fermented or spirituous liquors, is advocated.
Divers publicans, on the other hand, desire an augmentation of the
duty on tea and coffee, and the addition of a Government per-centage
to the water rate.
The Vegetarians generally contend for a tax on butchers' meat; the
homoeopathists for an increase of duty on all articles of the Materia
Medica, and a special tax on allopathic prescriptions.
: Paterfamilias” is in favour of a tax upon ſodging-houses.
“An Old Bachelor” wishes for a tax on the following articles:—
Hard-bake, lollipops, toffee; toys; rusks, tops-and-bottoms; wet-nurses;
cats; perambulators; violet-powder; and babies.
Financial Hocus Pocus.
WITH a view to disarm, in some measure, the growing opposition to
the Income Tax, it is, we understand, the intention of the Government
to direct the various, collectors, in all possible cases, to extract the
i. due under Schedule D from the payer under the influence of
Cilloroform.
SATURNALLA IN THE BOUDOIR.
THE fashion of inflating ladies' dresses, has so far reversed the
relative positions of mistress and servant, that it is now usually the
lady’s maid who has to blow the lady up.

THE ORGANIZATION OF PLUNDER.
THE rapidly *. respectability of the profession of theft and
roguery, attested not only by the names of the several eminent parties
who have of late adopted that profession, but also by the opulence
which has been acquired by many of its practitioners, suggests the
expediency of organizing the pººl. and fraudulent community in
i.º ilar manner to that of the organization of other professional
es.
When a gentleman such as MR. AGAR, celebrated in connection with
ion, is found to have been in possession of as, much as £3,000,
amassed by perseverance in dishonest industry; when we find such
#. with balances at their bankers, and º; on the Stock
xchange, as well as in some more public places, besides private resi-
dences and pockets; we clearly perceive that the time for moral and
social combination among those gentlemen has arrived.
. The particular gentleman whose name we take the libert
tioning, MR.
tation for life.
of men-
AGAR, is, as is well known, under sentence of transpor:
To an individual of that respectability which is implied
in £3,000, this position must be peculiarly ...; If rogues and
thieves would constitute themselves a corporate body, misfortunes of
the kind alluded to, might, by various means, be averted from the sort
of gentleman, indicated. A Charter might be eventually obtained,
empowering the º of Thieves, like some other Corporations,
to rob the public with impunity.
It is, in the first place, proposed to found a College of Thieves, at
which lectures shall be delivered, with practical demonstrations, on
the various branches of swindling and stealing. The importance of
education to the thief is now fully recognised; and it is earnestly to
be hoped that sectarian prejudices will not interfere to deprive him of
that inestimable blessing. Little difference may be expected to prevail
among the predatory classes, either as to the propriety, or the method,
of combining religious with secular instruction.
The College of Thicves will grant diplomas in the various branches
of the profession, and these distinctions will give the gentlemen on
whom they are conferred a social status superior to that of unlicensed
practitioners. - - -
A Thieves' Mutual Assurance Society will also be established in
connection with the College, to the end of securing a decent mainte-
nance for the widows and orphans of such of the members as may come
to be hanged, or for the wives and children from whom others may be
* y transportation. It is not anticipated that there will be
felt any great want of confidence in the projected institution. The
Bullion Case has, indeed, cast some little doubt on the hitherto received
maxim of “Honour among Thieves; ”, but other cases have thrown
as much doubt on the presumption of the existence of honour among
commercial gentlemen; and if, as has been said, a Board has no con-
science, there can be little difference, except in name, between a Com-
#. and a Gang. In fact, the distinction between a rogue and an
onest man so called, is now very generally felt to exist merely in name;
and censure, as in a nation of antiquity, regards not crime but detec-
tion, Education, therefore, will tend to preserve the character of the
thief, by developing those talents which will enable him not to get
found out: and the maintenance of respectability will, be further
insured by a system of co-operation calculated to frustrate those objects
which are vulgarly termed the ends of justice.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW YEAR.
N º January, 1807,
exactly fifty years ago, our
Times, was Å. and we had
nearly finished , breakfast
before it arrived. Conse-
uently, when it did come
§. an engagement with
the DUKE of York, who was
just about to be impeached
y Colon EL WARDLE) we
put the paper into our
pocket, instead of leaving it
on the mahogany slab in the
hall for the then news-boy
(now the Venerable ARCH-
peacon " " " " "), and it
is still in our possession:
Happening to look into
it, we observe an Ode for
the New Year, by the Poet
faureate. This official's
name, at that time, was
PYE. Now it is TENNYSON.
Had the present Poet
Laureate seen fit to an-
nounce an Ode on the
present new year, we should
not have felt it our duty to
look for one elsewhere, because we have a good deal of confidence in
MR. T., and we think that what it was desirable to say he would have
said delectably. But as MR. Moxon gives no sign that he is in pos-
session of “copy”—advertises no Ode for the New Year—we are thrown
upon our own resources. And as nobody in the world can possibly have
heard of MR. PYE's Ode for forty-nine years and three hundred and
sixty-four days, we cannot see why it should not do over again, with a
few notes, showing its adaptation to existing circumstances. For one
year is very like another. - - - - -
The first verse contains eighteen lines, in which the question is asked
whether a sailor in a storm yields himself to inaction, and the answer
is given “No”—that he says his prayers and mans the mainsail-top-
gallant-brace, or performs whatever other nautical manºeuvre, may be
shipshape. This proposition may be admitted. Now for the application.
W}. was true in 1807 is true in 1857.
“So, though around our sea-encircled reign,
The dreadful tempest seem to lower,
Dismayed do Britain's hardy train
Await in doubt the threat'ning hour?"
Lo to his sons, with cheering voice,
Albion's bold Genius” calls aloud;
Around him valiant myriads crowd,
Or death or victory their choice; *
From ev’ry port astonish’d Europe sees
Britannia's white sails 4 swelling with the breeze;
Not her imperial barks alone
Awe the proud foe on every side,”
Commerce her vessels launches on the tide,
And her indignant sons awhile
Seceding from their wonted toil,"
Turn from the arts of peace their care,
Hurl from each deck the bolts of war,
To sweep th’injurious boasters from the Main,”
Who dare to circumscribe Britannia's naval reign.”
1. We should think not. 2. Mr. Punch. 3. Preferably the latter,
of course. 4. For “white sails swelling with ” read “funnels smokin
in.” 5. This is Ode slang, but it means that, the General Screw an
P. and O. boats carry guns. 6. Pronounced tile, in poetry. 7. Or read
“To smash the injurious Pig-tails, who again
Have dared to treat SIR. J. D. BowFING with disdain.”
THE LAUREATE ON
The next verse is excessively noble and retrospective.
“And see with emulative zeal
Our hosts congenial ardour feel;
The ardent spirit, that of yore
Flam'd high on Gallia's" vanquish'd shore;
Or burn’d by Danube's" distant flood,
When flow'd his current ting'd with Gallicº blood;
Or shone on Lincelles” later fight:
Or fir’d by Acre's tow’rs the Christian's Knight;
Or taught on Maida's fields the Gaul to feel,
Urg'd 3. Briton's arm, the British steel ;
Now in our breasts with heatredoubled glows,
And gleams dismay and death on Europe's ruthless focs.””
1. Gallia means France. 2. A .. river of Europe. , 3. French.
4. Ha!, we have you. You have laughed, in your geographical hauteur
at the three preceding annotations—now tell us what Lincelles is, an
who fought the later fight, and when? ... A copy of Mr. Punch's Pocket-
Book shall be given to any lady or gentleman who will solemnly assure
--- --
us, on honour, that, without looking into a single book, he or she
answered that the battle was fought between France, and Austria,
England siding with the latter, on the 18th of August, 1793. 5. The
verse will do, but we propose to read, for the last couplet,
“Now bids us force John CHINAMAN to blows,
His teacups break, and further flatten his flat nose.”
The fourth and last verse of the Poet Laureate's Ode runs thus:-
“Not to Ambition's specious charm,
Not to th’ ensanguin'd Despot's hand,
Is conquest bound—a mightier Arm
Than Earth's proud tyrants can withstand,
The balance holds of human fate,
Raises the low and sinks the great,
Exerting then in Europe's cause
Each energy of arm and mind,
All that from force or skill the warrior draws,
Yet to Superior Power resign'd,
Whose high behest all Nature's movements guides,
Controls the battle's and the ocean's tides;
Britain still hopes that Heav'n her vows will hear,
While Mercy rears her shield and Justice points her spear.”
By reading this yerse carefully about eleven times, and not allowing
yourself to be confused by the pertinacious inversions thereof, you may
gradually discover the meaning, which we take to be nearly unobjection-
able. It is not in mortals to command success, but if we do all we can,
we may take our chance, provided we are humane to the vanquished,
and never go to war except for just cause... This latter proviso, the
poet, after the fashion of his school, puts at the end of all things; and
indeed, as it is usually the last, thing thought of it, may be said to be
in the right, place. ... Well, the verse answers the purpose of the
campaign of 1857, and
“Britain still hopes Tea will not be more dear
Along of ADMIRAL S., both cruel and sewere.”
And even if the moral of the poem should not at once strike con-
viction, there is another moral which must go home to every careful
heart. ... We have been taking care of this Ode for exactly fifty years,
and behold we find—what we never expected—a use for it at last. To
adapt a celebrated maxim, “Burn no man's poems; some day you may
want a poet of your own.”
“FROM THE DON TO THE GANGES.”
“AMONG all, the studies to which human attention can be directed,
none is more pleasing and profitable than Geography.” . This touching
passage in an essay of Mr. Punch's, written ºf anterior to his being
invested with the toga virilis, has been suggested to his memory by the
following extract from the Calcutta Englishman. # in
criticising an article by our respected contemporary the Eraminer,
}. the Persian war, and the possible advance of Russia upon India,
ODServes :-
“The Examiner is a very poor authority upon Indian mili matters, for he
says that a Russian army, after beating us on the Indus, “would have a march of
1,500 miles to make in order to reach the powerfully fortified British Capital in the
marshes of Bengal.” Think of that, GENERAL TodTLEBEN. Sevastopol is nothing to
Calcutta, All your skill would be unavailing tº cross the Chitpore Canal, for that
is the only fortification we know of. Fort William, it is true, is at the opposite end
of Calcutta, and if its ramparts were not shaken down by its own fire, might
demolish the town in a short time, but, as for defending it, that is totally out of the
question.”
Now, a geographical dictionary,...of º: would
have contained such a description of Calcutta as might have prevented
our friend the Eraminer from falling into the Chitpore Canal, and—
Stop! A dark thought crosses us. Is treachery afº Did the
Eraminer—bribed with Russian gold-desire to mystify our military
authorities, and to delude them, into permitting a Russian i. to
advance upon Calcutta? That those authorities should, of themselves,
know anything of the subject, is out of the question—that they rely
upon the English, press for information and guidance is notorious.
And the Eraminer has betrayed them!
Tower-Hill!...Are there no Axes left, save what serve for the moon's
rotation—no Blocks, saye Metropolitan central, boarders? Well,
Parliament meets in a few days, and we counsel the Eraminer to
obtain passports, for some region where ex-tradition is unknown. “A
manifest traitor!”

ost likely the Winter is not as yet gone,

The Spring Circuit, likewise, had yesterday planned.
A SAWAGE CUSTOM. THINGS
By DR. LIVINgston’s accounts, which we rejoice in having lately
had the opportunity to audit, we are informed that the natives of the
Central parts of º bear, in many points, by no means an unfavour-
able comparison with nations far more highly civilised: indeed, that
several of their manners and customs might with advantage be adopted
by ourselves. Their marriage laws, however, it would seem from what
the Doctor says, are still in a sadly savage state; and had we an
notion of committing matrimony, we should be among the last to wish
to see them added to our Statute book. Only fancy what a falling off
there would be in the Doctors' Commons licence business, and what a
mania for emigration all our British bachelors—except, of course, the
old ones—would suddenly be seized with, were the legislature to give
sanction to such notions as the following:-
“If a young man married a woman of a neighbouring village, he left his own vil-
lage º went to live with his mother-in-law. It was his duty to pay her the
greatest respect, and to supply her with firewood. Near the Zambese the young
men had to make long journeys into the country in order to procure firewood for
their mothers-in-law.”
Just imagine the effect upon the marriageable members, were a
measure framed, upon this passage to be introduced next Session
entitled (say) “A Bill for the better protection of Mothers-in-law an
for more effectually º: them with firewood.” Certainly, if
anything were wanted to confirm our previous impression of the
hopeless state of barbarism, in which the Central Africans are sunk,
their laws as to their mothers-in-law, have abundantly supplied it.
Can anything be conceived more truly barbarous than this, sentencing
a married man to the hard labour of procuring fuel for his mother-
in-law. The more we think of it, the more we feel assured that no
civilised being would ever dream of a consent to it. At the same
time, however, we cannot help admitting that although, with us a
mother-in-law has not as yet been le ally invested with the power of
making her daughter's hº go . cut her firewood, still her in-
fluence has not infrequently proved strong enough to induce him, for a
time at least, to cut his stick.

MARY ANN’S NOTIONS.
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I HAVE not said anything about Politics in any of my letters,'
but I beg you to recollect that I made a condition when I began to
write to you, that no subject was to be considered out of my sphere.”
and as to a woman's not understanding politics, that is all fiddle ſaddle
when you look at the ridiculous idiots” who profess to be politicians,
and a great deal j." they do to the nation that a woman could not
do! But my particular reason for letting the matter alone was, because
I knew that as soon as February came you would all be at it ‘ding
dong, hammer and tongs,’ as AUGUSTUs sings," and I thought that in
the mean time you might as well not be diverted from somet of
more importance. I know exactly what is going to happen. In about
a fortnight the precious Parliament assembles, and then d bye to
everything rational. For my part, I always wish that Papa would
discontinue the newspapers during the time Parliament º º
as there is never anything to read that is worth reading, and one only
gets irritated with the absurd nonsense that is talked from might till
morning.
“I never could understand why the Parliament does not have a
newspaper of its own, and not spoil ours with its nonsense. Surely
such a wonderfull astonishing] eloquent 1 omnipotent ... national!
assembly” could manage to keep up a paper for itself, and if it thinks
all its miraculous wisdom worth printing, print it, and not intrude into
other places. I consider it all very mean conduct, but that is just like
the H.P. who talk most of their liberality. I dare say that the very
member of Parliament who would go up to the House, and make a
grand tirade about charity and the poor, and all that, would shove a
poor little ragged boy that begged of him right out into the mud, and
then look round and growl because the jº, did not keep the
street clear of . I have not the least faith in anybody that
proclaims his good deeds, and as for defending himself by saying that
the poor little child could go to the workhouse, that drives me out of
all patience, when you know quite well that he would be abused for
coming there, and very likely beaten, for as for the relieving officers,
you can easily see what sort of wretches they are, when you read in the
Times of Saturday last that the relieving officer at Mile End (and he
should be sent, miles off, if I had my Nº. was brought before the
Magistrate for beating and kicking his wife.” A mice person to send a
poor ragged child to, I think! -
“But what I was going to say was this, that the opening of Parlia-
ment is a signal for leaving off attention to anything that ought to be
attended to. Nothing of that sort will get into the newspapers for
ever so many months. There is some dº upon bad people while
you can expose them in the press, but when the press is stuffed up
with rigmarole speeches,” people may do as they like, for there’s no
chance of complaints getting a hearing. do not mean nonsense
about the moon going round and round, as MR. JELLYBAG SoMEBODY"
says she does or does not (and what does it signify?), or ridiculous
passengers who are going on a voyage of ten thousand miles" and
make a riot because their rolls are not hot in the Red Sea,” or
creatures who get too much wine at their clubs, and think they ought
to have a policeman to escort them to their bed-rooms, and feel them
selves throttled by their horrid all-rounders (and I’m GLAD of it) and
fancy they are being garrotted. Such geese ought not to be allowed
to write in newspapers at all. But if a real abuse comes, and one
would like to see it shown, up, it is either neglected altogether, or
W. into, a few words, and stuck in a corner which no one sees.
e may be run over by cabs, or imposed upon by the drivers, or we
may see something cruel done, or we may feel indignant at the

things quietly that ought to make them boil over with rage”) or box-

my dear Mr. Punch, and because it makes the papers so stupid an

THE GREAT CLOCK CASE.
A CoRRespond ENT of the Times complains, with a warmth which is
not unpleasant this cold weather, that having paid to see the Great
Clock of St. Paul's, all he was allowed a sight of was the wooden
outside case, which was something like Fº: to see Wombwell's
menagerie, and being shown the exterior of the caravans containing it:
We are not aware ourselves how the case really stands, but it would
seem from this statement, that the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, in
their capacity of showmen, have also become sellers, and, as such are
amenable to the law forbidding trading in the Church. . The disclosure
will, however, doubtless serve to prevent their doin much more
business, or many more of the public: for if we hear of any ºne now
paying the initiatory fee of twopence for the privilege of seeing
what he has been warned he won't see, we shall apply to his ascent to
the sight which is invisible, the observation, “Twópence more, and up
goes the Donkey !”
Pro-Slavery Solecism.
THE Augusta (U.S.) Chronicle, in describing the sale of a lot of
niggers, makes the following observation:-
“They were common negroes—field hands."
Hath a negro, then, hands, or any other human members or diment
sions, in the opinion of an advocate for bestial slavery? Does he
account negroes men? Could he not have had the consistency,

* Ho would be right to refuse street alms, because they usually go to unworthy
F. who send out children to beg. Ladies are the great encouragers of this
cruelty.

* This brute's case is exceptional, but you are right, to a certain extent. The
workhouse official is apt to be hard and coarse, and therefore ought to be regularly
looked after by his masters.

“ BRUMMAGEM' PIETY.
WE learn from a paragraph in a weekly contemporary, to which, of
course, “a press of more important matter” has prevented any earlier
allusion, that a majority of the Members of the Birmingham Town
Council have acted recently in such a manner as to render it desirable
to have their portraits taken, and sent in to the Association for wholly
closing Sunday, as candidates for the Cant Gallery which we hear is
in formation. The act by which they have immortalised themselves
(for, being introduced in Punch, their reputation is undying) has been
the prohibition of a concert of purely sacred music, which it was pro-
posed to give in their Town Hall on Christmas i)ay at prices that
would render it accessible by, “the people.” The debate upon the
question is said to have been a long one, and in proportion to its length
was the narrowness of mind which was evinced by those whose votes
had the majority. As a sample of the oratory by which they professed
to expound their views, and justify their opposition to the leave which
was applied for, we are told that—
“One expressed his ..". that sacred music was not different from polkas,
except that it is Pº slower. . Another observed, that he did not individually
object to music of any kind, but he didn't like sacred music blown through a
trumpet.”
Had it, been proposed at this Christmas Concert to perform the
Hallelujah Chorº on a pair of bagpipes, we should think this latter
gentleman would have not withheld consent to it. His objection,
it would seem, is directed not so much against the music as the instru:
ment; and in instancing the trumpet as his particular aversion, he is
robably moved by a spirit of rivalry, as he perhaps is in the habit of
lowing his own. Now in the bagpipes he in no way need have had
such fear of competition;, while its tone might in some measure have
improved the occasion,” by reminding those who heard it of those
sermons in drones which we most of us have listened to.
en ears, are stopped with the cotton of Cant, they are rendered
deaf not only to reason, but to music. However long a fanatic's auri.
culars may be, he can hear no difference between a psalm tune and a
polka, at least, if the former be played out of Church-time, Having
no music in his soul” all music sounds alike to him, whether it be
the HANDEL of the organ-loft or the handle of the street piano; and
having himself “no mind for” it, he compounds for other sinfulness
by condemning that as such. - - -
It is, a common phrase to speak of articles of doubtful origin as
being “ Brummagem” ones. And we think such spurious sanctity as
that which would prevent even the music of the Messiah being played
}. Christmas Day, may be fittingly set down as “ Brummagem”
iety.
MENTAL MORPHINE.
A NUMBER of serious gentlemen have formed themselves into an
association, under the title of the “Society for the Suppression of
Opium Smuggling;.” their object, being to preyent the Chinese from
ruining their constitutions by taking opium. In the, attempt to stop
a supply for which there exists, a demand, these philanthropists ma
not, perhaps, be very successf The best way to effect the desir
purpose, will be, not to bother Parliament to legislate for the preven-
tion of the opium-traffic, but to endeavour to supersede opium by some-
thing better. Let them get a number of Exeter Hall tracts translated
into the Chinese language, and imported into China. These will, to
all the natives who may be induced to read them, prove a harmless and
efficient substitute for opium; and the speeches of the members of the
Society, added to the tracts, will doubtless much augment their influ-
ence in communicating repose to the Celestial Empire.
IDresses and Dinners.
Wiry, it was demanded by a vulgar person, do the air-tube Crinolines
cause a ball to resemble a dinner party?. This extraordinary question
meeting with no reply, the coarse individual said, “Because where
the Crinolines are inflated, there must be a regular blowoutſ”

vants are the grea-
test of all domestic
troubles. Most of
them are quite im-
racticable. They are
iscontented with
rigour, and , demora-
lized by indulgence.
Their regard is dead-
|A ened by keeping them
at a distance: familiar
treatment destroys
their respect. What to
do with them nobody
§ knows; but unfortu-
nately nobody also
knows what to do
without them. Efficient
§ substitutes, for men
and maid - servants
: would be among the
greatest blessings
which could be con-
ferred on respectable
society. The above-
named Association has
been organized with a
view to supply them.
By far the most
faithful, tractable, and
as far as their abilities
extend, useful, servants, are dogs. They are, moreºver, much more sagacious and
intelligent than many, if not most human domestics. There are but two things that a
good dog wants in order to enable him to become a perfect servant. He only wants a
pair of hands. ... If he had, but that, he cºuld clean boots, and knives, and forks, as well
as plates and dishes, which he now actually cleans. He could also cook, instead of being
limited, in his culinary º to causing the revolutions of the spit. . He would be
honest, trustworthy, grateful; would know how to behave himself, and would unhesitatingly
do whatever he was told, if possible.
But dogs have not han s, and therefore, there is an end of the question of the pos-
sibility of educating them to wait at table, and converting the servants’ hall into the
servants' kennel. ere are, however, certain other animals possessed of the organs which
those of the canine species are destitute of. The animals º to are the several varieties
of the ". tribe, particularly the ourang-outang, the ape, and the chimpanzee. These
creatures display a high degree of intelligence, which, if duly cultivated, may be confidently
expected to render them fully equal to the performance of any menial function. To accli-
mate and educate apes and monkeys, so as to render them capable of supplying the place
of footmen and maid-servants, is the design of the Jackanapes’ Development Society.
If success should crown the endeavour to train the simia to act as servants, it will afford
º
- º
a peculiar advantage. The male animals of that class will look particularly well arranged in .
that variegated and comical attire with which the superior classes are accustomed to decorate
their serving-men. To the judicious eye, a livery seems to have been cut out for an ape,
and an ape to have been designed to wear a livery.
Ladies are requested to observe that monkeys will, as maids, have the recommendation
of never “answering,” when found fault with or scolded.
The domestic apes and baboons, when not employed in the kitchen, will have the special
recommendation of being sufferable to remain in the parlour, whence they will not be able to
carry away any conversation which º º hear, and where their familiar treatment will
not render them insolent. By being thus kept within sight, they will be prevented from
exercising any of their mischievous propensities that education may not have eradicated.
The fondness which monkeys display for their young gives good reason to expect that they
would make the best of bonnes and nursemaids; and, considering what history records of
RoMULUs and REMUs, and the more modern and less questionable fact that, infants are now
often brought up by hand upon asses’ milk, there is no reason why a healthy young female
ourang-outang should not be employed as a wet-nurse.
The infestation of , areas by policemen and soldiers, is a nuisance which will be entirely
abolished by, the substitution of monkeys of the softer sex for cooks and scullions. No
followers, will ever be stipulated for by these domestics; in short they will be manageable
exactly like any other live stock: and it will be at the option of families to “raise” as our
American cousins say, their own servants, or to purchase them when wanted.
No solicitude will need to be felt on the subject of a provision for servant monkeys in their
old age. When past work, it will be simply necessary to shoot them.
Forcible Association of Ideas.
At a House of Call for Ticket-of-Leave men, in the neighbourhood of Nº. a
well-known “neck-and-nothing” hero º in rather late one night, and, with his mind
evidently, running upon his business, cried out: “Here, waiter, quick,-a chop-hot-and
tub the plate down with a Garottel". A couple of policemen, who happened accidentally to
be present, instantly disappeared.
CRINOLINE'S RAGING FURY;
OR, THE FASHIONABLE FEMALE’s SUFFERINGS.
YoU rustic maids of England,
Who dress yourselves with ease,
Ah, little do you think how hard
it is French taste to please.
Give ear unto the milliners,
And they will plainly show,
With what care, tight with air,
They our Crinolines do blow.
All you that will be modish,
ust bear a steadfast heart:
For when boys gibe you in the streets,
You must not blush nor start;
Nor must you be disgusted
To hear them cry, “Hallo!
I should think you will shrink:
Give your Crinoline a blow !”
The bitter jests and sarcasms
A i. girl must endure, .
And look a fright to dress aright,
Are grievous, to be sure;
Our skirts they are derided
For being puffed out so,
That by steam, it would seem,
We our Crinolines do blow.
In growls like distant thunder,
Which gruffness doth enforce,
We oft hear things old fogies say,
Beyond all bearing coarse;
This causes indignation,
And makes our anger glow;
But disdain is in vain,
And our Crinolines we blow.
Sometimes when Neptume’s bosom
Is tossed with stormy waves,
A lady walks out sho #.
And wind and weather braves;
Borne off her º she mounteth,
And cometh down so slow, .
Broad and light, with such might,
We our Crinolines do blow.
A maid exerts the bellows
To bloat us round about, .
When woman’s arm doth, fail us,
Then man's must help it out;
We ring for John’s assistance–
For he is strong, we know–
To help puff us and stufus
When our Crinolines we blow.
The husband, and the lover,
May simple gowns prefer,
That fit the form, and, in a storm,
With safety let one stir; -
Reproaches fierce, our hearts that pierce,
A. our taste they throw,
Which we poor things endure
Whilst our Örinolines weblow.
We put on costly merchandise
ô"most enormous price,
So much we need of drapery,
To follow this device;
We spend so much in drapery,
Of such a size to show, .
And with toil our shape spoil
When our Crinolines we blow.
Genius Rewarded.
It is reported that a Russian order is on its
way to England to be bestowed, upon SIR
Robert PEEL, in recognition of his late lecture
on Russia and her people. The order is, the
Order of the Merry St. Andrew of the first class.
The QUEEN, it is said, has already anticipated the
baronet's prayer to wear the honour; he, having
in HER sTY's opinion, so richly deserve
the distinction.

SCOTLAND AGAIN IN MOURNING.
cot1.AND is again desired
to “mourn” by a heart-
broken editor, whose elastic
feelings stretch as far back
as Edwarp THE FIRST.
That unprincipled indivi-
dual created great havoc
“upon the archives and in-
signia of the country!”. It
is a lately discovered fact
—a fact over which CALE-
DoNIA is desired to drop
at least a tear—that when
EDWARD arrived at Rox-
burgh Castle “he had with
him wholehampersofpublic
documents, state papers
charters, burgh seals, an
such like, all of which he
had . ruthlessly plundered
as his armies passed from
place to place.” Armies
generally prefer state plate
to state papers; and would
rather lift and drive whole
flocks of living sheep, than
go ever so little out of the
way to sealch for sheep's
- dead, parchment, men-at-
arms being rarely antiquarians; but it was otherwise with EDWARD
THE FIRsi's myrmidons. They were ruffians with a taste; bullies
and swash-bucklers inclined to the historical; and therefore burgh-
seals of wax and lead were far more attractive in their enlight-
ened eyes than salvers, and tankards., “It . form a subject
for the justice-to-Scotland men,” writes the Scotch patriot, “to insti-
tute inquiries as to what of these memorials survive.” It is impossible
to conceive a nobler, a more useful application of northern intellect.
“If part of them still exist,” continues the ardent champion of his
country’s glory, haply remaining in lead and parchment, “it might be
a question if their concession to the original owner should not be
asked.” We earnestly hope that, at least a few fiery souls will work
their way to England in search of the stolen, goods; for there can
be no doubt that the precious plunder somewhere enriches the great
national fence kept by the Southron. The parchments, and, seals are,
doubtless, hoarded somewhere with the original knee-buckles of the
first MACALLUM BORE; and ought to be carried back in solemn pro-
cession to the land of seedy cakes. -
BULWER has just delivered himself of one of his best firework
orations, as the new Lord Rector of Glasgow. He glowingly coun-
selled the young students to go forth into the world “with the lion
of Scotland in their hearts, and the white cross of ST. ANDREw”—
we forget where. . Now, what could be nobler knight-errantry for
these young Scotch lions crossed with ST. ANDREW, than to sally
forth in search of the papers, the charters, and the burgh-seals
carried from Scotland by EdwarD THE FIRST, and hidden in the
closets, the store-rooms (much of the parchment covering the mouths
of pickle-jars,) and the strong boxes of the Southron? The histor
of any one such knight duly attended by his SANCHO duly mounted,
the faithful animal fed with the national thistle, would make a finer
poem than the Faëry Queen, a more splendid prose epic than Don
Qwirotte. We make a present of the idea to PROFEssoR AYTQUN
who, should he condescend to adopt it, will do equal justice to Scotland
and himself. "Epwºrn in Fij has long enough had it all his own
way; . and it is quite right that, even at this late hour, Scotland
should bring the freebooter to the scratch.
~~
A PLEASANT SERVICE.
A BRIGADE order recently issued at Naples prescribes the system of
reciprocal espionage to be observed in the Army of his most Catholic
Majesty. Every soldier is to denounce the P. of private papers
y a comrade; The officers are instructed to intercept and examine
all letters addressed to their men. ºf soldier of superior intelli-
ence or, education is to be watched. This order will no doubt be
ollowed by a new Neapolitan manual and platoon exercise—of which
the words of command will be:—
Present papers!
Carry letters!
Return papers'
Open letters'
But we cannot for the life of us imagine how, with such a system,
BoMBA’s soldiers are ever to “stand at ease.”
NEWCASTLE NOODLEDOM.
LORD CLARENDON must mind what he’s about. It would seem that
he no longer is the head of the Foreign Office; or rather it would
appear that there are now two Foreign Offices, and that his is the in-
ferior department, and exists only under the surveillance of the other.
The Urquhartites of Newcastle, in their capacity of zealous servants
of the state, and in their apparent incapacity to serve it any better, have
been forming a “Committee for Investigating the action of Diplomacy,”
which is intended to act as a check ". LoRD CLARENDoN, or whom-
ever else the foreign ministry may hereafter be entrusted to." As a
Specimen of the wisdom which, the country may expect to emanate
from its Newcastle privy councillors, we read that the Committee at a
recent meeting for “investigating” the Chinese bombardment—
“Resolved unanimously, That ADMIRAL SEYMoUR has unnecessarily and unlaw-
fully destroyed innocent life: that we therefore resolve to proceed against ADMIRAL
SEYMoUR for murder at the Central Criminal Court.”
In the event of the failure of their criminal proceeding, for in the
existing state of the law it may not be quite so easy to indict an admiral
on such a charge as the Committee seem to think, we suppose that the
Parliament now sitting at Newcastle will proceed at once to pass a
special act for the occasion, declaring such offences as that which is in
question to be legally considered murder, and giving themselves the
power to appear as public prosecutors whenever they think fit, , Being
acquainted somewhat with the instincts of busybodies, it would not at
all surprise us if the Committee should be led to arrogate the fung-
tions of the Home as well as of the Foreign Office: and indeed their
resolution to indict, ADMIRAL SEYMQUR is a sufficient indication that
they intend going by degrees the whole Governmental hog, and re-
moving the nation's business premises from Downing Street, West-
minster, to their committee-room, Newcastle.
Now, granting every allowance for the weaknesses to which all busy-
bodydom is subject, we are not disposed to grant that two heads to a
department would be better than one; and as the office of inistering
our foreign affairs must be considered foreign to the duties of Newcastle-
men, we cannot suffer them without a protest to threaten LoRD CLAREN-
DoN with official decapitation. . It is all very right to º an eye upon
the Government, but Mr. Punch does this without being thought prying
Twhich indeed he would submit to be, if he were ever caught “investi-
gating” the secrets of the State. , And the nation probably will agree
with Mr. Punch, that whenever it be needful to hauſ any of its servants
over the coals, those combustibles may be supplied at 85, Fleet Street,
without having to send so far as to Newcastle for them.

It is, however, to be noted that the dresses at
Qnly cover a certain number of square feet. They cover two other
feet, which, may be square for aught anybody can telſ; or which may be

prison-house, we landed at Pimlico. Epistemon told us that the region
was so called from one Ben Pimlico, a jolly companion of the order of
the Bottle, who deceased in the odour of strong liquors three hundred
ears since; but for my part I believe him not, neither do I care for
en Pimlico, nor for you, nor for anybody else. The houses were fine
and stately, and one of them was a tavern, into which we entered.
Friar, John, who was always ready for a quart or so, demanded of the
hostel-keeper the best of his ale. , Which the fellow straightway
bringing in aś “By the Pope's horns,” quoth Friar John, “thou
noddie-peak doddipol, I will teach thee to mete out such measure ad
cleros,” and thereupon lent him a thwack with his walking-staff, which
knocked him into the ides of February in August, or, to s more
clearly for your comprehension, into the middle of next week. But a
comely damsel hastening with an ample flaggon, the good father, who
was the gladdest man in the world, and nothing malicious, heartily
forgave him, º “I have but given thy malt a new stroke.” At
which Pantagruel laughed until, he had bursten four hundred and
.." thousand two hundred and seventeen buttons off his nether
garments.
While we drank, at a pleasant window º bid us remark the
goodly dwellings thereabouts, saying, that doubtless fair and gentle
folk did dwell therein. Whereto the good Pant el answered,
that it was not so, and that the fine new sweet lovely houses were
inhabited, in great part, by slabberdegullion druggels, paltry customers,
base loons, noddy meacocks, ninnie-hammer flycatchers, weak lob.
dottorels and, the like. These, mark you, infest the new streets of
that region, which were designed for altogether another sort. “But
how, my ford and King,” quoth, Panurge, “do such sort of for:
jorn snakes contrive to live here?” Thou shalt see for thyself,”
answered Pantagruel.
While he spoke there arose a dreadful yelling as if Lucifer and nine
hundred and nineteen thousand of his fry had broken loose. Panurge
fell down, sitting-wise, and cried, “O my sweet friends, Pluto and
Proserpine, and the furies have come forth, and I hear Cerberus
howling and Demorgorgon roaring. Bou, bee, bor, baa. Let us fly,
before we be torm in pieces. Friar John, thou cowardly
º raw thy, great sword, and comfort me, bou, bee, boo, baa,
boh.” “Truly I belabour thee,” quoth the glad Friar john,
“ thou bawling slave, until thou hast no more consistence than a
syllabub (would I had one here), an thou cease not thy, clamour.”
“They come, they come,” cried, Panurge, “and the world is at an
end. O that I had a sweet little great lodging on the top of Mont
Blanc, or Mont Maelstrom, or I care not if it be Mont Pleasant,
where I might be out of the fangs of these demons.” “Be still,” quoth
Friar John, “and I will kill them to you like so many blackbeetles.”
With that the horrible rabble came howling and roaring past our
window, and we plainly, discerned their vileness. There were men,
and women, boys and children, all bawling and screeching like frantic
fiends. And they cried hareskins, and hearthstones, and matches, and
ornaments for your fire-stoves, and periwinkles, and sweep, and water-
cresses, and milk at threepence a Ş. and vegetables, and oranges
and old clothes, and fish, and rabbits, and onions, and images, an
flowers all-a-blowing, and dust, and catsmeat, and knives and scissars
to f. and pots to mend, and kettles to mend, and umbrellas to sell,
and baskets, and chairs, and m , and crumpets, and broken windows,
and a thousand other cries, And with them came minstrels of all kinds,
Germans in a dirty gang blowing blatant trumpets, and scrubby Italians
grinding organs, and vagabonds with jºi faces and paper collars,
with banjos, and other miscreants with hurdygurdies, and ballad:
singers with furious shouting, and an idiot with a cracked fiddle. ...And
ever and anon came men with loud and sepulchral yoices, ºf
beer, but at times they battered the doors fearfully, bawling pots. An
this we learned was the rioting that went on in these regions from
morning to night.
“I do now no longer wonder,” quoth Friar John, “that no decent
person can live in these new and pleasant streets, and I marvel that
such things are permitted. Nevertheless, I will do somewhat for mine
order's sake, for are we not to promote peace? Paz vobiscum. /* There-
with he rushed upon the rabble with his thundering great, sword,
which he called Benjaminall, slashing, crashing, *...* kicking,
ricking, licking, swearing, tearing, never, sparing, until he had so
#. beaten, and routed that whole gathering and assemblage of
rascaldom that there remained not one. Then from the neighbouring
regions issued, smilingly, gentle and courteous people who had long
suffered the anguish of these monsters, and they fell on Friar John's
neck, and kissed him, and entreated us all to come into their hºuses
and eat, drink, and be merry. And we did so, carousing until the
dawn, and it was a sweet and heavenly sound to hear us laugh.

-It is stated in the
Paris Medical Gazette
that of the 3,295,220
oung men examined
n France for military
service, during 19
years, 13,007 were ex-
empted for myopia.”

and perfect vision?
MARY ANN’S NOTIONS.
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“PAPA has just been reading to us, with considerable delight
(all his own, dear old thing!) some remarks which MR. Roebuck, a |*
member of Parliament, has been making in a speech somewhere, being
I suppose, in such a dreadful hurry to let off his pent- º that
he could not even wait until Tuesday week... I think I never heard
such rubbish talked in all my born days. , Who MR. Roebuck is I
have not the least idea in the world," and what’s more, I don’t want to.”
but what § they are that send such a person to represent them I
certainly should like to know, that I might ask Papa to reserve his
nominations to the Idiots' Asylum for them.” -
“This MR. Roebuck, as far as I understand his stupidness, was
declaiming i. politicians who pretended to be independent, but
went over and sat by the Government. As if it signified where people
sat; but men are such absurd sticklers for rules and regulations, though
they can always find some Jesuitical excuse for breaking them when it
suits their precious taste., Besides, it is the man that talks, and not
the chair, I suppose, and he can just as well †. his mind in, one
seat as, in another. If I were to say, that I could sing “Bobbing
Around” (not that I would sing such vulgar, and ridiculous nonsense
anywhere, and it shows what men, are, and what will amuse, their
intellectual lordships, when they will go and shriek and applaud like a
pack of schoolboys at such dreadful rubbish," for I read the words in
your paper, and though I dare, say the singing is everything, you
ought to be ashamed of yourselves), on a music-stool, and not on a
chair, I should be called a ridiculous lump of affectation."
“But I suppose he meant to say that these independent men, who
rofessed to belong to no party, were got to support a party after all;
have no doubt of it in the world, and it is just the character of all
men who make professions, and of a good many who are too artful to
do that, for fear they should have their words thrown in their hypo-
critical faces. Howmen ever trust one another at all is beyond my com-
prehension. But that is their business. As for their joining a party, it
is very natural. Most men are idiots, and if they find one who is
wiser than the rest, they run round him like my bees at Worthing
round their queen, and do as he does, and repeat all he says with the
greatest slavishness. It is quite consistent with human nature, I mean
man's nature, not that it is always human, but oftenyery inhuman. Look
at that wretch, that beat the poor children in the factory with a great
strap. I should like to tie him to some of the machinery, and let him
be torn into a million pieces," and, if that other man gets off that de-
stroyed the babies, it will be just like our laws.” The QUEEN ought to
be despotic in such matters, and when she reads a shocking t ln
the paper, she ought to have §: to send off some soldiers, without
another word," and shoot such people out of a cannon. What is the
use of g her a Queen if she cannot do as she likes Pº
“I was going to say, however” that it is quite natural that men
should turn round upon some pretence or other, and break their words
with their constituents, and serve them right for trusting. But I was
not *::::: for MR. for aucº's impudence—I don't care whether the
word is the thing or not (nobody can see me as I write it)—in
lºſing the blame of such men's tervigosation—is that the way to spell
it"—on their wives. Yes, you would hardly believe it, but § is the
excuse set up by MR. RoßBUCK. Papa read it out, “with emphasis
and bad discretion, as Augustus says. “Now, my dears,” said Papa,
"observe the influence with which the honourable member credits the
[. sex.' And he went on to say that the way independent mem-
ers came to vote for LORD PALMERSTON (who is the dearest man in
all England, and everybody ought to vote for him”) was this. The
member's wife reads of the QUEEN’s parties, and of course is dºing to
o to them, and so LoRD PALMERSTON tells the man that if he’ll vote
or him, he’ll procure a ticket for his wife, and then the woman gives
her husband no peace or rest (and very right too) until the ticket is
got at the price.
“I hope this is true. I hope with all my heart that it is true. I
don't suppose it is, because men never * the truth in public, what-
ever some of them may do in private. But if it is true, it shows that
a wife knows much better what is good for a husband than he does.
It is good also for the people, because if you do not support the
QUEEN and her Government, there must be revolution and rebellion,
and very likely a guillotine in Trafalgar Square, and the poor dear little
royal children beaten by shoemakers in the Tower.” d as you are
always preaching to wives to mind their families and their interests,
they are doing so, I suppose, by getting their husbands into the highest
and best society, and *Wi acquaintances for their children against
the time, they come out. at can be better for a girl than that she
should be introduced into society by her, own mother, instead, of
having to beg for a c one? And as for the sons, I suppose a father
who is friendly with LoRD PALMERSTON, can always get them made
cornets and senior wranglers and midshipmen, and that.". And
because a poor wife struggles to i. these things for her children,
she is to be denounced upon a platform. Nice creatures you men are,
certainly, very nice creatures! Preach at us to do things one day,
and abuse us for doing it the next.”

THE POST IN THE SUBURBS.
FEw people are aware of the enormous distance which intervenes
between London and Hammersmith. True, the transit in an omnibus
does not seem to take a very long time, and on foot is accomplished
with apparent ease and brevity; but the road must be an enchanted
one, º its seeming shortness illusory. . It is, in fact, much farther
from the Metropolis than Southampton; for if at the latter place you
post a letter directed, to. Fleet -
night, it arrives at its destination early the next morning; whereas, if
despatched from Hammersmith, at the same time, it would not, be
delivered there before two o'clock on the following afternoon. Either,
therefore, the foot-passengers and the omnibuses are all bewitched; or
else the mail-carts are so; unless, indeed, the Post Office authorities
are under the influence of a spell which renders them inattentive to
Hammersmith letters. Under the new postal arrangements Hammer-
smith is marked §§. for West. This is at present a mistake. The
W. for that so-called suburb ought to be “F. W.,” signifying Far
est.

WHERE ARE THE POLICE P
Small but Brutal Shoe-boy (loq). “’Ave yer Moostarchers blacked,
Capting 1–Do 'em for a a'-penny!”
HOW TO BEHAVE OURSELVES.
Of all reading, we like the literature of etiquette. We never open a
book of manners, without a pleasant sense of our ignorance—the igno-
rance that is perfect bliss. e really feel that we have been, even at
the best oyster parties, but as a child playing with the shells, now and
then, it is true, swallowing an oyster, but without any thought of the
pearls that we were casting to qur porcine appetite. And then, con-
scious of our shortcomings, stricken with conviction of what is wanting
in us, we feel inexpressibly grateful that we have arrived at the age of
—weil, no matter what—knowing so little, and faring so well. For
º: learn for the first time, from the Etiquette and Ball-Room
ide, that—
“When you receive visitors, do not show off your wardrobo. It is kind to your
friends to give them a chance of outshining you; or, to put this more seriously, you
should be sure that your own appearance will not shame the worst-dressed man that
may happen to come.”
Henceforth, when we “receive,” we put aside our brilliant studs, and
merely exhibit our modest ivories. Nor henceforth will we, with
unfeeling vanity “shame” dear, good MUDDAson; who, for “dress,”
always. reads.” dirt,” and enters the drawing-room with a splash.
Henceforth, far be from us the vanity, the Wºlf conceit of
varnished boots. . No: we will sink to the homely level of BIGGLEs.
wADE, and “receive” in high-lows.
The next, formula on “the art of introduction” should be deeply
considered by men; they would perhaps learn from it humility, and
perhaps not.—
“In the act of introduction, the iſ." is always presented to the superior; for
instance, the gentleman to the lady, and not the lady to the gentleman.”
Of course, not: women—we, beg their pardon, ladies—being in all
English conditions superior to the inferior animal, man. Hence, have
we a queen: hence, women have the first seats in Parliament (in the
fºllº : hence have they the first word, we need say nothing of the
ast,for that speaks for itself. In fact, in all cases woman is superior
to the man. It is not only the law of England, but the law of
nature. Therefore, ToMKINs, when at MRs. Noggins's ball—for which
she has sent out cards—you are introduced to Miss JEMIMA SMITH,
w low, and consider yourself considerably beneath the superior
JEMIMA., And remember, TomKINs, you are compensated for this
humility by the assurance of the author that “the first act of courtesy
should always come from the lady,” an old truth, as old as Paradise,
when Eve courteously offered the apple to her husband. By the way,
speaking of º: we are told that—"If the lady who sits next to you
at dinner should ask you to pare an apple or an orange, hold it with
your fork to do so.” Had father ADAM done this, it is not improbable
that he might have thought twice ere he had tasted that tremendous
pippin. e next injunction is full of divine philosophy:-
** If you a d nice to eat or drink, do not it to somebody else.
the º, º...; :*::::::::::::: your #. with :::::::: the #:
of another.”
And how gross, how indelicate such an implication!. Nevertheless,
how constant throughout life is the tendency of mankind not to keep
what is nice, but to pass it to somebody else! After this fashion, how
do women give away their hearts, and—bless them!—often think
nothing of j. present. The concluding sentence has all the weight
and music of the deep harmonies of Lord BAcon. -
“Do not be so absurd as to refuse to take “the last piece,' or any nonsense of
that sort.”
The counsel, perhaps, would be more complete (we suggest any
improvement Wiś diffidence) if it ran thus:-"Make sure
of the first piece, and end as you begin.”
As to the treatment of ladies, the profound observer of human
nature declares that—
“There is a certain fulsome obtrusiveness of attention to ladies, to which some
gentlemen are given, and which is very offensive. Pray you, avoid it.”
Thus, though you are in your own looking-glass, that never, yet
deceived you, lovely as ANTINous, do not believe that the ladies may
entertain the same reflections. , Do not, therefore, in the invincibility
of your own fascinations, be fulsomely obtrusive; do not let your fore-
ſinger rebuke a vagrant tress that may have wandered on the white
brow of AugustA, whom, haply, you see for the first time;, neither
take the hand of EugenIA (perhaps you have beheld her twice) between
the pressure of your own, and carry the blushing tips of her º to
your idolatrous ſips. Again, when you look at a lady, perhaps fºr the
third time, do not gaze upon her as a sparrow-hawk takes its bird s-eye
look of a chicken; neither scrutinize her features closely as young
Moses SoLoMon questions the yalidity of 3 doubtful shilling.
“Presents” are wisely, discriminated. ... “You, must not make
F. to your superiors.” For instance, it would not be etiquette
or you, Jones, or for ourselves, to send a brace of birds to HIS RoyAI.
HIGHNess PRINCE ALBERT. Seither would, a present of dairy-fed
# be complimentary in the same distinguished quarter, seeing that
is Royal #. breeds his own pigs.
“Of course there are exceptions. For instance, if you are the writer of a book, or
the painter of a picture, you may safely offer it to any one. Or, if you are a sailor,
you may request a lady to accept the skin of a rare animal for a toilet-mat; or anything
of that sort.”
A parrot, whose education has been carefully superintended on the
forecastle, would, doubtless, be Yº..."; to a serious family.
Having planted your parrot in the bosom of the circle, possibly you
may fall in love with DINAH. Well, you are a wild worldly fellow, and
have been seen by the Rev. MR. HowLAway (who himself attended
for convertible purposes) at JULLIEN's, Concerts. DINAH will not
have you : she still freads the tiger catskin you gave her, under her
feet, and still rejects you. What is your appointed conduct, under
such truly agonizing circumstances? hy— -
“If a lady declare herself unwilling to receive your addresses, retire from the
field at once, with dignified courtesy.”
Excellent advice; still, dignity is difficult. For ourselves, we should
counsel a new plunge. The best mode of recovery is to fall in love
again as soon as possible.
“If the courtship assumes the usual shape, be kind and ectful to the friends of
the woman you profess to love, and do not bore them by i.º.A: calls.”
We confess that our author is here a little unsatisfactory. It is very
true that by abstaining from “too frequent calls” you may please
mamma and papa; but i. about the beloved object: what says the
pouting JEMIMAP
... In the matter of dancing, the benevolence of our author oozes forth
like aromatic gums. He says–
“A kind-hearted tleman will not fail to lead out [ladies who appear to be
neglected by others—but he will not do it ostentatiously.”
Henceforth, having arrived at a contemplative period of life, we will
be that kind-hearted gentleman.
N.B. Balls attended (where good suppers intervene), and plain
partners led out with ease and despatch.

LET us hope that in the next edition that *...* called for of

BOMBA THE BENEVOLENT.
oMBA’s benevolence exceeds
| bounds. . Not content
with bestowing on some
thousands of his subjects
free maintenance and lodg-
ing for the chief part of their
lives—giving them unaske
admission to the Royal
Almshouses nown to
coarser minds by the name
of the State. Prisons), and
there providing them with
bed, and board, the former
of the two being in fact the
latter, except whereitsstead
be supplied by a stone floor-
ing; not satisfied, in short,
with the safe keeping of
their bodies, the King is now
taking thoughtful measures
to ensure also the safety of
their souls. A paragraph,
which is quoted by the Daily
News from the “official
journal of Naples,” informs
us that KING BóMBA by a
recent edict has, in his cle-
mency, decreedas follows:–
“Cherishing in our royal soul
the desire of improving more
and more the condition of our
prisoners, and wishing that their
moral shall not beinferior to their
material improvement, we decree
that the moral and religious di-
rection of those who are detained
in prison is entrusted to the
reverend fathers of the society of
Jesus. One of the reverend
fathers shall form part of the
Commission of Prisons, and will
have a deliberative voice in the
examination of affairs.”
Still having in our mental ears what MR. GLADSTONE told us of the
horrors and enormities of the Naples State Dungeons, we fear that if
the moral condition of the prisoners be no better than the material,
they most of them must be in a truly “parlous state.” But seeing
that sick bodies do sometimes make sick minds, although the reverse
be the more commonly held axiom, would it not be greater charity
were the King to “cherish in his royal soul” a desire for the corporeal
improvement of his victims, before pretending to take measures for
their spiritual benefit? - -- - -
By the clement KING of NAPLEs the State Prisons, it is obvious,
are regarded rather as but adult charity schools; their inmates being
one and all “detained” there solely for their gºod, and for the sake of
“improving more and more their condition.” Yº: it in this light,
we are indeed so struck with KING BoMBA’s bounty, that we think his
name should be coupled with a fitting epithet, to denote the §.
for which he lives distinguished. If the name of BQMBA be handed to
osterity—and even that of NERo still survives to it—we would have
É. descend (although we own he cannot sink much lower) as BoMBA

THE BRITISH BANK IN PARLIAMENT.
|WE learn with great pleasure that on an early day of the Session, a
Bill will be brought into the House for the better protection of
bank depositors, and the surer punishment of all ºil.
The Bilſ will be brought in, by Mr. John M.AcGREGoR, still member
for patient Glasgow, who will advocate the measure with his customary
eloquence, and illustrate the subject with the most copious details
drawn from long and close experience.
Depositors and shareholders of the Royal British will, we doubt not,
beF. to hear that MR. HUGH INNEs CAMERON, though absent, is
still considered very dear by a large number of anxious inquirers,
MR. CAMERON, sojourns in the Holy Land. Whilst engaged in the
Royal British, it was not possible for him to give more than a piece of
his active mind to religious matters (we believe that prayers were only
said in the Royal British once or twice a-day), but that released from
the entanglements of Mammon, he now devotes the whole of his time
to serious subjects. The worthy gentleman has been busy carrying on
excavations in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and has discovered the
country seat, of BARABBAs, which it is said he proposes to occupy.
Such a dwelling-place to such a mind must abound with the most
impressive associations. -
THE BAYSWATER BROTHERS (whose height is respectively 6 feet
4 inches, and 6 feet 11, and the united breadth of whose shoulders extends to
as much as 8 yards, 1 foot, 5 inches) give, respectfully, notice to the Gentry and
Public of Paddington, Kensington, Stoke Newington Chelsea, Eaton Square, and
Shepherd's Bush, that they will be most happy, upon all social and jovial expeditions,
such as dinner and evening parties, as well as tee-total meetings, to escort, elderly
or nervous persons in the streets after dark, and to wait for them during their pleasure,
so as to be able to escort them home again in safety. No suburb, however dangerous,

THIS PICTURE
THE PRINCE IMPERIAL already
developes all the striking charac-
teristics of his illustrious parents.
His hair of the palest gold, falls in
rich clusters adown his neck, and
is beautifully symbolical of the
prosperous fortune brought by the
genius and wisdom of his heroic
and sagacious sire on France. His
brow is square and broad as a tab-
let; whereon might be written,
were it necessary, another Code
Napoléon. The mouth reminds the
Biblical beholder of the riddle of
SAMsoN, in which the sweetness
of honey is mingled with the
strength of the lion. His vivacity
is ...i. and his laugh rings
as with the shrill note of a silver
trumpet; the clarion of France.
It is said by those most intimate
with the person of the IMPERIAL
PRINCE, that his right shoulder is
marked with a bee; while his left
is visibly impressed with a violet.

develope the merest animal, in:
stincts. M. BUoNAPARTE's child

a total absence of the gaiety and

able characteristics of infancy. His
look is a scowl; and his voice a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BATTLE OF THE PANTOMIMES.
HE. Pantomimists, in
addition to the tricks
which they exhibit on
the stage, have a trick
of trying to draw audi-
ences — if the word
“audience” be appli-
cable where the show
is strictly dumb-show
—by announcing that
theirs is the best pan-
tomime in London, and
.# that it were a
waste of money for any
one to pay for seeing
any other. We learn
from our statistical re-
porter that in seven
| lay-bills which he has
ately purchased there
occurs in six of them a
claim of having “the
best Pantomime Com-
pany,” while in the
seventh there is added
a remark, that if you
doubt the fact, you
have but to “come aud
see if it isn't.” Now
this challenge to our
criticism seems reason-
able enough, until we
reflect that to #.
with correctness of the
claimed superlativity
we must visit individually each one of the competitors; for until we have inspected all the
pantomimes in London, how can we with any truthfulness declare which is the best. It would
seem, then, that our previous inference has been deduced .# and that the assertion
of º which appears at first to warn one from the doors of other theatres, in reality
provokes one to pay a visit and a shilling to them: so that the philosopher is tempted to
suspect that he would find, if he could only get a peep behind the scenes, that the opposition
companies form, in fact, a coalition, and while pretending in their posters to be playing The
Rivals, are in truth very amicably playing into one another's hands. - -
But the pantomime harvest is at longest but a short one, and with Christmas it comes but
once a year to us. So although the philosopher may have suffered from the Income-Tax, an
have become morose and a rather strict economist, let us hope that he can still afford to
laugh at any harmless little dodgery that may be used to keep the Pantaloons a little longer
on their legs, and enable the Barlequins to leap a little farther into the spring than they
might otherwise have been ej to do. . A Columbine's roses are by no means thornless,
and Mr. Merriman has often cause to show himself, a sad dog in private : so we will not
ſºft too critically of the means which we may find are tried to keep the roses in bloom,
and the Merriman from laughing on the wrong side of his mouth.
LITERATURE FOR LADIES.
We understand that the producers of those interesting serials, the illustrated books of
fashions, are becoming seriously inconvenienced by the growing amplitude of ladies' dresses.
They have already, it appears, enlarged their engraving-plates to more than twice their
former size, but even this extent is weekly proving less and less sufficient to give a faithful
icture of the costumes now in vogue. We learn indeed from one of their most skilful
aughtsmen, that he finds it quite impossible to so reduce the scale, as to draw a lady's
figure in full evening dress within the comparatively contracted space assigned him. Even
on the scale of only one-twentieth of an inch to a yard he finds the ſargest quarto double page
by far too narrow, to contain all the widths of a fashionable ball dress; and he quite antici-
pates that he will, soon be forced to draw half a skirt at a time, and get the publisher to
intimate that it will be “continued in our next.” -
Knowing from experience that the votaries of fashion are prepared to go any lengths—or
widths—in following their leader, it would not at all ºil. us to find that their circum-
ference increased to such, extent that, to do it proper justice, the fashion-books were
furnished with *: as big as dinner-tables. Unless the mode become more moderate, our
daughters will be coming home with their Belle's Livres about the size of Atlases, with
vings upon folding leaves, which when spread out would paper half our dressing-room.
Indeed, if those “art-treasures,” the millinery magazines, be #. the Museum with our
other current, literature, it will soon, we think, be rendered requisite to build an extra
wing to hold them.
A Domestic Stampede.
IT is melancholy or droll, according to the constitution of the observer's mind, to notice
with what rapidity children, who are playing about their mother's knee, will instantly decamp
on the announcement of their early à.

MARY ANN’s NOTIONS.
|
\ \º
\ || *=}º
F WEA Y DEAR MR. Punch,-YoUR last piece of
V ºs advice is very rude, and I shall certainly
not take it. “Drop politics, indeed! Just
- like the selfishness of men! At the very
moment when Parliament is beginning, and there is some little interest
in the subject, I am told to drop it, that it, may be left to your he-
writers. shall do nothing of the sort, and I do not believe that
you will be so unkind as to suppress my letters."
“However, to-day I shall º with Nº. grumbling,” because
I have something, else to say. At least I don't know–is Divorce
politics?”, I should not wonder if you made out that it was, and if it
is, I can't help it. How you can read that beautiful letter of MRs.
Rowton's, and not all of you set to work with all your might to try
and get what she says carried into effect, I cannot conceive, but I dare
say nothing will come of it.” When a woman who can write such a
letter as that condescends to address you, you ought to pay the most
respectful attention, and be grateful for her advice—but not you; and I
dare say the mean manly feeling (I consider manly aterm of contempt”)
that a woman ought not to interfere with the laws, makes you treat
her with even more coldness than if a man had made the suggestions
she does.
“As for divorce, the question is perfectly simple." A party of ladies
could draw up the law as it ought to be in ten minutes, only you must
fuss about it in the two houses of Parliament, and talk about the
Mosaic law, and the church, and the fathers, and the proctors, and
everything that has nothing to do with the matter. How can Mosaic
law concernit, unless to be sure a husband has made his wife presents
in Mosaic gold?—and many are º: º ! As for the church,
We º to church to be married, not to be divorced. I don’t know
much about the fathers, but if they were fathers of daughters they
would like to see laws made for their good, and as for the proctors
I have met one or two at parties, and they are dreadful stuck-up ol
things, whose opinion I would not take on anything but starching a
cravat?" If people who have nothing to do with a subject would leave
it to those who have—and it stands to reason now, my dear soul, that
the person who wears the shoe must know where it hurts *— this
question could be settled at once.
“A man ill-treats his wife. Very well. Now we don't want
any Acts of the House of Lords, and all that, costing thousands
of pounds, but let a magistrate, sign a paper, and send the
husband to prison, and take all the property and give it to the
wife. Let the husband, if he has any trade or occupation (and
if not let him, be compelled to learn one) be made to follow it
...” and let the money he earns be paid over to the wife an
children. Now what can be simpler than that? The man would be
made industrious, the public º have the advantage of promotin
trade,” the wife would be protected and the children educated. If,
after a great many years you thought he had thoroughly repented, you
might transport him and turn him loose in some colony; only make
him take another name, that his wife might never be shocked by hear-
ing of him. Of course, if she liked to marry again, at º time she
should be free to do so; but most likely she would think she had had
enough of matrimony,
“There now, there is the whole thing provided for, and if lawyers
and talkers would not bring in stupid complications and objections
those words might be made into a law, and there would be an endo
the matter. The only difficulty that I see is, as to what should be done
if a husband runs away; but I think that if you made another law,
saying that if they did this they should be executed, and any person
harbºuring them should be transported for life, it would prevent
it. This would not be a bit too severe, because, you see, a person who
leaves his children, without the means of being educated is answerable
for all the crimes they may commit." But now we come to a question
which you be sure to stir up, and which I dare say men would
avail themselves of to defeat the punishment they ought to receive, and
this is, what do you mean by ill-treatment? Of course, if a man were
to raise his hand to a woman, or use bad words at her, or lock her in
a house against her will, or any other flagrant and open outrage, there
could be no dispute. But there are thousands of other injuries which
the ridiculous law takes no notice of, because it was made by men who
have hard and coarse natures, and do not even see or hear a thing that
will perhaps * a woulall º night.” And then there are dif.
ferent grades of society; and, what is an insult to a woman in one
sphere, is not an insult to a woman in another.” Then, again (I am
ºil. something presently) there are cases in which a woman
might like º to punish a husband a little, in the hope of reforming
and forgiving him. Also he might sincerely repent, after a short time,
which, if he was a man of any feeling, he would do. Therefore, and this
is what I am coming to, you ought not to attempt to make a law pro-
viding for every case that can possibly occur; for, when you had thought
over every injury which a man could do his wife, his evil ingenuity
would invent some fresh one. There ought to be a sort of Court estab-
lished, notaridiculous one wherea ºf: lawyers chatter because they
are paid for it, and everybody tries for victory, not for what, is right,
but more like a committee. Why, when wehada committee at Worthing,
for giving away the bread, º flannels, and coals that winter, we dis-
cussed º enough; and, what is more, everybody got
bread, and flannels, and coals, which is a good deal more than men
can say when their precious administrative powers are put to the test,
remember the Crimea for that.” But this committee should not be
all women, or else you would complain of partiality, but there should
be some dear old men upon it, fathers of daughters, with, white hair
and benevolent old faces,” and then I suppose you would be satisfied.
These questions of ill-treatment might be brought before this com-
mittee, and the magistrate might go by their decision, . Now do you
mean to say that a woman can suggest nothing practical?
“Of course, my dear Mr. Punch, there would be some unreasonable
complaints. A wife might bring up her husband for not bein dressed
when she wanted to go to a party, and refusing to go (Imade a little
picture of it the other day, and I send it you; you can put it in Punch
if you like º mind and tell the printers to keep the face Fº **)
and . I don't say, that he would not be a great bear and deserve
reprimand, this would be irrational in her. But you may rely upon it
that there would be little of this, Women are too glad to keep their
husbands when they can. This is just a man's aggravating º and I
have no patience with it.
“Monday.” “MARY ANN.”
“P.S.. If you ask me, whether a man ought to be able to get rid of
his wife?-I answer, Certainly not. A man has the choice of the whole
world before he marries, and if he chooses badly, that is his fault. A
woman can only have the husbands that offer to her, and when she has
got one, it would be too bad to take him away.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LUNACY IN SHOE LAN.E.
LL yesterday, the attention of the
LoRD MAYok was, we venture to
say, painfully engaged in a case of
unquestionable lunacy. A person,
who had evidently once moved in
i. life, was brought before his
ordship charged with disturbing
the neighbourhood, and obstructing
the way of Shoe Lane. The offender
was very fantastically drest, com-
bining in his wardrobe the charac-
ter of the Asiatic and the Russian.
He said he had good reason for
his outward appearance. He had
laboured at the Turkish and Russian
uestions all his life; long before
}. PALMERSTON had sold Eng-
land to the CzAR;, a fact which he
intended to prove by producing the
conveyancer (a gentleman of other-
wise unquestionable probity) who
had executed the treasonous docu-
ment.
Policeman X stated that he ap-
rehended the defendant in Shoe-
}. He was seated cross-legged
before the office of the Maundering
Herald, having , covered a large
square of the pavement with writing, and with rude designs in coloured
chalk. The writing he continually rubbed out, and as continually re-
newed. A great crowd was gathered about him, to the annoyance
of passengers, and to the general obstruction of the thoroughfare.
The defendant, when called upon for his defence, said he was content
to add another name to the list of martyrs. He had for some time
past written leaders for the Maundering Herald; but he thought he
should better serve the cause of truth by appealing to a larger body of
readers. He, therefore, had taken his place upon the pavement, and
had chalked out the perils of his country in chalk of many colours.
He had also illustrated them with a variety of desi He defied any
of the men of the Academy to beat his design of LoRD PALMERSTQN,
hanging by the neck, with the Russian treaty peeping out of
pocket. Besides, it was well known to him that there was a hitch.
His lordship asked what he meant by a hitch?
The defendant replied—He meant a hitch in the Cabinet. It was at
first a simple hitch; and then there was a hinge in the hitch; and then
the hinge was got over; or rather it was cut º Sword of the Lond
and of GIDEON.—SIR Robert PEEL and the Bricks of Babylon–The
EMPREss of CHINA and a Bed of Roses. Ought not Broadlands to
be sown with salt—and the Headsman be forthwith sent to take
measure of the PREMIER's neck?—Three cheers for HAMPDEN and
SIDNEY, and down with Cupid!
His lordship, evidently moved by the poor man's condition, asked if
he had no friends? - - - -
The policeman replied that he had made all inquiries, but without
success. He had heard that the gentleman was once very well-con-
nected, but was given up as hopeless when he became addicted to the
Maundering Herald. The stuff his lordship had heard was of the like
sort with what was written by the defendant on the pavement in Shoe
ane.
The defendant, apparently unconscious of the statement of the
policeman, made a gesture as though desirous of silence. He then
said, “There's a split—a split with a handle; a split with a running
knot.” . The unfortunate man then sat down on the floor, took, from
his #. a piece of chalk, and with amazing rapidity wrote as follows:
“Pillicock sat upon Filicoºk Hill, which incontestibly accounts for
LoRD PALMERSTON's bad eminence.
“Hopdance cries in poor. ToM's belly for three red herrings, which
to any sane mind sufficiently substantiates the treason of the ignoble
PREMIER. -
“The Cabinet-door is not to be bolted with a boiled parsnip; no
my LoRD PALMERSTON, nor are the hinges of the Cabinet to be oiled
with melted butter. -
“Is England to be cast into a china teapot, and the very depths of
the nation to be stirred by the spoons of place?
“But the thunders of vengeance are beginning to rub their eyes and
.." them, and the avenging lightning has already taken off its
mightcap.
#. The showman puts his head into the lion's mouth once too often;
the lion wagged his tail; and the head dropt into the stomach, Åt
his minute, LoRD PALMERSTON has his head, in the mouth of the
British lion; the tail begins to oscillate, and—but to the sagacity of
the reader we leave the just, though horrible conclusion.”
“That’s the very same stuff, my lord,” said the policeman, “that
§: ºwner has filled all shoeiane with. The waggons can’t get on
Or lt.
The defendant slowly rose, and with an air of authority addressed
one of the officers—“You will immediately take that leader to the
Maundering Herald. And mind: large type, with double leads.
Understand me, double leads.”
The LoRD MAYor compassionately shook his head, and remarked
that it seemed a very hopeless case.
“He shall be hung in his Garter, my lord,” said the defendant; and
he immediately º; t up a policeman's hat, and on the glazed crown,
rapidly sketched a figure, depending from a gibbet. Underneath, the
artist wrote, “A trifle for PAM 1 * Then, offering the hat to the LORD
MAYoR, the defendant smilingly observed, “From the life, my lord,
and at your service.”
. His lordship said he really could not, in mercy to the poor man
himself, suffer him to go at large. He must have some security for his
future good conduct. No bail was forthcoming, and the defendant
was therefore locked up.
Late in the day, however, two persons—we considerately suppress
their names—appeared, and entered into the required bond. They
were very strange looking individuals; wearing their beards almost to
the waist. Indeed, altogether they had a most weird, and old-world
aspect. They were understood to be distinguished Southcotians, and
constant readers of The Maundering Herald. The cab, containing the
defendant and his bail, on leaving the office, took the direction of St.
George's Fields.
MORE ART-TREASURES.
THE Directors of the Art Treasury at Manchester are overwhelmed
with offers, on the part of all classes, to contribute to that exhibition.
They are daily compelled to decline propositions from parties whose
estimate of their own treasures is based upon private admiration rather
than upon public recognition of their merits. -
MR. STUBBs, of Aldgate, has proffered the loan of the following
works of art:—
His Grandfather, (twice Churchwarden) by AMos SMITH, artist to the Portrait
Club that used to meet at the Toadstool Tavern, Houndsditch, in 1785-6.
An Anonymous Female, artist unknown, but from the circumstance of her havi
a cat and kittens on her lap, supposed to be by SIR. GoDFREY KNELLER, who painte
the Kit-Cats.
Engraved view of Hyde Park, George the Third reviewing the Volunteers.
Moonlight Scene, by Miss STUBBs, when she had had two quarters' drawing.
Remarkable for the artist's bold contrivance for introducing light, by cutting out
the moon, that a candle may stand behind.
Front of Newgate in 1788. The aërial perspective a little injured by injudicious
. by MASTER STUBBs in a washhand basin, but archaeologically interesting.
nonymous.
Mr. and Mrs Stubbs, in black silhouette. Additionally valuable from their having been
executed on Windmill Hill, Gravesend, on the actual wedding-day, the new-married
couple having previously ordered dinner at Rosherville. Anon.
Two Statues in Plaster. Boy, undraped, reading. Boy, undraped, writing.
Statuette Bust, very small. MR. Buckstone ºr. Wright, but the hat and nose
being gone, identification is difficult.
Spangled and coloured full-len Portrait of Mr. Hicks as Rºdgorio, in the Dumb
Imp of the Demon's Gorge. This noble portrait was offered to the Garrick Club for ten
shillings, but rejected, through the intrigues of jealous artists.
Inkstand, China, in saucer to match, with two dogs fighting, and the legend,
“Let dogs delight,” &c. Historically interesting as the inkstand used by John
BUMPAs, the liberator of Aldgate, when he signed, in 1803, his memorable protest
against “The Thrupp'ny Poor-Rate.”
A Bone Knife Handle, curiously engraved with the cipher “B. M.,” and therefore
supposed to have been the property of Bloody [Queen] MARY.
pecimen of Embroidery of the Eighteenth Century, being an Exampler, or
Sampler, worked by MARY JANE EJAx, aged 11, in 1799, and representing a rural
residence, animals, and trees, with alphabet, and Arabic numerals, and the distich
“I can stitch, and hem, and fell,
And I can kiss and never tell.”
All the above have, upon the recommendation of MR. PETER CUN-
NINGHAM, been thankfully declined, but as it is not designed, to
discourage offers of the kind, any similar works may be left at Mr.
Punch's office for that gentleman's preliminary inspection, before
sending them to Manchester.

A TEACHER'S WORK FOR A SCULLION'S WAGES.
WE should like to know what are the usual wages of an ordinary

call very reasonable indeed, if those of extraordinary maids-of-all-work
are not generally more unreasonable than those offered in the subjoined
advertisement extracted from a Scotch newspaper:—
WANTED.
TEACHER, for the Ladies' Seminary, Portsoy, capable of Teachin
English Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, Geography, History an
Music, as well as Knitting and Plain and Ornamental Needle-work. The Teacher
must have a Government certificate of Merit, or be pººl. to be examined by
HER MAJESTY's Inspector for such Certificate. Salary—Eight Guineas per Annum.
Immediate application, inclosing Testimonials, to be º: either to the Rev. P.

Becember 27, 1856.
Here are ten branches of knowledge to be taught, and a proposal to
allow a remuneration for teaching them, at the rate of 16s. a-year each
to the educational maid-of-all-work. Is “Ladies' Seminary” an euphe-
mism f Does the F. really mean ragged school? Or is the above
announcement to be considered as a piece of Scotch practical “wut,”
put forth by some humorous party desirous of ridiculing the parsi-
mony practised towards teachers at the establishment in question; a
parsimony really extreme, but of which the terms, stated are a jocose
ºxaggeration? If not, is not, there a mistake in the statement that a
Government Certificate of Merit” will be required of the teacher?
Surely the document intended to be specified—under the idea that a
certain *. has been pursued by Government with female equally
with male convicts, and that a reformed lady-thief might be willing to
accept any terms as a teacher—must be a Ticket-of-Leave.

that I anticipated the result.
“SERJEANT BALLANTINE. Felony is considered a ‘better leg' than
misdemeanour. We always try the gravest charge first.”
Thus it appears that the legs of the law are felony
and misdemeanour. The observation may, perhaps,
ermitted that misdemeanour and felony are the law's
ower limbs. Here the question arises, if felony is the
better leg of the law, is it a right leg P. By parity #º:

coming, and he will be prepared to make a match with any man, at any weight. If
Young Dizzy, or THE DERby PET, mean fighting, now is their time. The B.-H.

ON DITs.-We understand that a mill may shortly be expected between Dr Lione,
of the Belgian fancy, and Bobby PEEL, in consequence of the latter's chaffing at
the Adderley Park Harmonic meeting a few weeks since. Bobby ought to be careful

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS, DURDEN'S APPEAL TO PARLIAMENT,
So Parliament’s about to lay their heads together for improvements.
Ah, if I was about their House I’d quicken their slow dawdling
movements,) - - -
They’re fonder far of talk than work, just like a pack of idle hussies,
What I wish is that they’d reform them good-for-nothing omnibuses.
They’ve º in Parliament to sit with comfort to them"elves and
others:
I wish they 'd think about our seats, considering their poor old mothers.
Get out with all your education; don't tell me about your learnin',
Unless you give me what I want, and find a body space to turn in.
First as concernin' of the doors, they’re all of them a deal, too narrow,
To shoot one's self through holes like them, a person 'ought to be an ||
arrow,
One’s figure should be like a hoop between the sides of 'em to trundle;
And there’s an umbereller too, besides a band-box and a bundle.
You bump on this and 'tother side; against the . you blunder,
Which º 'em to grunt and growl, and makes 'em look as black as
thunder :
And then you sits down where you can by means of pushin' and of
squeezin', - - - -
With some one's elbow in your ribs which keeps a worritin’ and teazin’.
With knees to knees and feet to feet of people facin’ opposite you,
You sits in misery and pain, the whilst i. looks as if they’d bite you;
There’s always somebody inside that pisons you with gin and onions,
And sure as any one comes in, he tramples on your corns and bunions.
Their boots too hitches in your gownd, and what’s the use of axin'
pardon,
When, for the mischief they have done, there's mone of them as cares
a farden P - - -
They *: your band-boxes all in, your bonnet that’s inside they
atters, -
And ’tis destruction for your clothes, reduced to rags and dirt and
tatters.
Then, when you’ve reached your journey’s end, and squeezed as flat as
a baked apple,
'Stead of St. Paul's Churchyard you find they’ve took you on unto
Whitechapel. - -
They tº: you you should look alive, whereas you look half dead more
often,
And what can you expect, confined, as I may say, within a coffin?
I’ve got no patience with the way in which them there conductors
serve us,
And all that scramblin' on the roof must make a timid creature
nervous ; -
I often wish I was a man for to give vent in oaths and cusses,
Which is the sentiments 1 feels when travellin' in omnibuses.
I do hope Parliament will take the case into consideration,
And put the omnibuses right—at least do something for the nation.
But I'm afeard they’ll waste their time on foreign fiddlestick discus-
Slons,
Which never comes to any good; and what I sayis, Drat they Russians.
A SEALED BOOK FOR SLAVES.
STRINGENT, measures are in contemplation for the H. of
keeping the black portion of the public in Tennessee in subjection to
the white. # others it is proposed that the negroes shall no
longer be permitted to attend their own meeting-houses, but if they
go to any places of worship at all, shall be limited to the ordinary
churches. One additional precaution should be taken in order to
obviate any, undesirable influence which may be exerted upon the
slaves by religious services. In the various churches and chapels of
Tennessee, the ministers should be º prohibited from reading a
certain portion of the book of Exodus. The slaves of Tennessee will
not be edified, to the satisfaction of their masters, by hearing the
account, narrated in that history, of the deliverance } other slaves
from Egyptian bondage.
Keys for Queer Characters.
MANY simple-minded persons may wonder why the officers of the
2nd Life Guards should think it necessary to be provided with golden
latch-keys. A golden key will often procure the admission of a scamp
into a decent house, but we do not imagine that anybody at present
holding a commission in that t corps can want such a {} or such
a reason.
A NEW LITERARY FUND,
MR. PUNgH was pleased to read, in one of last week's papers, that
a Scottish Literary Fund, for the relief of distressed authors, is in
course of formation. Ali honour to the promoters, and all success to
the undertaking.
As it is, in its infancy, and youth is liable to err, Mr. Punch can
conceive the possibility of this Literary Fund falling into a few errors
and therefore he has thrown together some hints, which, if considered
before the rules and regulations of the New Fund be finally settled,
may render them more suited to their purpose, and the character of
the proposed charity, than they might be if modelled upon other
principles.
. When a gentleman, who has pursued the most honourable of avoca.
tions, is compelled to apply for assistance, do not make it necessary
or him to bring a number of witnesses to testify that he is not a liar.
Have some men on your board who are acquainted with the literary
world, or who, if unacquainted with the º can quietly ascertain
who and what he is. Spare poverty the additional humiliation of
going round to its acquaintances to glean testimonials.
You will, of course, feel it your duty to inquire minutely into the
antecedents of every applicant, but if you i. discover that twenty
years earlier somebody gave him twenty pounds, let your official be
authorised to relieve his immediate wants, while he is, endeavouring
to sº natural desire to know what became of all that money.
As a rule, if he alleges that he is starving, assist him within a month
or so from his application.
Qf course, if you have any idea that anybody else has an intention of
assisting him, save }. own money. But be tolerably sure that such
a thing has been at least talked about.
If he be recommended to you by other gentlemen of character,
you may as well accept their testimony, and not insult them by prose-
cuting inquiries to ascertain whether they have told the truth.
Do not impose upon the poor man the i. task of sending
you copies of all the works he has ever published, but let his applica.
tion be referred to somebody who is acquainted with literature, or can
find out a book by the aid of the catalogue in your University library.
If these, and some other suggestions which occur to Mr. Punch, and
which he will take another opportunity of offering, be regarded in the
spirit in which º: made, Scotland will have reason to be satisfied
with her Literary d.

TRANQUILLITY ON WASHING DAY.
AN American invention for washing linen and other clothes has been
for some time, in highly successful operation. The American Patent
Washing Machine has certain peculiar advantages which ladies who
wash at home will not fail to appreciate. One of the principal of these
is that it consumes no gin, beer, and tea; requires no meals, and does
not walk, off with any broken victuals. Moreover, it neither gossips
nor scolds, and it contrives to wash without involving itself in hot
water with the servants; in all which respects it has immense advan-
tages over the ordinary laundress.

PUNCH'S PREROGATIVE OF MERCY.
MR. PUNCH was induced, by misinformation, to believe
that MR. S.Nooks was guilty of shameful and scandalous
conduct. Under the influence of this erroneous belief,
Mr. Punch held up, MR. S.Nooks to ridicule and contempt
in a caricature, and abused and vilified him in an article
breatling indignation mingled with scorn, by which means
he inflicted severe suffering upon MR. S.Nooks, and in
addition destroyed the character of that gentleman, who is
now, º unable to obtain employment, and likely
to starve. . . Under these circumstances, Mr. Punch, having
discovered that the injury inflicted by him upon the sup-
posed offender was inflicted on an innocent man, has been
graciously pleased to grant MR. S.Nooks a free pardon.
EPITAPH FOR THE “WAR 9d.”—Par Wobiscum. /
THE QUEEN’S BALL PRACTICE.
ON Tuesday last a very full meeting of ladies, wives and connections
of Members of Parliament, was held at WILLIs’s Rooms, for the pur-
pose of considering and meeting the charges made by, MR. Nobuck,
at Liverpool, in the matter of the QUEEN’s balls. The hon. gentle.
man had roundly accused the wives of the Commons with a desire to
trample the interests of the country under their feet, by dancing at HER
MAJESTY's balls. The press it was understood, was to be inexor-
ably excluded; , but thanks to the facilities offered by crinoline, our
reporter smuggled himself in, and took his notes without the least
Inconvenlence.
The HoN, MRs. DoublechIN (Member for Downyshire, in right of
her husband) was, after some contention, called to the chair. She
said, she would use the fewest possible words—she always did.
MR. Nobuck, who was certainly no gentleman (cheers), had accused
the wives of M.P's with magging their husbands—if he didn't use the
word, he, meant ging; for she knew, what nagging was—with
º: their husbands to sell themselves that their wives might dance
at the QUEEN’s balls. For her part, she had no need to nag her
husband on that head. Her birth and station secured her tickets.
But as everybody wasn't on the visiting-list of HER GRAcious
MAJESTY, she couldn't refuse her assistance to her less fortunate
sisters (Faint applause).
MRs. MINCEM, M.P. for Marabout, moved the first resolution.
MR. NQBUCK-she believed that was the creature's name—had
#. insulted all the lady-members of the House of Commons. He
ad accused them of a desire to turn their husbands round when and
how they pleased. That person—she would not call him a gentleman
—altogether wanted the milk of human kindness. Milk! his wet-
nurse must have been a tame porcupine. He must have cut his teeth
upon a stick of horse-radish, and been weaned upon a nutmeg-grater.
wd cheers.). That was her opinion. And more than that, she had
made it the opinion of her husband.
MRs. SUNNYMOUTH, M.P. for º: seconded the resolution,
and observed that Mr. Nobuck, in his gross and ºf..." charge,
had said, “MR.A. is affected through MRs. A.” She hoped so; for
where there was no such affection, there was an end of the
beauty and utility of the marriage-tie, (Loud cheers.) . She wouldn't
ive a pin for a woman as a wife, who couldn't affect her husband.
hat were husbands for, if not to be affected? (Cheers.) , English-
women were not household slaves. An English wife was the better
half, if not the better three-fourths of her husband. Well, what said
this M.R. Nobuck?., “MRs. A. wants to go to the QUEEN’s ball?”
And why not? What more natural? ... (Loud cries of Hear.) Why
shouldn’t she go to the Queen's ball? But there were some men
who would make their wives prisoners, and their houses gaols. Very
well. “MRs. A. wants to go to the §. ball. The way to get
there is to make MR. A. vote with the Minister, and when he votes with
the Minister, she receives the invitation!” And why not?, (Cries of
“Why not, indeed?”) ; For her part she never troubled herself—so
that her husband did his º side he was of Still, if for
instance, she had a longing for such a thing as the QUEEN’s ball,
she did think it, a little hard that any MR. Nobuck should come
between her and her proper influence with her own lawful, wedded
husband. If a woman hadn't a right to her own husband's vote, there
was an end to the holy state of marriage. If such horrid º: as
MR. Nobuck's were to find their way to families, people would soon
go º to the state of savages. She would sit down by seconding the
resolution.
MRs. WEATHERPRoor, M.P. for Adamant (the lady was slightly
lame) said, that for her part, she thought MR, NQBUCK a very sensible
and very independent gentleman. She thought dancing a vain accom-
plishment, and had never danced in her life. (Hisses). She was, not
easily to be put down. ... She would speak her mind, if she stayed there
all night. (Cries of “Well, I’m sure /* and “Did you ever?”). If the
wives of M.P.'s would look -
“Fiddlestick /*)—if they would only remember, how Porţia stabbed
herself as an experiment—(“More silly she ſ”)—how the Amazonians
maimed themselves that they might shoot the better—how CHARLOTTE
CoRDAY sacrificed herself to rid her country of a monster and a tyrant
—here the interruption became so vehement, and so sustained, that
MRs. WEATHERPRoof, with a grim smile of defiance, sat down; not,
however, until the Hon. Chairwoman had promised to put MRs. W’s.
resolution. It was to the following effect:-"Itesolved, that, with a
view to meet and defeat the charge of MR. NoBuck, the meeting

pledge themselves to bring up all their future daughters on the Chinese
principle of dwarfing, the left foot.” The resolution, not seconded,
"as met with the loudest expressions of contempt and scorn.
Finally, the meeting broke up, having come to the unanimous reso-
lution never on any occasion or any pretence to attend HER MAJESTY's
State Balls, ... ." § º
Some amendment was talked of with respect to husbands; but after
consideration, given up as hopeless.
HE third “Session” of this Club was
celebrated on Wednesday last by a
dinner at Crickett's, Hotel, Grass-
hopper Lane, City, when a numerous
attendance of members took place.
MR. PAUL DE CockRochE, the Presi-
dent, occupied the chair, faced by MR. BUGSBY, the Honorary
Secretary:
After dinner and the usual loyal healths, - -
The President proposed the toast of the evening, “Success to the
Metropolitan Fancy Black-Beetle Club.” He met the Society, he
said, with the greatest pleasure, as it was to announce that they grew
stronger and stronger year by year. The club had been called into
existence, by the demand for some association, which should combine
the harmlessness and innocence of the Fancy Rabbit Club, Fancy
Pigeon Club, Fancy. Cat Club, and Fancy, Guinea-Pig Club, with an
economy, that should place the object within the reach of all. Those
clubs had their organization, their reports were regularly published in
the sporting papers, and the speeches of their members, and the prizes
the .# were duly recorded. Why should not the Black-Beetle
Club aspire to similar distinction? The Beetle was a beautiful object
(cheers), and capable of cultivation to any extent. If it had not
lopping ears like the Rabbit, it had a great many more legs to
.. up. The glossy hue of its back was as lustrous as the breast
of the vaunted Pigeon, and as, for the Cat, it excelled her, in noble
and amiable qualities, for while that ferocious beast and her cruel
offspring º devour black-beetles, their only revenge was to dis-
agree with their murderers and make them thin, while he had seldom
or never, heard of a beetle eating a cat. As for the Guinea-Pig, he
should blush to compare their little favourite with that tawdry and
tail-less, rat, that “woppy docky,” if he might borrow a rural term,
|...} Ablack-beetle was within everyone's reach; it was a silent and
omestic animal; its keep was inexpensive, and it supplied the means
of inoffensive recreation to its rearer, just as was done by the rabbit,
the pigeon, the kitten, and the fliº, He was proud to say, for
himself, that he had introduced the beetle into every house he had
occupied (and circumstances had compelled his frequent change of
residence) for twenty years. (Cheers.)
The beetles were then produced, and, the prizes awarded. A silver
Scarabaeus, modelled from that found in the great Pyramid, was
lººd to MR. TRAPPER, of Kensington, for the biggest and finest
etle.
MR. TRAPPER. returned thanks, and observed that if they could

THE HUSBAND'S OWN FAULT.
“MR. PUNCH,
- “As a young man, and an enthusiastic admirer of those lovely
beings who constitute the fairer portion of humanity, and afford models
to artists for the delineation of celestial spirits, permit me—I will not
say to ... ." question, the accuracy of a i. sition occasionall
either made or implied in your otherwise in . columns, wit
respect to those charming creatures. I allude to the surely erroneous
idea that ladies can ever, possibly, except in the very rare case of un-
happy marriages, in which the parties have no regard for each other,
put their husbands to any inconvenient expense for millinery, and other
dress, Beyond decent and comfortable clothing, a marriedlady cannot
possibly want any more dresses, or ornaments, than her husband is
inclined to give her. If she wants a new bonnet or shawl, it must be
for the sake of pleasing him, and not somebody else, or other people
than him. What can any indy, happily married, care about attracting
admiration at balls and evening parties P. Her husband is the only
man by whom she can like to be looked at. If ever she expresses a
desire for this or that article of wear or ornament, without waiting for
him to suggest the purchase thereof, that desire is expressed on her
part, by, reason of an impulse derived sympathetically from his own
mind, through the mysterious union of their two souls. He thinks
how beautiful she would look in it, pictures her in it mentally, and
admires her in imagination. She instantly becomes cognisant of his
idea and emotion; and hence her wishful exclamation in reference to
the article. “How remarkably well that bonnet would become my
little wife,” is the thought of the masculine mind. Transmitted into
the feminine, it finds utterance in the rapturous observation, “What a
duck of a bonnet !” When a man finds his wife's dressmaker's bill
too heavy for his circumstances, he himself is, in the great majority of
cases, the only person to blame. As he w down the street, he
should keep his eyes on the middle of it, and concentrate his attention
on the horses and carriages. It is by looking into the drapers' and
jewellers' and bonnet-makers' shops, and allowing the objects in their
windows to inflame his imagination, that he puts the passion for them
into his wife's head. Qtherwise, she would not care a button for such
frivolities—indeed would much less regard them than a button which
she might enjoy the pleasure of sewing on her husband's wristband.
I dare say young unmarried ladies may, rather generally, trouble their
papas by excess in finery. They have an object to attain, by display:
a wife can have none—beyond that of rendering herself still more
beautiful, still more captivating, still more attractive, still more
recious, to the husband whom she is not content with having secured,
}. whose affection for her she strives to increase continually. ... Oh!
Mr. Punch, I hope. I do not utter, under the influence of too fervid
sentiment, a belief which I shall one day find erroneous—when, I
declare my conviction that, were I a married man, I should regard the
amount of my wife's dress bills, as the measure, in direct ratio, of her
love and affection for your humble servant, “STREPHON.”
*...* At least, STREPHON will find that, the more money his wife
spends in dress, the dearer she will be to him.
AN ANSWER WON'T OBLIGE.
A CoRRespondent, who, if he had any regard for the fitness of
things, would have signed himself a Bedlamite, or dated from Ban-
well, writes to know if he be justified in saying that the inhabitants of
Sheerness live there only out of Sheerness-essity.

XCHANGE.-The Advertiser, who dislikes popularity,
wishes to EXCBANGE his Living, in consequence of its rising too
rapidly into importance for his taste. It is a Perpetual Curacy. In-
come over £200 per annum, together with a modern house and good
garden. Population, about 2500. Excellent Schools, both Endowed
and National. Climate healthy and bracing. Wanted, a quiet Agri-
cultural Willage. The Sea-coast preferred. Full particulars requested.
The name of this clergyman we conceive to be JAQUEs;
the, REVEREND MR. JAquEs. In default of a Forest of
Arden wherein to revel in the pleasures of solitude, the
New Forest in Hampshire may perhaps be suggested to
the reverend gentleman as a locality wherein he may be
likely to get suited with a living. It is situated near the
coast, and there is a particular spot in it named Stony
Cross, where MR. JAQUEs will find as many sermons to
study as there are stones with sermons in them. In the
New Forest MR. JAQUEs will be able, if he likes, to esta-
blish a hermitage, into which it will be easy for him to
convert the abode of some badger, by enlarging it. His
devotion is evidently of the contemplative rather than the
active sort, and in the sylvan and subterraneous retreat,
which we have M. for him, it will be in his power to
pursue continual meditation. If ever he should experience
the want of something to do, there will be the e for
him to preach to, as ST. ANTONY preached to the fishes.
The Church of England has not as yet produced an
anchorite: the REVEREND MR. JAQUEs will, perhaps supply
the deficiency. If he chooses, now and then to give the
STANLEYs and LEEs, and other gipsies who will be his
fellow foresters, the benefit of his exhortations, he can.
But, perhaps, the ascetic life may not be eable to the
reverend advertiser, and the quiet desired by him may be
simply freedom from disturbance, and tranquillity in the
enjoyment of port wine. Possibly he merely wishes to ex-
change the cure for the sinecure of souls, and a sphere of
usefulness for a situation of inutility. His parishioners
ill be sorry to lose him; for it is evident that he has
involuntarily rendered himself popular among them, inso-
much that the popularity which he has acquired displeases
him. What a difference there is between one man and
another! What does the REVEREND MR. SPURGEoN think
of a divine who dislikes popularity?
§
THE ART OF POULTRY KEEPING,
Considered from an Aldermanic point ºf view.
JUDGING from the show at Sydenham, the mania for keepin
poultry seems as widely spread as that for keeping a perambulator, an
É. poultry maniacs appear so lost to reason that they do not
hesitate from designating their pursuit as an “Art.” This we learn from
a treatise headed with the title with which we head this article, and
we suppose we next may hear of the “Art” of keeping pigs, and the
“Science” of the cow-stall. It is a pity though, we think, that the pro-
fessors of the “Art” do not inculcate a sounder view of it than that
which seems in general to be accepted by its votaries. Their main
failing, as we think, is their adherence to the fallacy that “fine feathers
make fine birds;” their aim in breeding being for the most part rather
ornament than usefulness, an attempt to please the eye rather than the
alate. We believe that fully two-thirds of the prizes gained at
ydenham, were awarded either for the plumage or the shape; and
indeed the epithets by which the breeds are principally distinguished
are a sufficient indication of the animus of the breeders. Being no
fanciers, and in ignorance of its merits, we should hesitate ourselves to
buy a “Speckled Hamburgh,” in the fear of finding that its flesh was
speckled also; and we have a still greater contempt for those pre-
posterously prefixed breeds, the “gold-laced" and the “silver-pen-
cilled,” as though in any state of nature a fowl could wear gold ſace,
or carry a silver pencill
Now as chickens are born for something more than merely to be
looked at, we think, this cultivation of the outward fowl to the com-
parative neglect of the inward to be as great a waste of pains and time
as that which forms a part of any human foppishness.
To our view a fowl never looks so well as when it’s stripped and
dressed; and were we elected to the judge-ship of a poultry . We
should insist upon enjoying the privilege which is accorded at a fruit
one-namely, not merely of yiewing the competing birds, but per-
sonally tasting them. No fair exhibitress ever should persuade us
that her Dorkings were “sweet things” until we had eaten a slice to
rove their saccharinity; nor would we pronounce her Bantams to be
‘precious pets,” unless we by our palate had assayed their richness.
Such epithets as “juicy-fleshed” or “tender-legged” would sound far
sweeter in, our ears than “brassy-winged” and “ fºlden pºgled.”
hard metallic attributes which set our teeth on edge to speak of
In the present misdirected taste, one of the “beauties” of the
Spanish fowls is the largeness of their lobes, which in the prize-birds
we are told, almost prevent their seeing. Such ophthalmia as this would
find no favour in our eyes, although º We .# regard with
#. lenience that kind of blindness which is caused by overfatness.
o the coxcombry of cocks'combs we should never give encouragement;
and, instead of valuing a bird for being “double-crested,” our highest
rize should be awarded to the man who introduced to us a breed of
ouble-breasted!
A TUBULAR BRIDGE OF FASHION.
WHEN the Crinoline inflated petticoats go out of fashion, as go they
rapidly must, what become of the innumerable air-tubes, for
thousands and thousands of miles of it will be suddenly thrown upon
the market? They may do for submarine telegraphs, as the electric
wires could easily be carried through them; or there may be an
opening for them in the way of life preservers and swimming belts, the
price, of which will doubtlessly fall to an alarming extent in the
º: of the Docks? Or, perhaps, some enterprising modistes
buy up the entire quantity of cast-off pipes, and stitching them
together, run . a kind of speaking-tube between London and Paris
so that the smallest change in the fashions may be communicated all
the way through, from one capital to another, almost in a breath?

LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EB. 3RD, 1857. Tuesday. , Parliament reassembled.
HER MAJESTY was pleased to have Her own gracious
reason for non-appearance, and LoRD CHANCELLOR
CRAN worth read the Speech for Her. Its contents
were as follows:–
Glad to see you.
Treaty of Paris settled.
Prussia v. Switzerland ditto, I hope.
Have cut BoMBA. . -
Central America will be all right.
Am sworn friends with the KING OF SIAM.
Have walked into the Persians.
Have pitched into the Chinese. -
Estimates to be as economical as possible.
Law amendments to be proposed.
Currency question must come up.
People content. Trade flourishing.
Soft Soap.
Short prayer.
The bottle of Parliamentary eloquence was naturally opened by
getting LoRD CoRk out of the ñº. and LoRD AIRLIE was also a very
airlie speaker. LoRD DERBY, in the stereotype phrase of opposition
professed extreme disgust with the meagreness of the Speech, an
scoffed a good deal at Ministerial foreign *}; which foºp
CLARENDon defended, intimating that the other Earl talked ridi-
culously, not having read the documents affecting the questions he
discussed. EARL GREY stood up for the Persians, and although LoRI,
GRANVILLE assured him that they had been served quite right, and
LoRD BRough AM (wishing, however, to know more) was perfectly
satisfied with the conduct of Government in the matter, GREY insisted
on taking a division, and was beaten by 45 to 12.
The Chancellor announced that among the Law amendments to be
introduced, one affected the Ecclesiastical Courts, another the law of
Marriage, and a third Breaches of Trust, under the penal provisions of
which last act Mr. Punch hopes that Ministers will be brought, if
either of the two other bills should be once more abandoned. .
In the Commons MR, HAYTER (the whipper-in ve notice of
some more Government bills, one of which regarde portation,
and another the establishment of Reformatory Schools. Soun
well. Transport our adult offenders, and reclaim our young ones, and
crime will rapidly diminish. Mr. Punch wishes he could believe that
the new measures will be framed upon a national scale. At the present
writing he believes nothing of the kind.
The debate on, the Address was not a bad one. The echoes in
uniform having subsided, MR. Dish AELI delivered a long and enter-
taining invective against Ministers for everything they had done or not
done since he had last the pleasure of vituperating them. His chief

there was no such treaty, and assailed Dizzy with Rabelaisian abuse,

replied that he “had seen the treaty.” Now the question is, who is
to be believed? Is PAM a Sham, or ought the other's name to be
written in future–DisRAE-LIE * † for the consideration of
the universe, let us proceed to note that MR. GLAnstone assailed
LoRD PALMERSTON as a quarrelsome person, and applied himself to
the Income-Tax question, on which (and, we suspect, on some other
matters) he means to lend his honeyed eloquence and valuable vote to
HER MAJESTY's º. He said, neatly enough, that the people
of England, though impatient of taxation, are . of expenditure;
but if he would have the extreme goodness, to point out in what
practical way BROWN and Jon Es can check Government expenditure
under our present system, those gentlemen would be very much, in-
debted to him, and would much prefer being so to being indebted to
the tax-collector; However, the fight on the Tax is to come off at no
distant date, and a good slice of the Tax, is to come off also. We
advise the Nimble Ninepence to be as nimble as possible in getti
away. LoRD John RussBLL expressed general dissatisfaction wit
most things, and MR. MILNER GIBSON made some protests to which
nobody paid any attention. SIR John PAKINGTON got LoRD PAL-
MERStoN to alter the address so as to avoid committing the House to
any ºn as to the China business, and then the Address was
agreed to.

mentioned that cotton was being satisfactorily cultivated in Bombay.
The deficiency in i. has been attributed to the immense quantities
which, whenever Indian grievances come up, are found to be stuffe
into the ears of the authorities. The House appointed its Kitchen
Committee, and departed to the domestic lunch.
Thursday. In the House of Lords a piteous spectacle was afforded.
Poor LQRD CARDIGAN, who has merited and obtained so much casti-
gation that humane people are now inclined tolet him alone, has found
a new enemy in one of his own order, Major the Honourable SoMERSET
CALTHORPE. In a book on the Črimean Cam jº. the Major, a
relative of LoRD RAGLAN, has, according to the Earl, “maligned and
defamed” him. LORD CARDIGAN, after an historical resumé of duelling,
a touching reference to his own trial for felony, and an implied lamen-
tation that it was impossible for him to call CALTHORPE out, stated that
e in vain sought reparation from that individual, and therefore
had asked the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE to bring the Major to a Court-
martial. The Duke refused to be bored with such bosh, having real
business on his hands, and so Lord CARDIGAN was driven to ask LoRD
PANMURE whether such conduct as MAJOR CALTHORPE's was right
and proper, IoHD PANMURE, in reply, blew him, up for turning the
House of Lords into a grievance tribunal, and told him that he had
received the thanks of Parliament for his services, and those were an
answer to all attacks. The Major has, of course, written to the papers,
reiterating his charges, and especially reminding IORD CARDIGAN that
his Lordship was retreating from the Balaklava Charge while his men
were advancing, and that he rides too well to lay the blame upon his
orse.
In the Commons MR. SpoonER gave notice that his attack on May-
nooth would be renewed in a fortnight. There seems no hope of
escape. . If he lived at Notting Hill, or some other retired district—
but no, he resides close to the House, and in the thick of gaslights
and policemen; besides, it is impossible to regard the Garotte as
constitutional, even in an extreme case like this. Perhaps, in the
meantime, some beautiful young Catholic lady may fall in love with
him and convert him to the old faith, We see no other chance for the
nation, unless this atrocious weather should give him a touch of
bronchitis, which we heartily hope it will not, much as we detest the
annual squabble he raises. There was nothing else worth note, except
that a Select Committee was appointed to consider what is to be done
with the Hudson's Bay Company, which, under old charters, keeps
colonisation out of an enormous piece of our American º; 111
order to preserve the animals that yield the furs in which the Company
his great wild beast preserve will have to be enfranchised.
Friday. A few of the Lords met, exchanged a quarter-of-an-
hour's chat, and separated. About the º thing they did was to
receive a petition from Margate against the Income-Tax. It is a little
§." that ..". robbery should not find favour with the
Margate lodging-house keepers, especially when it is connected with
enormous lying.
the Commons, SIR CoRNEwALL LEwis explained that in regard
to the Persian war, JoHN BULL and JoHN CoMPANY go Yorkshire;
but as regards the Chinese affair, BULL stands Sammy. Reducing this
explanation to ar English, it means that the first outlay is shared
equally between England and the East Indian Company, but that the
country defrays the second. However, as the Company owe us money,
we pay them nothing this year. Along debate then followed upon the
Currency Question, on which, as everybody understands it, no inform:
ation is necessary beyond, the statement, that Government, instead of
coming forward with a Bill upon the subject of the Bank Charter, refer

the matter to a, committee, in order to escape trouble, and, respon-
sibility. After this, MR. Low E brought in a Bill for abolishing the
passing tolls claimed by four harbours, one of which is Ramsgate. As
this watering-place is now to be taken into the hands of Government,
it will be open to any Member to put, during the bathing season, such
a notice as this on the paper:-
“MR. PUDoR to ask Wiscount PAIMERSTON whether it is true that
the Ladies at Ramsgate sit among the Bathing-Machines, to the em-
barrassment of the Masculine Bathers; and whether the noble Wiscount
is prepared to take measures for checking so objectionable a practice.
o to move for a return of the names and ages of the Ladies who are
found on that part of the Ramsgate Sands.”
A COURT ALMONER EXTRAORDINARY.
HE Royal Household Books of
the Middle Ages contain, en-
tries of expenses, among which
are occasionally found items of
this descriptiºn-" Pd ye Di-
well. viii"; ” that is to say,
paid somebody eightpence for
personating the devil. in a
“mystery” or “morality: ”
the palace, theatricals of the
period. Eightpence does not
seem a very handsome remu-
neration for playing the devil;
but money was more valuable
then than it is now; and per-
haps the Lord Chamberlain or
Master of the Revels, or who.
eyer it was that had to regulate
the salaries of the actors, did
jº give “y” Divell” his
ule.
It appears that, under.ex-
isting arrangements at Wind-
sor Castle, the due, perhaps,
but certainly no more than
the due, is awarded to the
player. That such is the
Report:—
case is indicated by the following Police
“THE WINDson CASTLE THEATRICALs AND THE Pooh-Box.-MR. JAMEs Rogers,
the well-known Comedian at the Olympic Theatre, waited on MR. Elliott, and
handed to his worship the sum of 13s. 4d., with the following note:-
“Sir-Allow me to present to the poor-box the enclosed, 13s. 4d, being the
amount I received for performing at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening last.
“— ELLIOTT, Esq. “I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, JAMEs Rogers,
“MR. Rogers requested his worship would, with his usual kindness, acknowledge
This small donation º the usual way, upon which MR. Elliott said he would give
him a receipt for it, but MR. Rogers replied that that was not necessary.
“It . appear that the restriction of such members of the Olympic company
as performed before the QUEEN and Court on Wednesday night last to the payment
of their mere night's salary, has given rise to some gossip and grumblings amongst
the profession.”
Polonius at Windsor Castle does not take the advice of Hamlet in
the matter of dealing with the players. When the Prince of Denmark
desires the old courtier to use tº. professional ladies and gentlemen
well, Polonius replies by promising to use them according to their
desert; whereupon the princely Dane rejoins :-
“Odd's bodkin, man, better: Use every man after his desert, and who should
'scape whipping ! Use them after your own honour and dignity: The less they
deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.”
The Windsor Polonins has altogether disregarded these instructions,
unless, indeed, MR. Rogers and his fellow comedians may, with reason,
consider that he has, in a sense, fulfilled the last one. If he has, how-
ever, done the actors bare justice, has he done so much as that to the
dramatic authors whose pieces have been performed before the Court?
Have they received any ºf.” whatever ? -
Polonius may perhaps hold that the sum of 13s. 4d. is a royal reward,
inasmuch as it is more than a noble one: being, in fact, twice as much
as a Noble. He may also contend that MR. Rogers had no reason to
be dissatisfied with his hire, since, marry, the º made to him,
amounting to 13s. 4d., constituted an acknowle gment that he was an
actor who had made his Mark.
Prima Facie Evidence.
No man carries his business in his face so unmistakeably as BRASSY.
He is a lawyer and a bill-discounter, and has a parchment skin and a
bottle-nose. He takes, snuff, too, in a greedy grasping manner, as
though it were a client he was pinching, and he would not be satisfied
with anything short of cent-per-cent
NO JOKE FOR A JURY.
THE wisdom of our ancestors was remarkably exhibited in a matter
which occurred the other day at the Central Criminal Court. A j
not being able to agree upon their verdict in a certain case, were locke
up all night. The next morning they were brought into court, not
having come, and not being likely to come, to an agreement—wherefore
they were discharged. e fact is that the provision made by the
wisdom of our ancestors for ensuring their unanimity was practically
nullified. According to the report:-
“A jury in a criminal case, in the present state of the law, are not allowed to
have any refreshment or fire, with the exception of candle-light; but with a view
to remedy, as far as was practicable, the inconvenience to which they must neces-
sarily be subjected by being confined in such cruel weather without any necessary
comforts, MR. UNDER-SHERIFF CRosley, with the sanction of the Court, directed
that the jury should be placed in the dining-room, in which thore had been two
fires the whole of the evening, and a great number of lamps were also placed
in it, and this to some extent increased the temperature.”
The consequence was, that the jury came to no agreement. Had
they been, in the spirit of our ancestors' wisdom, confined in an atmo-
.." of 26°, which, in the absence of artificial heat, would have been
about the temperature at which they would have had to conduct their
deliberations, possibly they would have soon arrived at a conclusion.
Cold and hunger together would perhaps have succeeded. Hunger
alone was tried. The report in continuation states that:—
“The jurymen earnestly entreated to be allowed to have some refreshment, but
they were informed that the law was inexorable, and that the Court could not
legally grant their request.”
Mere starvation failed. The jurymen should have been frozen as well
as starved. It is true that they might have set to at sparring to main-
tain their animal heat, and have occupied themselves in punching one
another's heads instead of laying them together. This exercise, how-
ever, might have been compatible with a determination, for they might
have fought out the question of the prisoner's guilt or innocence. #.
practice of freezing and starving a jury into some decision is one
example of that wisdom of our ancestors whereof the peine forte et dure
was another—only the former instance of wisdom is more wonderful
than the latter–for the idea of overcoming obstimacy by the infliction
of pain can be understood; but that of convincing the mind by the
same method, passes all understanding. , Besides, ife prisoner pressed
to death may peradventure be guilty, whereas, the starved and frozen
jury are not even accused of any offence. Qf these two illustrations of
the wisdom of our ancestors we have abolished the less striking, but
we retain the more stupendous.
A LION LIEUTENANT,
. A SMARTLY written account of a Staffordshire Yeomanry Ballis given
in a recent number of the Wolverhampton News. The writer has studied,
not unsuccessfully, the impertinencies of American ball-critics, and he
discourses with the most unhesitating freedom upon the personal ad-
vantages and disadvantages of the ladies and gentlemen present.
However, if the Staffordshire people like that sort of thing, it is their
business. We propose to extract one sample only, for the delectation
of mankind generally:-
“The great hero of the evening, however, was a genuine cherubim of the 10th
Hussars, accompanied by LIEUT.T M-, of the Staffordshire militia, just returned
from the Cape of Good Hope, and who engrafts on the gentlemanly deportment of
his father all the ease and magnanimity of the African lion.”
Simply pointing out to the ingenious writer of the above that the
word “cherubim " is plural, and means cherubs (it is perhaps too
much to expect Hebrew from Wolverhampton), we should like to see
an explanation of his description of the gallant Lieutenant from the
Cape. At present our zoology is at fault.
A Cure for Crinoline.
The young men of fashionable society propose to form themselves
into a combination against the gigantic nuisance of Crinoline. This
confederacy will style itself the Anti-Dancing-League; its members all
engaging with each other not to contract any engagement to dance on
.# evening at any party whatsoever with any young lady, or with any
old woman, who wears those preposterous skirts which incommode
everybody about her for a considerable distance, and render the
performance of a waltz or a polka, with the most eligible partner
an intolerable bore.
JudgMENT REvensed—If PARIs had to go over his celebra
Judgment at the present day, he would give, the Apple, not to the
prettiest woman, but to the one who had the largest Jupon.
. A JINGLE FOR THE EARs of PARLIAMENT—Precarious Income is
incommensurate with income derived from permanent property.

HOOP AND JUPE.
IN a Duchess's satin-wood wardrobe so spacious
A ball-dress with jupe en tube gave itself airs,
Taking up so much room for its volume capacious
That the skirts which hung near were deprived of their shares.
In vain angry gauzes and si H. and rustled,
And dowager moiré antiques thrust their way;
To the corner a meek French-grey satin was hustled,
And a blush-coloured crêpe on the floor swooning lay.
Now it chanced that, besides modern dresses, there slumbered
In the Duchess's wardrobe an ancient brocade;
From the days of QUEEN ANNE its first triumphs it numbered,
And under two GEORGEs a figure had made.
It had swum through a minuet at Kensington Palace,
Promenaded at Ran’lagh, been chaired through the Mall,
Stooped to go masquerading to MADAME CoRNELY's,
Then slept, till revived for the last powder-ball.
With anger the venºrable hoop had been swelling
At the modern balloon, in its over-puffed pride;
Till at length, such audacious encroachments repelling,
The soul 'neath the old whalebone ribs woke, and cried;
“How dare you, Miss FLIMsy, come thrusting your flounces

A RAT IN THE HOUSE.
IN the last number of the Quarterly there is an admirable article on
Rats; and we hope we betray no confidence when we inform the
reader that it is the production of the RIGHT HoN. BENJAMIN
DISRAELI. Indeed, to any one acquainted with the style of Coningsby,
the manner reveals itself. There is, however, one especial bit that we
must quote, inasmuch as (ºf all unconsciously) it reveals the
hopes and intentions of the Right Hon. gentleman during the present
session with a view to a return to the enjoyment of #. fatness of
office. The writer dwells upon the habits of rats; with their extra-
ordinary adaptation of means to ends in the pursuit of food. The
will, by means of a division of labour, carry eggs up-stairs; they wi
tip over a drum of figs that their brethren under the table may have a
scramble; and—writes MR. DISRAELI:—
“They will extract the cotton from a flask of Florence oil, dipping in their long
tails, and repeating the manoeuvre, until they have consumed every drop.”
Now, it is our firm belief that, in this little anecdote MR. DISRAELI
has revealed the policy of himself and party, for at least, the present
session. First, they have to make sure of the cotton. That is, they
have to get over the Manchester party; and so, by amendments on the
Army and Navy estimates, cutting them down to the quick, to damage
the Ministry. Well, we will say the cotton, is secured: 'How is #.
oil to be extracted f We acknowledge it to be the privilege of genius
to make nought of † Nevertheless, we must ask it. How
will the party manage to achieve the required elevation that, it may
introduce its tail downward into the flask? . As to the possibility of
extracting the cotton, we must not—especially after MR. MILNER
GIBSON's last address to his constituents—for a moment doubt: but
with even the cotton made sure of, how to get at the oil? ell, the
only way will be to capsize the flask, and this MR. DISRAELI will
certainly do if—he can.
AN ICE STATE OF THINGS.
WE have every disposition to avoid a pun, but we cannot help saying
that the streets last week were in an ice mess. To say the pavements
were like glass would be to use a phrase in everybody's mouth, although
nobody we suppose ever walked upon glass, or could speak from expe-
rience of the truth of the comparison. ft would perhaps be more
correct to say that the pavements were like strips of Wenham Lake
when frozen; and any one who ventured on them, even without skates,
was pretty sure to cut a figure. To persons of our weight the matter
was really far too serious for joking, or we might have remarked that
almost every one we met seemed to have come out in his slippers, and
to have lost his powers of understanding. More than once in m
a “terrific descent” from the kerbstone, we were reduced to the
expedient of the man with the cork leg, and we “clung to a lamp-post
º all in vain” to arrest our downward precipitance. And more than
twice, as we went floundering along,and finding no rest for the sole of our
boot, we should have cried out with ARCHIMEDEs, Aés uol row oró, but
that we knew we should run a risk in doing so of being taken up by a
}.} for using bad language. Even, when, regardless ºf the
ncome-Tax, we sent out for a cab, we found that it was possible to
have many a slip 'twixt our door and the step: and we rarely went
fifty yards, before the wheels, came to “Wo!”—which, as we found
generally the horse was on his ribs, we considered to be rather an
unnecessary objurgation to him. -
Much as we abominate slippery behaviour, we were compelled for a
day, or two to plead guilty to the charge, and we are conscious of
having shown symptoms of decided, unsteadiness in our walk, in life.
ishing to take steps in the right direction, we on more than one
occasion slipped away to the left: and indeed such was our back-
sliding that, if only for our moral º: sake, we were most
#; jºiced to see the thaw—which not inappropriately came on
or’sday.

SOME MORE CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF
JOHN BULL,
How Nick the poacher determined to steal a Turkey; and how John
BULL took measures to circumvent him.
At last news was brought to John BULL, that Nick the poacher,
not satisfied with wiring the runs, smoking the pheasants, and ºf
the partridges on the manor, had a design on the poultry-yard, whic
John was at great pains and cost to keep up, on one of his outlying
farms. In this poultry-yard, about this time, was an uncommon fine
breed of Turkeys, on which Nick had set his heart. First he tried
scattering nasty stuff ºf the grain with which the birds were fed,
and when it disagreed with a Turkey he would swear the bird was
sick, and that it would be a mercy to wring its neck at once, for that
sure it would never fatten. And then, thought he, I could get the
carcase—'twould be famous eating. luckily he had dropped a hint of
his design to one SEEMORE, an old servant of John }. who
...}. to fall in with Nick at an alehouse where he was drinking
and bragging as usual, so John was on his guard, and told his bailiff
on the farm, one CANNING, an ill-tempered dog as you would find in
#: º round, but a sharp fellow enough, to look well after the
urkey-pen.
The bailiff soon found out what ailed the birds, and swore that they
would soon come round if properly looked after—which was true enough.
So NICK, being foiled in this plan of his, determined to break open the
Turkey-pen and steal the birds by main force. I promise you this went
sore against his grain; for big as he was, he was an arrant sneak, and
would rather scheme and lie and plot for a year than risk a bout at
fisticuffs, at any time. So he began to make preparations for an attack
on the pen. John BULL .# Nick had been buying powder and
shot, and so was determined to be even with him. So he sent roun
his estate, and got together a posse of lusty young fellows as watchers
and had 'em iš. and put 'em under the orders of his keepers an
under-keepers. Before he sent the lads off to the farm—which was a
poor, cold, hungry bit of moorland, a long way from the mansion-house
—he called the young fellows together, and said, “Now, my lads, you
know what a determined rogue this Nick is, You’ll have to keep
watch in the day, and to lie out at nights, and take hard knocks into
the bargain. I dare say 'twill be rough work, especially as the winter
is coming on. But I’ve charged the keepers to look after your com-
fort; you shall have plenty of the best to eat and drink, and loads of
warm great-coats .." blankets; you know I like my servants to live
well, and lie warm’” (which was quite true)—and, with that, he gave
them a guinea to drink his health, and off they started for the farm,
in famous heart, with three cheers for MR. BULL, that would have
done any man good to hear.
How John BULL's keepers neglected their duty, and how the watchers
suffered. -
Well, when the lads got to the farm, they found that Nick was in
the neighbourhood sure enough, with two of his sons, thorough young
rascals as ever stretched a halter, and a band of all the rogues of his
own kith and kin and kidney that he could scrape together. He had
armed them out of the store of old guns, pistºls, and blunderbusses
which the old rascal always kept by him for his poaching jobs, and
they made no secret that they meant to fight it out, with John's
watchers. So, the keepers posted their lads all about the farm, some
upon the cold, bleak moor, where I promise you 'twas cold and
cheerless enough, and others nearer the Turkey-pen, and round the
house. Of course they kept the best quarters for themselves. The
beef, and bacon, and bread, and beer, and coffee, and tea, and sugar,
and the warm great-coats and blankets that John BULL had sent up
for the use of the watchers, they shot down all higgledy-pi i. in an
out-house, a few hundred yards from the home-stead, and locked the
door, and gave the key to an old fiddler, that was past watching or
fighting, and trusted him with the business of carrying up the victuals
and clothes to the young fellows as they might want 'em; only they
forgot to give him servants and carts and horses for the job, thoug
the poor old fellow begged hard, and swore he couldn’t do the work
without them. -
All went on well enough while the summer lasted, though the lying
out in the damp nights gave some of the lads sore colds, and!quinsies,
and bowel-complaints. However, they never complained, but stuck to
their watching like men.
But at last the cold weather came—and a terrible winter it was:
snow and sleet over head, and mud and slush under foot, and the poor
fellows that lay out o' º suffered terribly, as you may believe.
Their clothes grew thin and ragged; their shoes burst, till the poor
toes #. out all swelled and frost-bitten. It wouldn't have been so
bad if there had been more of them to take spell and spell about of
watching at night: but they were so few, and NICK's rogues so many,
that it was as, much as they could do to keep the farm, lying out
two nights in three, and never getting so much as a meal of warm
victuals, or a good blanket to wrap about them, or a new pair of boots,
or a great coat, though they were all in rags and dying of cold. The
poor old fiddler, did his best to carry 'em great coats, and blankets, and
victuals. But he was kept so short-handed, he couldn’t supply such
things as fast as they were wanted. In fact he was at his wits' end,
and it was all in vain he begged and prayed, and stormed and swore
for horses and hands and carts, and so forth. The .*. lived in the
farmhouse, warm and snug, and jeered, and cursed him for a lazy,
muddle-headed old fool, and said it was his business, and not theirs, to
feed the rascals. The head-keeper was a good kind of man enough,
but he was old and easy-tempered, and the young fellows about him
were most of 'em nephews and grandchildren of his own, and as was
only matural, he took their word for everything, and, indeed, had his
will been ever so good, he was rheumatic and stiff in the joints, and so
couldn't go about among the watchers as a younger man might have
Olle.
And when the watchers complained, he took out the lists of the
things JoHN BULL had sent up, and swore there must be plenty for
everybody; and fell, into the way of cursing the old fiddler for a fool
and a nincompoop, like the rest of the younger men about him. The
longer winter went on, the worse things grew. The out-house, where
all the victuals and clothes had been shot out, just as the carts brought
'em, was in an awful state of confusion. The old fiddler couldn't put
his hand on anything when he wanted it. The beer all turned sour
before a pint of it found its way to the watchers: and,-as for warm
drinks,—there was coffee enough, but it was green; and when it was
carried to the poor watchers, they had no fire to roast it, and no mills
to grind it, and many of 'em nothing to drink it out of, even if they
could have made it.
Meanwhile, NICK's rogues were doing their best to steal a march
upon JoHN BULL's watchers. Many a time the two came to blows
and when this happened JoHN BULL’s lads always gave a good
iſ account, of Nick's bullies, and sent 'em away with sore heads and
aching bones. But the poor fellows couldn’t fight against empty
bellies and bare backs, as well as against NICK and his poachers. So
many of 'em, at last, in sheer despair, laid down at their posts, and
fairly gave up the ghost, till there was but a handfull of 'em left to
face Nick and his iºd.

ABOVE A JOKE.
A NIGHT or two since, the EARL of CARDIGAN reminded the IIouse
of Lords that, once upon a time, for fighting a duel—
“He had the misfortune to be placed at their lordships' bar, and tried as a felon
i...; imminent danger of losing not only his property, but even his person
Everybody who remembers the manner, by which the noble Earl
obtained an acquittal; or rather, by which the case was made to break
down; must own, that, when his Lordship complains of that event, he
proves himself to be wholly insensible to a joke. There never was a
more complete farce played at the Adelphi, than the farce of the
CARDIGAN trial in the House of Lords.
DEMURRER TO MURROUGH.
A CoNTEMPORARY, desirous to be very eulogistic of MR. MURRough,
Member for lºgº enumerates that gentleman's achievements
during the past Session, and gracefully arrives at the following
climax :—
“Such a man must have withstood temptation when the Minister was buying up
mediocrities.”
There are a good many people in this world who prefer long words
to short ones, even when not quite clear about the exact meaning of
the former. Our charitable view of the above sentence is, that the
writer is of the number. Nevertheless he has innocently managed to
come near the truth.
[Advertisement.]
BEG TO GIVE NOTICE that there is no truth whatever in the
report that I am about to bestow my hand, fortune, and every stick I have, on
WENUs, or West A, or any other Stan, celestial, theatrical, or otherwise. As such a
report, if allowed to remain uncontradicted, might do incalculable injury to m
º: prospects by circulating the erroneous notion that I was no longer an avail-
able match (which would be a terrible blow indeed to my lantern '), it is to be hoped
that this contradiction will be received by the public with all the flatness that the
subject demands. The object of this Advertisement, therefore, is to state, that I
am still open to competition, and to let the ladies know that my quarterings, which
are some of the oldest in the world, and the large amount of silver that I have
always at my disposal, are such as would reflect credit of no small brilliancy on any
house that is liberally open to an offer, from one who stands so remarkably high in
the world as myself.

THE ANTI-GAROTTE ASSURANCE COMPANY.
(TEMPORARY OFFICE, 85, FLEET STREET.)
PROSPECTUS.
ITH a view of meeting one of
the chief exigences of the
time, the Directors of this
Company feel.
submitting their prospectus
to the notice of the nervous
public. It having become pro-
verbial that the Police are
only to be found when they
are not wanted, and there
being, no authentic case on
record of their having ever
yet come up in time to pre-
vent a garotte robbery, the
irectors have decided that
whilst the “force” has aweak-
ness for cooks and sausage
suppers, it is imperative that
. means should be adopt-
ed for insuring the protection
of the public. The Company
have therefore set on foot a
body of their own, having no
connection with the members
E of the MAYNE force, and com-
posed of men of such surpas-
# ugliness, that there is
- little danger of their whiskers
finding favour in the eyes, at kitchen windows, and of their area-
sneaking from their duties like their leg-of-mutton-loving brethren.
These protectives will be nightly in attendance at the Stations of
the Company, and will hold themselves in readiness at half-a-minute's
notice to obey the summons of any one insured in it, and escort In
safety through the dangers of the district. It will also be feasible, on
the payment of a slight addition to the premium, to secure the guard
of a protective officer every evening of the week at a fixed time and
place; so that business men of punctual habits, who may be residing
at a distance from their omnibus, may regularly ensure themselves a
safe walk home from it. In the same manner too a special escort ma
be ordered in those suburban wastes where cabs are unprocurable, an
where visiting is now very nearly put a stop to, on account of the
dangers of the getting home. There will, however, in this case be a
proviso in the policy for the payment of a stated personal gratuity,
whenever the protectives are detained after midnight; and when sum.
moned to a dinner-party, their fees will be proportioned to the corks
which have been drawn, and the consequent cork-screwiness which any
gentleman may manifest in his homeward ambulation.
While specifying some of the corporeal advantages which will be
secured to those insuring in the Company, the Directors scarcely need
call notice tº its mental benefits, nor point out how immensely they
expect it will conduce to the of mind, not of the insured alone,
but of their wives and families. By paying a small yearly premium
(the rate to be proportioned in some measure to the strength and
stature of the ſº." who desires to be protected) every affectionate
husband and father will henceforth have the meats of effectually
allºying that conjugal anxiety which has of late infected the suburban
districts. The approach of dinner-time need now no longer rouse such
terrors in the wifely heart, lest, in coming down that single-lamp-lit
rºad, to which after nightfall no policeman ever penetrates, her
ToMkINs should have found himself embraced by some other arms than
those of MRs. T.
“Impenitence and sin.”
CLERGYMEN-if we are to judge from the doings in Convocation—
º with a discretionary power to enable them to abstain from
reading the burial service over persons who “may have died in impe-
nitence and sin.” Will this strengthen the pillars of the Established
Church? If clergymen of the Church are to be thus made the censors
of the dead, we think one point is clear as the result—it will con-
siderably add to the number ºf the dissenting living.
NoN-ACCEPTANCE OF THE HUNDREDs.
Many of the guileless constituents of Glasgow have expressed their
surprise that their member, MR. John M.A.cgREgor, seems obstinately
determined not, tº accept the Chiltern Hundreds. Why not try the
Ex-Director with Thousands?
pleasure in ||
BEDLAM AND DOWNING STREET.
The CHANCELLOR, of THE Exchequer has been uncommonly
amusing in some of his late acknowledgments of the ; of
“conscience money.” That phrase is, however, hardly applicable to
the sum specified in the announcement subjoined:—
"The CHANCELLon of THE Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of £70 in Bank
of England Notes, from persons who, having a doubt to whom it belongs, have
decided on paying it into the public Exchequer.”
This is not restitution; it is donation: it is more than justice; it is
generosity. Most people having . reasonable doubt as to whether a
sum of money belonged to anybody in particular, would give them-
selves the benefit of the doubt, and divide the amount. Some might,
perhaps, put it into a poor-box; but it is difficult to conceive what can
induce anybody to make a present of it to the Exchequer. Such a
disposal of money is not even rewarded by that pleasure which is said
ever to attend, and sometimes does attend, the performance of a bene-
volent action. It does not promote the happiness of one human being:
whereas seventy pounds might be so bestowed as to render many wives
and children, happy, Those who are possessed of any money, and,
having a doubt to whom it belongs, determine on paying it into some
office, will find one in Fleet Street much more eligible than any in
Downing Street. That office is No. 85. - ----
Another of the ChancELLoR or THE Exchequer’s comicalities may
perhaps be said to be a real case of conscience-money; but the
conscience, in that case, is so preternaturally tender, that it must be
supposed to be in a state analogous to inflammation. In citing it, we
suppose we exemplify the height of scrupulosity:-
"The CHANCELLoa of THE Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of the remaining
half of a Bank of England note (69,292), value £100, from “One who in his younger
days has frequently shot without a licence.’”
The force of conscience can no further go than this, surely. Remorse
for having evaded the Game Laws is even afiner feeling than penitence
for having eluded the Income-Tax. The very possibility of it will be
inconceivable to the majority of our rural readers; and there are
certain districts, wherein anybody who might manifest such eccen:
tricity would be in danger of being sent to an asylum. Such a person
would not be allowed tº go about in the New Forest. We expect the
CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer will next acknowledge the receipt
of a hundred pounds from a gentleman who in his youth attended
several masqued balls in the costume of the last century, and omitted to
pay the Powder-Tax.
The Tomb of all the Capulets.
A ToMEstone is being prepared for this extensive cemetery, to be
put over the remains of the “War Ninepence,” as soon as that portion
of the Income Tax is decently buried. ...The inscription will be
extremely simple. As it is thought that it is * fair that a War
tax should be brought to a rest during Peace the memorial will
merely say:-

one single law made for doing any good.”
“Here are hundreds of thousands of people out of employment” and
crying about the streets for food (you need not say that it is not so,
because it is, and I myself saw three frozen-out gardeners in our own
street yesterday, and made Mamma send them out a shilling"), and one
would think that the very first thing for Parliament to do, would be
the finding out some way to relieve these poor creatures. You may
look through the newspapers yourself, and if you can find one single
word upon the matter, d; so much as a single question asked even
by the members for the different parts of London (and a pretty set they
are, with the exception of two or three, and utterly iºd it is to
a Metropolis pretending to be intelligent to elect such ninnies") I say
if you find a word about these starving creatures you may print it in
large capital, letters and call me a story-teller." Not, the slightest
attention in the world is paid to this dreadful state of things, and, on
the contrary, all sorts of nonsense is talked about the happiness of the
country—downright wicked falsehoods. I do declare that if I was the
QUEEN of ENGLAND, and the Ministers came to me to ask me to make
such a speech as that made on Tuesday, and I am heartily glad that
the QUEEN had too much spirit to speak any such rubbish, and gave it
to a ridiculous old man in a wig to read,” I would throw it into the
fire, and send them all to the Tower. Just fancy. The QUEEN would
have had to say that she “witnessed the general well-being and con-
tentment of her people,’ just at the very time in the afternoon when
every one of the Magistrates had got his court crammed with starving
rsons, and the wretches at the workhouses were barring their
oors against them, and refusing to #". them anything to eat. Nice
well-being and nice contentment, and this hypocrisy is what men call
moderation and good sense, and fºre say that if I was to show you
that on that very Tuesday ten children were starved in Middlesex—
poor little dears!—you would bring a heap of abominable figures to
show that no children were being starved in Kent and Surrey (though
I dare say that would be false), and therefore the average of food was
highly satisfactory.” If there is one word in the world I hate more
than another, it is average, because it always means an excuse for cold-
heartedness and º do anything kind and Christian. I wonder
whether Members of Parliament and priggish-looking Government
clerks” would like to go without their dinner any day, and be satisfied
to be told that the average of members, and clerks were dining, and
therefore they need not complain. I think I see their faces, greedy
19:S.
p *And then, if you please, what is it that the Parliament has been
talking about P y, things that concern us no more than the man
in the moon. There has been a treaty with Siam. That is a won-
derful ºf certainly. I dare say that I know more about Siam than
anybody who heard the QUEEN's Speech, because I never did know
anything like the ignorance of men about geography, and that LoRD
CIARENDON and all of them made but one mistake in settling the
treaty is marvellous to me, and I º wonder they did not draw the
boundary line through Jerusalem.” They had much better have asked
LADY CLARENDON or MADAME WALEwski where Bolgrad was, and
then they would not have been deceived by the Russians. But as for
Siam, which extends from 4° to 22° N. lat., 98° to 105° 20' E. long.,
and is bounded on the N. by—but never mind, you see I know—what,
in the name of, gracious, are we to get by a treaty with those
Mongolians? Why, all their language is made of little words, all of
one syllable, except what they borrow from the Chinese, and it is per-
fectly ridiculous to think of a treaty with them. It is like writing to a
look to their high |d
H+
child. I suppose it says, “We—do—mean-to-be-good-friends-
with—you—if-you—will—be—good—friends—withius—we –ho
ºść Men ought to be
ashamed of themselves.” And then Persia and China: What does it
signify what has been done out there, especially, when you cannot
hear under amonth, and more things are going on while you are tº:
which may make all that you have .# quite beside the question
That is practical, I suppose, men are always so practical. As for the
Peace business, I should have thought that those who had anything
to do with it would be ashamed to mention such cobbling, but
even my dear LoRD, PALMERSTON could only turn it into fun, and
it was very kind of him to put such a good face upon it and defend
the ridiculous stupids, and I do not believe one single word of what
IsrAELI said against him, and if there is such a treaty dear
LoRD PALMERSTON was never allowed to see it, I am sure.” As for
the Income-Tax I cannot quite make out what anybody meant, and
it seems such foolish, Jesuitry, when, as Papa says, the Ministers
know perfectly well what they mean to do, they do not say it out at
once, and save all that solemn confabulation. But men are, so proud
to make speeches, that they would be disgusted at having the oppor-
tunity taken away. For the life of me, my dear Mr. Punch, I cannot
See ic least good in the world that the first week of Parliament has

not for the world bring to his notice.
TWO ARTISTS ROLLED INTO ONE.
In the Directory, you will find the address of a gentleman in the
Mºjº, who writes up over his door “Hairdresser and Photographic
1st.
This strikes us as a curious combination of businesses. Are the
two operations carried on at the same time? Does a gentleman sit
down in the tonsorial chair to have his stubble removed and his
physiognomy struck off by the same coup-de-main * Does the self-
satisfied Figaro, as he wipes his customer's chin, exclaim, in a high
tone of tradesman-like exultation: “There you are, Sir, clean shaved-
and your portrait taken to a hair, Sir—all in less than two minutes!”
In our opinion, a likeness with the upper part of the face darkened
with a heavy mass of hair falling straight over it, which the handy
coiffeur was busy cutting, would present a difficulty of recognition
even by one’s own son and heir ; and, supposing the lower half of the
face were whitened with a thick layer of soapsuds, whilst the barber
was shaving you, we do not see that that fact even would warrant the
likeness being considered a shape-d'oeurre. However, the rare power
of an artist, who takes off your head one minute and cuts your hair the
next, is certainly deserving of record in our historical columns, and we
do not know of any photographic genius who would be able to coiffer
a person equally in both lines of business, unless it is BEARD.
A Bull and Bear Tax.
THE Daily News states that on the first of January a tax of one
franc was levied by the French Government on every person who
entered the Bourse. This step was taken for the discouragement o
speculative gambling, a very laudable object, which we hope the tax
has so far effected, that % making the payment of one franc the con-
dition of admission to the Bourse, it has prevented a great many people
from being let in for more.
A CASE FOR THE ATToRNEY-GENERAL-We are always being told
that “Property has its rights;” but, surely, in the matter of gloves
and boots, Property has its Lefts as well as its Rights.

A FEW MANDARINS WANTED.
THE Chinaman has gone down somewhat in the estimation of the
thoughtful Briton since Goldsmith wrote, the Citizen of the World.
Then, and before then, the Chinese were the most virtuous and the
most wonderful of people, because they were utterly unknown. They
were painted under most extravagant forms and in the brightest
colours, even as they paint their own china; but even as china
becomes flawed and breaks, even so has JoHN CHINAMAN gone, in our
opinion, smash. The philanthropist has been found to be as cruel as
a cat; the sage has the guile, the petty larceny of a magpie; the man
of meekness the obstinacy of a hog. Even as we have sweetened
Chinese tea, so have we, of our own liberality, sweetened, Chinese
character fetus set aside the saccharine, and judge the pekoe in its
native bitterness.
Well, we propose as speedily as it may be, to end the Chinese war.
It is poor work to shiver tea-pots with Woolwich shells. Let us, then,
as a means of putting an end to the strife, seize some dozen Mandarins
or so—we must have YEH by all means—and straightway ship them to
England. Arrived here, let them be immediately placed under the
direction of proper guides and philosophers; so that they may not
only learn our astounding resources as a fighting nation, but that
they may also become subdued by a profound consciousness of our
superior morals and of our excelling virtue. Thus disciplined, they
. return to China, there to º abroad a full report of our º
and goodness as a people; qualities that, even backed as they are by
the testimony of shells and rockets, they are strangely slow to
acknowledge.
For instance, we would desire that LoRDs CARDIGAN and LucAN
should, by means of interpreters, relate to them the most startlin
assages of the Crimean campaign; by which the gallant officers would,
oubtless, deeply impress the Chinese mind with our admiration of the
self-devotion of the British soldier when, by the grace of fortune, he
happens to be a nobleman. -
A visit to the public offices, with an explanation of the uses of such
establishments by MR. Roebuck, would, no doubt, touch the celestial
minds with great respect for the English as a practical people. A

THE New Orleans Delta has an article on “The Future
ºf Cotton,” in which it not only personifies that substance,
but idolises it. The high ground which our American con.
temporary, takes for cotton is indicated by the passages
italicised (by us) in the extract following:-
“Defended on both flanks, fortified at every point of attack, the
institution of slavery diffused as a vital element over all her territory,
she will be politically invincible; she may sit under her own fig-tree,
with none to make her afraid; and the production of cotton keeping
pace with the demand, the sceptre will not pass from the cotton king while
there is a Southern soil to be tilled, labour to till it, and intelligence to
direct the labour.”
The prophetic quotation, applied to the “cotton king”
evidently shows in what, lig º the writer regards cotton.
His other examples of “iteration” refer to the “South,”
which with him is clearly what the East is to some other
#!". The South is the Holy Land for this gentleman.
His cultivation of cotton is a positive culte. He only
wants a church in which to worship cotton with divine
honours. The church would, of course, have to be fur-
nished with an altar whereon to offer sacrifice to his vege-
table deity. The victims to be immolated on the altar
would be those of slavery, an institution which he not only
proposes to maintain, but to perpetuate by a revival of the
slave trade. The future P cotton, ...i. s, is, in the
opinion of the adorer of that deity, the only future. He
therefore praises cotton with psalms and texts of scripture.
An advocate of the slave trade may well think that besides
the future of cotton there is no hereafter.
“Loud Laughter."
MR. Spoon ER (say the Parliamentary reports) gave notice
that he would move for a Committee to inquire into the
College at Maynooth. (Loud Laughter; in which, it may
be added internally MR, Spoon ER himself joined. A bye-
- - stander also informs us that he observed at the time a very
broad grin in each of MR. Spoon ER's sleeves.)

serve to impress the visit and its moral consequences on their memory,
to serve for the future. -
We would advise that a Ticket-of-Leave meeting should be 5. up by
LoRD CARNARVON, in order that the Mandarins might behold the
effects of the benevolent English law: LoRD CARNARvoN pointing out
with his usual clearness, the brighter instances of the beneficence of
the institution. -
Finally, the Mandarins should be taken to the Surrey Gardens to
hear MR. SPURGEON on the Christian charities. If this did not melt
them, let them be straightway shipped to Canton as incorrigible.
EXTRAORDINARY FLIGHT OF GEESE.
DURING the frost there have as usual been great numbers of geese
seen flying about the ice, in the various parks, and their boldness in
doing so, in the face of the dangers to which they were exposed, may
well be called extraordinary. , However thin it may be frozen, the Ser-
pentine is sure to act as a decoy to these green geese, who in their
regardlessness of self-preservation, show an instinct not superior to
those still greener birds, the boobies and the noddies. In proof of our
assertion—should any one be weak enough to doubt a word in Punch–
from the Times of Monday week we quote the following:—
“Large printed bills were stuck up in the various |. yesterday, announcing
that the ice was in a very dangerous state, but many thousand persons would insist
upon venturing upon it, and a great many accidents took place.”
In Hyde Park, we are told, these geese got ducked a dozen at a time
and not being divers, it was not without some difficulty that they
could be restored to what it were a º to call their senses.
For occasions such as this, we think that the Humane Society would
be doing not unwisely to enlist into their service a few of the assist-
ants from the Idiots’ Asylum, whose experience would fit them for the
cases they would have to deal with. It is obviously needed that, so
long as fools rush in where icemen fear to tread, there should be more
stringent measures taken to ensure their effectual restraint; and we
j therefore suggest that to restore them to their senses, the
apparatus now in use at the tents of the Society should in future be
#. of a number of strait-waistcoats.

SHOEMAKER, CRAN is a well-meaning man,
And a well-meaning man is he,
He's awake to each ſaw in the shoes of the Law,
That makes Justice go lame as a tree.
He will humour, each corn, soft or hardened to horn,
Each kibe and each bunnion admits—
But in spite of his cobbling, still Justice goes hobbling
For CRAN's jobs all turn out misfits.
And great the disgust is of poor MADAME JUSTICE,
And no wonder she's taking to scold,
When, with all CRAN's endeavour, she’s lamer than ever,
And the new shoes finds worse than the old.
There was Chancery pinched, till she’d sooner be lynched,
Than set foot inside tight Lincoln's Inn;
Doctors' Commons old Law her blisters did draw,
And wore her poor soles to the skin.
And so to mend matters, CoBBLER CRAN from the latter’s
Upper-leathers a cantle must pare, -
And, skilful reformer, to the legs of the former
Sews 'em on, and calls that a new pair :
He pares, welts and lops, rotten old feet and tops,
Bought at booths in the Law's statute-fair,
And puffs that to the nation as Consolidation—
Trash that won't last out one day's rough wear.
He claps old stuff on new ; to mend one hole makes two;
In short, turns such botch'd work out of hand,
That poor Justice 'gins swear she would sooner go bare,
Than longer CRAN's tinkering stand!
Then Shoemaker CRAN, though a well-meaning man,
In law-mending find a new tutor;
Or you’ll find, some fine morning, by way of a warning,
O'er your court writ in large hand, “NE SUITOR.”
THE ROAD To RUIN.—Follow the RED-PATH.
THE GOBEMOUCHE.
THE Gobemouche (or Musca Disraelis) is extremely common in soft
climates, such as º the opposition benches, and the Carlton Club,
though it has been known to go to the greatest latitudes. It has
enormous wings, with which it allows itself to be quietly carried away.
It flies instinctively at anything green. Its eyes, too, are enormous,
and in political quarters it will see secret things which no one else can
see. But its great distinguishing characteristic is its mouth. The
aperture of this feature is so accommodatingly large that you can stuff
most anything into it. No matter how preposterous in size or
absurdity the thing to be swallowed may be, it gulps, it down with the
greatest ease and avidity. Its appetite is on a similar scale of capa-
ciousness, and a list of the articles found in the stomach of a Gobe-
mouche would make the abdomen of a shark look very small indeed.
The Gobemouche abounds in clubs, coffee-houses, Capel Courts,
BELLAMY's, and all old women's tea-parties. A very fine specimen of it
is to be met with in the office of the Morning Herald. In fact, a won-
derful dressing-gown is shown to the curious, which was woven out of
the different yarns, which the Gobemouches have at different times
spun in that establishment. The Editor, it is affirmed, puts on this
dressing-gown when he writes his leading articles, and is inspired
accordingly.
The food of the Gobemouche consists generally of playbills, pamph:
lets, programmes, prospectuses, and bright gossamer promises of a
kinds; an English Reform Bill, a Spanish constitution, an Austrian
liberty of the press, a Russian liberation of the serfs, an American
abolition of slavery—nothing is too gross, or too far out of the way for
its consumption 1. It is dearly fond, also, of anything quackish. Thus,
the Gobemouche falls an easy prey to the ointment-spreader, and other
dealers in soft-soap, such as your cheap-jack , philanthropist, your
flowery preacher, and mouthing politician. IXuring the elections, the
Gobemouche may be caught in thousands and thousands. The pledges
they take in then, without the smallest examination, would ruin the
richest pawnbroker in no time. -
On the Stock Exchange, the poor Gobemouche falls a ready victim
to the innumerable Kites that fly about the City.
WOL, XXXII.
I
When Parliament closes, the Gobemouche wings its flight into the -
country, where it can be easily traced from one provincial newspaper
to another, changing its food at every place. At one time you may
hear of its swallowing an enormous Gooseberry, with no more difficulty
than a boa-constrictor bolts a rabbit; at another, you read that it is
feasting to its heart's content off a Wonderful Showér of Frogs.
Sometimes its powers of digestion are severely tried—as, for instance,
after it had been dazzled and made giddy with the report that MR.
SPURGEoN was about to marry LoLA Montes, it could not be induced
to take the smallest bit of political, or green-room gossip; though
again when it really is hungry, it will attack anything, and has been
known to seize on a tremendous canard of the very wildest nature,
and, in less time than you can listen to one of M. GLADSTONE's
speeches, make very small bones of it, indeed!
“BREAD UPON THE WATERS.”
We have rarely met with a more pious, a more touchin
of inward thankfulness than is shown through the subjoine
ment, and issued by the Misses S.–, of Liverpool:—
THE MISSES S-, on retiring from their sphere of labour in
Liverpool, desire to record the mercy of God in having permitted them so long
to enjoy the sympathy and kindness of their various friends, and trust that, the
bread cast upon the waters by their instrumentality, may be found and enjoyed by
revelation
advertise-
ll their pupils after many days. The Misses S. will be happy to receive any of their
day-pupils as boarders after the Christmas recess, at --
Thus, it is evident that the MissEs S-, having, as day-teachers,
thrown their diurnal bread upon the waters, fºci justified in the
Christian hope that the bread may be returned to them as boarding-
school mistresses, very thickly buttered.
THE Fog-SIGNALs.-The new system of Fog-Signals is to be tried
in the House of Commons on the night of the first heavy debate. Each
speaker is to be provided with a Fog: Signal, in order that Members
|. see in what particular course he is steering. MR. Spoon ER is to
ave two.

PUNCH's ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EBRUARY 9TH. Monday. The
next “difference” which is
likely to arise between the
English and French Govern-
ments will be upon the ques-
tion, whether the Danubian
Principalities shall besoldered
together, or kept apart:
land is for separation, France
for solder. Considering that
we went to war for the in-
tegrity of the Turkish Empire,
and considering that the join-
ing these two provinces would
speedily throw them into the
grip ºf. we are rather
more consistent than our
Allies. Meantime, it was
agreed that neither power
was to say anything on the
SECR
TREATY:
parties specially interested,
namely, Turkey and the Prin-
cipalitiesthemselyes, had been
obtained, and the Moniteur
has been breaking compact,
and LORD CLARENDON, ex-
pressed his “surprise,” which
is diplomatic for disgust.
the Commons, MR.
Lowe said that there was no
reason for legislative provi-
sion againstrailway accidents,
for that out of 125 millions of HER MAJESTY's subjects who travelled by rail in
1856, only 8 were killed and 282 injured. As the total population of the three
kingdoms, including Eelpie Island, was, at the last census, only 25,485,325, we
presume that MR. I owe counted the tickets, not the individuals. Šm B. HALL
explained that nothing was to be done with Westminster Bridge at present, as he
was waiting for lots of architects' plans for the Downing Street and Westminster
Improvements. These designs are to be stuck up after Easter in Westminster
Hall, which has been selected, in conformity with the usual policy of Govern.
ment, because it has the worst possible light...for such a purpose. SIR
GEORGE GREY then introduced his Transportation Bill. He proposes to lengthen
sentences of penal servitude, and give more discretionary power to the Judges, and
to enable them to transport criminals to any colony that will take them. Western
Australia wants convict labour at present, but is rather fastidious, and will accept
Roman the colony has not given us orders), and have no women at all; Qn
the first point SIR GEORGE will be as obedient as he can, but as it is *.
necessary to send women out, he Fº to remit Irishwomen, who are suppose
to be less objectionable than their. Scotch and, English sisters in crime. A
Reformatory School bill, useful, but limited, was also introduced.
Tuesday. LoRD CHANCELLORCRAN worth brought in three Bills, and remarkably
queer articles they are. , First, a Bill for reforming the system of proving Wills, by
establishing a considerably worse system. Secondly, a Bill for reforming the Law
of Divorce, by a set of alterations that are not improvements. Thirdly, a Bill for
trying naughty parsons by means of a tribunal that cannot possibly work. As the
other law lords will take these measures in hand (CRANNY caught it all round for
his feebleness and timidity) it is probable that they may be improved, and Mr. Punch
will refrain from taking them to pieces until he sees in what form it is proposed
finally to submit them for his consideration.
In the Commons, LORD PAIMERSTON (on compulsion) paid a º compliment to
the Crimean Commissioners, but added, that nothing more would be paid them,
The “Secret Treaty” squabble, raised § MR. DISRAELI, was then renewed, and
#. on the Thursday. It may as well be disposed of at once. There was no
Treaty, but there was a Convention, dated in December, 1854, and this was signed,
though PAM at first said it had not been. The º: of this Convention was, that
if Austria would help the Allies, France would help to keep Austrian Italy in order.
Austria never did hi, the Allies, but on the contrary helped Russia most º
by taking away an army, and so the Convention came to nothing. If PAM ha
been a little more frank and a little less rude in his first answer, Dizzy's overthrow
would have been complete. As it is, he has a sort of yerbal victory, just such an
one as would delight a smart attorney's clerk. MR. HARDY, Conservative Mem-
ber for Leominster, brought in a Bill for giving the magistrates at sessions more
power over beer-houses. Some of the tea-total Members took the opportunity of
protesting against anybody's drinking under any circumstances.
Wednesday. Nothing particular, except discussion on a Bill, for reforming the
| Liverpool Dock Trust, which was of course resisted, and finally sent to a §.
| Committee.

he Crimean Commander-in-Chief and the Governor of
the Bank of England, having been respectively victorious
at Greenwich, and Southampton, swore, and seated them-
selves. SIR. B. HALL explained that the NELson column
could not be finished for want of money (about £5000), for
which he did not mean to ask Parliament. , Punch sees no
hope for the memorial to our greatest Admiral, unless
some “influential person” will propose that its completion
shall be entrusted (with £20 as guerdon) to some
ARON OWFATTI, or other fortunate foreign pet.
SIR ROBERT PEEL was then called to account for his
lecture on foreign notorieties. He stated that he had really
had no idea of º . He had been talki
in a “familiar” way. Mr. Punch accepts the apology wit
perfect frankness, not, having the least respect for any of
the persons quizzed X. SIR. Robert, but would recal to
that"baronet Polonius's advice to his son: ” Be thou
familiar, but by no means .” A good debate arose
as to whether there should not be a Minister of Public
Justice, with a separate department, and a motion by
MR. NAPIER for an address requesting the QUEEN to take
the subject into consideration, was agreed to... LoRD
ALMERSTON, promised real assistance in promoting the
scheme, and brought out one of the quaint quotations of
which he is fond:—
“What to avoid requires no great heed,
But what to follow is the task indeed.”
This is true. It requires no great heed to avoid the Dis-
raelite party, but it is a task indeed, at times, to follow
LoRD PALMERSTON. SIR WILLIAM CLAY brought in his
Bill for the abolition of Church-rates, on which our friend
Spoon ER promised to have a round or two with SIR. W.
Friday. LoRD BROUGHAM came down to the Lords with
his carpetbag, as he was going to France; but, before he
went, he desired to move three resolutions touching the
rights of married women to property. , First, that their
present rights were all wrongs. condly, that a woman
was entitled to her own property; and thirdly, that if our
ridiculous theory of marriage prevented a woman from
having this justice, at all events a profligate husband should
be restrained from .."; possessions. LoRD CAMP-
BELL, of course, thought differently from LoRD BRQUGHAM
on the most important point, and i.
until the latter's return.
In the Commons, the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER
produced the º: What he took two hours and three-
quarters to say, . PUNCH proposes to put into three
nes and a quarter. The Income-Tax is to be reduced
from Sixteen-pence to Seven-pence on incomes over £150
and to Five-pence on incomes between £150 and £l00; and
in three years expires altogether.
You may give three cheers, BULL, for no doubt it is
something to keep the Nimble Ninepence that used to jump
so nimbly from your pocket into the tax-collector's, Cheer
away, old boy. Now, if your mind is relieved, sit down
and wipe your old face, as we have something to say to
MRs. BULL, O, yes, you º hear. MRs. BULL, M’m, you
are aware that the duty on Tea is now one and nine? Yes,
A. but according to the present law it would be reduced,
M
e debate was adjourned
yearly degrees, to one and three, and one shilling. Yes,
'm, but SIR. G. C. L. proposes to make a much longer
business of the reduction, and to make it drop to one and
seven, to one and five, to one and three, and finally to one
bob. He intends to playa similar trick, M’m, with S s
and therefore, as MR. GLADSTONE gently specified to f.
the question is now whether the Tax, on Tea and Su
shall be increased. What do you think of that, old girl?
A NOTE FROM NELSON.
“LoRD NELsoN presents his compliments to SIR BEN-
JAMIN HALL, and having learned that there has been some
talk in Parliament about his unfinished column in Trafalgar
Square, desires to state that he in no way wishes to pre-
cipitate the Government to the expense of £4000 or £5000
for the completion of the same. Having stood in a state
of destitution for so many years, his Lordship has become
quite accustomed to his position, and would become rather
embarrassed by , the novelty of any attention. LoRD
NELSON's concluding compliments, and does not expect the
Government to do its duty.”

to the pauper children, to come and see the morning
performance of Jack and the Bean-Stalk. What
a burst of sunlight broke through the dulness of
the Union, as the thoughtless little sinners pre-
pared themselves in their workhouse best to be at
the playhouse-door at 2 p.m.! ...It was, however
doubtless right that their impatient vanity should
be rebuked; and rebuked it was by the pastoral
dignity of the Church, lay authority grimly assisting.
. Even whilst the children were dressing—(for
MR. Bush, the chairman had all heedlessly accepted
the invitation for the little ones!)—the Board of
Guardians was gathering. At length the Board
met, and delivered itself.
The Rev. Mr. NewNHAM thought the idea
“monstrous that the Guardians should introduce
the children under their care to habits of early
§ dissipation!” (Jack and the Bean-Stalk at 2 P.M.)
MR. HENRY DALLAway agreed with MR. NEWN-
HAM. DALLAWAY had once seen the Serious Family
in London: the most disgusting thing he ever saw.
(In the piece, cant is #. and hypocrisy torn
to tatters. A very disgusting exhibition, MR.
DALLAWAY.) -
MR.MURCH, with a worldly-mindedness much to be lamented for pomps, and vanities,
said—“Heaven knew that these children had little enough to gratify them, and indeed little
; º w kind.” (Why should pauper children be gratified? Poverty, in fact, has no
c 0001.
MR. BARNEs spoke for the children and the Pantomime. MR. W. LEwis, liked to be a
child once a-year. A pantomime was a childish amusement, and when people were there,
}. were all childish together. (The REv. MR.NEwNHAM silently wondered where MR. W.
Ewis thought to go to?) - -
Finally, it was §red that the workhouse children should not be º to see Jack
and the Bean-Stalk! But children, on wicked pleasures bent, are quick in their doings. The
little things of the Bath Union, fluttering with sinful emotions, had dressed themselves, and
under due gº; (authority having been given by weak MR. BUSH) had º for that
Temple of Sin, the theatre. #. “poor children,” says the Bath Journal (but how spiritually
rich with such workhouse pastors ), “had reached the very door of the theatre before the
counter-order denying them the anticipated pleasure came to their conductors.” -
Of course, the children, in the ignorance of their disappointment, returned to their
prison-house to mope, and sob, and cry. They could not be expected to feel properly grateful
to the REv. M.R. NEwNHAM, whose Christian tenderness must have been sweetly rewarded
by the bitter distress of the little ones. It is said, however, that the Rey. Gentleman took
an early |..". of “improving” the matter for the benefit of his flock of lambs;
Among other ºf; it is said he bade the infant paupers to rejoice in the misery, and
º that had brought them under the guidance and ministration of the Guardians
of Bath. Had it been their trying lot to be born princes and princesses of the House of
Hanover, great would have been their temptations; and, doubtless, great their backslidings;
since—it was, upon record—the QUEEN herself had more than, once taken her, little ones,
beginning with the PRINCEss Roy AL and ending with PRINCE #. to see the abomina-
tion of a pantomime played in the morning at a Temple of Disorder called the Adelphi. Now
they–the chosen children of the Bath Union—had been stopped at the yery doors. . . -
ell, it will go luckily with some sour-faced Christians if, with the fullest belief in their
own right of entry of Paradise, they are not “stopped at the very doors.”

perhaps the kind of service that is rendered to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOME MORE CHAPTERS FROM THE History OF
JOHN BULL.
How JoHN BULL came to hear of what was going on. How he flew into
a rage when he discovered the truth; and the steps he took to bring
the blame home to the right people.
WHILE all this was going on, and the poor lads were º, by
dozens, John BULL continued to receive very comfortable letters from
the old head-keeper, enclosing flaming ſº from the under-keepers,
how all was going on as well as could be expected, and how Nick’s
rascals were being thrashed every time John's watchers came within
arm's length of them. The latter part of this news was quite true, for
never did poor fellows fight more lustily than JoHN’s watchers, in spite
of empty bellies, . aches, pains, frost-bites, and fevers. f{ut ey
could scarce have held their ground for all their pluck, but for a large
K. of LEwis Bon Ey's servants hard by that helped JoHN's to deal with
Ick...This BoSEY had lately come into old IEwis BABOON's property,
some folks said not quite fairly. But, be that as it may, he was in
F. of the BABOQN estates, and, being a long-headed fellow,
ad made up to JoHN BULL, instead of going to law or loggerheads
with him, as BABoon had been used to do. BoNEY had sworn to
stand by JoHN BULL in this affair with NICK, and, sure enough, he had
kept his word so far like a man; so that the two, between them, were
more than a match for NICK, for all he stood six feet four in his shoes,
and had as many rag-a-muffins at his orders as MR. BULL and LEWIs
Boney could muster honest good fellows, between 'em. .
All this while, you may suppose, JoHN’s poor starving lads were
grumbling, and sulky at the usage they got; but not a man left his
post so long as he could handle a cudgel; and, of course, the keepers
took care none of their complaints should reach John BULL., Not but
what some of these keepers were good men and true, and did their
best to make the watchers under their orders comfortable, and took
their own chances alongside of their lads, rough or smooth. But what
could they do?', The knot of lazy incompetent rogues round the old
head-keeper had his earl of course, and fobbed off on him what tales
they would, and very little truth reached John Bull's ears, I can
promise you.
Nevertheless, the truth did ooze out at last, for all their man-
ceuvring to keep it close. For there happened to come that way a
sharp-witted i. a pen-hawker, who was used to visit outlying farms,
to look after the geese, in the way of his business; and, going about
everywhere, he used his eyes and his ears, and sent home accounts to
his employers of what was going on, mighty different from those JoHN
BUIL was in the habit of receiving, and which he would read aloud to
all his friends, and acquaintances, bragging at the same time what
servants he had, and how famously matters were going on up at the
moor-farm, and so forth.
Now when JoHN BULL saw the accounts sent home by the pen-
hawker, he was a good deal staggered at first, and handed them over
to his Steward—an old Scotchman, by the name of GoRDON-who only
pooh-poohed them for traveller's tales, and swore the pen-hawker
was a lying vagabond, who deserved to be set in the stocks for a
scandal-monger, and a makebate. But at length, as some of the
friends and relations of the watchers, got news, from time to time, of
the sad state, the lads were in, and how they, were dying fast of
starvation and neglect, John grew fidgety, and determined to inquire
a little more closely into matters. To this he was mainly spirited up
by one STAG, a clerk in JoHN's counting-house, and an honest fellow
though with a temper as sharp as verjuice, and a tongue that spared
nobody.
The old Scotch steward set himself †: any inquiry, and was so
stubborn and pig-headed on the point, that at last, JóHN BULL fairly
lost temper with him and turned him out of his place, setting u
instead of him one. PAM, a sharp, shrewd, plausible fellów, who ha
held different situations in the family, from steward's room-boy upwards,
and always been liked, as a ºl. companion, and one too, that
had more in him than you would guess from his jaunty manner, and
his off-hand way of going about his work. PAM tried at first to stave
off STAG’s interference, eclaring he’d do the work better, if left to
himself; but finding that this tone set JoHN's back up, he changed his
note, swore he was all for inquiry, and protested that STAG was the
very man to conduct it—none better. Accordingly STAG had his way;
the inquiry was duly set about, and some of the keepers, who had comé
home º: had enough of the work) were examined, and some of
the watchers, who had been sent back to their friends sick, and not a
few strangers, besides, who had visited the farm out of curiosity; and,
a pretty story they made of it among them! JoHN BULL's hair fairly
stood on end at the ugly facts that came out, and I promise you, never was
a man seen in a greater trouble. Sometimes he would curse, and anon
he would whistle, and then stamp, and swear, and wring his hands, and
cry like a child. In short he went on in a way that the oldest inhabi.
tant of the place had never, seen the plain, hard-headed, sturdy, silent
old fellow behave in all his life before. It was as much as a servant's
ears were worth to §. him now. He cuffed here, and he cursed
there: was for knocking down everybody at best, and for hanging a
good many. He, even neglected his business; would take no rest at
nights; went without shaving, lost his *. and sulked about his
premises, as the saying is, like a bear with a sore head.
PAM saw.it was no use smoothing matters over, so, in his pliant
manner, he fell into his master's angry way, and used the same sort of
language about the keepers, swearing that nothing was too bad for
them—that they deserved cashiering, every rogue of them, and so
forth. But when John talked of sending them about their business
at Qnce, neck and crop, PAM hinted that he had better have matters
lºoked into on the spot first, and named a brace of Scotchmen—cool,
shrewd, long-headed men both—who, he declared, were the very men
to find Qut the keepers’ mis-doings, and lay the blame at the right
door. One was, looking, after the business of some of John's poor
relations in Scotland at this time, and the other was an old soldier in
John's, establishment. But, old as they were, they both consented
§§§ to turn out of their snug berths, and undertake the business
PAM wished to º with join Buil was standing by when
PAM gaye them their orders. “Mind,” he said, “we must have
neither fear nor favour—no shirking facts, or smoothing over short-
comings. Overhaul everything and everybody, speak truth, and shame
the Devil; and, never fear, my friends, but that every one in this
house will stand by you.” join Buil backed all the steward said
and off the two Scotchmen started, with good will to their work, and
much comforted, you may be sure, by *... hearty and straight-
Alès.

TAKING OFF THE INCOME-TAX,
HE more serious-
minded of our readers
may think that in deal-
ing with so grave a
subject as the Income-
Tax, we should have
abstained from the re-
motest, approach to
jocularity, and have
treated the matter
with as much sedate-
ness as though a pun
never issued from
our pen. But although
we quite acknowledge
that a tax so heavy
should in no way be
made light of, we
- cannot well admit that
ponderosity of language would have added weight to the arguments
against it. We do not think our advocacy for obtaining its reduction
would have gained much in force had we only used strong language;
and althoug
the Income-Tax º have made us laugh a little on
the wrong side of our mouths, we have considered it our duty to grin
as well as bear it. A tax of one and fourpence in the pound was a
tax . our temper as well as on our, income, and by far, too heavy
we admit to be treated with an undue levity. . But having all its
inequalities before our eyes, as we viewed the imposing of it as in
fact an imposition, we have thought ourselves justified to hold it up to
ridicule, as well as reprobation: and in treating its absurd injustice in
the way of caricature, we have felt, assured that the Income-Tax was
of all things one which no one would object to see taken off.
The Chancellor's Bills.
It is told of a certain Chief Justice, that he never travelled on circuit
unless attended by a favourite goose in his carriage., . goose, the
learned lord was wont to consult for aid and help in his decisions; and
found from its inspirations the best aid in his worst need. It is said,
that in imitation of this learned §. the LORD CHANCELLOR has a
et owl, by whose eyes he draws the ills that he submits to Parliament.
his being the case, there can be no wonder, that his measures, being too
weak to bear the light, go out, one by one, “like winking.”
Diplomas of the Dangerous Classes.
MANY convicts who have obtained tickets-of-Leave appear to be
rather proud than otherwise of those distinctions. . We expect that
philanthropists, who are in the habit of visiting the abodes of this class
of persons, will, in many instances, find the Ticket-of-Leave converted to
an ornamental purpose, by being framed and glazed, and suspended
over the chimney-piece of àe crib.

water and salt are then stirred in until the mixture has become cold.
Patts. May I ask what proportion is thus gained, Sir?
Mr. Rancid. I like thy query, it speaks of arithmetic. The original
article should contain 34 per cent. of salt and 10 per cent; of water.
The manufactured article, my good lad, and especially that which
Guardians of the Poor permit us to supply to the Paupers, oft con-
tains 14 per cent. of salt and 15 per cent of water.
Scrape (aside). Ah, don't it just, and don’t I know it!
Patts. And are there no other ways, dear Sir P
Mr. Rancid. Of a surety there are. At particular times, of which I
will hereafter instruct thee, starch, usually potatoe flour, may be added.
We can also do somewhat with curds. And sometimes, but less often,
animal fats and lard are used by us.
Patts. But, dear Sir, if I might speak 2–

Patts. Why not take a simpler way of making more of the pound?
Mr. Rancid. Let us hear thee, boy.

Mr. Rancid. Firstly, boy, because the law employs minions to hunt up
such contrivances, and punish them, though but slightly; and, secondly,
because they are not considered respectable. But thou art right to
think, and to ask. Art an early riser?
Patts. Early to bed and early to rise is the way to be—
Mr. Rancid. Good. To-morrow morning thou wilt rise at three.
Patts. At two, Sir, if it will please you.
Mr. Rancid. At three. I will show thee another of the secrets of

will wash our butter frequently with milk, and we will add a little
sugar, and the best, fresh Epping (which thou wilt be able to say
arrived this day), will be ready for our customers to-morrow. I have a
reputation for my delicate Epping.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PRESS IN PARIS.
ONSIEUR the Editor of the Moni-
teur des Hôpitaur (according to
the Daiſy News) announced its
intention to examine the question
of the assassin VERGER's in-
sanity, but could not carry that
design, into effect, having been
forbidden to discuss the subject.
In what a state of slavery is the
Parisian press!. Again, in the
course of an action against the
Lady Superior of the Picpus
Convent of the Sacré Caeur, |.
advocate for the plaintiff pitched
into the ARchbishop of CHAL-
cÉDoINE, but what the learned
gentleman said of the venerable
prelate hath not appeared, be:
tause the Government ordered
the journals not to report the
case. Really they do not manage
these matters in France much
better than they do here. In
England a newspaper is liable to
an action for libel and a verdict
of heavy damages for reporting
ºf: which contain abuse
of anybody. In France, things
are not quite so bad as this;
but the publication of such in-
telligence is prevented. Thus
is the journalist deprived of the
liberty of printing, although he
may not be punished for its
exercise; so that, on the whole,
the Press experiences almost as
much, hardship under a French
despotism as it does at the hands of a British judge,and jury.
In connection with the French lawsuit above alluded to a, remark
may be made, without reference to the subject involved in the fore-
going observations, which will, º º: natural to many of our
readers. The Picpus Convent of the Sacré Cºeur was accused of having
fraudulently induced a person of weak intellect to make a will in its
favour. If this accusation is well founded, the Convent, may, with a
pardonable licence of speech and pronunciation, be described as being
more of the pickpurse than of the other thing.
REFLECTION FOR THE PEW.
THE subjoined statement is made by the correspondent of a Bristol
paper:-
“selecting a book of Common Prayer in a stationer's shop, in Bristol a few years
I saw some Prayer Books having a looking-glass inserted in the inner side of
the cover. "I have no doubt that the fair owner might be enabled to arrange her
hair, and admire herself during the service."
This device the writer stigmatises as a vanity almost profane, but
erhaps the profaneness lies merely at the door of some enterprising
{...i. ere is, moreover, something to be said for looking-
glasses in ladies' Prayer. Books. It is a little better to contemplate the
reflection of one's own face at church, than to be looking about at the
reality of other faces. Besides, a young lady may sometimes even
make a better use of her eyes by employing them in the looking-glass
than by keeping them fixed on the parson. The former direction is
enerally preferable to the latter, when the reverend gentleman is a
i. of the class commonly called pet. By the way, we should like
to know whether looking-glasses in the inside of the lids of religious
manuals is a vanity peculiar to fair devotees. May not the like vanity
be, in some instances, indulged in on the other side—on the side of the
recipients of certain triº slippers, and other like offerings of
fashionable devotion? ... If all, manuscript-or º:
could be overhauled, is it not highly probable that not a few looking-
glasses would be found within the covers of pet parsons' sermon-books?
Greenwich Election.
LIEUT.GENERAL CodriNGTON, with certain Government advantages
at his back, has been returned for Greenwich, against “Colonel”
SLEIGH, who demurs to the election, and expresses himself prepared
for further measures. It is confidently, reported that the Lieut.-
General's opponent is quite ready to “file his petition.”
LINENDRAPERS’ ANATOMY.
A WAGUE and indefinite idea of horrors mingles in the conception,
generally entertained, of the unseen, economy of a linendraper's
establishment. Close, ill-ventilated sleeping-rooms, an atmosphere
tainted by the products of the combustion of gas, the reek of goods,
and the respiration of a number of people, associated in the public
mind with the hidden arrangements of the house, suggest unpleasant
suspicions of disease and mortality. How will our many readers, who
are haunted by such horrible imaginings respecting linen-drapers' shops,
shudder in perusing the following advertisement, extracted from the
Manchester rdian *
WANºp, in a large Retail Drapery Establishment, a DISSECTING
CLERK, who thoroughly understands his duties.—Address, stating how long
lived in last situation, and salary required, K. 45, at the Printer's.
What?—can it have come to this? Has the unhealthiness, of
drapery establishments arisen to such a pitch as to give peculiar
facilities to the foundation of private schools of anatomy in connection
with them? And have their proprietors begun to derive a new emolu-
ment from that frightful source f No, no–the thought is too
º
We think we may venture to assure any lady, upon whose nervous
system the foregoing speculations may, possibly have produced a
ainful effect, that no anatomical proceedings whatever, are conducted
in the establishment of any draper, except such as may be requisite, in
regard to the Skeleton Petticoat. It may be added, that the increasing
adoption of the Early Closing System will go far to remove any sup-
position that linendrapers, are in the habit of doing anything more
dreadful than what is implied in furnishing funerals in the regular way
of trade, and that their .." is of such a nature as to º ally
material for dissection in the St. Bartholomew's sense of the word.
CANZONET ON CRINOLINE.

A ROYAL MASON.
KING GEORGE THE FIFTH, of Hanover, (better known in England
by his earlier title of PRINCE GEORGE of CUMBERLAND,) has, we
learn, just been made a Freemason. The gallant sovereign is stated to
be the first Continental monarch who has braved the u inable
terrors of the gridiron and red-hot poker; but is not understood to sit
less comfortably on his throne, for havinº condescended to join an
association of his subjects. “The Craft” has little in common with
Kingcraft, and may read salutary lessons to a royal Apprentice.
frother King George, Brother Püsch, G.M., congratulates you.
Another Insult to Scotland.
MR. EwART has already given notice that he intends to assimilate
the law affecting capital punishments in Scotland with the law in
England! The effect of this insolent measure will be to throw the
whole monopoly of hanging into the hands of the Southſon CALCRAFT'
If this new insult fails to arouse all the might and ire of Scotland, why

THE SURGEON'S WIND.
The Wind is North-East—so let it be!
The North-East Wind is the wind for me,
To me it blows good if to none besides;..
For the boys on the pavement cut out slides,
And the passenger on the hard flagstones
Comes down, hahal and breaks his bones.
I have had a radius to do, -
And a compound fractured tibia, too.
And that had been scarce ten minutes gone,
When in came a case of olecranon.
There was next a dislocated hip,
Resulting also from a slip.
Zymotic diseases lend a charm
To genial Autumn, moist and warm.
We have Scarlatina and hus then,
And Cholera good for medical men:
But practice is best, I always find, -
In the bracing air of the North East Wind.
When the North-Easter whistles shrill,
It makes me think on the little bill
| To many apatient that I shall send

And though its music may seem severe,
'Tis a strain to gladden a Surgeon's ear.
Shameful Practical Joke.
A Ticket-or-LEAVE-MAN, seeing a respectable
old gentleman looking into a book-shop in Picca-

the respectable old gentleman, and sent him
walking down the street with that decoration
between his shoulders.
THE SHOE-BLACK BRIGADE.
“By DAY AND MARTIN, this is wondrous strange /"—ShakspeaRE (Princess's Edition)
THE EARL, or SHAFTESBURY has º taken tea with his young
friends, the Shoe-black boys of the red, blue, and yellow. The young
[. who set such a noble example of self-respect to the younger
ranches of the aristocracy, assembled in St. Martin's Hall; and made g
a brilliant show. The living DuchEss of ARGYLL cast the radiance of
her benevolent face upon the assembly, and “much admired,” as the
late MR. PEPYs, or the present Colos EL PHIPPs would say, to see the
boys drink their tea, and eat their bread and butter and plum-cake.
An Earl or two was also present; M.P's as thick as plums; amongst
them, it was whispered, MR. John MAcc REGoR, for Glasgow, who had
come to be º polished. It was afterwards discovered that the
visitor was the MAcc REGoR JAMEs, M.P. for Sandwich, upon whose
boots there rested no speck of mud. The Church was also excellently
represented on the occasion; and the attendance of the ARchbishop
of CANTERBURY is hopefully expected at the next gathering. We
should have been happy to record the presence of several young gen-
tlemen from the army; and others from Oxford and Cambridge, who
haply might have left the meeting wiser and slower men;, such was the
general impression made by the Shoe-black Brigade on the #4. of
respect and esteem of the spectators. The appearance of the boys
was very, gay. As they clustered in their bright new shirts, a young
peeress playfully likened them to beds of human tulips, ºthese boys
and brothers! -
But the boys may, in very truth, be called the children of light; for
they owe their professional existence to the year of the Great Exhi.
bition, to the invention of the Crystal Palace. If the boys, as the
peeress prettily, said, are tulips, they were assuredly caused to be
reared and cultivated by the gardener PAXT9N. And these boys,
originally things, of London gutter mud, and London alley filth, are
now admirable living proofs of the convertible uses of poor human
nature. Even as London, sewage may be converted, by the chemistr
of nature, into roses and lilies, so may forlorn ignorance and childis
depravity be cultivated into social utility and refined to self-respect.
These bºys had, in the past year, earned nearly £3,000; averaging 12s.
er week for each boy. ey are worthy citizens of the pavement.
ndustrious, energetic littlefellows, who, of their own forthright accord,
take up the freedom of London and Westminster.
LORD SHAFTESBURY, as is his wont, addressed the boys in words of
kindness and affection, exhorting them in plain, impressive speech, to
a course of honesty and a due f ent of their religious duties. e
responses of the boys proved that they fully understood and valued the
-- - -
truths that were uttered to them. For LoRD SHAFTESBURY, as a mis-
sionary of highways and bye-ways, fever lodging-houses and typhus
alleys, has learned—(a greater achievement than to compass Sanscrit)-
to s plain matter to plain people. His Lordship does not twiddle
fine sentences; he does not stoop to patronise; but just talks God's
simple truths, spontaneously and freely, as God's air comes and
Oes.
His Lordship, however, ventured to touch the string of human
ambition that, no doubt, is somewhere in every, heart, however small
º of its vibrations. WoRDsworth's shepherd had but one
Wilsil:-
“The bound of all his vanity to deck
With one bright bell a fav'rite heifer's neck.”
Whereas LoRD SHAFTESBURY awakened bolder thoughts in the bosoms
of the Blacking Brigade. His Lordship said: “They might be Lord
Chancellor; Prime Minister; for in this, free country, the noblest
positions were thrown open to all. He wished them to be something
even higher, to be chairman of even a ragged school meeting.” Now,
we could wish that his Lordship had omitted, at the present time
especially, all notice of the dignity of Chancellor; for, as the boys will
be, if not already, studious readers of the newspapers, we do not think
their ambition very likely to be quickened by the example of LoRD
CRAN worth. Considering how long his Lordship has been occupied
in attempting to brush away defiling dirt and to substitute, a fine
reflective polish, we fear that any ordinary blacking-boy will deem
his Lordship by no means the man to emulate. , Now, it is otherwise
with the example of the present Prime Minister before the children of
original º: LoRD PALMERston should be considered as the
beau idéal of the whole purpose and object of the Blacking Brigade.
For, let his Lordship tumble into Fleet Ditch, and, ere a blacking-hoy
with brush in hand could say “bristles,” his fordship would somehow
reappear as neatly elegant as though dressed for a wedding-breakfast,
with a whiff of eau de milleſleurs from his linen and a moss-rose in his
button-hole... But this is the wonderful art of PALMERstoN alone. He
has beautifully said, that all dirt was only matter in a wrong place.
Thus, what would be very noisome and filthy on a hearth:rug would be
ministering to perfume and beauty about the bulbs of lilies., Hence,
from this time forward, PALMERston must be the great model for the
Blacking Brigade. , Even as the inspired youth, giving utterance to a
eat emotion, cried—“And I, too, am a painter!”—so may the earnest
indomitable blacking-boy, blacking the highlows of some young Hebrew
destined some day to become Chancellor of the Exchequer, exclaim,
looking upward, in his Caucasian countenance-“And I, too, am a
judicious bottle-holder!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. -
WOL, XXXII. K
A BACHELOR-TAX.
“Mr. PUNCH,
- “I very seldom read the papers except, the Marriages and
the Murders, the Births and the Accidents: but in this dreadful time
of dear tea, and understanding that the CHANCELLOR OF THE Ex-
cHEQUER has his finger in, everybody's caddy, I was induced to read
something about what is called a Deputation,--thinking it might affect
the black and green. Well, the tea-pot was not at all touched .#.
and not a word about the massacre that is going on in Canton, which
sending up tea as it does, brings home the horrors of war to every-
body's fireside. But there was a subject upon which, as an unmarried
woman, I feel very strongly—I allude to Bachelors. For myself, I
feel if I was a man I should be ashamed of myself to be a Bachelor.
It's mean and, cowardly, and altogether sneaking away from that
sition to which, there can be no doubt of it, Providence from the
st intended to call you.
“Therefore, what I read at the Deputation, pleased me mightily:
everything that goes with my notions in print always does. Speaking
of the Income-Tax, one of the Deputies told the ChancELLOR that he
knew hundreds of bachelors living at Clubs (that ought every one of
them to be pulled down, and salt and mustard sown on the foundations)
that, never, paid the Income-Tax at all, and therefore ought to pay a
Bachelor-Tax; and if I had only the laying of it on, I can tell you it
should be a pretty smart one.
“Heaven knows poor spinsters are taxed-which is a subject I will
not go into at present, but am quite ready to do if provoked–and why
not É.i.; Besides, if spinsters are spinsters, is it altogether
their own fault P. I will answer for myself—certainly not. It’s given
to a man to be allowed to ask where he likes; yes, man may open his
mouth to all the world; whilst a poor woman is expected to sit, with
her lips as close as an oyster, and, whatever may be her feelings, to say
nothing. Young men may never think of the compliment that’s
frequently paid them; but how often are º quietly, silently chosen
or husbands, whilst—gay and heartless—all the while they know
nothing of the matter?
“Now, Mr. Punch, a man having all these advantages over a woman,
—ought he not to be brought down a peg or two by the tax-gatherer?
And then their impertinence is, at times, enough to make one's blood
run cold. You will see a ºf 5. look at the wonders of the
creation before him (need I say ude to my own sex?) just as if he was
looking into a basket of peaches, and didn’t know which to pick; or, what
is worse, didn't know or care whether he wanted a peach at all, but still
just iooked at the fruit for the curiosity of the thing. Well, nine
times out of ten, he may—if so properly minded—choose his peach;
and, oh dear! the lovely peaches f have seen plain young gentlemen
take to themselves, as if they were only brought into the world for
them and nobody else! Well, I don’t so much complain of that. No;
but this. Of course the gentleman may choose his peach, but whoever
heard of the peach choosing the gentleman f No.: Sir, the peach may
be a lovely peach, with º: a velvet cheek, and such a tint and colour
on it, but there it must lie, Sir ; lie as cool as it can in its leaves, with
its heart melting, but with never a tongue to say as much. Mr. Punch,
—I am now—no, it matters not, and why should Itellit—still I am now
so many years old; and I myself was once a peach / I have been gazed
at; I have seen others selected; I have not been removed from my
basket, and the leaves have shrivelled and gone yellow—not positively
ellow, but just a little turned, but at the present writing, and I can
y my hand upon my heart, and say with no fault of mine—I am a
spinster peach,
“Which brings me back to a Bachelor-Tax. And I will say this : if
a man will not pay his money in the way of wedding-rings, he ought
to pay it in another. I look upon a wilful bachelor as a man who
defrauds the commerce of his country, and robs the Government of
soldiers and sailors. Such a man is a lawful subject for what I believe
is called an impost. At such a man I would have every tax-gatherer
point, the finger of scorn,--with a pen in it!
“Believing as I do that every sane man who is single (if there is such
a thing) is, at the age of five-and-twenty, a proper subject for the
marriage, ceremony, I would have a graduated tax, beginning at that
time, and ending at sixty—at sixty to be legally and morally exempt.
I haven't §: settled in my mind the amount of tax to be paid by the
bachelor, but I would have it made as crushing as possible to bring it
as near as it might be to the expenses of the holy state.
“Trusting, Mr. Punch, that you will give the subject your best con-
sideration, that heartless bachelors may be punished, and spinsters
with only too much heart avenged, I remain, your constant admiring
reader, “INVITA MINERVA.”
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
. ."We've been very much pleased with a motion that we’ve
read in the paper about taxing bachelors; which we think delicious ;
and-the wretches 1-hope it will be, done. , But there is a sort of
bachelor who ought to be taxed until he cried for mercy, and couldn't
any. *f; bear it; and that is, the bachelor flirt, that goes about
society ike a bee about a garden, and settles for good and all no where.
“Nothing so teazing, Mr. Punch, to a serious mind, as to seem to
play with what we’ve heard called (my aunt used to name 'em so) the
responsibilities of life, which the bachelor flirt continually does, always
Qutraging—as one of our parlour-boarders says—the purest and the
holiest earpectations /
“Now, Mr. Punch, you're always so good, and therefore do fix a
prºpºr rate of taxes on the bachelor flirt. º: instance:
-- How many bouquets º to signify something like a declaration?
How, many squeezes of the wedding-ring finger ought to go for
honourable intentions?
“How many times going on one knee, and presenting therefrom a
plate of cakes, ought to be taken as “your slave for ever?”
“And none of these intentions properly carried out, do name what
ought to be the rate of tax on the ". flirt.
“We remain, dear Mr. Punch, your affectionate readers,
“MARY, JANE, AUGUSTA, MATILDA, ANNE.”
Mr. Punch prints the above two letters from a large number received
on a question of evidently increasing interest— a Bachelor-Tax. He
may possibly feel it his duty to print two or three other epistles on the
same important subject.
THE SWELL’S DICTIONARY OF SNEERING.
. BoBE, s. (commonly pronounced BAw). Anything or anybody claim-
ing attention which a Swell is disinclined to vouchsafe: whosoever or
whatsoever compels him to think.
EMONSTRATIVE, a. Expressive, by outward manifestation, of any
emotion whatever except scorn and malice.
DIDActic, a. Instructive in any particular wherein a Swell does not
want, or does not wish, to be instructed. Assertive of anything which
he dislikes to have asserted.
INDIGNATION,...s. A real emotion of anger, mingled with contempt
and disgust, excited by injustice or insult inflicted on oneself.
VIRTUE, s. Bosh. Vulgar sentiment cherished by the middle classes.
VIRTUous, a. Unreal, fictitious, vulgarly sentimental, snobbish.
VIRTUous INDIGNATION, a. and s. An unreal and inconceivable
emotion of anger with which some eople pretend that they are affected
by injustice or insult inflicted on others. See VIRTUE and WIRTuous,
The Silent Shell.
A PUFF in the corner of a Newspaper, pretending to be a critical
paragraph, commences with the statement following:—
“The narrative of Admiral. NAPIER's Baltic Campaign has burst upon the politi-
cal and naval world like a bombshell."
Yes; very much like one of those bombshells which the gallant
Admiral poured into Cronstadt. The explosion has made a wonder-
fully s IlolSe.

VERMIN
IN PRINT.
E have for some time been
pretty free from the vermin
of the press; the Hºakeful
hºusels and the Penny Pole.
ca's sent forth to use their
wicked teeth, and exhale
their filthy odour to the
hurt and discomfort of timid,
decent people. However, we
ave now a thing let us
call it the Carrion Fly-pub-
lished § WILLIAM MANGE,
JUN, who has been, duly
consigned to gaol, with the
motorious Bugnale, for the
dirtiness of publication. MR;
JUSTICE ColerIDG' require
bail in the sum of £l00; but
somehow, sureties for the
recious MANGE were not
orthcoming at so costly a
risk. Hence, MANGE is
under a lock. -
PRINCE ALBERT, in an
after-dinner speech, once
cclared constitutional, in-
stitutions to be upon their
trial... Well, for our own part—though we have an inborn reverence
for the British Constitution, the Bill of º habeas corpus, and
all the liberties indigenous to the British soil—we are now and then
apt to yearn for the exercise of a little judicious despotism; to be
especially administered in the attempted reformation of satyrs like Bug-
DALE, of mandrils like MANGE. The publisher of the Carrion Pºy will,
doubtless, in due season be remitted to the care of the Governor of
Coldbath Fields. He will there be inducted into the process of oakum-
teazing. Very good... But nºt even the sanative tar. can cleanse the
dirty ; ers of the dirty publisher who seeks his daily bread in daily
filth, in j, slander.
ow, by means of a little gentle despotism, we would have MANGE,
in a manner made to live upon his publication even in gaol. As
thus: To his º gruel should be added one or two copies at least
of the Carrion Fy reduced to pulp, which MANGE should be compelled
to swallow, on pain of no gruel whatever..., Granting that the pulp may
be a little insipid, or, from the taint of the bad printer's ink, a little
acrid, we would allow it, to be further seasoned with a judicious
mixture of hyssop juice and vinegar. As black-beetles are killed with
poisoned wafers, so would we physic the vermin of the press with the
poison of their own prints.
NELSON AND THE NATION.
It was stated in the House the other night, that the completion of
the Nelson Column (which was entrusted to the Government in 1844),
had been delayed solely by the want of money; and that although the
sum which was required would not exceed £5000, “it was not thought
desirable. just now to apply for it. In other words, the nation, as the
world well knows, is thoroughly hard up, and cannot yet afford to pay
its debt of honour, although it has already taken rather more than
half a century's credit. o wonder that the Constitutionnel should
talk of English pauperism . . Nor that other amiable dovesquills on the
Qontinent, should speak of our “declining power,” when to raise
£5000 is thought by Government to be beyond it !
All things considered, it is fortunate for our credit that the wish of
the more thoughtless of us was not realised in the late war, and that
the navy-list failed to produce a “Second Nelson.” We should
otherwise have been plunged still more inextricably into debt; for, of
course, a century or so, hence we should have voted him a column:
and equally of course, having º just completed the present one, the
nation being then as now upon, the very brink of bankruptcy, would
have been told by its advisers that it “was not desirable” to pay its
debts at present.
“As You Were" in France.
IN a speech otherwise intelligible enough, the EMPEROR OF THE
FRENCH is reported to have informed the Chambers that-
“The rivers of France, like the revolution, return to their bed that they may
never more issue from it.”
. This simile appears to signify that revolution in France, like the
inundatiºns, is ultimately to subside into the old state of things.
This declaration on the part of NApoleoN THE THIRD must be rather
good news to the Count DE CHAMBORD.
LORD BROUGHAM AT CANNES.
THE papers tell us that LoRD BRough AM has left London for
Cannes. And for this good reason. His lordship would avoid the
cold winds of the next two months; and so return to the Lords, again
to ply that well-worn historic broom among the cobwebs of law, fighting
as, for almost fifty years he has fought, the spiders of abuse. There
was a time when HARRY BROUGHAM would have set his teeth
against a tornado, giving it something stronger than it brought; but
even giants feel the touch of time, and disdainfully think, but still
must think, of flannel and the east wind. And so BRQUGHAM hies from
smoky Westminster and the muddy Thames to sapphire-bright Cannes
and the deep-blue Mediterranean. And there—it is the hope of Pºnch
of Punch, who in his day has had his joke with the giant, but still a
joke with no abatement of reverence—there may the great law.
reformer, the great national schoolmaster, amid orange groves, and
beneath an unclouded heaven, find health and strength visit him with
their best influences. There may his blood run clearly and sparklingly;
d and there, whilst March winds bite sharp British attorneys to the
bones, there may gentle gales impart another freshness, a newer vigour
to the brain of the great man who, for two-score years and more, has
wrestled with ignorance and wrong, and again and again trod them
howling in the dust! The labours of BROUGHAM have made him in his
old age almost a sacred man among men. It is well that we should
look reverently, tenderly towards the light that still remains to the
world; a light that may burn the longer that it burns sometime in a
gentle air; a light, too precious, to be carelessly visited by an east
wind, even though blowing in hallowed Westminster.
THE CIRCLE OF FASHION.
A CoMMIssion is to be shortly appointed by Government to take
the exact measurement of the Circle of Fashion. A prize of a very
large amount will be awarded to the clever mathematician who suc-
ceeds in ascertaining the right dimensions. Several old Calculating
Boys, who have grown grey in endeavouring to measure the Quadrature
of the Circle, are hard at work upon the problem; but very little hopes
are entertained of their succeeding, as the present Modes de Paris have,
in width and extravagance, completely outgrown the recollection of the
oldest JENKINs on the ... press, and are diametrically opposed
to anything that has hitherto appeared in any one of the numerous
Circles of Fashion.
THE MISERIES OF A WHITE NECK-CLOTH.

the delusion, I really believe, that I was a pet parson' I suspected

ment for a pair of embroidered braces !
“Give your Orders . The Waiter's in the Room.”
FROM the Times' account of the recent Ordens-Fest at Berlin it
appears that KING CLICQUOT manages to keep some 550,000 courtiers,
soldiers, and employés happy, on very poor pay, at the cost of £3848 per
annum in stars, crosses, medals, and bits of ribbon. We often hear of
}. being held by the button; official Prussia appears to be held by
the button-hole.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
FEBRUARY 16th. Monday. In the Lords, “honourable mention”
was made of MR. SHEEPshANks, who has presented his magnificent
collection of pictures to the nation, on the simple condition that a
building shall be erected at Kensington to hold them. He modestly
adds a “wish” that the Exhibition should be open to the working
classes on Sunday evenings. As the Government have violated the
only condition imposed by MR. TURNER in bequeathing his works to
the country, it is not probable that they will be more conscientious
with regard to MR. SheepshANks. We have got his deed of gift, and
he can’t help himself, hooray! -
The Commons kicked MR. JAMEs SADLEIR (member for Tipperary
county) out of the House, for fraudulent practices. There was no
division, and therefore the public, and more especially Glasgow, had no
opportunity of seeing MR. John MACGREGóR, late governor of the
British Bank, record his vote in testimony of his high-minded and
ready tongued indignation against such persons as SADLEIR. The
House soon rose, but a false alarm that the opposition intended to
storm the Treasury benches cost MR. HAYTER some violent whipping
and ministerial members some violent language against the faithful
official who had needlessly summoned them from pleasure to duty.
Tuesday. LoRD GRANVILLE did not believe that ADMIRAL SEYMoUR
had been proceeding to conciliate the Canton people with red hot shot.
The LoRD CHANCELLOR announced seven bills for consolidating the
criminal law. LoRD BROUGHAM said, sensibly enough, that to pass
a digest of law through Parliament was absurd. Let them employ
first-class lawyers and adopt their work: CRANwokTH, by the way,
promised his seven bills “perhaps at the end of the week.” It is
needless to say that nothing more had been heard of them when the
Lords rose on Friday. -
SIR CHARLEs Wood said that the Government had not decided
whether they would send a new expedition to the Arctic regions, and
that the Resolute had not been pulled to pieces. LORD PALMERSTON
refused to give MR. CochRANE any information as to Naples, unless
BAILLIE would say that he represented BOMBA. There was talk this
evening and on Friday about the Megaera frigate, supposed to have
been sent out leaky, but the only good that was #. by the debate was
the First Lord of the Admiralty gaining, at length, a definite, con-
viction that there was a difference between a ship's bows and her
bottom, SIRC's enlightenment was effected by SIR John PAKING-
TON, who has of late given much attention to the best means ºf impart-
ing instruction to he É. persons. LORD PALMERSTON obtained a
select committee on Election Bribery, HENRY...BERKELEY deriding,
and MR. HoRsMAN brought in a Bill for the abolition of the oppressive
custom of taking tolls at turnpikes in Ireland. Again the House was
up before dinner-time.
Wednesday. SIR John PARINGTON introduced, an Education Bill.
He described it as neither compulsory nor fº and nothing worse
can be said against such a measure. But there is no immediate hope
of the sort of legislation required, for two hostile, parties unite to
hinder it. The Church party, English and Scotch, will, permit no
education unless the priest prescribe it, and the Liberals º
being so liberal as to leave it to a parent to say whether his children
shall be taught or not. The Bill is meritorious in intention, but will
be of little avail. The wisdom of the Legislature prefers building
gaols to building schools.
. Thursday, LoRD DERRY Fº notice of his intention to throw squibs
into the Cabinet, apropos of the bombardment of Canton; and LoRD
CLANRICARDE proposed a resolution condemnatory of our system of
Government in India. The DUKE OF ARGYLL replied that things
had been bad there, but were mended, and that general abuse was
unpractical. What particular business CLANRICARDE has with India
one hardly knows, except that his father-in-law, GEORGE CANNING,
Was º but did not go out as Governor-General, and that his son,
ULICK CANNING, singularly, misconducted himself there, a point to
which Mr. Punch s Yecially alludes for the sake of also expressing his
satisfaction at reading that this young fellow (best known as LoRD
DUNKELLIN), performed an act of real because rational gallantry in
the Persian expedition.
In the Commons, SIR GEORGE GREY promised a Bill for reforming
the Corporation of London; but assigned as a reason for delay, the
fact, that the LoRD, MAYOR, and Common Council had been passing
resolutions on the subject. This kind of excuse is very characteristic of
SIR GEORGE. M.R. Locke KING moved for leave to bring in a small
Reform Bill, which was to make the franchise for counties the same as
in boroughs. LoRD PALMERSTON opposed it—as º to our theory
of representation—LoRD JoHN RUSSELL supported it, stating that the
country did not require any large measure of reform just now. SIR
JAMEs GRAHAM, Peelite, supported it, and MR. SIDNEY HERBERT,
Peelite, opposed it; and on the division the Government was placed in
the peculiarly enviable position that it would have been beaten by its
own men, had not the Conservatives come to the rescue, and saved it
by 192 against 179.
Mr. Punch presents his compliments to the public, and begs to
tender his sincere congratulations upon the fact that, MR. Spoos Ey's
motion against Maynooth was P. tly got rid of this Thursday
evening. After a few volleys of mud from the ultras on both sides,
and a little easy-going sophistry from men who felt that the topic
should be dropped, MR. Stoos ER was defeated by 167 to 159.
LORD PALMERSTON gave some technical reasons why Colon EL
TULLOCH had not been promoted for his Crimean services. These
reasons of course were the most everlasting humbug; but it would not
do for him to say that the Horse Guards insisted on snubbing the man
who had done so much to expose the blockheads who destroyed an
ariny. -
Friday. That furious ultra-radical, the EARL of STANHoPE, made a
|. (and actually carried it) for giving more publicity to the pro-
ceedings of the Lords, especially by printing the names and numbers
on divisions. Several of the inferior officers of the House fainted away
at this abnegation of dignity, and were so weak throughout the ré:
mainder of the brief sitting, as to be reduced to make tolerably civil
answers to strangers. One of these officials actually used the word
“Sir” in replying to a gentleman, a phenomenon not within the
memory of the oldest habitué of the chamber.
In the Commons the Battle of the Budget began. MR. DISRAELI
and MR. GLADSTONE, two gentlemen who conceive themselves mise-
rably misplaced—the one on the wrong side of the Speaker, and the
other on the second row below the gangway—delivered themselves of
attacks upon the Government scheme of finance. Mr. Disºrii thought
that the whole Income-Tax ought to be now taken off, because taking
off the Ninepence would leave a deficiency, which would render it
impossible to remove the rest of the tax in 1860; and MR. GLADSTONE,
who possesses agood deal more capability of argument, urged “economy,”
which is doubtless a good thing, but which, recommended by one o
the statesmen who starved the war with Russia, has a meaning rather
distasteful to the public, who had to pay awfully for ARERDEEN
stinginess. Mr. Punch always desires to do justice, and will therefore
add, that MR. DisBAELI omitted all pyrotechnics in dealing with a
rave subject, and that MR. GLADSTONE's oratorical power has seldom
een more vigorously put forth than in the yindication of his own
financial system. SIR GEORGE LEwis and MR. WILSON made the
formal defences, but bigger guns were reserved for the final struggle.
The debate was adjourned by MR. JAMES MACGREGOR of Sandwich.
(N.B. Copy this address, to prevent painful mistake.)
THE LATE PRESTON BROOKES.
THE man who struck down SoMNERs is himself levelled. Almost as
suddenly has death assailed and beaten the champion of the slave-whip
and the slave-cofile. The members of Congress wear black about their
arms for three months in memory of the departed BR90KES. M.R.
SOMNERs, in memory of BRookEs, has worn black a little longer. But
the man is . to his account, where we hear of no distinction of
skin, and where even, PRESTON BROOKEs may be on a level with a
Papuan nigger. Very brief has been the triumph of BROOKEs. A short
while ago, and grateful slave-owners were in many ways recording
their gratitude to their champion. A short while since, and how many
were the gold-headed canes sent to BROOKEs Cames of testimony.
And now has BROOKEs himself gone to Styx!
DISAPPOINTMENT |
“HERE, ALPHONSE, take away this canvas.”
So spoke AGNES, of Spanish Chesnut Place, Manchester Square. I
leaned anxiously forward. . I thought the lovely, creature had been
|...}}. her pretty shell-pink fingers into the Canal of Wenice, or
had been giving the last stroke of execution to some ferocious Bandits
at Bay, or wasting her precious moments, in the vain pursuit of
Finding the Body of Haroli, but no—instead of some fascinating copy
from the teeming portfolio of Nature, or some poetic transcript from
the many-tinted easel of Fancy, my astonished eyes rested on a Vulgar
poodle-dog, with a long knitting-needle stuck through its curly tail, that
was resting on a cushion in the middle of a large Berlin Woolframe!
MR, SPOONER's ANNUAL DEBATE.
MAYNooth comes but once a year,
But when it comes it is severe.
Livery Looking Up.
By accounts received from Athens we learn that, for one of the
Financial Commissioners who are to be established in that City,
“France has named M. DE PLUCH, who is represented as being a very
able person.” One would have thought that M. DE PLUCII was less
adapted for a public office than for a domestic situation.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ANTI-CRINOLINE ASSOCIATION (LIMITED),
Is with no less pride than
leasure we announce the
act that, fired with philan-
thropy and watered with the
tears of joy and gratitude of
gentlemen in general, and
their own husbands in par-
ticular, a number of noble-
minded and self-sacrificing
ladies have associated for
procuring the collapse of
Crinoline, and imposing some
restraint upon feminine ex-
travagance. We understand
that for this purpose it is
roposed forthwith to send a
#. to the EMPRESS
of THE FRENCH, to whom,
as een of the Fashions,
it is believed we mainly owe
the wide dresses which are
now in vogue, and the long
bills which as husbands we
are forced to pay for them.
By pointing out the suffer-
ings both in purse and person
which have been caused by
- - Crinoline, it is hoped her
Majesty may be induced to break off her adhesion to it, and conduct
her fashionable government upon, principles more moderate. If this
be granted, we may look upon the air-expanded petticoat as bein
quite exploded, for the game of follow-my-leader is nowhere playe
more regularly than in the highest, or we now should say the broadest,
fashionable circles. -
In case, however, of the failure of the deputation, it is proposed to
set on foot a female Temperance Society, in which ladies of confirme
intemperance in dress may enrol themselves as members, and take the
pledge ...! extravagance. Lecturers will be º: throughout
the º om to advocate the cause of soberness in feminine attire, and
will each be attended by a travelling assistant, who will exhibit herself
nightly as a “frightful example” of the now besetting vice of over-
dressing. Statistics will be furnished of the fortunes which are lost in
following the fashion, and of the families who have been reduced
because the petticoats have not been; and whose present narrowness
of means has mainly been induced by the wideness of their dresses.
And, moreover, illustrations will be brought in the pictures of our
ancestresses, whose costumes we were used to think the breadth of
absurdity, and only fit to figure in the broadest of broad farces; but
which it will be shown by comparative anatomy were structures far
less monstrous than those which have been raised by their crinolineal
descendants.
MARY ANN’S NOTIONS.
“Now, if you º my dear Mr. Punch, I think I have got some-
thing to say to which you will º dare to fasten any of those ridicu-
lous little notes of yours, which I know are meant good-naturedly
enough, but which I do not think it is quite fair to add to what one of
your contributors sends you..., Let the readers find out what is wrong
in what I say (if there is anything, which of course I deny), and do not,
you be so inconsistent as to print a thing in your columns, and then
try to show that it ought not to be there at all.
“I have been to Parliament., Papa took Lizzy HAMERTON (who is
staying with us) and me last night. It was a dreadfully stupid subject,
and I told Papa so, and suggested his taking us another evening, but
he declared that we should see Parliament to great, advantage, as it
was what he called a field-night. We girls were put behind a grating,
for fear we should fascinate the members, and make them forget their
precious country, and Papa went to the other end of the place, and we
could see him in a sort of pew over a clock, sitting near LoRD Over-
STONE, who I believe is a remarkable man, though I never knew
anything remarkable about him, except that when he was MR. LLoyd
he spelt his name with only one “L.’ There, was an old gentleman in
the right hand gallery who came up, and deliberately laid himself down
at full length, and, because the light troubled his eyes, he opened a
great Parliamentary paper, and wº up his old bald head in it,
entirely hiding himself, like a ridiculous ostrich, and, I suppose,
fancying nobody could see him. LoRD STANLEY, I saw, too, in the
opposite gallery, writing notes of the speeches, and working as hard as
the men who sat below us, scribbling those columns upon columns
which spoil the newspapers. And dear SIR BULwer LYTTON, I saw
him, sitting next to the other novel-writer, MR. DisrAELI, and ioni,
John RusseII, who I don't believe can be a clever man at all,—why,
there looks to be nothing of him—and I could just see my dear LQRI
PALMERSTON for a moment as he came up the place to his seat; but
of all the insulting holes to thrust ladies into, where they can scarcel
see or be seen, and hear very badly, that grated hutch is the worst
eversaw. I would not keep rabbits there.
“The talking was all about the Budget, and it might all have been
said in half-an-hour, though when we came away they had been at it
for hours. How MR. GLADSTONE, can go on for such a time, never
stopping, and never seeming at a loss for a word, I cannot imagine.
He talked for two hours and a half, and I thoroughly agree in all that
he said; and if you come to consider, it is a shame to have any taxes
upon the poor old jº. tea and sugar. Why not take it off such
things as those, and lay it on double and treble, and twice that, if you
like, upon men's cigars, and racehorses, and especially upon liquors of
all kinds, which it would be a very good thing to discourage the drink-
ing, for you can never take up a newspaper without finding that some
very shocking thing has been done, by persons under the influence of
drink; and if you made it so dear that they could not buy it,
there would be nothing tyrannical in that, and half the crimes
would, not be committed, especially those against poor women
and children. MR. GLADSTONE perfectly convinced me that he was
quite right, and though I could not see LoRD PAIMERSTON, I am
certain that he must have been convinced also, and that he made up
his mind to vote against that stupid CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer,
who is always doing stupid things, and I read of him only the other
morning that he had brought in three bills into the House of Lords,
about divorce and other matters, and proved that he did not under-
stand them the least bit in the world. A person who would impose
taxes upon a poor old creature's tea and sugar, when you know that
these are almost the only comforts they have, and I wonder how you
would like to be obliged to give '#. pale ale, and your claret, and
your iced punch, and your gin slings, and have no comfort, but tea,
and that to be taxed, I say that I quite agree with the Times, that such
a man is quite unfit to be LoRD é. As for his speech last
might, it had nothing whatever to do with the question, and I did not
listen to a single word of it. I was very sorry that SIR BULwFR.I.YTTON
did not speak, but I suppose that his mind is far too great to descend
to such rubbish as they were talking. Fancy a man who could write
Zanoni condescending to debate whether tea, shall be one, and three:
pence or one and sixpence'. There ought to be clerks and such kind
of people kept to settle, such trash, and the clever men ought only to
discuss noble subjects like wars, and alliances, and the marriages of
kings and queens.
“But the more I see the more I am convinced that men are—I wish
I might use the word—it begins with H. I am certain of it. , Talk,
talk, talk, I, I, I, gabble, gabble, gabble round and round subjects,
which º could settle at once if they were not thinking of something
and somebody else, beside the matters they pretend to be minding.
Humbugs!—there—it’s out, and now scold away at
“Your affectionate
“Saturday.” “MARY ANNE.” 1
! We append one note only to this intolerable epistle, and that is to say, that any
other letter resembling it will most assuredly be the last of the sories.
SANCTITY UNDER FALSE PRETENCES.
A PROCLAMATION, published by the Inquisition, has been posted up
at Rome, declaring one CATHERINE FANELLI, who has been passing
herself off as a saint, to be an impostor, and to have been sentenced by
the Holy Office to twelve years’ imprisonment. Her impostures it
describes as having consisted simply in certain supernatural preten-
sions, for which an imprisonment º twelve years appears rather severe;
One month at the House of Correction would probably be considered
to meet the corresponding case in this country; and we are almost
tempted to regret that we have no Inquisition, to commit, as rogues
and vagabonds, our Sabbatarian humbugs and antidramatic Mawworms,
who endeavour to pass themselves off for saints.
Curious Calculation-
THE united ages of the several jokes that met together in a Bur:
lesque on a recent festive occasion, amounted to not less than 1573
years. This gives an average of 85 years to each joke. Several of the
old veterans showed no visible signs of decay, but on the contrary
from their vigorous condition gave every promise of delighting the
public for many a long year to come.
SINGULAR DELUSION.—MR. SpooneR has got into his head, the
curious notion, and nothing apparently will ever get it out again, that
he is an APOSTLE SPOONER!

[FEBRUARY 28, 1857.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN THE DARK.
N the House of Lords
the other evening,
LoRD BRough AM be-
n to brush up the
ord CHANCELLOR a
bit as to how the Sta-
tutes were Hºjš
towards that consoli-
dation, so devoutly to
e wished; and in
reply, LoRD CRAN-
worth stated, that
during the recess cer-
tain bills had been pre:
F. which would
consolidate the Sta-
tute Law affecting cri-
minals, and that—
“It was his wish to pro-
ceed with them at an early
yeriod of the session, but
e would not go further
until he saw his way
clearly.”
- Giving the LoRD
E CHANCELLOR all ho-
E mour for his wish, we
fear there is small
likelihood that we
shall see it realised,
so long as he imposes
the condition which
his last words seem
to indicate. If his progress, with the bills be made dependent oil his ableness to “see
his way clearly,” we think the “early period” will prove a mere period of #. and
the words “at the Greek Calends” would come nearer to the truth....We say this without
meaning to depreciate too much his lordship's powers of vision, but it can be no news to
THE LORD CHANCELLOR
any one to hear that they have somewhat suf-
fered from advancement, both of time and place.
The fogs of Chancery, we know, are such as
must impair the strongest mental eyesight; and
are a sufficient cause why those who ſº their
way in their proceedings through the Courts
should make such tardy progress. At the same
time, when we find so bright a luminary of the
law as the LORD CHANCELLOR, who, ought by
rights to shine the foremost light of the profes-
sion, acknowledging thus candidly that he is in
the dark, we can but think that to, prevent, his
getting in bad odour, it would be but right to
give him an extinguisher.
SINGULAR PHENOMENON.
SIR CHRISTOPHER TAwNY (a great favourite
in the North) has some wonderful old Port
Wine, which he says he laid down at the time of
the birth of his eldest daughter. The wine is,
undoubtedly remarkably fine, but , the most
wonderful thing about it is that, whereas the
wine, is thirty-two years old, the young lady,
who is still unmarried, is only just entering her
three-and-twentieth year! SIR CHRISTOPHER
says that his daughters so far differ in body and
temper from his wine, that the longer he keeps
them the younger he finds they grow !
Orators Dumfounded.
THE move of the Government in hiº; in
the Budget so early in the Session has had all
the effect of an Early Closing Movement on
the mouths in opposition, and has even shut up
MR. DISRAELI #. by forestalling all the
questions he had prepared himself to ask.
SOME MORE CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF
JOHN BULL.
How JoHN BULL was humbugged after all.
WELL, my brace of Scotchmen went up to the farm, and like shrewd
hard-working men, of business, as they were, at once set about the
inquiry PAM had charged them with. At first the keepers tried their
grand airs on the pair—were snappish, and saucy, and umorous, an
mighty short in their answers, with “marry, come ups,” and “you
ask me no questions, and I’ll tell you no lies,” and “don’t you wish
you may get it,” and so forth. And, truly, if the two old fellows had
not been as tough as mails, and as patient as a brace of JoBs, they
might have lost temper a thousand times, and most likely flung up
their task in disgust.
Then the rogues, finding their sauciness without avail, tried flattery,
and mighty civil they were, I promise you, with their tongues in their
cheeks all the while. But this plan succeeded no better than the other.
The two old fellows stuck to their work, regardless alike of big words
and bluster, or soft sawder and flummery. They were up and about
early and late. º saw and questioned everybody; looked into
º ; had up the poor old fiddler under examination for º;
overhauled all the contents of the store-rooms, where they found a
precious mess, I can assure you; took an account of all that John had
sent up for the use of the watchers; in short, made a thorough good
job of what they were sent to do, as PAM had bade them, “without
fear or favour.” And having completed their task, they set off home,
to report to their employer.
Meanwhile, º the time spent on their iº and report, the
affairs of Nick had fallen into a very bad way. The old rogue's rag-a-
muffias-stout fellows as they were-were thrashed again and again,
till at last they were beaten out of the old stone house they lived in
and the roof was fairly burnt over their heads. Qld. NICK had die
some time before this happened of sheer heart-break, it was, thought,
for a terrible drubbing John BULL's watchers had given his black-
guards against odds of six to one, and his son, ALIGK, a decent lad
enough (considering who was his father), had come into what the old
man had left behind. The lad was ready enough to renounce his
father's tricks, and to promise anything for a quiet life. So on con.
dition of his marching his blackguards off the ground, and *...* out
of arm's-length of the Turkey-pen, and giving sureties for good beha.
viour, John agreed to let go scot-free, to break up his own
fºliº of watchers and keepers, and to allow bye-gones to be
ye-golles.
Many of his friends thought John was a little too easy with his
enemy. But that was always his way, as all readers of his history
know. He never won a law-suit, but he gave away, half the dam
he received, and in most cases, to the man he had been at law with.
Mighty glad, I promise you, were all the family at the manor-house to
see the r fellows from the moor-farm safe home again. John
BULL ordered half-a-dozen oxen to be roasted whole, to feast ’em :—a
row of butts of October were set abroach on the lawn; there was
d|jumping in sacks and grinning through horse-collars, fireworks at
night, and a dance and a supper in the servants’-hall—and who but the
watchers and keepers!
. Some of the latter, indeed, who had come home before this, had
given themselves mighty great airs among the servants, on the
strength of their doughty deeds against Nick and his blackguards.
As usual’twas the emptiest puppies that talked loudest and made the
bravest figure. The best men }. their tongues. But when it came
to finding places for the lads that had come home, I am afraid it
must be owned JoHN's upper servants did not, act fairly by their
master. At least, it happened somehow or other that if ever there was
a good berth to be filled in the stables or in the saddle-room, harness-
room, or gun-room, it was sure to be f. away to one of those
very lounging, º: damdified JEMMY JEssayſIES, or LAzY
LAWRENCEs who had so neglected their business up at the moor-farm
and thereby been the isºft of so many a lusty honest poor fellow o
the watchers.
These bouncing, big-mouthed gentry told their own tales, of course;
and PAM, the steward, and Foxy, a *...; good dinner-
loving, unscrupulous old reprobate, who had charge of the gun-room,
either believed, or pretended to believe, every cock and bull story they
told. Anyone whoventured to hint at what STAG's inquiry had brought
to light about these very fellows, or to suggest that 'twould be well to
wait for the Scotchmen's report before giving places to these m
was pooh-poohed, and put down, as a factious, discontented, mischief-
making spirit.
But when at last the two old Scotchmen brought out their report, I
H. : you there was a fine commotion in the stables and gun-room.
ere were the very men whom the Scotchmen exposed, as the
authors of all the sufferings of John's lads, now pocketing his best
wages, and wearing his smartest liveries, and eating and ăţi. of
the best in his servant’s hall!
Now, some simple folks might have i. how savage
John had been o 3. year before with the conduct of these very fellows
—that he needed but have been told how they had been smu ed
into berths on the manor, to have at once made examples of the

scheming, saucy, shameless rascals, and turned every one of them out
of his service, with a good rap over the knuckles to PAM and Foxy,
for daring to recommend such puppies for fº. But he who
argues in this fashion knows but lie of John BULL. That gentle-
man's way has always been, after flying into one of his tremendous fits
of passion,--at the earliest opportunity to mop his forehead, re-settle his
wig, put down his cudgel quietly in the corner, call for a º a
tankard of home-brewed and the paper, and smoke and soak, and talk
and read himself back into good humour as fast as possible.
So it was now. Instead §. out the JEMMY JEssam IEs and LAZY
LAwRENCEs, from stables and gun-room, and thanking the two Scotch-
men for opening his eyes, John BULL allowed the JEMMY JEssayſIEs
and LAZY LAwRENCEs to stay where they were, and even to go about
complaining they were ill-used and calumniated men, and that the
Scotchmen were a pair of jº. old meddlers, who had vamped
up a º for the purpose of ruining them.
Nay, finding that John allowed this sort of talk to go unpunished,
they went so far as to propose § the Scotchmen upon trial, in
their turn; charging them with back-biting, false witness, defamation
of character, subornation, and other crimes too numerous to mention.
To this proposition PAM and Foxy were foolish, or knavish enough
to give way, and one morning the two Scotchmen—who were just
then expecting a handsome testimonial for their services—found them.
selves, somewhat to their astonishment, called on for their defence
against a charge of slanderously stabbing the reputations of better
men than themselves |
COMICALITIES OF THE SECTARIAN PRESS.
NYBody who reads the Papers
with a view to mere amuse-
ment, would do well fre-
quently to take up the so-
called religious journals. He
will find more absurdities in
them than he will find in
this periodical, or any other
— whether he chooses a
Popish or a Protestant pa-
er, it will not much signify.
ere follow a few extracts
from one of these publica-
tions, which may be peruse
with as much gratification as
is capable of being afforded
by folly. The paper in ques-
tion is a Roman Catholic one
- "º Venomous :
the Weekly Register. It con-
tains, firstly, a decree of the
-- Holy Inquisition” against
the abuses of “Magnetism,”
by which term animal mag-
netism seems to be particu-
larly intended; but this is
not quite clear. The abuses
indicated are the alleged
phenomena of somnambulism and clairvoyance: and in all these
matters a heretical deception is declared to be practised when physical
means are employed in order to produce effects not natural —
“Cum ordinentur media physica ad ºffectus non naturales.” As if
natural means could produce any other than natural effects. When
HERR ForMEs in the opera, toasts a skull in red fire on the point of
a cutlass, and summons Zamiel, who presently º in thunder-and-
º it is not the physical means employed, but the invitation,
which is supposed to cause the apparition of the demon. If a man
makes magnetic passes, inwardly invoking the devil all the while, if
the devil should come, or any other non-natural effect follow, the
physical means would have nothing to do with the result; the meta-
hysical volition ºf Besides, what are non-natural effects?
cre was a time when the Inquisition would have deemed the agency
of the electric telegraph preternatural; would perhaps have roasted
MR, WHEATstone alive, and probably dug up and calcined the bones
of OERstED. -
Next, in noticing a book bearing on Natural History, the reviewer,
in connection with the subject of cruelty to animals, demands, “Where
does this curiously morbid feeling of Protestants about animals come
from?, Have they forgot that all inferior greatures were placed under
man's dominion by their Creator?” As if that circumstance rendered
Protestant sympathy for the sufferings of brutes morbid. . A new
version of a popular Protestant canticle may be recommended to this

oleiul tune :-
“If I had a donkey wot wouldn't go-o-o-o,
Tell me not to wollop him I Wouldn't I though-o-o-o-oh l'"
K+
A little further on, there is an account of the funeral of an excellent
Roman Catholic.lady, with a heading of “ProtestANT Bigotry. At
HER GRAVE.”. The bigotry was exhibited by a Church parson, and is
thus described:—
‘...Notwithstanding the just remonstrances of MR. Sutton, the parson insisted on
ºciting over the remains ºf this Catholic lady, an alien service, equally offensive to
the living, and useless to the dead.”
Would a Roman Catholic priest, in a Roman Catholic country, have
served a Protestant corpse so? Not he, truly. He would have taken
i. care that it should not come into the churchyard at all. Which
oes the heekly Register consider the more violent bigotry: to insist
On º prayers over a body, or to refuse it interment in consecrated
groun
BLUE RUIN.
..FROM a statement in the United Service Gazette, it appears that some
little difficulty is experienced in getting young officers for the Royal
Horse Guards Blue. A commission in that distinguished corps is
rather expensive, not only to procure, but also to retain. The costume
and equipments are so costly as to render this regiment the heaviest of
the heavies, and the mess expenses are such that the young gentleman
involved in them very soon finds himself in a mess indeed. Horses,
inclusive of hunters, which animals of the chace are necessary to these
British chasseurs, run away with a deal of money, and an additional
sum is carted off in a dog-cart, which is a vehicle necessary to the
}. officer, rendered so perhaps º the puppies with whom he is
rought in contact. He is obliged to keep an opera-box, for which he
has toº to a pretty tune, and the only particular wherein he is not
obliged to live high is that of lodgings; for he must not reside in a
two-pair back, but is compelled to establish himself in handsome
chambers.
In addition to all these expenses, he is called upon to meet the calls
of Society, which are as onerous as those of the Royal British Bank;
and thus, in one way with another, the Cornet in the Blues is forced
to spend from £500 to £1000 a-year, besides his pay and allowances.
Such involuntary expenditure as this is taxation worse than the
Income-Tax, and is calculated to make any thinking Blue, if there is
one, look blue indeed, and his respected i. if the latter has to
provide the needful, look still bluer. . Colonels of the Blues, who are
accustomed to say, “It is useless for a young fellow to come to us
unless he can spend his £500 a-year,” will probably soon be reduced
d| to the necessity of ºff. officers as recruiting serjeants
advertise for private soldiers. e advertisements will perhaps have
to run in some such terms as these:–
ANTED A FEW FINE YOUNG GENTLEMEN of £500 to £1000
a-year and upwards, willing to serve the Queen as Cornets in HER MAJESTY's

8 Arills.
LITTLE TYRANTS AT HARROW.
WE understand that the fagging system has attained to a high state
of development at Harrow School. A correspondent informs us that the
juveniles of the sixth form have lately improved very gº upon the
}. tyranny which they were content, to practise, heretofore.
ormerly these young gentlemen were satisfied with indulging their
imperiousness º: a fag to hand them a book from a shelf
within two yards, of their august hands. They now, however, go the
length of calling the fag to desire another boy, in the same room, with
themselves, to speak with them. The head-master of Harrow, perhaps,
does not know }. certain other faculties of the human mind than the
moral and intellectual are in course of cultivation at the school.oyer
which he presides. The passions and propensities are also receiving
an education on the principle of mutual instruction, and the scholars
are schooling one another in pride, insolence, cruelty, and servility.
We would suggest that these evils constitute just that exceptional case
wherein the rod might be advantageously flourished as a corrective,
and we should see a little despot whipped not º without pity, but
with extreme pleasure; with the same delight as that with which we
should behold a great one-say KING BoMA-Under the infliction of
a good hiding. §. hope these few and mild observations may cause
the life of a junior boy at Harrow School no longer to resemble that
of a toad under the agricultural implement of the same name.

THE SORROWS OF GENTILITY.
THERE is a Novel written by a clever lady under the above title.
We do not know what the particular Sorrows may be that Gentility uses
its cambric handkerchief over in that sorrowful book, but we fancy
that the following are such as have cost the fine old lady in her life-
time many a scalding tear :—
It is a Sorrow of Gentility, when a rich uncle, or a fine pompous
relation, from whom one has expectations, drops in at the last moment
to dinner, and there happens to be nothing but mutton chops, or mince
veal, or cold meat in the house.
. It is a Sorrow of Gentility, when a lady is looking over the clean
linen to see whether it wants mending, or counting it to learn that it
is all right, for a stupid servant to show a visitor into the very room,
where the sheets are basking before the fire, and the shirts, &c., aré
lying perdu over the different chairs and sofas.
It is a Sorrow of Gentility to be caught doing any needlework,
excepting one's fingers are employed on a Berlin Wool hippopotamus,
or are morally F. in embroidering a butterfly or a snail on a
beautiful pair of mediaeval braces for a Puseyite pet parson.
It is a most mortifying Sorrow of Gentility to be caught in the act
of crying over a book, or weeping during a tragedy, or in fact giving
wº to any foolish emotion that common people are subject to.
t is an overpowering Sorrºw of Gentility to have plain-looking or
r people, with cottage-bonnets and big umbrellas, shown into
one's pew on a Sunday, simply because there happens to be plenty of
room in it.
It is an acute Sorrow of Gentility to be seen on a Botanic or Horti.
cultural Fête Day, in one's fine clothes, getting out of an omnibus a
shºrt distance from the entrance-gate.
It is a humiliating Sorrow of Gentility when a number of very
genteel persons, are waiting, or supposed to be waiting, for their
carriages, for a big calf of a man-servant to dart prominently forward,
and announce, in a tone loud enough for the shadow of BEAU
BRUMMERL to hear, “Your cab, Mum's, at the doorſ”
It is a Sorrow of Gentility, quite sufficient to make one faint, to be
seen, in, Londºn, or anywhere near London, when everybody else is
hundreds of miles out of town.
It is an aggravating Sorrow of Gentility when it becomes reported
that all your jellies and blanc-manges and creams and “sweets” are
made at }. ---
It is a º Sorrow of Gentility when the youngest daughters
get married first, and the eldest, in spite of balls, fine dresses, jewellery
portraits, puffs, and paragraphs in the Morning Post, &c., &c., still
remain heavily on hand. -
It is a most distressing Sorrow of Gentility to be caught by some
carriage visitors at an early dinner, and, after explaining to them most
elaborately that it is only your luncheon, for some ungovernable un-
birched brat of an En ...} fºil. to let the vulgar secret out.
It is an exquisite Sorrow of Gentility to have, on a Drawing-Room
Day, the effect of your beautiful dress completely spoilt by some fat,
unwieldy, stupid, c . City Alderman treading upon it just as you
are being ushered into the presence of Royalty.
It is an agonising, and uncurable, and inconsolable Sorrow of Gen-
tility to move all the stars, and garters of the aristocracy and fashion
in order to get into Almack's, and, after many rubs and snubs, to fail
in one's endeavours.
SOMETHING LIKE A MIRACLE.
THE Wienna Correspondent of the Times states that—
“The statue of the Virgin, which is to be erected at Rome in commemoration of
the promulgation of the of the Immaculate Conception is finished. While
the statue was being cast, the Priests chanted the Litany to the Holy Virgin, and the
workmen gave the responses. “Thanks to these excellent arrangements,’ says the
Ultramontane Volksfreund, “the cast was perfect.”
We shudder in imagining the scene described in the above paragraph.
Nobody can very well, in the natural course of business, do two things
at once; and if there are any two things that we should be disinclined
to attempt simultaneously, those two things are singing responses and
casting a statue. We should tremble very much to see a lot of Irish
bricklayers at, work on a scaffold, or climbing ladders, and . ng
hods, whilst they were also engaged in chanting litanies with their
priests; but the idea of workmen's attention divided between a chant
and the management of melted, metal overwhelms us with fright.
That no horrible accident attended such a process, conducted in such a
manner, is indeed wonderful; and we have not for some time met with
anything that looks so much like a miracle, as the successful casting,
under the circumstances, of this molten image.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
FEBRUARY 23Rp. Monday. As LoRi, CRANworth's Wills Bill goes
to a Select Committee, no more need be said about poor CRANNY’s
initiatory mull beyond mentioning that to-night, on the second reading,
the real lawyers spoke of it with the most aggravating contempt. . .
It is no longer necessary to attend to the i. recaution which
Mr. Punch suggested last week in reference to the name of the
Member for Sandwich. There is but one MR. MAcGREGoR in the
House of Commons. JoHN of Glasgow has accepted—and any
acceptance of his is a thing worth noting—an office under the Crown,
and vacates his seat. He did not ask for any Hundreds—this time—
but took the Stewardship of the Manor of Northstead. It has an
almost inappreciable, though disqualifying salary; but small as it is,
MR. John MACGREGOR will no doubt place it at the disposal of the
assignees of the institution that did fººt to say gave him—so
much credit.
The Battle of the Budget was renewed. LoRD JoHN RUSSELL
volunteered his aid to the Government, and in fact it is supposed that
there is no amount of assistance which he would withhold from almost
any Government defacto, even to the discharging a portion of their
duties. M.R. WHITESIDE explained, still more distinctly, that he and his
Conservative friends wanted office, and SIR. F. BARING said that he
knew that very well, and should do all he could to keep them out.
MR. WALPOLE, of course, was ready to vote anything that should enable
him to change, places, with SIR GEORGE GREY. CARDwell
deserted his friend, MR. GLADSTONE, and joined the Government
voters. He could not be Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Ministry
of which MR. GLADstoNE was a member....MR. MILNER GIBsoN
had listened to sº else's speeches with an attention not al-
together reciprocated by the House, and expressed his wish that
the Budget should be amended. SIR CHARIEs Wood, of course, con:
tended that it was so good as to be incapable of being amended; and
the House, after, rejecting MR. GEORGE BENTINCK's proposal, for
adjournment of the Budget until the Estimates were disposed of
(really so sensible a course that there is no wonder only, 25 supported
it against 477) divided upon the Main Question, which was whether
the Balancing Brothers of Westminster should take office vice the
Bottleholder, and decided that they should not, by 286 to 206,

[Which little bit of sophistry completely vanquishes CLARA.
A NUISANCE CORRECTED BY ITSELF.
To show to what an abominable extent the
nuisance of Encores has grown in Italy, we may
as well mention, that at the Scala, the other
evening, the audience was so taken with the
Piscatore dell' Onda, which is the last new pro-
duction of VERDI's, that they encored the entire
opera. Such an ovation was never known before,
and probably, never will be again!, Musicians
fainted over their violoncellos, and the prompter
fell asleep in his cabriolet-hood box. However,
the mischief did not stop there, for at two o'clock
in the morning it was discovered by a watchman
accidentally dropping in, that the singers could
no longer sing, and the audience could no longer
hear. The former, by dint of screaming, had lost
their voices, and the latter, from listening to so
much noise, had lost their hearing. How long
the singers had been º: without making
any sound, and how long the audience had been
listening without hearing anything, it is impos-
sible to conjecture; but it is very clear that it
only requires a few more salutary examples like
the above, and the annoying system of Encores
must be effectually j.
A Profitable Tax.
It is proposed, in the event of there being any
geficiency in the Revenue next year, that MR.
GLADSTONE, every time he taxes the patience of
the House, should pay an ad valorem tax, of not
less than .*. for the first hour, a shilling
for the second, and so to go on increasing every
succeeding hour. The intrinsic value, it is true,
will not be much, but it will be amply made up
during the session by the tremendous quantity.

Tuesday. LoRD DERBY fulfilled his promise of bombarding Govern-
ment in retaliation for the bombardment of Canton. , Everybody who
wished to injure the Government was conscientiously convinced that
the assault was unjust, unnecessary, and cruel, while all the Minis-
terialists were as clear in their conscience that nothing could be more
righteous and expedient, or more humanely effected. The important
question, whether English subjects residing abroad were never to have
any redress or protection until their case had been sent home and in-
structions obtained from Government, was at issue in the case, and the
Lords' decision, luckily, is that a Civis, Romanus is not to be left in
that highly comfortable situation, but that his QUEEN’s flag is to be
flapped instanter into his enemy’s eyes., . The sentimental part of
the case was worked as gravely as if noble lords who talked of the
innocent, polite, and friendly. Chinese, had never, heard that in Canton
itself Mr. Commissioner. YEH had tied up thousands of men and
women at his place of execution, and had them flayed alive, and cut
into slices, º that only a little time, back the amiable Cantonese
tortured a French missionary for three days, and then burned him. To
these people it was urged that we were to serve out justice in its most
winning guise, and lofty truth and forbearance.” The Lords, after a
debate to-night and on Thursday, voted that bombshells were more to
the purpose, by 146 to 110.
The remarkable WALMsley achieved another of those remarkable
failures for which he is chiefly renowned, SIR Joshua persists in
believing that it is he who is specially called to reform the represent-
ative system, and though everybody assures him, that he, is under a
mistake, and snuffs him out, counts him out, and serves him out in
every practicable way, he will never comprehend his true position,
This evening he wanted to refer the British Constitution to a Select
Committee, and it took some time before he could be abated. SIR CHAs.
Wood said that the Government had decided not to send a new expedi-
tion in search of SIR John FRANKLIN, believing that it would be useless.
That it would discover the Arctic hero it is almost impossible to
believe; that it would ascertain, where he and his, brave companions
had died, it is almost as jºi. to disbelieve, the only unexplored
region being attainable with slight peril and complete precision. It

Wednesday. The Irish Fish that invariably make their, appearance
early in the session, were seen this day, but speedily dived and disap-
peared. In other words, a plan of MR. M. MAHQN's, which he sº is
intended to give Irishmenthe right to catch their own fishes, and which
the Irish Attorney-General, who has caught his º some loaves with
them), disapproves, as leaving all the fish in Ireland unprotºted, was
rejected by 185 to 10. An astrologer would remark that MR. MMAHON
is a wyer, that his fish bills are º: and though Libra,
which means justice, is typified by scales, he had better leave the scaly
tribe to those born under Pisces. He will find the legal flesh-pot
answer better than the illegal fish-pot.
Thursday. Before going to China, LoRD CAMPBELL, obtained a
Select Committee to consider whether the law ought not to protect a
newspaper from actions for truthful reports of public meetings. John
thinks that speeches in Parliament, Convocation, and County and
Borough Meetings, ought to be published without danger; but not so
- d to some other assemblies, without limitation, and he believes
In re - -
that if perfect impunity be given, men will always be getting W public
meetings, in order to spout calumny for the press to report., There is
a singular, not to say insolent idea entertained by some lords and
others that the press has no discretion, and unless kept under the eye
of the police, will always be trying to injure some worthy man or other.
In the case of this proposed legislation, the journals have the remedy
in their own hand—short-hand. If Parliament refuses them immunity
for publishing its debates, let them cease to publish them. A week of
“no gallery” would send any reasonable measure very rapidly through
both Houses. -
MR. EwART's annual motion against Death Punishments is to be
limited this year to the abolition of the last penalty “except for treason
and murder.” The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER said that a report
of the Commission on Decimal Coinage was in preparation; and that
every attempt had been made to understand the subject. Several
members of the Commission were already aware that decem means ten,
and that it is easier to multiply by ten than by four, twelve, or twenty.
It is suggested that some decimal nursery rhymes would materia
aid the Commission in saturating the minds of the English people wit
the new system, as in about the time that darlings now baa-ing to
black sheep, thanking pretty cow that gave, and riding to Banbury
cross, are bothering for latch-keys, or angling for husbands, the
decimal 8. will be ready.
MR. CopDEN brought up the China business. He moved a reso-
lution condemnatory of the bombardment, and for a reference of the
whole subject to a Committee. MR. LABouchERE's answer was of
the windiest. SIR BULwer LYTTON thought that we ought to treat
the Chinese much more gently, and SIR John RAMSAY thought that we
had been treating them much too gently for fourteen years. SIR
ERSKINE PERRY would have voted against the motion, if it was
intended to turn out Ministers, but would support it because it was
just, a neat distinction. LoRD John Russell, went his hardest against
Government, and the debate was adjourned until
Friday, when (the Lords doing nothing) eleven more speeches were
delivered on the subject. Of the five by lawyers we need say nothing
and of the others little more except that SIR CHARLEs NAPIER defende
ADMIRAL SEYMOUR for having displayed spirit and resolution, articles
of which SIR. C. is a judge, that ADMIRAL BERKELEY, with that senti-
ment of true piety for w ich the BERKELEYs are notorious, took credit
to SEYMoUR for not having begun to fire until Sunday was over, and
that SIR JAMES GRAHAM, seeing a good chance of doing mischief, went
in for it with his wonted goût.
This evening people lounged about the clubs declaring that the Govern:
ºnent was gºing to be beaten that night, that MR HAYTER had whipped
five new lashes off in ºp his men, and that Dissolution was to
be proclaimed forthwith Mr. Punch therefore went down to the
House, and found SIR RICHARD BETHELL gracefully waving a very
niced. of dark kid gloves (with his hands inside them) in the face of
the Commons, at mid . MR. GLADSTONE taking acres of notes, and
LoRD PALMEkston hushed in a grim repose, which indicated that he

their whiskers? and hang about their clothes for hours and hours, and
sometimes days Mºi ? So much so, that any one can tell a mile
off whether the nasty things have been smoking or not. I’m sure it is
downright terrible to be shut up in a railway carriage with a *. of
confirmed smokers—for though they may not be smoking at the time,
still the unpleasant smell of their garments is such, as to make one
regret that Lond PALMERSTON will not bring in an Act of Parliament
to make every filthy smoker consume his own smoke.”
MRs. Robinson (1002, Old Gower Street). “It not only injures the
complexions, but the carpets also., Why, you have only to look at the
carpet of a room, in which the gentlemen have been smoking overnight,
and your own eyes will tell you whether it is injurious or not? I have
seen carpets (beautiful carpets, that must have cost 5s. 2d. a lº if
they cost a penny,) in such a disgraceful state that a blackbeetle, I’m
sure, would eat himself rather than walk over them l’” - -
Mrs. Biur stockºs (Minerva Hall, Bath). “If it is not injurious,
erhaps you would have the kindness to inform me the reason why we
ies are not allowed to smoke?”
Miss Twenty MAN (Willow Lodge, Briarton). “It’s all fuss and non-
sense, and I quite lose my temper when persons question me about the
injuriousness of tobacco. Of course, it is injurious ! Doesn’t it kill
spiders ? Doesn’t it stifle gnats, and flies, and even earwigs?, Isn't
it used in noblemen's and gentlemen's gardens to fumigate the plants?
Are not our hothouses and summerhouses smoked, when we want tº
; rid of the vermin? and really I half wish sometimes that it would
ave the same effect on the gentlemen, when they will persist in injuring
themselves (and annoying us) by smoking hours after hours to the
abominable extent they do! If I was called upon to say what a man was
I should answer it by giving this definition: ‘Man is the only anim
that smokes.’” -
MRs. BloomER (Lecturer on the Rights of Women, &c.). “It is in-
disputably of injurious effect, for that which has the unnatural power
of separating for so many consecutive hours the husband from the
partner of his joys, cannot well be beneficial in its results, any more
than it is humanising in its relations. It is my firm conviction that it
brutalises all those who partake of it, for it has been a source of sorrow
to me to notice that a husband, when he has been smoking to a late
hour at his club, invariably returns to his home in a much worse temper
than when he left it in the morning... He leaves happy and smiling—he
returns spiritless and discontented l’”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CHINESE BOY.
THE Chinese Boy to the war is gone,
In the House of Lords to floor'em
BHis friend YEH's sword he has girded On,
And his potlid set before him.
“Land of Tea,” said the Noble Lord,
“For sauce though Justice pays thee,
One Peer at least, without reward
Shall back, defend, and praise thee.”
The Champion failed—his attempt was vain,
But ambition won't knock under;
He’ll up and at 'em yet again
With a roar of empty thunder.
And say, “No stain shall sully me,
No dodge of factious knavery
I fight, the chief of the pure and free,
ºil disinterested bravery.”
FELINE INTELLIGENCE.
Among the enigmas of the second column of the Times we have been
lately not a little puzzled by the following:-
Lº: on Monday evening, the 16th inst., near Fitzroy Square, a large
TABBY CAT, with white throat and feet, aged 10 years. oever will take it
to MR. - shall receive ONE POUND REWARD. No
further reward will be offered.
Considering the visits and the shillings we have paid to the Regent's
Park Gardens and to Wombwell's Menagerie, our acquaintance with
zoology can be scarce below the average. But we must confess to
utter ignorance of the fact, that the age of cats may be discerned like
that of horses, and that each year of their lives is distinguishably
marked in them. We cannot help inferring this to be the case when
we find the years of a lost cat precisely stated, as ºf one of the
clues by which the finder may identify it: only we cannot help thinking
that for the guidance of people as ignorant as ourselves, the advertiser
should have added some instruction as to how the age of the animal is
to be discovered. We might recognise a rabbit by its length of ears,
but the years of a cat are not so plainly visible; and were we to catch
a stray one in our present want of knowledge, we could no more
ascertain if it were then in its tenth year, than we could undertake to
say in which of its nine lives it was existing when we caught it.
A Card.—For Naples.
MR; MIVART presents his Compliments to his Catholic Majesty,
FERDINAND, King of the Two Sicilies, and begs to be allowed to state that, at
the present critical juncture, he can accommodate at his well-known Hotel, any
Uncrowned Head seeking temporary retirement, with a most commodious suite of
Apartments, admirably appointed and fitted up, with the most delicate regard to
Royalty in distress. N.B. A Porter sits up all night. Italian spoken on the
Premises,
DUST FROM A BATH BRICK.
NINE hundred and . out of every thousand of Mr. Punch's
correspondents are compelled to be content with the certainty, that for
a fraction of one of his, golden, minutes they have *:::::: his
intensest attention—and that justice will be done. The thousandth
sometimes obtains public answer, MR. HENRY DALLAway, of Bath,
is one in a thousand. He, of all the personages referred to by Mr.
Punch in his remarks upon the mode in which the poor little children
at Bath were baulked of their pantomime, has addressed Mr. Punch
with a protest.
MR. DALLAWAY states that he “has sustained an unblemished cha-
racter for twenty-five years.” Upon this fact Mr. Punch begs to con-
gratulate MR. DALLAway; even, while temporarily unable to discover
its exact bearing upon the subject. Next he states, that on MR.
Čiurºs offering the Guardians ºf the Bath Únion a free admission
for 300 children, he, MR. DALLAway, objected to the acceptance of
such offer, on the ground that “it was calculated to do persons of that
class more harm than good.” Mr. Punch has not, and never expressed,
the least doubt that such was MR. DALLAWAY's opinion, and it is upon
the sentiment that would deprive “that class” of amusements which
are thought to be salutary to HER MAJESTY's children, and, Mr.
Punch's children, and the children of rate-payers, that Mr. Punch
makes, and, D.W., intends to make, incessant war. Thiſ ly, MR. DAL-
LAway states, that the offer having been courteously refused, “here
the matter would and ought to have rested, but MR. CHUTE and some
of the pot-house Nº. took up the subject very º and
have been stirring up Earth and Hell in throwing abuse on the unfor-
tunate Guardians.” That MR. DALLAway's character is unblemished,
Mr. Punch is perfectly ready to believe upon the ipse dirit of a gentle-
man of whom Mr. P. never heard in his life until he read of MR.
DALLAway's ridiculous conduct in the Pantomime and Pauper case;
but MR. DALLAway’s language, as above given, rather befits some
savage porter, of the class posted at the gate of certain London work-
house doors to bully away the poor, than the calm, just, but kindly
Guardian, who, from within, directs, rational relief. e must leave
the epithetical D. to settle with the journals what is to be understood
by pot-house Newspapers; but if the term imply that the humbler class,
during the hours of refreshment, seek instruction from such publi-
cations, Mr. Punch is º to state that His journal, studied at
Windsor. Castle, is also bethumbed in the pot-house. The other
figure of speech indicates an amount of topographical theolo
creditable to the supporter of the REVEREND, MR. NEwNHAM, the
anti-pantomime clergyman of Bath; but the metaphor is slightly con-
fused, and all that Mr. Punch can make out of it is, that MR. DALLA-
WAY is in a vulgar passion and uses coarse language.
MR. DALLAway, next enters into details as to the comforts"of the
Bath Union, and his statements are, so gratifying that their entire
irrelevance may be overlooked. He then draws a contrast between the
º Bath pauper and the º rate-payer, in numerous cases
a 10dging-nouse .#. who has but a few months for extortionate
charges, and duri e rest of "... lives upon his plunder and his
basement floor. e contrast is afflicting, but fails to establish, irre-
fragably, that the poor little children ought to have been prevented
from seeing Jack and the Beanstalk. Feeling this, MR, DALLAway,
on his sixth page, finishes off Mr. Punch with some logic. His objection
was, that the taking the children to the theatre would have been “the
placing them in an unnatural position,” (does MR. D. think that the
spectators stand on their hands, like the clown?) “raising their tastes
and ideas to a false standard” (poor, brats-up to the top of the
Beanstalk at least), “and perhaps implanting a propensity for sight-
seeing which they might rob their employers to gratify.”
This last is a home-thrust, and must be applauded by every Bath
lodging-house keeper, as she looks out the “other” key to her lodger's
tea-caddy. Åfarsighted friend is MR. DALLAway—a real Guardian
of the Poor. From what may not those 300 children, have been saved
by that act which dashed their merriment, and blighted their hopes?
º Beanstalk might, who knows? have º turned to Hemp;
Jack might have prefi red another inevitable Jack, fatally known a
Newgate; every trap that opened might have hinted at the drop, and
Harlequin's black cap have symbolised that of the judge who ten years
hence shall go the Western Circuit. MR. DALLAWAY has floored us,
and needed not instantly proceed to weaken his case by a reference to
“late hours” which has really little to do with a morning performance,
or by the discomfiting sneer which, as an arrière pensée he has written
on his envelope, “Represent the jnion children going in state to the
theatre, and the rate-payers sweeping the streets for them.” No, MR.
DALLAway, and do not you be petulant, even on the strength of º:
five years of a good Bath character. Your logic has prostrated Mr.
Punch, and that gentleman has barely strength to hint, in getting away
from so ... an antagonist, that Mr. P. ventured to say
against MR. D. was to reprint his own declaration that,he had seen
the Serious Family. He hardly see one in Bath when this epistolary
feat of his is the subject of family discussion.

| THE EXPECTED COMET,
(To DR. CUMMING.)
AIR-" Draw the Sword, Scotland.”
HEY! a Comet’s coming, CUMMING, CUMMING,
Ho! a Comet’s coming, expected very soon;
Unless folks are humming, humming, humming
Prognostication
Spreads consternation,
And with prostration,
Qld women swoon,
Thinking of the Comet, coming, CUMMING
Because the Comet coming, CUMMING, CUMMING,
Because the Comet coming, astrologers declare.—
sº. humming, ºf humming, .
| Silly people humming, -will low us intº alr,
*... this planet:
Goodness!—how can it,
If we but scan it,
The spheres so untune,
By the Comet coming, CUMMING, CUMMING,
By the Comet coming and due this blessed June 2
We know better, CUMMING, don’t we, CUMMING 2
We are sure that any astrologer’s a loon,
Or else a knave and humbug, humming, humming,
Who says the world is coming to its end so very soon,
Three years, if not more,
Lease it has got more,
May be a lot more,
Along with the moon,
Though a Comet’s coming, CUMMING, CUMMING,
Though a Comet's coming—possibly in June.
If the Comet’s coming, CUMMING,CUMMING,
If the Comet's coming, ice will be a boon,
When the flies are humming, humming, humming,
When the flies are humming on a sultry afternoon.
Hotter weather may prevail,
If it switch us with its tail,
How very like a whale,
Stung by a harpoon!
Let us hope the Comet, CUMMING, CUMMING,
Won't come it quite so very strong as that in June.
HABIT OF
The Comet will be here on the #. d. of June.
The Ömet that is due on the Thirteenth day of June:
THE NEW BEER BILL.
WHo would expect to find a coffee-mill or a tea-pot in a beer-barrel?
Nevertheless, here is a new “Sale of Beer Bill” introduced into
Parliament, a Bill, in fact, not so much dealing with the sale of beer,
as with the sale of tea and coffee. The thing is a publican's measure.
We hear the voice of BoniPACE speaking from the bung-hole. Coffee-
shops are to be especially subjected to the official eye of the police
nd the evil eye of the informer, for the larger licence of the Bunch_o
rapes and the Horse and Anchor. For instance, every keeper of a
coffee-shop is to be licensed at petty sessions by two justices of the
ace' y? As well should MRs. PARTINGTON, be licensed ere she
rmitted to fill her tea-kettle. Next: the price of the licence is
to be £2. Why not £5? If cost is to convey a sense of importance,
why not the larger instead of the lesser sum ? But will the cost of the
licence, whatever, it may be, fall upon the coffee-house keeper ?
Certainly not. It must be defrayed by his customers; by that
abandoned class of society that is found throughout the Metropolis
by hundreds with their elbows on coffee-house tables—coffee, and haply
the further dissipation of a muffin beside them—and spread before
their meditative eyes the pages of Punch, or some, such revo-
lutionary print, whose sole purpose it is to turn the throne into a
three-legged stool, and the monarchy into a republic. -
Again, these pestiferous coffee-shops, under the new Bill, are to be
closed at nine o'clock at night; that conspiracies may no longer be
hatched over the thin-veiled pretence of bohea and mocha. What
then? If the “Talfourd coffee-house,” in Farringdon Street be shut at
nine—and the shade of the gracious judge must be pleased and mollified
that under his name flourishes the tea-shrub and the coffee-plant—if
“Talfourd” be closed at nine, is not the neighbouring Red Lion open
until, twelve? Away, then, with thin libations, and welcome the
frothing “heavy l’” Šhove aside the effeminacy of cups and saucers,
and give us the manly pewter!
We trust that this new “Sale of Beer Bill,” which is, in fact, a
“Bill to discourage. Coffee-shops,”, will be . watched. Poli:
ticians owe it to their own poetic character to guard the interests of
the Mocha's sober juice:—
“Coffee that makes the politician wise,
To see thro' all things with his half-shut eyes.”
Coffee must not be put upon by the beer-cask; and the Bill before
us is evidently a Publican's Bill; a Bill, in fact, made and provided for
those who are given to their cups, but rarely to their saucers.

PUNCH*S COMPLETE TRADESMAN.
No. II.
MR. GRIG, of the Italian Warehouse, is at breakfast with MRs. GRIG,
several little GRIGs, and the Shopman.
MRs. GRIG. "Don't gobble up
your breakfast as if the house
was on fire, MR. GRIg. Re-
member that it is Sunday

thing to do except to take

all round.
Mrs. Grig. Don't be cross
with them, MR. GRIG. If
you'd talk to them, instead
of burying your head in that
newspaper, they’d be quiet.
Will you have an anchovy?
Mr. Grig. No, thank you,
I should think not.
Mrs. Grig. Don’t be fright-
ened. These are not out of
the shop.
Mr. Grig. Are they what your brother brought home? Then hand
'em over. JACK, where do anchovies come from ?
Jack...Off the third shelf, right hand side, next the pickles.
Mr. Grig (bores his ears). Take that, Sir, for your impertinence, and
I’ve a good mind to say you shan’t go out to-day.
Mary º e knows quite well, Pa; it’s only his fun.
Mr. Grig. When I ask a question, I expect a respectful answer, and
I’ll have it. Now, Sir, if you do know, say.
Jack (sullenly). Čommon on the coasts of Portugal Spain and France
has also been taken on our own is found all along the Mediterranean
the Romans made a liquor called garum from it it is fished for at night
and imported in barrels preserved in brine made with rock salt.
Mrs. Grig. I can’t think how you can be so harsh with the child.
He learns very well.
Mr. Grig. Let him learn his duty to me.
Shopman (in order to make peace). He'll remember another time, Sir.
His heart’s in the rights.
Mrs. Grig (pleased). Some more tea, CoBBoIDP Yours is cold.
n. Thank you, M'm, I don’t know but what I will. MR.
GRIg don't tell us, Mºm, that there’s a little more to do to the
anchovies before the public gets them.
Mr. Grig (glad of an ercuse to be good-natured again). First catch
: anchovy, CoBBOLD, or rather first don't catch it. Catch your
Sprat.
Mrs. Grig. Sprats are very good things.
Mr. º No doubt of it, my dear. And if you put them into the
brine in which the real anchovy has been, and especially if you colour
that brine rather highly with bole Armenian—

Mr. Grig. Well, I dare say that’s good in some diseases too, if we
º it. That’s the way to make anchovies.

ary. But what’s the red mixture for, Paſſ
. Mr. º Why, my dear; if a customer asked me, I should say, to
improve the appearance of the fish, because customers ought not to be
too curious. e reason I should give to you is, that the colour hides
the dirty state of the brine. ..
Mary, I wonder people like to buy such things. Why, in that
sample Ma'opened yesterday, you might take the red earth and mess
out of the bottles by tea-spoonfuls.
Mrs. (laughing). Sºmebody’s doing it now, I dare say, for we
sold a good many bottles last night.
Shopman. Eleving, M'm.
Mr. Grig. If people don't complain, it’s no business of ours. I
know this,...that out of twenty-eight samples of trade anchovies that
were examined by a Fº I know, not one-third were the real thing.
Mrs. *#. ere are capital, these of ToM's. Look at the
fish, now. How anybody in their senses cantake aspratforamanchovyi
Mr. Grig. You would, only you are told first. The º: and
mutilation in bottling, and the red stuff, does the trick for almost every-
body. By the way did the potted things come in P
Mrs. Grig. No. 'What did you go buying more for? We’ve a
precious stock in hand.
Mr. Grig. Because these are more advantageous. There's a good
deal more flour put into them.
Mrs. Grig. Plaster of Paris is i. as good.
Mr. Grig. Yes, or chalk, like those in the shop. But I had a chance
to buy well. I’ve bought some anchovy paste too, and mind you speak
of it, CoBBoLD, as first rate. A man I know has made it. He bought
a lot of sprats and cheap fish, and bruised them up, well seasoned, and
coloured with Venetian red, and I'm blow'd if you'd know 'em from
the right ºf -
Mrs. Grig. I wonder if that Venetian red is poison. The bloater
paste made JIM ill one day. - - - - -
Mr. Grig, Hang it, JEMIMA, you never let the child have it, did you?
Hang it all! y, it’s most deleterious. I wouldn't give it to any-
body on any account.
Mary. But you sell it, Papa. -
Mr. Grig. That is not giving it, MoLLY. And that's in the way of
trade. You don't understand the difference. There are the bells, by
George! Be off to church with you, and I’ll have my cigar, in the
mean time.
The Females. But you take us out in the afternoon?
Mr. Grig. Well, we’ll see. If you young uns give me the text and
a § account of the sermon, perhaps I will. (To Shopman, slyly).
I think the profit on the new anchovies will pay for a chaise to
Hampton Court.
ANALYSIS OF OUR COLLECTIVE WISDOM.

misplaced aspirations . - - - - - - - -
Members, who wear white hats . - - - - - - - 7

schemes and support their own Companies - - - -
Red Tapists, and Members holding office, or connected with persons
holding office under Government . - - - - - -
Sanguine, speculative, or seedy Members, with the hope or
promise of holding office under Government . - - ... 79
Army and Navy Members, who have an interest in backing up, or
108

Vacant seats, and by no means the worst filled . : - - -
High-minded patriots—(say, so as to be on the safe side) . - 3
Total Tº. seats.
We only hope that the next general election will have the effect of
presenting the nation with a more favourable analysis. If not, we
shall move that an Analytical Commission, under the presidency of
DR. HassaLL, be formed to inquire into the corruptions and adulte-
rations of Government.
EPISCOPAL.
LAST week it was maliciously reported in the ...y of the House of
Lords, that the Bishop of Oxford—much, moved by the powerful
speech of LoRD DERBY on the Chinese broil—had offered himself as
ready to proceed to Canton as a bearer of a i of truce; and further,
to present a letter of invitation from his Lordship tº, Goveryos YEH
to *. a few weeks with the PREMIER expectant at St. James's .
and Knowsley. We may, however, state that on the part of 9ne
reverend member of the Bench such an offer has really been made, but
the name of the enthusiast has not yet transpired. Indeed, perhaps it
may never be disclosed.
Very Ironical
LoRD ELLENBoRough thought he applied a terrible cautery to SIR
J. Bºwl ING, when * his knighthood, the noble lord .#
called him “Doctor.” Very stinging this. But his lordship shoul
take heed. Is he not open to reprisals? hat, for instance, if
Gover Noh BowRING, in his future despatches, studiously forgetful. of
the fullness of his Lordship's dignity, should determine upon calling
him nothing but “ELLEN ?”

A CHALLENGE.
WE wager six haunches of Southdown mutton against twelve buf.
falo's humps, that an English postman will go through mºre rapping
on St. Valentine's Day than an American spiritualist on, all the other
days of the year put together; and moreover, that a medium (either in
the shape of a cook, or a housemaid, or a young, or elderly, lady)
shall answer in every case, and answer, too, at the very first rap,
without keeping the spirit-rapper waiting longer than is just necessary
for him to ...i his letters. - - - -
challenge, we shall infer that there is no longer any spirit left in them.
GESLER'S HAT.
ONCE upon a time, the spirit of Switzerland, working in the umbon-
neted WILLIAM TELL, looked defiance at GEsler's Hat, stuck upon a
pole, to test the manhood of a free people. And now, Switzerland
sends her children—or permits them to depart and take livery in the
odious service—to mount d about the pole, and to $ompel men,
women, and children, to do servile obedience to the Popº's triple
crown, to the double diadem of the Two Sicilies. Pity is it, that
Switzerland, who knows so well how to be free at home, has become a
ye-word and a proverb as the nursing mother of a family of flunkeys,
with plush in their souls, with their very minds in livery, devoted to
take wages from the blood-dropping hands of a FERDINAND, to eat the
dirty bread of a Pius THE NINTH.
Oh, Helvetian lion, and must it be ever thus?. It was bad enough
when you were turned into a poodle for the Kings of France; and
when, watching faithfully, and biting bravely, you were knocked on
the head by republican clubs one very noisy day in Paris. Poodle as
you were—the leonine majesty clipped closely as any caniche on the
Pont Neuf-you died game; and ThorwardsEN has carved you,
restoring the leonine form, in everlasting rock, great lion of Lucerne.
The mighty Dane has cast the sentiment of fidelity about your dying
moments; the arrow has sped to the vital place; the thick blood oozes
round the shaft; and the leonine paws, the claws tangled in its folds,
grasp with the grip of death the lilie º of France. Down went
the Bastille! And Helvetia's lion—in that bloody time of Paris—what
was it more than a butchered calf?. Indeed, of not so much service:
able account as so much dead vealin which were the probabilities of
many africandeau/
And now, transformed to a shepherd's dog, the Helvetian Lion is
the hired property of the Pastor of the Seven Hills; and worries the
sheep—for the Shepherd thinks it good that his flock should know the
teeth, of the dog—and, all for their health’s sake, even bites the
little lambs. - -
In Naples, the lion of Helvetia, turned to a blood-hound, has lost its
f our Yankee spiritualists decline, this Le
roar, and hunts ... coming death. Ill-favoured, sinister beast !
It carries a golden collar charged with the arms of the Two Sicilies;
and licks its jaws red with man-hunting. ...And was this beast bred in
the mountain-home of Switzerland? Was this badged brute of
slaughter a thing of the land of TELLP A thing to be patted by the
hand of BoMBA, and fed upon his scraps?
Will Switzerland remain silent? ill she not, with the voice of an
indignant mother, call back her children, or denounce them as hirelings
for blood—as turnkeys, and torturers for daily, wages? Will ".
consent to share in the shame of tyranny by licensing its instruments?
tus see to what iniquities Switzerland, in the person of her soldiers
—her despot's guards upon blood-wages—lends herself and ministers.
How fare the Neapolitan state prisoners in the castle of Monte Sarchio
where BoMBA keeps his victims, as the #. PolyPHEMUs kept his
supplies, to be devoured in due season P. How goes it with PoERIo?
ith the undaunted man, stubborn to the death in his º
of truth and right? ell, PoERIo—with manacled º, lost
one eye; total, blindness is fast coming on, speeded racking
rheumatism, and a cough so deep, so wearing, that, it might, almost
move the bowels of the king gaoler, Feapnºsphimself. Nevertheless,
Switzerland, continues at once, the guard and turnkey of well-nigh
extinguished PoERIo. Switzerland with her ºf: lance of freedom
can accustom her eyes to the charnel darkness of a dungeon; and still
have vision sufficient to see that her wages are no counterfeit, but of
the right metal. Switzerland, with her ear, attuned to foaming cata-
racts and bounding streams, can critically listen, when, she rings her
º wages, to know if the coin be of the right and true musical
vibration.
Besides PoERIothere is Schiavoni, also blind of one eye; and threat-
ened with blindness total as the stone-blindness of FrºdinanD’s heart.
One STENo-by last accounts sent to the minister of merry England—
has no stomach for º fare, all food being rejected. VINCENzo DoNQ
has been on the rack of rheumatism for five months; Nisco is tortured
by incessant pains of the stomach; and ALPhonso Zeu L1, aged twenty:
four, died of consumption; and died in chains. In chains, Switzerland!
But still he rebelliously died; there being no possible gag or *:::::
iron to keep in the rebel soul that, haply, flew accusingly to God,
accusingly of the monster who holds bloody carnival with his own
thoughts at Caserta. Near ZEUL1, lay PIRRoti, a judge in chains, and
almost motionless as a corpse. Justice in manacles; and Switzerland,
in the persons of her children, keeping hireling guard of the victim of
the blasphemer!
We will not pause to look into the Roman dungeons, with locks
turned by the keys of St. PETER-Prus. We will not count the harried,
bitten, half-flayed º. ruddled property, for is, not the cross
upon their backs?—of the pastoral Pope. #. that he has hireling
ºgs from the mountains and valleys of Switzerland, the yaunted home
of freedom, albeit the breeding-places of the liveried lackeys, and the
ready-money slaves of tyrants. -
Can Switzerland, in the face of this reproach—a reproach, eating
zer-like into her fair name—can Switzerland pause ere she calls
back her Swiss from Rome, her Swiss from Naples; and being called,
and coming not—ere she fails to cast them off and for ever to denounce
them—no children of hers but bought and sold soulless carcases, the
working-tools of tyrants?
If Switzerland will not do this, let us hear no more of the Helvetian
Lion. For with Swiss i. at Rome, with Swiss guards at Naples,
truly for the Helvetian Lion we must have the Helvetian Hyena.
The Advantage of Earnestness.
It would perhaps be going too far to say, that nothing could have
exceeded the eloquence of i. EARL of DERRY's appeal to the House
of Lords in general, and the Bishops in particular, on behalf of the
aceable, much-enduring, honest, straightforward, mild, gentle, for-
earing, barbarously outraged Chinese. The noble Earſ would have
made a much more spirited and energetic speech, if the rupture at
Canton had occurred under an Administration of his own, and if,
therefore, he had been obliged to speak on the other side of the
question.
Mr. Gladstone's Game.
MR. GLADstone has been playing a deep #. of chess. Under
cover of attacking the PREMIER's §: or Tower of Strength, the
CHANCELLoR or THE ExchequER, the honourable Puseyite, is, sup-

debate. A handsome reward will be given to whosoever shall restoro the article in
question, as it is more than probable that its late owner will, in the course of the
next few months, have the most pressing need of it.

WHY LADIES CANNOT SIT IN PARLIAMENT.
ONE of the pet grievances of those strong-minded women, who lose
their time and temper in talking of their “Rights,” is that by the law
as it at present stands, ladies are not suffered to have seats in Par-
liament. Now, without being ungallant enough to show the absurdit
of making a complaint of what they ought to feel rejoiced at, we wi
be content with simply proving that to comply with their demand
would be at present quite impossible. Granting that a Female Par-
liament, or House of Ladies, were to meet, we need scarcely dwell
º the difficulty that there would be in stopping them from speaking
all together: nor how impossible the Speakeress would find it to pro-
ceed with public business, without º; some such order as that
egs at once. But it seems
to us that were the memberesses properly returned, it would still be
quite preposterous for more than one in twenty of them to expect to
have a seat, for the simple reason that, unless their numbers were
extremely limited, it would be impossible to find a room to hold them.
To his friends at Arbroath has |In their present state of Crinoline, ladies on an average require at least
a dozen yards of sitting room a-piece; and were they to return as
many members as the gentlemen, it has been estimated that the space
which would be covered by above six hundred petticoats would con-
siderably exceed a couple of acres. Such a room as this of course
would have to be constructed specially; and until the present Houses
are completed, it would be preposterous to vote supplies for new ones.
It is probable, however, that by the time of the completion of the now
erecting structures—that is to say, by the end of the next century—the
fashion will have changed, and the present blown-up petticoats have
become exploded; in which case the erection of a Female House of
Parliament would then be no more necessary than, we are so ungallant
to think, it would be at this present.
A HOUSE OF MENTAL CORRECTION.
THERE is much need of an institution intermediate between a House
of Correction and a Lunatic Asylum, to which magistrates might have
the power of committing a certain kind of persons, evidently half-
knaves, half-fools, who are continually presenting themselves at the
#. and accusing themselves of having committed murder.
ere is a case in point, of recent occurrence:—
“ConFEssion of A MURDER AT HALIFAx.—On Saturday afternoon, a middle-
aged man, named James Smith, by trade a blacksmith, made the following con-
fession of murder at the Halifax Borough Police Office:—I have come to give my-
self up. Another man and myself killed the Governor of Carlisle Gaol about four-
teen years ago by throwing him over the banisters. I have been uneasy in my
conscience many years, and now I am determined to get rid of it.”
Of course this story, when investigated, turned out to be all fudge.
The fellow was discharged, having been ordered to pay the expenses
which he had occasioned. But, in addition to having been lightened
of a certain sum of money, it might have been advisable that he should
have been subjected to a certain amount of bodily depletion. Here
is a partially crazy, partially vicious creature * about with
ideas of murder in his head, and surely it would be desirable that
a head with such notions seething in it should be shaved. A
few doses of blue pill, followed by the customary draught, might
be further tº in such a case, in conjunction with the regimen
commonly known as low diet. This antiphlogistic treatment would be
calculated to reduce that inflammation of the love of notoriety which is
the exciting cause of these sham confessions; and might perhaps pre-
vent that disorder from breaking out in some form seriously mis-
chievous. Such cases are, to use a Baconian phrase, frontier instances
between lunacy and crime; and to meet the latter, element in their
character, a brief course of good hard labour might also be imposed on
the patient-rogue: the moral hybrid or mule, combining some of the
vagabond with a very large proportion of the jackass.
BROTHER JONATHAN.—The next time you send us over any
canvas-back ducks, please have the kindness to send an American cook over
with them, because our stupid English cooks are not as yet sufficiently advanced
in culinary civilisation as to know how to dress them, and the consequence is that
those far-famed delicacies are invariably spoilt, much to the loss of the appetites and
tempers of the guests assembled.—PUNCH.

COMPLETION OF THE NELSON COLUMN.
(A Paragraph extracted by Clairvoyance from the Times, March 2, 1901.)
QUR readers will be gratified to learn that the work of completing this monument
will shortly be resumed, and indeed we think we may with confidence predict that
within another year or so we may expect to find such progress made as º induce
a hope that we shall live to see it actually finished. Those who are old enough
perhaps may recollect that the erection of the Column was entrusted to the Govern-
ment in 1844, when the work was commenced in the most energetic manner; two
men and a boy being at once employed upon it. This activity, however, proved
so exhaustive of the funds which had been voted, that within a very few months
there was a stoppage of the works; and the question being put to Government in
1857, it was stated that “it was not, thought desirable” just then to grant the
needful. The matter then rested till the spring of 1889, when in consequence of
their resuscitation of the Income-Tax it was discovered that the Government had
in hand sufficient money to resume the works, and an order was thereupon given
for the purpose: but as this had to pass through the formalities of seve
departments, we considered at the time that there was little chance that we should
find it acted on within the current century. It will be owned that our prediction
has been fully verified, and if the Column be completed within ten years' hence,
the country will have every reason to be satisfied. ----
It may perhaps be urged by captious ºpºlº. that had the building
been entrusted to any other hands than those of the Government, it would probably
have been finished in less time than half a century. To say nothing, however, of
the great saving to the nation in the interest of the money which will now be spent
upon the works (it being indeed calculated by an eminent economist, that
the whole amount been advanced in 1844, the &iº. would by this time have cost
the country nearly double), the Government have ample precedent for this dela
in the course which has been taken in cases not dissimilar. So long a time elapse
before the Peninsula medal was awarded, that by the time they received their
decoration, the veteran º only numbered a few dozen; and although a
century has almost passed since NELSoN died for us, our non-completion of his
Column has at any rate served to keep him in our remembrance. And it affords,
we think, a striking f of how much confidence is felt in the solvency of England,
that in paying these her debts of honour, she is still allowed so long a credit.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
March 2nd, Monday. “Pheasants crow,” º the almanackcomposer
to Household Words, speaking of this week. Well they may, this
March, if they read the papers, and are weak enough to, imagine that
if a senator is obliged to waste April and May, he will sit through
September—and October—to makeup. But we fear the pheasants are
crowing under an erroneous impression of the patriotism of the British
sportsman, and that when the autumnal crocuses are in blossom, the
poor birds will find out their mistake. -
For—to pack the matter as with a hydraulic press of extra condensing
power-Parliament has been and done it. The House of Commons
which assembled, on the 4th of November, 1852, has but a few days to
live. It has deliberately destroyed itself, and CoroneR PUNCH, sitting
upon the moribund body, appeals, by anticipation, to the country for
the verdict once returned by a rustic inquest, “Justifiable suicide and
recommends to mercy, and we wants our money.” . -
The tale is brief and instructive on the second night of the Chinese
debate, the ATToRNEy-GENERAL finished, the discussion for that week.
He politely intimated that he should not bother himself with answering
arguments used in the House in which he spoke, but should confute
the Opposition in the Lords, and then he was pretty sure to have
smashed anything that had been advanced by the &º. And SIR
Richałºp, haughtily measuring himself against foemen worthy of his
§ certainly make out a complete legal case for the Government.
Qn the Monday, the battle was renewed, Dr. PHILLIMORE abused the
Bishops for supporting the Ministry, SIR,GeoRGE GREY called his
conduct indecent. MR. Robertson (formerly a Canton merchant), told
stories illustrating the cruelty and treachery of the Chinese. SIR John
PARINGTON felt so ashamed of the bombardment that he could not be
silent, but said nothing of which he should not have felt more ashamed,
MR. Collier was for going on as we had begun and SIR FREDERIc
Tºrsiger told a marveilous tale of a "voice” which after Nelson's
bombardment of. º “came out of the ruins, and inquired of
Britain whether it was really She who had been doing that work.” He
did not mention whether the “voice” spoke Danish or English, or
LoRD NElson's reply. SIR. W. WILLIAMs of Kars conceived that the
Chinese insult to the British flag had been premeditated, and SIDNEY
HERBERT, attacking the Government, protested against acting with
º spirit. Sergeant SHEE thought the insulted vessel was an
nglish one, and supported Government. Then came
Tuesday. A memorable date. The adjourned debate was opened by
MR. Robert PAIMER, who spoke as allerbyite, as did a Shropshire Con-
servative colonel, HERBERT, to whom a Cornish Conservative captain
KENDALI, replied that he preferred PALMERston and Evangelica
Bishops to Lord DERby and High Church. After some peacemongering
from MR. MILNER GIBson, a squib or two from MR. BERNAL Osborºne,
a grumble from MR. HENLEY, some mock pathos from the other
PhILLIMoRE (member for Cornelius NEros and other º
authors who supply quotations), MR. CHAMBERs pitched point blan
into MR. Cobden for his peace nonsense, and then MR. Roebuck and
MR. GLApstone both attacked Government. Roebuck particularly
grieved that our conduct was unchristian, and GLAnstone that it was
not straightforward. The Bottleholdeſt at last rose to reply, and in
a very plain-spoken speech exposed the cant about the Chinese,
expressed his perfect º that it only meant that, the
Government bench was wanted by his opponents, and cautioned the
House not to sacrifice the honour of their country and the safety of
Englishmen abroad to the greed of a hungry faction. MR. DisBAELI,
É. the truth of all this, could only answer the charge of coalition
by a vulgar tu quºque, and MR. Cobden finished, the debate with, a
flippant answer. †. division took place about half-past two in the
morning, and the numbers were:-

have been expelled, but for the political crisis then impending.

PUNCH, OR THE L
ONDON CHARIVARI [MARCH 14, 1857.
Thursday. LoRD PALMERstoN came down to the House, and with
the blandest courtesy apprised the Chinese members, that in conse-
quence of their vote on *. he might have turned out, if he liked,
only he didn't like, and should turn them out instead. ſt would be,
he gently hinted, ridiculous to ask the factions to make a Govern-
ment, because they could not do it; and therefore he had arranged
with the QUEEN that as soon as some necessary votes for money and
soldiers had been taken, Parliament should be Dissolved.
Mr. Punch's cheering might have been heard at Canton itself, and
will be when the next mail arrives there.)
MR. DiskAELI, with a face about twice as long as was consistent
with beauty, intimated that he would not prevent the dissolution, but
MR. Cobden was not so gracious, and demanded that somebody should
chivy the Indian mail, now on its way, and give the postman a note to
ADMIRAL SEYMoUR, desiring him to make peace and apologies., SIR
CHARLEs WooD laughed good-naturedly, as he always does, and said
that long before the debate, he had sent off plenty of frigates and gun-
boats to China, that they had arrived by this time, and that Goyern-
ment would take care to do what was desirable. This put the Chinese
members in a dreadful rage, but though they got some more “expla-
nations,” they got no better terms, and LoRD JoHN RUssell was
uite affecting about , the “penal dissolution” inflicted on the
ouse, for having voted according to its conscience. At this
word, in such context, PAM fairly exploded, but when he had
cruel poke at the Chinese, who took to flight, and the House was
actually counted out at 8 o'clock. - -
This seems to afford a good opportunity for mentioning that in the
Lords, on Monday, LoRD, DERby complained that the Press, (usually
understood to be MR. DISRAELI's, organ) had given an inaccurate
report of a meeting of his Lordship's supporters... The journal
replies that its report was substantially correct. The Earl was repre-
sented as having blown up certain dissentient Conservatives with
some vigour. Next night LoRD CRAN worth’s Divorce Bill came on,
and was read a second time; but the dissolution will enable C. C. to
make a more decent affair of it. LoRD DERBy abused the Bishops for
not attending on such a question—twenty-three, he said, could come to
the Chinese debate, and only two to that on Divorce. On Thursday
LoRD GRANVILLE announced the dissolution, complimenting the Lords
upon their having shown more sense than the Commons on the Canton
affair; and on Friday LoRD SHAFTESBURY gave notice of his intention to
administer avery mild opiate to their lordships on the following Monday.

of extravagance, the

This we learn less
from our own personal
observation (for we

to look too closely for
fear of getting some of

eyes) than from a writer on the fashions in a fashionable contemporary—by JENKINs, what
all #. must be demanded for the post!—who enlightens and astonishes our weak mind

“The custom of sprinkling gold dust on the hair is becoming, we perceive, more and more in vogue. It
Produces generally the most captivating of effects, and especially enhances the charms of the coiffur where
the hair is light brown or of an auburn tint; to which it imparts that shining golden hue, which to the poetical
observer, appears as though a sunbeam had been broken into bits, and scattered among the tresses.”
This is very fine, really: and will probably produce quite a run upon the diggings... Never-
theless, we have some doubts of the value of gold dust as a hair powder, and confess that
we are tempted to inquire with vulgar people, Will it wash It seems to us, being purely
ractical ºbservers, that any “fair one with the golden locks” which nature has bestowed on
er, would soon take the shine out of artificial sunbeams, and make their wearers cry out with
vexation to their lady's-maids on getting home, “Here, bring me my gold-dust pan, and sweep
away my sunshine!”
But there is really no ºf for fashionable taste: and as we have even seen artificial
flowers worn, in preference to real ones, it would not at all surprise us to find that the false
Sunbeams still should keep in fashion, notwithstanding even our attempts to put them out.
We suspectindeed that there are many ladies who would be among the last to allow of any
silver being seen in their hair, and yet would be amºng the first to show a little gold in it.

of conscience that must delight MR. SpoonER.

COBDENISMS ON CHINA.
HE Chinese are the most humane
of all the peoples in the world.
All their punishments are of the
mildest nature possible. In cases
of theft, or any other offence short
of murder—a crime very seldom
indeed committed, the punishment
for the first offence is a gentle
reprimand. A second conviction
sul º the delinquent to a good
scolding, and a third renders him
liable to bodily chastisement, which
consists in a slight caning, ad-
ministered with a small bamboo
cane. Incorrigible offenders, how-
ever, are sometimes punished with
flagellation nearly as severe as
that inflicted at Eton or Harrow.
In addition, the malefactor is con-
fined for some hours, or has an
imposition set him in Confucius,
being kept in, and obliged to learn
and repeat a certain number of
lines of that author before he can
be let out. But eventhese punish-
ments are very rare in China, for
- the simplereason that the laws are
very rarely broken. Robbery, swindling, and depredations on º
in general, are nearly as uncommon as crimes of violence; which last are
scarcely ever heard of. The earliest lesson inculcated on the mind of
children is, exactly as in the Manchester school, the necessity of strict
veracity; and the truthfulness of the Chinese can perhaps only be
matched by that of their Parliamentary advocates. Hence the word
of a Chinaman is quite as good as his bond; and the sincerity
of the Chinese is as remarkable in their acts as in their words;
for they are most particular as to the jº of their weights and
measures, and the purity and freedom from adulteration of all their
articles of commerce; so that impurities in tea, as it leaves their
hands, are as seldom to be found as shoddy and devil's dust in certain
British manufactures. Fraudulent practices in trade are yisited
with the punishment of the collar, which is simply a stiff leather
stock that holds the head upright, and, being worn for some hours
serves to admonish the guilty party, % analogy, of the duty of
rectitude. The horror of the Chinese for bloodshed is such that most
of them faint at the sight of anybody's nose bleeding; hence, they
labour under a peculiar disadvantage in warfare, their soldiers being
disabled by beholding the effect of their own arms on the enemy.
This feeling, in connection with a singularly sensitive benevolence, is
. evinced in the method of their capital executions, of which
spectacles an instance occurs about once in a hundred years. The
science, too, whereof they were in possession long before Europe had
acquired any idea of chemistry, is humanely applied in mitigation of
death-punishment. The criminal is privately—to avoid brutalising
the populace by a revolting exhibition—suffocated with the fumes of
charcoal or carbonic acid, having been previously deprived of sensation
by means of chloroform.
GOG AND MAGOG TO PAM.
“DEAR Lord PALMERston,
“You are about to break º your establishment in West-
minster for a time; do, come into the City. Depend upon it, we
give you a hearty welcome here, and a triumphant return to your
old house at home. Don't use any delicacy towards little LoRD John
because, as he has so lately shown, he is above any such sort of
nonsense as regards yourself. , You fought his battle when he couldn't
fight it himself at Vienna; and now he joins CoBDEN and Dizzy, and
throws a tea-pot at your chivalrous head. Well, strange accidents do
º Who knows but, unawares, he may yet sit upon the pieces.
“But again we say, come to the City. Anyway, we will not again
have floºr joirs. To return him wºuld be to endorse his opposition
to the valiant Minister who took the forlorn hope of the war, and
muzzled the Bear. Come, dear PAM, to Guildhall. Magog and
myself will give you plumpers. Come, come! We say we will return
you for the City ; crown you with Chinese roses, and chair you in a
tea-chest. -
“Faithfully yours, dear LoRD PALMERston,
“GoG AND MAgog.
“P.S. We propose to give you, as a testimonial, a very handsome
tea-service, with, in commemoration of the number that voted against
you, no less than two hundred and sixty-three spoons.”
LINES TO THE COALITION.
LoRD DERBY, Irather would hold your position,
Than any one else's in your Coalition,
Because, as a Peer, you've a safe situation;
You've nothing to fear beyond mere execration.
Far worse are your Commons accomplices’ cases,
I shouldn't at all like to be in their places;
For out of those places, no more to be trusted,
They’re like to be turned by a nation disgusted.
Betrayers of old England's honour and glory,
Will they be º by any true Tory?
Regarded with Coppen and you in conjunction,
They’ll have to resign their political function.
The yeomen of Bucks will no longer stand Dizzy.
They’ll send him his brain with romances to busy;
Unless such poor hawbucks of Bucks are those yeomen,
That they’ll choose a member who backs Britain's foemen.
Willmerry Carlisle, do .." think, rest contented,
*. PEEL's dirty boy to be still represented P -
ore dirty than ever now, since his last traction
Through foullest of mud by the Manchester faction.
For GLADstone at Oxford there’s some chance of keeping;
Because, into office in case of his creeping,
Tractarian prospects he’ll render much brighter,
And give, if he can, D.R. Pusey a mitre.
With poorlord JoHN Russell twill go hard in London,
Where his reputation is thoroughly undone;
And if disappointment he meet in the City,
GREYs only, and ELLIoTTs, his downfall will pity.
And, Cobden, if you dare contest the West Riding,
Qh won't you just get, as the boys say, a hiding!
Unless that same Riding, whose saddle you sit in,
Indeed, is a province of Russia, not Britain.
Confederate crew, your appeal to the nation,
Your failures and blunders your recommendation,
Will teach you that England of honour so jealous,
Loves not coalitions composed of such fellows.
IMPORTANT –WE STOP THE PRESS.
As no doubt the subjoined Errata—which we hasten to copy from
the Morning Herald-very deeply affect the peace, of, many distin-
guished Hebrew families, we give the correction the benefit of our
circulation, not forgetting, by the way, our best wishes to the bride and
bridegroom of the House of Rothschild:—
“ERRATA.—In the notice of the marriage festivities at Gunnersbury, in our im-
pression of yesterday, in the description of the head-dress of the bridesmaids, it
should have been stated that it was 'lilies of the valley, instead of ºrange blossoms,”
that composed part of the wreath; and that it was light blue "velvet,” instead of
‘violet, by which the wreath was confined. It should have been Baron “Lionel,’
instead of “James," as the second supporter of the bridegroom on the occasion."
We have no doubt that the bridesmaids will forgive the anticipations
of the careless reporter, who ought to have known that bridesmaids
are always lilies, as brides are inevitably oranges. That the wreath
was confined of velvet, instead of violet must allay a great cause of
consternation in the fashionable world. As for BARON LIONEL, it is
said, that having read himself reported as “JEAMEs,” he took to his
bed, and fairly dreamt himself into plush. To leave, however, these
little mistakes, we cannot but acknowledge, with suitable awe, the
bridalglories of Gunnersbury. Had QUEEN SHEBA married Solomons
the pomp and magnificence could not have outblazoned the nuptials.o
Wednesday. For our part, we take it as a great mark of humility
on the part of the Rothschilds, that they condescend to lend money
to the EMPERoR of Austria, when it is plain enough, if they so
elected, they might buy his throne with no more ado than LAzARus, of
Brokers' Row, bids for a sofa or puts in for an easy chair. By the
way, the Herald has forgotten to correct among other errate the
rumour that Lord DERby was of the party. For LoRD DERBY, read
LoRD RUSSELL.

AN INVITATION.
By Mr. Punch's Poet Laureate—not to be confounded with the
author of “Come into the garden, Maud.”
CoME unto the country, PAM,
Now their triple shaft has hown—
Come unto the country, PAM;
You're the man, and you alone—
So honest men think at home and abroad,
And the Coalition's blown!
For a breeze in Yorkshire moves,
And the West Riding dander is º
Beginning to look for a Member she loves,
And on whom she can rely.
Beginning to look for a man that she loves,
o look for a man, and a cry.
Four nights have the Commons heard,
Like flute, violin, bassoon,
Cobden, Dizzy, and GLADSTONE, savagely gird
At BowRING, all in a tune, , ,
In the hope that John BULL's bile might be stirred,
For the Brother of Sun and Moon.
I said to the Tory “As things have gone,
I can't see you've the right to be gay,
If your mountebank leader be left alone,
etwixt two stools—as they say.
When half to the GLADston E account are gone,
And half on the CopDEN lay,
Built on the sand, and not on the stone,
Your hopes will crumble away.”
I said unto those, who upon the rows
Below the gangway pine–
“Oh, young ſº what sighs are those
For that which will never be thine?”
“But mine—but mine!”—so each may suppose-
Dizzy, CoBDEN, and GLADstone—“mine!”
But the country is scarcely prepared to take
A Manchester ministrie,
Nor is GLADstoNE likely his way to make
To the Bench of the Treasurie.
And Dizzy may quake outright for your sake,
Knowing the thing that’s to be
That counties and boroughs are all awake
To strengthen not him, but thee.
The Coalition its banner unfurls.
Come hither: the talking is donč.
Not by gloss of Dizzy and GLADstone's pearls
Of speech will the battle be won.
Come out, old rough-rider, defying purls,
And astonish them every one !
In the yellow leaf and sere,
Droop the passion-flowers of debate—
It is coming, the day of fear:
It is coming, the day of fate' .
The Counties cry, “It is near, it is near,”
The Boroughs growl “it is late,”
The City listens--"I hear, I hear,” . .
And the West Riding whispers “I wait.”
It is coming, and many a seat
Is aquake with anxious dread!
Old PAM they intended to beat,
But he’ll lick them instead.
Old PAM they intended to beat;

PHYSIC AND
ITS FACES.
Mong the novelties
of literature we see
a pamphlet adver-
tised called Physic
and its Phases. Now
although it may ap-
pear presumption to
pronounce a judg-
mentona book from
only looking at the
title, still we ques-
tion much in this
case if the author,
had he taken our
advice beforehand,
would not have en-
tirely changed hi
mode of treatment
E of the subject. In-
ls stead of Physic and
HE its Phases, we should
* have, suggested for
a title page Physic
and its Faces, and
should have recommended him to comment on the facial distortions with
which the swallowing of medicine is usually attended. Only conceive
what a field of observation would have thus been opened to him!, an
how, after dealing with the subject generally, he might have well de-
scended to particularities, and have º descanted on the different
sorts of faces which the different sorts of physic are accustomed to
induce. For our own part we are conscious that our countenance is
never so distorted from its natural “line of beauty,” as when we are
engaged in drinking a black draught; and for that reason we have long
thought it a duty to *..." that actin solitude, for fear our hideousness
º terrify our wife and family. Indeed, as we are rather a belieyer
in Layaterism, and have some degree of faith in physiognomy, wet
that doctors might learn something from the faces which their patients
make when swa º their medicines, and, which might not impro-
bably be proved to indicate in some degree their nervous temperament.
Some judgment might º: be formed of the comparative effect
of drugs upon a given person, from inspection of his looks when in the
act of tasting them : and tables of most interesting statistics might be
furnished of the various wry faces which have been ascertained to be
}. by physic. Indeed, by the assistance of photography, these
acial distortions might be accurately copied, and appended in the way
of plates or illustrations to the work: and a complete series of patients’
pictures might be thus arranged, comprising all the ill looks that are
usual, from those which are produced by bolting a blue pill, to those
which may be consequent on gulping down “two tablespoonsful” of
a rhubarb draught, or still more nauseous assafoetida cum aloes
mixture.
As we always are in readiness to make any sacrifice in the cause of
science, we should not object ourselyes to have our own, ill features
pººl. as we are convinced that they would never be identified
y those accustomed only to Qur natural good looks. And perhaps the
contemplation of our frightful faces might lead us by degrees to take
physic without º them, which we at present find to be a physical
impossibility: for, childish though it seem to stronger minded people,
we yet confess we can no more avoid it than, with all our philosophy,
We can º º: Qut, whenever we are forced to screw our
courage to the kicking place, and have that “aching void” a hollow
tooth extracted.
The Chinese Giant.
. It is now quite clear that the author of Jack the Giant Killer was
either the }. 'MERLIN, or some other one of the ancient British
brotherhood of seers. The couplet put into the mouth of BLUNDERBORE:
“Fee—fa—fi-Foh—Fum !
I smell the blood of an Englishman . "
has evidently a prophetic reference to CoMMIssion ER YEH as a mur-
derous miscreant, a disciple of Foh, and an adept in the mystery of Fum.
A PROPHECY.
Is LORD PALMERSTON wrong in supporting his subordinates at
Canton?
CoBDEN says “YEH.” The Country will say “Nay.”
“TURNER's Collection.”—The division on the China debate might
be characterised as “Turner's collection,” considering the number of
gentlemen who turned their coats on that occasion.
THE CHINESE DONKEY.
ABBé HUC, in the excellent work that chronicles his experiences in
China, introduces a donkey that, in the present state of political affairs,
affords an instructive, moral. Oddly as it may sound, the Coalition
. the donkey, philosophically considered, have a relation with each
Other.
Well, the adventurous Abbé narrates that, journeying with other
missionary companions in the interior of China, there was—it w
happen in the very best society—a monstrous donkey in the company.
Notwithstanding the downward influence of philosophers before the
time of MR. Cobden's favourite ARISTOTLE, China, it seems, is rather
famous for its monstrous donkeys. -
.The travellers sought what shelter they could every night, and every
night addressed themselves to sleep. But sleep was not permitted to
descend upon them. The donkey would not allow the travellers the
luxury of half-an-hour's repose. All the live-long night, did this mon-
ster bray and bray, revealing to his hearers—as will happen with
his certain speakers Twhat a remarkably great ass he was. The poor Abbé
and his brother missionaries never closed their eye-lids. Still the
jackass awoke the echoes and still their very brains were jagged by
“The long, dry see-saw of his horrible bray.”
Christian flesh and blood, of the very meekest could not endure the
torment, and at length the Abbé commanded one of the Chinese, who
travelled with the pilgrims to enforce the donkey to silence. Anyway,
and at any cost, that jackass must be dumfounded. The Chinaman,
in his manner, promised after his fashion, to bind the donkey over to
iſ keep the peace; and—delicious was the surprise, abounding the com-
forf–the Abbé and his companions slept soundly as babes. . .
In the morning, the §§ with a glow of gratitude in his breast,
demanded of the §hi. the means by which he had silenced the
ass. By what power was the donkey dumfounded ?
“Come here,” said JoHN CHINAMAN, and he led the way to an
adjoining shed, where stood the ass. But how stood he The very
type of beaten Fº enforced humility. His long ears hung lop-
§ down; his eyes were filmed, and his nose drawn to a point.
And more, and worse. Tied by a cord to the donkey's tail was a heavy
stone; which, do what he might, by no manner of muscular effort
could he lift from the ground. The Abbé gazed a little tenderly at
the humiliated jackass, but still awaited an explanation of the cause
of the ass's nocturnal silence. How was it?
“Look here,” said the Chinaman, and he pointed to the heavy stone
tethered to the brute's tail, and lying on the ground. “Look here;
when donkey can no lift him tale, donkey can no bray.”
Now, we confidently ask it, even of DERBY, Disra ELI, GLADston E,
AND Co.; if, in this Chinese matter, the Coalition had been tethered to
the responsibility of place,—would it, could it, have lifted its tail and
brayed, and brayed, and brayed as it has done?
THE SWEET USES OF ADVERSITY.
(By the Hermit of the Haymarket.)
YoU wear out your old clothes.
You are not troubled with many visitors.
You are exonerated from making calls.
Crossing sweepers do not molest you.
Bores do not bore you.
Sponges do not haunt your table.
Tax-gatherers hurry past your door. -
Itinerant bands do not play opposite your window.
You avoid the nuisance of serving on juries.
You are †. to stand godfather. -
No one thinks of presenting you with a Testimonial. -
No tradesman irritates you by asking, “Is there any other little
article to-day, Sir?”
Begging letter-writers leave you alone.
Impostors know it is useless to bleed you.
You practise temperance.
You swallow infinitely less poison than others.
Flatterers do not shoot their rubbish into your ear.
You are saved many a debt, many a tº: many a headache.
And, lastly, if you have a true friend in the world, you are sure, in a
very short space of time, to learn it!
Dangerous !
OUR gallantry forbids our calling ladies by hard names, but without
meaning in the slightest to impugn the orthodoxy of their sentiments,
we must say, that so long as they allow themselves such latitude in the
i. of Crinoline, they run an imminent risk of being spoken of as

Elderly Gentleman thinks that Garotting's come to a pretty pass when it's openly practised
in broad daylight. Where are the Police?
BY NO MEANS A BRITON.
MR. CoRDEN avows that Ciris Romanus sum is by no means a con-
ciliating motto for a trader in a foreign land to place over his counting-
house. MR. CoBDEN is, doubtless, quite right. Money is your true
cosmopolitan; and the breeches poc et bolts patriotism and all such
alaver. When you are in Japan, let yourself, all in the way of trade,
º like a tea-board. The Dutch were a wise people; and to
show their religion in thrift, and their inconvertible faith in money,
trod upon the emblem of the Cross, that they might be allowed to make
their penn'orth in the spice-market. Should MR. CoRDEN be returned
for any place—and there are floating doubts upon the matter—it is
said that he proposes to bring in a Bill to denaturalise himself as
a British-born subject. He is quite_right, for with his commercial
mind, he is a Citizen Bagman of the World. He is above all British
rejudices, and believes in nothing national save the National Debt.
#. has long since thought the battle of Trafalgar a myth, and Waterloo
nothing, more than an organised hypocrisy. BRITANNIA, instead of
ruling the waves, ought to work at the washing-tub, whilst the intrinsic
worth of her trident is outvalued by any Birmingham toasting-fork. |-
We repeat it, MR. CoRDEN spurns at the narrowness of mere country;
all º may be a native, but not MR. Cobden. His inward anatomy
has been so formed and moulded by the working vigour of his opinions
that, whereas the human heart is of an oblong shape, the heart of the
cosmopolitan CoBPEN is said to have become a complete sphere. In
shape and outward marking like one of MR. WYLD's four-inch globes;
a globe, when necessary to be put in your pocket, and nobody the
wiser for its whereabout.
A Chinese Puzzle.
. MR. CoBDEN and MR. R. PHILLIMORE complain of our Plenipoten-
tiary for not proceeding with CoMMIssionEB YEH'according to the recog-
nised rules of international diplomacy. We should like to know under
what heads in WATTEL, GROTIUs, or PUFFENDoRF we are to look for
the scale of prices to be put on the heads of our enemies, and what

article.
THE CRY OF THE CHINESE PARTY.
Accorping to the member for Rome, Russia,
ina, the Cannibal Islands, and the West
Riding, Lord PALMERSTON is to go to the
country with the cry of “War with China and
No Reform!”. But by the time of the approach-
ing election. YEH's business will perhaps have
been settled, and we shall, be, at peace with
China; and since the Hon. Member predicts that
we shall not, we have every reason, judging from
experience of his prophecies, to hope that we
shall. The cry of No Reform had better he kept
by MR. Cobden to himself and his party, in-
ºil. LoRD DERBY’s and MR. GLADSTöNE’s.
A Joint Stock. Banks Bill was wanted immedi-
ately; a Matrimonial Causes. Act was in pro-
j but, MR. Cobnºx's Chinese motion will
ave had the effect of postponing, and perhaps
preventing, these and other reforms. H. †.
Cobdenites and Derbyites and Peelites, then, c
“No Reform 1" for which the electors wi
understand that they are indebted to them; and
if peace with China is not concluded, they will
they prefer the cry of “Submission to China!”

THERE is a demand for a Bill providing uni-
formity in weights and measures. If that object
could be accomplished it would be ve

of the work will although having but sq
lately buried the hatchet, we can º think Šin CHARLEs is justified
in so soon throwing it. As a proof of his proficiency in verbal archery,
we find among his shots with the long bow a statement that in Russia
“A whole nation is placed in a degree of comfort quite equal to our own,"
—a fact which other travellers have not as yet revealed to us, and
which almost makes us wonder that SIR CHARLEs hasn't long since
turned his back upon ungrateful England, and become a resident in
Russia Felix. That he would be appreciated there he does not leave
one room to doubt, for he expressly introduces a “distinguished
Russian officer,” whom he quotes in all the glory of italics as remar
that "the Admirai's fame with us stands higher than ever.” SIR
CHARLEs having, with KING Clicquot, been among the non-comba-
tants, has of course a claim for rvöös from the Russians; and perhaps
the reason why his fame should rank more highly with them nºw than
ever is that, º the war is ended, he has not yet ceased in his
attacks upon his country, and is still attempting the destruction of our
national prestige. Having stormed at the Admiralty instead of
storming Sweaborg, and done his best to lower the standard of our
Navy after not pulling down the flag hoisted at Cronstadt, SIR
CHARLEs NAPIER's history, to have commanded any sale, should by
rights have been written in the Russian language, for we are convince
that few Englishmen will read it.

Á b N. “I NEVER knew such a cross old
Un | lilº unkind good-for-nothing old thing as you

then you suddenly turn ºil. and * and put such a note as

was about. I made a little mistake, and mixed "Fº LoRD CHAN-
cellor Lewis with Lord CRAN worth, the , Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Why could not you have set me right, and what is the
use of printers and all those sort of people' if they cannot correct
little inadvertencies like that ? And then for you to put a cross note,
and threaten to end our correspondence, I thought you were so old as
to be past silly petulance.” - -
“I have a very good mind not to write to you any more, and I will
not, either, unless you behave better to me. I suppose the changeable
weather has put you out of sorts, and at your time of life” it is trying,
but you should not let it make you rude to people... Now, I have for-
given you this time, and you shall be my dear old Mr. Panch again.
“Do you know DR. FARADAY Fº I suppose so, as you know all the
clever people in the world. Isn’t he a dear? We went, that is fizzy
HAMERtoN and her brother CHARLEs, and AUGUSTUs and me," to the
Royal Institution the other night, and DR. FARADAY gave a lecture;
PRINCE ALBERT was there with his star on, looking, so graye and
elegant; and by the way, I do wish that you would not have ridiculous
#. made of him, for he is excessively, good-looking still, and I
are say much handsomer than any of you folks that, caricature him."
He listened with the utmost steadiness, and I do not believe he moved
half a quarter of an inch all the time. They set him in a great, chair,
you know, exactly in front of the lecturer. We had pretty good seats,
considering that AUGUSTUs kept us waiting a quarter of an hour while
he smoked his cigar (CHARLEs HAMERTON don't smoke), but it is
extremely absurd to see rows of old gentlemen, mostly, with, bald
heads, in the front of the audience, and of course in the best places,
while ladies are poked up in back rows.". When AUGUSTU's came from
school, he used to say something in Latin—ingenious diddy something
—meaning that studying the arts and sciences hindered men from
being Bears 17 I am sure it does not in Albemarle Street, or a couple
of the old creatures would have given up their places to me and
IZZY.
“But the lecture was lovely. It was quite a treat to look at dear
DR. FARADAY's earnest face and silvery hair, not that he is an old man,
far from it, and he is far more light and active than many a smoky
stupid all-round collar-man that I know, and I believe that it is the
cigar-smoke that makes you all so sluggish, and the doctors are quite
right...CHARLEs HAMERTON says that tobacco drives almost everybod
mad, besides bringing on asthma, and blindness, and paralysis, an
corns. I hope you don’t smoke, my dear Mr. Punch, it would make
me very miserable if I thought you did.". But I was going to tell you
about the lecture. Do you know what Gravitation is?. Of course you
will say you do... Well, it is all wrong, and so poor children are not to
be bothered by Governesses with that rubbish any more...It is all-let
me have the words, right—it is all Conservation of Forces. This
seemed quite clear to me at the time, especially with the beautiful
experiments which he does so carefully and yet so easily. ... I am not
certain that I can explain it quite so well now, but if you hit a piece of
lead very hard, it sets fire to phosphorus; and if you stick up two
§. of iron, and sprinkle mails over them, they make a perfect rustic
ridge. That is, you know, you must put them near an electrifying
machine, and when you take away the wires, down comes the bridge
or the Tour de Nesle, as CHARLEs HAMERTóN cleyerly said. . Then i
you take a long platinum wire, and electrify it, it becomes red hot in a
single second, and you can make amethyst sparks fly out of it. This
proves the Conservation of Forces, and it only shows, what idiots men
are to go on repeating gravitation, gravitation, like cuckoos, just
because SIR ISAAC NEwton saw an apple fall out of a tree (and i dare
say, he eat it, like a pig, as all men are) and now comes a really clever
philosopher, and explains it all away.” I could not tell you of half the
experiments dear DR. FARADAY did, but there was one, when he
rubbed a bit of sealing-wax in some flannel, and made some gold leaves
dance in a jar, which proved quite clearly to me that there must be
some force to do it, somewhere, because they never danced of them-
selves. It was a most beautiful lecture, and if anything could excel
it, it was the kindness of DR. FARADAY afterwards, when ladies, came
and asked him questions, and he did not look supergilious, or what is
worse, look condescending, but he entered with evident pleasure into
explanations, and did several little experiments for us," electrifying
some things like large metal buttons, and turning wet white paper brown
with them; and if we did not understand it, it was our own faults, not
his, or rather it was the fault of the system of education you men give
us, which makes us either quote like parrots, or stare like owls, when

“Another thing struck me, and I must say it. Here was DR FARADAY
a really great man, diving into the wonderful secrets of nature, and
º: them in the ablest manner. Where were all the great men
and the statesmen, and the M.P.'s, and all those who pretend to lead
the world. Listening to him, as he unfolded these mighty things?
Not they. That very night it seems, there was a fierce squabble going on
in Parliament, nominally about the savages in China, but really to settle
whether one set of H.’s (you know) or the other should have situations
of Government, and take our money.” And such is the nature of men
that for one person in London who was thinking that night about DR;
FARADAY, and his splendid discoveries, a hundred were arguing and
betting whether Ministers would be beaten or not. As CHARLEY HAMER-
ToN” (he told me this) said, very wittily, “I wonder whether Lord
PALMERston will be as successful in his Conservation of his Forces.”
Dear LoRD PALMERSTON, I consider the way he is persecuted as per-
fectly WICKED, and you may print that I say so."

POISONED TEA.
BRITISH public, look to your tea-pots!, Great would be our remorse
to give needless alarm to the meanet individual, if, in his own opinion
there exists such a person. , Nevertheless, we iterate our warning, an
cry to the British world, look to your tea-pots! The Chinese, with
their almond eyes, are a far seeing º i. many centuries, accord-
ing to MR. CoppEN, they anticipated ARISTOTLE; and had nameless
BAcons, plentiful as Chinese hogs, ages before the time of the Norum
Organon, Long before his time, they had driven herds and herds of
hilosophic pigs to market, weaning rising generations upon the succu-
}. fatness of moral rashers. Well, these gifted Chinese foresaw, the
coming atrocities to be inflicted upon them by the barbarian English,
and were predetermined. With the inborn power of looking into the
very centre of a mill-stone, they had had a prospective view of the core
of SIR John BowRING's heart, and steadfastly resolved upon retribution,
To this end, some time *†wº reserve to ourselves the privilege o
withholding the precise date—the Chinese poisoned a few thousand
chests of tea shipped for the English market. At this very hour, we
believe that that deadly tea is mortally operating. LORD, DERRY's
profound, philosophic people, who knead death in bread, and craftily
qualify, the public springs with poison, are, as we verily believe
triumphing at this hour in very many houses, besides the House o
Commons. We are quite open to correction if we are, in error; but
we are rather confident that the subjoined alarming intelligence may be
relied upon.
At breakfast, following the division on MR. CoBDEN's motion, MR.
W. J. Fox felt very curious qualms upon swallowing his first cup of tea.
LoRD GoDERIGH, revolving the result of the motion, thought the
tea tasted ve oddly. The question darted through the fiberal brain:
Had he been hocussed?
MR. RoeBUCK, before he had swallowed a mouthful of the cup that
was wont to cheer, detected as he believed, a flavour of sugar of lead.
He felt a strange sensation, but at the time could not determine whether
caused by remorse or the colic.
MR. LAYARD found his morning Pekoe very bitter in the mouth. As
f|at this alarming, time, it is our duty again solemnly to repeat to the
a traveller, he had always much delighted in tea. But—perhaps it was
the thought of what they would say at Aylesbury—the tea of the fourth
inst. went shockingly against his stomach.
IORD. J. Russell's tea, was by no means to his liking. He never-
theless believed it would do him good; and purely out of respect to a
much-loved constitution, gulped it.
MR. TITE's tea, although as weak as, water, and milked with ass’s
milk, appeared to him, even as a liberal architect, to be a tea of the
strangest composition.
MR. Cobden paused a moment, upon swallowing half a cupfull.
However, remembering the Chinese precursor of ARISTOTLE, the Hon.
Member for the West Riding, confidently stirred his Bohea, and calmly
took it down, calmly as Socrates swallowed his poison.
Mr. W. Williºs, the liberal Member for Lambeth, gulped his tea
scalding hot; having but little sense of palate, and no bowels.
These are a few of the cases. We could add to the number. But

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
9TH. Monday. THE EARL
of SHAFTESBURY got
the Government to pro-
mise that SIR RICHARD
BETHELL and MR. STU-
ART WoRTLEY should
say whether our India
merchants are right in
smuggling opium into
China; but it was upon
the distinct understand-
ing that whatever the
A. G. an G. might

* not committed to under-
take to do anything.

of the Bishop of Ox-
Ford (who dandles him
affectionately, as por-
trayed in the adjacent
cartoon), is becoming a

everybody else, inclu
the Čhina Coalition.
In the Commons, MR.
Shaw LEFEVRE, the
Speaker, stated that he
had really had enough of
them, and meant to re-
tire at the end of the
Session. Next night
LoRD PALMERSTON, MR.
DisBAELI, LoRD John
Russell, and SIR John
PAKINGTON, , , delivered
orations in his honour
and the House addressed

MR. LEFEVRE IS THE
ouse of CoMMONs witHIN_MR. PUNCH's REcoLLECTION, with whoM THAT
to fi. him, a peerage, to which the Commons promised to add a pension.
and on Friday the complimentary intention of the House was carried out.
ONLY MEMBER of ANY
GENTIEMAN HAs NEVER round A SINGLE FAULT., Without undervaluing a peerage or a pension of
£4,000 a-year, Mr. Punch feels that in placing the above fact upon record, in small capitals, he has done
far more than even his Sovereign or Parliament, towards rewarding his Lordship for eighteen years
of valuable service. -
On the second reading of the bill for reducing the Income. Tax, MR. DISRAELI had a few flings at
the PREMIER, and sneered at “turbulent and aggressive diplomacy;” and LoRD PALMERSTON, in
return, recapitulated a few of his own merits, and scoffed at the phrase manufactured by Dizzy for an
election cry. MR. GLADSTONE cavilled at everything that Government had done, and LoRD JOHN
RUSSELL also grumbled a good deal, but in a more practical tone. He also sºº; against
the American proposition touching Éngland's surrender of her maritime rights, and Mr. Punch, for auld
lang syne, is glad to set down any commendable word or deed on the part of an old friend who is his
own worst enemy. , SIR CHARLEs WooD then asked for and received 53,700 men for the navy, to be at
his service till the 3rd of July. A million and a half of money, or so, was, of course, handed to him for
expenses. -
Tuesday. The Lords did nothing, beyond agreeing to a new plan for taking their divisions without
†. strangers—assimilating their system to that in the Commons, ; the important exception
of the Proxy.
In the Commons MR. Spoon ER promised—everybody knows what—for the next session. The hunting
season is nearly over, but if that daring and -natured fox-hunter, the Horsetaming NEW DEGATE,
in return for many kindnesses from Mr. Punch, would oblige him by trying to ride over his intolerable
colleague in the course of the next fortnight, Nimrod N. shall have a session's immunity for his ultra-
Protestantism. Is it a bargain?
WILLIAM WILLIAMs and APSLEY PELLATT, being the only two Metropolitan Members who voted for
dishonouring the national ...; and maltreating the country's servants, thought it necessary to try a bit
of clap-trap for their Lambeth and Southwark constituents, so brought in a motion which they knew
could not be carried, for abolishing the Income Tax on incomes under £150. Only five other humbugs
voted with, them, and though constituencies that return such persons are shown, ipso facto, to be very
foolish, such a transparent trick as this can hardly be serviceable. An abstract, proposition of MR;
GLADstone's, about revision of taxation, was advanced by him for the sake of talking, and negatived
when there had been talking enough, or a trifle later.
Wednesday. The Imaum of Muscat has ceded to England the Kooria Mooria islands, wherein is much
guano. It may not be generally known that this oriental Party claims sovereignty over immense
territory, and lots of islands, Asiatic and African; has a large naval force, and seems to be a very just
and liberal despot. We do not believe that anybody in the House of Commons, (except, perhaps, some
foung lady in the gallery,) when SIR JAMEs DUKE asked for some correspondence on the subject, cºuld
}. given, º: above information. Twenty-one millions were voted to meet, Exchequer. bills
for this year, and three millions for civil services (including education, some members patriotically
objecting to pay for this) and revenue
expenses – not a -hour's
work.
Thursday. LoRD DERby threatened
the Peers with a speech on the subject
of the coming Dissolution, with which
he is na y as much dissatisfied as
most men are with the distressing
results of a blunder which they in.
tended for a masterpiece of cleverness.
He rammed a blunderbuss chock full
of faction, and gave it to three mis-
chievous fellows to fire off. They
F. the trigger, and the recoil has
nocked them all backwards, and he
will have a good deal to pay before he
hears the last of the affair.
LoRD ELLENBoRough, under cover
of some remarks in favour of our
keeping scrupulous faith with the
Chinese, gave some capital practical
advice as to the best mode of making
war upon them. LoRD PANMURE
promised to maintain the honour of
the Flag, and said that Government
were going to send out an officer to
negociate for what was just and
reasonable, and if he could not get
that, he would fall on China with all
his might, LoRD PANMURE trusting
in Providence for a successful re-
sult. The envoy is Lord ELGIN.
The same day came the mail, with
news that ADMIRAL SEYMoUR had
given the Chinese a further hint that
we were in earnest, by burning down
the western suburbs of Canton.
The Commons did an excellent thing
—their approaching end evidently im-
resses them with virtuous sentiments.
R. PALK, a Conservative country
member, moved a resolution for the
recognition, by the House, of the ser-
vices of SIR John M'NEILL and
CoLoRELTULLoch, the Crimean Com-
missioners. He ably recapitulated
their labours, and though the Govern-
ment did not like a vote which delibe-
rately recorded the conviction of the
House that the Board at Chelsea was a
sham, got up to scour the dirty reputa-
tions of persons with aristocratic con-
nections, the proximity of the Hustin
forbade fight for the Horse-Guards,
and an address to the Crown (SIDNEY
HERBERT º: it), was voted,
praying a signal acknowledgment of
the merits of the Commissioners. The
frightful profanity which this decision
has caused at the military clubs, can
only be estimated by those who, have
seen an ignorant, gallant, bullying,
gouty old officer, in a purple rage.
|FRED. Peri, then asked for and re.
ceived 126,796 men for the 'army, to
be at his service for four months. A
couple of millions, or so, was of course
i. to him for expenses.
Friday. LoRD CAMPBELL seems de-
termined to be a Real Blessing to the
Press. He hoped that in next Session
the grievances to which journalists are
exposed by the law of libel would be
j. and he specially adverted
to the abominable costs which a news-
paper incursin defending itself against
the attack of a worthless plaintiff and
a greedy attorney, even when the
brace of rascals are kicked out of
court by a jury. The L. C.J. thought
that some measure might be devised
for making the costs in such a case
fall upon the party, who brought the
action. This would certainly be an
improvement, to which might be added

Lord ELLENBoRough had entirely approved the war, which he
regarded as waged with Russia, and looked at the peace as a sort of
victory over her. - - -
Government is trying to save Smithfield from the civic Vandals, and
to keep it for some public purpose, but the corporation is eager to
rab arental, and resists. FRED. PEEL said that a commission was to

which MR. STAFFORD professed a conviction, shared, by Mr. Panch,
that the authorities will do as little as º 1. can. Miss
NIGHTINGALE's approbation of the condition of the hospital at Wool-
* was mentioned to the House with natural satisfaction by the Hero
OI rvars.
The Mutiny Acts have been brought in, and to light SIR. G. LEWIS
had but to ask for Thirteen Millions of money for Ways and Means to
have it. A brief Saturday sitting helped on matters of form. We
shall soon be off. The country must be looking pleasant; daffodils
and celandine are flowering, the rooks are repairing their old nests,
and the trout begin to rise. - -
In the course of the debate on the Navy Estimates it was stated,
that “on board HER MAJESTY's ships there were always a number of
Novices.” The idea struck Mr. Punch as so charming a one, that he
could not refrain from making his pictorial record of it. A British
Sailor's life must indeed be pleasant under such circumstances. How
delightful to keep the watch with a party of Novices!
NEXT PRESENTATIONS AT COURT.
We observe that, at the late levée, various persons were presented
on their promotion in the Army or Navy, their return from foreign
service, their accession to title, their marriage, their appointment to
F. situations, their investment with the Order of the Bath and the
egion of Honour, and on divers other accounts and occasions. We
missed the name of John MARKHAM, presented on his liberation from
rison by a free pardon for an offence which he never committed.
uch a presentation, by the Secretary of State for the Home Depart-
ment, would be an appropriate amends—plus a sum of money—to a
sufferer who had been injured by a “legal accident.”

emerged from the swaddling-clothes of her first childhood. It would
seem, also, so far removed are they in civilisation from us, that
several of their discoveries have not had time yet to reach us! We
look forward with the greatest interest to MR. Cobden's new work.

A PRETTY KIND OF CARPENTERS.
By advices from Paris we learn that—
“The EMPERoR, the day before yesterday, received a deputation of 30 carpenters

It does not appear whether the flowers alluded to were natural or arti;
ficial, but, presented by carpenters, they may be reasonably supposed
to have been of the latter kind, and specimens of carving in the sub-
stance in which those artificers work. Probably those flowers consisted
1n*. of wood violets, wood anemones, and woodbine made out of
real wood. But, if they were actual odoriferous flowers of spring, a
question arises about the donors. The carpenters are stated to have
been headed by their master. Is not this a mistake? In France there
is a much greater scope afforded to female industry than there is here,
and, considering the prettiness and delicacy of the present, should you
not think that the correct statement . have been that the carpen-
tresses were headed by their mistress?
A Home Question Settled at Last.
THE birthplace of St. MédARD, who is the French St. SwitHIN,

PLAYHOUSE PAROXYSMS.
THE retained critic of the Morning Herald had a most
lovely, essay on the pº, of the last miracle at
the Princess's Theatre—Richard II. Among other
encouraging intelligence, he assures a thoughtful public
that the spectators (we were about to write audience)
were “in a frenzy of delight.” Is not this a case for
the Commissioners of L ?. It is said that private
boxes and stalls will henceforth be let with strait waist.
goats. There can be no doubt that the pageant is very
fine, and the scenery beautiful, exceedingly. Since the
meeting of the Chartists there has not been displayed
such a gathering of an English mob. We have little
doubt that, in memory of his own special constableship,
Louis NAPOLEON will forward to the manager the Cross
of the Legion of Honour. A knighthood §. hitherto
been spoken of as the final reward of MR. KEAN's scenic
and decorative spirit; but after Richard II, it is not
reasonably supposed that he will escape with less than
a baronetcy. Nay, in further consideration of the ad.
mirable manner in which a portion of MR. BATTY's stud
has been trained, it would not at all surprise us if the
manager were also made perpetual Master of the Horse.
Geography for Ever.
WE perceive that MR. JAMEs WYLD, of Charing
Cross, has issued an address to the electors of Bodmin.
Should he be returned, there will be, in the next House
of Commons, at least one Chartist.
ELECTION INTELLIGENCE,
(With verbal Illustrations.)
City of London.—Should LoRp JQHN RusseIL be snubbed by
London, he will pop into the Bedford borough of Tavistock.
“A mouse, with but one hole at need,”
Is sure a foolish mouse indeed.
BARON Rothschi LD will, as usual, be supported for the Christian city.
“And why? I am a Jew "
Tiverton.—Gracefully refusing a hundred places, PALMERSTON re-
mains true to Tiverton.
“And “master’ of himself, though China fall."
Oxford University.—MR. GLADSTONE will, if necessary, split votes
into any number of any tenuity.
“So fine, there's nought 'twixt him and nothing.”
Bucks.-MR. DISRAELI will very confidently face his old con-
stituents.
“An oiled and curled Assyrian bull.”
Southampton.—The Bank-Governor, MR, WEGUELIN," has the very
best reasons for assured success.
“I promise to pay—.”
Manchester.—Though lost to sight, to memory dear. John BRIGHT
stands for Cottonopolis.
“Some CRomwell guiltless of his country's blood.”
Lambeth.-MR.W. WILLIAMs is by no means sure of his seat: his
Chinese vote is all against him.
“Some men cannot abide a gaping pig.”
MR. ALDERMAN WIRE offers his legal knowledge to the borough.
“He was—could he help it—a special attorney.” -
Tewkesbury.—Positively MR. HuMPHREY BRowN will again go for
re-election.
“A man he was to all the country dear.”
Bodmin.—It is certain that MR. WYLD is about to prepare himself
for the hustings.
“Put money in thy purse.”
Frome-MR. DoNALD N1col, of the cosmopolitan paletót, again
contests Frome.
“Not men, but measures.”
ºther careless of the result, MR. RoBBUCK will just
stand for. Sheffield.
“This is some fellow,
Who having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect
A saucy roughness.”
Greenwich.-LIEUT.-GEN. CodRINGTON again solicits the purity of
the borough.
“You cannot touch pitch, and not be defiled.”
West Riding.—MR. CoPDEN gracefully and considerately retires.
“No man was ever written down but by himself.”
Southwark-SIR CHARLEs NAPIER has determined again to face the
constituency. “Cease, rude Boreas.”
Finsbury–MR. SERJEANT PARRY graces the hustings, and hopefully
addresses the electors.
“Then he will talk; ye Gods ! how he will talk.”
Marylebone.—SIR BENJAMIN HALL and LoRD EBRINGTON are to
remain undisturbed.
“Silence that dreadful BELL.”
Westminster. — Churchwarden WESTERTON,
threatens DE LACY and SIR. T. W. SHELLEY.
“Night's candles are burnt out.”
Tamworth-SIR Ropert PEEL, as a matter of course, will be sent
back to the House of Commons.
“Babylon was built of bricks.”
West Surrey—MR. H. DRUMMOND is, doubtless, certain of re-
election.
of Knightsbridge
“I understand a fury in thy words, but not thy words.”
Carlisle.-There is an unanimous feeling against SIR JAMES GRAHAM
“For any change must better our condition.”
North Warwickshire.—The present members, SPOONER and NEWDE-
GATE, are said to be safe for re-election.
“Troubles never come single.”
Sunderland—It is said that MR. GEORGE HUDson will absolutely
stand again.
“And when his legs were smitten off,
He fought upon his stumps.”
Midhurst.—MR. SAMUEL WARREN has been cordially received, and
will be duly returned.
“Where the Bee sucks, there lurk I—"
“To paint the Lily—"
Birmingham.–MR. MUNTz is very confident, despite of China, of
re-election.
“A rugged man, o'ergrown with hair.”
Maldon.-MR. MECHI, not wishing to divide the liberal interest, has
retired.
“A razor warranted not to cut.”
Nineveh at Aylesbury.

“GENTLEMEN -
“THE parliamentary. ship being about to go to

He won't again be sent to another Black Sea with no

“Be certain, Gentlemen, that I shall do the best to
support the trade of Southwark in its exports to Russia,
being assured by the GRAND DUKE CoNSTANTINE, who is
every inch, and a little, more a, sailor, that he has the
liveliest affection for the people of Southwark, and a
particular admiration for one of your Members.
“I regret that the sudden dissolution of Parliament
should not have allowed me to overhaul young SIR RoBERT
PEEL as I intended; but just only return me, and see if I
don't yet polish him off as clean as any scupper-nail.
“As for the Lords of the Admiralty, a sense of private
duty compels me to say that I despise the whole boiling

It is our chief desire our calling to pursue,

AUSTRIA TO IRELAND.
AN impulsive gratitude is one of the noble characteristics of Irish-
men; hence, the Irish papers have for some time rung with the praises
of the Archibuciness Sophix of Austria, mother of the present
Emperor, for having bestowed upon one MR. WILLIAM BERNARD
M“CABE, a Dublin, author, a breast-pin, for his work called Adelaide,
3. of Italy. The pin is a very fine affair, indeed. “It is,” writes
aunders's enthusiast:-
“It is a shamrock, of which the stem and leaves are composed of brilliants of the
finest water, and the dazzling richness of which is set off by a thin rim of jet black
enamel, in imitation of the Irish oak. A more "º. or more beautiful present
Jor an Irishman to receive could not possibly be devised; and, so truly gorgeous is
this dazzling cluster of no less than twenty-eight diamonds, that it may be well said
it is one such as alone the mother of an Emperor could bestow.”
Somehow the character of the giver will hang about the gift. Now,
the ARGH-DUCHEss SoPHIA has a peculiar mode of showing her taste
in jewellery. For instance, history tells us that on the first anniversary
of the day of Arad, of that day on which the martyrs of Hungary
bled upon the scaffold, this woman Sophia came to court with a
bracelet of rubies set in so many roses as were the number of heads
of the brave Hungarians who fell there. A knowledge of this fact
does, somehow, throw a blight upon the shamrock vouchsafed to MR.
M'CABE-does make the “dazzling cluster” of diamonds scarcely
more lustrous than so many coffin-nails.
“Pour Encourager les Autres.”
“A Gover NMENT,” says LoRD PALMERston, when pressed on the
subject of SIR John BowRING, “must support its subordinates.”
Admitted. How does. LoRD PALMERSTON reconcile this doctrine of
his with the way in which SIR John M'NEILL and Colon ELTULLoch
have been treated P

PUNCH*S COMPLETE TRADESMAN.
No. III.
MR. BITTERs, Publican, is seated in his little parlour behind the bar,
with MR. CRADLE, who is going to Australia.
º
l
Mr. Bitters (raising his glass). Well, Sir, here’s luck to you, and
my your }*; be the .."; of you. . . -
1r. Cradle. Thanks, mine host, and in the mean, time may }.
prosper, as you deserve to do. What capital porter this is. I shall
not taste º: ':ke it in the Antipodes.
Mr. Bitters. This is the stuff, just as it comes, out of MALTHOUSE,
HoPPER, & Co.'s brewery. I always keep a small cask for friends.
º, §a. Is it not the same that you draw for those people at
your bar
Mr. Bitters. I should rather say that it was not exactly the same.
This, which you are drinking, is made of malt and hops, and nothing
else. One wouldn't be so stingy as not to give a discerning public
more "...}.
Mr. Cradle. Dear me, you surprise me.
Mr. Bitters. You’re right to go to Australia, friend CRADLE, for you
are too iſnocent for our part of the world.
Mr. Cradle. Perhaps so, perhaps so. By the way, what on earth is
that cart at your door P
Mr. Bitters. A thing that goes on wheels.
... Mr. Cradle. Very funny, very funny. But seriously. I read upon
it, "Hocus, Brewer's Druggist.”
. Mr. Bitters. And why shouldn't a man put his name on his cart, and
his trade too. Let's ask the man himself. Here he is, coming up
from the cellar.
Jºnfer M.R. Hocus.
Mr. Bitters. Well, friend Hocus. Sit down, and, do as we do.
Another tankard, IsabelLA. Here, Sir, it’s stuff that you’ve had
nothing to do with.
Mr. Hocus. Quite sure of that? Then, service, gents. (Drinks.)
Ah! That’s the stuff to stick to your ribs.
Mr. Bitters. And the stuff your ribs stick to—you should see MRs.
BITTERs at it.
Mr. Hocus. How’s the new baby?
Mr. Bitters. Yes, that’s where it is. Always some good reason.
But CRADLE’s a bachelor, and don't understand these things. He
wants to know why we don’t draw this stuff at the bar.
Mr. Hocks. You’d soon be drawing your schedule if you did.
Mr. Cradle. Is it possible?, Well, now, I am going to Australia, and
you may speak before me without hesitation.
Mr. Bitters. Give him a wrinkle or two, Hocus. He may find it
useful with the kangarooses:
Mr. Hocus...All tiled P. Well then, Sir, you must know that this
º here, is what comes from the brewers, to whom our friend's
Quse belongs, and who put him in here. They charge him so much,
of course, and a tidy price, too, for his porter, and besides that he owes
them a heavy debt, and º could sell him up in a jiffy, if he
wasn't ready with his money when their collector came. I’m speaking
by the card, friend BITTERs, I think?
Mr. Bitters. Which it are, Sir, and purceed.
Mr. Hocus. So, MR, CAUDLE—
Mr. Cradle (smiling). CRADLE.
Mr. Hocus. Come, pretty near relations. Well, Sir, it’s clear there-
fore that MR. BITTERS must make a profit, or be sold up. , Preferring
º a profit, we take our porter, and we put a precious lot of water
InLO 1U.
Mr. Cradle. But that must destroy the colour.
Mr. Hocus. Right, Sir, and we restore that colour with treacle.
Mr. Cradle. But that must destroy the taste.
Mr. Hocus. Right again, Sir, and we restore that with sugar and salt.
Mr. Cradle. Dear me, how ingenious !
Mr. Hocus. We have other dodges, Sir, equally so. Now, sulphate
of iron, in the case of stout, is added, to give it a head. We have other
things for improving the taste, that is to say for destroying the taste
º: water and the sugar and the treacle. Gentian is a fine bitter,
Sir Capsicum is hot, Sir. Alum and sulphuric acid we also use, Sir,
and while upon the subject I may add, that further to disguise the
character of our broth, we add i.e. salts of tartar, and tobacco.
Opium is also fºllº used.
Mr. Cradle. Dear me!, May I askin what proportion the water is used?
Mr. Hocus. Eight#;" to a barrel is about your mark, BITTERs?
Mr. Bitters. Say Eight, and don't forget a pound or so of gelatine.
Mr. Hocus. There is another article that strengthens beer very much,
MR. CRADLE: The regular chemists call it by the foolish name of
Cocculus Indicus, and regard it as a downright poison, for which reason
we avoid ugly words, and call it “multum.” -
Mr. Cradle. With all this assistance, I should think that you might
º; beer at wholesale price.
ſr. Bitters, I sell at the same price as the brewers sell to me... Can
I say fairer than that? I get Ali my profit out of the dodges friend
Hocus has described.
Mr. Cradle. Ah! Then if I was to buy at the brewery door instead
of over your bar, I should get wholesome stuff at the same price that I
should pay here for your adulterated liquorf
Mr. Bitters. Yes, Sir. But if MALTHouse, HoPPER, & Co. were
fools enough to let you do that, instead of filtering their beer through
a thousand public houses, Mr. Minºrious wºuldn't keep thirty
racers, MR. HoPPER wouldn't be in Parliament, and MR. Co. wouldn't
have houses in Belgrave Square. You are only looking at the porter
cask, Sir. There’s wheels within wheels. Have another tankard, and,
BILL (calls) I say BILL, just shove that woman into the street, she has
º, her money, and she is disgracing the place by her noise. Out
With her.
Mr. Cradle. Poor thing, perhaps multum don't agree with her.
Mr. Hocus. Perhaps not, so she’ll try parvum to-morrow. Ha!, ha!
Mr. Cradle. Adieu, Gentlemen. I have to go to the Docks, Ithank
}. for your information, and should I ever return to England, I shall
ope to see a system established which permits the Brewer to prosper,
without making the Publican a rascal, and the Public a victim.
ADWICE TO OLD WOMEN.
(or Both sExEs.)
YoUR money will never be safe, Punch declares,
While you keep with it parting for rotten Bank shares:
It more safe in old stockings or tea-pots had lain,
Or in some carpet-bag or box marked with your name.
Not a bubble now bursts, not a bank falls to fºund,
But shows how directors keep robbing around:
How the company’s funds to their own use they take,
Then suspend their cash payments, and scarce themselves make
Recent cases in point clear as moonday disclose,
How accounts may be overdrawn under the rose:
While the manager acts as a sort of head cook,
And keeps the thing dark in his own “little book.”
Now as long as subscribers are found for the soap,
That the blowing of bubbles will cease there’s no hope :
So, old ladies, be warned, such investments forsake,
And in safety your cash to Threadneedle Street take.
Estimates that very much Require Reduction.
MR. W. WILLIAMs's Estimate of his own arithmetic.
MR. GLADSTONE's Estimate of the Budget of 1853: .
MR. HuMPHREY BRowN's Estimate of the force of impudence.
MR. NEwBEGATE's Estimate of the patience of Parliament.
SIR.JAMEs GRAHAM's Estimate of his powers of Humbug.
And, MR. DISRAELI's Estimate of himself, and his political prospects.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FAST-DAY AT THE MANSION HOUSE.
H! MR. GLADSTONE. What
‘ do you think of LoRD PAL-
MERston and HERMAJESTY's
Ministers now? Read this:–
“Lord PALMERston and HER
MAJESTY's Ministers yesterday in-
timated their acceptance of an invi-
tation from the RIGHT Hon. The
LoRD MAYor, to partake of a ban-
uet at the Mansion House on Fri-
y, the 20th instant; Cards have
been issued to Members of both
Houses of Parliament and other
distinguished guests."
There, Sir; that is the an:
nouncement which appeared
the other day in the Times.
LoRD PALMERSTON and his
colleagues. go to a 19FD
MAYor's feast, on a Friday,
and not only on a Friday, but a Friday in Lent' ere is every
reason to fear that they will not stop at the turtle—which, in
theology, perhaps, comes under the name of Fish, though º
calls it 'Réptile. No doubt they will proceed to indulge in all the
delicacies of the heretic LoRD Yor’s table, and the Protestant
SeaSon. hat will DR. Pusey say? MRs. GRUNDY may, not,
perhaps, have any very particular remark to make on a subject
with regard to which doctors and old women differ. This step, of
ostentatiously going to dine at the Mansion-house on a Lenten Friday
is evidently a demonstration on the PREMIER's part quite of a piece
with his appointment of Low Church bishops, which rendered the
Budget so objectionable—didn't it —and put the Government so
terribly in the wrong on the Chinese question. But all, the better for
you: Catholic Oxford will now be more unanimous than ever in the
determination to support GLADSTONE and Romanesque red herring
against PALMERSTON and English roast beef.
THE SHOCKING LANGUAGE OF THE TURF.
A SpoRTING journalist who writes under the name of “ARGUs,”
made, the other day, this startling statement respecting the Liverpool
steeplechase :—
“The casualties reported were, two killed and four slightly wounded; and so
ended “The Great Liverpool,’ which has created more interest than that of many
years past, although the class of horses and riders were not so well known to fame
as when the race was first established.”
Whether the killed and wounded were horses or riders, “ARGUs.”
omits to give the slightest hint, but as the bipeds engaged in steeple-
chases do occasionally break their necks, some intimation as to which
he meant, would not, perhaps, have been altogether unnecessary.
Some readers too might also like to know if the killed and wounded in
the Liverpool steeplechase were horses or asses.
FAREWELL TO THE FAIR 1
"Apolition of GREENwich FAIR.—We stop the press to announce, on the most
reliable authority, that the battle is now won, and Greenwich Fair is abolished.”—
Greenwich Free Press.
Richardson's Ghost, loquitur. “O now for ever
Farewell the organ grind! farewell the tent
Of Crown and Anchor and those horrid bores
To nervous folk, the scratchbacks! O farewell,
Farewell the dinning gongs, and the big drums,
The speaking-trumpets, and th' earpiercing shrieks
Of kissers in the ring ! farewell all fun,
Lark, row, and spreeishness of glorious Greenwich!
And O R. banjoed Ingins, whose hoarse throats
The railway rattle rudely counterfeit,
Farewell! That fellow’s occupation's gone
At Greenwich Fair who used to come out strong.”
A Contradiction in Terms.
Who is to be the new Plenipotentiary to China? Odd as it may
seem, while admitting the post to be one in which the utmost decision
will be necessary, we should prefer for this duty the most “YEH may”
style of man that can be §§
MORE CHEMICAL THAN COMICAL.
LORD DERBy is anxious to resemble the fiery RUPERT in more ways
than one. Judging by the rapid fall of his party since his late man-
ceuvres, he seems determined to invent his own “RUPERT's drop.”
FASHION AND ITS VICTIMS.
WE understand that the upholsterers, especially at the West End,
are suffering severely from #. Crinoline º They complain
that, in consequence of the increasing width of ladies' dresses, drawing-
rooms have now to be only half furnished; the space that used to be
available for loo tables and cabinets being now required for whalebone
ribs and air-tubes. They anticipate, indeed, if the contagion spread
more widely, that furniture will have to be dispensed with altogether,
simply from the reason that there will be no room for it; and some of
the alarmists of the trade are so assured that Crinoline will soon be
fatal to their business interests, that they are wearing mourning in
expectancy for their commercial demise. -
e cannot wonder at the panic which the petticoats are causing,
for at every successive evening party we *..." we find our chances
of a seat, more and more diminishing, the chairs, being gradually
jº by the flounces. We calculated that at the last soirée we
did duty at there was supplied an average of an inch and three-sixteenths
of sitting space apiece; and even standing room became so scarce
that, had we been late comers, we should have been reduced to echo
the request of ARCHIMEDEs, and perplex the footman by demanding
Aós u0, too ará. It was quite needless for the lady of the house tº
hope that would-be early-goers would not think of moving, for all
were so completely in a fix that it was impossible for any laws of
motion to be acted on. Everybody was so jammed up by the air:
jupons and wedged in with the widths of the dresses which surrounded
them, that all the travelled stars of the evening became fixed ones, and
even the most roving of Englishmen found himself for once deprived of
locomotion; for such was the sea of Crinoline about him, that he could
not stir a step without putting his foot in it.
LATEST FROM AMERICA.
THE understanding American politics is of course out of the question,
and we should despise the braggart who affected to comprehend them.
But a fact is a fact, and we therefore extract from a leading article in
the New York Herald its very latest Summary of domestic affairs in
the States.
“THE PRINCIPLE of REGULAR NoMENcLATURE HAS Received A BLACK EYE FROM
THE BOGUS DEMOCRACY of THE oystER CELLAR8."
Without pretending to the faintest comprehension of the meaning of
this statement, we publish it as the last news from America. What is
the reason why, with this kind of slang accepted in society as an exposi-
tion of the politics of the States, our American relatives keep up the
nonsense of alleging that the two countries speak one language?

THE MEMBERS' EARLY CLOSING ASSOCIATION,
|
- -> --
WE are delighted to learn, and every reader of the newspaper will
feel a corresponding thrill of joy to hear from us, that the Early
Closing. Movement is fast gaining ground in Parliament, and before
long will receive full legislative confirmation. Of this we are assured
by a clairvoyant gobemouche, who professes to have seen the rough
draft of a bill, which he assumes will be brought forward under
Government auspices as soon as ever LoRD PALMERSTON has been
returned for England, and will be entitled “An Act for the Shortening
of Speeches in Parliament, and for the Early Closing of the Mouths of
the longer winded Members.” Of this important measure, which, as
“time is money” will effect so immense a saving to the nation, that
all true economists must certainly support it, we believe that we shall
break no confidence by giving a précis:–
PREAMBLE –Whereas it is expedient that means should be adopted
for the earlier shutting-up of certain º: orators, and for
affording relief to the reporters and readers of debates, and facilitating
the progressive course of useful legislation:
ENACTMENT-Be it, therefore Enacted, that within five minutes
from the passing of this. Act, and thenceforth throughout this, and
every succeeding session, it shall not be lawful for any Member, either
of the House of Lords or Commons, to get up to speak when he has
nothing to say, and according to precedent, would occupy an hour or
two or three in saying it. Nor shall it be lawful for any rising bar-
rister to rise more than sixteen times in any ºf or to speak for
the mere sake of hearing himself speak, or to hold a brief from the
Government to talk against time, or otherwise to exercise his voice in
Parliament for professional or personally advertising purposes. And
the Speaker hereby is directed to call to order any Member who may
break these rules, and, generally, to cut short any speech in which at
least half a grain of sense be not discernible in the hearing, however it
be capable of polish in the papers.
PENALTY-Any Member who may be convicted of any of the above
offences shall, on the first, receive formal warning, and on the second
be banished to BELLAMY's for the remainder of the sitting: a ticket-
#. being granted him to return to vote in the event of a
Vision.
CoMPENSATION.—In cases where extenuating circumstances can be
reasonably pleaded, as for example, where the offender is a Scottish
Grievance champion, or a Ma nooth Monomaniac, the House shall be
at liberty to sanction that he be allowed the compensation of a private
room and a reporter, to whom he may address the remainder of his
speech, and, if his family give permission, have it printed in extenso (at
his own expense, of course). But to prevent the House from getting
into public disrepute, two responsible sureties shall in each such case
be found, as guarantees that the printing shall be done “for private
circulation only,” and that no attempt shall afterwards be made to
et the speech inserted in any of the newspapers, even by paying for
the cost of its advertisement.
THE NEW ORACLE.—That which speaks from the tripod—of which
the three legs are DISRAELI, GLADstone, and Cobden.
THE GENERAL ELECTION SONG.
(To the Air of the Bugle-Song in ‘The Princess.')
BILLS great and small, on each dead wall,
With hustings, pledges—old in story !
The long purse shakes, the voter wakes,
And the green candidate’s in his glory.
Go, members, go-set the loose shiners flying;
Go, members; exit session, dying, dying, dying.
Oh, hark! oh, hear!. There’s gin and beer,
In boroughs, counties, freely flowing;
Oh, sweet and far, from º bar,
Each his own trumpet’s blandly blowing.
Go-let us hear the country's voice replying—
Go, members—wind up, session, dying, dying, dying.
Yes, sessions die, nor say “good bye: ”
Yet men will still for seats endeavour;
To reach that goal will poll and poll,
And spend for ever and for ever.
Go, members, go–set the loose shiners flying;
And exit, session, exit—dying, dying, dying.
THE TEMPTATION OF A WERY BAD JOKE.
The Newspapers give a curious account of a miserly old woman,
whose tattered dress was fastened up with between 2000 and 3000
pins, and #." under whose pillow forty sovereigns were found at her
àeath." W e hope the benevolent reader will excuse us, if for once we
cannot resist the temptation of saying a bad thing, with the full
knowledge that it is extremely bad. Well, it is more than we can
Fº help to avoid remarking that the habits of that eccentric old
ady, as above detailed, § give us another melancholy verification of
the homely precept, “Take, care of the pins, and the pounds will
take care of themselves.” There, we have said it, and are now duly
penitent for the enormity of our offence.
The Premier and the Palate.
THE celebrity of the noble PREMIER has occasioned his name to be
taken for the denomination of a new condiment, advertised as the
“PALMERSTON SAUCE,” suitable “for fish, flesh, fowl, &c. &c.” This
is a sphere of fitness about as extensive as can well be imagined; for a
relish which is good not only for fish, flesh, and fowl, but also for “&c.
&c.,” must be equal in universality to salt, and superior to pepper. It
must be adapted to all manner of thin º apples and a few others.
MR. Cobden and MR. DISRAELI should try PALMERsroN's Sauce, and
not have the presumption to offer him any more of their own.
The Nemesis of the Coalitions
RARELY has justice followed so closely on the track of crime.
Scarcely is the Ministry turned out than SpoonER rises to announce
his intention of bringing forward in this year, if he is re-elected,
the Maynooth Grant ' There, we think the #. and the Peelites
have caught it nicely with a vengeance! ... However, they have brought
the punishment down upon their own guilty heads, and we do not pity
them one fourpenny bit. They must abide now by the frightful con.
sequences, though you may be sure the traitors little expected so severe
a retribution. §º is avenged!
POLITICAL PERSONALITY.
THE noble Lord, the present Member for London—as MR. DuN-
combe would say—is understood to be particularly disgusted with the
PREMIER for in: MR. Cobden's majority against the Government a
fortuitous concourse of atoms.
PROTECTION RUN MAD.
THE cry of “Protection to British Industry” being no longer pºs:
sible, the DERby ITEs and DisrAELITEs will “go to the country” with
the cry of “Protection to Chinese Insolence.”
A QUESTION.—On the re-election of any of the Chinese members,
will they be required to take the usual form of oath, or like their
brethren at Canton, will they merely break a saucer?
IMPORTANT TRUISM.–Depend upon it that every advocate of a
Maine Law drinks like a fish.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARcm 21, 1857.
STRONG CHINESE LANGUAGE.
WHEN peace shall have been re-established with China, it will be worth the while of an
enterprising manager to engage a Mandarin or Governor of the flowery land, to write
burlesques for translation and representation at his theatre. What is there in Bombastes
Furioso to beat this?
“Let every inhabitant of China who shall meet an Englishman inflict on him the fate he merits. Already do
our innumerable fleets and mighty armies, which are dreaded by the whole world, advance to drive them
away. Let everybody unite with that army—let every one take part in the war, and teach foreigners to
tremble before the will and before the anger of our Sovereign, whose gaze is as burning as the rays of the sun,
and whose power is immeasurable. - -
“He who shall not act in conformity with these orders shall be considered a traitor, and may expect
from us a chastisement as prompt as terrible.
“You hear ! Obey.
“Done at Whampoa, the 9th day of the 12th Moon."
The Moon, indeed, under whose influence MR. To HYN-Too *
proclamation, must, one would think, have been exactly at the just then. The state of
the Chinese mind, évinced by such ravings as the above, is further perhaps indicated by
the fashion of keeping the head shaved, for which the natives of China are remarkable.
However, these outpourings of frenzy would tell admirably in a mock tragedy, or the
introduction to a pantomime. A great point might be made of the gaze, of the Emperor,
asserted by TchyN-Too to be burning as the rays of the sun. An Englishman might be
represented as lighting his cigar from the Imperial countenance by means of a convex
lens, and of course having summarily inflicted upon him the fate he merited by taking
that liberty—immediate decapitation.

RAMPANT ANGLO-RUSSIANISM.
AMONG the curiosities of literature which have been added recently to those which the
elder D'IsrAELI found and made a note of, we see a work has just been published called
England and Russia Natural Allies, which, as its title page might lead one to suppose,
contains so many statements of a jocular description, that we feel inclined almost to offer to
the writer an engagement for some permanence upon our literary staff. As a sample of the
way in which he outjokes Joseph MILLER, we extract the following:—
“It is a wise policy of the Russian Government, not to promote the increase of the middle class beyond
certain limits, which would endanger the present happy state of the country, and undermine the basis of her
wealth, power and greatness, namely, the servitude of the peasantry.”
That one may properly appreciate the exquisite facetiousness of thus speaking of the
cº Hº! happy state of the country,” one, need but read the revelations about Russia Felix
which are being published now in Household hords;, the evidence there given as to the feli-
cities enjoyed * ..." subjects, being in corroboration of the many, statements to the
same effect which other travellers have made us. But sparkling as it is, the joke is quite
eclipsed by that with which another of the writer's pages is illuminated, where, to prove the
naturalness of an alliance between Englishmen and Russians, he states that Nature has
endowed their aristocracy with such marks of resemblance as clearly indicate that she
intended them to live as one united happy family.
“In their personal appearance the flower, both of the English and Russian aristocracy, present the
virulent sensualism of the ox, beautified by all the graces of humanity.”
The humour of this notion is not a little heightened by its metaphorical confusion—the
assertion being made that in the “flower” of the nations there may be discerned a purely
animal resemblance. There might perhaps be some propriety in finding in John BULL some
traces of the ox, but the only way in which we could discover any bovine features in the
flower of our aristocracy would be to find that some of them had ox:lips. We do not think
however that the tracing of a likeness between them and the Russians can be accepted as a
compliment to the lords of our creation, even
though, to mollify the statement, it be said that
they alike are “beautified by ail the graces of
humanity.” Indeed we are quite of opinion that
John BULL would trample most indignantly on
any flowers of speech by which his name might
stand in danger of being altered to JoHN BULLo-
WITCH.
A PASSING TOLL.
ToIL for the gravel
M.P.'s that are no more |
All sunk, the “tips” they gave,
Wiped out, each ale-house score!
Six hundred looking grave,
And sixty-four beside
Who for the Public weal,
May never more divide.
John BowRING raised the cloud,
And PAM was overset,
Down went the Commons House,
Each to contest his seat
Toll for the bravel
Brave SHAw LEFEVRE's gone;
His last might's work is wrought,
His last division done.
Throughout six sessions' battles,
Serene he eyed the clock;
He played no factious trick,
Ran on no party rock.
All join to weave his wreath,
join his praise to pen,
Now §º LEFEVRE's gone,
May we find his like again!
The election-writs fill up,
PAM to the country goes'
Let’s pledge him in the cup
Of tea brewed by his foes.
His credit yet is sound,
And he will rule again,
Though angry GLADstone thunder,
And Dizzy sneer and strain;
But SHAw LEFEVRE's gone,
His speakership is o'er;
And he, and this six hundred
And fifty, sit no more
NUTS AND WINE.
AN advertisement offers the British Public
NADULTERATED WINES.—The “Nutty
Sherry, 36s. Cash.
The nutty sherry may be a very pleasant
º but what is a nutty sherry? É. any
sort of sherry be prepared from Španish nuts?
For our own drinking we should prefer a wine of
the same nature as that which Iago represents
Desdemona as accustomed to imbibe. That
worthy, in reference to the young lady in ques-
tion, reminds his friend Roderigo that “the wine
she drinks, is made of grapes.” We would
rather drink a grape wine than a nutty wine.
Nevertheless, we have no objection to nuts, in
combination with wine, upon the understanding
i. we are to eat the former and drink the
atter.
Coffee-House Characteristics.
LET an Englishman and a Frenchman enter
a coffee-house at the same time; the former will
walk up to the fire-place, and the latter will stop
at the first mirror. The Englishman lifts up his
coat-tails, and warms his huge body, whilst the
Frenchman, with equal warmth, sunshi in
the looking-glass.
THE CHINESE Division.—We would sooner
have been with PAIMERSTON on the Canton
Minority than have been, like GLADSTONE, one
of the Cantin' Majority!

DERBY’S THREE SERWING MEN.

WHEN DERBY last on place began
To cast a longing eye,
He entertained three serving men
And all of them were—sly.
The first he was a Jesuit,
The second a Charlatan,
The third he was a Peacemonger,
And all for the DERBY ran.
The Jesuit he loved splitting hairs,
The Charlatan an apt rap;
But the Peacemonger loved downright cant,
Adroitly mixed with clap-trap.
The Jesuit’s splitting his hairs in vain,
In vain does the Charlatan rail,
And the Peacemonger hates to be joked on the point,
But—his cant’s uncommonly stale.
S SCOTCH LAW AND SUNDAY.
It is not true that every one of the minor Scotch judges
is a Sabbatarian hypocrite. MR. John MACLAURIN, the
Sheriff Substitute of Argyllshire, has shown himself capable,
in a Sunday case, of pronouncing a judgment unbiassed by
fanaticism. This learned gentleman, according to the
Daily Scotsman, has delivered “an interlocutor and note”
in actions of damages, brought by two Glasgow spirit
dealers, travellers by the Emperor steamer on a Sunday,
against two hotel-keepers in Dunoon, for refusing them
admittance to their hotels on that day, “in consequence,
as the innkeepers stated, of their being ordered by the
- local justices to refuse admittance to all travellers by the
Emperor steamer on Sunday, under pain of losing their
licence.” Mr. MACLAURIN’s sentence awarded the plaintiffs
£l damages and expenses. It now remains for the defend-
ants to É.i. their action against the local justices in
consequence of whose tyrannical menaces º: been
subjected to pecuniary loss, for which, MR. MACLAURIN
- i. ought to be indemnified by those
stupid and sanctimonious fellows.
A LAWYER OUT OF HIS DEPTH.
BLUEBooks about education are ..". º containing
some curious answers to questions concerning biblical matters, on the
part of parochial children. The catechumens return, BARABBAs as an
Apostle, for instance, or, confound. ADAM with ALEXANDER. THE
CoPPERSMITH., An example of, erudition on this class of subjects,
closely º to those afforded by the juveniles in question, was
exhibited the other day in the Appeal Court of Chancery. In the
course of the case, StourTon v. StourTon, according to the Times
report—
“Mr. Badshawe, SEN., in reply, denied that the Roman Catholic Church did not
rmit the unrestricted use of the Word of God in its authorised version; for, on
e contrary, it permitted the reading of such parts of the Old Testament as it con-
sidered fit for perusal, that Church, however, holding that there were parts of the
3. Testament, and therein agreeing with St. PAUL, which were hard to be
understood.”
If the learned gentleman had known what he was talking about, he
would, in the foregoing statement, have been chargeable with robbing
PETER, to §. to PAUL, and not only that, but with charging other
parties on behalf of PAUL, with what PETER had put down to PAUL's
account. . But he must be acquitted of any wilful partiality to PAUL or
injustice to PETER, since it is quite clear that his acquaintance with
them, and with that branch of knowledge which includes such acquaint-
ance, is in inverse ratio to his professional learning. On such a
i. a lºyer may well get out of his depth—perhaps he is out of
element.
Distinction without a Difference.
BRown says he doesn't like too many barristers in Parliament,
Jones avers that he objects to a superabundance of solicitors. And
Robinson philosophically asks, what is the difference between barrister
and solicitor? erely the difference between a crocodile and an
gator.
WOL. XXXII. O
A TROUBLESOME MAJORITY.
WITH all their protestations about having been, compelled to vote
according to their consciences, we doubt much if the members of the
Coalition—we beg pardon, we should say Fortuitous, Concurrence-
would not have somehow smothered those their “still, small voices,”
had they known what a trouble their majority would be to them.
Never was a victory more dearly purchased; in fact, to many of the
conquering heroes, it will prove considerably more harassing than a
defeat. This is clear from the º: tone of their Election
Addresses, and the nervous way in which they seem º; to
frame excuses for their conduct. The oldest and the boldest of them
hardly dare as yet to glory in their triumph; and instead, of being
| of it, the most of them would fain shirk the subject, altogether
and there is scarcely one in twenty who does not seem to be as amed
of it. -
In fact, the Tea-Party just now are in somewhat the position of the
man who held the bottle imp; and, having their .."; they don't
know what on earth to do with it." iike "Frankenstein, they find that
they have made a Monster, which they don't know, how to manage;
and the chances are, we think, that as far as their electioneering pros-
pects are concerned, it will most likely be the death of them.
How Extremes Meet.
THERE is a great difference in the way (we mean, the street) that
different countrymen, when they do differ, fight; If it is an Englishman,
before beginning, he will tuck up his sleeves; but if it is a Frenchman
—mind you notice him well, the next time—he turns up his trousers?
As Paddy would say, the arms of a Frenchman are in his feet.
The PoliticAL Toxophillte.—MR. CoBDEN cannot, perhaps, be
accused of shooting with the . bow; but he has certainly taken a
shot (though he has missed his mark) at the Government with an Arrow.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARch 28, 1857.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ARCH 16. Monday. The young
Eels now begin to ascend the
rivers, and the old eels—the
Parliamentary congers—are
busily wriggling towards the
hustings. ructification of
Beardless Moss takes place,
by a curious coincidence with
the date at which, by order
from the Palace, Crimean
beards fall from the faces of
officers coming to levées. The
Elm also is about to flower,
a happy omen for the pilot
at the 'elm of state. The
Leaves of the Elder should
now open, and if those of
the younger should now shut,
they might hold better books
when Blink Bonny comes
round Tattenham Corner.
Such are the signs of the
times. Another sign, was a
diverting address, delivered
this evening by the EARL of
DERBY (in performance of
his threat) upon the subject
of the Dissolution. It was
really a very amusing speech, and the goodnatured abuse of LoRD
PALMERSTON, which was incessantly thrown, in to, please, LoRD
DERBY’s adherents, could not have annoyed the Bottleholder in
the least. The Earl had got over all his anger and wrath, and only
wanted to finish the session with a Shine. His, tone was like that
of a consoling, mother who beats, the wicked floor for hurting
the stupid child that fell down. The only point he made was the
fixing the title of “appendages” upon the colleagues of Lord
PALMERstoN ; and, by implication, upon MR. DISRAELI and the rest of
the DERby tail. LoRD GRANVILLE answered him so smartly, that poor
silly MALMESBURY got into a rage, and talked about the dignity of
debate, which was pretty good, considering that his leader had been
telling all sorts ...} anecdotes, good and bad, and comparing LoRD
PALMERSTON to the little old woman whose petticoats were cut off at
her knee by the wandering pedlar. LoRD HARDWICKE also spoke
rather unwisely, as usual, and was,incensed that after LoRD, DERBy
had declared that there was no Coalition between himself and the other
China men, anybody, should dare to think that the atoms had not come
together in the lobby quite fortuitously. On the whole, the grand
Derbyite demonstration helped the evening through pleasantly, and
there were several ladies present.
A good many of the Commons went to, the Lords to have a laugh,
The others did next to nothing beyond advancing the Mutiny bills, and
went away very early.
Tuesday. Some of the Lords pelted each other with interpellations
about, the Chinese affair, rather, apparently, for the sake of saying
something, and keeping the House together for an hour or so, than
because anybody wanted to know anything. Aimless questions re-
ceived pointless answers, some bills were advanced, and then came a
little more Chinese snarling, especially by Mandarin GREY, and then
an adjournment, at half-past six.
The Commons had risen an hour earlier, having had from SIR. G. C.
Lewis an explanation of the treaties with Denmark as to the Sound
dues, the point of which, so far as English people are, concerned, is,
that the Sound is to be opened on the first .." April, and compensation
is to be paid to Denmark in three months from the passing an act for
the purpose. The ATToRNEY-GENERAL expressed his regret that the
dissolution would prevent his introducing a bill for punishing the de-
linquents in the case of the British Bank, a regret which MR. HUM-
PHREY BROWN, MR. John MACGREGOR, and some other gentlemen
must equally share., M.R. DISRAELI inquired whether LoRp PALMER-
ston, at the time the demonstration . Naples had been made,
had offered to France that England should suppress any republican
movement in Italy. . Of course LoRD PALMERsroN was ... by
the virtue of words, to answer in the negative; but some people say
that the EMPERQR QF THE FRENCH made it a stipulation that the
#. BOMBA should not involve the kicking over the sulphurous
One.
Mednesday. The Lords sat on a day they seldom honour so far.
They rattled through, fourteen bills in half-an-hour, but only one of
them will, in all probability ever be heard of by the world at large, and
that only º its results, the Enfranchisement of Ninepence Act, which
was passed.
In the Commons, MR, SHAw LEFEVRE expressed his thanks for his
pension, to which iſr. Punch is most happy to assure him that he is
most heartily welcome. The Government proposes to abolish the Irish
tax called Minister's Money (a sort of church rate), and, to pay the
amount out of the Ecclesiastical Commission Fund, a highly objection-
able course, inasmuch as it withdraws another grievance from the
repertoire of Hibernian patriots. SIR. B. HALL demands a little more
time for finishing the Pimlico Improvements, and as this Chief Com-
missioner of Works and Buildings is attending to all his business in a
practical, non-redtapey, English gentlemanly manner, he may most
#. be left to º: it his own way. SIR BENJAMIN should
ave included, in his new bill, a clause enabling him to put down the
street Yelling in Pimlico, as until this is done, no person with ordinary
nerves will remain there longer than he is compelled by the lease he
took when unaware of that hideous nuisance.
Thursday. The Lords'sitting was devoted to a pleasant discussion upon
and Nature, the former as illustrated in the paintings of TURNER,
and the latter in the conduct of the Chancery lawyers, who have at
once insulted the 1. and defrauded the public. LoRD ST.
LEONARDs raised the question, and talked about aerial effects and
purity of colour, in a way people would hardly have expected from the
author of SUGDEN On Powers. He also showed up the whole technical
history of the cases, and being about the first Chancery lawyer in the
kingdom, his statement carried a weight which would not attach to
the pleading of any of the place-hunting barristers who get up grievances
in the Commons in order to make speeches. There is this to be said,
however, namely, that TURNER's natural repugnance to an attorne
carried him too far. He should have let a lawyer prepare his will. It
is necessary to employ this kind of instrument sometimes. A cork-
screw is an ugly and a sneaking instrument, but a sensible practical
man will use it to draw a cork, and—but the application of the illus-
tration is evident. LoRD LANSDownB pointed this out, and added
that he thought the best had been done, under the circumstances, and
that Government intended to carry out TURNER's wishes as far as
possible. The Commons abstained from meeting to-day and on Friday,
and most of them remained at home, cooking up election speeches.
Friday. LoRD, CRAN worTH, availed himself of one more opportunity
of showing his helplessness, by a speech, to prove that there was no
means of preventing the indiscriminate sale of poisons. LoRD ELLEN-
Borough delivered a long attack upon the Government, which LoRD
PALMERSTON answered, a little later, at the LoRD MAyor's dinner-
table. As this post-prandial address was part of the political business
of the session, Mr. Punch will mention that, PALMERSTON spoke out
manfully, vindicated those who have stood by the British, Flag in
China, declared that the country was with him, that he was for peace
in combination with honour, but that if peace was wanted by means o
humiliation and degradation, the country must look for other men
than himself to govern it. Mr. Punch was in such an ecstasy, of
admiration at this speech that he could not help emptying the Loving
Cup all over the Prussian Ambassador, who sat next him, and to whom
he hereby apologises. In the Lords, EARL GRAN VILLE answered the
Elephant, and i. came to the dinner, and made another smart
speech. The only noticeable thing ELLENBoRough uttered was his
quotation of a quotation by LoRD WELLESLEy, touching a radical,
who, he said, in Tartara tendit, language which one might expect
from a drunken coal-heaver, but in which a statesman should scarcely
indicate the post-mortem lot of a political antagonist.
Saturday. The Houses met for the last time. The Lords were per-
fectly calm, inasmuch as our inestimable constitution renders a Lord
independent of Queens, or hustings, or any other expulsive power,
save that of the Grim Serjeant who arrested the Prince of Denmark.
Many of the Commons, however, entertained, or were entertained by
feelings of a very different description, and the clash of the Gates
of the Happy Vºl. behind Prince Raseias was a cheerful sound
compared to that which many of our representatives must have
heard in the sentences read by LoRD, CRANworth. He had not much
to say, beyond stating that the dissolution was to be immediate, that
the QUEEN was much obliged for the money that had been voted, and
was glad to have reduced the Income-Tax. In HER MAJESTY's prayer
that the constituencies may choose Wise Patriots for the new Parlia-
ment everybody must join; but it will be a considerable step in advance
if the electors will only get rid of a number of Foolish Factionists, a
result which Mr. Punch has done his best to promote. LoRD EveRsley
of Heckfield, previously known as MR. SHAw LEFEVRE, took leave of
the Commons, and, while Mr. Punch writes,<
ENGLAND IS WITHOUT A PARLIAMENT,
TAR AND FEATHERS.
THERE was, according to the fable, a certain Jackdaw, who once
upon a time decorated himself with peacock's feathers. The EMPEROR
of CHINA will perhaps confer the same decoration—the Chinese badge
9ſ merit—on certain talkative members of the Houses of Parliament.
If, his Imperial Majesty will supply the feathers, the British public
will find the necessary tar.

that ": open and close the doors with the most preternatural quietness,
which adds to the imposingly historical effect of the performance. The

DESTRUCTION OF LIFE IN CHINA.
A CHINESE baker, prophetically named ALLUM, poisoned the bread
served out to the foreigners at Hong-Kong. Ratsbane was kneaded
in the morning roll, and the cruel Gover Nort, Bow RING, very much to
his own astonishment, discovered that he really had bowels. However,
though there was great consternation, much suffering, death did not
ensue. All who had eaten of the bread, though much enfeebled,
recovered. We have said that—no death ensued.
And now mark the ruthless spirit of revenge operating in the coun-
cils of a British Governmentſ Of a Christian people! ALLUM, the
baker, with three accomplices, were seized, and though it is very pro-
bable that each of the poor men had a wife, or wives; a family, or
families—for every, Chinaman, has-nevertheless the four men were
condemned to death and shot! The poor creatures, altogether igno-
rant of our laws, irresponsible, as we contend by their very ingenuous-
ness, to a British tribunal, are taken, out and shot: we will not at
present use stronger language, but will simply say—shot!.
Can we expect that, as a people, any future blessings will fall upon
the Royal Marines; a respectable force enough in their way, but when
converted into agents of death, and their victims, the simple Chinese-
the descendants of ſº who used gunpowder when our Druidi-
cal forefathers could only obtain light by the attrition of dried sticks
—when perverted, we will say, into ministers of vengeance,—made a
blot, and not a credit to us as a nation?
#owever, it is very refreshing to learn, that there are some com-
Fº spirits who lament the fate of the fallen. A subscription
as, therefore, been entered into to erect a fitting monument at Hong-
Kong to the unfortunate ALLUM and his hapless, companions.
suitable inscription has been promised by a distinguished bishop in the
very oiliest English. - -
It is expected that the Chinese Members of both Houses of Parlia-
ment will appear in short mourning. e know it may be cavilled,
that ALLUM and his companions intended to commit wholesale
murder. But to this we make answer, ought not all men to be judged
according to their lights? Was it given to these poor men to separate
}. *ties of a GLADSTONE, or to read the leaders of the Morning
era.
THE ALDERMAN'S OWN BOOK.
. A Book has been largely advertised of late, under the interesting
title of Corpulency, professing to give directions for the self-cure
of that deformity, by means of a peculiar system of diet. We pre-
sume that the peculiarity of this dietetic system consists in affording
satisfaction to the cravings, and at the same time effecting a diminu-
tion of the protuberance, of the stomach. The method of reducing
corpulence by eating and drinking very much less than the appetite
desires, has long been known to almost everybody, but, on account of
its unpleasantness is practised by hardly anybody. That *. in the
book in question must have the recommendation of rendering self-cure
practicable without self-denial. Probably the volume sells largely; but
not much over the counter. Its sale, doubtless, takes place chiefly by
ost, the price being transmitted and received inº stamps.

tapping his stomach and simply saying, “MooRE's book; ” since the

with the Irish Melodies. To pretend to make that mistake, however,
could the pretence be supported with sufficient, gravity, would be a
very politic artifice on the part of the bibliopole who might be desirous
of seeing his flattered customer again.

THE LIKES OF LORD DERBY.
THE Noble Lord the EARL OF DERBY has, like many other person-
ages connected with the turf, more than one name. He is called the
“Hotspur of Debate,” and the “RUPERT of Debate.” Neither alias
is at all suitable to his Lordship. The original Hotspur had an impedi-
ment in his speech. Lady Percy, speaking of her deceased husband, says:
“And speaking thick, which Nature made his blemish,
me the accents of the valiant.”
The Hotspur of Debate, therefore, would be an orator who spoke
“without proper intervals of articulation,” as DR. Johnson defines the
word “thick” in the passage above quoted from SHAKsPEARE. LoRD !
DERBY is remarkable for fluency, not for stuttering and stammering.
There is no more analogy between PRINCE RUPERT the leader of the
Cavaliers, and EARL DERBY, the leader of the Opposition, than
there is between the noble Earl and the TIPTON SLAsHER. RUPERT's
chivalry was chivalrous in the high sense of the word; DERby's is
simply an etymological chivalry, a chivalry of the mere cheval—of the
horse horsy, or ossy in the language of the stable-minded. The
CHIFFNEY of Debate would be an appropriate denomination for the
turfite Peer, were it not that his Lordship is not often the winner of
the political sweepstakes; and perhaps, after all, the most correct
title that could be added to his hereditary one would be “The John
GILPIN of Debate;” for the eloquence of the noble lord is apt to run
away with him.
The Triple Alliance.
CoNSIDERING the §§ principles of DISRAELI, GLADSTONE,
and CoBDEN, it must be difficult to find a name elastic enough to cover
this very expºnsive part when they go to the country. We beg to offer
them one—“The Small Tea Party.”
[Youth accepts the generous offer, and lounges out with a Giant Regalia as big as his leg in his mouth.
THE PRINCESS ROYAL AT WESTMINSTER.
THIS is too bad. Why mix tender affairs of the heart with the
unreasoning brawl of the hustings? We protest against any suc
amalgamation. Therefore, why, in Westminster, did MR. STUART, an
elector, “want to know if GENERAL Evans would allow £70,000 to be
voted on the marriage of the PRINCEss Roy ALP” To this question
the gallant General made the following uſ." reply—“he would
not lend a hand to anything of the sort.” Poor little princess! it is
rather too bad that the marriage º should be thus mingled
with the turnip-tops of Covent-Garden; nevertheless, we cannot but
express a fear that the marriage-portion of the PRINCEss, Roy AL,
ess it be pitched º very low, will be º handled by a
new Parliament. We have heard of pigs among the roses; and can
only hope that the rough radicals will treat with tenderness the
hymeneal wreath of the little PRINCEss Roy AL. It is at present
reported in Lambeth that, should MR. W. WILLIAMs be returned, it
is º intention to move, as an amendment, an income of £500 a-year to

“A Good Cry."
...ONE has heard of Niobe, and one has also heard modern Niobes
(in Crinoline) assert that they “have cried all night,” and one has
hard-hear attached similar credit to the classic and to the modern
fiction. But the following extract from a London paper, of last week,
roves that crime, at least, is sometimes marvellously penitent. A
onger flux of tears than is here recorded has seldom taken place. At
the close of a Police case, it is said—
“MR. INGHAM completely exonerated the pawnbroker from blame, and remanded
the prisoner, who cried bitterly, for a week.”

THE BOMBARDIER OF WINDSOR.
FEw of our readers, perhaps, are aware of the warlike character of
the Corporation of Windsor.”that civic body has quite the military
cast of a mediaeval municipality. The peaceful gown may constitute
the habitual attire of its members, but can, on occasion, be exchanged
for the arms and accoutrements of war by these stout burghers. They
have in their pay an artillery corps, and, according to a contemporary,
last week, on the birthday of HER Royal HIGHNESs The PRINCEss
Louisa, after the customary bell-ringing,
“At noon a royal salute was fired from the corporation ordnance, by the town
bombardier, in Bachelor's Acre.”
A fine subject for a picture in the old Flemish style, one fancies,
would be afforded by the Town Bombardier of Windsor. To the eye of
imagination he presents the idea of a man of gigantic height and frame;
an idea suggested by the fact that his sole strength was employed on
the management and firing of the corporation ordnance. We are not
informed that he was assisted by any subordinate artillerymen; and
hence, indeed, we are led to question whether he has any, and whether,
being a host in himself, he does not comprehend in his own person, the
whole artillery corps of Windsor. The office of the Town Bombardier of
Windsor must be, in one sense, a sinecure, for although he is employed
in firing birthday salutes pretty frequently, he has nothing to bombard.
If the Corporation of Windsor could spare their Town Bombardier for
a time, that tremendous artilleryman might be sent out to China, in
order that he might astonish the natives of Canton by bombarding
that town—if there is any of it remaining to be bombarded.
FASHIONABLE RECEIPTS.
HE vocabulary of Flunkeydom has
been lately enriched with a new
$1ang º The reporters of
high jinks in high life have taken
to informing their readers that this
or that lady of quality “received ”
on such and such an evening.
Heretofore, it was customary to
describe the superior classes, as
giving evening or other parties; but
now they are said to receive in exer-
cising hospitality. In fact, giving
a party is giving a receipt. It does
not appear that the party given in
receiving is a new style of thin
being otherwise called by the jà
names of assembly, réunion, and
soirée. Whether a dancing-tea is
denominated a receiving, or recep-
tion we do not know. One would think that an entertainment,
whereof the giver receives, would be somewhat in the way of a
Concert or a ãº: performance, to which visitors got admitted by
tickets or money taken at the doors. This last development in the
flunkeyistic dialect may appear open to some objection as an ill phrase,
for those who continually hear that anybody has been receiving cannot
łºś reminded of the old saying, that the receiver is as bad as
e Lillel.
A Satirical Senior.
ONE of those old gentlemen whose age is supposed to entitle them
to say anything, made the following extremely rude and personal
remark to a young officer in a distinguished regiment about to proceed
to China. “Well, Sir, well; you’re going to Canton, eh, Sir? well, I
can only say, I hope you won't fall into the hands of the Chinamen,
alive or ãº, for if you’re alive, they’ll kill, you, and if you’re dead
or when you’re dead, they’ll eat you. Sir, I believe it’s an undoubted
fact that the Chinese eat puppies.”
SICK COWS OF LONDON.
THE Lancet tells us that an epidemic rages ºff, the cows of
London. A non-medical opinion inclines to consider the disease the
dropsy, contracted by the cows from an immoderate use of the pump.
We learn, with great gratification, that the EARL OF DERBY, with
that earnest feeling for religion and the well-being of the Church of
England that has ever characterised him, has refused to allow any of
his lordship's horses to be entered for any Steeple-chase in which the
Church, used as a post, is not in the hands of a clergyman of sound
principles.-Standard.
NEWS OF THE EASELS.
(From the Observer.)
The approaching Exhibition of the Royal AcADEMY promises to be
an º good one. Among, other characteristics which it will
}. is the general novelty of the subjects, treated by the artists.
tead of having recourse, as hitherto, to themes which have been
worked threadbare, by hundreds of preceding, painters, we are
qelighted to learn that many of the intending exhibitors have looked
for themselves into English and other literature, and have selected
entirely fresh topics for illustration. MR. STUggs, we hear, has em.
ployed his masterly, pencil in delineating a scene from an old but
admirable H. of the time of CHARLEs THE SEcond, in which the
birth and fall of our first P. are graphically described. A graceful
little novel, by a friend of the celebrated DR. Johnson, comprising the
adventures of an amiable country clergyman and his interesting family,
supplies to MR. BUMBLEDRQr an incident (we, think a simple youth's
sisters attiring him for a fair) which will º display his
artistic powers, while MR. BLOGGBY, constant to the noble traditions
of his country, has lighted upon a grand yet touching episode in our
early, history, when, according to writers, of authority, the mortal
remains of the Sovereign who died in the fatal combat which gave the
throne to the ambitious Norman Conqueror, were discovered upon the
battle field, by a female prompted to the search by the gentlest of
sentiments. A poem of the last century, detailing the vicissitudes of the
seasons, supplies MR. WEEBLE with a charming subject—a young lady,
athing, receives a letter from her lover, stating that he is on the look
out to prevent her being disturbed, and she writes in reply, expressing
her gratitude; a happy idea, full of delicacy, at least in the estimation
of our grandmothers. An original anecdote from early English history
has been brought to light by MR. LATHERDABBER, who represents
the celebrated monarch #. whom we were delivered from Danish sway
º or rather neglecting, humble culinary duty in the
cottage of an Eatherd (or º whose wife had given him shelter.
Nor has foreign literature been a sealed book to the artists, and while
the romantic annals of Spain have been ransacked to º to
MR. WoFUs the figures of an enthusiastic and chivalrous ht-
errant who mistook a windmill for a giant, and of his LABLACHE-like
squire, a quaint and singular compound of knavery and simplicity,
the satiric drama of our lively neighbours (the French) has fur.
nished MR. PoGRAM with the idea of a ludicrous tradesman, who
attempts to acquire º and is astonished to find that he
has been speaking prose all his life without knowing it. The reproach,
unjustly cast upon our artists, that they are unacquainted with the
classical writings will this year be triumphantly met, for both HoMER and
VIRGIL afford subjects to painters, the Scian bard having suggested to
MR. MADGEowLET the childish fear of the youthful ANTINous at the
helmet and plumes of his father AcHILLEs, when the latter takes leave
of his consort HELEN ; and the Mantuan swan having afforded to MR.
DE STORTER, the opportunity of delineating the Carthaginian Queen
listening to the recitals of the hero of Troy. We must not omit to
add, that the too much neglected drama of our own country has been
ransacked, not without success, by MR; BIDDYBOY and MR. Bonassus
and that the former has made choice of a most interesting, yet withai
most difficult, subject from the works of the Swan of Avon, where an
ed but petulant monarch is driven out of doors by his ungrateful
offspring, while the other has nobly advocated the cause of Qur ºf.
Jewish fellow-subjects by a masterly delineation of an Italian Hebrew,
who is giving admirable counsel to an unthrifty daughter. We look
}...; therefore, with great interest to the opening of an exhibition
where not only the pictorial talent, but the gallant ventures of our
artists in fresh fields and pastures new are to be judged, but we have
no fear for the result—Spero meliora.
Five Heads to One Unmanageable Body.
WE think the principal insurgents who have headed the Chinese
Revolution (at home) will not, for any vº great length of time, agree
amongst themselves. You will see, that GLADstoNE, RUSSEIL,
Roßlºck, DisRAELI, and CoBDEN, will soon be quarrelling as to who
shall be “first-chop.”
oRANGEMEN OF THE OPPOSITION.
THERE were always a certain, number of Orangemen in LoRD
DERby's party, but they were Irish Orangemen. They are now to be
looked upon in the light of China-Orangemen.
YANKEE NOTION OF ALLUM.
It is the decided opinion of all the American residents at Hong
Kong, that MR; ALLUM, the baker, who poisoned the bread, is, or was
before he was shot, the greatest loafer in existence.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARch 28, 1857,
A PILL FOR THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.
PUNCH. — ANOTHER Medi-
cal Bill is about to be
brought into the House of
Commons y MR. HEADLAM
—having, of course, for its
principal objects, the sup:
pression of quackery, an
the protection of the public
from unqualified, practi.
tioners. If it is likely to
answer these purposes, I
hope you will request LoRD
PALMERSTON to º it.
The consequence will be that
the sale of patent medicines
will be prohibited, and drug-
gists prevented from prac-
tising across the counter;
Nº. Medical Bill that
does not ensure the prohi-
bition of patent medicine-
vending, and the prevention
of druggists’ counter-prac-
tice, will have the effect of
protecting, against charla-
tans and unqualified prac:
titioners, the health and
pockets of the superior and educated classes only-who are able to
protect themselves. It will still leave the poor and ignorant to pre:
scribe quack remedies for their own complaints, in equalignorance of
the nature of the former and of the latter, or to get themselves
hysicked by anybody who may have set up a druggist's shop and may
É. no more ; medicine than his pestle does. .
“A secondary object of the Bill, I presume, will be the advantage of
the Medical Profession itself. To this end, no doubt, it will cºntain a
registration clause, whereby a fee of a certain amount will be fixed for
registration. Now, the amount of this fee must be proportioned to
the amount of good which º, be expected from jº by the
poor doctors on whom it is to be imposed. Appraised by that rule, it
would come to about one shilling. If more than that is demanded, I
trust that you will use your influence with the PREMIER to get the
bill, or at least, the clause of it in question, rejected. In a former Bill
it was proposed to fine every existing practitioner ten pounds for
registration, otherwise, for permission to pursue the *. of that
profession which has already cost all who have entered it so much, and
remunerated most of them so little. If we are all to be fined at that
rate, or anything like it, I know a professional gentleman, who, will
have to . histortoise, his alligator stuffed, and all his other skins,
whether of fishes, reptiles, or mammalia; whose beggarly account of
empty boxes will then be more beggarly than ever, and whº will be
placed under circumstances of the strongest temptation to sell strych-
nine, arsenic, and prussic acid on the sly without asking questions.
That professional gentleman, Sir, is
“Your humble Servant,
“GALEN BONEs,”
“M.R.C.S. L.A.C.”
“P.S. After all, Sir, would it not, perhaps, be as well if the Medical
Profession were left to take care º itself, and if, as in most other
matters of competition, we were simply to go the whole hog of Free
Trade in physic?”
About the Size of It.
DEPRECATING with much vehemence the charge of factious Coalition,
MR. CoBDEN's Small Tea-Party appear resigned to hear their com-
bination talked of as a “Concourse of Atoms; ” and considering the
smallness of the good which, it has done them, we think that their
majority may be É. viewed as an atomic one.
SOME CONSOLATION AT LEAST.
. The Government, with the high sense of liberality that usually dis-
tinguishes its patronage of the Fine Arts, declines to purchase the
“SouLAGE Collection.” Never mind; let us console ourselyes with
. Nºrtsºn Fund,” for, after all, that is the real “Soulage
Collection.
The FIELD of LITERATURE.-Of all fields the Field of Literature
is the one that has the greatest number of Styles to it.
A FAIR BUTT FoE RIDICULE.—An old woman in hoops.
MARY ANN’S NOTIONS.
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I shall, write you an exceedingly short letter to-day,
because I know that at this moment there is no getting any of you to
attend to anything except your politics, but when you are a little sober
after your electioneering excitement, I shall have a good deal to say
upon several things.
“But I cannot restrain myself from saying a few words about some:
thing which I have read this week, and which is much too sad and
grave a thing to be made fun of, and indeed fshould not write to you
about it at all, only I know that you very often mean seriousness when
you talk levity. I mean that poor dear heroic woman who died in the
fire on Tuesday. Talk of soldiers, yes, I allow that they do very
gallant things, and I have seen men's cheeks flush, and their eyes
sparkle, when they have been reading out aloud of some brave charge
or rush into a breach. But then consider. They are drilled and trained
to the work, they are led on by officers whom they trust, they have
music that stirs them up to maddening pitch, and they have honour
and glory before them—and above all, they are Men. But here was a
oor woman, a young mother with a baby, her husband far away, her
ouse in the middle of the night is wrapped in flames, and that poor
thing, springing from her bed, and in .# the terror and agony of the
hour, does something which to my mind is more heroic than the bravest
deed that a soldier ever performed since men began to murder one
another. I would rather copy the description out of the paper than
trust myself to write it. The poor thing was the second wife of a per-
son named RAYNER, he is a commercial traveller, and she was doing
business as a milliner near Čamberweiſgate. He had four children by
the first wife, the eldest only eleven, and then two more, and then a
oor little thing of three, and this wife became the mother to them,
and I am sure a good one) and had also a little baby of her own.
Late at might a boy discovers the fire, and now I come to what I have
written out from the newspaper:—
“He immediately gave the alarm to the female servants, two in number, as
to his mistress, who, in a frantic state, seized upon her own child, an infant in arms,
and called upon the servants to save her child while she ran up-stairs to fetch the
other children. The servants in their terror took the infant and escaped, leaving
the door open; this caused the fire ºf. from the shop to the passage, and to
run up the staircase, thus cutting off all retreat."
“I cannot bear to write out the rest, they heard all the five poor
creatures crying and screaming, but nobody could help them, and no
engines came until all was over. We won't speak of that, but tell me
whether the !. Step-mother, just providing for the safety of her
own baby, and no more, and then rushing into the flames to rescue her
husband's children was not a noble thing.
“If a man had done such a deed we should have had a world of
praise of his ºf and devotion, and a memorial would have been
erected to him, and his children provided for. But this poor brave
thing was only a woman, and I suppose only doing her duty, and no-
body will even ask what has become of the poor baby who was saved.
“Go on with your elections, and canting, and bribery. Who cares
to hear about a martyr woman?

RELIGION IN A PLAY-BILL.
MR. CHARLEs, KEAN puts forth a most lovely composition in his
Richard II. play-bill. Ere the curtain rises, it so fixes the attention
of even the pit and gallery, that not a nut is cracked, not an apple
bitten. Among other revelations of the bill is the subjoined:–
“John WickLIFFF, “the morning star of the Reformation,” made himself heard
amidst the angry roar of contending passions; and in the hearts of fiery and seditious
men sowed the seed, which, after a growth of one hundred and fifty years, was
destined to expand into the STANDARD Religion of our Country.”
Even the bench of bishops will be glad to find themselves fortified
by the opinion of MR. CHARLEs KFAN. Comforting is it to know, on
playhouse authority, that, the established religion is the “standard”
religion, like standard gold, carrying the Divine Hall-mark to be seen
through the spectacles of a manager. Nevertheless, this opinion bears
a little hard upon certain folks for whom, it might be expected, there
would be some, professional sympathy. ...For if the “standard”
religionists are the chosen, what—we º MR. KEAN, as an actor and
a man—what is to become of the “ranters?”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RUSKIN AT THE FEET OF SPURGEON.
HE. Morning . Advertiser of
late has become greatly
addicted to controversial
points of religion. Though
ºf through the
Bunch of Grapes, and all
sorts of Lions ed, White,
ck, and Blue, the 'Tiser,
though given to the pub-
licans, is always ready to
attack the Pharisees. And
why not? As BYRON says—
“There's nought, no doubt, so
much the spirit calms,
As rum and true religion.”
Porter and polemics make
very strengthening half-and-
half. Therefore, the 'Tiser
is the affectionate advocate
of MR. SPURGEoN, and
crowning triumph, faithfully
** records the visits of Judges
§ and ex-Ministers to the Hall
of the Surrey Gardens.
LORD JoHN is found amon
the congregation: an
straightway MR. SPURGEON
throws him, like a head
of spikenard, a compliment, _an acknowledgment. MR. RUSKIN
—our authority is still the 'Tiser—“sent a cheque, after hearin
him preach, for 100 guineas to MR. SPURGEON, towards the fun
for building a new place of worship.” If this be true, why does
not MR. Ruskin enhance, beyond all price, his money-gift, by adding
thereto a plan for the new edifice? MR. Ruskis has written in his
own eloquent way upon, “Sheep-Pens.” Why not be the architect of
a sheep-cot for the shepherd of our time? To be sure, Ruskis and
CALVIN are a little at odds, but no man like the author of The Stones
of Kenice can draw so much concord out of a paradox. Under the
genius of MR. Ruskin, the square, cold lead-lined tank of CALVIN
would become as vast, as multitudinous, and as phosphorescent as a
tropic ocean.
GOVERNMENT LAWYERS ON SMUGGLED OPIUM.
“THE President of the Council presents his compliments to Mr. Punch,
and requests that gentleman to give as early publication as may suit
him to the following. Opinions of the Law Qfficers of the Crown,
obtained upon the jº of the Opium Trade, in compliance with the
promise of the Government to LoRD SHAFTESBURY.
“Bruton Street, March 24.”
From the Attorney-General.
“I have perused LoRD SHAFTESBURY's speech, and the treaties to
which his º was pleased to refer. It appears to me, with all
deference to the distinguished nobleman in question, that he is utterly
unacquainted with the facts of the case, and entirely incapable, had he
een reasonably familiar with them, of forming a ſº upon it.
I shall not be expected at an electoral crisis like this to sacrifice any
appreciable period of time to the enlightenment of his incapacity, but
I will simply advance a series of propositions for his information.
1. The acknowledged duty of a Government is to take care that...no
hindrance is interposed to the people's obtaining the necessaries of life.
2. Opium has become a necessary of life to a Chinaman. 3. A
Goyernment failing in its duty ceases to be a Government. 4. A
Chinese Government enacting laws against Opium is therefore no
longer a Government. 5. If there is no Government there can be no
Government laws #. smuggling Opium. , 6. The Indian merchant
who supplies the Chinese opium-smoker, with his favourite stimulant
violates no law. 7. It is to be deplored when intellects of an inferior
calibre apply themselves to considerations of a gravity beyond the
grasp of their organisation. 8. LoRD SHAFTESBURY's intellect is of an
inferior calibre. 9. LoRD SHAFTESBURY had better shut up shop.
“RICHARD BETHELL,
“Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn.”
From the Solicitor-General.
“I have looked at the papers, but the idea of LoRD SHAFTESBURY
bothering about }º at a time when the elections are coming on is
too ridiculous. I get in again, and am not elected SPEAKER, I will
read the documents more attentively. In the mean time it seems to
me that laws opposed to our wants and habits are vicious. For
example, everybody smokes cigars, and yet, in defiance of this fact, the
fools of railway directors stick up notices that you are not to smoke in
their carriages. ...Who thinks that he does wrong in violating such a -
ridiculous order? One “smuggles” one's cigar, of course, in stopping
at stations, because one would not get an unfortunate guard into a
scrape º it clear that he saw a breach of the foolish rules, but
nobody the least compunction, in smoking, or, enabling others to
smoke. The same with Opium. There is no harm in Opium, in mode:
ration, and the Chinese will have it; and I should think no more of
giving a Chinese friend a pound of Opium, behind the backs of the
officers, than I should of handing my cigar-case to a friend in a railway:
carriage. I am afraid SHAFTESBURY, though a worthy man, is a bit of
a fidgety milksop.
“J. A. STUART WoRTLEy,
“Twisden Buildings, Temple.”
A BAREBONES PARLIAMENT AGAIN.
WHAT a pretty House of Commons we should have if the body of
ºlºtors were to take the advice impertinently offered to them in the
following advertisement, published by a set of Sabbatarian quacks!
THE APPROACHING ELECTIONS.—The Committee of the Lord's
Day Observance Society urge upon Electors to vote only for those candidates
who will oppose the opening of the British Museum, National Gallery, the Crystal
Palace, and similar institutions, and also the playing of military bands for public
amusement, on the Lord's Day, and who will advocate measures for suppressing
all desecratiºns of that day, which are an open and manifest violation of the com-
mand of God, and involve the employment on the Lord's Day of numbers of our
follow-subjects connected with the Post Office, railway and other travelling, public-
houses, trading, &c.
This puritanical appeal to ignorant fanaticism, is signed by one John
T. BAYi*E, who calls himself “Clerical Secretary,” and who, therefore,
jº. is, or supposes himself to be, a parson of some species.
y the company in which he appears, and the cant which he endorses,
we should judge him to be a species of parson bearing, in one respect,
and, in 9ne only, a certain resemblance to a philosopher. Diogenes
yented his cynicism from a tub, and we º think that BAYLEE, if
he does not preach from the same kind of pulpit, is more fit to preach
from that than any other.
In expressing the opinion that we should have a pretty House of
Qommons if its members could be returned by the deluded dupes of
BAYIEE and the Sabbatarian advertisers, we do not wish to be under-
stood in the literal sense, but in that wherein it is customary to call a
mºss pretty, or to tell a preposterous humbug that he is a #".
fellow, A very ugly House of Commons, physiognomically, would no
doubt.. be constituted by a paramount §. interest. The
maudlin professors of that persuasion are apt to term their fellow-
ranters. “lovely” men, but they are for the most part an extremely
ill-looking set of fellows, whose features, naturally unprepossessing,
are distorted by the i. of Calvinism. No doubt the representa-
tives whom they would send to Parliament would represent them in
nothing more strongly than in their aspect of scowling dulness and
drivelling imbecility.
“No rational amusement on the Sunday !” “No British Museum !”
: No National Gallery!”. “No study of the wonders of Creation!”
“No refining influence of Art l’” “No soothing sounds of music l’”
... No Post Office 1”. “No Railways!” “No Electric Telegraphs!”
...No hearing from sick or dying relatives, or going to visit them!”
These, and such, are the election cries of the Sabbatarian hypocrites
and boobies, and their biessed BAYLEE; these cries and the like: for
instance, perhaps, “No Medical Attendance!” “No pulling oxen
or asses out of pits on the Sabbath Day!” -
We give the advertisement of these bigots the advantage of circu-
lation, in the hope that it may suggest to many sensible persons the
necessity of doing precisely the contrary to what it recommends, and,
of not forgetting, in their enthusiasm for LoRD PALMERSTON perso-
nally, to require, from those candidates for whom they vote, a pledge
to support the noble Lord in the concessions which he is disposed to
make to those claimants of religious liberty who demand emancipation
from the restrictions which #. labour under in consequence of the
§ and peculiar observance of Sunday imposed upon them by
Ulrltaills Ill.
Unaccountable Stewardship.
Most members of the House of Commons have been just giving
their constituents an account of their Stewardship, as they call it, but
no Steward has as yet rendered any account of the Stewardship of the
Chiltern Hundreds.
CHINESE EJECTMENT.

ejectment on the Europeans, may be º; by lawyers as having
highly entitled himself to be described by the soubriquet of John Dougli.

AN-ATOMY OF A MAJORITY.
Those nice men for a small tea-party, MESSIEURs
CoBDEN, DISRAELI, GLADSTONE, NEwdEGATE, and Co., can
hardly find words strong enough to express the strength of
their disgust that the “fortuitous concourse of atoms” to
which they owed their Chinese triumph should be called a
Coalition. In their election addresses they have most of
them been closely plagiarising those Addresses which (absi.
omen / may their }. say) are known as the Rejected
ones. Of course we cannot well expect a man to give his
mind calmly to poetic composition when agitated by the
thoughts of an electioneering contest, or we might have
seen before now some such a paraphrase of a well-known
passage as the following:—
Their votes in elemental chaos mixed,
Atoms by chance the fate of Gov’ment fixed.
No factious cause inspired the happy plot
(Although 'twas whispered PAM might go to pot,
And then both loaves and fishes might be º

leged Rights of Woman—to wit:—A gentleman's #
arm, the lº side of a carriage, and always the
Right side of an argument. To the above may be thrown
in as peculiar Rights that Woman perhaps understands, and

the Rites of Hospitality and the Rites of Hymen.

LORD PALMERSTON AT MADAME TUSSAUD’S.
WE were favoured with an early view of LORD PALMERSTON as he
now appears in freshest wax at MADAME,Tussaul's. After the Order
of the Garter, nothing was wanting to the fullness of the noble Wis-
count’s fame but an elevation to Baker Street; and this enamoured
fortune has vouchsafed, to him. Of course, opinions will differ as to
the merits of the work as a portraiture of the noble lord; for, as
regards even the oldest and grandest, works of art, the most sus-
ceptible, and most acute of critics will occasionally disagree. The
Apollo Belvidere has had his back-biters, and even Venus de Medicis
has been declared not a bit better than she should be. Thus, it is to
be expected—especially in these hustings º: of party contention—
that even the waxen image of the incomparable PREMIER will not pass
without partial detraction; however universal opinion may honour and
applaudit.
..Thus, MR. DISRAELI thinks the statue altogether wants a look of
life-like reality., As “a turbulent and aggressive” minister, his arms
ought to have been a-kimbo, or at least one arm ought to have been
raised, and one fist doubled.
MR. QoEDEN, though generally agreeing with MR. DISRAELI upon
LORD PALMERSTON's objectionable attitude, thought it would not be
sufficient to the likeness as a strikin pºrtrait, if the fist were merely
doubled... He would have the i. incarnadined” like Macbeth's,
that the British tea-drinking º might, over their cups, think of the
dreadful rise in the teapot and the horrible massacre at Canton.
MR. RoeBUçK considered the thing altogether contemptible. He
had once or twice agreed with LoRD PALMERSTON; and had no unalter-
able objection to do so once or twice again. But—he must ask it—why
should LORD PALMERSTON stand there flaunting in a tawdry court
dress smeared all over with gold * Why couldn't he wear a plain blue
coat? Must the noble lord—even il. wax—always be going to the
QUEEN’s balls? When did the noble lord ever see him—ARTHUR
Roebuck—in a court dress?
LoRD John Russell thought the costume very correct and very
befitting. In that costume, he must say, his noble friend looked not like
the minister for France—not like the minister for Austria—but like
the minister for England. LoRD. John, however, could not acquit the
artist of the grossest flattery. , His noble friend was in his seventy-
third year; every day of it and all the Parliamentary nights. We
as his noble friend stood there, he didn't look an hour over fifty. And
all LoRD John would simply ask was this—Was this constitutional?
MR. LAYARD found no fault with the likeness generally; but thought
the position detestable. Why was not his lordship posed with his best
leg foremost, and that leg taking an eastern direction? -
e EARL of DERby, having taken a single glance of his lº;
benevolently hoped that the premises were heavily insured. . Wit
such a combustible addition to the show, he would not, for, his part,
sleep in the neighbourhood, unless all night the hose was laid on H
lordship then, in a laughing manner, and very much º the dis-
covery, called the attention of a friend to the state of the figures of
the EMPEROR NIGHol. As and the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA; both in a
melting state from their proximity to the firebrand PALMERSTON.
Even his Holiness the Pope had begun to perspire. -
MR. GLADSTONE thought the whole thing a gross imposture on
E.; belief. He had counted the hairs of the wig of the effigy, and
owing something of the wig of the living PREMIER, he would p §:
his reputation as a statesman and his expectations as a minister, if the
number of hairs, in each wig would be found to tally. Now, he
repeated that this was a gross delusion, a gross misrepresentation
altogether unworthy of any man pretending to be minister of this
once powerful and once highly-principled country.

done the State much civil service by their nipping in the bud whole

ralty and other Governmental boards,--we learn, we say, from a lately
published Blue, or we might rather call it Black Book that one of the
chief causes of rejection with the candidates was the badness of their
spelling. Of this the instances which are quoted, for our anything but
satisfaction, are as singular as they are º: and we especially are
struck with the ingenious varieties which we find have been devise
for spelling the same words. It would puzzle a JoHN THOMAs to dis-
cover seven ways of writing, the word “grievances” without once
hitting on the right one: yet this feat of cacography has lately been
accomplished; and it would seem the “Mediterranean” has prove
a Rubicon that very many of the Candidates have been unable
to get over, since we see no less than fourteen methods of mis-
spelling it. -
. These results might not unreasonably perhaps have been anticipated
in examining the junior classes of a Ragged School; but, we cannot help
allowing, that the Commissioners, are justified in their expression of
astonishment, that grown up Candidates for Civil Service should have
shown so little previous acquaintance with their spelling books. Nor
can, it much increase one's reverence for what is known in common
parlance as a “gentlemanly education,” when one hears that—
“Out of sixty-six sons of noblemen and gentlemen who were rejected, forty-four
per cent. were for incapacity to spell their own language.”
The better then the birth, the worse would seem the spelling. But,
however much this may have astonished the Commissioners, it is no
surprise to us. We think, though, that the system is at fault much
more than those who suffer for it. We have no wish to speak lightly
of a liberal education, if we say that to our yiew, there is j.
radically wrong in it. We were at a public school ourselves; an

Yet at ten years of age, which were ours when we entered, we could
hardly have acquired that perfect mastery of English which it appa-
rently was taken quite for granted we possessed, since no attempt was
made to cure our imperfections.

[APRIL 4, 1857.
THE BATTLE OF THE CHRISTIAN TEMPLES.
Translated from a fragment of a Latin MS., supposed to be a Roman
Law Report, recently discovered in the Watican.
ABOUT this time (FINNIs EQUA being Consul) the peace of the state
was a good deal disturbed by the quarrels of the people called Christians,
who being no longer persecuted by the Government, proceeded to
rsecute one another. Some of these Christians, being wealthy and
oolish, desired to adorn their temples after the manner of the temples
of the gods, with altars, and carved images, and embroideries of lace,
and women gave liberal gifts in order to furnish forth the same. Two
of their temples, one at the Pons . and the other in the Via
Pimliconis, were thus costlily set forth, and drew crowds of worship.
§. the priests singi § and offering incense, and the minstrels playing.
ther some were seized with great fury at this display and these rites,
which they said were altogether foreign to the traditions of certain
ancient Piscatores, whom they claim as the founders of their religion,
and the two classes, mingling with the celestial ire in their bosoms
certain patrician and plebeian antipathies, did rush to war. Violences
were committed, and much scandal wrought, but the senate and Fº:
restraining them, called upon them to settle their questions of strife
among themselves. This they essayed to do, and sought the sentence
of their chief priests, which was tardily given, and by which the van-
quished party would not be bound. At length, their brawls and their
pertinacity drove them to a course which they all agreed was wrong,
namely, to go to law before a profane tribunal, and not before their
own religious teachers. It was fixed that the trial upon the rites of
the two Christian temples should be set down among the Judicia
Centumviralia, and the Praetor, T. PEMBERTONIUs LEIUs, sat to hear
the same, with three skilful Consilarii, named PARKIUs, PATTIsoNIUs,
and MAULIUs, to whom it was agreed to add a couple of the Christian
flamens as adsessors.
The cause of the Christians being heard at very intolerable length,
the Praetor said Mihi non liquet, and took time for deliberation, and on
the day, of the great god Saturn now last past, pronounced judgment.
He chided both parties for their rancour and their folly, the former
being opposed to the laws of the religion by which they pretended to
be bound, and the latter being shown by their making so vast a matter
3f the absence or presence of a few pieces of wood, stone, and silk,
The Praetor, then decided, that having examined their traditions and
their laws, he, saw no reason why a wooden cross whereof complaint
was made should not remain, the same being regarded as an architect’s
evice. Hereat one part of the Christians broke out into a fierce shout
of triumph, but were compelled to silence by the lictors. The Praetor
next said that a marble altar, erected in the two temples inimitation of
the altars of the gods, must be taken away, with a cross thereupon, and a
wooden table substituted. Hereat another part of the Christians broke
Qut into a fierce shout of triumph, but were compelled to silence b
the lictors. Next, it was held that certain small side tables, calle
Credences, which had given great offence to the iconoclastic party,
might be retained, as might the embroidered cloth wherewith the
Fº had, been wont to cover the said altar when not offering sacri.
ce, and wherewith they might now cover the table, so that no man
could know whether it were an altar or not. But the embroidered
linen and lace which had beenH. upon the said altar was not to
be used again. Finally, the Pretor condemned each party to pay
his own costs, and dismissed the Christians with º to live
tºgether in amity, and to remember what one of ourselves had said of
them, “See, how these Christians love one another.” The sentence
striking both ways, neither party fixed the garland of Green Palm at
his advocate's door, which nevertheless either might well have done,
both having enough and to spare of greenness.

“CLEAN HANDs.”
HE late governor of the British
Bank, MR, Esdaile, took touch-
ing occasion at the Court of
Bankruptcy to thank God with
a sigh—
“Some le al -
Jºsh in
says the poetess of Aurora Leigh,
—that, sinking with the #
Bank, he had sunk with “clean
hands.”, May not the public be
favoured with cheap casts of
those, monetary hands, painted
after the purity of the originals?
They would, doubtless, be of
great interest even as objects of
art-of the very highest and the
very deepest art—to depositors
and shareholders, hung over
their mantel-pieces. Ås we
ave known soldiers and sailors
who carefully hoarded the bullet
that had hit them; so, doubt-
less, might the sufferers by the
British Bank find food for bitter
melancholy in contemplating the
shape of the palms, the insin-
uating delicacy of finger of the
hands of the governor, under
whose manipulation the British
Bank, like a soap-bubble, burst
into infinite space. We have
not the least doubt of the pre-
sent purity of MR. Esdaiie's
hands: but we confess a curi-
osity to know the sort of wash-
balls he used for ablution, seeing that from his close friendshi
with MR. CAMERON, the É. must now and then have touche
pitch. But purity and refinement seemed to be the besetting qualities
of the late governor. CAMERON was a working, vulgar tool: EsnailE
was the tranquil gentleman. In fact, CAMERON, in, the words of
ESDAILE-" was the supreme executive of the Bank.”
“You do not mean to say,”—puts in the merciless MR. LINKLATER
– he was there for use, and you for ornament?” . - -
And MR. EsdailE makes º with all the conscious dignity of the
passive, yet superior article—“It was very much the case.”
report was issued—it is not stated whether before or after MR.
ESDAIIE had washed his hands, but we incline to think before–
in which the blessings to be derived from the British Bank were
thus set forth-
“The contributions of innumerable small rills gradually swelling into a ºlºg
head might be diffused so as to irrigate and fructify the surrounding space, an
a blessing to the givers and receivers.”
This is evidently from the useful hand of CAMERON, and not from
the hand ornamental of EspailE., CAMERQN, moreover, was the º
monger; the bird of pray; hence, his note is audible in the subjoined.
“That the benefits of the institution to the community would as much exceed
those of even savings-banks as did the gains of the good and faithful servant those
of him who kept his pound laid up in a napkin."
It is really too much for CAMERON IscARIOT, for him who “bore the
bag,” to calculate the gains of the good and faithful servant. Under
the nominal rule of the ornamental governorship, the directors sent out
the following courageous falsehood:-
“That the Royal British Bank being incorporated by Royal Charter, it
a privilege of §. local business equal to any Bank except the Bank of England.
The Lords of HER MAJEsty's Privy Council of Trade had already approved of the
: constitution by increasing the capital as the nature of the business might

. Again we say, we do not for a moment doubt the s
liness of Mr. Españº's hands; but we must emphatic
this question-Where does he buy his soap?

Little Girl. “OH, I BEG You R PARDON,
SIR'-IT was THE WIND As DoNE IT!”
A CHILD GOING A-BEGGING.
PHRENOLOGY talks of an organ of “Philoprogenitiveness,” or the
love of Children, In some heads this is excessively large, in others
unnaturally small. Subjoined is an advertisement § appears to be
fººd by parents of the latter class to childless people of the
Ormer :—
DOPTED CHILDREN.—A Boy, aged seven years, will be given up
entirely to .. respectable party wishing to adopt him. The Child's parents
are of º e blood, but their present circumstances do not enable them to educate
him. The Child is more than ordinarily intelligent, and very musical. Address,
, General Advertisor Office.
The gentle blood of which these parents boast does not appear to
manifest itself in parental tenderness. Although, however, they seem
to have very little, “Philoprogenitiveness” themselves, they evidently
have an exaggerated idea of the possible strength of the feeling in
others. They consider the age of seven years, intelligence more than
ordinary, and a very musical turn, to be recommendations, on the part
of their little boy, sufficient to be likely to induce some people to take
him upon their hands and charge themselves with his education and
maintenance. Who, most of our readers will exclaim, would take a
child for a §. when, at a rate so very much cheaper, he could keep
a terrier P. Some, perhaps, of that class of persons whosend conscience.
money to the QHANCELLøR of THE Exchequer may take the fanc
9f adopting a child into their heads with the same view as that §
induces others to buy a dog. . Religious zealots, too, Papist or Pro-
testant, may look upon an infant, who will be given up entirely to
them, as a great catch. They may be ready to jump at the chance of
prºuring an addition to their respective persuasions; and may rejoice
in the purpose of training up their adopted child in the way they thi
he should go, just as persons of other sentiments please themselves in
the design of reaking a setter. The musical quality of the child will
perhaps commend it to the devotees of St. Cºcº. Probably this
quality is hereditary. A poem of the nursery declares that-
“The cuckoo is a pretty bird:
He sings as he flies-"
and the parents of this child, in proposing to abandon their offspring
to the care of strangers, exhibit themselves in the character of those
F. constituted singing birds called cuckoos. They are also
iable to another ornithological comparison, and may be said to resemble
ducks, for these fowls also object to rear their young. This conside-
ration may }. a foster-mother for the child, in the person of some
benevolent lady who may be desirous of dandling a little duck.
- PEACE AND NO PEACE.
IT may be observed that, as a rule, the Members of the Peace
Society display a most unfitting bellicosity of language. The vehe-
mence with which they have been lately, “giving it" to all who dare
to differ with them on the merits of the China, question, makes us
almost tremble for the safety of our ears should the country, now
decide for carrying on the war with still increasing vigour. Were
further outrage to is heaped upon the interesting victims of our bar-
barous brutalities, we may question if the Peace brawlers would be
able to discover words half strong enough, to give a due expression to
the strength of their virtuous indignation. At any rate we doubt if
any orator among them could so far repress his feelings, as to speak
with any calmness of that crash of the Celestials, which might ensue
if John BULL were provoked to force his way into the China Shop
with a goodwill to the business. We suspect that even MR., CoBDEN,
with ºfhis mastery of language, would in such case, find it difficult to
keep his tongue in due command, and show that, to misquote the poet,
he was—
“Master of himself, though China fall.”
Court Circular from the Nursery.
“PRINCE LEopol.p”—writes the Court Newsman of Thursday—
“visited the Zoological Gardens in the Regent's Park.” The Prince,
being at the ripe age of almost four, it is especially necessary that a
thinking people should know when His Royal Highness condescend-
ingly visits the guinea-pigs, and what time he graciously spends in the
monkey-house.

THE MYTH OF PAN AND
LIKE to the º voice of yore
1 *
That cried “Great PAN is dea
From land to land, from shore to shore,
Throughout all Europe went a roar,
Increasing as it sped,
A bellow of tremendous tone,
Saying “Great PAM is overthrown!”
Howevery despot did rejoice,
When broke upon his ear .
The tidings of that welcome voice,
The Minister of England's choice,
The statesman tyrants fear,
Proclaiming hurled from place and power,
Now, thought they, is our day and hour !
KING BoMBA tossed aloft his crown,
Extravagant in joy,
And, catching it in coming down,
Grinned in the manner of a clown,
And capered like a boy.
His captives' chains more sweetly clanked,
Whilst on his knees his saints he thanked.
The Pope pulled off his triple hat,
And kicked it in his glee.
The Cardinals all danced thereat,
And some intoned Latificat,
And others Juvat me.
The Jesuits in their several climes,
Sang out in doggerel Latin rhymes.
The Russian CzAR did manifest
The most extreme delight,
Exulting in his inmost breast,
He º his fingers at the West,
He also took a sight. .
His diadem, with gems enriched,
He likewise at the ceiling pitched.
KING CLIcquot, when he heard the news,
Was overcome thereby;
His self-control it made him lose,
And from his eyes glad tear-drops ooze,
For he began to cry.
And then he laughed, and then he cried
Again, with crown stuck all aside.
Ah, news too happy to be true!
, transports premature!
Bright faces soon were changed to blue
Of despots, and the priestly crew,
Of triumph too secure.
Another voice from England went,
And thundered o'er the Continent.
º to a tyrant’s ear,
e British #. shout;
For PALMERston, his country's cheer,
Which Europe's tyrants quake to hear;
They find PAM won't go out;
But, to their disappointment sore,
Is stronger than he was before.
AN EXTRAORDINARY SNUFF-BOX.
IT, is not sufficiently considered that many lumatics, may exist
besides those who are in confinement, and may be going about unsus-
pected of insanity. Here is an advertisement, evidently the compo-
sition of a disordered mind, put, in a freak of madness, by some
unfortunate person, into the Times:–
Tº CABMEN.—LOST, on Friday, the 6th of March, a GOLD SNUFF-
BOX, of an oval shape, while taking a gentleman from the Horse Guards to
Connaught Terrace. Whosoever will restore the same to — —
—, will receive THREE Pounds REWARD. No further reward wº
be offered.
How far gone in frenzy a man must be, under what an extraordinary
delusion he must labour, to describe a gold snuffbox as taking a
person from place to º and getting lost whilst so doing! There
probably existed in the º imagination of the advertiser a
strange jumble and confusion of snuff-box with pill-box, and the Lord
MAYon’s º coach. It is manifest that he must be in a very bad
way indeed, because there is not any method, eyen, in his madness,
inasmuch as he offers the ridiculous reward of three pounds for the
restoration of a golden vehicle large enough to contain agentleman,
and addresses that, offer to cabmen. Had he any logical faculty re.
º: he would have offered at least three thousand pounds instead
of three.
Public safety demands that a sharp look-out should be kept for
madmen roaming at large. Strict directions have been given that any
person presenting himself with a frantic advertisement like the above
at our publishing office, shall be detained until his friends can be
sent for, or else shall be given into custody, in order to be taken
proper care of. -
9 be sure the above advertisement may be a hoax, intended to annoy
the individual referred to in it. If that is the case, it may perhaps be
considered ascribable rather to silliness than raving delirium.
MYSTERIOUS DONATION.
THE Newcastle Chronicle has chronicled a remarkable donation, in
stating that
“Mr. Edward ELLiott, of Earsdon, Builder, has presented a grindstone to the
North of England Temperance Bazaar.” -
A grindstone in a bazaar seems almost as much out of place as a
piano would be in a pigsty; and the relation of temperance to grind-
stones is not obvious. Nº. of England blades are generally sharp
enough; perhaps MR. Edward ELLIott thinks that those of the
Temperance temper are exceptions to the rule, and has sent them a
delicate hint to that effect in the shape of a grindstone, avoiding a
blunter method of rebuking their want of sharpness. Those whoma
deem this explanation far-fetched will perhaps be better satisfied wit
the hypothesis that the gift was intended to suggest to its recipients
the necessity of adding industry to temperance, as a symbol exhorting
them to put their noses to the grindstone.
TOO HARD ON THE TURF.
You R attention is invited to the following sportive observations of a
- - -- --
sporting character, who calls himself “ARGUs:”—
“‘Can Gemma di Vergy beat Fisherman?' was asked quite as often as the pro-
bable result of the elections. The Ilsley division, who put a thousand on the
“Oxford Hero," replied in the affirmative; but there were not a few who clung to the
opinion of ‘ARGus,” that he would have to play second fiddle, and I never recollect “A
Trial" since PALMER's which created more interest.”
The hundred eyes of “ARGus” seem all as one; for he writes like a
man who has a single eye to sport. We think he does the turf
injustice. A trial of race-horses is not fairly comparable with such a
trial as PALMER's. In PALMER's trial murder was in question: a horse-
race cannot be worse than an affair of roguery.
“Le Commencement de la Fin.”
THERE is an old Screw who makes a practice of staying off . con-
tribution to any charitable cause, by saying, “No, Sir; my greed, Sir,
is, charity begins at home,”-ſhave always made a point of that, Sir!”
– “Yes,” said a Secretary, who was tired of asking him, “and that
point is a full stop—for I have noticed that your charity invariably
stops at the point where it begins.”
ANTED.—An Engagement as Stage Manager, or to be placed in a
position where he can be useful in arranging processions, or getting up Concerts,
or superintending the lighting of public buildings, or putting himself at the head of
a general illumination. Can also º chaunt, intone, or join in chorus in a very
loud and approved manner. Has no objection to undertake for noblemen or gen-
tlemen the management of any amateur theatricals. Can have a seven years' cha-
racter from a Puseyite Chapel.-Address to CALEB Quorest, Westry Door, St. Bar-

Lactea. Whither then, child? . . -
Aquaria. I seek the cow with the iron tail.

ture, always ready to fill my pails.

#. And thou would'st pump water into thy milk? Nay, thou

Aquaria. Come to the pump and see my water-frolic. You are as
welcome as the flowers in May. . - -
Lactea. Those last words signify that all innocence and poetry is
not gone from thee. And yet thou would'st water thy milk. I have a
yearning to talk to thee hereon. - - - - -
Aquaria. Go ahead. Only it’s as cheap sitting as standing, so I
will bring myself to an anchor (as my cousin JACK the sailor says) on
the top of this pail. --- -
Laclea. Dost thou know what milk is? .
Aquaria. Fourpence a quart to them as will pay fourpence, and to
them as don't see it in that light, threepence. -
Lactea. I did not mean the price, though that astonishes me... In
my time it was one penny. But I would ask thee of what milk is
compounded ?
Aquaria. That’s ...; - - - -
Lactea. Nay, I gather thy meaning, and grieve at it. The milk thou
sellest is not pure. -
Aquaria. Well, on the whole, I should rayther say it was not.
Lactea, Dost know what pure milk contains? -
Aquaria. Yes, to be sure. Do you think I’m a Nignoramus * I
learned it at school. Milk consists of water, holding in solution casein
or cheese, sugar of milk, various salts, and in suspension, fatty matter
in the form of myriads of semi-opaque globules, to which the colour
and opacity of milk are due. - -
Laclea. Did'st ever learn at school, also, two little lines, as follow *
“Who know what's right; nor only so,
But always practise what they know."
Aquaria (her better nature thus appealed to, awakens, and she bursts
into a flood of tears). Ow-ow—ow—ow—ow.
Lactea. It is well. Thou art touched Be comforted 1 Confess
thy mal-practices, and resolve to err no more. -
Aquaria (virtuous sentinents gaining sway). Yea, verily, and so I
will. And here goes. What shall I begin with ?.
Lactea. Is there so much to tell, my poor penitent? Well, let me
know with what thou dost adulterate thy milk. - -
Aquaria. Chiefly with water. But also with sugar, including treacle,
salt, annatto, turmeric, gum tragacanth, soda, starch, cerebral matter—
Lacted. A shorter word, prithee.
ºria. Then tiºn of boiled white carrots, chalk, and
StarCIn.
Lactea, My stars! All the stars in the Milky way!
Aquaria. Yes, these things are all used. Why, bless you, dear,
figures show that the number of cows supplying London is not more
than enough to provide each person with one table-spoonful a-day. It
ºl. to reason, therefore, #. the milk must be made of something
else.
Lacéea. The use of water I comprehend. It is simply cheating. But
why the other substances?
Aquaria. Because, if we pour in such a lot of water, as I was just
ºins to do, but will never do so any more, so help me newer So
much-
Lactea. Nay, avoid vows, and cultivate resolution. Well, dear?
Aquaria. I was going to say that the water makes Skyblue, and it
takes away all the flavour. So we put treacle to sweeten the milk,
. to bring out the flavour, and ammatto to restore the beautiful rich
COIOur.
Lactea. And turmeric P
Aquaria. That is also a colouring matter.
Lactea. And thou then didst mention Draga something?
Aquaria. Tragacanth—it thickens cream, and soda prevents its
turning sour. As for the starch and brains, the milk people got con-
tradictions about this stuck into the papers, but you ask PROFEssoR
QUECKETT, who has got pictures of what he found in milk.
Lactea. The frankness of thy confession, dear maid, atones for thy
share in the guilt. But let me tell thee something. Milk should be
the most nutritious of food, and contain all the elements for the
fº and sustenance of the human body. Being a poet's creation, I
ave a right to foretell everything, and I foresee an invention by a
Frenchman, MonsLEUR DONNé, called a Lactoscope, or Milk-tester
which will lay bare all the frauds of which thou speakest, and will
show that this rich liquid is utterly deteriorated for the millions who
it.
Aquaria. Nay, I can tell you something of that., Out of twenty-six
samples of London milk, fourteen were adulterated, chiefly with water,
at various rates, from 10 to 50 per cent. -
Lactea. Fifty! That is one-half water. - -
Aquaria. y, it must be so. The farmer sells his milk to the
. dealers at from Fiyepence to Sevenpence a gallon, and the small
dealers buy it at from Sevenpence to Ninepence a barn-door gallon.
A barn-door gallon is—
Laclea. Eight quarts.
Aquaria. Just so, and we sell it to the people at from Threepence to
Fourpence a quart. And neat milk at Eightpence a barn-door gallon,
becomes milk and water at Fourpence an imperial quart. Therefore,
if my ciphering at school does not deceive me, the retailer gets, on
every quart, from Tempence to a Shilling.
Lactea. Alas, alas, and the poor little children are starved with the
mess with which their F. think to feed them. O AQUARIA, think
of the little children whom you have helped to cheat, think—
[AQUARIA with hysterical outcry kicks over her pails, and in
violent pantomime renounces the milk-walk of life for ever.
SPORTIVE BOYHOOD.
A HEART-BREAKING appeal has been made in the Times for the
liberation of an interesting little boy consigned to the dreariness of a
dungeon, and the persecution of the prison chaplain's advice, for—only
throwing stones at a railway. In fact, to throw stones at railways
is fast becoming a juvenile, mania, and threatens to supersede the
execution of Keemo Kimo and Bobbing Around. . An ingenuous youth,
#. fourteen, by name CHARLEs BRAIN wooD, is brought before MR.
ARDLEY, the magistrate. CHARLEs, has “deliberately hurled a
stone” at the North London train. CHARLEs was fined 20s., but not
having the money about him, was committed to gaol, to be kept at the
expense of the county, for fourteen days. We think the sentence very
incomplete... We think the bonds might in such cases be judiciously
mingled with just a taste, a smack of whipcord. There is no doubt
that CHARLEs is an impulsive, hot-headed youth. Well, we would
prescribe the administration of a little wholesome flogging. After
this manner should the hot-headed boy be taught, past all disproof,
how very closely extremes could meet.
A Saint at 212°.
SoME time ago we were told that the blood of St. Gennaro would
not melt, and we supposed, at the time, that this was owing to the
circumstance that it was frozen by KING BoMBA’s atrocities. if it has
since liquefied, it has probably more than liquefied, and is now, with
indignation on account of the abominable cruelties of which its despotic
devotee is guilty, absolutely boiling.

The following lines were found in the cell of a discharged convict, who
made his way into a chaplain's heart by piety, and, subsequently, into
a jeweller's shop by burglary. The spirit that dictated such an
irreverence with DR. WATTs is worthy of the author.

With bath-room, gas, and bed.

A ROAR FROM THE HELVETIAN LION.
“MR. PUNCH, -
- “WERE I a guinea-pig, and not a lion, I know.you would
listen to my squeak, if uttered in the cause of truth and justice. It
is, however, a lion, the Lion of Helvetia, that would, through your
pages, make himself heard to the nations.
‘That roar, the prowling lion's Here I am!"
as your poet of solitude and the mountains, WILLIAM WoRDsworth,
wrote, shall cause even the maniac of Naples to start in his fastness of
Caserna, and make him lift his shaking, hand to his head to know if
he still wears a crown, and if it be of gold, and not of straw. . .
“A week or two since, Mr. Punch, you penned an article, calling it
GESLER's HAT. From that article, as from a *†. **. twanged a
shaft at the Helvetian Lion. I will confess it, the shaft hit me. In
olden times, as told by early travellers, lions have been found slain
outright by the mortal quills, of vengeful porcupines. For, myself
Mr. Punch, although I bled a little, I am not killed. Nevertheless, f
am hurt; hurt, Sir, and must give voice to my sufferings.
“You speak of the Swiss-the sons of the mountain and the
cataract—who are made...the body-guard of §. and wrong at
Naples and Rome. Hirelings of homicide—pai º to the lust of
crime. Myrmidons who dip their daily bread in the blood and tears
of tortured truth. At the very words, I feel a certain twitching of
the tail; but I will not lash myself; no, Mr. Punch, I will be calm–
terribly calm. - - -
“For the liveried Swiss in the pay of the Pope and the Ogre of
Naples, I denounce them—they are no sons of Switzerland; but
thieves, renegades, wretches; abandoned of their country as of their
conscience. d the time is come that the world at large, or that
England at least, should know the exact condition of these ruffians,
who take the pay of CAIN, and mount d over the rack, and do
sentinel's duty while the victim of the ‘Cap of Silence' dumbly dies in
#: ... to mount with an accusing shriek against his murderer in
e next.
“Listen, Mr. Punch, to a plain tale. In former days, that is, long
before the year 1847, there existed certain capitulations between the
Neapolitan Government and some few of the Swiss Catholic Cantons,—
where of course the priests, as º commonly are, were potent—by
virtue, or wickedness of which capitulations aforesaid, N. Was
permitted to send enrolling agents or travelling man-trappers for the
enlistment of *. who might prefer the high pay, and climate,
and maccaroni of Naples to the noble poverty, the rugged independ.
ence of the mountain-home of Switzerland.
“Other Cantons vehemently protested inst this man-catchi
for the purposes of tyranny and ..". protestation was a
they might deal in. The Cantonal Governments, having at the time
sovereign rights, used them as was to be expected—right sovereignly;
that is, in defiance and º: of their protesting neighbours. An
so Naples continued to send her old recruiting sergeants, Hoyſicipe
and CRUELTY, to the sovereign Cantons, to enlist the slaves who, for
º, would draw the sword with ease and despatch for any
atrocity.
“Well, after the revision of the federal pact in 1847, and the political
regeneration consequent thereupon, it was established by law that
henceforth no capitulation or treaty—open, or secret—for man-buying
for any foreign military, service, should be permitted. Switzerland
said—this abomination shall no longer remain. If tyranny will hire
its sanguinary flunkeys, they shall #. from the land that misbegot
them, denounced and accursed. The recruiting-sergeant for the guard
of honour to the Papal gibbet or Neapolitan rack, if found in Switzer-
land, should be fined and imprisoned: like punishment was to be
visited upon the sanguinary flunkeys themselves—and many of these,
were, at times, tracked on their road rejoicing at their preferment as
hireling goalers and turnkeys, and straightway brought back, and
straightway and severely chastised.
. “Of course, Mr. Punch, you will ask—With these virtuous restric-
tions, how, comes it that Rome and Naples continue to have their
Swiss hirelings? How is it, that Bloodshed and Rapine continue to
fill, their ranks from the children of Helvetia?. Why, Sir, after this
fashion. In Lombardy and Austria proper—in Bregenz and Feld-
kirch, for instance-offices are opened for the enlistment of Roman
ruffians and Neapolitan cut-throats on hire. These offices are in the
immediate neighbourhood of the Swiss frontiers—how easy, then, is it
for the drunkard, the brawler, the good-for-nothing, the sheer idler,
the ruined gambler, the scamp of all trades, to take enlistment mone
of the ºut. accredited by the Fisherman of Rome, an
the Gaoler of Naples P
“Dear Mr. Punch, believe me, that of such, and only of such, are
the soul and body guards—(how little their souls shall have been pro.
tected will be shown at the terrible season,)—of Pope Pius and KING
feronand. For know we not the butcher by the redness of his
hands? At Naples, the Swiss guards have the highest pay, and most
indulgent licence in unlimited vice. The more brutalised the agent,
the fitter for brute service. The Christians were given to the beasts.
Patriots are flung to the Swiss |
“But Switzerland! Does she acknowledge these recreants? No:
they are her degraded, disobedient children. She has lost power over
them. They are her prodigal sons, never to be softened by remorse.
One act, I grant, Switzerland-in consideration of her own wounded
honour, smitten by parricidal hands—one act, the country might yet
in self-vindication perform. Let her immediately pronounce sentence
of civil death upon every Swiss serving at Naples or Rome. What-
ever the Swiss guards may be in the eyes of king or Pope, let them be
no other than so many living anatomies, civilly dead, in the nostrils
Switzerland.
“I have the honour to remain, Mr. Punch,
“With every consideration,
“Lucerne, March 28.” “THE HELVETIAN LION.”
CAWE, CANIS
A FRIEND at Aldershot apprises us of the gratifying fact that Edu-
cation must have spread not only among the military, but among
another class of faithful defenders of our homes. He states that some-
where near the Camp he has read this notice:-
“Lou NGERs, AND Dogs, ARE HEREBY war.NED OFF THESE PREMISEs.”
Of course, unless the second named parties could understand this
notice, it would be ridiculous to address it to them, and we gladly
announce the news that in Surrey the dogs can read.
The Sea Brought to London.
THERE is a magnificent proposition, well-argued, in the Lancet, to
make the Serpentine a salt-water lake, by moving the monster,0cean

removal take place, it is understood that all jś will imme-
diately come to town, and settle by the sad sea waves in Hyde Park.

GENERAL VIEW OF A GENERAL ELECTION.
The Pots accuse the Kettles of Blackness, and the Public goeth at it Hammer and Tongs.
BUCHANAN TO BUNCOMBE.
MR. BughanAN's Inaugural Address as President of the United States will
be read with much satisfaction, and some amusement. It contains a few funny
things: here is one of them, relative to the evils of disunion:—
“These I shall not attempt to portray, because I feel a humble confidence that the kind Pro-
vidence which inspired our fathers with wisdom, to frame the most perfect form of government
and union ever devised by man, will not suffer it to perish until it shall have been peacefully
instrumental by its example in the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout the world.”
Of course MR. BUCHANAN does not mean to say that he expects the American
constitution not to perish till civil and religious liberty shall have been universally
established, and then to perish. The fun of the above passage lies in the idea of
an example of civil liberty set by a constitution which maintains slavery. Certainly
there is no inconsistency in this idea of MR. BUCHANAN’s, if he considers that
Negroes are not human beings, but brute animals. But then, in another part of
his address, he calls slavery an institution. Now we do not, neither do Americans,
talk of the institution of horse-keeping, and horse-breeding, and horse-driving.
Studs and teams are not termed institutions, on either side of the Atlantic.
Marriage is an institution, if MR. Buchan AN, likes; and slavery may be denomi-
nated an institution too, if the subjects of the latter yoke, like those of the former,
are to be acknowledged as men and women. But, even by American licence of
speech, the word institution, is inapplicable to an arrangement relative to mere
beasts. If slavery is an institution, slaves are men; and when their masters talk
about setting an example of civil liberty they must be understood as addressing
all such discourse to BUNCOMBE.
The Bilky Way.
WE have already alluded to the Lancet's statement that there is something
serious the matter with the Cows of London, and may add that the Government
has taken measures to prevent further mischief. It is probable that the taking
up so many streets has disturbed the wells, but this is merely a temporary incon.
yenience, and a commission of respectable ironmongers can speedily repair any-
thing else that is out of order in the quarter affected. There is no reason to
suppose that the supply of milk will be diminished.

JESUITS ON THE AUSTRIAN STAGE.
DURING the absence of the EMPEROR of Austria on
his Italian tour, the Jesuits of Vienna resolved to reform
the legs of the dancers. As Lady Lambert bought a piece
of thick muslin, inasmuch as the very sight of Charlotte's
neck offended Dºctor Cantwell, so did the Jesuits, out
of self-modesty, thickly clothe the legs of the Viennese
dancers. Since the return, however, of the EMPEROR, the
“leggings” have been discontinued. It is said that, out of
pure gratitude to the intervention of the patron saint of
the ballet, the young ladies are about to go in solemn pro-

THE “RECORD » ON THE TURF.
OW droll it is to meet
5 with a fast man in a
suit of black and a
white choker!, Equally
funny was it to us to
meet, the other day,
with the subjoined pas-
sage in the Record.
The subject referred to
is LoRD DERBy’s view
of matters clerical:—
“To say nothing of the
logical soundness or moral
dignity of such ascheme, the
. Noble Earl ought to know
that no problem of the Turf
—where the books have to
be made up among a dozen
favourites—is half so com-
plex as his simple plan for
securing a safe and sensible
style of Churchmanship and
Church patronage, by strik-
ing an average among all
the actual opinions, and
thus avoiding the risk of
perilous extremes.”
In the above passage we think we recognise a literary clergyman who exhibits a familiarity
with a sort of book-making very different from the composition of sermon-books and tracts.
We hail the appearance of a sporting parson in the Record. He will much enliven the
columns of our serious contemporary. ...Who can he be?, The REv; MR.ARGUs, or the REv.

great national horse-race we expect that he will occupy a good place on the betting-stand, or
at least will be stationed on the outside of a drag at a distance not remote from Tattenham's
Corner. We wonder if he is versed in the canine, fistic, and other departments of sport,
or whether the Turf is his speciality?. -
Most likely, his attention is restricted to one line: the Record would hardly stand a
contributor whose taste in sport was catholic.
HEAVY BODIES. for belonging to it:
. Monsieur BABINET tells us that the earth, after recent determina-
tions of its compactness, is equivalent to a weight of
"6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 de kilogrammes. Cela fait six mille milliards de
milliards de tonnes.”
Absent Teas.
This may be true or not, for it is not in the power of every one to
take the world in his hand, and weigh it like an orange, as easily as
an astronomer. However, we only record the above weighty conclu-
sion in order to put upon paper, our melancholy misgivings that the
Parliament about to assemble will be not less heavy than the earth
itself, and our misgivings are founded upon the fact of the inordinate
number of ciphers, it will contain. , PALMERston, of course, repre-
sents, as above indicated, the unit 6, which gives to the º tail of
zeros that are running after him the only value that they have; besides,
it is no exaggeration to say, that PALMERSTON, as measured by the other
members, is well worth any half-dozen of them.
POLITICAL ABSENTEEISM.
By the general choice, or election, of the country, MR. CoBDEN's
small tea-party has been made a thorough case of tea and turn-out.
SUBJECTS FOR SPECULATION.
THE prospectus of the Emporio Italiano, after
asking “What is the world?” and kindly telling
us that it is nothing but “a huge market open
to speculation,” proceeds to say:—
“People speculate on positions as they do on corn. One
man speculates on the greenness of his neighbour, another
on his ignorance.”
The “greenness” of our neighbours is cer-
tainly the largest field of speculation we ever
heard of. But we fancy there are speculators
who work both on the “greenness” and the
“ignorance” of their neighbours. If we are
not, mistaken, we think the Directors, of the
British Bank speculated largely in both ways.
But perhaps by this time MR. APSLEY PELLATT
has recovered his recollection, and so we will
refer the speculative question to him. As one
of the large dealers in the “huge market of
speculation,” probably he can inform us how
many. sheep and geese were annually sold,
slaughtered, and plucked there?. He need only
give us an approximate number, for we are well
aware that the Directors of the British Bank
were not over particular to a hundred or two.
The Grammar of Ornament.
“Do you mean to say, Doctor, that the ladies
are more positive than the men?”
“Comparatively speaking they may be, Madam,
but then again the ladies are far more superla-
tive than the men.”

mar ºf Ornament” was overheard at a

to whose memory he trusts that the new Parlia-
ment will pay a fitting tribute, by a vote of its condolence with the
Theory and Practice.
Purely through an accident, the Yehs, “had it” in the House; but
upon appeal that judgment is reversed, and the Ex-Member for the
Riding, in the losing of his seat, is saddled with the costs. Those who
thought that MR. CoBDEN was going the whole hog in his censure of
John BULL, and his defence of the Chinese, have been verified in
finding him an out-and-outer.
But Punch is not so gallinaceous as to crow over a defeat like that
of RICHARD CoBDEN. With all his dislike to the Chinese Protec-
tionist, Punch cannot lose remembrance of the English Freetrader.
We all have our weak ints, and a man of such mettle as Richard
CoBDEN proved himself in 1846, may be excused for showing a few
flaws some ten years later. Therefore Punch is not so chuckle-headed
as to raise a chuckle over CoRDEN's expulsion from the House, how:
eyer much he may hurrah to find no echo in the country to the voice of
the Ex-Member on the China question. Although considering the
break-up of the tea-party with unmixed satisfaction, Punch can but
feel regret at the dismemberment of those who have been turned out

Mr. Punch (mysteriously). “Now what would You LIKE? SAY ATITLE-
say THE Onder of the Thistle /"
MARY ANN’S NOTIONs.
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“Poor dear Papa has been beaten, and I need hardly say
that “election” is a tabooed word in our house. Dear old thing, he
had set his mind upon coming in, but I suppose the bribery money he
advanced was not enough, or it was stolen by the attorneys, or
bankers, or somebody. It is very ridiculous that, if votes are to be
tº: there is not some office or place where the money could be
paid in and a candidate be sure it gets to the right hands. However,
the thing is done, and Papa has returned to town as savage as possible,
and though Mamma and me do our best not to annoy him by the least
reference to the subject, Augustus is not, so considerate, and is
always talking about this man being floored, and that man having
a squeak for it (a rat, I suppose), and the other man pulling up like
one o'clock; and Papa winces; and, what is worse, I should not
wonder if we had to economise at Hastings, or some such horrible
place, this year," instead of going to Vienna. And now I have told
ou all, I remember that I never told you that Papa was going to offer
imself, but you know that he was always Parliamentary in ń. mind,
and the other night he was hurried off by the might train, and in the
morning his Address came up to us—such nonsense, but just like the
others in the newspapers-pledging himself to do a lot of things
without committing himself to a lot of other things. I wish he had
kept his money, and taken us to Vienna—as—no, I won't tell you who
said, because you made fun one week?—but, as Somebody said, the
Prater there is a much pleasanter neighbourhood than that of the
praters at Westminster.” -
- Well, your precious General Election is over, and now what
next? ...What is the good of all the hubbub, and extravagance
and bribery, and canting, and rioting, and drinking beer? Wi
there be, any new laws made with any sense in them, or will, the
new Parliament go on talking rubbish and quarrelling factiously in
the way you expose every week—and I only wish, by the way, that
you would let me write that Essence of Parliament," which you do
not make half severe enough, and,-but the fact is that you are afraid
to call persons by their right names, and, if you think a Member is a
fool or, a knave, why don't you tell him so?' Men are dreadful
cowards, and I always said it.
“I §§. that among the ridiculous laws that will be made, some-
body assa Bill for putting down witches and fortune tellers. I
See a good deal about it in the papers, and the subject is being ‘venti-
lated,’ as Papa says, before it is taken up. What has set your wise.
acres upon the matter, is a trial I read, where a wizard got twenty-two
pounds for unbewitching a farmhouse; and because this was a cheat,
the police will proclaim, war against every poor old creature that tells
fortunes. Of course, if a woman offers to intercede, there will be a
chorus of indignation, and intellectual young men will sniff out their
contempt, declaring that by Jove they believe that, the idiots (us) put
faith in a dirty old wretch with a dirty pack of cards. , I should like to
know which is the simplest, us, or gentlemen who believe in secret
|information about horse-racing that they write for to thieves who
advertise ‘tips.” Are these people so clever, and do they give such
correct information in return for money? Why the old women that
tell you that you will marry a fair man, and have children, and go a
journey, and receive a letter, and be deceived in a pretended friend,
and find a friend in a quarter you had no expectations from, cannot
cheat half so much as the wretches that advise you to consult them, as
they have a safe, thing for the Derby; and we are not half such idiots
as you are to believe in the secrets of creatures who lodge over stables
*d in back-streets in Clerkenwell, and yet can help you to fortunes."
“Besides, if there is no such thing as witchcraft, the pretending to
it can do no harm, and if there is, you may be quite sure that it is not
by the wise men of Westminster that it will be put down. Ido not pre-
tend to say what I believe," but all the wisest and best men of past
es were superstitious,” as you callit; and even SIR WALTER Scott,
whose mind was a good deal stronger, I suppose, than the minds of
most of the men of the present day (also NAppleoN), believed in
ghosts and things." And if you go to church, which I hope you do
you must hear constantly that the Jews had witches and wizards, an
though that is a long time ago, truth can never die.” And some people
whom I know have had the most extraordinary º told them
fortune-tellers who had not the least knowledge of them beforehan
and I could tell you that to a young lady of my own acquaintance, who
was married last year, a woman predicted something that came exact
true; how she would go a journey, and lose something she valued, an
have a quarrel about it, which would not be made up until something
else which she particularly wished for had happened, and it came true
to the letter, for they went to Ramsgate, and she lost one of her
bracelets in a bathing-machine, and her husband never ceased to tor-
ment her about it until her baby was born, when he gave her a much
more beautiful one. Besides. I could tell you of other ºf: of a
more serious kind, that have been revealed in the same way.” The only
strong argument which any of you men bring forward against the for-
tune-tellers is, that they are poor and live in penury, but this is a very
vulgar objection, and just like Mammon worshippers, who would not
believe in a diamond unless it was in a gold setting; and besides, how
do you know that they are poor? Perhaps they only pretend to be
and this is the reason they live in such obscure places, and to avoid
the persecution of the laws.
“I do not mean, of course, that servant-girls and creatures of that
kind ought to be encouraged to go to these women, and get their heads
full of nonsensical ideas that they are the children of gentlemen, and
are to marry noblemen with coaches-and-six, making them unfit for
their stations and duties,” and squandering the money which they had
better put in the Savings' Bank, and not waste upon imitations of the
dress of their betters, because letting such people go to fortune-tellers
does more harm than good; but as to saying that a lady who consults
a fortune-teller is on that account a fool, or the poor old woman ought
to be sent to prison, that is just one of the pieces of impertinence and
*. on the part of men which make me so angry that I could
throw things about the room.”
“Yours, affectionately,
“Tuesday.” * MARY ANN.”
* Hastings is by no means a horrible place, if you get on the high part, and away
from the abominable and deleterious scents of the beach.
hi * Just so, and silence about a person is often more suspicious than talking about
lin.
* An untravelled young Englishman's joke—the Viennese park is not pronounced
prayter—but CHARLEY's wit may pass.
* Feminine effrontery. The other day you were only too proud if an occasional
letter from you were admitted. Know your station, Miss.
* We do, but not in the dialect of the Gate of Billing.

observe that this is exceedingly just and true, and CHARLEs HAMEaton basevidently
hel you to the fact and to the argument.
All shams do sºme harm, which is why Punch murders so many that he would
otherwise leave to die.
* You don't know what you believe, goosey.
* No such thing.
"What do you mean by things? Besides, Sm W. Scott believed in nothing of
the kind. NApoleon was superstitious, as all irreligious men are, the difference
between a rational and an irrational faith being thus illustrated.
'' Come, come, nonsense like this is unworthy of you, child.

* Then truth is kept for ladies, and falsehood for menials. Are you not ashamed
of yourself?
** MARY *...*. This is not merely a ridiculous letter, but one which
argues a distur state of mind. Our conviction is that you, accompanied by some
foolish matron of your acquaintance (the sooner you quarreſ the better) have been
visiting one of the impostors who pretend to tell fortunes. Prompted, secretly, by
ºur friend, the old humbug has hinted HAMERTon, and you are in the Sevent
eaven, and hence this fi of nonsense. Now, as we happen to have discovered
the real name of the gentleman you call HAMERton, and as we know that his father
has better views for him, we have written to the old man, and you will see, by the
result, , whether your witch is to be trusted. It is with pain that we make an
example of you, but it is our duty to thousands of other girls. Look out

THE LITTLE WALL OF CHINA.

having proved insufficient to
protect that interesting and
inoffensive nation from the
inroads and encroachments
of the Outside Barbarians,
another line of defences has
been recently set up in the
line of policy pursued by
the CoBDEN-and-DISRAE-
LITEs. The formation of this
structure was completed in
the lobby of the English
House of Commons, about
two o'clock, A.M., on Wed-
nesday, the 4th of March:
and strange as it may seem,
the building is alleged to
have been wholly without
plan or previous contrivance.
As is recounted to have
happened with the Archi-
tectural Atoms of the Re-
jected Addresses, certain

and stuck together for the time by a species of cohesion not in any
way to be mistaken for the mortar of a coalition, but at any rate par-
taking somewhat of the nature of a Roman—or at least Tractarian-
cement. ---
The erection of this barrier to the brutalities of the British has nºt
as yet been thought to do much credit to its builders; and it probably
jū not be able i. to stand against the battering, ram of popular
opinion. In fact, it may be questioned if the atoms” who concurred
in getting up the Little Wall of China, will not find that they have
merely made a wall for their own heads to run against.
* Note (not by Mr. GLADsroNE, but plagiarily like him). It is hoped the reader
will appreciate the subtlety of this quotation, and observe-(1), That the term
“bricks” is of course to be ironically construed: (2), That the “airy climb" was
to obtain a seat in Ministerial high places: and (3), That the “horsehair" is of
legal significance.

Mr. Croton. Don't be harsh with him, MR. PotASH.. He is but a
beginner, and our own mistakes should teach us charity for the errors
of others. I have reason, to think that the consequences in this case
mº not be precisely fatal.
Mr. Potash. Why, Sir?
Mr. Croton (smiling). What is the laudanum of commerce P
Mr. Potash. To be sure, to be sure.
Mr. Croton. Tell DAVID, however, for his instruction.
Mr. Potash. Laudanum's opium, Welshy, and opium's the milky
juice of the capsule, or seed-vessel of a poppy, evaporated and inspis-
sated by exposure to air and light, which make it dark and gummy.

long if you took real %. I am glad to tell you that the pure juice
of the poppy passes through cleverer hands than yours before it is
prepared as laudanum to be sold by gentlemen from Wales.
Mr. Potash. Yes, they cook its goose, rather. To increase its weight
they put sugar, mud, sand, powdered charcoal, soot, and pounded
poppy petals. Flour is also a ded, and potatoe farina, and all sorts of
messes, and common gums.
Mr. Croton. Spanish liquorice, too. In fact, out of twenty-three
sº examined the other day, nineteen were adulterated.
Mr. Potash. That was the gum opium, Sir; but, my eye, the pow-
dered Thirty-one samples out of forty were cooked.

there is in that jar.
David. Hur’s petrifaction.
Mr. Potash. Now there’s Jalap, my goat. An active purgative, on

Mr. Potash. We’ll bewilder hur a little more, Ipecacuanha, now.
That’s another root they adulterate, with wood fibres. In powder,
we put in tartar emetic, carbonate of lime, wheat flour, and starch. A
doctor prescribes so much ipecacuanha, meaning the original article,

A CHILD GOING A-BEGGING.
PHRENOLOGY talks of an organ of “Philoprogenitiveness,” or the
love of Children. In some heads this is . large, in others
unnaturally small. Subjoined is an advertisement which appears to be
fººd by parents of the latter class to childless people of the

The gentle blood of which these parents boast does not appear to
manifest itself in parental tenderness. Although, however, they seem
to have very little, “Philoprogenitiveness” themselves, they evidently
have an exaggerated idea of the possible strength of the feeling in
others. They consider the age of seven years, intelligence more than
ordinary, and a very musical turn, to be recommendations, on the part
of their ſittle boy, sufficient to be likely to induce some people to take
him upon their hands and charge themselves with his education and
maintenance. Who, most of our readers will exclaim, would take a

testant, may look upon an infant, who will be given up entirely to
them, as a great catch. They may be ready to jump at the chance of
proguring an addition to their respective persuasions; and may rejoice
in the purpose of training up their adopted child in the way they thi
he should go, just as persons of other sentiments please themselves in
the design of reaking a setter. The musical º; of the child will
perhaps commend it to the devotees of St. Cäcilia. Probably this
quality is hereditary. A poem of the nursery declares that—

eculiarly constituted singing birds called cuckoos. They are also
É. to another ornithological comparison, and may be said to resemble
ducks, for these fowls also object to rear their young. This conside-
ration may procure a foster-mother for the child, in the person of some
benevolent lady who may be desirous of dandling a little duck.
- PEACE AND NO PEACE.
IT may be observed that, as a rule, the Members of the Peace
Society display a most unfitting bellicosity of language. The vehe-
mence with º they have been lately, “giving it” to all who dare
to differ with them on the merits of the China question, makes us
almost tremble for the safety of our ears should the country, now
decide for carrying on the war with still increasing vigour. Were
further outrage to fe heaped upon the interesting victims of our bar-
barous brutalities, we may question if the Peace brawlers would be
able to discover words half strong enough, to give a due expressiºn to
the strength of their virtuous indignation. At any rate we doubt
any orator among them could so far repress his feelings, as to speak
with any calmness of that crash of the Celestials, which might ensue
if John Bull, were provoked to force his way into the China Shop
with a goodwill to the business. We suspect that even MR., CoBPEN,
with all his mastery of language, would in such case, find it difficult to
keep his tongue in due command, and show that, to misquote the poet,

THE MYTH OF PAN AND PAM.
LIKE to the mighty voice of yore
That cried “ É. PAN is dea
From land to land, from shore to shore,
1 *
Throughout all Europe went a roar,
Increasing as it º
A bellow of tremendoustone,
Saying “Great PAM is overthrown!”
Howevery despot did rejoice,
When broke upon his ear
The tidings of that welcome voice,
The Minister of England's choice,
The statesman tyrants fear,
Proclaiming hurled from place and power,
Now, thought they, is our day and hour !
KING BoMBA tossed aloft his crown,
Extravagant in joy,
And, catching it in coming down,
Grinned in the manner of a clown,
And capered like a boy.
His captives' chains more sweetly clanked,
Whilst on his knees his saints he thanked.
The Pope pulled off his triple hat,
And º it in his glee.
The Cardinals all danced thereat,
And some intoned Latificat,
And others Juvat me.
The Jesuits in their several climes,
Sang out in doggerel Latin rhymes.
The Russian CzAR did manifest
The most extreme delight,
Exulting in his inmost breast,
He snapped his fingers at the West,
He also took a sight.
His diadem, with gems enriched,
He likewise at the ceiling pitched.
KING CLicquot, when he heard the news,
Was overcome thereby;
His self-control it made lose,
And from his eyes glad tear-drops ooze,
For he began to cry.
And then he laughed, and then he cried
Again, with crown stuck all aside.
Ah, news too happy to be true!
Ah, transports premature!

AN EXTRAORDINARY SNUFF-BOX.
It is not sufficiently considered that many lunatics, may exist
besides those who are in confinement, and may {e going about unsus-
pected of insanity. Here is an advertisement, evidently the compo-
sition of a disordered mind, put, in a freak of madness, by some
unfortunate person, into the Times:–
Tº CABMEN.—LOST, on Friday, the 6th of March, a GOLD SNUFF-
BOX, of an oval shape, while taking a gentleman from the Horse Guards to
Connaught Terrace. Whosoever will restore the same to — —
be offered." will receive THREE POUNDS REWARD. No further reward will
oile
How far gone in frenzy a man must be, under what an extraordinary
delusion he must labour, to describe a gold snuff-box as taking a
person from place to º and getting lost whilst so, doing! There
probably existed in the distempered imagination of the advertiser a
strange jumble and confusion of snuff-box with pill-box, and the Lord
MAYon’s º coach. It is manifest that he must be in a very bad
ed, because there is not any method, even, in his º
inasmuch as he offers the ridiculous reward of three pounds for the
restoration of a golden vehicle large enough to contain a gentleman,
and addresses that, offer to cabmen. #ºf he any logical faculty re-
º: he would have offered at least three thousand pounds instead
of three.
Public safety demands that a sharp look-out should be kept for
madmen roaming at large. Strict directions have been given that any
person presenting himself with a frantic advertisement like the above
at our publishing office, shall be detained until his friends can be
sent for, or else shall be given into custody, in order to be taken
º care of. -
9 be sure the above advertisement may beahoax, intended to annoy
the individual referred to in it. If that is the case, it may perhaps be
considered ascribable rather to silliness than raving delirium.
MYSTERIOUS DONATION.
THE Newcastle Chronicle has chronicled a remarkable donation, in
stating that
“Mr. Edward Elliott, of Earsdon, Builder, has
North of England Temperance Bazaar.”
A grindstone in a bazaar seems almost as much out of place as a
piano would be in a pigsty; and the relation of temperance to grind-
stones is not obvious. Nº. of England blades are generally sharp
enough; perhaps MR. Edwarp Elliott thinks that those of the
Temperance temper are exceptions to the rule, and has sent them a
delicate hint to that effect in the shape of a grindstone, avoiding a
blunter method of rebuking their want of sharpness. Those whoma
deem this explanation far-fetched will perhaps be better satisfied wit
the hypothesis that the gift was intended to suggest to its recipients
the necessity of adding industry to temperance, as a symbol exhorting
them to put their noses to the grindstone.

TOO HARD ON THE TURF.
Your attention is invited to the following sportive observations of a
sporting character, who calls himself “ARGus:”—
“‘Can Gemma di Vergy beat Fisherman?' was asked quite as often as the pro-
bable result of the elections. The Ilsley division, who put a thousand on the
“Oxford Hero," replied in the affirmative; but there were not a few who clung to the
opinion of “Anous," that he would have to play second fiddle, and I never reco “A
Trial" since Palmes's which created more interest.”
The hundred eyes of “ARGus” seem all as one; for he writes like a
man who has a single eye to sport. We think he does the turf
injustice. A trial of race-horses is not fairly comparable with such a
trial as PALMER's. In PALMER's trial murder was in question: a horse-
race cannot be worse than an affair of roguery.
“Le Commencement de la Fin."
THERE is an old Screw who makes a practice ºf staying of every con-
tribution to any charitable cause, by saying, “No, Siri, my greed. Sir,
is, charity begins at home,”-ſhave always made a point of that, Sir!”
—“Yes,” said a Secretary, who was tired of asking him, “and that
point is a full stop—for Ilave noticed that your charity invariably
stops at the point where it begins.”

Aquaria. Well, on the whole, I should rayther say it was not.
Lactea, Dost know what pure milk contains? -
Aquaria. Yes, to be sure. Do you think I’m a Nignoramus * I
learned it at school. Milk consists of water, holding in solution casein

Aquaria (virtuous sentiments gaining sway). Yea, verily, and so I

Lactea. Is there so much to tell, my poor, penitent? Well, let me

Aquaria. Because, if we pour in such a lot of water, as I was just

Lactea. Nay, avoid vows, and cultivate resolution. Well, dear?
Aquaria. I was going to say that the water makes Skyblue, and it

Aquaria. Nay, I can tell you something of that., Out of twenty-six

Aquaria. Just so, and we sell it to the#º at from Threepence to
Fourpence a quart. And neat milk at Eightpence a barn-door gallon,

A HEART-BREAKING appeal has been made in the Times for the
liberation of an interesting little boy consigned to the dreariness of a
dungeon, and the persecution of the prison chaplain's advice, for—only
throwing stones at a railway. In fact, to throw stones at railways
is fast becoming a juvenile, mania, and threatens to supersede the
execution of Keemo King and Bobbing Around. An ingenuous youth,
ed fourteen, by name CHARLEs BRAIN wood, is brought before MR.
ARDLEY, the magistrate. CHARLEs has “deliberately hurled a
stone” at the North London train. CHARLEs was fined 20s, but not
having the money about him, was committed to gaol, to be kept at the
expense of the county, for fourteen days. We think the sentence very
incomplete... We think the bonds might in such cases be judiciously
mingled with just a taste, a smack of whipcord. There is no doubt
that CHARLEs is an impulsive, hot-headed youth. Well, we woul
prescribe the administration of a little whºlesome flogging. After
this manner should the hot-headed boy be taught, past all disproof,
how very closely extremes could meet.

A ROAR FROM THE HELVETIAN LION.
“MR. PUNCH, -
- “WERE I a guinea-pig, and not a lion, I know.you would
listen to my squeak, if uttered in the cause of truth and justice. It
is, however, a lion, the Lion of Helvetia, that would, through your
pages, make himself heard to the nations.
‘That roar, the prowling lion's Here I am!"
as your poet of solitude and the mountains, WILLIAM WoRDsworth,
wrote, shall cause even the maniac of Naples to start in his fastness of
Caserna, and make him lift his shaking hand to his head to know if
he still wears a crown, and if it be of gold, and not of straw. . .
“A week or two since, Mr. Punch, you penned an article, calling it
GESLER's HAT. From that article, as from a ºf: lºgº a
shaft at the Helvetian Lion. I will confess it, the shaft hit me. In
olden times, as told by early travellers, lions have been found slain
outright by the mortal quills, of vengeful porcupines. For, myself
Mr. Punch, although I bled a little, I am not killed. Nevertheless, f
am hurt; hurt, Sir, and must give voice to my sufferings.
“You speak of the Swiss–the sons of the mountain and the
cataract—who are made, the body-guard of tyranny and wrong at
Naples and Rome. Hirelings of homicide—pai º to the lust of
crime. Myrmidons who dip their daily bread in the blood and tears
of tortured truth. At the very words, I feel a certain twitching of
the tail; but I will not lash myself; no, Mr. Punch, I will be calm—
terribly calm. - - -
“For the liveried Swiss in the pay of the Pope and the Ogre of
Naples, I denounce them—they are no sons of Switzerland; but
thieves, renegades, wretches; abandoned of their country as of their
conscience. d the time is come that the world at large, or that
England at least, should know the exact condition of these ruffians,
who take the *::::: CAIN, and mount d. over the rack, and do
sentinel's duty while the victim of the ‘Cap of Silence' dumbly dies in
#. ... to mount with an accusing shriek against his murderer in
e next.
“Listen, Mr. Punch, to a plain tale. In former days, that is, long
before the year 1847, here existed certain capitulations between the
Neapolitan Government and some few of the Swiss Catholic Cantons,—
where of course the priests, as Riº commonly are, were potent—by
virtue, or wickedness of which capitulations aforesaid, Naples was
permitted to send enrolling agents or travelling man-trappers for the
enlistment of young Swiss who might prefer the high pay, and climate,
and maccaroni of Naples to the noble poverty, the rugged independ.
ence of the mountain-home of Switzerland.
“Other Cantons vehemently protested against this man-catchi
for the purposes of tyranny and bloodshed, but protestation ºf
they might deal in. The Cantonal Governments, having at the time
sovereign rights, used them as was to be expected—right sovereignly;
that is, in defiance and contempt of their protesting neighbours. And
so Naples continued to send her old recruiting sergeants, HoyſicIPE
and CRUELTY, to the sovereign Cantons, to enlist the slaves who, for
fº, would draw the sword with ease and despatch for any
atroclit W.
“Well, after the revision of the federal pact in 1847, and the political
regeneration consequent thereupon, it was established by law that
henceforth no capitulation or treaty—open, or secret—for man-buying
for any foreign military, service, should be permitted. Switzerland
said—this abomination shall no longer remain. If tyranny will hire
its sanguinary flunkeys, they shall depart from the land that misbegot
them, denounced and accursed. The recruiting-sergeant for the guar
of honour to the Papal gibbet or Neapolitan rack, if found in Switzer-
land, should be fined and imprisoned: like punishment was to be
visited upon the sanguinary flunkeys, themselves—and many of these,
were, at times, tracked on their road rejoicing at their preferment as
hireling goalers and turnkeys, and straightway brought back, and
sº and severely chastised. -
“Of course, Mr. Punch, §. will ask—With these virtuous restric-
tions, how comes it that Rome and Naples continue to have their
Swiss hirelings? How is it, that Bloodshed and Rapine continue to
fill, their ranks from the children of Helvetia?. Why, Sir, after this
fashion. In º and Austria proper—in Bregenz and Feld-
kirch, for instance—offices are opened for the enlistment of Roman
ruffians and Neapolitan cut-throats on hire. These offices are in the
immediate neighbourhood of the Swiss frontiers—how easy, then, is it
for the drunkard, the brawler, the good-for-nothing, the sheer idler,
the ruined gambler, the scamp of all trades, to take enlistment mone
of the recruiting-sergeants accredited by the Fisherman of Rome, an
the Gaoler of Naples?, .
“Dear Mr. Punch, believe me, that of such, and only of such, are
the soul and body guards—(how little their souls shall have been pro.
tected will be shown at the terrible season,)—of Pope PIUs and KING
feronand. For know we not the butcher by the redness of his
hands? At Naples, the Swiss guards have the highest pay, and most
indulgent licence in unlimited vice. The more brutalised the agent,
the fitter for brute service. The Christians were given to the beasts.
Patriots are flung to the Swiss |
“But Switzerland! Does she acknowledge these recreants? No:
they are her degraded, disobedient children. She has lost power over
them. They are her prodigal sons, never to be softened by remorse.
One act, I grant, Switzerland—in consideration of her own wounded
honour, smitten by parricidal hands—one act, the country might yet
in self-vindication perform. Let her immediately pronounce sentence
of civil death upon every Swiss serving at Naples or Rome. What-
ever the Swiss guards may be in the eyes of king or Pope, let them be
no other than so many living anatomies, civilly dead, in the nostrils
Switzerland. -
“I have the honour to remain, Mr. Punch,
“With every consideration,
“Lucerne, March 28.” “THE HELVETIAN LION.”

A. CRYING EVIL.
THERE are not less than 2,500 drummers in Paris–

is, the street-vendors and itinerant musicians in our blessed
Metropolis beat the Parisian drummers hollow.”
CHEAP AND NOT NICE GOVERNESSES.
THE subjoined advertisement cannot be º to by anybody
who understands and acknowledges the principle of Free Trade:–
Wºº. a lady as USEFUL COMPANION and NURSERY
GOVERNESS. She will be required to take the entire care of three children
under five years old, and to instruct the two eldest, and must be able to assist in al
kinds of needlework. No salary for the first six months. She will be received as
one of the family. Apply by letter, with every particular, to F. F., post-office,
Twickenham Common, Middlesex.
If the state of the female labour-market is such, that a young
woman is to be obtained willing to take the whole charge of three
infants, teach two of them, besides dressing, washing, and combing all
three, and continually assisting the smallest one with a pocket-hand-
kerchief; also to do an indefinite amount and variety of needlework
to perform the part of a companion, and to make herself generally useful
for her board and victuals and reception as one of a family, apparently
in needy circumstances; if a girl is to be found ready to undertake
the place of governess on these terms, there is no reason why anybody
who offers them should be particularly abused for so doing. There is
j more mean in engaging a governess than in hiring an agri-
cultural labourer at the lowest assignable figure. The parties offer the
terms at their own risk. They propose a very small remuneration, of
course, in the expectation of receiving very indifferent services.
They will not, therefore, if they are reasonable people, be surprised
to find—should the situation which they advertise be accepted—
that the instruction given to the two elder of their children, consists
principally of bad English, that the nose of the baby is generally some-
what out of joint, that the bodies of the three are affected by washing
only, in as far as they are not, concealed by clothing, and that their
heads are in a state requiring the advice of ERAs MUs WILson. They
will also lay their account with getting none of their needlework done,
of which the doing can be avoided, and that little which is done
executed with the smallest possible neatness and the least care.
Moreover, they will calculate upon disrespect and vulgarity upon the
part of the young person who, at the price tendered by them for her
company, must necessarily prove a low companion.
'inally, they will be quite prepared to lose her valuable services and
society, suddenly, some day, and therewith a few, or perhaps many
other matters of greater value. Of course they know that in driving
a hard bargain, they run a very considerable risk of making a bad one,
and of being laughed at by sentimental buffoons for buying in the
cheapest labour-market, and getting sold.

Great thick cravats, Prince Regent hats, and stays when dandies wore,
High collars too, and coats sky blue, watch ribbons huge of size, ..

noble costume, kilt, tall black plumes, sword, and º s; the venerable Jew, with his long

CHAP. IV.
They are gone, the Scot to the Scotch Stores,
the Jew to his cellar of diamonds, the Lord to
his House of Lords, the Merchant to his Dull-
witch or Sydnam. Two figures only linger in
the ugly Guild'hall. Her head reposes, on his
bosom, and for a moment they are as still as the
statues around them. The maiden is the first to
speak.
“You woted, ToMBOB, and are ruined.”
“I gave a plomp. Let ruin come. I woted
beside the father of SARA. We have won—
What am I?”
...A traitor,” thundered a third voice. .
They could see no one, though the lurid light
of an English sun streamed in upon the Guild-
'hall in all directions.
“Coward! thou that lurkest in darkness, you
are a liar,” cried ToyBob, uttering with enthu-
siasm that taunt of his nation. *W. are you?
Will you box?”
“Ah! for Heaven’s sake, be calm,” said SARA.
“Should the QUEEN hear you.”
“The QUEEN feasts the citizens at Bucking-
ham.” She will not be here to-day, mignonette.
And as for that evil scoundrel, whom I think-”
“HoNI soft QUI MALY PENSE,” said a silver
voice, yet full of command, and a figure glided
from behind the statue of ALDERMAN PICKFORD
(who addressed GEORGE THE FourTH in an
unexpected speech worthy DEMOSTHENEs), and
stood before the lovers. . . -
“HER MAJESTY!” exclaimed both, kneeling.
Ch.A.P. V.
The QUEEN contemplated her young subjects
for a moment, and then said,
“So, MR. ToMBob, you would defy some one?
We must see to that—eh Nemo me impune
lacessit. But my silly little Maid of Honour
spoke of ruin. Let us first see to that. Dieu et
mon Droit.”
“He woted for M. LE BARON DE ROTHscHILD,
your MAJESTY.”
“So have many thousands,” said HER MA-
JESTY, smiling.
“But they have not for a father—”
“No Pop ERY,” thundered the unseen.
“I know that voice,” said the QUEEN.
Behind the mighty and grotesque, image of
some savage warrior, bearing a staff to which
hangs a ball of spikes, a .# more tremendous
face looked down.
“MR., Spoon ER,” said the QUEEN,. “I am
surprised at you. Come down from Gog, and
come here.”

Having no sword at hand, the Sover EIGN

“Rise, SIR ToMBOB, and ask your father to
forgive the plomp wote which has made you his
superior. If he refuse, you shall be sent to
Maynoots to finish your education. So he
relents. Then ask him to your marriage with

An Atomic Theory.
FROM the number of nobodies that are returned
to Parliament, we are afraid that the next Session
may already be characterised, in the Palmer-
stonian phrase, as “A fortuitous concurrence of
atoms.” So small are some of the atoms, that it
is our belief the QUEEN will have to open Par.
liament with a microscope.

THE THREE-LEGGED STOOL.
(A NEw song.)
tº: of ano-
bleman's Three-
Legged Stool.
By which he, in-
tended to climb
up to place,
Af how in the
sequel he looked
like a fool,
When this horse-
racing nobleman
came to dis-
for rule,
Let's hearofthemo-
- bleman's Three-
Legged Stool.
§: To make it, he first
§ had to find out
-- three †.
` (To a friend of the
Turf no such
difficult thing)
And 'twas down to the Commons he went for his pegs,
And none can deny he'd the pick of the ring;
School, school, excellent school,
For props for the nobleman's Three-Legged Stool.
The first that he chose was at one time a Limb
From a tree out of Jewry, or so goes the joke;
But now a mere nondescript, su ; and slim,
A graft badly stuck on the old country oak:
Tool, tool, tricketty tool,
And here was one leg for the Three Legged Stool.
His next bit of wood it was smooth to the view,
It sprang in the soil of a Lancashire park,
Transplanted to Oxford it warped as it grew,
A.! you knew it at once by its Jesuit bark:
Pule, pule, Puseyite pule,
And here were two legs for the Three-Legged Stool.
The third he selected with Yorkshire claimed kith
Had been a good bludgeon in time that’s gone by,
But maggots from Russia got right to its }.
And what was elastic grew stubborn and dry;
Mule, mule, maggoty mule,
And here were three legs for the Three-Legged Stool.
Then joining the three by a º he denies ... .
Should be called Coalition, so let’s call it Trick, -
On his stool, now complete, my Lord scrambles, and tries
To mount into place, when—by Jove, what a kick:
Cool, cool, plaguily cool,
Old PAM has kicked over the Three-Leggèd Stool.
And down came the nobleman won on the floor!
And each of the legs it flew off like a shot,
“If Oxford and Bucks the first two should restore
Return the third leg,” cries old Yorkshire, *iºiſ not ;”
Fool, fool, Faction’s a fool; , .
LORD DERBY goes limping, and lame is his Stool.
LONDON IN THE WASH.
It is not often we feel, called upon to offer our advice to the Geo-
graphical Society, for their proceedings generally are such as meet with
our entire satisfaction, We would suggest, however, that at their
next meeting, the Civil Service Commissioners should be invited to
attend, with a view of giving further details as to the discoveries which
have been lately made under their auspices, and brought before their
notice. We learn from their report just published, that among the
gifted candidates who have been recently examined, there are some
who have discovered the Alps to be
“In Hungary, Swansea at Norwich, London in the Wash, Marseilles on the
Rhine, and Germany in the Caspian Sea, who find tho Thames to rise in the
German Ocean, and the River Cary to flow by Taunton into the Mediterranean.”
These are all of them most interesting discoveries; but that which,
as Cockneys, most excites our wonder, is to hear that London is really
grace?
Rule, rule, eager.
in the Wash. Weindeed have long felt that that is where it ought to be,
for there is hardly a square yard of housefront throughout the whole
Metropolis that does not look as if it sadly wanted scrubbing. If the
depicter of the Purple Tints of Paris were anxious to paint London
in anything like true colours, he would have to use epithets of far
deeper dye than purple: for, to say nothing of our private residences,
which when two years old appear to be begrimed with the dust of ages,
our public buildings also are so dirt-encrusted, that scarcely a vestige
of their brick or stone creation is discernible, and the statues that
adorn (?) them are as black in the face as though they had been
garotted, or were about to |. as petrified Othellos.
indeed, considering the filthy state of the outsides of our structures
the Chinese are quite justified in calling us “Outside Barbarians.”
London dirt is as tenacious as a Sheriff's officer, and it takes some-
thing more than being “washed, just washed in a shower” to at all
get rid of it. Although we should as soon expect to see a blackamoor
scrubbed white as to see clean walls in . we should certainly
. if means could be devised for sending the Metropolis periodi-
cally to the Wash. We fear, however, that were anyone to undertake
the contract, he would soon get into hot water if he touched our
yested dirts; and considering what heavy water-rates we pay for living
in uncleanness, we should continually be finding ourselves badly off for
soap, and no doubt should be frequently in great parochial doubt as to
“How to settle our accounts with the Laundress.”
EXAMINATIONS FOR COMMISSIONS IN THE ARMY.
THE following are the chief points of examination, as recommended by
the officers themselves, for the admission of youthful candidates into a
“crack.” regiment:—The candidate must know sufficient of writing
to be able to put his name to an I.O.U., and of reading to be able to
make out the playbills, and different advertisements of the various
amusements of the day; he must know enough of arithmetic to enable
him to play at unlimited loo; and proportion, inasmuch as he should
know the difference of behaviour required in addressing a gentleman
or a blackguard; as well as the use of logarithms, as practicall
applied to the multiplication of interest generally enforced by .
discounting Jews; together with the extraction of roots, as displayed
in the proper selection of the cigars mostly tendered by those gentle-
men in part payment of a bill. He must know something of billiard-
playing (all the games–French as well as English); and he should be
able to translate into the vulgar tongue certain portions of PAUL DE
Kock’s and young ALEXANDRE DUMAs’ works §. Dupont and
the Roman, d'une Femme), without the aid of any Holywell. Street
edition. If ignorant of those pure French classics, he must sing any
song that is popular at the time at the Coal Hole or Canterbury Hai'.
e must possess such an elementary knowledge of slang as most
collegians acquire; and, if called upon, he must give a specimen of
his skill in slanging a barger, or squaring with a policeman. In the
history of all i. scandalous stories, bearing upon public characters,
connected either with the legislature, church, or stage, he should be
open to such questions as the examiners may think it proper, or
improper, to put to him... In geography, he must prove an intimate ac-
uaintance with the locality of all the principal cafés, casinos, theatres,
ivans, billiard-rooms, tennis-courts, cock-pits, skittle grounds, shoot-
ing galleries, about town; and he must, also be thoroughly a fait
with the various shops where the best, cigars, beer, gloves,
clothes, boots, spurs, revolvers, dogs, are to be procured, keeping an
eye at the same time to the amount and length of credit given. In
fortification, he must be able to storm the bedroom of a brother officer,
who has retired to bed, and trace upon paper the Canterbury plan of
drawing the bed-clothes from underneath a person who is sleeping
without his knowing it. A certificate of good birth, or proofs of
having mixed in the most respectable stations of life (police, or other-
wise) will be indispensably required. The fact of being the sºn of a
tradesman, or in any way connected with trade, will be considered a
decided bar to one's entrance into the regiment. The possession of
several blood-horses, which might be advantageously exchanged with
the superior officers for horses of a less showy, but more serviceable
breed, will materially smooth the path of ihe young candidate's
admission.
Perfect on Both Sides.
“WHAT is on the other side of the Victoria medal?” was asking
a young Lion at the French Embassy. “I cannot exactly tell,” answere
PERSI:NY, “but it’s my impression that the reverse of Victoria-Cross
must be Victoria herself.”
WIT AMONGST GOVERNMENT CLERKS.
THE Admiralty is always spoken of by the facetious young gentle-
men who do the duty of Government clerks, as “OSBonne Hºuse,” in
allusion to the apartments that their friend Reft NAi occupies there.

WHOLESOME FEAST.
Jessie. “AND so, WALTER, You HAVE LITTLE PARTIES AT Your School, EH!"
Walter. “AH ! Don't we, JUST –LAST HALF THERE was CHARLEY BOGLE, AND

DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF TIME.
MANY ladies who studiously practise domestic economy
S in the kitchen, the parlour, and the drawing-room, are apt
s to neglect that matter in the boudoir. ey altogether
wº lose sight of the value of time whenever they get before
the looking-glass, where their vision is engrossed by a
more agreeable object, and their minds are ãº in
pleasing reflection. To be sure, this is not always the
case; and a bad cold in the head; a toothache accom-
panied with swelled cheeks; erysipelas of the face; inflamed
eyes, and other the like causes, will usually shorten the
length of the time consumed under ordinary circumstances
in that situation. Commonly, however, a more than suf-
ficient number of precious moments is expended by ladies,
otherwise frugal, in front of the mirror, fully to warrant
the extraction of the following paragraph from Notes and
Queries:—
“SpARE MoMENTs: A HINT To HusBANDs.-As all bonnets take, it
is admitted, five minutes to put on, and as in practice it is found that
most of them require considerably more than that time, “husbands
in waiting' will, do well to follow the example of the Chancellon
| D'Aguesseau, who, finding that his wife had always kept him waiting
a quarter of an hour after the dinner-bell had rung, resolved to devote
the time to writing a book on jurisprudence, and putting the prºject
•into execution, in course of time produced a work in four quarto
volumes."
It is not everybody who can write a book, or, if he could,
is capable of composing his thoughts sufficiently for that
#. under the irritating condition of having to wait
uring the indefinite period which a lady, when requiring
it to put on her bonnet in, five minutes. But there
is a way wherein most men might employ that tedious
interval with pleasure to themselves, and in such a manner
as apparently, and in the end, actually, to shorten it. The
expedient is that of smoking a cigar, or still better, a pipe.
The sedative fumes of the tobacco will beguile the tiresome
hour, or space of time that would, but for them, be, or
seem to be, an hour; will calm the wearied husband's
impatience; and will, in most instances, bring the lady
own-stairs as soon as, when employed out-of-doors, for a
floricultural purpose, they bring down the lady-birds from
under the leaves of the roses.
To Remove Ink-Stains.
THE speediest method is to publish a book at your own
expense. You will hate the sight of ink so, that it is
extremely doubtful whether you will ever stain your fingers
with it again.
A PARLIAMENT AND NO TALK!
HE New York Tri-
bune records the
following fact:—
“A Novel, MEETING.
—In accordance with
a previous arrange-
ment, the employés of
the American Tele-
º: Company's lines
tween Boston and
Calais, Mo., held a
meeting by Telegraph
on Tuesday evening,
the 3rd instant, at
eight o'clock, after the
business of the line was
concluded for the day.
Thirty-three offices
were represented, run-
ning over a circuit of
700 miles. Several
speeches were deli-
vered, and resolutions
[... After having
n in session for an
hour, the meeting
adjourned in great
harmony and kindly
feeling.”
Now, why couldn't 'our Parliamentary proceedings be conducted in
an equally silent manner? Do you think Cobden would unwind his h
many miles of Manchester yarns without an audience? Do you fancy
SpoonER would ; on raving for hours, when there was not a soul
present to hear him rave? And is it likely that GLADstone even,
with all his love of talking, would talk incessantly, when all that his
eloquence could possibly bring round was a dial? Now, an Electric
Parliament would remedy all the evils that verbiage at present inflicts
on the patience of the nation. A Member of Parliament would be
able to attend to his legislative duties without stirring from his
country seat. The entire business of St. Stephen's might be con-
ducted in a Telegraph Office. The whole Parliamentary staff, with
its numerous bundles of Rods and Sticks, might be effectively
cut down into a Speaker. That worthy functionary would sit in the
middle of his office, like a forewoman in a milliner's work-room,
watching the different needles º assiduously around him.
When the work was done, he would collect the stuff, and report the
result. The threads, of the yarious arguments would run into his
hands, and it would be for him to sort them. His decisions would
be final, and justly so, as he would always have the debates at his
fingers’ ends. The Prime Minister, or PRINCE ALBERT, might look
* every quarter of an hour to see that the Speaker had not fallen
asleep. - -
Under our improved plan, one great benefit would unquestionably be
gained. There would be no moise! All zoological exhibitions would be
effectually closed. Your parliamentary cocks, donkeys, and laughing
hyaenas would be peremptorily shut up, like their wooden prototypes in
a boy's Noah's-Ark. #. we see no obstacle in the way of an
Electric Parliament. It would, to a great extent, cure the absurd mania
for talking, and moreover, we do not think the speeches then would be
half so wire-drawn as they are now. Besides, every little DEMosthy NEs,
who at present is not reported, or else snubbed under the obscure cog.
nomen of an “Hon. Member,” would have the satisfaction of knowing
that his speech had gone to the length at all events of one line, and, if
e were at some distant post, it might run perhaps to the extent of
four or five lines, according to the number of wires on the different
telegraphs; whilst your DRUMMONDs and your Osborn Es, as they
indulged in their electric facetia, might flatter themselves with the
belief that they were fairly convulsing the poles with laughter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TWO LIFE-DRAMAS,
AN advertisement in the Daily News, early in this current April, had
the good fortune to attract the eye of Mr. Punch. The advertiser set
forth that parents or guardians, troubled with the care of Unruly
Children, could not do better than obtain the advice and assistance of
Himself, a married clergyman, possessed of singular fascinating power
over young people between the ages of six and twenty.
Mr. Punch has been thinking ever since about the curious interviews
which this gentleman, should he be engaged by the parties he addresses,
will have with the rising generation. A couple of these ideas have
taken the form of Imaginary Conversations, and here they are:–
Scene I.-A Wursery.
The MARRIED CLERGYMAN is hastily inducted by MAMMA, who fears to
remain a moment lest her resolution should gire way.
Mamma. That’s the bad boy, Sir, eight years old on the 11th of
July, and—(with marked intention, for her son's benefit) I heartily hope
you will bring him to a sense of his conduct. [Erit.
[MARRIED CLERGYMAN smiles blandly, and locks the door, a pro-
ceeding which gives evident dissatisfaction to YoUNG SULKY.
Married Clergyman (taking a seat). And what is your name, my
oy :
Young Sulky (after aº JACK.
Married Clergyman. A very pretty name; and JACK, you ought to be
very thankful to kind Providence and to your kind friends for giving
you such a pretty name, when many little boys run about the street
with scarcely a name to their backs. 'Can you read, JACK'?
Young Sulky (curtly). Yes, but shan’t.
Married Clergyman. Ah! Come here, JACK.
Young Sulky. Shan’t.
Married Clergyman. Ah!
[Smiles kindly, and produces a well-made birch-rod.
Young Sulky (angrily and frightened). #. tell my Mar !
[YouNG SULKY rushes at the door, but the MARRIED CLERGYMAN
der/erously intercepts him, and after a few preliminary arrange.
ments, a howling follows, which
can scarcely misinterpret.
º | | º º 1||
MMA, listening at the door,
º
º
Married Clergyman (kindly). JACK, my dear, get that book from the
table, and bring it here.
[JACK complies, and at the further demand of his friend, reads a page
exceedingly well.
Married Clergyman. Very well, indeed, JACK. You read excellently
and are a very good boy, very good. don’t think I need come an
hear you read again; but at any time that }. would like to see me,
you have only to be rude, or idle, or vulgar, and I will come with
leasure. Pick up those broken bits of birch, and put them in the
re, and then we will see MAMMA.
[The MARRIED CLERGYMAN pockets the rod, and unlocks the door,
having judiciously fumbled with the lock to give MAMMA time to
retreat, and to be coming along the passage.
Married Clergyman. My dear Madam, our young friend, John, quite
appreciates our feelings towards him, and has promised me to show
himself worthy your affection. He reads exceedingly well, and there is
WOL. XXXII.
my address, which you can ask him to read whenever you see fit. No,
no refreshment, thank you. . Goodbye, my dear John, and may you
prosper. Look, straight before you, but do not forget what is behind
—that is true wisdom. [Erit, as JACK is taken to the maternal bosom.
In singular contrast to the above is—
SCENE II.-A Drawing Room.
The MARRIED CLERGYMAN is introduced by an AUNT to a remarkably
pretty girl of nineteen years of age.
Aunt. This is Miss OBSTINATE, Sir, and I only hope that you 'm
be able to break down her wicked and º º: and j.
her what a miserable sinner she is. [Erit.
Marrºd Clºryman (laughing). Now, MARGARET, when are you going
to meet him P
sºftware. (colouring up with preat speed, and indignantly). Meet who,
lr
Married Clergyman. Say whom, next time, it is better English,
MADGE. When is it?
Margaret. I am sure I don’t know what you mean, Sir.
Married Clergyman. Pooh, pooh, MEGGUMs, don't get upon the stilts
with me. (Draws back his foot, under which, on taking his seat, he neatly
concealed a note that had fallen from MARGARET's pocket.) Do
you think I don’t know all about it. (Takes up note and reads.)
‘—moon shone sweetly down upon your glittering curls, and you
looked like a seraph in a fountain”—a profane blockhead!
Margaret. O, Sir, you have got my note. Please give it me.
Married Clergyman. I want to show it to your Aunt, MEG.
Margaret. I'm sure you would not do such an unkind and ungen-
tlemanly thing, Sir. Pray, give it me. .. -
Married Clergyman. If f do, will you listen to what I say, like a
sensible girl.
Margaret. Yes, I will. -
Married Clergyman. I’ll trust you. There’s the note. (Gives it.)
But don't have anything more to say to the writer. He only wants
your money.
Margaret...I am sure he does not. He is a gentleman to the heart.
Married Clergyman. Gentlemen to the heart don’t begin effulgence
with an i, or leave out one f. He’s a snob, I tell you.
Margaret. He’s in the Artillery, Sir. - -
Married Clergyman. All the Artillery . He's, in the Artillery
Company º and an aristocratic-looking girl like you should as
soon think of a beadle. You remind me, singularly, of my beautiful
friend, the MARCHIONEss of BLAzoNBURY, only your hair is darker
than hers. She, you know, was the belle of last season, and won the
Marquis by her smile, in which you curiously resemble her.
Margaret (looks in the glass). I am too petite. - -
Married Clergyman. Exactly the . HER MAJESTY likes in her
eeresses. She will not stand godmother to the baby of any one of a
§. height. Do you like balls?
Margaret. What should I answer to a clergyman?
Married Clergyman. The truth, my dear young lady.
Margaret. I adore them.
Married Clergyman. Don't say adore—the word is wrong, whatever
the meaning may be—I can get you tickets for the Caledonian Ball

next week—they tell me three or four young lords have wagered that
they leave the ball-room engaged men that night-silly fellows—would
your Aunt take you?
Margaret. O, she shall. --- -
Married Clergyman. Be dutiful, dear. Well, but conditionally, mind.
The tickets are given only to first class i.º.º. mix yourself up
with the Artillery Company, people who can't spell—if I promise
tickets to the Caledonian, will you drop this person? Consider what
an entanglement to be iºd with if, as is most likely, you make a
sensation at the ball. -
Margaret. There is no entanglement, Sir. - - -
Married Clergyman. Oh, yes—he sees you are an inexperienced girl
or would not have written that note, which, even as a Clergyman, i
must call insulting. -
Margaret. Do you really think so, Sir?
[The catastrophe is easily imagined, and when AUNT comes back to
say tunch, MARGARET kisses her, and the MARRIED CLERGY-
MAN remarks—
I trust, dear lady, that, with the blessing of Providence, our darling
MARGARITE will be a blessing to you. (To MARGARET.) The tickets
shall be safe—give me that note.
[He takes the note, and that night it is returned to the Artillery
Companion with an intination that kicking will follow the
sending another. So he does not send another.
And thus two Unruly Children are quelled by the fascinations of the
Married Clergyman.
“FOR THE OAK-THE BRAVE OLD OAK.”
OME ingenious neighbours of ' Mr.
Punch have invented a set of printed
labels to be stuck upon the doors of
offices, or chambers, when the occu-
* pant is away. ... They advertise forty
A yarieties of affiches, from the simple
* “Return at # to 2° to the elaborate
notification that the inmate is gone to
the House of Commons on a Railway
Bill, and may be detained all day, but
found in Committee-room, No. 156.
But even the forty announcements
fail to include some that would be
useful in the Temple and elsewhere,
and it is therefore with the view of
giving. º to a meritorious
invention that Mr. P. suggests a few
additions. E. g.:-
- - “Is having a quiet weed inside
with two fellows from the Crimea, and don't mean to be bothered.”

“Expects his cousin and her pretty nieces to lunch, and don't want
the place filled with your cigar-smoke.”
“Has i. a new French novel, and has no idea of being bored with

IR. BENTLEY.
“Dined at Greenwich yesterday

‘Did not receive your note, appointing to call to-day at a quarter to
three, to renew that bill, and i. ...; y q
“Is late with an article for Mr. Punch, and prefers finishing it to
hearing you on the Chinese question and the Derby.”
“Would not mind you, but saw Moses Isaacson walking about the
square, so keeps the door safe.”
“Is dressing to meet some nice girls at the Zoological, and you’ll
want to go too, in that seedy cut-a-way, and with the eternal button
off yºr boot.”
“Wrote you word that he is out of town, and it is very mean of you
to call and try to find out whether it is true.”
“Had your Irish friend's note, but before making your acquaintance
wants to hear at the Club whether anybody knows anything against you.”
Never, intended to get the box at the Opera for your Guys of
sisters, and don't mean to see you until it is too late to write to
MR. LUMLEY.”
Mr. Punch had an intention of patenting the above improvements
upon the original invention; but, on second thought, his generosity
over-rides his worldly wisdom, and he places them at the service of his
neighbours at the S.E. corner of Wickedness Lane.
and is lying on the bed, trying to

SPARKS FROM FLINT.
It used to be supposed that between the two eminent CHANCELLORs
DISRAELI and GLApstone there was about as little sincere affection
as between any other couple in the country, which is saying a
deal in these days. On one fearful night, in particular, in the winter
of 1852, Mr. Punch remembers with a shudder how MR. DisrAELI,
then (but only a few hours longer) a minister of the Crown, stood, on
the SPEAKER's right hand, and in Shylock attitude and in Shylock
tones did emit the most bitter, mockery of his antagonist; and how
MR. GLADstoNE then arose, and, late as was the hour, enforced the
House's attention while he tore MR. DiskAELI limb from limb, and
danced over his mangled—budget. All this is now over, righteous-
ness and peace have kissed each other, and while MR. GLADSTONE is
“to return to his natural place among the Conservatives,” no jealousy
“on the part of his §. contemporary is to hinder either from
rendering the most effectual service.”
But the mantle of DISRAELI is not hung upon a peg. It has fallen
upon shoulders eminently calculated to wear it. § GLADSTONE, in
his eagerness to damage Loºp PALMERston, has condescended to go
down into Flintshire, and deliver speeches to the Flints in favour of
his relative, SIR. S. GLYNNE. The Flints, however, were as firm as
their namesakes in the Quadrupeds, and would not be moved by the great
orator. They would not send SIR STEPHEN (Puseyite though he is)
to his namesake's chapel. But after one of MR. GLAbston E’s elaborate
addresses, a manufacturer, MR. JAMEs HALL, arose, and to the very
face of the Oxford DEMostheses, delivered a Philippic, for our know-
ledge of which we are indebted to the Oswestry Advertiser. A sample,
with the HALL mark, will suffice to show what MR. GLADSTONE caught
in Flintshire.
“Gentlemen,_This is the RIGHT Hon. Mr. GLAnsroRE, who sat in the Cabinet,
and consented to the policy that led us into the Russian war (cheers). , You recollect
the state of alarm into which the nation was thrown by the graphic and heart-
rending details of the suffering, starvation, and death of our brave troops, which
j from the immortal Russell of the times (gr. at chering, and on-cheer mºre
You recollect when MR. Roebuck moved for
a committee to inquire why the people's brave army were dying of hunger and cold,
while the people's ships were la fen with clothes and provisions within seven miles
of the scene of their disasters (cheering) Now what do you think was the conduct
of the RIGHT Hon. W. E. G. Adstone and his associates? Under a pretended
offence at Lord PALMERston's acceding to the appointment of this committee, they
left office and fled 'shame). Yes, Sir (turning to Ma. G ), whilst the honour of Eug-
land, and for aught we know, her liberties, her freedom, and domestic firesides,
upon which you have been so eloquently descanting, were trembling in the balance
—(immense cherrinº)—in the hour of your country's peril—in the hour of the nation's
need–you exemplified a total want of that leading characteristic of a great states-

have deceived her—(cheers)—and I hope and believe the time is far distant when you
will have another opportunity (oreat cheering). One grain of true patriotic courage
will out-weigh, in the estimation of the people of England, all your commanding
talents, plausibility, and powers of persuasion (loud cheers). I tell you, Sir, and in
doing so, I disclaim all feelings of personal disrespect, that you are a GREAT Politi-
CAL Coward (great cheering). I should think when you meet a man in a red coat,
who has maintained the honour of his country, you will blush in his presence cheers).
The humblest soldier who wears a Crimean medal on his manly breast, is a patriot
far above your mark (loud cheers).”
Now, MR. DISRAELI, what do you say to MR, HALL } You have
considerable, courage, but did you ever open upon an enemy in that
fashion? There is something to be learned, Sir, even in Wales.
Moreover, the oratory was successful, for a motion º: the meetin
against Mr. Givostone's candidate was unanimous y carried. Hi

DE BALLOONATICO.
NLY those who wish to
see their children all
confirmed balloonatics,
will not agree with us
that something must be
done to check the mania
for toy-balloons, which
seems to be almost as
catching as the measles.
ºvery nursery we enter
(and where is the well-
regulated child of three
years old that can exist
without its weekly look
at Punch) we find to be
half full of those thin
utta percha soap-bub-
#. which have been
dignified by, euphuists
with the title of bal.
loons. One can scarcely
walk three yards in any
public thoroughfare with-
out having half-a-dozen
of them flopped into one's
face, and one’s educated
ear being annoyed by the
remark that they are
“puffickly armless, and
}= hºnºx tuppence heach.”
Of their “armlessness,”
-- however, we must say we
*= have some doubt, seeing
2− = what a strong temptation
ºs- they present to any scien-
=tific infant to try experi-
ments by making, them
aërial machines. Having
the feelings of a pater-
familias, we are not with-
out some nervousnesslest
wenay near our nursemaid running down-stairs to her “missus” some fine morning,
with the º intelligence that “Oh! if you please, Mem, ere's Miss ARRIET
ave bin a blowed hout o' winder, Mem:” and as we have little wish to see our
rising generation flying off in this way, we think that while their present
symptoms ºf balloonacy continue, we shall be justified
Ill §§ them in more than usual restraint.
-- We have a great ayersion to appear as an unnaturally
stºrm parient,” and our milk of human kindness fairly
curdles at the thºught that our offspring may regardus as
the BoMBA of their nursery; but we really have some
notion of our issuing an edict, forbidding any child of ours
to play, with a balloºn, until we have devised the means to
neutralise its elevating tendency.
THE LEGION OF HONESTY.
THE French have been considered to be fertile in
inventions, and we have had credit for improving on their
ideas. Qur brilliant allies have latel . #: some-
thing which we might both imitate and improve upon. The
Prefect of Police has awarded recompenses to twenty-three
Cab-drivers for their honesty in delivering up articles left
by passengers in their vehicles. This is an example which
Sir Richarºn MAYNE might be advantageously authorised
to follow. Certificates of honesty, have also been given
to forty-one other drivers, and the names of all these
exceptional Cabmen have been posted up at all the stations
for public carriages. This is an example whereon Mr.
J9HNBULL might improve. Let certificates of honesty be
ven to all such Joint Stock Company Directors as shall
ave been proved to have deserved them, and let the
names of all those gentlemen be posted in Capel Court.

LORD PALMERSTON IN THE HANDS OF BOMBA.
LoRD PALMERSTON.—let MR. GLADSTONE rejoice—has been sold in
Naples. “A splendid engraving of his Lordship,” writes the Times
correspondent, was lately sold, with other effects, the property of
the late SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE. The portrait, like the original, was
handsomely framed; doubtless, as the poet saith, “framed to make
women false.” The picture was nominally, bought by a Modenese
purchaser; but, in reality, as Mr. Punch learns, from indisputable
sources, was bought for the KINg of NAPLEs himself, and was straight-
wº conveyed to his Majesty at Caserta. -
INg BoMBA, jumped from his sofa with a cannibal shout, when the
ortrait was laid at his feet. He then drew his sword, and for a good
ve minutes flourished it menacingly about the diplomatic head, the
smiling face of the amiable Wiscount; that—to the increasing indig-
nation of his sacred Majesty–seemed to smile the more, the closer, the
glittering steel flashed and flashed about it.
And then his Majesty roared for aqua-fortis; and at a thought—for
such articles are always at hand in the well-furnished retreat of Caserta
—the aqua-fortis was produced, and the portrait of PALMERSTON,
la lestia, laid upon the table. .
And then his Majesty, with the pommel of his sword, struck
the glass—so struck it that, it might, be shivered to pieces, and the
copper-plate lineaments of il villano lie, bare and black before him.
But the more his sacred Majesty struck, the more hard became the
glass; until at length the sword-pommel rebounded from the unflawed
crystal as from a diamond. His Majesty was amazed and puzzled.
#. was no reaching that accursed countenance, that smiled and
smiled the more, the more attempted by the sword-pommel of an
anointed king.
Whereupon, his Majesty besought advice of Monsignore DoPPIo-
volto, his episcopal confessor: and, with a thought, the priest turned
the portrait on its face; and with aº of pincers, that he had about
him—(now and then the priest had been sent on errands of mercy to
the political prisoners)—the pious man withdrew the small nails that
held the board that backed the picture. In a trice, the portrait—a
very fine engraving, in the diplomatic line manner—lay, an unprotected
piece of paper, on the table.
And then his Majesty, with a yell of satisfaction, as though he was
about to put out for ever and for ever, the very eyes of liberty, poured
ua-fortſs on the engraven orbs of HENRY LORD PALMERston; and
FNRy—to the further amazement of his anointed Majesty—only
winked and winked the more knowingly, the more defyingly.
“Al fuoco / Al fuoco /* cried his sacred Majesty; and the logs on
the royal hearth were lighted, and the engraving of HENRY LORD
PALMERSTON was laid upon the embers, but would not burn. . His
sacred Majesty poked, his confessor poked, but still—as though printed
on incombustible asbestos—the accursed piece of paper j not feed
the fire. No; still HENRY LORD PALMERSTON lay upon the logs, and
like a virgin martyr, smiled ! -
“Wood! wood! more wood!” cried his sacred Majesty; and new
logs were heaped and heaped, and red-hot pincers were applied to the
printed PALMERSTON: #. engraved Minister, nevertheless, would
not burn—would not even curl with the heat, but still lay at length,
and, as it were, defyingly, upon the logs.
So much wood was brought and piled, that at length...the windows
being shut—his sacred Majesty cried aloud for air. The old story!
—that maldetto PALMERstos always made every amiable foreign court
much too hot to hold him.
The windows were opened; and for a minute-free air rushing in-
PALMERston seemed to burn. The flames caught the pictureſ the
picture seemed, for a moment, a piece of filmy ash. But for a moment.
And then, flying from the fire, like an autumn flight of swallows, there
passed through the windows, what seemed a thousand thousand copies
of HENRY Lord PALMERston, Prime Minister of England. Where
they alighted, we know not; where they are to be found, we know not.
But this we think we know. It only depends upon his Lordship to
hang up that picture about the heart of every honest Neapolitan.
After all—and this is a sad thought—very many copies could not be
disposed of.

THE REWARD OF GOOD LIVING.
WE invite the Band of Hope—not meaning MR. BERFs-
roºp Hope, and his Puseyite connection, but another
small tea-party, so to speak, consisting of equally nice men
—to meditate upon the following º which we are
indebted for to the Hampshire Independent:-
“Death of The oldest MAN IN LymingtoN.—on the morning of
Tuesday last, March 31st, MR. William Pitt, the old and much
respected parish clerk of Lymington, departed this life, in his 94th
year. He was a short strong-built man, fond of good living, and a
cheerful glass with a few friends, and throughout life enjoyed the
most robust health. Till within the last few months he might be seen
walking briskly along our High Street, as upright and unbending in
his gait as he was harmless and irreproachable in his conduct. Peace
to his memory."
By the example above recorded we are taught that
health, and longevity are quite compatible with a more
agreeable regimen than that of total abstinence from fer:
mented liquors. For MR. Pitt was fond of a cheerful
glass—the glass which cheers more than a cup of tea,
and inebriates not any more, if quaffed discreetly. How
many persons there are, who, restricting themselves.en-
tirely to slops, are cut ºff in the prime of life, if such lives
as theirs have any prime, or come to an untimely end!
whereas, here is a man who indulged in conviviality, and
not merely lived to threescore-and-ten, or barely to four-
score, but nearly attained to the age of a hundred, and
died a fine old gentleman.

“The ancient and Royal Charities of Maunday Thursday were dis-
tributed yesterday to 38 Maunday men and 38 Maunday women, with
the customary formalities in Whitehall Chapel. The number of each
sex corresponds with the age of HER Majesty."
The fact mentioned in the last sentence of the above
paragraph, would obviously º if any such suggestion

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS. JONES'S MODEL OMNIBUS.
“MY DEAR AUNT, “London, April, 1857.
- “You will be glad to hear that London is now in course of
.# actually supplied with convenient Omnibuses—vehicles which
ou have often expressed so earnest a longing for, and wherein, as you
ave always said on those occasions, one can sit without being squeezed
and scrunged almost to death, and can ride with comfort to one's poor
old bones. Six of these conveyances have been already started, and
the proprietors—a public company—are having others built as fast as
ossible; so that, when next you come to Town, you will, no doubt,
ind plenty of them º to take you to the Bank and to St. Paul's
Churchyard, and may, therefore, expect to have your customary jour-
neys to those places greatly smoothed. These carriages, Aunt, are
called “Saloon Omnibuses”—“Saloon,’ observe, if you please; two
syllables: not, “Sloon.” They are, of course, much larger than the
common omnibuses; so that they afford sufficient space, not only for
a lady of ample proportions, but also for her bundle, her bandbox, her
umbrella, her pattens, and the parcels which she has, perhaps, pur:
chased, at the grocer's and the linendraper's. Inside, they are fitted
up in the style of a first-class railway carriage, and there is no crowding
and crushing—precisely that blessed arrangement that you have ever
desired on icº; of them as knows what it is to suffer from they
laguy corns and bunions. So considerately have those excrescences
een provided for, that people can walk from one end to the other of
the {. without even touching other people, not to say without
hitching their feet in your gown, and tearing it, or trampling upon it
with their nasty dirty boots. Two, bell-pulls enable you to communi-
cate with both, the conductor and the driver, instead of employing
your voice for that purpose, or using your umbrella. By the way, if
that little encumbrance happens to be dripping wet, there is a stand
where you can put it, to §. into that, in place of moistening your
right or left hand neighbour. In what they call the coupé, you can sit
apart from the other passengers, if their looks are disagreeable or im;
|. or if they make you narvous. You are well ventilated, which will
e a great thing for you on a sweltry day, and at night you are lighted
well enough to enable you to read your }. No advertisements are
to be allowed in the Saloon Omnibuses; thus a #". temptation will
be removed out of your way, and the omnibus will take you in only to
carry you, and not by deluding you with puffs. The outside arrange-
ments of course do not concern you, and you may not care to be told
that there is a comfortable seat overhead; but you will be gratified by
the information that the means of getting up there are easy, so that
the nuisance of men clambering on the roof is abolished. It may be a
satisfaction to you to know that these omnibuses have been approved
of by SIR. Richard MAYNE and the Police authorities; but when I
tell you that they have also met with the approbation of the LoRD
MAYor and the LADY MAYoREss, you will feeſ a perfect confidence in
them. They came out, as I think you would express it, on the Thurs.
day, afore Good Friday as ever was; first they went in procession,
loaded inside and out, to Scotland Yard, and then proceeded to the
Mansion House, where the Lord MAYoR ald his , not only, as I
said, signified their approbation of them, but were so much pleased
with them that they invited the chairman and other members of the
company to lunch; naturally looking upon a spacious omnibus as a
very great boon to the Aldermen and Corporation at large. I expect,
my dear Aunt, that in the construction and appointments of these
conveyances you will find little, if anything, to worrit you, and to
occasion you, on your return from an expedition in one of them, to
pronounce the imprecation of ‘Drat they omnibuses!' I trust, too,
that civility on the part of the driver and conductor will be secured by
adequate provisions; so that you will never be unfeelingly invited to
º in’ as if jumping were not out of the question for you—by
the disrespectful appellation of “Old 'ooman.” . A volume of letters on
the subject of behaviour was once composed by a polite nobleman.
Perhaps the servants of the company will be required to pass an
examination in that work, or else in a more recent publication entitled
Hints on Etiquette. In conclusion, my dear †.. me express the
hope, that the prospect of omnibus accommodation will tempt you
to come up shortly to town, and see your expectant Nephew,
“JACOB Jon Es.”
“P.S.–I should not recommend you to *} it 'in an old stocking.
I can find you a better investment than that.—J. J.”
Historical Saying.
“Look at those brave English Troops! See how firm, they stand!
On my word, they are like carpets–not only true to their colours,
but, by Jove, they never know when they’re beaten!”—NAPOLEON

INscRIPTION FOR BUBBLE BANKs,—“No money returned.”
ELEGY ON GREENWICH FAIR.
YE rogues and thieves, it little grieves
Me, that I’ve to declare,
A fact your set will much regret
The end of Greenwich Fair.
That monstrous bore exists no more,
This year, it up was done,
'Tis gone—'tis fled, for ever dead,
The fair and all its fun.
Of fun what lack"—'twas down the back
To scratch the larking gents,
With toy that made to sportive blade
His coat seem torn in rents.
The showman's clown, used up, cast down,
Tº i. Millî . hº
le harlequin with ghastly grin,
Looked pitiably sad.
The dancing-booths with dreary youths
And wretched women teemed,
Who danced in gloom, and in the fume
Qf bad tobacco steamed;
A brutal crew to hear or view,
From whom you, loathing, shrunk;
Of whom to say the best we may,
The whole of them were drunk.
And Greenwich town was upside down,
Turned by a roaring mob;
A crowded mass of human ass,
Trull, ruffian, scoundrel, snob.
Now Greenwich blest will be with rest,
And all good people there,
Rejoiced have been that they have seen,
An end of Greenwich Fair.
The Oldest Error on Record.
THE invention of Gunpowder has generally been attributed to the
Chinese. This must be an error—our stupid historians meant surely
to say “Gunpowder-Tea?”
EDUCATION.—“Yes, Sir,” ſº an obtuse Alderman, who had been
conversing with a wonderful Professor on the above subject), “it’s
perfectly true memory may make a Learned Pig; but to my mind, Sir,
you can't stuff him better than with onions.”

THE CHAIR OF THE DOUBTER.
A FATAL present, as we must even consider it, has been made to
the magistrates of the county of Derby. They are now in possession
—the thing is “for their use in the County-Hall”—of Lord ELDoN's
“judgment-seat; ” of the Chair of the Doubter! A brass-plate tells
the whole story:—
“This Chair was the judgment-seat of the Lord CHANCEllor ELDon, in Lincoln’s-
Inn-Hall, during the many years that he held the Great Seal, and is the one deli-
neated in the portraits of that most eminent Judge,” &c. &c.
The brass-plate that, with faithful legal verbosity, tells the history of
the “judgment-seat,” with its last delivery to the county magistrates
of Derby, the brass-plate (the fact is not mentioned) is the converted
metal of a coffin-plate of a suitor who died in Chancery; and who, at
his death, had just sufficient means to purchase the little metal tablet
that told of his deliverance from the anxieties of this world, those
of Lincoln’s-Inn-Hall included. However, the Chair of John THE
DoubleR, being now in the County Court of Derby, it is needful that,
as vigilant watchers of the º: welfare, we call the attention of the W
t
Derby i. especially to the likely influences of the ominous present
upºn the administration of equity and justice in the county at large.
How does CowLEY apostrophise the chair made out of “the reliques
of SIR FRANCIs DRAKE's Ship” that went round the world! There
was vitality, motion, magic in the seat. Once in it, and it was again
a ship cutting “the burning line.” And so—
“Prythee, good pilot, take heed what you do,
And fail not to touch at Peru:
With gold there the vessel we'll store,
And never, and never be poor,
And never be poor any more.”
We say, we much fear the influence of this old arm-chair removed
from Lincoln’s-Inn-Hall e much fear that a simple county magis-
trate; once placed in it, the seat, so to speak, will get into his head.
We know of what dubious, twilight thoughts may arise there, as
WoRDsworth says, “by natural ascension.” For let us only think of
the world as it was—of this, England as it winked and maindered—
whilst Lond, ELPQN filled the judgment-seat, whilst LoRD ELD9N sat
upon the neck of Equity like the Old Man of the Sea upon Sinbad.
What were the doubts that did and did not possess the judge in that
seat, in Lincoln’s-Inn-Hall? Did he ever doubt the purity, the
patriotism of GEORGE THE Fourth P Did he ever doubt the
orthodoxy of the chaste DUKE of York, the apostolical Bishop of
in his belief in the virtues of the king's brother? Did he ever doubt
the righteousness, the justice of dropping the PRINCEss QF WALEs in
loyal duty to that first gentleman, her husband? We take it no such
doubts ever stirred beneath the horse-hair of that conscientious man,
fixed in the judgment-seat. Doubts, however, did come; who can
doubt them? For, at that time, England began to be astir with
sedition. Impiety and wickedness were abroad, and when laid by the
heels, did nevertheless defy LoRD ELLENBoRough from the dock.
And then, possibly, John Lord ELDoN doubted whether Habeas
Corpºs ought not to be for ever suspended; whether HoNE ought not
to have been hanged, and whether a clamorous Scotchman named
Brough AM ought not somehow to be for ever and for ever crushed
and dumfounded. When the Duke of York was laid in St. George's
Chapel, did not Lord ELDoN doubt whether the Sun of Protestant
º was not for ever set in the scarlet sea of Rome; though
himself resolving to survive, if possible, and watch the horrible conse-
quence; to which end, whilst the Defender of the Protestant faith was
lowered into the vault, did not the astute John Lond Elpox, warned
by the mortal coldness of the chapel flags, stand upon his hat?
“At sea there's but a plank they say
"Twixt sailors and annihilation;
A Hat that awful moment lay
"Twixt Ireland and Emancipation."
Now, this chair, this seat of a quarter-of-a-century, of doubt, this
chair of the once Chancellor, John Lord ELDox, placed at the disposal
of the county magistrates of Derby, will so oppress, so mystify the
judicial head with arising doubts, that we much question whether
arbitration will ever succeed to evidence. With ELDon's judgment-
seat in the county Court of Derby, we advise all men and women who
would litigate, mutually to embrace; for though they may bring a
grievance only a week old into court, we fear it will be solong doubted
upon, that it will outlive the oldest suit yet known in Lincoln’s-Inn-
all. We so strongly feel the possibility of the evil influences of this
Chair, that we are convinced no Derby magistrate will be able to sit
in it for a single morning, without for ever after doubting whether he
sits upon his head, or quite the contrary.

ceptions, and to assure him that he is perfectly right, that the points
he has mentioned are those which have stirred the nationso enormously,
and that its palpitation is still caused by the considerations, he
raises, coupled with the even more absorbing and maddening questions
of the Sound Dues, the rumoured resignation of Lord CANNING,
the stoppage of Holborn, owing to the new paving.
CLERGYMEN OF ALT, COLOURS.
WE do not like blue clergymen; yellow clergymen; pink clergymen.
e look upon them as rather monstrous. Nevertheless, such many-
coloured pastors have abounded at the late elections; the reverend
gentlemen “giving out” candidates from the hustings, as . would
ive out the morning, lessons from the pulpit. If these worthy men
eel such unconquerable interest in their party friends, why do they
not in the P. of their homes, offer up a small prayer for them?
Why should they come and stick figurative ribbons in their beavers:
aS i. men were to be “shovelled ” into Parliament by benefit of
clergy? A correspondent in the Times gives the names of no fewer
than thirteen parsons; and all of them, dropping manna from the
. all of them talking honey with, of course, not so much as a
single locust, in favour of the tadpole senators they propose for mature
frogs. The Times writer calls this visitation of election parsons “a
º read evil.” We rather incline to think it the very worst sort of
eWer.

Civil and Religious Bigamy.
MR. JUSTICE WILLEs, in sentencing a bigamist, the other day, told
him that not only had he wronged two women, “but had profaned, a
religious ceremony,” and, therefore, the Judge gave him two, months
per wife. Bigamists will find it to their advan to eschew the
service that begins with “Dearly beloved,” and ends with “Amaze-
ment,” and to marry before the #.

THE REVIVAL OF WITCHCRAFT.
TUNE–" The Good Old Days of Adam and Eve.”
A few folks now are very clever,
But many are just as great fools as ever:
Continue in a gross condition
Of ignorance and superstition.
Even now there are respectable farmers
Believing in wizards, and witches, and charmers.
Oh no! oh no! we need not grieve
For the good old days of ADAM and Eve.
inst their faith 'tis vain to battle.
They think their wives and children, cattle,
Their cocks and hens, their horses and asses–
For all the enlightenment of the masses—
Bewitched, enchanted, and bed-ridden
By crones who practise arts forbidden:
And when they see them mumble and mutter,
Believe they have cursed their cheese and butter.
No no, my friends, we need not grieve
For the good old days of ADAM and EVE.
When at night they hear the winds loud blowing,
Their heifers, calves, and oxen lowing,
Cackling geese, and horses neighing,
§. pigs and donkeys braying,
atch-dogs howling, babies squalling,
Toms and tabbies caterwauling,
The din they fancy caused by witches, , . .
Who damage their wealth and destroy their riches.
Oh no, my friends, we cannot grieve
For the good old days of ADAM and Eve.
Tales they tell, which you may swallow,
How a fiery dog did their dog follow,
Who presently stopped and put his tongue out
Of his mouth which half a yard long hung out;
And how they heard all kinds of knocking,
And other noises equally shocking:
Quote KING JAMEs their faith’s defender,
And cite in proof the Witch of Endor.
No, no, indeed, we should not grieve
For the good old days of ADAM and Eve.
They want to doom old women to slaughter,
{.. pretence of Trial by Water,
And in their heads they cherish the maggot
That we ought to return to fire aud º:
Burn the witches, and hang the wizards,
Who stick so firmly in their gizzards.
Their minds' eye still sees beldams gliding
About by night, on broomsticks riding.
So them, you see, we need not grieve
For the good old days of ADAM and Eve.
Old wives, whom they’d consign to ducking,
Have warts and moles by imps for sucking,
According to their estimation,
Qf which they ask for exploration
By pins into those places sticking,
Or all such spots by needles pricking.
From a knave they buy counter-charms and riddles,
Out of their money the flats who diddles.
O sigh and mourn for good times older,
There’s little need for their upholder;
You'll therefore own we must not grieve
For the good old days of ADAM and Eve.
Not only folks in lower stations
Have faith in charms and incantations,
But many people higher rated,
Are equally infatuated :
For they believe in spirit rapping,
Through mediums somehow § tapping,
Spelling out many a precious crammer,
i. wrong and quite devoid of grammar.
Then how can anybody grieve
For the good old days of ADAM and Eve?

ANGLO-FRENCH FAMILY EXHIBITION.
THE French Government has instituted a French and
English International Fat Cattle Show, with the view of
encouraging the improvement of live-stock in, France.
This Exhibition has §§ held at º on the Seine.
Prizes, amounting to 30,000f., were offered by the Govern-
ment, to be competed for by French and English fat stock.
These circumstances were stated, and some account of the
Show in question was given in the Times of Good Friday.
In the same paper, and on the same day, the expediency
of establishing another Prize Show may have been sug-
º to the Government of Napoleon III. One of the
eading articles referred to the startling fact that, whereas
the French Census of 1846 gave an increase of the popu-
lation to the amount of 1,170,000, the last Census, for the
five years ending 1856, showed an increase of only 256,000
souls. These figures make out an evident case for the
institution, in France, of a show of live-stock, the notion
whereof was originated, not in England, but in the United
States. It can hardly be necessary to particularise the
kind of stock in question, and to advise the French
Government to get . an International Baby Show.
It is very desirable that the show should be interna-
tional, for not only have we greatly exceeded our neigh-
bours as to this stock in the comparative rate of produc-
tion, but they have sometimes made merry at our expense
on that very account. Une famille Anglaise may now
present itself to the eyes of French statesmen as some-
|thing not to be laughed at, for a different reason from that
for which it is sometimes no joke to the British pater-
familias. France would be benefited nationally, and
England individually, by the encouragement, of Baby
Shows in the former country. The liberal allotment of
prizes would increase the French Census returns, and
greatly alleviate the difficulties of particular Britons: poor
curates, and others, who are blessed, indeed, with nume-
rous children, but not exactly with the knowledge of what
to do with them.
Comfort for the Carlton.
THE Press says, in reference to the elections, “What
the Conservative party loses numerically, it gains in unity.”
We do not understand this, unless it means, that at some
contest two lean Tories have gone out and one fat Tory
has come in. If this be our contemporary's meaning, we
can have no objection to the Conservative party gaining
as much unity as it pleases “Let them have men about
them that are fat.” -

O THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ABOUT TO ASSEMBLE.-A
Gentleman who holds, and has long held, a commanding seat, is not unwilling
to take upon himself the place of Speaker. He has no aristocratic connections;
but has all his life been accustomed to look high; if he has never looked above him,
it is simply because such visual altitude is utterly impossible. He can, however,
ledge himself to impartiality of vision, never having winked at any advantage,
É. small, that presented itself for his benefit. He sleeps with ease and
despatch; having for several years sat under the REveREND MR. MUMBLECRust of
Stained windows, without any interruption to that most comforting pastor. Salary
is every object; and the service of plate forthcoming on every new parliament, for
private reasons, required with as little delay as the public service will allow.
Please to Address “ONE of THE GRAcchi,” to the Care of Mr. Punch.
*...* The natural good temper of Mr. Punch induces him to insert
the above; inasmuch as, in the pending struggle for Speakership, he
would fain not stand in the way of any worthy, however humble
individual. Nevertheless, Mr. Punch owes it to himself to declare
that he has no personal knowledge of “ONE of THE GRAccHI;” and
further, from what he has known of the modern ancients, he is gene-
rally induced to write down BRUTUs as an Anglo-Roman who bilks
his washerwoman; and MUTIUS SCAEvol.A. as a gentleman addicted to
quit his lodgings with no receipt from his landlady.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BEWITCHMENT OF LORD PALMERSTON.
HE progress of witchcraft is something
awful. It is known that a common
practice of the old sorcerers when they
wanted to injure anybody, was, to make
a figure of wax to represent the object
of their malice, and having mumbled a
certain amount of blasphemy and non-
sense over it, to thrust pins and needles
into it, and stab it with daggers. By a
confidential foreign correspondent, we
are informed that a similar piece of
magic has been attempted in a distin-
guished Russian circle at Brussels, at
the expense of the noble lord at the head
of HER MAJESTY's Government. These
people got an effigy of his Lordship con-
...i. the manner of a Guy Fawkes,
which they sprinkled with dirty water,
devoting it solemnly to the deuce by the
invocation of St. ALEXANDER NEwski. They then suspended it by the
thumbs of its gloves, and inflicted several hundred stripes with a knqut
on its back and shoulders. After that they tied the figure to a stake,
and proceeded to tar and feather it, alternating the application of the
.. with the recitation, sentence by sentence, of a panegyric over
the left on the noble original, which concludes a biographical sketch of
him in Le Nord. Their incantation thus commenced, and continued:–
“Load PALMERston is one of the least scrupulous men living.”
Here the officiating wizard dipped his brush, intº, his tarkettle and
dabbed a quantity of its contents into the vicarious PALMERSTON's face.
“He has not a real conviction, he is influenced only by the one principle of
egotism.”
Another dab of tar, slap in the chaps.
“He is no doubt popular, because he is of pure English blood."
At these words the whole company of witches and wizards set up a
diabolical yelling, and uttered the most horrible curses and impreça-
tions, and the operating magician dashed the scalding tar into the
effigy's eyes.
“He has all the faults and all the caprice of the people whom he flatters, and who
see in him the incarnation of self-confidence, and a pride truly genuine because it is
excessive.”
The nose of the figure was daubed with a quantity of the strong-
scented semi-fluid.
“LoRD PALMERston, to please them, condescends to borrow from them even their
greatest defects."
The tar-brush was again saturated and discharged, first on one ear
and then on the other.
“To-day everything is permitted to Lord PALMERston.”
The delivery of this sentence was followed by another chorus of
cursing and howling.
“Never has man done so much evil to his country as Lond PALMERSton has
done; for he has kindled against England hatreds which will be inexorable.”
The chorus was renewed, and the assembly wildly brandished their t
wands and broomsticks, and grinned and glared like so many cats mad
with fury.
“He is perhaps of an age too far advanced to see himself the awful consequences
of his policy; but if that day should ever arrive when England shall become the
victim of the world's vengeances, then most assuredly there will not be any bene:
dictions breathed upon the monument that contains LoRD PALMERston's remains."
The officiating conjuror now proceeded to the completion of his odo-
riferous process, and tarred the dummy representative of England’s
PREMIER from head to foot: after which he scattered over it a profusion
of feathers, repeating a benediction backwards. In the meanwhile the
attendant wizards and witches, forming themselves into couples, danced
solemn waltzes and polkas in their surrounding circle. Straw and faggots
were then brought, and piled about the typical victim, when they were
set on fire, an iono" Pºwerston's sympathetic substitute was
reduced to ashes amid execrations and shouts of “Amathema!”
This dark and deadly operation of the Black Art was performed in
the court-yard of a certain hotel, the known resort of Russian cabalists.
The sorcerers were all of distinguished rank, male, and female, and
among the latter were included the principal, diplomatic hags and
witches who weave their spells, and practise their enchantments in
the various Courts of Europe.

IS EATING SALMON INJURIOUS P
& THE Old Woman's Magazine pronounces
excessive” salmon-eating, and says :—
... Let us briefly sum up—1st. To take salmon late at night is excess.
“2nd. As gentlemen ºre strangely constituted, to be helped to salmon more than
once, or to partake of salmon twice a-day, is excess.
‘‘ 3rd. Indulgence by married gentlemen in salmon is excess.
“4th. More than one small thimbleful of brandy after salmon is excess
... ºth. There are certain constitutional symptoms, which, occurring in any indi-
vidual case, are criteria of excess. Coming home late is one of them. Stumbling
up-stairs is another. Putting the candle out with one's hat is a decided indication.
A call for soda-water, and a reluctance to get up, when the feverish victim wakes,
are also signs of excess, which cannot very well be mistaken. [Advantage should
always be taken of any lucid interval that may occur to administer to the patient a
good stinging lecture on the humiliating evils of eating too much salmon.]
“6th. Pickled salmon (when one .# to be at home in bed) is excess.”
t oracularly against
Qur venerable contemporary, after answering the question
“Whether Eating Salmon is injurious?” most inia; in the
affirmative, winds up by imploring “all gentlemen who are of a
nervous excitable temperament, and addicted to late hours, to abstain
from it.” It is, indeed, most singular, that men, after confessin
openly that the headache they are suffering under is to be .#
entirely to “the Salmon,” and nothing else, will still persist in par:
taking of , it! As the intoxicating qualities of that ichthyological
stimulant have been clearly demonstrated by thousands and thousands
of melancholy instances, we most earnestly desire to see the habit of
eating salmon diminish; and we entreat every Paterfamilias, who likes
to eat a hearty breakfast, or cherishes the slightest love for his wife,
to abandon the pernicious habit altogether. Let them lay our advice
to heart. Let them throw up a doubtful pleasure overnight for a
certain good the next morning. Ten years hence they will thank us,
and present, us, most likely, with a testimonial. In the mean time, as
it is, as well to counteract this largely-spreading evil as much as
possible, we propose that little tracts, of a pleasing persuasive tenour,
and with moral en ravings, be distributed at Greenwich, Blackwall,
Richmond, Crystal Palace, and all other places where the practice
most extensively prevails, proving by frightful illustrations, taken from
every grade of life, the deplorable excesses that arise from eating salmon.
A “Salmon Pledge,” also, wouldn't be a bad thing.
THIEVES AT EXETER HALL.
AN audacious attempt was made at Exeter Hall on Easter Monday,
by some dishonest wretches, to rob MR. SIMs REEVEs and other
vocalists, but it was happily defeated by the firmness of the attacked
#. who successfully resisted the rascals. The latter evinced their
isappointment by yelling and hissing, but finally went away without
obtaining what they sought. The police ought to have interfered, but
the names of several of the parties are known, and should such an
attempt be repeated, it will be easy to single them out for punishment.
Mr. Punch congratulates MR. REEVEs and his º upon their
spirited conduct, in reference, to which, Mr. Punch begs, in apparent
opposition to the meaning of the above remarks, to cry Encore.

CRITICS AND TAILORS.
RITIC sometimes makes a
reputation for others, and
yet cannot succeed in
making one for himself;
in the same way that there
are Tailors, who can dress
others to look like gentle-
men, and yet fail most sig-
nally the moment they at-
tempt to assume ... the
appearance of one then-
selves. The style of the
Tailor always will peep out!
JANUS TYPE.
It seems that a French
rinter has invented a new
ind of type, that has a
letter at each end. The
consequence of this con-
venience is, that this
double-faced . type does
double duty; for, put into
a machine constructed for
the purpose, it prints two
copies instead of one. We
are not yet informed whether the compositors receive double wages,
or at what rate the printers themselves are to be paid for printing,
according to this new form, en partie double!. It is a two ſold idea,
that ought to have emanated from the Dublin press, and, besides
saving time and labour, will present admirable advantages to such
conscientious, political writers, as, fond of playing with a question,
are in the habit of writing on both sides.
MARY ANN’S NOTIONS.
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I suppose you thought that tº. would frighten me dread-
fully by that piece of nonsense you stuck to the end of my last letter;
but, if you did, you deceived yourself most exceedingly. You know
nothing at all in the world about what you pretended to say you would
tell, and if you did, which is impossible, because there is nothing of
the kind, and is it likely now that if there was I would }. anything
about it in my letters to you to be printed for all the world and his wife
to see?—but if there was, you are much too dear an old darling to
make mischief. Are you not?' - -
“I want to write to you upon a very serious subject. I give my
general support (as Papa says) to LoRD PALMERston,” but I suppose
that he, like everybody else,” is liable to make mistakes sometimes
and besides I dare say if the truth were known he has nothing at ai
to do with it, but it is some stupid clerk in the Government offices
|. all look idiots") who has taken upon himself to do it.” At
ord PALMERston’s time of life, though I must say he looks five and
twenty years younger, but then he don’t smoke—SMOKE! (big letters
please"), he cannot be expected to attend to everything. But I mean
about making bishops. The moment a Clergyman has established a
reputation, and filled his Church quite full, and gained the hearts of
his congregation, they take him away, and make him a bishop, and we
see and hear no more of him. This has happened twice within the
last year or so to my knowledge. I need not mention names, and I
think that it is time the custom should be stopped.
“It stands to reason, my dear Mr. Punch. What on earth is the
use of a bishop? I don’t mean that, you know, but what has a bisho
to do that any stupid country curate could not do?” He comes an
reaches a charity sermon now and then, and it is a remarkable thing
ow very bad those charity sermons are," and I don't wonder they
draw so little money. The Dissenters manage much better; they send
the plates round from pew to pew in the hands of deacons and }. le
that º”. know everybody in the chapel, and can see whether
they don't give, and can say next day, ‘How mean dearly beloved
sister BRown gets with her worldly goods—she only gave us sixpence
for our dear missionaries,” and so the screw is put on (as Augustus
would say), but I was speaking of a bishop. e has to do confirma-
tions; and if he had to catechise the young ladies it would be another
matter (our curate was so modest that when we came in class he used
to sit on the corner of his table with his back to us, and ask us over
his shoulder what was our duty to our neighbour),” but this is all done
ready to the bishop's hand. Consecrating churches, too, but that is a
form. Then you will say there is the House of Lords, but if you
think that a minister of . ought to be making speeches, and
crying hear, hear, and coughing down honourable Members and all
jºi don't; besides, if you want that sort of thing, there are plent
of noisy quarrelsome clergymen who are always getting into riots wit
their #. and you might make them bishops, and let them expend
their fury upon politics.
“He was a perfectly dear man, one of the clergymen I allude to
whom the Government has made a bishop of. l. never would go to
church when I did not think he was going to preach.” Such a gentle-
man, and such a perfect manner, and a lovely voice. It was impossible
not to feel persuaded of the truths of religion when he preached, though
I dare say some glum old stupid man might have said the same words,
but who would go and listen to him, I should like to know?” He was
so earnest and affectionate, but all in perfect good taste, and never
forgot that he was a gentleman, and that he was addressing ladies.
Not that he minced matters, my dear soul; far from it; the way he
denounced the wickedness of the lower classes, and cheating trades;
men, and swearing and drunkenness about our streets, was quite awful
at times, and I only wish that the people he alluded to had been there
to profit by his exhortations, for I am sure it must have done them
good; and there ought to be ºlº built for such persons, where
they can come and be lectured, without coming, into contact with
their betters.” He looked quite like an apostle, and when you
recollect that he was an Honourable, and had been brought up with
every luxury, and I dare say might have been a Prime Minister if he
had liked, to think of his devoting himself to such dull work as
making sermons and looking after a parish (not a West-end Barish
neither) convinced me that i. must be a sincerely man." As
for the women, they were wild after him, and on the days when it was
known that he would preach everybody went, and º: had to stand
in the aisles and sit on the pulpit stairs; and when there has been a
disappointment, and he has not come, i have seen ladies leave the
church after the second lesson. He was a divine creature,” and I
say again that whoever advises LoRD PALMERston to take away such
men and make bishops of them has a great deal to answer for.
“Yours, affectionately,
“Sunday.” “MARY ANN.”

upon Government clerks.

TREASON TO THE CHURCH.
THE Chartists say that LoRD PALMERstoN's making no new Bishop
except out of an “Honourable” and Reverend (we have had three
titled hierarchs within a year) f. them hope of his church-reforming
intentions. They believe that he means to expel the Bishops from the
legislature, but desires that they should possess the titles which are
said to give them so much influence in converting the upper classes.
We trust that the aristocratic Evangelists will defeat the insidious
Bottleholder, and henceforth refuse the lawn intended, like the robe
given by Clyte MNESTRA to AGAMEMNON, for entangling the head upon
which the axe is to fall. Is PELHAM so far on his way to Norwich that
he cannot be recalled in favour of SPURGEoN ?
“Bits of Sunbeam.”
We learn that “sprinkling Gold Dust on the Hair is becoming more
and more in vogue.” We hope not; or, to a certainty we shall hear
of , Duchesses being waylaid, and—as sovereigns are, at times,
Hebraically, treated—“sweated?” for the precious particles. The
gold-dust “imparts to the hair that shining golden hue which a great
oet has said,”- (TUPPER, no doubt,)—“‘appears as though a sunbeam
had been broken into bits, and scattered among the tresses.’”. We
think there must be a little mistake as to the particular luminary,
broken into bits: for with respect to a head given to gold-dust, we
should say it was rather influenced by the moon than the sun.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FASCINATING CHRISTIAN.
T THE Inverness contest, Mr.
Punch observes that MR.
MATHEson of Ardross came
to the hustings *}
Ten solicitors, and his ad-
versary, MR. CAMPBELL of
Monzie, by only Five. The fact
biassed Mr. Punch in favour
of MR. CAMPBELL (though on
the other hand MATHEson
might plead that he was keep-
ing twice CAMPBELL’s number
of attorneys out of mischief),
but when Mr. P. came to
read the Monzie speeches, he
did not find that the relative
position of the parties was so
unequal as might be supposed.
MR. CAMPBELL, before the
* election, said:—
“I will not for one moment deny the pride and satisfaction I feel when I see
man, woman, and child, electors and non-electors, struck, as it would seem, by
some most miraculous and to me most unintelligible fascination—as it would seem
to be, where º have Fº me their hearts, as you my good friends seem to
have done. Many men, I believe, would launch forth into self-glory and foolish
expressions of worldly pride and goodness. That is not the feeling with me.”
However, a little later, the honourable candidate broke out with one
declaration worth noting:—
“GoD BE THANKED, I AM A CHRISTIAN 1"
And proceeded to prove the fact, first by declaring that DR. BowRING
was “the murderer of the Chinese women,” and secondly, by the fol:
lowing reference to his antagonist's statement that he had paired
against Maynooth instead of sitting up to vote against it.
“Such a thing as that to be said on the hustings! I could have taken that
Wh
man and shaken him as a dog would in my mouth—I § have roasted that man
alive—if I had liked.”
On the whole, therefore, Mr. Punch's readers may think that such
a Christian as MR. CAMPBELL, with five attorneys, was about a match
for a gentleman who did not proclaim his Christianity and had ten
attorneys. But the sequel proved that it was not so, the “unin-
telligible fascination” of MR. CAMPBELL gave way in the chill presence
of the poll clerks, and the Fascinating Christian of Monzie, on his next
appearance, had to say:—
“I come here a disappointed man, but I am old enough to know that disappoint-
ment must be as long as we are on the face of the earth. I am prepared for disap-
pointments, and I come with a calm, equal temperament to meet this difficult
position of a beaten, vanquished political man. I am tempted now, more and more,
to say that I come here calmly and happily, though a beaten man.'
His calmness and happiness increased by the recollection that he
had not roasted MR. MATHEson alive, the pastoral CAMPBELL has now
leisure to count his sheep, an operation heretofore, it seems, suggested
to him by some collectors of Scottish Agricultural Statistics, with the
unfortunate result of Fº their Fascinating Christian into such a
boiling rage, that he wrote a letter from Glencoe, the terrible character
whereof has thrown the massacre in that neighbourhood entirely into
eclipse, in the eyes of the Highlanders. But as by short sums we
learn to do long ones, the very slight knowledge of arithmetic required
to sum up MR. CAMPBELL’s votes may help him to perform the more
elaborate computation of his “fleecy care.”
THE MUD-FISHES.
THERE is a very ugly fish, known as the mud-fish, native to the
river Gambia; and one of these fishes was for some time an inhabitant
of the aquarium in the Crystal Palace. Well, a while ago it seems,
the fish made its escape. How, who should say? for very strange are
the resources of mud-fishes, and other things that live and fatten on
mud... The mud-fish was given up for lost, when, a few days since, it
was discovered in the large flower-fountain at the north end of the
Palace. And, behold, the mud-fish had grown twice its former size;
and there, was good cause for its magnitude, since the mud-fish, all
alone, had devoured the large quantity of gold and silver fish with
which it was stocked. . After this fashion do the mud-fishes of this
lº ºlow gold and silver, remaining no other than mud-fish to
the end
A New Tale of a Tub.
It is not generally known that when MR. D. URQUHART lectures on
the use of ift. “Turkish Bath,” he illustrates it with a lay figure of
LoRD PALMERSTON, which he takes a savage pleasure in plunging into
hot water, and towelling as hard as he possibly can.
ARMY EDUCATION.
A GENERAL.9rder, dated “Horse Guards, April 1, 1857,” has been
forwarded to Mr. Punch for publication.
QUALIFICATION OF JUNIOR OFFICERS.
To write a, distinct hand, especially upon a stamp; inasmuch as
certain estimable money-scriveners, Hebrew and Christian, have found
great difficulty in bringing to the memory and acknowledgment of the
writer his hurried autograph. It has happened that even twelve men
have been required to assist him.
To have a good coloquial knowledge of slang; in order that in any
accidental encounter with the natives, the officer and gentleman may
not have the worst of it.
To have the eye of a cat for horse-flesh.
To be able to draw at sight upon “the governor.”
To know the use of an eye-glass and pocket-mirror, and to be able
to lay, down the leading features of the ballet and the opera.
To know so much of vegetable history, as to be perfectly aware that
under no circumstances is it advisable to spell cucumber with a K.
Also a knowledge of St. George's Fields fortification, in order to
º on the outside of the works.
o consider no amount of drill a bore.
To harmonise logarithms with billiards, and to open the door of
science (if possible) with a golden latch.key.
To sketch on horse-back on the bridle thumb-mail, the more promi-
nent features of Rotten Row.
To judge of ground, and its º occupation for a handicap.
To be thºroughly acquainted with the topography of Fop's Alley;
and ºcially as relates to duels upon the principles of hair-trigger.

But where good liquor doth abound
And song as well as pot go round,

THE “CAMELLIA’’ AT EXETER HALL.
THE Lady of the Camellias has been permitted to sing at Exeter
Hall; but the audience were advised by the following very moral—
“Notice.—The Exeter Hall Committee have interdicted the publication, of an
English translation of the above programme in the form of a Book of Words !"
Whatever was wrong, was made correct—whatever was light, was
“kept dark”—by remaining in Italian. The old gentlewoman in the
comedy consents to accept the very black-tongued parrot when in-
formed that though the bird swears horribly, it can't utter one naughty
English word, but only swears in Portuguese. Now La Traviata was
only naughty in Italian. People—concluded the {...}.
know nothing of the words, and there can be no wicked significance in
mere music. The Rogue's March is not The Rogue's March without the
verse: there can be nothing wrong in mere fife and drum; and—with
no English translation--La Traviata is mere sound and fury, signifyin
so, much rent, to the Exeter Hall Committee. Such casuists woul
split the prickles of a hedgehog into hairs fine as the hair of guinea-
plgS.
A Rub for the Cloth.
CLERGYMEN should not show themselves at the hustings. Far better
for them to stop at home in their studios, and engage their innocent
minds with the “doctrine of election.”

FEARFUL PRACTICAL JOKE, PLAYED WITH A CHILD'S BALL00N UPON A SWELL,
OUDE IN THE CITY.
ThE PRINCEs of OUDE have sat at the table of the LoRD MAYor,
and been duly toasted. , MAJOR BIRD-an, Indian BIRD-‘‘ on the
part of the OUDE family,” returned thanks in a speech fragrant with
:* and flowing with “all the drowsy syrups of the East.” He
Sald-
“He believed that a new era was dawning on India, and that it was heralded by
the appearance of Indian Princes at the table of the Lord Mayor of London.”
There can be no doubt that the appearance of the PRINCEs of
OUDE at the LoRD MAYOR’s mahogany was somehow reflected like a
dawning sun upon far-off Hindostan. º LORD MAYOR himself must
have become an object of mysterious interest to BRAHMIN, and all the
aldermen have been suddenly dear to Wish Nu, The loying cup,”
of course, circled round; but wherefore was it not filled with the
water of the Ganges? Major BIRD, with a delicate double com-
pliment to MR. SHERIFF MECHI and the Stationers’ Company, next
touched upon manure and paper. Why was England so great, asked
a pundit of the suite of Oude; and another pundit made answer—
“The reason is plain, the people all work, and nothing goes to waste. The dry
bones which we throw out to the dogs is converted into manure, and produces
fresh food for man; and the rags which have served the beggar are made into paper,
on which are written the laws with which this people govern the world.”
We might add something touching the tons of gold, in the form of
manure, which we annually cast in the Thames, committing the two-
fold wickedness of waste and contamination: we might, too, speak of
the paper that carries a tax that does not º knowledge; but no,
we will not pause on these things, but with MAJOR BIRD proceed in
company with KING SoLoMon and QUEEN SHEBA.—
“They had all read how the QUEEN of SHEBA came to visit King Solomon, and
how she went away fully satisfied. He (MAJoe BIRD) trusted that the distinguished
guests of whom he was the unworthy spokesman would have the same story to tell
when they returned to their native country.”
Of course, the parallel of KING Solomon and the LoRD MAYoR is
perfect. We are, moreover, glad to know that the bill of fare, duly
translated by Major BIRD, was received and will be treasured by the
Princes, as SolomoN's Song. As for the QUEEN of SHEBA, any com.
parison with that effulgent lady is evidently the rightful property of
the QUEEN of OUDE herself; for though her Miº may have
thought it superfluous and unnecessary to bring with her apes into
England, she has not forgotten the peacocks, a sample of which was
shown in the BIRD that did such a magnificent tale unfold in honour
of his mistress. And will the QUEEN of Qupe depart, “fully
satisfied?” Well, we hope so; but we rather doubt the result. ...We
fear that such a tale is . the faltering song of a BIRD of Paradise;
yea, of Fool's Paradise.
THE SPEAKER IN REIYME.
(Being the resolution to be submitted by LoRD PALMERSTON at the
opening of Parliament.)

Sir John Bowring's Pillow.
WHEN SIR John BowRING took leave of the KING OF SIAM—(by
the way, we wish the KING or NAPLEs could be sent to be civilised b
the Siamese potentatº)—his Majesty º his visitor with a hand-
some pillow, saying, “when you are far away, and lay your head upon
this i. then think of me who gave it you.” T. illow was
stuffed with softest down, but, SIR John BowRING's “friends” in
the House, of Commons—friends, as some of them pathetically con-
fessed, of twenty years standing—have done their best to mix the
down of the pillow pretty thickly with thorns.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAR1.
THE HORSE ON THE TABLE.
THE “Dinner after the man-
ner of the Ancients,” in Pere-
grine Pickfe, is generally re-
arded as an extravagance.
'act, however,ingastronomy,
as well as other things, is
stranger than fiction. Wit-
mess the following bill of
fare, served by the firm
CHEVET, the other day, to
certain Parisian hippopha-
gists:—
Bread-soup of horse-broth;
boiled horse-flesh; ignanas
stewed in butter; dabs, with
Dutch sauce; rol-au-vents d'amourette of spinal marrow of horse;
chine of horse (filet de cheval), roasted; truffled Turkey; and pie of
horse flesh, a la mode.
Such was the banquet whereon—according to the Morning Post–
M. DE St. HILAIRE, and his disciples, lately regaled themselves. One
of these was a DR. Yvan, the astonishment of the world, who devours
all that is eatable, and, perhaps, a few things more. . This gentleman is
said to have partaken, in the course of his life, of dog, cat, monkey
rat, lizard, shark, and even to have tried leeches. Horse'leeches would
have been an appropriate garnish to his filet de cheral; or, perhaps, he
would have preferred them for a preliminary course, whereat they
might have been served under the denomination of “black-bait.”
t may be necessary to observe, that the ignana, mentioned among
the viands above specified, is not a reptile, but a Chinese root, a sort
of substitute for a potato. -
We observe, with some wonder, that M. DE ST. HILAIRE's feast did
not include toadstools, some of which are said to make an excellent
pickle; though it is too early, as yet, for most, if not all, uncultivated
º
%. horse meal of M. De St. HILAIRE and party was, we are told,
an experimental one. They may be considered to have acted logically
in trying food which nobody can well be supposed able to fancy.
The roast horse-flesh is said to have been º rich in gravy;
but the reader will naturally remark, that he would rather see his
horse running with speed than with gravy, and for a plate instead of
Ill One.
The publication of the above details will, perhaps, create serious
alarm in studs and stables, by reason of the apprehended murrain, and
the possibility that horse may be drawn upon in case of the failure |G
of beef.
Every one to his liking, for all LoRD CHESTERFIELD's objection to
that maxim. By his Lordship's leave, also, what is one man's meat is
another man's poison. DR. Johnson would, probably, have declared,
that the man who would eat horse also would eat horse-chestnuts;
and, whatever the French, may be capable of, there are, doubtless,
§: fºliºmen who could manage to get down horse without horse-
radisli.
CONSOLATION.
PUss-IN-THE-CoRNER, dear LoRD ChELSEA,
Is a very pretty game,
But it needs, as you must well see,
Players, lad, who don't run lame.
I from Brentford ran to Dover,
Seized your corner with a shout:
You from thence to mine cross'd over,
And, my dearest boy, you’re out.
The Admiralty. R. B. O.
A SAFE FORTUNE.
AN inveterate old grumbler says: “There are no women now-a-
days. Instead of women, we have towering edifices of silk, lace, and
flowers. You see a milliner's large, advertising van that sidles along
with a rustling sound, and you are told that it is a woman; but as you
cannot approach within several yards of the monster obstruction, you
cannot tell what it is beyond something that looks like an entire shop-
front put into motion with all the fº. exposed in it for sale. "I
really believe, if any showman would open an exhibition, where one
could see a woman, such as women were in my young days, when they
used to be fair, slim, slender, graceful, well-proportioned, and every:
thing that was beautiful, instead of the animated wardrobes, and
unrecognisable bundles of fine clothes, that they now are—I really
believe that an enterprising showman like that would rapidly realise a
large fortune.”
COCKS AND BULLS OF THE CALENDAR.
THE Univers has been recommending a certain St. Joseph DE
CUPERTIN to the veneration, and, we may likewise phrenolo .
say, to the marvellousness, of the credulous portion of the #.
public. About this saintly individual the Ultramontane organ relates
some bold anecdotes. St. Joseph DE CUPERTIN appears to have
beaten the most miraculous of mesmeric patients into fits. He not
only cured diseases without physic, but he could also peep into the
minds of people, and read their most secret thoughts. A misfortune
is said to have once befallen him, which, if it . befel him, might
be quoted as an example to warn saints, when attempting to convert
sinners, to keep them at a distance, or get to their windward. After a
conversation with a libertine, “he was, so to say, impregnated with an
unbearable smell, which neither lotions nor i. would remove.”
About the nature of this smell there may be some question. Many
people may * that it was an unpleasant one in the ordinary
sense of the word. But such was, probably, not the case. The scent,
º strong, was, of course, opposite to the odour of sanctity, which
is well known to have usually accompanied abstinence from soap and
water. It may, therefore, be presumed to have been some kind of
perfume: and perhaps the libertine infected and annoyed the holy man
with an intolerable fragrance of lavender-water or eau-de-Cologne.
But St. CUPERTIN was chiefly distinguished by a wonderful peculiarity
which may be called his standing miracle. The Univers says that—
“His feet ap to touch the earth with regret, and the slightest thought of
heaven, where dwelt his desires, detached from earth this body, already spiritualised:
he was often seen to rise in the air to a considerable height in presence of a crowd
silent with astonishment. The sight of a high altar, a crucifix, or an image of the
Holy Virgin, sufficed to produce this extraordinary phenomenon.”
In St. CUPERTIN, we observe a striking exemplification of the
difference between the Popish saints and our own of Exeter Hall.
The latter are all serious; whereas the former manifest an opposition
to the laws of gravity. Hence their votaries ought not to wonder if
the relation of some of their performances should excite laughter.
St. CUPERTIN has been introduced into France together with a new
Roman Liturgy—a Liturgy new at least to the French Church, to
which, therefore, the Saint is new also. He will, however, doubtless
find himself at home, among friends; of whom St. DENIs, for one
with his head under his arm, will keep him in sufficient countenance.
A LOST ART-TREASURE.
WE hope that the exhibition of statues, pictures, and curiosities,
ermanistically called Art-Treasures, about to be held at Man.
chester, will be complete in all its departments. Every phase
and era of British art especially ought, if possible, to be represented.
There is but one particular period of our native sculpture whereof but
few illustrations have been preserved, and these few are only to be
met with in the remote corners of stonemasons’ yards. It is that
which was remarkable for the production of an extraordinary statue
of his Majesty GEORGE THE Fourth, which, within the memory of
not very old men, stood crowning a not less extraordinary archi-
tectural structure at King's Cross. Where is this remarkable monu-
ment of a past age? Diligent search might yet discover it, buried,
rhaps, amid lumps of plaster of Paris, disjointed limbs of casts
from the antique, and other rubbish, on some of those numerous
statuaries' premises which impart a melancholy classical beauty to the
New Road. It ought not to be lost if it can be found. It is—or was,
if it is no more—a great deal better, in its way, than the statue of
GeoRGE THE Fourth in Trafalgar Square, in the same way; indeed,
than all our public statues: greatly exceeding the whole of them in
ludicrous expression and aesthetic force of absurdity.
THE BALLOON OF LIBERTY.
We have often wondered that the motion of advertising by means of
alloons has never occurred to any of our enterprising commercial
countrymen. It has been adopted at Venice with views, however, of
a nature superior to mercantile considerations. In the foreign corres-
pondence of the Times there appeared the other day an account of the
performance of a ballet called Bianchi e Neri, wherein the niggers
throw off their chains, and rise in insurrection, the spectacle whereof
created great excitement among the audience. The writer proceeds
to say that
“During the same afternoon an enormous tricoloured balloon was seen hovering
over the quay Degli Schiavoni."
What a hint to an enslaved population' The balloon alone would
have been significant; but with the addition of the tricolour, there
could be nomistake about the symbol... It set an example from the
skies to an *. people. It said, in the plainest of possible
figures, “Do as I have dome, RISE 1"

“GIVING THE OFFICE.”
PUNCH has a no-
tion that a yery
º gigantic Job is in
course of perpe-
Nº N tration, and he
proceeds to sound
the alarm.
These Plans for
the Government
Offices. . .
It was º
announced that
the world might
compete for the
honour of lay-
ing out Downing
Street and the
vicinity.
Particulars were
furnished to all the
world, and Two
Hundred and Fift
architects, Britis
and Foreign, set to work and prepared costly plans, which have been
sent in.
But this was done in the faith that Government was going to show
fair play. The designs were to be exhibited to the public, in order
that the best man might win. - -
Now, it seems that the judgment is to be given without reference to
the public.
And, we do not even know who are to be the Judges.
THIS WON'T DO. --- -
Into whose hands do the authorities want to job and juggle the
thing?
#., can’t want it for SIR CHARLEs TARRY, who is, or ought to
be, busy with the unfinished Houses that were to cost £i,iiO,004, and
have already cost £2,500,000.
They can't want it for the BARON MARRowFATTI, who had so re-
cently the splendid haul for the Scutari monument, and who, besides,
is not an architect.
They can't want it for the man, whoever he was, who made the
Trafalgar Square Fountains, because his remorse must long ago have
consigned him to Hades. - -
hey can’t want it for the designer of the Wellington Funeral Car
—no man has, in one life, two such chances of committing a hideous-
ness.
They can't want it for LORD JoHN RusseII, though he is understood,
in Ciceronian language, to have “tendered his high Offices” to the
Government.
Now, for whom do they want it? . .
It is not a situation in one of the Houses of Parliament, to be given
to a nobleman's butler, or a local Judgeship, to be given to a patronised
barrister, or a Commissionership to be given to a worn-out hack, or an
fxcise place to be given to a loyal voter at the hustings, or a Consul-
ship to be given to a bankrupt coal-merchant, or a Bishopric to be
given to the cadet of a family that º a Minister.
These are all matters of course, and no one would be impertinent
enough to censure the natural disposition of small patronage.
But this Plan is the largest interference with London which has
been devised since the Fire, and upon its character depends, the
question whether, for future generations, Westminster shall be a
beauty or a blotch.
Job with your butlers and bishops and coal-merchants and consuls,
but the Two Hundred and Fifty Plans must be judged fairly, and by
men who are known to be trustworthy.
Punch demands the names of the Judges.
The New Reading Room.
THE magnificent New Reading-room for the student at the British
Museum will be opened on the 8th of May; on which occasion, it is
said, MR. PANIzzi, in the handsomest way º to give a banquet
to the customary readers. The dishes will be served in alphabetical
order as far as the catalogue is at present completed. Had the whole
thing been done, the letter Z wº have been represented by a haunch
of Zebra; as it is, the banquet will be limited to ABC: namely, Ale,
Beef, and Cheese.
TO BANKS THAT FAIL.
Q. When a Bank fails, what would you call a Sovereign remedy?
A. To pay Twenty Shillings in the Pound.
HOW TO WIFED YOUNG PERSONS OF BAD HABITS.
THE Governing Council of the Canton of Berne, have just enacted
that i. men are to be prohibited from using tobacco, until they
have been confirmed... Miss Jones approves highly of this enactment,
although, she says, it may be open to the objection of turning the
young men into “confirmed smokers.” But she dearly wishes that
there was some such, regulation in England to prevent young girls
reading novels / She lays it down deliberately as her opinion, that,
what smoking is to boys, novel-reading is to girls. It turns their
brains, makes them giddy, and fills their heads with things that have no
right to be there. In fact, she doubts whether a novel—full, as they
generally are, of love, and weddings, and all such nonsense—is not far
more pernicious to a young girl, who is scarcely out of her pinafore,
than a penny º is to a boy, on whose monkey back has not yet
sprouted the tail-coat of manhood | Besides, the cigar is generally
followed by a feeling of nausea; but the novel creates an artificial
appetite, that, once raised, not all the circulating libraries in the neigh-
bourhood can fully F. A, whiskerless stripling can only smoke
a certain quantity of tobacco; but the little chit of a girl, who has
once contracted the evil habit of reading novels, will go on for hours
and hours together, and will actually take the captivating volume to
bed with her. She neglects her duties, becomes listless and moony,
robs herself of her sleep, and believes that every cab, which stops at
the door, conceals the faultless form of some enamoured ALPHöNso,
who, long loving her in secret, has come to carry her off. Miss Jones
concludes a brilliant anathema against the hameful practice by ...;
that, if she could have her way, no young lady should see a novel unt
she was married, or until she had received two or three offers, when,
it would be only fair, to conclude, that her mind had become so far
tutored in the school of the world as to be above the deleterious
influence of such sickening rubbish!
UTRAM HARUM MAWIS ACCIPE.
HANDsoME reward is hereby offered for an explan-
ation of the principles on which the Directors
of Exeter, Hall regulate their censorship. They
refused, the other day, to allow “Sally in our
Alley” to be sung in their semi-consecrated
edifice, but on Easter Monday, they permitted
“all the choicest music” from La Traviata to be
sung there. Now, in “Sally” the poet celebrates
an honest girl whom an honest lad desires to
make his wife. In La Traviata is described the
love, disease, and death, of an “unfortunate”—
the very name “a Traviata” being now commonly
used to indicate one of those u % victims of
society. The saintly Directors of Exeter Hall
consider the Harlot's Progress more fit to be pre-
sented to the jºr ublic than Marriage à la
Mode—de l'Eglise. ? Next, we want to
know why, on Easter Monday, they permitted
the Traviata words to be sung, but refused to
allow them to be printed in the programme. Do they think that
the Eye is more susceptible to unvirtuous, impressions than the Ear?
Or did they suppose that the public might, if unaided by a libretto,
take the music for that of an oratorio? On what º do they
sanction the utterance, by singers, of sentiments which they try to
hinder listeners from compre lending? Is it moral for, a vocalist
to sing words which it is immoral for an audience to hear? We
hope i. a full explanation, but, en attendant, we are in great fear
that the whole business is a sad compromise between Evangelical and
Mammonical principles. The Directors believed that there was
something wrong in the affair, but then, they receive a high rent for
the use of their hall. As good men, how they ought to rejoice that
the erection of a new Music Hall for London is likely to remove
temptation out of their way.
The Art of Omnibus Correspondence.
Innocent Old Lady. Can you tell me, if you please, Sir, how omni-
buses “correspond” together ?
Fast Young Gentleman. Why, you see, Ma'am, to write is to cor-
respond—so when one 'bus goes right in to another, they call it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ANTICIPATED CONVERSION OF DISSENTERS.
CHURCH of England Marriage is, no
doubt, a feat sometimes requiring extra-
ordinary exertion. The Church cere-
monial being a regular and established
conventional formality is too often use
for the cementing of hearts which have
nothing else to fasten them together,
and which consequently require the
united force of two or more ablebodied
clergymen to couple them. One is not
surprised, therefore, when one reads that
at such an operation, the Honourable an
Reverend has presided, “assisted”
by a lavender-gloved Reverend or two.
But it now appears that the Dissenters
also think it desirable to double the
ower of the marrying engine. We read
in a Welsh paper (save that we have
changed names):-
“At the Independent Chapel, Llansaintffraid, by the ReverEND THoMAs HUGHES,
assisted by the REveREND MoRGAN Morris of Trehowellagollen, M.R., Edward
Roberts of Penmanmaur, to JEMIMA, daughter of MR. John Jones of Llanytwch-
cwmech, Llansaintffraid."
We cannot quite understand this kind of thing. Worldly people
sometimes marry from worldly motives, as we have said, and two
#. may be wanted to solder the Hymeneal chain. But to be a
issenter, is a perpetual protestation that you are not worldly, but
other-worldly. Ergo, with Dissenters, marriage must be a spontaneous
act based upon the purest motives, and its solemnisation must be the
easiest thing in the world. Whythen are a HUGHEs and a MoRRIs wanted
for so slight a task?, Can it be that the love of display, that weakness
discoverable even in, independent as well as esta lished bosoms,
rompts Llansaintffraid Dissenters to publish to the world that they

and “D.D.,” and is altogether growing gentlemanly, wants, to drop
the stubborn Non, and to be received into the bosom of the Establish-
ment? Is it to meet Dissent half way that. LoRD PALMERSTON
appoints four Evangelical bishops in a row?, These are suspicious
signs, and the Right Reverend Bishop Punch intends to have a meeting
with his brother of Exeter upon a state of things highly calculated to
alarm those two buttresses of the Establishment.
“KNOW THYSELF.”
A GENTLEwoman named Miss DASH DASH informs the world by
advertisement that she “continues to give her graphic and interesting

be no wonder, if her most skilfully woven plans are rudely broken by those she

OBITUARY.
DIED, on Easter Monday, that terrible old nuisance, Greenwich
Fair; not a bit lamented by any one who knew it, pickpockets and
gents alone perhaps excepted. The deceased had been for many years
in a bad way, and at the last had sunk to so low a state that it was
eyident its existence must be put a stop to. For many seasons past
the deceased had been subject to attacks by the public press, and from
what had transpired in contemporary columns—those which are
devoted to Police reports especially—it was evident that the deceased
could not long be expected to survive. It may be said, therefore, that
the death was chiefly brought on by exposure; while it will generally
be admitted that it can but be regarded as a happy release.
In their reverence for the departed, a few sorrowing swell-mobsmen
are about, we understand, to raise a tombstone to its memory, on the

A CROSS FOR THE PEACE SOCIETY.
You know, brethren of the Peace Society, that a new military and naval decoration has
been instituted, under the name of the Victoria Cross, for the reward of valour displayed in
actual warfare; You know what kind of merit it is which is thus rewarded—merit of a low
kind, you will say. Too true. Yes, brethren, the merit, in truth, is that, of mere, brute
courage—the very quality which makes, dogs delight to bark and bite, and bears and lions
growland º impelled a bull, the other day, to charge a railway train right full in
the face, and between the glaring eyes of the engine, which was bearing down upon him at
full speed, in the dark. To be sure, a brave man may have some other inducement to run his
head into a cannon's mouth than that which urged the bull to dash his against the loco-
motive; but still, no doubt, the impulse is mainly the same in both cases—animal courage:
the instinct of opposition to danger stupefying the sense of danger. Certainly it is
admit that the honour is exceedingly well be-
stowed. If we had not heroes like SERJEANT
MAJoR John GRIEve of the 2nd Dragoons to cut
off our enemies' heads in case of necessity, we
should be unable, brethren, to eat, drink, sleep,
marry, give in marriage, and spin calico, with
any security.
All honour, therefore, to physical courage—
|and we ought to rejoice that it is capable of
being so cheaply rewarded., Really, the ſº
which we get a common soldier to run the risk
of death attended with the greatest pain, or of
| wounds entailing a life of the direst misery, is
very low. What should we do if there did not,
in a pretty considerable number of human minds,
exist a property of passing, on ºccasion, into a
state of excitement overpowering both the imagi-
nation and the intellect, so as to preclude the
idea of imminent lacerations and shattered limbs?
For this is a mental property necessary for the
defence of material property, when that is assailed
by means of weapons and projectiles, calculated
to cut, tear, and crush the º: body...There-
fore, brethren, let us not object to the distribu-
tion of Victoria Crosses, but, on the contrary
applaud it with the warmest enthusiasm. Aid
let us remember that, if we want to have no
more rewards for cutting heads off conferred for
some time to come, our wisest, plan will be to
maintain an efficient number of heroes in perfect
readiness, whenever they may be called upon, to
perform that feat of swordsmanship.

A REspecTED Correspondent writes to us to

* Firing a flexible tube to, and Smoking Cavendish out of your Mother's
best Silver Tea-Pot is eaccess.”
Wide “Lancet,” April, 1857.
CRINOLINE WIEWED AS A DEPOPULATING
INFLUENCE.
AMONG the causes which are cited to account for the decreasin
rate of increase of the French population, it is thought that the spre
of the Crinoline contagion is proving most injurious in its effects upon
the census. The mode now #." ing is one of such extrayagance
that it is continually demanding fresh sacrifices, and ladies have to
choose between a fine dress and a family, for no income but a Roths-
cHILD’s can provide for both. The result is, for the most part, as we
learn by the Eraminer that—
“where you would see with English habits half a dozen healthy boys and f.
walking with their parents, you see instead, in the Bois de Boulogne, a fine lady in
a handsome open carriage."
To take a broad view of the subject, we must look at the wide petti-
*coats, and the many “widths” of silk which are consumed in covering
them; and we shall see at once a proof. that the declining census has
greatly owed its decrease to this Crinolineal influence. Of course, the
wider grow the dresses the longer grow the bills which ladies have to
ay for them, and the narrower in consequence become their means of
É. . So much swelling when they are out necessitates their
pinching somewhat closely when at home; and whatever, can be done
without is given up at once as not, to be afforded...Children are not
in the fashion, and may therefore, be dispensed with; so that as the
petticoats expand, the population dwindles, and a love of a new dress
supplants that of a family. - - -
Fº census fail to bring the nation to its senses, it is obvious that
Government will have to interfere, and devise the means to check this
forced march of ºº:: which is proving a dead march to the
non-rising generation. e would º: were we consulted, that a
Censor of Crinoline should forthwith be appointed, and that the shops
of all the milliners should be under his inspection; so that no dress be
permitted of extrayagant circumference, or of such a richness of
material as might impoverish a family. It would, doubtless, much
conduce to the prosperity of Paris, were cradles, brought in fashion
and were Crinoline kicked out of it; and we should be rejoiced to hear
that coral bells and baby jumpers were, becoming there a merchandise
in more demand than air-jupons. true friends of France would
rather see a houseful there of children than of petticoats and flounces,
and at present only in the mansion of a millionnaire would there be
room enough for both.
It has been said that Frenchwomen display, universally, the best of
taste in dressing, and are, by nature, gifted with extraordinary apti-
tude for learning and avoi what is unbecoming to them. But
certainly at present they evince but little proof of this. We cannot
think it in good taste to show more love for finery than affection for a
family: nor can we regard it as becoming in a wife to so far forgether
nature, and distort her duties, as to ruin her husband by the richness
of her dresses, and in the blindness of idolatry to even sacrifice her
children to the Juggernaut of Fashion.
PROSE OF THE PULPIT.
An amusing correspondent of the Times, under the signature of
“HABITANs in Sicco. has been lately complaining of the average
uality of sermons. HABITANs IN Sicco is not content to dwell in
the dry pastures to which most flocks are limited by most pastors.
But he mistakes, or does not consider, the orthodox end and object of
sermons intended for intelligent people. The chief merit º such
sermons actually consists in their dryness. Herein they resemble the
favourite vinous beverage of so, many of those who write, or at least
deliver them. If a sermon had not that merit, no enlightened indi-
vidual would, have any in hearing it. Most persons of common
ability and education know nearly all that a clergyman has to tell
them. To them the use of a sermon is simply disciplinary. There
would be no moral effort in listening to a sermon which interested
their understanding or excited their feelings. For them, what is
called an “awakening” sermon is a mistake. The sermon ought, on
the contrary, to have a somniferous influence, to be resisted by them
as an act of duty. Then, it exercises them in patience and long-
tºns: the greater the bore the better the sermon in regard to
eill.
. If the above view of sermons is not correct, it ought to be, accord:
ing to existing arrangements. A sermon to be good, in the sense of
being eloquent, impressive, and instructive, requires perhaps rather
more ability on the part of the author than a serialſ: and how can
authorship, with oratory to boot, be º the ordinary run
of reverend gents? Nothing can be reasonably expected from them
beyond the H. titudes which you get-uttered with a peculiar intonation
for which those clergymen are chiefly remarkable who intone their
sermons only, and which may be described as a melancholy moaning,
recognised at any distance, at which it is barely audible, as the noise
of preaching.

been a somewhat fruit-
ful subject of discussion
among naturalists, but

to SAM Weir, º

views upon the matter.
It was the opinion of the
latter that the age of
asses, on the average, is
of so prolonged duration
that he questioned if the

although CUVIER ma

the donkey race as being
most conspicuously a
long-yeared species.
º friends, however,
of the ass (and the cynic
might remark that there
are few human families
which in one or other of
their members may not
claim relationship) wi
be concerned to hear that steps are being taken which will tend to shorten very
* its average existence. A paragraph just quoted from the Union informs us
that—
“In consequence of the success which has attended bringing horseflesh into use as human food
a Society has been formed at Paris for causing, the flesh of young asses to be eaten also. The
Society maintains that such meat is the most delicious in existence, and quotes the example of
MAEcENAs and CARDINAL DUPost, both distinguished gourmands, who were passionately fond of
the flesh of young asses.”
Of course, if this Society attains much influence, the longevity of donkeys will
be counted shortly with the Hessian boots and pigtails of our fathers, among the
almost fabulous traditions of the past. To please the palate of the gourmand all
asses must die young, and they no longer will enjoy that patriarchal age which,
it is believed, their flesh is heir to. If the omophagites prevail, a donkey's life
will soon become as short as is its gallop, and essays will H. written in the praise
of juicy asslings, after the manner of ELIA's Essay on Roast Pig.
Well, certainly there is no accounting for a gourmand's
tastes; and what is one man's asses' meat may be another's
oison. We must confess we have ourselves no inordinate
esire to sit down with our family to an asinine repast;
and while our friends can give us a beefs and oyster-
sauce, we shall not grumble at the lack of donkey cutlets
or stewed ass's head to follow. In fact, so long as a lamb
chop and a haunch of venison be procurable, we think that
the man who would prefer to dine off donkey, must in some
degree be regarded as a cannibal.
TESTIMONIAL TO WORKING MEN.
DURING the war, a number of artisans and artificers
were employed at the dockyards and arsenals; and to their
labours was in a great measure owing the termination of
the Russian war. Having withdrawn from their former
engagements, they found themselves, on the conclusion of
hostilities, without the means of procuring work in place
of that which Government no longer required. U.
these circumstances it was thought fit that a testimonial
should be given them for their services, and accordingly
they received one at a moment's notice in the shape of the
sack. In answer to their petition for help to emigrate,
it was intimated to them that Government would hel
them if they would help themselves. They complied §
the condition, and scraped a sum of money together; but
the Government has not been so good as its heavenlike
word. We hope that another war will not happen till these
circumstances shall have been forgotten; for they are such
as, if remembered, will hardly induce working men to
undertake public employment in a hurry. |
The Maine Liquor Law.
MR. Gough has gone into mourning for the acknowledged
failure of the Maine Liquor Law. ife writes, “The Maine
Law is a dead letter everywhere.” Drowned, like poor
Ophelia, but not of “too much water.” The fact is, tempe-
rance is a matter of education; it is not to be forced into

upon the word Tizzi too obvious for these columns, or any other.
OUR BOOTYFUL DIRECTORS,
THE, trite maxim that “Heaven will help those who help them.
selves” appears to have been borne in mind most carefully by the
Directors of those joint-stock bubbles which have lately burst in the
sunshine of publicity; for there is clearly no denying they have
“helped themselves” most liberally to all the funds within their
reach. , Purely in the way of business, and to afford the bank a means
of employing its spare cash, one Director gets it to discount his bills
for him to the tune of rather more than “If he had but a thousand
a year;” while another kindly “borrows” of it some few tens of
thousands too, paying very regularly very handsome interest—which
is the º considerate, seeing he has no idea of ever paying back the
prlincipal.
It has been pleaded “in extenuation” (a phrase which we should
rather read “in aggravation”), that trifles such as these should be
regarded purely in the light of speculations; and that as regards their
having turned out to be losing ones, it has been asserted with a spirit
of very virtuous indignation, that Directors cannot claim to be infallible,
like, Popes; . It seems to us, however, who are used to call spades
. and to speak of tricks by their right name, whether in card-
playing or otherwise, that such “speculations” are extremely near
akin to peculations, in fact that the initial S is all the difference
between them.
To profit by the lesson, and prevent as far as may be all such specu-
lations for the future (althoug , we fear, so long as fools are found
well off, for soap, there will be no end to blowing bubbles for them),
we think that shareholders would do wisely to reject all Directors of a
speculative turn of mind, supposing means to be devised by which that
mental turn could be corporeally discernible. Perhaps, too, it would
be as well if Joint-stock Companies were forced to keep an oculist
upon their staff, in order that all future candidates for a directorship
should be examined as to the straightforwardness of their views. For
instance, were it certified that, like the ghost of Banquo, any claimant
had been ascertained to “have no speculation in his eyes,” that fact
ºlor might not—be regarded as an ocular demonstration in his
avour.

FLOWERS FROM THE WEST.
THE preposterous, assertion that the inhabitants of the United
States use the English language is one which Mr. Punch has occasion-
ally to refute by quotations from the American press. The other day
he cited an instance where incomprehensibility arose from the peculiar
political slang of the country. N. he proposes to show the style in
which plain men of business discuss their affairs. The following
assage is from a New York Prices Current for the present month.
i. Mark Lane addressed in these terms:—

American Shippers. Receivers, with profound appreciation of that “Mille et une

monetary repletion, nevertheless, now anticipate a lower range of prices at seaboard,
than those hitherto current. Accommodating themselves in all probability to re-

This kind of beautiful writing has long been used in the composition
of American fashionable novels, but we were not aware, until favoured
by some Liverpool friends with the document whence it is taken,
that the luxurious corn-merchants of New York demand that their

PUNCH AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE.
THE Civil Service Gazette states that a gentleman named Wood,
holding a situation under Government, was questioned respecting a
squib º; in Punch, and that, when he found his denial was con-
sidered insufficient to clear him, he committed suicide in despair. We
doubt this story; because the heads of the Government offices must
know that very few of their subordinates are capable of writing any-
thing but a legible hand. If it is true, however, it is an evidence on
the exercise of no small amount of petty tyranny, and of a considerable
deal of mean injustice on the part of certain officials, whose position in
office may be said to be that of Jack.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE QUEEN'S
SPEECH TO THE , LADIES.
EMBERs of Parliament and
Peers of the Realm bein
about to be instructe
how they are to spend
their evenings for the next
three months, HER Most
GRAcious Majesty has
been pleased to direct that
a companion speech might
be prepared for her, in
which she should apprise
their wives and daughters
how to get rid of the nights
while consorts and papas
are prosing or sleeping for
the good of the nation.
Mr. Punch has been fa-
voured with a copy of the
QUEEN’s Speech to the
Iadies, and is informed
that in the event of HER
MAJESTY's absence at the
opening of the session, it
will be delivered by the
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN, who,
as the peer most conversant
with the topics referred to
in the address, will follow
the Lord CHANGELLOR, a
peer not supposed to be very conversant with any topic at all.
“My LADIES AND GIRLs,
“It gives me great pleasure to announce to you that besides
the usual number of balls, soirées, dancing-teas, at homes, and other
descriptions of parties with saltatory and matrimonial objects, a great
variety of public amusements will be offered to you during the season.
“At the opera-house which bears my name, you will hear a very
delightful recruit from the ranks of the church, SIGNOR GIUGLINI, a
tenor of an admirable character. That fascinating little personage,
MADEMoisell.E Piccolomin1, is again present with all her enchant-
ments, and MR. Lu MLEY, whose talent for discovering the stars of the
ballet rivals the skill of AIRY or ARAGo in ransacking the firmament,
has introduced to you a most charming danseuse, MADEMOISELLE
Poch INI, whose achievements leave nothing to be desired except that
she would perform them over again. -
“I regret to state that the vulgar selfishness of certain dogs-in-the
manger, ordinarily known as Renters, has excluded MR. G.Y.E.'s
operatic company from Drury Lane Theatre, but it may be heard in
reat force at the pretty Lyceum, where my illustrious Sister, the
§ºn of Song, reigns in superb health and unflagging vigour, sup-
ported by the illustrious MARIo, Count DI CANDIA, and by that
consummate tragedian, SIGNOR RoNCONI.
“My meritorious BALDw1N Buckston E, at the Haymarket
Theatre, offers to such of you as possess an unvitiated taste for the
drama a series of plays of an interesting character, with º
entertaining, farces, as also a burlesque, in which my English is
quaintly dealt with by the ingenious FRANKTALFor RD, and in which
you will see lº. acting and elegant appointments.
“I specially charge and command each and every of you, as
you value your. QUEEN’s good opinion, to visit MR WIGAN's theatre
in Wych Street, for the purpose of beholding MR. Robson's per-
formance as the Miser. Such extraordinary acting has not, I am
informed by universal voice, been witnessed since the days of
MR, EDMUSD, KEAN, who, I am further, informed, never displayed
enius surpassing that evinced by MR. Robson in this character.
º need not be ashamed of the tears he will elicit, as they will result
from an exercise of the highest Art, and as you will fin
audience affected in common with yourselves.
“MR. Charles KEAN has placed upon the stage of my daughter's
theatre a spectacle in which the life of a byegone age is reproduced
before you with extraordinary fidelity and splendour, and you will have
the additional advantage of hearing, in the course of the spectacle,
several well-selected passages from a noble tragedy by MR. WILLIAM
SHAksPEARE. .
“At the Adelphi Theatre, you will find that MR. BENJAMIN WEBSTER
continues to present a series of most effective dramas, constructed
upon that principle of intense interest which may be regarded as the
element .# legitimacy at his establishment; and it is, with great
pleasure that I announce to you, that this distinguished actor who
can ill be spared from the stage (at present not rich in artists),
and re-appears in a character of importance, in which you will not
fail to see him.
the entire
“My trusty MR, MITCHELL is about to re-open the St. James's
Theatre with a celebrated company of artists from the capital of my
valued ally, the EMPEROR of THE FRENCH. A series of choice ope-
rettas, to be conducted by the composer to the Théâtre des Bouffes,
M. Offenbach, will be given, and the list comprises some exceedingly
charming works. -
“I could wish that you would all take an opportunity of visiting the
only theatre where the works of MR. WILLIAM SHAkspeaRE are given
as plays. I allude to the house under the management of MR. SAMUEL
PHELPs, at Islington. The distance is trifling to those who, like your-
selves, possess the means of vehicular conveyance, and you will be
...]". rewarded in witnessing exceedingly fine acting by MR. PHELPs,
and a careful, intelligent, and judicious performance § his excellent
Cº.
“I should deplore your omitting to delight the younger branches of
your families by indulging them with an occasional visit to ASTLEy's
º: where the equestrian performances, under the direction
of MR. Cooke, are as extraordinary as ever, with the addition, as in
the exploits of Miss EMILY CookE and others, of a gracefulness which
commends itself to the cultivated eye.
“Having thus indicated to you, my Ladies and Girls, how you may
pleasantly dispose of the time while my Lords and Gentlemen are
attending to the business which I have marked out for them, it only
remains for me to express my certainty, that amusement, however
delightful, will never engross the British fº, to the neglect of her
more elevated and serious occupations, and with this hint to wish you
a series of exceedingly pleasant evenings.”
CRINOLINE IN THE STUDIO.
WF believe it is no secret in artistic circles—although not a whisper
of it has as yet been dropped in print, that the approaching Exhibition
of the Royal Academy is causing more than usual uneasiness to the
humanely-minded members of the Hanging Committee; the space at
their command, being annually the same, while each year brings new
claims to it, without much absence of the old ones, the task of its
allotment is of more and more perplexity; and the proportion of por.
traits is of such alarming increase, that the labour of rejection every
spring becomes a greater one. Moreover, it is feared }. from the
fashion of wide dresses, which has lately been persisted
“ portraits of a lady” will be found to be this year of more than
common magnitude; and as mine-tenths of those sent in are generally
of life-size, the Committee have, indeed, ample cause for apprehension.
We º that but few of those “gay beings” who have lately sat
in Crinoline to have their portraits taken have consented to be shorn of
their proportions on the canvas; and we suspect that any full-length,
or, what is more important, full-width portrait, would be found to take
up pretty nearly one whole side of any of the three large rooms of
the Academy. So that, in point of fact, were but twelve of them
admitted there would be no space to show a single other picture.
As this would, of course, be too preposterous to dream of, we would
º to the Committee, as a ſit solution of their difficulty, that they
had better not attempt to make any selection, but should exclude
alike all portraits from Trafalgar Square, and provide them elsewhere
with a place of exhibition. We are not aware precisely how many
F." will now go to the acre, but by roofing in Lord's Cricket
round, or Kennington Common, there might perhaps be found
expanse sufficient for the purpose ; and as no one ever looks at por-
traits, except, of course, the sitters and their most immediate relations,
their removal to either of the distances we speak of, would produce no
inconvenience to the general public.

may think any complaint of that part of the ceremony transacted in

SOUTHWARK AND THE BALTIC,

is belief; sustaining is
faith ! . Hence, it is
said, that among the
lectors of Southwark
are a set of believers
whose faith it is that
SIR CHARLEs’s perfect
firing, by keeping his
cutlass sharp, had the
most mischievous ef.
fects on Cronstadt, and
very sensibly hastened
the termination of the
war. When men are
! found to have faith in
| wizards, why should
there not be believers
even in SIR CHARLEs
NAPIERP
SIR CHARLEs, of
course, returned thanks
after his own way. He
had been three times
before a Southwark
constituency. On his
second appearance “he obtained the victory, without firing a shot.” . It was otherwise in
the Baltic. There, also, he had fired no shot; and, doubtless for such reason, had won no
victory; but this result, as it would appear made no difference to the idolators of Southwark.
Doubtless, had a NELsoN come among them with Trafalgar in his chaplet, he would have
been, considered ineligible by the circumstance. To some folks there is no such recom-
mendation as noisy, pig-headed imbecility.
A congratulatory address “elegantly engrossed on parchment” was presented to the
opinion that, say what if
distinguished Member: and the chairman assured
the electors that, “they had done themselves
#. credit, and had conferred great honour.”
The credit was in their choice: the honour in
the fact of representing such influence, such in-
telligence, as shown and developed by a South-
wark constituency.
SIR CHARLEs, however, gave the electors
warning. Should they again want his services
they, must, pay for them. “He would not
spend one shilling.” No; he would enter Par-
liament gratis, or he would remain in private
ife., “Return me if you please. lf you do
not”—thus ran SIR CHARLEs’s threat—“I will
take my hat off, and wish you all good morning.”
All we can say in answer to this menace is, we
think SIR CHARLEs will look admirably well
with his hat off: and for the borough of §ºi.
wark he can make no more valuable utterance,
than by saying—“good morning.”

entitled, The Philosophy % the Plays of SHAks-

by Miss BAcon, turns out to be not SHAks-

Miss BAcox's namesake of Kºi. and the
Novum Organon, and to others than the divine
WILLIAMs. Miss BAcon had better fold SHAKs-

j shut him up. #. her henceforth confine
herself to the unfolding of table cloths, and other
linen matters more fit to be unfolded by femi-
nine powers than those sheets which contain the
philosophy of SHAKSPEARE.
A GRAWE OPERATION.
A New Company advertises “Washing in
Earnest.” As if any washing could be so
serious a matter as that which constitutes an
adjunct to domestic happiness.
A NEW HANDEL SENSATION.
A CERTAIN man was born in 1684, and died in 1759.
Between those dates he achieved certain things, whereof the world
has heard, but never so nobly as it will hear of three of them in the
Crystal Palace in June next.
The man was GEORGE F. HANDEL, and the three works in question
are the oratorios of The Messiah, Israel in Egypt, and Judas Maccabaeus.
During the last ninety-eight years a good deal has been said about
these wonders in musical art, and, decidedly, it is somewhat late to
discuss them. Happily, one may now be permitted to listen in reverent
admiration, not unmixed with awe, as those giant utterances are given
forth... No one is even called upon for eloquent description of the
sensations he felt, or would be thought to have felt, when carried away
in the surging and whirling waves of the Handelian music. This is a
great comfort.
Possibly no such a series of glorious sensations has been permitted
to a multitude for the last thousand years, as a multitude, in the
right mind, may experience on the three HANDEL days, now coming.
One sensation, however-not. exactly glorious—may be felt by
thousands. . We mean the sensation of gratitude for an escape.
Take a minute between the Fº acts-take an instant when the
colossal harmony is a thing of the past, and let this thought pass
through your brain: -
This giant, this poet, this magician, this—what signifies tautology—
this HANDEL–
“Was intended for a Lawyer, but—”
There!
On , second thoughts. No. Take breath, and do not take that
thought with you into the Crystal Palace. Íño not may the magnifi-
cent pleasures of the three days by a recollection which has too much

in the mean time—at other times.
The man who composed The Messiah might have been a Lawyer!
| Will there be any Lawyers in the Palace on those days? Doubtless,
for where’s that palace, be it ne'er so wide—and so forth. And where
—at least where on earth and below it—do they not go? -
Will they have a sensation? And will it be like the sensation felt
by the earth-born horses when Pegasus, for a moment harnessed to the
manure-cart, burst his bonds, spread his wings, and flew upwards to
the Sun. The other horses, being at the work that was fit for them,
started, snorted—and pulled away at the manure-cart. -
HANDEL might have been a Lawyer! Never forget this when
tempted to ungrateful thoughts touching destiny
Monuments—We are told that every man, should leave some
monument behind him; but really after looking at the wretched stuck-
up things ed monuments, that are dotted about, London, we must
say that we see but very iittle encouragement for it; on the contrary,
we rather ire the man who, as monuments go, leaves no monument
behind him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SOCIAL TREAD-MILL.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I PROMISED to devote an entire letter to Wedding-Break-
fasts. It is not so much that these entertainments are more dreary
than the rest of the table ceremonies, under which society suffers. On
the contrary, except for the plague of i..."; they would be
rather jollier than most of our social gatherings: but, the wedding-
breakfast stands in the front-rank of the married man's experiences.
It is like those rites which used to come first in the initiation
of a novice into the ancient mysteries, or the secret-societies of the
middle-ages, in which, the greenhorn was made to run the gauntlet
of the most hideous hobgoblins, and the most startling surprises. Such
an introduction was supposed at once to caseharden the candidate's
nerves, and to test his courage. . On the same, principle one may
suppose the newly-married man is exposed to the green-grocerism,
the Gunterism, the champagne-fired enthusiasm and speechification
the stale and threadbare pleasantries, the mock sentiment, and
pinchbeck cordiality of the wedding-breakfast. . It is a quintessence,
as it were, of what he will have to go through in the future, in the
way of costly and pretentious entertainment, affected good fellowship,
and hollow gaiety. If he can stand those awful waiters—the array
of those long tables, with their spun-sugar bird-cages, and plaster:
of-Paris temples—their profusion of hig #;". pastry, forced
fruit, glacé tongues, insipid chickens, chilly galantines, and ice-
creams; if he is not sickened with the §. and does not loathe
champagne for ever after, he may be safely pronounced fit for the inner
rites of the married life of society.
“But, the performances in the mysteries will be found, on the whole,
duller than those of the initiation. The bead still dances in the
champagne of wedding-breakfasts. The liquor handed round at the
dinners, and breakfasts and suppers, of which that is the prelude, will
be found flat, insipid—dead as ditch-water. ...I always feel that there
is something significant in the general chilliness of the viands at a
wedding-breakfast. You detect a gelatinous character about the feast.
Your fun, like your fruit, is forced. The very wedding-cake has its
emblematic icing—for so, I believe, the highly decorated crust,
apparently compounded of sweetened gypsum and prussic-acid, is
styled by the confectioners. There is good fruit and aromatic spice
under that most indigestible and snowy covering, whereof none
can eat and live!. What a good and sweet, and sustaining, thing
marriage is in itself. Why do we invest it with icing?, Why iii. its
sweetness and its spices—its mixture of currants, and lemon-peel, and
its substratum of honest flour, -under a hard shell of frosty ceremonial,
flourished all over with shallow devices in confectioner's taste? Why
do we all put our necks under the heel of GUNTER: Why allow, our
simple pleasures to be dashed by the awful presence of those white-
cravatted waiters—Eumenides of the chair-back, each shadowing
forth the Nemesis of the bill to pay?
“But worse than the cold breakfast are the speeches. Which of us
has not groaned under this infliction? So far as I know, every one
admits that these, wedding-breakfast orations are an intolerable
nuisance. I don't know which of the prevailing styles of this class of
oratory is worse, the pathetic or the jocose, or the floundering,
which aims at a combination, of grave and gay; and comes to grief
between the two. There is that É.iſ. friend of the family, who
proposes the health of the young couple. Why can't he be content to
do it simply, to utter in six words of honest meaning a hearty wish that
happiness may attend them—that God may bless their union? Every
one, if appealed to, must admit you can't get beyond that: . No person
—one would suppose—who really felt a genuine regard for the pair
—or for either of them—would wish at such a time to attempt more
than a brief and fervent blessing.
“Yet here is a well-meaning Briton—no fool, probably, in his
business—not a recognised bore in common life—not an open and no-
torious humbug, hypocrite, and impostor—who ſº up to propose the
health of the newly-married couple, or the health of their respective
Papas and Mammas; and in so doing, maunders for a quarter of an hour
in a style that blends folly, tediousness, and insincerity, till you blush
for the man as you sit. My readers may have observed—ſ ºften have
—the expression of pain and shame on the countenances of the listeners
to a discourse of this class... I always long to hide my face while one
of these melancholy exhibitions is in progress. I believe, from com-
paring notes with others, that this feeling is very common.
“But worse even than this—the heavy business of the wedding-
breakfast—is its light comedy, the hide-bound pleasantry of the gentle-
man who rises to propose “the bridesmaids', and similar provocative
toasts, in what the reporters call ‘a highly humorous speech.”
“Of the many forms of social suffering I know of none worse than
sitting under one of these douches of wedding-breakfast jocoseness.
Not one Briton in a thousand can be playful on his legs—above all
not playful ertempore. He must be common-place—must stand in the
old JoE MILLER ways—must trot out the battered old hack pleasan-
tries, or he is lost. So long as the man is humble-minded enough not
to attempt anything new, one submits with a certain equanimity.
The mind is subdued to familiar forms of suffering. But the infliction
becomes terrible, when the speaker is ambitious enough, to attempt
anything original. Fear is then added to the listeners’ other suf-
ferings. There is the constant dread of a fall—of the poor fellow's
being entangled and tripped up in one of his own complicated meta-
phors—of his staking himself on one of his own jokes—not that the
point would pierce very deep—of his coming down with a crash in one
of his oratorical flip-flaps. Do not tell me there can be any pleasure in
a performance, at the conclusion of which every one yents a pent-up
breath of thankful relief—which is watched as one watches the tottering
steps of an unskilful tight-rope dancer, in a “terrific ascent.” The
audience can no more ..i. the jokes of the wedding-breakfast orator
than the spectator enjoy the squibs and crackers let off round the
§§ in one of these break-neck exhibitions at Cremorne or
au Xllall.
“This social nuisance of wedding-breakfasts has lately had a colossal
illustration, which I have been surprised to find has received no notice
from ſir. Punch failude to that gorgeous Judaic family ceremonial
at Gunnersbury, in which God Hymen and God Mammon were equally
honoured, where, to judge from the º the altar must have
been of solid gold, the nuptial torches of precious woods steeped in
the rarest spices, the bridal couch stuffed with bank-notes, and the
liquor, in which the health of the young couple was º nothing
less than aurum-potabile. Eyen here I observed that the nuisances I am
complaining of were duly submitted to. LoRD JoHN RUSSELI, did the
heavy business, and MR. BERNAL OSBoºne the light comedy; The
state of the thing was grand, befitting what LoRp John, described as
‘ a union between two members of the most powerful family of Europe,’
but no act of the social penance was wanting.
“As to the gold and gems, the pearls and diamonds that flashed and
shone through the luxuriant paragraphs of JENKINs, in describing that
marriage, I felt for once that such display was not out of place. There
was something grand in the Oriental magnificence—the insolent splen-
dour—the parade of “money-power.” jukes and Lords, and Prime
Ministers and Secretaries of State were summoned to bow down before
the Golden Image that Rothschi.I.D the king had set up; and they
came and bowed dutifully, and did public suit and service to the
‘Almighty Dollar.” . Mammon really kept royal state at Gunners-
bury Park that morning. Let us hope that poor little Hymen was not
smothered under his rºbes of cloth } gold; that the fair young bride
may not find herself, like TARPEIA, crushed beneath her gifts—those
armlets and necklaces, and jewelled parasols, and gem-encrusted
writing-cases, and services of gold and services of silver—which so
bewildered and bedazzled us ‘outer barbarians' even upon }.
that there º be no danger for her and her husband, of the fate o
MIDAs, who, having the power of turning all things to gold, starved
for want of bread.
“Qn us humbler labourers at the social crank that Gunnersbury
wedding works somewhat as the apparition of a PALMER or a WAINE-
wRIGHT-a REDPATH or a Robson—might tell upon our brother

convicts at the House of Correction. It is the impersonation, on a
colossal scale, of our own aims and efforts—the audacious realisation of
our humble possibilities. We thrill with awe-we long to bow down
and worship. This anonymous God of Society is, after all, no other
than our old friend Mammon, let him disguise himself as he will. We
see him on his throne at Gunnersbury, among the Mosaic millionnaires.
They sacrifice to him with the same rites as ourselves, only with in-
finitely more cost and magnificence...They are slaves, as we are, but
they wear more gorgeous, liveries. They too were working at their
social tread-mill, though the steps of the machine were of fine gold,
and the rails of diamond; they too were bored; among them too every
honest man and woman at that Gunnersbury breakfast, writing him or b
herself down truly, would have signed, as I do,
“A SUFFERER.”

BROWN’S ACCOUNT,
MR. HuMPHRY BRown is, doubtless, acquainted with the Portu-
guese canon for a sonnet. It should open with silver and close with

ank with eighteen pounds, fourteen shillings, and closed it with a debt
of upwards,of sixty thousand pounds!. Isnot this a silver opening with
a golden close? Silver and gold. Well, it is a pity that, such is the
law, we cannot have a little iron mingled with the precious metals. A
itle iron ought to decorate the legs of the º whose hands

greatures; and, if they shine in giving anything, it is when they
bestow their "contempt.” Last week, SIR WILLIAM NAPIER was
very liberal of his “contempt.” We believe that if an earthquake
were to open under the NAPIERs, º would declare the shock to be
“only worthy of their contempt, and altogether beneath their notice.”
A FASCINATING CHRISTIAN.
..THESE Scottish Chieftains are “kittle cattle to shoe.” At least, a
little shoe (under the above title) which Mr. Punch recently ventured
to put *..." chieftain called CAMPBELL or MonzIE, seems to have
inched him, though he is not very precise in pointing out where it
lurts. However, he writes, so gentlemanly a letter upon the subject
that Mr. Punch, who, like Cæsar, “doth never wrong but with just
cause,” hastens to reply. MR. CAMPBELL, or Monzie, as his own
reporter familiarly calls him, says that Mr. Punch “should have satisfied
himself that he had a correct report of MR. CAMPBELL's speeches,
efore proceeding to hurt the public usefulness of a man professin
such principles.” Mr. P.'s answer is brief. He certainly happene
to select the quotations from the Inverness Courier, and not from the
Interness Advertiser. He knew the former to be a paper of high
character, and conducted by a gentleman who bears an honoured name
in literature. Moreover, Mr. Punch has so much confidence in British
journalism, generally, (which repudiates the American system of re-
porting, wherein falsification and garbling are considered mere smart-
mess,) that he unhesitatingly takes the report of any respectable paper,
as material for comment. On examining the Interness Advertiser,
(MR, CAMPBELL's organ), Mr. Punch does not find the expressions he
cited from the other paper, but Mr. P. knows a little about speech-
making and speech publishing, and MR. CAMPBELL will permit him,
until further notice, to believe that the rough and ready talk of the
platform is unceremoniously given in one paper, and that, the second,
and revised thoughts of the speaker are given in the other. Mr. P.
conceives that he has both the “correct” and the “corrected” re-
marks before him. This is, however, a question for the two journals;
and as to hurting the public usefulness of Mosznº, (we have written
ºurselves, like SIR WALTER’s Greenhorn and Grinderson, into fami-
liarity,) Mr. Punch designed exactly, the reverse, having actually
º a service which MonzIE could do to the agriculture of his
country.
y “Abroad in the meadows, to count the young lanbs,
And make up a list of their sires and their dams,
On paper so clean and so white.
In such pastime a Chieftain had better engage,
Than in talking himself into anger and rage,
And getting a wipe from the good-natured sage,
Who answers him now so polite.”
RUSSIA IN FRANCE.
Much rosewater has been poured upon the bear. DUKE Constax-
TINE has been most delicately treated on his way to Paris. All the
arsenals, all the dockyards, have been thrown open to him, whilst at
the same time all ugly memoranda of a late disagreement between
France and Russia were carefully set aside. Now and then, however,
the Duke would be over curious, and so stumbled upon disagreeable

glance of an old acquaintance, but ºil. recovered himself, and
eyed the bell as coolly as belles can, upon occasion, eye anybody.
(“And looked upon the strange man's face
As one she ne'er had known.")
In Paris, the Duke has been shown all the sights, and—to the dis-
1st of Austria—has sworn eternal friendship with the parrent
Apoleon. Whereyer he goes, the Duke is accompanied by GENERAL
TopLEBEN: should His Royal Highness cross to England, it is under-
stood that he will be attended on his progress by SIR CHARLEs NARIER,

but how to deal with a PALMERston who is not only a PALMERSTON,
but a bird, a beast, and a fish?
EBENEZER AND THE ESTABLISHMENT.
THE subjoined rather curious paragraph occurs in a letter on the
subject of “Church Rates,” addressed by one A. T. apparently a
Dissenter, to the Times:–
“Dissenters object to pay Church-rates on two grounds—first, because the pro-
ceeds of them are devoted to the support of a religious system which, in their
opinion, is not in harmony with the word of God; and, secondly, because the
method of collecting them is compulsory, and not voluntary. . The plan of your
Hom-rton correspondent meets the former of these objections, but leaves entirely
untouched the latter, which is by far the most serious objection of the two."
Will not A. T., on consideration, be inclined to amend the last
sentence of the foregoing paragraph by substituting “strºnger” for
“most serious”? . Surely Dissenters consider the scriptural objection
to "...ºf of church-rates more serious than the political and
personal one—though the latter may be, and probably often is, very
much the stronger. However, the strongest objection to church-rates
is perhaps that felt by honest members of the Established Church, who
are, or ought to be, ashamed to be beholden for the maintenance of
their places of worship to people of other persuasions.
Funeral Rights.
A REAL Undertaker, having been returned for Greenwich, MR.
NEwdEGATE, as the only member heretofore known by that title, is

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE boots with “military heels” now commonly worn by ladies
must have attracted the attention of many of our readers, because
they are so conspicuously exhibited by the necessary practice of
liſting up the excessively long clothes. The jackets, also of a military
character, resembling in design, if not in material, the tunics latel
invented for some of the dragoons, must have been likewise .
These articles of attire apparently indicate that a certain change is
coming over the female character—a tendency towards the masculine.
To cap this, we may, say, take, further the wide-awake hats. The
superior education which has of late years been given to woman may
be the cause of these phenomena; the higher and harder cultivation of
the understanding may express itself in the gentlemanlike boots, the
tunics, and the wide-awakes. But the assimilation of ladies to
gentlemen is not confined to outward habits.
The softer sex is º to emulate the sharper in habits of
conduct...To. One, such habit in particular, attention has been drawn
by “An English Clergyman,” writing in the Times. He states that a
celebrated and fashionable dressmaker's establishment in Pall Mall
has lately failed by reason that duchesses and other ladies who dealt
there would not pay their bills. This is a common trick with fine
ladies, and - - - - -

is, in its way, capital fun, but it is not ladylike fun. It may be all
very well for a duke, but it is unbecoming in a duchess. Moreover,
it is the efficient cause of starving needlewomen. This system of tick
is worse than tic doloureur to them. It is the tick of a death watch.
It is easy to predict the consequences that must result, from the
adoption, 3. ies, in regard to their milliners, of the behaviour of
men towards their tailors. We shall have dashing young girls passing
the Insolvent Court with fabulous milliner's accounts in their
schedules, consisting partly of charges for bills discounted. They
will take to billiariſp aying and smoking cigars, and we shall, see

THE TEMPLE AND ITS BAR.
No less than three gentlemen were called to the Bar, the other day,
by the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple; and as many as
i. by the likewise Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. Law
reform appears not to have quite destroyed the forensic profession—and
perhaps it may even survive a Marriage and Divorce Act, which will
probably leave it “Breach of Promise” to live upon. It is observ-

NESTOR AND AGAMEMNON.
IN the Quarterly Review, No. 202, just published, at the close of a
delightful article on English Political Satire, appear the following
statements about Mr. Punch.
That “the largest part of Mr. Punch's ſun has always been social.”
That his work “is a combination of scattered excellences.” That
“the world, never before had a specially comic journal of so much
merit, * social, and political matter, and combining also the
satire of the pen with the satire of the pencil.” That “the talent of
GILRAY and the talent of Hook are found in it together.” That “the
Snob Papers would not have disgraced the Tatler.” That “the do-
mestic sketches of MR. * * * * * are charming little works of art,
which it would be libellous to class with caricatures at all.” That
“the fanciful wit which flavours the writings of MR. * * * * * * *
carries us back to FULLER or CowLEY, and is of far rarer growth than
the men of past times would have expected in a paper professedly comic
and polemic.”. That “in the bright sallies of conversational wit, he
has no surviving equal.” That “the decorum which distinguishes
Punch from the §e: effusions of the class in olden days belongs as
much to the age as the periodical.” That “at the worst of times our
facetious friend is innocent.” That “the greatest proof of Punch's
success is the number of its imitators, the Pasquins, Pucks, Puppet
Shows, Squibs, Sparks, Great Guns, Journals for Laughter, Joe Millers
Mephistophileses, Diogeneses, Judys, Tobys, Falstaffs, Punchinellos, aii
those loose bantlings of the wit of the great city, now no more.
Quos dulcis vitae exsortes et ab ubere raptos,
Abstulit atra dies, et funere mersit acerbo.""
“Long,” adds the Quarterly Review, “may Punch survive these short-
lived offshoots from the parent stem.”
Mr. Punch is far too much overcome to do more than to acknowledge
the strict justice of all that the reviewer has advanced, and say, Amen,
and to answer the Quarterly, reverently, in the words of the King of
Men to Nestor–
“THY YEARs ARE Awful, AND THY words ARE wise.”
* For the information of the railway interest, evangelical bishops, the military,
and º supposed to be unacquainted with classical literature, Mr. Punch begs to
translate.
“Which at starting were *. unfit for the race,
And quickly shut up, in insolvent disgrace."
Pattern Piety.
CAPTAIN GoRDON, an earnest Tory, was defeated at Berwick. What
of that? Bruised spices give forth the strongest odour. CAPTAIN
GoRDON is a stranger to Berwick; nevertheless CAPTAIN GORDON has
offered to build a new Church outside the walls at his own expense !
“The human mind,” says Doctor Pangloss, “naturally looks forward.”
There will come another election; and though a clergyman is not
eligible for Parliament, a man may nevertheless seek the House of
Commons through the Church.
ODE TO HUMPHRY BROWN.
WHAT matter, HUMPHRy, if our name
Be sullied with a little shame?
To future times if we go down
With PAUL and Co., my HUMPHRY BRowN ?
The mark of shame no longer
Is now, with red-hot brand,
As when men’s nerves were stronger,
Burnt in the rogue's right hand.
Ah! we are gentler to our brothers
Than stern Britons were of yore;
We do not crop or slit each other's
Ears or noses any more.
No scoundrel's spattered visage
The pillory doth frame.
ere is no smart, in this age,
No sting involved in shame.
Those whom reproaches only can assail,
Such missiles can endure with patience meek.
Mere empty words are flung by those who rail,
And not full eggs, that really hurt the cheek
Which they saluted with a noisome crash.
No backs are scored by Satire's airy lash.
Hooray! we can't be whipped at the cart's tail.
Oh, joyful mitigation,
- Of penal legislation!
Sing whipping, branding, pillory, and stocks,
§ abolished,
... O'erthrown, demolished."
And if a brother's caught, who, like a fox,
Turns out to have been living;
. His brethren are forgiving,
Forbearingly regard his depredations,
And judge in . of his peculations.
Friends, we have all of us our little failings.
Come, come, ye diddled, hush those noisy wailings
Ye ruined, check those bitter curses;
And oh, ye bitten, shut not up your purses.
Your trustfulness in man let no fact smother.
We all, at times,
Commit some crimes.
Hope on, and trust, and swindle one another!
Now, meanwhile, HUMPHRY, let us thank
Our stars, and chiefly MERCURY,
The planet of the British Bank,
Named from the rascal's deity,
That some are not now at the crank
Grinding, as they deserve to be.
Nor tripping, on uneasy toes,
Upon the tread-mill's steps—as yet.
Nor º oakum, task for those
Who have picked pockets, fitly set,
The penal servants of the Crown:—
Or where should we be, HuMPHRY BRowN ?
THE WICKED SCOTCH SWALLOW.
THAT old, friend and contemporary, the Dumfries Courier, states,
...; the swallow, that “this welcome harbinger of summer
made his appearance at Dumfries on Sunday.” It is to be feared that
the publication of this intelligence will be prejudicial to the unfor:
tunate bird, and will perhaps subject it to persecution at the hands of
the Scotch Sabbatarians, who, during the ensuing summer, may be
pleased to vent their bigotry, and at the same time exercise their
marksmanship, as many of them as have any, on the swallow, by shooting
it for the sin of appearing at Dumfries on the “Sabbath.”
SNIPPINGS AND CLIPPINGS.
A Critic is always more feared than loved.
When you're beaten, fairly beaten, say it's treachery.
To believe that you are clever, when you are only spiteful, is a double deception.
Those who fancy that money can do everything are generally prepared to do
everything for money.
Love and a good dinner are the only two things which effectually change the
character of a man.
Too much pleasure and too much sun are bad both for women and flowers.
Experience is a flannel waistcoat that we do not think of putting on, until after
we have caught cold.
Poll mankind to-morrow as to which of the two they would sooner be, “A Knavo
or a Fool?” The majority would be at least 2 to 1 in favour of the Knaves |

THE LATEST CASE OF WITCHCRAFT,
THE WEAVERS, THE DUKE, AND THE
DUCHESS.
THE North British Daily Mail tells a very pleasant .
very creditable to the DUKE OF ATHOLI, very honourable
to certain weavers of Perth. It seems that some of these
men last Midsummer visited the DUKE OF ATHOLL's
grounds; when the DUKE, with the courtesy of a true
entleman, attended his visitors through a part of the
i. The summer, autumn, and winter passed; and
last week the weavers returned to Dunkeld House, bearing
a present of table-linen to the Duchess; an acknowledg-
ment of the Duke's courtesy, a tribute of their own
thankfulness. The weavers' present consisted of some
superb specimens of table-linen, consisting of two dinner-
cloths of the finest double damask, with napkins to suit, the
patterns being wrought with the finest artistic skill.” . All
this speaks well for all parties: and when at Dunkeld
House the table is covered with gold and, silver, how
very prettily will the magnificence of the Duke be set-off
.# contrasted by the simplicity of the weaver!
and wealth can have no surer support than when based
upon such workmanship. Such a weavers’ table-cloth is
made worthy of a Duke's cloth of gold.
BUBBLE REPUTATION."
It seems, in spite of all their puffing, that the blowers of
the Russian Railway Bubble can’t prevent its sinking.
Although they have used the very softest of sºap, they find
that, º *ś it will not wash. The only wind
raised in England has been an ill one for the scheme, and
the breath f º: favour has been altogether wanting to
it. The Bubble has, in fact, been already so much “blown
upon” that it can't be far from bursting; and unless they
somehow wash their hands of it, the capitalists, who are
said to have subscribed for Shares will not be better off for
soap for having done so.
PUNCH's Essence of CoNvocation.—Bosh.
SIR CHARLES NAPIER AT SEA.
THAT remarkable man, SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, in that remarkable
work of his, The History of the Baltic Campaign of 1854, has done his
best to overawe us with his pictures of the military and naval strength
of Russia, which he paints in what we cannot quite believe to be true
colours."We suspect, indeed, SIR CHARLEs is painting in distemper
—the distemper being that of a i. disposition, which suffers
from the fancy that its owner's talents have been slighted, and that he
in due course has become a blighted being. That many of the
inferences which he has drawn from what was shown him in his visit
to St. Petersburg may fairly be regarded as drawings of the long bow,
we could quote passages abundantly to prove; but as we have, not
quite so much space at our command as SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, whose
history of six months is spun into a yarn that covers_full 600 pages,
we must restrict our scissors to a single snip. Speaking of the
monetary power of the country, which he, of course, infers should be
to us a monitory one, SIR CHARLEs puts forward his opinion that—
“So long as Russia possesses a paper-making machine and a printing-press, she
cannot want money. The paper rouble issued by the Government has precisely
the same value as the silver rouble.”
This estimate of the strength of the Russian sinews of war, appears
to us as coming it a little too strong. SIR CHARLEs might with equal
truth imagine that we none of us can eyer be in want of money so long
as we can sign a cheque: no matter if our bankers will honour it or
not. Of course, too, were the principle a sound one, it would apply to
other countries as well as to Russia ; so that no peculiar advantage would
be gained to her by acting on it. In war, as in law, the side which
has the longest purse generally wins; and did a paper-mill and printing-
press suffice to pay a nation's debts, that country would be victor
which could print the fastest.
It is pretty evident SIR CHARLEs has somewhat flimsy notions on
the subject of bank-notes, if he fancies that a paper currency is in need
of no support from the metallic one which everywhere is co-existin
with it. We cannot help thinking that the passage we have quote
betrays such a shallow hº of finance, that before he again
ventures so much out of his depth, we would advise SIR CHARLEs to
take a course of lectures from some junior bank-clerk. At present he
appears to be so thoroughly at sea upon the subject, that we think his
tales about the monetary strength of Russia would find a fitter audience
if told to the marines.
ELECTION OF SPEAKER.
VERY imperfect and, in fact, altogether ficti-
tious account of the Election of the Speaker has
gone through the º: The real story of the
ceremony is as follows:–
LoRD H. WANE rose and proposed that MR.
EvelyN DENIsoN should be weighed for the
office of Speaker.
MR. THORNELEY moved that MR. EvelyN
DENIsoN should be measured for that function.
These motions were seconded and carried.
A weighing-machine being already prepared,
MR. DENIsos sat down, and was found to be of
the requisite parliamentary weight for Speaker.
The height of the Honourable Gentleman was
next taken by the Usher of the Black Rod, and
declared to be of the standard altitude.
After a short º there being no other can-
didate proposed, MR Denison was led to the foot
of the Chair by his seconder and proposer.
The Honourable Gentleman, having made a suitable speech, sat
down; the mace being laid before him.
Cough No More
We are glad to hear that our little pet, Piccolomºni, has taken
advice equivalent to Cod Liver. Oil; , insomuch that she has got rid
of the Consumptive Cough which she last year laboured under, in per-
sonating La, Traviata at the Qpera House. We congratulate the
accomplished young vocalist on her relief from a distressing symptom,
which is, perhaps, not more troublesome to the patient than it is to
the patient’s hearers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ADMIRALTY AT SEA AGAIN.
HERE is nothing surprising, to
us in the intelligence that
certain of the troops whom
there was such a hurry to em-
bark for China, have met with
a second stoppage in transitu,
the bad ship Transit having put
in at Corunna, we are told, “in
= deep distress.” The first tale
§3) of this tub informed us how,
T soon after starting, she very
nearly foundered on the fluke
of her own, anchor, and only
just reached port in time to
save her crew from swimming;
and now we learn that two days
in the Bay of Biscay have so
º thoroughly, disabled her, that
“if she weathers the Cape she will deceive all on board, both soldiers
and blue jackets.” The same writer adds, dating from the ship:—
“You may think what she must be when I tell you for a truth that there are not
one dozen men (troops) on board with a dry hammock, every seam in her deck
letting in water."
We may reasonably expect our soldiers to stand fire, but it is not
quite so reasonable for the Admiralty to rely that they are able to
stand water; and unless these seams be stopped, we shall hear that
many of our men have been completely sewn up with them. Of course
if they continue sleeping in wet hammocks, they cannot long escape
the chills which even regimental flesh is heir to; and in ague an
rheumatism they will be attacked by enemies by far more to be feared
than the Chinese, and such as are of all most sure to leave them crippled.
So that when they reach Hong Kong all they will be fit for will be to
be sent home again as candidates for Chelsea.
Now, these breakdowns of the Transit cannot be excused upon the
plea of being accidents. There has been in fact such distinct fore-
warning of them, that in strictness, their occurrence can be hardl
called fortuitous. Any heads less ligneous than those which consti-
tute an Admiralty board must have been penetrated, by what happened
on that mournful day a twelvemonth since, with the conviction that
the Transit was in speed a tug of war in which transition was impos-
sible, and that she would constantly belie her name until she make, some
day or other, a transit to the bottom, That she should therefore be
selected to convey our troops to China, it was as easy to have pro-
phesied as it would be to #. that, if she be allowed to make
another start, there will follow to a certainty more working at her
pumps; in which case there will be entailed on, Mr. Punch more
working of the Pumps, in the precincts of Whitehall, which are so
much out of gear that they continually want leathering.
THE TWO PEDESTALS.
GRATTAN has arrived, but there still, remain in St. Stephen's Hall
two yacant pedestals, only ten statues being erected. Surely, a very
good use might be made of these pedestals. Why should they remain
vacant? Wi. should they not, for at least a part of the day, be duly
occupied? It is only a little to * history—nothing more. There
Can . no doubt that, in due time, MR. CoBDEN will have a statue; so
will MR. BRIGHT; so will MR. MILNER GIBSON, if at his own expense he
erects one to his own memory. MR. FREDERICK PEEL was meant by
nature for a bit of stone; and he, no doubt in the fulness of time, wi
have a statue. Why, then, should not these pedestals be occupied by
these gentlemen and others of the rejected in turn? Denied a seat, at
least they may be allowed to stand.
MR. Cobden is on one F. MR. MILNER GIBSON is on another.
How old friends gather about them; how they discuss the measure of
the time; and how, though Qut of the House, they make themselves
spiritually felt within! Another day, and may it be an early one, we
have JoHN BRIGHT on the pedestal, join BRIGHT strengthened and
animated by Southern, air. There is a new º in BRIGHT's
aspect and º; ...And wherefore? BRIGHT has suffered man's
ingratitude; a st º we hold to be vitally necessary to the per-
festion of the heroic character. What imparts a gloomy majesty to
DANTE, but the ingratitude of the Florentines. What, as we see
them, gives to the chains of Columbus the brightness of sunbeams, but
the ingratitude of Spain. Once upon a time OLIVER CROMwFLL felt
a touch of ingratitude from his otherwise faithful Commons; for
THOMAS CARLYLE tells us that he, OLIVER, “sat down with the
mingled look of an injured dove, and the couchant lion;” a look, no
doubt, not to be painted by any ink soever, and a look, as it appears to
us, extremely difficult to be rendered by the human eye divine, doves
and lions not coming together very kindly. However, there can be no
doubt-for CARLYLE avouches it—that CROMWELL once flashed a look
after this sort, and some such look, tempered somewhat, we may
expect, from JoHN BRIGHT when, mounted on the pedestal, he is
greeted by his friends.
MR, LAYARD, it is hoped, will now and then mount one of the
pedestals, and flº his sentiments upon Persia; they may be used for
the benefit of the House, though for awhile—and only for a while, we
hope–he is denied a seat therein.
When the Education Bill comes on, we earnestly hope that MR. W.
J. Fox will be found upon one of the pedestals that he may impart his
sentiments on the measure; in this way, he may still vote; in }. way,
his wisdom and moderation may still assert their Parliamentary
influence.
Now, we do earnestly hope that these two pedestals will not remain
unoccupied. There are so many excellent men deserving to stand
upon them outside until duly invited to take a seat within,
PROTECTION FROM PETTICOATS.
THERE is a smack of penny-alinerism about the following paragraph,
which we quote from the Daily News of the 22nd ult, but the incident
it chronicles appears so extremely likely to take place that our com-
ments may be fairly made as though it really had . SO.
“DANGER_of_CRINoLINE.-Qn Wednesday afternoon, a servant was crossing the
Wellington Bridge, Dover, with one child in her arms, and another by her side,
when two ladies, magnified by Crinoline, rustled and actually swept the little
toddler into the water.” y past, y p
If this statement be relied on (and we can see no reason why it
shouldn’t, save that at the date of its insertion the House of Commons
d|had not met, and it is when Parliament is not sitting that the invention
of the “liner” is most called into Pºk we think the circumstance
related should at once, be brought before the notice of the Royal
Humane, Society, with the view that proper means of rescue be devised
to be at hand in case of its recurrence. If ladies will persist in coming
out such swells, and will suffer no curtailment of their perilous pro.
portions, every father will agree with us that measures must be taken
to ensure more efficiently the # of our children: or they will
probably ere long be so swept off, that Crinoline will seriously affect
the infant census.
As the season for the seaside is again approaching, the hoop petticoat
may prove as fatal as the hooping-cough, and Dover Bridge become a
second Bridge of Sighs, so many “little toddlers”, may be daily
sighed for under it. ere Government Inspectors of Crinoline ap-
pointed, and no dress permitted of unsafe circumference, there perhaps
would be less danger of infanticide resulting; or if this be found im-
racticable (and what, more than Monster would undertake the
cissorship?) we would suggest that, in, future, ladies visiting a
watering-place should not be suffered to walk out in the present width
of fashion, unless provided, like a steam-boat, with swimming-corks or
life-preservers, wherewith to save the children they might sweep off
by their contact. Or if toy-balloons were used for the inflation of
their petticoats, the encumbrance of the life-corks perhaps might be
dispensed with; for the balloons might easily be made detachable, and
would doubtless, keep, a child from drowning until some one arrived
with a fishing-rod and landing-net.
A MILITARY TAILOR.
THERE seems to be some mystery in the subjoined advertisement:—
Mº MILES and the 16s. TROUSERS. The Trousers originated by
him are patent to the world for their Elasticity, Durability, and Superior Cut.
The mystery seems to lie in the name MILEs. Is this word mono-
syllabic, and English, or is it dissyllabic and Latin: In the latter case
does MILEs, mean common soldier, or Illustrious Field Marshal,
distinguished for invention in the Army clothing line.
Tittle-Tattle at the Tittle-Tattler's Club.
Tittle. I say, do you know FRED PEEL talks of going over to
Australia, or America, or somewhere, to hide his discomfiture?
Tattle. Nonsense! Well, if he does, you see he’ll hire the Monster
Ship at Blackwall, and go over all by elf. It won't be any too
big for FRED !
OPPOSITION FORCES.
MR. DISRAELI is about to deliver a lecture in answer to PROFEssoR
FARADAY's On the Conservation of Forces. By the kindness of a certain
“party,” he will be enabled to give some startling facts On the Con-
servatism of Weakness, which will indisputably prove, as sure as
PALMERSTON is of a majority, the extreme %. of Conservatism.

DANCING MAD.
A LITTLE Pamphlet has lately been published
under the following apparently jocose title:–
The Homoeopathic Principle applied to Insanity.
A Proposal to treat Lunacy by Spiritualism. This
work is, however, written in perfect seriousness.
It gravely propounds a scheme for the cure of
Insanity, on the principle that like cures like, by
subjecting the lunatic to spiritual agency. How
it proposes to accomplish this seemingly rather
difficult matter, the reader may not care to
know ; but perhaps the idea ºf infinitesimal
doses of spiritualism may somewhat puzzle him.
Nothing, however, is said in the pamphlet about
these; but if spiritualism is º all, an
dose of it must be even less than infinitesimal.
Curiously enough, just after the appearance of
this tract, out came the rterly with an article
on Lunatic Asylums, wherein it appears that
Dancing is now extensively employed as a reme-
dial exercise in Insanity. Now, as no sane
man, ever dances," except upon the stage, or in
playing the fool elsewhere, or for the purpose of
rendering himself agreeable to female society, is
it not probable that dancing does—as spiritual-

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
1857, April 30th, Thursday. The QUEEN sent a message to the new
Commons, desiring them to choose a Speaker. LORD PALMERSTON
having already chosen one for them, was graciously pleased to permit
John EvelyN DENIsoN, EsquiBE, of Ossington in Nottinghamshire,
and member for North Notts, to be put into nomination. º Lord-
ship was rather late in his attendance, and MR. RQEBUCK, in Mr.
Punch's hearing, somewhat impatiently demanded why business did
not proceed, to which SIR JAMEs GRAHAM slily responded, that “they
were waiting for the DICTAtoR,” a sarcasm which it is supposed LoRº
PALMERston may manage to survive. The new Speaker was º
§ a namesake and descendant of the person from whom one MR. O.
Romw ELL uncivilly prayed that “the Lord would deliver him,”
namely, LoRD HARRY WANE, and was seconded by MR. THoRNELY, a
retired Liverpool merchant, who drops his aitches. The latter intro-
duced a protest against the long speeches in the House of Commons,
and begged that the leading members would begin their orations early
in the night. He might as well expect a favourite theatrical buffoon
to consent to begin grinning at an hour of the evening when the best
part of the audience has not arrived.
MR. DENISON made a neat little speech, placing himself in the hands
of the House, which hands unanimously liſted him into the seat vacated
by the Lord EveRSLEY. The Dictator then congratulated him, as did
R. WALPoLE, from whom the congratulations came the more grace-
fully that the honourable gentleman had been himself a good deal
talked about as a very proper candidate for the Speakership. MR.
DiskAELI was not present, owing, it was said, to his having been misled
as to the hour of election. MR. HAYTER, the Liberal whipper-in, had
mentioned four o'clock as the time, but as it scarcely came within his
duties to whip in the leader of opposition, and as moreover MR.
DISRAELI is generally supposed to be in the habit of knowing what
o'clock it is as well as most folks, it is charitable to believe that he
wished to give MR. WALPoLE the chance of doing a pleasant thing.
MR. SPEAKER DENISON thanked the House, and adjourned it.
Friday, and Saturday. Iords and Commons swearing. LoRD
EyFRSLEY, in splendid baronial array, has been duly enrolled a member

“With regard to the treatment of PoERio and the other political prisoners, you may
rely upon the following statement being correct. A friend of mine, an officer, who
some little time ago was on duty at Montesarchio where PoERio is confined, tells me
that he has frequently been obliged to put up with the very sorry fare which that village
affords, when under his very eyes cases of champagne and other luxuries were being
carried into the castle for the use of the prisoners. This is, indeed, quite in accord-
ance with the express orders of the King, who had given particular instructions that
everything should be furnished to the prisoners that they might wish and could pay
for, the only thing prohibited being the sending out of letters.”
This statement is likely enough to be quite correct. , Very probably
the author heard that BoMBA had given the orders to which he alludes.
Such a story may well be conceived, to have been given out by the
monarch's police. , In, conformity there with, cases, apparently, of
champagne, and other luxuries, may; doubtless, have been carried, in
the #. ic view, into the castle. Whether they were bond ſide cases
of champagne and other luxuries or not, and if they were, who con-
sumed them—the prisoners, or their gaolers and torturers—may,
indeed, be questioned. This question would have been set at rest by
the letters of the prisoners, if they had been allowed to send any out.
We entirely believe that BoMBA prohibited them from doing any such
thing; and thus believe the above statement from beginning to end-
the end especially.
Brown's Testimonial.
It is not | generally known what kind of candles MR. HUMPHRY
BRowN. will burn in the candelabrum that his admirers presented to
him at Tewkesbury. However, we can take it, upon, ourselves to say,
that the candles in question will be neither plebeian tallow, nor patrician
wax, but simply composition-in fact, nothing short of the composition
that has been paid over by the shareholders of the British Bank, but
which MR. HuMPHRY BRowN will try his best to see if he cannot
make light of.

“MR. PUNCH,-What holds Society together P Mutual services,
acts of kindness done in moments of need or sorrow, self-interest, the
pleasure of conversation, the love of scandal, weariness of ourselves
enjoyment of the company of others, or mere instinctive gregariousness?
“None of these, so far as I can gather from my experiences as a
married man, and a London hºſt. Society here seems to me
to be built up of pasteboard—a veritable house of cards.
“Nine-tenths of the social intercourse of this Metropolis appears to
be carried on either as a solemn and costly ceremonial, or as a dreary
penance.
“Dinners, routs, balls, breakfasts-wedding and others—belong to the
rst, or ceremonial order of social rites. - -
“Calling is the principal form of social penance. It is against this
penance I wish to pour out my feelings.
“It is only married men who know at what cost of time, money,
and temper this penance is performed. A bachelor's calls are seldom
penal... Your bachelor, if he ever makes calls, does it because he likes
it. What more natural than that JAck Easy, on his stroll from the
Qlub to the Park, should drop in of an afternoon on pretty, MRs.
BELLAIRs in May Fair? The chances are ten to one he will find
MRs. BELLAIRs at home, for he knows her hours, and wants to see
her. , And as he is certain to come in for a bright face, a pretty morn-
ing;dress, an elegant little boudoir, and a lively half hour's gossip-
with perhaps a cup of tea, at the end of it—JAck has treated himself
to a pleasure. He called with that object. MRs. BELLAIRs will have
half-a-dozen such, calls, this afternoon, most of them from her male
acquaintance. The ladies purse their lips, when MRs. BELLAIRs is
mentioned. She is too agreeable. She has flung off the ceremonies,
and refuses to º the penances of society. Her dinners are un-
retending and proportioned to her kitchen and her establishment.
he does not swelſ her household with green-grocers, or have her
entrées from the pastry-cook's. When you call, as I have said, you find
her at home. She has arranged her house and ** for enjoyment, and
not, as if for the discharge of a painful duty... Hence, perhaps, the
undeniable fact that she counts, in her circle, three bachelors for one
wedded-pair. The married couples you do meet at her house are apt
to be...young ones, and of the unceremonious or off-hand kind, who
take life as if it concerned themselves more than their neighbours.
SHE'S AT HOME I
“Women, too, have their non-penal calls. When two young ladies
for example, dear friends,-meet to exchange patterns or experiences
—to talk over the triumphs and trials of last night's ball,—to compare
notes as to husbands, and house-keeping—to bewail the backslidings of
butlers, the contrariness of cooks, or the high-flyings of housemaids,
I do not doubt that they really enjoy themselves. I can readily
imagine two vicious old maids, keenly relishing a good ‘go-in” at
the reputation or circumstances of their friends. I can conceive their
bitter pleasure in tearing to pieces some fair young fame—or in routing
out some grim skeleton from its closet in the house of a common
acquaintance; or in letting loose from its bag some cat, likely to run
...; freely, and to bite and scratch a great many people in the neigh-
Outnoodl.
“There is enjoyment in a call on an artist in his studio, provided you
know him well enough to rummage his portfolios, or turn his canvases
from the wall while, he continues at work. Unless you are on these
terms with him, you have no business to interrupt an artist, except on
invitation, and on ceremonial or penal occasions; as, for instance,
when PodgeRs A.R.A. has expressed in writing the pleasure it will give
him to see you for inspection of his pictures intended for the Academy
on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th of April. That is one of the penal performances.
If you go, you must make one of a shoal of people, who flock into the
lace on each other's heels the whole day through, most of them
owing nothing of Art. The few who do, are debarred by politeness
from speaking their mind on the work before them, where they cannot
honestly approve, but they are all pouring out the same commonplaces
of compliment to PodgERs's face, and venturing on ‘shys’ of criticism
whenever the poor man's back is turned, while poor Popg|ERs is
beaming about, full of himself, feeding on honey, and butter, and
believing all the compliments sincere in spite of his better judgment-
so sweet is ...”. the Times comes out, the day after the Private
View, and omits all mention of PodgeRs, or damns him with faint
praise, or cuts him up, perhaps, root and branch.
“But the real penance of penances is that social performance called
“leaving cards.” Every day, when I come home from my office, I find
my hall-table littered with these, pieces, of pasteboard. There is a
physiognomy about them. Take the newly-married card, for instance
on which MR. and MRs. CooBIDDY always figure in couples, a sort o

engraved in Paris; and here mediaevally-minded MR. Pyxon has
stamped himself in Gothic characters as difficult. to decipher as the
directions to strangers in the New Houses of Parliament.
“But what is the meaning of this pack of pasteboard from the JUG-
GERNAUTs P Why has MR. JUGGERNAUT left two cards, and MRs.
JuggeRNAUT two cards, and Miss JUGGERNAUT two cards, and MR.
FREDERIck JuggeRNAUT two cards? And why are they alſ turned up
at one corner? The JuggeRNAUTs are the most determined doers, of
social penance I know. This shower of cards is meant to represent a
visit from every individual member of their family to every individual
member of mine. Well, if it have saved us from an infliction of the
JuggerNAUTs in person, let us be thankful. These paste-board proxies
are blessed inventions, after all. There could be only one º; etter.
To get rid of the printed paste-board—even as we have got rid of the
human buckram it represents., Why call upon each other-O my
brethren and sisters—you who bore me—you whom I bore—even in
paste-board? Why not drop it altogether—and live apart P. People
who care for each other will find time and opportunity to meet, I will
answer for it. Why should those who do not pine in a self-inflicted and
superfluous suffering? Think what you are ºf yourselves and
me to. I or my wiſe might be at home when you call. ...We might all
have to endure half an hour of each other—a constrained, unhappy
half-hour, of baffled attempts at keeping our mask from * Oll Olle
side, and showing the yawns, and flat melancholy behind them.
“Then this penance is not merely painful in itself. It costs time and
money. -
*še morning in every three weeks or so, I find my wife at her
writing-table, struggling with the Red-book and the Map of London.
She is making out her lists of calls, she tells me. These lists are in
duplicate. One is for her own guidance, the other for the driver of
the Brougham, which is hired for the day's penance. There is a
sovereign for that, including the tip to the driver. Of course, she
can't be expected to make her calls in a cab. -
“I once, out of curiosity, accompanied my º wife on one of
these penal rounds of hers... I never, saw more suffering, of various
kinds, condensed into six hours. First, there is the consideration of
the route—by what line the greatest number of calls could be got
through in the least time, with the greatest economy of ground. ls
j with the driver, begins the painful process itself, in Tyburnia
Het us say—or Belgravia, or the regions around Bedford Square—
if one dare own to acquaintances in that quarter,
“Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow.”
“You reach No. 1 on your list: a pull at the check-string: ten to one
the driver has overshot the door: he turns round: descends: knocks:
the door is opened: ‘..MRs. HARRIs not, at home’—of course: your
cards are dropped: drive on to, No. 2: driver has a difficulty about
the street; this you discuss and, finally settle, with him through the
front window: drive a hundred yards; check-string again: knock:
door opened: not at home: card dropped as before; then on to No.3:
and so the weary routine goes on from one o'clock till six. Qf course,
there are episodes of peculiar dreariness. Sometimes MRs. HARRIs is
at hºme, and being at home, has neglected to say that she is not. If
you have rashly asked the formal question, you must go in, and the
paste-board performance is turned into the real penance of a bond fide
. Or your cºachman is stupid, and keeps turning up wrong streets:
or cannot read, and, invariably stops at the wrong numbers; or is
obstinate, and has a theory of his own as to the order in which the
houses on your list are to be taken, and so forth.
“The worst of all, as I have already said, is when the people called
upon º to be at home. This chance has to be faced at every
house, and adds seriously to the day's unhappiness. I shall not soon
forget my wife's face of consternation when, on dropping her cards at
the address of our dreary old friend, MRs. BoFEHAM, who is at once
deaf, curious, and ill-natured—the servant who took the cards, instead
of shutting the door as usual, advanced to the carriage—‘Good Gra-
cious!" exclaimed my wife, in a voice of dismay, “She’s at home!’
“‘MRs. BoREHAM at home?’ she inquired the next moment, with
the blandest smile.
... ',No, Ma'am,’ was the answer; “but she told me to say, if you
called, she was going to Brighton for a month.”
“ God bless her!’ rapped out my wife. The footman thought the
ejaculation one of pious affection. Under this impression he might
well look astonished. Had he understood the words in their true
sense—as an utterance of thankfulness that his mistress was out of the
way, he would, prºbably, have said “Amen,” for MRs. B's hand is
heavy on her household, I have never joined my wife in a day of
calling-penance since that morning. But I am always paying bills for
packs of cards, and the Brougham forms a serious item in our quarterly
accounts.
“But after all it is not so much the waste of money and time that
irritates one as the hollowness of the business. If these º paste-
boards must be deposited, why not despatch them by post, like trades-
men's circulars? I'hear that some fine j do send round their maids
on this penance. I applaud them for it. I have serious thoughts of
insisting on my wife's employing the crossing-sweeper—who does our
confidential errands extraordinary—to deliver her cards. He is a
most trustworthy man, and would be thankful for the day’s work, for
which he might be fitted out respectably in one of my old suits.
“This Groan, I feel, ought by rights to have come not from me, but
from my wife. It is the poor women especially who have to do this
enance. But we men suffer from it in twenty ways, besides, the
irect ones of money out of pocket, and a wife's time abstracted from
home and home duties. The huge lie it embodies works all through
society. This paste-board acquaintance invites and is invited. To
it I owe the splendid dulness of many dinners every season—the
heat and weariness of many crushes under the name of drums, routs
concerts, and so forth–the necessity of bowing and smiling to, and
º: a sort of interest, in the concerns of hundreds of people I
on't care a rap for. Thanks to it, in short, I perform an uncounted

WATERLoo BRIDGE has been seized—taken in execution for taxes.
When we heard this, we feared that it must always remainin captivity,
for that noble and solid structure never evinced the least inclination
to settle. However, the matter was arranged, and an action for
trespass is to be brought; for though there could be no objection to
the bailiffs or any one else laying . of the balustrades, piers are privi-
leged from arrest. There is some difficulty about the form of proceeding,
for one end of the bridge abuts on Surrey, which would seem to indi.
cate a plea of Surrebutter as the remedy, while the general nature of
the ease pºints to the Court of the Arches. The passengers who were
on the bridge at the time of its seizure, were taken as live-stock, but
have, we understand, been replevied, except MR. W.M.WILLIAMS, M.P.,
who was crossing, and who insisted upon being taken at a valuation,
which, º his own, was found so exorbitant, that no terms could be
come to, and at a late hour of the night the honourable member was
swopped for a donkey, which a respectable costermonger was riding, a
bargain conceived to be so beneficial to the bridge owners, that the

TRAGEDY IN FLEET STREET.
The RE will be some fearful work at the approaching quarterly meeting
when the Licensed Witlers edit the editor of their paper, the Morning
Adrertiser. That remarkable journal has always foamed, like a full
pot of newly-drawn ale, against Popery and Puseyism, though, by a
curious paradox, the Tiser's Protestantism has usually seemed without
a Head to it. "put that zeal which is not according to knowledge,
especially the knowledge of the classic languages, sometimes leads
people into difficulties, and the Advertiser's Random Recollections of
the Greek Alphabet have been so random as to help the journal into
one of the most unseemly scrapes on record. - - -
A ludicrous theory advanced by one of the gushing writers in the
Tiser, and intended to ºf certain Puseyite practices into con-
tempt, excited the malice of “some persons unknown,” but sup-
posed to be clerical contributors to the Saturday Review... They sent
the editor of the Tiser, in support of his view, a series of letters, in
which mock authorities were paraded, mock references given, and
at last, the innocent organ of Bungdom unsuspectingly inserting the
wicke º: the victimisers finished off with an Italian's communi;
cation of a passage in Greek, ‘erroneously attributed to ATHENAEUs.”
Schoolboys, until birched for their irreverence, have a habit of chanting
a lay setting forth that
“N Enuch. ADNEzzAR,
The King of the Jews,
Had three pair of stockings,
And four pair of shoes."
The Saturday Review (which possibly knows better than º
else) thinks that this verse, or one of its variations, º: the Gree
quotation erroneously attributed to ATHENAEUs; but be this upon the
conscience of the reverend hoaxers. The Advertiser gave in its best
type the Greek thus supposed to be suggested, and which was advanced
as an anti-Puseyite argument. There it stands, in the journal, and we
have not even heard that this time the proprietors have sought to efface
the memorial of a bétise by buying up the copies in circulation.
What will the quarterly meeting of Witlers say to this?, Mr.
Punch recommends an action against the Saturday iew, which has
reprinted the whole set of letters with the most mischievous care, and
thereby brought the victimisation, and the inferences to be drawn
therefrom, under the notice of educated readers. The Greek was very
ood Greek for the public-house—accents, and breathings, and circum-
exes, all elegantly laid on; but the Advertiser claims influence with
members of Parliament and others who have been at College, and
the paper's weight with the Governing Classes must be sadly injured by
this exposure. We think there is a clear case against the Saturday
Review, and strongly, recommend immediate proceedings. The help-
lessness of the injured party adds to the cruelty; to say nothing of the
ingratitude of thus treating a journal which, by its own admission, has
saved the country at least nineteen times up to the end of last week.
KILLING TIME BY INCHES.
THE subjoined interesting case is extracted from the Law Report
of the Times:-
“GORRISEN v. PERRIN.”
“This case, the argument in which has partly occupied four days, was concluded
to-day. The question raised was what was the meaning, in a contract, of “a bale
of gambier.” MR. WILDE, Q.C., and MR. BLAckBURN, were heard in support of
the rule for a new trial obtained by MR, SERJEANT BYLEs, with whom was
MR. HoNEYMAN.
''The argument occupied nearly the whole day.
“The Court took time to consider its judgment."
What a bale is, most people know, but few, probably, have any idea
of what gambier is, nor would care to have any, if they thought, that
counsel would take four º: to explain the nature of that article to
them, and that they themselves would have to take an indefinite time
afterwards to consider the explanation. The case was argued, before
the Court of Common Pleas. If the prolix argument maintained in
GoRRISEN v. PERRIN, is a common kind of plea, the unhappy Court,
to which such pleas are common, is deserving of the utmost
compassion.

MARRIAGE AND
“MR. PUNCH,
“As one of the unprotected sex, allow me to say a few words
lipon, some very nice letters that have appeared in the Times upon what
I will venture to call Marriage and its Difficulties. Marriages would
be easy enough, and the difficulties none, if they were not set up by
the pride, and show, and folly of the people iºiº. Whereas
how many a fair creature born for the milk of maternal kindness has
had her name written on the old maid’s list in lemon juice? But the
Fº difficulty of marriage—and never was the difficulty so great, and
must add, so wicked, as at the present time—is dress, the wife's
dress. Gowns, Mr. Punch, are at the bottom of the evil, as, if you use
your eyes-as I and all the world know you do—you cannot but see.
“Some time ago, they talked of the French coming over and invading
us. Mr. Punch, we have been invaded, and nobody knows what
trouble and anxiety, carried among tens of thousands of people. To
be sure, we haven't had our house-tops knocked off by bombshells; and
haven’t had to pack, dragoons into our best bed-rooms, as I have read
NApoleoN º insisted upon, carrying fire and bayonets into the
bosoms of peaceful families. But I don’t know if we haven’t had a
much worse invasion than this; for we’ve been invaded and carried
right off our feet by the French Empress and an army of milliners.
Don't tell me; band-boxes may be worse than bomb-shells.
“In the first place, look how the Empress, by the manner of dressing
her hair, has turned the heads of Englishwomen. With their hair
ulled, so far back that they can’t see even the tips of their shoes, they
Qok like so many half-shaven owls, only nothing half so wise. Yet
all this I could, forgive, but, for the Empress's petticoat that makes
every woman who wears it look like a diving bell and nothing else:
a petticoat that, when it isn't blown up with bellows—as if a woman
was no better, than an omelette soufflée—is fenced round about with
steel. I shall soon expect to see petticoats of nothing else but
woven wire, like a meat-safe. But as it is, I ask is it pretty, is it
comely, is it modest, for a woman to take to herself more than ten
times the space in the world than ever nature intended for her P And
you see wives, and mothers do this!—Mothers, I say, of families,
with petticoats like hencoops about them. But this—this we owe
to the invasion of the French.
“I now come, Mr. Punch, to gowns. How is it possible that,
taking one with the other, women can afford to wear the gowns they
ITS DIFFICULTIES.
i T
do? But their fathers and their husbands can't afford it; and we
know nothing of the pinching, and the misery, and too often the total
of this country could only look on, and trust that Pro-
vidence might see fit, in its own good time, to restrain
the excesses of the Neapolitan Government.”
A trust in Providence is, doubtless, religious;
pious. “Hope,” said Co.LERIDGE, and he never
said a finer thing, “is a duty;” but action is no
less a duty. If the MARQUEss Townshend had
a dear friend smitten with a fever, shivering with
an ague fit, it would of course be his duty to
trust for his friend's restoration to health to the
beneficence of Providence; but nevertheless, we
take it, he would not fail to send for the doctor;
who might administerpills, powders, and quinine.
Now, we take it that when we withdrew our
Ambassador, the Neapolitans expected of us
something more in their favour than our trust in
Providence. We think it in no way improbable
that they rather looked for the threatened
º. of powder and ball and bark of
ritish broadsides.

A TILT AT THE TOLL-GATES.
E shall hardly be
accused of an
novelty of senti-
ment, if we say we
think JoHN BULL
is somewhat in-
consistent. As an
instance out of
some few dozen
that occur to one,
wewh9are foreyer
hºal boasting
that the Briton
may traverse the
!e or the zone as
S free as his native
air, yet cannot
take an hour's
drive in any part
of our own king-
dom without being
stopped by a toll-
bar to our pro-
É. and there
ein detained
until, having paid
our footing, we are made free of the road, and are permitted to
proceed on it. However wide it may, ostensibly, be open to all
comers, still, only a moneyed man may ride through a toll-gate. Set
a beggar on horseback anywhere in England, and within five minutes
from his starting he will have to pull up at a pike, or will be pulled
up if he doesn't. At a meeting held the other day to petition for an
act for the removal of these nuisances, it was stated for the benefit of
those who like statistics, that:-
“There are at present no less than one hundred and seventeen toll-gates within
a radius of not more than six miles from Charing Cross.”
It is pretty clear then that no Paterfamilias within ear-shot of Bow
Bells can ever drive out for an airing with the MRs. and, the Misses
P., without being stopped by some half-dozen licensed highwaymen,
each of whom commands him to stand and deliver. Every other mile
or so he has his horse thrown on his haunches, and finds a fresh
demand made for his money or his wife's. It was a mark, of the
benevolence of the elder MR. WELLER, that he viewed a ºf.
keeper merely as a sort of misanthropical recluse. To our mind, he
seems less a TIMon than a TURPIN; and every time he stops us, he
commits a double highway robbery, as he not only takes our money,
but likewise robs us of our time, which proverbially is money also.
But to aggravate matters, and heighten the temperature of our just
wrath and indignation to almost boiling-over point, we learn from what
another speaker is reported to have said at the meeting we have men-
tioned, that—
“These gates are kept up not for the use or benefit of the public, but to enable
§:* and worn-out &ºi. to expend money and to enjoy the sweets of
So the pikes are preserved for jacks in office to grow fat on! Hearing
this, we need no further argument to induce every reader to enrol as a
Rebecca; or, in other words, join the Toll Reform Association, which
is pledged to present us with the freedom of the country. The tolls
throughout the kingdom are as great a nuisance as the Chimes in a
Puseyite vicinity; and as this is to be a reformatory Parliament, we
hope to see some sweeping measure passed to sweep away these ves:
tiges of a dark age creation. With the words we have quoted still
ringing in our ears, we shall not be easy in our minds until we hear
that at St. Stephens’ has been tolled the knell of tolls.

HOW FASHIONS WARY.
THE Fashion changes with every place you visit. Par exemple, you
may keep your hat on at Evans's; but it is scarcely considered good
manners to do so at the Opera. You may whistle and join in “God
save the Queen” at the Promenade Concerts; but the same taste is not
*:::: of you at the Philharmonic. Anyone is at liberty to call out
“Brayvo, WRIGHT!” at the Adelphi, but the same exclamation would
be considered a little out of place at Exeter Hall. A cigar may be
lighted with great effect in the corridor of the Surrey, when the
audience is pouring out, but you would hardly attempt such a thing in
the crush-room of Her Majesty's Theatre,
PRETTY, Excuse For A WIFE BEATER,-The treasure which we
value most we hide,
PARCHMENT PRACTICE.
THE innocent sheep!, To how much human rascality is it made to
minister! To what fell purposes does man apply its cuticle, shorn of
its wool and dressed for parchment! When we think of the sins, the
iniquities, the affronts and outrages of common sense that are, in due
time, laid upon its back; when we reflect that what once cropped the
odorous thyme, that what once in its innocence “lick'd the hand just
raised to shed its blood,” now bears all the awful responsibility of
Doctors’ Commons, the sheep loses the guilelessness of its character
and becomes more terrible than the most fabulous of dragons. Poor
sheep!... And yet it has an instinct of what, in its parchment condition,
awaits it. For to this instinct is no doubt referable the fact, possibly
hitherto unknown to our readers, that by no number of drovers aided
and assisted by an unlimited supply of dogs, is it possible to drive
a flock or any part of a flock of sheep up Chancery Lane; the animals
so persistently boggling and bolting at the law stationers. 'Poor things!
they no doubt sme ific ink, even as at the butcher's threshold, they
pause and shiver, snuffing the blood.
Thinking of the uses, abuses, and purposes of parchment, we have
often chewed the cud of melancholy in pastoral ways, and felt the
rising sigh on southern downs. But with this keen and tender sense
of-the after wrongs of the sheep, we had yet to learn another trick of
which it is made the passive agent. There was whilom in existence
an Athenaeum Life Insurance. We believe that Minerva herself had
no shares in the Institution, nor can we determine whether even her
owl was on the board of directors. Be this as it may, the Athenaeum
has collapsed; the “owl-droppings,” as MR. CARLYLE would say, have
ceased for all time, and now comes an examination of the causes that
have determined and ended the benevolent institution. It appears
that the parchment of the institution had been tampered with ; a
sheet removed or inserted, and that so cunningly as to defy detection.
The possibility of this knavish piece of work was doubted, when a
law-stationer, with a sweet confidence, and a no less deep knowledge
of parchment practice, gave his testimony. Listen to him. Apollo,
when he kept sheep, never piped to the living vellum more blithely:—
“MR. CHARLEs SHAw, Law Stationer, had had great experience in deeds of
settlement and their binding. Had bound up some hundreds in the course of his
time, and he could, without any difficulty, insert a sweet of parchment in a deed
and remove it subsequently without leaving any traces. He had, in fact, done it—
(a laugh)—and without mentioning names, he might state that a sheet was placed in one,
without unbinding it, on last Good Friday. (Sensation.) By whose direction he did not
know, but he altered it, and put it in another place.”
The coolness of MR. SHAw would make him a delightful companion
in the dog-days. And then how charming his delicacy. ithout
mentioning names!” Nothing could be more considerate. A worker
in iron might say, “without mentioning names, I’m in the habit of
supplying certain gentlemen with picklocks.” . And what a parchment
deed for Good Friday! We will not ask MR. SHAw whether, even for
a moment, he pondered on Him, who suffered for the sins of all men,
law.stationers included, but it is not impossible that a thought may
have wandered to the criminals on the right hand, and on the left.
A COUPLE OF REASONS.
FATHER WENTURA, in the course of a sermon preached at the
Tuileries, said, talking of the two NAPOLEON empires,-
“The first reigned by the reason of force, the second reigns by the force of
reason.”
We will not stop to inquire which of the two empires has the
reater “reason” to be proud of its reign, but we must take the
É. of doubting the extent of that vaunted reason, which, under
the second NApoleoN, has not yet produced a single author, a single
oet, a single orator, or a single #. man of any. European note;
With the liberty of the press prohibited, with the police system in full
force throughout every grade of society, it would be perfectly useless
to ask Reason to name any of the mighty deeds that have been accom-
plished during its brilliant reign, for she has no yoice in the Senate or
elsewhere, to answer the question with. The only reason the Second
Empire can truthfully boast of is—La Raison dº plus fort. In that
respect we are bound to acknowledge that Louis NApoleoN a toujours
raison. Viewed in any other light, if Reason shines at present in
France it must be, as the French themselves would say, that elle brille
par son absence.
Musical Treat.
AMongst many other interesting items of intelligence respecting
music on the Continent, we read that
“CARRIon has had a complete ovation in La Somnambula.”
La Somnambula is generally considered a very sweet Opera; but its
sweetness must be of a peculiar kind, seeing that it appears to have
been rendered all the sweeter by CARRION.

[May 16, 1857.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEW COAT-OF-ARMS FOR SIR CHARLES WOOD.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 7th, Thursday. The swearing which MR. SPEAKER DENIsox
had been countenancing for a week, was suddenly checked to-day.
HER MAJESTY, happily convalescent, left London for the sea breezes
of Osborne, but also left a Speech behind Her, which the LorºD CHAN-
CELLOR CRAN worth was ordered to read to Parliament. As the
QUEEN was not to be present, Mr. Punch did not, think it worth while
to É. down, though, had his Royal Mistress been able to attend,
nothing would have prevented his taking his accustomed place amon
the bishops, in order to give Her that wink of encouragement an
loyalty which She motoriously regards as the chief bulwark of Her
throne. He went into the Royal Academy, instead, and contemplated
MR. STANFIELD's glorious picture of the Armada ships on the Irish
rocks, until a young nobleman of the name of SMITH, whom he had
ordered to look alive for the purpose, brought him the Globe, with the
Speech, remarking (when permission was given him to do so) that
RANworth had bungled and stumbled over the Address in a most dis-
graceful manner, a statement confirmed by the Times next morning.
A glance at the Speech showed that there was nothing in it. The
chief part of it was written º LoRD CLARENDoN, and was devoted to
tº: things which everybody knew or nobody cared about. Here
ey are.
We are at Peace.
It seems likely to last.
The stipulations of the Treaty are fulfilled.
Switzerland has bribed Clicquot to be quiet.
We have done nothing in re Central America.
We have signed a treaty with Persia.
We send out ELGIN, and forces, to China.
We compound for the Sound Dues.
QUEEN ANNE is no more.
Besides this news, which may even be read in the Morning Herald
by this time, there was the usual mention of the Estimates (the two
PEELs, Robert, Lord of the Admiralty, and FREDERIck, Under-
Secretary for War, have both resigned, so the Navy and Army must
get on as they can) and the equally stereotype information that some
reform of the law must be e . and that everything is going on
exceedingly well. This latter proposition, considering that we are
sitting before roasting fires in the middle of May, indicated a want of
common sense that pointed out CRAN worth himself as the author of
the concluding paragraphs. So Mr. Punch presented the Globe to the
young nobleman of the name of SMITH, in fee simple to him and his
heirs for ever, as a small token of respect and esteem, and resumed his
tºe with Stºrmºn.
At night he went into the Lords. The Address was moved by Loan
Townshend, who said, among other things, that he should not mind
seeing a Jew in that House, a curious speech from a sailor, whose
Hebraic antipathies are usually rather strongly developed. LoRD
PortsMouth seconded, and one might more reasonably have expected
that Portsmouth would say something for the Jews. But Isaac
NEwton FELLowes (a descendant of great Isaac, and few noblemen
have sobrilliant a pedigree) had nothing to say for “ little isºcºioni,
MALMEsbu Ry came out with a complaint that Lord PALMERston
had laughed at him and his party for their factious attempts upon
office, and Lord GRANville defended PAM. Lord Classicañde
deplored certain attacks upon GENERAL AshBurnham, who commands
the Chinese expedition, and whom Lord PANMURE declared to be a
well gº ºfficer. Exml Grey emitted some suriyºtwaddle against
the Chinese War, and Lord ALBEMARLE demanded why they were
told nothing about Reform. If he had waited for a º he might
have * till now—for the Lords agreed to the Address, and
ourned.
n the Commons MR. HAYTER delivered the real Speech from the
Throne. He announced Governmental measures on Transportation,
Hudson's Bay, Savings' Banks, the Board of Health, the Jew Oath,
Trustee fraud, and insurance Companies. -
The Debate on the Address was opened by MR. Dopson—decidedly
no connection of Fogg, for he s §. very lucidly. MR. Buchanan,
selected in compliment to the President of America (at least, there
seemed, no other reason), seconded; and good old GENERAL THonºr-
son—who was a Reformer not only before it was fashionable, but when
it was proscription to be one, and whose admirable Corn-Law, writings
repared the way for the showier and better paid champions that came
in at the death—made a quaint little protest against the Chinese War,
very good-humouredly received; for he is a brave soldier, in two senses
of the word, and has earned the right to have his crotchets treated
kindly when bumptious blockheads are properly kicked for theirs.
Load Robert GRosy Exor, knowing that LoRo PALMERston was
i. to *:::::. a Reform bill, boldly announced that his constituents
emanded Reform. He also stated that he should bring in a bill to
render it unlawful for candidates at elections to pay for the con-
yeyances that bring up the voters, or to defray the cost of erecting
hustings. There is sense in the first of these propositions, but voting
places ought to be within easy access of the º and in that case
a voter may reasonably be asked to bring himself to the pollif, he
wants to come. As for the second, irreverent people might say that
º mountebanks should erect their own stages. Mr. Punch,
owever, conceives that decent and proper places for transacting con-
stitutional business should be maintained at the expense of the country.
It seems prudery to vote two millions and a half to build a place for
members to sit in, and to grudge a few hundreds for the steps by
which they ascend. MR. EwART renewed his very commendable
clamour for a Minister of Justice, and— -
Silence! Silence! Readers will be good enough to take off their
hats, and to stand up. Silence, now.
- The Dictaton announced that next year Government would bring
in a Reform Bill, the basis of which should be universal Surfaage!
Well, if you doubt it, turn to the Times. Lord PALMERstos, after
explaining that the session was too far advanced for the present
introduction of any, such measure, and, after declining to pledge him-
self to details, said, “At the beginning of next, session we shall
able to propose some measure to correct any defects in the present
Reform Act, As well. As to ADMIT to the FRANchise Those classes
of PERsons who ARE AT PRESENT Excluded FRoºt it.”
If that be not a distinct and manly º of universal suffrage, let
us all turn Jesuits and Puseyites, for there is nothing but anon-natural
meaning in words. No wonder the House cheered. No wonder that
MR. Roebuck, moved to tears of vinegar, tore up an intended motion
on reform. No wonder that the Chartists are collecting pennies for a
testimonial to the Chartist Viscount, and that MR.ERNEST Jones's
occupation is gone. As for Lord John Russell, he has gone and
hired himself as usher at a ragged school in a street that has no name,
unless DIFFANGER Junior has hunted it out and christened it since we
went to press. Lord PALMERston and Universal Suffrage! Need
Mr. Punch add, that the Address was rapturously voted.
Friday. None of the proceedings in either House merit note, except
a melancholy display } poor fº, CARDIGAN, who made a most
uncalled-for declaration that everybody was satisfied with his conduct
in the Crimea. It is very funny that in the best regulated nursery you
have only to say “CARDigAN”—and the children instantly strike up
in chorus,
“See, see : What shall I see?
A horse's head where his tail should be."
Some elaborate explanations by SIR. C. Woon about the unfortunate
Transit were given, and the First Lord of the Admiralty triumphantly
announced as a discovery, that not only did Government ships suffer
in bad weather, but private ships also. ADMIRAL WALcott endea.

BARNUM'S BEST PLAN.
N advertisement, headed “BAR-
NUM ENGAGED,” announces that
the dwarf called Tow Thump
“has engaged his former guard-
ian, the world-renowned P. T.
BARNUM, to exhibit him at his
morning entertainment.” In-
stead of falling back upon ToM
Thum B, why does not BARNUM
go ahead, and supply the demand
of the gaping public with as-
tounding novelty?, How can he
have failed to get hold of his
countryman, the medium, MR.
HUME? ere is a genuine
Yankee Owen GLENdoweR,
whose spirits, according to
Roman and Anglo-Catholic
newspapers, actually do come
when he does call for them;

dance, tickle knees, pick people's
pockets, extinguish and relight
candles, and, cause any lady, or
gentleman desirous of trying
the experiment to shake hands
with a mysterious cold-handed
something. This is the man for
MR. BARNUM's money,

BARNUM might make through
his means. Or BARNUM might
put himself, if he is not already,
in communication with the York.
shire Spiritual Telegraph, and get
the editor to get the poet DANTE
to lend him a hand, or a pair of hands, for the purpose of decorating
the heads of the bystanders with orange flowers, or with donkeys'
ears, if judged more suitable. Let BARNUM give a series ºf enter;
tainments under the title of “Sorcery, for the Superior Classes.”
Why should he content himself with exhibiting ToM THUMB, when,
with the assistance of MR. HuME, he * in a yery short time,
successfully pretend to exhibit the devil?" The exhibition of one pair,
merely, of spirit hands, would be worth WASHINGTON's nurse, the
eejee mermaid, and Tom Tirunſ; put together. . If BARNUM could
only make an arrangement with Hume, he would be enabled to work
a rich mine of HUM(E)bug.

“Bonnets are still worn very open, thrown back at the cheeks, and pointed in
front. The curtain deep ; put on in large plaits, arranged in such a manner as not
to fall over the shoulders, nor to stand out too stiffly in the middle of the back.”
What next, Ma'am 2–and next?—as MR. CoBDEN said. Bonnets
with curtains!—window blinds will perhaps follow, and then probably
will come shutters—or shall we say bed-posts and blankets? The
curtains must be veils, Ma'am, must they not?—but then, what busi-
mess have they to stick out at all in the middle of the back?. Curtains,
indeed! To be sure they are sufficiently, called for by the present
bare-faced fashion of bonnets. Highty-tighty. Oh, for the good old
times of the good old coal-scuttle!

England are no better than Ma(i)n(e)iacs.

EXPLOSION OF A MODERN MIRACLE.
SoME few years ago the Roman Catholic newspapers and priesthood
generally, gave out, and strove to persuade simpletons, that ſº. VIRGIN
MARY had appeared on the hill of La Salette, and had made a revela:
tion to some peasant children. Notwithstanding that Mr. Punch
analyzed this story and demonstrated its absurdity, its inventors suc-
ceeded in palming it upon multitudes of their coreligionists inclusive
of the Pope himself. Accordingly the priests of the district wherein
the trick was played, ran up a shrine, and formed a confraternity to
work it—obtaining money under pretence of the sanctity of the spot.
His infallible but hoaxed Holiness patronised the concern, and gave
it his benediction, which appears not to have preserved it from ex-
ploding. The Univers puffed it; the Tablet endorsed the statements
of the Univers. -
The journal last named has, by perseverance in stating, the marvel.
lous thing which is not, involved itself in a quarrel with the Siècle,
in consequence whereof, Le Siècle lº an exposure of the Salette
humbug. For this, society is indebted to an honest º one ABBé
D£LÉON, who discovered, and showed, that the alleged apparition
of the VIRGIN was performed by a MADEMoisBILE LAMERLIERE, b
the help of a milliner. The pretended VIRGIN, it will be recollecte
began by talking good French to the little clowns to whom she showe
herself, and then, finding that they did not understand her, spoke to
them in their own patois—evidence of imposture duly, pointed out at
the time by, Mr. Punch. MADLLE, LAMERLIi.RE brings, an action
against the abbé for false accusation, before the tribunals of Grenoble,
loses her cause, and is condemned in costs. The unlucky plaintiff has
appealed: but the fact that the discussions which took place at the
trial are not allowed to be published, is sufficiently significant of the
direction in which the Salette cat, now let out of the bag, is con-
sidered, by those capable of judging, to jump.
So much—Mr. Punch was about to say—for La Salette; but one
thing more deserves to be stated, to end the story, like a squib, with a
good bounce. The following holy “shave” was announced in 1851
on episcopal authority:—
“The waters of La Salette cure all the evils of the body, and convert the most
. sinners, even if the smallest drop (against their will) can be got down their
Physic and divinity both entirely superseded by an infinitesimal dose
of La Salette water! It is wonderful that the friars and Jesuists did
not fear that the above quoted ultramontane and ultra-Hahnemannic
...stretcher” would, if believed, prove rather too much to the believer,
ley must have as much faith in the gullibility of their dupes as the
latter repose in the veracity of their deceivers. However, the priests
tell, or at least imply, one truth respecting the water of La Salette.
By their account sinners appear to have found it very difficult to
swallow.
In quitting the subject of this alleged miracle, Mr. Punch begs to be
allowed to express the hope that the world will not forget the really
miraculous discernment evinced by himself nearly five years ago, in
seeing through and elucidating that device of priestcraft.
A SHAKSPEARIAN NOTE AND QUERY.
WE put it to MR. PAYNE Colly ER, to be considered in his next
edition of SHAkspeaRE, whether the advice of Polonius to his son is
not liable to emendation, suggested by female fashions of the present
time. SHAKSPEARE, there can be no doubt of it, in his prescience,
knew that lovely woman in 1857 would hoop herself in her |.
like a beer-barrel with iron surroundings. (We only hope that in the
meteoric convulsions of the coming summer, no fair creature smitten
by lightning will fall through her petticoats like so much cigar-ash;
but we think the occurrence very probable.) However, there can be
no doubt that the words of Polonius–
“The friend thou hast and his affections tried,
Grapple him to thy soul with hooks of steel—"
ought to read—
“The maid thou hast and her affections tried,
Grapple her to thy soul with hoops of steel."
In these days, Vulcan makes half Venus;, and a man does not only
unite himself to the bone of his bone and the flesh of his flesh, but to
the metal of his metal. It is not fair to the memory of the good and
racious TALFourd, that every woman should insist upon being the
É. of her own Ion. - -

A CRIMINAL LAW OF COPYRIGHT WANTED.
For EMost among the means which were employed in the
cookery of the British Bank accounts, mention has been
made of a certain “small green ledger” as forming an
important part of MR. CAMERON's cuisine, and º
him especially to do things micely brown. This utens
may be said to have been used as a sort of common melting-
pot, and anything put in it to the credit of the bank (ºug
as the eighteen pounds odd shillings of the late M.P. for
Tewkesbury) was soon melted down, and became undis-
tinguishable. In the º farce called the Inspection
of the Books, this greatly used small ledger instead of
being seen over was always somehow overlooked. Those
who should have audited had never even heard of it; and
so dark was it kept by the CAMERON. Qbscurer, that its
green may be said to have been the invisible.
Now, as we find that this small ledger proved of no
small service in defrauding the public, we should like to
see steps taken to prevent its being used hereafter as a
precedent. We have no wish to see any one take a leaf
out of this, or from any other book of MR. CAMERON's
concoction; and we should be glad therefore to find that
they were made strictly copyright. . Perhaps, if an in-
fringement were regarded as a criminal offence, that to
would-be plagiarists might prove a strong deterrent: and
we should therefore recommend that every such leaf which
can be traced to MR. CAMERON should be pronounced on

Another gurt big pictur too I likewise did behold,
ia old chap upºn hossback in his armour all o' gold;
And a little gal afore un, and a small buoy at his back,
As had got a bunch o vaggots that zim'd pull vrom out a stack.
There was another paaintum as zim'd in the same way done,

In a sart o' kind of yaller dress widevvles on't and ylames,
Reprezentun priestcraft, simmunly, and that there kind o' games.
A gala tyun on a scarf, moreover, I did note,
Around a chap as had got on a queer long scarlut quoat,
An old gal zittun in a chair, and a lady lookun on,
Thinks I, now that there pictur is oncommonly well drawn.
I marked a goodish pictur, too, about the Rooshun war,
Zum officers inzide a shed, one smokun a cigar;
They’d got a box just open'd zent to 'em by their vriends,
The walls wi prints was kiver'd, and the vloor with odds an ends.
On boord a boat a gwinn, Izee a sailor lad, -
And, I spose she wos his mother, a whimperun like mad;
I dwoan't know much about un, but I thinks a was well done—
That pictur of the sailors, the ’ooman and her zon. -
Zum stags, a little rabbit, an eagle in the mist,
Atop a rock Ivancied show’d a precious clever fist;
I wish the chap as did 'em ’ood paint zum pigs I’ve got :
For they be purty pigs although I says it as should not.
A quoast in storm and tempest, did also catch my eye,
Wi’a lot o'rocks like organ-pipes a stickun up ºn high,
And wrecks o' vessels lyun among the waves below -
Izeem’d to hear the waves rhooar and the winds to hear, like, blow.
A pictur o' the Sizes did also take my mind

The prisºner's poor old weather, his mother, and his wife,
He beun, as I took it, on trial vor his life.
There also was a Wrenchman, at laste as I suppose,
Or anyhow a feller dress'd up in voreign clothes,
A talkun to a female as had on man's attire, . . -
And that was a performance which I’ll own I did admire.
A lot of other picturs, too many for to name,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

IMPORTANT.
Little Boy. “Here, young 'un, just hold my Hoop, while I go and transact
a little Business.”
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 11, Monday. LQRD CAMPBELL, having had, the satisfaction of
consigning, to gaol and hard labour a couple of miscreants for selling
printed and engraved abominations, pursued the subject in the House
of Lords, and urged the necessity of legislation to suppress this poison-
traffic. The Cºnce ion said that the existing law was sufficient.
In any case in which LoRDs CAMPBELL and CRAN worth differ, the
odds are SHAkspeaRE's brains to MALMEsbu Ry’s that the CHANCELLOR
is wrong; but be this as it may, London is shamed by the permission
which the parochiai authorities' accord to the atrociºus trade. The
Bills of last session regarding Wills, and Divorces were introduced.
The clause empowering husband and wife to divorce one another b
agreement for separation is struck out. The Bishops, however, inten
to oppose the Bill, on the Popish ground that marriage is a sacramental
obligation, and therefore indissoluble. Mr. Punch is sorry to have to
hint that his allegiance to Bishops is not. - -
SIR. G. C. Lewis explained his Savings' Banks Bill. Government is
to guarantee the deposits, and of course to have certain checks on the
management. It is apprehended that provincial magnates may, rebel
against this latter Fº in which case the whole system had better
be taken into the hands of Government, or affiliated to the Old Lady
in Threadneedle Street. The Transportation Bill was discussed to-
night on the second reading, and on Friday, when it went through
committee. It is for enabling Government, at pleasure, to send over
the seas criminals sentenced to penal servitude. There was a strong
feeling in the House that tiº there is little hope of reforming an
adult criminal, his labour ought to be confiscated for the benefit of
society. This point, and still more, the means of entirely separating
his unfortunate children from the polluted atmosphere of crime, are
subjects to which Parliament may well condescend to give attention
even with the great case of Skirmisher v. Saunterer appointed for trial
at Epsom. The Industrial Schools Bill, resisted º some Roman
Catholics, who are always afraid lest “proselytism” should follow.in-
truction, but carried by 177 to 18, is a measure in the right direction.
A Committee was appointed to consider, the affairs of the Old Lady
above mentioned.
Tuesday. MR. DILLwyn introduced a bill, which it is heartily to
be hoped will be passed, namely, for the application of whipcord to the
backs of the only persons who ought to be so punished, the brutes who
commit aggravated assaults on women and children. It is impos-
sible that such scoundrels can be further demoralised, and the instru-
ment of infliction, may fairly be called in their case the “harmless,
necessary Cat.” MR. HARDY introduced a Beer Bill, for giving more
power to the licensing magistrates, who are already as notoriously the
& women, have their own earnings.
* maloré his occasional nonsense, is an English gentleman, supported the
; bill, and urged that greater facilities j
tools of the Great Brewers as their s §"; and faucets. MR. Locke
KING obtained leave to bring in a º for abolishing the property

qualifications (county members £600 a year, borough members £300)
of the representatives of the people. Lord PALMERstos rather
piteously intimated, that, as there was to be a big reform next year
there ought to be no little reforms now.
. Wºdesday, Lord RQBERT GrosvenoR carried the first reading of
his Bill, against carrying voters by 151 to 58. MR HEADIAM
re-introduced the Medical Reform Hi and the next day LoRD Elcho
lººd another. Mr. Punch will hereafter report on the symptoms
01 cach.
Thursday. The proceedings in the Lords were strictly uninteresting,
and had only the merit of being short. In the other i. Woman's
Wrongs came up, and of course there was a good deal of laughter. SIR
ERskinE PERRY moved for leave to bring in a Bill to ſet married
- MR. NRY DRUMMond, who,
- be given for divorce.
The Attorney-GENERAL disapproved of the bill, and objected to
lacing the women of England in a “strong-minded position.” MR.
ERespond Hope, a very rich, and j gentleman, evinced his
entire, ignorance, of the real grievance sought to be dealt with, and
MR. MILNEs delicately reminded him that he should not sneer at
women, seeing that, according to the papers, the energy of a lady had
mainly procured the election of her husband, the said M.R. HoPE. The
bill was read a first time.
. Friday. LoRD MAIMESPURY took a series of exceptions to the
improvements in St. James's Park, and accused SIRB. HALL of wishing
to emulate the Medicis and to go down to posterity, at the public
expense, as BENJAMIN THE MAGNIFICENT. His lordship's chief and
fraternal concern was for the geese that used to swim in the lake, an
have disappeared, but LoRD GRANville calmed his mind by assuring
him that his relatives had only gone to Kew, during the alterations
and would soon, come back. The necessity of cleansing the foul
puddle, and the desirability of º it an ornament to the metro-
polis, were so evident to ºverybody but the MALMEsburies, booted
and webfooted, that LoRD GRANVILLE's justification of the proceeding
was scarcely necessary.
More to the purpose was the DUKE or SoMERSET's inquiry touching
the designs for the Public Offices, because the subject cannot be too
much ventilated just now. So splendid an opportunity has never been
offered since SIR CHRISTOPHER: WREN was prevented from carryin
out his noble plan for the restoration of London after the Fire, an
it is only to be hoped that the advisers of QUEEN Victoria will be
wiser and bolder than were the advisers of KING CHARLEs. The
DUKE's speech was º a growl about the probable expenditure.
This will and ought to be large, but should be so adjusted as to be
shared among successive generations, who, if the project be worthily
carried out, will gladly bear their share of the burden. LoRD ELLEN-
Borough scoffed at the collections in Marlborough House, and said
that he was sorry to say that he had wasted half-an-hour there, gazing
at rubbish. Mr. Punch did not recollect that there was a looking-
glass on the premises.
In the Commons, SIR. Richard BETHELI, being asked whether he
would Fº the directors of the British Bank, gave a dubious
kind of answer, and professed fear lest in the present state of the
}. mind the delinquents in question (whom MR. Holroyd, the
ankruptcy Commissioner, distinctly declared ought to be prosecuted)
would have a fair trial. This was simply a piece of temporary petu-
lance on the part of SIR. Richard, who * to be interfered with,
and who, Punch has no doubt, will do his duty promptly and well.
The old Welsh blood of At Ith ELL will look out sometimes. MR.
HoRsMAN gave MR. WHITEside a tremendous wigging for some
imputations about an intended new building for the Irish Encumbered
Estates Court, and as WHITEside himself delights in saying insulting
things, the House enjoyed the castigation.
LoRD PALMERston then rose, and considering that sixteen of his
table napkins had been pawned by a charwoman, who had been tried
and acquitted that yeryday, his self-possession...was remarkable. He
obtained leave to bring in a bill for remodelling the Parliamentary
oaths, so as to admit the Jews. He advanced only ºne new, argument
in favour of the Hebrews, which he * as well have left alone,
seeing that the old arguments are valid, while the plea that when
public loans are wanted, Jew capitalists are ready with the money
is not of a very convincing order, seeing that all the capitalists, Jewan
Christian, are always ready with their money (if the investment be
safe, and the interest good), whether the object be to support tyranny
or fiberty, barbarianism, or civilisation. SiRF, THESIGER made, the
stock opposition, and had rather a good fling at the 1)ictator for taking
the Jew question, as he had taken Reform, out of the hands of LQRd
John Russell. The latter professed perfect satisfaction, and made a
capital return hit at THESIGER, asking him whether he would like
lawyers to be excluded, like Jews. We don't know what. SIR
FREDERIgk would like, but we should undervalue the patriotism of ºur
Hebrew friends if we believed that they would not willingly abandon
their return to Parliament until their return to Palestine, if by so

OBITUARY (A LITTLE IN ADVANCE).
WE feel no regret whatever in announcing the death of the Russian
Railway Scheme, which has taken place without, as far as we can
learn, exciting the least sympathy with those who were in any way
connected with the recently departed. So far from there being any
hopes of the deceased, it was generally considered that the sooner its
existence was put an end to the better; and those who knew it inti-
mately, and were acquainted with the manner in which it had been first
forced into life, were convinced it could not long be expected to
survive. It has since been ascertained that the breath of public
favour was entirely withheld from it, and this was a deficiency which
no amount of puffing was able to "Pºº Warious attempts were
made to raise tº: wind, but the efforts only caused an air of dissatis-
faction, which eventually proved a fatal blow to the deceased.
Although the death may very possibly have been by some regarded
as a somewhat sudden one, there are no thoughts of having a post
mortem examination, there being quite sufficient evidence to attribute
the demise to causes purely natural and easy to account for. Con-
sidered doubtful from the first, the scheme's existence daily had grown
more and more precarious; and although the most ingenious devices
were prescribed to keep it up, it was soon Fº impossible to
prevent its sinking. Being violently attacked by the public press—an
attack, which in most such cases, has proved fatal—the scheme very
speedily showed symptoms of decline; and having been much weakened
by exposure, in spite of the most skilful bolstering, it fell into so low
a state, that those who watched it narrowly saw no hope of recovery.
If we were asked to analyse the character of the deceased, truth
would force us to acknowledge that the maxim “de mortuis’ must be
reversed in this case, since we have heard nothing good of the deceased
from any trustworthy or at least disinterested quarter. We believe
the only reputation it achieved was a bubble one—and some idea may
be formed of the low estimation in which it was held, when we state
that the subscription which was opened to provide for its necessities
was received by the public with such evident disfavour, that it failed
in attracting a single response. Disliked from the first for its dubious
connections, so much that was discreditable was clearly traced to the
deceased that we cannot be surprised to learn there was no Baring it—
and there was so much to suspect of designing in its character, that we
think its dissolution must be generally viewed as a most happy release.
We are not permitted to announce at present, who will appear as the i
Chief Mourners for the loss of the deceased; but of those who were
attached to it there is but a limited number to select from. Should a
tombstone be erected, which is more than doubtful, we would suggest
that there be used as part of the inscription—
“The earth hath bubbles as the water hath,
And this was of them.”
While, as a succinct summary of the character of the deceased, it
might perhaps with some degree of truth be added that—
“Hits 33mb togg-fittſt!"

An Old Joke with a New Face to it.
A GENTLEMAN in a great hurry went to have his photograph taken.
When it was finished, he considered it, so unlike that he refused to
pay for it. An offer was made to take another, but unfortunately
there was no time....At last the poor artist said, in despair: “I’ll tell
you, Sir, what I’ll do. Here is a drawer full of portraits—two
thousand at least. Now, Sir, you may select any six of those portraits,
Sir, which you consider the most like you.”

“Now, marry, LADY FEATHERHEAD, I say it is too bad,
It is, now, by my halidom, enough to drive one mad!
This bill—this heavy bill, sent in from Moslyn, CRAPE AND Co.—
Methought that ye had settled it at least three years ago!”
“La, you there, what a pother makes my Lord! look how he raves!
I wot that Moslyn, CRAPE AND Co. are base and sorry knaves.
And they shall wait for that same bill until I list to pay,
And give me credit, or I will their credit take away.”

How, marry, came they so to break—to work so ill as that ?”
“How, marry, Madam? marry, why because they were not paid.

Their creditors come down on me, to pay it I have got; ..
Which ye should whilom long have done—and wherefore did ye not?”
“Be not in such a , my Lord ; what boot to storm and fret?
So many things have happened since, in sooth, that I forget.
The wherefore, for the life of me, I truly cannot say;
But one thing seemeth clear enough—I somehow did not pay.”
“Yea, but ye had the money, I remember me right well,
For grief it was and pain to me so great a sum to tell; .
And now I must endure that grief and undergo that pain,
Of shelling that enormous sum of money out again.”
“Tush, tilly-vally, good my Lord! heed not a little cost;
The money hath #. spent, I trow; so none thereof is lost.
Needs must we do as others do, and dress as others dress,
Which, certes, were not to be done and cost a penny less.”

* What matters it what people say? Consider how ye use,

Throw less away to pleasure it, and please your husbands more.”

“Honsixa the Parsox

mittee of Aldermen in re-
tº lation to Gaols hereby give

If proprietors of

of any high-mettled
racers that have passed
their prime, and would
like to be sure that the
animals will be put to
- worksuitable for them,
they will do well to tender them to the Committee of Aldermen, in order to have them used in
horsing the Prison Wan. Reduced racehorses cannot be more suitably employed than in
the conveyance of rogues—a class of persons that they are accustomed to, and by whom
they have been surrounded all their lives. A racehorse is the centre of attraction to a
reater number of scoundrels than any other thing or being is capable of collecting about
itself. Wherever that creature's living carcase is, there the human vultures, kites, and
carrion crows are gathered together; there is the congregation of rascals, knaves in the
stable, swindlers, blacklegs, and villains on the turf. It is fit that the racehorse should partly

bear the burden which he may be said to have
brought upon society, and assist in carting some
of that human rubbish, out of the way. The
ruped, is associated with the biped brute

mall. hem, by a gentle and easy transition
he has expanded into a rogue, the animal also

THE WEATHER IN PARIS.
The easterly winds, which have recently pre-
vailed in Paris, were attributed entirely to the
Fº of the GRAND DURE Constantine.
t is said, that he brought them with him from
the North. To PRINCE NApoleon they were
extremely, cutting. He experienced a chill, the
like of which he has not felt since he was in
the Crimea. He instantly ran away from Paris,
and never stopped till he reached Berlin. Since
the departure of the GRAND DURE, the weather
has been considerably, warmer. We regret to
state that a considerable amount of damage has
been done by His IMPERIAL HIGHNess having
rashly ventured to look into the orangerie at
the Tuileries. The majority of the trees were
immediately º as by a severe frost, and
are not expected to recover.

A CASE FOR A LADY'S SCISSORS.
If Mr. Punch occasionally, nay, continually, remonstrates with his
beloved sisters, the matrons and maidens of England, upon their weak-
nesses in the matter of shopping-if, in the interest of domestic hap-
piness he exhorts them to be moderate and economical in purchases:-
if in the interest of humanity, he begs them to purchase by daylight
that tradesmen may have rest—if in the interest of civilisation, he
warns them from ironmongery-cum-crinoline—if, in short, he gives
them incessant and kindly counsel, not unmixed with affectionate
chiding, at need; of a surety he will lift up his, voice, and also his
ºn in their behalf, when, shopping sensibly, they are objectionably
reated.
MRs. ElizaBETH HART, with money in her purse, enters the shop of
MEssRs. SPENCE AND BuchanaN, 77 and 78, St. Paul's Churchyard,
and desires to see some of the silk dresses marked in their window at
two guineas. Conducted to the first floor, several dresses are shown
her. Messrs. SPENCE AND Buchan AN's assistant tells her, º that
though purporting to be silk, the body of the dresses shown her is
cotton. The lady declines the hybrid article, and asks for one of a
higher quality, and is shown a dress at £38s. 6d., which she purchases
and takes away with her. On examination this, too, proves of a double
nature, “the silk given for the body and skirt being of a totally
different character from that of the rest.” The dress having been
“tacked in folds,” MRs. HART could not open it out, and examine it
in the shop. She goes back to MEssRs. SPENCE AND BUCHANAN, sees
MR. SPENCE, who, she states, is “very saucy,” and who refuses to
return her money; but, according to MRs. HART, offers to change the
dress “if she will buy one at a higher price.”. Instead of doing this,
the lady departs, and straightway jº. from the Guildhall magistrate a
summons against SPENce “for obtaining money under false pretences.”
The case was heard by ALDERMAN HALE, whose remarks, throughout,
appear to have been dictated by the most delicate ºft. for the
tradesman's feelings, and who hº (as reported) not a syllable, to sa
upon the system out of which the case arose. For anything that fell
from this alderman, he may hold that all is fair in trade as in love, and
that caveat emptor is the rule of commerce. He asked whether ladies
did not expect the hidden part of a dress to be of inferior quality; inti-
mated his expectation that the press would correct a misstatement in a
former report calculated to injure SPENCE AND BUCHANAN; told MRs.
HART that she ought to have exercised her own judgment; and having
invited SPENCE to bring a witness to the character of his goods, inter-
posed between him and MRs, HART's question (put with womanly
instinct) whether the witness who was brought was not from the house
that supplied SPENCE AND BuchanaN with these very dresses.
A .#. case had previously occurred, by MR. SRENCE's admission,
in which an aggrieved P. had made his complaint at the same
court, but MR. SPENCE “had changed that dress,” and was so ready
to impute “malice” against parties not present to reply, that even
the ºnal was compelled to remonstrate. A very alderman could
see that there was no primá facie evidence of malice in the complaint
of persons who, desiring and supposing themselves to buy one thing
had another given them. But ALDERMAN HALE had not even a word
of remark (as reported) upon the coincidence of cases. In fact, all
the wisdom that came out of the mouth of the namesake of SIR
Matthew, in dismissing the summons, was that the inquiry, would be
attended with some good, for it would induce ladies to loºk more
carefully at what they were buying. But MRs. HART, with femining
desire to vindicate herself from having done a foolish thing, declared
that “having been in a respectable shop she had not expected any
imposition,” and it was not very unfeminine (for woman likes the
final word) that she should tag the moral of the Aldermanic Solomon
with the remark, that the inquiry would also deter many ladies from
entering that shop. - - - - - - - -
Well, no, Mrs. HART. Do not be unjust in your indignation.
Tradesmen mustlive, and ladies must keep them alive. CHIEF JUSTICE
Jervis, as cited in a case reported on the same day as the $PENCE AND
Buchanan affair, said that trade ought to be made to bend to the law,
and not the law to the habits of tradesmen. This is Arcadian nonsense,
which one might expect from Chief Justices, but at which Aldermen
smile, "Ladies need not be deterred from entering SPENCE and
Buchanan's, provided that they take a pair of scissors with them, and
when buying a dress," tacked in ſolds,” they snip the tacking away,
and in obedience to ALDERMAN HALE's dictum, “exercise their own
judgment.”

THE MANCHESTER EXHIBITION.
We read with very painful emotion the subjoined paragraph in the
Times ; the observance of the Sabbath at the Manchester
Fine Arts Exhibition:—
“During Sunday, of course, the building was closed to the public, and a brigade
of photographers took advantage of the dies non to make copies of many of the
chefs-d'acuvre for Coln AGH1's work on the Exhibition, which will be an enduring
record of the marvellous works which, for the first time in England's history, at
least, have ever been brought together.”
The elect of Exeter Hall may not be aware that this “CoINAGH1's
work” is patronised by the QUEEN, who thus unconsciously is made to
patronise the Sabbath-breakers. Will Scotland remain tranquil under
this dire intelligence?. There came last year a pious remonstrance
from the north taking HER MAJESTY reverently to task for the seventh-
day bands in Windsor Park. Is nothing to be said against the sacri-
lege of this Sabbath brigade of photographers; or, as darkened photo-
graphers, do they claim the seventh day as a Sunday?
A POPULAR DELUSION.
It is an error to suppose that a man belongs to himself. No man
does. He belongs to his wife, or his children, or his relations, or
his creditors, or to Society, in some form or other. It is for their
especial good and behalf that he lives and works, and they kindly
allow him to retain a certain per-centage of his gains to administer to
his own pleasures or wants. He has his body, and that is all, and
even for that he is answerable to Society. In short, Society is the
Master, and Manis the Servant; and it is entirely according as Society
{. th fººd or bad master, whether the Man turns out a good or
Servant.
PROBABLE LEGAL ACCIDENTS.
At the Middlesex Sessions last week GeoRGE Cook, ex-policeman,
cobbler, and thief, received as the reward of a long series, of achieve-
ments in the latter capacity, a sentence of four years' penal servitude;
and the police report of the Times mentions that—
“It was stated that during the time the prisoner was in the Police force, he was
very active in getting up cases, and many prisoners had been transported upon his
evidence. He was known by the cognomen of Jonatha N WILD.”
The principle of setting a thief to catch a thief may be a judicious
one for the end in view, but thieves are generally apt to catch whatever
they can, and such a rascal as GEORGE Cook would be by no means
unlikely to accuse innocent persons if it suited his purpose to do so.
Of the many prisoners who have been transported on the evidence of
this JonATHAN WILD THE LITTLE, we should like to know how many
have been wrongfully condemned. Would it be too much trouble for
SIR GEORGE GREY to make some inquiry on this point * He will per-
haps find that several unfortunate persons, victims of MR. k’s
evidence, are now undergoing punishment for having done nothing,
for which crime his fiome Secretaryship may then, if he will be so
merciful, advise HER MAJESTY to grant the miserable offenders a
“free pardon.”
Mozart's Origin.
A GERMAN etymologist prides himself, on having, found out the
meaning of MozART's name. He says, “It is derived from Mus, the
abbreviation of Music, afterwards corrupted into Moz; and Art, that
explains itself. Thus, he chuckles over the discovery that MozART is
the same as Mus-ART, and means literally, “The Art of Music.” For
once, we are half inclined to believe in German philology.

CUFFEY.
E always liked little
CUFFEY, the tailor, the
ose-hero of Chartism.
We never º a good
word for CUFFEy, the
honest and resolute,
when CUFFEY was mag-
nified into a traitor, and
held up his thimble fin.
er in the dock of his
Newgate and his coun-
try. CUFFEY, with others
less º lessionest,
was wafted away from
his humble º º
board to sit cross-legged,
exiled and a captive. We
have every hope that
the change was all the
better for the patriot.
We have every belief
that fortune will yet
smile upon CUFFEY, and
that his goose will yet
lay many golden eggs. Chartism being entirely sewed up, what more
has a patriot and a tailor to do with it? No-and so liberated from
his bonds, CUFFEY shall henceforth sit under his own monster
cabbage and reap the fruits of all he sews.
Vigilant Toy DuNCQMBE—for no tortoiseshell Tom, was ever more
vigilant—has inquired in the House about CUFFEy, and the answer-
it will please even the aristocracy of the merchant tailors to know it-
was satisfactory. Why had not WILLIAM CUFFEY obtained his pardon
with some 28 prisoners amnested on the declaration of peace?
SIR GEORGE GREY said it was possible there had been some delay;
but “as WILLIAM CUFFEY’s name was on the list, he would receive his
pardon the same as the others.” (loud cheers {{. Mr. Punch).
Now, we know not whether, in imitation of John FRost, WILLIAM
CUFFEY will return to England; but we think we may venture to
º for CUFFEy, that, unlike FRost, he will not seek to enter Lon.
on as a martyr. We are fainto answer for the Chartist tailor that
he will not leave the Goose-and-Gridiron with a band of music for
Primrose Hill, there to promise a º effusion of his blood, if neces-
sary, for the slaves of labour and t e serfs of the aristocracy. Never-
theless, should CuFFEY return, let him be fully and peaceably feasted.
Let him be invited to a way-goose. Let the goose he well stuffed, so
that a political moral may in the stuffing be cunningly mingled. Let
the onions call to the recollection of the patriot the tears of his exile,
whilst the sage shall instruct him in better wisdom for the future.
And when CUFFEY shall have passed away to the domain of shades, to
the place of Phocion and CAto and ScAEvola, then
“O'er his tomb may bright thyme and sweet marjºram wave,
And fat be the gander that feeds on his grave.”
How strange it is that in due season things melt and change into
one another. There was a time, when the resolute, fire-eating, but
withal frank-hearted tailor was a little dangerous and then Ö eyism
was indeed Chartism; and now CUFFEY is so subdued, so utterly harm-
less, nay, we will say it, CUFFEY so insignificant, that Chartism is
Cuffeyism
“Unity is Strength”—of Appetite.
THE Unity Bank, at its opening, gave a grand dinner at the London
Tavern, which cost not less than £591. This strikes us as a novel
way of a Bank devouring its capital. Was the item put down to the
“Deposit Account,” or included in the “Sinking Fund?” The share-
holders of the British Bank had, their money, forked out by the
Directors, but at the Unity it would seem as if the depositors' money
was knife-and-forked out. The principle would appear to be:—“Eat,
that you may have a good dividend?”
St. Januarius and St. Palmerston.
KING, BoMBA has just expressed himself delighted with “the mira-
culous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius.” What has PAL-
MERSTON to say to the aforesaid BoMBA of the blood of the murdered
Englishman, MR. BLANDFoºd, butchered in the streets of Naples?
Qne may be a miracle, but the other is a murder. One, as a miracle
ion, may not be able to account for but the other, as a homicid
fact, must be duly considered and as duly answered.

THE PERILS OF PIANO-PLAYING.
WE copy the subjoined paragraph from the programme of a recent
“high art” Concert:-
“With this discord begins the finale fand at the fifth bar, in rapid descent, hurled
from the top to the bottom of this murmuring volcano, as M. Lenz calls it, a hurricane of
notes plunge into the abyss below, a few passages of octaves in the bass dimin, leading
to the subject at the twentieth bar.”
If, it be difficult to fancy a volcanic hurricane, we are still more
puzzled to imagine how, as in this instance, the idea of one could be
suggested by a piece on the piano, Had it been a trombone, or an
9phicleide, or a pair of bagpipes, perhaps, the comparison, might have
less astonished us. But a hurricane on the piano is the less easy to
conceive of, seeing the piano is not even a wind instrument.
We have heard of performers giving themselves airs, and it is not
uncommon, we believe, to find a first-rate artiste apt to storm a bit
occasionally. Their blustering, however, is all done behind the scenes,
and not allowed to interfere with the comfort of the public... But when
we hear that a hurricane has happened at a concert, we think, with
trembling, that the audience might have all been blown away by it. In
the above case happily we may assume that they escaped, as we have
seen no mention in the papers to the contrary. It w be well, how-
ever, when such pieces are performed in future, to announce for the
assurance of the nervous public, that the audience will be properly
protected against accidents. We are not afraid in general of what is
galled “descriptive” music, except that we have sometimes a fear of
being bored by it. But when it be of the description mentioned in our
extract, and combines, the attributes of simooms and volcanoes, we
confess we should hardly think it safe to sit it qut, unless, as a pre-
ventive to qur annihilation, we were permitted to be tied down to
our seat, and clothed from head to foot in unburnable asbestos.
THE KNEE-PLUSH ULTRA.
In the Times of May 14 may be read the original of the subjoined
advertisement:-
Foº good-looking young fellow, tall and handsome, looks
well behind a carriage, age 21, height 5 feet 11% inches, broad shoulders and
extensive calves. Two years' good character. Family with town house preferred,
and a preference for Belgravia or the north-side of Hyde Park. Address to A. M. D.,
Post Office, Grenville Street, Brunswick Square.
Now, is A. M. D. chargeable with conceit of height, with vanity of
shoulders? By no means; he merely addresses himself to the preju-
dices of the plush-market; and when he speaks of his “extensive
calves,” he merely proves that he perfectly well knows the asses he
appeals to.
- The Doctors in Danger.
MR. HEADLAM has introduced his Medical Bill into the present
Parliament. Lord Elcho has brought in a rival measure. The
medical profession is recommended to be on the alert, lest these
doctors' bills should be bills which the doctors will have to pay, in
paying amonstrous fine for registration, that is, a fine much exceeding
one shilling. The circulation of the profession generally is, in a low
state. It is deficient as regards the circulating medium. It will not
stand depletion, and the †. of a very small amount may in
many cases occasion a sinking of a frightful character, terminating
in fatal collapse.

& ſº,
A BLAZE AT A BOAT-RACE.
ONE has heard of “words that burn,” but one would
hardly look to meet with them beneath the heading of
“Aquatics.” Nevertheless, in the Times’ report of the late
boat-race, the description gets so glowing that it makes one
hot, to read it. The writer clearly must have “warmed
with his subject” to at least the extent of ten or twelve
degrees, before he could have penned such a passage as the
following:—
“It may be as well to observe that, although from the number
of steamers present, the Thames appeared to have one huge furnace
upon it, the care and attention of Mr. BURNEY, §º. of the
Citizen steamboats, and of MR. Sawyer, Superintendent of the Iron
boats, prevented any collision or confusion.”
Really, when one hears of this “huge furnace,” and this
MR. BURNEY being on it, one almost wonders that between
them they didn't somehow set the Thames on fire: and
one inclines to some astonishment to find that the match
did not end in a dead heat. Rowing for the Champion-
ship must be | warm work enough to make the slightest
increase of the temperature oppressive: but perhaps the
presence of so many steamers is found in some degree to
stimulate the rowers, inciting them to put on extra steam
themselves, for fear of being run over. Still we think that
in such cases accidents from fire are not at all unlikely to
happen on the water; and if the race is to become such a
flery ordeal, we should seriously advise all contenders for
the Championship to have their rowing-dresses manufac-
tured of asbestos.

THE EMPEROR of Austria pardons all Hungarian

THE SOCIAL TREAD-MILL. No. 4.
“Mr. PUNCH,
“Or dinners, public and private, family and festive, pot-luck
and ceremonious, on one's own mahogany, or in a Greenwich or Rich-
mond hotel, what sufferer but has most pai experiences? This
meal, intended as it is for our solace and sustentation, has somehow
been erected into the engine of some of our heaviest social tortures.
Indeed so many recollections of suffering—in palate, stomach, spirits,
purse, temper–crowd upon me with the word ‘dinner,’ that f fºci an
embarrassment of bitternesses. I am puzzled in what order to marshal
my black bill-of-fare—how to arrange its entrečs—to say which of all
its monstrous grievances ought to figure as pièces de resistance—to
usher in the entremets of annoyance, the hors d’auvres of wrong, so
as to give each its due value—to set out and garnish the sours which
do duty for its sweets, the unmerited oppressions which may stand for
#: dessert, so that nothing shall be lost of their acrid and irritating
avour.
“The public dinner—you will perhaps say—is the heavier inflic-
tion; but then the private dinner is of most, frequent recurrence.
If, as I admit, the festive meal bears off the palm for wearisomeness
the family repast is the more meagre and monotonous. Who sh
strike the balance between the discomfort of “pot-luck’ and the ic
º of the set entertainment?, Who shall accurately wei
is anxiety, who invites his friends to his own house, against, the
penalties of him who asks his acquaintance to a spread at the Trafalgar,
or the Star and Garter
“Take thee as we will, dinner, thou art a bitter draught! Whether
I encounter thee upon washing days, under the mean misery of cold
shoulder, or at festal seasons of the year, behind the monotonous mask
of boiled fowl and saddle of mutton—whether thou lurkest in the stale
soup and flaccid salmon of the Freemasons' Tavern, or strikest chill
into my soul over the starched white neckcloths of Belgravia—whether
thou leapest forth on me unawares from the ambush of an unceremo-
nious invitation, or offerest me up, a solemn sacrifice, in the lingering
agonies of a fortnight's notice—whatever the figure, form, fashion of
the Dinner-torture, I do, hereby, denounce it, and call on all my fellow
sufferers to aid me in putting it down!, We no º press criminals
to death in Newgate, if they refuse to plead: the rack has been chopped
}. and burnt for firewood long ago: Smithfield faggots survive only in
the speeches of MR. Spoon ER, and the dreams of the old ladies to
whom CARDINAL WISEMAN is as Bogey, and MR. WestERTON as an
angel of light: the pillory has been discarded as brutal: even whippin
at the cart's tail has been put down, as too savage a punishment. An
yet-inconsistent beings that we are—we, keep up the dinner-torture
in full vigour! It was never more severely and sternly inflicted than
now—in this soft-hearted nineteenth century, which coddles its
criminals, beweeps its burglars, and tends its Ticket-of-leave men with
a more than parental tenderness. These men have offended against
the laws. But what have we done to deserve dinners?
“But I would not be misunderstood. It is not that I have any ob-
jection to dinner in the abstract—to dinner as a part of the social
economy. Quite the contrary. Few people more highly respect the meal,
or are more grateful for a good one than I am. I complain of dinner,
not as it ić. could, or should be, but as it is—as we have made it.
A cruel ingenuity has been shown in perverting into a weariness
and an oppression an institution which might be eminently pleasant
and profitable; indeed, which must be eminently pleasant and profitable,
when properly understood, and set about in a genial, honest, unpre-
tending, unselfish spirit. My readers must bear in mind that I am
writing neither for the cream of the cream of society, nor for the dregs
of the dregs. My shafts are aimed neither at His Grace, the DUKE of
BEAUMANoir, nor at BILL the Costermonger. I eschew alike the stately
family-mansions of Grosvenor Square and the squalid tenements of
Drury Lane. I sail in the great Mediterranean—the middle sea.
appeal to the sympathies of that vast class which touches the House of
eers by its upper strata, and includes the Trade Directory in its
lower—of that enormous body of my fellow-citizens to whose daily life
state and splendour, profuse expenditure, and large establishments are
unfamiliar—the great of whom rarely soar above a single footman,
with perhaps a satellite in buttons; and who, if they rise beyond the
humble cab or politer fly, stop for the most part at the modest Brougham
or cozy Clarence; # º: the cumbrous chariot, or the for-
ii. family-coach. To this order I am proud to belong, and in this
wide zone, with occasional glimpses into the stately region of aristo-
cratic state above me, and the too squalid domain, of hard-labour
# º below, my experiences—dinner and other—have been
gathered.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CIIARIVARI.
“They have been as various as painful. Bad dinners assume so
many forms. Take our family dinners, for example. These, as a rule,
are made miserable from culpable carelessness, and neglect of Heaven's
good gifts, which would be insolent, if it were not so ignorant. O
young women of England, if you but knew how much depends on
dinners! I am inclined, sometimes, to think that the pivot on which
the fortunes of home-happiness hang, is planted in the centre of the
dining-table. Do not imagine me that most odious of human creatures
in female eyes—an epicure. I am none, I protest, unless it be ac-
cording to the sailor's interpretation of the word, ‘a beggar that can
eat anything.” I have an excellent and most accommodating appetite.
I can be happy with a leg of mutton, I am thankful to say... Nay, I am
that domestic pearl beyond price—A MAN WHO LIKES Čóil)
MUTTON | Be composed, ladies, Do not rush to each other's polls.
Let your pretty caps remain unpulled for me. I AM married.
“But while I avow myself content with a leg of mutton, I must
insist on it that the mutton shall be good mutton, and that it shall be
done to a turn. I say, I have a right to insist on this. Being, as I am,
endowed with an apparatus of palate, tongue, fauces, most cunningly
constructed to apprehend, retain, and distinguish flavours—with a
nerve fibruncle, probably, for every distinct impression of taste which
I am destined to receive in my whole life—I feel it nothing less than a
religious duty to keep this machinery agreeably and delicately em-
ployed. I am bound to cultivate my gustatory taste, as I am my
aesthetic—in the same manner, if not in the same degree. On the same
rinciple that I refuse to condemn the latter to a diet of MAESTRo
REsſex.TE's music, or a course of the colossal pictures of SPRAwl, of
the ‘British Artists’ or of the miniature niaiseries of MINNIKIN–Asso-
ciate that is, Academician that hopes to be—I object to condemn my
gustatory organs to Newgate market Saturday night mutton, or to
Hungerford market Sunday morning fish; or, be my mutton and fish
of the best, to the former under or overdone, or the latter half-boiled,
or fried in bad oil over a slow fire.
“I fearlessly assert, that while we have a choice of good and bad
viands, so long as there is a distinction between good cooking and bad
—be the meat of the simplest and the cooking of the plainest—it is
absolute guilt in a wife to be careless which she gives her husband,
positive sin in a husband to be indifferent which is provided by his
wife. I would have young women brought up in this conviction—in a
respect for the institution of dinner—in a reverence for the art of
cookery—in a practical warfare against the doctrine that ‘God sends
meat, and the devil sends cooks.’ I grieve to say that this part of
female education, so far as I can ascertain, is now utterly neglected.
It was not always so. Our great-grandmothers were early initiated
into the culinary mysteries. Witness those family receipt-books—
arcana of ancient kitchen lore-laboriously compiled, reverently
studied in the parlour and the hall, and only communicated to the
kitchen, as oracles were transmitted of old to those who consulted
them, with religious ceremony and awful pomp. Not that those fair
heads ever stooped their powdered piles over a stew-pan, or exposed
their rouge and patches to the blaze of a kitchen range. They planned;
their subordinates executed. The intellectual conception of dish or
dinner belonged to the mistress; the manual execution was confided
to the cook-maid.
“That was the proper division of labour. . No lady has any business
to meddle with spit or casserole, Cooking is an art, and should have
its professors, who must not be rashly interfered with Amateur
cooking is like amateur fiddling, or amateur painting. The non-pro-
fessional and the ...f erformances should never be inter-
mixed. But just as good professional music or painting demands
trained unprofessional ears or eyes to judge, and enlightened unpro-
fessional patronage to guide it, so the good cook requires intelligent
eaters, and above all, an appreciative and cultivated mistress to direct
and encourage her efforts.
. But how seldom can cooks now-a-days count upon such mistresses!
Here I must break off for the present. My subject opens more and
more widely upon me. I feel there is matter in it for many letters from
“A SUFFERER.”

THE ERMINE AND THE MOTLEY.
N a joke pronounced by the Bench
there is something peculiarly droll
—the pun, for the jokes of Judges
always are puns—is heightened in
ludicrousness by a certain pleasing
incongruity perceived between the
jest and the Judge. The judicial
joke is a relief, also, to the tedious-
mess of legal proceedings, and is a
gratifying evidence of humour
and patience on the Judge's part
under circumstances that would
irritate and fatigue ordinary minds.
The jokes of the venerable Judges
are generally as venerable as them-
selves; their lordships joke by pre-
cedent; but antiquity, which is a
disparagement to the witticisms of
other men, imparts a certain raci-
ness to their good things. Now
LoRD CAMPBELL, one day last week
made a fine old joke. He, an
eleven other judges were sitting on
the case of the § v. ListER and
BRIGGs—the defendants indicted
for a dangerous nuisance. When,
according to the Law Report:—
“The CHIEF BARon alluded to the case of a butt of beer bursting at MEUx's some
years since, when men were drowned.
“Lord CAMPBell. And it might be said that they were found floating on their
watery bier.”
... We can only regret that the joke was not followed out by the jolly
interlocutors. As thus:–
The CHIEF BARON. That bier is rather a grave subject.
LORD CAMPBELL. All right. Grave as a Judge.
The CHIEF BARON., “From grave to gay.”
LoRD CAMPBELL. “From lively to severe.” And now we have got
to that, suppose we proceed to judgment.
A judicial joke on drowning is fair enough, and must be regarded as
an improvement on the wit which our legal sages sometimes used
formerly to indulge in on the seat of justice, in allusion to another
mode of suffocation.
THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN.
SIR ERskINE PERRY's Bill for the better security of the rights of
married women, has met with so favourable a reception that, should it
not pass during the present session, it may pass in the next century.
We, however, hope for immediate legislation upon the subject. There
are two clauses in the present Bill that no man, at least no husband
who is not an absolute brute, can object to. The first makes a married
woman answerable for her own tongue; and therefore relieves the
husband of a responsibility that, since the invention of marriage, no
man has known how to grapple with. A wife who in the effervescence
of her temper says something not very affectionate of her sister wom
shall henceforth answer for the damages committed by the iº
organ. Well, this may be just; nevertheless, it will now and then
wring, the conjugal bosom to know that notice of action has been
served upon JEMIMA; that a verdict of damages has been given against
her; and that, as it may happen, a judgment may carry, female bone
from bone male to the Queen's Bench. However, the rights of
women must be respected; and with this conviction, the judgment
must be, allowed to take place, and—foolish fellows as we are—we
must yield nothing to weakness.
The second right about to accrue to married women is, the right, to
pay their own debts. We do not know, for a surety, whether this
portion of the amended law will tend, to make the shops of bonnet:
makers and milliners less attractive, less seductive; but we should
think it not unlikely. As the injustice of the º operates, a
woman loses nothing in yielding to the temptation of dress, seeing that
the husband must pay for it. But with women fully possessed of their
rights, it will be otherwise. Thus, a woman who, cannot pay for her
own dress will, upon her own account, go to gaol for the debt. We
understand, however, that the benevolence of the legislature will
ind itself” to the allowance of the following amendment:—“That
whereas, every woman committed to prison upon a judgment debt
contracted for her own gowns or petticoats, shall not be confined
within the walls, but be allowed to live “in the rules’ of her own
Crinoline.”

**
THE SURPRISE AND DELIGHT OF THE GENERAL COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF AT THE SUCCESS OF THE
MEW STRAW STABLES AT ALDERSHOT.
LOUIS NAPOLEON LEGITIMIZED.
THERE can be now no doubt of the º of Louis NAPOLEON.
Could St. DENIs himself return to the world, head in hand, he could
hardly fail to acknowledge the present governor of France, by divine
right of a certain night in December, EMPEROR of THE FRENcH. What
the crown had left undone, the hat has effected. The hat of the Louis
THE FIFTEENTH mode makes sacred the adventurer of Boulogne; and
the late special-constable of St. James's Street sits upon his horse in the
forest of Fontainebleau a legitimate descendant } St. Louis. Poor
Count CHAM BoRD ! He and his pretensions are put nowhere; they
are, in fact, left shivering and º for Louis NApoleoN has stolen
the clothes of the ancien régime, and HENRY THE FIFTII, has not a
legitinº te rag to cover him. The whole matter, through the con-
scientious columns of Galignani, speaks to Europe. Thus it is.
The GRAND DUKE CoNSTANTINE is taken to Fontainebleau to enjoy a
stag-hunt. We are told that when the Muscovy Ambassador became a
little too rough and ready in his manners, even for QUEEN ELIZABETH,
the Virgin Queen of England would i. rid of his Excellency by sending
him off with a party to hunt the wild boar in the wood of M.
We had boars, in those days; but Marylebone is now merely a forest
of bricks, and the boars, if not extinct, are scattered. ell, to
employ the imperial mind of Russia, LQUIs NApoleoN lately prepared
a stag-hunt. And more, to recommend the sport with especial grace
and unction to his Russian guest, the French Emperor went, back a
little into those picturesque days, ere Voltaire dropt, vitriolic acid
from his pen on the purple of royalty, ere. RoussEAU preached something
like maternity into France, at that time with all her children at wet-nurse.
In a word Louis NAPOLEoN sat for the time in the saddle of Louis
THE FIFTEENth. The transformation was so complete that, upon the
word and honour of several veracious courtiers present, France seemed
to retrograde a century or two, in order to make the illusion perfect,
For a time, it almost seemed that France—although she had reeled
somewhat under the shock of the tumbling Bastille—had never been dis;
turbed from under the protecting shadow of the péraque of le grand
*...*. as though, in very truth, the citizens of France, as in the
days of Louis THE FourTEENTH, might be put by in a stone-safe, with
no trial and no questions permitted to be asked; as though the freedom
of the press was yet an undiscovered good, and liberty of speech was
still the visionary dream, the brain-fever of mad, bad men. With Louis
NApoleoN as Louis THE FIFTEENTH, a certain antique haze gathered
about Fontainebleau; the feeling of the time pervaded even his courtiers,
for their faces seemed lackered with the complacency of the olden time;
their back-bones bent with the supplemess of a former age. The very
people, the peasantry raised and emboldened by the work of the
guillotine, seemed shrunk and dwarfed, and walked or slunk like the
villeins of the good old day. Such is the spiriting of the tailor
hatter, and bootmaker; and so did their genius work when it ha
clothed Louis NAPoleóN, the royal hunter, in “a green coat with gold
lace, the waistcoat red, the lower part of the dress being white, with
high hunting boots. The hat. Louis THE FIFTEENTH, a flanger, and a
whip completed the costume.” Would the oldest inhabitant of ancient
Strasbourg have known the chivalrous adventurer in such a coat-
would Boulogne, have recognised her Knight of the Eagle in that
waistcoat—would any I. hatter have identified his old customer
in that beaver of the time of Louis THE FIFTEENTH P We think not.
No: the parvenu had passed away, and the representative of the line
of HUGH CAPET stood before the Imperial DUKE CoNSTANTINE of
ALL THE RUssIAs.
The day of that Fontainebleau hunt, was a great day for France.
Represented by her ruler, she had taken a great step backwards,
whether pour mieur sauter is to be seen; but we fear a jump in advance
can be no great jump in so tight and ceremonious a dress. Any way,
when the GRAND DUKE CoNSTANTINE shall next meet HENRY THE
FIFTH, it will doubtless be a *: of some mirth for the Muscovite
wag (it is scandalously said of him that he is given to a joke") to
inform his throneless Majesty how the partenu Louis NAPOLEoN looks
in the furbished-up clothes of Louis THE FIFTEENTH.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SOCIAL TREAD-MILL.-No. 5.
F course, it has occurred to
you, Mr. Punch, what a bene-
factor of his species that man
would be who should leave a
large fortune to found and
endow a college for Cooks.
When I consider the science
and art that must combine in
a good cook, and the crass
ignorance and presumption of
most persons assuming the
title, } am astonished that
some benevolent individual
has not thought of establish-
ing a normal school of culi-
nary instruction—where the
whole round of the science
might be taught, from boiling
a potato up to a dinner of
three courses. -
“There might be periodical
examinations by skilled per-
sons for each department of
study.—A Board of Irish
one of London Aldermen for
turtle, and so forth. There
might be cook-lists, like Uni-
versity class-lists—with ordi-
. degrees, and honours
and medals. The Cooks'
College should not be a place
for educating cooks with a
view to domestic service, but
a normal institution, from
which highly qualified culi-
, nary, teachers, might be
planted all over the country—each the head of a local culinary school. It should be com-
F. on every girl of a certain age, to have attended for a certain time at such a school.
do not know that I should not make the production of a certificate of such attendance a
ºf. condition preliminary to marriage, and impose a heavy penalty on the clergyman
who united any young woman in holy matrimony without such a certificate. -
“It stands to reason that the instruction in these National Cooking Schools, should differ
for different classes. There should be the poor-man's wife course—the respectable trades-
man's wife, or middle-class course—the soup-and-fish-every-day, or thousand-a-year course—
and so upwards. A young woman on entering would be entered for the course appropriate
to her station in life. . So there would be a special curriculum for those who aimed at
qualifying themselves for cook's places. But all women ought to have a certain minimum
of culinary *::: and therefore I would insist on the certificate in all cases. . .
“I really think the man who first endows such a Cooks' College, and the minister who
first introduces such a compulsory system of national culinary education, will each deserve
a statue—I beg pardon—will each deserve—not to have a statue, but—to be commemorated
in whatever form we may succeed in devising that is not both ugly and ridiculous. -
“But after all, bad cookery is the worst that, cooks have to answer for. ...There is
undoubtedly a lamentable amount of had cookery-in other words, of discomfort,
indigestion, and waste—in this country. But the remedy for this lies in a great degree
beyond our own power. Indeed, until the far-sighted, patriot arises to found my
..", college, I do not see my way to any very general elevation of the standard of our
COOks.
“Bad dinners, however, depend on something very different from bad cookery. Indeed,
there, may be very bad dinners with very good cookery, and even very good dinners ºcca-
sionally with very bad cookery. I call every dinner a bad one where the people have been
invited for any other principal reason than because their host likes them, and is liked by
them; where the mistress of the house is fidgety, or the master of the house uncomfort-
able; where the guests are too many for the table, or the servants not enough for the
guests; where in an establishment evidently mounted on the leg-of-mutton-scale, I am
treated to two courses and champagne; where a variety of wines are handed round, but
the glasses º half-filled; where a pine-apple is put on the table at dessert and carried
away uncut; where the plate comes from the pawnbroker's, the entrées from the pastrycook's,
or the waiters from the greengrocer's round the corner; where a thousand a-year is made to
do duty for five, or where five thousand narrows itself to the proportions of one. In short
every dinner is a bad one which is out of keeping with the house in which it is eaten; and
I grieve to say, that the proportion of such dinners to the total number consumed in London
is very great indeed. - -
“Condemned though I be to the Social Tread-mill, I am of a cheerful disposition, and gay
in the intervals, of my punishment. Yet, into how many drawing-rooms do I enter, , in
fulfilment of solemn dinner obligations, where chilly, constraint and cowardly ceremonial º
en weights upon me and every soul present! , when I dine with the Kotoos, do
pull off my naturalness and cheerfulness with my paletot, and draw on a certain starched
and constrained self with my white gloves?, Why is the quarter of an hour before dinner
in that house so much longer than any other hour in the day elsewhere?, Why do, we
all fall desperately to talking of the weather? Why, but that we are one and all conscious
of some unreality or inconvenience, or humbug, or incongruity in our being thus assembled.
examiners for potato-boiling, all fi
There is BLADEBONE, the barrister, with a
growing family and a decreasing practice,
thinking what a nuisance it is to have to pay for
the fly which brought himself and MRs. B. to the
hospitable door. There is MRs. B. scanning
MRs. FLAUNTER’s new glacé silk, and wonderin
whether the bill is settled at Howell, an
JAMEs's. FLAUNTER—who was in the Guards,
but sold out on his marriage, and is now on the
Turf, and in difficulties—has his head full of
judgments, cognovits, and odds, and bills
coming due, and IO U’s. “Ah, you’re a happy
fellow,” he sighs, to M.R. PENNYBoy, the City
magnate, as that distinguished capitalist gives
him the º of a remarkable rise in the
shares of the sixth new company he has become
a director of this year; PENNYBoy chuckles
huskily, and tries to look as if he agreed with
FLAUNTER. But he knows that he is sailing on
the fathomless sea of speculation, buoyed up by
bubbles, and that the bursting of any one of the
six may sink him. Here is a young author; of
course it must be very delightful to him to meet
tle quarterly reviewer who cut up his last book
so humorously. And here are two Mammas
with a daughter a-piece, and only one eligible
young man of the party—Pleasant situation for
We .
. “Now every one of this party has been
invited, not because the Koloos take particular
pleasure in the company of any of their guests,
or imagine that any of their guests feel particular
pleasure in coming; but because they have been
invited by the BLADEBONES, the FLAUNTERs,
and the PENNYBoys, and think it a duty to invite
them in return. The Reviewer and the Author
are the show-pieces—the stalking-horses—the
ornaments of iſ. entertainment, and the youn
ladies, with the Mammas, are the baits provide
for the Reviewer and the Author. The eligible
young man is asked because he is so very eligible
in every way—and does credit to every house
where he condescends to dine. In short, here
are all manner of motives for bringing the party
together, but the one motive that can make the
party pleasant—the desire of giving and receiv-
ing pleasure.
“Is any one here really the happier for seein
another? Is there one who would not, if he ha
his or her own will, rather be at home than in
the Kotoos' drawing-room—always excepting
GUTTLETON, the Reviewer, who is a bachelor,
and has no home, and would (but for the Koroos
invitation) have had to pay for his dinner at the
Athenaeum—a thing he hates. But poor BLADE-
Box E would infinitely have preferred the homely
hash which MRs. B. would have treated him to
—three days’ table-cloth, small beer and all- to
the Koroos', three courses; and no wonder,
seeing that the privilege of stretching his thin
and threadbarelegs under their mahogany stands
him—including gloves, fly, and a new collar for
MRs., B., -at least a sovereign. ... FLAUNTER
would have preferred a smug little dinner at his
Club; leaving MRs. F. to her own arrangements
at home—for similar reasons, to BLADEBONE'S.
PENNYBoy has already vented his feelings, with
regard to the Kotoos' invitation, in the shower
of imprecations with which he accompanied, his
toilet. He has “other things to think of than
those people's dinners,’ &c. &c.
The Mammas wish each other at Jericho-and
the eligible young man wishes himself in some
place, if there be º where young women
are not flung at the heads of eligible young
men.
“Of course, under these circumstances, it is
to be expected that the Kotogs' party should be
an uncommonly lively, cheerful, unconstrained,
and open-hearted gathering f
“So much for the guests.
“But the dinner?–Let us see how the
Kotoos redeem the mal-arrangement round their
mahogany, by the style of entertainment they
put upon it.”

“Well—I AM blow'd if that ain't too bad—for to go
RIDic'Lous manner.”
WHO NAMES THE NAVY P
NExT to those momentous queries, “Do you bruise your oats yet?”
and “Who’s to win the Derby?” we think of all the questions of
the day, the one we most want answered is the one that heads this
article? We rarely see a notice of an Admiralty ship-launch, without
its “seriously inclining” us to write off to Bell’s Life or the Famil
Herald, and beg that those all-knowing ones who answer Corres ...!
ents will kindly tell us who is the Purveyor of Names for the Navy,
or in other phrase, who acts as the Government godfather.
We are tempted to ask this, not from any wish to pry into the
secrets of the State, but from sheer respect for the genius in question,
and qur unbounded admiration of his talent for misnomer, which so
clearly proves his being the right man in the right place. What, for
instance, can surpass the exquisite Appropriateness of christening by
such names as the Transit and, the Urgent, ships, in which transition
was the last thing to be looked for, and which for urgent service
therefore were quite sure to be selected. To an ordinary mind it
might have seemed more suitable to call a spade a spade, and to have
christened the Admiralty steam-tubs by such names as would have
been suggestive of their characters. W. ourselves, perhaps, had we
been entrusted with the sponsorship, might have chosen, as more
lº, to our tugs of war, º: as the Snail, the Sloth,
the Crazy, or the Granky: taking it for granted that a ship built by
the Government will not only turn out “ §: but “Sure” of break.
ing down, if not of breaking up. It might never have occurred to us
to try a more sarcastic nomenclature, and indulge in pleasant fictions
of an Urgent or a Transit; in the creditable hope that the unfitness of
the name might be attractive of attention, before it was too late, to
the unfitness of the vessel. We almost question though if sarcasm can
be anyhow made sharp enough to penetrate the Wood that there is in
the Whitehall board; and as we never have much faith in any treat-
ment but our own, we shall continue now and then to call the
Admiralty names, until we find they have the sense to give their ships
more fitting ones.
Above all Price.
THE report that certain French º (MEssRs. PEREIRA
MIREs, MILLAUD, and other Rothschildren of wealth) had combined
their millions and billions for the purpose of purchasing Punch is
ridiculously untrue; and for the best of all reasons, because there
would not be capital sufficient in all France put together to command
such a purchase.
MONEY AND MARRIAGE.
THE Lord CHANCELLOR's new Divorce Bill
maintains due homage to the majesty of the law
and the profits of the lawyers. A man's wife
still remains to him his goods and chattels.
a man possess a beautiful picture, a magnificent
piece of porcelain, and either picture or pottery
is maliciously damaged or fractured, the owner
thereof has, of course, a remedy at law for the
injury. He brings his suit, and is awarded in
recompense so much money. Now the law as it
is left by Lord CRANwokTH, leaves the wife of
a man's bosom in the condition, no higher and
no lower, of the picture and the vase. If spotted
or flawed she is to be paid for, and there an end.
Very commercial, this; but not very compli-
mentary to the dignity of human nature. But
so it is. When a wife fails to be good, she is
= |goods.
BEAKS AND BEER.
MR. HARDY has introduced a Beer Bill, the
object of which is to extend the system of magis-
trates' licences from public-houses to beer shops.
What big brewer is the particular friend of
MR. HARDY : Why, since all public-houses have
to be licensed by magistrates, are there any low
ublic-houses, the resorts of rascals and thieves?
Why not, instead of extending the licence-
system, abolish it altogether ? Is it the opinion
of everybody except the big brewers, and the
Injustices, their confederates on the Bench, that
the wisest way of dealing with beer would be to
establish Free Trade in that article, and grant
publicans liberty instead of licence?
WHAT LOCKSLEY HALL SAID BEFORE HE PASSED HIS
OXFORD RESPONSIONS (vulgé SMALLS).
Inscribed TO THE POET LAUREATE.
QH the misery of “Smalls!” the cark the turmoil and the grind
Oh the cruel, cruel fetters which are wreathing round my mind!
There is grammar, there is Euclid, and far worse than all of these,
Arithmetical refinements, with their stocks and rules of threes,
With their discount and their practice and their very vulgar fractions
Smashing up the one ideal into many paltry factions.
Square root makes the head to ache, the decimals the tear to start,
For they’re ever circulating round the fibres of my heart—
Learning grammar is like putting water in a leaky pot,
And its memory is only like the days remembered not;
Werbs in “MI” are aggravating, Euclid makes the foot to stamp,
Only lucid when enlightened by a moderator lamp,
The old spider and his cobwebs! Would that I could sweep him out
From the dust and must of ages with a triumph and a shout;
Shall I spurn him with my foot, or shall I scorn him with mine eye?
Shall I tear him into pieces? Šourney burnt him—so willf.
The Maynooth Nuisance.
MR. Spoon ER is defeated, but not, convinced. The honourable
entleman was considerably affected by his failure on Thursday night
º it was remarked that he had partially recovered his constitutiona
flow of spirits on Friday evening. This cheerful º; as we have
heard, was entirely wrought by a sympathetic letter addressed to him
by the orthodox editor of The Morning Advertiser, who, in the hand-
somest way, offered his columns for the rest of the session to the
pleasing polemics of the LUTHER of North Warwickshire. “May we
not trace the noble dust of CAESAR till we find it stopping a
bunghole?”
Presents from Portugal.
THE KING OF Portugal has sent to the QUEEN a present of cattle
—a bull, a bull-calf, and two heifers of a dun colour, and not more
than six-and-thirty inches high. Portugal, having despatched these
little cattle, when may Portuguese bond-holders expect her to post the
pony, no matter how little the pony be, to begin with ?

MAY 30,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LORD JOHN RUSSELL SETTLING THE JEW BILL.
“THERE! Go To THAT NICE GENTLEMAN; HE 'LL MAKE A MAN of You.”
FLOWERS FROM CUPID'S GARDEN.
WE have to inform those of our fair readers who need the informa-
tion, that there is a fellow in Paris, named CQNSTANTIN, an artificial
florist, who is a regular duck. Our authority for this statement is our
fashionable contemporary, by whom M. CoNSTANTIN, styled the great
Parisian fleuriste, is said to have executed, among other “works,” a
wonderful bunch of gillyflowers. We will do ourselves the pleasure of
transporting a vast number of young ladies, and not a few ... ones, by
uoting some extracts from our contemporary’s glowing description of
this production of genius. In the first place M. CoNSTANTIN has been
honoured with Imperial patronage:–
“The bouquet of giroſtae (common stock), which he executed from nature, has
been thought worthy of presentation to the EMPREss.”
From what follows, one is inclined to wonder that the Imperial bees,
if EUGENIE was wearing any, did not leave the garment which they
were embroidered on, and settle on the mimic gillyflowers:
“It may be truly said to outvie nature in its bloom and freshness. So minute is
the execution of this giroffee, that botanists have declared that, even with the help
of the microscope, no fault or omission can be detected.”
We have often heard of magic branches, but for truly enchanting
properties, never of any to compare with those of M. ConstanTIN’s
giroflée:–
“It is not made up into a wreath for wear, but is laid in long branches along the
back of the head, the peculiar green of the leaves serving to bring out the brightness
of the hair, while the bright blossoms of the flower heighten by many tints the
whiteness of the skin as they fall upon the neck.”
This is a clever arrangement—evidently a phrenological one. The
organs of the softer feelings lie at the back o; the head, as also does
that of the Love of Approbation to which, especially, the overlying
decoration must impart a pleasing stimulus. R. CoNstANTIN, we are
informed, has invented another floral excitant of the same sentiment:—
“ConstanTIN's rose-dahlia has also met with the greatest admiration. The
artist has produced a colour hitherto unknown in the florist's art; a kind of rich
§: Fº , which heightens the complexion, and causes the eyes to appear doubly
l
Much has been said, lately about the language of the eye, in
consequence of the exhibition of a ridiculous picture, as illustrative
thereof, in the music-shop windows. . The double brilliancy of the eye
produced by M. Constantin's rose-dahlia, is doubtless an example o
that language; the expression of the speaking eye being, as plainly as
words can convey the same meaning, “See how pretty flook.”
THE CUCUMBER AND THE BOTTLE.
§ fablf.
ONgE upon a time, a cucumber, whilst still growing on the vine,
Was .." by the gardener in a bottle that it might therein come to
its full size. The bottle was a large, bottle, and the cucumber grew
and grew, and at length attained its largest possible proportions.
But this was a fact the cucumber could never be brought to admit.
There remained plenty of room in the bottle, but the cucumber always
quarrelled with it for being too narrow. ºf tell you what,” said the
cucumber, “I give you fair warning; depend upºn it, I am, already a
cucumber of such immense dimensions it isn't likely that such a paltry
little bottle as you are can hold me. Depend upon it, some day
shall burst you”, “Pooh, pooh,” said the bottle, “you’re a very
respectable cucumber, but there’s room and plenty to spare. And as
for growing any bigger, why you’re already in the yellow rind.”
“Yellow rind,” cried the cucumber; “but you’re beneath my con-
tempt. Therefore, I shall not condescend another, word to such a
blatant beast of a bottle. Only remember this—I’ll grow and burst
you.” Upon inquiring of the gardener what manner of cucumber
could at once be so contemptuous and so tremendous, the man replied,
—“That Cucumber, Mr. Punch, is called the NAPIER.”
SALMon ScARce.—A NewsPAPER paragraph lately stated that one
SALMoN, a banking agent, charged with defalcations to, the amount
of £30,000, had absconded. If this is the case, we should be glad to

THE SOLON GOOSE TO THE EARL OF MALMESBURY,
GREETING,
Y DEAR LORD,-" As a goose
I thank you for myse and
the other water-fowl, late
inhabitants of St. James's
Park, but now of Kew. Your
beautiful speech in the House
of Lords has warmed our
very gizzards ; even the
ducks and the 'noddies ac-
count you sage. You, are
quite right; when our lake,
or pond, , or whatever you
may call it, in St. James's
Park, was left unreformed,
there was what you beauti-
fully call “aqueous vegeta-
tion;' and now the water 's
to be paved with concrete to
please SIR BENJAMIN HALL’s
crotchets in the abstract.
Duckweed, my lord, I con-
sider an institution; and I
and all the birds of my fea-
ther thank you for the manly
conservatism that would pro-
tect the time-honoured vege-
- - tation of our waters. The
fact is, if SIR BENJAMIN's allowed to have his full .# we shall all be
killed with cleanliness. I’m told that he has dug to light a spring in
Duck Island, ‘which will º the whole lake’ with pure water.
Now, my lord, how are we to live upon purity? A certain amount of
wholesome corruption is as necessary to the existence of us water-fowl
as to the Ministry of HER MAJESTY's Government. We must even pine,
and dwindle, and die upon this excess of purity,+which admits of no
soft unctuous mud, no lº decaying matter, no relishing filth to
be chemically converted to the breasts and wings of ducks and geese.
... “Consider it, * lord. We have been told that the water which
is henceforth to fill our lake evidently comes from the Thames, being
filtered on its passage through a bed, of sand, two-thirds of a mile in
thickness.' Now, can even so much as a tadpole live in so pure, I
should say, so insipid an element? Filtered, indeed! If the streams
of the Exchequer were thus filtered, what would become of such
pensions as LoRD ELLENBOROUGH’s, who has, however, the thanks of
all of us web-footed for his support of your lordship, who, indeed, has
talked like one of ourselves. -
“I remain, for self and others,
“You R SoLON GOOSE.
. “P.S. I send you one of my own pen-feathers for your coronet.
You’ve won it well, and, as somebody says, may you wear it long.”
ECCLESIASTICAL FASHIONS.
. His Holiness THE POPE will be about the house of certain drapers
in Regent Street; an establishment calling itself the “Sponsaſia.”
They advertise a “Patent Pallium.”. Now, the right of conferring the
Pallium is reserved by the PoWTIFF to himself, and he also holds that
the Pallium which he supplies is the only genuine and original patent
article. The house in Regent Street must therefore look out for the
thunders of the Vatican. . For whom the Patent Pallium is intended we
can only surmise. If it is not designed for the fair sex, it has perhaps
been devised to meet a want of the Puseyites, who have been cryin
for copes and stoles, and other millinery, and will probably be §
with a pretty Pallium. Having got that, perhaps, they will next, per-
adventure, be desirous of wearing Crinoline.
CAN'T BE TOO CAUTIOUS.
A STATEMENT has been going round the papers about an exceedingly
fine trout, which has been “hooked” by agentleman in one of the
rivate banks. MR. GRoyE, the eminent fishmonger, has given it as
s decided opinion, that if the fish had been allowed to live a good
deal lºnger it would have been a great deal larger. This proposition
we will not dispute, but we do not see the expediency of inviting the
public attention, just now, to a banker's iº. anything. Luckily
the bank mentioned happens to be one of adamantine, and almost
Pre-Adamantine reputation, but, still the words “bank” and “hook
it.” should be kept apart, in these days, as jealously as lucifers and
THE BARK OF MARYLEBONE.
Did you ever have occasion, gentle reader, to remark
How exasperated Westrymen and Poor law Guardians bark?
Ever hear the Poor law Guardians smarting under dire affront,
And the Westrymen indignant, how they growl, and how they grunt?
If that sweet parochial music ever has your ears . - |
Then you will conceive the grunting, growling, barking, that prevailed
When SIR BENJAMIN HALL's porter the official door had shown |
To the snubbed and disappointed Beadledom of Marylebone.
On SIR BENAMIN they waited, with intent to ply his ear
That the Government no longer with their rights might interfere,
With the vested and prescriptive rights they had enjoyed so long,
With the rights divine of beadles, rights to rule their parish wrong.
|
Rights to flog º women; rights poor lunatics to treat
How they pleased, old privileges to the race of beadles sweet;
Rights SiR BENJAMIN contested; rights he ruthlessly denied,
And dismissed the deputation their diminished heads to hide.
What! they barked, the beadles, heretofore supreme in Marylebone,
What! they growled, must we not do what we think proper with our
OWnt
What! they grunted, overrule us? our proceedings disallow?
Hrumph! Apretty state of things is this we’ve come to. Bow, wow,
WOW I
Centralisation, centralisation, bow, wow, wow," exclaimed the pack;
Bow, Sir, wow, Sir! Centralisation! Everything must go to wrack.
Local government destroyed, Sir!, Constitution ºverthrown'
Hrumph, Sir, eh,Sir? why, Sir? what, Sir! Interfere with Marylebone!
Tell us what we shall and shan’t do—us who fix and pay the rate!
Marylebone’s an Institution, Marylebone’s the Fifth Estate.
There’s the QUEEN, the House of Lords, the House of Commons, and
the Press -
And the Marylebone Westry—in importance nothing less.
Will they tread the mighty down, Sir? Will they trample on the free?
Humº. i. eh, Sir bow, wow, wow, Sir! we shall see, Sir, we
SIlall. See.
Nail our colours to the mast, Sir; no surrender is our cry; |
Bow wow ... ! we 'll fight and conquer, hrumph; or, bow, wow, wow,
we’ll die!
THE OVERLADEN AND CRUSHED ATTORNEYS.
HEARTSTRINGs of red tape and bosoms of vellum are all unable to
bear and endure the load that, an unfeeling Government places upon
the English attorney. . It is the last feather that breaks the camel's
back, and if the British attorney has not his vertebræ cracked by the
goose-quill of the tax-gatherer, it must be because the British attorney
is stronger and withal more º than a dromedary. LoRD Ports-
MoUTH, in seconding the address, said that “no tax was so grievous
to be borne as the attorney's bill-tax.” But then LoRD PortsMoUTH |
overlooked cause and effect. Why is the attorney compelled to charge
high prices? Simply to remunerate himself for the wicked and
#. impost that is fixed upon his profession. As sportsmen are
obliged to take out a licence to shoot, so is the attorney compelled to
pay a licence to practise. We do not see why surgeons should not be
equally taxed with attorneys, for we are very certain that it is not
given to them to bleed less.
The Ravenous Public,
“ENCORE 1" cried a º wag at Cremorne the other evening,
after a brilliant display of fireworks, and we fancy we have heard the
same cry on similar occasions. However, the facetious demand is the
best satire on the stupid system of Encores...MR. SIMPson might with
equal justice be expected to give a repetition of his fireworks as a
popular singer be called to repeat every one of his son There are
gluttons, however, who, if ... SAQUI fell from the tight rope,
would go away dissatisfied if the accident wasn’t encored.
Tallow and Gruel.
MR. SIMs REEVEs had been singing Come into the garden, Maad
when there, arose a vehement outcry for an encore. “ Ladies and
Gentlemen,” said the popular tenor, as soon as the noise had somewhat
abated, “I am sorry to inform you that MAUD is labouring under a
severe cold. In fact, her Mamma has just sent her to bed... Under
these circumstances, it will be quite useless for me to ask MAUD to
‘come into the garden’ again this evening. As soon as she has

HE's an Idiot that misses

who witnessed the tussle,
And wrote home the glow-
ing accounts for the
Times *
Here he sits on a horse (ra-
ther smaller than MIL-

Taking his notes, never
heeding the shells:
Be off to his lectures; he
gives them at WILLIS’s,
Fronted by all the most
elegant swells.
Ah! if you’d canvassed the
country, and asked a poll
Just to determine the one
little fact,
Who was our army's best
friend at Sebastopol,
WILLIAM's the boy we’d
- have heavily backed.
Yes, in those letters, so ge-
nial and graphic,
How he exposed the fell curse of Routine,
The system that makes a proud service a Traffic-
That was the story to tell to a QUEEN.
And how his fierce tales set the hot pulses leaping
When, in tones like a trumpet's, he told of the fray: -
How the broad sheet was dewed with the gentle eyes' weeping
That read how our brave ones in agony lay.

BASENESS ABROAD AND AT HOME.
THERE seems, just now to be going on a general revival of old
superstitions, old hoaxes, and old basenesses. We see simultaneously
lifting themselves into notice, trying to re-establish and re-instate
themselves in the world, Popery, Witchcraft, and Flunkeyism. ..Qf the
latter of these three Disgraces, hand-in-hand by the way, with the
former, an eximious display is afforded in the address of CARDINAL
SCITowzky, Primate of Hungary, to the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA. A
little of this fulsome stuff—of such stuff a little will go a great way
P. subjoin, under favour to the Pesth correspondent of the Morning
osa.--
“Imperial Majesty! Apostolic King ! Very Great Lord ' This day the Hunga-
rian nation sees her most ardent wish fulfilled in the supreme happiness she enjoys
of saluting Your Majesty and Her Majesty the Empress, as also of being able to
bring the homage of your faithful subjects to the foot of your exalted throne.
“Human words are not equal to express the exuberance of our joy and the senti-
ments of affectionate gratitude which we feel—we, not only those who are happ
enough to contemplate the sacred presence of Your Majesties, but all your faithful
subjects.”
Having, by the above dose, created extreme nausea, let us stop at
that. Surely the EMPEROR or Austria himself must have shuddered
in undergoing lubrifaction with such abominably rank butter as
CARDINAL Sgitowzky's—cannot but have been disgusted with such
masty and false adulation. In keeping with servility such as this, the
daily continental news is replete with affairs of uniform and livery,
ſº and silver coats, crimson breeches, gold-laced hats—a specimen,
the way, of a hunting costume–crosses, orders, medals, all manner
o ee, tinsel, embroidery, and plush. Foreign intelligence is
redolent of fetid flunkeyism. Dazzled b
the buckles, gilt, laced
jackets, thunder-and-lightning shorts, an
other the like glories of
* the Editor to extend the kindness still further by never slac
despotism, a certain crew of menial-minded creatures are beginning to
whisper a despicable hankering, for the exchange of our British
constitution for an Empire. The sycophantic spirit, and the vile
sentiment of splendour-worship are at work even here; a circumstance
lº' worthy of note: for there is little fear that John BULL will ever
et himself be persuaded by any reptiles to swop his broad-brimmer
for the cocked hat and the cockade, his plain broadcloth coat for a
variegated, laced, and braided one, his cords for plush, his tops for
pink silk stockings and buckled pumps, and his cudgel for a gold-headed
cane. Perhaps, even abroad, the strides which Flunkeyism, and the
† Hºmbus, are now apparently making, may be, in reality, their
aSt. KICKS.
A TEETOTAL FALSTAFF.
GEORGE CRUIKSHANK is about to reform that incorrigible tippler,
Jack Falstaff; to which end we are to have his life from authentic
sources that will show, how cruelly the poor man has been dealt with
by the poetic licence of MR SHAKSPEARE. Now, under the pencil and
patronage of GEORGE, it will be shown that, if Falstaff were at any time
addicted to sack, he did not leave the world a hardened drinker, but
duly took the teetotal pledge—a fact, hitherto, shamefully º:
§ the poet, Thus, the description of Falstaff’s death, as edited by
EoRGE, will doubtless receive the following emendations:—
“”A made a finer end, and went away, an it had been any christom child ; 'a

cried out—Water, Water, Water / three or four times: now I, to comfort him, bid
him 'a should not think of Water. And then 'a took the pledge; and then 'a passed
away, and still 'a cried Water, Water, Water!"
GEORGE having carried theºº:: into º will allow nothing
stronger at the Boar's Head, Eastcheap, than ginger-pop. This is
really too bad, and we must protest against this forcible conversion of
inimitable Jack. As for GEoRGE himself, he does all, we admit, “ in
conscience and tender heart.”, GEQRGE is, brimming over with the
milk of human kindness; but why, why should the milk be mixed with
so much water P
Delicate Attentions.
THE Editor of the Morning Advertiser has received from the French
Embassy the Cross of the Legion of Honour, and a magnificent kettle-
holder worked by the fair fingers of EugéNIÉ herself. These § are
accompanied by an autograph letter from the EMPEROR, in which he

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH*S EXHIBITION OF REJECTED
ART-TREASURES.
[PRIVATE VIEW.]
-
sº
EEING it stated in the Daily
Neues that on the opening
of the Manchester Art-
Palace—
“From the unprecedented
liberality of the British public
there are still about five hundred
specimens left, for which no
corner can be found,”
Mr. Punch at once wrote
9 to the Executive Committee
and placed at their command
the entire space at his dis-
posal, consisting of the whole
of one third part of his
back office. This fº
offer being thankfully ac-
cepted, Mr. Punch is now
engaged in making a selec-
tion from the treasures
which have reached him, and
will shortly have the honour
of inviting H.R.H., F.M.
PRINCE ALBERT to declare
his Exhibition open. Mean-
while, having just been in-
dulging in a private view,
Mr. Punch will treat his
- - readers to a foreglimpse of
the show which is preparing for them, by publishing beforehand a few
comments on the catalogue.
To begin with the Paintings, (which comprise several chefs-d'-ouvre
of both old and young and intermediate, or middle-aged masters,)
Mr. Punch rejoices to announce that he has kindly been entrusted by
MR. B. DISRAELI with the companion picture to the Blue Boy of
GAINSBOROUGH; representing MR. D. as the Calculating Boy, looking
very blue upon his recent calculation of the odds against his ever again
getting the Exchequer Cockership. Next to this will be observed that
prodigiously remarkable picture of disgust, which has become known
as The Rejected Title, a work of fancy, furnished from the WILLIAMs
collection, and both in incident and treatment considered quite
unløue.
Passing by a Portrait of John Chinaman, from the CoBDEN gallery
which seems very far from being painted in true colours, Mr. Pune
has then to call attention to a valuable series of historical pictures,
illustrative of the progress of the British Constitution. These havé
been contributed by LoRD JoHN Russell, and not the least known of
them is that of Signing Magna Charta, with which his Lordship's
frequent reference must have long ago made every one familiar.
Among the Marine Pieces—which include a bird's-eye view of Cron-
stadt, taken (at a distance) by ADMIRAL NAPIER—Mr. Punch has had
to unpack several small pictures of the Wessel of the State, repre-
senting her as º the quicksand “PALMERSTON; but
these mostly appear taken from a one-sided point of view, and being
done in party cºlours, have all the sickliness belonging to distemper.
Several sketches in outline of the New Reform § have also been
sent in, but as far as can be judged from their unfinished state, they
are sadl defective in that breadth of design and boldness of treatment
which the subject, clearly merits. It is possible, however, that, before
they are exhibited, Mr. Punch may be solicited to remedy their weak
points, and a few touches by so old a master would be certain to be
recognised with public satisfaction.
Up to the last moment SIR RoBERT PEEL has not, thought fit to
}. with any more of his travelling sketches; but as he is now free
rom those confining ties of official reserve, by which he formerly was
held so in restraint, it is possible that he may soon let Mr. Punch have
something to. exhibit, that is, to show up. SIR. Rob ERT is world-
famous for his taste in caricature; and Mr. Punch must, therefore,
elsewhere assign the contribution of a picture, which illustrates thé
late }%. FREDERICK PEEL, zoologically rendered as The
Red Tapir Unearthed.
Among the armoury will be found some noticeable specimens, such
for instance, as the shield which was used by the Government to shield
from justice the Incapables who were so hotly charged by the Crimean
Commission. Mr., Punch has also succeeded in obtaining one of
the cutlasses which were signalled to be sharpened, in order to
secure that preciseness of firing which was expected to demolish
Cronstadt; - -
Mainly by his own exertions in collecting, Mr. Punch will have a
quantity of curiosities for exhibition; including, as a work less of
vertu than of vice, a leaf taken out of Mr. CAMºrºs's "green led er,”
which he used to do the shareholders so (HUMPHRY) brown. With
this will be shown, as specimens of carying, some pretty figures repre-
#." the respective fortunes, which were carved by the British
Bank directors out of the moneys entrusted to their keeping. Mr. Punch
has likewise been so fortunate as to obtain the sheet of paper which
was crumpled up by MR. CoppeN, in illustration of the way in which
to crumple Russia; and together with some specimens of Civil Service
spelling, which he has no doubt, will be considered curiosities
Mr. Punch has succeeded in getting from the Government the original

A JOLLY GARDENER'S GARDEN.
THE Glasgow Mail contains a statement that an old gentleman, who
cultivates a model farm in the neighbourhood of Govan, has n
trying the experiment of irrigating garden plants with whiskey, success-
fully; though our Caledonian contemporary does not explain what is
the nature of the alteration or improvement which has resulted in the
cabbages and cauliflowers that have been treated with this new form
of liquid manure. On the animal economy whiskey is apt to produce
the effect of seediness; and perhaps it will also occasion a tendency to
run to seed in the vegetable economy, if there can be any economy in
vegetables, which, to denote a Scotch practice by an Irish form of
expression, are watered with whiskey. If the plants have too much
whiskey given them, perhaps º will not grow straight; the eyes of
the potatoes may be affected; and all the greens and other herbs may
be seized with a shakiness of leaf, like that which is natural to the
leaves of the asp, but which, in the case of the garden-stuff, the
teetotallers will all concur in declaring to be delirium tremens. Possibly,
one effect of whiskey upon vegetables will be that of preserving them;
at any rate, that spirituous fluid may be expected to make them—if it
does not keep them—fresh.
[Adventisement.
O THE MUSICAL PROFESSION.—If the GENTLEMAN who was
calling “Sparrergrass,” in the vicinity of Pimlico, on Monday morning last,
will forward his Address to Signon Boreas O'BLUsTERo Professor of Harmony, Cat
and Bagpipes Tavern, Holloaway, he may hear of an Exoage:MENT suited to his
talents. SIGNor B. O'B. having lately been promoted to the bar of the establish-
ment, has in consequence retired from the harmonious department, which he has
for many ..". the honour to conduct. The vacancy thus caused it is in-
tended to submit to public competition, and candidates for the Conductorship must
send their Testimonials to the above address two clear days at least before the per-
sonal examination, of which hereafter due notice will be given. As the post is one
requiring more than common vocal powers, it is hoped, to save both time and
trouble, that none but the possessors of the very strongest lungs and voices will
apply.
}. addition to E. every night at the Harmonic Meeting, the Conductor will
be called on to officiate as toast-master, at all the public dinners which are given at
the Tavern; and he will likewise be required to give his vocal services at most of the
Odd Fellows' feasts and Goose Club suppers that are held there. He must therefore
be competent to undertake the solo business; and in order to maintain the high
reputation which the Cat and Bagpipes has acquired as being a first-class Musical
Establishment, his repertoire must include the latest works of the best masters,
such, for example, as the gifted HENRY Russell, and the talented Composer of the
“Ratcatcher's Daughter.”
There being also now some vacancies in the Chorus department, the gentleman
referred to at the head of this Advertisement is earnestly requested, if this should
meet his eye, to make mention of the matter to such of his acquaintance as may be
known to have similarly powerful organs. In order to secure the highest vocal
talent, it is the intention of the proprietor of the above establishment to spare no
expense in his professional engagements. The most liberal terms may therefore be
depended on, and in addition to the salary, (which will be guaranteed by a lien on
the piano—subject only to the prior claim of the owner, it being merely a hired
instrument) each vocalist will have allowed him plenty of "paper," both in orders
and cigars, and will each evening be supplied º white kid gloves and grog at the
expense of the house, with the addition of the nightly loan of a dress suit.
or further information, apply in person at the Concert Room, between the
business hours of 3 and 5, A.M.

MR. Punch begs to lay before his innumerable readers the following letter. It will no
doubt be remarked that the writer says many more than two words
one for herself; but Mr. Punch does not omit the former, because
linked with the latter:-

message very affably, and, at the end of the week, with all
kind speeches, gave the bride £40,000 down, and £8,000 a-year for
what Mr. Punch trusts will be a long and happy life.
The LoRD CHANCELLOR introduced, once more, the Bill for reform-
ng the system of proving Wills. The proctors are not to be compen:
sated, but are to have the right of exclusive practice in the new will
courts. These astute gentlemen will not materially suffer by the
change—where there’s a Will, there’s a way, for a proctor to pocket
pickings. People are to be allowed to send their wills to an office
Monday. The QUEEN sent a message to Parliament to say
suggesting that something

in London, to be taken care of until wanted, so that from and after the
}. of the Act a discouragement, will be given to the novelist or
amatist, who is always finding wills in old clocks, in secret drawers,
behind looking-glasses, in cast-off boots, and other places where safety
is not so much an object as mystifying one's family and creating a
“situation.”
CoLoREL North pitched into Wiscount WILLIAMs for vilifying the
Army, which the noble Wiscount denied having done; but proceeded
to accuse military men generally of trying to impose heavy expenses on
the nation, for the purpose of promoting their own interests. To the
pachydermatous Wiscount this kind of conduct seems a mere trick of
trade, and it is not vilification to charge gentlemen with it. GENERAL
CopriNGTON stood up for GENERAL Ashburn HAM, and then the Navy
Estimates were taken. SIR CHARLEs Wood obtained 53,700 men and
boys, and about five millions and a half of money.
Thesday. The only tolerable debate of the week arose in the Lords,
on the Divorce Bill. e second reading was moved by the LoRD
CHANCELLOR, supported by LoRD LYNDHURST and LoRI. CAMPBELL,
and opposed by divers Bishops, a majority of the hierarchy, however,
voting in its favour. All the arguments were old enough, except one,
sorts of
of these numbers now, old and worn and frayed by
many a strong hand brought low by the Russian bullet
or pestilence. It shared the high popularity of the Illus-
trated London News, and remembering these old times, it
stirs the heart of Mother. Seacole like the sound of the
old war-cry she may never hear again, to find her poor
name noticed in the columns which cheered on England
to a noble contest.
“And more than this. Mother SEAcole in this, hor

so many ruined her—feels that the notice of her good son
Punch brings sunshine into the poor little room—not
quite a garret yet, thank God, she has one more weary
story to climb before her pallet rests so near the sky—to
which she is reduced.
“Not that tºe army's mother murmurs at her lot. She
knows that she is not flung aside like—like some of the
brave men for whose bl there is no further need; and
she believes there will yet be work for her to do some-
where. Perhaps in China, perhaps on some other distant

It will be evident, from the foregoing, that

world, and is also in danger of rising much
higher in it, than is consistent with the honour

Hands England has plenty to help her, if there
are any hearts to move them, and put them into
pockets containing more money than the pro-
prietors thereof know how to employ for any
praiseworthy purpose. Who would give a guinea

won which DR, HAMILTON, Bishop of SALISBURY, based his oppo-
|sition to the bill; namely, that P. if they were Christians, were
bound to forgive one another all offences whatsoever. Where does
this priest come from ?. He has clearly, fallen upon the wrong age.
Such a doctrine might be all very well in the early days of Christianity,
when its professors had to set examples, to the heathen, or it might
do for some outlandish place, where society has no claims upon one ;
but it is perfectly preposterous if advanced as a rule for our conduct
in these times. W. had fancied that Bishops were men of this world,
but DR. HAMILTON is a painful exception, and if he would exchange
the See of Salisbury for some missionary station in a distant country
his order would cease to suffer by his ridiculous teaching. Mr. Punc
was happy to see that the first law officer of the Crown sanctioned no
such Arcadian nonsense, and though “not pretending to, interpret
Scripture,” declared that it was not possible for a husband really to
pardon an erring wife. Some of the Lords, lay and clerical, were
very emphatic against facilitating divorce, on the curious ground that
if you enabled a man to get rid of a bad wife you taught him to hold
he sacredness of the marriage tie in light esteem. The DUKE, or
NoRFolk, as a Catholic, contended that marriage, was indissoluble,
and gave notice that he should try to shelve the bill. This comes ol
Catholic Emancipation—we set these people free, and they seek tº
impose chains on us. If his Grace carries his motion, Mr. Punch
means to petition for a repeal of the Act of ’29. The ARCHBishoi
of CANTERBURY and the Bishop QF LONDON voted for reform, and
indeed with the exception of a Bishop or two § for one)
the minority list is composed of the names of the feeblest creatures
in the House of Lords. The second reading was carried by 47
to 18.
The Commons did one foolish and one wise thing. They rejected,
by 221 to 86, MR. DILLwyN's bill for trying whipcord, instead of a
comfortable and costly imprisonment, upon scoundrels who beat and
illtreat women and children; and they carried, by 313 to 174, a motion
for abolishing Minister's Money (an objectionable church-rate, for
which an advantageous substitution is made) in Ireland.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Wednesday. The Commons got through some uninteresting,business,
but some petitions were presented º interesting to the parties
concerned, namely, Election Petitions. The time for presenting them
has expired, and there are nearly Sixty. , So it is º: that MR.
ijop will have to issue a supplement to his admirable Parliamentary
Companion.
Thursday. The Lords being all at the evening service appointed for
Ascension Day by the Book of Common Prayer, of course could not
assemble for secular purposes. -
The Commons, though they gathered, did so to hear a sermon frºm
the Reverend Mr. Spooner upon Maynooth. His own friends did
not muster strongly, there being. actually only NEwpegATE and one
other gentleman on the Opposition benches during the Qration, but
his enemies came in greater force, and, on division, in lieu of the
triumph once epically recorded by Mr. Punch, the valiant SPOONER
was defeated by 125 to 91, and, what was wºrse, nobody would reply
to him. Mr. Punch would like to, calm MR. Spoon ER's mind in
reference to his terrors about the Catholics, if that honourable gentle-
man cannot see that while Punch exists any triumph for Popery
is impossible. Punch is worth more than a hundred, of Exeter Halls
to Protestantism. When CARDINAL WISEMAN and his accomplices
have, with great labour and pains, spun a cobweb for the entrapping of
the lieges, Mr. Punch smiles, and pokes his stick through it, and the
Cardinal is obliged to take refuge in anonymous pamphleteering,
instead of boldly printing his name like Mr. Punch. But it seems that
Mr. Spoon ER is afraid lest the Irish priests, having been taught
treason at Maynooth, should practise it. Bless MR. Spoon ER's soul,
suppose an Irish priest conceived the idea ºf becoming a traitor, nay,
; convinced his whiskified conscience that he ought to be one, a
vision would come across him of MR. JUSTICE KEQGH, or some other
Catholic judge, who, if the worthy father carried his idea into effect,
would, without the faintest reverence for the teaching of Maynoºth
consign him to the cord or the convict-ship. Now, if the priest ha
really been properly instructed in Jesuitry, he would know that “self;
defence against a cruel judge is not only a right, but a duty,” and
consequently, that he is bound to keep his treason to himself, “provided
only }. he is a traitor in Intention.” Dear MR. SpoqNER, what
danger need QUEEN VICTORIA apprehend from . the disciples.o
Escob AR, with judges on the bench, and Mr. Punch in Fleet Street?
Sir RichMRD BETHELL introduced his Bill for dealing with Fraudu-
lent Trustees, and, moreover, as Mr. Punch expected, announced that
he would prosecute the Directors of the Britis Bank, who, it may be
presumed, have obtained their passports. SIR RICHARD was anxious
to impress on the House that he had not come to this determination
in consequence of any newspaper dictation., Qf course nºt, but Ap
ITHELL had read Ap PUNCH, though, who pledges his health in the
following giass of cwRw. (He drinks.)
Friday. LoRD PANMURE stated that he was nearly ready with a
complete system of education for the officers of the Army. What a
delightful change is in prospect..., Imaging the day...when, going per
rail from London to Woolwich, with a lot of young officers, Mr. Punch,
instead of being merely amused with biographies...of rat terriers,
speculations whether Jones will get his step, suggestions of remedies
for being blessed seedy, comparisons between the ancles of dangers,
eulogies on MR. PAUL Bºoroºp, and recommendations to read Bell’s
Life about the Slashing Butterman, Mr. Punch shall be instructed
with parallels between FABIUs and SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, descriptions
of the siege of Rhodes, essays on castrametation; discussions on
military engineering, citations from the Duke's Despatches, and
analyses of MR. WILLIAM RUSSELL’s lectures!
The Commons, after attending to the PRINCEss Roy AL in the
manner already stated (MR. Roebuck and the Wiscount objecting,
but giving way, and the vote being unanimous) took more Navy
Estimates, and passed the Transportation Bill., LQRD PALMERSTON
announced that the House would not sit on the day on which our
-“Isthmian Games” were celebrated, meaning, as, it was necessary to
explain to divers railway members, officers, and others, the Derby Day.
MEAT AND DRINK.
Swift, in his immortal Tale of a Tub, represents Peter as trying to
persuade his brothers, Martin and Jack, that a cut off a loaf was a
slice of mutton, and not only that but also a glass of wine. The fol-
lowing advertisement, which has ſately appeared, may be imagined to
have emanated from Peterº-
MoUTON, an excellent DESSERT CLARET, 36s. per doz.
This advertisement may º: a riddle, and occasion some wag to
ask, what that is which may be drunk at dessert, and eaten at dinner:
In imbibing Mouton wine, the archaeologist will be reminded of a good
old English beverage. Whilst he is, as it were, drinking Sheep, he will
remember that his ancestors were accustomed to quaff Lambswool.

IN THE SAWDUST.
LL well bred persons
are aware it is con-
sidered vulgar to
express surprise,
but however we
may jeopardise our
§. reputa-
tion, we must really
own to feeling some
astonishment on
ºf that an
opera had been per-
formed on horse-
back. Having seen
Macbeth hippodra-
matised at Astley's,
and having read how
Richard II. has been
mounted (in the
episode procession
A scene) at the Prin-
cess's, we have
grown somewhat
- accustomed to find
SHAKSPEARE in the sawdust; but we must confess we were cºn-
siderably startled to learn that WERDI had been put into the saddle.
It took us quite two minutes to recover respiration when we
heard Il Trovatore had been done at Astley's, and that as it was
“supported by the whole strength of the stud,” there was a strong
hope of its having a good run. Even yet we confess we, scarcely can
imagine a prima donna upon horseback, and, as it certainly would seem
to us, taking an airing while giving us her airs. Nor can we fancy
how the tender tenor can possibly pursue the even tenour of his way,
when he thus is brought to such a jog-trot existence; and we cannot
- is seat, how he can contrive to sing at all
with firmness. Even an Astleyian steed will caper now and then, and
every such prance must, cause a tremolo concerted movement of the
voice together with the body of the rider: so that in the execution, of
a rondo round the Circus, there would probably be many more shakes
introduced than the most florid of composers ever dreamed of.
If the experiment succeed (and we may at least congratulate the
º upon its acting on the maxim, Fiat experimentum in cor-
pore Werdi), of course we soon shall find it has been followed, and
every circus-master of the horse will become for the time a singing
master also. Perhaps Don Giovanni will tread next in the hoof prints
of Il Trovatore (and we would walk a mile ourselves, to see the
Leporello of LABLACHE a-straddle"). La Sonnambula might also be
“equestrianly illustrated;” and the walk over the water-wheel an-
nounced as a “daring feat of equitation.” Of all Operas, however,
the Beggars' is most suited to be set on horseback; and we are sure
Macheath would be quite certain of a hit, by continually tumbling off
two bare-backed steeds, and singing–
Oh, how happy could I be on either,
Were t'other fleet courser away:
But when trying to ride both together
On neither a moment I stay º -
Of course where a ballet or a ball-scene occurs, as, for instance, in
Roberto or Gustavus, there might be introduced a set of equestrian
uadrilles, or perhaps a º by performing ponies: and by way of a
finale, some hurdles might be brought, over which the º: might
jump to a conclusion.
Literature in America.
“IN America,” said MR. JUSTICE HALLIBURTON at the Literary
Fund banquet, “the author flattered the public, and the public flattered
the author, and there was no honesty {. them.” We should
rather say for our English selves—“in America, the author is robbed
by the public, and whatever, honesty may remain is wholly and indi-
visibly on the author's side.” For flattery, read moral felony, and the
sentence is, we think, greatly improved.

conferred on the author of Kosmos, the decoration of-a Grand Officer

at the thing, and consider the impudence of 84 great black spiders
claiming to suck £90,000 a-year out of the public. This petition has
settled the business. Be it also mentioned that LoRD DUNGANNoN
on the part of the very High Church, objected to the Bishops and
others preaching in Exeter Hall, to thousands who have no other
Church-accommodation. The Bishop of LoNDON, however, made this
Puseyite prig an eloquent and admirable reply, endorsed by the ARCH-
#. of CANTERBURY. The Lords took holiday from Thursday to
ursday.
A small knot in the Commons, 14 in all, endeavoured to reduce the
PRINCEss Roy AI’s dowry by £2,000, but 328 members confirmed the
original Fº sition. An attempt was also made to deprive the youn
lady of the £40,000 voted to her, but 361 were found for giving it, an
only 18 the other way. The clap-trap-setters in the minority will
easily be guessed at, but Mr. Punch will not assist the snobs in their
object by publishing their names.
The veteran PALMERSTON then came out as Secretary at War and
moved the Army estimates. He was doing the same thing in 1809,

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
May 25, Monday...The QUEEN’s Birthday, the Isthmian games, and
the approach of Whitsuntide, combined to furnish Parliament with
excuses for lightening its labours this, week. The Lords, applied
themselves to one subject only, namely the Divorce Bill, which they
discussed in Committee on ğ. and Thursday. The result of
their labours has to be edited by the Commons, and therefore it is
necessary only to say that the %. Catholic DUKE of Norfolk
was defeated by 123 to 26 in his attempt to get rid of the Bill on the
ground that marriage was indissoluble-that LoRD ST, LEONARDs
carried, against Government, a clause for depriving husbands, who
have separated from their wives, of the power of seizing the property
of those unfortunate women—that LoRD LYNDHURST was unsuccessful
in an attempt to have it declared that five years’ abandonment should
amount to dissolution of marriage, and that the Bishop or QXFORD
carried by 53 to 47 a clause preventing the re-marriage of divorced
persons. Flushed with his victory, the haughty SQAPEY made another
professional demonstration, and sought to leave it to an individual
clergyman to say whether he would or would not read the marriage
service over any one who hº to have been divorced, and desired to
wed a new consort; But this was a little too priestly for the Lords,
and SAMUEL was beaten by 78 to 26. Finally, an excessively strong
amendment was concocted and agreed to, namely, that henceforth,
where the wife has erred, there shall be no action for damages, but
that any man violating the Seventh Commandment shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and punishable by fine or imprisonment. In this
form the Bill stands at present, and all that Mr. Punch intends to say
upon a subject of more importance than, nineteen-twentieths of the
topics that come before Parliament, is, that the House of Lords is
treating the measure, with the grave and earnest consideration it
demands, and that he trusts the Commons will show equal good taste
and good feeling. -
A noticeable § was one raised on the report of the Wills Bill.
It was urged by 84 out of 104 proctors, that the Bill would reduce
their profits from £90,000 to º a year. We wonder that the
announcement of such a boon to the public did not induce the Lords
instantly to suspend the standing orders, and pass the Bill in five minutes.
when, as MR. John TIMBs informs us, he also gave orders for the repair
and improvement of the Horse Guards Clock. "Pay and the clock have
gone on capitally ever since, both receiving such additional enlighten-
ment as the age suggested, but always showing a good face to the
world, and being looked up to as favourite authorities. As regards
the Army, he explained that there was an increase in our cavalry and
artillery, but none in our infantry, and that he wanted about eleven
millions of money, a good deal of which was voted. The reason LoRD
PAM assigned for making the speech was, that the new young rich Under
Secretary, SIR John RAMSDEN, had not been long enough in office to
learn more than details. He has already learned enough, however, to
; rebuked for discourtesy to Members asking questions, so there are
opes that he will in time rival FRED. PEEL.
Tuesday. QUEEN VICTORIA kept her birthday.
Wednesday. BllNK Bon NY won the Derby, as prophesied by Mr.
Punch on page 122 of this volume, and by no other prophet whatsoever.
Thursday. MR. HENRY HERBERT, Member for Kerry, who owns
that lovely place by Killarney, where Mr. Punch, lentus in umbra, and
looking love to eyes that answered love again, did, some summers
since—but pshaw, this is º HERCULEs from the feet of
QMPHALE: So, so, Mr. Punch is himse f again. MR. HERBERT, then
the amiable Hº'. of charming property in Ireland, has accepted
the office of Irish Secretary, vacant by the resignation of the atrabilious
HoRSMAN. ..MR. KEATING, the barrister, and Member for Reading, is
e new Solicitor-General.
Prussia has signed with Switzerland; so that storm in a teacup is
hushed. MR. Roebuck brought on a debate upon our relations with
Brazil, and LQRD PALMERSTON explained that we keep a rod hanging
over the Brazilians' heads, to be administered elsewhere only in the
event of their not activel .# the slave trade. SIR CHARLEs
NAPIER (failing, as usual), moved for a committee to inquire into the
constitution of the Board of Admiralty, and among other pleasant
things, a la Cassandra, said that in the event of a sudden war with
France and Russia, §. WICTORIA’s throne would not be worth six
months’ purchase. He must have forgotten that he himself is not in
command of the fleet. BERNAL Osborn E peppered the old humbu
with some severity, but more effectual notice should be taken o
statements involving such charges against the Executive. It is clear
either that SIR CHARLEs NAPIER ought to be expelled the House and
the Service, or that SIR CHARLEs Wood ought to be hanged.
LoRD RAYNHAM, who is ...; an honourable notoriety by
trying to help, the helpless, endeavoured to obtain a committee for
inquiring into the working of the Act for punishing aggravated assaults
on women and children; but SIR GEORGE GREY, though professing to
believe that the Act was doing, much good, refused to consent to
the Mºustion of proof; and the motion, for which 84 voted, was
rejected.
Friday. BLINK Bonny won the Qaks. The CHANGELIOR OF THE
ExchEQUER ventured upon one of those pieces of official hypocrisy
which, thanks to Mr. Punch, are low seldom risked. He boldly de-
clared that Members of Parliament had no right to nominate candi-
dates for public situations. Literally taken, his assertion was true-
they have no such right. But in practice we should like to know
what MR. HAYTER would say to a regulation forbidding him to mark
his sense of the exemplary conduct of a Member of Parliament, by
handing him a bit of patronage, for a meritorious constituent. What
is the use of talking such folly * If Mr. Punch's lofty, virtue and
leaded bâton did not make it dangerous to º him with unworthy

the Wiscount seconded him, that the PRINCEss Royal's incºme should
cease as soon as she became Queen of Prussia. The feeling of the
House compelled the Papist and the Snob to withdraw the motion.
The attention of the House was called to the state of the Scotch
Pauper Lunatic Asylums, in which it appears that all the horrors of
which we read with a shudder as having been permitted, in other
years, in England, are in rampant existence. Scotland is too drunken
a country not to have much lunacy in it, but is so religious a country
that it ought to see that the unhappy victims of whiskey and Calvinism
are duly cared for.
The rest of the Army Estimates were taken, and the Commons
followed the example of the Lords in scparating for the Whitsuntide
recess.

melt him like butter.
THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS' WORTH OF someow.
At the late Chester races, certain persons, self-elected reden.
appeared upon the ground, inwardly moved to discourse to a turf
congregation on the sinfulness of the world in general and on the
atrocious wickedness of races in particular. Why not? Ginger beer
is allowed its stall; gingerbread nuts are permitted free vent. Why, Ch
then, should not the field preacher be permitted to froth with indigma-
tion, and to become red hot with zeal in the cause of sinners ? If
these turf apostles did not interfere with the running—if they
obediently cleared the course of themselves and their doctrines at the
proper warning, we see no reason why their sermons should be a whit
more interdicted than ginger-pop or ginger-nuts. However, the
authorities of Chester thought otherwise; and, by means of their con-
stables, conveyed away to safe keeping certain divine Qrators, taken in
the fact of expounding their doctrines of woe and desolation. The
preachers were for a time held in custody; and then discharged to be
embraced with fraternal love and refreshéd with sympathetic tears.
for a meeting was straightway convoked at Chester in admiration and
honour of the turf preaching oppressed.
The chair was taken by Win"Wiiii ºf TITHERINGTON, of the firm of
TITHERINGTON and—and pray let the reader mark the fact, and GILL,
and, we may add, SoMEs & Co.: for the grief, sorrow, and compunction
that have fallen upon partner GILL must, if the reader be not of stone,
However, let us first mote two or three lovely
bits of humility emanating from the preachers themselves, from the
men who had been in bonds. MR. REGINALD RADCLIFFE, a sufferer
said, “his poor hands had been steeped in vice,” but he had washed
them, and had used them in prayer at Chester races: for in race week
“Chester was drunkenness; Chester was fornication; Chester was
gambling.” Even so. |
“The business transacted between men during the race week in front of the
Royal Hotel, was very different to that transacted between tradesmen. When a
man bot another £5 to £100, the intention of the one was to gain the £100 and
-:
not feel himself, comforted as a Christian with so much money, won
from the wicked turf-the turf that is only a verdant covering to the
bottomless pit—and therefore, we are inwardly convinced, he is at this
moment casting, about him for the best means, of dispensing the
£30,000 that, otherwise, must be to him no less than thirty-thousand
tons of burning coals. . Yes, at this moment, the remorseful mind of
GILL bethinks itself of Chester Hospitals; of Chester Schools; of
ester Reformatories; and if he *". a moment in casting from his
soul that £30,000 weight, it is only that he cannot at a moment make
his, election of the object. , Let us, then, give the man of sorrow a
little time to consider and choose.
The naughty LoRD BYRON had a skull mounted as a drinking-cup.
A much more terrible vessel must be the Chester Cup to the eye of
the remorseful man who has won it; filled, we may say, with 30,000
sovereigns ! ...What a sea of guilt is there! What a draught for a
SATAN's Sabbath to be tasted by the whole, court of BEElzeBUp!
It is not given to the human heart, especially when touched by
remorse, softened by sorrow, to make a |...} thing of that Cup.
The repentant sinner cannot continue to behold it on his sideboard,
the yessel to his imaginative eye so “bubbles and boils with the
aconite froth.” that rises from the source of all cant and all hypocrisy.
We shall i. the earliest notice of the manner in which MR. GILL
bestows the hated, festering £30,000. In token of the worthy gentle:
man's grief upon his winnings, it is understood that his commercial
º, will in future be known as “TITHERINGTON, GILL, GRIEF,
AND UO.
retain the £5;—to gain the £100 for nothing. A tradesman would send an order N -
for £50 worth of things, and in return would receive goods to that amount, but on
the gambler's principle, in lieu of £50 worth of goods, the trader would receive a
quantity of empty boxes."
. Now, MR. GILL, of the respected firm of TITHERINGTON AND G|LL,
is a Liverpool cotton broker; and is reputed to have won no less
than £30,000 on the last Chester-cup. What a blow, then, is dealt by
preacher RADCLIFFE at, cotton-broker GIIL! What a draught of bit-
terness is he made to drink from that Cup of Death, the Cup of the
Chester Turf. Let us, however, not forget the humility of the
preacher. It is quite touching to learn the very humble conditions
upon which he is willing to enter heaven.
“He would again repeat what he had before stated, that he had not one ill
thought against MAJon FRENch (the magistrate), but would rejoice—if he were able.
and the Major would allow him—to go to heaven with him arm-in-arm, and with th”
high constable, and with the policeman who took him to gaol.”
What a sublime, what an affecting, picture!. How tender, how
lowly, too, the Christian spirit that would not refuse to go arm-in-arm
to heaven, even with—a policeman! This very fact will prove the
earnest humility that moved the preacher to the race-course; for after
much suffering in a cell, he is quite prepared to forgive the constable
who took him by the collar, and conveyed him to the dungeon, and,
slipping his arm under the policeman's, is quite ready and willing to
enter, Paradise with A.l. hat a subject for a chapel window, if
chapels permitted such flaunting vanities.
§. now come to MR. GILL, of the firm of TITHERINGTON and GILL:
to the forlorn and unfortunate MR. GILL, who received such a side-
kick at the heels of RADCLIFFE. TITHERINGTON, a man of gushin
iety, is in the chair; and at once answers a sneering attack, heade
“Saints and Sinners,” that had appeared in the Chester Chronicle.
What is MR. TITHERINGTON's withering reply?, Why, Tartuffe must
hang his head, ashamed; Cantwell is extinguished; Mawlcorm is
dumfounded.
“The paragraph in $º (says TITHERINGtoN) was headed “Saints and
Sinners, and was intended to offer congratulations to him on the success of his
partner, MR. Gill, in winning a large sum of money at Chester Races. He spoke of
the subject with deep humility and self abasement; his partner had been guilty of winning
a large sum of money at the races, BUT HE was HAppy to say THAT HE (MR. Gill) was
As son RY As himself, AND MR. Gill HAD REsolved NEveR To Be seen on THE
Course AGAIN.” |
It is almost too sublime a height, for us to hope to reach, to sympa.
thise with the sorrow of a man—that man, too, a partner of TITHER-
INGTON; day-book of his day-book and ledger of his ledger, who has
won £30,000 by a sinful horse-race!. But there is consolation to the
sufferer, even in the very depths of his grief—consolation arising to
him from the sweet resolve “never to be seen on the course again.”
This reminds us of the pathetic, the lovely line in the ballad of Will
Watch, the Bold Smuggler —
“When his pockets were lined, why his life should be mended.”
And the repentant GILL, with £30,000 at his banker's, turf-profits,
may cease to “make a book.” But we are certain that MR. GILL will
ORDNANCE ESTIMATES
MR. PUNgh hereby gives notice that, as soon as ever he is honoured
with a seat in Parliament, he intends to move for an amendment of the
| Ordnance Estimates, which with annual incompleteness, are furnished
by the Government. Instead of their embracing only the require-
ments of the Naval and the Military service, Mr. Punch would suggest
their extension to the Clerical. Mr. Punch cannot see why the great
guns of the Church should not as well be included in the list, and, the
public be made accurately acquainted with the cost of keeping them
in working order. Without being thought too inquiring an economist,
Mr. Punch would like to see an estimate as to what the nation now
expends upon such ordnance—from its minor canons up to its six-
thousand pounders; and Mr. Punch would like to know why, when a
#. gun has become unfit for service, it should not, forthwith be
lºsed without the nation having quite so heavily to pay the
SIlot.
Unnatural Subjects.
It is with indescribable pain that we call the attention of our loyal
readers to the fact that certain persons, assumed to wear the human
form, belonging to the Financial Reform Association of Liverpool, have
addressed the QUEEN and F. M. PRINCE ALBERT on the subject of the
PRINCEss Roy AL's dowry. These petitioners absolutely ask of the
Royal parents to provide for their own child ! But these petitioners
cannot be men. No; they must be pelicans.

Hooray ! Hooray !!! Hooray !!! Now, my noble patrons and swells, I'll warm
yer . Haven't I been and done it this time, eh? Brought you through with a wet
finger like a wetteranº Brought you through, sa, like a fiddle, as MR. Dicks Ns's
nigger coachman said: Like a fiddle, indeed like a base viol (only there's nothing
base about your humble), or that big thing that SIGNoR Bottysixl plays at the
Fiddleharmonic Concerts. How do you find yourselves by this time, my noble swells
and patrons? Pretty tollol and bobbish! Well, I should say you were, and that you
came to the right shop for racing information. Didn't I always tell you that if you
were not on the look out for lodgings in Bedlam, or the other fashionable retreat at
Hanwell, you must keep clear of those advertising humbugs, with their hints and
their howls, and their tips and their prophecies, and come to me. Well, you have
kept clear of 'em and their three pair backs, and their dens in the slums, and their
offensive slang and familiarity (which I hate and despise), and you have come to me
iny bobcuffins; me, the only true and lawful prognosticator and prophet. And
what's come of it, my tulips, what's come of it, I ask you, my noble-minded trumps
and Trojans ? Why, that you've all made your fortunes on this Derby. You know
it, and you are all saying to me “Here's towards you, my boy,” and your boy
answers as affable as a hedgehog, “Same to you, and many of 'em.”
What did I write to you all on Saturday the 28th of March last as ever was ? Take
down your Punch, and look back to that date—the 28th of March, weeks and weeks
ago. In Punch for that day, and no other whatsomever—left-hand column of left-
hand page—you will find these words:—
“THE LEAVEs of THE ELDER should Now open, AND IF THOSE or THE YouNgER
should shut, THEY MIGIIT Hold BETTER Books when
* B L I N K B O N N Y"
COMES ROUND TATTENHAM CORNER."
Now then. Is there any deception? Are the words there or not? Of course they
are. There was my Tip, for which I only charged you threepence (country folks
fourpence,) while the dirtiest snob of an advertising fellow would not send you one
of his tobacco-smelling, rum-smeared missives, made up of humbug and chaft, and
giving you three or four horses, for less than five bob. For threepence you have
become rich coves. That was my advice: to take the odds which you could then
get, and wait. And where was my Mare on Wednesday, the 27th of May ? Suave
Mari magno, and she is a great and a sweet mare, and no error.
Well, I congratulate you, my noble patrons and swells. We've been and done it,
as I forcibly remarked. All is serene. Keep your hands off your cheque books. I
don't want any of your winnings, like the advertising scoundrels. I’ve pocketed a
pretty pot of my own, which they never do, for all their wonderful information, or
they wouldn't go sneaking and begging for presents, and whining, “Please to
remember the poor prophet, your honour !" They'll all lie, and swear they sent

she'd been roped for the “Guineas,” and that the spectators were as mad as

Just so in reading the Parliamentary debates which have hitherto,
since the opening of the new Parliament, been mostly of so pleasant à
length, one feels impelled to ask, how long will the speeches in the
House of Commons continue thus agreeably short The longer they
remain short the better; in the meanwhile their brevity, may be con-
sidered as a hopeful symptom of considerate and merciful feeling on
the part of the legislature, likely to cause benevolent legislation.

I
THE DELIGHTS OF SPRING.
A SONG BY A WEGETARIAN.
SPRING's delights are now returning,
See where sprouts the crisp seakale;
Early greens and cauliflowers
Now command a ready sale.
Vegetarians now rejoicin
Asparagus again may dress;
And fewer doubts of what’s for dinner
Need their anxious minds distress.
They who fondly dote on pudding
With joy the new-born rhubarb see,
And greater rapture hails the budding
Of the prickly gooseberrie.
Now returns the green cuctimber,
That with nightmare doth distress:
While for those in peace who’d slumber
Springs anew the simple cress.
Now in large yet penny bunches
Radishes again are seen:
And the lettuce tempts to lunchcs
At the shops of grocers green.
Let other bards in rhyme discover
Joys that other seasons bring;
I, a vegetable lover, -
Tell the pleasures of the Spring.
THE SOCIAL TREAD-MILL. No. 6.
“ARRIVE as late as you will at the Kotoos, you always have to wait a
good while before dinneris announced. With parties composed as theirs
invariably are, under a profoundly mistaken sense of social duty—either
on the give-and-take, or mutual principle, as it is called in advertise-
ments of third-rate schools, or on the simple snobbish principle of wealth-
worship or title-worship, or on the lion-hunting principle, to which, as a
literary gent, I owe most of my invitations to dimer, or on all these three
principles together—you may imagine the half-hour in the drawing-room
is not particularly genial. How can such parties be good for mixing?
A very energetic and courageous guest—this time it was the popular
author—may, by a galvanic effort, produce a short, fit of general con-
versation, as you may mix oil and vinegar by a violent sudden shaking
of the cruet. But just as these soon resettle into their separate strata,
so do we, returning each to his own unsocial muttons. weary
delay is due to the suburban Gusiºn who supplies the dinner. If you
arrived late, you saw his light covered cart at the door. Five minutes
earlier you would have seen the flat green boxes disappearing down the
area-steps, -
“I wonder, it never, occurs, to the Kotoos that nine out of ten of
their guests have probably detected the cart and green boxes in
question—that, be their entertainment never so gorgeous, MR. GALAN-
TINE—who supplies breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, flowers and rout:

is of the plainest description. Of course, if one falls back on a GAAN.

of the Kotop order—what sort of an artist one has at home. Her
incapacity only affects the three hundred dinners we eat by ourselves
in the course of the year. For the ten days per annum on which we

own of two clubs, and survived the smash of six lordly establishments,
to which his ſº style of carrying on his part of the war in the
kitchen not a little contributed. He despises his present calling, and
lººks on himself as a sort of culinary NApoleon. This suburb is his
Elba. He amuses himself by planning these bourgeois dinners, as
the Emperor did by drilling his one battalion in the rocky Mediter-
ranean islet, But his heart is not in his work; and, to tell the truth,
the dinners he sends out are unworthy of him—very grand to look at,
and very costly to pay for, but yery bad to eat. GALANTINE also has
stooped to the vile worship of appearances, which poisons the neigh-
bourhood. He knows he is part of a system of shows and shams, and
h’s become false even to his own noble art—going for verdicts to the
£ye, and the pocket, but allowing judgment to be entered against him
by the palaté and fauces, his true judges.
“Hark! GALANTINE’s cart has driven off at last. If you had not
heard it, you might have guessed the moment by the lighting of Mrs.
Kotºo's eye. She was anxiously listening for the sound of the wheels,
for the weight of the flagging conversation is rapidly growing too great
for º to bear up under. Even Kotoo, dreary and ungenial and
hollow as he is, feels flatter than usual, and pumps up his pompous
nºthings with visible effort. The Reviewer is using up all (i. stock

Mammas have emptied their quivers of sharp things. FLAUNTER has

duly led up to the lady, consigned to him by Mrs. Koroo," to take
down to dinner,’ and had made his bow, and had felt he had nothing to
say, as how should he, to a person he never met before, and knows no
earthly thing about?--the dreariness was probably even more *

gible if not interesting. There are always politics to talk about—and
most men feel some interest in the money-market, and about the
Derby Day you arc tolerably safe with a little mild Turf intelligence.
“But now that we were distributed two and two, like the creatures
coupled for the Ark,+most of us, I may add, as dumb as they, the
situation was rapidly becoming untenable, when GALANTINE’s head
man, who acts groom of the chambers with GALANTINE’s dinners,
throwing open the drawing-room door with a magnificence of manner
which made the Kotoos blush and feel, humble at the very gorgeous-
ness of their own imposture, announced that dinner was served.
“But before we sit down to our prandial punishment, let me say
one, word on the subject of this ante-prandial pairing. Of course,

a days, on the Kotoo principle—that is on considerations quite inde.
pendent of the pleasure likely to be given or received—it is very little
matter how any man or woman, out of a dozen men and women who
don’t know anything or care *...* about each other, may be coupled.
Where boredom is the sure fate of all, what consequence a degree
more or less of the infliction?
“But let me ask the small—though I hope increasing—phalanx
of honest and genial souls who are content to invite people to dinner
because they love them, or at least like them so well that they
are happier for seeing them, whether this habit of ticking off their
ests two, and two, is ever desirable? I am inclined to think
it is not. It seems to be giving the two a peculiar claim upon each
9ther. Social monopolies are as bad, as trading ones. Everybody
in a party should belong to everybody else in the party. Talk round a
dinner-table should be common, and not confidential. If you want
confidences, choose, tete-à-têtes for, them. If there is wit or wisdom
going, all should share it. If, folly or imbecility or ill-nature want
vent, at least, don't let them shelter themselves under a whisper. I
should say, therefore, for my own part—no coupling before dinner.
Let the lady of the house show the way, and let the guests follow her
in a pleasant, unceremonious group, on the understanding, of course,
that the sexes are to be doye-tailed at table. But above all, let the
table, be a round one. Without this there is no, true sociability
possible. The best that can, come of an oblong table is a series of
agreeable tete-à-têtes. But then if the pleasantest couples are put
together, how unfair that is to the rest of the party. And if the

and ‘the round table’ go together. But I must say I hold them both
of yital importance to the true enjoyment of a sociaſ dinner.
“But what is this? I am of the Social Tread mill. The fact is,
that a sufferer. naturally wanders into sunny social speculations in the
ten minutes allowed for refreshment, just as the gaol convicts, I have
no doubt, stray away in fancy to pleasant public-houses, or delightfully
criminal beer-shops, in their hourly ten minutes respite from their
cranks and mills. But I must mount the wheel again, with the Kotoo
chain-gang. We are just sitting down—at .." orgeous table !
It is bedizened with flowers–à la Russe—and so long, that conversation
between the ends can only be carried on, I should think, by help of a
speaking-trumpet. Luckily Kotoo and his wife have the marital
telegraph of the eye. It will be hard worked during this dinner, I am
certain. We have sat down—solemnly. Pray for us, oh reader!”

COMICALITIES OF THE POPE'S PROGRESS,
IIE Pope's tour through-
out the Roman states has
of course, been attended
with some absurd incidents.
For example:—
“At Terni he visited the large
foundry of that place, where
several medals with the effigies
of the Saviour, the Virgin, and
the Apostles PETER and PAUL,
were cast in his presence.”
What extremely ..bad

- would forbid the slightest
allusion to that subject in the presence of the Roman Pontiff, precisely
as they would prohibit any, gentleman from, talking to a shoemaker,
away from business, about bristles and cobbler's-wax. To proceed:—
“When about to leave that place, some young men of the best families offered to
take the horses off his carriage, and to draw it, but this he would not allow.”
Here was a case of good taste on the part of the Pope, which it is
pleasing to notice. É. preferred horses to donkeys. Åt Spoleto a
mistake, similar to that committed at Terni, was made by the autho-
rities, who stuck up, right in his way, before the cathedral, “a large
wooden column surmounted by the statue of the Immaculate Virgin.”

mentioned received a just reward for their polite attention:—
“On alighting, he proceeded on foot to the Cathedral, and thence to the Episcopal
Palace, where he admitted all the authorities to the honour of kissing his slipper.”
The Giornale di Roma, whence we derive the foregoing particulars
does not state whether or no, when the Pork gave the authorities of
Spoleto his slipper to kiss, his foot was in the slipper. We suppose,
however, that to make the favour the more ſº and the more
suitable, as a repayment somewhat in kind of the civility which he had
received from them. This Holiness did put his foot in it.
Fire Insurance.
MADAME CoRNICHON (née SIMPLE), after reading the accounts of
the fire-proof dresses as lately tried with so much, success by the
Pompiers at Paris, ordered a gown, bonnet, veil, and an entire set of
under-linen to be expressly made for her, and, upon being pressed for
her reason for, so strange an order, said, with the greatest naïveté,
“Why the world, you know, is to be consumed by the Comet on the
13th of June, and I’ve no idea of being burnt to death.”

THE UMBRELLOMETER.
WE think the umbrella can be taken as a very good test of a person's
character. The man who always takes an umbrella out with him, is
a cautious fellow, who abstains from all speculation, and is pretty sure
to die rich. The man who is always leaving his umbrella behind him,
is one, generally, who makes no provision for the morrow. He is
reckless, thoughtless, always late for the train, leaves the street-door
open when he goes home late at night, and absent to such a degree as
to speak ill of a baby in the presence of its Mamma. The man who is
always losing his umbrella is an unlucky dog, whose bills are always
protested, whose boots split, whose gloves crack, whose buttons are
always coming off, whose “ change” is sure to have some bad money
in it. Becautious how you lend a thousand pounds to such a man!
The man, who is perpetually expressing a nervous anxiety about
his umbrella, and wondering if it is safe, is full of meanness and low
suspicions, with whom it is best not to play at cards, nor drink a bottle
of wine. He is sure to suspect you are cheating him, or that you
are drinking more than your share. Let him be ever so rich, give not
our daughter to him; he will undoubtedly take more care of
is umbrella than of his wife. The man with a cotton, umbrella is
either a philosopher or an economist; he defies the world and all its
fashionable prejudices, or else he does it because it is cheaper to lose
than a silk one. The man who fº to the Horticultural Fête without
an umbrella, is simply a fool, who richly deserves the ducking
e gets.
A WARRIOR IN ARMS.
MENTION is made in Tristram Shandy of an infant so, precocious,
that it composed a work the very day that it was born. The last addition
to the domestic happiness of the EMPEROR of Russia §"...i. be
some such another little prodigy; for among continentaſ intelligence
we find it recorded that—
“A letter from St. Petersburg, of the 15th, states that the new-born Grand Duke
has been named Chief of the 2nd Battalion of Riflemen of Infantry of Tobolsk.”
What a big baby must we suppose the new-born Grand Duke to be,
or what little soldiers must we imagine the Tobolsk, Riflemen!
the latter supposition, it will perhaps be surmised that the head
quarters of that Infantry Regiment are situated up-stairs.

of them—require to be informed that Haematorylon Campechianum is
what Botany calls Logwood, and that Prunus Spinosa is the denomi-
nation which she applies to the sloe. The Compound Spirit of Juniper
is one of the preparations in the Pharmacopoeia. Brandy is adminis-
tered in cases of debility. BARCIAY and PERKINs's Entire, and other

aculty.

arises the further question, who is to prescribe them?...When a patient
is attacked by symptoms which indicate the exhibition of a glass of
wine, he may not always be able to find a medical man, to write him a
prescription for the remedy...Suppose, for instance, he is dining at a
chop-house when seized with those symptoms ? This supposition
would be so frequently realised, that it would be necessary to have a
medical waiter in attendance, if wine, ale, stout, brandy, whiskey
rum, and gin were to be obtainable only by the prescription 3}
a qualified practitioner. Convenience would require the establishment
of a druggist's shop next door, where negus might be ‘ ". up,’ and
punch compounded, according to the recipe of the medical waiter. It
would also be his business to regulate the dose; but in practice—in
medical practice of this kind—the dose would, no doubt, be adapted
rather to the desire than to the constitution of the invalid. The
dose would be determined with reference, simply, to the medical
waiter’s fee. -
“Besides, Mr. Punch, it would be very absurd to subject, the trade
in stimulating liquors to greater restrictions than those which affect
the trade in depressing medicines. A drachm too much of Epsom salts
might be taken, as well as a drop too much of Alton ale, and with more
lamentable consequences; and black dose, in excess, would be at least
as pernicious as black strap. Alcoholic drink would have to be placed
on the same footing as family medicine: therein the law would be
obliged to leave the patient to minister to himself; the publican's
business would be amalgamated with that of the chemist and druggist,
the pharmaceutical establishment would expand into the gin-palace,
and ‘Medical Hall' would flourish under the auspices of the ‘Jolly
Gardeners.” Nay, a beer-engine would have to be added to the
appliances of the ‘Surgery’ annexed to the handsome residence and

EXETER HALL IN PARLIAMENT.
LoRD DUNGANNoN, in the Lords, inquired whether Bishops, and
other members of the Established Church can lawfully preach in
Exeter Hall, or in any other place not duly consecrated.
The Bishop of LoNDON made answer, and said that under the EARL
QF SHAFTESBURY's Act, all places were alike consecrated to the uses of
the Established Church.
LQRD KINNAIRD expressed himself very much delighted with the
intelligence.
The ARCHRISHOP or CANTERRURy thought it would not be wise to
“check these innovations.” Further, his Grace could not imagine
that any greater reproach or disparagement could be cast upon the
Church than to suppose “that it was incapable of accommodating itself
to the changing necessities of the age.”
All this is very cheering; very delightful; and MR, SPURGEoN com:
F. rubs the hands of his soul, and his soul meekly whispers, “I
ave done this.” And, it may be so. SPURGEoN sets up his tent here
and there, and with biatant trumpet calls in the stragglers. The
Bishops, a little, startled º, the very vulgar noise, mildly inquire
“What is all this pother about?” And they are straightway told
that the noise is made by an unestablished prophet, who has had no
hand laid upon him; that, such is the volume of his trumpetit reaches
through all sorts of winding streets; into courts, and up alleys, and,
more than that, even into the boudoirs of duchesses
And the Bishops, almost with one accord, say, “Dear brethren, this
never, do. To meet the changing necessities of the age, the
- timerant. Hence, for a
time, Exeter Hall may be even as St. Paul’s, and Canterbury Hall even
aS Canterbury Cathedral, Henceforth, the preacher shall make the
building, and not the building the preacher!' -
It is said that, a few days since, the Bishop of ExETER was seen in
the Zoological, Gardens, in deep conference with Mr. Secretary
MitchELL. The Bishop was heard to say, “he thought the pulpit
ought not to be pitched too near the hippopotamus.”
THE DUE OF PROCTORS AND DOCTORS.
It is very hard to have the business by which one subsists destroyed.
If the legislature abolishes anybody's trade, and does not indemnify
him, his is a cruel case. ... If the trade is rather a curse, to the com-
munity, still, so long as it is legal and not contraband, there seems to
be sone injustice in ousting him from it without making him certain
amends. Therefore, the feeling mind will recognise a glimmering of
reason in a question propounded to the Lord CHANCELLOR by the
EARL or MALMESBURY, on presenting a petition from the proctors of
Doctors' Commons against the Probate and Administration Bill—a
petition signed by 87 out of 104 proctors, setting forth that the Bill,
if passed, would cut down their gains from £90,000 to £15,000 a year.
Supposing-out of abundant charity—that there was no humbug in this
representation, we say that LoRD MALMESBURY did not ask an alto-
gether foolish question, when, according to Parliamentary Intelligence,—
“He wished to ask the noble and learned Lord on the woolsack, whether he did
not think it proper to give some compensation to the proctors and their articled
clerks, who had paid £800, or £1000 each upon being articled?"
No doubt, so long as the Testamentary Law remains in its present
abominable state, proctors are necessary evils, and to annul the
proctor's vocation without compensating the proctor, would not be
giving the devil his due. But if the devil is to have his due, in the
sense of compensation for the reform which enables society to dispense
with him; much rather ought the jº. to be duly indem-
nified for any loss which he may suffer through the removal of the need
for his ministration. When, therefore, a knacker's establishment is
su #. slaughter-houses are banished, pig-styes removed, cesspools
filled up, open drains bricked over, or any other nuisances abated in any
locality, according to statute in such cases made and Kºi. a Sunn
equivalent to the diminution of practice, which may be expected to
result from such sanatory operations ought to be distributed amongst
all the neighbouring medical men.
MAKING LIGHT OF BUSINESS.
Loyalty never burns, so brightly as when it, burns in gas. The
official birth-day of our beloved QUEEN, is, we think, on the 26th of
May; on which occasion, the commercial and trading bosom generally
labours with some new device that may beautifully combine the affec-
tion of a subject with the mainchance of a shopkeeper “God Bless

ASTOUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE SMALL COUNTRY BUTCHER
(WHO DOES NOT OFTEN KILL HIs own MEAT).
Maid. “PLEASE, MA’AM, MR. SKEWER says He’s A-GoING To KILL HissElf This WEEK, AND will You HAVE A Joint Fº
“OUR ISTHMIAN GAMES.”
HENCEFoRTH to talk of “the Derby Day” will be vulgar. In due
courtesy to Lord PALMERSTON, polite º will always say—“Isth-
mian Games.” Neptune had his horses, and Britannia has hers. We
trust, however, that the º: solemnised on the Isthmus of Corinth,
were less costly than the races on the Epsom sward. Indeed, we
believe that we are not premature in announcing the existence of a
society, whose purpose it is, to abolish Epsom, Ascot, Newmarket,
oncaster, and so forth., Indeed, all horse-racing is to be put down in
deference to public morals. It will be proved at the first meeting that
the horse, naturally a noble beast, is perverted to the basest purposes:
that, under certain discipline well known in “the stables,” the horse is
taught to pick pockets; and, in fact, as will be proved, to suggest
suicide. It is all very well to talk of the holiday that—to speak in an
old-fashioned way—the Derby Day gives to tens of thousands; but the
chicanery, the deceit, the swindling, that is carried on under the
equine excuse, the horse being, in fact, no more than a stalking-horse
to fraud, and robbery, is altogether destructive of public morals,
Attempt to regulate horse-racing according to Christian principles, and
the Derby Day must inevitably be a dies non. In fact, there is an
enthusiastic #. that advocates the total extinguishment of the breed
and use of the horse throughout the British Isles. The horse is made
the means of making men knaves and fools, rogues and simpletons;
the horse has driven men to self-murder, and it will be to the benefit of
the world that the horse should become extinct.
We understand that this society will be earnestly joined by the tee-
totallers. As some men are drunkards, so is it necessary that no man
should be allowed to drink: so is it necessary that vineyards should be
grubbed up all over the world, and all over the world planted with the
temperate potato. As men rob and cheat by means of races, so shall
there be an end of all running horses; nay, the very breed of horses,
even as the very growth of grapes, shall be prohibited.
We think the two societies worthy of one another, and wish them all
the success they mutually deserve.
THE use of much strong language in senior military circles is sup:
posed to have been occasioned by the following, passage, in the Times'
account of a review, held on the QUEEN’s birthday, at Aldershott:-
“Nearly the whole of the troops now wear the uniforms contracted for by the
Government, and not by the regimental Colonels. The importance of having super-
seded the latter gallant clothiers is manifested in the altered appearance of the men.
Their coats are of beautiful material, the privates .* cloth formerly given
only to sergeants, while the sergeants have the same as the commissioned officers.
Yesterday one or two men could be discerned still dressed in the old brick-cºloured
*::::::and having an indescribably dingy appearance among their well clad
comrades.”
The perusal of what looks j much like positive proof that very
many of the old clothing Colonels not only stooped to be tailors, but
also condescended to be dishonest tailors, must naturally makenumerous
old Colonels very angry. Those veterans may be excused for indulging
in some violence of expression, disgusted and indignant as they must
feel to find their laurels intertwined with cabbage.
Logarithms-Loggerheads.
To an ancestor of the NAPIERs the world owes logarithms; his fame
is well-known and widely acknowledged. But there is another NAPIER
whose reputation has been shamefully slighted, and that is the
NAPIER who first discovered loggerheads. His fame has never been
properly allowed by the world at large; but this we must say, in praise
of all his descendants. They, with a fine appreciation of the merits
of their ancestor, have always done their best to pay due homage to
the memory of his discovery. This delightful fact, we hold, admits of
no denial; for never yet did “the NAPIERs” mix with anybody or any
matter but loggerheads immediately followed.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
June 4th, Thursday. Holidays over, and the schoolmaster come
back from abroad. He-need Punch name BRough AM?—was in
capital health and spirits, and at once opened fire upon the Divorce
Bill, to which he has divers objections, chiefly founded upon its not
being sufficiently favourable to the wife. LoRD WESTMEATH (an odd
person for the work) introduced a Bill for regulating the bathing at

the Bill are, we understand, in course of signature by the class of
vulgarians and vulgariennes, who at such places as Margate and
Hºle, turn a healthy and delightful duty into what they term a
TR.
There was a great deal of talk in the Commons, chiefly directed
to the solution of the question whether the Board of Trade was of any
use. There can be no doubt that it is of great use, and that mere
commercial men are not, with all their spirit and cleverness, quite fit
to be entrusted with the exclusive control of our national interests.
The Master has spoken.
Friday. LORD CowLEY, as Punch warned the world would be the
case, has been made an earl, and took his seat “as such.” Why,
nobody knows, not, even MR. DoD, who moreover appends to the
recital of CowLEY's travels a cruel bit of satire, the more mordant
because entirely unintended.. “The first LoRD CowLEY was a dis-
tinguished diplomatist.” This will prevent anybody from falling into
the sort of error commemorated by MR. ToM MooRE—
“And (such a mistake as no mortal hit ever on,)
Fancied the present EARL “CowLFY' the clever one.”
In the course of conversation on Merchant Shipping, several noble-
men who have estates on our coast, and therefore get little bits of luck
in the way of wrecks, complained of being obliged to show that they
have a right to such windfalls—or waterfalls—which obligation they
deem a great hardship. Noblemen have improved since the days
when they hung out false lights to bring vessels on the rocks; and
neither LoRD GREY, nor LoRD DERBY, nor any other of the com-
plainants would even smoke a cigar on the beach if he º: a
merchant-captain could mistake the light for that at the North Fore-
land or Dungenness; but Mr. Punch thinks that they might go a
step further, and leave this kind of sea gleaning to the fishermen. The
Wills Bill was passed, LoRD CRANworth screwing §. his courage to
say that it was impossible to declare the proctors entitled to compensa-
tion. BEN Jonson (a dramatist of merit), had his estimate of the
animal called Proctor, and it may be inferred from a passage in
Bartholomew Fair, in which a clergyman says, “Every #. #. a.
proctor writes is along black hair combed out of the tail of Antichrist.”
CowLEY, in the Lords, Cows in the Commons., SIR.B. HALL
explained that, the vaccine, mothers, in Hyde Park had a right, to be
there, and paid for their lodging, all but five, who are the private and
W. cows of the superintendent. One wonders that Wiscount
ILLIAMs did not move for a return of the names of the cows, their
colours and ages, how much milk they respectively gave, how much
cream came from it, what counties they came from, what sort of horns
they have, whether any of them are old cows, and if so, what tune they
are likely to die of, distinguishing between those which stand still to
be milked, those that flap, their tails into the milker's eye, and those
that kick the pail over; also whether insured in the Farmer’s Assurance
Company, and for how much, and what number of calves they have
had, and whether any calf ever stood for Lambeth. The expense of
obtaining and printing the return would not have been more than £20
or £30, and what is that (out of other people's money) when a patriot
wants a clap-trap?
Complaints were made that election petitions often contained false-
hoods, and that there was no convenient way of punishing the slan-
derers. LoRD PALMERSTON thought that it did not much matter.

and generally to aid navigation and reduce transit #. The arrange-
ment is a sensible one, and as SIR GEORGE LEWIs happens to have the
money in his desk, it is no case of new tax. The Wiscount, of
course, with the large-minded political economy of a retail patriot,
could not see why anybody should pay for these imposts except the
merchants trading to Denmark, but the House had clearer perceptions
of the interests of the country.
Qn the Army Estimates there was a long debate about Aldershott,
a place which is a pºt of PAM's, and which he defended with spirit,
but which “bores” the officers, who hate living in camp (though they
have a club-house), and miss the billiard-rooms, flirtations with pretty
confectioneresses and milliners, and other delights of a town, So
they agree to represent Aldershott as of no use, and, inasmuch as there
are a great many blunders and short-comings to be detected there, the
r
enemies of the camp make out a sort of case. Equally, however, is it
certain that the bored officers can learn at Aldershotſ what the juke
said that not twenty men in the Army knew, namely, how to move

have in his possession the sock of THESPIs, and the buskin of Roscius,

preserve an odd glove of the beautiful object he adores, but to treasure
up the hind part of a shoe is going quite to the opposite extreme. We
imagine that it is valued as a striking proof of the passion with which

THE WELLINGTON MONUMENT.
The NELson memorial (to which his late. Majesty, NICHOLAs of
Russia, was in two senses the largest subscriber) is not finished, nor
is it likely to be finished. Who was NELsoN ? º it is fifty years
and more since he was killed in ºf the naval power of France
at a blow. You might as well talk to us of MARLBORóUGH, or BLAKE.
Mr. Punch will bet even money that ADMIRAL SIR CHARLEs NAPIER's
monument is complete before ADMIRAL LORD NELSON's.
But touching the WELLINGTON monument, Mr. Punch would laying
such wager. There is every reason to believe that it will be executed
forthwith. The authorities are eager to see the marble in hand. Not
perhaps, because of their intense veneration for the dead, but out ºf
their strong desire to serve the living. The Great Duke's memorial
will be left in charge of no laggard spirit of hero-worship, it will be
ordered by those who keep the nation's porte monnaie, and who will
disburse with a free hand when the applicant is well recommended.
Puffs preliminary are already scattered broadcast: We hear that a
certain Baron, “has designed a monument, which, if Government
#. it, will be erected in St. Paul’s.” Pleasantly and easily do
these announcements, half official, drop the fact that other sculptors
thereto invited by Government, have been labouring for months at
their ideals of memorials. Labouring privately, too, in compliance
with the terms that prescribed anonymous models. The Baron has
ublished his design, and if Government approve it, that is to be the
ELLINGTON monument. If Asif the authorities are likely to disapprove
anything by a Baron so recommended as the BARON MARRowPATTI.
łut the puffs are not haughty in their tone; on the contrary, it is
desired to imbue the public mind with the idea of what a memorial
ought to be. Familiarised with the MARRowFATTI motion, the people
be prepared to applaud. We are told that there are to be two big
bronze doors, set against the wall, *... to be the entrance
to a vault. This is a Sham, but Marlborough. House, so severe
. the flower on a carpet, or the bird on a wall-paper, will be alſ
silent courtliness. Well, before the sham doors is to be a figure of
Victory, outside, mind—though the Duke, instead of keeping Victory
away from him, was usually very much at home with her. This, how.
ever, is of the less consequence, as the Duke himself is also to be
outside his own mausoleum, indeed to be perched upon the top of it.
For this there are two good artistic reasons—first, if the Duke were
inside you could not see him, and secondly, he can’t be put inside,
because the mausoleum doors are sham ones. The effect would seem
to be that, of a lady weeping against the front door of a house, while
the party she is bewailing has got out upon the roof. That a great

to twit the gallant fellows with their “taste for

what he means, by offering for sale the mere
“interest” of a publication, in the management

we to infer that the publication itself will be
made the subject of a separate bargain?. Imagine
what a sell it would be to the buyer of a novel

disposed of ! Or, as a still greater stretch of

deal of this will be cleverly managed we have no doubt, for the Baron
is a clever man, with bold notions, which his fashionable friends cali
“fresh creations.” For a .#. º or a device for a fête, the
MARRowpatti Creations are admirable, but F. will look, in our
WELLINGTON memorial, for something more than a mere holiday surprise
—a contrivance to make good-natured Duchesses cry out, “ Dear me,
how º ingenious.”
That the Baron's design will please the authorities and Duchesses,
and will be erected at our expense in St. Paul's is exceedingly pro-
bable. The puffs have gone abroad in Fº and they enote
approbation previously secured. Possibly, too, the Baron's design
may be better than any of the others. Önly, for form's sake, one
would just like to know something about these others. After all, the
English sculptors were asked to compete, and though there may be no
intention of giving them a chance, pay them the compliment of letting
their designs be exhibited. That cannot hurt the favourite, and may
º several worthy poor fellows a lift. The race is a settled thing,
ut let the losers go over the ground.
A thought, occurs to us. When the WELLINGTON monument is
adjudged to the Baron, could not the other candidates be allowed (of
course at their own expense) to complete the NELson memorial by
contribution of ideas }. their rejected models? What may not be
º enough for WELLINGTON is good enough for NELsoN. It would
a sort of encouragement to the English sculptor just to let him lay
chisel to one of our inferior national testimonials, while the important
ones, as the Scutari memorial and the WELLINGTON monument, are
fittingly assigned for execution where the sympathies of nationality do
not interfere with the dictates of pure art.

SIR ROBERT PEEL ON MOSCOW.
SIR ROBERT, having nothing to do at present, took a large circle of
friends with him the other day to BURFoRD's |Panorama in Leicester
º and entertained them with a Lecture on the beauties of the
place :-
“My boys, here we are in Moscow. P} Jove, it is very like
You see before you the coronation, which, I need not tell you, far
surpassed the one in the Prophète. You will notice, three principal
characters in it—the Emperor, the Empress, and myself—but you will
observe that your humble servant does not º the prominent
osition which his merits deserve. The Bell to your left is the CzAR
oLokol, or, in other lingo, the Emperor of Bells. It went u
amidst hullaboolooing and rejoicing, and then came down with a de
of a crash, reminding one of the rise and f -
minister that I could name. The consequence was, that after its
fall it was found to be cracked—not the only instance of the downfal
of a great upstart having ended in insanity. The Grand Duke has
been compared to this Bell, not on account of his enormous mettle,
but simply because he, too, is cracked. However, we will not touch
on that head, but rather plunge into the Moscowa, which is the
Thames of Moscow—with this simple difference, that there are, no
whitebait in it. . It joins the Oka at a short distance, which by shallow
authorities has been cited as the reason of its yellow Oka appearance.
My boys, I am going to startle you now. At one time there were
1600 churches in Moscow ! ... What do you think of that? Even now
as we take a squint over the roofs of the houses, the eye is resented
with the sight of a very peculiar steeplechase, such as would beat the
Iliverpool one completely out of the field. Count the spires, if you can.
Not two steeples are alike. They are of all sizes and of all colours—as
if each one was wearing the colour of its patron saint. The domes
remind one of the coats of the jockeys at Epsom, for your optics are
regaled with the sight of every bright pigment under the sun. The
Cathedral of the Virgin—there to the right of you—has sixteen of these
pictorial towers, huddled all in a heap together, like the cups and saucers
in a conjuror's box. In a fruiterer's shop you will not see more varieties
of form and colour than these towers present. There are apples, {*.
melons, plums, with a large dash of the pine-apple. They look like
huge horticultural toys, that would not figure badly in a scene of the

strange freaks into their heads. Many of them are filº reminding
one of misers, whose caputs run upon nothing but gold. Others are
painted green and red. The effect is not happy. They bring before
one the picture of the Covent Garden market-carts, filled with greens
and carrots. The churches are crammed with more plate than HUNT
and RoskELL's 3 whilst, Storr and MoRTIMER's shop would be
nothing better than a pedlar's box compared to the innumerable sacks
of precious stones they contain. Talking of sacks, the French took
no small share of these same jewels just before they were burnt out of
Moscow. Living is mighty dear in this queer capital. A captain's
biscuit costs almost as much as a Colonelcy, would in England. The
Russians are extremely fond of charging the English tremendously,
excepting, of course, with the bayonet. Every look, every question,
every oath, every kick, is carefully computed, and put down in the
ill. Most of their ways are dirty and narrow—not unlike their
streets, whose only pavement is that of good intentions, for, owing to
the badness of the paving, it is something worse than purgatory to
walk over them. The city altogether presents a curious harlequinade
of all architectural styles and orders, and, for that reason, like a harle-
quinade, when once you have seen it you do not care about ºf it
ain. Moreover, I hold that this panorama is infinitely better than
the city itself. , You are free from the smells, the fleas, the priests, the

wants of the floating colony. There will be a Dining Captain, with
great, carving powers, and a miraculous flow of after-dinner oratory;
and there will be a Flirtation Captain, whose business it will be to
render the brief voyage, still briefer to the ladies. The former has
been a Freemason, who has eaten his way into all the honours of the
craft, and who will hold lodges in the maintop, where the proximity of
the fire from the chimney will be highly convenient for heating the
gridirons. The latter has been still more carefully selected, and is a

The spiritual welfare of the ten thousand inhabitants of the vessel
will be duly cared for. A very handsome church is being built on the
after-deck, and four chapels, for Methodists, Catholics, Baptists, and
Independents, are being erected forward. A pretty rectory house and

and Knight of the Garter, but
best known as the PRINCE
of WALEs, is about to make
a Continental tour. During
his absence abroad, he is to
be called BARON RENFREw
in order to avoid fuss and
ostentation. This is all sen-
sible enough. It is very dis;
agreeable for a distinguished
person to be bothered with
people running after him and
staring at him, and when Mr.
_ Punch sent his eldest son
= abroad for improvement, he
adopted a similar course. He
\ did not want the lad fol-
lowed by thousands, point-
ing at him, and bawling,
“That’s PRINCE PUNCH !
That’s the Heir of Fleet Street! That’s the son of the Emperor!”
and so on, and he told the boy simply to call himself ToBY FEATHER-
cAr. The QUEEN is quite right, as usual.
But why is the Prince to be called RENFREw? Why not call him-
self º or CHESTER, or CARRICK, or
are, as much his names as the Scotch one, and that each name is
uite as pretty as RENFREw, and much more easily, pronounced by
oreigners? Why is he to go about as a young Scotchman? Is it to
rectify the notions of the caricaturists on the Continent, as to the
Scotch, whom they depict with violent check trowsers, and plumes of
feathers bigger than those the tipsy mutes...stick on hearses? Or is
the title taken for the sake of extreme humility, and with the reason-
able idea that nothing can be of much less importance than a Scotch
baron. In either case we have nothing to say against the selection
but SIR ALBERT CoRNWALL, or LoRD EdwańD CHESTER, would
have been, we will be judged by the young ladies, a more elegant |k
travelling appellation. Perhaps, like the Prince in Lalla Rookh, the
lant K.G. is going to look round him for some Germanic pearl, one
ay to be set in an English coronet. Now LALLA never would call
her royal lover by any name but FERAMoRz, under which he had first
wooed her. , RENFREw would not be a pretty or an easy name for the
E.; rosebuds of the PRINCEss of WALEs to lisp out...Qne of the
rince's sisters should have thought of this for him. What is the
use of a lot of girls in a family if they can’t attend to these matters—
a fellah can’t t; of º If it is not too late, we recom:
mend the throwing over the Scotch name; and so we bid His Royal
Highness #. wishing him a most pleasant sojourn by the

ADMIRAL, NAPIER AT SEA AGAIN.
QUITTING the safe anchorage of silence, SIR CHARLEs NAPIER has
again been launching into public speech, and has as usual been found
quite at sea there. On moving for a change in the Admiralty manage-
ment, possibly with a view to the introduction of SIR CHARLEs NAPIER
in the place of SIR CHARLEs Wood, the gallant admiral is reported to
have croaked as follows:–
“At present we had no Channel fleet, and in case of a sudden war with France
and Russia he did not believe the QUEEN's throne would be worth six months' pur-
chase. (Oh 1 oh /)”
A truly British sentiment this for a true British sailor to give public
utterance to And the cause of this Napierian croak is, that at the
present moment—
“Our ships are not ready; and how then is the country to be defended?”
In answer to this most momentous question, we feel tempted to say,
clearly not by, ADMIRAL NAPIER. But to quiet his uneasiness, we
would ask, if there be really any reason to suppose that the ships of
France and Russia are a whit more ready now for action than our own?
And is there any ground for the nervous apprehension, lest war should
be declared without a note of preparation, or a warning letter from our
Foreign Correspondents , , , -
SIR CHARLEs next complains that when through their bad discipline
his men should have been beaten, they were so perverseas to gain for
him a victory, and so destroy his confidence in the rules of warfare,
besides perhaps upsetting his prophetic calculations:—
“When he fell in with the Miguelite fleet, which was double or treblo his force,
one of the enemy's ships was first boarded by his captain and his son, now no more,
and they were hardly followed by a single man of the crew. Yet these were British
Sailors ſ And out of the 50 marines only three boarded. Why was this? Because
the men were undisciplined and had no confidence in themselves. True, the
Miguelite fleet was taken. . (A Laugh.) Yes, but by all the rules of warfare it was
the British fleet which ought to have been taken. (Laughter.)"
This statement appears to have occasioned some hilarity, but it is
clear SIR CHARLEs felt more of disappointment than delight in making
it. It is a matter of regret with him rather than rejoicing that his
men were so ill-disciplined as to disobey, the rules of warfare, and so
obstinate withal as not to take a thrashing when they thought that
they could give one. SIR CHARLEs appears to us a kind of Naval Matº-
worm, and rather likes the despicable plight of being beaten, as it
affords him opportunity to lay the blame on somebody, and represent
himself as being an injured individual. Ill sea-bird that he is, we find
him continually fouling his own nest, and constantly disparaging every
one about him in order that by contrast he may exalt himself.
A WORD FOR A KING,
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I was so angry with you for that picture of the dear KING
of PRussia you can’t think. Pray, never make fun of him any more.
am sure you will not when you know what I am going to tell you,
and what you might, you satiric creature, have read for yourself if you
had had any eyes. It is actually the fact (and the gentleman who
writes to the Times newspaper from Berlin, will assure you of it) that
when a young officer in }. falls in love with a young º and
she has no money, and he has not enough to make up the sum which a
married officer is required by law to have, he petitions, the dear King,
and the King makes up the amount for him. He hardly ever refuses.
O, my dear Punch, if FIELD MARSHAL PRINCE ALBERT would do this
sort of thing, how we girls would adore him There is no law about
income here, but you can't marry on a lieutenant's pay, you know, and
eep up appearances; but only fancy writing to the PRINCE, and saying
that one wants a cottage, and a pony carriage, and all that; and dear
Colonel. PhIPPs sending the money in nice crisp notes, and with the
PRINCE's best wishes for our happiness. The KING, QF, PRussia, does
this, and I do sincerely hope you will never be so unkind as to ridicule
him again. I have been à. ALFRED that he ought to exchange
into the Prussian service, but you don't know who ALFRED is, and, I
have not time to tell you. But mind what I say, there is a dear old
thing.

[June 13, 1857.
PETER THE CRUEL.
In a case heard at Guildhall the other day, a husband, named AILEN,
was charged with having punched his wife's head, because she did not
comply with his .# |. a shilling. Her reason was a miserable
one. She had not a shilling. Beaten, she applies for redress. Solo-
Mon SADDLER is on the Bench, and brayeth as follows:–
“SIR PETER LAURIE said: The new Act of Parliament for the protection of women
has been carried out too far, and the hard-working and industrious man has fre-
quently been punished with great severity, for a blow given to his wife in a moment
of anger or provocation.”
Evidently, PETER’s mind is in his old shop. His exceedingly apropos
remark (for “this is quite a different case, SIR PETER,” said ihe other
Alderman) was prompted by a recollection of bye-gone times. In
dealing with a wife (dicit PETER), “there 's nothing like Leathering.”
THE SOCIAL TREAD-MILL. No. 7.
“Ionce knew a young husband and wife, both well born, who loying
one another, had been courageous enough to marry without waiting
for fortune. An old servant of the wife's family followed her young
mistress into the stuffy Pimlico first floor, to which she passed from
the old Hampshire country house without a sigh or a misgiving, and
in which she spent many a ºf lonely day, while ‘WILLIE was in
Chambers, awaiting the briefs that were so long in coming. But they
did come at last; and my charming and courageous couple were
rewarded for the faith which had carried them into matrimony on
three hundred a year.
“In those days of struggle and saving, the old servant was the only
one of the three who seemed to suffer under a sense of contrast
between the fine old Hampshire mansion, its lordly ways and rustic
state, and the fusty, choky London lodging, with its close-pinching
economy and town-squalor. It so happened, that her master, among
some relics of a home, broken up and scattered to the four winds by
a father's death, possessed a massive fish-slice, suggestive of the family
plate-chest in which it had erst reposed, and the solemn butler, who had
once watched over its safe-keeping.
“My young friends' old servant rejoiced º in this fish-
slice. It was to her a symbol of the lofty fortunes from which her
master and mistress, had, wilfully, as it were, descended. When
affronted º the landlady of the lodgings, or harassed by some imper-
tinence of the wretched servant-of-all-work—who, trodden on by all
was not particular on whom she turned—the attached dependent would
take out this fish-slice, and apparently derive comfort from cleaning it.
# was a º: of life-buoy, which kept her sense of the family dignity
above water,
“Breakfasting with my friends one morning, I was astonished to
see the fish-slice on the table. It was very much in the way of the
ºups and saucers, and my friend got impatient, and at last rapped out,
‘Confound that — fish-slice! I wonder, my darling, why GRIM-
sHAwe will insist on parading it at breakfast?’ -
“The little wife laughed, and removed the ponderous piece of plate
and then ficant how Gºsnºw, ºid not tº broken ºf this habit of
solemnly placing her cherished fish-slice on the table at every meal.
“Poor GRIMSHAwe: The fish-slice was to her as a blue-riband—an
order—a title—something to extort respect from all civilised people
without reference to fortune. Her master and mistress were quite
willing to stand upon their º claims and chances, but GRIM-
sHAwe would thrust the fish-slice down your throat on all occasions.
“When I see people giving way to some cowardly piece of display-
parading some incongruous patch of splendour on their threadbare
every-day habits, I always think of GRIMsHAwe and the fish-slice. .
“The Kotoos were eminently of the fish-slice order of people. Their
table looked gorgeous under the épergnes with their glowingsheaves
of flowers, and the silver wine-coolers with the long-necked green:
yellow, bottles peeping out of them, and the gay dessert intermixed
with the .. ets, only we were all aware that the épergnes, and
the wine-coolers, and, for all we know, the very forks and spoons, with
all their heraldry, were hired from the pawnbroker's, or the man who
lets out rout-seats, or came in GALANTINE’s spring-van with the green
boxes. In fact, the Kotoos fish slice was #rum m electrotype,
and not solid silver, and everybody saw through the plating.
“Kotoo had what he called the menew by his side–GALANTINE’s bill
of fare-from which he called over the dishes. The document was not
a model of orthography in itself, and was not made more intelligible
by Kotoos' pronunciation of its ill-spelt French.
“‘Here’s Potage à la Ramifolle, MRs. FLAUNTER, and tºother's a
Perrey de Cressy. Try some of these Roojays a la Cardinal. PENNY-
Boy,” and then to me, “There’s Cabilow, if you prefer it... I saw he
hadn’t the remotest notion what, “Cahilland’ meant. Thank you,”
said I, maliciously, “I’ll take cod.’ 'Cod exclaimed Kotº, much
disgusted that such a plebeian fish should be asked for at his table.
Cod! I’m afraid it’s not in the menew.” The attentive WALKER,
however, had already supplied my wants, and Kotoo blushed when he
saw it was cod after all, and very woolly cod, too, which GALANTINE
had put off upon him under the imposing foreign title of ‘cadillaud.’
MRs. Kotoo is more mistress of the tongues than her husband, and I
saw her give Kotoo such a look!
“It was evident that in spite of all MRs. K.’s efforts to sit as if it
was quite natural to her to have dinner ministered to her by the
haughty hands of WALKER and his satellites, she was in her secret soul
full of anxieties. I could not at first understand this, for I thought
the plan of leaving everything to GALANTINE, had this advantage at
least, of securing tranquillity to the master and mistress of the house.
But I soon found that it was the waiters our hostess was nervous
about. In fact WALKER had had occasion to complain to her of some
of his staff before dinner, and as I sat with my back to the sideboard
at one corner of the table, I was the involuntary confidant of many of
WALKER's difficulties. He was a generalworthy of a better army than
the awkward squad with which GALANTINE had provided him on this
occasion. I had once or twice observed our amiable hostess wince as
one of the waiters passed her. At last I saw her exchange a rapid
whisper with WAIRER. That worthy reddened, but recovered himself,
and at once, as if he had merely received an order in regular course,
made a circuit of the table in his usual magnificent, manner, with the
º which—I may say, en passant—did not flow #. as freely
from his hands as it might have done if we had º ourselves, or
each other. I should say that we were now at what Kotoo persisted
in calling the ‘relieves, till MRs. Kotoo corrected him—by using the
word with an exaggerated stress on the last syllable, thus, relegays'—
at which sound PENNYBoy, who had disappeared from me behind one
of the flower-baskets, suddenly emerged with an awakened face, and
the exclamation ‘Railways?, Won't I take any. Railways, Ma'am?
Not if I know it—” and then he launched into adiatribe on the state
of the Railway Market, of which nobody but MRs. Kotoo, and I
understood the relevancy. While PENNYBoy was on this theme—
which really revived the flagging º for a while, every one having
his or her own remarkable experience of railway speculation to record
—I became conscious of a serious drama in action at the side-table,
within ear-shot of my chair.
“This was what passed in a low whisper:-
“Walker (to one of the waiters, in a tone of disgust). So, you’ve been
at them inions, agin!
“Waiter (rapidly, but evidently conscience-stricken). No-Laven’t,

whiff—not of Araby the blest—which had been wafted round the
table as this waiter went upon his business were now explained. .
“It was too true. The peccant attendant had been at ‘them inions,”
and the accompaniment º that peculiar vegetable fragrance did not
y any means enhance the relish of M. GALANTINE’s, Poularde en
Iliadème. . Even had the bachamel sauce been less floury, the vegetables
that garnished the dish less cold and watery, and the central fowl
more succulent and not so stringy, I don't think I could have enjoyed
the plaf, with that waiter handing my plate. But, indeed the dinner
was as bad as it was pretentious. The four entrées had all a vague
resemblance, which left it quite a toss up whether you were at any
particular moment engaged on the Wol-au-cent de Foie gras a la Proven-
gale, or on the Noir de Weau, demigras a la purée de concombres, or the
Epigramme.d. Agneau, or the Aiguilettes depetits Poussins à la Ban-
º I have corrected GALANTINE’s idiomatic but inaccurate
| French.
“All one could swear to was that everything was very greasy and
very cold, with a very strong family likeness in the way of burnt
onions and questionable butter.
“Poor Kotoo, however, revelled in the splendid variety of viands,
and went floundering through the hard names of the “ménew’ in the
most reckless manner, in spite of all the winks and warning frowns of
his wife. Luckily FLAUNTER, who was the only person at table able to
detect Kotoo's blunders, was too much absorbed in the thought of his
i own embarrassments to pay much attention to our host’s indecent
liberties with the French * ge. PENNYBoy's French was if any-
thing, rather worse than Koroo's, and as he shared with that gentle-
man the ambition of discussing the cookery, it may be conceived what
work they made of the noble gastronomic tongue between them. . . .
“But it was a weary business, for WALKER, with all his generalship,
could not keep his awkward squad up to their work, and there were
the dreariest gaps every now and then in the feeble and flagging con-
versation; and long intervals in the rotation of the food, colder than the
cold dishes; and flaccid jokes from the Author, more mawkish than the
Pain de Péches au Noyau of the entremets; and anecdotes and smart
things from the Reviewer, meant to be satirical, but falling flatter than
the mock-Sillery on an audience not prepared to receive them. His
sallies were many of them clever enough and ill-natured enough to
have bothÉ". off and hurt people had it been the time and place for
such prandial pyrotechnics; but firing them off here was like thrusting
lighted squibs, into a heap of damp sand. And so with long-drawn
circuits . half-cold, ill-cooked dishes, with rounds of indifferent wine,
and a dro º fire of semi-stagnant conversation, the grand dinner
drew its slow length along.
“How hard we all worked, too, to keep the ponderous machine going!
How Kotoo floundered and fagged through the mysteries of i.
‘menew,’ and how MRs. Kotoo perspired iº in mingled awe of
WALKER, and disgust at his attendant waiters, and laboured to seem
at home, and used to the style of thing—an old offender, in short, up
to the * of the mill, and able to get through the appointed task in
good wind, and without breaking her shins. And how, loyally we all
i. and tramped and lifted the weight of our aching feet, and
onged for the time that should allow us to get off the instrument of
torture. I protest, neither Pentonville nor Brixton has any punish-
ment more painful. Like the Pentonville prisoners, too, we went
about our work in masks.
“And yet there are many on the mill for life, and who have got so
used to the labour that they consider it as the normal state of existence
-beings like Little Dorrit, born in the social Marshalsea.”
THE CUP THAT INEBRLATES AND NOT CHEERS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“THE QUEEN’s Bench reverses a decision of the Stafford
Bench, which fined a person for selling British wines without a licence.

Lond CAMPBELL certainly plays Old Gooseberry with the Current of

as a means of cheating children into the idea that they are drinking
the beverage of adults, or simply as a means of making adults wish,
with wry faces, that they were º any other beverage, British
wines should be regarded by the law with the same disfavour that is
bestowed on them by civilised beings. They should be sold, if at all,

The Vienna Correspondent of the Times says, that the convention
recently concluded between Russia and Persia was the work of GENE-

success of Tschi Rkoff in this negotiation with Persia may somewhat
console the Russian Court for the failure which, on the Treaty of
Peace with the Allies, it experienced on attempting the shirk-off style
of diplomacy.
REFLECTION FOR THE LOOKING-GLASS.
IN reading Le Follet young ladies would do well to have at hand an
English, as well as a French dictionary; as will be evident from the
ºration of the following passage on bonnets, from Fashions for
tºwe --
“For negligé, fancy straw, trimmed with taffetas and straw. Coloured straws,
drab, or brown, and a mixture of crinoline and black chenille will be much in
vogue, as they are light, fresh, and coquettish."
The word “coquettish” is one which we should think any youn
lady would like to know the meaning of before adopting a style o
bonnet to which that adjective is applicable. The word “coquette,”
whence it is derived, is defined in DR. Johnson’s Dictionary to be—
what a fair reader might consider whether she would like togetherself
taken for by wearing a coquettish bonnet, or a bonnet suitable to the
character of a coquette—“a gay, º girl; who endeavours to attract
notice.” Before she chooses one of the bonnets described as coquettish
she had better ask herself if she really deserves to be thought airy and
§: and if to attract notice is the object after which she intends to
eludeavour.

SCOTCH “CHAINS AND SLAVERIE.”
THE SCOTCH movement for the erection of a memorial, to WALLACE
continues, and is worthy of approbation. It is a little late in the
day, perhaps, but we are not sure, however, that the monument
proposed, amid great applause, at a recent Scotch meeting, is quite
enerous. A speaker suggested that the memorial should represent
HERCULEs trampling on the tyranny, of England, but bitten in
the heel by the Scotch aristocracy.” is device was intended, and
understood, by the meeting, to tell two ways, , and not only to
symbolise the deeds of WALLACE himself, but also to satirise the
enemies of the Rights of Scotland party in the present day. The
cruel tyranny now exercised by England over Scotland is, assuredly,
one of the greatest blots upon our history. England tears the Scotch-
man, shrieking, from his native earth, and i. him southward
strives (though rarely with success) to force him to speak English, an
º: the innocent and disinterested creature to accept responsible
and lucrative situations, the temptations of which finally debauch his
mind from his original Arcadia, and prevent his caring to revisit the
allowed regions of Thistledom. We are far from seeking to palliate our
guilt, and when Pharisaical persons reprobate the African slave-trade,
and thank Providence that our hands are washed of it, we think of our
Scotch slave-trade, and blush. But is it magnanimous, in the great
nation north of Tweed, to erect a permanent record of such a system,
especially at a time when England is desirous to abrogate it, and,
conscious of the mental and literary beggary to which, as evidenced by
Scottish, speeches and writings, this southward drain, has reduced
Scotland, is almost uncourteously anxious that she should keep a few
of her more intelligent children to herself, instead of leaving her
feelings to be represented by such donkeys as the Rights of Scotland
party? We trust that the statue question will be reconsidered, and
werather hope so, as there appears to be no great alacrity in subscribing
the needful bawbees.
THE WEED IN THE WORKHOUSE.
A MoMENTous question to a few poor old creatures was recently
discussed by the Oxford Board of Guardians. . It arose in a debate on
the workhouse estimates, the disputed, point being, whether the sum
of £40 a-year should continue to be allowed for expenditure in snuff
and tobacco for the comfort of aged paupers. The item was objected
to by a REv. J. B. PRICE; but, for the honour of the cloth, be it
recorded that other clergymen were present, by whose better nature
that curmudgeonly objection was overruled. Among them we have
the pleasure of mentioning the RECTOR of ExETER and the PRovost
OF § Political economists need not be shocked in ruminating
on this intelligence over their claret. The nicotian luxuries are not
allowed to any of the ..". under 60 years of age; those indulgences
are granted only to poor feeble old creatures whom a pipe and a pinch
of snuff will just enable, with some little comfort, to puff and sneeze
their lives out.

A deposit of silver is wanted (gold will do) and certain faces, now in

before equalled by photography. A respectable ancient writes, that

your means, in memory of the benefactor Yº: you the deity for

DIED JUNE STH, 1857.
Low lies the lion-like grey head;
The broad and bright blue eye is glazed:
Quenched is that flashing wit, which blazed,
The words that woke it scarcely said.
Those who but read the writer's word,
Might deem him bitter: we that knew
The man, all saw the sword he drew
In tongue-fence, was both shield and sword.
That sword, in the world's battle-throng,
Was never drawn upon the meek:
Its skill to guard was for the weak,
Its strength to smite was for the strong.
His sympathy was ever given
Where need for it was sorest felt:
In pity that blue eye would melt,
Which against wrong, blazed like the levin.
Not for his wit, though it was rare;
Not for his pen, though it was keen;
We sorrow for his loss, and lean
Lovingly over that grey hair,
To place the wreath, befitting those
Who like good men and true have striven;
By God, not man, he must be shriven;
Men guess and grope: God sees and knows.
SIDNEY AT WORCESTER.
TEA duce, tutus, was an old saying, but it seems falsified in the case
of that respected Tea-dealer, ALDERMAN SIDNEY, who has come
anything but safe out of a matter wherein his tea has been stirred,
rather rudely, by Lord CAMPBELL. SIDNEY meant to have come in
for. Worcester at the last election, but could get only 615 votes,
which according to him and his friends would have been dozens or
scores more, but for a placard in which he was (untruly, as he swears)
charged with an oppressive action. An information was granted by
the Queen's Bench against the printer of the placard (who had given
up the author, and said what the Judge considered to mean regret and
desire to make reparation), and ". the case was heard, LORD
CAMPBELI, discharged the rule, remarking that the Alderman had not
Cºnducted himself with propriety. In order to prove publication, the
Alderman's brother-in-law, one Ash, went, it is sworn, to the printer's,
in his absence, and sought by stratagem to get a copy of the placard.
The prentice had none, whereon Asif induced him to print some copies,
lending him a knife to cut the paper. Having got them, of course
down came the Alderman on the printer. The Alderman said that he
did not instruct Ash to perform this trick, but he certainly took
advantage of it. LoRD CAMPBELL said that his affidavits were “dis-
ingenuously, framed,” and JUSTICE Cor ERIDGE, that there was strong
fº. for believing that the Alderman knew the way in which Ash

ROMANCE OF THE HIGHLANDS.
OUR old acquaintance, the Dumfries Courier, relates the following
wonderful story:—
“CUNNING of The Fox. —A gentleman in the Highlands sends us the following
note:–A gamekeeper on the estate near Lochawe, who had been annoyed by the
depredation of foxes, discovered a kennel in a glen at the side of a small loch.
While watching one evening for the appearance of the tenants, he observed a brace
of wild ducks floating on the loch. In a littie a fox was seen approaching the water
side with cautious steps. On reaching it, he picked up a bunch of heather and
placed it in his mouth, so as to cover his head; then slipping into the water, and
|...}} all but his nose, he floated slowly and quietly down to where the birds
were quacking out delight in fancied security, seeing nothing near them but, a
bunch of weed. In due time, he neared the ducks, dropped the heather and substi-
tuted a bird, with which he returned to the loch side, and was making off to his
young with the prize, when—”
“Come, I say, now, nonsense !” will be the mental exclamation of
nine hundred thousand mine hundred and ninety-nine of our million
readers, on reaching this point of our Scotch contemporary's transparent
romance. The conclusion, however, of that tale is still more incredible
than the part preceding ; too incredible even for fiction. The fox, as
above related, was making off to his young with the duck, when–
“The keeper, who had noted all his movements, closed them by the discharge of
his double barrel.”
The idea of shooting a fox As if any Briton, north or south, could
be capable of such an act The statement that a fox was the victim
of such a monstrous atrocity, is a fitting clincher to the legend of his
miraculous cunning. Country gentlemen need not waste their ini
nation on the anonymous Highland keeper... Reynard was shot wit
no double-barrel: by no more deadly projectile than the shaft of an
editorial long bow.
Pretty American Compliment.
“You R English ladies are very handsome,” said a polite young
American gentleman to Mr. Punch. .
“Your American girls are exquisitely lovely,” returned Mr. Punch,
scorning to be outdone in courtesy.
“Aye, girls, that is true, but they fall off as they count years. SO
you see your women carry of the palm, and what's more, it’s a palm
that will bear a date.” - 2. 1: 22
“Bless 'em all,” said Mr. Punch, piously. “Let’s liquor.

But what they aim at no one dreameth."
EFFECTS OF THE COMET'S SHOCK.
THE. Great Comet struck the earth (which, with the moon, is
as well as can be expected) precisely at half past two o'clock on
Sunday last. The shock and terror produced a most beneficial effect
upon great numbers of persons, and among the instances in which the
Visitation caused the most satisfactory results, Mr. Punch has heard of
the following:—
MR. SPOONER, seeing an Irish Popish beggar woman before his
window, ran out, and gave her sixpence. MR. NEwdEGATE, who had
been lunching with him, called out, “Give her another for me, and I’ll
toss you for the shilling.” Then, remembering it was Sunday, he re-
tracted the offer, and pitched the poor woman half-a-crown.
The Editor of the Morning Advertiser, who had just penned an
account of the conversation at the last Cabinet Council, recollected
that he had, as a Member of the Council, been sworn to secrecy, and
made the article into spills.
MR. CHARLEs KEAN sent for a great number of the members of his
Company, forgave them for having compelled him to discontinue
speaking to them, and permitted them to kiss his hand, and hear him
read a complimentary letter from Colonel Phipps.
LORP John, RussBLL wrote to LoRD PALMERSTON, confessing that
he had intended to accept, office for the purpose of upsetting the
Government, but that he had repented, and, to avoid temptation, would

SoMERs would have approved his conduct or not. -
The Bishop of Oxford, countermanding his carriage and a hot

generally, an everything else that set sensible men squabbling.
An IDIOT, who was going to forward some conscience-money to the
CHANCELLOR of THE ‘. UER for arrears of hair-powder duty
forgotten in 1827, had his mind sufficiently enlightened to perceive his
folly, and he enclosed the cheque to the Westminster. Hospital.
SIR EDwARD BUIwer Lytton, who had been meditating vengeance
on the Times for hinting that his morality (as a writer) was question-

English Maidens. Attenuated pieces, of insipidity, aver-

English Art.—The execution so terrible that, as at a

ought to have his eyes bandaged first.
British Navy.—Very pretty ornaments for the outside

Sir Charles Napier.—I do not know whether, like PETER
THE GREAT, he ever worked at Woolwich Dockyard, but
certainly no one has ever done the Russian navy so much

Public Opinion.—The despotism of the many.
Sir Robert Peel.—His hot blood wants cooling a little in
a refrigerator like Siberia.
Reform.—The Toy that a statesman throws to the British

É.i. and it is not of the slightest consequence how
often it gets broken. The liberation of the Serfs in Russia
—the Constitution in Spain—the Charter in Prussia—are
all toys constructed upon the same hollow principle.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
June 8th, Monday. A petition was presented to the Lords, and it
is difficult to say whether there was more iº: in concocting or
in patronizing such a document. LoRD MALMESBURY produced a
demand from some Proctors for compensation . The House received
it with a contempt too deep for the slightest outward demonstration.
LORD GREY then stated, at great length, the hard case of, a MR.
SHEDDON, a sufferer by the misconduct of trustees, as well as by
inability to prove a marriage of which there was no morai doubt.
The Law Lords advised, however, that his wrongs should not be
redressed, and his appeal was rejected.
In the Commons, A. DANIEL O'ConnELL demanded what was
going to be done for the unfortunate victims of the Superannuation
swindle, and the . CHANGELLOR, or THE ExchEQUER satisfactorily
replied that actuaries had been told to look into the matter, and that
these actuaries wanted masses of documents, and had made no report,
and so the Government had given no particular attention to the
subject. Mr. Punch hopes that MR. O'Connell will agitate, more
majoris, until the Civil Servants are emancipated.
he Jew Bill was read a second time without opposition, but SIR
FREDERICK THESIGER will Christianise it, if he can, in Committee.
It would be an advantage if he could perform the same operation upon
some of its opponents and promoters.
The Civil Servants were then taken up again, LoRD, GoDERICH
strenuously advocating the principle of competition. The CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER objected to º; it to subordinates, whom he
would prefer only to examine. He would not place all the porters at
Somerset House in a row, and ask them questions as to who built
Somerset House, and what became of him, and what a somerset is,
and whether it has anything to do with summer, or other queries like
those so, usefully addressed to the humbler servants of the State,
letting them take one another down as in classes; but he had no
objection to examine each porter separately, and put him through his
multiplication table and his table of cab-distances.
SIR. W. F. WILLIAMs of KARs, defended Aldershott, the expendi-
ture for which, he said, no one would º: the camp were
properly carried out. There is a good deal of virtue, or rather of its
reverse, in that “if”. Kars would not have been defended so well had
its fortress been a château where “if” was allowed—a Château d'If.
The author of Eothen does not altogether approve of the ATToRNEY-
GENERAL's Bill about Fraudulent Trustees, nor does...LORD ST.
LEONARDs, who has got one of his own. They fear that if you make
a trustee too liable, you will be able to get no trustees at all, and
truly the condition of such an official, surrounded by a family of
which MR. Pecks.NIFF, MR. SpottleTop, and MEssRs. CHUzziewit,
pèreet fils, are types, to say nothing of more keen-eyed and vindictive
feminine legatees, all disappointed, and all hating testator, trustee,
and one another, need not be aggravated by empowering any of them
to prosecute him criminally. On the other hand, a great many
trustees, especially attorney, trustees, are mºst thundering rogues,
whom one would like to be able also to describe, irrespective of their
size, as Hulking rogues. - -
The first Savings Bank Bill of this Session having been amended
into a muddle, a second was substituted, which has, been read a
second time. SIR BENJAMIN HALL has introduced a bill enabling his
department to “acquire a site” for the new Public Offices. Mr. Punch
having acquired a sight of the designs, in Westminster Hall, hopes
that the Judges, now in conclave, will bear a particularly wary eye
upon them, as he knows everything about all the architects, and their
respective influences and intimacies; and if he finds that Court-favour,
or any other consideration but merit, has induced the selection, not
one of those Judges will ever again be able to reside where. Punch
is read, that is to say, anywhere in the world, except, perhaps, in some
hitherto undiscoveredisſand in the Caribbean Sea.
Tuesday. LoRD ELLENRoRough delivered an alarmist speech about
the mutinies in our Indian Army. Among other terrors, he was
hideously afraid that LoRD CANNING, the Governor-General, had been
taking some step which showed that he thought Christianity, a true
religion, but this damaging accusation was happily explained away.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[June 20, 1857.
–––
LoRD LANspowNE was almost sure LORD CANNING could not so far
have misconducted himself. - -
After the second reading of the PRINCEss's Dowry Bill (to which
little pecuniary matter Mr. Punch alludes only in ºrder to have an
opportunity of congratulating his young friend W. A. M. L. on the
arrival of F. W. †. ran across to see W., and also to see the Ascot
Cup won by iłgoriter Zeri.AND, G.M.), the Lords went at the
Divorce Bill again in Committee. The Čhancellor inserted clauses
iving a deserted husband the same right to ask, for divorce as a
eserted wife; for making both ÆGISTHUs. and CLYIEMNESTRA
defendants in the suit by AGAMEMNoN, and for giving the Court power
to fine the first, up to £10,000, to which, the Bishop of QXFORD
carried an amendment (by 43 to 33) for making the penalty fine and
imprisonment, or fine or imprisonment. LoRD WENSLEYDAIE, who,
by the way, seems no such valuable addition to the strength of the
aristocratic company, for he is always taking a mere lawyer's view of
cases, tried to prevent the wrong-doers from making such reparation to
one another and to society as marriage may be considered to offer, but
he was defeated by 37 to 28, ARchbishop SUMNER's clause against
the sinner's marrying at all having also been got rid of. The Lords
have nearly done with the Bill, but not quite. -
In the Commons, SIR. F. THESIGER's dislike to the Jews led him
to introduce a Bill for abolishing the Grand Jewry. This is an excel-
lent measure, whatever may have prompted it, the jury in question
being known as “the hope of the London thief.” It is to be retained,
however, as the hope of the London traitor, and so, if the ambitious
Wiscount of Lambeth, not satisfied with his hypothetical coronet, should
aim at snatching the Crown from the head of his SovKREIGN, and
sticking it on his own skull, (mind, we do not know that he has any
such intentions, but sudden honours drive small intellects to queer
courses,) he will have to go before a Grand Jury, on his way to the block.
Let him be warned by the fate of NorthumºeriAND, Essex, LADy
JANE GREY, and (as he would say) other unfortunate noblemen.
Another Tory lawyer, SIR F. KELLY, º in a Bill for reform-
ing the law regarding Wills, made abroad by British subjects, which
he proposes shall, wherever made, be admitted to probate here. This,
again, is highly expedient, but SIR RICHARD BETHELL, did not much
favour the proposal, and objected to knock over the rule that mobilia
sequuntur personam. He laid as much stress on this as if he had
never moved, Mr. Punch's experience is the other way, and so far
from moveables always following the person, the last time he moved
he lost a hat-brush, the Peerage, a tortoise-shell comb and cat, a toast-
rack, his slippers, his big sponge, a Little Marbler, the key of his meat
safe, a white waistcoat, eleven volumes of the copy of ALISON's History
of Europe which he always keeps under his pillow, and a beautiful bit
of transparent shaving soap; and besides this, if he hadn't sequuntur'd
a personam who was cutting away with his fishing-rod, umbrella, an
camp-stool, and treated that personam to an indignant wunner that
made him surrender his ill-gotten booty and bawl for mercy, Mr. P.
could not have made a holiday which he has now in contemplation. SIR
RICHARD speaks unadvisedly therefore, as a person had better follow
his moveables, if he wishes to keep them. A Lumatic Board for
Scotland and Reformatory Schools for England came under consider-
ation, with another useful measure or two, and the night was by no
means wasted.
Wednesday. Nor was the following day, when MR. KER SEYMER,
taking a honest pint pot in his hand, did knock down MR HARDY in a
very superior manner. To º metaphor, elegant though it be,
HARDY's Beer Bill, professedly intended to make the humbler
classes sober by force of police, and º calculated to increase the
power and wealth of the f Brewers, who do as they please with a
good many of the pompous but subservient licencing magistrates, and
a Bill, therefore, in neither, view º: was kicked out by a
majority of XXXIfil whose health, and that of those who voted with
them, Mr. Punch proceeds to drink in XXX.
Three little reforms, prettily described by ToM DUNCOMBE as a
bouquet tendered to Wiscoust Pºisºnstos (doubtless the gallant
Thomas has tendered prettier bouquets in his time) were rejected, all
because of the grand reform which is coming next year.
Thursday. In the Lords the only remarkable thing said was by LoRD
LIFFORD, who, to the wrath of the CHANCELLOR, alluded to the
"robberies and delays” of the Court of Chancery. CRANNY made the
answer which lawyers have repeated until they almost believe it them-
selves, that it is always the fault of the parties, not of the Court.
The Duchy of Lancaster was invaded by MR. WISE, who was
repulsed by the gallant BAINEs, who slaughtered WISE's main argument,
and took the reason of the hearers prisoner. MR. KINNAIRD then
invaded India, but scarcely anybody stayed to see the fight, which was
upon the question whether justice was done to the inhabitants of the
lower provinces of Bengal. Mr. Punch is no alarmist, but is bound to
say that some of the Bengal lights thrown on the subject burn bluer
than he could wish. The India House, seems very wrath with the
Missionaries for trying to benefit the bodies as well as the souls of the
natives. ...By 119 (who came in to vote), to 18 the House decided that
the question should not be decided at all.
Friday. The most interesting topic taken in hand, or mouth, was a
complaint by a Lord, and , by a Common, upon the subject which
Mr. Punch has illustrated in his Grand Cartoon, and in reference to
which (by a curious coincidence) his friend MADAME DE Tour NURE
has requested him to insert her circular. The Government promised
to do something, some of these days, for the Ladies.
TRAINING FOR COURT.
(Circular).
MADAME DE Tour NURE, directress of the celebrated and fashion-
able Belgravian establishment for finishing young ies of the
superior classes, would, on an ordinary occasion, shudder at the vulgarity
of advertising an institution to which introductions of the very highest
order are the only means of procuring entrance; but the season is
rapidly passing, time presses, and the crisis demands the sacrifice of
ordinary rule and natural repugnance.
The only mode in which, Ladies can now obtain admission to the
º: of their respected Sover EIGN, º reception days, is by a
isplay of gymnastic power which is scarcely developed by the course
of calisthenic exercise to which the interesting pupils of MADAME DE
ToURNURE are habitually submitted. In addition, the extraordinary
arrangements of that revered nobleman, the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN,
who has been singularly successful in assimilating the proceedings at
a Drawing Room to those at a steeple-chace, have necessitated the
acquisition by a lady of accomplishments beyond those of the curtsey,
the carriage step, and the other branches of fashionable education.
Deeply regretting the necessity of adopting this plebeian method of
addressing those who honour MADAME DE Tour NURE with their
confidence, that ladybegs to announce that she has opened an Academy
(in connection with her establishment in Belgravia) for the purpose of
prºparing Ladies to pay their homage to their QUEEN.
raining being the first requisite for gymnastic success
DE Tour Suite has secured the services of those eminent Professors
SIGNoR CoNKI and HERR NAPP PEPPER, who preside over the
seclusion to which the more distinguished members of the Prize Ring
are consigned, preparatory to their engaging in pugilistic encounter.
The time for training, this year, is necessarily brief; but the professors
assure MADAME DE Tour NURE that raw mutton chops, light claret,
exercise, and early hours, will put a spirited young lady into such
condition that even in a fortnight wagers would be laid upon her
demolishing any }}. menial who should endeavour to hinder
her advance into the Palace. *-
. MADAME DE Tour NURE has caused her Academy to be fitted up in
imitation of the arrangements at the Palace, and her Pupils will be
taught the best means of encountering the crush, the fight, the weari-
ness, and the scramble, and then of emerging, all grace and composure,
into the Throne Room.
An eminent steeple-chaser, under the direction of the accomplished
author of Soapey Sponge, has constructed some low walls and hedges,
over which a lady pupil, practising for the Drawing Room, will leap.
To avoid chance of accident, the floor is laid with the softest
mattrasses, but attendants will also stand, in uniform, to catch any
lady who fails to clear the ºbstacle. A system of elbow exercise, by
means of which a moderately plump, or even a lessfully developed arm,
will speedily open the owner's way through a crowd, has been invented,
and will form part of the instruction.
In order to familiarise a débutante with the language and manners
which will assail her in the enraged crowd surrounding her on her way
to the SovePEIGN, MADAME DE Tour NURE has engaged some actors
and actresses from the principal Metropolitan theatres, who will be
costumed as generals, bishops, noblemen, dowagers, and others, and
will give a faithful representation of the struggle, the pupil making
her way among them. Although it would be improper to permit in
the Academy such language as is used in the throng at the Palace, the
artists in question wiiſ rowl, storm, and employ words sounding so
like naughty ones, as to have the desirable effect upon the ear.
By next year, MADAME DE TOURNURE has no doubt of forming her
pupils into a band of Amazons, for whom the Palace will have no
terrors, but even this season, she trusts to be enabled materially to
assist ladies into the presence of HER MAJESTY.
To avoid the destructive and expensive results of a Drawing Room
upon the toilette, MADAME DE Tour NURE has purchased from a
theatrical manager (who had procured them for a play of the date of
CHARLEs THE SEconD), a quantity of costumes of #. time of GEORGE
THE FIRST. They may be crushed, torn, and otherwise damaged in
the lesson, and will be repaired by the under-teachers every evening.
Imitation jewellery, to be dragged off, and searched for, will also be
supplied, and cheap fans will befurnished.
Qſtrms:
One Lesson, from Carriage to QUEEN - - . Five Guineas.
Six ditto, Complete Instruction - - - . Twenty Guineas.
Course of Training, gymnastics, the leap, and all extras Fifty Guineas.
MADAME
Every Lady must bring her own sal volatile and sticking-plaister, and the legibly written
address of her Medical Attendant.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. * - 251
HOMAGE TO KING HAN DEL.
IIEN these words
are made public
there will be but
one chance left to
rofit by them;
unch will not
therefore be de-
terred from ex-
horting that small
remnant of his
London readers
who have not
thought it worth
their while to at-
tend the Syden-
ham Festival, at
once to take a
second thought
about the matter
and a stall ticket.
They will not º get their fullest guinea's worth of present delectation, but
will acquire a small fortune of pleasant recollections. “A thing of beauty is a joy
for ever:” and there are so many beautiful things in Israel in Eypt, that no chance
should be lost of making their addition to one's store of joyous memories.
But although this may be said of any HANDEL performance, there are at least
two thousand more, than ordinary reasons why Punch should impress, it in the
prospect of next Friday. Everybody knows that of all oratorios Israel in Egypt is
most famous for its chorusses. And these are given generally by some five, hundred
strong, while fifteen hundred more will sing in them at Sydenham. It has been
said that HANDEL had a wish to introduce a cannon in a chorus, and thought that
a tem-pounder part would prove a most effective addition to the score, and be
pretty sure to go off stunningly. But what would he have given to command such
a battery as F. M. Costa's, where every note that issues is a 2,000 pounder 1, ..
Mr. Punch has little doubt that he would quite maintain his prophetic reputation
were he to anticipate the praises of the press, and to write beforehand an eulogistic
criticism, giving ... to every one who had a hand or a voice in the
performance—from the deepest of the bass down to (speaking locally) the highest
of the trebles—from CoMMANDER-IN-CHIEF Costa up to (speaking_locally) the
artistes who assisted in the blowing of the organ-bellows. Mr. Punch, if so
inclined, could with easc proceed to take a leaf out of the note-books of those
clairvoyant critics, who are so unbiassed by their sense of º that they can
write down their opinion of a musical performance quite as well before as after
they have listened to it. It is the business of these ready writers to keep con-
stantly on hand a stock of critical expressions which will be found suitable to
every emergency; and by the clairvoyance of their craft they are enabled to
foresee how a concert will go off, and to furnish a fore-chronicle of its minutest
details. Taking the Morning Herald for his guide (which paper lately published a
critique of a performance that had never taken place), Mr. Punch would undertake
at a few moments’ notice to supply a most ºf criticism of the Festival
—prophetically stating what points were missed, and which were made the most
of what applause was given, and out of how many encores the performers would
º certainly been swindled but for the timely intervention of himself and the
police.
With the power he possesses to direct his vision clean into the middle of next
week, nothing would be easier than for Mr. Punch to enter into the most
microscopic details, and give a full statistical account of the exact number of
handkerchiefs that were waved to the performers, and of the precise duration of
the cheers with which, at the close of their week's work, they were greeted; and
Mr. Punch would specially delight in chronicling how, by way of a finale, the
º notion was conceived of bath-chairing MR. Costa, who thereupon was seated
in his car of triumph, and dragged by a well-chosen team of his prettiest soprani
and contralti round the building.
By the time that Mr. Punch's next week's notice can be issued, the vocabulary
of criticism will have been thoroughly exhausted, and the most original and freshest
of expressions will run the risk of being regarded as mere plagiaries. There is
consequently, now the more temptation to resort to his prophetic faculties, and
to let his readers know what he thought of the Great Festival, before it became
stale news for them to hear it. Mr. Punch quite expects that the magnitude of the
effect will be found much in excess of that of preparation, although for weeks
he has been hearing that the minutest note will be on such a major scale, that it
will be difficult to find words big enough to talk of it. Yet in addition to the
statement that the leaves of the music-books would |. suffice to paper—on both
sides of it—the Great Wall of China, and if piled in double heap, would far out-top
the Andes; Mr. Punch expects that he will next week have to chronicle the fact,
that the buttons which were burst by the Stentors of the chorus measured, when
picked up, precisely one-and-twenty bushels; while not only, as a correspondent
of the Times discovered, were the notes of the great organ, plainly audible at
Norwood, but every beat of the big drum was most distinctly heard at Brighton,
and several of the chorusses were listened to at Calais.
With the foreknowledge of these facts it can be no wonder that Mr. Punch
should consider the Sydenham Festival as being the Eighth Wonder of the Musical
| World, and should thus exhort his readers to avoid the disgrace which he hopes
will attach to those who wilfully were absent. For it is as much a duty as a
C Cº
F. to attend there. The King of Composers is now
olding his Court at the Crystal Palace, and with such
pomp and circumstance as never has been equalled. Let
then every faithful subject not fail to pay him tribute (a
half guinea will suffice, if he can't hº a whole one), and
rove his loyalty to the Monarch of Music, by bringing to

OBJECTS AT THE DRAWING-ROOM.
The Court Newsman informs us that, on
Saturday last,
“Before the Drawing Room, HER MAJESTY, accord-
ing to custom, received a deputation from Christ's
Hospital in the Throne Room.”
We further learn from the courtly journalist,
that the deputation included forty boys of the
Royal Mathematical School, founded by KING
CHARLEs THE SEcond. Of course these
scholars appeared before HER MAJESTY in
full dress, which, if similar to that of the
other Bluecoat boys, may have been com-
pared by the QUEEN with the costume of the
adult members of the deputation, and then
our gracious SoverEIGN may have experienced
some difficulty in deciding whether the old

iveries, or the young ones in their petticoats
and yellow stockings, presented the more
ridiculous appearance.

Superfluous Talent.
A BLUE Book relative to the Civil Service
Examinations contains a statement that a
certain candidate for the appointment of letter-
carrier distinguished himself by his proficiency
in logarithms. , What recommendation that
proficiency could be to a letter-carrier it is
not easy to understand. Letters are employed
in logarithms, but, for a letter-carrier we do
not want a man who can §§ letters in his
head, but one who carries his letters in a bag,
and conveys them as quickly as possible to
their destinations.

THE SOCIAL TREAD-MILL. No. 8.
“WHAT follows, on such dinners as the Kotoos' is little, if at all,
less dreary than the dinner itself. There is certainly a momentary
relief when MRs. KQToo gives a glance round the table with an
inclination of her head that takes in all the ladies, as much as to say—
‘Don’t you think, my dears, the gentlemen want a little free and eas

selves, I believe the wives of England would do more to put down the
Social Tread-mill than all these papers will ever do, if I continue them
till the public refuses to read or Mr. Punch to print any more. So
far as I have observed, the wives of England are more desirous of
squaring expenditure by means, more afraid of debt and the shuffling
and meanness it occasions, less anxious about keeping up appearances,
-in a word, more, honest than the husbands of j. y a great
deal. I think the luckiest º that could happen to nineteen married
men out of twenty would be for their wives to be entrusted with the
control of the cheque-book, and the husbands put on a quarterly
allowance of pocket-money. It is not, then, because the women are
peculiarly humbugs that I feel more at ease when MRs. Kotoo has
convoyed them into the drawing-room; but because we, the men, have
none of us. been quite ourselves while they continued at the table.
The sensation produced by their departure, is rather like that of
easing one's waistcoat-strap after a good dinner—a kind of moral
‘déboutonnement.”
“A certain style of subject, a certain tone of allusion, a certain class
of jokes and good stories may be ventured on now, from which the
female presence restrained us. To our shame be it. I do not mean
to say that this is so at all parties. But it is true of far too
many.
“Unless this be so, I don't know any reason for keeping up this
habit of separating the sexes after dinner. If it enables the ladies to
iscussus, their lords; to compare social notes usefully; to make a little
bout de toilette ; or even to have out among themselves any little
affairs of fºliº honour, or business that may be on hand, that is
another matter. I know nothing of the mysteries of the Gynaeceum.
(It is a harmless Greek word, ladies, and means ‘the apartment of the
women.'). But so far as I have ventured to pry into them, I gather
that the ladies, as a general rule, by no means approve of this segre-
gation; that the hour or half-hour spent in the drawing-room is very

dull and flat indeed; that it only tends to breed the smallest of small
talk; in short, that there is no better reason on the female than there
is on the male side for keeping up this practice. It is an inheritance
from those times when gentlemen made a practice of getting drunk after
dinner. It might well have disappeared as completely as the con-
vivial habit which gave rise to it. - -
“I can’t say we were happy after the ladies left us. Neither the
company nor the wine was good enough for that. FLAUNTER would
talk about the Oaks and the Chester Cup, and how. FLASHMAN had
º been made safe in the Two Thousand, with a wonderful
story of old, Moss, the great betting agent, how he had come, into
TATTERSALL's yard on settling day with forty thousand pounds in
new notes in his pockets, and had left it with two pound ten, and some
odd coppers. W. listened, but it didn't interest us any more than
the circuit stories contributed º BLADEBONE; or ‘that very good
thing CAMPBELL said in that great crim. con. case the other day—the
Indian case—HILLHouse y. GRIFFIN, you know.' And PENNYBoy
would talk about books, of all things, and took to praising Allison's
History, of all books to praise, which happened to be a strong subject
of the Reviewer, who had just been dissecting SIR ARCHIBALD for a
forthcoming number of his periodical, and who served up to.us a
string of Allisonisms, headed by the famous one of his translation of
‘droits du timbre,’ into ‘timber duties.’ And then the Author out of
spite against the Reviewer, defended SIR ARCHIBA1D, and declared
him to be a great master of style, and praised his extraordinary
lucidity and power of arrangement. All which the Reviewer answered
contemptuously, and the Author retorted with sneers; till somehow
we found ourselves all talking at, once with great vehemence, and
nobody listening to anything anybody else was saying:
“Kotoo wisely put a stop to the row, by asking if anybody would
take any more wine?’ and getting up, without waiting for an answer
to his own question, led the way to the drawing-room. So we ‘joined
the ladies.” I dare say they had been natural till we came in ; very
stupid probably, but still natural. We had been more natural, cer-
tainly in the dining-room after they went-coarser, and more selfish,
that is, and less courteous and respectful to each other. -

and put on our vizors—like Falstaff’s thieves—and with the usual simper;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[June 20, 1857.
I have observed that this invasion of aſter-dinner visitors always occurs
at such houses as the Kotoo's. It is a thing to be vehemently pro-
tested against. You might just as well dash a dozen buckets of cold
water into your warm bath before ºf into it, as pour, a dozen
strange guests into a party of º who have dined together. Be
content with simpler dinners, and then you may give five where you give
one now. Always ask a good proportion of young ladies to dine, and
your parties will be all the prettier and pleasanter. But never, never,
as you value the comfort of your dinner F. or your own repu-
tation as a host or hostess, invite a batch of young ladies to ‘come in
in the evening.’
“It is setting a man to the task of Sisyphus, to condemn him to
hoist a new-comer, up the hill of small talk. And then, the
odious cruelty to which these poor girls are sure to be subjected
The way in which, without any regard to their own honest sense of
incapacity, or our susceptibilities, they are ordered to the piano, and
made to ilay and sing, no matter whether nature has or has not given
them ear or voice Have they not had guinea lessons from HERR
BLAUSENBALG or SIGNOR GRATTINI ? And for what end, if not to
qualify them for inflicting this sort of penance upon, society? This
mournful kind of playing and singing by people who have no musical
capacity or love for what they are doing, to other people who don't
know them, and don't care for them or their music, and who never
asked for it, and who would rather ten thousand times not have it, is
one of the most wearing grinds on the Social Tread-mill, and one to which
we are oftener condemned, perhaps, than to any other.
“The hardest part of the case is, that the poor ministers of the
torture feel it as acutely as the sufferers.
“Mr. Punch has this week forwarded to the sufferer who writes
these papers, a letter from two young ladies, who describe themselves
as “in training for the Social Tread-mill.”
‘Their protest is against the style of education which they, like
other young ladies, are receiving.
“‘Of foreign languages,’ write CoNSTANCE and EMILY—thank you,
young ladies, for your pretty names, at all events—" (if too many be not
crammed into our heads at once) we do not complain. We like
travelling, and when we go abroad the knowledge of these languages
conduces much to the pleasure derived from the trip, and is extremely
useful”—“to us?'—no–the sly pusses—‘to Papa, and brothers, who
having had their time taken up with Greek and Latin, Law and
Physic, seldom speak French or German intelligibly.”
“We will allow CoNSTANCE and EMILY their little, joke at the
expense of masculine ignorance. At the same time we should like to
ask CoNSTANCE and EMILY to put their taper white hands on their
hearts—if those articles have not been stolen—and say how many of
their friends have learnt, either at school or from a governess, to speak
French, Italian, or German, so as to enable their Papas or brothers to
dispense with a courier in the family travels? -
“But,’ continue ConstancE and EMILY, ‘why should we all, irre;
spectively of the talent we may or may not possess, have music and
rawing inflicted on us? We are told these arts afford enjoyment to
the rich, and employment to the poor. So they may when there is
great talent: but, alas, to the majority of us, they are but sources of
grief when we are learning them, and of shame and mortification when
we are compelled to show off our accomplishments to our unadmiring
friends. We can perfectly appreciate the verdict “very sweet!” pro-
nounced by sarcastic persons on our most bitterly out-of-time-and-tune
performances, and the contemptuous “very pretty!” when our bad
drawings are displayed.’
“Grief, shame, and mortification, my dear, young ladies! You
forget you are in training for the Social Tread-mill. You have no right
to any such feelings. The Artful Dodger might as well talk of grief,
shame, and mortification, when brought before the beak, for É.
found with his hand in a gentleman's pocket. You must put ...;
puling sentimentality in your pockets—if you wear those antiquated
receptacles—and learn to brazen it out, like your sisters in check
aprons, and blue, stuff bed gowns at Brixton, and take your punish-
ment like ‘game 'uns’ and trumps.’
“You write, in your simplicity, as if you thought the object of your
education was to make you, better and wiser women. My dear
children, you have described that object much better, when you spoke
of being “in training for the Social Tread-mill.’ It is to harden your
hearts against self-accusation, to plate your faces against shame, and
to steel your nerves against weariness, that they are putting you
through this preparation for your life-long penance. You are to be
fitted to catch husbands, not to live with them. The one is a great
art: the other comes by nature, I suppose.
“It is clear to me, however, that your training is being very seriously
neglected. You talk about ‘wishing to be taught to play and sing
simple English songs,’ instead of "difficult fantasias or astonishing
bravuras in a few guinea lessons from German or Italian professors’—
about ‘much preferring to learn to read well aloud good English
poetry and prose, to sitting for two or three hours daily on a hard
music-stool, before, a tinkling piano, practising horrid exercises and
dreary pieces'—Why, bless my heart! the chafing filly which you see
—- -------
Miss REYNoLDs putting through its paces in Rotton Row might just
as reasonably complain of that §§ lady's sharp curb and stinging
little whip, or of the tiny spurs hidden under the short skirt of her
habit. e filly is not there to enjoy herself, but that she may learn to
carry a lady! So you are not being educated to make the best of
your head and heart, but that you may learn to “attract agentleman!’”

The figure of jumping into
another man's shoes when you

is common enough, but the idea
of jumping into another man's
entire suit of clothes, is some-
thing delightfully new. But supposing, for men will vary in height,
the clothes didn't fit him * The }. might be º awkward as well as
ridiculous. The advertiser should have given the particulars of his
proportions. He should have stated at full-length how high he
stood without his stockings, how much he measured, round the
waist, and whether he was inclined to corpulency or not, with full
details as to the breadth of his shoulders, the circumference of his
calves, &c., &c. There is a lamentable omission, also, which we
regret, for the Assistant Surgeon says nothing about his boots, or
his slippers, or his old gloves, or his hats. e cannot help thinking
that }. man who would purchase the cast-off clothes of another
would not be over-nice as to the acquisition of his other, articles of
apparel. ... Really, we thought that such F. were only common
in establishments where flunkeys, found their own liveries. We have
heard that the incoming JEAMEs has bought at a considerable reduc-
tion the abdicated plush of the outgoing JEAMEs, but we little sus-
pected that medical officers were in the habit of trying it on in a
similar manner. What pains us more than anything else, is to find
that this Esculapian Jew clothes'man belongs to a militia regiment.
Now, we should have thought that a militia regiment was about the
very last in which such a penurious turn-coat was...likely to have
signalised himself. One thing is pretty clear, the militia in question
couldn't have been Bucks.

LIVING MON
A CoNversation, calculated to awaken thought, took place, the
other evening, in the House of Commons. SIR. F. BARING called
attention to the expenditure on improvements in St. James's Park,
amounting to £11,000 incurred irrespectively of any parliamentary
yote: whereupon MR. Mowbray remarked that this was not the only
instance of a expenditure without the previous sanction of the
House; thousands having been spent last year upon fireworks., As to
the fireworks, the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequek reminded the
House that their expense was defrayed out of the Civil *::::
—a gross amount placed at the disposal of the Government. The first
uestion suggested, by these statements and , observations to the
thoughtful mind is, how much the better anybody now is for the ten-
thousand-pounds-worth of fireworks burnt last year, except the pyro-
technists and their men, who were paid to make them and to let them
off? The next is, whether the quantity of pleasure distributed over the
London multitude by the display of the fireworks was not, for each
UMENTS.
individual, exceedingly small? We then naturally ask, whether it
would not have been much better to concentrate the happiness to
be had for £10,000 by bestowing the amount upon one individual?
An individual then beatified with that sum might be living now,
and †† survive for many years, and his life, , whilst, it lasted,
would be, one prolonged rejoicing for the conclusion of last year's

A SHORT WAY WITH A LUNATIC.
ANY medical man who wants to get rid of an insane patient, or
who knows anybody that wants to get rid of an insane relation, will
perhaps find, the means of accomplishing his object, or that, of the
other party, by the help of the subjoined advertisement: for which he
is recommended to search the recent numbers of all the daily papers;
in one of which it is quoted from a medical journal:—
NSANITY. —Twenty per cent. annually on the receipts will be
ranteed to any Medical man recommending a quiet Patient of either sex, to

Twenty per cent. on the receipts for the board, lodging, and care of
the unhappy lunatic, screwed out of the lunatic's board and lodging,
would pro * .. a considerable abridgment of the patient’s
natural life. On the other hand, to be sure, the advertising madhouse.
keeper would have an interest in prolonging the existence of his
unfortunate charge: and, moreover, he might easily cheat the medical
man out of the guaranteed twenty per cent, which surely would be a
consideration secured by a no more valid bond than a contract entered
into for an immoral purpose.

TRANSATLANTIC TIGERS.
WHEN GENERAL HENNINGSEN, the accomplice of GENERALWALKER
– Generals in the like service with that wherein the celebrated
Macheath was Captain—landed the other day, with a number of other
scoundrels at New York, the rascaldom of that city expressed, their
sympathy with the General of Filibusters by giving him three cheers,
and, by the account of the New York Herald, “repeated the number in
tigers.” What our American contemporary means by tigers we do
not know, but we are at no loss to conjecture; and we conclude that
the tigers in which the New York ruffians redoubled their cheers of
their hero HENNINGSEN were notes, or keys resembling in tone and
uality the revolting yells and howlings of the ferocious beasts so
iºd.
Petticoat Government.
The Estaffette informs us that the Préfect of the Seine has appointed
female searchers at all the barrières of Paris to examine all females
wearing Crinoline, as these voluminous petticoats are extensively
employed for smuggling. This might be described by our euphemistic
friend, Le Follet, in the following modish terms:–
“Crinolines continue to be worn, with the addition of visites—d la barrière.”
We trust that the Dover and Folkestone custom-houses will not be
invaded by the “right of search” in this form at all events.

to imagine that a

impression. hen people take and carry away anything from any:
body between them, there can be no mistake in the matter: either, it
is sold to them, or given to them, or they possess themselves of it by
a method which the wise call “conveying.” The party, described as
having taken the mantle in mistake for their own, must, of course, be
a plural party; whereas none but a singular party can possibly make
a mistake of that nature.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
June 15th, Monday. LoRD CAMPBELL, in further defiance of the
LoRD CHANCELLOR, who had asserted that no such measure was
necessary, introduced a Bill for the putting an end to the sale of
immoral publications. The process is to be the summary one employed
in ºf to Betting Houses, and it is to be hoped that the Magis-
trates, in enforcing it, will reverse, the policy, which they seem always
to adopt with the betting-scoundrels, and, if there be a doubt, give
the public, and not the notorious offender, the benefit of such doubt.
LoRD, CLANRICARDE brought a mass of complaint, against the
Indian Police, but as the Duke of ARGYLL said that there was no
case made out, there is an end of the matter.
The Commons discussed the Jew Bill, more politely called the Oaths
Bill, in committee. The Papist party, who assume to themselves the
title of Liberal, began the battle by an attempt to get the Catholic
oath included in the measure, notwithstanding that they had been
warned by Lord PALMERston that they might injure the cause of the
Jews by a demand to which the feeling of the country is adverse. The
Commons made very short work with these persons, rejecting the pro-
position by 373 to 83. SIR FREDERICK THESIGER then charged, with
all the forces of the Opposition, and was defeated, by 341 to 201, in
his endeavour to make a Jew declare himself a Christian, Mr. Punch
has too often protested against the shallow nonsense talked on both
sides of the question to make it needful for him to say more than that,
while recording the vote, he greatly, despises, most of the arguments
used to promote and to hinder it, and especially, the Jaunty Wiscount's
mode of getting rid of principles by alleging that Parliament's business
is with politics, not religion. In life, a man who separates his religion
from his politics is excessively likely to separate the ". Onl
the practice of duty, even to the extent of separating his neighbour's
pocket-book and pocket. SIR John PAKINGTON, hitherto an opponent
of the Jewish claims, made a manly speech, in which he avowed his
inability to persist in resisting them. MR. WAirole pointed out that
if the Bill became law, a Jew could hold office (that of Chancellor for
instance) which a Catholic could not. Now, here is a real grievance,
worth Lord CRAN worth's weight in lead, for the Popish party.
What 1 Issach AR BEN Moses may keep the QUEEN’s conscience, and
be raised to the peerage as BARoN PHYLActERY, and there is no
such chance for B. MAC SULLIVAN–no title of Rosa Ry-cum-
Twipple. Shades of the hundreds of Catholic patriots who have died in
their beds, look down upon their children, thus oppressed by the Saxon!
TAWERN, Green- ||b
Tuesday. More about India, in the Lords, but not much to the
purpose. LoRD CAERNARVoN’s proposition for enabling Magistrates
to ºffender, up to the age of 20, to reformatories, was
negratlved.
he virtuous WESTMEATH will not be permitted to reform those
whom SYDNEY SMITH called “the debauched London bathers at
.#. The House of Lords does not consider the regulation of
bathing machines, and the question of bathing dresses, matters for
Imperial legislation. It is thought that if the Magistrates of the
boroughs washed by the sea are in earnest about decency they can
send a constable up to his knees in the water to drag out any person
misconducting himself, and to remove him to the lock-up. y, how-
ever, gentlemen and ladiesshould not habitually follow French precedent,
in regard to aquatic costume, Mr. Punch is unaware. he lady's
bathing dress is both pretty and modest, and has only to be known to
e admired, and Mr. Punch hopes to admire it, and many a lovely,
radiant, and smiling face above it, during his autumnal pilgrimages.
Finally, the whole case is one of police, and if sea-side Magistrates were
less zealous in supporting their neighbours, the keepers of lodging-
houses, in all disputes touching the extortions of the latter, and were
more anxious to do their duty by the public, there would be no need
to bother Mr. Punch or the other noblemen of the nation about such
a matter.
The Commons decided that whatever case there might be for the
equalisation of poor rates, MR. AYRTON, of the Tower Hamlets, had
not brains enough to state it, and by 183 to 81 they snuffed out the
said AYRTON of the Tower Hamlets.
Wednesday. They were laudably engaged in perfecting a measure
regarding industrial schools.
Thursday. Rather a remarkable day, for, LoRD PALMERston's
Ministry was all but defeated in the Lords, and quite defeated in the
Commons. In the former, after some Parsons had mercifully petitioned
fº the permitting a wicked husband or wife to be separated from
the person suffering by the wickedness, LoRD DERBy assailed the
excellent Bill for getting rid of Ministers’ Money in Ireland. He
was unkindly reminded that this was a small Church reform compared
to what he himself had effected, when, as LoRD STANLEY, he bowled
down Ten Bishops at a blow; but this he justly º: as no argu-
ment, seeing that in those days he was a Reformer, but has since come
over to Toryism. On division he would have triumphed, had the peers
present settled the business, he having 71 to 65, but the proxies altered
the case, and the second reading was carried by 101 to 96. Mr. Panch
has heard of a Tory Baron who went to dinner with two proxies in his
pocket, and of a #. Duke who was unaware of the debate—a little
more whipping, and the PREMIER would have been floored. [Latest
betting against Rothschild, 6 to 2, n. t.)
In the Commons, after some spirited complaints of the confusion of
our Army Departments, to which the only answer seems to be, that
the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE and Lord PANMURE are on excellent
terms, the eternal Map question came up. For seventy years have the
authorities been º the kingdoms, first on the scale of an inch to
a mile, then six inches, then twenty-six inches and three-quarters.
This last was in Scotland, where the landowners made a job of it,
getting º plans of their estates at the national expense.
much did the Lairds value this, that Mr. Punch knows of one who
actually subscribed £1500 to ; his part of the country mapped early.
Well, a good map is a good thing, but the Scotch job was sto to-
night, and Government, beaten by 10, In, revenge, a Scotch Member
tried to stop the English survey, ſº this ebullition of spite found only
22 supporters against 290 opponents.
Friday. Nothing particular in the Lords, except that poor CRANNY,
being asked about Bishops' resignations, flew to such recondite
authorities as BLAckstone and BURN for his law. -
In the Commons, SIR. B. HALL announced that on the 25th the
decision on the Public Qffices Designs would be given, and scores of
architects immediately began stabbing their drawing boards with
dividers, º their set-squares about the office, and refreshing
themselves in evations of much originality, in their frightful excite-
ment. Some malpractices to get rid of a witness on the Rochdale
Election petition were exposed, as was the affair at Greytown, where
Government let the Americans burn our property and insult our flag,
but found out that the law of nations forbad even remonstrance.
Wiscount WILLIAMs made bitter complaint that all Hampton Court
Palace should be kept in simultaneous repair, and SIR John SHELLEY
(not usually witty) made some fun by picturing the Wiscount
with ºut y dirty face, the sides of which he washed on
alternate days.
Sweeping Denunciation.
MR. KER, SEYMER, is very indignant about the Cows in Hyde Park.
They spoil the ladies' dresses, he says. His indignation is certainly
excusable, for it is only natural that that which soils silks and satins,
should give a turn, also, to Ker-Seymer(e).

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT I HEARD, SAW, AND THOUGHT, AT THE
SYDENHAMI FESTIVAL,
(By One who has no Wish to be Mistaken for a Critic.)
“IFAvour you with this communication, Mr. Punch, because I am
quite sure no other Editor will print it. from the Times down even
to the Penny Morning Startler, every newspaper, I know, has a repu:
tation to maintain for giving insertion only to the most profound of
criticism; and I should as soon expect you to report verbatim one of
SpoonER's speeches as I should anticipate that any one of your
contemporaries would give a corner to a correspondent souncritical as I
am. For at the outset, Mr. Punch, I must candidly confess to you that I
know as little of orchestral slang as I do of High Dutch (Billingsgate),
or the chaff of a fast, Cherokee or Feejee, Islander. In my present
ignorance I own I could no more explain what is meant by ‘harmonic
progressions’ than attempt to give †. plot of an Astleian hippodrama;
and I should as soon expect to follow SIR CHARLEs NAPIER's reasoning
as to comprehend such a phrase as ‘contrapuntal complications.”
“But among your countless readers, Mr. Punch, there are no doubt
some thousands who feel puzzled like myself, when they hear of a
“fugued passage’ being exquisitely, ‘rendered,' or of the counter-
subject, being “formally constructed,” or of the ‘plain song abounding
in florid divisions;” and it may not be uninteresting to some of them
to meet with a few paragraphs about the HANDEL Festival which will
have the novelty of not being unintelligible. And, as I heard the
performances from first to last %. a few bars, which I was robbed
of by some cheats who tried to swindle an encore) I feel inclined to
write a letter upon what I chiefly made a note of.
“In the first place, Mr. Punch, I think the sight at Sydenham was
as wondrous as the hearing. A deaf man or a blind one would have
equally been charmed there. To see the orchestra alone was worth
£oming up from the yery Land's, End or John o'Groat's house—
I expect that for my lifetime I shall keep in my mind's eye that acre
of white waistcoats, with the rood, which was sown with brighter
dresses in the midst of it: and I shall not easily lose sight of that
forest of fiddlesticks, or the turning of the leaves, as thickly fluttering
as those in Wallombrosa, of the chorus-books. Other pens have pre-
ceded me, and I suppose there is hardly a newspaper in the kingdom
but has described the “sea of heads” on the shoulders of the audience,
and aptly carried out this marine expression by next bringing in
the horticultural remark that a “parterre of blooming faces” was pre-
sented by the ladies. But without the aid of reference to these des-
criptive writers, I shall long remember the delighted looks of all the
listeners: among whom I wished KING HANDEL could himself have
§. in earshot, and have sat the honoured guest of our pleased QUEEN
ICTORLA.
“Accustomed as I am to hypercritical society, it is no new phrase
to me to hear that the English have small reverence for music, and
can by no means be regarded as a musical nation. As a convincin
proof that this is more than ever now the fact, I find two thousan
singers giving HANDEL their week's services and months of prepara-
tion, and I find also nearly twenty times their number giving their
guineas or their half guineas to hear them. I do not mean to say that
all of these were led there only by their ears. I am conscious that on
some people the sound of a fine chorus has not so much effect as the
sound of a fine codfish: and to many of the weaker sex good millinery
is at least as attractive as good music. Two young ladies who sat by
me during Saturday's rehearsal distinguished themselves from the rapt
listeners around them by reading each a volume of a well-thumbed
novel, from which they barely once looked up º: the whole
performance. My º: itched, Iown, to twitch the volumes from
their laps, and apply them with some emphasis to the peccant ears of
the perusers. But I reflected that tastes differ, and that minds are
variously constituted: and that the power of appreciating the music
of HANDEL is limited in some people to the handle of the polka-
grinder's organ-box, or hurdy-gurdy.
“Still, with my remembrance of this festival—and such memories
as these are joys to us for ever—I cannot think John BULL can have
no music in his soul. And yet less can I believe that such a festival
as this can pass without leaving its good influence behind it. When I
see, as I have done more than once this week, *:::::: men moved to
tears by a few chords of a chorus, I can neither think them weak for
thus showing their emotion, nor can I believe but that it is good for
them. If ever I forget my selfish self it is when I am listening to
such strains as those of HANDEL. I never come away from one of his
oratorios without thinking that I feel the better for the hearing. . This
week my only shadow of regret has been that my friends, even to the
Antipodes, could not every one of them have lent me their ears, that I
might fill them with the sounds I was myself 39 revelling in. -
As for giving you statistics of the parts I most enjoyed, I might
as well try to enumerate the corks which I heard pop at the refresh-
ment counters, or to calculate what acres the ham sandwiches would !
have covered, or how far the ices if heaped up would have out-topped
Mont Blanc. I don't much envy the man who having eaten his cake
can sit down and ruminate, and try to pick the plums out, and remem:
ber how they tasted. Nor have I any sympathy with those cold-blooded
critics who can come away unwarmed by the fire of a composer, and
write a cool collected detail of each black spot they noticed. Such
men seem to me to use their ears only in the way of business, and take
the pains to listen to the Hallelujah just to see if all the ‘points’ are
rightly “taken up.” What, delights them, most is to detect a faulty
passage, or discover something wrong in the conductor's, rendering.”
. they do by stretching to their utmost ears quite long enoug
already.
… ºd, I don't mean to deny the value of good criticism, whether in
musical or any other matter; but I detest from my heart all that
usage of slang phrases which savour so of quackery and the “Omne
ignotum pro magnifico’ delusion. Let us hope that two years hence
º this will be exterminated, and that the lovers of sound will be
uided only by sound judges. We are then, it is said, to have another
É. surpassing even this, as this has far surpassed all which have
gone before it. And, as practice makes perfect, I would recommend
all those who intend to take a part in it
“Nocturnå versare manu, versare diurna;'
or if not day and night, once a month at least, until 1859 to take a turn
at HANDEL.
“I am, MR. PUNch, one who hopes then to have

THE LADIES LIQUOR LAW.
A RATHER reasonable Liquor Law has been
adopted in the state of New York. By this
enactment, the drunken, and, not the sober,
ortion of the community, are deprived of their
eer and grog. On a complaint preferred by a
wife, that her husband is an habitual drunkard,
magistrates and overseers, in towns and cities,
are empowered to prohibit publicans from #
him any drink for six months, under penalty
fifty dollars for each offence. This seems, all
very, well; but qught the charge of habitual
drunkenness to be sustainable by the mere
evidence of a wife? False accusation wºuld, of
course, be out of the question; but a wife-for
ladies are commonly inexact in their definitions
—could not perhaps be quite safely trusted to
testify to the reality of that condition, commonly
|called the state of beer. Habitual drunkenness
£º might be, in the opinion of many ladies, habitual
indulgence in the cheerful glass, exceeding, in
any measure, habitual indulgence in dress and
ſº display. The British Law’s provision, that, in
% no case shall a wife give evidence against her
husband, is perhaps most especially requisite in
cases of alleged excess infermented beverages.

Thy shepherds are a pack of wolves, and all their sheep are mere lost

Listen to us all ye saints who ought to stand in empty niches,
Wherein we to place you itch with unutterable itches.
Dirty, †. oor old men, sit there close beside a bishop,
Pretty fisher of mankind fish of such a class to fish up!
It is quite against all rule; it is wholly indecorous;
Wherefore we continually shall cry aloud in choir sonorous,
