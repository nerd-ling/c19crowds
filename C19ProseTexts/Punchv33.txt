W HEN the Daughter of England was asked in marriage by the Son of Prussia, her Royal Parents
naturally sought the advice of their sincerest friend.
“Victor IA ADELAIDE MARY Louis A is young,” replied MR. PUNCH. “She was born, Madam,
on the 21st of November, 1840. Your illustrious bride, Prince, tarried somewhat longer, longer even
than her volunteer Laureat, LEIGH HUNT, ordained:—
“‘And when nineteen years have brought
Steady eye and serious thought,
You—’
Do you remember the passage, dear Madam : It occurred in a cleverly-phrased poem, almost worthy
of PUNch, written when some provincial magnates had displayed more than usual folly in what they
deemed honour of yourself, a young lady of ten years.”
“How you remember things,” observed the QUEEN, with a smile.
“I can forget nothing that entwines itself with the fortunes of my most gracious Lady and
Mistress,” said MR. PUNch, with exquisite tenderness and a bow of the deepest devotion. “And as I
approve of early marriages, where the prospects of the young couple are tolerably favourable (as I think
we may regard those of Victoria and FREDER1c), they shall have what good DR. PRIMRose calls ‘my
consent and bounty.’”
So the Kings and Queens of the Earth sent presents, and MR. PUNCH, invited by the Princess-fiancée,
went to the Castle to see the unpacking. The Jaunty Viscount also came down, and having learned
that there was some porter’s work to do, ordered in a couple of his men, who, he remarked, were just
fit for that sort of thing. Hearing this direction, MR. PUNCH was in no way surprised to see VERNoN
SMITH and CHARLEs WooD enter humbly, and begin to open the boxes.
“The EMPERoR of Russi A sends a statuette of an Emancipated Serf,” said Wood, “as a chimney-
piece ornament. His own doing.”
“Hm,” said MR. PUNch. “I should like to see the set complete. However, if he is about it in
earnest, Heaven prosper him. What’s that, SMITH 2 °
“From the QUEEN or SPAIN, your Grace. A golden cup, used at the christening of the PRINCE ALFonso.”
“Get HAN.cock to test whether it is gold,” said MR. PUNCH. “I hope it has that value.”

[DECEMBER 26, 1857.
“The EMPERoR of Austri.A—a silver model of the Buda-Pesth Suspension Bridge.”
“Built by an Englishman—so far appropriate—but I hope the CESAR has not forgotten how his
legions caught it, thereabouts, from Hungarian patriots.”
“KING PEDIto, of Portugal—a splendid Atlas.”
“Good boy. Let him open South Africa to DR. Liv INgston E.”
“VICTOR EMANUEL, of Sardinia, a beautiful little lighthouse in silver, for pastiles.”
“His kingdom being Italy's beacon, and almost overpowering Neapolitan assafoetida—good,” said
MR. PUNCH. “Suppose he had been a Protestant,” whispered he, playfully, to the Princess.
“It would have been very good for his interests—hereafter,” replied the young lady, demurely, and
then laughing as Seventeen should laugh.
“ABDUL MEDschid,” said Wood (after several blunders over the name), “an alabaster model of
St. Sophia’s, and the Princess's name in coloured mosaics, from the dome of the original.”
“Thanks to the Princess's Mamma, and to me, Russian psalmody has not brought those mosaics
down like rain, long ago. Let us hope that his Highness will remember the fact.”
“The EMPERoR of THE FRENch—only a congratulatory letter. O yes,” said Wood, (who can't be
accurate), “inscribed, “With four white ponies, docile as French senators, and as little likely to kick over traces.’”
“But,” said MR. Punch, “not the things to drive up Constitution Hill. N'importe, the graceful
thought was the gracious EugéNIE’s, whom I love.”
“Upon my word l’” said HER MAJESTY, laughing.
“Here is something from America,” exclaimed SMITH. “With PRESIDENT BUch ANAN's kind
regards. A little statue of GeoRGE WASHINGTON, in gold.”
“You have one already, my dear, just done by one Michael, ANGELO TITMARsh, and a better
likeness, on that table,” said PRINCE ALBERT, glancing at the ‘Virginians.” “But the President is very kind.”
Dinner was announced, and a lot of boxes from the small kings and kinglets, Bavaria, Baden,
Tuscany, Greece, and so forth, were sent up to the nursery, to be opened for the amusement of HELENA,
Louis A, ARTHUR, LEoPold, and BEATRICE.
“I will not let the soup chill while I deliver a speech,” said M.R. PUNCH, stepping forward; “but
one other Potentate has humbly to pray your Royal Highness's acceptance of something—”
And kneeling on one manly knee, he made his offering.
“Worth all the rest, ten thousand times,” exclaimed the Royal Bride, echoed by all present.
And they were right, for it was KING PUNch’s
(Thirty-ſith tºlumt.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MONDAY, June 22nd. Monday was a splendidly fine and particularly
hot day, a remark which equally applies to all the other days of the
week. Meteorological influences had their effect upon the senators as
upon everybody else, and the debates were exceedingly languid and
feeble; but when the speakers did boil up into passions, they went at
it like men. The Ministers’ Money Bill has finally passed the Lords,
the EARL of DERBy not choosing to run another risk of being sent for
by the QUEEN, asked to make a Government, and having to confess
that he had nobody to make it with. However, the Conservatives
now expect to do better things, for they have bought the Morning
Herald, appointed MR. HAMILTON, member for Dublin University, its
editor, put the “Sword of Gideon” out of the way, and altogether
ven promise of energy, and of as much rationality as can be looked
or in a party that contains MR. SPOONER.
It was not to be supposed that the Grievance to which Mr. Punch
adverted last week would not be remedied. The idea of a Jew being
admissible to high office while a Catholic is excluded, was foun
so intolerable that, as the Jews’ claims had been conceded, it was
º to throw open the offices in question to their Catholic brethren?
Not exactly; but, still the parties were reduced to a level, by the
introduction into the Oaths Bill of provisions taking away what had
been accorded to the Jew. One boy has sixpence, another nothing,
and a benevolent man desires to put them on #. same footing—so he
takes away the first boy's sixpence. Even NEwpEGATE could see that
this was absurd, and he remarked upon the wisdom of the Liberal
party that would permit a Jew to make a law, and forbid him to
administer it.
It was satisfactorily ºil. by SIR B. HALL, that the stone of SIR
CHARLEs BARRY's new Houses of Tarliament is breaking to pieces, and
that the galvanised roof is rusting away. It will therefore be necessary
to have new houses and a new roof. The Commons, therefore, voted
£162,361, for SIR CHARLEs to do what he liked with." Sir B. HAL.
also explained, that the usual fatality of blunder had attended the clock
and bells business, and that the former had been put up before the
latter, which was “a mistake,” but he hoped to hear the chimes next
session.
Tuesday. The Lords passed, the Divorce, Bill, by 46 to 25; the
majority, it is believed, having been considerably increased by a ganting
professional protest with which Saponaceous SAMUEL of Oxford broke
out just before division, to the great discontent of their lordships. It
may be mentioned that the imprisonment provision was removed from
the Bill. REDESDALE, MALMESBURY, and NELsoN (a nice trio), did their
best to cripple the measure, and the former has brought in an opposi-
tion Divorce Bill of his own, LoRD BROUGHAM says, that when the
In easure º: there will be no such, great, rush for divorces; but
some of t.*. and bishops evidently think that all the BRowNs,
JoNESEs, RoBINsoNs in the kingdom are respectively dying to be
rid of their lawful ribs, and that in about a year you will hardly meet
such a thing as a man with a wife.
Wiscount WILLIAMs and a majority in the Commons decided to
adjourn the Bill for providing a park for the Finsbury people, for
whose benefit Government had promised to ask the House for £50,000.
The Wiscount thinks that if the Finsbury, folk want fresh air, they
had better order round their carriages and drive over to Battersea;
but we fear this haughty aristocrat does not understand the wants of
the humbler classes. LoRD RAYNHAM, as has before been noted, is
aiming at a honourable distinction by ºf the oppressed, and he
has this week forced upon the attention of the Howe SECRETARY
some cases of brutal assaults on women, has introduced a Bill against
cruelty to animals, and has brought up the barbarities of certain work-
houses, a select committee on which he lost by 21 only.
An India debate followed, but it is no subject for light treatment,
for while Members were droming about cotton, and MANGLEs was
uffing the Company as hº..."i. miracles for India, news was
urrying over the sea that native regiments were in mutiny, had
seized Delhi, and murdered all the Europeans there, without distinction
of age or sex. It is a good time to be erecting a Shropshire memorial
to CLIVE, if only to remind England that she once had a man who
knew not only how to gain, but how to keep Oriental conquests.
Wednesday. A long Irish squabble on a law bill.
Thursday. LoRD CAMPBELL’s bill against immoral publications was
read a second time, after a diverting speech against it from LoRD
LYNDHURST, who contended that the police ought not to be empowered
to deal with the beasts of Holywell Street, because CoRREGIo and
other great painters have demoralised Art in certain cases, and because
WycHERLY, CONGREVE, DRYDEN, and all French. novelists, have
occasionally written impurely. Nevertheless, as a lively old gentle-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
º º: of improprieties, the speech was indulgently listened to
the Lords.
*T. Commons passed the Oaths Bill, after LoRD BLANDFORD had
delivered a dull, and MR. DRUMMOND a diverting speech against...it,
and MR. O'Donoghue (if this Irish party thinks The Punch is going
to recognise O’D.’s ridiculous assumption of the definite article, as if
there were only one O'D. in the world, whereas there are a dozen in
any courtin St. Giles's, MR. O'D9NOGHUE makes another blunder) had
objected to it because it was a Ministerial job, intended as a mere sop
to certain Liberals, and because it did not, relieve the Papists. A
great many of the latter voted against the Bill, and the final majority
was but 291 to 168. - -
An Education Debate, and a still more sensible thing, an Educational
Vote of £361,233, did some credit to the sitting. BERNAL QSBORNE
took an opportunity of saying an agreeable thing to ColoSEL FRENCH,
who had observed upon the attendance of the 79th at the Victoria
Cross distribution. MR. Osbor NE said that they would be present
because they were on their way to Dublin, and not on account of their
dress, “a reason that no one but a Militia officer would have dreamed
of.” Doubtless BERNAL feels towards the Militia the lofty contempt
of an ex-captain in the real Army, but he should not be so rude.
Friday. India was talked of in the Lords, but the Telegraph mes-
sage was still a few hours off, or the tone of the speakers would have
been graver. The chief topic in the Commons was the Wills Bill,
against which divers members emitted the growls of the Proctors,
those of York especially, selecting as their organ MR. GEORGE HUpson,
formerly Monarch of Railways, but discrowned long ago, for deficient
amounts and cooked accounts, and all thai sort of thing, you know.
RAILWAY ECONOMY.
= ~, N certain, if not on all railways, an
- 7 economy is practised in an article wherein
== | a rather more liberal, expenditure is de;
º- | sirable, which might be incurred without
jº any appreciable detriment to dividends.
E- e allude to the parsimony of speech
and pronunciation evinced by those ser-
wants of the various companies, whose
duty it is to shout out the names of
the several stations at which the trains
stop. #.Fº in a long train
are so situated that they cannot see the
station-board, and are accordingly de-
pendent for the knowledge of their
whereabout on the cries of those officials.
Now these cries often consist of abbre-
viations which are quite unintelligible.
On the South Eastern line, the other day,
our ears, at one station, were greeted with
the monosyllabic exclamations of “’Oss!
'Oss!” A little farther on, they were
saluted with the equall compendious
vociferations of “N’am N’am I ?” These
semi-articulate sounds, we found, on in-
quiry, to mean “New Cross” and “Syd-
enham.” . Neither of those places hap-
- ;" to be our destination; but if we
ad been bound for either, we should
certainly have been conveyed beyond it,
save for the vigilance and alertness which
we are happily endowed with, and which we exhibit on all occasions.
How Estimates Grow !
THE estimate for the proposed expenditure of the Public Offices is
£5,000,000. The sum originally proposed for building the Houses of
Parliament was £250,000. According to MR. WISE, this sum has since
grown into an outlay of not less than £2,500,000—that is to say, amodest
excess of precisely ten times the original estimate. Now, if the esti.
mate for the Public Offices is to expand in the like moderate propor-
tion, the ultimate outlay, far from being £5,000,000, will be some
£50,000,000; and as the money goes, we may consider ourselves
extremely lucky, if we get off as cheaply as that!. Parliament is sup-
posed to legislate for the million; and it must be for the million, for it
is but too evident they take no care of the millions.

THE STAR OF VALOUR.
DISTRIBUTED BY THE QUEEN'S OWN HAND,
JUNE 26, 1857.
A RIFT is made in that dark shade
Which o'er our soldiers flung its blight,
And through the shroud of its cold cloud,
The Star of Valour throws its light.
Low-born and noble, side by side,
Colonel and private, stand to-day:
Their comrades’ boast, their country’s pride,
Where all were brave, the bravest they !
The fount of Honour, sealed till now
To all save claims of rank and birth,
Makes green the laurel on the brow,
Ennobled but by soldier's worth.
The QUEEN’s own hand, on each brave breast—
Beat it 'neath serge or superfine—
Hangs the plain cross, whose bronze, so prest,
Beameth with more than diamond’s shime.
That bronze, cast from the steadfast guns,
Which blazed along the red Redan,
Whose maddening music, while it stuns
The coward, only wakes the man.
From whose hot muzzles was plucked forth,
The fame, their metal now rewards
In these plumed warriors of the North,
These Sailors, Rifles, Linesmen, Guards.
These Heavy Horsemen who rode out,
Stern and sedate, though one to ten :
Then, through the Russian line in rout,
Stern and sedate, rode back again.
And these Light Horse—of deathless name,
Who charged ..". of their doom,
Through those long miles aii fire and flame,
And at the end, a soldier's tomb
Of these the bravest and the best
Who'scaped the chance of shot and sword,
Pººl doth, by her QUEEN, invest
ith Walour's Cross—their great reward!
Marking her sense of something, still,
A central nobleness, that lies
Deeper than rank which royal will,
Or birth, or chance, or wealth supplies.
Knighthood that girds all valiant hearts,
Knighthood that crowns each fearless brow;
That Knighthood this bronze cross imparts—
Let Fleece, and Bath, and Garter bow !
WINDOW-GARDENING.
WE have seen a wonderful specimen of window-gardening. This
bright specimen may be seen in #. Street any day, from isi.
until dark, at the Junior United Service Club. You must look up to
the drawing-room window, and there you will behold it in all its efful-
#. beauty. The effect is exceedingly simple, but positively startling
rom its excess of . We have rarely seen an effect so strong pro-
duced by means so limited. You must fancy a wooden box about the
length of your walking-stick and not wider than your bootjack. This
box. is painted green-but the bright green of a lady's parasol-a
million times greener than any penny Pickwick! Well, inside this box
may be distinctly seen a profusion of Mignonette! it is evidently of
the very best. The stalks tower up to the first sash at least of the
handsome sheet of plate glass that frames it in behind. The leaves
cluster socially together, as thick as policemen at night. First you
have the stone window-sill—on that rests the green box—and soaring
high over them both, you see the Mignonette | The effect to be appre-
ciated must be seen. In the afternoon, it is seen, perhaps, to the
reatest advantage. When the sun is shining on MR. BELLEw’s side of
the street, we have counted as many as ten noses–Roman, Grecian,
and every nasal order of architecture—leaning lovingly at the same
time over that simple little box! It is seemingly the members' pride,
their JQY, their floricultural plaything, their łºi Picciola, the

House of Call for the Clergy.
IN an article on the subject of archidiaconal visitations,
our highly improved contemporary, the Morning Post,
states that on the occasion of those ecclesiastical gather-
ings, “the Clergy adjourn to the chief hotel to dine with
the Archdeacon, and the wardens to some inferior public-
house to dine with the apparitor.” Surely, this is a mis-
take. The secular church-wardens and apparitor, as men of
the world, adjourn to the chief hotel; and the parsons, in
their professional humility, of course, betake themselves to
Hall, if Exeter Hall, instead of himself

had accused Popery of
MR. Bowy ER is the Member for Dundalk; but the honourable and
learned gentleman sometimes talks as if he were the representative of
Bedlam. That any man should have a serious objection, to take any
9ath. which he consents, to take, is strange enough. The objection
implies something very like a consciousness of perjury, unless it is only
maniacal. , Let MR. Bowy ER be supposed to want reason rather than
honesty; but surely nobody not destitute of one or the other, could
speak §f any oath º he has brought himself to swallow, in the sub-
joined language, which MR. Bowy ER is reported to have used in the
t debate on the Oaths Bill:—
“The Catholic oath was absurd and nugatory—far more absurd and nugatory
than Protestants supposed; because it attempted to force them to deny doctrines
and tenets which they did not deny. 1t was a mockery and a profanation.”
In reading the above, one is at first sight inclined to suppose that
the word “not” was inserted by a typographical mistake. An oath
which forced people to deny that which they did deny would be super-
fluous, and therefore nugatory and absurd enough : but an oath which
forces them to deny what they do not deny, forces them to swear
falsely. An oath which attempts to make them swear falsely, succeeds
if they take it; and if false swearing is absurd, it is not nugatory, but
a somewhat serious thing. That the above quoted words, however,
are all MR. Bowy ER's, and no typographical mistake, we are forced to
conclude by the context of his reported discourse:—
“MR. Bowy ER (in continuation) asked whether any Roman Catholic could in
honesty, or on his honour, be a party to imposing on members of his own or other
persuasions, an oath which denied one of the most fundamental doctrines of his
Church?”
What does this mean, if not that MR. Bowy ER accuses himself of
having, in taking his oath as a Member of Parliament, denied one of
the most fundamental doctrines of his Church? If he does not talk
mere nonsense, it is quite clear that the Roman Catholic Emancipation
Act is, as regards him, superfluous: no oath could have kept him out
of Parliament. How angry M.R. Bowy ER would have been with
that the accusation of disregarding oaths, and of taking them with
mental reservations, was a calumny upon Roman Catholics. What are
we to say now that we find them taking an oath, and complaining that
they cannot take it conscientiously? The mildest thing we can say is,
that all such Papists had better have the tonsure conferred on them in
having their heads close-shaved, and be shut up in a psychologico-
medical monastery.
THE DIWORCE BILL.
THE first case under the above law has been the Divorce, owing
to differences of temper as well as circulation, of the Morning
Herald and the sºa. The divorce is mensã et Tory. The
Standard is already wedded to Liberalism. The separation took place
even before the law had passed, but it was well known that the parties
in question were always in advance of their age. The property was not
very large, but it was equally divided. It is understood that the
Morning Herald still keeps possession of the “AMERICAN SEASER-
PENT,” whilst the Standard is to be allowed the exclusive run of the
“ENORMoUs GooseBERRY.” There was some dispute about the
“SHQWER of FROGs, but a division (or a difference rather), was
happily avoided by its being understood that the lot was to be split in
two—one half of the frogs to go to the Herald, and the other half to
fall to the Standard. One of the unhappy couple (the Old WoyAN
who lives in Shoe Lane, we believe) has been inconsolable ever since
the separation. In fact, she is not expected to recover.

Depth in a Deep Tragedy.
WITH what wonderful accuracy does Young Norval in the Scotch
tragedy, in the account which he, gives, of his, supposed parentage,
indicate the character of a Yankee dealer! He describes his father as
an individual “whose constant care was to increase his store.”

• SENSIBLE RIDING COSTUME FOR WARM WEATHER.
MR. PUNCH AND THE VICTORIA CROSS.
PERHAPs; no, we scorn a qualified expression, and begin again with-
Decidedly the most imposing ceremonial which has ever taken place in
a free or any other country, was exhibited to the eyes of the million,
on Friday, the 26th of June,1857, in Hyde Park, when and where HER
Most GRACIous MAJESTY was pleased to confer upon Mr. Punch
the Victoria Cross, or Order of R. in acknowledgment of many
years of gallant, daring, and faithful service to the Throne, the Altar,
and the Nation.
The day was fixed for Friday, because it fell within the week during
which MR. Punch is engaged in preparing the first number of a new
volume, and the QUEEN, with her usual kindly forethought, considered
that a Cartoon representing the event would be an appropriate opening
engraving. “Unless,” added HER MAJESTY, with a min }. expression
of archness and kindness, when settling the affair .# MR. PUNCH,
at the Palace, “unless you object to receiving an honour in the
same week with the Prince, whom I am just ordering to be prayed for
as Prince Consort.” It is needless to record Mr. Punch’s affectionately
loyal yet epigrammatically subtle response.
he ceremony was witnessed by exulting myriads, and therefore it
is not necessary to describe that which those myriads in a state of
frantic exultation at their good luck in witnessing such a scene, have
been ceaselessly narrating to everybody ever since. But the following
list, which comprises only a very few of the signal military and civil
services of Mr. Punch, should be treasured as a record in connection
with the glorious celebration of Friday. That immortal man was
decorated, (inter alia,)
For having in the most gallant manner, and single-handed, stormed the fortress
of Protection, and opened the gates to CoMMANDER. R. Cobden and the League.
For having protected the country when it was threatened by the Chartists, and
for having completely put down Chartism.
For having attacked the Post Office when in the hands of the Brigand GRAHAM,
and for having delivered the correspondence of the nation from that plunderer.
Fol having a second time attacked the Post Office, and handed it overto Rowland
: whereby the tremendous letter-tax was put down in favour of the present
system.
For having completely put down Repeal, and driven all Repealers out of Ireland.
For having destroyed the Welsh Toll Gates, and for being ready, and what is
more determined, to do the same by those of England.
For having charged into Capel Court, and routed out its nest of pirates, and for
having afterwards shot down all the wild stags that were so dangerous to society.
For having utterly defeated the Papal Aggressionists.
For having made War upon Russia, and for having finally humiliated her, and
compelled her to sign a Treaty.
For having smashed the ALBERT hat.
For having repulsed intended invasions by France and America.
For having overthrown the timid Ministry of Lord John Russell.
For having overthrown the foolish Ministry of Lord DERby.
For having overthrown the un-English Ministry of Lord ABERDEEN.
For having made Lord PALMERStos, Minister of England, and pledged him to
Reform.
For having put down the Sabbatarians, and for having secured rational liberty to
the millions in respect to Sunday observance.
For having created the Great Exhibition of 1851.
For having built and christened the Crystal Palace.
For having compelled the Government to reduce the Income-Tax.
For having suggested every reform and improvement which have been effected in
the world since July 1841, and for intending to pursue the same course as long as
the world requires any amendment whatever.
[The list to be continued through many numbers.
THE CANTERBURY CASINO.
A NoTICE exhibited on Norwood Common, near the Ørystal Palace,
informs the public that the “eligible” circumjacent “land” is “to
let on lease for building purposes: Title from the ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY.” This is supposed to be a device of the present occu-
pant of the land—the keeper of two temporary wood and canyas
structures thereon standing; the one, a refreshment booth, and the
other a sixpenny dancing ditto. His §§ is presumed to be to pro-
cure for those establishments a respectability which, we are informed,
does not exactly obtrude itself upon the perception of their visitor.
That a cheap Casino can really be held under the A.” IS
incredible; for what are Sunday bands, shocking as he deems them,
compared to a sixpenny hop on any day of the week?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IMPERFECTION OF THE YANKEE TONGUE:
THE New York Times, whilst glorying in the general inventive powers
of Americans, deplores their national deficiency, in he faculty of
inventing names for places. “ Brownsville,”, “ Tomkinsville,”
“M'Grawlersville,” are instanced by our New York contemporary as
specimens of the inelegant, and inexpressive, designations which the
ioneers of Yankee civilization are in the habit of allotting to newly
ounded towns and cities, whilst “Milwaukee’’ is described as *
a.
beautiful name.” There is certainly a difference between ‘’Mil:
waukee,” and “Brownsville,” together, with the congeneric villes”
of ToMkINs and M'GRAw1.BR, but it is not so much the difference
between beautiful and ugly, as a difference º: to that
which exists, or may be conceived to exist, testhetically, between the
settlers, M'GRAwLER, TOMKINs, and BROWN on the one hand, and
the aboriginal BLACK HAwk on the other. The euphony, of “Mil-
waukee’’ is very analogous to that of “Hokey Pokey.” There is a
sort of native sweetness in the sound of either name; a sweetness
savouring of natives who tattoo their cheeks, and paint their noses red
and sky-blue. If the Americans want names of that sort for their
new settlements, they might readily obtain them. To a sane adult it
might not, perhaps, be a very becoming mental exercise to invent such
denominations; but plenty of them might be procured from any
nursery, the occupants of which are able to talk; or from any lunatic
asylum whose inmates are not deaf and dumb. The invention of funny
names like “Milwaukee,” would be an innocent amusement for infants,
and a very suitable employment for the insane, serving in some degree
to utilise those unfortunate beings. --- - - - -
Nothing is so easy as gibberish to anybody who will give his mind
to it, provided that mind is º: or disordered. It is strange
that a people so fertile as our Transatlantic kinsmen in the production
of odd words in general should be so slow as § appear to be at
local nomenclature. How the nation that has added “catawampous,”
“slockdologer,” “stampede,” and “bogus,” to the English dictionary
can be at . for terms, racy of the soil, to apply to any portion of
it, is difficult to conceive. Can it be a hard matter for those who call
each other “hard-shells,” “soft-shells,” “hunkers,” “locofocos,”
“border-ruffians,” and “barn-burners,”, to call any number of places
names * Even if they cannot by matural means accomplish the task of
naming new locations, they might avail themselves of the assistance
of spirit-rapping mediums, through whom, doubtless, they could get
rapped out §, of words that would answer the purpose at least as
well as “Milwaukee”—words original as to orthography, and of
unknown meaning.

HOMAGE TO MARSEILLES.
MR. PUNCH seldom wastes his criticism on farces, and has no par-
ticular remark to offer on the French elections. But he conceives it
but knightly courtesy to tender his congratulations for witty M. TAXILE
DELoRD, of the Charivari, on his providential escape, by the Marseilles
vote, from a seat in such a chamber as the

Pº
r^
SURVEY OF A LADY'S DRESS,
GREAT disputes have arisen among engineers and scientific gentle.
men as to the particular scale that should be adopted in taking the
survey of a fashionable lady's dress. LoRD Elcho advocates the
adoption of a scale of twenty-five inches to the mile. This, he says,
would give a careful representation of all the lengths and breadths of
a lady's dress. The flounces would be put down to a nicety: every one
of the colºns would be carefully indicated; not a piece of guipure, or
a single ribbon would be omitted. On the other side, it is argued that
the plans taken on that large scale would be so cumbersomely com.
prehensive, and so extremely inconvenient for all purposes of reference,
that a person wishing to consult the survey, '...} be compelled to
take it out with him to Hampstead Heath or Wormwood Scrubbs, or
some monster open space, before he could unfold it. These objections
are met boldly and openly by his Lordship. He asks what necessity
is there that all the plans should be taken on the same sheet
of paper? He does not see why the survey could not be taken
on a series of small maps, instead of one large one or what there is
to prevent you binding up the maps, according to their anatomical
progression, in one uniform volume, which might be bound in a
º of the very dress that was mapped inside? Each part should
e complete in itself. You would have your two arms, your waist,
your right side, your left side, your first flounce, your second ditto,
º ºil. and so on ad acternum, until the whole survey was com:
pleted.
SIR. Rod ERICK MURCHISON is of opinion that a one-inch scale
would answer all necessary purposes. It would be useless and extra-
vagant, he contends, considering the many countless yards of waste
stuff, to take any map larger than that of one inch. If milliners for
their own personal requirements wanted a larger map, let them take
it at their own expense. For the use of the husband the millimer's bill
was all that was sufficient. It usually gave all the particulars; and, if
there was any doubt, the sum total mostly removed it. The price was
put down, and it was no very difficult, matter from that to estimate
the quantity; though the husbands, whose credit was, owing to the
extravagance of their wives’ milliners’ bills, being killed by inches,
cared generally but little about the precise number. The subject was
one which was not often surveyed by the husband with any degree of
pleasure; and probably the less he saw of the extent to which his
wife carried her follies, the better, he was pleased. Under these
circumstances he thought a half-inch scale would abundantly satisfy
all rational purposes. The matter was still under warm dispute
(92” Fahrenheit) when we went to press.
FREEDOMS OF THE PRESS.
WITH the suppression merely of the names, we quote verbatim this
interesting paragraph from the Paris correspondence of a fashionable
contemporary:-
“The rising belles of the day are the MDLLEs. –, the daughters of — —.
The elder, a striking brunette of sixteen, has made her début with considerable eclot
at the Tuileries: the second, a charming blonde, a year younger, has only as yet
appeared at the Italian opera, but has already attracted much admiration by her
delicate and somewhat pensive beauty.”
We have heard some writers praised, for their originality of subject,
and we have known others lauded for the freedom of their style; but
although there is undoubted novelty in thus dragging private ladies
out in public print, and describing their “good points” with much
the manner of a slave-dealer, we think the writer deserves rather to be
kicked than commended for his freedom. Of course, when an actress
makes her début, she must expect to see some comments on her person
in the papers; but it is a new idea to us to find the audience thus
criticised as well as the performers, and we should certainly give up

“This social punishment—the public dinner—is, I believe, peculiar
to this island. An attempt was e to introduce it into France,
which ended, as might have been expected, in a revolution. Yes—the
Provisional Government of 1848 was installed in consequence of the
}. dinners—‘les Banquets,’ as they were called—organised by the
arliamentary Reformers of Paris. You may tell me the revolution
broke out because the ºl. dinners were not allowed to take Fº
I will not quibble with you about a word of three letters. But I
know, how history is written; and I know—do I not know?—the
miseries of a public dinner.
“You admit a connection between the public dinner and the Revo-
lution of 1848. Very well, them. I assume that the French are at
once a social and a gastronomic race. I can understand such a race
rising as one man against the attempt to thrust a public dinner down
their throats. But I cannot imagine their upsetting the Government
which protected them from the infliction.. I go on probabilities, which
to me are proofs, for they rest upon the eternal nature of things.
I still believe the rising of Paris in 1848 was against, the º:
to introduce the punishment of the public dinner, and that, in the
confusion, the Provisional Government somehow got flung to the
surface, and staid there till further orders.
“Prisoners, under tyranny and long-continued torture, have some-
times risen, brained their gaolers with their handcuffs, and either
broken prison, or been shot down, sullenly, in unappeased revolt.

There are few things sadder than to see a prisoner insensible to his
shame, ...To hear join Bull. talk, you wºuli imagine he looked upon
the public dinner as a privilege and not as a punishment.
“‘We English’—he will tell some poor, eagerly-assenting, smiling,

“I look on the introduction of the public dinner into any country
where it is unknown, in much the same light as I should the extension
to our criminal system of these penal refinements of the Celestial Empire.
When I hear a brother BULL cramming such statements as are above
written into foreign ears, I blush for my species.
“For whatever outward submission there may be amongst ourselves,
I know, that I never mention the public dinner to an Englishman
singly, but I find him, like myself, glowing with impatient disgust of
that infliction, and ready to join in any attempt to put it down. Unless
indeed he happen, at the moment, to have been sentenced as a Steward
with the aggravation of a list to make up—added, as they add private
. to a term of imprisonment, sometimes—or—still worse—
condemned to the Chair, with hard labour at the toasts. In such
cases, instead of responding to one’s own impatience, men will en-
deavour to draw one on into participation in their punishment—as
convicts are always found anxious to do.
“But with foreigners it is not uncommon to hear the tone taken
which I have described above.
“Now the man who talks thus, knows as well as you or I, that it is
all humbug; that there is no sociality in the public dinner; no real
kindliness of heart engendered by it; nowholesome and blessed charity
set flowing by its aid; that the speeches spoken at it are tissues of
gross and fulsome flattery; that its enthusiasm is as evanescent, and
spurious as the beadin'its gooseberry champagne; that its brotherhood
is maudlin ; its philanthropy a sham; its music, generally, the grossest
form of the art; its cookery and its wine, frequently abominable;
its talk either stammering, incoherent imbecility, or fluent balderdash.
In short, if I were asked to sum into the briefest expression the
spirit of the Public Dinner, I know of no better words than ‘Sham’
and ‘SNoBBISHNEss.’”
UNCONTROLLABLE BEINGS.
AN Hon. Member, whose name we are sorry our memory cannot
catch, said on the debate relating to the expense and non-completion
(both being equally endless) of the Houses . Parliament:—
“It was difficult at any time to control an architect, but SIR CHARLEs BARRY
exceeded in this peculiarity every other member of his profession "
Parliament must be weak, indeed, when it can no longer control its
expenditure. Is SIR CHARLEs such a very uncontrollable being that
there are no powers that will touch him? The best plan of control
we fancy, is to stop the supplies. If SIR CHARLEs had not been aid
anything until ;H. were finished, we have an idea that their
completion would have been celebrated with a dinner and a title years
ago. An architect has been compared to the dry-rot—once inside the
house, the one is as difficult as the other to get out again. But when
you keep paying your architect-at first, it is a fixed sum; then he is
to have three percent.; next his commission is enlarged to four per
cent.; and after that he is to receive an additional sum for casualties
—so long as these payments go on, it seems to us that you hit upon
the very best form of invitation to induce him to remain inside your
ouse. As long as you feed him with means, so long will he go on
building “like bricks.” SIR RoBERT PEEL could not state the case
plainer. But stop the supplies—not one penny more until all the
‘work, is, done—and we have a shrewd suspicion that you will very
quickly bring SIR CHARLEs BARRY under the most plastic control.

oRE than ten thousand sighs were
breathed by ladies who came down
by railway, in their regret that trains
could not yet be run into St. James's
Palace as easily and safely as they
were into the Crystal Palace.
No less than nineteen hundred
nervous people took beforehand the
precaution to stuff cotton in their
ears, for fear their drums might be
deafened by the beating of the big
- - One.
Fifty-five Teetotallers were de-
tected drinking .. in the pauses of performance,
seventeen of whom had the presence of mind to
allege as their excuse, that Sherry, was the only
liquid handed round to them, and eleven of these
ded, to extenuate themselves further, that such
was their excited state, it tasted just like water.
Sixteen most unsentimental gentlemen were in-
duced by contemplation of the crowds at the re-
- freshment counters, to remark, that if music be the
foºd of love, it seemed plainly inducive of the love of food.
Three-and-twenty waiters were threatened with dismissal by the
careful MR. STAPLEs, because during the performance their shoes were
heard to creak. - -
. Exactly two thousand and twelve country cousins were facetiously
informed by their London relations of the fact that the great tanks
which they saw upon the water towers were filled with ale and stout
for the consumption, of the chorus; and learnt also from the same
reliable authorities, that the sandwiches were cut and mustarded by
steam, and that the contract to supply them had been let out by the
acre.
No less than ninety-nine ladies would have fainted with the heat,
but that they would thereby have missed some of the music.
Above five hundred habitués of both London and provincial Concerts
noblyMº. their gratuitous services to the Committee, to act as
Special Constables for the preservation of the peace, and to prevent it
being broken by the swindlers of encores. - -
Nearly forty thousand hopes were expressed, either during or after
the performances, that their success might be such as to ensure their
repetition, and that the hopers might have all their absent friends then
present with them. - -
Thirteen strict Vegetarians have since privately confessed in confi-
dential conversation, that they were reduced by the exigencies of their
appetite to eat of lobster j without picking out the lobster.
recisely six hundred and sixty-six engaged couples skilfully con:
trived to get separated from their party almost directly at the close of
the performance, and when stumbled upon afterwards (of course in the
remotest corner of the grounds), eleven-twelfths of them exclaimed
“Q, we’ve been hunting for you º: y” -
Seventeen wags connected with the press were so charmed with
MR. SECRETARY GRove's plain-spokenness, that they declared, what-
ever were his family, he clearly was not one of the Groves of Blarney.
—(N.B. This is intended for a great compliment, MR. GROVE.
Upwards of twelve thousand pairs of gloves were split, an º
nineteen hundred hats were beaten in at the conclusion of the Festival,
in the excitement of the cheer which was raised for MR. Costa.
Over the sunshine of the pleasure of the forty thousand listeners
there was thrown with all but three of them a shadow of regret that
HANDEL had not lived to hear his music done such justice to as they
felt quite sure it never had before been.

work, and won all the battles!

CARDINAL WIALE-PRELA is literally “clothing the naked” at Bo:
logna-only it is the statues, instead of the paupers. This is considered
quite a characteristic act of Prela-tic charity, illustrating the only form
in which that virtue can at this moment be said to be included among
the Cardinal ones at all.

HEN CUCKOOS.
Useful lessons may in some cases be learned from the
Inferior creatures, but some of them set bad examples.
The Cuckoo, for instance, sets an example which ought to
be avoided, and not imitated, by mothers. The Cuckoo
puts out its eggs to hatch, and consequently its young to
rear, by another bird; and this conduct is cº, with a
difference for the worse, by ladies who put their children
out to wet-nurse, or who have them wet-nursed at all.
The Monthly Paper of the London Society for the Protection
% Young. Females contains a few sensible “Words to
others,” of which the intention is to show in what
manner the practice of wet-nursing interferes with the
object of that Society. They briefly demonstrate that the
practice in question is one of the causes, of our greatest
social evil. The writer makes the following emphatic
remark:—
“I will point to the custom of hiring wet-nurses as a great evil in this
direction, considering that a certain class of young women are gene-
rally preferred for that office. A barrier is thus removed which might
have stayed their downfal. I mean the loss of character and service.”
The only proper persons for wet-nurses are young
mothers who have lost their own infants. The number of
these is sufficient to meet the natural demand for hired
mothers. The demand that produces a greater supply pro-
duces a bad supply. If the hireling is a socially respect-
able person, her employment to nourish the child of
another involves a wrong to her own. The baby of the
wet-nurse is starved, as the young hedge-sparrow is thrown
over. But there are other reasons why ladies should eschew
cuckooism. The grub, or worm, which the hedge-sparrow

bolt, and once more a proud and haughty institution goes to the
ground before the stroke of JUPITER BEERIUs. A person of the name
of “John, WICKERs of Southwark,” has been blackballed, at the
Reform, Club, and he instantly writes off in fury to the Advertiser
(after the manner of gentlemen, when their desire to join a society of
other gentlemen is for the moment ungratified), proclaiming the fact,
and declaring that he owes his rejection to the fact, that he is a
Protestant, who has been, sacrificed to the bigotry of the Roman
Catholic members of the Club. The Editor immediately takes up the
cause of John WIcKERs of Southwark, and between them, and in
laº; editorial type, they chant a fiery duet. ` º
ICKERS declares that he is defeated by “that un-English system,
the ballot.” The Editor, forgetting that the paper goes in for the
ballot-box, endorses the º aint. WICKERS demands, “whether an
English gentleman is to suffer for being a liberal?” No, says the
Editor, and we will have “a new Reform Club, really representing the
views of the liberals, and expressly excluding Roman Catholics from
membership.” &Tii put down a hundred guineas,” says WICKERs.
“That is a princely P. donation.” says the Editor. “Let not
the hateful name of blackballing be heard within our walls,” says
VICKERs. “The system has been carried to such an extent that men
of sensitive feelings have latterly shrunk from allowing their names to
be, put up,” says that Editor. “I’ll come to any meeting on the
Subject,”, says WICKERS., “Your manly, well-timed, and courageous
letter will do great good,” says the Editor. ...And so they go on agree-
ing, with a sweetness and brotherly accord that quite brings the tears
into one’s eyes.
There are only two little points that occur to Mr.'Punch in reference
tº this afflicting matter. . Somehow, we find it difficult to believe with
WICKERs that he was rejected because he was a Protestant, or with
the Editor, that “no man who has identified himself with the cause of
Protestantism has the slightest chance of election.”

In the Lords the EARL OF DONoUGHMORE made grievous grumblin
about a smart article published by the Eraminer, touching an }.
bishop called LORD PLUNKETT, who had opposed the Ministers' Momey
Abolition Bill. The Earl wanted the publisher called to the bar.
LORD GRAN VILLE, on behalf of Government, opposed such a process,
and said that the motion of the noble lord “would involve the House
in proceedings that might be endless, and that THE LORDs would
FIND THEMSELVES IN A PERMANENT CONFLICT WITH THAT VERY
AMUSING PUBLICATION, Punch.” The general good sense of the Lord
President induces Mr. Punch, to overlook the levity with which his
lordship alluded to the possibility of the most awful collision con-
ceivable in British history. As for the conflict being permanent, it
would be about as permanent as a conflict between a locomotive
engine, running sixty miles per hour, and a string of empty trucks
upon the line. Were Mr. Punch but to declare his intention of making
war upon the Lords, the Times would again come out with the single
sentence that did duty for a leading article when their lordships rejected

trodden out by the Peers in all indignation and some little terror.
In the Commons there was a discussion whether the Government
ought to job with the funds of the Savings' Banks, and there was also a
somewhatamusing debate on the vote of about £50,000 for the Department
of Science and Art, in the course of which the new museum in Brompton
ilers was rather unceremoniously handled. There is no doubt,
though miscellaneous collection, and its
being open to the working classes on two evenings in the week is an
excellent feature in the arrangement. The Election Petitions Bill,
intended to prevent some of the trickery which enriches Parliamentary
agents, and scandalises everybody else, was read a second time, but
will be marvellously manipulated before it is allowed to pass.
Tuesday, France has a scheme for supplying the deficiency of negro
labour in the French colonies by the importation of free negroes, and

inconsistent with the lan itself of that very

the Bill, there is no choice for Oxon and SARUM

think that he is more likely to resign than Oxon

that he meant to bring in a Bill on the Registration of Titles, but it

a very mild and harmless style of legislation, and one on which SIR

the Bishop of ExETER to treat the subject of Divorce. ... -
MR. HENRY BERKELEY then brought on his Ballot motion, offering
to withdraw it if Government would promise that the bailot should be
art of the new Reform Bill. The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER
egan a reply by saying, “If my hon, friend is really serious—" and
as this was rightly supposed to be the exordium of an anti-ballot
speech, MR. BERKELEY went on. Later, SIR GEORGE, at greater
length, intimated that;Government did not believe in the ballot, and
LoRD JoHN Russell, suspected of having a private Reform Bill about
him, hastened also to declare his antipathy to secret voting. On

unhappy civil servant who dies in harness, of every shilling he has been
forced to contribute to the fund, unless he has reached the precise old
age at which his allowance begins; a system which is also in other
ways most unfair and oppressive to the enormous body of talented and
valuable men who do the work of the country. SIR. G., LEWIs

ications.
In the Commons, MR. Lock E. KING endeavoured to bring to an
untimely end the Statute Law Commission, which really seems to be
almost upon the point of approaching a period, when it, may look
forward, at some future time, to discovering a means by which,
eventually progress may be º towards suggestions for deve.
loping a plan for consolidating the law. Remote as the chance may be,
the House thought it ought not to be destroyed. A discussion on the
plans for the Public Offices elicited a statement from SIR. B. HALL
that some scheme for purifying the Thames was being matured. The
British Museum grant was taken, and high honour was done to
MR. PANIzzi for having originated, and MR. SyſIRKE for having
carried out, the new Reading Room, of which, Mr. Punch will only say
that it is an apartment almost worthy to be his own private library
and then an acrimonious and diverting discussion arose on the National
Gallery Grant, terminated by LoRD PALMERSTON giving the House an
exceedingly good wigging, contrasting its meanness with the generosity
of the Manchester men, from whose Art-Treasury he had just come
mp. The House was rebuked, and dutifully voted the sums demanded

º the Sover EIGN is to have the abstract right, the MAYoR is to
have the actual mud, and the profits are to be divided, a third to go to
the Crown, and the rest to be expended by the City in embanking and
improving the river. A pleasing little incident showed the .
of the House, and how easily it is amused. MR. WILsoN, having to
answer a question upon a subject of importance, rose, taking off his
hat, as usual. He might have previously torn up some letter, and a
few of the scraps had º in his hat, or he might have been
jº. in some amateur performance in which there was a snow-storm,
and fragments of the paper snow had stuck in his hair. Anyhow, there
were some bits of paper, and the intellectual House of Commons was
so delighted that it roared in such a way as to render his reply
inaudible. The House voted a good deal of money for harbours of refuge,
consuls, and similar protective institutions, and the good humour of
the evening was further promoted by a very good spar between Lord
PALMERston and MR. WHITESIDE, in which the neat but audacious
style of fighting of the Wiscount contrasted well with the viciously
meant, but blundering blows of the Irishman. PAM suggested that
WHITESIDE knew nothing, and WHITESIDE retorted that PAM pre-
tended to know everything. PAM complimented WHITESIDE on his
power of invention, and WHITEs DE scoffed at PAM for his power of
evasion. PAM urged that, before speaking on any subject, WHITESIDE
should try to understand it, and WHITEsi DE declined to admit that
PAM in i. least understood even the question upon which he was
addressing the House. The point at issue was whether a charge in
the estimates, for Chinese interpreters, was justifiable. Of course,
when the fight was done, everybody agreed that there was nothing to
fight about.
THE IRISH BLESSING FROM THE ALTAR.
Holy FATHER O’BLARNEY he stood at the altar,
And delivered this sermon to DENNIs O'BRogue:—
Arrah, DENNIs, ye thief! your desarts is the halter,
Ye desarve to be hanged, I say, DENNIs, ye rogue.
I’ll larn ye to vote for a heretic thraitor,
Disobeying the holy commands of your praste,
I’ll spake the bad word for your sowl to St. PATER,
He shall slam Hiven's door in your foul face, ye baste.
I declare if the divil himself—may he fetch ye –
Was to rise up just now out of this holy spot,
And to ask for my vote, rather he, than the wretch ye
Sowld your mane dirty sowl to, should have it, ye sot.
Whoever gives DENNIs a cup of cowld wather—
Let alone the potheen—mate or dhrink, bite or sup,
He will be of his own endless ruin the author;
The earth will gape open and swallow him up.
Cursed be DENNIs O'BROGUE in his going and coming,
In undressing himself, and in putting on clothes,
In spache and in silence, in whistling and humming,
In scratching his head and in blowing his nose.
In waking or sleeping, in ating and dhrinking,
In snuffing, in chewing, or smoking a pipe,
In buying and selling, in nodding and winking.
May his praties all rot if they get to be ripe'
In dancing or kneeling, in standing or sitting
May that DENNIs O'BRogue, that big blackguard, be cursed!
In his breathing, and coughing, and sneezing, and ºriting
May the vagabond's portion be hunger and thirst!
In smiling and sighing, in laughing and crying,
May the curse of the Saints upon DENNIS be hurled!
In swearing and lying, in living and dying,
Och, bad luck to ye, DENNIs, ye thief of the world !
Unfounded Alarm.
HERE is another illustration of the old truism, how “Conscience
makes cowards of us all.” One of the Directors of the British Bank,
who is still at large, was going into the SHEEPSHANKS' Collection, at
the South Kensington Museum, when he overheard an artist say that
there were “six Constables in the room.”. He instantly took alarm,
and ran away as fast as he could. In fact, like one of his own bills, we
believe he has not stopped running yet.

THE OLD PRINTER’S HAVEN.
HE enjoyment of the intellectual
pleasure afforded by these and
other *::: is greatly enhanced
by the beauty and clearness of
the type which is the vehicle for
the conveyance of our profound
poetical, and facetious ideas, an
the like ideas of some of our con-
temporaries and predecessors, to
the human mind. Wit, wisdom,
imagination,become reading made
easy by means of fine and legible
print. The mental feast is served
= in porcelain and silver: the intel-
* lectual venison, and turtle-soup
are dished up in precious china
and choice plate. The green fat
is rendered refreshing even to
- the eye, and the sense of sight
itself is gratified by the graces of Alderman's Walk..., Native humour
has imparted to it a visual charm like that which the native oyster
acquires by being elegantly scalloped., The art, however, which makes
literary things pleasant to the eye of the reader, is unfortunately apt
to wear out that of the artist, and the gratification afforded by nice
typography is purchased by the amaurosis of pressmen, and the cataract
of compositors. Some working Printers, moreover, as well as some
other º: live to be old and infirm, and few who do attain to old
age have been able to provide for that contingency. Either their wages
have been insufficient for any such provision; or if they have, in
themselves, barely sufficed for some such, the Income-Tax, under
Schedule D, has run away with the savings which they might have
invested to that end by dint of extreme parsimony.
What fate, then, awaits the poor old Printer, who is too much of a
Christian to commit suicide, and who probably cannot see his way to
do so if he would? Not, necessarily, the punishment of the Work-
house—that punishment, of which, as of capital punishment, the object
is simply example. No : the doom of the Workhouse; the condem-
nation of the pauper, condemned to imprisonment and degradation for
not having saved the money which he has been unable to save, is not
the inevitable lot of superannuated working Printers. There exists a
charitable, and not a º receptacle for them, or rather a number of
receptacles, called the PRINTERs' ALMsHouses: an assemblage of
comfortable abodes or asylums for deserving workmen past work.
The Sixteenth Annual Report of the Committee of the PRINTERs'
ALMsHous E SocIETY, has lately been published: and from this docu-
ment it will be seen that the Society is making the most, for the comfort
and accommodation of the Inmates, of very moderate means. . For
instance, the Committee reports the circumstance that a pump is in
course of erection for the supply of the Institution from an Artesian
well; whence will be effected an economy in the article of water.
This shows that economy is practised in every element of expenditure,
even in the pure element, if Chemistry will pardon the expression.
We will now quote as much of the Report as it is necessary to quote—
the portion of a sentence:-
“Our List of Annual Subscribers is not so large as could be wished.”
All persons addicted to the practice of charity are invited to con-
sider whether the above, brief statement may not suggest to them a
. for indulging their º; propensity. To any wealthy indi-
vidual who has never tried the luxury of feeding the hungry, and
clothing the naked, the PRINTERs' ALMsHouses may be recommended
as affording a good case for a first experiment. This may be performed
by sending the Society any amount of money, which will be received
with rapture by the Treasurer, Trustees, Secretary, any Member of
the Committee, or the Collector, MR. C. Pope, 14, Derby Street,

With that stress on the dotted “u” which makes the name rhyme to

And that all one can say of his blunders is, the worst is always the latest.
That his presence drives up art-treasures, as a hot hand does a ther-

To a price beyond all measures, save of John BULL's purse-pedometer.
And º when he comes in a place he’s straight sucked in the

And from old daubs in old shops you may hear some such midnight

So he closes his disquisition, with a peroration of stricture
Upon our last acquisition, the fourteen-thousand pound picture:

Boldly describes the pleasure he has had from that Veronese.
And, for further satisfaction, calls our more artistic CHANCELLOR,
To declare that of “this ’’ transaction the House ought not to be

And so the House comes to a vote on the Gem of the Casa-Pisani,
Warnished, henceforth, with a coat of double official blarney. -
But Punch holds to PAM’s conclusion, that the Commons don’t do
themselves credit,
By this sort of art-discussion, or the speeches of those who led it :
And makes bold to consider it placed beyond doubt that SIR CHARLEs

IT appears that a sort of controversy is Yº: in the Jewish
Chronicle, on the subject of Proselytism to the Jewish faith, the
members of which are accused of rather giving the cold shoulder to a
convert. An idiot, who writes to proclaim that he was converted to
Judaism, eighteen years ago at Rotterdam, (after Scheidam, we sup-
pose,) alle es, however, that he has been very kindly treated. . More
eese the Rotterdam Hebrews. We consider that the Jews, in dis-
iking converts, from Christianity, are quite right. A man, may not
choose to alter his habits so far as to travel by railroad, light his candle
with a lucifer, or read Punch; but he must feel the utmost contempt
for another man, who, having known and tried those improvements,
falls back on the old coach, tinder-box, and Morning Herald. A real
convert to Judaism is almost an impossibility, but we are happy to sa

On instructional depot!
Fort William—just fancy!
In Scotland—far away!
They might just as well send fellows
At once to Botany Bay.
If they’d let one take a moor, now,
It wouldn't be so bad– , ,
But bless you, leave for stalking
Or shooting, can’t be had.
I asked that stiff old fogey,
(Such a muff) our Major, STERN,
And what do you think his answer?
“Sir, you are here to learn l’’
So one’s drilled and schooled and hum-
ugged,
And if one tries to shirk,.
There’s SIR COLIN down upon one,
As savage as a Turk.
And when one’s done with Depot,
And expects to have one's play,
One’s ...i off to musketry,
At Hythe with Colonel HAY.
When with that—hem l—Enfield rifle,
One must practise till, at nights,
Instead of ...i. ',
One keeps on taking sights.
I didn’t join the Army,
For this sort of life at all-, .
But for dress and lush, and larking,
And the other style of ball.
But as for togs—they tell us
We're to dress for use, not show !
There’s no end of row, in mufti
If a fellow dares to go.
And in short they mean to swamp us
With snobs, that’s very plain;
For they’ve cut down the messes
To two bob, and no champagne /
They seem to think an officer
Is not for show but use:
In fact, it’s clear the Army
Is going to the Deuce!
What we may Expect.
THE Coming Comet has gone in search of the
Coming Man. As soon as they meet, it is
expected they will visit the Earth together-
the Coming Man on the back of the Coming
Comet! This twin-phenomenon, this double
“blaze of triumph,” will amply atone, it is to
be hoped, for any little disappointment, that the
sanguine and superstitious may have felt at their
late shortcomings.

* BOTHER THE NASTY FLIES : *
REVIEW.
The Director's Own Cookery Book: containing plain and practical direc-
tions in the Art of Cookery, as applied especially to Joint Stock
Companies’ Accounts. London: Sw1NDLE & ScAMP, Seven Dials.
To traders of exhausted credit, and gentlemen who have more time
than money on their hands, this would doubtless prove a highly service.
able work, were it not for the prevention, we shall presently allude to.
In addition to containing many hundreds of recipes for the culinary
treatment of the cash-books of a company, it is furnished with a
copious preliminary, treatise on the rise and progress of the Art of
Dishing, as applied, both to shareholders and to the public generally;
º with full details of the most approved and recent methods
which have been employed in dressing up and garnishing Reports. It
contains also much useful information on points connected with the
general management of the cuisine, giving some most serviceable hints
to the chefs of the establishment as to how, by the judicious employ:
ment of catspaws, they may contrive to get through a great amount of
dirty work, and yet succeed in coming out of it with tolerably clean
hands, and leaving very little stain upon their private reputation,
Perhaps, however, we shall best acquaint our readers with the
character of the work by citing a few passages by way of sample of its
Imerits :-
“To dish a Shareholder.—In order to do this, you must first catch your Share-
holder: an operation which requires a somewhat skilful .# although it is by
no means attended with much difficulty. It may be generally effected by throwing
out some catchlines by way of a prospectus, and the bait of a good dividend is pretty
sure to prove a taking one. As soon as you have caught your Shareholder, the
process of dishing him becomes extremely simple. The best thing for the purpose
is what in chemistry is known as an evaporating dish, by which, as soon as you
have done your Shareholder quite brown, you can evaporate yourself, and leave him
Licely dished.”
“To Cook a Dividend.—When your profits have been less than usual, declare a
| larger dividend, and cook it out of capital. Garnish it in your Report with flum-
| rºlery and soft sawder: and of course take care, first of all, to help yourself. As the
pious CAMERoN was wont to quote, Heaven will help him who helps himself.”
“Recipe for making Royal British Stew.—The stew in this case does not differ much
from Irish stew : such as was invented by the chefs of the Tipperary Bank. With
the way of .#
it every one who reads the newspapers, and even those who
ike Sir Richard
ETHELL) don't, must have long ago become so very familiar that
t would be superfluous to publish the recipe. It is thought, however, there will
soon be some ºliº. to the stew, and that some of the head cooks may find them-
selves in it. There is little doubt at any rate that they will be well roasted when
they are put before the fire of the Attorney-GENERAL's address."
** Bubble and .—This is too-well known a dish to need much explanation.
All you have to do is to make the Bubble Company, and leave the Shareholders
thereof to make the squeak. This they will be sure to do when they are done to
rags, or in less culinary language, when they find they have been done by you and
brought thereby to rags and ruin.”
It will be observed from these few extracts that the work under
reviewal is only suited to those chefs who are accustomed not to mince
matters, and whose cookery is what one might expect from a thieves'
kitchen. . This being the case, we should #. certainly seen reason
that the book should be suppressed, but that we i. few will be
inclined to take a leaf from it, now that all such cookery, it is intended,
shall be dealt with as a criminal offence.
The book we see is dedicated “with the profoundest respect” to
MR. INNES CAMERON, to whom the author, in his preface, states that
he is indebted for considerable assistance in the compilation of the
work. This we can in no way feel surprise to learn, for we have had
sufficient proof of MR. CAMERON's ability, dis layed in nearly all the
* of account-cooking, to regard him as being a top-Soy ER in
© art.
DNION AMONG BIGOTS.
(To the Mawuworms of England).
MY DEAR FANATICs,
THE saying that two of a trade can never agree, has too long
been illustrated by two classes of enthusiasts: yourselves, and the
rabid portion of the Roman Catholics. Now kiss and be friends : and
for good reason why #. should fraternize, read the subjoined edifying
account, extracted from the Times, of the late proceedings of the
CARDINAL WIALE PRELA, ARCHBishop of BoLog NA:—
“His Eminence has ordered that a portion of the statue Gigante di Piazza shall
be covered to avoid scandal. This statue was the work of John, or BologNA, and
had remained uncovered for many years. The same regulation has been enforced
with respect to all the puttini, so much admired in the churches of Bologna. The
Cardinal has forbidden any more, singing in the churches. By this measure, the
chapel of St. Petrona, so renowned for its vocal music, will be deprived of its cele-
brity. All servile work is strictly forbidden on º and holidays, and should
any person be found in the streets carrying the smallest parcel, the police have
orders to arrest him, and force him to pay a heavy fine.”
Here, my ºil. friends, you have a Popish Archbishop and a
Cardinal to boot, actually putting statues into shorts and longclothes,
and stopping profane singing in churches. Of course he has not
altogether prohibited singing, but only that species of vocal music
that excites other emotions than those of gloom and melancholy. He
cannot have forbidden priests to sing through their noses, and he has
in all probability allowed choristers to continue to assist them in that
melodious exercise. The sacred music, therefore, in the churches of
Bologna, is probably as dull and slow, if it is not as ludicrous, as the
majority of your own devotional tunes. But what will still more
recommend—may I not say endear?—the holy Cardinal to you, is the
circumstance that he has forbidden all servile work on Sundays.
That is to say, he has forbidden cookery; and the Bologna people
must, consequently, content themselves with cold dinners on the
Sabbath. Better still, a fine is enforced for the offence of carrying a
W. in the streets on that day; so that, in point of fact, CARDINAL
IALE PRELA is as thoroughgoing a Sabbatarian as you would like
to see invested with despotic authority for every Sunday over the
British public. - -
In the meanwhile, you have English and Irish Roman Catholics at
home combining with yourselves in the endeavour to exclude the Jews
from Parliament. In view of the attitude now openly taken by their
priesthood all over the Continent, they see that it is idle to pretend
any longer to be the friends and champions of religious liberty. They
are fast coming to an agreement with you in essentials—that is to say
in the essentials of fanaticism: in bigotry, intolerance, the love of
domination, and the anxiety to incommode and annoy the public.
Being thus practically of one accord, you and they may as well cease
to contend about speculative trifles, and no longer suffer your little
differences of opinion concerning truth or falsehood to stand in the
way of your friendship. Put your horses—or donkeys—together, and
unite in endeavouring to make yourselves as troublesome as possible,
and in actually making yourselves exceedingly ridiculous—for the
love of 33&H$2C#.
P.S. The Divorce, Bill affords you a nice bit of common ground,
and I rejoice to see that the asses of your respective breeds meet on
that common.

THE MEDICAL PROTECTION BILL.
ConsiderABLE fear, is entertained by the several medical. º that º
MR. HEADLAM’s Medical, Bill has passed its second reading by a large majority, he
will not be able to get it through Committee this session. They may, however, be thankful
that LoRD ELcho's was withdrawn, as that measure was framed chiefly with reference to
the public good, and with very little consideration for their peculiar advantage. To be sure,
had it passed, it might have failed to accomplish its object, for it vested the construction of
the medical educational body in the Crown, that is to say in the Government, which can be
no competent judge of scientific merit, and is not fit to nominate professors of the science
of healing as it nominates bishops and other doctors, entrusted with the cure of souls, the
exercise of whose functions requires no particular skill or knowledge, and in whose hands
the spiritual lives of their patients are not perhaps altogether placed.
MR. HEADLAM’s Bill §º. for the medical corporations their most valuable vested
interests—those from which they derive money. It proposes to continue the compulsion
of students, before admitting them to practise, to pay handsome fees to those fine British
Institutions. Nobody, therefore, can be astonished that the Bill of MR HEADLAM should
be stamped with the cordial approval of our liberal associations for the advancement of
j.".m. - - - - - ---
he Bill appears also to give much satisfaction to º respectable medical practitioners.
By the retention of large diploma fees it narrows the entrance into their profession.
It performs for them the same function as that which what they call, the pylorus performs
in the digestive organs—lets nothing pass that would be injurious. Too, many competitors
would be injurious. MR. HEADLAM’s pylorus tends to shut, out competitors. To this end
it is framed with singular solicitude, insomuch that it actually contains a clause ºf
a practitioner, removing from one part of the kingdom. to another, to practise there till
after the expiration of two years. This clause is eminently calculated to protect the
established practitioner from the nuisance of having some enterprising young man come
and set up next door. - -
The Registration system which the Bill proposes will also highly benefit established
º if only the fee for registration is put, in Committee, at a sufficiently high
gure. The fee will conduce to the exclusion from practice of poor clever fellows, who, if
they were not prevented from exercising their abilities, might, prove dangerous rivals to
thriving medical men. Attorneys stand an annual tax for licence to practise without
much grumbling, precisely because that impost limits competition in attorneyism; and it
might answer i. purpose of a medical practitioner well-to-do to pay the like tax for the
same species of protection. This protection is, in fact, the only use of registration; all the
benefit of which, as far as the public are concerned, would be secured by º the existing
: corporations, and the one to be created, to publish easily accessible lists of their
members.
If anything so absurd as the good of the º, at large were contemplated by the
framer of a medical bill, the tenor of his measure might be somewhat to the drift ensuing. The
bill would be based on the principles of Free Trade. Everybody presumed to have arrived at
years of discretion would be at liberty to be quacked, with the option of being treated by a
legally qualified practitioner. That option would
be provided for by a Medico-Chirurgical Titles
Act. The name of ...' egally quali
practitioner would be posted on the church-door
of his parish. Any unqualified º:
curing his name to be placed there wo
liable to be hanged—or visited with some
secondary punishment. All existing co -
tions would be deprived of all their º:
except the right to examine candidates; but, by
way of compensation, would be allowed to grant
diplomas on their own terms. A new medical
examining board would be appointed, exacting
the highest degree of attainment from all candi-
dates, and the minimum standard of professional
knowledge would be defined to be that required
by the College of Physicians.

ADVICE TO MR. BUCKSTONE.
HE Bills of the Play announce that
MR. BUCKSTONE takes a benefit on
the night of the day on which exult-
ing London receives this number.
He has a new comedy and other
things to offer, besides an address on
the 1124th might of the season. All
very well, and MR. BUCKSTONE is a
party in every way deserving the
patronage of Mr. Punch, and con-
sequently of the world. But why is
get up a º § for his
Benefit? He wº reply that he could
| not “cast” it ºft But this is
a frivolous answer. He could cast
it a good deal more strongly than the
Princess's management can do, which
does not allow such scruples to pre-
| vent “Shakspearian revivals.” Why not use SHAKSPEARE as MR. KEAN
uses him? If the company cannot i. the language, cut it out, or
transpose it. MR. BuckstöNE should have taken Macbeth, and treated
it as MR. KEAN has cleverly treated the Tempest. He should have
reduced Lady Macbethto silence, and let the Witches sing her speeches
from under the stage, or from the wing, which would have been quite
justifiable, as they are really his tempters, though his wife is made by
the poet to set him on. He should have played Macbeth himself-
when he recollects that MR. KEAN does so, surely there can be no
of presumption against MR. BUCKSTONE.
As for the other parts, they might be all cut down to lines, first, out
of reverence, for the author, whose words ought, not to oe §
delivered, and next, to make room for effects. The BATTLE, in whic
Macbeth unseams Macdonald, is only described by the bloody officer
in the play, but this description should be cut out and give place to the
actual fight, a splendid scene, with real armour. In the Second Act, the
CAROüSETſūī THE FIRST COCK would afford a contrasting
scene of revel and debauch, with Highland flings of the period, an
then the King's MURDER, never before shown on the stage, with the
thunder, roaring, and ghosts looking out, from under the beds. The
Fourth Act should comprise the APPARITION SCENE, in which all
the Freischütz horrors might be concentrated, and by means of the
magic lantern, spirits º appear, all over the house, and frighten
the audience out of their senses. The Fifth Act could end all happily
with the magnificent CORONATION AT SCONE. There, now,
MR. Buckston E, why not do this sort of thing, and take credit for
“reviving.” SHAksPEARE * You will be well puffed, (only you are not
to vaunt that you pay £500 a-year for such puffing,) and in due time
ou may be made SIR BALDwiN BUCKSTONE. Meantime, though you
ack the courage which some possess, Mr. Punch wisheth you a
bumper benefit.
DOMESTIC HARMONY.
It is now some years since Il Fanatico per la Musica can have been
performed—and Notes and Queries only knows whether it ever was
performed—in this country; but that the hero of the opera has a
representative in actual life, is obvious from the subjoined advertise-
ment extracted from the Musical Times:–
WANTER A COACHMAN, a man having a tenor voice and fair
knowledge of music, so as to be able to take part in a choir, preferred. Also,
a boy, to milk and take charge of cows; he must have a good voice.—Apply,
Library, Walton, Norfolk.
A tenor voice may be an excellent thing in a coachman, but will,
perhaps, in the opinion of most people, be a recommendation of
*...* importance to a faculty of driving, enabling him, when on
duty, to keep the even tenor of his way. We cannot well conceive
any use for a musical coachman, as coachman, except that of singing
an additional part, which RossINI, might please to write for the per-
former who appears on the box of the heroine's carriage in La Cene-
rentola. A musical cowboy can be the want of none but an extremely
Arcadian mind. Perhaps the choir, in which the coachman, and pre:
sumably the cowboy also, are desired to take part, is an ecclesiastical
one: whence we hopefully infer that the musical coachman will occupy
a seat in the singing gallery of the church at Walton, and not the box
#. coach in which he has conveyed his employers to the sacred
eclince.

PUNCH'S LAW REPORTS.
MR. PUNCH is happy to state that he has made arrangements with a
most eminent, and most extortionate, Law Bookseller, for the publi-
cation of a series of Law Reports, of a condensed character. They
will be taken, with perfect recklessness, from the proceedings in the
Court of Chancery, House of Lords, Common Law Courts, Assize
Courts, Criminal Courts, Police Courts, Sessions, and every other
lace where injustice is administered, and iir. Punch has engaged a
arge corps of briefless and useless barristers to supply him .# the
necessary information. He º himself, only and solely, to the
Truth of each report, but as for the manifestation of the least respect
for the Judge who may give the decision, that is entirely as it may
appen. The Reports will appear, originally, in these columns, and
when enough have been collected to make a º in close type, of
two vºlumes, fifteen hundred pages each, an event which will º
precede the opening of the twentieth century, they will be publishe

THE NEW REGULATION MESS,

By Jove!—I shall. CUT THE ARMY, AND Go INTO THE CHURCH!”
MOWING THE HOUSE.
It seems that the stone of the Houses of Parliament is
crumbling to pieces. ...If the decay is not quickly put a
stop to, Parliament will no longer be in a position to face
the country, for every bit of its face will have peeled off
and tumbled into the water. It will become a most bare-
faced Legislature, worthy to stand by the side of the old
Barebones Parliament, or the present. French Chamber of
Deputies., Bit by bit, the Houses will be dissolved, and
the Dissolution will be one not unsuggestive of Stony-
Batter. Members will be rather astonished to be met
some night with an announcement like the following:—
“No House THIS EVENING !”
“THE HOUSE HAS ADJOURNED TO THE MIDDLE
OF THE RIVER . . .”
An adjournment, like that would be somewhat difficult
to withdraw. Members might move the rising of the House
in vain. We doubt if any of our illustrious representatives
—not even those for Cork, or Bath, or Poole, or Waterford
—would like to take their seats in a Parliament that could
offer them nothing but a watery bed to situpon. The Peers
would probably feel the inconvenience of being in the
water considerably less. -
However, there must be somethin

losing their hold upon the country, and thus falli
away in the estimation of its own supporters.

R Rl HE falling' of a bombshell into the House of

| | ||
Lords, could have hardly caused more con-
sternation among several of their number,
than was occasioned lately by the motion of
the EARL of DoNough MoRE, that the printer
of a Newspaper should be brought into their
presence. The EARL OF DERRY shuddered
through at least five sentences at the bare idea
him; and poor LoRD MALMESBURY has
scarcely yet recovered from the fright it gave
him, to hear it was proposed to confer upon
the “person” the “distinction” of calling
him to the bar of the House. In the most
pathetic of duets they both sighed forth their
}. against such contamination, and were
oudly echoed by a chorus of “hear! hear!”
As well introduce a sweep into a drawing-
room, or allow a Casino gent admission into ALMACK's, as let a common
newsprinter be brought into the Peers’ chamber. No amount of fumi-
gation would be able to exterminate the smell of the wet broadsheet
which—it was not to be doubted—the animal would bring with him;
and all the laundresses in Tondon would fail in effecting the removal
of the stain which the printing ink would leave upon the ermine of
“eir lordships.
Wet one would think it could have hardly been the simple fear of
tact with a creature of such low organisation as a printer, by which
me their lordships' nerves were so much shattered. As the voice
he people—to whom now even Peers have to render their account
he Press is to be dreaded, even by a DERBY ; and the appearance of
"ewspaper in the Fº of its publisher would have much the same
* upon the mind of a MALMESBURY, as the shadow of a cat upon
1stinct of a mouse. Even as the owl delights to sit in darkness,
of having such a creature face to face with fi
so would certain of the Peers perhaps be not a little pleased if the
light of Press-publicity were never thrown upon the sittings. Obscuruwa
pro magnifico–of what splendid bursts of oratory the nation might
account them capable, were there no reporters to destroy the fond
delusion' !
No doubt, many of their lordships agree, perfectly in thinking that :
Newspapers are of the things which in France, it has been said, are
under better management. And doubtless many sighs are breathed
upon the night air of St. Stephens’, for a champion to rise in the
defence of dull debaters, and annihilate their enemies the penmen of
the Press. Still Punch sleeps in quiet, and has not the least idea of
nding his shop shutters up. Yet, were a massacre of Editors decreed,
who but he of all would be attacked the soonest? Nevertheless, Mr.
Punch continues easy in his mind, even with this thought upon it. .
For he concurs with HENRY BROUGHAM in thinking it were “useless
contending with the Press.”. John BULL may submit to many Paris

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SOCIAL TREAD-MILL. No. 10.
S there are degrees in blackness,
so there are differences in public
dimmers. At Greenwich or Rich-
mond there is at least the few
hours’ escape from stifling, dusty,
steaming, midsummer London;
the look out over the green
woods, or on, the bright river,
which, when the tide is high, at
least, has lost the common-sew-
erish look it wears above bridge;
the peculiarity of the fish-dinner
—though, alas, that, too, begins
to grow sadly stale; the tempo-
SS rary, hilarity which º Sun,
§§ flowing water, and iced cham-
§ º are sure to produce;—and,
Nº º but above all, the absence
of that peculiar public-dinner
infliction—the toast-master.
“Happily, too, Greenwich and
Richmond rooms have not yet
expanded into the awful dimen-
sions of those vast dungeons in
Russell Street, and St. Martin’s-
in-the-Fields, where the punish-
ment of the public dinner is ad-
ministered in its severest form,
In dinners ‘down the river,” or ‘on the Hill, the sentence is carried out in a mitigated
form—without hard labour, as it were. indeed, they are only semi-public dinners—the worst
of thºse which are given at Greenwich or Richmond. Sometimes the muster is one of
friendly guests under the wing of a host whose heart is larger than his house; sometimes
it is an assemblage of old friends, scattered all the rest of the year, but gathered annually
here by the bond of some old association, to reknit half-loosened ties, to rub half-effaced
memories, bright again, to be once more boys at the same school, or men at the same uni-
versity. Or occasionally the entertainment is of that class which brings together a peculiarly
easy-going style of men, and an especially becoming style of pink capote, worn with the airiest
grace and crowning the freshest and prettiest of summer toilettes, , Such parties are merry
enough generally, and free from at least that curse of formality and dulness, which broods over
the public dinner proper. Indeed, they are not, as a general rule, penal inflictions at all,
except on the purse of the entertainer.
“And did we look on ourselves in the light of social turnkeys and prison officials—oh!
FULGENTIUs, chum of my soul, sharer with me of chambers in the Tº: partner in the
same scrubby clerk, sufferer under the same ..". laundress—when we broke out
in that memorable July, and entertained a round dozen of the pleasantest of our male, and
the prettiest of our female acquaintances at the Trafalgar? Surely that dinner was far
enough removed from dulness, or humbug, or excess. But you would insist on bouquets, you
remember. And as for even the bill—didn't you win your charming little wife and her nice
little fortune by that identical dinner? Her Cerberus of an aunt, for whom you had till then
in vain tried to invent a sop, was the one woman there above thirty-two. Seeing only the
bright faces and pretty toilettes about her, and there being no mirror in the room, she fancied
her own face as bright, [and her own bonnet as becoming as the rest, was beguiled into the
best of tempers, and then and there admitted FULGENTIUs to her heart, as “a most delightful,
well-bred young man,’—which he is, and was, and ever will be—and raised no opposition
when in the barouche on the way home, he confided the state of his affections to her unguarde
ear just before passing Kennington Gate. No-all considered, I feel I have no right to class
Greenwich or Richmond dinners among the performances on the Social Tread-mill. Their
own humbug, their own vanities, their own absurdities, they may have, but they are among
the least dreary forms in which John BULL foregathers with his kind.
“Only, I think it is time that the fish-course should be brought within more reasonable
dimensions, and that those very, obliging persons, MR. QUARTERMAINE. and MR.HART,
should insist on their cooks devising something new for this part of the dinner. Why this
perpetual sameness of souché of carp, flounder and salmon—the same everlasting fried slips
and lobster-balls, and whiting ºil. and stewed eel, and turbot à l’Hollandaise, and
à la Normande, and salmon-cutlets, sance finant-and all the rest of the enormous
but unvarying round, which we are all so tired of
“The poor little whitebait are smothered beneath the weight of these, which were once their
accessories. Scarce even the hottest devilling can sharpen up the languid * that has
run the gauntlet of fifteen fishes, before the whitebait appears, So far as I can see, most
people at a Greenwich dinner appear to eat the brown bread and butter with more appetite
than anything else.
“Can't anything new be struck out? It is to be feared that the fish-dinner is growing,
as everything, in this country is so apt to 'grow, into an institution—with, regular forms,
. it ºul, comes to be thought profane, not to say indecent, to meddle with, or even
Complain of.
“I do not think that in France any chef would have consented to serve as many dinners
of precisely the same pattern as the cooks at the Ship and Trafalgar have gone on sending
up year after year. -
“Then again, why do we all think it our duty at Greenwich, to take more liquor, or rather
more kinds of liquor-than is good for us?'...The mixture of drinks which I see thoughtful
men, give way to at such dinners is appalling. There is the cold punch with the turtle, and
the hock they hand round with the souché, and the champagne, and the intermediate sherry,

and the claret after—to say nothing of inter.
mezzi of fancy wines. Of course it is intelligible
that landlords should encourage this . of
thing, but why do well-intentioned hosts tole.
rate, or sensible guests give way to it?
“Let no mixture of drinks during dinner be
allowed. If a man likes sherry, let ń. stick to
it; if he prefer hock, give him hock, but let him
Mºnderstand he is to be debarred from sherry.
Champagne is an exception: that may be allowed
to every man—and woman. It is potable exhila-
ration: John BULL requires its magic to
lift his ponderous mass out of the clouds and
fogs and i mists that hang about him when
unelated.
“And let some patriot give himself to the
study of fish, considered as an article of food,
not as a branch of natural history. Let him
acquire, by reading and experiment the master
of all known ways in which every kind of fis
may be dressed; and then let him j adven-
ture upon new ones. Let him, thus informed,
take one of the Greenwich Taverns, and give us
sºmething novel in the way of a Fish Dinner.
We will promise him unlimited custom.”

22 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 18, 1857.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
HE Hero of Balaklava (it may be
as well to say that LoRD CARDI-
GAN is meant) inquired (Monday,
July 6,) whether it was true that
the troops, just sent out to India
had been despatched in sailing ves-
sels. To this LoRD PANMURE re-
plied that it was so, and that it was
considered that sailing vessels
would reach their destination as
soon as steamers, or sooner. LoRD
SHAFTESBURY gave an unqualified
condemnation of the French plan
for taking out “free” negroes to
the colonies, a scheme which he
declared would be tamtamount to
a revival of the slave-trade, “the
most accursed crime ever perpe-
trated.” As Lord PALMERston
motoriously gives his confidence to
LoRD SHAFTESBURY, the PREMIER
§ is as likely to take the opinion of
the latter about blacks as about
bishops, and therefore the Wiscount
Wº: ly speaks through the Earl.
We hope sq. There was another
discussion about the right of the
Crown—a right that is undoubted—to the soil between high and low-
water mark. LoRD BROUGHAM intimated that in many, cases, the
agents of Government were careless in enforcing such right, a state-
ment for which Mr. Punch was not prepared. He would have thought
that they were always in charge of that property, considering their
habit of sticking in the mud.
In the Commons, MR. SALISBURY wanted correspondence about the
river Dee, but what connection there is between the river Dee an
Salisbury we are unaware; though, as MR.S. is a remarkably sensible
fº we presume that his jº is not at fault. SIR B.
ALL said, that it had not been decided where the BARON MARochETTI’s
statue of Rich ARD THE FIRST was to be erected. It, or rather the
model, used to be behind the cab-stand in Palace Yard, with uplifted
sword, hailing all the cabs at once; but SIR C. BARRY thought that it
somehow interfered with the clock-tower, so it was ordered off.
Wiscoust Wiiliºsis said to have made the most execrablejoke ever
heard, while the statue was there. He remarked that an unfortunate
cab-horse, looking at it, might exclaim, “O, Rich ARD ! O, mon raw /*
The Wiscount must have forgotten that whatever kind of animal may
speak, in or near Parliament, horses don't.....,
The House went into Committee on the Wills Bill, and the ATTORNEY-
GENERAL went on º until the fortieth clause was reached.
This limited the operation of probates, to be granted by district
registrars, to personal estates under £1,500. MR. WESTHEAD–who
ought to understand the question, his Christian name being PROCTOR-
proposed to do away with all limitation. SIR. R. BETHELL opposed
this suggestion, but the Committee liked it, and LORD PALMERSTON's
Government was, beaten by a majority of 31, MR. HAYTER snatched
up, his, whip, and ran round the clubs and other resorts, slashing
violently at the legs of the absentee members, and he drove a lot of
them into the House, when BETHELL thought he would make the
Committee eat humble-pie, so he took another division. MR. HAYTER’s
whip had not been used quite enough, and LoRD PALMERSTON's
Government was again beaten, this time by a majority of 2. The Com-
mittee cheered; but LQRD PALMERSTON jumped up, and put a stop to
that sort of thing by having progress reported. At the end of the
week, SIR. RICHARD made another attempt to impose a limitation, and
tried to frighten the House with the threat of giving up the bill, but
the House not being frightened, LoRD PAM gave way.
Tuesday. The case of whippers of another, kind, namely, coal-
whippers, among the most useful of hard-worked men in London,
came before the Peers. Much good was done by an Act passed in
favour of these men, who were ºil, delivered from the tyranny
of the publicans near, the river. These persons get the business of
engaging the coal-whippers to unload the ships, and the man who
drinks most, is, of course, the pot-housekeeper's favourite, and obtains
work, while a better fellow is hindered in every paltry way. The Act,
which MR. GLADstoNE H. expired, and the poor fellows are again
in the hands of the publicans. LQRD KINNAIRD moved that a Bill for
their protection should be referred to a Committee, and Mr. Punch is
glad to say that the motion was carried.
In the Commons it was announced that Government had not yet
come to the determination of turning the Royal Academicians out of
the National Gallery, whose apartments they really have no more claim
to than Mr. Punch. Indeed, if He demanded them for his printing and
publishing office, Government might plead, as the excuse for giving
them, that he performed great services to the nation, but the most
impudent of the painting º will hardly assert this of the
Academy.... But the R.A.’s will have to go, one of these days, for the
National Pictures are to remain in Trafalgar Square, and the rooms
will be wanted for the presents which Mr. Punch, and other proprietors
of collections, intend to give to the nation.
LORD PALMERSTON then smashed, as he conceived, the Isthmus of
Suez Canal, declaring that the scheme was a bubble, and also that, for
F. reasons, our Government would always oppose it. Some years
ence, the chief cabin passengers of the Bulbul, a steamer plying alon
the Suez Canal, will read this record in Mr. Punch's łºś.
Volume (a complete set of his works being among the necessaries of
the voyage), and will smile indulgently, and remark how Egypt has
improved since England accepted her as a present from the SULTAN,
with the consent of the Republic of France.
MR. RoeBuck brought on a motion for abolishing the Lord
IIEUTENANT of Ireland. The debate was not a very amusing one, and
the House shirked a decision, by negativing the “previous question,”
numbers 266 to 115. A good deal of praise was lavished on LoRD
CARLISLE, especially by . DISRAELI, who, in his pleasant scoffing
way, hinted to the House that LoRD MORPETH had been somebody in
a Parliament in which there were other somebodies, men of mark, and
not the insignificant lot he had the honour of addressing. His praise
is of the order which, alone, SIR PHILIP Junius FRANCIS held to be
tolerable, namely, praise in odium tertii, or (to make ourself clear to
railway members and the military), when one praises BROWN in order
to show one's hate for Jones.
Wednesday. The Bill for dividing the Thames, right to the QUEEN,
mud to the MAYor, passed. Sir G. Lewis brought in a little bill of
£500,000 for the Persian war, about which there was a row, on the
ground that he had no business to bother with his bills on Wednesdays.
MR. ADDERLEY’s useful Bill for sending criminal lads to industrial
schools, and making parents, who had neglected to educate their
children pay the expense, got through Committee. The first victim to
an election petition was then thrust from his seat. This was MR. NEATE,
d member for Oxford city, whose place Mr. Punch's old Contributor,
also advantageously known to the world at large as the author of
Wanity Fair, and, in fact, as WILLIAM MAREPEACE THACKERAY, pro-
poses to do the constituency honour by filling, should they have the
sense to elect him. Mr. Punch could, º course, return him by a word,
but, true to his Liberal sentiments, disdaims to use coercion. MR. W.
M. T. has addressed Oxford, in a capital speech, in which he avowed
allegiance to the ballot, and to the extension of the suffrage, but not
such extension as in France permitted an Emperor on Horseback "to
ride cockhorse over the whole country, one Tyrant ruling over the
people.” All hands, save one dirty one, went up for TITMARSH.
Thursday. LoRD CAMPBELL, after a well-deserved condemnation of
the foulness known as French novels (evidence that one of which
books had been seen for three minutes in a married woman’s hand
ought to be ample ground for divorce) advanced his Immoral Publica-
tions Bill. LoRD MALMESBURY gave notice that the eminent horse-
racing Christian, LoRD DERBY, meant to demolish the Jew Bill, next
evening, and the REVEREND RABBI ADLER proceeded to compose an
elegant Hebrew hymn in his lordship's honour. We should quote it,
but our only compositor who says he understands Hebrew is gone to
a Wey-Goose, and by this time, is, we hope, joyously contemptuous
alike of ALEPH, BETH, TsADDI, SHIN, and TAw.
In the Commons it was announced that the Mayo priests, in
their fury at the exposures before the committee, could not wait
for the decision, but immediately on the return of some of the
witnesses, set a mob upon them, and caused the most ruffianly
outrages to be committed. Mr. Punch emphatically lays these crimes
at the doors of the priests, and hopes that the IRISH Artº RNEy-
GENERAL, who has gone over to inquire into the subject, will be able
to convict, not the wretched tools, but their blasphemous instigators,
who invoke the holiest names in order to incite to the foulest brutalities.
The Bill for dealing with Fraudulent Trustees was discussed, and in
some respects improved.
Friday. LORD DERBY º: his word, and demolished the Jew. Bill.
LORD GRANVILLE moved the second reading, ably. The other EARL
then went to work, and rattled away merrily, hitting at everything
and everybody. He settled for ever the question of Mr.
DisRAELI's orthodoxy, by declaring that no Hebrew ºught to be
Chancellor of the Exchequer. His great objection to the Jews was
that they all intend to be off to Palestine some day—to Levant, in fact,
if one may borrow a word from the Jockey-club to which LoRD DERBY
has been writing so º: a letter of complaint that our racehorses
are getting into the hands of our rascals. LQRD LYNDHURST, of cºurse,
made short work with the turf logic. The DUKE of NoFFöLK, laying
aside the grievance of the Catholicyoted to redress that of the jew.

Oxford sneered savagely at LoRD SHAFTESBURY's owning to a con-
science—some priests hate non-professional religionists. HENRY
Brough AM's voice was again raised for the Jews. But LoRD DERBY’s
threat was no vain one. Of the Lords in presence, 91...were for the

steel for Crinoline, and a
foreign order has been
given for one ton a-week
for several weeks."
Ladies are now, ac-
cording to the above
intelligence, encasing
themselves in armour

of mail, or, if we may
be pardoned the ex-

e suppose these
steel Crinolines will
be called Jupons à la

- ever protection these
§ petticoats of
cumstances of peril,
such as those inci-
dental to a Royal Drawing Room, there is one occasion on, which the
wearing of them would be dangerous. The occasion alluded to is that
of a thunderstorm, when every sensible young lady, if .." lady
who wears such preposferous garments can be called sensible, should
divest herself of her steel Crinolines, lest they should attract the light-
ming; which is the only way in which they can render their wearer at
all attractive.

A PAINTING of Niagara by CHURCH, not the Church of England or

work, as here shown, does Grace CHURCH, its painter, it is quite
beyond the limits of a shilling cab-fare from any known locality.
t is a wonderful picture. The almighty water-power, as the Yankees
call the cataract, is represented with almost equal oil-power by the
painter. And we can only say, that the CHURCH of America should be
visited by all worshippers of the Beautiful.

EMPLOYMENT FOR THE BLIND. The Directors of a Joint
Stock Company, of well established reputation, and above a fortnight's standing,
are in want of an experienced and skilful person, to act in the capacity of Auditor
of the accounts. The duties of the situation will be found extremely light, con-
sisting merely of the regular routine of making the half-yearly inspection of the
books, and supplying a certificate (the form of which is stereotyped) that the figures
there contained are perfectly correct, and entirely coincide with those named in the
Report. In looking over the accounts the Auditor will simply have to overlook
whatever may be wrong in them, and will be required to turn a blind eye to any-
thing that may appear to him suspiciously defective or fraudulently false. More-
over, where there seems, the danger that some extensive piece of cookery may by
some means come to light, he will be expected to assist in the keeping of it dark.
Still, in order to give somewhat the appearance of reality to his labour of inspection,
he will be allowed now and then to mention his discovery of a mistake of some
odd shillings, or to record that he has doubts if this or that security will not prove
some halfpence short, which errors, the Directors will of course take t to
themselves for having rectified.
As the employment will be one of anything but trust, no pecuniary guarantee or
surety will be requisite. But inasmuch as it is part of the Directors' policy to give
a high tone of morality to each branch of their establishment, every applicant must
be furnished with the regulation testimonials as to his spotless and unblemished
reputation; and must in addition be provided with certificates to prove his constant
attendance at his Sabbath place of worship. Moreover, as it is the custom to com-
mence the day's business with a short religious service, it is expected that each
ntleman, engaged in the establishment shall be able, in rotation, to officiate as
sº for which some knowledge of the Scriptures will, of course, be requisite.
It is likewise a rule, that on Board Days and occasions of the Meeting of the Share-
holders, every Clerk and official (inclusive even of the door-porters) shall be
uniformly dressed in a black suit and a white neckeloth: while, to preserve an air
of decent piety throughout the whole establishment, any one committing so much
as a smile, will, if detected, be summarily dismissed. Every applicant, therefore,
must provide himself beforehand with suitable apparel, and the possessors of long
faces and the recognised odour of sanctity will be preferred.

Company, apply in person (after nightfall) at the office of the Agents, Mrs.Rs.

&: º
SOLDIER'S FARE.
THE excitement occasioned in the Army by the CoMMANDER-IN-
CHIEF's sumptuary regulation limiting the cost of gallant officers’
dinners to 2s. a-head for the Cavalry, and ls. 6d. for the Infantry,
increases. The resolution, put by our Artist into the mouth of the
“Swell Soldier,” delineated in his admirable sketch on page 20 of
our last number, to “cut the Army and go into the Church,” for
the sake of a better sort of living than the military, would be adopted
to an alarming extent, were it not for a fortunate little difficulty.
Going into the Church is more easily talked about than done, by gen-
tlemen whose boots and manners may be polished, but whose Latin
and Greek are rusty, and whose theology, at the utmost, is bounded by
the Church Catechism. -
We understand that, with a view to meet the objection entertained
by officers of the fashionable and expensive classes to the cheap and
Spartan fare prescribed for them by authority, some new regiments
are about to be created, for the express purpose of suiting their exqui,
site and refined tastes, and peculiarly privileged to eat and drink ad
libiţum, under the general designation of Dining Regiments. A ne-
º qualification for a commission in these corps will be the posses-
sion of an ample income. They will be distinguished by titles expressive
of the principle of their formation—and among them rumour has already
named the 1st Diners, the llth Millionnaires, the Eaters and Drinkers,
and the Royal Epicures. In none of these will officers be limited to
the kitchen wines, Port and Sherry; and one of them is, we believe,
to bear the º: denomination of the 3rd Light Clarets. A
troop of Light Horse, in which the luxury of horse-flesh, cooked
after the French fashion, with adjunction of the finest French wines,
will be a standing dish, is also spºken of. The winners of the Derby
and the other principal races will be bought up for the mess of this
ultra-crack regiment.
By officers of the line generally the circumscription of mess
expenses has been hailed with high glee, and measures are in course
of being taken to carry the principle of cheap dining thoroughly out.
A gallant officer orders his plate of weal-and-ham, roast beef, saddle
of mutton, stewed rump-steak, and so forth, at nine-pence the plate;
his one ox, his mock, his pea, or his bouilli, at an equally moderate
tariff. In Cavalry messes, however, the system of a cut off the joint
more generally prevails, and the mess aspires to the character of a
two-shilling ordinary. Some messes in both departments of the service
have been reformed on the chop-house model; and we may, state, as
an authentic fact, that one of the waiters at the Cheshire Cheese has
been had down to a certain dépôt by a particular regiment, in order
that he might teach the mess-table attendants to cry “Cook–single
mutton' "...and “Two Mutton down together!”
RE-CHRISTENING THE DAYS OF THE WEEK.
A YouNG friend of ours, a regular good Bohemian,—one who is often
out of luck, but never out of spirits, has rechristened the Days of the
Week. This is his new nomenclature:–
Sunday - - - ... he calls . Cramday.
Monday . - - - > y . Cold meatday.
Tuesday . - - - -- . Noday, or Blankday.
Wednesday - - - x 1. . Borrowday. "
Thursday . - - - -- . Pawnday.
Friday - - - - * > . Spongeday,
Saturday . - - - -> - - . Tinday, or Chequeday.
Our friend's notion of the Millennium is a year full of nothing bu
Saturdays—i.e., every week to have seven Tindays in it.
Riddle for the Peers.
WHAT Conveyance is worse than the worst Omnibus? is a question
which LoRD BRough AM might have asked the House, of Lords the
other evening, when he introduced a Bill to amend the law relating to
the conveyance of estates, which is the slowest and most awkward and
inconvenient conveyance in the world.
THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES.
MR. CHARLEs KEAN, it is advertised, has acquired the right to add
to his signature F.S.A.. The public is requested to observe, that these
initials do not mean Fair Second-rate Actor.

CHARIVARI. 27
* LET Us JOIN THE LADIES.”
HOSE who are fond of
“the Society of Ladies”
will rush to No. 315,
Oxford Street, and there
enjoy an exhibition that
is the result of female
handiwork. It is not an
\ exhibition of stitching
or embroidery, such as
shirts made at home, or
anti-macassars, or floral
smoking caps, or butter-
fly braces, or sporting
º: with a series
of foxes running helter-
skelter over the toes. It
is not an exhibition of
Berlin-wool work, or
potichomanie, or any
other mania that oc-
casionally seizes hold of
young ladies’ fingers,
and makes them, for the
time being, excessively
sticky to squeeze, as
thoughyouwere shaking
hands with a Sub-Editor in the full agony of paste and scissors. It is not an
exhibition of jams, or jellies, or marmalades, or preserves, or much less, pickles.
You must not expect you are about to be invited to a choice collection of pies, or
tarts, or cakes, or puddings, of a most marvellous sweetness, such as is generally
impºrted by whitejooking hands that are more in the habit of playing with the
keys of the piano than the keys of the store-room. Nor is it wax-work with its
mossy baskets of blooming fruit, such as would certainly tempt birds to come and
peck at them, nor vases of paper flowers, so faithfully rendered as actually to cause
maid-servants to water them. It is nothing to eat, nothing to play with, nothing to
wear, nothing that you can adorn your magnificent, person with. It is simply a
collection of $58 works of art, that have been contributed exclusively by the talent
and genius of English Ladies. A Frenchman would nickname the Exhibition: Les
Femmes peintes parelles-mêmes-though it must not be surmised that the painting is
in the ungallant sense that a Frenchman would satirically convey. If cheeks are
delicately caloured—if lips are strung into the precise shape of Cupid's bow—if
eyebrows are splendidly arched, into so, many Arcs de Triomphe—if eyelashes are
artistically pencilled—the pencilling and the lº. not upon their own fair
features, but on the faces of others; and there is no law as yet laid down,
webelieve, by the tyranny of Man, that a Lady, though she may not colour her
own adorable physiognomy, is forbidden to paint the face of another.
The Society, to which we have just introduced the reader, numbers none but
| Ladies. The only doubt of that fact is the extraordinary silence that reigns
round the room; though, in opposition to that ungenerous sneer, we can state
that the likenesses of #. ladies are all so perfectly true to their sex, that every
one of them is a speaking likeness! Thus, there is a compensating balance in all
things, which, en passant, makes us only regret that there, is not one at our
banker's. But away with regrets in the presence of such delightful company'
You are communing with the works of ANNA, JULLA, KATE, AGNES, FLORENCE,
FRANCEs, and fifty other pretty names. Not a man's ugly cognomen is to be
found in the whole catalogue. ... It is a Book of Beauty, into which the admission
of the whiskered sex, is rigidly prohibited. The visitor involuntarily takes his
hat off before so much unknown loveliness. That Brigand, who is taking your
fancy captive, first reared his musket in the Byronic imagination of HARRIET.
Stand with respectful awe before that tender Brigand, for who knows,
HARRIET may one day, be, your wife?. That Bivouac, in the Desert, which is
glowing before you with the crimson light of a hundred blazing Havannahs,
was encamped originally in ; the snug parlour of Louisa—that very same
Louisa, that probably you flirted, with last, week at a picnic at Birmam
Beeches; halt and warm your hands lovingly before that Bivouac, and admire
it, if it is only for the primrose glove you stole on that occasion. Be careful
of your remarks. Drop not an ugly. word, lest you do an injury to the memory of
some poetic creature, who at some time or other handed, you a cup of tea, or sang
you the songs you loved, or conferred on f. some bright fleeting happiness that
for the moment deluged your heart with Italian sunshine. With GEORGIANA on
your right, MARIA on your left; with EMMA gazing from her . frame right
| at you, and Sophia peeping from behind that clump of moon-silvered trees over
| your shoulder, be i...". courteous, be, complimentary, be everything that is
gentle, and devoted, and kind. Not that there is any necessity for courtesy or
compliments; but still, we fancy, that every gentleman, who goes to an Exhibition,
| carries always a little bit, of the RUSKIN with him, and fancies he is “nothing,”
unless he is “critical.”
There is an Emigrant, Ship of MRs. MIAN's, that many a R.A. would have
been proud to have launched into fame. There are some Teneriffe views by MRs.
| MURRAY, that are so beautiful, and seem so true, that you may almost swear for
the remainder of your life, and maintain stoutly too, without suspecting even you
are committing perjury, that you have been to Teneriffe, and know it thoroughly,
from its curious-coloured houses, its hanging vineyards, its
luxuriant, fruit down to the rich tawny gipsy-looking
beauties that sell them. How you hate the unpicturesque
applewomen and orange girls when you come into Oxford
Street afterwards!
There are, also, water-colours, and copies from the Old
Masters, and a. Tennysonian picture by MRs. WARD, and
a genre subject by Miss BREADSTREET, and wonderful
ortraits of lace collars and Crinoline dresses (look at the
9N. MRs., RASHIEIGH! No. 180), that would send our
Châlons and Dubufes into fits of envy; and oil paintings,
|. and small, modest and ambitious, and such suctorious
birds’-eggs and glorious odoriferous flowers by MRs. HAR-
RISON, that you suspect she must have borrowed the
alette and brushes of HUNT to have painted them!
esides these, there are little pieces of sculpture, and
an infinity of agreeable picturº, the majority | which are
ticketed in the corner, “Sold.” And, for a picture, many
consider the height of criticism is to be “Sold!” and, in
truth, but few artists go beyond it, while hundreds of poor
struggling fellows never get so far. However, we must
reluctantly leave the “Society of the Ladies.” Agree with
us, reader, that as in most societies of the same kind (and
it always is º that there is plenty to admire, plenty to
praise, and very little to condemn.
However, we have one great fault to find. We do
strongly object to the Secretary and the Checktakers. We
have nothing to say against those gentlemen, excepting
that they are gentlemen. They should have belonged to
the opposite sex. That round collar, that black coat, those
Wellington boots, have no right to be in a room that, aS
they write over railway carriages, is “Engaged for Ladies.”
They are an intrusion, a º anachronism, two black
i. on the uniform beauty of the picture. Away with
them! Turn them out!
This is the “Ladies” debút in the artistic world. Of
course, they will go on improving (if any improvement is
possible in the sex () year after year. And, who knows, but
in time the Royal Academy may have a female President?
Not so very improbable either, considering that SIR
gº EASTLAKE's predecessor was well, known to be a

brightest jewel in the civic crown. This jewel, by the

distributed between him and certain of the magnates of
his Court. That too many cooks will spoil the broth in
this case is not much to be feared, as the river flows with
a gruel thick and slab, which can hardly be rendered more
nasty than it is. It is to be feared that the new Conser-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SELF-CONSTITUTED BEADLES.
O one more than ourselves
can venerate the office, res-
pect the person, and admire
the dress of a regular parish
beadle, but we scorn an
despise all amateur beadles.
Paterfamilias and other
meddlers of his class, who
under their own, or assumed
names, constitute themselves
the maintainers of petty
decorum, and the enforcers
of small proprieties. These
officious asses are perpetually
occupying themselves in try-
ing to get little restrictions
on personal liberty, and
especially sumptuary laws,
enacted or put in operation
to the annoyance of other
people. They would, if |
could, regulate your foo
your drink, your habits and
employments, the cut of your
clothes and of your hair;
they would make you shave yourself after their model; they would offer
you every species of impertinence that deserves a kicking, if they were
not afraid .# getting themselves accordingly kicked. Not being able to
tyrannize over men, they are accustomed to gratify their contemptible
lust of dominion by coercing, and constraining, and checking, and
thwarting boys, curbing their inclinations, interfering with their tastes
and amusements, and spoiling their º in various particulars which | H
are beneath the notice of any respectable mind. One of these meddlers.
calling himself “A MEMBER of CoNvocation,” has lately been
writing letters, complaining of the free-and-easy style of dress, and the
lively sports and pastimes of the Oxford undergraduates, and callin
for the restraint of those young bucks in regard to the fashions an
diversions at which he carps. Their check-shirts, loose coloured caps,
and “American style of dress” in general, and their indulgence in
§: are denounced by this absurd old pedagogue with all the gravity
o eism.
The disciplinary propensities of a little and mean mind, exhibit
themselves in our censor's ensuing observations on smoking :-
“Smoking in the streets and in public, may in a great measure be checked by a
steady application of fines, by which a proctor well known to me was very success-
ful; he used, by the way, always to fine twice as much for a pipe as for a cigar."
Did he—the snob! Why? . The objection, if there is any, to a pipe
of tobacco, relates surely, not to the pipe, but to the weed. Tobacco,
if bad, is no better when formed into a cigar than it is when it forms
the contents of a pipe. Who is to prevent a man—Oxford or adult—
from smoking in his own room? and since that, for the Oxford man,
ought to be appropriated to study, the very fittest place for him to
smoke in is the street. -
If a proctor wanted to break undergraduates of wearing preposterous
coats, waistcoats, trowsers, collars, neck-ties, or other, articles of
apparel, his best plan would be to summon the offenders before him
have a photographic artist in attendance to take their likenesses, and
set up those ridiculous portraits to be exhibited in some convenient
public situation. It would be, however, much better to leave all such
matters to our own artists, whose province it is to deal with them, and
the attempt of anybody else to .. with them is an invasion of that
rovince. As to the “MEMBER of CoNvocation,” he, at all events,
ad better let comicalities of academical costume alone, for there can
be no doubt that his own attire is remarkable for peculiarities more
ludicrous than the most absurd shirt-patterns. We have every reason
to believe that, even during the present weather, he wears gaiters.
We wonder what, in their undergraduate days, was the style of costume
sported by the old noodles who now babble against fast fashions and
wear gaiters with their great shoes. What sort of a larva is it, in
statu papillari, that expands into this queer old black beetle P
The Patromage of St. Vitus.
THE British Public, with an incredulity resembling Betsy Prig’s,
may generally disbelieve that there is any such Saint as St. VITUs.
ere exists, however, a church, dedicated to a personage of that name
and title in sunny Italy; of which edifice the roof, according to tele-
graphic intelligence from Milan, lately fell in. Nobody can be sur-
rised at this intelligence, who considers that such a structure as the
hurch of St. Virus would be likely to be very shaky.
By amateur beadles we mean d
BEWARE OF STEEL TRAPS.
THE following opinion is borrowed for the occasion from PROFEssoR
KNoTz:—
“It is extremely probable, that whatever, conducts the electricity of the body
from it will occasion direct debility. With this view, I have long been in the habit
of causing females, who used steel supports in their stays, to lay them aside
d altogether.”
Now, ºf this theory to be correct, if steel stays are full of
anger, how much more dangerous must steel hoops be! Not only do
they debilitate the body, but the mind, also, of the beautiful, creature
who is weak enough to allow herself to be steel-trapped into this
absurd circle of folly. Againstall these hoops and similar abominations,
Punch raises a regular war-whoop, nor will he be satisfied till every
one of them is exterminated.
;
THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN.
“WHAT monsense! I’m tired,” exclaimed an Old Bachelor, with :
boiling indignation, “of hearing that old question mooted over and over
again! Why, the Women (bless the dear creatures') always are right!
here never was an argument, or a quarrel, or a grievance, or a dis-
#. or a spoilt child, or a missing button, or a separation, or a
ivorce, or an unbecoming bonnet, or an overboiled leg of mutton yet,
but a woman was invariably in the right! I’m sure i her Rights are
divine—as divine as herself—and as, of old, one of the Divine Rights
of Kings was ‘a King can do no wrong, so now-a-days one of the
Divine Rights of Woman is, “A Woman never is wrong.' And it’s
my belief, Sir, that she couldn't do it, not even if she were to try!”
Incendiary Publications.
THE cause of the late fire at the War Office, by which one of the
desks was destroyed, is no longer a mystery. The conflagration origi-
nated in the desk containing the NAPIER correspondence, obviously
by spontaneous combustion. All letters from that fiery family are
henceforth to be deposited in MILNER's fire-proof safes, each letter
having pinned to it one of PEEL's official replies; that being the most
effectual kind of damper known.
QUITE THE REVERSE.
WHEN the Pope was at Bologna, he expressed the greatest º at
finding himself in the midst of the Austrian army: and declared he
owed much gratitude to the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA, and therefore to
his soldiers. We can only say to such an opinion, “No-No-PIo.”
A WOICE FROM THE MUTE.
SIR. G. B. PECHELL, the other º: in the House of Commons,
presented a petition against the Vaccination Bill, from certain
inhabitants of Brighton. "We presume that those were the Brighton
undertakers.

SIX PAIRS OF TURTLES.
HE Morning Post “believes it is
correct in announcing ” (the
phraseology smacks a little of
down-stairs, but let that pass)
“that the preliminary arrange-
ments have been agreed upon
for certain *:::::: in high
life.” Now, “preliminary ar-
rangements” we hold to mean
that the young gentlemen have
asked the young ladies and
have been accepted, with the
approbation of parents and
guardians, so that is all right.
And as the only possible object
of publishing such “arrange-
ments” in the Morning Post,
to be republished by the world-
read . Observer, whence. Mr.
Punch takes his information, is
to obtain public opinion upon
the subject, (which might
otherwise be supposed to con-
cern only the happy couples
and their friends) Mr. Punch
hastens to express His opinion
upon the various matches thus
heralded to the universe.
The MARQUIs of LOTHIAN is to marry LADY CONSTANCE TALBot.
He is just 25, and she is not of age. We see no objection to this mar-
riage. The fiancé has four names, WILLIAM, SCHOMBERG, ROBERT,
KERR, so LADY CoNSTANCE has choice of a pet household term for her
husband, and we should respectfully suggest “BoB.” He is a Liberal,
and will therefore be liberal in the matter of settlements, but he is also
a Conservative, and will therefore take great and affectionate care of
his wife. As he has voted for the Jews, he may like Palestine soup-
a hint her ladyship had better remember when ordering dinner. If we
had any doubt about the match, it was because on hearing the an-
nouncement read we thought it somewhat presumptuous for a CUR to
seek alliance with a TALBot, but on reading for ourselves, orthography
relieved us of this ridiculous notion.
| WiscouxT GREY DE WILTON marries LADY SUSAN PELHAM, CHIN-
Tox. The lady is not related to MR. CLINTON, the celebrated flute
player, but is daughter of the DUKE of NEwcASTLE, who has, upon
occasion, performed with much success upon another favourite instru-
ment, his own trumpet, with no great response from the popular echo.
| Her young hero is in the Life Guards, and being heir to an Earldom
may reasonably look for due promotion. We are by no means disposed
to forbid these banns.
| LoRD AshLEY marries LADY HARRIET CHICHESTER. Any happiness
to any member of LoRD SHAFTESBURY's family must give pleasure to
society, but the deplorable conduct of the Morning Post, in spelling
DoNEGALL (the name of the lady's father) with one “L” instead of
two, is one of those lamentable, instances of frightful ignorance or
reckless malignity which naturally incense the aristocracy against a
free press.
LóRD Rob ERT CECIL marries Miss ALDERSON. The founder of
the bridegroom's house was, BURGHLEY, but we trust that, LoRD
| Robert will take care of his figure, and not let himself also become
burly. The lady is the daughter of one of the best judges that have
worn ermine, and we doubt not that LoRD ROBERT, in seeking the
alliance, has also shown himself a good judge. Although his elder
brother is LoRD CRANBOURNE, we do not recommend the bridesmaids
to #. to Cranbourne Street (Alley as was) for their bomets.
. The Hon. Mr. North marries Miss Cock EReLL, and as he will
inherit £40,000 a year and a peerage, not another word need be said,
except that as “on account of the youth of the bride the marriage is
to be deferred for some months,” ſir. Punch hopes Mr. North will
be a very good boy while on his probation. We recommend him, when
not in his bride's company, to spend as much of his time as possible on ||
the top of the Monument, reading Punch, as he will thus be out of
harm's way, and will be preparing his mind, for the responsibilities of |
wedlock. He may take his cigar-case with him.
Lastly, MR. W. H. REEVE marries Miss WELBY. We do not know
MR. REEve, but we knew the late JoHN REEyE, and we also know
the present SIMs REEVEs, though (as the latter spells his name
differently) this fact may have no immediate connection with the
marriage. The seat of the WELBy family being at Grantham, we are
happy to congratulate them upon the recent opening of the railway to
Sleaford, as well as upon the intended junction with the REEves.
The only obstacle to the marriage may arise from the editor of the
Morning Advertiser, who, if he looks into the Peerage a thing (to do
him justice) which he seldom does when writing upon aristocratic con-
nections, may see that MR. WILLIAM WELBy was born at Rome, a
circumstance that º the Advertiser to behold in the marriage
º blow at our Protestant Constitution. But we trust this may
e OWer.
É.i. and lastly, as dissenting ministers say, Mr. Punch would
not have taken the libert to make a single allusion to matters with
which he and the public have nothing to do, but for the Morning Post's
having availed itself of its down-stairs intimacies to reveal all these
interesting arrangements, and to make them topics of town and club
talk. He wishes the utmost happiness to the six couples about to
pair off for the remainder of the session of life, and trusts they may
never take part in a single division.
MARY THE MANY-FACED.
| OH MARY, QUEEN of Scots, you’re a myth, a sphynx, a mystery!
Chameleon, who will tell us what you' i. like, what you
- were :
| Will-o'the-wisps about you are the lights of British history,
Conventicle says one thing; another thing consistory;
Till "...is LINGARD's Romish glosses, and FROUDE's assaults so
1stery
You lookia'ſ fiend of darkness, half angel of the air.
But, at last, behold the Institute, yelept Archæological,
Calls fidelity of pencil to check flightiness of pen—
To correct both bias national, and influence theological,
By #. the originals of HoubRAKEN and LoDGE a call,
And showing MARY as she was in paint palaeological—
But Sussex Street has left me the most mystified of men.
I really feel as puzzled as a 'possum in a hollow tree,
§ a fire-stick at the bottom and a tomahawk a top;
Among these various images set | for Mariolatry—
However to the female Sex upon the whole tºº,
As showing that no woman’s too ugly for idolatry—
For of grimmer, ghastlier faces I never saw a crop.
Oh, give me back my vision—of the saint that gently took her
woes,
My MARY of the witching smile, the eye of violet grey;
And take away your JANETs, your Pou RBUSEs and ZUCCHEROS,
Who º her eyes, and friz her hair, and swell her cheeks and hook
er nose-
A rose may smell by any name, but with any name should look a
rose;
But what these MARYs look like, Ireally dare not say.
Though of Good QUEEN BEss's treatment of her rival no upholders,
We would fain ourselves turn headsmen, and with ruthless stroke
and firm
Strike all these heads of MARY off their ugly pairs of shoulders,
For the int’rest of posterity, that subsequent beholders
May be saved from foul injustice to the lovely head that moulders
In its cerecloth, in Westminster, sore fretted by the worm.
PROTECTION FROM ROBBERY.
FRIEND of ours has hit upon the followin
expedient, which he assures us has answere
with the greatest success for the last, eight
or nine years. He declares that it is infinitely
more efficacious than bars, bolts, alarums,
gongs, bulldogs, man-traps, fire-arms, or
anything else. He lives in a remote part of
the country, and all he does to ensure his
safety is to erect in front of the house a
board with the following inscription con-
spicuously painted upon it:- -
NOTICE . . .
£37- BURGLARs, THIEves, Robbers, TRAMPs,
PoliczyIPN, SERVANTs, and others, aro respect-
fully informed that every piece of PLATE used in
this establishment is
ELECTROTYPED.
The above friendly piece of information has been responded to in the
same liberal spirit; for the gentleman states, that, ever since he has
been a resident in his sº house, which, by the way, is in a very
lonely district, he has not lost even as much as a teaspoon, nor has he
been disturbed with the smallest nocturnal visit.

MY DEAR MRs. GRUNDY,
. . . THE sum of Pensions charged upon the Civil List
is limited, Madam, to £1,200 per annum. This sum repre:
sents the national liberality as exercised in the .# of
the aged scientific and literary poor, their widows, and
orphans. HENRY.CoRT's º: gets £50 a-year
out of this fund, MRS. G.; and that is about the average of
the allowances granted therefrom. Now, my dear lady, a
few nights ago, Lord HotHAM moved, in the House of
| Commons, for an account in detail of the sum of £4,625
|10s. 7d. charged in the Civil Contingencies—for what do
| you think? Robes, Madam, collars, badges, &c.; and &c.
means, I suppose, gold and silver lace, and, peradventure,
plush-for knights of the several orders. So, you see, we

THERE is a proposal to convert St. James's Palace into
a National Gallery. But, surely, if we consider the interests
of Academy students, apartments so unsuited for drawing:
rooms will make bad painting-rooms; while, if we think of
the pictures, accommodation admitted to be insufficient for
our fashionable young Misses, cannot be good enough for
our glorious §Masters.

we know how far that may
be interpreted “kept going

“The toilers on the Social
Tread-mill, at the Freema-
sons', or the Albion, or the
fondon Tavern, have at least,
the consolation of knowing
- - that the machinery they set
in motion so painfully, is grinding charitable corn, or drawing water of comfort, or working
bellows of balmy air for one or another class of fellow-sufferers elsewhere. But what are
we to say of those cases where the Social Tread-mill grinds nothing—where the weary
cylinder is kept going to no end at all but vanity and vexation of spirit—where all our
‘getting up-stairs’ leads no whither?
“How many times this season have the convicts of society been condemned to this most
heart-breaking form of the Mill—in the shape of rout, drum, soirée, conversazione, or whatever
we call those evening assemblages, when unhappy crowds are gathered together, without
aim, amusement, or gratification, except such miserable enjoyment as the sufferers may get
from the sight of each other's wretchedness? Where is the social HowARD to expose
the over-crowding, the foul air, the enforced idleness, the contagion of these drawing-room
penitentiaries? ; makes little difference whether the presiding gaoler be a duke of twenty
quarterings or a parvenu of yesterday's dunghill—whether the prison be situate in Belgravia
or in Bloomsbury. The bigger the building, as a general rule, the more painful the
punishment. Piccadilly suffers by hundreds, where Pentonville groans and gasps and
struggles by scores. The prison-fare of the one may include #. eggs and champagne,
where the other is content with rooks' eggs and gooseberry. The prison-dress of the West.
End may be moiré-antique and Honiton, when that of the North and East is barège and
machine lace; but these are minor distinctions. In the essential features of the punishment
—and excluding number—there is not a pin's point to choose between the two.
“Let me play the benevolent part of prison-visitor, at one of these sad scenes of human
woe. The night is close and sultry. Under the º sky scarcely a breath of air is stirring.
I pass along Piccadilly painfully, though the Park with its free sward and darkling trees
stretches at one side ..} me, and I can see the stars twinkling over-head. Suddenly I am
conscious of long lines of various vehicles. One string is creeping drearily, at a snail’s pace,
towards a lighted edifice. On the other side of the road empty carriages are driving more
rapidly away from the same building. It is one of our more aristocratic prisons. The
MARQUIs of CARABAs receives to-night. These are the vans setting down prisoners. The
others have delivered their freight.
“Let us make our way through these jingling, grinding wheels, these cursing, cringing
hoarse, ragged link-men, this double file of street-vice, and vagabondism which has collected
before the door to see the prisoners pass in to their place of punishment, just such a hedge
of houseless iniquity as forms about the doors of Bow Street Police Station, or the Old
Bailey, while the Central Criminal Court is sitting. Do not be afraid of the crowd and the
ºnfusion; let us enter as HowARD did, calmly confident in the nobleness of our }. Se

pompously announced. We are in the prison; in its outer-court, or vestibule, at least, for to
penetrate its inner wards—where the prisoners are—is a difficult matter, so dense is the
crowd, so insufficient the space º to the unhappy criminals. They are hitched into
doorways: they are squeezed on the steps of staircases: they are lining corridors. Don't be
surprised if you feel faint. , You will soon get used to the short supply of º and breathe
the vitiated atmosphere of these black holes of º as freely as the poor prisoners
themselves., But you may see its effect, in the pale, cheeks and dull eyes of the hardened
ºffenders, who spend most of their lives in such confinement. About the younger criminals
there is a febriſe excitement—a bravado, which resists for a while, the depressing effects
even of carbonic acid. But the time will come when they too will be as pallid, and fishy-eyed,
and limp, and feeble, and flabby, as the old social gaol-birds who have lured them hither.
“The thermometer outside stands at 84°; what it registers in this suite of rooms I dare
not guess—probably about 106°, for every cluster of lights, every, flower-stand, every
overheated piece of humanity, is giving off caloric and carbonic acid, and absorbing breathe-
able air. the prisoners had only some work to do—were it but oakum-picking or

mal-making! But, alas, they are utterly without
occupation. There is a buzz of conversation,
it is true: such conversation as is possible in a
crowd of, four bodies to a square yard on the
average; hurried greetings of old companions in
iniquity: bits of prison scandal: inquiries after
the fate of those who are missing: snatches of
what passes for wit in such societies: even a
chuckle, now and then, of that joyless laughter,
which is so profoundly melancholy. For the
most part, however, the mirth of the place stops
short at a sad stereotype smile, or grin rather,
about as like a real
smile as the agonised rictus
of a ballet-dancer.
“Oh, how tired all these poor souls evidently
are of always seeing each other's faces ! Now
and then you may see in the countenances of two
of the younger criminals—a male and a female
convict—a sudden º of genuine fellow-
and hasty
feeling: a quick loo ush, which tell
you that even in this sad place there are hearts
not altogether steeled
but the crowd bears them awa
other: or if they meet it is but for a moment,
so many eyes are upon them, so many ears open.
With the proverbial quickness of prisoners at
communication, such a couple often manage to
interchange a wonderful amount of mutual un-
derstanding, even in this press. , Attachments
occasionally grow up in this dreary prison-
house: even marriages arise out of acquaintances
formed under sentence, nay, while the pair are
actually on the Mill!
“But what is such an occasional assertion of
human feeling to leaven this huge fermenting
mass of selfishness, sin and sorrow—not the less
real that they hide under hardened masks, and
look out, shallow or shameless, from brassy eyes
and sit unblushingly on flushed cheeks? }.
not let us be unjust, though. There are as many
shades of criminality here as in Pentonville or
Milbank. But there is no distinction of age or
sex; no classification of offenders; no separation
of the hardened old sinner from the novice in
social iniquity. The innocent § fresh from
her first drawing-room, must work out her time
side by side with the old harridan hardened by
the sentences of twenty seasons. The callow
guardsman, who has not yet waxed the down on
his upper lip into the visible semblance of a
moustache, is ruthlessly condemned to associate
with the hard featured old roué who has stood in
the pillory of WHITE's bow-window every day
from three till five for the last thirty summers.
Who can wonder that the tendency of even the
young and comparatively innocent is to the same
dead level of social hollowness, unbelief, evil
speaking, evil living, idleness and frivolity, at
which these old offenders habitually live and
move and have their being? e must re-
member, too, in charity, that of these poor pri-
somers there is a large proportion who feel the
weight of their sentence severely;, who would
ive anything to be released from their enforced
idleness; to exchange this aimless, objectless toil
of the tread-mill, for honest work, however hard,
under the open heaven; who pine and pray for
: the end of that yearly recurring term of punish:
ment, which in prison-slang is called ‘the season,’
that they may get off to the country—to the
trees and fields; to the school-house, and the
village; to blessed freedom from the nightly roll
of ". prison van, the daily donning of the
prison dress, the stifling breath of the prison
air, the crush, and crowd, and dreary flatness,

“The Right Hon., &c. &c., July 11.” “Yours, Dizzy.”
July 13th, Monday. SIR Colin CAMPBELL goes out to take the
chief command in India. He could hardly have refused, for FIELD
| MARSHAL PRINCE CoNsort (in imitation of the speech of FIELD
| MARshAL THE DUKE of WELLINGTON to SIR CHARLEs NAPIER)
had said to him, “Either you must go, or I.” But sofar from wishing
to refuse, the gallant Colin was almost off before LoRD PANMURE
could telſ him he was wanted—the India Mail, was stopped at Mar-
seilles that he might catch the steamer (Scotland may like to know
that her hero started on Sunday night), and about the time, that Mr.
Punch's record is read, SIR Coin must be cutting across the desert
with all his might., Woe to the Black, Beetles when the Highland
Hedgehog gets at them!, The above information, of course, in a stu-
pider form, came out in the Lords to-night, and also in the Commons,
with the important news brought by the last mail; namely, that poor
| GENERAL ANSON had succumbed to disease, that Delhi was not t Ken,
but that the mutineers had fought, and been beaten, that more dis-
affection had manifested itself, that one way and another the Bengal
army had lost 26,000 men. -
LQRD CAMPBELL’s Immoral Publications Bill has passed the Lords,
the last discussion having been enlivened by LoRD LYNDHURST’s
telling Loºp CAMPBELL that he was such a pachydermatous peer that
he really did not know when an insulting thing had been said. LoRD
MALMEs BURY is still º about the other geese that were in St.
James's Park, although he has been repeatedly told to calm his frater-
nal feelings, for the geese are as safe and happy at Kew as he could be
at Heron Court. e took an opportunity, in the course of his
maundering against SIR. B. HALL, to call LoRD PALMERSTON a daring
and rollicking party, which LoRD GRANVILLE thought rude. LoRD
CAMPBELL brought up the Select Committee's Report as to whether

ublic . lt is recommended that they be allowed that awful
icence, provided the meeting be called by an official and responsible
person.
The Commons went into supply, and the eternal Map question came
up once more, and was discussed for a great while and to no result.
LoRD PALMERSTON's announcement that 14,000 troops had been
ordered to India, that more were to go, and that the troops on their
way to China were also to be used in India, was received with
satisfaction.
Tuesday. Nothing of consequence in the Lords except the reading of
some despatches from India.
In the Commons, LoRD GoDERICH carried a resolution affirming the
Fºl. of competitive examination for the Civil Service, and MR.
HARLES BUXTON carried an address against the African Slave Trade,
for which, LoRD PALMERSTON thanked him, and explained that Spain
was the European sinner against human liberty.
Wednesday. The Irish malcontents have defeated the Judgments
Execution Bill, justly regarding it as a new link in the chain which the
Saxon is ever seeking to rivet round the limbs of unhappy Qireland
which it unquestionably is, its tendency being to assist creditors and
prevent fraud. SIR ERSKINE PERRY's Bill, for securing the property
of married women, was read a second time, but, is doomed to mutila:
tion, if not to death. It appears to Mr. Punch that it would be as well
to legislate in this matter without exactly assuming that all husbands
are spendthrifts and tyrants, and that the best measure (and some
measure is º wanted) would be one simply enabling a
woman to obtain, in the hour of need, some such protection as she now
obtains against #. violence. Because really, as far as Mr. Punch
has seen, most husbands are inclined to be obedient and docile, and to
let their wives have quite as much of their own way as is good for
them, and the law, instead of interfering with unobjectionable people,
should provide remedies in the exceptional cases.
Thursday. LoRD ELLENBOROUGH spoke about India, and
proposed that five millions should be lent her, to aid her out of her
present difficulty. With less, generosity he mentioned that he had
* with great numbers of gentlemen connected with India,
and they all had the most thorough distrust of WERNoN SMITH,
MR. O'FLAHERTY has been turned out of the representation of
Galway, and Mr. Punch is still, more happy to state that ARCHBISHOP
MAC HALE and his clerical tail have received a signal blow, the Mayo
Committee having extruded MR. GEORGE HENRY MooRE, and having
denounced the system of spiritual intimidation by which he was
returned. The respectable Roman Catholics of Mayo must now rally
round MR. HIGGINs, who deserves all credit for dragging MAc HALE,
MooRE & Co. into the Parliamentary dock.
Mr. Roebuck then brought on an utterly useless discussion on the
Persian war, and endeavoured to get the House to “reprobate” the
conduct of LoRD PALMERSTON in not having consulted Parliament before
falling upon the Shah. Some smart *:::: took place. In the
course of the debate MR. Roebuck said that we might lose India. There
burst from the Conservative benches such an indi t “No” that
MR. Roe BUCK's own plucky heart was touched, and he declared that
it was a most “ Fº ” expression of resolution, and that he sympa-
thised with it cordially. LoRD JoHN RUssell, MR. GLADSTONE, §.
WALPOLE, and MR. DISRAELI each took a shot at old PAM, but all
stood by him on division, and MR. RoRBUCK was beaten by 352 to 38. :
Fraudulent Trustees will please to accept this intimation, that the
Bill for bringing them to book has passed the House of Commons.
Friday. LoRD BROUGHAM came out nobly in the cause of African
freedom, and against the proposed system of º: black emigrants
—true to the work which he has been doing for sixty years. LoRD
HARRowby read a letter from an African king, which showed what
were his Majesty's notions of the plan. This Anointed sovereign (whose
anointing far exceeds that of European monarchs, with their one dab of
oil, he i. himself all over everyday) writes from old Calabar Palace,
and says, in curious orthography, that no free emigrants will come, but
that he and other “gentlemen” will be happy to supply “emigrants”
at the price of four boxes of brass and copper rod perhead. An Anti-
Slavery address to the QUEEN was agreed to.
The Commons were chiefly occupied with the renewal of the
Hebrew question. The Lords having again rejected the Bill for
admitting the Jew, his friends have held meetings on the subject, and
the result is, that LQRD JoHN RUSSELL proposes to introduce a Bill,
enabling persons in all cases to take oaths in the form most binding on
their consciences, whether wearing a hat, breaking a saucer, or
kissing a volume, be the outward and visible sign that the swearer
intends a solemn appeal to Providence. He tried to bring the Bill in on
Friday; but, the §. emulous of the obstructive reputation of
the Peers, set themselves against him in array, stopped his address in
the first part of the evening, because he went to work too early, and
hours afterwards resisted ãº. because he went to work, too late.
They divided four times in favour of adjournment; and, as this process,
if pursued, is always successful, he was obliged, at four in the morning,
to give way, and announce the Bill for the next Tuesday. The Oppo-
sition game will, of course, be to postpone and protract the discussion
as much as possible, so that the measure cannot pass in, a Session
whose hours are numbered. LoRD PAIMERSTON might beat their
tactics by refusing to prorogue; but dares he ask the territorial
aristocracy to give up Grouse for Jews?
A personal row between MR. HoRSMAN and some other. Members
came on, HoRSMAN, who is Chairman of an Election Committee,
being accused of procuring its adjournment (causing expense to the
º in order that he might attend the Jew-claim meeting. He
enied, very elaborately, that he had done any harm; but another
Member of the Committee, LoRD GALWAY, declared, that had he
known why the adjournment was asked, it should not have taken place,
and HoRSMAN does appear to have rather “ managed ” the thing.
LORD PAIMERston made another demolition of the Isthmus of Suez
Canal project, explaining that the real objection to it was, that it would
give other powers *ś start of England, in the event of hostilities
in the Indian seas. The Persian War Vote was taken in Supply, an

the PREMIER declared in answer to some alarmists, that this country
was perfectly protected against any enemy that could assail her. This
is doubtless true, but everything ought not to be thrown on Mr. Punch

FAIRY-LAND.
GLIMPSE of Fairy-Land is
Sl-
% always to be had about
summer time. Sometimes
you catch it at Rosherville,
or else it breaks out with
“ten thousand additional
lamps” at Vauxhall. The
latter view, however, is very
much in the nature of a
railway break, for it very

owever, Fairy-Land does
shift about terribly...We
have known it at North
Woolwich—we have wit-
messed bright visions of it
at Shoreham – we have
heard gaudy accounts of its
dazzling wonders that have
illumined, for “positively
the last season,” the seedy
vistas of Tivoli. The two
rincipal characteristics of
airy-Land that have always
been associated in our mind
are ham sandwiches and
J. : - fireworks. We have visions
of fairies, too, dancing be-
fore our eyes. They are all dressed in white—for that seems to be
the Fairies’ favourite colour—and are º their arms and legs
about in the maddest fashion. What strikes us particularly is the
extreme, shortness of their garments, for we never saw a Fairy yet
but she had extremely short petticoats. The Fairies ſº ance
on the borders of a lake—and so, for what we know, the shortness of
their muslin garments may be a matter of prudence to prevent, the
water taking the starch too much out of their .Crinoline. Their
hours for dancing are mostly, a little before midnight. A round
silvery moon takes a delight in following their steps. It will fix its
brilliant light full upon a particular Fairy, who is reclining at full
length on a cowslip bank, and all of a sudden she will start out of
her sleep, and begin dancing playfully, backwards and forwards,
round, and round, and round again, with her shadow. What a bright
burnished silver her whole figure is . She looks as though she had
been ..º. and had come spinning spick-spam-new out of

The whole body of them dearly love dancing. Their entire life seems
one bounding entrechdiº steeped in moonbeams. Theºlº so much,
that they have no time apparently for anything else. You seldom hear
them talk. They are º women—and yet, strange to say, it is rare
indeed that you i.e.: them say a word. This preference on the part of
Fairies for the female sex is most unanimous. Who ever heard of a
Male Fairy P. If such a monstrosity ever intruded into their happy
circle, we believe, he would be pinched to death in less than five
minutes. The Fairies are º: under the command of a Queen.
You know her at once by her dancing so much better than the other
Fairies. The affection her subjects show her is very pretty. They
weave triumphal arches with their arms for her to pass under. The
cluster round her affectionately, and form picturesque groups, of whic
she is always the bright centre; and when she is about to perform a
grand pas seul, they fall into a semicircle, and look on in the most
smiling, complacent, manner. It is their nature to smile, and they will
smile º throughout an entire evening, without appearing
in the least tired. These aerial creatures float to the sound of music.
They are never without a provoking tune that sends them º: in all
directions, as though they had been bitten by so many Tarantulas.
They nearly dance their legs off, for when they have finished, they are
obliged to lean for support against a tree, or a pillar, or the door
of a house, or whatever the side-wing may be, and you see them
heaving and panting in a manner that makes you pity them. Your
pity, however, is not much needed, for after arranging the fall of
their muslin skirts, and giving themselves a shake or two, they are
ready to begin again the next minute. They delight in scarfs, and gar-
lands of roses, and sometimes they carry about baskets of flowers,
i. they scatter recklessly, pelting any beloved object that comes in
eir way.
. A certain, view of FAIRY-LAND may at the present moment be seen
in Walworth, in some Gardens that are called SURREY. The scenery
is certainly most beautiful. It is so beautiful, you could almost swear
it was painted by DANSON. You see large round, velvety mountains
swelling away into the distance, until they almost overtop the red
chimney pots of the houses at the back. There are coral caves, and
Turneresque bays, and rainbow recesses, with mossy arches, in which
the Fairies love to disport themselves. The water, too, is real, but
the Fairies are heavy, flat, and move too slowly, as though they were
worked by machinery. . They look like painted Fairies, and not like
Fairies of real flesh and blood, such as we have so often admired at
the Princess's Theatre, and other notable º of resort for the Fairy
Kingdom...It is true they look better, when lighted up about eleven
o'clock with a brilliant display of fireworks;
gossamer, lithesome, winged beauties that usually haunt a theatrical
ABODE OF BLiss. However, supposing the Fairies are not exactly
the butterfly creations of our early pantomimic recollections, still
it must be confessed that the music they float, to at the Surrey
Gardens is of the very best. When sung by a MADAME GAssier,
or a Miss DoIRy, it is so good as to justify ints: the encomium of
“What Fairy-like Music /*

“SIR,
“THANK you for that littlecutof the Organ-Fiend, dancing and
grinning as he grinds your soul out. But I write chiefly to tell you
that some of us out here, who live in a sort of cul-de-sac, into which
the organs used to come all day long (encouraged of course by the
abominable mothers and servant-girls), have hit upon a way of crippling
the rascals, without doing them any harm. We privately hire three
or four smart sharp gamins, glad to earn an homest º to keep
watch. An organ comes, and they fly to the fellow, and while one or
two dance, and chaff, and amuse him, another slips out a sharp pocket
knife and quietly, cuts the strap that holds up the organ. Next
minute the whole lot have vanished, and the brown beast is left per-
fectly helpless. The cure was soon effected, for the wretches, tell one
another everything (as where there is a sick person who will pay for
silence, or i. a man who writes will give anything for peace), and
we have not had an organ here for weeks and weeks. Recommending

One may show tremendous courage for another, and yet be a great coward for
oneself—as you will frequently see a man put his name to a Bill for a friend, who
would not, on any consideration, do it for himself.

When parents spoil their children, it is less to please them than to please them-

THE COURSE OF TRUE, &c., NEVER DID, &c.

UPON which HE HAs BEEN SITTING, HAs CAUGHT HIM ALIVE O !
A BOY’S PETITION.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“You are a jolly old chap, and a friend to boys. Now I say,
old fellow, will you just give the governor a hint not to bother us with
Latin and that, out of school hours? I don’t think it’s fair to a fellow.
Look here. I had come home on Saturday to go with the girls to see
the Frozen Deep (and capitally well it was acted too, I can tell you),
and on Monday morning we were all at breakfast. The governor was
reading the paper, and he comes to a Latin inscription to be stuck on
some hospital for the orphans of soldiers. ‘Here, Charley,” says me,
‘what’s orbas '' Well, Mr. Punch, one doesn’t remember everything
at a minute's notice, so I said, ‘worlds.” “Ah, says the governor,
in his dry way, “they are building an hospital to put worlds into
-sick worlds, I suppose. Perhaps, worlds the Comet has hit; and
so he went on, looking at, me, and the girls giggling like idiots
as, they, always do when he says anything, never mind whether
it’s good or not, of course they must laugh if the governor says it.
Presently he hands me over the paper. ºf requests me to give a free
translation of the inscription. Well, I felt sulky, and a chap oughtn't
to be asked such things when he's at breakfast; but the girls all kept
laughing, and j as if she’d like me to come off creditably;
and, as there was the º inscription below, I squinted at that for
a crib. But I was sold, for the Latin began—
“Ne quas paterni consilii
Et tutelae orbas
Reliquit mors patrum praematura
Juventute inculta,”—and so on.
and the English began about the Orphan daughters of soldiers, seamen
and marines of the realm now and henceforth. So I boggled a bit, an
then a good thought struck me, and I said that I co f give them a
general notion of the meaning, but the Latin was so shy that trans-
lation was out of the question. Well, they all laughed, and the
governor, who is not a bad fellow, saw how it was, and let me down
easy, saying he wanted the paper. But I say, wasn't it prime
when a letter came out on Thursday cutting the inscription all to
pieces, showing that ade yºf and ac was cacophonous, and the
words did not explain what class of people the hospital was for. Jolly
wasn’t it, and didn’t I cut out the letter and send it to the governoº
But this was all luck. I say, say a kind word for us, and tell the old
ones not to trot us out when we come home, that’s a good chap, as it
makes a fellow look like a fool before the girls. All of us take youin
regularly.

TURNPIKE TRICKS ON TRAVELLERS.
GENTLEMEN taking cabs from the theatres to any part of the suburbs
so far from Town that they will have to pass through two turnpikes to
reach it, are recommended to set their watches accurately at starting.
Watches thus set will be º to catch turnpike thieves. For the
first gate will clear the second, if the second is passed before 12 at
night, but not otherwise; and at the second of two gates on one par-
ticular road, Mr. Punch, from personal experience, is very much
afraid that it is customary to put the hand of the clock on at midnight
for the purpose of extorting an undue threepence. There can be no
harm done, at any rate, in seeing that your watches are true, even if
that precaution should not issue in {{...; a turnpike man false,

PUPPYISMS FOR THE DOG-DAYS.
By One who is extremely Cool.
HE Future is the Land of Pro-
mise to all such poor devils as
prisoners, exiles, bill-holders,
upers, creditors, heirs, and
overs.
Stupidity must be º
for if you notice, a witty fellow is
always less happy in the company
of fools.
Love is a heart-complaint, of
which the cure, by Jovel is fre-
uently more painful than the
isease itself.
A Coquette only jilts herself

has promised to m -
A Frenchman has two kinds of
Love—his amour and his amour-
propre. The latter is propre à tout,
and it is so called to distinguish
it from the other amour, which,
generally speaking, is propre a rien.
When you hear a drunken man
vowing temperance, you may be
sure his vows are written only in
water—effervescing water, with a
very strong proportion of brandy
in it.
Ridicule is like mud–the chap
must be clever indeed, who, let
all his ways be picked as gin-
gerly as possible, doesn't come in
for some small portion of it. Fre-
- quently those who try to avoid it
- the most, receive the most.
There are men, whose elevation in life only tends to lower them in the social scale. Their rise
! is, seemingly, from the Pit only to the Gallery.
f Love is such a beggar, that when you have given him all you have, he still goes on begging
lor more.
Too much zeal is suspicious. The man, who cries “Stop Thief '" the loudest, not unfrequently
turns out to be the Thief himself.
BLACK PLUSH.
| THE Clergy are dreadfully alarmed at the prospect of being obliged to celebrate
the marri of divorced persons, contrary to what, many of them believe to be
the rule of Christian doctrine. "Wery hard, no doubt, it is to compel them, so
to violate their consciences, and to oblige them to profane the matrimonial service,
as they must do if they read it over those who, in marrying, actually break their
marriage vows. But there is no occasion to be terrified by the prospect of being
obliged to do any such thing. They are obliged to do it already, and always have
been from the time when divorces à vinculo were first granted by the House of
Lords...The mischief is done; they have acquiesced in the wrong and the profana-
tion. Their conscience is lost, mutton and gone, goose. They Thave partaken, in
. and known it not. . As long as they had to marry none but fashionable
and wealthy sinners divorced by the House of Lords, the wickedness which they
were compelled to commit in so doing never struck them. Now that it is proposed
to oblige them to do the same office for . transgressors, separated from wife
or husband by a common tribunal, the hardship of the obligation, and the sinful-
ness of the performance, for the first time occur to them. ey remarried LADY
FITZDRAGON that was, LoRD FITZDRAGON being yet alive, to Colos El, GALLIVANT,
in unconscious innocence; but now that they see a probability of being obliged to
do as much for her that was the wife of SyſITH, but is not his widow, and her
paramour JoxEs, they are horrified at the bare idea. Surely, a very considerable
º of the clerical body should cut their cloth, and induct themselves into
plush.
The fact is, that the Reverend Gents have committed laches in this matter, and
what they qught to petition the House of Commons for is, that they may no longer
be held under that necessity of profaning the marriage service, and disobeying the
commands of Christianity, which they have so long submitted to.
FLOWERS OF FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
. A SweLL was married the other day—of course at All Swells Church; that
is to say, St. George's, Hanover Square. The case was reported, as usual in such
cases, by the Morning Post, with a description of the bride's and bridesmaids’
clothes, and the customary statement that the trousseau was of the most complete
and recherché character. It took only one parson to celebrate this “Marriage
in High Life,” as the Post called it in Flunkeyish—to buckle Swell with Belle it
generally takes two; but our fashionable contemporary informs us that—
“The bridal group having formed around the altar, the service was impressively read by the
REvghesd TALEor BAKER.”
We should like to know what the chroniclers of fashionable life mean by
sº. the service was “impressively read,” as they generally relate it to
have been on the occasion of a marriage between a couple of the superior classes.
We are very much afraid that mouthing and moaning the service is the manner
of reading it which is styled “impressive” by the journalist who describes the
trousseau as recherché.
“MERRILY WE LIVE THAT SOLDIERS BE.”
MR.PUNCH is'happy to find that the determination of the
DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE, Commander-in-Chief, to have the
expenses of the mess-table reduced, meets with, so much
approbation from the Service. Everywhere the dinners are
now conceived in a spirit of economy. Luculius, did not
roast turnips, on his Sabine farm, frugality not having been
the order of his day, but our military LučULLI are prepared
to submit to the most severe privations rather than infringe
the rule of their chief. In proof that this is no idle boast,
Mr. Punch has pleasure in subjoining the copy of the
carte at a mess-dinner recently eaten by the officers of one
of the most gallant regiments of the line.
The document, for the authenticity of which Mr. Punch
has the best possible voucher, demands the attention of
ALEXIS SoYER. The dinner, it should be mentioned,
was, the one which immediately followed the receipt of
H.R.H.'s. admonitory circular.

ECCLESIASTICAL GAMES.
A MovKMENT has been set on foot among some of the
clerical body for the revival of a pretty mediaeval pastime.
Parliamentary intelligence includes a statement that:—
“THE Bishop of Oxford presented a petition from the clergy
of the rural deanery of Oxford, º: that the use of excommu-
nication be revived, and that the burial service of the Church be not
read over persons who died out of the pale of Christianity."
The good old sport which the Oxonian ecclesiastics wish
restored, is the game of Bell, Book and Candle. Should
Parliament accede to their request, these gentle shepherds
of that Arcadian district the deanery of Oxford will
doubtless want to revive a little more of the fun of Merrie
England in the olden time, and perhaps their next request
#. the Legislature will be for the renewal of Fire and
agot.

THE MORAL OF MAYO ELECTION.
FAREwell, MR. MooRE,
At the back of the door
Of St. Stephen's I see you delighted.
I’m glad that the hope
Of the priests and the Pope,
In your loss of your seat, has been blighted.
Your priests find the plan,
To curse and to ban,
And threaten excommunication,
Is best let alone;
You’re ousted, och hone !
Because of their intimidation.
Of them there are two,
Still worse off than you,
Which my satisfaction doth double;
Their scandalous tricks
Have put them in a fix;
They’re likely to get into trouble.
So now, MooRE, begone;
A new era will dawn,
Of freedom for PAT from subjection,
To such rabid beasts,
As those pretty priests
Who tampered with Mayo Election.
A Libel on the Sex.
WE, see a book advertised under the scandalous title
of “A Wom AN's STORY.” Now it is a notorious fact
that women never do tell Stories. They may tell “a
fib” occasionally—but as for, “a Story,”, it’s a moral
impossibility. The worst is, the Story must be a thump-
ing big one, for we see by the advertisement that it

very great delinquent) ought to be ashamed of herself :
The É. on her own sex is so outrageous, that we

“FIE
QUITE A NEW CRY.
ONE of our contemporaries, describing one of the Royal visits, says
most gushingly:—
“There came into our eye an involuntary half-tear.”
We have heard many persons say that they had “half-a-mind”—we
have also heard many a person called “half-a-fool”—but “half-a-tear.”
is a decided novelty in this “Vale of Tears!” For ourselves, we little
suspected that a tear could be torn in two, like a Bank-note. Perhaps,
our crying correspondent kept the other half himself, so that the two
halves may be matched together on some future cry? or it may be,
that the other half was in the other eye; for if you notice, the poor
fellow, who fathoms his grief with such an accurate plumb line, only
alludes to one eye. We suppose a half-tear is shed when one has had
only "half-a-dinner”—or, perhaps, it appropriately occurs when one is
“half-seas over?” Anyhow, the absurdity is too “good by half” not
to be further encouraged. We hope our semi-lachrymose tear-shedder
will next favour us with expression of sorrow as nicely subdivided as
the following:—“Our bosom heaved with a three-quarter sigh,” or,
“We couldn’t well speak for the g emotion that oppressed us.”
Stooping for Strawberries.
IN some of the suburbs admission to strawberry beds, with right of
eating at discretion, may be had for ls, or 1s. 6d. These may be re-
munerative prices to ask from persons whose liberty to eat as many
strawberries as they please is accompanied by the necessity of having
to pick them. Although 1s. may be enough to demand from gentlemen
over forty, boys under eighteen should be charged 5s.
The Thing that should Bind the two Nations together.
FREDERICK PEEL, when he was taken to the Atlantic Submarine
Telegraph Company’s Office, and saw the miles upon miles of iron-wire
cable, shook his head most ominously, and a tear was observed to
steal into his manly eye, as he said in a tone of the º despon-
dency: “Ah! ah! A sad mistake—it should have been Red Tapel”
GOLDSMITH'S GOLD.
SUBscRIPTIONs for the remotest descendants of great men being now
so common, we have no hesitation in soliciting the public attention to
%.jºy who is evidently one of the posterity of the Vicar of
akefield.
She is a native of Hamburgh, and advertises that she would like
“To engage herself in a respectable English family, to teach the French and
German languages, in exchange for board and lodging, and the opportunity of
learning English.”
The eldest son of the Vicar of Wakefield went to Holland to teach
English to the Dutch, but forgot, until his arrival, that he could not
º them. The amiable young advertiser is clearly of his kith
and Klil.
Let all who have admired, the Vicar of Wakefield send their contri-
butions to Mr. Punch, 85, Fleet Street. He will take care that they
are applied with the utmost delicacy; in fact, nobody shall ever hear of
them again.
The Harrow Turn-out.
LoRD PALMERSTON, in acknowledging his health, drunk in his
original character of “a Harrow boy” at the last annual festival of
the Harrovians, declared that no other public school in the Kingdom.
had had the good fortune to turn out such men as LoRD ABERDEEN,
the EARL OF RIPON, and the late SIR Rob ERT PEEL. LoRD PALMER-
STON is modest; he did at least as much as his school to turn out two
of the three statesmen mentioned.
A Resource for Some Sovereigns.
|
PRINCE FREDERICK WILLIAM, of Prussia, was presented last week
with the freedom of the City of London.
We sincerely hope that the
husband of our Princess, at least, will never have occasion to make any
use of the rights and privileges conferred upon him in making him that
present. Some Continental monarchs would perhaps have a real boon
granted them in being empowered to set up shop, in a possible contin-
gency, within the jurisdiction of the Lord MAYöR.

JURY TORTURE.
EEPING clear of the folly
which too much disparages
ill the proverbial “wisdom of
onr ancesters,” we must
say we think that in some
of their proceedings—and
more , especially perhaps
their lº proceedings-it
cannot be denied they
showed themselves great
fools. We will not in:
stance their creation of
that famous pair of myths,
John DoE and RICHARD
Roe, for what was once
common law has given way
to common sense, and we
have now ejected from our
law courts those twin
Zº - heroes of ejectment. Nor
§sº need we speak, of their
: A. - | Jº *||\ concoction of such manifest
= Aº |- &N \ absurdities as . have been
º - R H= º Alllllllkº handed down in many of
—j =-\s º their legal maxims, such
for instance, as, the propo-
sition, that “a king can do
no wrong; ” an assertion which our railway kings, not to mention
higher potentates, are constantly refuting. We would rather cite as
one example of ancestral want of wisdom, the prescribed mºde of
treatment of non-agreeing jurors, to which our notice is directed by a
recent case in point.
What can be more absurd than locking up twelve.hungry men until
they think alike, and expecting to elicit a true verdict by starvation?
Who could give his mind to the merits of a case, and calmly weigh the
evidence in the umbiassed scales of justice, when his brain is half dis-
tracted by the gnawings of his stomach, and all that he can think of is
the prospect of his dinner? As for carefully º the facts and
robabilities which by witnesses and counsel have just been laid before
im, he feels only fit for the discussion of a beef-steak and potato. A
verdict so obtained is the result not of conviction, but of physical con-
cession. Agreement of opinion is produced by sheer exhaustion of the
powers of discussion. As confessions were extorted } the pinchings
of the thumbscrew, so, are verdicts still extracted by the º of
the appetite. Englishmen cry shame upon KING BoMBA and his
silence-cap, yet their own law sanctions even now the appliance of a
torture hardly less unbearable. We think with horror of the time
when men were forced to speak by the loading of the chest, but the
same thing still is done by emptying the stomach.
! Now we will not waste our wonder on the fact that jury torture has
outlived, the application of the thumbscrew on our countrymen.
Although a proved absurdity, and, as little in accordance with the
spirit of the age as the wearing of chain armour, or of dress-coats with
bright buttons, we cannot feel surprised that the practice still exists.
| The uncertainty of law has passed into a proverb, and in nothing is
the law more capriciously uncertain than in the manner of its bit by
bit amendments. What surprises us, however, is that lawyers do not
take more advantage of the means which jury starving offers to divert
the course of justice. It is obvious that while the lock-up system lasts,
any trial may be made with the jury a mere trial of strength ; and one
| robust and well-fed juror might starve eleven others, if in less good
plight, into certain acquiescence with his way of thinking. As a good
case may be lost through a bad constitution, }. fairly might be
challenged for looking weak or hungry; and clients might insist on
those who try their cause being put in proper training to endure con;
tinued fasting. Means too might be thought of to º concealed
refreshment, which would ensure still more a favourable verdict., A
dip into a sandwich tin could hardly pass unnoticed, but in a pinch, a
snuff-box might afford some sustenance. A furtive quid of grated beef
could scarcely be detected, even by the sharpest-eyed or sharpest-
nosed attorney; and nutrition might be taken in a grain or two of
curry powder, which, the Duke of Norfolk found so exceedingl
supporting. it would be feasible, moreover, for a juror with a cough
º ike that of Traviata, might be very easily got up for ific
occasion), to carry into, Court with him a quantity of jujubes; or he
FSA
º
might even be provided with a pocketful of portable soup, choppe
into little bits so as very readily to pass as being lozenges. In this
way, being hunger-proof, he would easily be able to hold out against
his colleagues, who to escape starvation would eventually of course be
driven to agree with him.
Knowing what we do of legal ingenuity, it surprises us, we own,
that some such hints as these have not long ago been acted on. We
ped ling public business. They would discount so many bills!
really cannot see that there would be much want of principle in putting
them in practice....“All’s fair in love,” and in law not less so; and to
gain the suit, in either case all º: are sanctioned. Besides, a
verdict now becomes the mere result of chance: depending in great
measure upon how the jury slept the night before the trial, or upon
what sort of a breakfast they have eaten. . A strong case may be |.
through the accident of some of them having a weak appetite, and a
bad night's rest must certainly conduce to the pronouncing of an un-
considered verdict. It seems to us, therefore, that what we have
. would reduce to a system what is at present chiefly chance:
and moreover, it would have the further merit of mitigating somewhat
the ordeal by famine to which every juror is at present subject. On
which account we cannot but expect by the next post an official inti-
mation from the heads of the Humane Society that they intend forth-
with to invite us to a dinner, and present us with a medal for our
merciful suggestions for the relief from hunger-torture of all non-
agreeling Jurles.

DR. ALDIs writes thus to the Times :—
“I venture . . . to call your attention to the open state of the King's scholars'

The doctor, proceeds to describe the subject of his complaint as
emitting an “intolerable stench.” For one street in the metropolis,
Lupus. Street is appropriately, if not happily, named, because Lupus is
not only Latin for wolf, but is also the nosological term for an affection
of the olfactory organ.

THE FOOL’S HEAD OF HAIR.
FROM the advertising columns of a contemporary, we extract the
following rather comic appeal to the vanity of simpletons:—
O MORE GREEN, RED, OR PURPLE-DYED HAIR.—Notice.—
Any Lady or Gentleman who has been so unfortunate as to have their hair
dyed any of the above-named colours now so common, by the use of spurious imita-
tions of 's TYRIAN Liquid HAIR DYE, can have it restored, free of charge, to
a native brown or black to defy detection, by applying at his Subscription Hair-
Cutting and Hair-Dyeing Rooms, – —. Hair and whiskers dyed on the most
reasonable terms by an annual subscription. Price, per case, 5s. 5d., 8s., 12s., and
1 guinea.
We suspect that our friend, the proprietor of the “Tyrian liquid
hair dye,” must have been induced to distinguish it with the splendid
epithet connecting it with the city of Tyre, by the recommendation of
some classical wag who wished to hoax him. he had known with
what colour Tyrian is synonymous, he would have called a dye intended
to transmute that colour Anti-Tyrian. The imitations of a dye truly
Tyrian can hardly be spurious if they really turn hair purple: and we
cannot understand the kindness of the advertiser in offering gratuitous
remedy to the victims of impostors who counterfeit his invention.
If it is a fact that green, red, and purple are now, in consequence of
the use of hair-dyes common colours of human hair, it is a melancholy
fact; for the contents of that head whose exterior has become dis-
coloured by any artificial Fº must be very scanty or very weak.
In fact, we consider dyed hair to be one indication of softening of the
brain, the consequence of inflammation of that organ. We regard the
mere idea of using hair-dyes, as a symptom of incipient phrenitis, and
advise all persons beginning to feel dissatisfied with the colour of their
hair, to get their heads shaved. They will thus procure removal of the
outer complaint and relief of the inner disorder at the same time.

of advice in the following new words;–
“Let not MR, RUSKIN

we must request that he will not attempt to carrymore canvas than that
which he understands. Fine Art is a fine thing; but the reality of
Liberty is much to be preferred to any statue or picture, or any num-
ber of pictures or statues, of anything in Heaven or Earth. Liberty

presentations of leaves, and flowers, and bark, and pebbles, and
excrescences on the extremity of the human nose, are admirable
things in their way, but we trust that Britons will ever regard
them as matters of infinitely less consequence than Representative
Institutions.
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.
MR. PUNCH has an announcement to make which will burst upon ||

PHOEBE AND THE PICNICS.
__* sº-sº ====
Now all you young folks, hear this story of mine,
'Tis the tale of Miss DARBY and HAL #ºr,
And the he or the she who the warning despises
Like them may show up at the Summer Assizes.
'Tis now two years back, when as blooming as HEBE
She went to a pic-nic, the beautiful PHOEBE, .
And who cut her chicken, and poured out her wine,
O, who but young HENRY, the bold HAZELDINE *
To see was to love her : to see him, to love.
But this was no match that’s constructed above:
For her father º: and kicked up a shine
At the thought of her marriage with young HAZELDINE.
But PHOEBE was plucky, and stood by her HAL,
º: her papa, like a true-hearted gal; -
And wrote him sweet letters, and soon did begin
Rehearsing the conjugal grab at the tin.
Her heart being open, it gushed like a founting, -
She wrote for ten pound and for “kisses, past counting,”
And, amid her affection, of business still heedful,
Again in her postscript she asked for the needful.
In October that followed, she fancied her shape
Would be nicely set off by an elegant cape,
But Pa, being stingy, allowed her to pine
So for “ten .#or twenty” she asked HAZELDINE.
Once more, it appears, she appealed to the purse
Qf him she was pledged to, for better for worse;
And concluded a letter both kindly and clever, .
With the statement that PHOEBE “remained, his for ever.”
The marriage was fixed, and the bridesmaids were caught,
And PHOEBE’s sweet dresses were chosen and bought;
But Love’s a queer boy, and he cuts rummy capers,
And why did he send her to WERNON, a draper's?
And why did he cause at a pic-nic to rally
Some folks in the . Habberley—Valley,
And why to make wretched poor HAZELDINE’s lot,
Was PhoeBE invited and HAZELDINE not?
And why (O you Cupid, you ought to be stamped on,)
Did PHEBE encounter one SAMUEL HAMPTON,
And who poured her wine out, and who sliced her ham,
O, who but the Rival, the conquering SAM P
The Hazel.DINE star from that hour became pale,' .
HAMPTON Court-ing's so pleasant, 'tis sure to prevail;
And HENRY, thrown over, deplored, with a tear,
The loss of a wife with £100 a-year.
Not long with a tear his distress did he bear,
For the witnesses prove him accustomed to swear;
And he goes to old HAMPION's, Miss DARBY to meet,
And he uses bad words, which I shall not repeat.
And he acts very coarse, and a chain that did deck
Qur pretty young PHOEBE, he tears from her neck,
And in struggle unmanly he makes her hands bleed,
And (I’m sorry to write it) he bids her be d’d.
She pays back his loans, to the utmost, poor lamb,
And straightway she weds the affectionate SAM;
When HENRY the wrathful, whose rage grew more grim,
Brings an action for breach of her promise to him.
'Twas tried down at Worcester by one you can’t bam well,
That excellent, keen-sighted Judge, BARON BRAMwFLL.
If ever I’m tried, being innocent, O !
May B. be my Judge; but if guilty,+why, no.
And HAZELDINE’s brief fell to one, who in muddle's tone
Spoke never, the winning and elegant HUDDLEston,
And could tactics have managed the merits to smother,
One H. would have carried the verdict for t'other.
But the HAZELDINE star, as aforesaid, was pale,
And no HUDDLESTON º: then could prevail,
For the case came out badly, as badly could be,
When witnesses came, called by SKINNER, Q.C.
And down came JUDGE BRAMwell, like Cedron in flood,
And trampled the case of the R. to mud;
Called his conduct, as proved, both unmanly and mean,
And the action the weakest his lordship had seen.
Then the jury looked happy at getting their cue
From the Judge on the bench, so should I, would not you?
And quickly agreeing, of concord made sign,
Refusing one farthing to fierce HAZELDINE.
And that is my story. I know we shan’t quarrel
If I venture to leave out the evident moraſ:
Let’s hope that H. H. will get mild, and a wife,
And PHOEBE and SAMUEL be happy for life.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 20, Monday. LORD CAMPBELL, ever eager to rout up the poor
CHANCELLOR, gave him notice to be ready next night upon the Jew
question. The Thames mud, was put into the hands of the Lord
Mayor by 44 to 5, and a Bill for making the Liverpool corporation
apply the Mersey dues to their original object, the improvement of the
harbour, was carried by 23 to 15, the outcry, usual when robbery or
jobbery is assailed, being raised about the rights of private property.
Government has allowed, so much chattering in the Commons, that
it is now necessary to throw over the Savings Banks Bill. MR.
BENTINck complained that the country was not adequately defended,
and that LoRDPALMERSTON was neither omniscient nor even omnipotent,
also that no one could say what might happen in the next few weeks.
There was some desultory talk on all these propositions, and PAM
assured the House that, as far as he saw, all was serene, and that he
was sending 20,000 men, of all arms, to India. , A dull debate on the
Chinese war followed, and SIR. C. WooD seemed rather to take credit
to the Government for that war, as it had caused troops to be sent to
China, which troops were collared, en route, and would be most useful
in India. On the Wills Bill debate the persevering BETHELL made
another but an indirect attempt at the limitation of country probate,
but the Committee would not hear of it, and he had to abandom his
clause. The Chelsea New Bridge Bill (the Bridge to Battersea Park)
was read a second time. It imposes no tolls on foot-passengers, but
it is thought that those who can afford vehicles can afford the two-
pence to go over.
Tuesday. LORD ST. LEONARD's introduced a plan for simplifying, as
he called it, the title to real property, but at best, (Punch s with all
deference to the preternatural conveyancing knowledge of the author of
Wendors and Purchasers), his reforms are mere tinkering, and what is
wanted is a system cognate to that on which the Éncumbered Éstates
Courts in Ireland sell a title that is good against all the lawyers in and
out of Pandemonium.
CAMPBELL catechised CRAN worth touching the Jew penalty case,
but got a very short answer. The L. C. J. impressively warned the
House of Commons against trying to seat a Jew by resolution, as it
would expose him to penalties which he, CAMPBELL, would assuredly
enforce, and then, if the Commons sent him to Newgate or the Tower,
“he hoped the people would rise in his defence.” BRough AM, also
trusted that the 8. would attempt nothing of the kind. It
CAMPBELL should wish to hide himself, for a time, from the fury of the
WOL. xxx III.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Commons, let him come to 85, Fleet Street, where he shall be safe
against aii comers; and we would not give much for the seat of the
mether garment of the Serjeant-at-Arms after Toby shall have been
ap j of his unconstitutional errand. - - - - -
oRD JoHN_Russell moved for leave to bring in his device for
seating M. DE Rothschild. It was, of course, opposed vigorously by
the Conservatives, but on division, triumphed by 246 to 154, majority
92, at the announcement of which numbers the º began
shouting, because 92 is a smaller number than 140, the majority by
which the ºaths. Bili was carried. Meantime the BARon takes the
Hundreds (it must seem a paltry operation to one who ordinarily takes
the thousands) in order to re-election by the City. The old attempt to
get at, agricultural statistics is revived, but MR. CAIRD’s Bill is not
compulsory. The B. F. is to give you information, if he likes.
ºff. The LoRDs have inserted a clause in the Great Northern
Railway Bill, making the “preference.” Shareholders as liable as the
common ones to bear the losses occasioned by REDPATH's swindling.
The Commons struck it out, on the principle, that the rights of the
preference people were sacred. MooRE, of Mayo, being ejected from
the House, his Sham, the Tenant Right Bill, followed him, to-day.
Thursday. CRANNY, wishing to show that he could say some-
thing, came out with a bit of Latin. Interest reipublicae ut sit finis
Lilium. This was the satisfactory answer to a poor man who was
utterly defrauded of justice by the last Chancellor's having delayed
judgment for fifteen months, and then giving it, in forgetfulness, in an
| opposite direction, on an important point, to that in which he had
decided at the hearing. The unhappy petitioner will probably translate
CRANNY’s Latin, “It’s for the }.. of the Public that judges
should Sit and Finish, even if they’re obliged to order Lights.”
BROUGHAM brought in a Bill for * the Bankruptcy Laws, the
chief use of which seems to be (like that of a gentleman's country
house) to “make improvements” therein.
The Superannuation Swindle came up at the morning sitting, and
MR. WILSON laboured vehemently, and with a profuse expenditure of
º: to show that the civil servants had no ground for complaint.
He, however, remarked that by new taxation, the salaries might be
increased, a piece of impertinence which is not likely to be ºften
by MR. Wilson's devoted admirers." The debate was adjourned.
The miserable-looking device which is given to English Military
Members of the Qrder of the Bath was unfavourably contrasted with
the Silver Star given to the French decorés, and LóRD PALMERstoN
thought there might be improvement. The evening was devoted to
discussion on Money Votes, and the Government fenced and shuffled
with questions as to the site for the National Gallery, LEwis saying
he had, not seen the Commissioners' Report, and GREY that he had
not had time to read it. MR. CoNINGHAM pledged himself to expel
#. ºal Academy next year, unless Government saved him the
trouble.
Friday. LORD RAVENsworth complained of the metropolitan toll-
gates. Most of them, he said, were in the hands of one LEvy, a
jew. who as his Lordship wittily remarked, Levied contributions on
travellers. He was about to make other epigrams, such as that this
check upon gadding about showed that the tribe of LEVI hated the
tribe of GAD, and so on, but LoRD GRANVILLE stopped him, promising
that the subject should receive an attention not merited by the jokes.
LORD FORTESCUE then demanded that Government should erect a
monument to LORD RAGLAN. LoRD PANMURE thought that precedent
WaS º: to the erecting º: monuments to any naval or military
man who was not slain in battle. It is difficult to read such trash
with patience. LQRD RAGLAN was as much killed in the discharge of
his duty as any of the heroes who died in the Balaklava charge. We
can almost excuse LoRD DERBY, for having lost his temper, and, for
the sake of annoying PANMURE, having aggravated him into petulance,
and then scolded him for being petulant, as he did, after which the
DUKE QF BEAUrQRT reminded the Lords that LoRD PANMURE had
always behaved ill to LORD RAGLAN, and so the matter ended.
A thousand and eighteen electors of Oxford city voted for WILLIAM
THACKERAY, but as many, and sixty-seven more, having supported their
old Member, M.R. CARDwell, the latter took his seat this evening.
MR. DISRAELI refused to wait until the next Indian mail should arrive
before discussing the Indian question, being justifiably afraid that the
probable arrival of good news might give Government an advantage.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER stated that Government was
not bound to carry out º one of the prize designs for Public Offices,
and would do nothing in the matter this Session. We hope, however,
that the º will be at once handed over to the gallant
(drawing) Boarders. The Divorce Bill was then moved, for second
reading, and MR. HENLEY opposed its coming on this Session, ;
mentioning among other reasons that 6000 Clergymen had petitioned
against it. We attach, their due weight to professional petitions
º alteration in established forms, and remember that thousands
of Attorneys petitioned tº: County Courts. SIR. G. GREY saw
no reason for delay, the Bill having been º discussed. MR.
GLADSTONE felt no difficulty as to the principle of the Bill, and there-
fore, with Gladstonian logic, deprecated its being proceeded with, as
did MR. Bowy ER, for the Catholics. LoRD JoHN MANNERs justly
remarked that marriage was an Awful thing. LoRD STANLEY thought
that the objection of the Clergy was not so much to divorce as to their
having to marry divorced people, which was a generous but Quixotic
defence of those whom Lord ALBEMARLE declared to be grossly
ignorant persons. The Crown lawyers and those who desire to be
such, had a set-to, the noticeable point whereof was SIR. R. BETHELL’s
calling the attention of the House to the fact, that MR. GLADSTONE
hº a good deal in jº. and then PALMERSTON apprised the
ouse that the Bill should be proceeded with, late as was the period
of the Session, adding that he remembered sitting until the middle of
September. After these terrible words, it is not surprising that MR.
HENLEY was defeated by 217 to 130, and that the Second Reading was
ordered for the following Thursday.

AMONG other items of recent intelligence, we find it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
| Brentwood, granddaughter of the late WILLIAM WARREN, Esq., Hampden House, near Romford, niece of the
A NOAH'S ARK OF A HEART.
LORD RAYNHAM must have a
heart as big as a Noah's Ark.
It seems devoted, also, to a
somewhat similar purpose.
All things that bark, bray,
bleat, grunt, crow, scream
whistle, or cackle, are allowed
to take shelter in it. All ani-
mated creatures that fly, leap,
swim, burrow, climb, or crawl,
were to have been taken in by
it. It was a kind of legisla-
tive Humane Society for the
whole animal kingdom. Ac-
cording to his Bill for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, you would not have been
able to have had a lobster
boiled for supper. All the
fish-shops in the Haymarket
would have had to #. up
their shutters; for under the
enactments of his Lordship's
maudlin measure, we doubt if
it would have been safe for
any man to open an oyster.
It is equally doubtful whether
tee should not have laid ourselves open to its penalties every time we had the cruelty to
quizz Wiscount WILLIAMs. -
However, there is not the toss-up of a doubt that the Bill would have had the effect of
entirely sweeping away the Zoological Gardens. Poor MR. MITCHELL! he would not have
had so much as a Cobra left him to play with. You have no right, says our sensitive lord,
to keep any animal under confinement, so as to irritate him. What, then, is to become
of all the bears, lions, tigers, and boa constrictors that are confined in their cages in the
Regent's Park? What are you to do with the rhinoceros ? How are you to get over the
two hippopotami? Are they all, to be let loose upon the neighbourhood P or must you
destroy them P But here, again, is another difficulty; for LoRD RAYNHAM says, you have
no right to inflict pain on any living creature. However, there is no more chance of the
Bill passing, than there is of the Master of the Mint passing a bad shilling; so our cooks
need not alarm themselves at the prospect of being taken up for smashing a blackbeetle.
. The Animals’ great friend has, hitherto, been MR. Richak D. MARTIN., Lord RAYNHAM
is a worthy successor, for we should say that the clauses of his absurd attempt at legis-
lation must have been written under the ocular and jocular supervision of MR. MARTIN’s
Elizabethan namesake—the celebrated Miss BETTY MARTIN. The Bill can only have been
the result of the wildest outbreak of animal spirits, and the next time his Lordship tries to
take the bull by the horns, he must do it with a less cruel hand, or else he will infallibly
find himself stuck on the horns of a dilemma, by being the first person punished under his
own enactment. For his overweening sympathy for bºasts, we can only say, in the borrowed
words of a Frenchman, that it is:—“Béte/—très Béte/—tout ce qu' iſ y a de plus Bete /*
“HERE WE ALL ARE l’”
THESE marrying people give us a great deal of trouble. The other day we jº.
to offer opinions upon no fewer than six matches in high life, on which the Morning Post
consulted us. (By the way, the footman, who told the Post that LQRD CASTLERossº, was
going to marry a certain lady, humbugged our contemporary, as the latter has been obliged
to, own in penitence and tears.). Now we find thrust under our superhuman nose the
following hº of a marriage in humble life:–
“On the 14th inst at Shenfield, Essex, by the Rev. C. J. York. Rector, MR. ALFRED BART.on, Auctioneer
and Estate Agent, Nottingham, to CHARLotte, eldest daughter of Thomas BART.on, Esq., Windbarns, near
late JAMES WARd, Esq., Willey Park, Farnham, Surrey, and cousin to Thomas SANctuary, Esq., late High
Sheriff for the county of Sussex, the late HoN. LADY STANHoPE, and LIEUT.-GEN. Ezrkial BART.on, of the
First Native Infantry of the Hon. East India Company."
As Hamlet says, “what imports the nomination” of all these people? Why has this
respectable auctioneer presented the public with this catalogue of his wife's relations, lumped
in one Loí; What or earth have we to do with them?" The problem, combined with the
heat, disturbed us so much, that we took off our coat to consider the case more, deeply, but
we can arrive at no satisfactory conclusion. It certainly occurred to us that the advertisement
was a delicate way of hinting to various persons that they might send in wedding presents.
But it is not an ordinary custom for deceased parties to perform this act of politeness
and generosity, and no fewer than three of the people enumerated are defunct. Well,
then we fancied that the advertisement might be a burst of pride and glory on the part of the
auctioneer, who might exult in alliance with the aristocracy. But auctioneers are usuall
smart men, and know that connection with an Ex-Sheriff and a General of Sepoys is no suc
marvellous thing for a prosperous man of business (which we hope BARTON is) to make a
fuss about. Lastly, and this is only a guess, and may be all wrong—is the bride's family
“highly genteel”, and opposed to commercial pursuits, and has the lady had more sense
than all her friends, and is this the bridegroom's pardonable taunt to the Stuck-ups? If so,
we applaud BARTON, and we hope it is so, because we really see no other excuse for the
publication of such a string of names at the end of a wedding announcement.

THE BURIAL OF BERANGER.
AH, BéRANGER, you brave old singer,
Of all the things you hated worst,-
That felt your lash's lustiest stinger,
Tyrant and Jesuit were first.
At Jesuitry, whate'er its robe,
Kingly or Priestly, still you scoffed :
Stabbed it with laughter round the globe,
Exposed each mask it donned or doffed.
Imprisoned under CHARLEs THE TENTH,
Imprisoned under “MR. SMITH ; ”
Your pen but gathered greater strength,
More salt, more gall, more point and pith.
Then came the days of 'Forty-Eight:
Grown wiser still as you grew older,
You stepped not out to serve the State,
But only shrugged the coldest shoulder.
Smiling beside your modest fire
At poets grey, turned statesmen green:
Heard Hugo vent rhetoric ire,
And sighed o'er poor old LAMARTINE.
You saw the social bubble burst,
As kingly ones had burst before;
But still your green old age you nurst,
And poked your fire, and shut your door
Against the nephew of the man
Whom in your youth you made a God:
By whose triumphal car you ran :
Your Attila—Heaven's scourging rod.
The nephew had giv'n gold for laud,
Hard francs for flattery’s hollow ring;
But his mixed reign of force and fraud
Was not the reign that you could sing.
So, while you lived, you sat aloof,
As one late-fall'n on evil days.
Equally fear and favour-proof:
Not venting blame: not feigning praise.
Defiant thus you died: once dead,
Alas, the nephew has his way.
Presumes to crown the lifeless head,
Which, living, frowned his hand away.
And, bitterest lot, old bard, for you,
Scarce cold, they earth your hurried bier,
With hollow show of honours due,
That serve to mask the tyrant’s fear.
“Mournful and Patriotic rites!”
Sabres and bayonets line the way:
The flag, that graced the Uncle's fights,
Droops sadly o'er your captive clay.
Jesuit and Despot, both in one,
Usher you to your hasty grave.
Sad closing of a course so run—
Death that frees most, makes you a slave!
Making Game of a Friend.
“WELL, what do you say to the Lords' di-

“FROM my own social experience I should be inclined to say that
‘a little music’—like ‘a little knowledge’—is “a dangerous thing.’
I suppose we shall all agree that of the many varieties of the evening:
party-punishment, none can well be more severe than that to which
one is sentenced by a card, with the apparently innocent word
“Music” at the bottom of it. Let me enumerate the different in-
flictions of social torture included in this insidious dissyllable.
“Imprimis. It means crowding four hundred people, of both sexes
and . ages, into a space sufficient to accommodate about half the
number.
“Secondly. It means that all these four hundred unfortunates are to
be planted in chairs, so placed, that not one of the four hundred can
get up without disturbing all the rest—Like WoRDsworth’s cloud, the
mass must ‘move all together, if it move at all.”
“Thirdly. It means, either, enduring trash vocal or crash instru-
mental, which it is pure waste of time, and degradation of human ears,
to listen to, or
“Fourthly. Heating sweet melodies and noble harmonies under con-
ditions of discomfort and distraction, which utterly destroy the
exquisiteness of the one, and the grandeur of the other.
-- § It means conversation prevented.
“Sixthly. It means confining one's view of the ladies to their back-
hair, or the floral and leguminous ornaments which embellish the
female nuque now-a-days.
." Seventhly. It implies, in nine cases out of ten, an insufferable
display either of amateur impudence, or artistic mediocrity.
“Eighthly. It shows JoHN BULL in some of his most offensive
phases of snobbishness, and purse-pride.
“Ninthly. It is tedious.
“Tenthly. It is costly.
“And to conclude, it encourages bad music;, keeps up the mis-
chievous delusion that the English are a musical nation; and #. Over

musical appreciation there may be in this audience—what musical
utterance there may be in the soul, or throat, or fingers of these
vocalists or instrumentalists—finds no outlet in this place under these
conditions. The man who bought Punch from the puppet-show-man

pine-apples, and plate and pictures, are types and symbols of wealth

“There have been times when England was musical. But they

his viol or crowd, the milk-maid to the birds over her pail—when
music was a part of every man's education and of every woman's
accomplishment.
“Fou musical! You might as well call the Mussulman fond of
dancing, when he hires his troop of Alméhs, or Ghawazies, or the
Hindoo, with his Nautch-girls rattling their bangles before his lazy
eyes.
“There can be no music on these terms of a crowded and uncomfort-
able audience in front of the piano, and a batch of hired singers,
sulky and separate, behind it. It is at best a weary, dreary, serving up
of operatic scraps—a meal of musical broken meat, flung as con-
temptuously to those who sit down to it, as the orts of yesterday's
table are flung to a crowd of beggars at a rich man's door. Music
demands for its real enjoyment, ample room, silence, genuine inter:
communion of performers and listeners. It is the most social and
select of all amusements, in its minor forms. In its grander ones it is
the most passionate of all utterances of emotion, or the most sublime
and awful of all acts of worship. - -
“I understand a part-song of MASTER, WILLBYE's in Elizabethan
days. I_understand the Winedressers' Chorus in an Italian grape-
ground. I understand the rude round in the forecastle of an Indiaman,
or the chant that times the heaving of the anchor in a North country
coaster. I understand the lyrical swing, and passion of the Opera,
heard from a curtained-box, with room för one's legs, and a pleasant
companion opposite. I understand the Hundredth fºam. rung from
the thousand children’s throats under the dome of St. Paul's. I under-
stand BEETHoveN at Exeter Hall, or HANDEL at the Crystal Palace.
All these are music. But I do not, and I #. Heaven, I never, may
understand, your drawing-room concerts. There is weariness in them :
there is vanity in them: there is money-power in them. But music
there is not.”
WIGGY-CUM-COCKY.
HE Women of Bristol, once
upon a time – there is no
harm in mentioning it now,
—were so singularly unfa-
voured by the deity who con-
fers the gift of Beauty (we
apologise for not maming her,
but our Lemprière has been
borrowed by a contributor to
the Saturday Review), that in
order to help them to those
necessaries of feminine life—
husbands, it was decreed that
the freedom of the City of
Bristol should be given to any
man who would go into con-
º slavery with a Bristol
girl. Now, of course, a Bris-
tolian would toss you over ST.
AUGUSTINE’s Back, or into
the Severn, did you assert
that the ladies of the place
- are not perfect angels.
- We, even did not truth and
# gallantry forbid it, should
scorn to advance any allega-
tion against the loveliness of
Bristol. The city of the mar-
vellous Boy produces marvellous girls. But there is another town in
whose favour we are disposed to think some such matrimonial bait will
one of these days be wanted. This town is, Leicester. , We, say it
sorrowfully; for we had good hopes of a city that, at the last election
turned out a very pretentious and useless personage, SIR. Josh UA
WALMsley. The Leicester women, however, seem to lack the brains
of their lords and masters. - -
The other day we read that the women of Leicester, in flat defiance
of their duty to their superiors who had ejected Joshua, went to that
individual with an address, in order to console him. They had perhaps
heard from CowPER (though it is doubtful whether such fast females
could condescend to read a mere virtuous, namby-pamby, moral writer)
that—
“The tear that is wiped with A little Address,
May be followed, perchance, by a smile.”
This little Address qught to have cheered Joshua, who was himself
proverbial for the little address with which he took up any political
question. But, not satisfied, the Leicester Women have been holding
a º the Town Hall, in favour of Woman's Rights.
MRs. WoodFoRD was in the chair, and MRs. CoCKAYNE, MRs.
WIGFIELD, and MRs. KING, were the principal speakers. It is stated in
the report, that though the active people in the matter were of the
humbler class, the ladies of Leicester promoted the movement. The
account of what WooDFORD, Cocky, and KING said is brief, but
MoTHER WIGGY came out astonishingly. She set forth that woman
was taken from man's rib to show her equality with him, and that had
he been meant to trample on her, she would have been taken from
his foot. , This is highly superior logic, but why was she not taken
from his head, to make the equality still more clear? Equal provision
was made for her, MRs. WIGGY says, in the Ark. This is true, but
we, are unacquainted with any evidence to show that NoAH's wife
and female relatives did not dust up the Ark and keep it tidy, offices
which the Orientals have an old habit of confiding, to their women.
WIGGY also complained that though MIRLAM was allowed to go about
with a timbrel, “our women are not permitted to speak in public.”
This, we admit, is a grievance, but as regards MRs. WIGFIELD, we do
not see any objection to her †† about with a tambourine, if the
musical instrument-sellers find any difficulty in supplying her with a
timbrel. Evidently, some such occupation is her mission. She then
denounced Primogeniture. How the law of primogeniture interferes
with woman's interests is not clear, inasmuch as if MRs. WIggy has
sisters, and an estate devolves on her and them, they will all take
alike, by the rules of descent. But the arrangement by which one
child is born after another, is, we admit, a question for the ladies, and
if they can settle it in any other way than at present, we see no
objection. -
ut the grand allegation, and that which the meeting chiefly cheered
and relied upon was this: “Woman is man’s equal in everything—
EXCEPT Physical strength.”
OWIGGY! Q Cocky 1, O all you women of Leicester, and every-
where else, will you kindly consider, only for a minute, what this little
extra ; of Physical Strength, of which you speak so lightly, means,
and what are its responsibilities?. It means, getting up every morning,
whether you like it or not, working one's hardest at what work one
can get, pleasant or hateful, fighting for the pay thereof, beating off all
who would touch that pay, and taking it home to buy food and clothes
for you and your children. It means building the houses you live in
the *. you ride in, the steamers you go pleasuring in, an
being fined, imprisoned, or transported, if the houses fall, the car-
riages run off lines, or the ships go down. It means #.
and sowing and reaping, that you may have bread for puddings j
poultices. It means sailing the ocean to fetch you tea to chatter over
and silk to flirt in. It means paying your debts while one can, an
when one can't, going to prison for 'em. It means keeping you, from
wedding-ring to coffin-rings, and being scoffed at by the world, and
kicked at by the law, if, during that period, one neglects the work.
This is a little of what Physical Strength means—that little exception
to perfect equality. And O'Cocky QWIGGY! O all of you! we areyery
happy that it should be so, if you will just dust up our Arks, and keep
them tidy, comb the hair of our little children, and sometimes see to a
button. Come, girls, come, it’s not a hard bargain for you after all.
But catch us marrying a leicester woman—at least unless Leicester,
female, repudiates the ...WIGGY-cum-Cocky demonstration.... Let
Leicester get a name for this sort of thing, and its spinsters will find
it no easy matter to get any other names than those they now wear.
The Mayor will have to bait the trap with freedoms.

want, and 'specially in her
character of authoress of
the only one of her works
which #. Punch has had
º **i. º }.
okery for Manas Qſ Att-
Work. Come here, Mºm,
and don’t be frightened.
You have tried to do a
good thing, and you have
succeeded, M'm.
We picked up your book
at a railway station, and
desire to see it at all rail-
way stations. The Address
gave us good hopes of
you. You do not apologise
to genteel people for writing a book to folks who keep but one
servant, but you begin boldly:-"Much of the comfort of nume-
rous...households depends upon that very useful person, the Maid-
of All-Work”. You proceed to show howeverything is expected from
her, and nothing is taught her, or how a cookery-book, prescribing
expensive processes, described in inexact language, is given her for her
discomfiture and for quarrels with her mistress, and how she blunders
through servitude *... the blundering wife of a poor man, whom
she will always keep poor. Then, Mºm, you set to work to help her
and her mistress also, and you give, in plain language, and with
practical advice, instructions for some thirty dinners, to the preparation
whereof comes in almost every article likely to be cooked for the class
that employs the Maid-of-AllWork. You will observe, MRs. WARREN,
that we have read your book. -
Your book is by no means perfect, M’m, and before it reaches a third
edition (our copy is from the second) you will be good enough to go
carefully through every page, and revise it. For instance, Mºm, in the
Boiled of Mutton dinner, you are pleased to observe, “Weigh the
mutton, place it in scalding water enough to just cover, it; after it
bubbles, allow a %. of an hour to every pound it weighs, and eight
minutes to every half pound.” What do you mean, woman? At this
rate, a leg of six pounds must be boiled six quarters of an hour and
ninety-six minutes...You don’t mean that, dear lady? At least, if you
do, don’t ask us to dine with you off your Boiled Leg.
the Peas and Boiled Bacon dinner, MRs. WARREN, you remark,
“Another way of dressing peas, and where there are children they go
much farther,” &c. How much farther do the children go? And
farther, from what? From the table? Then, you know, they drop
their orts on the carpet, and when getting down, tread the mess into
it. You should tell the Maid to push their chairs close up to the
table–Eh? You meant that peas go farther. We beg your pardon.
Don’t let us catch you putting common vinegar into the salad, as
º at page 33, that’s all. --- -
e applaud your politeness even to a pig. “Send with it to the
baker's a quarter pound of butter, and request it to be frequently rubbed
with this.” No pig of good breeding could refuse a request so urged.
And it is a yely od reason for cutting up, before sending * boiled
rabbits, that “otherwise they look somewhat like cats.” The same
thought occurred to us at a Parisian restaurant, last year, while eating
a pseudonymous cat, disguised as a rabbit. “A table-spoonful of
Browning to the calf's head soup” (p. 51) may be tried, but we never
found that gentleman's writings at all suited to a calf's head.
Fresh as a country girl's song comes the Boiled Mackarel receipt.
“April and May, when the fennelis springing,”—why, MRs. WARREN,
you are a poetess yourself. MRs. BRowNING (darling of the above,
and of us) might have written–
“April and May is the time for this fish,
W. the º the Fennel is springing,
Put into hot water (some salt) and then dish,
When the fourth of an hour has elapsed—I could wish
No boiling—but simmering and singing;
And O for the sauce-boat (there's no rhyme but Pish 1)
Where Fennel and Butter lie clinging."
You may”have these beautiful lines for your next edition, Mºm,
welcome as the flowers of mackarel month.
of Af
About Scalloping Oysters, M’m... You would lead a stupid girl intº
a blunder for which an Irish oyster eater of a hasty temper would
very justifiably throw her out at the window of his apartment. You
say, “Take of the beards, set them in a dish or tin, rub crumbs over
them,” &c. Pray, be quick with a new edition, ere some wretched girl
fall a victim-remember, oysters are all but in.
. “Where children are.” A simple phrase, but one with immense
significance, and we are i. to see it occur very often in your
1n º with advice how to render eligible for the olive-branches
the dish of which, you are treating. Specially, we note on p. 29 the
hint that suet pudding will please and satisfy them more than bread.
ter a good help of the former article, we certainly believe that the
affectionate remonstrance, “More? why, my dear, you must have got
a wolf inside you,” will be superfluous.
..Well, Mºm, we don't know that we need detain you. We have
picked a few holes in your book, but as KING PEDRo said to MARIA
DE PADILLA, when he had gone and married somebody else, “it all was
for thy good.” Let us add that your gossip with young mistresses is
very sensible, but you should give some more of it, and in as te
book...This one is for the Maid, and your preface might set her
educating her Mistress, a salutary process, no doubt, but one which
from what we have observed of lady-temperament, is not calculated
to promote long connection between the parties.
d now, Mºm, we have said our say. Knowing how much domestic
comfort has to do with domestic morals, Mr. Punch aids any effort to
teach qur women, of all ranks, and accidentally discovering you as his
fellow-labourer, he has generously given you this Thundering Puff.
SILVER SUPERSEDED.
PASTEBoARD, tinsel, and spangles, according to Lord HotHAM, con-
stitute the star of the Order of the Bath; and GENERAL CopangtoN
thinks that it ought to be formed of silver instead, and that Parliament
would not begrudge paying, for a few stars which would be given for
distinguished naval and military services. In the event of another
war, the stars which would have to be given would, we trust, be not a
few; but both Parliament and the country would, no doubt, be regard-
less of expense incurred by making those stars out of proper metal.
The †.". is, whether in the adoption of that metal, cheapness
would not be combined with economy. What metal co more
roper for the star with which BRITANNIA decorates her warriors than
Rita NNLA metal?

- Alſº fectly calm. We dictate

manity to the inferior crea-
tion is our forte, we allow
him to stand in our water-
butt with an umbrella over
him, and to drink as much
stout as he can without
subsiding down among the
tadpoles. He has just bawled
to us, that he makes neither
head nor tail of an article
sent in by MR. DISRAELI.
We can’t be bothered with
writing to DisBAELI—he
must take this notice to be
brighter, or we shall curtail
his salary.
- The heat is an excuse for
almost anything. But not quite. We hear that divers people of our
acquaintance are going extreme lengths. This is to signify that they
must pull up. . - -
AUGUSTU's DE MontMoRENCY will oblige us by resuming his waist-
| coat, and cravat, and by putting on his gloves, before he goes out.
Walking about Berkeley Square with his naked hands hanging down,
no collars nor vest, and a #. cigar in his mouth, is conduct which his
father the Viscount would not approve, nor do we.
| JACK WIGGLEs has only £150 a-year in the Post Office, and ger-
tainly cannot afford to take a Hansom there, and, back every day,
especially when he considers, the state of his laundress's book. Let
him breakfast early and walk slowly to his duty. It is not of the
| slightest consequence what time he gets home.
| If HERBERT WATKINs, of Somerset House, drinks, twelve large
lasses of iced Seitzer and Sherry every day, he will do himself harm.
elimit him to five.
. We have a strong notion that Miss MARY WILTON comes down to
breakfast without any stockings. She shuffles to her seat in a hurry
and never moves from it till everybody else is gone. We forgive the
past in consequence of her being only fifteen years old, but she must
complete her toilette for the future.
There is no objection to FRANK SoMERs's lying on the sofa all night
instead of going to bed, but there is great objection to his keeping that
bottle of Inverness whiskey and a cigar-box beside him.
The Reverend IGNATIUS LLOYD, was engaged to write by the year,
without reference to weather, and we .# trouble him for “copy”
instead of feeble observations on the enervating influence of the atmo.
sphere. He will look precious queer if it enervates us so much that we
can’t take out our cheque-book on Saturday next.
... MATILDA, WALTERs will not push her hair behind her ears, or braid
it º, but will wear her ordinary curls, in which she looks almost
pretty. -
... We heard of the sham telegraph message that fetched DICKEY
BRow N from, a family, party to Brighton, to see an aunt, who was
described as dangerously ill there, the old girl º: perfectly well all
the time, at Worthing; but, as Mrs. DrcKºy has alsº heard of it, we
| Reed not add to BRowN’s penance. And Wednesday was an awfully
hot day to listen to one's relations, and their relations.
ALFRED Wopps may think that the Club does not notice the
way he walks into BADMINTON; but there are bets in the smoking-
room as to whether he will do his four jugs in a day.

SUCCESS; A SONG OF WICIOUS INDIGNATION.
BY A HEBDOMADAL CRITIC. '
AIR-" Home, Sweet Home! ”
WHAT rage and what rancour, what wrath and distress,
I feel at a popular author's success,
With malice and fury it makes my heart flare,
And rends it with pangs too atrocious to bear.
... Oh yes!...I confess
There’s nothing I hate like another's success.
Curse that man whose genius wins fortune and fame,
When I by dull ºf cannot do the same.
How gladly I would, if I could, pull him down,
And throw him, and all his, to starve on the Town'
Oh yes! &e. :
How long will his tedious prosperity last?
Oh! when will the day of his credit be past?
Ah! when, with the rapture of hate, shall I gloat
Upon his lean º and threadbare worn coat?
h yes! &c.
As staunch as a hound ever stuck to a deer,
In vain I pursue him with slander and sneer.
The more I abuse him, the more folks admire,
To madness which infº me, with envy on fire.
Oh yes! &c.
The heat of my passion is such, that it bakes
My blood, which by nature is cold as a snake's,
Till that bubbles up in an impotent hiss;
I spring and I snap—but my object I miss.
Oh yes! &c.
Yet still will I dog him with diligent spite ;
I’ll snarl and I’ll snap, though unable to bite;
As long as he lives, I’ll rail at him and rave; -
Then yelp o'er, and scratch, the fresh mould on his grave.
Oh yes! &c.
THE SPURGEON ADVERTISER.
MR. SPURGEON must be greatly annoyed by the snobbish greediness
with which his name is appropriated and turned to purposes of puffery;
as in the advertisement following:—
EW. C. H. SPURGEON and the REW. W. VERNON.—The Sermon
referred to by the latter gentleman, in his Letter to the Morning Post, on the
16th instant, forwarded amongst twelve preached at the Surrey Gardens before
10,000 of the nobility and gentry, out of 140 published, for 14 stamps by . . . .
Judge for yourselves.
This abuse of the name of MR. SPURGEoN for commercial º: is,
he must feel, vexatiously calculated to impede, his ministry. It drags
him and it into association with sordid and ludicrous ideas. If his
mission were that of another gentleman who shares his sphere of
action, if not of usefulness, the case might be different. If, instead of
lifting his forefinger, and suiting words to the action, it were hi
business to wave a music-staff at the Surrey Gardens, and regulate
quadrilles, his vocation would have reference to time rather than to
eternity. Then, his name, might be placarded and paraded in large
letters, to the increase of the effect which it would be his object to
roduce on his hearers—the excitement of a rampant levity. But
R. SPURGEoN’s eloquence is supposed to have a serious aim, to which
puffs and posters stand in ludicrous relation.
The other side of the river is not like the other side of the Atlantic,
where if a preacher took occasion, in the course of his sermon, to
advertise his own store, or stuck bills relative to his merchandise on
the outside of his pulpit, he would probably in no degree diminish the
impression of his discourse by ...; to those dodges in connection
with it. It is a greatshame to corrupt the reputation of MR. SPURGEON
into the celebrity of PROFEssoR GULLAway. To vulgarise a preacher's
good name is almost as bad as to rob him of it; and a remedy ought
to be provided for such damage to reputation. What next? We shall
erhaps have some irreverent and impudent tobacconist advertising
§º Cigars'
Daft objects.
A PETITION was presented the other night by Colon EL Sykes, from
the Parochial Board of St. Nicholas, Aberdeen, approving of the
objects of the Lunacy (Scotland) Bill, but disapproving of its enact-
ments. This appears to mean, that the petitioners approve of idiots
and madmen, but disapprove of the obligation to take any care of them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
C00L SUMMER DRESS,
“WHY, FRED, MY DEAR FELLow, what EveR HAve You got on 1"
“WHY, Don't You see ?—A PortABLE REFRIGERATOR: DEUCED ComEORTABLE THIS
HoT weATHER, I can TELL YoU ' "
AN ART-WELLINGTON.
THE Duke passant, the Duke rampant, the Duke regardant, the
Duke couchant, the iſſuke in almost all mammer of attitudes, may
be said to have been designed by the competitors for the new
Wellington Statue. A few more conceptions of the great Duke
might be modelled—the Duke eating; the Duke drinking; the Duke
washing his hands; the Duke shaving himself; the Duke mending a
pen; the Duke cutting a cedar pencil, or, at an early period, scraping
a slate one: the }. juke, then Master WELLESLEY, doing a
sum. These would be simple designs: but if a more complex compo-
sition were desired, the Duke might be represented as receiving the
congratulations of BUSINEss—the figure p BUSINEss being that of a
grocer in an apron, and BUSINEss having a pen behind his ear.
Awakened, at last, to the fact that we cannot make a statue, our.
selves, we have invited, foreign competition for the design of the
Wellington Monument, but with indifferent results. The fact is, that
the statue of a modern hero is a statue of clothes, which are comical,
and make the figure invested by them a comic hero. Such a hero is no
more a fit subject for sculpture, than he is of heroic poetry. , The
hero in ADDISQN's Campaign, to be sure, rode, on the whirlwind and
directed the storm in a great wig; but an illustration representing
him as he appeared on that occasion, would be funny.
The face of a statue in the modern costume, constitutes—when
unusually well executed—the only difference between a work of art
and a dummy. In the German slang of the day such an image might
indeed be called an art-dummy. The only reason why, in criticising
such a statue, a cobbler ought to confine himself to §: chaussure is,
that a cobbler is not a tailor. But in the case of the very best statue
of a WELLINGTON that could be made, a cobbler would be a competent
judge; for that statue would be a boot. Such was the monument
which the contemporaries of our great Chief erected to him in leather.
The cobbler would perhaps hold that, for the proposed memorial, there
is still nothing like leather—but there he would be a prejudiced man.
Let us endorse the taste and judgment of our predecessors, and per-
ristº by William Bradbury, of No. 13 º:
A MIDSUMMER. MORNING'S DREAM.
A MoRE than commonly interesting “Marriage in High
Life” was reported the other day by our fashionable con-
temporary. § affair came off, not at All Swells’, but at
St. Paul’s Church, Knightsbridge. The reporter mentions
a remarkable feature of the entertainment—for such it
really appears to have been—in stating that
“MENDElssohn's ‘Wedding March’ was played ". the organ as :
the procession moved up to the altar, and until the bride and bride-
groom had taken their places in front of the communion table.”
In addition we are informed that—
“The service (performed with choral music) was unusually im-
pressive.”
The bride and bridegroom on this occasion will perhaps
be surmised by some who know no better, to have been his
GRACE, Theseus, Duke of Athens, and HER MAJESTY,
Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. The altar up to which
they moved to MENDELssohn’s “Wedding March,” may
be imagined to have been the Altar of HYMEN ; whose
torch may, for the nonce, have been placed upon it in lieu
of tapers. The choral music with which the service was
performed, and which was “unusually impressive,” may be
supposed to have been borrowed from the same work as
the “March,” and in being unusually impressive may be
conceived to have been unusually jolly.
Immediately on the conclusion of the ceremony, the
happy pair may be conjectured to have adjourned to the
mansion of the noble bridegroom, where, after partaking
of the customary collation, they witnessed, a theatrical |
entertainment, consisting of a mock tragedy, composed
by a humble dramatic author, and performed, in honour of
. occasion, by a company of amateurs of the working
Classes.
A Shave.
MR. MUNTZ leaves Parliament from ill health. We
hope he is not seriously ill or too unwell to enjoy the
wittiest thing that has ever been said in our time; but
which, if his indisposition is grave, we withdraw, with
regret—namely, that he wants change of hair.
How TO GET A LADY TO SHOW HER FOOT. — Praise
the foot of some one else!
petuate their idea in marble. We can make a decent boot, and may,
perhaps, make a tolerable statue of one.
The highest honour that we pay to our most illustrious personages
is that fapplying their names to boots—we denominate our highlows
BLUCHERs, ALBERTs, CoBURGs—and our boot of boots is the WEL-
LINGTON. The most noble Order of the Boot is conferred on none
but Princes and Warriors; there is the NEWTONIAN theory and the
DAvy Lamp; but there are no NEWTONs at 14s. 6d. or DAVYs at 12s.
Indeed, the honour of the boot is very properly degreed only to
those who have won their spurs, and the recollection of this circum:
stance may animate many a youthful Fº and predestined Field
Hºl. whose feelings may be faintly expressed in the following ||
eS:-
Said the bravest of young recruits,
I go where the cannons rattle,
My name with the names of boots
Shall shine for my deeds in battle!
Enough has probably now been said to convince everybody at all

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“A CASE FOR THE POLICE."
SCENE IN OXFORD STREET.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 27th, Monday. The relief of Divorce was afforded in three cases,
but Mr. Punch is happy to state that the parties were rich, as was
shown by their having paid a thousand guineas, and more, a-piece, to
obtain He Bills to which the QUEEN’s assent was this day given.
persons, of course, have a right to Parliamentary aid.
A little Indian debate was got up in the Lords, while a large one
was raging in the Commons. LôRD CLANRICARDE adduced, some
instances of the utter contempt with which young officers in the Indian
service are taught to regard regimental duty. The DUKE, of ARGYLL
thought it premature to discuss the question of India at all. .
In the Commons, LoRD PALMERSTON was perpetually questioned as
to whether he had heard from India, the telegraph, being due. He had
not, up to the close of the sitting at two in the morning, but, on
Tuesday private people received the tidings, published on Wednesday,
that Delhi had not fallen, that, the mutiny was spreading, that there
was no army left, and that English soldiers were fast arriving.
All this was unknown during the debate. MR. DisPAELI, himself not
a bad representative of a mutinous Asiatic, denounced everything that
had ever been done in India, and poor VERNoN SMITH, to Dizzy's
extreme delight, reproached him with being mischievous. DISRAELI
wanted a Commission sent out to inquire into the grieyances of the
rebels, but this was too much for the English spirit of LoRD John
RusséLL, who moved as an amendment that the House should address
the QUEEN, and assure her of every assistance, in putting the rebels
down. MR. Thomas BARING, also, who might be the Tory Chancellor
ºf the Exchequer if he chose º LoRD DERby happened to come
into office), pitched into his fellow Conservative very severely. MR.
AYRTos, of the Tower Hamlets, who appears to have taken a vow to
speak upon all occasions whatsoever, but who, having practised as a
ister in India, had some right to be heard to-night, tried to get the
| debate adjourned, but was beaten by 303 to 79. There was a good
deal of speaking besides, and DISRAELI's taunting reply, when he had
only to be personal and sarcastic, was evidently so much more in
earnest than his speech, which dealt with grave interests, that he was
|yery successful. He nicknamed LoRD, John Russel, the Halcyon,
brooding on bright waters, and (he added, with a little confusion of
metaphor) playing a conciliatory, card to assist Government.
halcyon at whist is a motion worthy an Asian mystic. Finally, the
|Halcyon's amendment was unanimously adopted.
Twesday. The Liverpool people petition for Courts of Reconcilement
wherein quarrels may be settled at once, and the lawyers be prevente
| from plunder. The Liverpool people are sensible men, except in
A. explained that for the non-dra
petitioning for such things to two chambers, in one of which, almost
the º men with brains are retired and enriched lawyers, and in the
other the same noxious element is about ten times as prevalent. Why
not establish such Courts for themselves, making compact to be bound
by the decisions? The Fraudulent Trustees Bill was read a second
time, Lord BROUGHAM telling a good story of a boy who, choosing a
trade, begged to be brought up an “executor,” having noticed that it
must be a good business, as, ever since his father had been one, there
had always been meat in the house.
SIR GEORGE GREY proposed to hand over the powers of the Board
of Health to a Committee of the Educational Council, but finally gave
it up, and arranged to take a continuance of the powers of the Board.
The Metropolis and all the º cities being now so thoroughly
drained and cleansed, the Thames being so completely purified, and
every precaution being everywhere in readiness, should epidemic or
disease break out, (the stench which happens to poison the House of
Commons every day is a trifle not º mentioning,) the health of
the people—none of whom now live in crowded lodging houses, without
water and other cºnveniencies—may be considered as perfectly cared
for, and the “local” folks are right in asking to º a Board for
which there is no further use.
The evening's debate was on Military Education, and when the
beau-ideal which the House proposes to itself as the model of a British
9fficer shall be realised, there will no longer be anything unreasonable
in the sentiments of the females who reside in *. neighbourhood of
the MissEs KENWigs, and behold in the wax image in the spirited
yºung hairdresser's window that conformation found only in Military
Men and Angels. A resolution that the military angels, especially
those on the staff, ought to receive a higher education than now, and
that ºutive examination should be one of its elements, was
agreed to.
The writs for Mayo and Galway were refused, and instead, the Irish
Attorney-General was ordered to prosecute the priests Conway and
RYAN. Some of the Irish members, of the anti-English party, opposed
the prosecution, but were beaten by overwhelming majorities on three
divisions, and indeed may be charitably supposed to have shown fight
only to please their masters, the Irish priests.
Wednesday. Mr. Punch has but to put forth his influence in earnest
to secure a glorious victory for any party into whose scale he may
throw his sword. But as he would sooner be torn to pieces by wild
horses, or talked to death by WiscouxT WILLIAMs, than lend any aid,
save in the cause of virtue and humanity, there is no fear of his gigantic
powers being misdirected. This modest statement of his position and
character will scarcely be deemed irrelevant (not that he cares whether
it is thought so, or not) when he announces that on this day, Wednes-
day, the result of his exertions in favour of the Civil Servants of the
Crown was the defeat of Wiscount PALMERston’s strong Government
by 171 to 111, on the Superannuation Bill. Mr. Punch thus secures
to every Civil Servant who has more than one hundred a-year an
increase of five per cent, and an increase of two and a half per cent. to
every such servant with an income under that amount. Of the
banquet which the Sixteen Thousand Servants intend to offer to Mr.
Punch, in testimony of gratitude, full details will be given in due time.
MR. BERNAL Osbor NE delivered a rather amusing and abusing
attack upon some people who had petitioned .*. return for
Dover, and two more victims were sacrificed at the altar of Purity of
Election, the two members for Yarmouth. We thought something
would come of the shower of Herrings announced the other day.
These signs and tokens ought not to be neglected.
Thursday. LoRD ELLENBoRough argued with much justice, that
the Government of India was not directed by the Gover Nor-GENERAL
*ś but by secretaries and clerks. The old pumps in Leaden-
hall Street like a large batch of dispatches, because they look fussy
and business-like, and so everything is done in writing, instead of
officials being brought face to face, and settling matters in ten minutes.
Some of these India House people make their servants address them
in letters on all occasions. One Director insists on this sort of thing
from his footman,—“Sir, I have the honour to apprise you that Tea
is ready in the drawing-room, and I am further directed by my Lady
to ascertain from you, whether you prefer Buttered or Dry Toast.
Awaiting your reply, I have the honour to remain, Sir, your ve
obedient and very humble Servant, John Thomas.-1st August, 1857.”
This the old fool dockets, marking on the outside, “Answered Dry,”
and puts the whole away, under i. and key. And on this system
!". ompany makes its servants act, and then wonders that nothing
ls done.
In the Commons, MR. AppERLEY complained of the pestilential
stench which came every evening into every window of the river front
of the Houses of Parliament. SIR BENAMIN HALL very properly
inage of the Metropolis the parties
responsible, were the chattering Do-nothings of the Central Works
Board, itself almost a greater nuisance than any of the nuisances it
neglects to abate... We shall have to abolish this Board, we see that,

the Bill, and urged the remonstrance of the Clergy. The new
SOLICITOR-GENERAL replied that the weight of authority among the
heads of the Church had already been thrown in favour of the Bill.
MR. HENLEY grumbled about having more time. MR. WALPole spoke
ably in favour of the measure, and was indeed the only speaker who
could or did worthily, tackle MR GLADSTONE. M.R. NAPIER, as a
University Member, took the clerical view, and the ATToRNEY-GENERAL

“Mrs. JANE PEDGwick,
a delicate-looking woman,
the wife of a tradesman
in the City Road, stated
that while passing through
Bishopsgate Street on Sa-
turday evening, leaning on
the arm of her husband;
the prisoner, whom she
had never seen before, as she believed, came suddenly in front of them, and, without saying a word, or any-
thing occurring to induce him to do so, struck her a heavy blow upon the bosom. She had previously suffered
much pain from her neck, but the blow the prisoner dealt her had made it worse than it had ever been,
and even while giving her evidence she was suffering great pain from it.
“The complainant's husband deposed to the unprovoked nature of the attack, the prisoner running away
the moment he had made it; and LAMBERT, a constable attached to one of the theatres, deposed to seeing the
prisoner striking and kicking three officers who had secured him, and that, on his advising him to go quietly
and not resist the constable, the prisoner broke away from the officers, and knocked his hat off, and, on his
stooping to recover it, dealt him such a violent kick upon the temple that he had been unable to rest all
night, and could not touch his face from the pain he endured.”
The dénouement of this is considerably more farcical than seems to be appropriate, for we
find it next recorded that, after pleading drunkenness as an “extenuating circumstance,”
“The prisoner having declared that he had not the slightest recollection of anything that had occurred,
“MR. D'Eyncourt sentenced him to pay penalties to the amount of £3, or, in default, to undergo six
weeks' hard labour in the House of Correction.”
What most puzzles us in this, is to find that the police assaults were leniently dealt with.
We are prepared to find a Magistrate awarding a light punishment for the trifling offence of
knocking down a woman, but when a policeman has so much as a whisker even ruffled, we
expect the heaviest sentence for the dastardly
attack. Yet here there was clear proof that the
prisoner had savagely assaulted four policemen,
and, by a most mysterious blindness on the
Bench, justice takes no heed of the quadrupled
enormity, and passes sentence only for the femi-
nine assault.
For we cannot bring ourselves to the belief
that MR. D’EYNcourt included in his £3 penalty
the five assaults. This would have him
jºi them at twelve shillings a-piece, which
would have been obviously much too low a
figure. Or are we to infer that in the fines
which are imposed at our Police Courts there is
allowed a reduction to those who take a quantity?
Certainly if WARLock's case be made a prece-
dent, the British ruffian will find it every bit as
cheap to commit a score of outrages as only one
or two. It will be to his advantage to deal his
blows and kicks in a more wholesale way than
formerly, for the more assaults he is charged
with, the more discount he will get: and if his
brutalities be priced by MR. D’EYNcouBT, he
will find it save his pocket to have gone the
entire brute.

any power to enforce better trappings of the drains, or a removal of
#.ºil. of bones and other refuse on the opposite bank—and so
O
It is to be hoped the House was satisfied with SIR BENJAMIN HALL's
answer, which showed that, if bone-boilers were free to create stinks
it was because the House had altered the law introduced to prevent
them, and that if local authorities neglected their duty, the Commons
had themselves struck out the section of the Nuisances Removal Bill,
which empowered justices to compel them. So long as bone-boilers
only poisoned the poor Lambeth householders, it was no doubt too
much to expect that the collective wisdom would interfere with the
ſº bone interest, or limit the vested rights of stinks and stenches.
ut now that the smell is brought home to the Legislative nose, let
the bone-boilers look to it! That local authorities should be allowed
to neglect their duty, to the poisoning of the rate-payers, is one of
those proud privileges of local self-government, which cannot be
bought too dear, at whatever cost of preventible disease or, excessive
ºl. But, now that the neglect incommodes MR. ADDERLEY
in his place, or the SPEAKER in his chair, Bumbledom totters! As
somebody said of religion, so Mr. Punch exclaims, “Oh, Self-

THE GROTTO NUISANCE. -
At this time of the year, anybody remaining in Town, will do well
to attire himself for walking out in the oldest clothes that he has got.
Most of his acquaintance are at the sea-side; and the oyster, season
has just commenced. Therefore he will be seen by few who will notice
him with displeasure or derision, and he will perhaps avert the impor-
tunities of the children who pester the pedestrian with entreaties, to
“remember the grotto.” This is a great nuisance to everybody, but
it is peculiarly irritating to persons who, are expected to take every-
thing coolly-namely, philosophers. The peripatetic, philosopher is
interrupted in his meditations by the demands of the little imps who
annually, at this time of the year, torment the London public like
those other emissaries of BEELZEBUB, the flies.
No philosopher, moreover, has any money to throw away; and to
meet the annoyance with concession, would involve a constant and
progressive distribution of halfpence. This would be disbursement to
a pretty tune—not that of “Sing a Song of Sixpence”—for many six-
pences would be needful to constitute the required amount, and a
pocket full of halfpence would very soon become empty. Any, one
who, absorbed in thought, is going along with his eyes uplifted cloud.
wards, and not taking particular cognisance of things that are sub-
lunary and passing beneath his nose, will very probably walk over
several of these brats, for they throw themselves right in the way of
the fastest and fattest walker, without, the slightest .. to his
momentum, or consideration of his corpulence... He therefore runs so
many risks of squelching an infant or breaking his own shins.
It is a case in which the police ought to step in and interfere; but
as they will not, the only plan to avert the applications and attacks of
the youthful bores, is the expedient of dressing shabbily. But, to be
effectually defensive, the dress must be very seedy indeed, so as to
bespeak a very near approximation to abject *. Those who
. a point of wearing new, or comparatively new, and well-made
clothes, would be astonished to know what a very old and extremely |
cheap coat, with other habiliments to match, is required to secure the
wearer from being pestered by mendicants. A suit of fustian, a blouse,
or a smock frock and corduroys, would perhaps be requisite for sure
protection against the little .# s who make the return of the
oyster, and the pretence of building a grotto with oyster-shells, an
excuse for begging.
Destructive Habits. |
It is said that the early bird picks up the worm : but gentlemen who
smoke—and ladies who dance—till three or four in the morning, will
do well to consider that the worm also picks up the early bird.

BEER BARRELS v. SUNDAY BANDS.
A REMARKABLE statement was made the other day in a letter to the
Morning Post by “A FRIEND To HARMLEss ENjoyMENT.” This
individual cited the report of a recent meeting of the Protestant
Defence Association on the subject of the People's Sunday Bands in
the Parks, containing “terrible denunciations of the wickedness of the
Government in permitting the performances of those bands on Sunday
evenings,” followed by a suggestion by a MR. HANBURY that all
measures should be taken for their suppression. This MR. HANBURY
the correspondent of the Post represents as one 6f the celebrated
brewers. We should think he must have been somebody else. No
respectable or sensible brewer would surely be such a stupid humbug
as to go and, abuse Sunday, Bands, well knowing that an immense
number of publicans were selling his beer, and known to be selling it,
all the while the bands were playing, and during a much greater part
of the Sabbath besides. Such a hypocritical goose would be unworthy
of the name of HANBURY, which is associated with that of TRUMAN.
He would subject his personal genuineness to doubt, and draw suspicion
on the integrity of his own Entire.
No measures for the suppression of Sunday Bands could be con-
templated by a consistent brewer, except pewter measures, which, with
their contents, might be put into competition with musical allure-
ments; pots and pothouses against parks and subscription-bands for
the people. Of course MR. HANBURY, of HANBURY & Co., would
not attack the Sunday orchestra with any other weapons than pints
and quarts; unless, indeed, all MESSRs. HANBURY & Co’s public-
houses are obliged by them to remain closed during the whole of Sunday.
It may be that such is the case. We do not know that it is not. e
will look next Sunday and ascertain what is the fact: many othere will
rhaps do the same. If MR. HANBURY the brewer was really the
BURY alluded to by the Morning Post, we should take the liberty
of saying to that gentleman, “HANBURY, don't talk any more of that
nonsense, but go and mind your beer. If the stuff you brew is as bad
as the stuff you talk, it must be extremely bad beer. Were you to take
a duck on the banks of the Serpentine, and stick a hop on the tip of
its beak, and fix a barley-corn on the extremity of its tail, and start it
to swim over that sheet of impure water, the bird would convert the
whole of it into a description of beer infinitely superior to what we
should imagine yours to be.”
MERETRICIOUS RELICS.
WILL not the Pope call the Franciscan monks of Porsovenere to
account for their alleged maintenance of an imposture, which His
Holiness must needs regard as impious humbug According to a letter
from La Spezia, quoted by the Opinione of Turin, the above-named
friars, having been forced to leave their convent the other day, by the
law for the suppression of monastic establishments, walked off with a
uantity of sacred utensils, and other valuables, among which were
‘the ear-rings of the VIRGIN MARY | * The idea of even any commonly
sensible and right-minded lady wearing ear-rings Is there any other
article of female vanity preserved by these monks as a companion
relic *—a pot of rouge, perhaps; or a sous-jupe bouffante? But there
may be a §: mistake in the statement in the Opinione. Perhaps the
Porsovenere Franciscans are impostors a little less profane than they
are represented to be by that account. Peradventure the ear-rings of
which they are in possession, are pretended by them to be merely
those of St. MARY MAGDALEN–before her conversion.
For Export to India.
WE never, as must have been remarked, make a joke upon a name,
but we happen to know a person who made one the other day. OR
GENERAL JoHN HEARSEY is a ant and skilful officer, and as
Colonel of the Sixth Bengal. Light Cavalry, was a perfect Bengal
Light to the Indian army during the Infantry Mutiny at Barrackpore.
Well, the QUEEN has very graciously made him an Extra Military
K.C.B.” The person to whom we referred says, that he is glad that
some of the attention always bestowed on General Rumour has also
been shown to General Hearsay.

WE lately noticed the extreme economy of speech which is practised
upon most, if not on all our Railroads, on the part of those officials
whose vocation it is to shout out to every train that stops there the name
of the respective station at which they are stationed. As hints thrown
out in Punch are invariably acted on, it is no surprise to us to find
that at the places which we instanced, there has been since our remon-
strance, a decidedly more liberal supply of language. We have more
than once been gratified by hearing the entire pronunciation of “New
Cross,” and twice at least we have been treated with the missing syl-
lables which expand the abbreviated “’N’am ” into “Sydenham.” The
spirit of improvement, too, appears to be infectious, and its effects are
evidently spreading to adjacent stations. A month ago we never
should have dreamt of hearing anything but “Nor’’ when our train
pulled up at Norwood, but yesterday we heard the word in its com-
Fº dissyllability; and this very afternoon we have positively had no
ess than thirteen hairs turned grey, by the shock of joy it gave us to
hear the proper aspirate prefixed to “Forest ill; ” a feat that not the
oldest ºr can, we fancy, call to mind that he has ever heard
accomplished.
all our railways the process of articulation will be more attended to.
Even on the Eastern Counties there is room for some reform in this
respect at least, if not in any other. We were lately travellers on this
delightful line, and the tediousness of our journey was most pleasantly
beguiled by the excitement of endeavouring, when we reached a
station, to recognise the name of it in what we heard bawled out to us.
In the first thirty miles of Eastern Counties travelling there are no
less than four stopping stations having names of two syſlabies, the last
of which is “ford: ” and as the prefix Strat-, Il-, Chelms-, or Rom-, is
rarely, audible, a nervous passenger is kept in an unceasingly
excited state, lest in this quarteſte of “fords” he should be carried
#. the right one, the chances being three to one at least in favour of
being so. -
... Now the accident of having thus #" out at a wrong station, although
it cause no damage to the person of a passenger, further than perhaps
the postponement of his dinner, still cannot but be somewhat detrimental
to his mind; giving rise to feelings which no relieving expletives will
easily calm down. And to prevent as far as may be the recurrence of
such accidents, we suggest that every railway should start an elocution
class, which every station-caller engaged upon the line should, once a
week at least, be expected to attend. Moreover, it might be as well
to have some special auditors of stations' names º whose duty
it should be to travel up and down the line, and weekly certify that
every one employed had been attentive to his calling.
| Should these not prove sufficient means to ensure in Railway calls
a more distinct articulation, we would recommend that the utterance
of clipped words which will not pass as current English should in
future, be considered an indictable offence; and that, if needful, a
: lº Act of Parliament be passed by which this wilful mutilation of
the
language may be punished. Because a Jew considers “clo”, an
equivalent for “clothes,” there is no reason why a Christian should be
similarly stingy in his speech; and as our railway men are not Bornese,
their language does not force them to the use of only monosyllables.
i Such brevity as theirs can in no way be regarded as the soul of wit,
; and only serves to raise a laugh upon the wrong side of one’s mouth,
1 when one finds it has induced one to overshoot one's station. From
i hearing such continual contractions of speech, a passenger might almost
fancy that the calling out at stations was a work performed by con-
tract; but as this is not the case, we see no reason why these
speech-contractors should not be compelled to furnish a more liberal
supply of syllables. As it is, one really cannot go a dozen miles
by rail without hearing a good deal of what in its curtailment
may be called bad language; and although our better nature may
| instinctively recoil from the unenlightened principle of giving tit for
tat, still we cannot help sug º; that officials must expect to be
called names themselves, if #. ill not take the pains to call names
more distinctly.

An Irish Melody.
THE studs that SMITH O'BRIEN lost
en he was a º
How heavy must have been their cost!
Their brilliancy how splendid!
Whilst ERIN's sons bewailed their Chief,
And nothing could console them,
Those shirt-studs vanished, for the Thief,
The Warrior's Captor, stole them.
The Caitiff dared his base Champagne,
The fettered Patriot offer,
The Hero hurled it back again,
And scorned the dirty proffer.
Then from his manly eyes big floods
Of burning tears began to
Flow for his country, and the studs
Purloined from his portmanteau.
He took their memory o'er the sea,
Where Saxon minions bore him,
And fetched it back when Tyranny
Was driven to restore him.
His long worn bonds, that now were burst,
His knee had ne'er make flexile;
He spoke the wrong which he had nursed
In slavery and exile.
Nine summers had disclosed their buds,
And still the Chieftain thundered
Against the stealers of the studs,
Of which he had been plundered.
He boldly wrote words all might read,
Demouncing their abstraction,
And censuring that paltry deed,
And blaming that mean action.
Those studs, which if he loved too well,
The noble weakness pardon,
Were gems of Munster’s crown, that fell
In Boulagh's cabbage garden.
He bore them in the battle's brunt,
Against the foeman craven.
They now are gone from his breast-front,

THE Brighton Town Council, always an irascible body, had a good
set-to the other day, about the Drainage. A MR. SAwy ER, who was
accused of having “a prejudice against drainage” is the Chairman of
the Highways and Works Committee. He did not seem at all dis-
composed at this charge—most men of ordinary brains and humani
would almost prefer to be accused of some legal crime—and sai
(according to the report in the Brighton Gazette) that “if he died
to-morrow, he would not wish a better epitaph on his grave than that
he obstimately opposed draining the sewage into the sea.” Without
expressing any undue haste for the apotheosis of any gentleman,
31r. Punch must say that if the health of Brighton can be secured onl
by the demise of SAwYER, the immediate execution of that party .
better be entrusted to a committee of excursionists, who will go down
for the purpose, suspend SAwy ER from the centre arch of the Chain
pier, and afterwards dine, together in celebration of the auspicious
event. By all means let him have the memorial he proposes.
“And be old SAwy FR's epitaph on he.
“He would not put the sewage in the sea.”
Now, if SAwyER has anything to urge as a reason for suspending his
suspension, he had better be quick about it, as, this hot weather, we

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 8, 1857.
A HALF-HOLIDAY AT DIEPPE.
IF on Sunday July the 26th, the health of º had been proposed at a F.
banquet, that watery town, placing its hand on the bosom of its ocean, would have
declared, in a clear rippling voice, “This is the proudest day of my life.” The
old town, on that occasion was as gay as it could be made... It had been washed
from head to foot. Its complexion was almost white, and glistened with a radiant
olish not unlike the ivory toys that are sold in its shops. It was dressed in its
É. suit. Over its head there towered a triumphāl arch. Round its brow
bloomed a gorgeous wreath of flowers. In its button-hole, in lieu of a bouquet, you
beheld the brilliant colours of a flag, that on one side looked like a Tricolor, and on
the other bore a bright resemblance to the Union Jack; thus, flowerily expressing
that both sides of #. coast were equally near and dear to its heart. The gems
it wore, you may be sure, were rich and rare. There, were stars and crosses more
than iß. to stock a dozen jewellers’ shops, whilst its innumerable rings gave
out a joyous sound, that you heard at every step, not unlike the clatter of bells.
But conspicuous above all was a monster breast-pin, modelled so as to resemble
a kind of crystal establishment for baths, and which Dieppe sported for the first
time on the occasion of these Fêtes. -
This ornament, it is said, had cost the town £30,000. The design had been
drawn out by EugéNIE herself!, Certainly Dieppe was very proud of it, and kept
dancing about with it, night and day—now flashing it in the sun, now allowing a
thousand gaslights to play . it, so that you should have the best opportunity
of admiring it in every possible point of view. In outline, it º eared to us to
be a most happy combination of the various styles of the Crystal Palace, and the
Pavilion at Brighton, with a slight touch of the architectural beauties of Cremorne.
However, it was excessively neat, and not at all gaudy. The design does the
greatest credit to EugéNIE. We suggest that she be requested to draw out the
plan of our new Public Buildings.
The Fêtes resembled very, nearly every other French Fête. The streets flowed
with flags and military music. Garlands stretched across the street, as though
the houses were, going to perform a country dance, and were giving their hands
to each other. There were some pretty illuminations, consisting of vases of lighted
flowers, and a tº: fountain that overflowed with streams of light... It was
a cascade of a kind of liquid rainbows—a kind of Harlequin's shower-bath. The
effect was very pretty, and delighted the bonnes, and the curiously-dressed children,
and the pigmy red-breeched º: of soldiers, as they paced to and fro, bending
under the weight of muskets three times as long as themselves. At the Hôtel
de Wille, you beheld a glimpse of the ancien régime. Round the courtyard
were ibbéted certain gaunt skeletons of dirty lights.
riangles of tallow and stench, from which rose raging billows of smoke, whilst at
the base might be discerned a very small ripple ... These are your Lampions.
They were huge unsightly blac
We thought they had been blown out long ago. You
only see them outside Government Offices. They are bound

sisting of little walnut-shells of yachts that would not sail,
and rowing-matches of rowers that could not row. Eve

is was the only damp part of the business. They were
not enthusiastic fireworks; or else they were sulky, and
would not come out as they should have done. All the
blowing-up in the world would not make them explode."
This was a pity, for the French, generally, are a great fire:
working people. The crowd, however, took it all in good
humour, and made up for the disappointment by letting of
an additional number of private squibs.
At half-past ten the streets were clear, — all but two
Cafés closed'. Returning home, smoking our unsoutella,
we espied in the Grande Rue a family party playing at cards
on a table drawn out in the middle of the pavement.
There, in the centre, was the moderateur lamp; there, at
the corners, were the glasses, filled apparently with sucrée
and sirop de groseille. The messieurs were in their shirt-
sleeves—the dames without their bonnets. Heedless of the
cannon, careless of the fireworks, philosophically insou-
ciants of the hubbub elsewhere, they were quietly enjoying,
opposite their open shop-door, their humble game of whiste.
Simple-minded Épiciers, they looked so happy, we quite
envied them . It was a glowing cabinet picture of content-f
ment. We should like to have joined them, and have lost ||
valiantly a whole pocketful of sous. How different would
it have been in London! Fancy such an incident taking ||
place in Baker Street. In less than ten minutes they
would have had a thousand blackguards round them, grin.
ning and jeering at their simplicity. This primitive tableau.
moved us more than the cannon, and all the thunderi
discours. We left the innocent partie carrée with a .#
ing heart, that bounded again, as high as AURIol, if not
higher, as in the distance we heard the gros papa throw
out these words:—“Allons—du Coeur-c'est & vous /*
We must not omit to mention that, of course, there was
a ball. No French féte would be complete without a ball! }
We confess that French balls do not particularly “enchant”
us. A public ball in France is too wild, too #sº
a private one too tame, too in. Their orgeat, has no
charm for our vitiated palate—their petits gaiteaua have no
taste for a pampered stomach that has been too long
petted and spoilt with good English suppers. It always
seems to us to be no better than a Dancing Academy of
young ladies who are on view to be married. The young
demoiselles in white muslin never take their beautiful eyes
off the wax-polished floor, and the young “dandies” in
lack coats never dare address, to them any but the most
childish common-places. Their conversation consists
of a timid “Yes,” varied occasionally by a bashful “No.”
No one laughs—the º of nature is round the card-
table. Everything is false, restrained, inanimate—a kid-
º mockery of pleasure, made all the more distasteful
y the lynx-eyed, espion of the mothers, as, seated
round the room, they watch suspiciously every little move:
ment of their daughters; . Where is the freedom, the inde-
pendence, the open laughing enjoyment of an English even-
ing party? As it was, we amused ourselves by admiring
the handsome decorations of the établissement, that have.
been executed under the direction of the great CAMBON,
the STANFIELD of the Grand Opera. They are in richness
and effect fully worthy of the artist, to whom Paris is
indebted for the magnificence of Robert le Diable, Le
Prophète, and other opéras de lure. |
The établissement is so well conducted that, as MADAME
DE GENLIS would have said, “La mère pourra y conduire
sa fille.” There is no gambling, either, as at German
baths, so that the father need not be afraid of his son
having all his pocket-money engulphed by the inevitable
Maëlstrom of the roulette-table.
The Mayor, gave a grand breakfast, to which, the well- |
known Pâté de foie gras, that had come specially all the
way from Strasbourg. in order to be present, was invited,
as well as every delicacy of the season. The health ºf
the French Press was proposed. ... It seemed to us to be a
bitter mockery to propose the health of an institution that
in France was notoriously dead. Seve gentlemen in
k stood up, and we suppose they were Mutes that were
in attendance to do honour to the defunct. The Rédactex
des Petites Affiches de Paris said a few words of cºś

over the loss of their respected friend, who had done so much for
France, and had died in serving her. The toast was drunk in solemn
silence.
The English Press was responded to by the Editor of BRADSHAw's
Guide. We expected to hear from him a very confused speech, divided
into three trains, and bristling with figures, from which you would not
be able to make out arrival, or departure, neither beginning, middle,
nor end. . However, we were agreeably disappointed, for he gravely
began with “My name is Norwai,” and recited that exciting speech
at full length. As not a Frenchman present understood a word of
English, the speech had the happiest effect. The eloquent orator put
is hand every now and then upon his breast, gesticulated largely, and,
in due course, was vehemently applauded. - - - - - -
To wind up:—we must say we enjoyed our trip to Dieppe mightily,
and beg to thank all, from the Mayor down to the Steward, each of
whom was polite enough, to put his bassin, at our disposal. The same
pleasure is open to all who like to make the same trip. Henceforth,
. numbers one watering-place the more. Even the statue of
Duques NE, who figures in the Place Royale in the melodramatic
| attitude of a pirate of the Ambigu, relaxed a little in its nautical
ferocity, and we fancied a smile came over, his bronzed features as he

for something to eat. Dieppe, through Newhaven, is now only seven

The “Cup” is decorated with two medallions representing scenes
from the Midsummer Night's Dream. More appropriate embellish-
ments might have been derived from Richard the Third. One of them
would of course have been the battle scene, wherein the desperate
usurper makes the celebrated offer of his kingdom for a horse, and the
other that in which the Duke of Norfolk apprizes Richard of the no
less celebrated warning which has been addressed to him with the
appellation of “Jockey.”

LoRD BROUGHAM favoured the Lords with his views upon Parlia-
mentary Reform. Not, however, in the tone in which he addressed
the Commons on the same topic, and at the time when he politely
| exclaimed to the late SIR Robert PEEL, (in reference to the Duke of
WELLINGTON's declaration against reform); “Him we scorn not, it is
i. we scorn, his mean, base, fawning parasite.” To-night his lordship,
ing a nobleman, behaved as such, and while desiring that certain
defects in the last Reform Bill should be corrected, deprecated any
general or sweeping measure., Considering in whose hands the measure
is, MR. PUNCH thinks his lordship does well to be afraid, as a more dan-
gerous radical and leveller could not exist than the fiery ultra-democrat
now our Premier. LoRD HENRY advocated the giving the franchise
to respectable men, though only lodgers; he stated that our artisans
É. treated the ballot, with contempt; he spoke favourably of the
ucational franchise, and made a protest against our constitution
| being rendered more “democratic” than it had seemed d unto
| John Russell and himself to make it when they finally and eternally
settled it in 1832. LORD GRAN VILLE was much obliged, but begged
it might be understood that LoRD BROUGHAM knew nothing whatever
of the intentions of Government.
. The Australian post question came up. Some of these days we shall
have our able-bodied colonists coming over in force to thrash all parties
concerned, for not sending out the letters, or taking means to have
them delivered when they arrive. The present plan seems to be for
the Post-Master General to toss the Australian letter-bag on board any
vessel in the river that looks as if it was as likely to go to Australia
as anywhere else. That matter is then off his mind. And if the vessel
should go, the letters sometimes go also, unless the sailors want the
|sack for anything else, in which case they are emptied into the sea.
| The colonists object to this system, and although, of course, we should
discourage colonial complaints as much as possible, the present course
seems to have its inconveniences. -
In the Commons LoRD'John RUssFLI, brought up his new device in
favour of the Hebrews. As the Lords won’t open the door, and the
Government don't like to break it open, John NY proposes to pick the
lock. There was an Act of Parliament passed in the 5th year of KING
|WILLIAM THE SAILOR, permitting All Bodies authorised to administer
| or receive oaths, to substitute a declaration for the same. John’s
notion is that the Commons is one of these bodies, and that it may let
in M. DE ROTHscHILD on a declaration. So he has obtained a Com-
mittee, consisting of a set of 25 Members of his own selection, and also
| all the gentlemen of the Long Robe (this shut out the attorneys HAD-
FIELD and Cox, to their wrath) who were to consider the matter. The
opposition lawyers ridiculed the idea, and the PREMIER reserved his
sentiments, but, it appears, ordered the ATTORNEy-GENERAL to support
|LoRD Johs's view. The Committee discussed in secret. . Mr. Punch
has not the faintest hesitation in saying that the framers of the Act in
|riºt to the decision of the Committee, by framing a scheme for the
question had not the slightest idea of including the Parliamentary oath
in their provisions, but if this legal loophole is ºf: enough for the
BARON to come in at, he had better do so, as one of these days he must
come in somehow or other. The Conservatives talked against the
Committee, but did not divide. -
Compensation to the Proctors occupied the House the rest of the
evening, and a #. deal of good money was voted away to these black
namesakes of BARRY CoRNwall.
Tuesday. LoRD BROUGHAM presented a petition on Education from
the parish of St. GEORGE's, Hanover Square, a district in which the
grossest ignorance is understood to prevail, and whose prayers for
teaching ought not to be disregarded.
And, apropos of ST.GEORGE's, Hanover Square, we now come to
the story of the week, namely, the Divorce discussion. The Commons
gave Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday nights to the subject. Mr. Punch
has no intention of filling up his golden pages with an analysis of the
sense and nonsense that were talked, or to trace the various important
or trumpery amendments and alterations. He pledges himself, when
the Bill shall have become law, to explain to Persons about to Marry
what possibility there is of escaping the consequence of their rash-
ness. Meantime, suffice it to say, first, that the proposed abolition
of the suit for Jactitation of Marriage was prevented. Therefore, if
any young lady, no matter how beautiful and rich, goes about Jacti-
tating, that is, boasting, that she is Mrs. Punch (when she is not)
Mr. Punch has a remedy against her. Secondly, that SAMUEL
WARREN made a remarkab †. and perfectly unavailing speech
against the Bill. Thirdly, that, up to the end of the week, the whole
legal and lay wisdom of the House was taxed in vain to devise a clause
for protecting from a husband the earnings of a woman whom he had
deserted; but finally SIR. R. BETHELL º to strain his intellect
to the utmost, and produce such a clause in the following week.
Fourthly, that the Government were beaten on a #. osal which,
though made by the Tories, is really more for the benefit of the humbler
orders than anything in the Bill. This was to create a local juris-
diction in divorce cases, so that a poor man or woman in Northumber-
land or Cornwall may not be compelled to come to London, and live
there while seeking redress. Government sulked, and refused to give
local courts, and the work was finally left to MR. Is AAC BUTT, a
Conservative. The majority was not large–98 to 87—and Mr. Punch
will not wonder if, at another stage, the fº. is smashed.
Lastly, MR HENRY DRUMMOND, the Angel of the Church in Gordon
Square, endeavoured to place the husband and the wife on a footing
of equality as to the offences for which divorce should be asked, and the
Committee, being Men of the World, were mightily amused at so
Fºl. a proposition, negatived it by 126 to 65, and doubtless
ave since made, in club-windows, curious comments on the probable
changes in fondon society which such an enactment might produce.
Wednesday. SIR Thomas Wilson triumphed. The , House of
Commons, “will no longer, do an injustice to an individual, whose
property the public covets.” The Bill for letting him do as he likes
at ps passed by 77 to 59. But after a Wednesday comes a

62 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 15, 1857.
Thursday, and then MR. AYRTON succeeded in stopping the Bill, for
the moment, by a majority of 1. The Heath is still unvanquished.
Much money was voted away to-day. We regret to add that a new
writ had to be issued for Birmingham, the illness of the late member,
MR. MUNTZ, having ºil; taken a fatal turn... We mention
this the rather that on the faith of the published and authorised denial
that the deceased gentleman's indisposition had been severe, it was
somewhat lightly alluded to in these pages, but a short time before
the subject became one for all seriousness.
Thursday. The DURE OF CAMBRIDGE entirely approved the Militia
project, so to arms bucolic brave, let your glorious banner wave,
fling down the grindstone and the sickle, study to reproduce the step
named from the goose, and the toby of alienemies to tickle. Of course
LoRD SUGDEN's little bill for cheapening conveyancing, avery little,
was withdrawn.
The New Zealanders want £500,000, and “ º as a matter of
form, you know,” ask JoHN BULL to guarantee the loan. When did
he ever refuse such a trifle P In the present case, however, it would
have been unfatherly to do so, as “imperial legislation ” has helped
them into difficulty.
Friday. The Bishop of LoNDON º an eloquent eulogy on
the prelate who recently bore that title, and who, as Bishop BLOMFIELD,
has quietly closed a life, many incidents of which gave cause for the
censure both of his theologi and political contemporaries, but which
was adorned by numerous social virtues and literary graces.
In the Commons MR. VERNoN SMITH, whom Mr. Punch begs to
congratulate upon an interesting family event, calculated to preserve
the honoured name of VERNON (not SMITH) to posterity, stated that
additional troops had been sent to Madras and Bombay, and as there
is nothing too large or too little for the House, another Minister stated
that he did not know as yet whether the new chimney-pots on Somerset
House would answer or not, because this is not weather for fires.
The Election Petitions are all disposed of. There were originally
71, but only 9 members have been unseated. The last, MR. GLovER,
seems to have been reserved for a frightful example—to be blown from
the gun of the House—for not only is he turned out of Beverley, but
the mode by which he got in is referred to the consideration of the
ATTORNEY-GENERAL. MR. GLOVER bawls that he is “persecuted.”
DR. BIRCH AND DR. PUNCH.
F there be one virtue more than
any other for which Mr.
Punch is eminently famous,
it is for the intensity of his
respect and reverence for all
who are in any way regarded
º, as “authorities.” From an
* Emperor with his crown to a
Beadle with his cane, Mr.
Punch is always notable for
the profoundness of the awe
with which he is impressed
by the insignia of govern-
ment; as well as for the
marked and deferential
homage which he pays to
every potentate, from a police-
man to a Pope. It is there-
fore with no ordinary feel-
ings of reluctance that he
feels impelled, for once, to
cast a doubt upon the wis-
dom, and, in some degree at
least, to question the
authority of certain consti-
tuted powers.
. It appears that the head-masters of our chief public schools, to prove
(it is assumed) that their establishments are match-less, have forbidden
the recurrence of the contests in Lord's Cricket Ground, which for
nearly half a century have been a yearly-coming pleasure to very many
more than merely those engaged in them. The step was taken on the
| ground that Lord's was nearer London than was good for the morals
of a school-boy in the holidays: an assumption which, if proved to be
well founded upon facts, would prevent Mr. Punch or any other parent
from sanctioning the presence of his sons as players. But the assump-
tion being yet unsupported by such proof, and there being a prepon-
derance of contrary opinion, Mr. Punch has doubts if the assertion be
worthy of belief, and of those doubts he inclines to give the boys the
benefit. Moreover, sooner than resort to the extremity of orderin
that the fifty years’ old custom must be wholly given up, Mr. Punc
conceives that the authorities might at least have tried to hit on some
expedient, whereby their Fº might, unharmed, have breathed for a
few days the baleful air of the Metropolis,
Tempting though the theme, Mr. Punch will not dilate upon the
virtues of a well-contested cricket-match; mor plagiarise those recent
correspondents of the Times, who, with a warmth quite in keeping with
the weather, have been praising and appraising the excellence and
value of this truly English game,” both as a physical and as a mental
stimulant. Mr. Punch regards cricket as a national institution: and
although the modern round shot bowling plays sad havoc with his legs,
he still stands firm to his belief in the national necessity of keeping up
the stumps. Conceiving there is truth in the paraphrased assertion,
that the games a nation plays are hardly less important to its welfare
than its laws, Mr. Punch will frankly own that he has little wish to see
is fellow countrymen in general descend to handling dominoes in the
stead of cricket-bats: and as he views, the forbidding of the public-
school matches as a step not unlikely to lead to such descent, Mr. Punch
is an advocate that it should be retraced.
As the classic has remarked, longun est numerare: or Mr. Punch
could cite a score of other reasons why his yiew of the matter is, as
usual, the correct one. For instance, might he not contend that the
course which has been taken, directly violates the principle of non-
interference of the masters out of school, which has been claimed as
the chief merit of our public system P And might he not be bold
enough to raise the awful question as to whether DR. BIRCH has any
lawful right to claim allegiance in the holidays, when his subjects have
been handed to their natural “governors,” or to such as stand to them
in loco governoris 2
Mr. Punch need scarcely state his willingness to credit that the Doctor
and his brethren have acted for the best; but he cannot yet believe
that the allurements of London are a sufficient ground to justify their
arbitrary act. Mr. Punch will grant that perhaps the immorality of
smoking a cigar, or swallowing an extra glass of Shandy-gaff or ALSOP,
may sometimes have resulted from going to a match; but such out-
rages as these will occasionally happen, even with the very best regu-
lated schoolboys, and to prevent their occurrence it would need the
constant presence of an Argus-eyed BRIAREUs, with an eye on every
action * a birch in every hand. Constituted as the world is at the
present, there may be contamination elsewhere than in town; and
since it is unwise to do things by halves, our sons should have a
master at their elbows all the holidays, to keep them from the scrapes
which schoolboy flesh is heir to. But with this continual benefit of
clergy (for almost every master now-a-days is pastor likewise), it may
be questioned if our sons would be very greatly benefited, even were
each tutor blessed with forty parson power of protective moral influence
on those committed to his charge. It would not much advantage boys
to live tied always by the leg, even were they tied to a bishop's
apron-string.

INGENIOUS TORTURE.
THE Chinese have invented a new species of Torture. They fasten
round the neck of a malefactor, the “all-round collar,” such as is
worn, by swells and fashionables in England. They then take the
malefactor out to some public place, and make him promenade up and
down for several hours at a stretch. The effect is not only painful,
but extremely ridiculous, and, inasmuch as the poor devil cannot move
his head either to the right or the left, the infliction excites the risi-
bility of the populace to such a degree that it is as much as the unfor-
tunate victim can do to submit patiently to the sarcasms of the mob
without resenting them. Criminals dread, this form of punishment a
thousand times worse than the ordinary pillory, or the wicker cage, or
the huge wooden collar that is usually suspended over the shoulders of
offenders that are exposed in public. It is called, the “ENGLISH
ToRTURE,” and causes a shudder every time it is exhibited.

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HUMBLE PETITION OF THE BRITISE LION
T0 MR, PUNCH,
IT’s wº beknown that old I’m grown, ain't the Lion as I used
o be :
What with Free-trade, and Foreign bread, a tame beast I’m reduced
to be ;
And up and down both field and town I’ve been trotted by all parties;
Till I'm muddled quite, and queered outright, and high broken my old
heart is. ow, wow, wow,
I only wants a quiet life, and not to have no row.
In stucco base, I takes my place, a top of each shop-front, Sir,
Red, blue, *g green, of sign-boards mean I’m druv to stand the
runt, Sir;
Rampant I grow, when Heralds go at me to take their flings, Sir,
"Cos 'twixt my jaws, and in my paws, they sticks all sorts o' things, Sir,
Bow, wow, wow,
Was ever Lion so abused as the British Lion now?
And there I am at Buckingham front door—I means, the palace—
At him as cut the figure put up there I bears no malice—
But, I must say, that if some day I met him in the street, Sir,
I’d let him know that lions too can carve-ajinto' meat, Sir.
Bow, wow, wow,
If he meets the British Lion, there’ll be an awful row !
But still I’d stop on sign or shop, or perched on palace railings;
Of Herald's hook the games I’d brook, nor ever break my palings;
But what will wear—and so I swear—my poor frame to a Mºi.
Is the way they treats a poor old beast, on them there tombs o' WEL.
LINGTON' Bow, wow, wow,
Was ever Lion treated as the poor old British, now?
They sarves me out, both slim and stout—shows me up big and little;
me opes myjaws, and pints my claws : some makes me a lick-spittle—
A spoony brute, that if you’d shoot, would never turn to hurt ye,
With jobbernowl laid cheek by jowi beside each Christian Virtue.
- w, wow, wow, -
Was ever Lion made to keep such company till now?
Some on 'em cocks me up on rocks, that to climb would queer a
monkey;
As if I’d roar, “Hoy, tuppence more, and up'ards goes the donkey!”
Some on all-fours, at tombstone doors, like a mute, has had me planted;
In short, they sticks me in like bricks, wherever a beast's wanted
Bow, wow, wow,
Was ever British Lions so cheap as they are now?
Both me and poor BRITANNIA sure, to death them sculptors rides, Sir;
With the Virtues and the Graces, and the dooce knows what besides,
Ir;
But dash my wig if I can twig wich is Wirtues and wich Graces;
I only knows they all want clothes, and is much like in their faces.
Bow, wow, wow,
Here’s your obvious allegöries four-score and four a-row !
This many a year in Westminstère, and also in St. Paul's, Sir,
I say 't with pride, I have complied with every sculptor's calls Sir;
But if this goes on, my crakter’s gone, and there ain't a tig’rish swell
in town
But’ll’ave his laugh and poke his chaff at me and myfriend WELLINGTON.
Bow, wow, wow,
Blest if I stand these monyments, without a jolly row !
CORRUPT PRACTICES.” PREVENTION BILL.
WE do not know the mature of the Corrupt Practices that the above
Bill is to prevent, but fervently hope it may put an effectual stop to
the following practices, which, in our opinion, are more or less
corrupt:—
The Practice that persons have of overpaying cabmen, so that when
the cabman only receives his just fare, he is sure to be dissatisfied, and
the person so paying him runs the greatest risk of being abused for it.
Practice that ladies have of wearing such corpulent dresses
as almost preclude them the entrée into respectable society, for the
simple reason that it is as much as they can do to squeeze Crinoline
etticoats of a circumference scarcely inferior to that of the Regent’s
#. through an ordinarily-sized door.
The Practice that certain absent, gentlemen have of walking in the
streets with their sticks and umbrellas protruding half-way underneath
their arms, so that the person, who is walking behind them, has a very
gºod chance, unless he keeps iis eyes perfectly wide open, of having
one of them seriously º or his face most disfiguratively scratched,
by the impertinent forwardness of the ferule.
The Practice that many women have of making an omnibus a
gratuitous Parcels' Delivery Company, by taking into it with them as
* bundles, parcels, and birdcages as they can carry.
The Practice that certain would be facetious gentlemen have of
telling º “a capital thing” they heard yesterday, when too
frequently the “capital thing” turns out to be a hoary-headed Old
JoE that the Oldest Inhabitant must have heard in his first infancy.
The Practice that shopkeepers have of carrying the awnings in
front of their shops so low down over the pavement that incurable
injury is inflicted on the hat of every gentleman who happens to soar
ever so little above the height of ToM THUMB.
The Practice that young ladies have of collecting autographs, or a
million postage stamps for a charitable purpose, or keeping an album to
which you are solicited to contribute, or a pet pauper towards whose
relief you are tenderly asked to subscribe—much to the persecution of
their male friends, who do not like to refuse for fear of being con-
sidered mean, or “a brute.” -
The Practice that thoughtless persons have of throwing halfpence to
Italian boys, and of sending out silver to German bands, greatly to the
annoyance of their neighbours who do happen to have ears.
The Practice that young gentlemen about town, who are extremely
innocent, have of saying, whenever Cremorne is mentioned, “Cremorne!
pray where is that?”
There are other Practices highly objectionable; there is the Practice
of encores, as practised at public concerts; there is the Practice of
speechifying and health-proposing, as practised at , private parties;
there is the Practice of medical men having themselves called out of
church, and of chemists assuming the functions of medical men by
giving “advice gratis” to the patients who come to buy their drugs.
There is the Practice, also, that lawyers have of sending in long bills,
which is a highly corrupt legal Practice; and there is the Practice,
likewise, that ñº, gatherers are perversely addicted to, of
calling regularly four times a-year—which is so corrupt a Practice that
the sooner Parliament finds a remedy, for it, the better, we fancy, the
nation will be pleased.
SONG OF THE SPORTING MEMBER.
THE Whitebait in QUARTERMAINE’s store-house,
The Grouse on the heathery hill,
Cry, “Ain’t Ministers coming to floor us?”
“Is nobody coming to kill?”
The old shooting-ponies wax frisky, -

The Red-deer in distant Glén-Whisky
Look out for the stalker in vain.

Its crew all ashore getting drunk.

And asks, “When’s he to º: up my trunk?”

Areasionished that business so slack 1S,
Sighing sadly, “Why lingers Milord?”
My wife and my girls ask what reason
#. August in London to spend,
With the balls, drums, and routs of the season,
Save PALMERSTON's, all at an end.
Hang all that prevents our escapes |
Hang Probate and Administration'
Hang Divorce—hang all forms and all shapes,
Of Canicular long legislation.
With dividing, reporting, committing,
e’re all of us worn off our legs;
Don't they know brains get added by sitting,
Exactly the same as hen’s-eggs?
To bed, after twelve there’s no summons
Of BROTHERTON, now, to invite ’em :
Do they fancy, like matter, the Commons
Divisible ad infinitum ?
There’s GLADSTONE, with argument voluble,
Proves a man mustn't part from his wife.
ut one union I know should be soluble :
To the House we were not wed for life.
We were not even tied till September:
One Divorce-Bill would have votes in plenty,
And that’s the divorce of each member

JONES TRIES HIS NEW HACK, WHICH
IS AS QUIET AS A LAMB–JUST ABOUT!
IRISH ANTI-PRIEST PRESERVER.
A PREVENTIVE of broken heads being far preferable to a plaster for
them, it is much to be desired that somebody would invent some
prophylactic of that nature, tending to moderate the party rage and
the personal violence attendant on Irish elections. How would the
Ballot answer? It is said to have failed in America, but it does not
therefore follow that it should also fail in Ireland, unless the reason
why it has failed in America is, to use a form of speech befitting an
Irish topic, because very, many of the American voters are Irish.
Tobacco flourishes on the American soil, and is capable of being grown
in Ireland; therefore, if the Ballot does not succeed well on the former,
it may, by some politicians, be inferred to be unsuitable to the latter;
but though this argument may very probably appear conclusive to
that eminent logician, MR. GLADSTONE, to ourselves and others it is
not quite satisfactory.
A better reason why the Ballot may be supposed to be ill-adapted for
a wild Irish constituency is that it works ...} in a club of English gen-
tlemen. But, after all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Why
not test the Ballot by tasting it? An act might be passed for the trial of
the Ballot, for the nonce, at the next Irish election. It might succeed;
and, if it failed, no harm would be dome. Nothing would be spoilt. It
might prevent broken heads and take away from priests the occasion
to curse and blaspheme, and threaten to deny the sacraments of their
church (as if they were charms or amulets) to the savages who are
superstitious enough to believe that the denial is of any consequence.
The idea of experimental reform never seems to occur to Parliament.
Now the Ballot is just the case for that sort of reform, and a body of
priest-ridden electors is just the body whereon, according to a beautiful
proverb, experiments ought to be tried.
An Unwise Complaint.
. SoME of LORD RAGLAN’s friends in the House of Lords have been
injudicious enough to complain that no monument has been erected to
that distinguished nobleman. Let them go to Westminster Hall, look
at the designs for the WELLINGTON monument, and be thankful.
ROOM REQUIRED OF COMPANY.
YE Muffs of understanding small,
Housed in the Street of Leadenhall,
Of Indian matters what a mess
You’ve made through sleepy senselessness,
And indolent cupidity!—
We’d rather have your room than your Company.
Qld gentlemen, you unawares, , .
Caught mapping in your easy chairs,
Your army in rebellion find;
And must, unless you’re deaf and blind,
From what you hear, distinctly see
We’d rather have your room than your Company.
In Parliament your jobs no more
Disguised, and glossed, and varnished o'er,
# interested rogues, you’ll get.
That House of yours in order set;
For on this point we all agree:
We’d rather have your room than your Company.
Solvent of Gold.
A.WAG of the Board of Examiners at Apothecaries' Hall asked an
applicant for its diploma, what Government measure was like nitro-
muriatic acid : The candidate could not answer the question—gave it
up. The Examiner said, “Why the Divorce Bill, to be sure, because
it will dissolve a wedding-ring.” The postulant went into convulsions
of laughter. He passed, of course.
Fortune is not so Blind.
WE accuse Fortune of blindness, when it showers, its gifts upon a
young prodigal. It is better, we think that a prodigal should have
them than a miser...The prodigal, at ail events, invites others to share
his good-fortune with him—the miser would keep it entirely to himself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE POLITICAL WARBLER.
A WEEKLY contemporary expresses dissatisfaction with the present
tastes of the young men of the humbler classes. Instead, he complains,
of their attending spouting clubs, and training themselves in demo-
cratic politics, they take their sweethearts to concerts, and listen to such
trash as “Minnie” and “ Bobbing Around.” From which effeminacy, of
| course, he-after the fashion of everybody with a grievance—augurs
the ruin of the country.
Mr. Punch is unable to share his contemporary’s alarm. The spouting
| club, bad as it was, was better than nothing, at a time when there was
no press for the people, and the press which existed was a mere organ
of parties. Now, there are plenty of good and cheap newspapers,
written by men of education and sincerity, from which a young man
may instruct himself in politics, without stewing in a publican's room,
and listening to clap-trap. And the probability is, that his sweetheart
is a better companion for him than any of the acquaintances he will
pick up at a spouting club. We don’t make a fight for the two songs
mentioned, on the contrary, both are indictable nuisances, but he may
| hear BEETHovKN and MozART for the same money, and either will do
his mind more good than the talk at places where “Gents visiting the
room are invited to take part in the discussions” with gin-and-water
accompaniment.
But all life is a compromise, and why not compromise this question?
| Let us have the concert-room, but let us have the political information
also. Why not introduce a series of songs, in which, coupled with
Wº: music, the great truths of the constitution may be taught.

i
We place the following specimens at the service of M. JULLIEN.
THE THREE ESTATES.
AIR-‘‘The Pirate of Blood.”
By the British Constitution
The Realm hath Three Estates,
Known by the different articles
They wear upon their pates.
The Sovereign sports a Diadem,
A Coronet the Peer,
And the Commons they wear common Hats,
Just like to this one here,
y boys!
Just like to this one here.
A King or Queen does no great harm,
We’ve hedged them in so tight;
But the haughty aristocracy
I hate with all my might.
And to call those precious Commons
Your delegates, or mine
Is a way that certain people have,
And it’s all uncommon fine,
boys!
And it’s all uncommon fine.
-
But there’s a good time coming,
Its date has been often axed
When all who please shall be M.P.'s,
And no man shall be taxed.
When we all shall have our soups and jints,
And we all shall equal be:
So here's to the noble Charter's pints,
And here’s for a pint for me,
My boys!
And here’s for a pint for me.
THE RIGHT OF PETITION.
A GLEE.
The Right of Petition involves no sedition,
'Tis a time-honoured right which all Englishmen claim,
And when discontent with your earthly condition,
Come up to St.Stephen's, and set forth the same.
Nay, never stop there, they detest innovation,
The haughty tax-eaters are deaf to your groan,
Spurn their dust from your feet in your łº indignation,
And lay your complaints at the foot of the Throne.
THE HABEAS CORPUS.
AIR-" Maid of Lodi.”
I sing the Habeas Corpus
That’s always sweet to me,
Because ’twas made on porpoise
To keep the Briton free.
No rascally oppressor
Can on our rights entrench,
While we’ve a Habeas, yes, Sir,
From the QUEEN’s-the Briton’s—Bench.
Of justice no denial
Our limbs in chains shall bind,
We’ll have an open trial
In the face of all mankind;
No sophistry shall warp us
To admit the slightest flaw
In the glorious Habeas Corpus,
The Body-Snatching Law. -
PARLIAMENTARY AND MINISTERIAL EDUCATION.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I AM anxious to enter the Army. However, an examination
stands in the way. I find that before wearing HER MAJESTY's uniform,
I must prove my inefficiency in more things than were ever dreamt of
in the philosophy of an officer before.
“Thus says the report that is just issued by the Council on Military
Education:—
“The Candidate, after producing medical and religious certificates, &c., will be
examined in Classics, athematics, English, French, other modern tongues,
#: and Geography, Geology and Mineralogy, Chemistry, Heat, Electricity, and
wing.
“There, Sir, I hope the list is long enough P Why, Sir, I doubt if
even the talented gentleman who writes the ‘Answers to Corre-
spondents’ in Bell’s Life—and he is supposed to know everything—
would be able to pass his examination in one half those acquirements'
I should like to know how many Members of Parliament, supposing
M.P.'s had to undergo an examination, would be able to carry them-
selves creditably through an ordeal like the above? It is my belief
that 600 out of the entire lot would be remorselessly ‘plucked.' I
ask, is SIR JAMEs DUKE well grounded in the classics What does
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, in spite of all the stones that have been flung
at him, know about geology P I should like to be informed if MR.
SAMUEL WARREN has any profound insight into the secrets of
chemistry, and whether MR. RoeBUCK has any extensive knowledge of
the mysteries of heat, beyond the heat of temper he occasionally
displays in debate? I should like to hear MR. DoNALD NicoLL
examined in the first four books of Euclid, and it would give me
infinite pleasure to see MR. WILSON put by PROFEssoR FARADAY
through a regular good course of electricity. We all know that LoRD
Joh N’s knowledge of the French is none of the deepest, and I should
doubt strongly if Lord PALMERSTON's acquaintance with mineralogy
went any deeper. And lastly, do you think MR. WiscouxT WILLIAMs
would be able for two minutes to stand an examination in English?
“My dear Punch, are we, young officers, such ADMIRABLE CRICH-
TONs, that we are supposed to have a touch of everything I wonder
when they were about it, that they did not, amongst the other
desiderata, include also a knowledge of cooking, photography, dancing,
tooth-drawing, and chimney-sweeping? -
“An officº is nome the better for being a dunce—but I do not
think an officer will be any the better officer for being a living Ency:
clopædia. How many mature public men, I ask, are mentally qualified
to prove their strength in one half the attainments demanded en haut
of a young officer under the age of 21: , Nay, as far as that goes, I
will put to you this bold question: ‘Would PRINCE ALBERT himself,
accomplished gentleman as he is, ever have attained his present dis-
tinguished grade as Field Marshal, supposing he had been subjected,
at every grade, to an examination as stiff as the above?’ -
“I have my fears, Punch, but still I hope to prove myself, in
due time, “A PAss-ABLE OFFICER.
“P.S. Why should not Ministers have to pass an examination? All
other persons, applying for Government situations, have to go through
that educational ordeal, and why should not they? If it is important
for us, and other servants of the Crown, I hold that it is doubly
important for them. I raise the cry, then, of ‘ExAMINATIONS FOR
MINISTERs!!’”
VERY LIGHT READING.
A DUBLIN paper in describing a human body lately discovered in an
extraordinary state of preservation in a peat bog near Mullingar, says
that—
“It appeared to be that of a strong muscular man, and exhibited no perceptible
marks of violence, except that the head was severed from the neck just on a line
with the root of the tongue.”
The exception seems a rather important one. Our Hibernian con-
temporary apparently makes light of a somewhat, serious mutilation in
virtually stating that the deceased person had only had his head cut off.

PROTECTION TO JURIES.
THE lawyers, it is clear, must mind what they’re about. If LORD
RAYNHAM's Cruelty-Prevention Act had passed, he would have been a
bold man who ventured to have anything to do with º'. a Jury.
Among the cruelties in common perpetration through t e kingdom, his
| Lordship very, clearly had an eye to the barbarities which, are being
*†, inflicted upon jurymen. By a clause especially devised for
their relief, the Bill included as an indictable offence—
| “The packing in any basket or box, or in any other manner, or keeping so
! packed, any fowl or other animal, so as by deficiency of space, air, or provision, to
cause distress or suffering thereto.”
And that no doubt may exist as to jurors having claim to the pro-
tection of the Act, it was afterwards provided that—
“The word ‘animal’ shall include any animal, whethor domesticated or not, and
whether a quadruped or not.”
It is a fair argument, we think, although perhaps it may not be
accepted as a compliment, that the frequent proofs of, asininity
in the verdicts of our juries should entitle them injustice to be treated
as humanely at the |. as other members of the long-eared race.
And since the owner of the donkey “what wouldn't go” would clearly
be condemnable for keeping it tied up, and cutting off its corn or
thistles, so should it be made an indictable offence to starve a con.
scientious jury who “won't go” to a decision. In fact, supposing
that LoRD RAYNHAM's Act were passed, and we were so unlucky as to
serve upon a jury, we should make a point of begging to be “written
down an ass,” that there might be no mistake about our having claim
to the protection of the Act; which, as it provides most stringently
against deficient air and provender, and iſ"..., restraint,”
would clearly be effective for the punishment of those who dared to
jury-box us up in a hot stifling Court of Law, and to reduce us by
starvation to delivering a verdict.
A Change for the Worse.
PRINCE ALBERT's new title of “Prince Consort of England” was
conferred, it seems, that H.R.H. might take his place among “royal”
instead of “serene” highnesses, at the marriage of the PRINCEss
CHARLoTTE of Belgium with the ARCHDUKE MAXIMILIAN of Austria.
We shºuld have supposed it better to be “Serene” in England, than
“Royal” on the Continent—as Continental Royalties go.
to the rock of Liberty. Motto: Such is Life.
FASHIONABLE SIMPLICITY.
TALK of the difficulty of an examination at the College of Surgeons !
Can the anatomy of the internal ear, can the sphenoid bone, can the
reflections of the peritonaeum, can the distribution of the fifth pair of
nerves, be compared to the anatomy of a complex fashionable costume,
when the following is the idea of a simple one, presented by Le Follet &
“It has often been said that simplicity is the best ornament for youth; thus, in the
country or at the sea-side, we recommend, as morning toilette, small padded quilt-
ings or jaconets, plain tulle skirt, with casaque to match, flat embroidered collars
and mousquetaire sleeves. For evening dress, English barège, mousseline de soie,
foulard de Chine; in a word, any light or simple material.”
..We should not like to get up the subject of fashionable dress with a
view to standing an examination in it. We would rather attempt the
Assyrian º or the Egyptian hieroglyphics. No amount of study
would ever enable us to master the mysteries of Le Follet ; and if we
were to cram them ever so diligently, the result would be ignominious
rejection. We should share the fate of the rose of loveliness. We
should infallibly be plucked. We should never so much as get over
even our little-go. There is something terrible in the technical momen-
clature of that abstruse periodical, Le Follet. It suggests, not only an
intricacy of construction in female apparel, which is fearful and won-
derful, but likewise a dire array of figures, representing the cost, to be
looked out for by anybody on whom will fall the liability of milliners’
bills. It is therefore calculated to make the thinking but not opulent
lover to start and pause with a shudder at the threshold of the Temple
of Hymen, if not to bolt in a fright from the sacred edifice.

PLAYFULNESS IN HIGH LIFE.
A LovELY Creature had just been warbling, “Drink to me only ºrith
thine Eyes.” There was a pause. Everybody stared unmeaningly at
each other. There was not a sound, save the splash of the gold fish
that, with unwearied fins, were carrying on their swimming-matches
round the large glass bowl, when Lord EDGAR Swan N (the lineal
descendant of the united houses of Swan N AND EDGAR) leant forward,
and said lovingly to his partner, “I wonder, by the bye, what kind of
| tipple it is that the Eye does drink?” “ Why, Champagne d’Ai, to be
sure!’ exclaimed the ever-ready AGNEs, and, tapping his fingers
playfully with her fan, she spilt the coffee over his legs. EDGAR had
new trowsers on that evening, but still he could not help laughing at
the readiness of her wit. -

“DUST, OH ! DUST, OH !”
WE have always felt that some signal and terrible yengeance would
come upon the inhabitants of the Quadrant. In their imbecile blind-
mess, and greed of gain, they caused the destruction of their Colonnade,
one of the few architectural features of London. They did so on the
principle on which a man, troubled at night by those insects which are
never found in Lodging-houses, Mºm, unless you've brought 'em with
you, M'm, or they've come with the things from ſhe wash—should,
instead of using detergents, burn his bed. The Quadranters com-

IN a very sensible letter on “Our soldiers’ dress in India,” a cor-

who remarks, “that the first duty of a General is to bring his men

observing this rule after a fashion of their own. On the field of battle
their men usually advance so very fresh that they may be said to come

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
August 10th, Monday. LoRD CAMPBELL burst upon the DUKE of
ARGYLL with a scolding for not making the marks upon posted letters
more distinct. The unfortunate postmaster pleaded the great number
of letters he had to stamp, but said that he was having a machine made
which would help him. Unless Mr. Punch mistakes, there is a pretty
story about this machine, and its reception by the authorities, one
which would not make a bad pendant to another pretty story that the
indiscretion of an Edinburgh Reviewer has recently brought out, vid
MR. CHARLEs DICKENs. - -
| In the Commons there was a debate about the new Public Offices,
and Government promised that they would do nothing in the matter
but take their coats off, in order to think intensely. Then in Supply
there was a fight on the £2000 asked towards making a National
| Portrait Gallery, and the word Picture has only to be mentioned in the
| House to bring on a storm of abuse on SIR CHARLEs EAST LAKE, and then
a feu de joie in his honour. This formality having been complied with
the vote was carried by 85 to 31. MR., HERBERT, INGRAM su gested
that a portrait of MR. SpooxER should be placed in the .
| This would be to enrich it with sculpture to an indefinite extent, for if
a certain head carried on a certain classic shield turned every beholder
to stone, the proposed portrait, especially if a good Anti-Maynoothian
expression were thrown into it, would have ten-fold power. MR.
INGRAM deserves credit for so cheap andlingenious a plan for creating
a hall of statues. -
Mr. Punch's intimation, last week, that the Act relative to Oaths
(which LoRD John Russell, thought would make a loophole for
BARON ROTHSCHILD), was not intended to apply to the House of
Commons, had been shown, before publication, to LoRD PALMER-
STON. It is hardly necessary to say that the Committee reported in
ºte with that intimation, and that the earth in question is
stopped.
. A ridiculous proposal to purchase a place of worship, for English
visitors to Paris was made, and was felt by the House to be so utterly
absurd that Government were placed in a minority of 88 on division.
The only excuse for such a thing is, that it is motorious that English
visitors to Paris conduct themselves much more like heathens than the
Parisians themselves. Folks who, here, are as decorous and stuck-
up as possible, do things and go to º there, which would scandalise
Parisian ladies and gentlemen. John BULL abroad certainly wants
religious hints, but as certainly would not take them, and therefore the
giving him a chapel is simply ludicrous. He likes to go to the service
in the Ambassador's drawing-room, because he thus gets into aristo-
cratic precincts, and, by the way, it is quite in accordance with Lord
CowLEY's reputed hospitality that he desires to get rid even of the
English who come to say their prayers in his salon.
Tuesday. IoRD GRANVILLE will not legislate about the Sale of
Poisons until next session, and meantime, will thank the poison-
mongers and others to read his Bill, and favour him with their
Opinions. -
LORD PALMERSTON explained that he had been talking over the
| Danubian question with the EMPEROR OF THE FRENch, and on the
whole he thought that England and Austria might fairly give way.
Does anybody besides Louis, PAM, and Punch know what the question
was Well then. PALMERSTON opposes the union of Moldavia with
Wallachia, first because it amounts to a dismemberment of º
for whose “integrity” we spent so many lives and millions; and,
secondly, because the new state would, he thinks, become Russian.
| The people themselves, being supposed to have some slight concern
in the matter, were asked to elect representatives to signify their
views. Moldavia has elected adversely to union. But the elections
were a good deal “managed” (French fashion) by Vogoripes and his
friends, and the unionist powers, France, Russia, Prussia, Sardinia,
declare the voting invalid. They bully the Sultan, and flap their flags
in his face, to make him take their view. PAM has two or three trifles
on his hands—India, for one—and does not want another; so he has
|aliowed Napoleon to persuade him to ºil sºrori, to advise the
SUITAN to give way. H. mind, does not prevent our kicking against
the union itself, should it be urged. And now you know all about it,
and we calculate there ain't a b'hoy in either House as could have
posted you up so uncommon slick. No, Siree.
An Indian discussion, including LoRD PALMERSTON's assurance that
the utmost vigour should be shown in dealing with the crisis, was
fºllowed by miscellaneous matters which kept the Commons up till
three o'clock. The Pimlico Improvements Bill was passed; but
unluckily without the clause for putting down the Cries which have
ruined Pimlico, by rendering it uninhabitable except by the lower
ºrders. However, a general clause, putting down all Street Nuisances,
including cries, perambulators, organs, round hats on females, Ethio-
pian serenaders, the carriages of quack doctors, mendicant street-
sweepers, remember-the-grottoes, head-over-heelers, fanatic preachers,
crinoline, and all other disgraces to the boasted civilisation of the
Metropolis, must be part of the New Reform Bill.
WOL, XXXIII,
Wednesday. MR. Roebuck, who is a very clever, but a very vain
person, and who likes to hear himself talk, whether he has sense or
nonsense to utter, emitted a good deal of the latter about the Bill for
}. the sale of Immoral Publications. He tried to imitate Lord
YNDHURST, but made a ludicrous failure. The Bill is to be amended,
and will, we hope, pass.
SIR CornwALL LEWIs made a financial statement, the chief points
of which were that he does not mean to reduce the Tea or Sugar duties
for nearly three years to come, and that the East India Company have
not yet had the impudence to ask for money to carry on the war for
remedying their blunders.
We are º to announce that the Wills Bill was passed. Let
every man who has not made his will immediately do so. He is a great
fool, and most cruel and unjust to his family if he does not. Such is
Mr. Punch's divine power of extracting a moral from the most common-
place fact.
Thursday. Some bishop delivered a huge speech justifying his con-
duct in reference to the non-consecration .." some place for burying
Welsh people. We cannot conceive anybody’s b. sufficiently
interested in such a matter to wish to hear another word about it, but
should any one be afflicted with such morbid curiosity, he had better
buy Friday's Times.
Parliament in 1855 refused to inflict a penalty on parochial officers
who neglected to put down nuisances. Now, members are being
oisoned by the stench from the manufactories near the river, and SIR
. HALL writes to the Lambeth Westry to move in the matter. The
Westry refuses point blank. It is hard that the innocent should suffer
with the guilty; but if there are in town any members who voted
against the penalty clause, we heartily hope that they are suffering
from the nuisance, as they will be all the readier to give, next year,
powers to punish the contumacious snobs of Lambeth.
The more Mr. Punch reflects, the more convinced he is that Woman
is the great impediment to Man’s living in peace and amity with his
fellow-man. Look at the House of Commons. Its leaders, with sun-
dry weaknesses, are accomplished, well-meaning, good-natured gentle-
men. They will discuss and order a war with half the world, they will
revise a whole system of taxation, they will frame a hundred laws of
vital importance, and however stupidly they may manage, it will all be
done with extreme courtesy and politeness. No man of sense will
lose his temper over such trifles. But, introduce Woman into the
discussion, and they immediately begin to insult one another. This
day the fivorce Bill was debated for ten hours, and nothing but
incivilities were exchanged. We do not care to record such instances
of weakness, let us rather take the more pleasant course of recording
one good thing of PALMERSTON. Among other amenities of MR. GLAD-
stone's (who is frantic against Divorce, and made twenty-nine
speeches against it this day) he called the Attor NEY-GENERAL
“a hewer of wood and drawer of water.” By the way, some people
think it profane to quote Scripture history lightly, but let ſº
ass. LoRD PALMERSTON, defending his attorney, said that as for
cwing, he certainly had cut away right and left at the enemies of the
bill, but it was very insulting of GLADSTONE to insinuate that they
were made of Wood, and that, as for “drawing water,” his speeches
might well have drawn tears of penitence from the eyes of those who
j been offering insincere opposition. This was very good of PAM,
and Mr. Punch hereby publicly claps him on the back, adding that he
was quite right in saying that he would sit there day by day and night
by night until the bill had passed.
Friday. That extraordinary LoRD CRANworth, who is always doing
the queerest things at the strangest times, seized the opportunity when
a grave discussion on the Indian crisis was appointed, to break into a
eulogy of the Court of Chancery. The business had never been in a
more satisfactory state, and when delays occurred it was the fault of
the suitors, not of the system. CRANNY then got back to his sack,
where he was safe, for LoRD ELLEN Borough looked very desirous of
taking him by the ear of his wig, and conducting him to the door.
An Indian debate followed, in the course of which LORD, PANMURE
said that a militia vote of £200,000 had been taken, with which it was
intended to embody 10,000 of the militia before February, when Par-
liament would be again assembled. These men are to be iiaced in the
arrisons weakened by the dispatch of the regulars to the east. Young
i. in the provinces must make up their minds to the change. It
may not be so great as they expect—we assure them that we know
several militia officers who are quite as handsome and foolish as any
in the army, and what more can a young lady desire?
In the Commons, Divorce again. Ri PALMERSTON and MR.
GLADstoNE made some mutual apologies for blowing one another up
the night before, and then the wrangle proceeded. At the end of the
night the Committee had agreed to the 27th clause., M.R. GLADSTONE
took an opportunity of denying that he had ". share in getting up
evidence to obtain the DUKE of NewcastLE's divorce. , Nobody sup-
posed that one of the most high-minded and honourable men in the
world had acted as a spy or ºft. but he undoubtedly favoured, and
in a measure promoted, a relief to the Duke, which, on principle, he
would now deny to other aggrieved husbands.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 22, 1857.
MR. Estcourt made a speech in favour of the Euphrates Railway, and LORD PALMERSTON,
again, condemning the Suez plan, considered that in all such matters, Government ought to
be only a Spectator. SIR FITzRoy KELLY then inquired, whether the KING OF OUDE were in
confinement, and why; and observed that his family here disbelieved that he could have any
share in the mutiny. MR. VERNoN SMITH made a very mild answer, to the effect that the
King was under restraint until an investigation could take place, when, if innocent, he would
be liberated. The same day, Mr. Punch happened to receive the Calcutta Englishman in
which newspaper an officer at Ghazeepore states his view of the case in somewhat less
delicate terms. He says:—
“What is to become of the King of Oude? I suppose Government will act energetically for once in a way,
and hang the fellow, and as many of his adherents as possible.”
Mr. Punch has only to add, that he thinks MR. HART, of the Trafalgar, has been unfairly

FULL MARCHING ORDER—THE PENANCE OF PANMURE,
THE EARLY CLOSING ASSOCIATION.
THE Fée; of this Association, curiously enough, have been taking place at the Crystal
Palace, whilst the adjourned debates on the Divorce Bill have been going on, morning and
night, in the House of Commons. Thanks to MEssRs. GLADstone, #. DRUMMOND,
Cox, and MANNERs, the poor members will be deprived of the Fête, with which they
enerally celebrate the early closing of Parliament, on the Moors in Scotland and other
eathery,places. Several of the grouse, wondering at the protracted absence of their usual
visitors, have begun to pair off for the next season. w
THE SONG OF THE HOUSE.
WITH patience threadbare worn,
With eyelids heavy as lead,
A Member sat in the Commons’ House
When he ought to have been in bed.
Sit ! sit ! sit
In dog-days, small-hours and frowse,
And as his place he couldn't quit,
He sang the song of the House.
“Talk! talk | talk ||
In the morning from twelve till four!
And talk! talk! talk!
At evening for eight hours more!
It’s, oh, to be a slave
At words instead of work,
With GLADSTONE and PAM for Fox and PITT,
And BETHELL instead of BURKE! |
“Talk | talk | talk! -
Till the painted windows swim;
Talk! talk! talk!
Till the lights in the roof wax dim |
Clause and section and line—
Line and section and clause-
Till on the benches we fall asleep,
And dream of making laws.
Oh, men, with incomes clear, -
Oh, men, with houses and wives,
What fools we are to be stewing here,
When we might lead easy lives!
Stick! stick! stick!
In the stench of the bone-boilers’ dirt ;
To hear GLADSTONE's taunts at BETHELL,
And BETHELL’s rejoinders pert!
“Talk! talk! talk! -
Our labour lasts night and day:
And what are its wages—nothing a-year,
And election bills to pay;
The right to stand on this matted floor,
The right to address that chair,
And the Times ablank—for I’m not of the rank
To be reported there.
“Sit sit! sit ! . . -
From weary chime to chime;
And to miss a division’s a crime.
Sit sit ! sit !
Amend, divide, and report—
Report, divide, and amend-
Till each section’s a riddle, the Act a maze
And a muddle from end to end.
“Talk! talk | talk! -
In the ººidsummer light;
Talk! talk! talk!
Through the sweltering midsummer night:
While all about the House
The bone-boilers’ odours cling,
To mock us with dreams of tiether, hills,
Where the grouse are on the wing !
“Oh! but to breathe the breath
Of the heather and gorse so sweet,
With my wide-awake on my head,
And my luncheon at my feet!
For only one short hour
To feel as I used to feel,
After a morning's blaze at the birds,
For an appetite for my meal!
With patience threadbare worn,
With eyelids heavy as lead,
A Member sat in the Commons’ House
When he fain would have been in bed.
Sit ! sit ! sit I
dog-days, small hours and frowse,
And as the debate he couldn't quit,
He tried to make the best of it
By singing the Song of the House!

TERRIBLY BITTEN By—(BUT NO, we will NOT MENTION THE HoRRID CREATUREs)—AND Is ADDREssED THUs By THE LodgING-
House KEEPER: “THEN HALL I can say, SIR, His—THAT, IF You've BEEN HILL-conweNIENCED BY 'EM, YoU MUST A BROUGHT
'EM Down WITH YOU IN YOUR PORTMANTEL!”
THE CHIEF CASE FOR LORD CAMPBELL’S Act
If LoRD CAMPBELL’s Bill for the abatement of the Holywell Street
nuisance passes, perhaps it will effect the abatement of a similar, but
worse, because more public, nuisance. The nuisance of quack doctors’
advertisements equals, if it does not exceed, the Holywell Street
nuisance in turpitude, and far surpasses it in magnitude. Instead of
being confined to an obscure lane, it is spread over a vast proportion of
the newspaper-press, and thus extended upon parlour and drawing-
room tables. Immediately under the eyes of th. female portion of
innumerable respectable families throughout the kingdom, are lyin
about advertisements unfit for the perusal of the º blackguard.
The evil is most conspicuous and glaring in the country journals.
Most of those London papers that admit these execrable puffs
thrust them into a corner—the Holywell Street department of the
paper—but our provincial contemporaries, in many instances, parade
them in large type, in the most conspicuous part of their columns;
perhaps in juxtaposition with the announcement of a missionary
meeting.
In many a newspaper, metropolitan as well as local, you find a
religious leading article on one page, and a series of these revolting
advertisements on another. We have only described one-half of the
evil of these nuisances. Not only do they rival, if not beat, the
Holywell Street nuisances in demoralising tendency; they are also
infamous as contrivances for purposes of fraud and extortion. They
are put forth by scoundrels, who pretend to be surgeons, with the
object of swindling weak and ignorant people. The dupes, for whose
deception they are intended, are nervous patients, who, conscious of
having committed some immoralities in the course of their lives, are
easily persuaded that their ailments are owing to those errors.
i.e. to confide their cases to the advertising quack, they are dosed
with sham-specifics for imaginary complaints, and charged exorbitant
fees, amounting in many instances to hundreds of pounds, which if
they refuse to pay, the quack threatens a public action, and consequent
disclosure of their confessions. The Lancet has done good service by
directing attention to a case in point. Surely those newspapers that
lend their columns to the lying professions of these rascals will be
comprised in the class of publications threatened by Lord CAMPBELL’s
ill. Even as it is, are they not open to indictment by the Society for
the ºrg. of Vice P. That Society, however, confines its efforts
to the Suppression of Vice in the slums, and makes no attempt to
exclude it from family circles. Wirtue lives in a pig-stye, and complains
e, it may be as well to
of a remote cow-house.
Whilst the advertising quacks remain at lar
mention some of the peculiarities by which i., may be personally
recognised. Many of them drive about Town in remarkable equipages.
They wear extraordinary and conspicuous beards and moustaches.
Their names are mostly assumed; almost every one of them has an
alias. We grieve to state also-because the circumstance we are
about to mention is one that tends to maintain an unworthy prejudice
against a particular class of our fellow subjects—that very many of
them are distinguished by the same peculiar features as those which
denote Sheriffs’ Officers and Old Clothesmen.
When Lord CAMPBELL’s measure shall have passed, we shall make a
tour of prisons, in the hope of having the pleasure of seeing at least one
of these fellows actively employed for the first time in his life, perhaps,
unless he has been similarly employed already for buying stolen goods,
either in grinding vigorously at the crank, or tripping it nimbly on the
treadmill
The Common Objects of the Sea-Shore.”
“Why publish a book under such a title?” writes a bilious Rams-
gate correspondent, “as if everybody, didn't know the commonest
objects of the sea-shore to be clumsy feet in buff slippers, and pretty
| faces in round hats.”

[August 22, 1857,
ANIMAL LONGEVITY.
* HE papers have been amusing themselves with giving the ages
. . of various animals. There are in the account, however, several
omissions, which we beg to supply. The age of the British Lion is
not given. This is an º oversight towards one, who has
made so much noise in the world, and, more especially, as he has lived
longer than all the other animals put together. The longest-lived
animal, according to Burron, (we should like to know how he verified
the age?) is the Elephant, who is said to live to the age of 100 years.
Now, the British Lion is considerably older than that, and is now as
young and as sº as ever. The way in which he is continually
wagging his tail is a proof of this. He will doubtlessly live as long as
BiºANNLA herself.
The British Lion's precise age may be ascertained at the Herald's
College, where, on the payment of a small fee, you will doubtlessly be
able to procure a certificate of his birth and baptism. The reader is
recºmmended to make the trial.
There is the British Unicorn, too, who stands nearly in the same
position as the Lion, and, perhaps, in the main, is quite as old.
There are other omissions which we deplore. There is the Russian
Bear, scarred and disfigured as he has been lately, and the French
Eagle, and all sorts of Eagles, belonging to Prussia, Austria, and
America, either with single or double, or as many heads as abundle of
asparagus. We ought to have been informed of their respective ages.
Talking of America, we find no mention made of the American Sea
Serpent, who, first discovered in a printer's fount, has since established d
a small Serpentine for himself in every well-conducted American news.
§ er. What is the Serpent’s age? We will not make inquiries about
ld Mother Hubbard's Dog, nor Little Bo-Peep's Sheep, nor the cele-
brated Cow who is reported to have jumped over the Moon, nor about
any of the clever animals, who have |...". so many ages in AEsop's
Gay's, and LAront AINE’s fables. ... Fortunately, they are still alive, an
have in them a longer lease of life than any herald can give them.
They are “not for an age, but for all time,” and will live co-etermal
with PUNCH's Dog Toby.
Advice to Angry Men,
Be, doubly careful in this hot weather. Resolutions, taken up
warmly during the day, should be put out all night, and looked at, when
cool, the next .# Above all, do nothing in the heat of the
moment, more, especially when that heat happºns to be not less than
85 in the shade. As has been pithily said, “The impetuous man, who

THE FINE YOUNG ENGLISH OFFICER,
AS HE IS TO BE.
I SING of one whom now that we’ve begun to educate,
The House of Commons lately made the subject of debate:
Whose qualities each Member vied with each to numerate,
And what their fancy painted him I’ll now proceed to state;
'Tis the fine young English Officer, as he is to be—in time.
His head so old on shoulders young with º; overflows,
Acquaintance with all sciences and arts its stores disclose,
All books and in all languages by heart almost he knows,
And he’s able to write . , and what is more, compose:
Like a wise young English Officer, the reason of my rhyme.
Italian, French, and Spanish, and Dutch, high or low, he'll speak,
Count Troy weight like a Trojan, tell the time of day in Greek;
And if to serve in India he be a chosen man, he
Will astonish all the natives in the choicest Hindostanee:
Like a polyglot young officer, fit for the future time.
Nor are his powers of body less than are those of his mind;
Quick eye, strong arm, and foot so fleet as ne'er to lag behind;
Good lungs, and constitution such as no fatigue can feel,
With iron nerves and sinews, and a heart as true as steel; . .
Has this brave young English Officer, to serve us in his prime.
A Centaur in his horsemanship, an ANGELo to fence,
In every manly pastime he makes way, nor makes pretence;
From battle-fight to fisticuffs good generalship he proves,
In glory's race a winner and a “wunner” with the gloves:
Like the plucky British Officer, of past and present time.
He can draw with equal credit an earthwork or a cheque,
Keeps a spotless reputation, and accounts without a speck,
Knows staff-duties and horseflesh, can out-bargain Greek or Jew,
Has ready wit at his command, and ready money too:
This accomplished English Officer, one of the coming time.
MORAL.
Now all you fine young Officers who'd mind your q’s and P's
The more you’re like this picture the more your Punch you’ll
Fight then your best with ignorance, count folly as your foe,
And while not less ornamental far more useful you will grow :
As befits the British Officer, pride of the coming time.

AN ACQUISITION FOR A FAMILY.
A WANT which will not perhaps be readily supplied is announced in
the advertisement following:—
WANº. some distance in the country, a comfortable HOME for an
INTEMPERATE FEMALE. A farm-house preferred. Apply by letter,
stating terms, which must be moderate, to C. A. B., , Royal Exchange.
The ambiguous nature of the description of the female for whom
accommodation is desired in the above notification will necessitate any
reply that it may possibly receive to be an inquiry as to its meaning.
Does the intemperance predicated of that lady mean violence of lan-
guage and demeanour merely, or addiction to $º, or, the
union of both these unpleasant deformities of the feminine character?
The expectation that an intemperate female, whether irascible only, or
only, or drunk and irascible too, would be received as an inmate
of decent, domestic establishment on moderate terms, is rather
Utopian, and taken in connection with the preference expressed for a
farm-house, is evidence of quite a rural or Arcadian simplicity. The
reception of the intemperate party, on any terms, could hardly be
expected, except of the proprietor of a coldwater cure concern, or the
keeper of a lunatic asylum, or a superintendent of those two institu-
tions combined.
A Question for Sculptors.
THE Statues of SIR RoBERT PEEL are numerous enough. . In some,
he is attired in the Roman toga—in others he is dressed in his own
private clothes. Now, is it not strange, considering how closely his
name is identified with the institution of the Police, that no artist has
ever yet thought of representing SIR. Robert as a Peeler?
THE SHOOTING SEASON.
Shooting has begun at Homburg, Ems, Spa, Wiesbaden, Baden-
Baden, and other places of º: resort. Shooting * on the
very same day as the opening of the gambling-saloons. N.B. Pistols,
on sale or hire, to be had at the different Ball-rooms.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR NATIONAL DEFENCES.
HE drafting off some thirty
thousand troops for India
has, of course, revived the
cry about our national de-
fencelessness, and nervous
members have been nightl
getting on their legs to as
what measures have been
taken for the safety of the
country, and to impress upon
LoRD PALMERston the policy
of its insurance from the
danger of invasion. Perhaps
it may in some degree relieve
the minds of these alarmists,
to know that Mr. Punch, far.
seeing as he is, does not
apprehend that peril to be
imminent: and that he, more-
over, has a #. at his pen's
point, by which we still may
sleep in safety in the absence
of our troops.
- Mr. Punch would suggest
that when its men-of-war are gone, England should rely on the protection of its
women. Encased as they are now in whalebone and in steel, they are thoroughly
well armed to act, on the defensive, and surrounded by their wide circumference
ºf petticoat, it is clear that they are quite secure from close attack. The sharpest
bayonet would fail to pierce through their stiff skirts, and except at a long range it
would be impossible to open fire upon their ranks, even granting that the enemy
were ungallant enough to do so. As for ºf them with cavalry, the havoc
ladies make with the boldest of dragoons is too well known for any horsementhus
to outdo Balaklaya, and rush madly, on their fate: indeed, were it attempted, the
longest-legged of chargers would fail, there is no doubt, to leap the hoops and other
outworks in which the ladies would be found impregnably entrenched.
Moreover, accoutred as they are at present, it is clear that our fair country
women are not only suited well to act on the defensive, but are eminently fit for the
offensive also: if gallantry permits us for a moment to assume that a lady can in
any sense be thought to act offensively. In the case of their attacking, who by any
ossibility could stand against their weight, now that every º (it is commonly
lieved) carries half a ton at least of §. about her; and from the way in
which they brush us off the pavement with their skirts, we feel assured that in a
charge they would sweep everything before them. By simply taking care to keep
a. F. or two about them, they would be well armed for the occasion of close
fighting: though certainly the notion of their coming to close quarters scarcely
seems compatible with the extent of their circumference: and in case of need, each
lady would be free to use her tongue, than which she could not wield a more
formidable weapon. So long as any, woman has a tongue in her head, she may
fairly be accounted armed to the teeth:... and we believe that the first yolley, were it
but of small talk, would cause the very boldest hearted enemy to quail; and induce
every man of them to lay down his arms, and run submissive into those of his
vociferous assailants. -
We have said enough to show, that the ladies would be sure to prove as irre-
sistible in warfare, as we are gallant enough to think they are in peace: and we
are convinced that in the case, of an invasion, they would rise as one woman to
otect their hearths and husbands. Our fancy fails to picture a more nobly-
uching spectacle than the wide expanse of Crinoline spread out to meet the foe,
and ourselves and fellow countrymen all hid from harm behind it. Nor in putting
ourselves thus under petticoat protection, should we be exposing our defenders to
much danger. A lady's Crinoline may now be regarded as her castle, and she is as
safe in it as though she were ensconced in Gibraltar. - -
Should our hints be acted on (and we have too much self-respect to imagine they
will not), we scarcely need suggest that the enrolment of our female troops, had
better instantly commence, as the recurrence of wet weather might a little damp
their ardour. While the present sunshine lasts there would be no lack of volun-
teering for the field, and the country might rely on seeing its defenders flocking
gut of town to it. From practising at pic-nics no doubt the troops would show a
fair acquaintance with º duties; and in order to familiarise their minds with
camping out, it might be found expedient to start a female Aldershot, at which our
better halves might now and then take up their quarters. They might there be
‘ exercised in military movements, and learn some motion of obedience to the word
of command. If smartly carried out, the order “Brandish Bodkins !” would
roduce a grand effect; and by a sudden movement to the word “Present
arasols!” the troops might safely frighten off a cavalry attack. We should think
too that in cases of extreme emergency, a rally to the war cry, “Draw Pincushions
—and Charge!” would strike terror to the hearts of the bravest of assailants.
As it would be policy, in the event of actual fighting, for the ladies every one to
put on their most killing looks, due attention should be paid to their effectiveness
of dress, and each corps should be furnished with a mill staff. In order to
secure the display of the best taste, the clothing Colonelcies should be reserved for
competition, and, be attainable not by purchase, but by merit. For the sake of
distinction as well as uniformity, the regiments might each one of them be dressed
in uniform, and take its name from its distinguishing costume and colours. The
absent Greys and Blues might be represented by the Lilacs
and the Pinks; and discarding as too masculine the words
'dragoºns” and troopers,” we might more filly speak of
out, high-mettled ladyguards as being “Light Balloons”
or “Heavy Iron Hoopers.”
Impressed as we are always with the sense of our own
wisdom, we are pººl to be called fools for the hints we
have thrown out. But the severest of our critics must at
any rate allow that the plan we have suggested for our
national defence would at least save the country from that
great loss of labour, which would result from prematurely
calling out the militia. These are mostly now engaged in
active operations, doing gallant duty in the harvest field of
action, and daily cutting down and carrying everything
before them. From such service to the state we should be
sorry to disturb them; and gallantry forbids our doubting
that the ladies would be welcomed as fair and fitting sub-
stitutes. At rate, whatever its defects may be, we feel
persuaded that the scheme we have proposed is in no way
more absurd than the fears which have suggested it.
ART-APPURTENANCES OF THE STREET.
...ON a direction board which shows the way to the scien-
tific and artistic collections at South Kensington, is depicted
a human hand, as index. The treatment of this subject
really evinces a very fair attempt at drawing and colouring,
manifest not only in the anatomy and flesh-tints of the
hand and fingers, but also in that little bit of costume, the
cuff, out of which issues the wrist. The hand is, in fact,
to use an outlandish º an Art-Hand, or an
Art Index. The idea involved in this Art Work might be
extended, with great advantage to the Art-Profession in
the encouragement of Art-Talent, as well as in the creation
of employment affording subsistence to struggling indus-
trious Art-Persons. Why should not ever finger-post be,
either partially or º an Art-Finger-Post:
The partial Art-style offin r-post might be such as that
exhibited by the model at º or the hand might
he carved, or there might be a whole arm with hand and
ſingers, instead of a mere hand, either carved or painted.
The Art-Finger-Post, entire might be a statue pointing in
a given direction with an appropriate gesture, Room for
reat variety of expression would be afforded. Thus, for
º: Street, for instance, the Art-Finger-Post might
be a figure of Justice with a drawn sword extended in the
direction of the gaol; or it might be the more modern
figure of a policeman indicating that edifice with his
truncheon, . The way to the Opera House, on the other
hand, might be shown either by a classic statue of Terpsi-
chore, or by the sculptured likeness of an actual ballet girl
—in the latter case the figure might be represented exe-
cuting a pirouette, with a leg outstretched instead of an
Arm, the index constituted by the great toe, and the Art-
Work, instead of an Art-Finger-Post, forming what might
be more correctly called an Art Toe-Post. Bishops, Judges,
Generals, Aldermen, and other leading personages might
afford designs for Art-Finger-Posts pointing to localities
connected with their several professions. To Art-Finger-
Posts might be added Art-Lamp-Posts, constructed on the
same principle, and likewise Art-Posts at the sides of the
street, with spikes on their heads, to prevent the boys from
spoiling their Art-Beauty in jumping over them.
The Fault of the Weather.
SIR. RICHARD BETHELL was reported by the papers to
have remarked upon MR. GLADstoNE’s perspiring during
his Anti-Divorce Speech. The learned Attorney-GENERAL
would seem to have been in communication with the press,
as on the fourth day afterwards we find an erratum;
“For ‘perspiration exuding’ read “eloquence bursting.’”
The words sound so exactly i.”. the reporters
might easily mistake. Either way, we take it, SIR RICHARD
intended to give MR. GLADSTONE a wipe.

A Medical Negation.
SINCE the particulars of the very equivocal
trial, that were published at full length in the
Lancet of August 8th, DR. KAHN has felt hims:
such a complete negative in the medical pro-
ſession, that he seriously intends altering the
name of his Exhibition to make it suit his new
position. Henceforth, he does not wish it to be
known as “KAHN’s Museum,” but, quite the
reverse; to be always honourably mentioned as
“THE MUSEUM or CAN’T.”
A PERAMBULATOR-TAX WANTED.
R. PUNCH, SIR, -- “Toll-gates
are a nuisance, soon to be
reckoned with things of the
past; but to my mind, Sir
perambulators are beyond
comparison a greater. Bein
a pedestrian as well as an ol
bachelor, I regard these in-
fantine infernal machines with
two-fold aversion. They not
only wheel against my corns
and make me limp in agony
and terror off the pavement,
but they bring me into con:
tact with nursemaids and
children, from whom it is m
constant prayer to keep aloof.
You may conceive then with
what pain the other morning
in the Times, I came across
the following:—
“Tolls on PFRAMBULATORS.–
The question “Are Perambulators
liable to toll º' has been decided
before the magistrates at Totnes.
| The decision was in favour of the
nursery, and the toll-taker was
condemned in the costs.”
... Sir, on, reading, this pathetic statement, my emotion, combined
with a small piece of egg-shell, nearly choked me. To get up from
the breakfast-table, search for pen and ink, and dash off three sheets
of condolence with that injured toll taker, was the work, if not of a
moment, at least of not above an hour. If ever man deserved a statue,
I consider he does. His noble, effort to emancipate the nation from
the thraldom of the nursery should win for him a niche between
WILBERFORCE and WELLINGTON, and be recorded in the most per-
petuating marble. As a national monument the work should, of course,
have the sanction of the Government, but as I entertain a wish to live
to see it finished, I have no desire that Government should have the
execution of it. Besides, their hands are full just now with their
|
designs upon the DUKE.; the carrying out of which may in due course,
I suppose, be expected to succeed the completion of the NEIson
Column, and be reported as ‘in progress’ at the end of the next
century.
“There is another work, however, which the Government might
easily get through with before they go to grouse, and which would do
the State—and especially the old fogy state—such service as would
amply make amends for an otherwise unproductive Session. . An Act
for the Abatement of the Great Perambulator Nuisance, would be an
Act of Charity for which every street pedestrian would feel ever after
rateful, and would add a dozen yards at least to the height of popu-
rity Lord PALMERSTON now stands at. To show how terribly the
nation is in need of some relief from these vexatious vehicles, I have a
mass of carefully collected statistics at my elbow, which throw a light
upon the subject that is perfectly appalling... I find that on one side
of Regent Street alone, the daily traffic of perambulators numbers
upwards of six thousand; and, through carelessness and furious
driving, an average of nine hundred and twenty-seven corms (fifty-four
per cent. of them belonging to old gentlemen) have, according to the
returns of the last six months, been wheeled over weekly by these
juvenile Juggernauts. With the knowledge of these frightful facts
you cannot wonder that I cry for a Perambulator Tax, and the heavier
it be laid on the lighter will my heart and spirits be in future. Indeed,
were this not so blessedly free a country, I should rejoice to see it
made penal to use a perambulator after eight o'clock A.M., and I would
dig the deepest dungeons for the punishment of those who dared to
disobey this salutary law.
“Sir, these vehicles of misery have too long stopped the way, and
every friend to progress must wish for their removal. For safety sake
their wheels must now be brought to ‘wo;' the nation’s weal impera-
tively, as I think, demands it. As being the Redresser-General of
Grievances, it is to Punch the nation looks for measures of relief. An
Act to impose a Perambulator-Tax, if endorsed with your approval,
might instantly be passed, and would be an act of mercy to innumer-
able myriads of my afflicted fellow-countrymen, as well as, Sir, to
“Yours, without gout, A Toe-MARTYR.”

Season, in St. James's Park.

PUNCH*S LITTLE POLICE COURT.
JUMPING ON A TRAIN IN MoTION.—A smart little boy, called
JoHNNY Jos Es, not more than nine years of age, was brought up
before Mr. Punch for jumping on a Train whilst in motion. A lady,
whose name, from a feeling of gallantry, we suppress, said that whilst
walking down Regent Street yesterday, she felt a heavy, pressure on
her dress behind. On looking round, she saw the defendant standing
on her train. The jerk had been so sudden - -
her dress had nearly been wrenched off her back. As it was, it was
completely pulled out of more than one-half the gathers round the
waist. She considered the dress, which was a love of a Barège, only
of this last year's Spring Fashions, was completely spoilt. She esti-
mated the damage done at not less than £3 158.
Johnny Jon Es, upon being asked what he had to say, declared as
how he couldn't help it. It warn’t no fault of his’n if ladies would
take to wearing their toggery so long as they did. W. this 'ere un
was at least two yards long, a-dragging ever so far behind the Lady;
He was very sorry—that i. was but bless his lucky, if he could
help it. He never saw the Train till he was right apon it. -
r. Punch said this was evidently an accident. Such accidents
would not occur, if ladies would not wear their dresses so long.
damage was done, the ladies had only themselves to blame for it. The
damage was doubtlessly very annoying, but it might easily be avoided
by the dress, being curtailed. The present length of ladies' dresses
was, to say the least, a nuisance carried to the greatest extreme. It
touched on the very borders of ridicule. It was of benefit to no one,
excepting, ...” the crossing-sweepers, whose birch-brooms it cer:
tainly saved a deal of muddy labour; and it must unquestionably entail
interminable annoyance, and expence without end, on the fair creatures
who wore them. Of the breadth of ladies’ dresses, he would not at
present, say a word; though if called upon to adjudicate between the
two evils, he might perhaps venture to remark, that the one was quite
as broad as the other was long. If every case of jumping on a train
whilst in motion was brought before a Magistrate, the consequence
the blow so violent, that |P
would be, that at least one half of the lovely beings who were in the
habit of attending a QUEEN’s Drawing-room would have to appear at
the bar of a police-office the next morning. It was notorious that at
Court collisions between trains occurred every other minute, and the
expence that resulted from such accidents was doubtlessly such as to
cause alarm even to the stoutest purse, but those cases very wisely
were never brought into Court. he said before, the remedy was in
the hands of the ladies themselves—or their milliners’ hands—though,
robably, the latter might object to the cutting-down of the dresses, as
it might have the effect of cutting down their bills. It was simply a
}. of shear comfort. He would suggest to the ladies, therefore,
the judicious use of the pruning-scissors.
The case was dismissed.
Mutability of Fashion.
WE think we cannot better prove the mutability of Fashion than by
printing the two following interesting facts. They have the further
advantage, also, of proving the rapid change that occasionally takes
place in young ladies’ tastes:—

THE Visit to Osborne was a private one. None but Policemen were
admitted. Are we to conclude, therefore, that Louis NAPOLEON's
Privacy consists generally in being surrounded by some forty or fifty
Policemen?

Louis NAPOLEON in his old dress of a special
constable. He should be taking an affectionate
farewell of his faithful Police. On one side there
should be the English Police, his former com-
panions on duty; and, on the other side, there
should be grouped pathetically the French Police,
who accompanied him from France. PRINCE
ALBERT would be shown in the background,
overcome with emotion. The QUEEN might be
elegantly introduced at the back, waving her
handkerchief from the balcony. Not only might
the Picture, with such strong incidents, be made
most effective, but it would also contain elements
of truth, which historical pictures do not always
possess. The two sorts of veteran Police
admitting of a great variety of costume, would
form a most admirable group. An old mouchard

PARLIAMENT.
UGUST 17. Monday. LoRD
CAMPBELL pictured MR.
ALLEYNE, the founder of
Dulwich College, “start-
ing from his grave,” and
signifying his approval of
the Dulwich College Bill,
as framed by the Lords.
So solemn an image of
course convinced the
Peers that they ought to
disagree with the Com-
mons' amendments, and
they did. The question is,
who shall be the governing
body—the Commons' plan
tending to parochialism.
The proposal to admit a
few children of Actors to
the benefits of the charity
founded by an actor who
made his fortune on the
stage, has been entirely
rejected with the lofty con:
tempt characteristic of
Respectability. Later in
the week the Commons
resolved to stand by their
amendments, and MR.
KNIGHT roundly abused all the Dulwich fellows as robbers, and the
bill as “a compromise with the Devil.”
The Commons began again at Divorce, and gentlemen amused them-
selves all the morning by conceiving every variety of scandal, and
setting each case before poor SIR RICHARD BETHELL, to know what
| he would do with it. The debate would furnish a variety of invaluable
hints to French novelists and their English imitators. The same
remark applies to the nocturnal sitting, at which, moreover, by a very
large majority, was rejected areasonable proviso, inserted by the Lords,
that cases where the details were offensive to public decency might be
|*|| in private.
Here let Mr. Punch interpolate a word to his contemporary, the
Morning Star, with certain of whose doctrines he is in the habit
of cordially disagreeing, and whose Peace-Idols he has had fre-
quent occasion to smash. There can be no º therefore, of
Mr. Punch's sincerity, or of his lofty and superb chivalrous courtesy,
when he raises his hat, as he now begs to do, to the Star, in token of
recognition that the journal in question, on occasion of a recent and
most disgusting trial, came forth, alone of all the daily press, divested
of a report which made all the other newspapers unfit to be laid upon
the table at which Judy presides, and her daughters assemble. Sapiens
dominabitur Astro, by which we mean that every sensible editor ought
to take example from the Star.
The only other noticeable things in the Commons were, first, that
MR. VERNoN SMITH, under cover of the battle-smoke, skulks' from
bringing forward an Indian budget this year. He may go, for it would
evidently be, under existing circumstances, a mockery. Secondly, that
some canting clap-trap about a man's house, being his castle was
idiotically advanced in opposition to a useful, bill for preventing the
overcrowding of the dwellings of the poor—a bill for which it is stated
that the poor are most desirous. MR. Ayrton, who, though too gar:
rulous, has some brains, (at least for a Metropolitan Member) talked
this rubbish. A man’s house may be his castle, but if he makes his
moat a nuisance, it is all our eye to say we must not take that mote
out of our eye.
Tuesday. The world was, delighted with the prospect of a row
between the two most amiable men in it, SUGDEN and BETHELL, the
latter of whom had indulged in some caustic sarcasm at the expense of
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF
a bill for pºſing honest Trustees, which the former had prepared
with much care. SAINT L. expressed his opinion of SIR. R., and of his
“confidence,” (Parliamentary for impudence) to-night, and the retort
was expected at the earliest convenient opportunity.
LoRD GRAN VILLE intimated to some fºliº Peers that the
would have to sit until the Commons had done with the Divorce }.
and then to take the amendments into consideration, as Government
meant to pass the measure. There is º dreadful difficulty in getting
egis , born or elected, to attend to their business. They will be
clamouring for an Early Closing Movement next, and placarding the
walls with, “Please make your Speeches before 7 o’clock.”
The Commons on Divorce. The clergy fº half a victory, carrying
a proviso that they need not, unless they like, read the Marriage
Service over any person who shall have been divorced for his or her
offence. They desired to refuse marriage altogether to the guilty party,
but the lay mind saw impolicy and cruelty in this priestly demand, and
would make only the concession above mentioned. As there is a
Registrar in every district, whose certificate is exactly as good as that
given by the smirking parish clerk in the vestry, and generally much
more neatly written, the practical result of the alteration is infini-
tesimal. . It is more pleasant to note that clause 54, abolishing the
Husband's Action for Damages, was carried by 78 to 46. It is, how-
ever, proposed to reserve a power to inflict pecuniary penalty in
certain cases.
The Crowded Dwellings Bill came on again, and more clap-trap was
talked. MR. P. O'BRIEN gave MR. Ayrton a very smart rebuke for
his dogmatic loquacity, and “Cox the attorney” talked some insuf-
ferable nonsense about LoRD PALMERston, who, Cox said, “wanted
to play WAT TYLER with the people of England, but that they would
be able to find persons to play the tyrant against him.” If one could
suspect an attorney of what MR. MACAULAY calls the “generous
vice,” one would think Cox must have been at the Claret, but as
natural history negatives, such a presumption, we must find another
method of accounting for his folly, and this is it:—
“The pert BILLY Cox,
He is not an Ox, -
Though you mayn't think him greatly above it;
ut allow him his ºf
As the next mentioned thing
. The commandment forbids us to covet.”
Wednesday. The Impure Books Bill advanced, and the Committee on
the Divorce Bill finished its labours. SIR. R. BETHELL, taking into
consideration that a Church belongs in some measure to the parishioners,
and is not quite the parson's private apartment, introduced a clause
enacting that if one Clergyman did not choose to marry Divorced people,
another might be brought into the recalcitrant's Church to do it, and
this was carried by 73 to 33. .
Thursday. It was explained to LoRD SHAFTESBURY that the opinion
of the law officers of the Crown, on the Opium question, was, that the
East India Company had a right to grow it, and to send it to Chin
but perhaps they had better not. Lord Repespa LE solemnly pledge
himself to oppose the Divorce when it should come up from the
Commons.
In the last mentioned place the last mentioned bill received some
amendments, chiefly affecting the property of married women, and
LoRD PALMERstoN made rather a spirited speech upon the national
defences, which he considered would be quite satisfactory, provided
our big ships were not sent away. The clamour against the Crowded
Dwellings º and the evident intention of its opponents to defeat it
by delay, induced MR. CowPER to withdraw it for the present, which
he did, with contemptuous observations on the character of the
opposition. -
Friday. Punch is happy to say that his friend LoRD CAMPBELL’s Bill
against bad books passed the Commons in a state which was satis-
factory to its parent, who professed his delight. LoRD Monte AGLE
took'an opportunity of praising the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER
most highly, and of declaring that our financial policy was opposed to
all common sense. LoRD REDESDALE withdrew his solemn, pledge to
oppose the Divorce Bill, but professed himself in a dreadful rage at
the way the screw had been put on by the Government.
LoRD PALMERston, in answer to WiscouxT WILLIAMS, (we vary the
spelling in compliance with a requisition from some of his lordship's
vassals,) stated that no application had been made by France for ex-
tradition of refugees, and if it had, we had no power to hand them
OWer.
Mr. Punch cannot more pleasantly conclude his week's résumé than
by announcing that, amid loud cheers, the Divorce Bill passed the
British Commons.
Superstition.
. A WoRTHY friend of ours, but who is imbued with very strong pre-
judices against the Irish, says that the failure of the Atlantic Telegraph
Cable may be entirely attributed to the fact of its having started from
Ireland. He alludes to the well-known habit of improvidence among
the Irish, and asks the Directors, how, with the system of “paying
out” that is generally pursued in Ireland, they ever could expect to
make both ends meet 2

are terribly alarmed that the new law will have
the effect of materially weakening their power,
besides sensibly diminishing the amount of
prestige that has hitherto been so beneficially

they will no longer submit to our interference,

We hope these fears are unfounded, though,

Divorce Law has passed, of several cases of a
most painful character, in which the husbands,
defying all control, have risen, and shown their

CoNSIDERING the great advantage to trade which has resulted
from the fashion, now and for so long a time prevalent amongst ladies,
of wearing enormously wide and long dresses, certain leading tailors
have, we understand, combined, or rather conspired, for the introduc;
tion of a corresponding style of male costume. Negotiations will
immediately be attempted with eminent Swells with the view of
inducing them to start the contemplated novelty; of which the fol:
lowing are the principal particulars. The trousers are to be increased
to six times their present circumference, and to be elongated by several
inches below the boots, so that, in walking, it will be necessary for the
wearer to hold them up, lest he should be entangled in their termi.
nations, and tumble down. The tail of the coat will receive an increase
of length to the amount of several yards, insomuch that it will trail
along upon the ground, and this long-tailed coat will be worn not only
in drawing-rooms, but also in the streets, without regard to weather.
º among men is the mean instinct of aping their so-called
etters, that the associated tailors have no doubt whatever that they
have only to persuade a prince or a distinguished nobleman to wear
the draggle-tailed coat, and the huge trowsers, to ensure the general
adoption of those awkward absurdities.
A HOSPITAL FOR MANGLED ENGLISH.
HERE is a paragraph, which is flying about the papers. It is but a
small gnat, but still it is worth putting out of the way as soon as pos-
sible, for fear it should annoy others with a Lindley Murray skin as
sensitive as our own :-
“The Lancet states that a new remedy for neuralgia has been for some time pre
scribed with success by DR. O'Connor, one of the physicians to the Royal Free
Hospital, in the cases of patients suffering from that very painful affection under his care
at the above hospital. The remedy used is the valerianate of ammonia, &c."
It is scarcely fair to DR. O'Connor to say that all the neuralgia
patients are “suffering under his care.”. If the above is a healthy spe-
cimen of the English they turn out of the Free Hospital, we do not
think, every time, “PRIsciaN's head” was broken, that we should feel
inclined to send him there to have it made whole again. The Com-
mittee had better contract with the Orthopedic Hospital to under-
take the cure and management of their lame sentences, for we neversaw
a sentence set so badly as to halt and stumble like the above. The
worst of its stumbling is, that it trips up most shamefully a noble art,
and, with unparalleled bru floors a worthy physician. You

other style of hat will be remarkable for an º conformation,
resembling the present hat except as to the brim, which will be
expanded to a periphery equal to that of a moderately-sized round
dining-table...It is ài. that this new style of dress for
gentlemen will find no little favour in many quarters: for the swelling
trousers will conceal the tumefaction of corpulence, as also bandy legs,
knock-knees, flat feet, corns and bunions. The chief objection to it is

FOOTMAN’S FINERY.
JENKINs, after a long absence,
has returned to the Morning
Post, in the character of a
writer of “Letters on Cos-
tume” under the signature of
“MANICA.” In one of these,
true to his order, JENKINs
defends the jackanapes cos-
tume of the last century, to-
gether with the use of hair-
powder. He greatly extols
the cumbrous head-dress and
embarrassing petticoats which
constituted the female attire
of the period, as serving, to
distinguish ladies of quality
: from their servants. MR. JEN-
KINs says:–
“None but those of some preten
sions to fashion could afford either
the time or money for dressing the
“head" according to the mode, and
the slight constraint of the ample
drapery and flowing train rendered
it inconvenient for those who had
to sweep, scrub, or clean. Let all, if
possible, be arrayed in elegant and
tasteful costume, but let a lady, a
real lady of rank, birth, and fortune,
appear, when at home or in society,
in a dress that at once indicates her
station—a dress which displays in
every part the care it takes of every
ortion of the fair and refined crea-
ure it adorns like the golden setting
of a precious diamond; and such a
dress we conceive to be perfectly realised in some of the costumes from 1750 to 1780.”
MR. JENKINs even applauds the wigs of the last century as convenient inventions, saving
the time and trouble of hair-dressing, and, on that account, showing sense on the part o
those who adopted them. JENKINs thinks that there was wisdom in the wig. He also
praises those ugly and clumsy things, high-heeled shoes—with which MothHR, SHIFTON has
ridden away on her broomstick. It is rather strange that JENKINs should base his com-
mendation of the female costume on the ground of the distinction which it preserved between
a lady and her maid, whereas his admiration for contemporary male attire, is evidently
due to the circumstance that it was such as to render a man indistinguishable from his
master, otherwise than by his manners and language.
We fear JENKINs is a presumptuous footman, and thinks his lady's maid no match
for his lady's man. However, we hail the re-appearance of JENKINs in the columns, of
our fashionable contemporary, which we suppose, he will continue to grace with, his
elegant contributions until his people return from their tour to that mansion in Town which
they have left him in charge of.
CONSTERNATION IN THE GREEN ROOM.
John BAIDWIN, BUCKSTONE, Esq. is in a state of nervous alarm lest the “Crowded
Dwellings’ Prevention Bill” should act prejudicially to the interests of his theatre. He
says if the Bill applies to “Crowded Houses” as well as Crowded Dwellings, he may as
well close his doors at once, for he should be infringing the law eyery night. #. declares it
is not his fault if the Haymarket is continually crowded; and he is not ambitious to have a
body of the Police Force breaking into his Pit, his Gallery, and his Boxes, and turning one-
half of the audience out. Overwhelmed with these fears, he formed himself into a deputation,
and in that capacity, waited on Tuesday last, on MR. Thomas SLINGSBy DUNCOMBE, M.P.
for all the theatres, for the purpose of laying his apprehensions, before him, and to beg of
him to use all his theatrical influence to get a clause inserted in the Bill, specially exempting
the Haymarket Theatre from the penalties that the unavoidable circumstance of “Crowded
Houses” night after night would unquestionably expose it to.
This deputation, consisting of J. B. Buckstone, Esq.,was joined on the door-step by MEssRs.
WEBSTER, EMDEN and Robson, whose breasts were apparently heaving under precisely similar
fears. The interview lasted a good hour. The particulars of it have not yet transpired,
but we augur that it must have been of a highly agreeable, if not convivial, nature, inasmuch
as, not only was the cabman paid most liberally . the time he had been kept waiting, but the
faces of the three distinguished dramatic plenipotentiaries were observed to be radiant with
º besides being luminously enveloped in fumes of tobacco of the most fragrant
escription.
Corrupt Practices.
You are not allowed to purchase a seat in the House of Commons, nor to be guilty of
bribery, or corruption, in any way, to obtain one. We hope the corrupt practice of purchasing
your seat in the, dress-circle of a theatre by #. a shilling to the box-keeper will speedily
e done away with. It is an underhand bit of bribery that managers ought to be ashamed
of allowing their agents to be parties to. Box-keepers should be directed, under pain of
dismissal, that they are no longer to fleece playgoers to the tune of “Bobbing Around.”
Considering that every play-bill from their hands
costs a shilling, it is not too much, if it is not too
vulgar, to say that every Bill is a Bob.
THE LAY OF THE SEA-SIDE B"G.
|
I
I AM a Bºg—a sea-side Bºg,
When folks in bed are lying snug, |
About their skin I crawl and creep,
And feast upon them while they sleep,
In lodging-houses, where we breed,
And at this season largely feed. |
When scorching suns the verdure wither,
From Town nice people come down hither:
I have at my command
The fat of all the land; |
An Alderman sometimes I bite,
• For weeks together, every night,
Then, oh! then, I’m in good luck;
Essence of turtle-soup I suck,
With extract of full many a haunch,
That oft has lined his worship's paunch.
And goodness of a sea of gravy,
Big enough to float a navy.
Hither a Rector sometimes comes,
Leaving his Curate in the slums,
hen he’s buried in repose,
I fix upon the Parson's nose,
Oh, how delightful! oh how jolly!
But I may repent my folly.
Giddiness my head doth trouble,
And in the moonlight I see double.
Too much Port I find I’ve taken,
From the red somorous trunk,
Then I tumble down dead-drunk,
With a headache to awaken.
Maidens are my choicest treat;
Pretty girls are very sweet,
On those tender lids that veil
Their bright eyes, I oft regale.
Eye-lids, tasted by my lips,
Eyes of light next morn eclipse;
On their cheeks and in their dimples
Do I leave my mark in pimples,
Flowers of Beauty look #. funny,
When the B. has sipped their honey.
But, at times, I do, Iown,
Wish I had left the girls alone;
Washes used for the complexion
Having poisoned my refection
Qn their medicated features:
Charming but permicious creatures |
A rich old lady will, with me,
Occasionally disagree,
And so will an unwholesome fellow,
Whose hide is stained with bilious yellow.
A babe affords me pleasant diet,
When it will let me feed in quiet ;
I revel, in the hour of rest,
Upon the flesh of every sleeper,
But one—and her I ne'er molest,
By her I mean my own housekeeper;
Against me whilst she makes no stir,
I’ll never interfere with her '

COCKNEY FASHIONS FOR THE MOORS.
A RESTING-PLACE FOR RICHARD COEUR DE LION,
BARON MAROCHETTI’s RICHARD COEUR DE LION has been wandering
about town ever since the Great Exhibition. It cannot find a spot on
which to rest its aching bones. It is the Wandering Statue of London.
At one time it took up its stand in Palace Yard, raising its sword
valiantly on high, as though it were going to slash into the surroundin
cabmen. But SIR CHARLEs BARRY drove the horse and its roy
master very quickly away. The poor beast has been trotted, we
| believe, into every public space in the Metropolis, and trotted out
* It must know every stone round the Houses of Parliament.
| If it was only paid like a common cab-horse, at the rate of sixpence a
mile, BARON MAROCHETTI, would have a large sum as mileage to
receive. Never has a poor horse been driven so recklessly about the
streets . It is very clear mere flesh and blood could never have stood
it. Lately, the W. osition has been raised to put it on the top of the
| Marble Arch. e }. the raising will be limited to the proposition.
|At the other end of the park, there is already a monster horse outside
an arch. That one is quite enough. We cannot believe that the public
| are anxious to have another horse riding through the air. London
would then have, like Yorkshire, its East and, West Riding! They
may try to put him up, as the Duke was hoisted, by way of an experi-
ment, but we do not want to be exposed to another trial like that.
| We know that statues, like the price of bread, when once they get up
are exceedingly slow in coming down again. Poor RICHARD had
better turn his horse's head in the direction of Burlington House.
There is a large courtyard there, in the centre of which he might be
allowed to stand, º the mighty sword which “Richard, 6 mon Roi!”
is brandishing, might be a little out of place amongst the quiet imple-
ments of science by which it would be surrounded. Or, there is Buck-
ingham Palace : In that quadrangle, there is Fº of room for the
Statue to stand at livery, and the Prince might have this highly-chased
| work of art perpetually under his own eye. He would look on the run-
| away pair from the §. Exhibition with eyes of affection—for the
PRINCE, should rumour for once speak true, is rather fond of riding the
|High horse himself, in all matters relating to High Art. In the mean-

RUFFLANLY ASSAULT ON A CLERGYMAN.
THE columns of a contemporary contain the following
cool statement of a ferocious outrage:–
“SALE of AN Advowson.—Yesterday, at the Auction Mart,
Messrs. Norton, HoggaRt, and TR1st, offered to Public Auction,
the advowson of the rectory of Cold Higham, Northamptonshire,
with a glebe farm of 260 acres in lieu of tithes, of the annual value
of £500, irrespective of house and gardens. The age of the incum-
bent, 66. Knocked down at £3000.
The idea of knocking down a man of 66 years of age,
and that a clergyman, cannot be contemplated without
indignation and disgust. Imprisonment should await the
Savage assailant, whoever he was, and whatever may be
his rank or station. No fine will be any sensible punish-
ment for the bravo–if we may apply such an expression
to the perpetrator of so cowardly a deed—who has received
the sum of £3000 as the hire of his brutal service to out-
rage the person of an aged minister. Many years, how-
ever, may yet be added to the life of the reverend gentle-
man, and we hope he will live long enough to disappoint
the party, that has speculated on his decease—notwith-
standing that he has been knocked down in so barbarous a
IIlanllet.
NEWS FROM THE RIVER,
THE 'Directors of the River Thames Steam-Fleet
respectfully give notice, that in order to meet the wants
of the age, and to remove cause for the bitter and
sarcastic complaints made by Old Bachelors, Widowers,
Men with Mothers-in-Law, and other misogynists, against
the incessant matrimonial suggestions offered by the
names of the River Steam-boats, alterations will be made,
next season, in the names of the following boats, viz.:-
Bride, Matrimony, inster,
Bridegroom, Wedding Ring, ascinet,
Bridesmaid, Bachelor, Baby,

THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND AND THEIR SLAVES. T.
THAT faithful disciple of the PROPHET, MR. LUTFULLAH, in his
autobiography, º the English people a splendid character—with
the following sole drawback:-
“Their obedience, trust, and submission to the female sex are far beyond the
limit of moderation. In fact, the freedom granted to womankind in this country
is great, and the mischief arising from this unreasonable toleration is most
deplorable."
We quote the above extract because we are sure that it will be read
with emphasis in many a domestic circle by the head of the family, and
master, so called, of the establishment. MR, LUTFULLAH saw a good
deal of life in England, and he may perhaps, have got among a society
of scientific and literary ladies. One would like to have been present
at such a party, and to have heard him give utterance to the sentiments
above expressed. The consequence, would have been—what Heaven
only knows, as the Speaker said. That MR. LUTFULLAH would have
caught it in the shape of a good scolding is at least certain, , and
erhaps, in j.". would have had his ears boxed, and then have
een tossed in a blanket.

COUNTS AND CRACKJAWS.
A CoNTEMPORARy’s own correspondent in Hungary, in
reporting the progress of the EMPEROR QF AUSTRIA in
that country, to prove that his Imperial º is not
likely to be received, as his enemies anticipate, with silence
and inattention by the Magyar nobles, gives a list of
certain of those magnates who repaired to Oédenburg to
form a guard of honour for him: and observes:-
“There is some eloquence in this catalogue of proper names:–
PRINCE EstERHAzY, Count Czir Aky, Count Joseph SoMoggi, the four
Counts Szech ENYI, Count Zichy, Count Wizay, Count WALKENSTEIN,
the two Counts PEJAcsevies, Count Niszky, Count BURY, Count
Jonfisch, Count ERDody, Count Csaky, and BARoN DETRINTs.”
The eloquence, such as there is, in this nominal cata-
logue, is §. very simple and extremely rugged character.
It can be pleasing to those only who delight in uncouth
sounds attended with horrible grimaces, for the result of
an attempt to enumerate the above list of names, is a
frightful discord, and involves contortions of countenance
which, to the spectator, present the apparent symptoms of
an epileptic fit.
“PLATO, THOU REASONEST ILL!”
OLp PLATO said, “Wisdom crieth in the streets.”. This
may have been the case with the ancients, but with us
Londoners it is very different. We are sure that wisdom
is about the last cry we hear in the public thoroughfares.
If PLATo had lived in London at the present day, he would
have said, “the Costermonger crieth in the streets,” or if
it had not been the Costermonger, it would have been the
Manchester Weaver, or the Frozen-out Gardener, or the
Professional Beggar, or the canting Psalm-Singer, or the
Last-new-and-popular Ballad-Wendor, or those crocodilish
gentlemen, who, with clean aprons and vitriolic, voices
appeal from the middle of the street to their “ Kind
Christeeans.” Poor Wisdom, if it does cry, it must be at

PUNCH*S LITTLE POLICE COURT.
THE SystEM or ENCOREs.-Six young gentlemen, of stylish ap-
pearance, were charged with the offence of encoring MADAME GAssIER
in one of her songs at the Surrey Gardens.
In their defence, one of the offenders (a gentleman of military ex-
terior, with a round collar, and “peg top trowsers” of a pale straw-
berry colour) hummed and ha'ha'd to the effect, that they knew per-
fectly it was vulga-ar—downright snobbish, he might say—to cry out
“Encaw; ” but the fact is, that in this particula-ar case, flesh and
blood couldn’t stand it any longer. The temptation was more than
they could resist, positively. The fault, so to speak it, was more with
MADAME GA-Assier than with them, for singing the Wa-aria-ations
to the Ca-arnival de Venice so cha-armingly as she did She should be
charged, he ma-a-ainta-ained, with the offence of inciting gentlemen to
bre through the la-aws of good-breeding and jºi society. He
begged most ha-umbly to apa-ologise.
Mr. Punch, with inflexible gravity, said this was a very bad case
indeed—for it was an offence against good manners—a direct violation,
he regretted to say, of one of the fundamental rules of gentlemanly
Etiquette. He was sorry to see gentlemen in their position of society
so far forget themselves. If they had been hair-dressers—or simply
shopboys—he might have made allowances, for their thorough igno-
rance of the commonest decencies of public behaviour. As it was,
their position in society only aggravated their offence, for they must
unquestionably have known better. Now, supposing LoRD PAIMER-
ston was encored in every one of his brilliant witticisms in Parliament
—supposing Wiscount WILLIAMs was called upon to deliver a second
time every one of his eloquent speeches, it was plain—as plain as the
hunch upon his (Mr. Punch's) back—that the business of the nation
could never be carried on 1 As with Parliament, so it should be with
every other place of amusement. Encores were a nuisance—a bore—
a drag-an interruption—and the sooner the system was doubled up,
the better. -
The gentlemen, severally, and individually, promised that, let the

the breach of decorum with which they stood charged, allowed them
to be released from custody. Each gentleman thanked Mr. Punch
for his liberality, and, before leaving, dropped a handsome contribution
into the Poor-Box.
A TREAT FOR OXFORD’S MEMBERS.
THE Pop E of Roxſe, like a kind Papa, is accustomed to make
occasional presents of confectionery to his children, when he considers
that they have been particularly good. Considering the º:
opposition which the two members for Oxford have offered to the
Divorce Bill, we wonder that PAPA PIUs has not yet given º
honourable gentlemen so much as a single, blessed penn'orth of lºlli-
#. between them. The sole ground of their hostility to the measure
as been the Romish dogma of the indissolubility of marriage under
any circumstances; and for the ºf: which they have rendered
their Papa in asserting that doctrine, he might have rewarded them
with a case of Italian sweetstuff, if not with something better in he
way of indulgence. To be sure, Papa has been absent from home
lately on an excursion, but when he comes back he will perhaps req}l-
lect his dutiful children who represent Oxford and himself, and send a
lot of sugar plums to MR.GLADSTONE, with his love, and orders;to
give some of them to SIR WILLIAM HEATHcote.

“Voices of the Night.”
It was 10 o'clock. The stars were shining. HERBERT and PERcival were waſking
arm-in-arm. All of a sudden, sounds of music were heard. They took their cigars
out of their mouths, and listened. There was the drum, and the fife . They st
still. Their hearts beat in unison. A high wall was before them. Soldiers were
hurrying past. Nursery-maids were saying “Good Night!”. Emotion was in their
voices—the big street-door key was hanging round their little fingers. The drums
rubadubbed louder—the fifes shrieked shriller than before—as though to mock
them. “ Doubtless, the military Vespers?” timidly inquired the sagacious HER:
BERt. “Nay,” rejoined the logical PERcival, “much too loud for a Whisper ?”

HIGHLY ACCOMMODATING,
Stout Party (rather hot). “Hope you don't find the breeze too much, Sir "
Fellow Passenger. “Oh! not at all, Sir! I rather like it !”
PEN-AND-INKLE AND YARICO.
THE literary and political world is aware that there is a journal called
the Press, a Conservative organ, more especially dedicated to the
glorification of MR. DISRAELI. It has, until lately, seldom appeared
without calling the attention of a negli ent world to some splendid
feat of patriotism or oratory, alleged to have been performed by that
Right Honourable Gentleman. It is true that the paper has occa-
sionally been snubbed by the Conservative Chiefs, and that LoRD
DERBy thought it necessary to repay much good service to himself
and his party by making, in the House of Lords, an offensive and con-
temptuous Šiši. to the journal. In fact, it was evident that there
were differences in the Conservative camp—DIOMED and THERSITEs
were at variance—EPHRAIM was vexing JUDAH. But it was with great
ain that we perused the following evidence, last week, that the Press
#. gone right round, and was fighting LORD, DERby’s, battle.ore
rotundo. The cleverness and fidelity of the following description,
which we extract verbatim (except as regards compression), cannot be
disputed, but the ingratitude of this kind of treatment of a personage
who has worked for the Tories as hard as MR. DISRAELI has done, is
equally palpable... It is a retrospective sketch or summary of what
might be said at the close of his career:-
“About the value of his writings
and upon the estimate of his character,
opinions (even amongst conservatives) are various and º He was bitter
and boisterous in his galling derision of an adversary; rapid and unceremonious in
attack; if a rejoinder were offered, he always showed a determination to have the
last word. He was more of a pamphleteer than of a public censor, and more of a
debater than an orator. There was a certain malign asperity of mind and fierce
propensity to energetic disparagement of individuals in him, which raised him a
swarm of enemies. He had a vast stock of personal and defamatory gossip, more
or less authentic ; he had a prodigious command of damaging personal allusions;
he had an innate propensity to sarcasm, accompanied with literary finish in forging
his truculent disc rges ; he had fluent lips, a mordant tongue, and a front of brass.
To “put him down” was out of the question; he existed in being attacked; he
liked having a public quarrel on his hands; and he had justifiable confidence in his
unfailing stock of vituperation, and corrosive virulence of reply. He was never a
pular man at any time in his connection. He was too habitually censorious, and
#. did not comport himself with sufficient respect towards his rivals, or his allies.
He, himself, seemed callous to ridicule and reproof. . If he was knocked down in
argument, he got up again with the temperament of an Irishman at a fair, who
thinks that bumps and blows are only compliments to be returned. His state-
ments must, we fear, be accepted with caution, as he was a jaundiced observer, and
the gall-bladder was too active in his atrabilious composition. Although sarcasm
was his favourite weapon, in its employment he was far surpassed by some of his
adversaries; and it would be difficult, even for his best friends, to say in what he
ever was first-rate. Yet, undoubtedly he had a mind of extraordinary activity; he
was quick in acquiring knowledge, tenacious in retaining it; he was polemical by
LAST FOND LOOKS."
WHEN a Lady (we are talking of a Lady in
the full height and breadth of Fashion) has got
her bonnet and gloves on, and is perfectly ready
with her parasol in her hand, she always goes
back to the looking-glass to take a last fond look.
Upon our asking “a dear handsome Duchess,”
if this was not the truth, and the beautiful truth,
she had the charming candour to state: “Yes,
my dear Punch, it is the truth, but not all the
truth. , No, woman, take my word for it, is
satisfied with one look. At least, I know that I
am not, for (and here our Duchess laughed, as
º she was pleased with herself and all the
world) I don't mind telling you, I invariably
s|take four-four good ones. e first look in the
glass is for myself, that’s fair; the second is for
| my husband, that’s º but just; the third
|is for my friends, that’s only generous; and the
inst is for my rivals, that’s, human nature. If
the last look satisfies me, then I know it is all
right, and I assure you I never take any more!”
A Cordon Sanitaire.
It is proposed to buy the unsunk portion of
the Atlantic Rope, and to lay it down to India.
Certainly, next to flºº rope is the article
most wanted in India, but it is rope of the kind
mentioned in the nursery song—that which
instinctively began to “Hang the Butcher.”
ECONOMY IN FEMALE DREss.
A Miser ABLE stingy wretch of a husband
complaining of the expense now rendered
necessary by ladies' extensive dresses, was very

Crinoline is a set-off.
instinct, and controversial by profession; rarely profound in his views, his standard
for measuring right and wrong was purely conventional, but his affectation of aris-
tocratic prejudices, and echoing the fashionable cant of the great and high-born,
was ridiculous and out of place. . He did not at the close of his career enjoy much
of the confidence of many of the leaders of the Conservative connection.”
The conclusion reads to us as anticlimax. At least we should never
make it matter of reproach to MR. DISRAELI that he did not enjoy
gº of the confidence of such persons as DERBY, MALMESBURY, and
POONER.
“Their praise were censure, and their censure praise."
But if we consider this article as the effusion of a Tory journal
against a man who, with all his faults, fought the Conservative battle
with might and main, disputed the ºi inch by inch, did succeed
in damaging many of his weaker antagonists, and never flinched from
the blow of the champions, and who was doing party work almost up
to the day of the publication of the attack, we must say that, we have
seldom seen anything more despicably ungrateful. The Tories are
roverbial for neglecting their best partisans, but an excuse can be
ound for this in the contempt which a thinking man must feel for the
kind of men who can long, and vociferously proclaim the nonsense
called Toryism. . But to neglect a used tool is one thing—to throw it
away, with insult, is another. However, it is well that men who are
disposed to be tools should know how they will be used by Conserva-
tive employers—let them be warned by this treatment of one of the
ablest of the men who ever dragged literature and politics at the
chariot of party.
Halte la / At our elbow growls a Judicious Friend, who says that
we have read the article hastily, and that it does not apply to MR.
DISRAELI, whose “great faculties” are lauded in another column of
the same journal.
That is a relief. That is a comfort. The world is not so ungrateful.
We breathe again. And yet the mistake º well be made, for does
not every word help to frame a doubtless un jºlly, but still lifelike
and photographic image of the Member for Bucks? But our friend is
right. It cannot be. The Press is still DisrAELITE., Most probably
it is graced by an article from the DispariſTE steel pen. But who

that:-
“Wide skirts still continue to be worn, and there is but little apprehension of
their going out: it having been decided that the mode is most becoming."
Now, ladies, pray by whom, do you imagine this decision has been
come to ? Do you think it likely that the leaders of the fashion can
have somewhere met in solemn conclave, and recorded their conviction,
after a fair trial, that the wearing of wide skirts is a “mode most

merely by the milliners: who, however good theirjº. as to what

nose into whatsoever ways of dressing her Costumière directs: and our
opinion is that, as an ample skirt consumes more silk or satin, than a
scanty one, wide dresses keep in vogue, because of the long bills they
infallibly induce.
SIDNEY SMITH has laid it down, that “the female mind does not
reason: ” and we are ungallant enough to share his sentiment, or
perhaps we should rather say, his want of it. We are also well aware
that, as a rule, the female mind has little knowledge of arithmetic:
and that it would be useless to expect it to put two and two together,
without at least considerable practice in the process. We are there-
fore not unwilling, ladies, to assume that your extravagance in dress is
not aforethought malice, but is indulged in without consideration of
the consequences. We dispose .. to take this charitable view,
because we cannot fancy you would go to such lengths, and widths, in
over-dressing, if you reflected on ift. magnitude of the folly of so
doing. Your object in dress, we presume, is to please: and not to
º yourselves so much as male admirers. Now you don’t suppose
oqp petticoats are looked upon with favour by the masculine eye-
sight? You surely can’t imagine there is “metal more attractive º’ to
a man in half a ton of Crinoline than in nature's flesh and blood
unsurrounded by steel armour? If you wish to dissipate such fond
delusion, empanel a jury of , your nearest male relations, whom
gallantry will not deter from giving a true verdict. Or even put the
uestion to your partner in a ball-room, and see if he approves of the
ashion which makes ladies unapproachable. Whether as waltzer or
as husband, a man likes a woman he can take to his arms; and how is
this possible when she is entrenched in an impregnable hoop petticoat,
which when he approaches he breaks his shin against.
You will observe, if you please, ladies, that we don’t mean to say a
syllable about the bad morality—if not the downright vice—there is in
over-dressing. We intend to ãº no pictures of families impoverished
by the richness of wives’ wardrobes, and reduced to narrow means by
their wide furbelows and flounces. We appeal to you simply on the
score of eyesight: and we tell you none but a distempered vision can
see beauty in a person, whereof the natural proportions are distorted
and deformed by a protuberance of petticoat. Instead of vieing with
each other who can dress the most becomingly, you now seem striving
as to who can make the greatest figure of herself: and in the race for
the fashionable championship the favourite is she who is weighted the
most heavily. The style now in vogue is a style as inflated as that of a
third-rate French romancist’s, and ladies who have not a spark of pride
about them, yet are so puffed up that there is literally no iii. hands
with them. They keep even their nearest relations at arm’s distance;
indeed it is a painful fact that many a husband now lives separated
from his wife (by at least three yards of outskirt), and is moreover
haunted by a horrible misgiving lest she be suspected of belonging to
the swell mob. |
Now, ladies, we are not of a malignant disposition; but when we
find it stated that, in spite of all our efforts, there is no abatement in
the Crinoline contagion, we are in self-defence disposed to prescribe a
harsher treatment than we have as yet ever ventured to propose; Were
we an old bachelor, we should not shrink from the suggestion that the
wide skirts be referred to the Inspector of Nuisances, with strict
orders to take summary steps for their removal. When needful to
resort to a surgical operation, we would have the strongest nerved prac-
titioners appointed to the scissorship, and give them full instructions
to cut and come again if requisite. As the mania for hoops is as
infectious as the hooping-cough, we would have the incurable perma:
nently confined : and considering what frights the Crinoline-afflicted
look, we think the proper hospital for their reception would be Guy’s'
But as we have the feelings of a married man to prompt us, we
suggest in our mercy, that to work a certain cure there would be no
need to have recourse to surgery. ...Let Crinºline be made sufficient
ground for a divorce—if not for life, at least durante petticoato-and
see how many wives would then persist in wearing it. ſ would surely
be but justice that the use of large skirts should be confined to large
establishments; for in purse, as well as person, it is found no easy
matter to support a better half of some º yards’ circumference.
We therefore think a husband should be by law protected from the
chance of being swamped by an overwhelming petticoat: and that
when he finds his wife's wide flounces narrowing his income, he should
he entitled to obtain a divorce ab immensá—that is, speaking English,
from the immense one.
Punch's Gentlemanly System of Cab Fares.
WE do not like cabmen any more than we like º but we
would treat them with the same mercy that is usually shown to
culprits. In paying a fare, if you have the smallest doubt, let
the cabman have, as a culprit generally has, the full benefit of the
doubt, and pay him accordingly. Better overpay nine hundred and
ninety-nine unjust cabmen than underpay one just one. A curiosity
can rarely be seen under a shilling, and surely the rarity of a JUst
CABMAN (when you see one) well deserves an extra sixpence?
Hymen Out of Town.
Might we be allowed to call the benevolent attention of the aris-
tocracy to the hard lines, if we may be pardoned the expression, under
which two humble persons, employed in the service of a church, are
suffering—we cannot say labouring—because their hardship, in fact, is
that of iºn almost nothing to do. Rank and Fashion having gone

A CASE FOR THE WHIP.
A LETTER appeared the other day in the Morning Post,
under the heading of “Dangerous and Ruffianly Boys,”
the writer of which, in describing various brutalities prac-
tised by young street rascals, makes the following state-
ment :-
“At the corner of Mornington Crescent, Hampstead Road, I have
repeatedly seen disgraceful assaults committed upon a blind boy who
sits there to read aloud, from the Bible for the blind, when requested
by the curious or the charitable to do so. A bevy of ill-looking lads,
of from 12 to 18, jostled this blind boy the other day, ran off with his
cap, injured his Bible, and knocked about some coppers which he
was holding in his hand. I succeeded in scaring them away; but on
looking back, as I was getting out of view, I had the mortification to
see that the tormentors were again gathering round their prey.”
We wonder what the Magistrate of the district would
charge for an assault, committed in the form of a good
hiding, on the person of one of the young blackguards
who amuse themselves by maltreating the blind boy at
the corner of Mornington Crescent. The very smallest
fine, we should think, that he could possibly inflict, sup-
posing the assault to have been provoked by the outrage
committed on the blind boy. any gentleman could be
assured on that point, he might possibly feel disposed to
take a walk in the direction of Hampstead, armed with a
dog-whip, and accompanied by a friend or two similarly
provided. Should he catch any young scamp at the corner
of Mornington, Crescent, ºf the blind boy, he might
seize him by the collar, and, if sufficiently strong, hold
him. º with one hand and whip him as hard as possible
with the other for some time. His companions might follow
his example, if they found, several young, blackguards
engaged in the diversion of ill-using the blind boy, and
we cannot imagine a more pleasing chorus than that which
the simultaneously whipped cowards would perform by
howling in concert under the lash.
“A Cruel Parient.”

vain. The father's hair has since turned completely grey.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
oNDAY, August 24. The un-
seemly conduct of the
Speaker, who in his exul-
tation at the close of his
first, Session, kicked his
costly wig into the air,
reminds Mr. Punch that
MR. SPEAKER DENISON
has as yet scarcely come
up to Speakership mark.
He has been too easy. He
mit any one to presume to
answer him, or to contro-
vert his judgment. He has
not been quite sufficiently
mindful of the fact, that in
the first assembly in the

Fº
he, DENIson, is the First
the recess he will acquire a
little more sternness, and
we should advise him to
have all his Ossington male
domestics into the stable:
yard, every morning, and
row them savagely (making compensation in their wages), until, he
-
take some mastership of hounds for a season, and he will soon, learn the
art of putting down objectionable people. With these remarks, all for
his good, we forgive him for kicking his wig, and we wish him a
pleasant holiday. -
Parliamentary proceedings during the last week of a Session are
usually mere formalities, occasionally enlivened by a bit of temper Qn
the part of people who are angry at being detained in town. On
Monday, in the Lords, the highly ridiculous conduct of LoRD REDES;
DALE on the previous Friday was brought up again. He had attempted
to overthrow the Divorce Bill by a sudden and irregular trick, for
which he had been soundly castigated by LORD IANSDOWNE, aprºpos
of whose name, we hear (and are glad to hear, if the circumstance
affords satisfaction to one whom everybody honours). that the
venerable Marquis is to be made DURE of KERRY. It is only an
act of common justice to LoRD CRAN worth, of whom we have not
often been able to speak in eulogistic terms, that on occasion of
Redesdale's trick, he put himself into the most furious and boiling
rage in which an infuriated Chancellor ever seethed. 0 si sic omnia/
REDEsdale was obliged to abstain from hostility that night, and this
evening he had to make the best of his behaviour, and interrupted
business for a long time with his explanations. The Commons’
Amendments to the Divorce Bill were then brought forward, and
REDESDALE moved their rejection. He was defeated. They were
discussed, and all were agreed to, except two, one of which was the
introduction of words giving the Quarter Sessions a jurisdiction in
divorce cases. The Lords, who live a good deal among country gen:
tleman, and know their logical habits, want of prejudice, and general
fitness for the judicial office, quietly expunged this passage, winking
gravely at one another. The story may as well be finished at once.
Next day the Government suggested to the Commons not to stick out
for these two amendments, and they did not. This, the same evening
was signified to the Lords, and the Divorce discussion closed. And
now that the bill is complete, Mr. Punch, in fulfilment of his pledge to
that effect, presents, in another column, a masterly explanation of the
law of the land in regard to Divorce.
LoRD PALMERStoN said that the remnant of the Atlantic Cable was
not the property of Government, and he could not think of asking for
money to buy it, and lay it down to India. A plan, however, for car-
ox may like to know that this latter place is in India—in Scinde in
fact, near the mouths of the Indus) has been laid before the public,
and had it been carried out a few months ago, half the misery which
has occurred might have been prevented.
Tuesday. LoRD PANMURE presented the Report on Promotion in
the Army, and begged that it might receive only half the attention it
deserves, because it was signed by only half the &. appointed
to draw it up. We should regret to notice inconsistency in Lord
PANMURE, sº were therefore glad to see him nobly and firmly adhering
to his practice of always doing things by halves.
KEATING said that BETHEL had not made up his mind whether he
should or should not pitch into GLovER, lately expelled from Beverley.
For some inconceivable reason, the Queen has been advised to make

should he be made a Peer? We suspect that it is all the weather's

agree with HER MAJESTY. hen a Comet has been absorbed into the

McMAHON complained that the fathers of unlawful Irish babies could
not be compelled to maintain them; LoRD PALMERSTON mentioned that
Government would help the Kurrachee Railway Company so far as it
could be done without aid from Parliament; M.R. MANGLEs said that
the East India Company had sent out orders to give ample assistance
to all persons reduced to destitution by the rebellion: and SIR DE
LACY º began a speech on the Purchase of Commissions, when
there was a cry of “Here’s the Rod.”
The Commons having arrived in the House of Lords, a piece of
remarkable legerdemain was performed. A heap of parchment lay on
a table before a long clerk. He made a bow, and said La Reine le
/eut. At the self-same moment a large part of the Ecclesiastical
Court came down with a crash, and disclosed a beautiful new Court
of MARRIAGE AND DIvorce, and blazing in Hymeneal saffron-
coloured letters the words, QUIs SEPARABIT.
The applause having ceased, LORD CRAN worth read a speech to the
following effect:—
“My Lords and Gentlemen,
“The QUEEN says, she is much obliged to you, and you may go.
“Europe seems as likely to keep the peace as not, and we hope that
some of these days the Danubian questions will be settled.
“The Bengalese have broken into rebellion, and barbarities have
been committed. Please Providence, the ‘powerful means at the
QUEEN’s disposal” will enable her to give a good account of the
miscreants. “No Mºsuº cºicinated to qugii. These misorders
SHALL BE OMITTED.’
“Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
“Thanks for Supplies and Promises.
“Glad you redeemed the Sound Dues without adding to the debt.
“My Lords and Gentlemen,
“Very much obliged indeed for your kindness to dear VICTORIA
ADELAIDE MARY Louis A.
“You have really done a good deal in a short Session.
“The Wills Act was much wanted.
“The Divorce Act was particularly desired.
“The Fraudulent Trustees Act was earnestly asked.
“The Transportation Act was loudly called for.
: The Joint Stock Banks Acts was peremptorily demanded.
“The Irish Bankruptcy Act was terribly needed.
“The Scotch Lunatics Act was clamorously required.
... The Scotch Police Act was literally bellowed for. .
“And all the other Acts which you have passed were just the things
necessary to save the Country until February.
4. Hope you’ll find the birds plentiful, and just wild enough for good
sport.
“Heaven bless you !”
LoRD CRAN worth then declared. Parliament prorogued until
November. He had mentioned the Fifth, but overhearing a young
lady who was looking at him say, “There’s a Guy,” he laughed and
looked down to his paper, and so found that, as usual, he had made a
mistake. So he amended his declaration and fixed the day for Friday,
November the Sixth, when Parliament will not meet. And now
universal space is left to the Dictator to use as he will—to—
“Hang all the sky with his prodigious signs, *
Fill Earth with monsters, drop the Scorpion down
Out of the Zodiac, or the fiercer Lion; t
Shake off the loosened globe from her long hinge, v
Roll all the world in darkness, and let loose w
The enraged winds to tear up groves and towns.” w
No, MR. BEN JONson; no. PALMERston is doubtless eager to do
all this and more, for the Russian Papers, and the American Papers,
and the Penny Papers avouch it, but—rigilans in aede—is, as ever,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
MR. PUNCH UPON PURCHASE.
mº-ºº: H.R.H., F.M. PUNCH, never
| ºn- º ſº
||||||W)
|
º º,
| | º |
however disagreeable, has
read through the Blue
Book of the Commissioners
charged to report on Pur-
chase in the Army. He
| is done more, he has
| digested it.
F.M. Punch need scarcely
say, that purchase-except
of his own periodical—is
abhorrent to his mature—
that he detests à priori, a
posteriori, a fortiori, and
er abundanti, a system by
which a fool, with the re-
quisite sum lodged at his
agents, vaults over the head
of an embryo WELLINGTON,
who does not happen to
have the price of a step in
his pocket. F.M. Punch is
glad to learn from the re-
port, that the practice of
purchase began in the reign
of CHARLEs THE SEcond.
The system savours of its
origin. When the King himself was bought and sold, no wonder commissions
in the army were made matters of traffic. - - -
But there the system is. Nobody approves of it in principle; but it will cost
£7,000,000 to get rid of it. And nineteen holders of commissions out of twenty
º: and non-purchasers alike—are dead against any change. If we get
rid of purchase, it must be either for seniority or selection. But seniority will
give us captains as grey and gouty as our generals used to be, till the warrant of
1854 set seniority aside in that †. And selection means, as things go, not the
“right man in the right place,” but that general predominance of Downs, of which
a strong illustration is afforded by a JAMIE SIMPson, in the chief command,
with a Colin CAMPBELL at the head of a division under him.
If you promote by seniority, officers will club among themselves to buy out an
old boy, who dams the current of promotion—as they do in India. If you promote
| § selection, either Dow B will be taken care of, and everybody else neglected; or
the Minister, in his anxiety to show that he is not taking care of Dow B, will fall
| back in practice on seniority, and appoint the oldest, because nobody will give him
credit for appointing the worthiest.
The system of Army Promotion is in fact—as F.M. Punch's common sense tells
him—a choice of difficulties. Now, when John BULL has a choice of difficulties
| before him, his way is rather to make the best of any accomplished fact he can lay
hold of, than to rush into the manufacture of new facts. . He wisely prefers
cobbling his old shoes, to flinging them away, on the strength of the first adver-
| tiser, who promises him first rate stuff and a splendid fit, for next to nothing.
| After all, John BULL's concern is less about the price paid, than the article pur-
| chased. What the Army is depends upon what officers are, not upon how they get
their commissions.
What is a Commission?
shrinking from any duty, ſh
| A licence to live in barracks, with the liberty of a latch-key, the luxury of a
mess, the free and easiness of a barrack-room, constant idle companions in quarters,
the run of the best society in the neighbourhood out of quarters, the prestige of
a uniform, and the facility of unlimited tick. All this, remember, at an age when
most lads are still at school, under the check of bolts, bars, and bounds, with .
diet of legs of mutton and stick-jaw, the work of the school-room, the tyranny of
the sixth form, the surveillance of the dormitory, and a weekly allowance of
pocket-money. Per contra, it means drill to learn, parades to attend, guards to
mount, court martials to sit upon, and inspections to go through. But the drill-
! sergeant is so good-tempered! The adjutant and commanding officer are such
i bricks—such uncommonly pleasant fellows—and as for inspections, the general of
the district is a trump and a jolly old cock—and prefers making things pleasant,
| and spending a cosy evening at the mess to wigging and reporting fellows, and
making a row. Then there's the variety and excitement of travel and change of
quarters. In short, a Commission now-a-days—we speak of a time of peace—is the
; to one of the pleasantest and idlest lives a young fellow can cut out for
imself—if he has three hundred a-year above his pay. No wonder the article
fetches more than regulation price. It is a bad investment if you look at the pay-
but think of the pleasure, and where can you get as much for the money. It is
unique, in this decorous and common-place country. - - -
But what might a Commission bef ". has JoHN BULL a right to insist on its
being? The admission—after proof of good sound health, average strength and brains |
—to a hard-working profession, in which, every man,—besides being able to ride
shoot, and speak the truth—should be made to learn the working and details of one
of the most minute and complicated of machines—a regimental company: should,
be compelled to master his duties on parade, and in the barrack-room—in a word,
all of the art of war that can be taught in peace: in which every depôt should be a
school: every commanding officer an instructor and controller, as well as a friend
and companion: every Inspecting General, a rigid examiner
and faithful reporter, as well as a good fellow at the mess-
table. In short, we might make our youngsters, when
they buy a commission, buy discipline, instead of licence:
ard-work, instead of idleness: pride in the studies of their
profession, instead of contempt for them. All this is com-
patible with purchase. But it is incompatible with taking
care of Dow; ; with favouritism at the Horse Guards;
with the privileges of Household Troops, who are exempted
from most of the hardships of service, and absorb an undue
proportion of its rewards; with the paying more attention
to the lacing of a jacket, or the hang of a feather, than to
the lodging of your soldiers, or the quality of their
weapons; with lax Colonels, and easy-going Inspecting
Generals.
These things are facts just as much as purchase: if we
can’t get rid of purchase, let us see how much of the mis-
chief of purchase remains when these things are got rid of.
Suppose Dow B-qug Dowb–no longer cared for; suppose
high commands well bestowed; suppose the privileges, of
the Guards done away with; suppose the wings of that
predominant bird (the *... tailor's goose) clipped—
suppose Colonels taught that they must not fear unpopu-
larity, in the cause of duty, and Inspecting Generals made
to feel that speaking the truth is better for them than
making things pleasant.
Perhaps you will say, suppose the moon made of green
cheese.
But JoHN BULL may insist on these suppositions being
converted into realities. If he can accomplish that, he
may leave purchase to take care of itself.
Can it be denied that these things might continue, if
purchase were abolished to-morrow? Can, it be denied,
that so long as these continue, the article—the Commission
—continues the same? You have only altered the way to
get it. What you want to alter is the thing. If you can’t
find buyers for it when transformed as F.M. Punch would
have it, purchase has come to an end of itself. If you can
find buyers, why, it is worth the money!

IN the City Article of a daily contemporary, the absence
of business in the fund-market is accounted for “by the
very general exodus of the moneyed public from town.”
When we remember by what nation the original exodus
was performed, and consider of what nation also the
moneyed public is largely constituted, we discern a peculiar
significance in the j. of their departure from
Town as an eacodus.

A BAD ACCOUNT OF A GOOD MUSICIAN.
EvKRY friend of M. JULLIEN will regret with us to hear that the
oor MONS. has been again in labour-labouring, that is, under severe
indisposition. In answer to a vote of sympathy which was passed
“with acclamation” at a recent meeting of the Surrey Gardens Com-
pany, M. JULLIEN is reported to have made this touching statement:
“For himself, he had been called to the bosom of his family to rest, but he could
not; he had commenced with this and he would sink with it as the last man of a
ship should do. (Cheers.) . He had many times gone into the orchestra when told
by his doctor that he would die, but he said it would be an honour to die in his
orchestra. (Cheers.)”
Now, we say emphatically [italics please, and capitals] THIS
WON'T DO. We cannot have our MöNs. look forward thus lugu-
briously to the, as he fancies, not far distant playing of his own dead
march. However great the honour of his dying in his orchestra, it
would be but small consolation for his loss. London cannot spare its
JULLIEN at present. How dark would be November without the shine
of his white waistcoat
We are unaware precisely what complaint it is that our poor Mons.
is suffering; but from words he has let fall, we incline to ſ: that he
is not so strong as we could wish him in his pocket. It would appear
that he is much reduced by his connection with the Gardens, which have
proved to him the reverse, it seems, of Edens. We also fear that his
economy, however much we may, and do, commend it, has been carried
to excess. When he tells us that “the cost of himself and family at
home is not £2 a-week,” we almost apprehend that he has tried too
low a diet. We should prescribe him better living, and to try a change
of air, if he finds he can afford it. Being a composer, he must do his
best in trying to compose himself, and not give way to such excitement
! as his words appear to indicate. Perhaps a draught for his last six
months’ salary would, if duly honoured, prove the best composing
draught, and we sincerely hope to hear that this has been made up for
im." Eminent as a conductor, M. JULLIEN is excelled by no one in
the art of conducting himself; and if he has not won success, he has
“done more-deserved it.” Rich as she may be in musical celebrities,
England can't afford to lose her Moss, if she can help it; and there
are few but would be sad to have to join with other mourners in singing
as a dirge their “Farewell to the Mountain.” We have little doubt
ourselves the Maestro's health would soon improve with the improve-
ment of his prospects, and that when in better plight he would be
restored to better spirits. , Wishing him well-both in person, and in
urse—it distresses us to hear him speak so ill as he has done lately of
imself; and at all hazard we beg of him, Never to say Die—even in
his orchestra—however swan-like it might seem to do it.
THE MIDDLESEX PEER.
ABOUT the elevation of Lord Robert GROSVENOR to the House of
Lords, there appears to be but one opinion. Everybody seems to con-
sider that the #. of a peerage has been very well bestowed upon
the noble late member for Middlesex; but some of his lordship's former
constituents would have been better pleased than they are if the noble
lord had been called to the Upper House by a title somewhat
suggestive of his local connection with themselves. EARL OF BRENT-
Ford, DUKE of Acton, Wiscount HAMMERSMITH, are some of the
titles by which it has been suggested that LoRD, Robert GRosy ENQR
should have been created a Peer; and there are those who think that he
might have been gracefully and appropriately styled MARQUIS OF
BRook GREEN; whilst others wish that he had been called LQRD
WoRMwooD Scrubbs. To this last title, however, there is an objection.
Wormwood is suggestive of bitterness, which has never existed
between iono Roºm Grosveson and his constituents, except for a
brief period, when a rather bitter beer question divided the Middlesex
electors from their representative.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE House of commons EARLY CLosing
ASSOCIATION.
| TEMPORARY OFFICE, 85, FLEET STREET.
PROSPECTU.S.
ATTENTION having been directed to the over-worked condition of
our Members of Parliament, and the merciless protraction of their
hours, and weeks, of business, the humane idea has been conceived of
starting an Association, with the object of procuring them an earlier
release. It is considered this may be effected without in any way
impairing the efficiency of Parliament, or causing any diminution in
the annual amount of work transacted by the House. On the con-
trary, indeed there is sufficient reason to believe that the legislative
body has been weakened by confinement, and that by enjoying greater
relaxation it will gain more vigour to discharge its business duties.
In confirmation of this view, a collection of statistics is now in course
of making, by which it will be shown that (with but one or two
exceptions, which may serve to prove the rule) the shorter Sessions
have been far more useful than the longer: and the detention of the
House to a protracted period, has rarely been attended with much
legislative benefit. -
t will therefore be the aim of the proposed Association, to devise
the means of shortening the sittings of the House without interfering
with the standing orders, or curtailing in the least the freedom of
debate. By the plan they have in view, every Member will be still
allowed to speak as much and as often as he pleases; with this advan-
tage to the mation, that whatever his prolixity, he will not impede the
course of business by so doing. The most Gladstonian of orators will
be suffered unrestrained expression of his sentiments; only instead
of his delivering his speeches “in his place,” he will be provided with
a private room until his spouting fit is over. This, it is considered,
can in no way be regarded in the light of a privation: for if he were to
speak in presence of the Speaker, it is more than probable that he
would either waste his eloquence upon deserted benches, or address
his arguments to those who, even if they listened, would in no one
whit be biassed by them. Moreover, any Member who desires it, will
be supplied with a reporter, so as not to be debarred the privilege of
reading his prolixities in print. Such luxuries, however, like children
in an omnibus, must be personally paid for; and to afford relief to
constant readers of the Newspapers, the insertion of such speeches will
be strictly confined to the advertising columns, and be subject to a duty
of certainly not less than fifty pounds a foot. -
| The Association will discard the Utopian idea that it can ever serve
completely to stop the stream of prosy verbiage which, so long as
Parliament exists,
“Labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis Hansard.”
But although it would be futile to endeavour to dam up this
Niagara of talk, the means above proposed may at least divert the
House
current; and , by providing, proper outlets, save the from
being swamped by the nightly flood of eloquence which hitherto has
overwhelmed it. Members known as fluent, speakers will be placed
throughout the Session under strict surveillance, and their flow of
words will be confined to private channels, so as not, to run athwart
the course of public business. Thus, instead of the few measures
which now yearly escape drowning, there will be in future plenty of
survivors, and abundant crops of legislation will be annually housed,
without such floods of speech delaying them as heretofore while they
| are being carried.
Regarding it merely as a humane institution, there is little doubt
that the Association will command a fair support. But when it is
considered what a saving it will cause to the national Exchequer—for
it is assumed that “time is money” as well in Parliament as out of it
—of course . economist, political or not, will recognise at once a
strong additional incentive for promoting its success. In the event,
however, of its becoming ever needful to appeal to the public, there is
little question that the call will meet with a most liberal response;
and fêtes may be given at the Crystal Palace, after the manner of those
which, in aid of other Early Closing Funds have been lately held there.
#. consenting once a-year or so to play at politics at Sydenham,
Members may rely upon obtaining a good audience; and the “Sports
and Pastimes of St. Stephens,” if properly placarded, will be pretty
sure to prove attractive to the public. The announcement of a
Wrangling Match will doubtless draw as largely as a Jingling ditto;
and instead of the amusement caused by Jumping in Sacks, a hearty
laugh may be got up at the way some speakers have, of jumping to
conclusions. The sport of Drawing the Long Bow may also be
announced, in which the Leadenhall Street champions will distance
most competitors; while doubtless crowds will flock to see an Irish
Members' Row, or such, sparring as the late set-to between the
gladiator GLADSTONE and the bruiser BETHEL. As regards, the
musical arrangements, there will be no need to have professional
assistance. ...The anti-Palmerstonians have not yet left off singing
small, and MR. DISRAELI, as well as SIR CHARLEs NAPIER still ce,
up their practice in the blowing their own trumpets.
The success of the Association being placed beyond a doubt, there
can be no question of its proving of advantage. }. shutting up those
gifted with the gab who now obstruct the ublic business, the House
may put its shutters up much earlier than formerly: and by attending
to the maxim “Acts, not Words,” it will get through its work inless
than half the time now wasted on it. Domestic Members thus, instead
of º choking with their hasty chop in BELLAMy's, may leisurely
enjoy their wives three courses and dessert, and spend their evenings,
as they should do, in the bosom of their families; while the sporting
ones in future need be under no anxiety, lest they be forced to spen
the twelfth of August in Committee, and be on their legs in §.
minster when their hearts are in the Highlands.
To those who know the benefits induced by early rising, it need not be
explained how much the House will be advantaged by it. If the Associ-
ation prosper, early hours will be secured; and there will be an end to
those complaints of working over-time which weakly Members have of
late been almost daily breathing. Their health will be no more im.
paired by their too sedentary habits, and thus their lives may be
prolonged by shortening their sittings.
2–-
CONSIDERATION FOR DOCTORS COMMONS.
THE sum of £100,000 a year is to be divided among the proctors, by
way of compensation for the business of which they will §. deprived
by the Probates and Letters of Administration Bill. This information
will perhaps occasion some imaginative foreigners to conceive a great
idea of the usefulness of ". and of the benefits which they have
conferred upon the British public. Finding that the parties to whom
compensation is awarded deserve it about as much as spiders do when
walls are whitewashed, or as rats when sewers are flushed or repaired,
or when a granary upon stone pillars is substituted for a barn, what an
immense notion the foreigners of imagination must form of English
generosity | What enormous superannuation allowances they must
suppose granted to clerks worn out in public service; to officers and
men disabled in fighting their country's battles, and to their widows
and orphans ! If those English make such ample provision for eccle-
siastical lawyers thrown out of practice, no doubt their charity is ver
open-handed towards frozen-out gardeners. If they subsidise their
proctors at so enormous a rate, at what incalculable sums they must
; their poets! Such must be the reflections of imaginative
oreigners, if they are endowed with logic as well as imagination
and know not with how little reason and common sense the affairs o
the British nation are conducted.
The Order of Release.
“WHAT a shame that so many millions should be spent every year
upon those NAPOLEoN fetes/’” “Yes—but then you must take into
consideration the number of persons that are pardoned on those occa:
sions. At the last NAPOLEóN fete no less than 1,142 prisoners and
exiles received their pardons !” “Ah! I see, you would have me
consider the extravagance as a pardonable offence l’”

Rotonde, in the Palais Royal.

“ALLow me,” said ARTHUR, looking pleadingly at ANGELICA, the
other morning at, breakfast; “allow me to send, you a little duck.
Unless,” he timidly added in a half whisper, “that is like sending

saying, which I have heard my grandmother
repeat—“That nobody snuffeth the savour of
his own shop.” To the proof whereof you have
just now spoken. For not so many farmers do
so overdress their lands as to distribute thereon
even a small part of the sewage of our cities
and towns. is, therefore, being, by the new
Health of Towns Act, required to be got rid of
and removed out of the way, there is nothing
else for it than to discharge the greater por-
tion thereof into the rivers, which is accordingly
one; whence all our streams are now polluted

proverb I spoke of, your own nose should, in
angling, be in as great indignation as you sup-
pose mine is, whenever I ride over a newly-

Pisc. Sir, I confess there is reason in what

drainage of our towns were spread upon our
fields, to the end that it might increase the bread,
instead of being cast into streams and rivers to
poison the drink of Christians, besides injuring
all the fish, except the stickle-backs, which are
of no use, and the eels, which albeit they live and
thrive in foul waters, are yet by far more choice
and delicate when they §: bred in fresh clear

POKING UP THE SEA-COLE FIRE.
IN accordance with the announcement in the Times' City Article,
“some persons,” among whom was Mr. Punch, “waited, upon LORD
PALMERston, upon the *::: of MRs. SEACOLE's claim on the
Surrey Gardens Company;” introduced, the party found immediate
access to his lordship, who received them with much affability. The
following conversation took place.
Lord }. Well, Mr. Punch, how are you? Wery glad to see you.
I’ve just come from the Palace with the Speech. Would you just
glance over it, and see whether it reads all º t. -
Mr. Punch. Not if I know it, you artful dodge...So you’d like to
commit me to approval of it, would you? You’d like to be able to
say to HERM that Punch has revised it, eh? No, Siree.
f Lord P. (laughing). There’s no having you. Well, what can I do
or WOu ;
}. Punch. It will be in the recollection of your lordship that a
series of fêtes were recently º at the Surrey Gardens in honour
of MothER SEAcole, and for her benefit.
Lord P. I know. Very brilliant, very successful, weren't they?
Didn't LoRD ROKEBy take the old # to her stall, and didn’t lots of
Crimeans go. I heard it was a great hit. -
Mr. Punch. It was so, my lord, and a large sum of money was
obtained. - - -
Lord P. Very glad of it. Most deserving old soul, and it will help
to keep her deserving old body in comfort, She was a treasure to the
army, and I wish there were more old women like her, and fewer like
PANMURE.
Mr. Punch. Then, my dear lord, you will regret to hear, that the
poor old lady has never been able to obtain a farthing of the money.
Lord P. By Jove! O, but I say, that’s an infamous shame. She
º: |. have had the money weeks and weeks ago. It’s a case for
the police.
Mr. Punch. It may be hereafter, my lord. But we think that you
could help us to get justice for MRs. SEACOLE.
Lord P. Anything I can do—by the way, the Gardens are gone to
the deuce, I believe? -
Mr. Punch. My lord, the Gardens were in the hands of a Company
which, a little more than a year ago, sacked £32,560, all of which is
lost, and £26,000 of additional debts have been contracted. Yet a
£10 percent. dividend was declared in October, apparently in order
to delude the public into taking up at 744 unissued shares.
Lord P. What a splendid figure-head you have -
Mr. Punch (modestly). The ladies have been pleased to say so, in
É time. Well, my lord, M. JULLIEN, the Mons, and a most worthy
fellow, at whose little eccentricities I have made good fun in his days
of glory, but whom I have always recognised as a true artist, and a
true friend to art, -he had the superintendence of their music, and he
declares that he has been defrauded and ruined. He says that they
owe him £6000, and that he never got anything for it but a bill and
a cheque, both of which were dishonoured.
Lord P. But where’s the money gone?
Mr. Punch. That, my dear lord, MR. CoMMIssionER FANE, aided by
the very clever MR.LINKLATER, and others, proposes to endeavour to
ascertain in the Bankruptcy Court.
Lord P. By George, in the old days Seacole Lane was too near
St. Sepulchre's to be exactly a pleasant name to a bankrupt who
couldn’t give a good account of himself. However, I hope M. JULLIEN
will get something out of the fire.
. Mr. Punch. So do we. But at present we only come in the SEAcoLE
interest. -
Lord P. I fancy it’s the SEACOLE principal you want.
Mr. Punch. Very good, indeed, my lord, and very new, like all jokes
by Members of Parliament. And we want you to put on the screw in
a certain quarter, and then we think we shall get this money.
Lord P. And the quarter P
Mr. Punch whispers to his Lordship.
Lord P. (whispers to Mr. Punch). What! JIMMY }
Mr. Punch nods.
Lord P. But—hang it—he wouldn't collar the tim.
Mr. Punch. I don’t say so for a moment. I believe him to be a very
d fellow. He wouldn't go into Parliament though he returned
alf of it—that’s in his favour.
Lord P. You be blowed |
Mr. Punch. He, personally, is all right, I’ve no doubt, but he has
been a great man in the Company, and, according to JULLIEN, “they
were all like mouses in his presence.” Now, if he were to speak, some
mouse would probably remember in what hole MoTHER SEACQLE's
º has been accidentally laid away, and would very likely fetch
it out.
Lord P. We’ll see. (Writes.) Will that do?
Mr. Punch (reads). “My dear CoPPock,
“See MoTHER SEAcole righted.
“Thursday.” “Always yours, P.”
That will do. I’ll leave it in Cleveland Row as I go by. We are
much obliged to you, and so will the old lady be. We will not trespass
longer upon your valuable time. [The deputation rises.

“MR. Coprock said, that the Secretary had been directed to furnish
MRs. SEAcoLE with every information she desired, and that her claim

THE DIVORCE-BILL DISSECTED.
THE Divorce Bill’s an Act, the Divorce Bill is Law,
Old PAM has established a clerical raw,
Though GLADSTONE protests, and SAM WILBERFORCE groams
That what’s good for a Duke is not good for a JoxEs.
The battle of tangled amendments is past,
The Royal assent is accorded at last;
So, that DARBY and JoAN may be trapped by no fallacies,
Punch begs to offer this little analysis.
The Licence (you’d better have banns) is still bought
Where with greedy-eyed touters your battle is fought:
They state they know single from married men, thus,
He who, seeing them, scowls, hath said “better or wus.”
As regards divorce questions, Punch gladly reports
We’ve abolished the Ecclesiastical Courts:
All complaints matrimonial, for kill or for cure,
Are tried in Lord CUPID-PAM’s new Cour d'Amour.
Its Judge (with £5000 a-year) is a cretur
Whose title's true accent is hostile to metre:
But turn to your Litany—notice whose tongue
May command “other times” when that prayer shall be sung.
Before him may practise a herd of Inquisitors,
Barristers, proctors, attorneys, solicitors.
He takes Separations, and small things of course,
But a Full Court (three judges) must sit for Divorce.
Now DARBy, perpend. Should your JoAN go astray,+
Well, you’re right to look fierce—but some other JoAN may.
Her DARBY petitions this Judge (or my Lord
Of Assize) to estrange her from bed and from board.
And if DARBY goes wrong, or he wops his poor JoAN,
Or for more than two years from her household has flown,
The law has decreed, in its wisdom, to fence her
With the same Release-Order, a thoro et mensö.
And while she’s deserted, if DARBY (the beast)
Interferes with her poor little goods in the least,
She may go to a Beak, whose proceedings are quick,
And Policeman Z1 will administer Stick.
There ends, we must say, JoAN, as far as we see,
Any special relief that’s allowed to the She,
For the Men make the law, and so please to observe
How it stands if you, Madam, from duty should swerve.
He may get a Divorce—that’s a grave, solemn thing,
Annulling the marriage and melting the ring :
And though actions like those which disgrace us are barred,
He may claim from Loth ARIo what juries award.
But you have no right for Divorce, JoAN, to stir,
(Save in cases so shocking they rarely occur),
Except he’s so base as from virtue to draw
One he must not espouse—say, a sister-in-law :
Or unless he’s been dreadfully cruel, so bad
That, (without other i. a divorce should be had:
Or unless in your note of his conduct appears
“Inexcusable absence for more than two years.”
[What the law calls “excuse” must remain to be seen,
t may be much Nagging, or much Crinoline,
Or a constant Piano, a Parrot's vile shriek,
Or Your Mother his guest more than three times a-week.]
That’s the pith of the bill, but it likewise provides
That no parson need marry divorced men, or brides
Where the party divorced was the sinner—but, still,
Any church must be free to a parson who will.

\
Let Lotha Rio take note, ere with glances and smirk
#e addresses himself to his dastar ly work,
That he’s not º fined for the wrong he has done,
But is mulct in all costs—most infrequently fun.
So much for the Act—the mere naming its name
In one home of ten thousand, in England, were shame,
But while Masculine’s vicious and Feminine’s weak,
What help for the wronged but appeal to the Beak?
On *. it affirms let us chiefly lay stress,
That Wrong, and not Gold, gives the right to redress;
And that HELEN, the Countess, no longer can buy
What to NELLY, the Laundress, tribunals deny.
Take heed whom i. marry—when married, take heed
That affection’s the cue for each word and each deed,
And you'll care just as much for this Act and its cases,
As Punch and his Judy—whom now he embraces.
[Suits the action to the word—gives her a cheque for her milliner,
mentions that he has engaged her a house at the sea-side—add
that he icill take her and her dear Mother to Richmond to dinner
to-day—puts a new bracelet on her white arm—salutes her—and
erit dancing, and deriding all the Divorce Bills in the world.
AN EVENTFUL SESSION.
WE, think the Session of 1857 ought to be long remembered. It
should for ages be treasured up in the recollection of every “Oldest
Inhabitant” as a “Sessio Mirabilis.” It can boast of one remarkable
circumstance, which, probably, never can, never will occur again.
That circumstance, more than any other, redounds to the credit of the
Legislature. It only proves what our legislators can do when they
are determined to do it ! . The great event, to which we are alluding,
took place on Tuesday afternoon, August, the 25th. It occurred at
five o’clock, precisely. Let the reader read for himself:-
“At the end of five minutes' sitting, the House adjourned—"
There, the great merit of the past Session is wrapt up in those
“Five Minutes.” . Depend upon it, it will be known hereafter, to the
lover of Hansard, as “the Memorable Sitting of Five Minutes.”
Were such Minutes ever entered in the Minute-book of the House
before? A still more remarkable thing is, that the Divorce Bill was
passed in those same Five Minutes. measure, that had exhausted
every one's patience, and every one's eloquence--a measure, that had
consumed more time even than the Maynooth Grant and the Jewish
Disabilities put together—a measure, that had given rise, to more
angry words than were ever exchanged between the most ill-assorted
couple—a measure, that, beyond all measure, was the longest in being
carried, backwards and forwards, from one House to the other, to be
quietly passed in a sitting that occupied less time than a lady takes to
put on her bonnet! It is incredible—but still it is true! -
It is needless to state that MR. GLADSTQNE did not speak during
those Five Minutes. The reason of his silence is very simple. The
sitting took place in the House of Lords!
CURIOUs TASTE.-A Tradesman advertises for a General Servant,
and says, towards the end, “A Dissenter preferred.” There are
persons in this world who have strange preferences !

MUCH anxiety is expressed in many quarters to know, what the
Bishop of Oxford will do, now that the Divorce Bill has become the
law of the land. What he said he would do is thus reported in the
Times:—
“They would observe that the clause did not affect the Bishop; and he avowed
before their lordships, that if he knew of one of these hired interlopers coming in
the way he was here permitted to do to enter a church, he would meet him at the
door with an inhibition, and suspend him from his office.”
If the bishop is as good as his word, the public will have a fair
chance of bein iñºf with a good old mediaeval row in front of some
church in the diocess of Oxford. The bishop and his retainers will
plant themselves before the church-door, prepared to resist the entrance
of the “interloper” coming to perform, a marriage-service which the
incumbent has declined to celebrate. The prelate will be armed, if not
with his pastoral staff, with a common walkingstick, and the attendant
officers will, carry similar weapons; except the beadle, who, we may
suppose, will shoulder a mace. Prepared for opposition, the weddin
party will perhaps have secured the services of a body of police; an
the consequence will be, a collision between the constabulary staff and
the crosier. Of course, the secular power will soon triumph, and the
vanquished prelate and his discomfited vassals will be walked off to the
nearest Magistrate's. If the justice happens to be a Low Churchman,
or if his principles are opposed to spiritual tyranny, he may think
himself called upon to deal summarily with the case, and, as a fine
would be, no punishment to the receiver of an episcopal income, to
commit the right reverend SAMUEL and his myrmidons to gaol, for
assaulting the police, and obstructing them in the execution of their
uty.
But, though Brag is a good dog, his bark is a good deal worse than
his bite, and we do not much expect that the right reverend SAMUEL will
verify, on any church-threshold, the warning, “Care Canem,” which
he has addressed to anticipated interlopers. We shall be very
much astonished if he even, resigns his bishopric, and refuses to
preside any longer over a see in which he will be unable to prevent.
the performance of marriages which he has declared to be contrary
to Christianity. “John OLDCASTLE died a martyr; but this,” like
FAISTAFF-if we may be excused for comparing SAMUEL to the fat
Knight—“is not the man.” At least if he is, SAMUEL is not the man
we take him for.

NEWSPAPER CUTTINGS.
SESSION and season being over, the London Correspondents of the
Provincial Press have, of course, left town for their estates, their
yachts, or Foreign Courts; consequently the journals are “hard
up” for those wonderful and instructive scraps with which a sub-
editor, by plundering the “London Letter” of a contemporary,
lightens and garnishes a column of heavy matter of his own. Mr.
Punch, in the most kindly and generous manner, hastens to the assist-
ance of his collaborateurs, and subjoins a quantity of “little bits,” war-
ranted new and authentic, which they may snip off and stick in when-

FIVE WoRDs To THE WITTY.-Never joke with stupid
people.

HER MAJESTY's Wit.—It is said that during his absence on the Rhine, H.R.H.
is under engagement to keep a diary of his adventures, and to transmit it to his
Royal parents once a fortnight. The usual packet containing it was brought in to
the QUEEN the other morning by PRINCEss_ALICE, who exclaimed, “Mamma, here's
| Edward's Dairy.” “Better take it to Papa's model farm, my dear,” was the
| Queen's prompt and laughing reply.
ANECDote of C. BARRY.-“With whom, Sir CHARLEs, after all, does the sin of
the delay in finishing the Houses rest?” asked Wiscount Williams, meeting the
great architect in Palace Yard. “I don't know about the sin,” replied SIR CHARLEs,
“but,” he added, pointing up to the glittering Clock Tower, “there's the gilt.”
The noble Wiscount has been occupied ever since in trying to understand what was
meant, but had not succeeded when our Reporter came away.
YANKEE Spite.—A variety of American drinks are now to be procured at a city
tavern. Among them are liquids having the euphonious titles of Gum-ticklers,
Neck-twisters, Kangaroo, Brandysmashes, and so on. The Anti-English party
in America avail themselves of these inventions to give utterance to their desire of
wopping England. They say to one another, “Let’s lick her.”
CHANGE of NAME.-We understand that Miss MADELINE SMITH has changed her
name to MADELINE WERNoN, partly in imitation of her namesake, MB. VERNoN
SMITH (who has dropped the SMITH in his family), and partly for fear she should be
supposed connected with a gentleman who has made such a mull with India.
WONDERFUL HAUL.
FRANK went out fishing one day last week in the neighbourhood

This is what our friend FRANK caught during ten hours' untiring
application:—

1 Old Boot (sans sole),
7 Tadpoles,

UNDER which KING, BEzoNIAN ?—As it is nearly one hundred years since
GEORGE THE THIRD came to the throne of these realms, few persons now alive have
lived under more than four sovereigns, viz.:-the above venerable monarch, his
son GeoRGE: THE Fourth, well known for his extravagance and obesity; WILLIAM,
the Sailor King, and Her present GRAcious MAJEsry, now on a visit to the northern
part of this island. MR. WILLIAM GowmeRy, of Enfield, is an exception to this
rule, having, unconsciously, lived under six English sovereigns. Thrust into the
roof of his house, between the wood and the tiles, was discovered on Tuesday last,
what had probably been placed there for concealment, and forgotten, namely, a
purse containing the above amount.
LoRD MACAULAY. —This nobleman, elevated to the peerage on account of his
literary merits, is the only peer of the realm whose father's name began with the
last letter of the Alphabet, we need hardly mention the letter Z. LoRD MAcAu-
LAY's father's name was ZAchARY.
You MAY well. SAY THAT.—The Recess is always selected as the period for
repairing London houses, for this reason. The occupants of such houses being
usually out of town at that time, they are not exposed to the inconvenience which
they would otherwise undergo from the presence of workmen. Mr. Cox, of
Finsbury, walking, the other day, along a street in which several houses were
fronted with scaffolding, exclaimed, “I wonder when London will be finished 1"
ADVANTAGE of Punctuation.—Punctuation, that is the putting the stops in the
right places, cannot be too sedulously studied. We lately read, in a country paper,
the following startling account of Lord PALMERStoN's appearance in the House of
Commons. “LoRD PALMERston then entered on his head, a white hat upon his
feet, large but well polished boots on his brow, a dark cloud in his hand, his faithful
walking-stick in his eye, a menacing glare saying nothing. He sat down.”

THE SPEECH OF MATERFAMILIAS,
AT THE END OF THE SEASON.
S the Season is over, MATER-
FAMILiss assembled her beau.
tiful daughters in the Drawing-
room, in order to address them,
revious to their going to the
ea-side.
Five young ladies, of various
ages and different styles of
beauty, responded to the mater-
nal call. Their dresses were
limp and faded, and looked
care-worn, as though the vast
amount of work they had gone
through, for months past, had
been too much for them. Like
their exhausted wearers, they
scarcely had a bit of colour left.
In answer to inquiries,
“Where JULIA was P’’ the
Lady's-Maid-in-Waiting stated
that “her *; Missus was
not dressed yet, for as she had
a sick headache, she had had
i. breakfast that morning in

The Boys having been sum-
moned from the stable, MATER-
FAMILIAs, taking her seat upon
the large yellow damask otto-
man, (which had had its brown-holland envelope pulled off for the occasion), proceeded,
lºsing her head-dress, and giving a slight impressive cough, to address family
as tollows :-
“My dear Boys and Girls,
“I need not tell you the Season is over. You all of you want change of air. It is not only
my opinion, but the opinion, also, of that worthy man and physician, DR. KNIGHTBELL. It
is my duty, therefore, as your Mother, to see that you have it.
“The struggle with your poor father has been a long and a
weeks he would not listen to the urgency of my entreaties.
The expense, he declared, would drive him to the workhouse. At last, my tears have pre-
vailed." He has consented to grant you each a six weeks’ absence.
“It is almost superfluous for me to state, that no efforts shall be left undone, on my part,
to gº those six weeks extended to eight.
“It is with profound regret that I cannot congratulate you, as I should wish, on the
success of the past Season. The matrimonial negociations, however, which have been broken
off by the suspension of the usual festivities, must be renewed, with additional vigour,
next Spring, and prosecuted with amiable firmness, and yet dignified sweetness, until carried
to a favourable termination,--which, to my mind, means St. George's, Hanover Square.
“I cannot disguise from you the exalted pride and soothing pleasure I feel in the signal
triumph I have gained over MRs. GRUNDY, in having succeeded in breaking off the match
between CAPTAIN ALBANY KNIGHTSBRIDGE and her youngest daughter.
“We must be fully prepared to act on the defensive against any retaliations that may
be taken against us from that hostile quarter.
“In the meantime, it is my agreeable province to inform you, that the Captain remains
our friend. From a billed-douar, couched in the most courteous of words, which I have just
received from him, I am enabled to state, that he has generously consented to dine ºil, us
next Christmas Day.
“His poor respected father, Loºp BARON DE BOEUF, it pains me deeply to communicate
still lies in a very dangerous condition. The large estates are fortunately entailed, an
our dear friend ALBANY is the next heir in succession. Entertaining the very highest respect
for his honourable parents, and expressing, as we do, our unfeigned regret for his deplor-
able position, still we cannot help hoping that everything may occur for the best.
#º. entered into a fresh treaty with MR. GUNTER. The terms are satisfactorily in
our favour. He has agreed to provide suppers for us next season at One Shilling less per

either of quantity, or ãº The number of plovers' eggs is to be undiminished. The
plate to be provided is to have the same coronet's crest. There are to be prawns, when
in Season.
“It is with no unusual º also, that I announce that there is to be no change in the
Brougham. It will be jobbed next year as usual.
4. ; pride is naturally strengthened by the fact, that stipulations have been expressly
made, that the coachman is to have a new livery. This point been amiably conceded by
the Livery-stable keeper.
“My dear Girls,
“It is my fondest wish through life to see you comfortably settled.
“You must do all you can to º that anxious end.
“It grieves me to see that you have lost your beautiful complexions during the past
season. You must try all you can to regain them amid the healthy breezes of the sea-side.
“Horse-riding will be provided, when necessary,
“Donkey-riding will, also, be allowed to such of you as are not too proud to partake of it.

“Letters of introduction will be forwarded
to you for the wealthy friends and desirable
acquaintances you may chance to meet during
your stay.
“Round hats for each of you have been placed
in your respective bed-rooms. They are of the
largest possible size.
“New bathing-gowns, of an elegant ultra-
marine French pattern, fresh from Dieppe, have
also been placed in your trunks.
“You must be careful not to get wet feet.
“Above all, let me impress upon you strongly
to beware how you flirt with strangers, or
younger sons.
“Your whole future depends upon your dis.
cretion in these little matters.
“I rely on your good sense. I trust princi.

always set you. t

“You must conform to the meal hours they
choose to appoint.
“You must * them in their walks

or the Assembly Rooms, or the Library, by

“I beg of you not to introduce to them any
of your smoking, or billiard friends, excepting
such as, from their high position in life, may
be considered worthy of the favour. A Title, of
course, is always its own introduction.
“Ientreat of you not to add to your sisters'
expenses. The cold meat, which is intended for
the morrow’s breakfast, must not be consumed
over-night for your supper. Such an act of
greediness, not only will reflect on your selfish-
ness, but will materially tend, also, to swell the
weekly bills.
A pint of shrimps each will be allowed you
par jour—not one shrimp more.
“I have terminated a negociation with your
dear father successfully to the effect that, during
your absence, your pocket-money is to be in-
creased. The rate of that increase will be
learnt by yourselves, when you go into the library
to wish your anxious parent “good-bye.” The
smallest favour deserves a grateful recognition.
“To that negociation, there was only one
stipulation laid down:—‘All cigars are to be
paid for out of your own money.’
“It seemed only just to me, that your sisters
have no right to pay for your smoking.
“Before leaving, I hope you have settled all
your bills, tailors' and otherwise. -
“My dear Boys and Girls,
“Go, and enjoy yourselves, with a due regard
to economy.
“Write to your dear Mother, as often as you
can save the postage.
“Heaven bless you!”
Here MATERFAMILIAs rose with affecting
solemnity from the ottoman, and kissed her
children all round.
The ceremony was brought to an abrupt close
by PLUSH BREECHEs appearing at the door,
and announcing gravely that “luncheon was
on the table!”
We must not omit to mention, that the above
speech was delivered in a clear, firm, sound,
musical voice, in which the authority of the
Matron was not less audible than the affection
of the Mother. -
It was listened to attentively by all, excepting
by theyoungest boy (MASTER Još), who amused

five years of age, whom you may meet. She will tell you that Bessy is
the sister of Hilly Iſilkin, Long liester, and two others, and will point
her out to you as the third finger of your hand. Well, somebody has
discovered that when Bessy was made, nature utterly forgot the noblest
use to which the human hand can be applied, namely, the playing on
the pianoforte, and in her negligence, so tied up Bessy with ligaments
and tendons, that she cannot come down on the keys with the aplomb
of her brothers and sisters. And somebody, aforesaid, has contrived a
| thing called the Trito-Dactylo Gymnast, which is to be affixed to Bessy,
and is to enable her to acquit herself better than nature intended. The
profound ingenuity displayed in the title of the invention is as preter-
natural as the thing itself. What Tritons, Dactyls, or Gymnastics

that Mr. ELLA has patriotically undertaken to go through aii

MORE PLUSH AND BUCKLES.
CoNTINENTAL intelligence has for some time consisted of chronicles
of mere flunkeyism. Kissing feet, kissing hands, pirats, triumphal
arches, flags, uniforms, and livery in all its forms, cockades, gold lace,
shoulder-knots, and shoebuckles—these have been the principal facts
and phenomena that our own correspondents have lately been exhibiting
to the British public. . Flunkeyism is generally rampant, but particu.
larly so in Hungary of all places in Europe, where it actually boils up
and over, and runs out into acts of enthusiastic extravagance; such,
for instance, as the exploit thus recorded by our fashionable contem-
porary:—
“A very wealthy gentleman of the department of Neograd, in Bloscowicz, solicited
the favour of the EMPEROR that he might drive him himself, and harness his own
horses in the carriage. . This was granted, and accordingly the Magyar gentleman
mounted the Imperial box, and did the office of ‘whip,” from the station of
Ypolyssag, as far as the town of Balassa-Gyarmath, which he entered amidst the
shouts of delight—not simply amusement—of crowds of the inhabitants.”
This glorious act of coachmanship will doubtless excite emulation;
and sundry H. -
servility evinced in it. Some other Magyar gentleman, glowing with
an flunkeys will try if they cannot exceed the
the fervour of baseness which inspired the gentleman's gentleman-like
gentleman of Neograd, will probably implore the EMPEROR of Austrl.A
to allow him to brush his MAJESTY's clothes, or may supplicate for the
honour of blacking the Imperial boots. For which last-mentioned act
of loyal homage the Sover EIGN will peradventure reward his vassal
with permission to change his ancestral motto for that of “Honour
Bright.”. The method of worshipping the Pope, also, by cleaning his
shoes, might be added to the self-abasement of kissing his feet, above
referred to... In that case, the menial service should always precede
that of the lip, for an obvious reason. The

according to “Things that everybody should know,” being the proper
way to clean white satin slippers, which his HolisEss the PoPE wears

SoLDIER when thou, beneath thy bayonet,
Shalt.get a devilish Sepoy, save the wretch,
Safe if thou canst but make him, for JACK KETCH;
His howls, which none who heard them should forget,
Were lost amid war's uproar; rather let

That show uncertain, then exact our debt,
And there; in full: but be not thou defiled

Who babes and women slew with ſingering palm.

There stop; nor let his guilt thy manhood stain,
But spare the Indian mother and her child.

against that persecuted race. The latter do everything which their
consciences will permit in imitation of the ğ...". in their
marriages we observe they are now copying the fashionable practice of
their oppressors. In the Times one É. i. week, we read (names
only altered):—
“At the residence of the bride's father, by the REveREND Moses AARoN, assisted
by the REveREND SAMUEL Isa Acs, RELBEN Moss, Esq., to REbecca, daughter of
SoLoMon MALAchi, Esq.”
What more can the Hebrews do to prove that they are Englishmen,
than to adopt our ceremonial follies. Surely, after this touching

obdurate.

When steel, red and sated, perforce must retire,
And for every soft hair of each dearly loved head
A cord has dispatched a foul fiend to hell-fire.
The Avengers are marching—fierce eyes in a glow:
Too vengeful for curses are lips locked like those—
But hearts hold two prayers—to come up with the foe,
And to hear the proud blast that gives signal to close.
And woe to the hell-hounds! Right well may they fear
A vengeance—ay, darker than war ever knew,
When Englishmen, charging, exchange the old cheer
For, “REMEMBER THE woMEN AND BABEs whom THEY
SLEW.”
Who slanders our brave ones? What, puling again!
You “fear for the helpless when left as a prey;
“Should the females, the innocent children, be slain,
Or outraged ” Away with your slanders, away !
Our swords come for slaughter: they come in the name
Of Justice: and sternly their work shall be done :
And a world, now indignant, behold with acclaim
That hecatomb, slain in the face of the sun.
And terrified India shall tell to all time
How Englishmen paid her for murder and lust;
- And stained not their fame with one spot of the crime
That brought the rich splendour of Delhi to dust.
|
But woe to the hell-hounds ! Their enemies know
Who hath said to the soldier that fights in His name—
“THY Foot shALL BE DIPPED IN THE BLOOD of THY FoE,
AND THE TONGUE of Thy DoGs shALL BE RED THROUGH
THE SAME.”
JUSTICE TO CODRINGTON.
|
It is only fair to the late Commander-in-Chief in the Crimea to
let it be known, that he volunteered for command in India—and under
SIR CoIIN CAMPBELL. This was even more magnanimous than SIR
CoLIN’s serving under Copkin GTON. Nothing is so difficult as to §.
a little man to stoop; a tall man may bend without derogation. SIR
WILLIAM ConFINGTON, very wisely, takes everything that, is offered
him. They offered him the chief command in the Crimea: he took it.
They offer him the guardianship of the PRINCE, or WALEs: he takes
it. Those who appoint him ought to know what he is fit for. He wasn't
| fit for the one post, he may turn out admirably suited for the other.
SIR. W. CopriNGTON is a Guardsman, and the beauty of Guardsmen
is, that whether you are providing for use or ornament, whether you
wanta Commander-in-Chief or a Gold-Stick in Waiting, your Guardsman
is equally fit for the place. Tam Marte quam, Mercurio is his motto.
He is warranted to keep in any climate, will pocket any, amount of
salary, and England expects him—as a general rule—to do his duty.
FIVE THousAND REAsoNs for admiring an Ex-Governor General,—
LoRD DALHousIE has handed over his Pension of £5000 to the Indian
sufferers. Truly a Noble lord.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
| A law, you green darlings!
OH, Mr. Punch, I’m nearly done,
My 'elth is broken quite;
I’ve ardly strenth to old the pen,
I’ve skarsly pluck to rite.
Pray listen to a short account
Of my long sad kareer,
And for an injur’d hinnocent
You’ll shed an 'oly teer.
As hinnocent a man as you."
In eighteen forty-three
They found me guilty of a charge,
And sent me oor the sea.
Ten ears the sentens was that time,
| The charge was burglaree;
That’s cracking of a crib, yer no:
Tho, Sir, it wasn’t me.
I served that fust time long enuf,
I think ’twas neer thre ear,
And then they let me out because
My hinnocens was clear.
They found me such a º cove,
Sopius, good, and mild; .
I hadn't half the vice they said,
Of many a little child.
But I was nabbed in fifty-one
| For a cimilar offence,
- And sent abroad a 2nd time
At guverments expens.
This time they guv me seven ears,
A. ear I think I staid;
They let me out because I work’d
So 'dustrus at my trade.
And onestly enuf I worked
Till once, unlucki—ly,
A chap as look'd like me was cotched
A faking some uns cly. -
“He know’d 'twas me,” the peeler said,
“. He know’d my karakteer—”
And so o'cours the sentens was,
Another seven ear.
That kame to pass in 54,
And what was rather odd,
I wasn’t sent abroad this time,
But kep at ome in quod.
But soon my constitution show’d
I couldn’t stand a jail,
And so they let me out, because
My elth began to fail.
They mite as well a kep me in,
And let me die in peace;
For wats the use o' going about
Well known to the poleece.
I wasn’t out 3 month that time,
When I was took once more;
And tried and sentenced to the same
As I’d not served before.
Another 7 ear, and now
(This was in fifty 5) -
My elth was braking very quick,
Tardly kep alive.
That time I thort I shud a died,
I shud if I’d staid there,
And so they let me out to try
And get some change of air.
|
|
A LAMENTABLE LAY. BY A TICKET-OF-LEAVE MAN.
|
The present ear in Febury
They nailed me once agin,
For what the lawyers seems to call
Felonious breaking in.
But I’d a breaking out in March,
A habsis in my side;
And as I was to ill to plede,
O' cours I wasn’t tried.
So this ere 'sizes I cum on
Afore a pune juge,
Who treated me just like as if
My sufferins was fudge.
I told my story then as now,
In most unhappy mood;
The only answer as I got
Was ten ears servitude.
The law like this was never ment
To punish any one
For now the ears fºhud a serv'd
Mounts up to 41.
The strongest man can’t stand it, Sir;
A helefant would fail,
If he were kep for 40 ears
In ostermunger jail.
So, Mr. {...}}. show yer pluck,
Come forad like a man,
And get the “Ticket Bill” repealed
Next session, if yer can.
It’s no use bothering like this,
And giving of us leave;
Why not save all expens at once,
And GRANT Us A REPRIEVE.
LAND BRUTES AND SEA BIRDS.

ance, whose dear faces under mush-
room hats (also tolerably dear) are at
this moment embellishing the beach

ledges at Flambro' for so many hun-
dred years unmolested—even when England was peopled by the most
uncivilised tribes—now in these modern, enlightened times” (LEILA
does not even underline these words of bitterest satire, and we applaud
her for resisting the temptation), “they should be completely extirpated.

for snobs—for hard-hearted, bloodthirsty, beerswilling, lazy snobs, who
think it fine fun to loll in a boat, or on a cliff, in the sunshine, and
blaze away into a snowy cloud of º harmless gulls. It requires no
skill, and the snob has no skill. e bird when shot is useless, but
the snob kills for killing's sake. . He is depriving the coast of one of
its most lovely and graceful living things; but the snob has no per-
ception of beauty, or grace, or purity of plumage, or gracefulness of
motion. There may be a callow brood in the rock cleft, that will wail
and wail to-night and to-morrow for the parents that lie stiff and stark
—their snowy breasts, and violet wings, all, rumpled and dashed with
blood–at the base of the cliff, or float, wild and wandering corpses, at
rest on the unresting sea.
by their incessant firing. Not a bird
fainter, till it rings no longer through the rock caverns, and the whole
brood lies dead and cold—to hang with the murdered parents, let us
hope, in another and a better world, round the neck of the snob-
murderer, as the Albatross round the neck! of the Ancient Mariner.
“LUY " writes in the same strain as “LEIL.A.” “Besides the
extreme dulness and disfigurement of it,” she says, “it made us sad
to think, of the cause. It is so barbarous and wanton, and stupid.”—
(“LUY " is evidently of an impetuous turn, and piles up her epithets
much more freely than the gentler “LEILA #): always to be shooting
the pretty, foolish, harmless birds. ... What cleverness is there in it?
and it is so cruel. We found two left upon the cliff-tops—oh, horrible!
it made us quite sick, and so angry.” No wonder;-would we had
been by when the snob, perpetrated these murders—and had found
him not too big to bully, or even to thrash, if he had resented an
interference. ... But, had he been as big as GoLIATH, we might have
tackled him, for it is certain he was coward as well as snob.
In the name of all that is manly and gentle, Mr. Punch protests
against this cruel and useless slaughter of these º and harmless
winged things, who float like bird-angels between the blue above and
the blue below, and whose wailing music makes so fine a treble to the
rolling organ basses of the great sea. Only let the darlings in mush-
room hats make a point of rating every snob they see at the work,
and º: him what they think of it, as eloquently and naturally as
Our clear
- ‘LEILA” and “LUY " have done in their letters. The snob
is human; he is not incapable of shame, especially when the scorn he
merits is poured out upon him from rosy lips and flashed from bright
eyes. And let every true.sportsman denounce, by act and word, by
theory and practice, this odious and cruel abuse of the gun.
So, let us hope, these gentle visitants of the shore and sea-cliff may
be wooed back to their old homes and haunts, and the white wings
may once more reflect the sun above the angry German §: and
the sad-voiced scream be heard as of old through the raving of the
waters about the rocky foot of Flambro.’

Knobbles, Jun, hears that the later you fish in an evening, the more likely you are to catch something.
He never tries it again,
THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER.
WE hope the following fact will be fully cre-
2 | dited, for it is far too wonderful to be pooh-
%|poohishly doubted. The Heat of the Sun was,
* on Thursday last, so powerful at Filey, in York-
|shire, that a Negro, who went to bathe in the
* Sea, was discovered, upon emerging, to have
# changed colour from a deep black to a beautiful
bright red From head to toe, he was as red as
a boiled lobster / This singular change of cu-
ticle has been attributed entirely to the extra-
ordinary warmth of the water. The poor fellow,
who was footman in a rich lawyer's family, upon
3 losing his natural colour, immediately lost his
situation; but we are glad to state that he has
since been engaged, at a liberal salary, by a
humane Doctor, for the purpose, of trying ex-
ſº periments upon his skin. It will be, also, his

of sending out some wonderful lozenges, to his
patients—but his patients never received them.
At last, it struck the Doctor that the lozenges

THE DIvorce DRAMA.—“Half-price has begun.”
THE CAPTIVE.
After STERNE.
THE bird in his cage pursued me into my room. I sat down close
to my table, and leaning my head upon my hand I, began to figure to
myself the miseries of confinement. I was in a right frame for it, and
so I gave full scope to my imagination.
I took a single clerk in the Circumlocution Office, towards the close
of August; and having first shut him up in his room, I peepe
through the key-hole to take his picture. I beheld his body limp with
the heat of London, and felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was
which arises from being low down in the office, and not getting away
till everybody else has had his six weeks of vacation.
Upon looking nearer, I saw him pale and feverish: from ten to four
daily for ten months, he had pined in that apartment; he had had no
lark, no outing in all that time. As for amusement—
But here my heart began to bleed, and I was forced to go on with
another part of the portrait. He was sitting on his chair in the
further corner of the room, before the table which was alternately his
desk and footstool—a pad of blotting º lay before him scored all
over with the yague scrawls which had occupied so many of the
dismal days he had spent there—he had one of these sheets before him,
and with a steel pen he was adding another aimless flourish to the
melancholy maze.
. As my presence at the key-hole diminished the small stock of fresh
air he had, he lifted up a hº eye towards the ARNOTT's venti-
lator—then cast it down—shook his head—and—went on with his
work of affliction.
I observed his patent leather boots, as he wearily threw up his legs
º the table—he laid down his pen, and took up the second edition
of the Times—he gave a deep sigh—I saw the iron of the Civil Service
enter his soul—I burst into tears—I could not sustain the picture of
confinement which my fancy had drawn—I started up from my chair,
and calling the servant, bade her order me a cab for the Dover Station,
and have it ready at the door by nine in the morning.
I’ll go directly, said I, and have, six weeks' fresh air somewhere.
Let my publishers say what they will.

THE JUNIOR IRISH BRIGADE.
A NEw Irish Brigade is about to be formed under the auspices of
the Brotherhood, of St. VINCENT DE PAUL. This Brigade, however,
is to be established, not for the purpose of impeding legislation, in
the interest of Popºły, but for that of cleaning boots. It is to be
denominated the “Catholic Shoeblack Brigade,” and is to consist of
poor Irish boys, many of whom at present, instead of picking pockets,
miscuous Shoeblack Brigade—to the great peril, as their priests
consider, of their souls. How Catholic shoeblacks are to endanger
their souls in combining with Protestant, shoeblacks to scrub upper
leathers, is a mystery which we will not shock those who believe in it
by attempting to fathom—we will only suggest, that the establishment
of a Catholic Brigade of Shoeblacks, is drawing the principle of
exclusiveness rather fine., Indeed, the idea of the thing is so ridiculous
that most people will probably ascribe it to the imagination of Punch. |
Not so; we should have been proud of the notion; but we are
indebted for it to the Weekly Register, a Roman Catholic paper, and
not, on the whole, a rabid one. #. journal appeals to its readers
; tº: support of this scheme for the admixtion of theology with
ackling.
The project is not likely to be self-supporting. Catholic boots are a
small minority, which is made yet .#. than it might be by some
friars who dispense with everything of the kind. To be sure, that,
perhaps, is no reason why, particularly if they are Irish friars, they
should not employ shoeblacks. “BRIAN O'LYNN,” as we all know,
“had no shoe to his fut.” Accordingly, as is also well known to every-
body, “he tuk and he blackened it over with sut,” &c. &c. It might
not be against the laws of the barefoot Hibernian fraternity to extem-
orize apparent brogues by the simple help of the Catholic Shoeblack
rigade. Whatever amount of success that force may obtain, we shall
be agreeably disappointed to hear of... We do not at all object to the
rigade, although we consider it an absurdity. It is, at all events, not
a mischievous and quasi-treasonable confederacy, and the work which
it will do, if it does any work at all, will be far less dirty than what
has been done by that other Brigade which was organized by the Irish
Priesthood.
A CAPITAL OFFENCE.

temptible fountains, its ugly monuments, its architectural deformities, is

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW MEN OF BUSINESS DO BUSINESS.
Being a Sketch of the Proceedings at a Railway Meeting, and an example to “the Classes
whom City men affect to despise.”
º!, HE General Meeting of the
Grand Centrifugal and Centri-
etal Railway took †: at
*reemason’s Hall, on Thursday
last, pursuant to notice. An
unusual crowd was observed
round the shop of a respect-
able toyman nearly opposite
the hall, some time before
the opening of the doors, and
it was ascertained that dis-
affected shareholders were
making large investments in
- ſº and hard peas.
n a few minutes from the
| opening, every spot from
| which a bombardment of the
º was possible had
een occupied.
At twelve o’clock the Chair-
man, MR. BENIsoN, entered
with other directors, and a
tremendous volley of peas in-
stantly rattled across the hall.
The Chairman, with a calm
smile, put up his umbrella.
and under its cover proceeded
to his place, and took his seat.
The assailants, unwilling to
exhaust their ammunition early in the campaign, ceased firing, and began yelling. At the
expiration of half an hour of this kind of remonstrance, MR. BENISON was permitted to
speak, with occasional interruption by a few personal criticisms, and illustrative notes.
The CHAIRMAN said that there was no doubt the Railway Company had been shamefully
robbed, (Kells, and cries of, “All your fault,” “How's your friend in gaol,” &c.). It might
be said, that it was a disgrace to § managers of the company not to have selected worthier
servants, and to have exercised more vigilance, (“So it is /"), but he treated such remarks
with scorn and contempt. (“Yah / Yah?”) They were the kind of remarks a ribald, press
conducted by anonymous scribblers in garréts, would make (“Fah! Yah!”) and he felt that
commercial men, men of business, ought not to heed such censures.
A WotCE. (ironically) /e:rat censura Columbas. -
The CHAIRMAN. What has Columbus to do with railways? he didn't discover them, he
discovered America, and you ought to know it, Sir, though no amount of ignorance in such a
meeting would astonish me.
Here the meeting hastily passed an unanimous resolution to give the Chairman another
volley of peas, and did; and a preference shareholder having dexterously purloined the
umbrella, MR. BENIsoN was exposed to the rude pelting of the pitiless storm. He bore it
manfully, and took advantage º lull to exclaim: “Boil your peas, gentlemen, next time, if
yon please.” Order being at length restored,
The CHAIRMAN said, that the next pºin: was to decide, who should bear the loss caused
by the villany of their official." (“Fouſ you?”) That was simply infernal nonsense, and he
would call the police if they made such asses of themselves. (Immense uproar.) Would
they hear him now? (Yells.), Q, very well. Take your time, Miss Lucy.
A SHAREHOLDER from the body of the hall here roared, that if the Chairman dared to call
Miss Lucy, he would come round and darken his daylights. -
The CHAIRMAN would like to see the honourable shareholder at it. (A shower of peas.)
He thought that the meeting was a great ass to waste its money in peashooting, instead o
keeping the money to help to pay their losses. (Uproar). You know you must pay them, you
fºolish idiots, continued the Chairman, and I can make you, and I will. (Shame!) . No,
% * is with a set of fellows who hesitate to pay what they ought to pay. (A shower
ºf peas.
A VoICE. The law decides that the preference shareholders are not liable.
The CHAIRMAN. I decide that they are, and I am law here, my dear friends.
A VoICE. Ler non scripta.
The CHAIRMAN. Don’t talk about Scripture in that profane way, Sir, or I’ll have you
dragged out by the collar, I will, by Jupiter. Now, gentlemen, I prºpose that we pass a
resolution declaring the liability of all of you to pay these losses. (A roar of indignation,
and the meeting, too much occupied in shouting to be able to blow through the tin tubes, flings its
#4ts at the CHAIRMAN.)
The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, your hats may be felt, but I’m hanged if your remonstrances
are. (Frantic with rage, the meeting gesticulates, and shakes itsſº at the Chair. The CHAIR-
MAN smiles, but his consin, seated near him, takes a double sight at the meeting, on which the
#ells are redoubled, with cries of Shame! Chair, chair!)
The CHAIRMAN {º} What is your pleasure ?
The MEETING. Put down your cousin for his insolence.
The CHAIRMAN. I shall do nothing of the kind. He would not be my cousin if he did not
take a sight at anybody who annoyed him. (Here a preference shareholder's walking-stick
alighted in the pit of the honourable CHAIRMAN's stomach.) If the fellow who flung that
will claim it after the meeting, I’ll tan his objectionable hide for him until he asks me to
leave off (confusion). Now, then, for the resolution I have suggested. (Ioars of indignation,
catcalls, and yells.)
º
|º
`
-
The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, we are practical
men of business, men with counting-houses, and
ledgers, and MILNER's safes, and bankers’ books,
and all that distinguishes the prudent British
º from men of straw, and therefore it
behoves us to act as such. We have blundered
ſº and we have been done dreadfully,
and now we must wriggle out of the mess as best
we may. I’ve got lots of proxies in my pocket,
and I shall do the thing my own way; and as
you won't agree to my plan, I shall adjourn the
meeting. Get out with you. (Tremendous
sensa/ion).
A SHAREHOLDER. I say, old fellow, I want to
F." case to you. Answer this, now. Suppose
that —
The CHAIRMAN. I’m not such a DAM fool as
to answer a suppositious question.
Here the meeting became utterly ungovern-
able; chairs were hurled at the directors, and
twenty stalwart shareholders calling to clear a
lane, seized a form, that they might bring it to
bear on the Chairman in the light of a battering-
ram, while others flung their useless pea-
shooters, hats, and the legs of chairs. The
Chairman, unable to be heard, held up a large
sheet of paper on which he had written “Go to
BLAzEs,” and amid the increased fury, rushed
out, with his colleagues. The other men of
business, having j the chandeliers, masonic
pictures, and windows, then separated without
doing further damage.
THE BLACK BROTHERS.
To neither of the parties mentioned in the
following dialogue is Mr. Punch in the habit of
making frequent allusion. He hopes, indeed
that the time will come when it will be deeme
as indecorous to name one of them in polite
society as it now is to name the other. But as a
Devil and an Attorney are seldom brought into
such fitting juxtaposition as in the following
Magisteri ãº Mr. Punch may be pardoned
for calling attention to it.
A vicious painter was charged, the other
morning, at the Thames Police Öffice, with
assaulting a dock officer. The latter seems to
have borne a good deal of insolence from the
prisoner, but finally to have referred him to the
spiritual enemy of mankind. On the hearing,
“The prisoner persisted that, a pawnbroker's duplicate
was taken from him, and said MR. SHEPPARD was a pretty
kind of a superior officer to tell him to go to the Devil.
“MR. YARDLEy. But not until you made a disturbance,
and threatened him with the Attorney."
The excellent. Magistrate's estimate of an
Attorney, and his regarding the bringing up the
f| other bad personage as a mere case of º
|
“quits” will probably be approved by all, well-
informed readers. It occurs to us to add, as
utterly irrelevant, that, MR. YARDLEY's heart is
in the right place, and is a heart of oak, pro-
bably the Yardley Oak immortalised by the poet
CowPER.
VIVAT,"VICTORIA REGIA.”
A WARM little corner has been built for the
Great Water Lily, the Wictoria Regig, at an
expense of £3000, in Kew Gardens. It is evi-
dently flourishing, and looks remarkably well.
This gives us an admirable º ºf repeat-
ing rather a clever thing that is attributed to
Žrs. Judy's esteemed friend, Dr. Locock. Being
asked by a lady of rank why the plant was called
Pictoria Regiº, he gallantly replied, “Doubt-
lessly out of compliment, to MRs. Li LLIE,
Madam.” The connection of ideas is not perfectly
established, but still we maintain that this pretty
little “flower of speech” is exceedingly clever
for a Doctor.

CHUPATTIES AND LOTUS-FLOWERS.
3. Günşul.
MR. DisrAELI, in his Indian oration, talked mysteriously of certain
chupatties and lotus-flowers, which passed from regiment to regiment
of Sepoys, before the mutiny, and which were supposed to be, some
way or other, connected with the plot. The chupatties were constate
and officially verified. But nobody had heard of the lotus-flowers till
| MR. DisrAELI transplanted them into his harangue. LoRD PALMER-
ston, MR. SMITH of Cannon Row, the Chairman of the East India
Company, were equally flabbergasted at this new Asian Mystery. The
Indian Correspondence was ransacked, but no lotus-flower. M.R.
David URQUHART even, that great medicine-man and mystery-monger,
was applied to, but like other oracles, he contented himself with
looking wise—and shaking his head, in the manner of SHERIDAN's
Lord Burghley.
Last week there appeared in a º
erudite and scientific article, apropos of the lotus-flower, as a Sepoy
symbol of mutiny—very pleasant to read, carrying us back to
HERodotus and STRAbo, whisking us from Egypt to Cashmeer, and
horrent with barbarous º: and Isis, Ormuzd and
Qsiris, Horus the sun-god, and Kouan-Yin, the Bouddhist Goddess of
Mercy. The article, after a pleasant scientific and mythologic ramble,
winds up with the conclusion that cakes and lotus-flowers are the
symbols of the Queen of Heaven, the Hindoo Godd Mercy, and
an elaborately
, “Wonderful are the facts of BENJAMIN, the son of BENJAMIN–

Mr. Punch can’t say that he exactly understands how symbols of
heaven and mercy can be º: to a conspiracy, signalised chiefly
by assassination and robbery, and the outrage and massacre of unresisting
women and innocent children. So he bowed his head over the lotus.
flower of the Great Asian Mystery, in meek ignorance, and cried in his

EFFECT OF NOT TAKING NOTICE.
OUR OVER-CROWDED THOROUGHFARES.
It has been for years a national conviction, that, if there be one
quality more than any other for which the British nation is egregiously
famous, it is that we are so pre-eminently practical and time-saving a
- us, and
of the
Now, as we have no fear of lessening our popularity (for out of our

innumerable myriads of readers we can spare without missing them
some few hundred thousands), we do not shrink from openly avowing
our persuasion, that, in believing itself practical and time-saving, the
nation, pins its faith to a complete and utter fallacy. . However indi-
vidually we may merit those two epithets, when taken in the aggregate
we deserve the reverse of them. Of this we have a score of proofs at
our pen's tip, but as in point of space our liability is limited, we must
be content with bringing forward only one. The instance we adduce,
then, is the way we waste our time through the overcrowding of our
streets, to which our notice is directed by a recent correspondent, with
whom (except in the slight matter of his spelling the word “ocular”
with two c's instead
cordially agree.
Putting aside the question of its inconvenience, and viewing it
solely from a business point of view, a thoroughfare so crowded that
its name is a misnomer must cause a loss of time which, being money,
our economists ought certainly to take more heed of. To say nothing
of its influence, in fostering bad passions, and tending to the increase
of that mational malignity for which we are by foreigners so ridiculed
and censured, we should like to know the cost, per minute, of a
‘block,” such as in the City is so constantly occurring. The Statis.
tical Society would do the State some service, if they collected some
statistics of these stoppages of traffic, and apprised us of their average
recurrence and duration. We are º that were they closely to
investigate the matter, many. City firms would find these street
obstructions occasion no slight increase of their yearly trade e es.
By reason of the frequent detention of their .#. they have of course
to keep a larger staff than they would find sufficient were the streets
more passable: and the same cause also operates where, business
yehicles are kept, in which case too the cost of wear and tear is much
increased by the collisions which the “blocks” are each attended with.
As an additional incentive to its struggles for street clearance, the
nation should reflect upon the wear and tear of mind and body, which
these street blockades cause daily to its Punch. We calculate we lose
a daily average of twelve minutes and three-quarters through the
stoppage of our Hansom in its progress to and from our office.
Indeed, not º ago we seriously inclined our mind, to the necessity
of walking, and in spite of the hot weather and the melting by the
of one) we may state that we entirely and
RACY LITERATURE.
In the “Sporting Intelligence” of a contem-
porary we find it stated that—
“Ireland has presented attractions powerful enough to
draw from England many of the leading book-makers.”
A little farther on is mentioned the circum-
stance, rather remarkable in connection with the
above statement, that—
“2 to 1 was laid against Ignoramus, who was backed in
the aggregate for about £700."

Kingdom. Still more do we desire to be in-

ventured to back that author, against whom, if
he deserves his name, the chances of success
with an enlightened British Public must be
more than 2 to 1.
The Tax of Letter-Writing.
Jones (busy scribbling). Isay, how do you escape
so easily from the bore of correspondence?
Brown (busy smoking). Why, you see, I am a
very lucky fellow. I have the gift of a confound-
edly bad hand-writing. My friends, when they

ments were almost as crowded as the roadways; and that we had to
elbow our way through, in a manner that we feared would soon wear
our elbows out. On one occasion too (which was our first and final
experiment in walking) we were requested by a lady to escort her
across the street; and the street being Cheapside, we could see by
Bow Church Clock that our 3. cost us precisely seven minutes,
and even then we narrowly escaped being driven over.
We think we have º shown cause why, for our own relief
as well as that of the public, the choking up of streets must not be
suffered to continue. Werewe in Parliament (which for our ears' sake
e are thankful we are not) we should be disposed next session to
| introduce a Bill for the Prevention of Over-Crowded Thoroughfares,
W which all street obstructives should be summarily dealt with.

given to the hospitals, to which these London Juggernauts have sent
so many victims. All omnibus races, we would likewise put a stop
to, and it should be penal for these vehicles of abuse to stop at certain
corners as they now do, not so much to pick up º. quarrels
with their rivals. Correspondents write to Punch complaining of these
nuisances, and in their warmth they coolly look to us for instant
measures of relief. Now, really, we should need the manual appli-
ances of half-a-score of Briarei were we to take in hand the work which
is thus daily handed over to us; and until we have cleared, away the
|Leadenhall Street Obstructives we cannot undertake to rid the City of

Reformer General without investing him with absolute authority over
even the “authorities.” . Were 85 Fleet Street to, supplant, the
| Mansion house, the º of the City streets would rightly be a
part of Mr. Punch's office; but until he supersedes the LORI MAYOR
and Corporation (which at no far distant date will probably be asked
of him) he cannot undertake to discharge their proper functions.
Nevertheless, as a prescription in our letter-box, assures us it would
do the civic magnates good to “have their heads Punched,”, in our
benevolence we pardon the offence of this mild jokelet, and if we do
not quite believe the efficacy of the suggested treatment (for even
Punch's bâton sometimes fails to make impression on the thick heads of
the City) we admit at least that there is wisdom in prescribing a cor-
rective which we have exclusively the right of making up. It is, we
think, vitally essential to the City that its arteries no longer be impas-
sably choked up, and if any dose of ours can give a freer circulatiºn,

ENUNCIATION OF MIND.
At Guildhall, the other day, 'a man, named WILLIAM BAXTER, was
pulled up upon the charge of º, in St. Sepulchre's Church with
intent to commit a felony. He had been found in the pulpit repeating
the Litany aloud. SIR PETER LAURIE asked him, what #. wanted in

“PRIson ER. I found it open, and I always understood a Church was free to every
one. I am subject to religious enunciations, and this was one of them, which came
upon me, and directed me to go to the first Church I found open, and I accordingly
went into St. Sepulchre's, because I found the door open.
“SIR P. LAURIE. What do you mean by a ‘religious enunciation ?’
“Prisoner. It was a religious feeling, which induced me to go in and pray and
preach a sermon.”
This fellow turned out to be a fool, and the Magistrate told a policeman
to take him home. What a pity it is that certain other persons
afflicted with religious enunciations could not have been some time ago
sent home too ! If the preaching Colonels who irritated the native troops
with their enunciations had been sent home from India as soon as their
ranting mania betrayed itself, one cause, at least, of the mutiny would
have been removed. When a man gets a sword in one hand and a
psalm-book in the other, like BALFour of BURLEY, he generally does
mischief with both, and should have the sword at least taken away
from him, and be conveyed to an asylum as soon as possible. When
an officer mistakes himself for a parson, he mistakes his commission,
and resembles poor WILLIAM BAxTER, who seems to have mistaken
himself for his great namesake, RICHARD. The preaching officer is
evidently labouring under an enunciation, arising, probably, from the
influence of a sun-stroke on a brain naturally weak and an excitable
temperament.

APPEARANCE.
“WHAT’S THIS DULL TOWN TO ME?”
A CoRRESPONDENT, writing from Holyhead, complains of the want
of enlightenment, mental and material, by which that populous and
rapidly rising town is disgraced. The lack of intellectual brightness
appears to be the cause of the deficiency of physical illumination; in
other words, a majority of the Holyhead rate-payers are such stupid
fellows, that they will not consent to have their place properly lighted.
Their spokesman, at a recent vestry meeting, whereat was debated the
question whether the streets, should be lighted with gas, or not,
assigned, as an argument for the negative, the consideration that dul-
ness was better than light, simply because it cost º Accordingly,
we must suppose that the dulness of Holyhead, at night, is such as to
amount to total darkness, since if the town were lighted only with a
single farthing rushlight, it could not be lighted for nothing, Dulness
however, sometimes costs a great deal, which would have been saved
by sufficient light. If the economist of the Holyhead vestry should,
some dark night, get hustled and robbed of his watch and his purse, or
should tumble over a large stone and break his leg, he will experience
the possible expense of dulness. He will then have less than nothing
to show for his economy of º except a “game” limb, and will find
that, in the supposition that dulness would cost . he has made
a very lº. mistake, and shown himself a deplora le dullard.

A Scholar in great need was about to apply for a Secretary’s
situation. The terms offered are £50 a-year. On entering the house,
he hears that the Butler's post is also vacant. The wages of the latter
are £120 a-year, besides endless perquisites. He suddenly changes
his mind, º for the Butler's situation, and gets it. It is true, he
loses somewhat of his own self-respect; but then his salary is more
than twice the amount, and he will be treated with greater respect, and
have more indulgences, as well as more time to himself, as the Butler
than he would as the Šecretary. Besides—and this is his chief conso-

A NICE YOUNG WOMAN WANTED FOR A
SMALL PARTY.
IN spite of the profoundness of our penetrating powers, there are
occasionally mysteries too deep for us to plumb; and such a one we
meet with in the following advertisement, which has been lately sent
us by a gentleman in Liverpool to endeavour to unravel for him: –
WANTED, immediately, a respectable Female, not less than 30 years
of age, to take the full charge of a Dairy in a Baronet's family. Applicants
must have held a similar situation, and be well recommended. Also, a respectable
Young Woman to Attend upon Two Young Ladies, several Housemaids, Three
Upper Ditto, Two Waitresses, several Cooks, and at least 30 Protestant Servants of
All Work. Apply at the Liverpool Domestic Institution, 24, Mount Pleasant.
N.B. In consequence of the great demand for Protestant Servants of All Work, the
proprietress of the above-named establishment, in order to supply the increased
demand, has determined to reduce the Fee cf Servants of º W. to a small
nominal charge. Any number of respectable Servants can obtain Situations daily
by applying as above.
Passing, as a problem quite easy of solution, the said existence of
“a dairy in a baronet's family,” we approach, with a full consciousness
of our impending bewilderment, the contemplation of the sentence
which appears to us a fathomless abyss of quite inexplicable mystery.
A respectable young woman is immediately wanted, to attend, not
only “upon two young ladies,” but also on a countless number and
variety of most oddly mixed together people, including several cooks
and housemaids, and “at least thirty maids of all work.” The idea of
these latter having advertised themselves as wanting some one to
attend on them is really so preposterous that we have twice rubbed
up our spectacles to see if we have read the paragraph aright; but as
we cannot, charge our Fº with deceiving us, we are compelled
to accept the evidence of our senses that the words which so perplex
us are actually in print. From the enumeration which is given, it
would seem there are no less than thirty-seven persons stated for the
wanted one to wait upon, and including the two “severals,” the total
number hardly can fall short of half a hundred. The young woman
who would rashly undertake to attend upon so many must not only be
“respectable,” but somewhat superhuman. With so many mistresses
to see to, she indeed had need of half the eyes of Argus, and the
attendance which is looked for at her hands could only be performed
by a female Briareus. Although the epithet is coupled with the
thirty maids of all work, it is not stated whether the applicant is expected
to be Protestant as well as respectable; but assuredly the work which
she is “wanted” to perform is such as any single servant might
reasonably protest against.
TRIBUTE TO LORD PALMERSTON.
WE believe it no secret, or even if it be, we see no cause to scruple
in the slightest to divulge it, that it is intended to present some
small memento to LoRD PALMERSTON, in admiring recognition of the
indefatigable manner in which he has sat through the late protracted
session. It is rare that such activity, as the noble Wiscount's is
combined with so excelling sedentary faculties. It is considered by
good judges, that the way in which he placidly sat out the º:
until they ceased to hinder him from passing the Divorce Bill, was
really quite a masterpiece of sedentary tactics. Indeed, taking into
thought the advanced time of life at which it was accomplished, the
noble lord may fairly be congratulated upon his physical endurance
and good state of preservation. -
It is as yet undecided what the tribute shall consist of, and sug:
gestions are requested as to what will be most suitable. A model of
Patience, sitting, not upon a monument, but on a hardish seat in
Parliament, has, we understand, been hinted as appropriate; and, cer-
tainly, if Patience ever be º LQRD PAIMERSTON, as PREMIER,
is just the man to do it. It is reported also, that an eminent sculptor
has º course) thought of a statue, as being the most fitting gift by
which the British nation can express its †† and, if this idea
be acted on, we shall expect to find it carried out in the conventionally
dull fashion—the noble lord being made the subject of an allegory,
which an appended “explanation ” only serves to make more
fathomless. -
For ourselves, were we consulted (as of course we shall be), we
should consider that his lordship has a mind more practical than most,
and we should therefore recommend a gift of rather use than ornament.
We think an easy chair, now, would be an aptly suited present to one
who has displayed such sedentary prowess: and an inscription might
be carved on it, stating that the gift had nationally been made to one
of the most powerful of public sitters, with the classic motto, (in
proper keeping with his lordship's scholarship)–

THE BEARD MOVEMENT.
“Hollo, 'ENERY | Is THAT You? Why, I HARDLY KNow'D YER witH THAT
GREAT BEARD !”
SMITH THE POET.
i. must be deeply indebted to the Athenaeum for its elaborate
exposure of the plagiarisms of Mr. ALEXANDER SMITH., The noble perseverance
with which every phrase of MR. SMITH's has been overhauled, and the stores of
collected and recollected learning, which have been adduced to demonstrate the
bard's want of originality, are unprecedented in the annals of the literary police.
MR. SMITH is left without the ſaintest rag of reputation, and for our own part,
thanks to the Athenaeum, we do not believe that he is capable of uttering the
humblest sentiment of ordinary life without borrowing both thought and words from
some predecessor.
We are firmly convinced that if he had to desire a domestic to unfasten
one of his—SMITH's—boots, he would steal his expression from SHAKSPEARE,
and say, “Undo this button” (K. Lear. Act P. Scene III.). It is almost
supererogation to help a case, so clearly made out, but, as in the course of
Mr. Punch's own reading, he has chanced to light upon, a few passages which
MR. SMITH has º and which have escaped his reviewer, Mr. Punch
will complete the good work by subjoining them.
The plºilº, in the following cases, are even more apparent than the
majority of those exposed by the Athenaeum, and have the additional feature
of being the fruit of plunder from books which it is rather probable MR. SMITH
may have seen, and not from antiquated and forgotten rubbish, which in all
likelihood he never came across, and which nobody, but a bookworm, with a
motive, is ever likely to come across twice. At the same time, Mr., Punch
assures M.R. SMITH that this exposure is made in all kindness of feeling, and in the
earnest * that by proving to a young poet that he is utterly without merit
of any kind, he may be excited to cultivate his genius, prune his irregularities,
and emulate the Immortals.

But enough. The same process by which the Athenaeum

dishonesty would e ually aid Mr. Punch, but the work has
now been done by the Twin Critics—dome, too, in kindred
spirit, and the public, despite its weak admiration for MR.
ALEXANDER SMITH's freshness, pathos, and vigour, may
take the solemn assurance of the Athenaeum and of Punch,
that there is no single word in all MR. SMITH's poetry
that has not been previously used by somebody else.
POISONING BY MISTAKE MADE EASY.
A CHEMIST and Druggist makes the following offer of
terms for the services of an assistant:—
“Two hours allowed every º
evening, in the shop at seven and out of it atten at night, and to make
yourself generally useful as a Druggist's Assistant, for which services
for the three months you will receive five pounds salary and your
Parliamentary fare to London if business is not sufficient to require .
your services for a longer period.”
No doubt, if our friend the chemist and druggist can
i. a competent assistant at the terms above offered he
as a right to do so. But suppose that the lahour is
not skilled—the assistant not competent. Tincture of
opium is put up by mistake for black dose, or muriate of
morphine for sulphate of quinine; and somebody is poisoned.
In such a case, the verdict of the coroner's jury surely
ought to be manslaughter against the chemist and druggist
for employing an assistant whom he could not expect to
be qualified for a situation accepted at beggarly terms—
like those above instanced.

AN AGREEA8LE CORRESPONDENT.
S - º º =\
EAR MR. PUNCH,-“I wish to address a few words to you
in your character of pater patriae; you who are for ever
showing up some official VERREs, or crushing, some domestic
CATILINE. Doubtless, inasmuch as you nobly backed up the right,
you remember how, not long ago, Yº Civill Servantes of y". Crowne
most uncivilly carried their point against the fatherly kindness
of the Ministry, and got rid of what they blasphemously called
the Superannuation Swindle. Swindle, indeed Don’t they know
full well that it was all done out of love. They asked for bread, and
a paternal government handed them a stone, after the most approved
.. of SolomoN’s model father. Well, and now they have got this
miserable 5 per cent. (why, bless your venerable nose, what’s 5 per
cent. in an income of £70°, why, it’s only £3 10s. after all, a mere
nothing, not worth squabbling about!) Mark, I say, what these
rebellious children do when they have got their paltry pounds.
I do declare I met that reckless §."; spendthrift, BROWN, tide-
waiter at the Customs, actually taking his wife, and child down to
Margate, “for a day or two on spec, as he said, “they’ve never, seen
the sea before;’ he added, “indeed, we have not been out of Town
these seven years.” Of course, they have not?" What right, I should
like to know, have people like that to go gadding about, looking at the
| sea, just as if they were Members of Parliament, used up by the
Session-work? - - - - -
| “I felt pained by his ingratitude, but said nothing. But, as if
that was not enough, I could hardly turn round, before whom should
I see but John Robinson, of the Audit, who grasped me incontinently
by the shoulder, and made my hair stand with horror, as he rolled out
in his jolly way: “I say, old fellow, what do you think I’m going to do
on spec of no swindle? Don't tell anybody, but I’m going to pay my
washerwoman.’ Pay his washerwoman, indeed! What does he want
with a washerwoman and why do washerwomen want to be paid? Do
you know, he added, ‘I’ve just been looking up that poor fellow,
JoxEs, of our place, he’s gone in for some old, port, as the doctor
recommended him to do long ago, I think he’ll mend yet.' I was
rapidly sickening, but managed to gasp out my pleasure at the news,
and bolted on. TXut on reaching home, my horror culminated, for
there, on the table lay a letter in the well-known bold hand of HoRNBY
of the Home. (He took a good degree at Oxford in 184—, and has
now £200 a year.) It began:— -
** * SMITH, my dear Boy, Congratulate me ! Thanks to that brick,
LorºD NAAs, it’s to come off next week! Her governor, you remem-
ber, said I must wait another year, as he never could be brought to
regard £190 in the light of £200. But it’s all right, now, and that
ten pounds a-year wiiſ go well towards an assurance for LILY,” &c. &c.
some check upon this lavish expenditure of what ought, by rights, to
be, Public money? º
What will that much mis-represented statesman think of it all? I ask
again in fear and trembling! For my own part, I mean to refund
annually to the good old Chancellor, my humble six pounds, an
propose to represent it as coming from “One who has put salt on a

STRAHAN, PAUL, BATEs, AGAR, ROBsoN, and REDPATH and

What a cargo of rascaldom!—shipped in the Nile !
To record their discourse on their sail Bot’ny-bay-ward,
Would need JEM the Penman's experience and style.
Those two dozen pilgrims of glorious DAN CHAUCER,
... Beguiled their excursion o'er rough Kentish ways,
By “righte merrie gestes,” though at times rather coarser
Than our high-toned hoºk: now-a-days.
But what are the tales CHAUCER’s fame has been won by
Compared to the tales of that precious ship-load?
How. PAUL, famed for doing in ways we’d be done by,
With his pious out-pourings had lightened the road!
What a gold-mine of thrilling adventure in AGAR–
The disguises—the dodges—the ride in the van'
What schemes for wind-raising, more vast, e'en if vaguer,
From BATEs, that remarkably bus'ness-like man.
Or from REDPATH, whose virtà made London and Paris stir,
Till his “Crédit Mobilier” fell below par !
Then what rich legal lore, from JEM SAWARD the barrister,
Who, alas, somehow got on the wrong side the bar!
From Robson, what small talk of coulisse and green-room,
Where business hº he used to beguile !
And I thought, as I read—if there only had been room—
What a privilege 'twere to go out by the Nile /
As that ship's river-eponym, yearly o’erflowing,
Leaves the slime of new harvests to fatten the shore,
I thought what a crop of life-lore would be growing
From the Nile-mud, deposited e'er we got o'er'
I had fancied the stories, had pictured their tellers,
‘Nile-Eclogues’ already appeared in my brain;
At two shillings all stations found buyers and sellers,
With a cut on the cover, or one-and-six plain.
But alas, as the world still knocks down"all romances,
So the Globe dispelled mine—they’d have been such a hit!
Where I read this Nile-freight was mere penny-a-line fancies,
And found that “Er Nilo’—in fact, “nihil fit.”

GAMBLING MADE EASY AND COMFORTABLE.
We have seen, a magnificent advertisement of the “BATHS or
How BURG,” in which the Tapis vert is made to glow with quite a
couleur de rose. The advertisement is all roses, whilst the thorns are
carefully kept out of view. We draw the reader's attention to the
danger that lurks under these beautiful flowers of speech... We
accordingly take the liberty of amending the advertisement, as it has
evidently issued forth blooming, à la GEORGE Robins, from the flowery
pen of some poetic croupier:-
blackness (Noir) of despair is often succeeded by the hectic blush (Rouge) of success.
It should always be borne in mind by the timid, that those who experience the
º ill-luck at cards, are proverbially fated to be blest with the greatest success
love. "Ce sont (literally) les Jeuz de l'Amour et du Hasard."
“A capital restaurant is attached to the Saloon. In dining, as in playing, there is
no "charge for the table.” Restoratives always ready, American or otherwise.
“There is capital shooting in the neighbourhood. The report of a gun never
alarms the experienced habitué. There are pistols and guns, always on sale, or
hire, in the gambling saloon. Powder and shot, and ammunition of every kiud can
be procured, at the very lowest terms, at the Ball-room.
“On the closing day, there is always a grand battue, at twelve o'clock even a
at night, when, such is the demand for fire-arms, that it is with difficulty a gun, or
pistol, can be procured, either for love or money. It is a scene of the grandest
excitement worthy of CALLott, or EDGAR PoE.
“There are several experienced º: engaged at the establishment. There
is also a most commodious Hospital for the º: of the nervous, or the
maladroits, who may meet with any accidents whiſat out shooting. It is in the
proximity of the sale du jeu, so that the patient, though stretched on a bed of
suffering, may be enlivened by the agreeable cannonading of the roulette-ball, or the
playful rattle of the dice. The croupier's voice can be distinctly heard by the dying,
as he joyfully exclaims. ‘Messieurs, le Jeu est fait.”
“To meet the prejudices of English visitors, a Coroner, of twenty years' sitting,
from one of the mºst criminal counties of Ireland, is engaged for the Season.
“A Band plays beautifully and loudly
effectually drowns the cries of the wounded, or the groans of those who are either
despairing, or disabled. The “Dead March' is a favourite piece of their repertoire.
*English beer (“HASARD's entire’) always on draught.
“N.B. Funerals contracted for in the most liberal spirit.”
The above is the true picture, with all the varnish rubbed off, of
such places as Homburgh, Spa, Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden, Ems
an
the like. But we doubt if the Duke of Nassau, the Grand duke of
Baden-Baden, or other highminded potentates who derive a lar
rental from the letting of their gambling-rooms, would like to exhibit
such a picture, truthfully as we have coloured it, to the inspection of
the fools who are enticed, in their names, to be fleeced every year at
their mineral-watering-places, where gambling is made as seductive
as possible.

-- OMBURGH (INALL ITS STAGES), near Frankfort-the-Deuce-is-
the-Maine.—SUMMER SEASON, 1857.-The Mineral Waters of Homburgh
have long been celebrated for their cleansing properties, especially in their action
on the breeches pocket, which they clean out in almost no time. They stimu-
late the monetary circulation, and are powerful remedial agents in removing
buttons, bars, bolts, locks, or other causes which are known to impede the proper
distribution of wealth. They expand the heart, let it be ever so close; and they,
also, throw open the hand, no matter how close-fisted, making it part freely with
any amount of gold that may be secreted in it. In cases of an undue, repletion of
coin, they act with the most beneficial results. In less than an hour, the patient is
so considerably relieved, that he feels quite a different man.
“The Casino is one of the best adapted of its kind. It is surrounded with thick,
impenetrable, retired forests, in which the patient, who has . º from the
oppressive heat of the room, may, perfectly unobserved, recover at his leisure his
accustomed nerve and composure, so as to enable him quickly to return and lose
more money. He may give audible vent to his rage and disappointment, and no
one hear a word of his agonising regrets. There are delicious sparkling fountains,
in which he can cool his fevered brow. There are lovely gardens, of which the
perfume is more than sufficient to take captive the little sense the perturbed wanderer
may have left. Summer arbours, laughing rivulets, smiling statues—all conspire
to cheat the visitor into a momentary gleam of happiness. The trees whisper hope
—the very zephyrs carry into the dizzy brain sweet tones of comfort. The broad
terrace, with such a commanding view before it that it seems almost to look into the
future, is paved with the very best intentions.
“Across the grounds, murmurs softly, most invitingly, a smooth glittering river.
It is so deep that the 3. with all their depth even, have never been able to
fathom it. In its placid bosom, patients have effectually sought a refuge from the
anxieties of this deceitful world. Lethe may be called its name, for one plunge
into those friendly waters is indeed oblivion, but oblivion in its sweetest form.
Human cares are for ever washed away in an effervescing torrent of rose-water!
There is one charming, secluded, dark spot, with a weeping willow, in the finest
state of preservation, bending funereally over it. It is called “LE SANs-Souci DU
Jourt R.' Ophelia might sigh in vain for a more attractive spot.
“The mind need never despond in this Elysium of gaiety and gambling. The
hand which is given to roulette in the morning, can be devoted to waltzing in the
evening. There are balls, other than those which spin round the hazard-table,
which take place three times a week. The losses of the afternoon can be effectually
shaken off during the dances of the evening. Thus the day at Homburgh is one

BRITISH SCULPTURE EQUALLED IN ROME,
John BULL cannot make a statue, and he never could; but there
are other people who could once and apparently can no more—witness
the foreign, as well as the native, ...}. for the Wellington Monu-
ment. Witness not only those failures, but witness also a fiasco or
mull which has been made in the metropolis of Art itself, and that by
a Roman artist, and more than that, by an artist appointed and, com-
missioned by the Pope himself. This is the monument, which has
been erected by command of his Holi NEss on the Piazza di Spagna in
commemoration of the addition of the dogma of the Immaculate Con-
ception to the Roman Catholic creed; and which is described by the
correspondent of a contemporary as a-
“Colossal figure in bronze, whose diameter exceeds that of the column which
supports it, to say nothing of the crescent and globe, surrounded by the emblems
of the evangelists, also in bronze, on which the Madonna stands, and which add
to the weight of the summit.” -
The author of this account goes on to describe the structure on
which the statue is elevated as º: of marbles ..". coloured
-gilt, yellow, white, greenish with white, stripes; the pedestal also
consisting of coloured marbles. Thus the monument itself is an
artistic conception which is quite the reverse of immaculate, and
appears to typify the direct opposite of what the Pope intended it to
commemorate. According to our informant, moreover, the statue on
the top of the column is out of the perpendicular, and slopes so much
to the westward as to look unsafe, and to cause the Romans to quicken
their footsteps in passing it; whilst, raising ºpiciº glances at the
slanting image, they mutter, “pende”—it leans ! Now, a terremoto is
a not very uncommon occurrence in Italy, and if the monument is top-
heavy, and loaded with a statue inclining from the centre of gravity,
sooner or later a catastrophe might happen which we may indicate in
the following adaptation from one of the songs of infancy:—
“Hush-a-by statue, upon the pile's top,
When the earth shakes, the pillar will rock;
If the earth heaves the structure will fall:
And down will come statue, and dogma and all.”
In the minds of a superstitious population the dogma will tumble
with the statue. If, however, the column should stand firm after
having received the benediction of the Pope, who had made arrange-
ments to bless it on the 8th of this month, of course the Tablet and
the Univers will assert that its stability in a position out of equilibrium
is maintained by a miracle. At present it appears to be simply a
marvel of incongruity, comicality, and misproportion, and JoHN BULL
may rejoice in §§§. that Italian genius has now at last pro-
duced a work of architecture and sculpture worthy of a place by the
side of our British chef d’aeuvre on the top of BURTON's Arch; which
it would keep in countenance, and at the same time assist in creating
public merriment.
THE BEST MONUMENT TO JENNER.
A YouNg lady was solicited to contribute towards the JENNER
Statue. “Nay,” she said, reverently, “I consider I have already
erected a monument to his honour,” and she pointed to her beautiful
countenance; and true enough, thanks, to JENNER's discovery, there
could not be discerned upon it the smallest disfigurement by the small
ox. Acting upon this idea, we have to make the following smooth-
aced proposition. We beg to suggest that every handsome lady,
single or married, or widow, who, i. been duly vaccinated, has
succeeded in preserving her beauty from the . of the above fearful
visitation, be requested to take her turn in standing for one hour only
of her lifetime on a pedestal in Trafalgar Square. We maintain that
the exhibition of her face, in its unblemished state of loveliness, would
be the handsomest, at the same time the most appropriate, statue that
could possibly be erected to JENNER; and a statue, too, that would be
sure in every age to command the ready homage of all men.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A ROMANCE OF HAMPTON COURT.
ONE of the French heroes of the Crimea, now on a visit" to us, his
allies, writes to “the Governor of the Château of Hampton Court,” to
complain of insult received by himself and a lady companion, from an
official at that palace. Not only, Mr. Punch, hopes, will the example
he is about to record have been made, but the whole body of officials
in that edifice will, he trusts, receive intimation, that they are the
servants of the public, and that their duty is civility... Moreover the
exceeding good behaviour of the thousands who visit Hampton Court
during the summer entitles them to the utmost respect, and even if
it be necessary sometimes to be peremptory, that a crowd may not be
delayed while an excited gent is harguing for his habstract right to
'ave a stick, distinction must be made in the case of a stranger, to
whom hospitality dictates especial courtesy. The consideration shown
on the Continent to foreigners desirous to see sights is proverbial,
and Punch is glad to find that the French officer, now complaining, is
able to testify to the general politeness of our police, which he contrasts
with the behaviour of the Hampton Court Bumble.
The French gentleman's appeal to “M. the Governor of the Château,”
was not made in vain. No sooner had he read the charge than he
summoned two vassals, and having borrowed a Boy ER's French dic-
tionary from a British dramatist who had taken lodgings at Hampton
to complete an original play, the Governor desired the offender to be
brought to him in the eastern turret. The rays of the setting sum
gilded bower and lattice, the lucid stream beneath the windowsparkled
like a valley of diamonds, while the Maze lay like an emerald in its
green richness of beauty. -
“Gramercy, ifackins, and by our Lady,” said the Governor, as the
trembling creature was dragged in, and the massy iron-bound door
clashed behind him, “marry come up, sirrah. So, thou hast insulted a
gentleman of France, a gallant knight, who honoured our poor château
with a visit.”
“So please ye —” faltered the offender.
“But it does not pleaseme,” thundered the Governor of the Château,
‘and that thou shalt straightway behold. Seest that book?” he cried,
dashing the work of Boyen upon the oaken table. .
“I do—I do"—stuttered the culprit-adding in confused terror
like MR. HARLEY’s, “I do, most-most-audacious, preposterous, an
antibilious Sir, I do.”
“Seest thou that sheet of paper,"dog, and that pen, and that ink?”
The unfortunate man stammered out an assent.
“Sit down then, slave, and before thou risest from yon three-legged
stool, thou shalt have penned me, in the French language, an ample
apology to the gallant thou hast insulted.”
“In French ** gasped the culprit.
“In French. Thou did'st insult him in English, therefore shall thy
reparation be in another tongue. Begin!” said the Governor, savagely.
“PETER DE RACREM, is thy engine of torment ready, in case of his
contumacy.”
“So please your Excellency,” said PETER, “it is; and I have newly
stuck therein some rusty nails with upturied points, for the better
convincing of the patient.”
“SIMoS DE Buggs, is thy snake and toad dungeon in order?”
nor's knees, and adjured
... “Never in better, my lord—the hissing, an ye pause at the door, is
like that of a locomotive.”
“ Under these circumstances, begin thy letter,” said the Governor.
The unhappy man flung himself on the ground, clasped the Gover-
i. to show mercy. He could no more write
a French letter than fly, he said. He implored compassion.
“There is the Dictionary, hound !” said the Governor... “The dial
º to six. At seven, if the letter be unfinished, I will rack thee
or an hour, and then consign thee to the toads and snakes.” And the
Governor lit an enormous pipe of the period. -
The unhappy man sat down in an agony of despair. But catching
the fiery eye of his lord, he seized the pen, and began—
“Mounseer,”
Then he looked up piteously. But there was no mercy for him. He
looked wildly round, and seeing a nail at some distance from the
fº. he suddenly hanged himself thereto, by his handkerchief.
e was instantly, cut down, and replaced at his work. In utter
despair he proceeded, picking words from the book.
“Jesuis très fäché que je donner vous aucun sauce mais—"
The Governor's head was averted, the vassals gossiped in whispers.
He watched his opportunity, and sprang from the turret window, an
awful depth. Two vigilant sentinels caught him in their arms, and |
brought him up-stairs. He was again placed at his paper, and wrote,
“Le fact est, que je avais prendre un verre de eau de vie à qui je suis non accou-
tumé et—”
A brilliant idea. He held one of GILLott's enormous steel pens, as
large as a dagger. He instantly and frantically stabbed himself, but
the point broke on the buckle of his braces, and a goosequill was
immediately thrust into his hand. He continued,
“Ilavoir touché montete, et—”
Seizing the inkstand, the wretched man, now excited to madness,
swallowed every drop of the jetty fluid, and looked round triumphantly.
“It will not hurt you,” said the Governor, with a smile of #.
“At least, not much; for it is some 40s. port with a little blacking in
it. Replenish the bottle, PETER, and watch him.”
“I can do no more,” gasped the ill-fated man. “Do your worst.”
“Sayestthou?” said the Governor. “We will not rack him to-night,
PETER, as I have a dinner party, whom his shrieks might disturb.
Throw him to the snakes, Smºon, and we will talk to what is left of
him in the morning.”
“Mercy! mercy!” cried the doomed man. “I could never abide black
beedles, let alone snakes, and as for toads—ugh! Mercy, my lord, and
I will never offend in the like sort again.”
The sun was now sinking behind the majestic trees, and darting long
lines of radiance through their foliage like fiery darts. Earth was
bathed in stillness, and the very fountains plashed more musically than
their wont. Cursed be the heart that is unmoved by the sweet
influences of nature’s loveliness. The Governor, a stern man, whose
heart was as a sealed fountain, gave way.
“Open the door,” he said, gently.
The massy door stood open.
“Take that, hound!” he said, kicking the culprit through it, and
with another kick sending him from the top of the stairs to the bottom;
“and that!. And,” he roared, “never let me catch thee insulting my
visitors again. PETER and SIMON, go to the buttery and crush a
flagon. Ha! the dinner gong! I must apparel me for the banquet.”
MORMON INTELLIGENCE. V
THE Mormons have invented a new Alphabet. They are to have a
newspaper of their own, set up in type that they only can read. The
Mormons are a separate type of people, and as such we see no harm in
their having a separate type to themselves. On the contrary, we are
rejoiced that the good honest type, which is generally used for the
Fº of civilisation, will not be defiled by their foul fingers. In
truth, we possessed notype that could have suited their base purposes.
“Bourgeois,” for a set of dissolute reprobates that have not a
Bºurgeois amongst them, would have been far too respectable.
“Minion” would have been about the most congenial representative
of a minion race like them. We fervently hope that the Mormon
characters are such as cannot possibly be met with in any other part
of the world-characters of so base a cast that no respectable printer
would think of admitting them into his establishment. It should be
with Englishmen a great source of congratulation, that a people, that
has not a single thought in common with us, should have º a.
distinctive medium for giving shape to their thoughts on paper. It is
a safeguard, for which we should be grateful, as there will be less
danger of our simple-minded cooks and housemaids being, for the
future, corrupted by their dangerous doctrines.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DEPREDATORS OF DOWER,
RAVELLERs will rejoice to learn
that the authorities of Dover
have made a commencement of
dealing with those extortionate
knaves,...the porters of that
port. The ringleader, other-
wise master of those fellows,
MR. GRIGGs, has, according
to the Times, been suspended
for three months. The offence
of MR. GRIgGs was one of
omission — he had thought
proper to omit to enter in the
report-book a complaint against
one of his gang, a man named
BAKER, charged with having
insolently refused to carry a
Fº lu to Water-
oo Crescent. . BAKER,
nevertheless, reaped the re-
ward of his insolence in a
suspension of one month. The
MAYor of Dover, who pre-
sided at the tribunal before
which these worthies were
cited, animadverted on the sad
want of discipline and order
which had been found to pervade the body, of licensed porters, who
appear to conduct themselves in an intolerably licentious manner, and,
indeed, to take liberties which exceed the bounds of all licence. His
worship also expressed a strong opinion of the necessity of setting to
work in order to remedy the complaint so loudly and generally made
against the Dover porters. It is remarkable that the Court which
adjudicated on the offences of MEssRs. GRIgGs and BAKER was the
Dover Local Board of Health; from which circumstance, it plainly
appears that the inhabitants of Dover itself have come to regard the
fraternity of licensed porters as a regular nuisance.
PORTRAIT OF LORD PALMERSTON.
AS IMAGINED GENERALLY BY FOREIGNERS."
HE is a monster, he is a fire-eater, he is a child-hater, he is a woman-
scorner, he is a man-oppressor. -
It is doubtful whether he hasn't a cloven hoof. At all events, his
right foot has all the stamp of one. From the peculiar side-way in
#. he sits on the edge of a chair, it is not quite certain whether he
has not, also, a caudal appendage! His manners would, decidedly,
warrant such a diabolical belief.
It is impossible to say when LoRD PALMERSTON, goes to bed, or
when he rises, for he scarcely ever, sleeps. Certainly, there is no
record of his having ever been caught asleep. Occasionally, he rests
his head on a loaded cannon, and snatches, a few minutes' rest. He
allows himself fifty-four seconds for his breakfast. A hard crust,
washed down by a glass of rum, and he is ready for an explosion in
any part of the world. -----
A sad, austere man, he never takes any pleasure. , Millions hang
upon the twitch of his eyebrow. In his hand, he holds the fate of
empires. Can, such a human being laugh? His mouth is of iron—
his eyes of polished steel. His lips are rigid as the bars of a prison.
A smile is never seen through those bars! His words are all mono-
syllables, and each of them falls as heavily as a ten-pounder. In this
way, his approach is known fortunately long before he makes his
! dreaded appearance. -
His habits of business are extraordinary. He dictates to four secre-
taries at the same time, opening his despatches all the while. He has
telegraphs running from his room to the uttermost parts of the Globe.
He works these telegraphs all, by himself, after a cipher only known
to himself. In five minutes, he could tell you what is going on in
India. In less time than you could accept an invitation to dinner, he
will let you know what the SHAH of PERSIA has had for breakfast.
He has spies all over the world. It is believed that LoLa Montes
is one of his emissaries. SchAMYL and SoYER are both in his pay.
BARNUM sends him private information twice a week. QUEEN CHRis-
TINA consults him. Kossuth is only one of his political bagmen.
MAzzINI, LEDRU Rollin, CHANGARNIER, NARVAEz, &c., &c., all take
orders from him. -
He has minions, by millions, everywhere. His messengers darken
the surface of the earth. Out of every three post-horses you may be
sure that two (at least), are engaged by creatures of LoRD PALMER:
STON's. At the very door of his bed-room is stationed a mounted
postilion, ready at a moment's notice to fly off to execute his nefarious
t
bidding. In this way he has been known to despatch fifty couriers
in the course of one night.
His letters are 1596 per diem, rather more than less. He answers
them, all himself. As it is well known that every Englishman abroad,
who has the smallest bit of an hotel grievance, writes to Lord Pai.
MERston, it will be readily conceived that his house resembles a Post
Office a great deal more than a nobleman's mansion. His item for
sealing-wax alone amounts to not less than £1,472 a year.
During the Session LoRD PALMERston resides at the Tower of
London. When he moves out, he has always a battalion of dragoons,
who accompany him with their sabres drawn, and their rifles loaded.
Under his, white waistcoat he has a suit of chain-armour. His
brougham is bullet-proof. His favourite weapons are revolvers, one in
the right pocket, and the other (of sixteen barrels) in the left. They
are always full-cocked. . In a handsomely-mounted malacca cane, the
Disturber of the peace of the world carries a poisoned dagger.
His meals are frugal. The only thing he is fond of are bifteks aur
pommes. These he prefers half raw. There is always one down at the
fire ready for him. When excited, he will consume as many as nine in
one day. He takes º owder in his coffee instead of sugar.
. He never goes to the Opera. You neversee him in the Park. He never
dines at the Palace. When he speaks in the House, all but Government
officials leave it. In public, no one cheers him but the paid Police.
adies sedulously, shun his presence. Little children run away
from him, and hide themselves under their nurses' aprons. Servants
tremble, as with an ague, before him. The teeth of clerks chatter
when they have to address him. A dog puts his tail between its legs
when it is near him, and sneaks away, as if it was sure it could receive
nothing but kicks from the toe of such a man! His entrance into a
town has been known to turn every ha'porth of milk sour.
At home, as abroad, his name excites terror, if not hatred. It is
doubtful if, through life, he has ever known one friend. His enemies
you may count by tens and tens of thousands.
No wonder that the English, Press supports him. An Editor is his
footstool—the steam-engine his pet H. thing. He has a private key
to the principal newspaper offices in London, to let himself in secretly
as often as he pleases. At twelve o'clock at night, he is often seen
stealing away, cloaked § to the eyes, from Printing-House Square.
And this is the man who rules Englandſ this is the monster, whose
baneful influence is felt all over the Continent Under the hoof of
one so reckless, so unprincipled, as LoRD PALMERSTON, he is a bold
man who would venture tº give two years’ purchase for QUEEN
VICTORIA’s throne !
SADDIE AND BRIDAL.
A New Romance has just been imported from America, in the fol:
lowing short paragraph, which must º: interest, all lovers of
horsetlesh, except those Parisian epicures who prefer it to beef:-
“A WEdding on Horseback–A Texas paper tells of a young couple who eloped
on horseback, accompanied by the Clergyman who was to marry them. The lady's
father gave chase, and was overtaking the party, when the maiden cried out to her
clerical friend, "Can't you marry us as we run ?' The idea took, and he commenced
the ritual, and just as the bride's father clutched the bridle rein, the Clergyman
pronounced the lovers man and wife. The father was so pleased with the dashing
action that, as the story goes, he gave them his blessing.”
Some doubt may be thrown upon the authenticity of the above
narrative by reason that the bride's rein is therein denominated the
bridle rein, with an apparent view to a pun upon the words bridle and
bridal; whence, inferring the character of the whole from that of a
* the sceptical mind may regard the entire story as a joke.
Whether true or false, however, it would form a splendid subject for
an equestrian drama at Astley’s. The alleged adventure beats that of
the “ Foung Jochinear,” who, according to WALTER Scott, eloped on
horseback with a collateral ancestress of SIR JAMEs GRAHAM’s. That
gallant young horseman could not have married the “lost bride of
NETHERBY” till he had got her across the border, clear of the Forst ERs,
FENWICKs, and MUsgRAVES, and other bores, who were after them.
The length of the English Marriage Service would not have admitted
of the solemnization of matrimony on horseback, even before the
Reformation, and if Loch INvAR had had his blacksmith by his side as
well as his beauty behind him, he could not have been made a happy
man on this side of the Tweed. Perhaps the Texan Marriage Service
resembles the Scotch; so that it .# be performed almost in the
twinkling of an eye, and effectually celebrated in the leaping of a
fence, or the taking of a five-barred gate.
Whatever obstacle, however, ecclesiastical law may oppose to
Marriage on Horseback, no cause or just impediment is ºthereto
by the laws of the equestrian drama: accordingly we hope to see the
Bride ºf Texas produced as soon as possible at Astley's aforesaid,
where the feat of leaping through a hoop in a gallop will be surpassed
by the much more extraordinary performance with the wedding-ring.
The heavy father—supposed to ride fourteen stone—bestowing his
blessing out of breath both with speed and emotion, would give the
piece a conclusion at once affecting and ridiculous.

R. MoRCRTON MILNEs puts
forth, with his usual grace

field-sports. He hopes that
one day they will be “super-
seded by geological and
botanical pursuits,” which
he thinks will afford their
votaries greater pleasure
than “the staining the
fair carpet of mature with

Whether his having put
forward this amiable plea
has prevented MR. MILNES
from bagging his grouse
and partridges'this autumn,
Mr. Punch does not know
s — any how, MR. MILNES
has not sent him any. But
the idea of the kind-hearted
Member for Pontefract has
conjured up, in Mr. Punch's
fertile º a curious series
of newspaper announce-
ments, of the period when
hammer and scissors shall
have supplanted horse and
gun. How will this read :
who rent the swamp near
CHALCI poRUs SMITH bagged several prickly pears, upon which the
arty afterwards sat, in discussion, and various points came up... The
É. and Rev. PROF. LEE secured several noble Fungi, especially an
| Agaricus pesſilentis, with which he experimented on a gamekeeper, for
provided. Lunch was supplied by a confectioner from Squashton.
The party was satisfied with the preserves.
“MR. MongKTON MILNEs is entertaining Wiscount PALMERSTON
and a distinguished party at Frystone Hall. Tuesday was their first
day on the rocks, when they had excellent sport. To the noble Wis-
count’s hammer fell thirty-seven lumps of granite, four fine bits of
feldspar, a large slice of mica, and some oolites. MR. MILNEs suc-
ceeded in bagging twenty-eight pieces of granite, and in catching some
quartz in a primary, trap set overnight by the keeper. MR. LAYARD
brought down the side of a lime quarry; and MR. HENRY DRUMMOND
potted several score head of fossils. The theories were rather wild,
and the savans were often at fault, and were also exposed to annoyance
from the clergy of the district, who warned them off several fields; but
on the whole the first tlay of the season was satisfactory, and the
sportsmen pelted one another with their game all the way home.”

“WHAT can we two great Forces do?”
Said Steam to Electricity
“To better the case of the human race,
And promote mankind's felicity?”
Electricity said, “From far lands sped,
Through a wire, with a thought’s velocity,
What tidings I bear!—of deeds that were
Never passed yet for atrocity.”
“Both land and sea,” said Steam, “by me,
At the rate of a bird men fly over;
But the quicker they speed to kill,and bleed,
A thought to lament and sigh over.”
“The world, you see.” Electricity
Remarked, “thus far is our debtor,
That it faster goes; but, goodness knows,
It doesn’t get on much better.”
“Well, well,” said Steam, with whistle and scream,
“Herein we help morality;
That means we make to overtake
Rebellion and rascality.”
“Sure enough, that’s true, and so we do,”
Electricity responded.
“Through us have been caught, and to justice brought,
Many scoundrels who had absconded.”
Said Steam, “I hope we shall get the rope
Round the necks of the Sepoy savages,
In double quick time, to avenge their crime,
And arrest their murders and ravages.”
“We’ve been overpraised,” said both; “we raised
Too sanguine expectations: -
But with all our might, we haven’t yet quite
Regenerated the nations.

DIVIDE, AND CONQUER.
SoME foolish persons, evidently red-tapists in heart, though imagining
themselves reformers, have devised an absurd “test,” as they call it,
of the efficiency of members of Parliament. They count the number of
Divisions in which a member has been counted, and give the highest
credit to the man who has gone oftenest into the lobby.
This is just the sort of test one would expect to see prescribed by
rigs and shallow fellows. Nothing is so easy, and then there are
ittle sums to be done, and figures are always right—we beg pardon,
statistics such folks call them—and everybody can comprehend that
the man who voted twenty times must have been in the House more
frequently and longer than the man who voted five times. But, unhap-
pily, figures will not show which of the two men did the best service.
& course, any member who will sit in the House, or in the smoking
room, ºft the whole of every ..", can take high honours under
this test. He can go to sleep in the library if he likes—the division
bell will wake him, or a servant of the House will arouse him, if
enjoined to do so. And he can run in, rubbing his eyes, and marc
out and be counted, and the “statistics” of the prigs will record his
indefatigable attention. Or, if he is a more fidgety blockhead, he can
pay a fidgety attention to every topic, whether he have the faintest
idea of the real question or not, and can vote against an Aqueduct
being allowed between two towns, of whose names, to say nothing of
their wants, he never heard before, or divide in favour of a Viaduct on
a railway that runs, through a district as unknown to him as Meso-
potamia. Equally, the “statistic”-mongers will give him praise and
honour, while, in reality, he ought to be kicked for impertinenee.
These *::::: have published some returns of the attendance of
members during the last session. And, as an example of the value of
such applause, and as an illustration of the attendance of small men
and of statesmen, let it be noted that “Cox the Attorney” is at the
head of the list, having voted in one hundred and sixty divisions, while
LORD JoHN RussBLL has voted in about fifty. Now it may reasonably
be said, that for one public question on which Cox the Attorney knows
anything, LoRD JoHS is intimate with the bearings of a hundred.
A similar result is found in the case of the best men in the House.
The GLApstones, PAKINGTONs, WALPOLEs, ELLICEs, and others whose
time and whose votes are valuable, squander, neither in clerk-like
attendance, waiting for divisions, whereas the AYRTONs, HADFIELDs,
WILLIAMSEs (Ld), and such like infra-mediocrities are always watching
the Speaker's sand-glass, eager to write their reputation in that
Parliamentary sand. -
The statistic-mongers remark complacently that in “Attendances”
MR. Cox, of Finsbury, stands first. This, even apart from the gentle-
man's political status and intellect, does not exactly astonish Mr. Punch.
Why, Cox is as aforesaid, an Attorney, and to make “Attendances.”
is the one duty of attorney-life. The alligator's—bah—the attorney’s
book, in which he records the deeds of his days, for the shearing of
clientry, is called the “Attendance-book.” hat wonder that Cox
should retain in Parliament his professiºnal taste for attendances! . If
he is writing Cox's Memoirs of Parliament, we will be bound he makes
the work up, daily, after this fashion, and that of his craft. -

ALLEGORIES ON THE BANKS OF THE TIBER.
IIEN the Pope returned to
Rome the other day, a few
of his subjects, probably his
tradesmen, got up a demon-
stration in honour of the
event. Among the various
means which they resorted to,
in order to celebrate the re-
storation of his Holiness to
the bosom of his consistory
was the erection of triumphal
arches, which were ornamented
by allegorical paintings. The
allegories in these works of
art must have been particu-
larly “headstrong,” so much
so as to have been impracti-
cable to any but the most in-
ventive artist. Their subjects
were “the Austrian Com-
cordat,” “the Immaculate
Conception,” and “the Estab-
lishment of the Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy in England.” We
will not say that we cannot
conceive how these transac-
tions could have been alle-
gorised, because we can, what-
ever difficulty everybody else
may experience in so doing.
“The Austrian Concordatº
might have been typified by a
picture of the EMPEROR OF
Austria and the Pope him-
self, the former kneeling to
the latter, and presenting him
- - - -- - - - with half-a-crown. A repre-
sentation of his Holiness, exhibiting a bran-new coin from his own mint, would have
served to express “the Immaculate Conception,” and “the Establishment of the
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy in England” might have been most accurately symbolized by a
portrait of CARDINAL WISEMAN as he appeared on the 5th of November, 1850, carried about
the streets of London in effigy.

It is no new thing to hear people discovering in men some traces of resemblance to the
brute creation, but such likenesses are commonly the reverse of flattering. With very few
exceptions, which may serve to prove the rule, it is for some bad quality the similarity is
traced, and the comparisons, in general, are for something odious. Ladies mean to pay a
compliment when they call a man a duck, but if rightly analysed the phrase is the reverse of
complimentary; for i. are few things more ungainly than a duck out of water, and in that
no man can be considered in his element. For one use of the simile “as brave as a lion,” we
hear twenty of the words “as º a fox,” or “as silly as a goose; ” and such epithets
as “pigheaded,” “asinine,” and the like are in almost constant conversational employment.
| A further proof of the unkindness of these animal allusions is furnished in the ... popular
| belief that, rightly to do justice to his prominent feature, a lawyer ought to figure in the human
menagerie as the Ornithorynchus, or beast with a bill. In the benevolence of our nature, we
have ourselves long struggled to discredit this assertion, but we regret we are at length
| obliged to tender the submission of our faith. In the following advertisement, inserted lately
in the Times, we find the piece of evidence which has completely overwhelmed us:—
REFORM YOUR LAWYER'S BILLS.
AW–Costs in Arrear.—A gentleman, well skilled in making out and settling costs (and of
concocting where no entries are made), is desirous of a temporary ENGAGEMENT in that department,
in town or country, at a moderate commission. Address, &c.
Referring to our dictionary, so as not to run the risk of our memory misleading us, we find
the meaning of the verb to concoct” is to “fabricate,” and when coupled with accounts,
its vulgar synonym is “cook.” The process therefore of concocting costs amounts in plain
English to the pure fabrication of them; and we may infer that more than half the items in a
“concocted” lawyer's bill are as fictitious as the incidents in a third-rate French romance.
Of course, the longer they are in arrear, the more scope costs afford, for the talent of
invention; and where the concocter has no entries to refer to, his work is not so much to
“make out” bills of costs as to make them up-in the sense of making up which is
synonymous with story-telling. - -
We are reluctant to judge harshly of the legal profession, whose good bookkeeping, indeed,
has passed into a proverb. But from the announcement of a supply we cannot help inferring
the existence of a demand, and we may assume in the above case that the “gentleman.”
would not have advertised so prominently his talent for concoction, if he had not known it
was a marketable quality. - -
º: to thank him for the revelation he has made, as it will put us on our guard to see, in
ure, whether our lawyer's bills show any signs of cookery.
Still, however we may quarrel with his lax morality, we are dis-
of a suit with all the carefulness of detail of the
most prolix penny-a-liner. But it much lessons
Qur surprise to know these legal histories are, in
fact, mere works of fiction, such as any novel-
spinner could concoct without much difficulty.
Of the mysteries of book-keeping we have
always lived in ignorance, and know not which
is easier, the º of double or of single entry.
But certainly the way above alluded to of making
out accounts with no entries at all appears to us
by far the simplest system to pursue, and one
which, if unchecked, may walk into one's pockets
far more deeply than the double or the single
entry could do. -
THE BORE OF THE BARBER'S
SHOP.
* WIGGINs, Isay, how can you wear
Such a prodigious lot of hair?
Go, have it cut—I wonder why
You go about so great a Guy.”
“Astonished, Jon Es, you well may be,
These thick and bushy locks to see;
But wherefore, listen. Fear and dread
Retain this growth upon this head.”
“What fear, what dread?
Hath sealed thee for a Nazarite *
Unless in Bedlam you’d be shut,
Go instantly and get it cut.”
“”Tis very easy, saying Go;
But there’s the rub. I would; but no,
I cannot stand it any more;
That step entails so vast a bore.”
“What bore attends the barber’s shop
That you should carry such a mop?
*... that your reason may be saved,
Should not be merely cut, but shaved.”
“That horrid bore, as sure as fate,
Annexed to cropping of the pate
Of being importuned and dunned,
Whereby the customer is stunned.”
“Your meaning, I believe, I guess;
The bear's grease which the artists press,
The “extract’ and Circassian cream;
And will not quit the tiresome theme.”
“You’ve hit the blot with needle's point,
They pray and beg you to anoint
With their vile unguents, and are sure
To urge on you their “fixature.’”
“Their wares I steadily refuse,
Their masty grease I never use,
The hair it mends not—spoils the hat,
Through which exudes the fluid fat.”
“O JoxEs! a fortune safe I see;
As hair-dressers, let you and me
In business start—and advertise
* No pressing washes, grease, or dyes.’”

“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“There are so many cases of cruelty practised by what you men are
pleased to call law, (which always strikes the innocent and lets the guilty
escape) that, we grow indifferent; but I do hope that for the sake of humanity
the laws will not be permitted to oppress a brave and gallant soldier (at least
he is a Colonel, and F. sure is brave and gallant) whose name appears in to:
day's Times. Ineed not mention his name, though it would do him nothing but
honour, for the very evidence against him shows that he must be one ºf the best
men that ever lived, and a MoDEL HUSBAND. And now some grasping creditors
are trying to worry him, and had not even the decency to give up their
ridiculous persecuting claims though they were told that he was ill, and away
from his native land, poor fellow! Even MR, LINKLATER, whose admirable
management in the British Bank business, made me think he must be a dear
creature, sets himself against this brace and kind soldier, and pretends to think
he is not so ill as he says, notwithstanding that his wife confirms the account.
I am much surprised at ‘Mr. i.
“The case would first make any married woman’s mouth water, and then her
eyes. To read the list of the things, the beautiful, lovely, costly things, which
this husband gave to his wife, and all in three months, and then to think that
such a man is being persecuted bylawyers and creditors! Of course my husband
had not the kindness to let me have the º: at breakfast, because he knew
the matter would interest me; but after he was gone to business, I kept the
paper-boy waiting half an hour scratching the door-paint, while I read the
account, and copied out a few of the items. Now look here, Mr. Punch, and
blush for your meanness and that of your sex, when you read what this brilliant
exception to the rule gave his wife (and a happy woman she must be) in three
months. Observe the prices—no bargains, or cheap things, mind, but good
articles, proving that the man respected himself and his wife.

INCREDIBLE COCKNEYISM.
Is the following story, told by the Interness Courier,
possible?—
LARMING ACCIDENT-A gamekeeper and shepherd at
Donchaly, who were out shooting along with three English sportsmen
upon the 18th ult, parted company with the gentlemen to drive the
game towards a certain point agreed upon. Unhappily they made their
appearance in a different place, and having been mistaken for game were
fired upon. Five barrels were dischar at them, and the shots took
effect in the face and hands of the keeper and shepherd. A º:
was immediately dispatched to Bonar Bridge for DR. Mackay, who
repaired to Donchaly without delay, and extracted all the grains of lead.
It is fortunate that the shots were at 60 yards range. The invalids are
now able to continue their work.
... We strongly suspect that this is a Scotch joke; one of those
jokes which extend over a whole anecdote, at every two or
three words of which the narrator laughs, and all other Scotch-
men present lºgº also, and eyerybody else wonders why?
Related with a Scotch accent in a Scotch circle, the above
tale would no doubt be received with immense laughter. But
it must be a romance. See what it involves. Three English
sportsmen mistake two Scotchmen's heads, at sixty yards, for
a brace of grouse, and all three of them blaze away at the two
heads which they imagine to be heads of game. The bodies
must, at that rate, have been concealed by an interveni
mound or hillock, so that the heads only were wisible, an

“And why was she obliged to remain in town P” -
“Because her husband, MR. MonTAGUE BLAKESBY, of the same
address, thought that he should enjoy himself much more without
MRs. MonTAGUE, and without a child, and a nurse, and a parrot, and
about seventeen boxes, which his wife deemed absolutely essential to
her peace of mind in travel. So he proposed that she should go with
the child, and nurse, and parrot, and seventeen boxes, to Brighton, and
that he should ‘take his chance of a little fresh air,” (as he heartlessly
put it) and join her at Brighton in his own good time.”
“Well, why didn't she go?” - -
“Because she was a woman of spirit, and, like a woman of spirit, as
she could not get Baden, refused to have Brighton. So they had a
Sulk, and he left Gower Street early one morning. Being a tender
husband, he would not wake his pretty wife from her morning's dream,
but, leaving a cheque upon her dressing-table, stole out of the house
with an enamelled sac } nºtif.”

“And gambled?” -
“For shame! nobody gambles, at least no respectable English
gentleman. But as everybody goes to the tables, why. MR Montague

“And as everybody wins—at least they all come home and say so—
MR. Mont AGUE won.”
“Yes, a good deal.”
“And repenting of his unkindness towards his wife, he wrote her an
affectionate letter, forgiving her for her petulance, and mentioning that
he had made up his winnings into a packet, and that he should expend
them in Paris (en route for England), in the purchase of something upon
which he knew that her dear heart had long been set.” -
“You have been married, Sir, and know the tenderness which the
thought of a wife inspires in a husband—at a distance from her. That
was just the letter he wrote from Baden to Gower Street.” -

pretty blue eyes had scarcely opened upon her widowed couch, and
the cheque upon her toilette table, than she rose, and, giving a slight
consideration to the amount mentioned on the paper (it was anything
but what it ought to have been, but still it was a respectable sum)
ordered her coffee, and desired, that the child, nurse, parrot, and
º boxes might be ready for the Scarborough train at twelve
o'cloc .”
“And they went to Scarborough P”
“And from Scarborough she wrote to Paris, where MR. MonTAGUE
received the letter. He read it on the Boulevard des Italiens, and was
delighted that instead of hot and crowded, Brighton, his wife was

cºnjugal relation. MR. MonTAGUE BLAKESBY, was not delighted at
all; he waxed angry at his wife’s presuming to think for herself, as to
ºplace,of making holiday. And he did not buy her a single present
in traris.
“How mean. How did he excuse himself?”
“He wrote her another letter, expressing his deep, regret, that,
desiring to increase his little winnings to a sum that would enable him
to buy his darling (that's what he was brute enough to write) some-
thing more worthy of her, he risked them once again, and lost them all.
And to give a lively colour to his story, he appended to his letter the
sketch, which you may observe above engraven. It represents (he
alleged) his agony when the demon of gambling had tempted him to
lose the coins he had treasured for his heart’s idol.”
“And he had not lost the money?”
“Not a sou. Brought it safe to Paris: in fact, to London.”
... And to repeat the original question, Where did the money go to?”
“It was just enough to pay MRs. BLUE-EYE's bills at Scarborough
for herself, child, nurse, parrot, and warehousing of seventeen boxes,
for the cheque “went before she well knew where she was;’ and if he
had not remitted his winnings, the blue-eyes, child, nurse, parrot, and
seventeen boxes would have remained in pawn at Scarborough.”
“There seem several morals to this story. One is, that a husband
should always do what his wife desires. Another is—
“That one being of an anti-matrimonial character, it shall not be
printed. Whatever is is right. Let’s liquor.”
WERBUM. SAPIENTI.
THERE came a sharp cry o'er the dark heaving sea,
A cry that the beast of the jungle was free;
The beast we had petted and thought we had tamed
Was fouling his maw with the flesh he had shamed.
Our fairest, our feeblest, were tortured to sate
His merciless lust and more merciful hate,
And the wail of their agony compass'd the earth
And thrill'd every heart in the land of their birth.
Thrill'd every P-not every—Nol one was unmoved,
The tidings he sorted, and some he improved,
He was deaf to the death-shriek that rang o'er the foam,
And yet he could hear the least whisper from Rome.
For his Sovereign was there, who his “ titles’ bestowed,
And there more than half his º was owed,
So that country or kindred could have little part
Jf the petty lay element left in his heart.
Should he mourn if our children were torn limb from limb,
Or our women—for what are our women to him *
No offspring, no tie, no sweet burden has he, .
No wife clasps his neck and no child climbs his knee.
A lonely, a barren, affectionless man -
(There are sermons in stones) will discourse if he can ;
He will love the class only to which he belongs
And will raise their estate upon other men's wrongs.
In a want of regard for his class he will see
The source of disasters of every degree—
Would he himself trust to professional lore,
And flash his red stockings in redder Cawnpore?
Be this as it may—for ourselves, at the least,
We care more for wife or for child than for priest;
We are true to the light on our Fathers that broke,
When they honoured Weleda beneath the dark oak.
For women and children were saintly and dear
In the forests of old ere a priest had come near,
And long ere he’d plundered their boughs to repair
What he dare not uncover—his sham PETER’s chair.
Let him vaunt his old wood, his old bones and his stuff,
Till we’ve relics and rosaries more than enough,
But if with our heartstrings he trades for a plea,
There never was Wise-man so simple as he.
A Fact fresh from the Minories.
A CIGAR-MERCHANT waited upon a Tailor, and proposed to him to
do business upon the “Mutual Accommodation System.” The latter
assented upon the understanding that the tobacconist was to find his
own cloth. “Let’s be honest,” he said; “Cabbage for Cabbage.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
| ITH the return of the Shoot-
ing Season it is common to
*| find paragraphs inserted in
the papers, giving full sta-
tistics of the bags which
| have been made at the coun-
| try seats and shooting-boxes
of the sporting aristocracy.
| As these descriptions little
|vary in their dull and dry
º monotony, and can be of no
great interest to the general
reader, we are somewhat
| puzzled to account for their
annual insertion; and we in-
cline to the belief, that they
are paid for as advertise-
ments, and are intended to
attract the notice of the
| poulterers. Noble sports-
| men could not, without sacri.
fice of dignity, announce that
they were open to supply the
tº. with game, and that
- their preserves were so well
*> EE stocked that the largest or-
JE2-E= ders could be executed with
-- the promptest possible des-
patch: but by simply stating what they kill per diem, they leave the
trade to draw its inference, and take down their address. -
If our assumption be correct, there is some reason in thus adver-
tising what sport has been enjoyed by owners of estates, and the con-
coction of such paragraphs may be looked upon as part of every
steward’s business. Occasionally, however, we find notices inserted
which seem more the composition of the flunkey than the steward, and
in which we are completely at a loss to see the use or reason. Such a
one, for instance, we take to be the º which, merely altering
the name, and spelling it to suit the flunkeyish pronunciation, we quote
verbatim from a country print:-
“The youthful EARL or PHEASINkton has been spending his September on his
mily estates. We understand his lordship gives early promise of becoming an
excellent shot."
Now, we have no wish to speak slightingly of his lordship's sports-
manship: on the contrary, indeed, having some pretentions to that
quality ourselves, we think a boy may do worse things than aim at
being a good shot. As far as our acquaintance goes, a good sportsman
is by no means therefore a bad fellow; and had we the teaching of his
lordship's young idea, we should be pleased to find we had so promising
a pupil. For the credit of the PHEAsºnktons, if for no other reason,
we trust the youthful Earl will prove (at one-and-twenty) a man of his
word, and that, if only for his poulterer’s sake, he will keep his promise
to “become a good shot.”
But although we see no harm in the young Earl's early learning how
to use his gun, we certainly can see no good in taking public notice in
the papers of his prowess. It cannot interest themation to know what
bags he makes; while the mention of his sporting feats may lead him
!. that there are higher things to aim at than partridges, and
pheasants. As an Earl, his future place will be among the Lords as
well as on the heaths and commons, and he will find befitting exercise
in the field of politics not a whit less readily than in those of beet or
turnips.
We think, therefore, that paragraphs such as we have quoted serve
no end, but that of filling up a paper. If it be deemed requisite that
notice be directed to the talents and the prowess of the rising aris.
tocracy, let it be reserved for other columns than the sporting ones.
With all our admiration for the skiii of a good shot, we would rather
see a youthful Earl the subject of a leader in the Times than of the
most flaming notice in Bell's Life. Besides, there is no saying, if
these paragraphs continue, to what absurd misuses they may come at
last. If the flunkeyism by which they are ºctated be unchecked, we
shall soon find the prowess of our noble sportsmen recorded in the
papers from their very bib-and-tuckerhood, from their first shot with
the popgun and their first trial of the tops—both the leathers and the
peg-tops. Having a remarkably robust iº we can just
conceive how it would edify the public to find inserted gravely some
fine morning in the Times, as a pendant to the foreign or political
intelligence, or whatever else might happen at the time to have chief
interest, some such a paragraph as that which follows:–
“We are delighted to inform our readers that the infant heir of the
most noble house of BLAzEAway, who still takes an airing daily in the
family perambulator, was last week, for the first time in his young
existence, trusted with a ſly-gun. It is seldom at so tender years that
I
- - the
º for shooting is so rapidly developed; but that his
youthful lordship promises to be a first-rate shot will be at once
inferred, when we state that on Saturday, assisted only by his nurse,
he succeeded in bagging more than twenty brace of blue-bottles.”
TOAD-EATING.
As for the courtesy of the EMTEROR OF THE FRENgh towards the
English officers who visit Chalons, it is all hollow. His Majestyloses
no opportunity of insulting our authorities by offering some violent
contrast to their proceedings. It was only a few days ago that we
read how a French officer ña invented a great improvement in the
screw for propelling steamers. He calls it the Flute-screw, and its
marvellous advantages were seen on an experiment. But this not
being large enough, what does the º retended ally and
friend, do. In common delicacy, while English officers of rank were
about him, he would have conformed to their customs; would, first
have snubbed the Flute man, then dawdled and dallied for months
before giving him, a trial; then, having reluctantly conceded a trial,
would have tipped the underlings the wink, and taken care that the
trial should be like that accorded the other day to MR. PRIDEAux (of
the steam boilers); namely, one in which he should be obstructed in
every unfair manner by officials predetermined that he should not
succeed. º if the EMPEROR had any of the courtesy attributed
to him, he would further have complimented English officers by taki
the invention for nothing, and breaking the inventor's heart. Ins
of this graceful attention to his guests, Louis NApoleon acts in
diametrically opposite fashion, he commands the invention to be “at
once applied to one of the largest ships in the French navy, the
inventor to have every assistance in working it out, with the certainty
of a reward and honour, if successful.” And we call this Sovereign
our ally, and praise his frank hospitality and courtesy! John Bui,
you are an avaleur de couleuvres.
THE TWO CHURCHES.
THE NEW.
Is Sunday at our watering-
place by the broad blue
German Ocean;
The streets are still, the
sands are bare, the cliffs
forlorn and bleak;
The fly-boys and fly-horses
have a pause in their de-
votion,
For if to labour be to pra.
aw
they’ve been praying all
the week.
A Sabbath stillness reign-
eth over earth and sea
and sky,
All Nature round has gone |
to Church, so wherefore
should not I?
The crack Church at our
watering-place is very
fine and new ;
Pure Gothic down to rere-
dos, and sedilia, and pis-
cina;
With poppy-heads on open
seats-wescorn the cush-
ioned pew—
And our curate he intoneth, so that nothing can be finer;
And we’ve candles on the altar, and occasionally flowers—
In short, a small St. BARNABAs is this new Church of ours.
“So primitive!” our Curate says—“so truly Apostolic!
No Protestant distinctions of private seats and free!
Each portion of the building has significance symbolic: ”
Though, save the poppy-heads, nought’s significant to me.
Their soporific meaning is clearly to be seen,
Thanks to the comment furnished by the sleeping heads between.
But, finer than our fine new Church—tiles, altar-cloth, and all,—
The gules, and or, and azure on nave and chancel-pane,—
And early-English lettering emblazoned on the wall,—
Are the “miserable sinners” whom these open seats contain:
Qh!, the cloud of summer-muslins—oh! the flowered and beaded show
Of tiny summer bonnets, in gorgeous row on row !

HUSBAND MEN AND LOVERS.
N Tuesday last weekla.
well-deserved testimo-

our civic TRIPTOLE-
MUs, the worthy MR.
SHERIFF MECHI, by a
number of his friends

Miss Piccolom INI is
reported to have sung,
“No, he never loped

however, to know in
what the appropriate-
ness of the songs to
the toasts consisted,
taking this as º

MINI represent. She
never could have been such an impudent little puss as to sing such a ballad as that
off her own hook. We can only surmise that she was, on the occasion, the represen-
tative of Agriculture, considered as a nymph of whom the PRINCE may, without impro-
priety, be said to be, because he motoriously is, passionately fond, and who may be
imagined to express a sense of the honour of being beloved by his Royal Highness in a Strain
affectionately ironical. “He never loved me—oh no!—didn’t he rather?—didn’t he though P”
Piccolomini's song may be considered as the equivalent to saying; the reply suggested
being similar to that conceived to be expected by a filial, young vocalist when he obliges his
sentimental companions and playmates with ‘Oh, don't I love my Mother?” The passion

B moral, on the one hand; and, on the other, need occasion not, the least jealousy on the
part of MR. MECHI, although that gentleman's affections are fixed on the same interesting
object as those of the PRINCE.
REVERSING THE ORDER OF MEMBERS.
MR. BRIGHT has been setting an example worthy of his name, in writing, to somebody
who pestered him with a request for a subscription to a bazaar in support of a Presbyterian
church at Birmingham, a letter; whereof the following lines are part:-
“Since I have been in Parliament I have always abstained from subscriptions for objects connected with
the constituency I represented, and I intend to continue that course. A contrary course would lead me into
an expenditure which I could not consent to with any prudence, and might lead to an endeavour to secure
public favour by means which I cannot practise or approve.”
Hear, hear! . To ask a member, as member, to subscribe for the local objects of his
constituents, is to ask a public servant to remunerate the public for serving it. You might as
well make the same request to a private domestic, and solicit your man John, who cleans
your boots, to contribute towards the papering of your rooms. If you thought fit to
enlarge and stock your cellar, you might, with equal reason, and as much dignity, apply to
your butler for assistance in paying your bricklayer's bill and that of your wine-merchant.
It would not be a bit less ...}.} you to call on your maid-of-all-work for a donation to aid you
in sending your son, to college. That is, always supposing, of course, that your public
servant is to be really your servant, and not, on the contrary, your lord and master; your
roprietor who buys you with subsidies and contributions, in order that he may sell you
or patronage, or, may exert the power, which you give him as the consideration for his
largess, in some other way to gain his private ends. Electors who expect to get money out
of their members should chalk up “To Be Sold,” and not adorn the walls with such mottoes
as “Reform” and “Economy.” Indeed, instead of importuning their political servants
for, gratuities and Christmas-boxes, constituents should, if they want to be well and
zealously served, occasionally themselves give their representative JoHN THOMASEs a “tip.”
| WELL, WY NOT, MY TEARP
ONE of the organs of the English Jews bursts into a frenzy of gratitude to one of the
penny papers for a curious favour. In police-case reports, where a Jew has been the culprit,
the penny paper in question “is generous enough not to designate the persuasion of the
offender”—to name merely ABIMELECH NEBUGHADNEzzAR, without adding “a Hebrew
dealer in marine stores,” or as the case may be. This is gratefully recorded as a new step in
the course of liberality. Well, but, if Jews wish to appear in courts of justice as Christians,
why can't they come in the same character into the high court of Parliament?
DRUMMING FOR THE DRAPERS.
OVER the counter, my Skippers!
Spurn the effeminate shop,
Kick off the carpeted slippers,
And the cheating yard-measure let drop.
Sergeants are busy recruiting,
England invites volunteers;
Surely you’d better be shooting
Sepoys, than shaving our dears.
|
Shove on his back in the kennel
The shop-walker, bully and smirk,
Tell him you’re cutting the “flennel” |
For manly and masculine work.
At fighting you mean to be gluttons,
Though your faces are white as new wax;
You know that you’ve souls, above buttons,
To drill button-holes in the blacks.
Make shortish work with the niggers,
See how they’d scuttle and squeal,
When you “put in at very low figures,”
A foot and a half of good steel.
They never knew yet what our hate meant,
Your bayonets, by jingo, shall show’m,
en, heroes, you “make no abatement,”
But “send every article home.”
Future MACAULAYs and GIBBONs
Shall rescue your memory from loss,
And tell how the vendors of ribbons,
Won, gallantly, ribbon and cross.

Mounted breaches, regardless of height,
And never bore silks to a counter
More quick than those colours to fight.
You'll soon lose that delicate pallor—
Exercise bronzes the cheek;
You'll be New Patterns of valour,
Though perchance you may look “more

Contrast with such work as your trade is,
(Diddles, and dodges, and bilks)
Your march, on return, and the Ladies
Adoring your noble shot silks.
Right soon will the enemies know you,

“What’s the next thing we can show you?”
Then show them how Britons give fire.

HORSE EXERCISE.
AN Indian officer, writing from Dinapore,
and complaining of the inefficiency of a certain
General, who has been fifty years;in the service,
and whose bodily infirmities totally incapaci-
tate him for command, says:—
“Surely it is high time for any field officer to retire
when he requires help to be put on and taken off his horse f"
It must be a pleasantry, or a mistake, to call
an invalid like that a field officer | If he belongs
to one, it should be a field at the back of an hos-
pital, where, in the event of an accident, he
would be able to meet with prompt assistance.
The only Champ de Mars for one so infirm ought
be the field in front of the Hôtel des Invalides; for
it would not be agreeable to hear of a com-
mandertaking the field at the head of an army in
a perambulator! . It must not be supposed we
are laughing at this officer's infirmities. On the
contrary, we mean to say, that so old a veteran
fully deserves a lift; and, if his name was put on
the pension list; we should be extremelyrejoiced
for the safety of all, to hear of it; for it would
undoubtedly be the best reward for one, who,
during a period of fifty years, has #parently
served his country so well, “on and off.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A VISION OF SIREN SOUP.
--------
º ~~
THE Alderman woke from his nightmare, howling a terrible cry:
Punched his wife's face with his elbow : at morning she had a blackeye:
Started the lady in terror, giving a species of scream,
And this was old BLOGGs's apology, this, the account of his dream:—
“SALLY, I'm blestif our SAMMY, next time he comes home from school,
Tells them there stories at supper, I’ll take and I’ll wop the young fool.
What was his call for relating things that I’ll swear isn’t fax,
How MR. WHATSHISNAME bunged up the ears of them sailors with wax.
“How º young females like mermaids had petticoats all made of
Scales :
The schoolmasters ought to be towelled for filling boys' heads with such
tales,
And how they sang songs for seducing the crews of the ships as they
passed,
And this cove kept himself from their clutches by getting tied up to a
mast.
“I suppose as Imixed up together SAM’s anecdotes touching them drabs
With my sausages, kidney, Welsh rabbit, Scotch ale, scolloped oysters,
and crabs,
Or whatever beside I’d for supper, a meal that no Alderman misses,
And Idreamt, SAL, as I was the party—the name I remember–ULYSSEs.
“I dreamt I were sailing the ocean, enjoying the motion uncommon,
(You know what I’d soon a-been doing at sea, was Iwaking, old 'oman)
And what did I see on a rock (it’s as true as the sermon in church),
Why, one of the liveliest turtles as ever flapped fin at old BIRCH.
“But, SAI, he worn’t laying discreet, like a babe with a shell for its
€d,
Awaiting with proper decorum till somebody cut off his head;
But, with him a codfish and wenison, all dalancing up their end,
And playing on music, and calling me, just as if I was their friend.
* Nice kind of impident critters,’ says I to a sailor or two;
“I’ll just take a swim to them rocks, and astonish the rascals a few; ”
Just fancy me saying it, SALLY, and talking of swimming so fine,
That haven’t once taken a bath since the year 1809.
...And by Gog I were going to do it, regardless of wetting my togs,
The wi. kep bleating and crying: “Come here, MR. ALDERMAN
LOGGs l’
When the sailors they clutched at my collar, with knuckles so bony
and big,
And held me as tight as policemen keep hold of a slippery prig.
..It was no use my bawling and scolding, for just at that minute again
That SAMMY's infernal description came back to bewilder my brain:
Their ºre all full of red sealing-wax—some one had dropped it
*** ** in hot, - - - --
And sealed it with dominy dirrijee—what’s on the Mayor’s silver pot.
'Then all the three impident critters they plopped all at once in the sea,
And with their windictive mouths open,came swimming to get hold of me,
And making all queer kinds of noises, they swarmed up the side of the
oat,
And I felt their wet flappers and noses beginning to get at my throat.
“So then I bawled out in my terror, the thing having got past a joke,
And striking out fiercely at random, I’m happy to say as ſwoke.”
To all which instructive narration his Lady vouchsafed no reply;
But with what she called Odour-Cologney sat sulkily dabbing her eye.
THE LATEST CONGRESS OF WIENNA.
READERs of continental intelligence are doubtless aware that an
extraordinary Congress has been recently held at Vienna—a Congress
of dancing-masters: which was constituted not only of the representa-
tives of Teutonico-Terpsichorean interests, but also of plenipotentiaries
from Prague and Odessa. The subject of the deliberations of this august
assembly was the question, of momentous importance not only to the
whole fashionable world, but also to the casinos and pleasure-gardens,
of the introduction of new figures in dancing. This serious j solemn
inquiry was resolved in the affirmative. ãhe Congress, “after much
anxious reflection,” determined on the introduction of a new quadrille,
which has been invented by PROFEssoREICHLER (Professor of Dancing),
of Prague. ...Our own correspondent has just sent us, some account of
the proceedings, which, being public, he was enabled to attend. He
says that a greater number of pumps certainly never met together
before in any Congress than those that were assembled in this; and
expresses the belief that there are not so many contained even in the
British Association for the Advancement of Science. Such a getting
up-stairs and playing on the fiddle, he informs us that he never did see.
estates that the discussions took in a great measure the form of a
ballet of action; inasmuch as it was necessary for the professors com-
posing the Congress to support their various positions, and theses by
practical demonstration.
Consequently, in the eagerness of disputation there were often
a great many of them dancing all at a time, which was mighty droll;
but a sight still more ludicrous was that of a Member of the Congress
every now and then illustrating his views by an excursion down
the middle and up again, or by a series of stationary capers and
gyrations in the º of caralier seul—an object considered by our
correspondent to be the most ridiculous in creation. Bohemia was
much elated by the triumph of her nationality in the adoption of the
scheme of a quadrille proposed by her representative Professor. Our
Correspondent thinks it rather strange that British interests were
unrepresented in this Congress, and expresses his wonder that he did
not see our old friend BARON NATHAN among its distinguished
members. No doubt, however, the British Court will, in regard to
this matter, conform readily to the practice of the Continental Powers;
and the new Quadrille will have only to be danced at Buckingham
Palace, in order to be immediately performed at Cremorne. The tune
of it will soon descend, from the Palace to the Cottage-piano. A
favourable contrast is to be drawn between the conduct of the heads
of the Dancing Profession and that of the prelates of the Romish
Church, as respectively exhibited with reference to the settlement of
a moot point. The dancing-masters met in Council, according to
ancient and orthodox principle, before presuming to promulgate a new
quadrille. The prelates allowed Pio NoNo to proclaim a new dogma
on his own mere authority. A novelty in dancing, approved of by a
Congress of Professors, will be universally accepted, or at least
encounter no opposition but that of Exeter Hall. The millions who
are interested in the decision of the dancing Congress of Vienna will
await with intense eagerness the formal ratification which it will no
doubt receive in the next ball at the Tuileries.

QUACKS OF ADVERTISING COLUMNS.
WE rejoice to hear that the advertising quacks, whose celebrity is the same as that of
Holywell-street, are extremely annoyed by some remarks which we lately made on the
equipages in which they drive about Town. These flagrant examples of signally snobbish
taste, which used to render the bushy-mouthed, hooked-nosed blackguards who ride
about in them conspicuous, and attractive to verdant patients, now serve only to express their
infamy, and to make them as repulsive to those whom they seek to victimise—as they look.
This, doubtless, is what vexes them; exposure to mere odium and ridicule would, rather
lease them than not, if it failed to defeat their villainy: they might be hissed up, Regent
Street, but so long as they could chuckle and rub their hands over the fees which they take
at their own snug dens, they would care little enough for º: execration. Even as
sporting #. which some of them are, their feelings are not hurt by disparagement of their
horses and carriages, provided that does not tend to prevent them from cheating. What does
annoy them is, that denotation of their class, which causes every individual of it to be
recognised for the rascal he is, without affording him occasion for that revenge which he
might, if his name were published, hope to take, by the help of an attorney and a barrister
of his own species, and a jury of fools.
Latterly some of these fellows have re-modelled their advertisements, so as to place them
beyond the provisions of LoRD CAMPBELL’s Act; but, be it known to all whom it may con-
cern, that anybody who advertises a peculiar cure of any disease or complaint, no matter
what, is either not a member of the Medical Profession, or is regarded by that profession
as a disgrace to it. Whoever consults a Holywell quack will, most probably, have his
ailment very much aggravated, and will either . fleeced, or, if he does not choose to submit
to extortion, have his transactions with the quack, and his whole case, medical as well as
legal, published in the Nisi Prius reports. †. will not probably be published in those of
the County, Court, because the sum for which the quack will bring an action against his
patient will, most likely, much exceed fifty pounds.
THE PIPE OF CONTROWERSY.
In the window of a, tobacconist's shop, in Prince's Street, Soho, are exhibited'some
Fº pipes, to which is attached a card, with the following description thereupon:-
“The Controversy. Pipe, Dedicated to PROFEssoR SoLLY AND Co., INDERWICK, London.”
The Controversy of which this pipe appears to be a memorial, is that which was raging some
time ago on the question—“Is smoking injurious?” but such is the pipe's capacity, that
the name it bears might have been applied to it simply by reason of its suitableness for
controversial discussions: since, once, filled, it would outlast the longest argument ºn, the
subject of free-will, or even one of MR. GIADSTONE's parliamentary speeches on behalf of
canonical nonsense. When we call this pipe gigantic, we use that epithet in its applica-
bility rather to a large man of the DANIEL LAMBERT type than to Gög; for the pipe is, in
fact, of the class called short; though its bulk is vast. It would have served admirably for
the use of the biggest of all the giants that Jack, the killer of them, ever slew; and might
have been the very identical pipe formed expressly for the capacious mouth of Polyphemus:
who could have sat upon a mountain, blowing thunderclouds with it, or smoking like Etna.
THE SHOPMAN'S ADIEU TO THE
LADIES.
TUNE—“The girls we left behind us.”
FAREWELL, sweet ladies; we shall now
No longer have the pleasure
Of serving you with scrape and bow,
hilst wielding wand and measure.
The cruel Indian mutineers
More fit employment find us;
And in our place, you’ll have, my dears,
The girls we leave behind us.
You, with their patience and their time,
Instead of ours, will trifle:
We go to India’s distant clime,
To point the Enfield rifle,
Instead of plying scissors' blades,
The task till now assigned us,
Which we relinquish to the maids,
The girls we leave behind us.
Up shop-steps we must cease to crawl,
And scale the walls of Delhi,
Which do contain what statesmen call
A genuine casus belli.
Against the cruel º bands
Our spirit has combined us,
Our old work left to fitter hands,
The girls we leave behind us.
We go, a full revenge to take
For every British martyr,
For which that we our thirst may slake,
We’ll give no black beast quarter.
Unless to hang him by the neck,
To make the others mind us;
But ask, for muslin, chintz, or check,
The girls we leave behind us.
Our charge we purpose and intend
To make extremely heavy,
Our bayonets we can recommend
Against the blackguards’ º
We’ll put the goods in low or high,
As dº. the means may find us;
But seek, if poplins you would buy,
The girls we leave behind us.
With “Any other article?”
Inquiry thrust succeeding,
We º on shopmen’s principle,
Address each tiger bleeding;
Those words, wherewith our wares to press,
The Shop's traditions bind us,
None now will speak to you—unless
The girls we leave behind us.
THE RECRUITING OFFICER'S
ASSISTANT.
It is a mistake on the part of. Recruiting
Sergeants, if they want to enlist linendrapers'
shopmen, to go about with ribbons in their caps.
Those young men are, like old birds, not to
caught with chaff. They have had too much of
ribbons already—are sick of them—and ribbons
ought to be kept out of their sight, save and
except the ribbon of the Garter-provided that
courage, conduct, and military skill could possibly
enable a respectable drapers' assistant to jump
over the counter to glory, and then skip up to
a pension and a peerage. The Recruiting Ser-
geant might have some chance with the shop-
man, if the shopman had any chance of ex-
changing his yard-measure for a field marshal's
truncheon.

MARRIAGE BY ADVERTISEMENT.
CARBOROUGH.—
MARRIED,-Onthe 19th
º in the
columns of the Scar-
borough Times, MR. Ro-
BERT RoxBY, the light
comedian of several
Lyceum farces, and at
present stage-manager
of the Drury Lane
Lady, whose name is
unknown. The Editor
of the above unintelli-
gent paper was the
only person, who wit-
nessed the mysterious
union. After the in-
visible ceremony, the
_*, unconscious couple re-
paired to the Theatre
Royal, Scarborough,
where they were oblig-
ing enough to perform,
in the ‘The Follies of a
Night, and other pieces
very much to the sa:
tisfaction of a crowded
audience.”
To explain the
above marriage, we
must state that the
Scarborough Times
has been giving to
MR. Robert Rox-
By, quite unknown
to him, , a wife.
After telling the
public that “MRs. Rob ERT RoxRy terminated a most successful engage-
ment on Wednesday last,” it descends into particulars by informing
its “Weekly List of Visitors” that “the part of Miami, sustained by
this lady, deserves the highest commendation.” - -
We have heard of newspapers presenting their subscribers with
portraits, medals, globes, and atlases; but for a journal to give away
a wife is quite a new feature. Doubtlessly it will next venture on
the presentation of a family Unless a full stop is * to their
liberality, MR. R. R. may suddenly find himself the father of ten
children, before he was even aware that he had any reason in this
world to be contented with such a happy lot? -
However, we are informed that MR. Robert RoxRy is not so very
well pleased with this editorial gift. He contends—and with justice on
his side, we think—that the report is likely to do him a serious injury
in his matrimonial engagements. He demands an instant separation
from his wife, or else threatens an action against the º
for giving circulation to malicious rumours. The damages are laid
at £50,000.

If you wish to propose, do it in person. Never make a proposal in
writing. Your letter gives the lady time to “turn it over,” and to
look at the question you are “popping” to her on all sides. Besides, it
is wrong to suppose that women can be taken, as London omnibuses
are, “by correspondence.”

* WRITE ABOUT FACE.”
THE soldier's face is never safe. He never can tell whether his
moustaches will be his for two months together. At one time, he is
ordered to shave; at another, down comes an order to trim his whiskers
to a certain length, and not a hair's-breadth further. Then, arrives a
war, and the soldier is allowed to stalk about with a beard as big as
Bushy Heath. All razors have a furlough during such time as the
army is busily engaged in lathering the enemy. e brush once over,
the beards are cut down, like many other things, when the Service is
ut on a peace establishment. Here, at present, is the last tonsorial
edict from the Horse Guards:—
“The Commander-in-Chief has ordered that'every soldier is to wear a Moustache.”
This is all very well, and we agree with the ladies, who are generally
of opinion that the moustache is a great ornament, without which no
military pair of lips is complete. But how about those faces that are
completely innocent of stubble? It is a painful matter of fact, that
under some noses, martial or otherwise, the moustache obstimately
refuses to grow. No amount of persuasion, or Kalydor, will induce the
rebellious hair, to sprout.” In many instances, the rubbing of the cat's
tail even has lost its customary powers of inducement, as though the
cat was determined to prove that in no instance was it friendly to the
skin of the soldier. , What, then, are such soldiers to do? Will they
be punished for disobeying orders, or will a mandate like the following
rush from the Horse Guards to their relief?—
“All those soldiers, to whom Nature has unkindly denied the natural adornment
of a Moustache, are horeby ordered by the Commander-in-Chief to wear false ones."

RAZZIA. ON THE RATS. NEW CHURNING PROCESS.
ALTHOUGH the wild sports of the season are chiefly practised in the
country, persons who are unfortunately compelled to reside in London
have occasionally a sporting treat, which refreshes them, and enables
them the better to endure their metropolitan penance. Of this kind
was a capital Rat-hunt which took place last week in Holywell Street.
A party of sportsmen had determined on routing out a colony of Rats
which have '. infested that neighbourhood. This process has for
many years been desired, but certain parochial authorities, who have
control in the district, have always pretended that the thing was
impossible. The Rats are of a peculiarly offensive kind; and are, in
fact, the most odious vermin in the Metropolis. They are, like Rats
in general, especially mischievous to the young, and wherever they
locate, they poison the vicinity. Some of them are British, others are
the A. of Palestine rats, but the garbage by which they live is
equally abominable and pestiferous. They are very wily, and used only
to be seen at night, but the conduct of the parochials emboldened the
beasts, and they have of late pursued their prey in broad day-light. A
Razzia on the Rats was determined upon, and a large field of sports-
men, in blue, surrounded, the º
detective species were sent in. The scene that ensued baffles descrip-|milk, in consequence

and mercilessly trapped. The take was very large, and the beasts were

are not removed, and we trust their persecutors will persevere until TRIo.—My Lady the Countess.-CIMARosa,

the poor simple fellow had given up all hopes of
ever seeing his money again. As may
readily surmised, the gentleman lost notime in
whipping the amount—not, one penny of which
had been disturbed—into his pocket, and, unob-
served by a single, person, leisurely decamped.
However, he did not omit, either in the excess of
his honesty, or malice, to leave the original shares
behind him, and there, probably, they stillare, for
the benefit of anyone who chooses topickthem up.

THE HUMILIATION INDEMNITY FUND.
WE have much pleasure in being enabled to state that a numerously
attended meeting of serious persons of the superior classes was held on
Tuesday last at i. Hall, with the truly laudable and pious object
of collecting funds for affording compensation to workpeople, and other
industrious persons, dependent upon wages, and compelled to lose one
whole day's pay, through, the appointment of Wednesday as a day of
Fast and Humiliation. The Chair was taken by the EARL of BLOOMs-
BURY, and on the platform were observed the BISHOP OF BELGRAVIA,
and LoRD TYBURN, with others of the nobility, gentry, and º
The ChaiBMAN, after having briefly stated the purpose of the
meeting, said that the Humiliation which would deprive the lower
classes of a day's wages, would be humiliating indeed to the better
orders at whose desire, Humiliation Days were appointed. Whilst it
placed them in a most humiliating position, it took from their humili-
ation every,particle of Imerit, or rather rendered what should, be
devout humiliation, hypocritical baseness.
LoRp.TYBURN rose to propose a resolution calculated to carry out
the end in view. A national fast was a good thing for those who were
in a condition to fast—namely in good condition—havingº to eat
and drink. To call upon the hungry to fast was ridiculous—it was
converting a fast into a farce. Those who demanded a fast day ought
to pay for it, and demonstrate their penitence and contrition at their
own expense, and not at that of their i. neighbours. The noble
lord moved that a Committee be appointed to receive subscriptions for
the purpose of - -
indemnifying industrious individuals necessarily
deprived of a day’s yº through the suspension of business occa-
; º the General (Humiliation and #. of Wednesday the
InSt.
The BISHop of BELGRAVIA had much pleasure in seconding the
motion. Humiliation and Fasting involved sacrifice; but what sort of
a sacrifice was that when the sacrificers were those who rejoiced in
wealth and affluence, and the thing sacrificed was the hire of the needy
labourer? Did they who were blest with independent property, and
many of whom were rolling in superfluous riches, imagine that they
should make an acceptable offering out of poor workmen's wages?
And what would all their enemies say—especially those who hated
them to the death for their opposition to the pernicious errors of
Rome? Let them only consider what painful remarks the Univers
and the Tablet would be sure to make on the subject. If the working
classes were not compensated for the wages which they would lose by
the Humiliation Day, those who inflicted that loss upon them would
do º; that would be very similar to devouring the houses of
widows; and the pretence of making long prayers would only complete
the ſºlute. He hoped he need not follow out the comparison
Suggested.
i. Right Reverend Prelate was followed by
SIR John BULLION, Bart., who said that a poor man could not
afford to fast. Instead of taking away his wages, those who desired
him to fast, ought to supply him with the means of purchasing salt
fish and egg-sauce for that purpose. They might humiliate themselves
by being guilty of shamefully mean conduct : but he did not see any
religion in that. The humiliation of the rich by the impoverishment
of the poor might be summarily described. Humiliation was too long
a word for it—to express it #º, subtract all the letters of that
word but the three first. If they could not, humiliate themselves
without punishing the poor, they had better let humiliation alone: for
such humiliation, as they might expect to find, was worse than no
humiliation at all.
Thanks were then voted to the Chairman, and the meeting separated,
after £10,000 had been subscribed on the spot.

SIR,
“I see that GENERAL HAVELOCK has received' a Good
Service Pension of £100 a year. Of course this will come out of the
public money, and will tend to lessen the fund which is available for
ranting proper allowances to those to whom they are justly due.
fficers enter the Army under certain conditions; they receive so
much for their duties, and the understanding is, that for the consider-
ation stated, they are to do their duties as well as possible. For ful-
filling their agreement I see no reason why they should receive more
than they bargained for. Let them have as much honour as you like,
for that costs the public nothing. Honour is the º r recompense
for hardships endured, wounds received, and limbs lost; pecuniary
compensation should be reserved for those to whom honour is no object
but who appreciate money, and are capable of enjoying it in peace and
comfort. GENERAL, HAVELock's pension is not a very large, one in
itself; but it would have formed a pleasant little addition to the com-
pensation allotted to, Sir, your hardly-treated and poorly-requited
public servant,

THE FAIRY GOD MOTHER OUTDONE.
* WE extract the following impudent
A advertisement from a Scarborough
A newspaper. We think it fairly puts
the extinguisher upon all previous
attempts at imposition:—
JUST PUBLISHED, and sent post free on receipt
of 14 Stamps,
PERSONAL BEAUTY, by a SURGEoN,
Containing Simple and Concise Directions
for imparting to the Skin a velvety softness;
to the Teeth a pearly whiteness; to the Hair
a glossy luxuriance; to the Eye a matural bril-
liancy; to the Breath a fragrant sweetness,
and to the Hand a snowy whiteness.
There, for little more than a shilling,
are more gifts promised than a fairy
godmother ever dropped into the cradle
there are fools who put faith in such
advertisements, or else you would not
have tradesmen investing their money
in setting traps like the above to catch
them. The trap is so open that the
wonder is, that any fool can be found
short-sighted enough to drop into it. Scarborough must be full
of fools, for the newspapers are crowded, with similar insults
to common sense. . It is a pity that the “Surgeon” does, not
endorse the lies with the authority of his name. It would have
iven us great pleasure to have drawn the attention of the College of
urgeons to it. Doubtlessly it is some bathing wºman, wh9 is amusing
herself by laughing in her blue sleeves at the tº: of the “Scar-
borough Fawkes.” For ourselves we should have great doubts as to
the quality of the “velvet” that could be procured for fourteenpence,
though there could not be a second opinion as to the “softness” of the
customer who could lend himself to the absurdity of obtaining any such
cuticular raiment. As for the “pearly whiteness,” we are thunder-
struck with the liberality of the “Surgeon,” who flings away his pearls
at such an incredulously low price.
We have drunk Purl just as often as CLEOPATRA, whom we look
upon in history as the original Mother-o'-Purl; we have repeatedly
stopped to quench our thirst at the “purling stream.; ” but we cannot
say that we ever found our teeth any the whiter for the refreshing
draught. Such pearls are too easily seen through for our money. By
the bye, what a faultless Adonis this same anonymous “Surgeon” must
be, if he only tries the above specifics on himself! What yards of
welvet must encompass his soft frame! What teeth, to light up the
streets, better than gas, on a dark night! What luxuriant hair to give
away in ringlets to i. enamoured patients' What an eye for a fee!
What fragrant breath to inquire delicately into the state of a love-sick
maiden's health, and what a snowy white hand to feel her throbbing
pulse! By St. D'QRSAY, by the gold eyeglass of VERNoN SMITH, by
the broad-brimmed hat of BARON, NATHAN, we wonder how this
Admirable Crichton of a “Surgeon” can walk the streets, without
being torn by the admiring ladies into a thousand little bits! The
mystery is at once explained why the sly dog hides his name. It is
the necessity of safety, alas ! that compels the incongruity.
'A CONTRIBUTOR IN A FIX.
“MY DEAR SIR, “Sea-side, September.
“You complain that I am remiss in my duties. You say:
‘For the last three weeks I have not received a line from you; I am
rather surprised at this conduct, for you are paid so well that you
really are in the flesh at the sea-side, whereas many of your brethren
are there, as poets are in the moon; either you must change your
course, or —”
… Why that fierce and cruel “or, my dear Punch * That’s all I
complain of; it’s like a Saracen's Head on a pleasant hostelry, or a
ºn on a Chinese shield. -
“The fact is, I have quartered my armies so long upon that fertile
country which lies under your contributor’s hat, that it is bare as an
ensign’s cheek, or a recruit’s head—‘yea, from Dan to '-but no, I
will not use that saying, I am merciful.
“Now, what am I to do? I look out of window, and there is the
shining sea; if I go there I shall be taken up for poaching, for that
preserve belongs to those squires, the poets who strum upon the Harp
of the North.
“I look upon the heavens—they are theirs also; and I must say
they use their subjects up there most despotically; they have made
Sun, and moon, and stars cut the most ridiculous capers—in fact,
lowered them so, that a blue-light begins to look upon himself as
of one of her pet protégés'. We suppose ||
somebody. I’ll let the stars pass, but I beg to protest against the
treatment of the sun and moon, the latter in particular, for she is
elderly, and ankles and wisdom grow bigger with years, as wineskins
and aldermen grow bigger the more you pour into them; ankles, my
dear Sir, aged forty ; upwards should be treated like the faces of
Turkish women—in fact, they should be supposed by man to be
extinct, like the Dodo.
“Well as I am shut out from the sea and heavens I’ll turn to earth,
and woman is all the earth to me. Alas! I look out of my window,
and that conquering Caesar, the young ADOLPHUs, has conquered her.
That man, Sir, is a dovecote, which all her soft sweet smiles inhabit;
he is a grove, where her musical words dwell and sing; he is an isle of
the Southern Ocean, where her bright glances play for ever; oh heaven!
he is a Paradise, where are those kisses all, all divine; and, in short, he
is a humbug. I am in a fix, Mr. Punch, like NAPOLEoN at St. Helena—
by the bye I should have begun a fresh paragraph, as I have brought
in NAPOLEON, but never mind.
“I have come to the resolution of killing myself, but as I am in doubt
as to the best way of doing it, I’ll wait till I receive your advice on
that point; though I think that if I fell upon my steel pen, as Cato
ell upon his sword, it would be most in keeping; but, as I said, I’ll
wait for your advice, which shall be implicitly followed.”
A WORD FROM A WIFE'S MOTHER.
MR. PUNCH has received a very elegantly written and very artful
letter from a lady who states herself to be a Wife's Mother, and who
complains of the sarcasms which she says Mr. Punch and the other
Great Writers of the day occasionally discharge against the Mother.
in-Law. Our correspondent wishes “a kind word” said for that
individual.
Humph!
Well, what sort of a case does the complainant make out?
She says that, “when a young gentleman is making love to a youn
lady, he endeavours to please the other members of her family,” an
“may #.". have a kindly feeling towards the girl’s Mamma, whose
good offices he tries to enlist in his favour.” He could not be often
asked to a house “if he did not conciliate the mistress thereof.” Then
the Mamma believing that he likes her, proceeds, after marriage to act
on that conviction, and is cruelly undeceived, and so forth.
Nothing short of a Mother-in-Law’s assurance could have drawn
such a picture as this. When do young gentlemen make love to young
ladies? When, indeed, is it necessary for a young gentleman, if he be
a degently eligible party, to do so?...Does he not find the love made for
him Tries to enlist the good offices of Mamma! Has a mouse to
enlist the good offices of Puss to hold open the door of the trap * Not
be asked unless he conciliates the mistress | Why Madam, you
know perfectly well that if you want CHARLEs, or AUGUSTU's,
or FELIX for your son-in-law, you won't be offended with him, let him
do what heikes if he breaks your favourite decanter, it was only an
accident (MARY ANN BRowN was turned into the street without a
character for cracking its fellow in washing it); if he comes to your
party in a high state of after-dinnerishness, it is only his high spirits;
and if he is downright rude to your friends, it is the manly frankness of
his character, which you admire more than specious and hypocritical
refinement. Don't talk to us about conciliation; haven’t we been
married, Madam? We were a good match; and one day we sat down
on Judy's Mamma's pet lap-dog, and extinguished the same ; and the
old lady shook the feather in her old red turban, and said, smilingly,
that everything must die some time or another. She has hitherto
culpably and carefully abstained from fulfilling the prediction in her
own case, though; but that is neither here northere.
And then our correspondent complains that after marriage the
Mother-in-Law must not call too often; must weigh her words, lest
they be misinterpreted; and must not give the “young creature” (this
means the triumphant bride) advice, though other relatives near may
do as they like without comment.
May they By Jove' ... We don’t know what you call comment,
Madam; but we know what Mrs. Punch's long-legged cousin in the
Bombay Marines thought when we expounded to him that he was not
to come drinking our brandy-pawnee more than four nights in a week,
or ever in our absence. And a comment which we imparted to Judy's
uncle BILL, upon that respected relative's habit of calling after we had
left for business, borrowing the household cash, and “advising” Mrs.
Punch how to run up bills, threw that affectionate uncle into such a
fury that we almost hoped never to see him any more; but he ulti-
mately cried into a yellow silk handkerchief and asked us for a sove-
reign. So that even if we do object to our wife's Mother being
Vicereine over our wife, we have equal objection to any other form of
mixed government.
Qur correspondent then introduces, very cunningly, a pretty picture
of her own daughters. One is married, and in a distant region.
After is “a dear, good girl,” with “a warm and affectionate heart,”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
It is of no use, dear Madam, We are married. So are all our young
men, except one, and he squints, and is engaged, Polly is a sweetly
pretty name, and there has been a time when, on the hint in your letter,
we should have mounted our gallant steed, and ridden away to have
a look at her. But those days are over. You cleverly allude to one
HARRY Jon Es, as attached to her. So, you have caught HARRY JONES,
have you? Then be satisfied.
We have some motion that you are a very good Mother-in-Law. That
you watch anxiously over your child's happiness, as you cannot and
ought not to help doing, but don't have a permanent watch-box in her
husband's house. That you recollect that your child and her husband
are one, and that if he is made uncomfortable, she will suffer also.
That you are rather grateful to him for having taken your angel under
his care, and entered into bonds to society and the law to provide for
her to the end of her days. That . always set his conduct in the
best light before her, and never tell her anything that you may hear, or
imagine, against him. That you give her motherly º rational advice
about her children, without establishing yourself as Governess-General.
That you never contrast the behaviour of one of your sons-in-law with
that of the other, and make MARIA sulky with her husband because
FANNY has (according to * promised a new moire antique while
| MARIA’s husband can’t see that that silk has been worn often enough.
That you don’t use MARIA’s influence upon her husband to get him
to accept bills for your son by your first marriage, or to be your
wine-merchant and small-coaling brother's security to an assurance
society. That, in short, you are an admirable woman, and one of whom
(to say nothing of your still handsome face) a son-in-law is as proud as
a man ought to be of any feminine connection.
You are all this, Madam. So are many thousands of Mothers-in-
Law (we have been told), and that those who are not may reform
themselves into the likeness of those who are, Mr. Punch occasionally
administers salutary hints and advice. Are you answered, Madam?
Was a Wife’s Mother ever answered?
DOUBTFUL BENEFIT OF CLERGY.
O READERs of the Record
and similarly biassed
prints, it is no uncom-
mon thing to see a cook
or housemaid advertise
herself as being “truly
pious,” which epithet is
classed with her com-
mendatory qualities, her
knowledge of made dishes
or proficiency in needle-
work. This sort of kit-
chen stuff must be in de-
mand with some people,
or there would soon cease
to be provided a .
of it. Servants, no doubt,
find it answer to prefix
themselves as pious, or
they would most probably
not pay for space to do so.
Whatever be our own
opinion on the subject,
that adjective may prove
of serious advantage to
them in applying for a
situation in a Serious
Family.
- - It is only by a some-
what similar assumption that we are able to explain the following
advertisement, which, merely altering the last i. letters of the
name, we quote in its entirety from a sea-side paper:-

MOTHERS AND FATHERS WHO WISH TO HAVF.
PURE CHOM E MADE B READ

a Clergyman and family to
CADGER'S, 145, LOW STREET,
NEAR THE OLD POST OFFICE.
Now, with all respect and reverence for the uses of the Church, we
cannot see what use it can be to the ...}} know what bakers’
bread a Clergyman affects—and it puzzles us to think why a Clergyman's
approval should be deemed of so much worth in so unclerical a matter.
The Clergy, it is true, are reputed to look sharply out for loaves and
hes, but we cannot assume therefore that their judgment of “pure
home-made bread” is superior to other people's indeed we should
ourselves put much more faith in the opinion of a chemist or physician.
A Clergyman, we grant, may be a connoisseur of crust in port, and the
crustiness of loaves may also come within his knowledge: but of their
make and, freedom from adulteration, he can be no better judge by
virtue of his calling. It may be in his profession to examine and to
analyse the . of motives, but he can pretend to no more insight
into that of brea than had he remained a member of the laity.
But, however much itſº us to guess the reason why a Clergyman
should so prominently figure in a baker's advertisement, it is a still
greater bewilderment to find his family dragged in as referees also.
We might almost think from this, that so little weight attaches to the
Clergyman's opinion that additional testimony is deemed requisite to
back it. Or are we to infer, that the family act merely as deputy
respondents, and that when the Clergyman is absent one of them is
always in the way to answer questions? We are much too lazy now
tº try to solve this problem, and indeed it would be quite a waste of
idle time to do so. But without much deep reflection, we may see,
however pure this home-made bread may be, so reverend a reference is
quite as pure a puff: and the benefit of clergy in such a case as this,
to use the mildest adjective, we must consider doubtful.
THE ULTRAMONTANE AGAINST ENGLAND.
To HIs FéTICHE.
A Bigot, kneeling to a doll, cut angles on his breast,
And he prayed against Old Eiji whom the Roman priests detest,
An object sad he was to see for any Christian souls,
With his sinister and scowling eyes, and his sallow lantern joles.
“How long,” the shaven devotee the painted doll besought,
“Ere England's power and greatness shall to nothingness be brought?
Qh! when shall dogged courage her possessions fail to save?
When shall her now triumphant fleets be swept from every wave?
“Shall she survive this Indian blow, and rise again once more,
As we, alas ! have seen her do so many times before
According to her boastful strain, the Saints which should provoke,
More dreadful to her enemies for every foreign stroke.
“How long ere we shall point to her, and say: Lo! where she lies,
Who dared resist the Holy See, and Rome 's decrees despise.}
Till then, except us faithful, who with flowers will deck thy shrine,
And bend the º: before thee, and acknowledge thee divine :
“How soon, were England's sun set, would the pious night return,
Which to illuminate we should our holy tapers burn!
The baleful rays of Knowledge would be soon extinguished quite,
Then Faith, once more, again on Earth would shed the only light.
“The old world's glory underwent a long and deep eclipse,
When all that any one was taught proceeded from our lips;
Why should not modern science—that to witchcraft is akin–
Decline and die like classic lore, alike the birth of sin?
“The sun will then move round the earth as it was wont of yore,
Antipodes will scandalize the faithful soul no more;
And Heaven will be above the vault of blue, o'erhanging wide,
With none but those who worship thee-upon the other side.
“No longer, then, the iron horse will fly with wings of steam,
Presumption's ſº wire will then have vanished like a dream;
True miracles will these succeed; and Saints, secure from jokes,
(S.
Will shine by night and oceans cross upon their sacred ..
“But, ah! while England holds her own, a beacon to mankind,
Wile heresy will rear its head, refusing to be blind
In order by our priestly aid that it may learn to see,
And tell its beads and sing its hymns, and say its prayers to thee.
“Oh expedite the happy hour when man shall cease to think, .
And all confess that thou canst nod, and own that thou canst wink,
But this will never come to pass while England’s hale and strong;
How long ere she shall perish then, adorable, how long?”

something more than that. Out of 33

“LITTLE GIRLS COME OUT TO PLAY.”
“The (Pianoforte) play's the thing.”
We extract the following Hints from a newspaper, called The
Englishwoman's Review:
1st. When asked to play, you must comply at once; for, says this
rare specimen of an Englishwoman:—
“One apology such as this—'I will readily comply with your wishes, but I must
claim your extremest indulgence,” is worth more than a bushel of those stereotyped
excuses, which affected young ladies are always well supplied with.”
The advice is good, and we admire the quiet slap in the face that is
administered to “affected young ladies; ” but we are not quite sure
whether the young lady, who, upon being led up to the pianoforte was
to say: “I will readily comply with your wishes, but I must claim your
extremestindulgence,” would not be rather open to the charge of affecta-
tion herself. We are afraid that some satirical Miss would call her
“pretentious,” and report her to her giggling young friends as “an
ected upstart of a blue-stocking, that had just made her escape
from some Minerva Hall in the neighbourhood of Turnham Green.”
2nd. The second piece of advice is:—
“If you sing, do so without grimaces.”
Our #ſºft informs us that this is not so easy as, at the first
blush of the thing, it would appear; for—
“Many of our greatest, or at any rate, most popular singers, pull shocking faces
while charming the spell-bound audiences with their silvery tones.”
It is a pity that the names of these popular singers have not been
mentioned. Perhaps, it is MR. Cowell, or MR. Ross, or MESSRs.
WRIGHT and BEDFoRD, when those, two comic twins (those local
'A8eapol) are singing together in a burlesque :
3. To guard against these grimaces, young ladies, you are recom-
mended to—
“Put a looking-glass before you, when you are singing at home, and you will
scarce credit that that smiling dimpled face could ever have looked so crabbed.”
We do not disapprove of this holding the mirror up to nature, if the
play of the features is improved by it; though, on reflection, we think
a young GAssie R, who was intent upon watching her beautiful image
in the glass before her, would, as she was warbling “Portrait Char.
mant,” be apt to pay more, attention to the expression of the mouth
than to the expression of the music or the words.
4. Here is an invaluable bit of advice:—
| “Enunciate as you would in speaking, being careful topout out the lips for o's and
oo's, tº have a mouth in a smiling position for ah's, and teeth properly closed for
e's and all such closed tones.”
Nothing is said, in the above instructions, about the management of
the nose. The fair pupil is left completely in the dark as to whether
she is to compress or ãº her nostrils, or, in fact, what she is to do
with them. Yet the practice of singing through the nose is by no
means uncommon in society. We notice, also, that the i's are left out
in the above list of vowels, and likewise that no recognition has been
taken of u. Why should u and i be insidiously slighted, we should
like to know?
5. We are somewhat startled out of our propriety by the subjoined —
“Do not breathe audibly, nor imitate the duck in the storm, by turning up the
white of your eyes.”
This strikes us as strange language to be addressed to ladies in a
ladies’ newspaper.
; 6. However, we agree thoroughly with the good sense displayed in
the following hint:—
“If you have the slightest cold, cease your daily practice.”
7, But we are doomed to be shocked again the very next minute by
such a startling suggestion as–
“If you wish to rid yourself of a hoarseness, take a little rum with the drippings
from bacon in it (infallible), and talk very little.”
| The rum and the bacon are too much for us. We feel inclined to call
out with GEORGE THE FOURTH for “HARRIs, a glass of brandy' only
our servant's name happens to be OXER, and not HARRIs. Still, the
shock to our nervous system has been so great, that, though we are
talking to young ladies, we must have the brandy. “Here, Ox BR,
two glasses of brandy!” . As for the precept about “talking very
little,” we should think it belonged to that class of things that are re-
puted to be much “more easily said than done.”
We have reached the climax of absurdity. After the rum and bacon
all the other elaborate instructions to young ladies only taste insipid.
However, we subjoin a few curiosities, by way of bonbons after the
dessert.
8. When you are playing, you must
“Sit gracefully, but not stiftly: sufficiently high to allow your fore-arm to incline
downwards from the elbow to the keys. Keep your hands in a rounded position
from the wrist, and never let your thumb fall below the key-board.”
We are astonished that our Englishwoman has omitted to lay down the
rule that you must not attempt to touch the notes with your elbows,
Or . knees, or your feet, or your nose, or your head, in vainly
en fºrms to imitate the gymnastical performances of THALBERG,
or LISTZ.
9. Young ladies are sternly admonished to
“Be careful to sit with an erect back, as round-shouldered players are by no
In calls ulicoidinoll.
... We are very sorry to hear it. In the choice of your instrument, and
in the sº of your playing it, young ladies, let everything be as square
as possible.
We should be very sorry to live next door to this refined English-
woman, for she informs us that yesterday “she practised ten hours.”
Merciful powers! what a blessing a neighbour like that must be in a
new lath and plaster house with brown paper divisions ! To her pupils,
however, she is more merciſul, for she is considerate enough to say:-
“Three or four hours most masters advise as the daily amount of work at the
piano ; but I find it an excellent plan to play till Nature tells me to stop.”
We should, think four hours more than ample. At all events, we
should not like to be condemned to live under the same roof as the
young lady who practised four hours a-day. ...We would as soon think
of taking lodgings over DISTIN’s shop. If “all work and no play
makes JACK a dull boy,” we are confident that all play (at the piano-
forte) and no work (at anything else) would succeed in making JENNY
a remarkably stupid girl. How many a sensible girl has completely
lost her head at The Battle of Prague/
THE ALDERMANIC SQUABBLE.
SAYs Crockery to Tallow
“You’re an impident fallow,”
Says Tallow to Crockery,
‘I won’t stand your mockery.”
Says Punch; “Both on wrong keys,
Shut up, you two Donkeys.”
OURSELF IN A RAGE.
We can't stand this, and if the EMPEROR NAPOLEoN can, we shall
take up the quarrel on our own account. We mean, (perhaps we are
in too great a rage to be coherent, but somebody shall understand us
in time, we engage) we mean the behaviour of MARIA of Petersburg
to our beloved EUGENIE of Paris. It is proper that the matter
should be understood. Old Nicholas of Russia, now abated, made a
point of insulting Louis NAPOLEoN, and refusing to recognise him as
one of the family of Sovereigns; if that ji. an insult, or as if
Corsican blood is not as good, at least, as Cossack. But Russia
having been exceeding well thrashed—by the said L. N., with the aid
of Q. W. and another or so, the successors to the abated Nicholas
deemed it as well to make a sort of surly atonement for the old one’s
insolence. First, Grand Duke, CoNSTANTINE was sent to Paris, and
º he is a coarse kind of Cub, whose rudeness to all whom he
dared to annoy disgusted the French Court and People, still Nick's
son had made the first call on, Louis NAPOLEON. Then, a meeting
of the Emperors was arranged, and ALEXANDER was to come to
Darmstadt, and take home #. wife, MARIA, who had been staying
with her friends.
Well, it was settled that the EMPREss EugéNIE should come to
Stuttgardt, with her husband, and this being understood, MARIA inti.
mated that she should not come. She did not want to meet the
EMPRESS. Against this we have nothing to say—she knew how the
beautiful Spanish lady would eclipse her, both in looks and fascination,
and every woman has a right to protect herself. The husbands meet
at Stuttgardt, but EUGENIE does not go. As soon as MARIA finds this
out, she unexpectedly comes over, bolts into the Congress, and makes
herself exceeding busy. Her excuse is, according to the Times, that
ALEXANDER is such a muſt that the sagacious L. N. would have turned
him round his finger but for his wife; and this is very likely true; but
she knew his folly before, and could have arranged accordingly. The
fact is, that she wanted to insult the EMPRESS EUGENIE, who, happily for
herself, is not of Royal blood, and she has done it like an ill-bred female
Cossack. We own to being in a rage, and to using strong language
for EUGENIE is a great pet of ours (we have shown it in many beautif
pictures and otherwise), and the man or woman who insults i. insults
us. We are only waiting to know what Louis NApoleon means to
do; because if he exacts no reparation, we shall ourself declare war
upon the Court of Russia. The man who would refuse to stretch forth
his hand when a lovely Empress is insulted, is unworthy of the
name of

WHO’S TO BLAME P
OR PASSAGES FROM THE LIFE OF A LOCOMOTIVE.
THERE was once upon a time an old locomotive.
She had been a first-rate piece of engine-building in her day. Old
GeoRGE STEPHENsoN, when he turned her out of his yard at New-
castle—it was before they brought out that long-bodied, herring-gutted,
racing style of locomotive that now flashes its express-train, along at
sixty miles an hour, and occasionally jumps down an embankment, or
over a viaduct, it’s so light and lively—Old GEORGE clapped her on
the breech of her ºf cobby boiler, with his own honest hand, as
the mechanics ran her down, and cried: “Thou's a bonny thing; that
thou is 1° And on the spot he christened her The Blazer.
Old GEORGE had an eye for a locomotive.
The Blazer was a bonny thing.
For years she did her work on the Stockton and Darlington line,—

have quadrupled the pace, and brought the dividend down to one per
cent. by this time. "Well, The Blazer worked between dull Dar-
lington and ship-yardy Stockton, for many a year, till the gloss was
worn off her paint, and her iron and brass-work began to look weather-
beaten. But her boiler was made of right good stuff. Flaws were
rare in Old GEORGE’s plates; and his rivets were good-holding ones,
and well clenched. hatever part of The Blazer, might want the
doctor, her boiler was all ºld. So she puffed, andſ panted, and
wheezed, and snorted, and ran her quiet, happy youth out, on that
primitive line, till railways had grown, and stretched their iron arms
over the whole island. One day The Blazer, now a steady, middle-
aged locomotive, was transferred, with some other part of the rolling
stock which the makers could spare, and had a customer for (on highly
remunerative terms), to one of the dashing, new Midland lines, got up
on the Hudson high-pressure system of, “a short life and a merry
one.”
They took it out of their servants and stock, the better to take in
the public. Every pointsman, and signal-man, and station-master,
had three men's business to attend to, and every locomotive had to
work double tides; on half allowances of care, oil, and overhauling.
“Making things pleasant” was the motto of this º: and every-
º" i. comfort of servants, the interest of shareholders, the safety
of passengers—was risked recklessly for the purpose of swelling divi-
dends till they couldn't be swelled any more, and collapsed under the
crushing hands of hard fact. The poor old Blazer suffered with the
rest. Many and many a journey did the shaky old creature make,
when she ought to have been in hospital at the repairing-house. Many
a journey did she get through with the pleasant conviction that her
water-gauge was out of order, and her safety-valve useless. But work
she must, and the lower the bill her engineer had to show for repairs
at the year's end the better for him. Her boiler-plates were getting
remarkably thin now—oxidisation and deposits had done their work;
and here and there a rivet was getting º But there was no time
for overhauling her; and a new boiler, would have figured as a heavy
item under the head “repairs of rolling stock; ”... so on the Blazer
went, scaled plates, shaky rivets and all. At last it came. One fatal
journey the poor old thing had to take a heavier turn of duty than
ad ever been laid on her before. It was on an express train, started
to race the express of a rival line. By overworking every inch of
man, and every ounce of metal, it was, just possible to shorten the
lº, by a quarter of an hour. So the ". of an hour was to
e saved, of course, and when one of the Directors—a new-comer–
hinted at danger, he was most caustically reprimanded by the Chair-
man, and contemptuously put down by the Board.
Off went the lightning express at the heels of the old Blazer,
working at nobody knows how many pounds pressure to the square inch.
As might have been expected, “smash”, went one of her, worn-out
boiler-plates. The nearest carriages slacked their speed, the middle
ones were jammed up into the air by those behind them; three com-
partments went over the embankment: a score of people were killed
some hundreds maimed—the reporters were busy-inquests were held
—and verdicts were returned,
Against whom * - -
T Against the Blazer, or against the Directors, who allowed that
worn-out locomotive to be used?
What says CoMMON SENSE *
- Surely the poor old Blazer was not to blame. She had done her work
well while she could, and had lasted longer than ninety-nine locomo-
tives out of a hundred. But first, the man whose business it was to
see that engine kept in proper order—i.e., the engineer—had neglected
his business.
And, secondly, the man whose business it was to see that the man
whose business it was to see that engine, kept in proper order did his
º e., the superintendent of rolling stock—had neglected his
uSlness.
And, thirdly, the man whose business it was to see that the man
whose business it was to see that the man whose business it was, &c.,
&c., &c., -i. e., the Directors—had neglected their business.
In short, everyone was to blame but the Blazer. She broke down in
obedience to the laws of nature.
Well, will it be believed that the Directors, in solemn conclave had
the impudence to propose trying the poor old locomotive?
+ + + + +
There's another Company—on a much larger scale, which has met
with a similar catastrophe. An old locomotive, called the GENERAL
LLOYD, part of the stock of the East India Company, has lately broken
down near the Dinapore Station, at a most critical moment for the
safety of every passenger in charge of the Company.
There has been an awful smash; and—
The Directors talk of trying the poor, old locomotive—which it was
their duty to have had overhauled every journey, and which, if they had
done their duty, would have been quietly waiting in the yard to be
broken up for old iron, many a year ago. . . !

SACRIFICES TOO ALARMING.
RITING from Bond-

under the signature
of H. G. W., states
certain obvious rea-
sons why young men-

expected to be. The
sum of his commu-
nication is, that if
you are to get parties
into the Army from

you must render the
exchange worth their
while. Half-a-crown a-day, and, on passing a sufficient, but not too strict, exami-
nation, a commission guaranteed to the survivors, in a new Native, Regiment, are
his terms, which are certainly reasonable; and, if these are granted, he says, with
characteristic spirit and in language to match:—
“I am certain that in a few weeks, from the London drapers alone, a battalion of young men
eager to avenge the atrocities of NENA SAHIB AND Co. might be raised, to be called the First
Battalion of Volunteer Guards, or the Royal Counterjumpers.”
To ask a young man to throw up a salary from five to twenty times as much as the
pay of a soldier, in order to embrace a soldier’s life, with all its hardships and
dangers, and its poor look-out in the event of not being cut short; whereas, by
sticking to the shop he might in time become a Lord Mayor or a Member of
Parliament, is to call upon him to make a tremendous sacrifice not to be expected
even of a linendraper. “Allow me to tempt you,” is a phrase which the Recruiting
Sergeant ought to be enabled to address to the linendraper’s assistant with some
prospect of success if the temptation is permitted. Superior articles—of agreement

SoME advertising grocers of Leicester advertise “Tooth-

announcement of “Cough Cured in One Minute!” and
this again is followed up by the statement of “A Broken
Wase made whole in One Minute.” The above specifics
only teach us what a deal may be achieved in so small a
space of time as sixty seconds! We wonder these puffing
tea-dealers, who seem to sell, everything, from bacon to
blisters, do not prolong the list of their boasted, cures:
Why do they not advertise, “Bacon Cured in One Minute,”
“A Man's Bad Temper Cured in One Minute,” or “A
Woman's Broken Heart made whole in One Minute.” It
would not be a bad experiment to send La Traviata to
Leicester, to see whether her cough could be cured in the
time specified, and whether her broken frame could be
repaired as expeditiously as a broken vase.

BAGMEN FOR THE BATTLE-FIELD.
Why should not women serve women in drapers'-shops? To suppose
that there is no reason why they should not is a very great mistake.
Mark what girls invariably do when they pass one another in the
street. Observe their eyes. Askance, instantly glance those of each
to scan the dress of the other. This ocular movement, is almost in-
voluntary. The expression which, attends it may be that of jº.
or vexation, but is never that of admiration—never that with which the
reflection of a dress is viewed in the looking-glass. The feeling which
betrays itself in this look unfits a girl behind the counter to show off
drapery to one before it. It causes her to perform the task in a per-
functory manner; she cannot do it cordially: goes through it with a
rather repulsive coldness. She cannot, as an imaginative shopman
can, make rapturous eyes at the article, as viewed infancy on the person
of the fair customer. Moreover, she is unable to praise and recommend
it heartily; nor can she assist in a choice between different goods: for
ladies, as every man knows who has ever gone º with them,
even in choosing patterns for themselves, find much more difficulty than
they have in deciding between rival suitors. Besides, they generally
prefer the masculine opinion as to what most becomes them, to that of
their own sex. - -
No: but there is a department in the drapery line, and other lines
wherein men might very well be replaced by women—that of Commerci
Traveller. In this, girls would have to do not with other girls, but with
men; and their winning ways in regard to mankind might thus be exer-
cised to advantage. ATL, or Travelling Lady, would be worth a dozen
T.G's, or Travelling Gents, toany house that would commission her to pro-
cure orders. The only objection to the substitution of bagwomen for bag-
men that can be imagined is that which §. made by innkeepers;
for if Travelling Gents were superseded b velling Ladies, the com-
mercial-room would not pay so well as it ãº since few, if any, cigars
would be smoked in it, and much more tea would be drunk than
brandy-and-water. The female travellers, could easily learn to ride
across country, or drive a gig; and the displaced bagmen might transfer
themselves to the Light Cavalry.

THE appeal of the Times to the Ribbonmen of England, that they
should for once not mind their business, and should turn their hands
to serve the country rather than the counter, has elicited a glow of
* but patriotism, and more fire of indignation than of martial
Splºlº.
We grant it is the tendency of feminine pursuits in some measure to
unsex the masculine pursuer: but it is a libel on our countrywomen to
say the want of pluck the drapers have exhibited is in any way feminine,
although it be unmanly. There are few women just now who have not
wished that they were men, that they might act as the avengers of their
outraged sisterhood. But the “ º: men” who have been
writing to the lº are clearly uninfected by such vulgar spirit. As
business-men they take a mere commercial view of matters, and regard
enlistment only as a trading iſºlation, from which they are deterred
by their doubts if it will pay them.
But we have more than half, indeed we have at least nine-tenths of
a suspicion, that the letters which inclineus to the foregoing expres:
sions, although signed by the shopman, have been written by their
masters. It is said that drapers would lose custom by losing their
young men, and it is inferred that they are therefore anxious to dissuade
them from enlistment. The appeal, then, should be turned from the
counter to the counting-house. Drapers are accustomed to “Alarming
Sacrifices,” let them, if it prove so, now prepare to make one. Let
every haberdashing hero beat recruits from his assistants, and put down
his i. as a debt against his country. But we dispute the .
conclusion that he would thereby be a loser. At any rate, we think we
can prescribe him a preventive. If he fear that ladies will desert his
shop when only served by women, let him but post a placard that his
men have “GóNE to INDIA,” and our word for it, his trade will not fall
off in consequence.

BRITISH BRAHMINS AND BRITISH MERCHANTS.
MR. GoLIGHTLY TEAzLE, M.A. (Readers are requested to observe
the “M.A.” with proper reverence) has returned prematurely to his
chambers in the Temple, in consequence of the complicated aspect of
public affairs. The very first morning after his return he was unfor-
tunate enough to cut his distinguished chin from incautiously medi:
tating an article for the Saturday Review, while he was in the act of
shaving that elevated feature; and this accident, added to the bile
remaining in his system in consequence of the abridgment of his conti.
mental tour, is sufficient to account for his not being in the best of
pers.
As he crunches his dry toast with a menacing aspect, he looks over
his Times in search of a likely victim. The Times itself he has long
ago shown to be the merest waste paper. He has broken the heart of
its principal correspondent, who is supposed in consequence to have
retired into a monastery. He has lashed the novelists, he has slashed
the wits—for he himself is neither a wit nor a novelist—and he has
established to his own profound satisfaction, the superiority of critical
over creative intellect. According to his own statement, he was “sick
of seeing the honours of mind awarded to small jokers and washy senti-
wentalists,” and he has cured himself of his sickness by taking these
honours to himself; in virtue of the presumption, to which, of course,
we all assent, that a gentleman who can so cleverly ºf works of
art could do very much better himself, if he tried. G. T. being a
Master of Arts, has taken the benefit of this presumption, and has
spared himself the trial, at the same time considerately sparing his
readers; and now he is occupied in condemning the ungraduated, and
in whipping up the rest of creation for his Saturday syllabub. At the
present moment, it "#. that he wants a subject to operate upon in
connection with the Indian Mutiny, the only topic people are supposed
to care about just now ;...that is to say, he wants, to set his mark on
somebody and especially on somebody who least anticipates or
deserves it. -
A simple observer would account for, the smile on his features by
the obviousness of his target, and would only suppose him to be hesi-
tating between the Board of Control and the Court of Directors. But
TEAzle aspires to a place in the Circumlocution Office, and is prepared
to go through life “On HER MAJESTY's Service,” which makes him
particularly tolerant to the slips of officials, and anxious to keep
up what he designates “the prestige of official station.” The TEAZLE
and TITE, BARNACLE interests are so allied, that if any member
of either abuses the confidence of his º: if he blunders or breaks
down or jobs at the Treasury, or uses his knowledge for his bargains
on the Stock Exchange, if he loses his head or his temper, or an army,
or an empire, or the precious lives, and as precious prestige of his
countrymen, G.T. points attention in some ºther direction ike the
confederate in a § t at the cry of “Stop Thief!”. G.T. performed
this service for the authors of our Crimean disasters, and G. T. is
ready to perform it again, or as often as the TITE BARNAcLEs bring us
to grief, provided as how he can find a convenient scapegoat.

simply tº substitute a great feeding-ground of TITE BARNAcies for a
mercantile emporium. Our merchants have been hustled out of its
government, and have now no voice in its councils, and, what is worse,
no consideration from its servants. To the latter they stand in the
relation of Pariahs to Brahmins; they have been snubbed and
insulted, and now they are ruined.
The system which oppressed them, for their protection, has given
way, and the Indian Government, having reaped the consequences of
treating Hindoos as Britons, now tries to recover itself by treating
Britons like Hindoqs. These gentlemen are indispensable, but they
are quite ignored; their advice would have saved the catastrophe at
Dimapore, but it was rudely slighted. Their services were rejected
till it was found impossible to do without them.; and their press, a
most respectable press, is ignominiously Now, that their
maltreatment has reached to this extremity, they cry out; and the
cry of the lamb caught in the bushes was not more welcome to the
Patriarch ABRAHAM than this cry is to GoLighty TEAZLE, who is
professionally on the look-out for a scape-goat, “Now,” exclaims
that bilious subject, making too free use of his butter knife, “the
Circumlocution Office is saved. VERNoN SMITH may go to bed, and
dream that he is a statesman; the Directors may go to Church, and
humiliate themselves for other people's sins; . f may not only do
service to them and to myself, but may have an oligarchy of casual
denizens at my feet to kick about in the pages of the Saturday
Review till Parliament meets.” To which, simple Englishmen as we
are, we reply: “GoLIGHTLY TEAzLE, Master of Arts, we have almost
had enough of your conceited trifling; we have petted your Brahmin
Caste too long, and Mr. Punch has his park of artillery ready to blow
you into little pieces, if you refuse to march with the rest of us.
Mutiny is bad enough abroad, but the last mutiny we can tolerate is
treason to our home traditions. We like self-government for English-
men at all times; at all events we ſº. it to the rule of Bureaucracy
after the latter has been tried and found wanting. We are satisfie
that the cakes of the Indian Brahmins would never have produced
an Indian revolt, but for the cakes sent out by the Brahmins at home,
and we are not to be diverted from condemning them utterly, because
they appear comparatively innocent in the eyes of LIGHTLY
TEAZLE.”

MORE MAGISTERIAL TYRANNY.
IT appears that one of the legitimate profits of trade, as carried on by
the lower order of shopkeepers, arises from a pleasing#. of giving to
children, and others not likely to notice the fraud, bad money in change,
and when the cheat is detected, of appealing to a notice, stuck up in a
shop, that “No money will be exchanged after taken from the counter:”
One of the police-magistrates, who are always interfering, tyrannically
with commercial ingenuity, has decided that this notice is a piece of
impudent and useless trash, and perfectly unavailing against proof that
i. money has been given. What with persecution of folks who “ride
the monkey,” give short measure, and pass bad, coin, we hardly, see

similar praise be liberally awarded to the Hesleyan Times as, in a cathedral town,
is generally bestowed on rich “clerical port?” We hope no grumbling connoisseur,
to give proof of his fastidiousness, will exclaim, as he is sipping his Illustrated
Meios, “Capital, Sir, capital; but just a wee trifle cut.” However, there is one
consolation, that the more our lucky successors addict themselves to a bottle like
the above, the better and wiser men they will be for the invigorating practice.
Even if it gets into their heads, they will only find that
they are better men, better husbands, better fathers, better
masters, better subjects, better men of business, for it?
The man, who could imbibe three bottles of the above
mixture every day, would be such a consummate Genius
that CARDINAL WISEMAN would esteem it an especial
favour to be his shoeblack!. Cockadoodledo...!
SLAVERY AT TURNHAM GREEN.
WE see, by the advertisements of the Times, that a
French dealer in school books, agent en gros et en

Are we free sub-
jects of QUEEN Victor LA, or do we grow cotton under the

in existence within a sixpenny omnibus drive of Bucking-
ham Palace, and no Paterfamilias rises with a clenched
fist to denounce it? Imagine 85 Pupils being quietly
offered for sale, and not a single WILBERFoRCE interferes
to prohibit the unnatural sale ! Will the young ladies be
taken in one lot, or will they be offered separately? Will
they be made up in bunches of a dozen, or will they be
handed round a form, or a class, at a time. It seems that
the mistresses are to go with the pupils! Poor govern-
esses! We always thought that their }. was one, indeed,
of slavery, and this sale only too clearly proves it. We
wonder how much a dancing-master in a Ladies’ School
fetches If the fellow in the present instance had the

A COMIC TRADE CIRCULAR.
By the Circular of MEssRs. PEEK, BROTHERs, AND Co., we are
informed of a number of commercial facts which will probably prove
particularly interesting to our readers. “The first arrivals of Jordan
Almonds” are stated, in this remarkable document, to “have made
their appearance.” We would run several miles in a brief given time
to see an appearance made by arrivals. The almond-crop is described
as “short rather than otherwise.” This statement is ambiguous. A
moderate crop is a crop otherwise than short, so is an abundant crop.
Do MEssRs. PEEK AND Co. mean to say that the crop is short of
abundant, or short of moderate? These º remark, also,
“Arrowroot is again dearer, and we strongly advise our friends to
supply themselves with sufficient for their wants between now and early
Spring.” That is, they advise their friends to lay in a quantity of
arrow-root sufficient for their wants between the present time and the
beginning of next Spring. The language of this passage is extra-
ordinary; the word “now? having been heretofore used as a substan-
..] tive only by poets; moreover, “early spring” is quite a poetical phrase.
Although trade circulars generally contain jº. they are for
the most part rather deficient in poetry—“than otherwise,” as our
authors would say.
“Of fine Cloves,” say PEEKs AND Co., “we have had a largish
arrival, since our last,...the bulk of which have been placed at
about former prices.” The bulk of which have Indeed Have
it really? “Common,” they also observe, “have rather given way,
and looking at the large quantity, both here and afloat, we cannot j;
thinking that, before long, they will be bought cheaper still.” What
are Common? Fish, perhaps; like gudgeon, as we say; and the
allusion to the quantity here and afloat, tends to confirm that suppo-
sition. Unless, indeed, the members of the firm intend to declare
that they, whether on land or at sea, cannot help entertaining the
opinion which they express as to the probable cheapness of Common.
“Mace the turn cheaper,” is another of their hard sentences. What
is the turn ? how much P as the clown says in the pantomime.
“Malabar,” they tell us, “is very scarce, and that hardly, to be met
with at any price.”. Here, “that scarce Malabar” is probably meant;
but if it is “scarce,” of course it must be “hardly to be met with,”
under any circumstances. “White sells well,” they affirm, “but we
have no confidence to recommend more than hand-to-mouth purchases.”
A hand-to-mouth purchase of white is something difficult to imagine—
is it the purchase of a draught of milk? Next comes a most alarming
notification, which reads like a disastrous telegram. “PIMENTo very
sick, and if not supported by exporters, will probably go rather easier.”
Poor PIMENTo! Qfficious exporters had better let PIMENTo go easily,
The departure of PIMENTo will doubtless be a hº release. Several
other announcements, instructive so far as they are intelligible,
succeed those above quoted; but their enumeration would produce but
little effect on those whose sympathies will be monopolised by the
suffering PIMENTo.

CARDINAL WISEMAN and DR. CULLEN have been astonishing the

the publication of pastorals, in which they appear to compete for the
hisses of the British Public. We do not see a pin to choose between
the Arcadian º: speaking as PALEMON, we should say to
his Eminence MENALCAs, on the one hand, the Most Reverend
DAMOETAs on the other, “Et piłuld tu dignus, et hic ; ” or, to borrow

thing more suitable to their pastoral deserts respectively than a cow-

EFFECTS OF A QUEEN’S HOLIDAY.
MR. PUNCH likes a holiday for himself, and has a peculiar and non-
removeable objection to being disturbed with business while enjoying
that necessary relaxation from his invaluable labours. Naturally, as
well as loyally, (for happily in England lº. is rather more natural
than in certain more southern latitudes) he has hitherto considered
that when his Royal Mistress, our gracious S. L. Q. VICTORIA, is taking
Her holiday, She ought to be exempted, similarly with himself, from
the botheration of business. For a few weeks the Illustrious Lady in
uestion has been staying at her Scotch house among the hills, where
'... as a relief from the society of the Scotch aristocracy) She
has regularly devoted several hours per diem to the reading despatches,
affixing signs manual, and going through an amount of work at which
many an elegant young gentleman in her service would grumble
enormously. But this sacrifice of holiday has not been enough to
please some persons, and complaint is made, that there is no telegraph
from MR, VERNoN SMYJTH's delicate ivory and enamel desk to HER
MAJESTY's toilette-table, so that at any hour of the day or night
SMYJTH might pester the Sover EIGN with foolish observations.
Mr. Punch owns that he thought these strictures neither over-
courteous nor over just, Himself in, some sense responsible for the
good conduct of the Court, he repels, with great indignation, any
suggestion that the highest personage in the realm ever neglects her
duties. But, upon, investigation, he admits that the case, takes, a
#. aspect...The QUEEN’s having enjoyed a few weeks in the
resh air of the Highlands, has, he finds, been productive of several
casualties, and he hastens to record them, in testimony of the
superior wisdom of those who protested against HER JESTY's
residing in the country while everybody else was there. In conse-
quence of the SoverEIGN's absence from town—
A fire broke out at the house of LEVI, SMQUch, tailor, in White-
chapel, and totally consumed eight pair of slop-shop corduroy trousers,
five seal-skin caps, and a plate of fried fish, which had been set apart
for MRs. S.’s supper. The property is insured.
One of the leopards at the Zoological gardens, being approached too
nearly # an incautious charity-boy, flew at the unfortunate creature,
tore off his pewter medal, and hideously lacerated his leathern
continuations.
The wife of a respectable bookseller in the Strand, going into her
husband's shop, incautiously opened a copy of Properbial Philosophy,
but, assistance happily arriving before the narcotic could complete its
work, the poor woman recovered.
Another female, the wife of a º had been informed by her
husband that he was going to Woolwich on business, but three
days later she found in the pocket of the waistcoat which he had worn
on that occasion a day-ticket for Herne Bay pier. The shock produced
such an effect that she rushed into a shop, and ordered a new dress.

his foot upon a piece of orange-peel, slipped, and had made eleven

SIR ARCHIBALD Alison, having delivered an oration in º.

nearly a week to correct the various inaccuracies in the eminent
historian's address.

A respectable individual, on his way from the City to Charing Cross
very nearly entered the Strand Theatre, on the faith of a mutilated
p ph in the Athenaeum, out of which the *::: had plundered
a puff, but he was happily rescued by a glance at the play-bill, which
showed him that no respectable individual could witness the advertised
performance without a sensation of nausea.
A lady, getting (as she thought) into one of the old omnibuses,
entered one of the Saloon vehicles, and never discovered her mistake
until she had accomplished the journey in two-thirds of the ordinary time,
found her dress unsoiled, and was answered politely by the conductor.
These are a few among numerous accidents which have occurred in
Consequence of the Sover EIGN's having taken the holiday which all
her su º: who can afford it are taking; and Mr. Punch earnestly
hopes that these occurrences will be a warning to the Illustrious Lady.
For, though nearly all her aforesaid subjects heartily rejoice that she
should renovate her health at Balmoral, or wherever else may suit her,
and where they are perfectly certain that she does, admirably as usual,
the work she promised at her. Coronation, it is a shocking thing that
she should be out of telegraph's length of “MR. Smyth of Cannon
Row,”—that right honourable Forcible Feeble, of elegant taste in
upholstery, and usually esteemed (by his friends) more fit to put down
India matting than India mutinies.
ASEPOY LEADER—AND NO MISTAKE?
We cannot pass over, altogether without notice, the following
commencement of a leading article in the Morning Star:—
"We mentioned yesterday, in anticipation of the next telegram of Indian news,
the halt which GENERAL HAVELock has made in his second march upon Lucknow,
and the probability that, by this time, Sepoy avengement may have committed a
terrible crime in that city. We hope, most sincerely, that we are not wrong in
further anticipating that we shall, within the next two months, hear of many
additional horrors that have been perpetrated.”
Our planetary contemporary may appear, in the concluding part of
the above extract, to express a hope of hearing of many additional
horrors from India, from the merely accidental insertion, either by a
Common slip of the pen, or an error of the press, of the word “not”
before the word “wrong.” But are we so sure of this? May not the
unlucky negative have escaped the pen, as an ...º.º.
containing a realthought, however, sometimes . the lips? Really,
our peace-partisans and advocates of knocking under to all aggression,
betray such rancour against all their opponents, that it is impossible to
say what horrors they . not wish to befall their country, if they think
those horrors likely to advance their crotchets.
AMUSEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.
ThE following Advertisement is extracted from the Observer, where
it has certainly been placed under a very odd heading:-
PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS.
DELHI.—Scenes of the Head-Quarters of the Revolt in India.-
GREAT GLOBE, Leicester Square.--TO-MORROW (Monday), in addition to the
Diorama of Russia and India, will be opened a new and splendid DIORAMA of
DELEII, its Mosques and its Palaces, at 1:30 and 7:30 P.M. Admission to the whole
building, 1s.
Amusement is'hardly the object for which one would just now go to
acquire ideas of the topography of Delhi—unless, indeed, one were an
Ultramontane, Sepoy. #. Univers—if it were polluting the soil of
England by the presence of its Editor—might step into the Great
É. for that purpose, and, the universe having thus been comprised
in the Globe, might characteristically boast afterwards of the miracle.
The supply of the demand for information on any point in connection
with the melancholy subject of the day, is quite a legitimate under-
taking—but, like that of an ordinary undertaker, it is a dismal one,
and, however much it may instruct anybody, can amuse nobody.

S
Donald Punch (a Keeper). “I BEG You R PARDON, MY LORD BISHOT, BUT MAY I JUST TROUBLE YE To Show ME YOUR CERTIFICATE?”
“FAST" THE DAY AND FAST THE DEED,
A. CASE was heard before the Magistrates of Ross-shire in petty
sessions on Thursday last, in which a gentleman, attired with the
strictest decorum and wearing an episcopal hat of orthodox dimensions,
was charged with being in the unlawful pursuit of game at Balmacarra
on the Day of Humiliation. The elders of the kirk assembled in con-
siderable numbers to watch the case, as it was reported among them
that the gentleman in question was no less a personage than ARCH-
BISHOP CULIEN or CARDINAL WISEMAN, who had thus taken an
#. of evincing his indifference to our Indian disasters and
his sympat i. his serviceable friends the Sepoys of Bengal. This
impression, however, was completely dispelled, and a visible shudder
passed through the Court when the accused party, on being interro-
gated, modestly gave his name as “A. C. LONDON.”
The case at the first wore a very serious aspect, from the depositions
of the persons, who had watched the supposed delinquent. He was
overheard talking to his attendant about “capital preserves * and the
gold he had got by a former invasion of the same manor. He also
made various remarks on “the heather” and “the birds being wild,”
and was observed to be carefully searching the ground, as he told his
attendant, for “the form of a hare.” The case in short looked very
black until these expressions were º explained; when it appeared
that the “preserves * of which he had spoken consisted solely of
Scotch Marmalade, which he had used with effect for “a cold he had
caught on a former occasion in the same manner.” His mention of the
heather and the birds being wild was interpreted into a remark that
the weather was very mild, and instead of searching for the form of a
hare, he was simply looking for the Form of Prayer, which he had
inadvertently dropped while trying if he could repeat it.
On searching his person, what at first appeared to be a powder-flask
and a box of stamped gun-wads turned out to be a flask containing
some sherry and water, and a box half emptied of medicinal lozenges.
What appeared moreover to have been a gun and a shot-belt, were
also explained in an equally innocent manner; and on a Magistrate
asking, though it was not material, whether if he had actually been
shºoting, as supposed, it was in his power to produce a certificate if
called upon, he at once exhibited a certificate from his medical adviser,
who had ordered him to Scotland for the benefit of his health, which
had been much shaken by his episcopal labours,
The Magistrates at once said they would not detain him further, and
that he left the Court without, a stain on his character; at the same
time they highly complimented Mr. Punch, through whose vigilance
the supposed trespasser had been brought before them.

OFF SHE GOES :
HE Manchester Eraminer publishes the sub-
§. statement, which illustrates a well;
unown principle in natural, philosophy, and
which, of course, we implicitly believe:–
“Explosion Extraordis ARY.-On Saturday after-
noon last, during the organ performance at St George's
Hall, Liverpool, many of the audience were suddenly
alarmed by a violent report, somewhere about the
centre of the music room, which was happily not at-
tended with any dangerous results. It turned out
that the noise was in consequence of the bursting of a
lady's india-rubber bustle, which in all probability,
had resulted from the expansion of the air with which
it was inflated by the heat of the crowded room, the
material of which the piece of foolery was made being
unable to resist the pressure. Alarm was soon sue:
ceeded by merriment, in which everyone joined
except the unfortunate lady herself, who appeared
much disconcerted.”
In obedience to that law of nature, whereb
caloric, imparted to gaseous bodies, including atmospheric air (whic
consists of oxygen and nitrogen, in the proportions of twenty volumes
of the former to eighty of the latter, together with a variable quantity
of carbonic acid, besides ozone and odoriferous and other volatile
matters) causes them to expand—pop went the bustle! This is one of
those interesting facts which sometimes occur; and it throws quite a
new light on the elastic properties of caoutchouc, as well as on the
degree of temperature at which animal life is capable of being sustained,
†which, at the same time will cause the explosion of confined air.
It also demonstrates a point of minor importance—the absurdity of
inflated petticoats.
SONG OF THE LIGHT WEIGHT INFANTRY.
I AM a little man, being only five feet four,
I am a soldier now, beneath the mark no more;
A rifle I can point with heart devoid of fear,
And shoot a foe as well as any Grenadier.
Mine is the kind of weight to bruisers known as light,
Which many men who weigh, much bigger men can fight;
And though the big ones have the advantage in a charge,
More spirit may make up for body not so large.
A little man besides, upon his sturdy pegs,
Will very often march a giant off his legs;
And so he wins the palm of glory and renown;
His comrades he knocks up, his enemies knocks down.
Hurrah, then, for the field! where now I can aspire
§ country to defend, like anybody higher,
Within my body small I’ll show I’ve a vast mind,
And if I fall, my wounds shall not be found behind.

ENGLAND’S DIFFICULTY IS IRELAND’S
OPPORTUNITY.
THERE once was a time when of hatred scarce smothered
To England, as text served the words that we quote,
For preachers who taught that when Albion was bothered,
'Twas the moment for Erin to fly at her throat.
Those were º: when all kindlier feeling was banished
For pike-clubs, Nation-ballads, and shouts for “ repaie ”—
When the great SMITH O'BRIEN’s shirt-studs, somehow, vanished,
On their way from the Castle to Kilmainham gaol.
Those days are no more—may a curse lie their backs on—
The white and green Islands at length can agree;
And like two gallant brothers, the Celt and the Saxon,
Stretch out friendly hands o'er St. George's blue sea.
The old text, like so many, in meaning is double:
To the Islands’ new status if now ’tis applied,
It must, and does, mean that when England’s in trouble,
'Tis the moment for Ireland to spring to her side.
'Twas the stout Tipperary Militia, that gaily
For service in India first volunteered;
For the Minié rifle flung down the shillelagh,
So soon as a chance of “rale fightin” appeared.
And now Tipperary’s example's been followed
By the lads of Roscommon, so gallant and true:
CULLEN’s pastoral letters are read, but not swallowed,
And the Nation spouts treason, but can’t make it do.
Factious priest, factious paper, may rave with impunity,
So long as each people, as now, understand
That the other's embarrassment’s its opportunity
To help to the utmost, with heart, purse, and hand!

PERFORMERS IN “THE GRAVE SCENE.”
SoME “Funeral contractors” (that is the new term) advertise to
“perform” funerals “with a due regard to the feelings of the bereaved,
and the solemnity of the occasion.” The regard that is due is mainly
Froportioned, we suppose, to the amount of ready money that is paid?
They have different qualities of grief, you may be sure, according to the
price you pay. For £2.10s., the regard is very small. For £5, the
sighs are deep and audible. For £7 10s. the woe is profound, onl
properly controlled; but for £10, the despair bursts through
restraint, and the mourners water the ground, no doubt, with their
tears... We wonder these black crocodiles do not openly advertise the
sale of their lachrymae & We dare say that the luxury would be every
rop as expensive as early peas, or anything else that was forced. We
wonder what is the market-price of “tears per pint?”—and we are,
also, curious to know, whether these funeral pantomimists make up so
smallaquantity of mitigated grief as “one tear,” and what is the lowest
price they charge for the same? We notice, in the same grinning adver:
tisement, that “The Gothic State Hearse is used for every class funeral
above £5.” It seems, then, that there are as many classes of funerals
as there are of railway trains. There are, apparently, First Class,
Second Class, and Third Class Funerals. We hope, for the sake of the
poor, that there are no Parliamentary funerals that º their dreary
way as often as a Parliamentary train. But who, we ask, could possibly
forego the above inducement when offered at so contemptible a price?
Is there anybody, in possession of so small a sum as £5, who would not
gladly put it aside for the unutterable luxury of being buried in a
‘Gothic State Hearse!” Put another sovereign to it, and we should
not be surprised if a “Gothic State Coachman” wasn’t, also, thrownin.

In murdering women and children, with atrocious tortures, at
Cawnpore, the Indian Sepoys made a revolting mess. GENERAL NEILL
has been compelling as many of these miscreants as he could catch,
being high-caste Brahmins, to wash up, from the floor of the building
in which the massacre took place some of this mess, previously to
being hanged. This act of scavengery involves loss of caste, and that,
the iºical brutes think, entails everlasting perdition. “Let
them think so,” says GENERAL NEILL, and for having thus combined
speech with act, an Ultramontane Sepoy, in the Tablet attacks the
ſº General with frantic violence, calling him Satan, and other
rd names. - - -
Poor Brahminical Sepoy—to have been sent out of this world with
the guilt upon his conscience of º up a little of the mess he
had helped to make } cruel murder! The cruel murder was a com-
aratively light weight upon his conscience in the opinion of the
ltramontane, Sepoy, apparently. Does the Ultramontane Sepoy
suppose that the little children and ladies tortured to death were only
Protestants? - -
According to the Ultramontane Sepoy's creed, the Brahminical Sepoy
hanged, even if he had been the tenderest, gentlest, noblest, honestest,
heathem that ever existed, yet, having been hanged out of the pale of
the Ultramontane's Church, would have gone hopelessly to perdition.
How barbarous to send the inhuman, treacherous, dastardly Sepoy
into the other world with some idea of the part of it to which—in the
Ultramontane Sepoy's opinion, of course—he was immediately going.
What a tender sympathy the Ultramontane sº manifests with
the religious feelings of his Brahminical brother' What a freemasonry
exists among fanatics!—how marvellously one touch of superstition
makes the whole world of bigots kin!—would be our remarks on the
outbreak in the Tablet against GENERAL NEILL, did we not rather
suppose it to be a mere explosion of Ultramontane malice. The valve
of }. Ultramontane engine has been held down, under, popular pres-
sure; the boiler has cracked; and a jet of nearly red-hot steam has
spurted out of the fissure.
We might suggest to the Ultramontane Sepoys of the Tablet that
they perhaps rather misunderstand the principle on which GENERAL
NEILL compelled their Brahminical brethren to clear up some of the
horrid dirt which they had made. To hurt the Sepoy's religious sen-
sibilities was no object of the gallant General's. His purpose was
simply to make the best possible example of the criminals. How to
do that most effectually is the only question, to be now considered
! touching the mutinous Sepoys. If that can be thoroughly done without
hurting them, mentally or bodily, let it be done. Pain, mental or
hysical, inflicted on them as mere pain, would be idle surplusage.
# could not undo the misery, they have caused. But if any treatment
they can be subjected to is likely to deter others from repeating, their
crimes, subject them to it quite irrespectively of their ideas and sen-
sations. They can be made nothing of but scarecrows; make them
the most efficient scarecrows possible. If their superstition affords a
facility of rendering their execution terrible to their fellows, take
advantage of it. That a Sepoy should die in affright because he has
been forced to cleanse a floor of filth which he himself created by the
most abominable slaughter, is extremely desirable, if the spectacle of
such a death, in such a frame of mind, is likely to prevent the same
filth from being made again by a similar villain.
These explanatory suggestions we might offer to the Ultramontane
Sepoys, if they wanted any explanation, and did not know the real
state of the case as well as we do, and were not actuated merely by a
venomous and burning hatred of º which they º at
every opportunity of venting, particularly if, by so doing, they think
| they can do mischief to the Government and People who endure
mem.
From the treatment which the Indian Sepoys are receiving, the
Ultramontane Sepoys appear to infer that persecution awaits them-
selves. The apprehension may not be verified; but it is very natural.
HEROES AND HABERDASHERS.
THE drapers may stand fire, but they clearly can't stand chaff. They
look upon a jest as the most serious of matters. A joke becomes no
joke when, made at their expense. Well off as they may be they
can’t afford yet to be laughed at: They complain most pitifully of
the “cruel attacks” which have been made upon them by the p
and they cannot see why they should be “singled out for ridicule”
their feminine º when men of equally unmanly avocations
have escaped it. Why not attack the tailors, or the hairdressers, or the
loungers at the Clubs, or their man-cooks and lusty footment And
then, like whipped children, with tears still in their eyes, they tellus
they “don’t care,” and that no amount of ridicule will drive them to
enlist, while they will lose money and lose caste by doing so.
Now, that there’s some sense in this we willingly admit. Justice
before jokes has ever been our motto. We hate all unfair play-even
upon words; and we are averse to forming one-sided opinions.
giving judgment, always Audi alteran partem; or, speaking to com-
º we should say, Hear what the other Party's got to say
about it.
Of course we can't expect in this business-minded age to discover
that mere chivalry will pass current at the counter. Tradesmen get
the habit of looking upon matters in what they call “abusinesslight.”
and will abstain, from entering the Army or any other “concern.”
ºnless, they think that it will prove of advantage to their pocket.
The British Martyrs have died out—at least there is no chance of
raising up an Army of them—and we can’t º a draper's man to
make an Alarming Sacrifice of himself upon the altar of his country,
until he has assured himself by careful calculation, that the odds are
it would prove, a paying spec to do so. Patriotism 's all very fine
behind the ſootlights; but in a business light (to make a heinous mis-
quotation) “The Pay’s the thing!” -
But although a mercer, as a tradesman, may be excused for being
mercenary, we cannot grant that, as a º he has liberty to use
such language as the following, with which a writer to the Times
endeavours to deter his fellow-shopmen from enlistment:-
“Why should we enlist, then? Why should we lower ourselves in the social scale.
and congregate with the illiterate and debauched crew which the recruiting sergeant
is now collecting from the dregs of the population?”
The counter-jumper here. clearly jumps to false conclusions. The
question he last puts is a literally begged one. In his blind fear of
losing caste, he cannot see that he is simply frightening himself by the
shadow of reflection which he throws upon the Army. He assumes
that in the ranks he could not find a single undebauched associate ; and
if this were so, there would be certainly excuse for his not joining.
But we deny that he is justified in making the assumption; and as for
drapers' men sinking in the social scale by turning soldiers, we regard
that conclusion as a counter-jumped one also. Even granting our
recruits are “mainly labourers and navvies,” we do not think a shop.
man would just now be º the worse of for enlisting. Whatever
be his standing in the scale of sociality, we are certain that no counter-
skipper would be lowered in our eyes by his mixing with a clodhopper.
He may better carve his way to fame with the sword than with the
scissors, and is more likely to be envied as a hero than a haberdasher.
We have little wish to give advice that may be needless: but unless
our British shopmen are inclined to be nicknamed British º

of their caste.

“JOHN ToMMUs of BELGRAVY.”
- A MEDIAEWAL BAUBLE.
AMONG the antiquities in the Exhibition of choice handiworks at
Manchester, in Wall-case U, is enumerated a curious horse-headed
pastoral staff, contributed by CARDINAL WISEMAN. We should like
to know the history of this object. Conjecture will naturally, assign
the horse-headed staff to the “Boy-Bishop” who, in the middle-ages,
used to be elected on ST. NICHOLAs's day, or on the eve of that festi-
val—ST. Nicholas having been, and being still, we suppose, according
to those who believe in mediaeval saints, the patron saint of children;
He is said, by the way, to have other clients than infants; but we will
not too plainly allude to them, because we suppose that CARDINAL
WISEMAN himself governs Middlesex and the adjacent counties under
the patronage of his canonized namesake, and we should be loath to
even seem to cast such an unwarrantable imputation on his clerical
character as to hint that his Eminence was in any way connected with
the fraternity of St. Nicholas's Clerks. Such an insinuation, indeed,
would be directly contrary to a suspicion which we have very strong
reasons for entertaining. -
If the horse-headed staff above mentioned belonged to a boy-bishop,
no doubt it was carried by the juvenile prelate in the way in
which the majority of lively young gentlemen would carry a stick
having a similar ornament on the top of it. Of course, the
boy-bishop used to carry the staff in such a manner, as to give it
the appearance of carrying himself;, was, accustomed, to hold, it
near the head, passing it lengthwise behind him, and between his
legs. Perhaps this staff is the identical Art Treasure alluded to in a
venerable nursery rhyme which makes mention of a pilgrimage to the
Cross of Banbury, achieved on a Cock-horse. The pilgrim was a
boy-bishop; he rode through the air; the ride was, miraculous: it was
lº, on a horse-headed pastoral-staff; and, this is the relic.
t is not for us to lift the veil of secrecy, behind which CARDINAL
Wise MAN has a right to indulge in his private, recreations; but we
cannot help imagining that we see the horse-headed staff behind that
veil, between a pair of red-stockings. What then? The amusement
is perfectly innocent; and to give up a Fº for several months,
to be exhibited for the entertainment of others, is being very goºd-
natured. It may, however, be said in a sense, that in sending his
horse headed staff to the Manchester Exhibition the CARDINAL does
not altogether cease to ride his hobby.
An Expert Dentist.
A GERMAN CARTwRIGHT (HERR STUMPF) winds up a programme
of his extraordinary merits by the following boastful recommendation:
“P.S. Gentlemen Professors, Students, and others, need not be
under any needless alarm that it is at all necessary for them, during
the dental operation, to put aside their beloved pipes. On the con;
trary, they may continue smoking with the most blissful impunity, and
they will only find that, between two whiffs of tobacco, their tooth has
quietly gone!!!”

AN INDIAN PARABLE.
AFATHER had a son, to whom he showed much favour and kindness,
and the youth, though headstrong and careless, was brave, generous,
and kind. To this . the father presented a beautiful garden, and
also a number of animals. There were dogs, which would have been
obedient and faithful if kept under discipline and fed with proper food,
there were also rabbits, which were to be fed from the produce of the
garden, and there were other creatures, all requiring attention and
care. The boy did many good things, on his property, he made a tank
for water, and new paths, and rustic bridges, and he broke in the dogs,
(though he over-in miged them until they became dainty), and he took
some care for the rabbits and weaker things, though not so much as
he should have done, for in some bad weather, when he could not go
to them, many were starved to death. However, on the whole, he
was inclined to do his best with his i. and his stock. But some
selfish Tradesmen, who cared for mothing but gain, got his ear, and he
allowed them to have the run of his .#. and the control over it,
and they thought only of what they could make out of it. They shook
down the fruit from the trees, especially one called a pagoda-tree, and
they cared only for the poor rabbits on account of their skins, and
they pampered the dogs because they thought the animals would
protect the property from other spoilers.
One day the dogs broke their chains, and began to commit dreadful
havoc. Some of the little brothers and sisters of the jai were in the
garden, and the savage beasts flew at them and tore them cruelly, and
all the gentler creatures in the place ran hither and thither terrified.
And the boy, who had left the care of his garden to a weak-witted
lad, who was the tool of the tradesmen, suddenly heard what was
happening, and he rushed out in a terrible fury, with his double-bar
relled §§ in his hand, and he shot the abominable dogs dead, or else
hanged them, very properly. And he did all in his power to heal the
wounds of his brothers and sisters, and pulled out his pºstmoney to

º to the glory of the Penge-Hill Exhibition. It was

not carried out, and “because Manchester, you º:

Our National Defences.
SoME public-house patriot was repeating the old National
boast that “an Englishman's House is his Castle.” “I am
not so positive about that,” said a critic of the Westminster
Review; “but I am sure that an ‘Englishwoman's Dress is
Her Castle ; ” for it is such an enormous size now, that it
is morally and physically impossible for any one, friend or
enemy, to come near her!” |
A WORD OF TRUTH FOR Us, EVEN FROM
A MAN.
“To MR. PUNCH, SIR,
“I was perfectly disgusted the other day by a letter in the
Times signed by “ELLINoR’—but I do not believe a woman ever wrote
a word of it—attributing to women extravagance in matters of dress,
and calling upon us to spend less on our clothes—in fact to go without
new things this autumn altogether—and give the money to the Fund
for the relief of the indian sufferers.
“The letter was F. in large letters, and I dare say the editor
chuckled very much over it, and thought it a fine thing to get a letter,
signed with a woman's name—as he would say in his slang mannish
style—“pitching into’ women. But, I repeat, I don't believe it was
written by a woman, not a word of it. I have no doubt it came from
some mean-spirited wretch who is always grumbling at his poor wife's
milliners’ and dressmakers’ bills, for the few things she absolutely
cannot get on without—one, perhaps, who grudges her even her
!cretched allowance, and shuffles about every petty £12 10s, cheque as
the quarter-day comes round—for I am certain he does not allow her
more than £50 a-year. Relieving the Indian sufferers is all very ºcell,
but suppose, instead of calling upon women to give up, their little in-
dulgences in the way of dress—I’m sure it’s much more for the men that
we dress than for ourselves, whether married or single—the men were
to give up some of their expensive, bad, low habits—their cigars, for
example, or their curious .."particular wines; or their little dinners
at the Club, or their share of a drag to the jerby, or any other of the
thousand and one expensive pleasures in which they are in the habit of
indulging apart from their wives.
“Talk of our extravagance, indeed! People make a mighty fuss about
the Milliners’ bills of a certain bankrupt’s wife. Well, and if she
was a well-dressed woman—I suppose it was her milliners' bills that
ruined her husband? I should like to know how people—even men—
dare attribute this man's having got through £250,000 to his wife's
extravagance, when it was proved in Court, that even her milliners’
bills didn’t exceed £3000? But that is always the way with men.
They think nothing of the money they fling away in selfish, and too often
degrading pleasures; but let a poor wife express atcish for a new bonnet,
or a dress fit to be seen in, and it is at once grunts, and sulks, and talk
about “women’s’ extravagance. -
“And then, as if it wasn't enough, to have the men talking such
|
stuff, out must come this ridiculous ‘ELLINoR’ in the Times, for all
the men to cast up to us, and say, ‘Look, here’s one of your own sex
at you, at last !” That was exactly what my husband said. However,
as I said, I don’t believe ‘ELLINoR’ is a troman at all. I believe it’s
that MR. JAcoB OMNIUM, who, I understand, writes the greater part
of the Times, under various aliases.
“I maintain that, instead of spending too much of our husband's
money, our allowances, as a rule, whether for house-keeping or for
dress, are far too shabby. We are kept etually on the fret to make
both ends meet. I’m sure the struggle I have with my tradesman's
books every week nobody would believe / Of course, it’s very easy
for men to laugh, and say it’s because we don’t understand arith-
metic. I only wish they understood ready-money .# and not
getting into debt, as well as, we understand compound addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.
“I believe if ELLINoR | wants to give advice that will end in
saring, she ought to advise all the married men to give their cheque-books
and their banker’s-books to their wives, and bring them their money, an
let them keep it, and pay it in, and draw it out, -in short, to make the
women paymasters and cashiers, and the husbands to receive quarterly
allowances for pocket-money, from their wives, instead of paying their
poor wives miserably insufficient allowances for dress, as is their usual
practice.
“I have no doubt the saving in incomes that would thus be produced,
would not only leave a handsome contribution to the Indian Relief Fund,
at the end of the first year, but would, in a very short time, pay off
the National Debt, if it could be appropriated to that purpose, particu-
larly, if the wife had, in every case, the option of determining what
allowance she would make her husband for pocket-money and clothes.
I was very glad indeed to find even from a man, an admission of our
essentially economical nature and habits. To be sure, it was from an
American,—the inhabitant of a country where there has been some
slight progress made towards recognition of the rights of our sea.

the full º of fashion ? Much of this talk about the extravagance of
women is nonsense. They are almost universally careful, and many a trader would
to-day have been safe and sound if he had listened to the prudent counsels of his
wife, rather than the reckless promptings of his own ambition. It is natural for
mean men to endeavour to shift the responsibility of their folly to other shoulders,
but it is rather too much to charge a commercial revulsion like this upon one's wife
and daughters.-New York Paper.”

DINNER-TABLE TALK.
UR Paris Correspondent informs us
that the next edition of the little
book, “Comme on Dine à Paris,” is
to be dedicated to LoRD CowLEY.
It will contain a new chapter en-
titled, “Comme on dine, tant bien qué
mal, chez l'Ambassadeur de l’Angle-
terre.” An original bill of fare is to
be given. The fac-simile has been
handed round to the different hôtels
of the other embassies, and uni-
versally admired for its truthfulness.
* It consists of a handsome sheet of
$7 blank paper. It is the very.same
* entertainment that the munificent
representative of HER BRITANNIC
MAJESTY gave more than once to the
various talented juries and commit-
tees that were assembled in Paris, to do honour to British art and
science, in the year of the Great Exposition. As a literal reproduction,
the copy, perhaps, has never been surpassed.
JourneyMEN PARsons' wages.
A SPECIES of servants’ office, calling itself Registry for Curates,
publishes a list of vacant curacies for the present month “under the
sanction of the ARchbishops of CANTERBURY and York.” How
those two most reverend prelates can sanction anything of the kind,
we cannot imagine; for, besides other particulars, the stipends of
all the curacies that have any are *} and some of the curacies are
described as having no stipend at all. It is quite clear that, in learning
to write, the archbishops never learned the proverb which informs
most people that comparisons are odious; for, if they were aware of
that adage, they never would have willingly allowed the publication of
a document which cannot fail of provoking comparisons between the
highest and, the lowest ecclesiastical revenues. In the diocese of
Peterborough, there is, according to this register, a curacy with 290
souls to cure, and the superadded duty of “tuition of 16 boys”—at a
stipend of £80. In that of York there is one which differs so widely
from an archbishopric, that, whilst the population amounts to 3000,
the stipend amounts to nothing. The *... who looks from
the cathedral tower of Lincoln over the surrounding country, beholds
therein a curacy, the stipend of which, like that i. mentioned, is
£80; the furniture of the curate's house to be taken at a valuation of
£180. This arrangement must amuse the old gentleman, because it is
an awkward attempt to cheat him by selling a spiritual office without house? Perhaps he has been made the victim of some marriageable
ulation is 100; so daughter to whom, like a fool, he afforded grounds, of an action for

annum, which is much above the average of curates' wages, estimated
in proportion to curates’ work. The high valuation at which the
furniture is to be taken indicates one of two things: either that the
gurate has a very well-furnished house, or else that the vicar or rector
is a very great rogue. The diocese of Chichester contains a curacy
which may be called algebraical, for the quantity of the stipend
would seem to be less than nothing, as it is the sum of £26,
/1272?ts * payment of all rates and taxes in respect of the Rector’s
property.
In Peterborough, again, there is a curate's place vacant altogether
without stipend, and with nothing whatever to remunerate clerical
land is unable to restrain himself from making offers of which he
attendance on a population of 1027, but “vegetables, the use of a cow,
and one or two servants as might be required.” In Ely there is an
absolutely wonderful curacy. With a population of 2210, the stipend
is £2 2s. for two months, and the curate, “if married, must not have
family.”, “The labourer is not worthy of his hire,” and “Suffer not
little children,” &c., are apparently the maxims of the incumbent in
this instance. As the curate “must not have family,” would he, if,
being a husband, he should happen to become a father also before the
.. of the two months, forfeit his stipend? This point it would
behove any curate to whom two guineas are of consequence, that is to
say, many a curate, to ascertain; for such a clergyman, with a wife in
an interesting situation, would have to think well before taking that
extremely queer curacy in the diocese of Ely.
Among curacies of which the candidate is informed that “titles can
be given in the following cases,” there is one in York, whereof the
stipend is £40; the population being 2,000: so that the wages of this
place are about 2s. 2d. a-day. To the cure of 5,000 souls in Sarum, no
temptation is attached in the º: of filthy lucre: “a Residence”
only being offered, which we might suppose to be the gaol, but that
the cure of souls eatra muros would be impossible to the incarcerated
curate.
From the facts and figures above quoted, the difference between a
curacy and a living is placed in a strong light; for it is quite clear
that many curacies are employments by which the employed cannot
live. . It, is also manifest that not a few incumbents hire a curate
Jrincipally in order that he may illustrate evangelical doctrine for them
y his life, in being content without riches, and may thus take the
most disagreeable part of their duty off their hands. hiring curates,
we wonder that master-clergymen do not adopt the course of some
farmers, and resort to an ecclesiastical statute-fair, at which candidates
for curacies might present themselves with tickets in their hats,
marked with terms. An interesting experiment as to the effect of
curate's wages upon the ordinary run of servants might be tried, but
for several difficulties. Take a footman with a fine aquiline nose, get
him ordained, make him exchange his plush and shoulder-knot for
surplice and ds, the back of the carriage for the pulpit, and the
servants’ hall for the curates’ residence. Instead of waiting at table,
set, him to work at reading, preaching, baptizing, marrying, burying,
and visiting the sick. Give him curate’s wages for those which he
received as a lackey, and compel him to labour for them in the church-
vineyard during twelve months. At the end of that time, examine his
nose, and see whether it has not, from having been continually turned
up at his stipend, become permanently snubbed, and converted from an
aristocratic aquiline into a plebeian pug.
GLEANINGS FROM A PADDY FIELD.
AN old song makes mention of a certain—
“PADDywhack just come from Cork, |
With his coat nately buttoned behind him.”
The memory of that ancient lay will perhaps be awakened by the
following advertisement extracted from a Cork newspaper:—
GAME NOTICE.
HE EARL OF NORBURY requests that no one will Poach on his
Estate (CARRIGMORE) without an order from him in writing. (3902)
What animal will the PRINCE CONSORT exhibit at the next Cattle
show that will beat the EARL OF NoFBURY's Prize Bull?
Here is another remarkable advertisement, culled, likewise, from one
of the Cork journals:—
WANTED, BOARD AND RESIDENCE.
IN a Respectable Family, by a Single Gentleman, who will pay liberally,
where there are no marriageable daughters. Apply, by letter, to R., Daily
Reporter Office. (2473.)
In this motification there is, to be sure, no absolute nonsense, though
some difficulty may be experienced in understanding its drift. What

a stick to keep the ladies off, he is such an Adonis as to be subject to

there are any marriageable daughters, he is prevented from enjoying
his board by their troublesome caresses.

MYSTERIES OF THE CITY.
A GENTLEMAN connected with the Money Market, MR. R. TRE-
DINNick, issues a weekly circular, from which, amusement as well as
information appears to be derivable in one of these documents
recently published, we are told that “Edward, 9 to 9}, has become a
neral favourite; ” from which statement the inference might be
rawn that Edward was a nice boy. It is further stated that
“KELLY BRAY consists of 5,000 shares.” Everybody has heard of a
man made of money, but the idea of a man made of shares will be new
to most people. Ållusion is also made to a certain Öld Toſsus, who
may be supposed to be some gentleman advanced in years, and pro-
º: fogy, bearing a nickname. “ALFRED Consols” is likewise
mentioned, and some of our readers will perhaps surmise that the
ALFRED with that peculiarly interesting surname, is a character in a
farce, though “LADY BERTHA,” named a little farther on, savours
rather of melo-drama. “North FRANCEs,” and “South FRANCEs,”
are among the names specified; and they seem inversions of
momenclature; Christian names and surnames standing in the relation
of cart to horse, or cart to mare, the vehicle placed before the quadru-
d. We are informed that “GREAT ALFRED sold last Thursday
º worth of copper ore.” Who is GREAT ALFRED: it will be
naturally inquired. Is our second ALFRED THE GREAT a great copper.
merchant, or a great auctioneer, or a great what?
This curious circular, moreover, abounds in very strange and mys-
terious expressions. For instance, “The 16end men are rising against
the winze, sinking below the adit—both in orey ground.”. Some sus-
picion may be entertained that MR. TREDINNick’s orthography is
what the drapers call inferior, whilst those who feel that misgiving
at the same time wonder what he can possibly mean by the
announcement that sixteen end men are rising against the winds.
Cam an insurrection, be the thing intended, or a strike?—but
the winds are no authorities; neither do they constitute a firm or
a Co. The doubt about the spelling of MR. T. will be materially
increased by the perusal of his subsequent remark that “Polpice is
alsº looking better;” Polpice being conceived to be the peculiarly
written and abbreviated name of a young lady, properly called MARY
Dyce. The production before us will finally # ikely to be regarded
as questionable in point of taste; for it certainly has the appearance
of being replete with slang, whereof the following sentence may be
thought to present examples. “At St. Day timiſed a stope above the
124 is valued for tin at 81 per fathom.” We know the meaning of tin;
but what is a stope? By this time the reader will want to know, what
the odd statements above quoted really relate to, unless he knows as
well as we do, that they are particulars of mining intelligence. We
take this opportunity of suggesting, that the authors of trade circulars
and reports, and writers of money-articles, should append a glossary to
their compositions; and also that an enterprising publisher might make
a good speculation by bringing out a Companion for the City, explain-
|ing the technical terms used in business, and the nisms of the
Stock Exchange. An appropriate title for such a book would be, “The
Commercial Slang Dictionary.”

give satisfaction as Loºp PALMERSTON's for

carry the same just principle into politics? Why not decide that

known what they are, shall be deemed unfair?” To be sure, it would
throw MR. Disr AELI out of employment, but compensation might be

UGLY BRUTE As AN ISLE of SKYE TERRIER!”
THE SEPOY GOVERNOR-GENERAL."
MR. PUNgH has to acknowledge the receipt, from MR. VERNON
SMYTHE, of the following copy of LoRD CANNING's Proclamation in
favour of the Indian Mutineers:—
“The Gover Nor-GENERAL in Council has been much shocked and
ieved at the angry language which he regrets to have seen employed
y British officers and privates in reference to the unfortunate natives
who have been misled into acts which may be deplored, but which
must not be punished too severely. It is unworthy of Englishmen to
use harsh terms towards those % have not had the same advantages
of education as themselves. He desires, therefore, that in any future
letters mentioning the objectionable conduct alleged to have been
ursued by some natives towards females and young persons at
elhi, Cawnpore, and elsewhere, the writers will avoid irritating an
condemnatory language.
“The GovERNOR-GENERAL has learned with great concern that when
English officers and soldiers have captured any of the natives who
have been misled into the acts referred to, these unfortunate persons
have been tried by a court-martial, and the G.G. in council shudders
to add, have been removed from this life. Such inhuman severity is
most displeasing to the G.-G. in council, and he orders that in future
any such native, if taken with arms in his hand, may be imprisoned
till he can be tried by a jury of his countrymen, and if without arms
that bail be accepted (his own will suffice) for his going to Calcutta and
rendering himself up to the authorities.
“The Gover NOR-GENERAL has perused with a loathing to which he
finds it impossible to give adequate utterance, the accounts of some
of the means by which misguided natives have been compelled to
depart this life. He º: orders that no native shall in future be
hanged, shot, or blown from a gun, but that in the very few cases in
which it can be necessary, for the sake of example, to inflict the last
penalty, the native’s head shall be removed while he is under the
influence of chloroform, or of opiates, to be administered as kindly as
possible by the regimental surgeon.
“The GoverNOR-GENERAL, in permitting this exceptionalexercise of
|can be verified by affidavits duly filed in the offices, of the Courts of
a doubtful right, expressly orders that distinction shall be made, and
that any, native who offers affidavit upon his Shaster that he did not
actually destroy English women or children, but merely pointed them
out, prevented their escape, or witnessed their execution, shall be
treated with the clemency the G.G. is eager to show, and shall be |
dismissed on his undertaking to explain his conduct hereafter.
“The GovERNOR-GENERAL also impresses upon the mind of officers,
privates, and civilians, that it is very likely that there has been much
exaggeration in the accounts of the sufferings endured by ladies
and children who have unfortunately fallen victims to the natives' mis-
taken sense of nationality and religion. There can really be nothing so
very dreadful in death by the sword or bayonet; and the imperfectly
developed organisation of youth prevents its enduring so much as adults
do. Other details are probably incorrect; and, at all events, until they
Law, they cannot be regarded as a basis of revengeful operations. The

and juveniles, and to confine itself to a humane endeavour to restore
order in India.
“The Goyer NOR-GENERAL will punish with the utmost severity any
infraction of the rules laid down in this proclamation, and should any
Englishman be found to have put to death, or permitted to be put to
death, or not exercised his utmost endeavour to save, any unfortunate
G.-G. in Council, therefore, enjoins upon the Army and civilians to
native, armed or not, such Englishman shall be hanged immediately on -
the close of the campaign.

AN extremely foolish contributor, whom we have sometimes employed
when his betters were gone bathing, lecturing, pheasant-shooting, and
the like, says that the lying messages, brought by the electric wire
make it perfectly proper to call the dispatch a Tell-a-cram. He is
discharged.

OUR CITY POEM.
E. see that, the poet ALEXANDER
SMITH, who reminds us (in his
Christian name) of the poet ALEX-
ANDER Pop E, has published recently
some “City Poems,” in a volume
price five shillings, which on that
account, if for no other, we may not
unfairly call his crowning work.
We will not quarrel with his way of
dealing with the subject: for having
yet read only the first three lines of
is book, it would be unjust in us
to speak of it with harshness. To
our minds the word “City’ is sug-
gestive rather more of business than
of poetry, and there is no harm in
our showing what kind of City
Poem we ourselves might have
roduced, had not MR. SMITH been so lucky as to have forestalled us.
É. production will, of course, be now complained of as a plagiary, but
M.'s ºri himself has been so much accused of this, that we feel
sure he will excuse our keeping him in countenance. We frankly own
that we have parodied his opening line, but its “elegant simplicity.”
reminded us of that for which the Three per Cents are noted, and its
connection with the City was therefore so apparent that we could not
but adopt it. -
Without further explanation than the case seems to demand, we
beg the critic’s “kyind indulgence” to our
C 1 TY P O E M.
THE other day I sat upon my chair,
As I am wont to do at breakfast-time,
And tween the spoonfuls of my second egg.
Swallowed choice morsels of my borrowed Times.
With equal relish sucked I the contents
Of new-laid shell, and newly-printed sheet;
And inwardly alike digesting both, .
Nourished my body while I fed my mind. . .
The cream of the Court news I quickly skimmed,
inding, as usual, it was mere sky-blue:
Then followed I the “leaders’ some six words
or time was pressing), and with sad wry face
fuſped down a mouthful of bad Indian news.
Being a business man, my appetite
Is keener set for Trade Intelligence,
Than politics, or home or foreign news.
With gusto therefore turned I to the *
Which tersely chronicles the rise and fal
Of funds, and markets, and those Joint Stock Shares
Wherein I’ve dabbled, like a green, green goose,
And now would gladly lave my hands of them.
There learnt I that Consols had yesterday
Opened with firmness at one-eighth advance;
But, through the pressure of effected sales,
Ere noon they to their former price returned,
And closed, inanimate, at a slight decline.
The discount market still continued tight,
Tho' first class bills on easier terms were done;
Money at former rates in brisk demand—
As when, with me at any rate, is 't not ?
In railways, banks, and miscellaneous stocks
But little change that day had taken place.
Mines had however some improvement shown:
Wheal Kitty “asked for,” and Wheal Down “more up,”
Wheal Alfred firmer, i.ady Bertha brisk,
And bidders too for my Wheal Mary Amn—
A wheal whereby may I ne'er come to woe!
The list of bankrupts anxiously I scanned,
In fear of meeting some familiar name;
Then, much relieved, the Mark Lane news I'marked,
How the arrivals had been large and good,
How the best'samples had with ease gone off
While for the worse there was a dull demand:
How peas and beans had been in good request
Bad news for buyers of “Pure W heaten Bread”),
d fine old malt more money had obtained—
Giving less hope of going down in beer.
The cattle markets had much briskness shown,
Both sheep and beasts were sensibly advanced,
But calves less active, and—more wondrous yet-
There had been quiet in the pig-market.
The Trade Report but slight improvement showed;
Tallows changed hands without much change of price:
Some stir in coals: in middling sugars mome:
Coffees and teas both somewhat weaker seemed,
But rums were stronger: and, a strange, strange fact,
Feathers hung heavy in the holder's hands.
More I had learned: but on such rapid wheels
Time rolls away, man reads and has to run:
I started up, but ere my shoes were tied,

THE CAMELLIA BREADALBANICA,
Now, dear LoRD CHAMBERLAIN | Now, beloved BREADALBANE.
Are you not a nice kind of Licencer of Plays? Come, come, no turm-
ing up the aristocratic nose at a subject so contemptible—the business
is your business, and you are paid (excuse our lº singularly
well for neglecting it. We insist upon being listened to.
“Not hear us. By your salary, but you shall!”
At a place called Rochester (somewhere in Kent, my Lord), the
inhabitants were considered to be in so stupid and stagnating a state of
yirtue, that it was thought well to introduce among them a little vice,
just to make them aware of their own perfection. So a humane
theatrical manager announced a drama called the Lady of the Camellias.
Your Lordship—although a Lord Chamberlain—must know, by this
time, what the subject of such a piece is, for you certainly read the
Times, and cannot forget the scathing denunciation righteously poured
upon the †. of La Traviata. A drama founded on that opera
must be still more offensive, because vocalists emit notes, not words,
whereas the actor sends home the idea and language to every spectator.
And it is again worse, because the ineffable abomination of M. DUMAs,
fils, is thrust forward in the above title:Punch cannot even allude tº
what LoRD BREADALBANE sanctions. Well, my Lord, some people in
Rochester have heard of the character of the atrocity, id send a
remonstrance to the Chamberlain's office. MR. DoNNE, your delegate,
(a scholar and aſº who discharges a thankless office to the
satisfaction of all who have business with him) sends to Rochester
for the piece, reads it, and to make what sort of a communication to
#. manager have you, LORD BREADALBANE, reduced that gentleman?
is is it.
“I have examined the drama, entitled the Lady of the Cannellias, and find it to
correspond so nearly with the opera of La Traviata, which Has BEEN LiceNsed By
THE Lord CHAMBERLAIN, that I shall not put any impediment in the way of your
performing it at Rochester.”
Mr. Punch takes it, that blushing is not a CHAMBERLAIN's accom-
lishment, or such a letter must make your Lordship's face resemble
}.}, as described by the Page, (characters by SHAKSPEARE, a
dramatic author of other days, my Lord,) “He cºli me, my Lord,
through a red lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the
window; at last I spied his eyes.”
WALK UP, AND BEHOLD THE WONDERFUL
A PASTORAL, according to the derivation of the word, means a dis-
course delivered by a shepherd; but the compositions issued under
that name by CARDINAL WISEMAN, DR. CULLEN, and the other
foreigners who call themselves bishops and archbishops in this country,
are at variance with its etymology. The turgid circumlocution of
those un-English addresses renders them quite dissimilar to the
º of shepherds, but very much like the eloquence of the
eeper of a wild-beast show. We may perhaps be allowed to carry
the comparison a little further, and to suggest that suiting action to
word, some of the pastoral-promulgators may almost be imagined in
the act of stirring º the Royal Bengal Tiger with a long pole in the
shape of a crosier. Certainly, they are putting their heads in the Lion’s
mouth.
A Trifle from Shoe-Lane.
Two gentlemen were disputing, rather warmly, about the degree of
stature required for the Army, but couldn’t agree as to the precise
height. “Probably you are not aware,” said one, “that the standard
has been reduced lately?” “Oh! yes, but I am,” answered the other
rentleman, “every fool knows that the Standard’s reduced now to
wopence.”—Morning Herald.
STICKING TO THE SHOP.
THE Linendrapers' Shopmen declare, that they cannot think of going
to India; the Cape, they say, would be somewhat more in their line.

THE LADIES AND THE LOOKING-GLASS.

unravelling of mysteries, we
confess that there are some-

Art Palace, the Ladies' Wait-

pence. As far, however, as
our gallantry will suffer, we
feel compelled to differ with
our fair informant : for the
more we give our mind to the
consideration of the matter,
the more we are disposed to
think the smallness, not the
largeness, of the charge is to
be wondered at. It is true
that our informant somewhat
aggravated her complaint, by stating that the mirror was so placed, that every one must pass
it (in which arrangement the art-people must be viewed as artful dodgers), that she was
wholly unaware that there was any charge for using it; and that, as it was, she “only just
peeped ” at it. But although we grant there may be weight in two of these objections, we
must express a doubt if the third can be held valid. From taking careful, note of female
phraseology, we have more than a suspicion that the “only just peeping”. of a lady in a
looking-glass, implies alonger occupation of it than the words would seem to indicate., Sup-
posing our informant is a model of forbearance, her “peep” may have accorded with the
meaning in her Dictionary; but she must recollect, all ladies are not similarly gifted, and in
.." looking-glass reflection tariff, of course the calculations must be based upon the
aggregate.
It is impossible, of course, to †. with any certainty of anything so frightfully uncertain
as a Woman,” but from making frequent observation of the time which ladies take when they
get before a looking-glass, we can, form a pretty accurate opinion, on the subject. We
have indeed statistics, very carefully collected, which enable us to calculate with tolerable
exactness, what portion of their lives ladies spend before the looking-glass; and we are prepared
to show that, making due allowance for feminine uncertainty, the actual duration, of “Qnly
just a peep” averages not less than sixteen minutes and a quarter. This at the Art-Palace
price, a penny for a peep, would hourly bring in fourpence and a fraction of a farthing; and
allowing that the Manchester Art-mirror was in constant occupation during six whole hours
per diem, the weekly return would but just exceed twelve shillings. So far, then, from
agreeing that the fee charged was exorbitant, we are more disposed to consider it most
moderate, and to wonder it was thought that it, would prove a ºf one : a result which
indeed could be only brought about by the artful dodgery aforesaid, of placing the glass, so
that in her exit from the waiting-room every lady passed it. This of course ensured its ...;
constantly in use; for, one might as well expect an Alderman,to pass, one the milk punc
without helping himself, as imagine that a j. could ever pass before a looking-glass without
“just taking a peep at it.” -
Looking therefore at the looking-glass in the light of an Art-fixture, we cannot see it casts
the least reflection on the artful ones who furnished it. Without imputing sordid motives
to the Manchester Art-treasures, we must admit, of course, that having spent much money
in showing them, they had substantial reasons for º: the Art-treasures from a
business point of view, and for keeping a sharp eye to the state of the Art-treasury. Com-
sidering that in Manchester the Economic Mania is carried to excess, and that business men
have there the greatest possible aversion to lay out money needlessly, we think it was a gallant
act in them to sink'a certain portion of their capital in a looking-glass; and it is préposterous
in ladies to feel a twinge of wonder that such accommodation was not furnished to them
gratis. In common fairness the fair sex should have felt grateful for the delicate attention to
their wants, and have seen in the looking-glass a convincing piece of evidence that, even in
Manchester, men of business sometimes let their gallantry get somewhat the better of them.

A youth who grasped as firm as ice

But still he muttered with a smile:

“Oh, stay!” one member said, “and think!
We stand upon an awful brink!”
He gently closed his left blue eye,
But still he answered with a sigh:

“Try not that dodge,” another said,
“Dark lowers the tempest overhead;
The mutiny’s spreading far and wide.”
But still that cheerful voice replied:

THE BATTLE OF CREMORNE.
R. PUNCH derives satisfaction from
finding that the Middlesex Magis-
of Cremorne, because the Police, as
usual, neglect their duty. Middle-
sex Justice is not so blind as to
charge MR. SIMPson with the over-
charges of cabmen, and with the con-
sequent squabblings between them
. their fares, nor will it visit upon
him the fact that some of his vis-
itors express their satisfaction with
his entertainments by uncouth shout-
ing and inharmonious singing. Such
demonstrations, both hostile and ap-
lausive, have, Mr. Punch is informed,
º once or twice heard before the
hospitable mansions of more than
one most distinguished host, “the
only veritable Amphitryon—him with
whom one dines.” Mr. Punch is
pleased with the decision by which
eighteen to eight Magistrates have
refused to injure MR. SIMPson be-
cause cab-wheels and snobs make a
noise, and because gents may not be
as well up in the table of fares as they are in the Ready Reckoner.
But as the recognised LorºD CHAMBERLAIN, Censor, and Master of
the Revels of the world, it may be expected from him that he should
express with more completeness his view of the whole Cremorne case.
He states, without the least hesitation, that he concurs with several of
his friends, members of the Royal Family, that MR. SIMPson's gardens
are very delightful ones, and for a daylight visit, a place to which a
| Bishop may go without risk of a speck upon what MR. John TIMBs
º informs us is called by uninformed laics, the Apron, but which
the Christian world ought to know is nothing more than the short
cassock, ordered by the 74th canon. Furthermore, Mr. Punch is happy
to add, that MR. SIMPson’s evening entertainments are not merely
unexceptionable, but excellent, the coloured lamps are Alhambraic,
the music Jullienesque, the Marionettes an immense improvement
upon the wooden actors at several theatres that might be mentioned,
the fireworks worthy to celebrate a Peace by which we gained some-
thing (everybody will comprehend that we don’t refer to the Treaty of
Paris), while the poetry of the Hermit seems modelled upon-though
superior to the compositions of but perhaps we have touched up that
great bard often enough. The refreshments are capital, and though
not unmindful of the Château Margaux and the punch, we have been
articularly struck with the rich flavour and aroma of the Imperial
op, vintage 1857, the Comet year. Lastly, while on the credit side
of the account, Mr. Punch must not omit to say, that the behaviour of
the visitors is exceedingly exemplary, far better, especially as regards
the dancers, than that of many of the attendants at similar Parisian
#. to which Paterfamilias, once away from the respectability of
loomsbury Square, hurries, and very often takes Materfamilias, and
thinks he has rather done a knowing thing than not. And whether all
the said visitors may take with them “all the Virtues under Heaven,”
(the demise of Bishop BERRELEY having left those amiabilities
without a residence, an allusion which no fast man will understand
and so we refer him to MR. PETER CUNNINGHAM for explanation)
we do not exactly know. Some people behave all the better in the
absence of a conviction that they are immaculate, and can do nothing
wrong.
But Mr. Punch begs to state, with equal distinctness, that he knows,
and desires to know nothing of the Gardens after the evening's pro-
ſº. ls over. º may, after midnight, be as orderly as before.

hour for the home journey, and tranquillising cigar, and curtain lecture,
and the clock strikes one. Seven golden hours of sleep are coins the
strongest must pay as ground-rent to Nature. And therefore we have
nothing to say to anybody who stays at Cremorne, or anywhere else, at
unseemly hours, except j." he ought to be ashamed of himself.
Natheless, Mr. P." is glad that the Magistrates did not make an
exceptional rule against Cremorne, and compel closing at an hour
when. if a hºmei manager has the cruelty, and a playgoer the folly,
to inflict and to witness dramatic debility, the playhouse, may remain
| open. Fair play all round. And Mr. Punch will not conclude without
trates will not punish MR. SIMPson,
adding, that the Magistrates must have arrived at their decision from the
promptings of their own sense of justice and logic, for the trashy clap-
trap chiefly offered in favour of the licence was worthy of all contempt.
Had it been proved that the Gardens were a nuisance, it was not
because the owner “had laid out £30,000," and given “ſº to the
Indian Fund,” and “was the largest ratepayer in the parish,” that the
licence ought to have been granted. It certainly ought not—even in
money-grubbing England—to be in favour of a nuisance that it was
established at a great expense, or that a fraction of its profits was
given in charity. The fact was, that there was no case; and satisfied
as Mr. Punch is with the result, he would have liked it better, un-
garnished with Bosh.

PATTERNS FOR DRAPERS’ YOUNG MEN.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“ALLow me to observe, Sir, that we Linen-
drapers' Assistants are not the only parties who are doing
women's work whilst, they might be fighting the battles
of their country. What do you say to the great majority
of the Parliamentary gents? At present, to be sure, they
are doing nothing but shooting pheasants; but their work,
when they do any, consists in talk, if I may be allowed to
º: myself infine Irish. Now, Sir, I ask you whether
talk, and mere talk please, to observe, is not, of all occu-
pations, most decidedly that of a woman. Well, then,
suppose, by way of setting us an example, honourable
members leave words to the ladies, and resort to blows
instead, and relinquish, the fowling-piece for the rifle.
They might take their footmen of six feet—you see the
joke, Sir?—with them; and then they would revive the
romantic, arrangement of knight, and squire, usual in the
good old times of chivalry. Noble lords, with their
retainers, might also go out to India, in the capacity of
volunteers. The Bishops could not accompany the tem-
poral mobs, but they might send their domestics to serve
under them; and in the meanwhile do without coaches,
and be satisfied with first-class railway carriages, and with
the apostles' horses. Parties in a superior station would
have a great advantage over us as soldiers. Pay would be
no object to them; but it would be important to us gents,

Going Awry.
A DAMSELof Rye has (to the great wrath of the Morning
Advertiser) permitted a Popish priest to cajole her into
renouncing a religion for a superstition. We can spare the
silly girl to Romanism; but, in the name of GeoRGE
Borrow, must protest against her being known as the
Romany Rye.
SNOBS ALL, MY MASTERS!
OH, Flunkeydom, flunkeydom, what paragraphs are written in thy
name!, Thy domain is co-extensive with the spread of the great
Anglo-Saxon Race!, I apprehend that it is a fact not to be gainsaid
that, taking John Bull, in the widest sense—as including the Ameri-
can branch of the family—he is the greatest snob beyond comparison,
and most abject flunkey, ever known in this world.
I find nothing of the same peculiar kind in France, or Germany, or
Italy, or Spain, or Turkey, or even Russia. In the latter country the
serf bows down to the noble—the Tschin is respected by all classes not
included within its thirteen grades—because mobility in Russia is, the
symbol of power and authority, and means the right, and privilege
to inflict some kind of Fº or pain, I do not call this sort. of
kotow snobbishness. It is slavishness, if you will—a dog-like feeling
—but there is no flunkeyism in it. Sö in Austria, what people bow
down to, is military rank, or official position, both, sources of possible
oppression, if not conciliated. But only in England do I find that
abject worship of a Lord as a Lord—that licking the shoes of a class,
which has no power or privilege to oppress or brow-beat, or bastinado
either literally or metaphorically—that hoisting of them into every
chair at every public dinner—that foisting of them into every office of
every calibre-that silent reverence of them in every private gathering
of every, condition of men—that hustling and hurraing of them in
every public concourse on every occasion.
The DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE, and a distinguished party—distinguished
as containing a large proportion of peers, and peer's kith and kin-visits
the Manchester ÉÉ. ; straightway the Ancient Masters are
abandoned, and the moderns cease to charm. MR. HALLAE’s cunning
fails in the orchestra, and even the Corporation Gold plate, no longer
- reasures of the United Kingdom
are for the moment eclipsed and swallowed up, and set aside by the
DUKE of CAMBRIDGE. They run after him, the crowd dog his heels, they
press upon him. It is necessary to form a ring of policemen round the
ducal person to save it from damage. , So, girt by his ring of protecting
policemen, the Duke, with much...ado, gets the Art-Treasures, seen,
himself the sole and single, Art-Treasure, while he remains in the
building. He looks at everything—and as if all the fruit of his gazing
passed into him, and there became quintessentialised and sublimated,
everybody else iocks only upon him!
Our Yankee friends are as bad, for 'all their affected equality and
democracy. JonATHAN loves a Lord as absolutely, abjectly, and
offensively, as JoHN BULL. -
It is not enough for us to mob their movements, and drive them into
a hedge of policemen, but we must follow them, about with the most
miserable drivel of recording penny-a-linism, and Court Newsmanship.
We must have a human being paid to solemnly record how j
“affable and amusing ” His Royal Highness, PRINCE ALBERT, was
when he met “a select party at the MAYOR of MANCHESTER’s,” and
how he told several anecdotes.
Among others was the following:—
“While in Osborne he was in the habit of getting up very early, and walking
about his farm. Passing a farmer's house he stopped to make some inquiries;
knocked at the door, and asked the servant if his master were in 2 The servant
replied, “He is in, Sir, but not down-stairs.” “Oh, very well,’ was PRIscº ALBERT's
reply, and he was about to leave. ‘Would you be kind enough to leave your name
Sir?” said the servant. ‘Oh, it does not matter,” said the PRINCE. “Because,”
said the servant, “my master would be angry with me if I did not tell him
who called.” “Very well,” said the other, "You may say PRINCE ALBERT.” Upon
which the man drew back, looked up significantly, put his thumb to the tip of his
nose, extended his fingers, and exclaimed “Walker l’”
. Whereupon the reader, exhausted, with the sustained and breathless
interest with which he has followed his Royal Highness to this point,
can but ejaculate, in faint echo, “Walker!” also, and put his thumb to
the tip of his nose, and extend his fingers, in the direction of the gifted
penny-a-liner.

A LEADER FROM THE “STAR.”
[WE have great pleasure in giving extended publicity to the views of the ex-
peacemongers, as set forth in their Penny Daily Organ. The following is an excel-
lent specimen of the mode in which the Manchester-men treat the Indian crisis.]
THE British dear newspapers continue to bluster, but we cannot see
that Old HAVELock and Old CAMPBELL are a bit nearer the crime
which is being urged upon them than they were months ago.
course, if a British officer mounted on a tremendous Life Guard’s
horse, and armed with a sword, revolvers, and a lance, and sheathed
between an impenetrable cuirass and backpiece, rushes upon a few of
the QUEEN’s half-naked subjects with dark skins, and they run away
to save their wives and children from outrage, the high-priced press
makes him a hero. We should like to know where in the Scripture
Life Guards are ordered to charge Hindoos, and yet we call ourselves
a Christian nation, and the writers in the Times very likely drive to
church in carriages. - - -
As to “punishing”, the Orientals, the insolence of the word is only
equalled by its absurdity. To º is the act of a superior, unless,
to be sure, the word is taken from the brutalities of the prize-ring
which is so great a favourite with our aristocracy, and whose atrocities
are equalled in their fashionable schools, which the Quarterly parsons
laud. In that case “punishment” is a thing which either side may
get, and for all we can see, our dark fellow-subjects are as able to
administer it as our white ones. We do not profess intimate acquaint-
ance with the ferocious science of war, but we take it, that if a cannon
is laid properly, the ball will do equal execution, whether the be
fired by an Artillery Colonel or a Bumbasheeboo. . Cannon-balls are
sad democrats, and won't listen, to the gentlemen in Printing-House
Square, who would kindly direct them on their "way.
Old HAVELock is said to have fought mine battles, and as nine
tailors make a man, nine battles may make a hero.
acres of ground in his fall, and our Indian Mars may have the same
luck. Of course, anything is called a battle when furious officers, with
hands red with gore, dismount in an infuriated state, and pen des-
patches. If we Čould read what the so-called rebels say about the
matter, we dare say that a good deal of the swagger would be taken
out of these victories. But if they are all they are said to be, we see

Mars covered nine
nothing in them to warrant exultation, because such victories imply
that the sword and violence are having it their own way. Far better
that the Indian Mars should be checked, and a Commissioner, say
. Fox, be sent out to treat between
high-priced newspapers, for we rejoice to read that Nature would not
É. hand to assist the fiend . blood, and that the Ju swollen
by rains from the Himalayas and the Mountains of the Moon, was
offering an obstacle daily becoming more formidable to the invincible
HAVELock, or HAvoc.
... But if Delhi, should be taken, which we pray may not be the case,
the very cant of the military trade ought to secure leniency to those
within its walls. They call it i. to defend a position. What then
must be the glory of those who could defend Delhi against the mira-
| culous prestige of the English name, and against the thunders of the
| English press. Had Delhi been Jericho, the brazen trumpets would
have had it down long ago. But we do hope that should HAVELock
or CAMPBELL, or whichever of these fiery old gentlemen is to have the
honour of ravaging a noble city, succeed in entering its walls, he will
bear in mind that if the so-called rebels killed some women and
children, they were equally ready to kill the terrible soldiers of
England, and therefore are entitled to the tender mercies of the Pagan
code of war. Stupid as the military may be, they cannot fail to see
this, if all the lead in all the types of the Times were in their heads:

and magnificent titles, and therewith a statement that the Sardinian
Government had offered spontaneously to KING BOMBA. to . from
the Piedmontese territory twenty-six Neapolitan and Sicilian refugees, of
whose names he gives a list. This story has been contradicted by the
Government of Sardinia; it is, then, doubtless, the product of the
imagination of the Chevalier. We apprehend that this inventive
Chevalier is a Chevalier of the industrious order.

JUVENILE ART-TREASURES.
PRIVATE VIEW.
oLLowING the lead of
- the Manchester Art-
people, a committee
of young gentlemen
has recently been
º, * the
view of getting u
an §. of |
the Juvenile Art-
Treasures they can
anyhow lay their
hands on. It is in-
tended to confine the
specimens exhibited
works of our ex-
º young
masters; and any master who exceeds the age of ten will be esteemed
too ancient to have his works exhibited. The object, which the Art-
Committee will keep steadily before them, is to show the º of
the Arts from the earliest infancy, and it is confidently hoped that
specimens may reach them even from the cradle. Of the works
which have already been entrusted to their care, we have been cour-
teously invited to a private view, and we have our own permission to
make public the results of our inspection. -
No oil-paintings as yet have been received by the Committee, and
indeed the only i. of canvas in their hands is a piece used as the
ground of an unfinished work, in worsted, on
which the outline of a kettle has been traced
in marking-ink. This has been sent in by a
oung Welsh master, MASTER Jon Es; and
aving been achieved at the age of not quite
three, may be viewed as a specimen of his very
early period. Several water-colour sketches
have, ºr. come to hand, one or two of
which are quite chefs-d'oeuvre in their way, and
are prized § the mammas of the young masters
who have painted them as being early sweepings
of the brush of genius. Some of these, we note,
are somewhat smudgy in their tone, and must
perhaps be viewed as being rather after rubbings
than they can be after RUBENs; still, upon the whole, the colour-boxes
have been used with singular effect, and, for first attempts, the
landscapes are perhaps not more completely unlike nature than is
usually the case. MASTER SMITH's in this way are especially unique,

fact, will be completely represented—both
the Lead school and the Slate. There are
some portraits in the former style which
must have not a little startled those who
sat for them, so far from being human are
the features represented. With the slate-
pencillists, however, there is a greater
fendency, to landscape than to drawing
from the life. Several of their subjects are
indeed architectural, but their houses, for
the most part, are merely sketched in out-
line. Their landscapes are, however,
works of more pretension, and even ani-
mals are introduced in some of them with
the happiest effect. There may be doubts

doubtless be an object of considerable interest: while those who have
a taste for Sculpture can hardly fail to be delighted with the Robinson
Marbles, which, in the estimation of their owner, are not second to

goodly show of Alley Tors as well as Commoners.
The Armoury Compartment will be very rich in specimens. ... Several
of the fly-guns will be found most delicately finished, and well worthy
of inspection; and although the pop-guns show less º and º:
more hº workmanship, still, their elegant simplicity is in i a.
beauty. The pea-shooters and pin-darts are, also very choice, and
some of the toy-cannon will be viewed as highly interesting specimens
of early English ordnance. But perhaps the gem of this compartment
is a suit of pasteboard armour, lately manufactured for some nursery
theatricals. This will be found to repay the closest study *;
exquisitely finished, and complete in every detail, down to the

omprising as it will such young Masterpieces, as these, there can

in an accessible locality, was scouted as not following the Mºjº:

FASHION WITHIN COMPASS.
INDULGE not, husbands and lovers, the fond hope that ladies, are
about to abandon unlimited petticoats. Our good news is merely this:
that, for once in the way, Fashion is mathematically and logically
correct in a statement respecting the Circle. We congratulate the
Morning Post on publishing this quite unobjectionable announcement:-
“The MARQUIs of BRIsrol is at Ickworth, near Bury St. Edmund's, surrounded
by a select circle.”
Some critics may demur to “select; ” but the º is lawful.
“Select,” according to DR. Johnson, means “nicely chosen; choice:
culled out on account of superior excellence.” The circumference of
the circle, whereof the MARQUIs of BRISTOL is the centre, is perhá
at every point as nearly equidistant from the centre as it is P. e
for any circle to be drawn. Consequently, it is the nearest actual
approach that can be made to a perfect circle; and it may, on that
account, have been “culled out” of a number of other circles less
accurately described, “on account of superior excellence.” It is quite
clear that the circumference of the circle whose centre is the MARQUIs
of BRIstol cannot be formed of other Marquises, because there must
be some degree of distance, however small, between the circumference
and the centre. It cannot be formed of Dukes, because a Duke is
above a Marquis, and the centre of a circle can nohow he below the
circumference. Neither can it be constituted of Earls, inasmuch as a
Marquis is above an Earl, and the circumference of a circle cannot be

THE Initial System has turned out partially a dead letter; at least,
the Dead Letter Office never was so full as at the present moment.
The Initials only cause a greater waste than economy of time, and this
waste arises from the endless mistakes that are constantly occurring.
Persons are too lazy, or else too busy, to consult their Street Guide;
and so, in their hurry or indolence, they dab down any initial, that, to
their geographical mind, seems to be the nearest approach to the truth.
Hence, . after confusion; so that letters are carried to the
wrong district, or else have to be sorted and resorted, until the error
is corrected. . We need hardly state, that this loose system, is not
exactly the right, sort to avoid delay. Sometimes the mistake is on
ES Q.
the side of the Post, Office; as, for instance, when a letter is marked
N.W., and, intended for the North-West division of London, is
forwarded to North Wales. But more frequently the error is the
natural result of the stupidity or carelessness of the correspondent.
Our readers, doubtlessly, recollect the sample address that was given
in the Post Offic. Guide §: ld.). It ran as follows:–
James Thompson, Fen,

London.

Now, will it be believed—and, the fact is, so º absurd
that it is almost incredible—that hundreds and hundreds of fools have
copied the above address . James Thompson has enjoyed for
months past the largest correspondence of any man in the world. The
Editor of Bell's Life, to whom most matters of dispute, from tennis to
theology, are referred, does not receive one-thousandth part the
number of missives that are sent to the address of the illustrious
unknown, who does not live at No. 300, Cheapside, for the simple reason
that there are not three hundred houses in that street. No man has
given the Post-Office so much trouble since the days of Joseph Apy,

slices of wedding-cake -what political, watchwords!—what vestry
conspiracies!—what tender avowals of blushing affection!—must be

large an area? It is our opinion that its Empire is only restricted by
the limits of the Penny Post. We hope the incredulous reader will
not imagine that we have invented the above incidents. e can
assure him that, strange as they appear, they are positive facts. If he
doubts our word, let him write to James Thompson, Esq., and ask him
whether we have made an improper use of his name.

PIOUS BLACKING.
We are happy to read the announcement that a great religious
movement is on foºt, Roman Catholic Blacking is now to be set up
against Evangelical Blacking. In other words, the Society of S. WIN-
CENT DE PAUL is organising a Blacking Brigade for the enlistment of
little Papists who decline to enrol themselves among the red-coats of
LORD SHAFTESBURY's squadron. They wear a blue uniform with red
cuffs, and the emblazoned initials S.V.P., which may either refer to
their patron saint, or imply “Shoes Well Polished.” Some of the lads
are already at work at the West-end. We hear that so keen are their
religious scruples, that they refuse to use Protestant liquid for their
brushes, and that a º of penny coagulated blacking has been
forwarded from Rome º the eminent chemist who manufactures the
red pomatum called the blood of S. JANUARIJs. This orthodox black.
ing is warranted to melt on a Catholic foot being placed on the lad's
; but to remain hard as coal should a Protestant try to get a
pOllSI).
This is all right, and we are glad to see industry encouraged. But
is there to be no provision for other divisions of religionists? Are
none but Evangelicals and Catholics to black and be blacked 2 Are
Puseyites to go, about with muddy boots? Is the High Church to
wear dirty Highlows.º., Is the Dissenter to be refused a scrub? And
the Jew, are pig's bristles to deny him their office? This is sectarian
intolerance, and not to be endured in the nineteenth century. Agi.
tation ought at once to be commenced. For ourselves, we aré, in this
matter, somewhat of the opinion of MR. THOMAS MooRE, who
beautifully says:–
“Shall I ask the bold child of the Blacking Brigade,
Who scrubs at my corns, if our creeds agree;
Shall I injure that gay little shoe-blacker's trade,
If he kneels not in Protestant Orthodoxee P
From the heretic Boots at the Swan shall I fly
To some Papist who over my bluchers shall hiss;
No; perish the hearts and the laws that would try

iTHE WARRIOR AND THE WAITER.
A SERGEANT, recruiting, his energies spent,
And was forced to recruit his own frame;
So into a Tavern and Chophouse he went.
He called, and a tall waiter came.
“A steak!” said the Soldier, and, “Cook a rump-steak!”
The waiter immediately cried.
“Any beer, ale or porter, Sir: which would you take **
* Fint of stoutſ” the bold Sergeant replied.
The steak soon was brought, with potatoes and bread,
And one thing to state I forgot,
That his steak when he ordered, the customer said,
That he with it would have a 'chalot.
To follow, the §. then ordered stewed-cheese;
And, having sufficiently dined, .
Cried, “Hoy, there! a glass of mixed punch, if you please;
And let it be hot, young man, mind.”
The tumbler of punch soon our hero drank out,
then summoned the waiter, to say .
“Rump-steak, 'chalot, taters, one bread, pint of stout,
And stewed cheese, and mixed punch. What’s to pay?”
“Two-and-eight,” was the answer: the Sergeant put down
On the table before him the sum,
With a penny moreover: at which single “brown”
The dissatisfied waiter looked glum.
“Ay, ay,” said the Sergeant, “I know that won’t do.
#. take this, my lad-you understand:
This will much better suit a fine fellow like you:”
And a shilling he slipped in his hand.
It closed on the coin, and the napkin let drop.
“I’ll hand plates,” cried the waiter, “no more;
Let girls serve in Tavern as well as in Shop!”—
He is now on his way to Cawnpore.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WILL IT WASHP
AN apparently funny invention has just been patented by a gentle-
man of Manchester, MR. JoHN DE LA HAYe. It consists in a
contrivance for submerging electric cables. Apparently funny we call
it, because, even if we were not so wise as we should be, and are,
experience, which would have taught, even ourselves wisdom, would
have made us know better than to make fun of any invention without
sufficiently understanding it to be quite sure that it involved something
impossible or absurd. There are wiseacres yet living who ought to
blush at a gas-lamp, and hide their faces at the sight of a locomotive.
We will not risk classification in their category, by comparing the
Hº: of MR. DE LA HAYE with the devices of the Laputan sages—
ut its seeming oddity suggests to us a question which appears not to
have occurred to anyone of a numerous meeting of engineers to whom,
at the Town-hall, Manchester, the plan was expounded by its inventor:
who, according to the Times, said that—
“The plan he would adopt would be to encase a cable prepared like that for the
Atlantic 8. in a soluble compound (the composition of which he would not now
mention), capable of floating it for a time on the surface of the water. The coating
he proposed to use for this purpose he supposed would hold it on the surface of the
waves while about five miles of cable were payed out from the vessel before it began
to dissolve, and as it would dissolve gradually, so the cable would sink gradually to
the bed of the ocean. By this means he calculated that there would always be about
five miles of cable lying on the surface of the water in the wake of the vessel, and
the remainder would describe an incline to within 100 or 200 feet of the bed of the
ocean, so that there would be comparatively little strain, and consequently less
liability of breakage. The cable would descend into the ocean almost horizontally
instead of perpendicularly.”
In the above account there is a little parenthesis which deters us
problem of extracting sunbeams from cucumbers. His soluble com-
pound, he said, was one, “the composition of which he would not now
mention.” Iced cream adroitly disposed around a cable would perhaps
.#: it in the manner, above described, if it could be procured in
sufficient quantity, and laid down continuously in weather not too cold
—upon one condition. A dead calm would be required to reign at the
time. At least the operation would not be practicable whilst the waves
were running mountains, high, even if the cream were laid down in
long ; It would be necessary that the Atlantic should be in
a particularly good, humour to enable it to be performed. A large
flock of halcyons or kingfishers would have to be collected and trained,
if possible, to produce the desired effect. With any ordinary substance
it would be impossible to accomplish the design. But perhaps MR.
DE LA HAYE employs an extraordinary substance, and is prepared to
answer the question:—How about the waves?

“In the first place, the dear creatures must believe me when I say,
that I am perfectly incapable of joining in a laugh at them. However
near I may unguardedly approach the verge of doing so, my better
nature, always is quite sure to get the better of me, and I then recoil
from the enormity as though it were a precipice. When, therefore, I
submit my new invention to their eyes, I do so without fear of their
mistaking it for ridicule. I should not ask their sanction to my puttin

“Acquitting me, therefore, of all thought of making fun of them,
ladies will feel naturally curious to know, why I Fº wearing my
Inflated Pegtops? and what can be the good of their preposterous
expansion? To these momentous questions permit me, ladies, for the
moment, to return you Quaker answers, by asking why do you wear
Crinoline? where on earth’s the good of it?
“Now, of course, ladies, I am not so *. absurd as to
expect that you will favour me at once with reasonable responses.
The utmost I can hope from any living woman is that, in answer to
my one query, she should say, Because we choose; and, in answer to
my other, she should tell me Not to bother. In ladies' logic, these
replies would be accounted ‘reasons; for, as SYDNEY SMITH the
reverend, unflinchingly asserts, the mind female does not reason, in the
sense in which the mind male understands that verb.
“I will, therefore, ladies, take the liberty of answering my questions
myself, and of seeking out some reasons—bond fide reasons—for you.
Next week, if you please, and if Mr. Punch will let you, you will have
the pleasure in your hands of saying the last word, and of showing, if
you can, that I have jumped to false conclusions.
“Now, why do you wear Crinoline — Because your next-door
neighbours do? Because the EMPRESS OF THE FRENCH does? This
would only prove what SYDNEY SMITH-that ungallant divine—has
also said, that ‘Woman is at best but an imitative animal.” Would you
have your heads shaved, because, your next-door neighbours had
Your grandmothers wore hair-powder for no more reasonable reason.
Of the two, I think a head clean shaved would be a sight more comely
than a dust-and-dirt-bepowdered one. And pray, what have you to do
with what the EMPREss of THE FRENCH does P. What’s EUGENIE to
you, or you to EugéNIE * If an Englishwoman must take a Queen as
er life model, let her be a loyal subject, and not look across the
Channel for one.
“But why do you wear Crinoline?–Because it is the fashion?
Well, but who sets the fashion? the lady, or the milliner? the wearer
or the worker P Are you not all slaves, º: slaves, to your modistes:
Is not every one of you at the mercy of her dress-maker: under her
thumb and thimble as completely, sleeve and body, as though you
were but serfs, and she enthroned in might, Empress of all the Bustles?
But then there are the fashion-books. Following the fashion, of course
you read the fashion-books, You consult them as your oracles; and
regard them as infallible (being printed) proofs that Crinoline’s ‘The
Thing,’ let men say what they will of it. But you forget to ask the
question,...Who gets up the fashion-books? And, might you not be
startled if you learnt that in *...* them as absolute authorities,
and bowing to their nod, you are in fact complacently salaaming to
your dress-makers.
“Why, then, do you wear Crinoline 8–Because you think it is be-
coming to you? Well, a bread-and-butter Miss might be excused such
miss-conception; but that any grown-up Woman, who is passed her
skipping-rope and lº. should entertain that thought, it quite
surpasses man's be #: I cannot yield my faith to such a libel on
the sex. The mind female may not reason, but it is not idiotic. The
brain feminine is º: of ocular impression. Mirrors give the
means of outward self-examination; and the lady who can look her
cheval-glass in the face, and say deformity becomes her, must have a
blinding pigstye in her mental vision.
“Then why do you w— No, don’t say that. Don't catch me up
so short, that it's ‘to please the gentlemen!” I really cannot suffer
}. to foster that delusion. After all we’ve said and written to you,
ow can you dream of doing so? Pick out any number of unbiassed
men you will—by ‘unbiassed” I mean, being neither henpecked fools
nor lovers, put them in a jury-box (an opera one will do), and ask
them what they think of you, in Crinoline and out of it. There would
not be need of much deliberation. Were I their foreman, I should
have to say (however it might pain me to use such harsh expressions)—
“When lovely Woman stoops to Crinoline, she ceases to be Woman, and
beeomes a Monster.”
“This would be their verdict. Were a million men empanelled,
still I’d bet you gloves all round you’d not find a dissentient.
“After all, then, I must own the Why you wear your Crinoline? is
an unguessable comundrum. The mysteries of female dress are not
for men to fathom. To the male eye there is neither use nor beauty
in exuberance of skirt; or, at least, its only use appears to be in hiding
dirty stockings, or some personal defect. Men in general believe, that
the inventress of Crinoline was a sloven about her ancles, or had p0S-
sibly splay feet. And then . draw the cruel inference, that those who
copy her invention are impelled by reasons similar: seeing that no
better have as yet forthcome from them.
“Mais revenons à nos Peytops. My reasons for inventing THEM it
needs no blush to palliate. I did so purely out of compliment to your
superior sagacity. As you seem to think that Nature is improved by
wearing Crinoline, let me profit by the thought, and share with you
the benefit. If the ‘human form divine’ be beautified by hoops, being
human I may claim an equal right with you to wear them. For what
reason should my sex debar me from the privilege? Why should you

“IMITATION Is BUT THE SINCEREST ForM of FLATTERY |"
MR. COX ON ENGLISH HISTORY.
Most members of Parliament enliven their little holiday by giving
lectures to their constituents. The mind of MR. Cox, has long been
nobly intent upon a similar pursuit. The young men of Finsbury have
been recently enlightened with his peculiar views upon, English History.
The whole lecture was a great treat. It was given before the assem-
bled intellect of the borough, at the Wat Tyler, abutting Constitution
lace, near the spot where formerly stood the Mechanics' Institute,
which has since been converted into a shooting gallery.
Qur limited space spitefully deprives us of the pleasure of É. the
entire lecture, but the following extracts will suffice to give the reader
a tolerable taste of what the intellectual banquet was like:—
“Gentlemen (began MR. Cox, after smoothing his brow, and
coughing nervously two or three times), it was not until after the
Flood, that WILLIAM the Conqueror sprang }}| the British shore,
exclaiming in his rich Norman dialect, Keni, Vidi, Kici. In a moment
the land, ãº. the iron foot-print of his power, lay like a door-mat
at his feet. He did not abuse his power, for PLINY tells us in his
Commentaries that, might and day he went about searching for the body
of HAROLD, which, greatly owing to the remissness of a bloated
aristocracy (cheers), in not offering a suitable reward for its recovery,
has, like the secret of the authorship of the Letters of Lord Chesterfield,
never been discovered to the present day. We next come to ALFRED,
and the fine picture he presents in history, of selling cakes at three a
penny, which has been so beautifully engraved by WILKIE. This
ing can do when he is driven to earn his bread, as ALFRED was driven
y the ST. CLEMENT DANEs of that dark period, long before Was
invented. (Two cries ºf hear ! hear !). From bread to ACON, the tran-
sition is only natural. It is only in the reign of QUEEN ANNE, of
whose death I take this premature º of giving you the earl
intelligence (a cheer), that we find BAcon in his prime. However,
need not tell you, what must be sufficiently well known to you all,
that the º of BACON is pure gammon. There is no
doubt of that, and so I will not follow the bad taste shown by LADY
BASIL MONTAGUE, and others, in pouring butter upon BACON. (Loud
cheers.) Let us rather follow the flowery meads of Smithfield, and
assing the fires which are blazing there, and one of which afterwards
urnt down three-fourths of the city, run to meet our old favourite,
GUY FAUx. , The city at that time had risen, like a second Venice,
from its ashes. The Battle of Battle fridge had been fought.
CHARLEs had lost his head, at King's Cross. Mosk long ago
retired into a monastery. The political horizon was as black as that of
Manchester, when all of a sudden, Guy FAUxburst upon the astonished
view of the nation, like a meteoric sky-rocket. . He is generally drawn
as alanklanthorn-jawed miscreant, but that, my friends, is only asquib of
the day. I can tell you, Gentlemen, that Guy was a match for an
king. (Long-continued applause.) It is true that he was Hºli.
why? Because he attempted to blow up the House of Lords, as LORD
John RussELL has since done, because they would not admit the Jews
into Parliament. Is LoRD JOHN carried about in a chair? No-his
chairing is always of a more triumphant kind. ... Is straw put into LoRD
John's boots? is a pipe stuck into his mouth? is he compelled to strut
about the streets with a Pope’s cap on his head, a Roman candle in his
hand, and all the Cardinal virtues trampled, like so many oyster-shells
at Billingsgate, under his feet? No-no–no. Then why, I demand,
are, these iniquities put upon poor. Guy, who, in spite of his bein
broken at Tyburn on a Catherine Wheel, is, and ever will be, one o
the most shining lights of the British Čonstitution. (Tremendous
ſº during which the meeting was suspended for ten minutes.) In
the heat of our enthusiasm, we must not forget, HENRY THE EIGHTH.
We may not admire him as a king, but as a husband we are bound to
confess he was first-chop. BLUE BEARD wasn’t a patch upon him. (A
laugh.), He attempted the Lives of the Queens of England, and É.
through several of them, .# before, Miss STRICKLAND ever laid her
hand upon the series. (Sensation.). The four GEORGEs follow in their
due order. They had what I call a Georgeous reign of it. (Another
laugh.) One of them went down at Spithead, but which of the Royal
Georges it was, I should be out o * depth if I attempted to
tell you. No statement should be delivered freely, any more

conspicuous on the front of it. if it were not for accuracy,

wich. The Battle of Waterloo was fought, if I mistake *
during the present century. I am not deceiving you, Gentlemen;
have witnessed it myself, at ASTLEY’s very often... I never saw
NAPOLEON, but I am told that he was something like MR. Gonſers.AL.
WILLIAM THE FourTH has written his name on the Reform Bill, so
º called BILL, because it was carried during his immortal
reign. Our present monarch is HER Most GRACIOUs MAJESTY QUEEN

historical facts are all uniformly correct. I am too much of a lawyer
not to know that ‘What is writ is writ. Service, like practice, makes

A SNEER AND A BLUNDER.
THE advocates of the Sepoys, and advocates of all or any black-
rds and scoundrels who provoke the just ire of everybody else,
ave repeatedly cast an extremely ridiculous taunt against those who
desire that the Indian mutineers should be hanged. “It is all very
well,” they say, “for writers, sitting quietly at their desks to call for
the extermination of the revolted troops.” . Just as if the wish for the
destruction of those wretches would not be rather highly intensified
on the writers' parts, if, instead of sitting quietly at their desks in
England, they were sitting, or standing, or occupying any other posi-
tion of danger from insurgents in India. Probably, gentlemen who sit
quietly at their desks and sympathize with the Sepoy murderers and
torturers of women and babes, would, if situated themselves in peril
of those miscreants, sympathize, rather more than they seem now to
do with the victims of their cruelty.

MARRIAGE AND
ITS DIFFICULTIES.
ATTERLY marriage has be-
come a more perplexing
ceremony than ever. We
from the notices inserted
in the newspapers, which
º, are positively terrifying
in the mysteries they
shadow. The rite ap-
pears to be attended now
with such bewildering
complexity, that one aſ:
most wonders how young
couples can find courage
to confront it. The
boldest-hearted bachelor
must quail at the ordeal
N - he now daily sees de-
scribed, and the strong-
est-minded , of , her sex
must shudder at the knot, when she finds how many terrors are involved in tying
it. Even to ourselves, who are matrimony-proof, the marriage notices occasion a
continual perplexity. As members of society, it is of course incumbent on us
daily to peruse the first half-column of the Times, and for j. sake to take
especial note of the marri rtion of it. To this hard labour we have long
been sentenced, but of late its hardness has so much increased that there is really
some excuse, if we occasionally grumble at it. What with the names of the
officiating and assisting clergymen, and the appendages and * of the bride
and bridegroom, together not unfrequently with those of the distinguished
relatives who were present at the ceremony, we are generally puzzled to know
who has married whom ; and as business men we calculate we lose a daily
average of twelve minutes and three-quarters in our efforts at unravelling the
problems that perplex us.
As a sample of the mysteries which puzzle us at breakfast-time, and sadly inter-
fere with the process of digestion, we beg the reader's notice to the following
advertisement; which, merely altering, the surnames to avoid the charge of
personality, we quote from the Times in its bewildering entirety:
“On the 9th inst., at St. John's, Notting Hill, by the three brothers of the bridegroom, the
REv. John Jones, M.A., the Rev. HENRY Jones, M.A., and the Rev. Robert LANcAstER Jones,
B.A., Tom Jones, Esq., of H.E.I.C.S., third son of the late REv. John Jon Es, D.D., to ANNIE,
youngest daughter of the late John BRow N, Esq., of Birmingham."
Really now, of all the marriages that we can call to mind as ever having startled
us, we think this of Toyſ Jones is perhaps, the one most formidable. We may
certainly º: him on the pluck he has displayed, in braving such a
ceremony as has faintly been depicted: and it, delights us to observe that his
ANNIE is in this respect a most befitting helpmate. Having the foreknowledge of
what she must go through, it showed, we think, uncommon strength of nerve in
her to face it.
Viewed in the most favourable light, it can be no joke being married by three
clergymen: and when the parsons are all brothers, and the brothers of the bride.
groom, there is something in the pomp and circumstance, enough to overwhelm
one. You hear of persons sometimes “marrying a family,” but here are actually
a couple married by a family—or at any rate, we may assume, by far the major
part of one. Supposing even the three reverends the mildest-faced of men, it
must have tried their brother somewhat to confront them at the altar; and to the
lady º were making then their Sister-in-law their aggregate appearance could
not but be formidable. - -- - -
But if it puzzles us to think why these three clergymen attended, it still more
perplexes us to guess how they performed the ceremony: and in behalf of lady
readers, who must share our curiosity, we regret that the report has not supplied
us with full details. As no mention is made of either reverend brother having
principally officiated, while the others, in the usual phrase, “assisted ” at the
service, we infer that each of them had equally a Voice in the matter; still the
question remains open whether they all spoke at, once, or whether each one had a
share of what was to be said allotted him. . In the first º if the service
were a chanted one, the “organs” of the trio might have blended with advantage:
but the notice in the paper being silent on the point, we must perforce regard it as
a moot one. - -
Although we own it somewhat puzzles us, we are quite disposed to view the
presence of the parsons as a mark of unadulterated brotherly affection. But the
cynical are not so clemently inclined, and might assign the meanest motives for
the brethren all appearing in their bands, . It might be argued by such people, that
something like a “scene” was intended to be got up, and that the supernume-
raries appeared to add to the affect: or it might be said that, the Divorce Bill having
recently been passed, it was fancied that three clergymen perhaps might make the
nuptial knot a triply tight one. -
É. ourselves, we have a horror of such, mean imputations. But although
perhaps the brothers showed their faces at the ceremony just to show that the
completely countenanced the match, we really think it was a waste of work for all
of them to do the service. There cannot be more firmness in the bonds of matri-
mony from this 3-parson power being used to clench, them, and therefore in
this extra “benefit of clergy” there can be, at least as far as we can judge it, no
advantage.

Why, a Girl might be as thin as a Whipping post,

THE SUGAR-MARKET.
MR. ANToNY Wospe, after a long-continued tiff with his wife, in
which he has clearly confessed himself to be in the wrong, took her to
the Adelphi Theatre, on Saturday evening, at half-price. The happy
pair, after mutually agreeing that “they had spent a remarkably
pleasant evening,” returned home for supper. Oysters were laid for
two. Nothing was wanting to complete the harmony of the entertain-
ment. The baby was fast asleep, and the beer had been fetched most
fortunately only the minute before “The Widow’s Struggle” closed
for the night. -
Mrs. Poppets has only the wing of a butterfly to finish to complete
the beautiful pair of braces she is embroidering for her “dear duck of
a husband,” Joshua. They are to be presented to Pop PETs, after tea,
on the 30th, in commemoration of their nineteenth wedding day. MRs.
Poppets has already prepared a most ingenious device to induce Joshua
to take off his coat, the better to enable her to put on the braces her-
self, in presence of the assembled company. e water-rate collector
(to whom two years’ arrears are owing) has been invited.
MR. GeoRGE FREDERIck Spunge sent the barrel of oysters to his
rich uncle only yesterday, week. He has not as yet received the
customary invitation for Christmas Day, but he is expecting it every
post. The bank-note, that is usually folded up inside the napkins of a

been promised to not less than nine different tradesmen. MR. GEORGE

The Critic of the Learned Pig had a friendly ºf with the REVEREND
ALFRED Sophºre SAwpers one day this week. The º lasted three
hours, and did the greatest honour to the cuisine of the Talleyrand
Club. The Critic was good-natured enough to express his unqualified
admiration of the wine. We see that a new book of poems (A Wreath
ºf Orange Blossoms) by the gashing Reverend is announced as “Nearly
teady.” By the merest accident the learned author had a º of the
Poems in his pocket, and, with many compliments, presented, it after
the third bottle to his “dear and .# friend,” who, not being in
the best state to appreciate its beauties then, quietly put it into his
pocket. Before parting, an early day was fixed for another dinner to
discuss the merits of the book, when the amiable Critic promised to
favour the accomplished author with his candid opinion on the Orange
Blossoms.
As the New Year is approaching, the laundress of MR. SREENE
FLINT, the well-known conveyancer of Thavies' Inn, redoubles in her
attentions and kindness to her aged master. , Yesterday, he had a
basin of Irish stew for his luncheon. The windows have been cleared
of a considerable portion of their dirt. The dust is by no means so
º about, the room, nor has the diminution been at all obtained

about the room, into hopeless confusion. The laundress knows only
too well that it is M.R. SKEENE FLINT's most sensitive horror (next

has wisely refrained from laying a profane finger on any one of them.

glance, if you let lodgings, to the following advertisement, w
inserted for your benefit in the Times a few days since:–
APARTMEN TS WANTED, viz.:-A Sitting and Bed Room, with use
of Piano, by a gentleman engaged in the City. Must be in the house of a
professional or that of a private musical family, where a lady would take the trouble
to instruct the advertiser on the pianoforte: in the latter case board would not be
objected to, where a good table is kept and inmates cheerful. Address, with terms,
and full particulars, to DELTA, care of Messrs. Asterisk & Blank, No. 0, Dash Street,
near Circle Square.
The wording is slightly ambiguous in this, but it is clear at any
rate that DELTA has not been deterred by diffidence from stating what
he wishes. There is a coolness quite cucumbrian in his asking to be
let into the bosom of a private family, where he would just trouble
some kind lady to teach him the piano, gratis; for the phrase, “take
the trouble,” quite prohibits our believing that he has * thought of
º: his instructress. Then, mark how finely he distinguishes
etween mere professionals and really private people. Only in the
latter case will he sit at table with the inmates. Nay, even here again
his diffidence deserts him, and he imposes the condition that the table
must be “good,” and the inmates “cheerful.” Only on these terms
will he condescend to their society. Good livers they must be, an
º companions every one,” or they must not hope for the pleasure
of his company. Unless they live like fighting-cocks, and are of good
cheer in their hearts as well as their cuisine, he will shut himself up in
his “sitting and bedroom” (we are doubtful if he means by this one
or two apartments), and will hold himself aloof from all except his
music mistress.
As we like to study “characters,” we have been speculating some-
what deeply with ourselves for near five seconds, as to what, this
DELTA can be guessed to be. His engagement in the City, and, his
fondness for good living, are properties which might be viewed as
aldermanic; but our fancy fails to picture an alderman in lodgings
and º: the piano! Perhaps he is a wretched valetudinarian, an
has been prescribed good dinners, and a little * exercise on the
piano for an appetite. Or, it may be he’s in love, and to test, the
strength of his affections, the fair º: of them may perhaps
have forbidden him her presence until he can play her a tune on the
piano. Reduced to this “most musical, most melancholy” plight, no
yonder, he should crave good, dinners to sustain him, as well as
“cheerful inmates” to revive his dropping spirits. . It sounds very
well in poetry to say that music is the food of love: but in real life, a
man, however love-sick he may be, wants something more than a piano
for his dinner. In the way of nutriment it would be found an “airy
nothing,” though it is not a wind instrument. All the airs that could
be played on it would fail to satisfy an appetite, even were they
HANPEI’s, which we have heard called “the roast beef of music.”
Life let us Cherish is a commonly shared sentiment, but playing it on
the piano would not much promote the end it inculcates: nor would
there be much stimulant in º of Brandy, if they were drunk in b
* alone, and poured out from a BROADwood instead of a blac
ottle.
But, whatever be the reasons which have induced this Nice Young
Man (or older one) to advertise himself as desirous of becoming a
small musical party, we should caution his respondents to think twice
about the “terms” on which they would receive him... A good appe-
tite peeps out in the demand of a good table, and besides his turn for
music, they may be assured that he has also a good twist. Although
ignorant as yet of º the piano, depend on it he knows how to
play a knife and fork: and as a prelude to his “morceaur de concert.”
would indulge in several morceaua de mouton, or other choice tit-bits.
Indeed, should º lady “take the trouble to instruct him,” we have
very little doubt that she would find she had a sinecure, so far, at least
as teaching him the Exercise of Cranmer.
DARING CRITICISM ON A NOBLEMAN.
WE, have more than once, latterly, had occasion to remark on the
great improvement manifested by our fashionable contemporary. The
following paragraph, which º in that journal, the other day,
. a great advance in the manner of chronicling the acts of
noblemen:-
“The EARL of HARRowby on THE INDIAN MUTINY and the State of the
ARMY.-At the Annual Dinner of the Sandon and Marston Agricultural Society, at
Sandon, on Wednesday, the RIGHT Hon. THE EARL of HARRowby, in proposing
the toast of the “Army and Navy,” spoke at considerable length on the existing
state of affairs in India. Lord HARRowby's observations were not remarkable for
any peculiarity or force, but were of a purely general and common-place character."
In the critical remark which concludes the above announcement
there is a freedom and independence of tone which could not be sur-
passed by the most democratic journal in New York. At the same
time there is nothing offensive in it; nothing, at least, at which the
EARL of HARRow BY can take offence, unless, he is a vain man. In
that case, indeed, his appetite for breakfast the other morning may
have been somewhat impaired by finding his observations ãescribed as
“not remarkable for any peculiarity or force,” and as being of a “ ".
general and common-place character.” There are not a few gentlemen
whose muffin would be embittered, egg disrelished, coffee, deprived of
aroma, milk soured, and morning repast altogether spoiled, by the
sight of a report of their speech so summary, and of remarks thereupon
so compendious and unflattering as the above. But an Earl can afford
to laugh at any criticism, however severe; nor, if he is a reasonable
nobleman, will anything of the kind occasion him to quarrel with his
bread-and-butter, whilst he exults in the reflection that the butter on
the bread, and on both sides of it, is spread thick; and that no critic,
however savage, is able to scrape it anythinner.
CURATES AND THEIR PROPRIETORS.
THE clerical instructors of the British Public are accustomed
frequently to reprove their hearers for making too much haste to be
rich. Some of those divines may not themselves be chargeable with
going too fast, in the º of wealth, º because they have no
occasion to be in any hurry. The annual value of the ecclesiastical
d|property attached to the perpetual curacy of St. Cuthbert, in the
city of Carlisle, is upwards of £1,500; of St. Mary, in the same city,
£1,000: of Hesket, Éilio); and of Warwick and Wetheral £1,600.
The respective stipends of these curacies are £5.6s. 8d., £6, £18 5s.
and £52. These facts are set forth in a memorial from landowners an
others, presented by the Justices of the Cumberland Quarter Sessions
to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Have those Magistrates, at their
Sessions, any rogues to punish more nefarious and impudent than
those who sack so much Church prºperty, and allow their Curates such
shamefully small shares of the swag;
Puzzling Announcement.
ADMIRAL BERKELEY, having succeeded to his Castle, is succeeded,
at the Admiralty, by ADMIRAL DUNDAs, who succeeded in the Baltic,
ADMIRAL NAPIER, who succeeded—No, no, that must be a mistake.

“CAUTION.—Sufferers are cautioned against a quack who advertises in the
medicines by unprincipled vendors, who thereby obtain a large profit. To protect

The above quotation sufficiently proves that there is one quack who
advertises in the advertiser's street, but does not prove, but only
intimates, that there is another. We do not, however, print it for the
purpose of making that remark, nor yet for that of suggesting to those
whom it may concern, that the recommendation of “unprincipled

other quack medicines. Qur object is to point Qut to LORD PALMER-

A NICE WET DAY.
How delighted I am when it rains !
The more so the harder it pours;
If business on that day constrains
Myself to remain within doors.
Come down, cats and dogs! I exclaim;
With pleasure I view your descent.
sº now a walk were my aim,
could not fulfill my intent.
I could not, with Fashion attired,
I am accustomed to be,
In Regent Street figure, admired,
By every fair maiden I see.
I could not be seen in the Park,
For I should be drenched if I were;
Besides, you will justly remark,
Because no one else would be there.
Montgom BRY wants to go out,
And appetite earn for his grub;
And MoWTAGUE can’t get about,
Confined by the wet in his club;
And BUGGINs, together with them,
Strong language applies to the rain,
Which I not only do not condemn,
But approve of, whilst others complain.
Of exercise WILKINsoN makes
A point—there is wisdom in that—
And his long constitutional takes,
All the while he is spoiling his hat.
My fingers are grasping the pen,
ſy person is fixed in the chair;
I’m obliged to stay in—but what then P
My hat still remains fit to wear. .
Some fellows the wet to defy,
Are forced by their urgent affairs;
Of cabs, if they wish to keep dry,
The frightful expense must be theirs.
No cab-hire have I to disburse,
Or else catch a cold in the nose,
And suffer invasion of purse,
Or tantamount damage in clothes.
Then let it rain heavily on,
The tempest however sever

Till this day and my work are both done 3

At least that is what I should say,

THE SURPLICE AT THE FOOTLIGHTS.
MR. PUNCH has observed an announcement to the following effect:-
“It is intended, very soon, to commence a series of Special Sunday Services at
some of the Metropolitan Theatres. Notice will be given when the arrangements
are complete.”
Now this may be a hoax, invented by some member of the Puseyite
persuasion, indignant that hierarchs should preach in Exeter Hall. If
so, let him enjoy the bitterness of his satire. But, if the announce-
ment be of a Bonafidian character, Mr. Punch has a word or two to
say upon the proposal.
. There can be but one object in offering to perform a religious service
in buildings erected for, and specially adapted to amusement. There
is, no want, of church or chapel accommodation in the localities in
which the theatres are situate. St. Martin’s is near the Haymarket,
St. Clement Danes is not far from the Olympic, and Pope’s couplet
disposes of MR. E. T. SMITH's neighbourhood,
“Now, so ANNE and piety ordain,
A church collects the saints of Drury Lane.”
A very big church is a very few yards from the Victoria, and a huge
chapel near the Surrey; St. Paul, of Covent Garden, is the patron
saint of the Adelphi, and, as for the city, it has three theatres and fifty
places of worship. Ergo, it is not for want of room that it is proposed
to turn the theatre into a church. The idea, of course, is that the
novelty of the thing may attract those who are not habitual frequenters
of the sacred edifice.
But Mr. Punch º to ask, (with the sincerest reverence for the
subject involved, and with earnest respect for all who labour con-
scientiously in the matter) where is this kind of thing to end? If our
clergy, with all their advantages of education, prestige, and position,
cannot get the people into church, and therefore are obliged to ask
them to come to the theatre, where will the attraction system stop?
After a time, the mere novelty of seeing a minister of religion declaim-
j% the spot where a few hours earlier a danseuse exhibited her skill,
will fail to “draw.” It is not so very exciting to call your pew a
rivate box, that the pleasure of doing so will long attract. To hear
Mose in Egitto or the Prophète, on Saturday, and on Sunday, in the
same place, to listen to Moses and the Prophets, will not long retain
its charm. And if attractions are to be the rule, you must devise
something new to bring the º in. How far are you prepared to
go? Will you, having called the theatre to your aid, avail yourself of
its resources? Will you borrow scenic aid, and while a preacher talks
of Palestine will you have a moving diorama from DAVID ROBERTs:
Or will you go still further, and employ other theatrical arts—as MR.
MooRE puts it, shall
“DANIEL, in pantomime, bid bold defiance
To NEBUCHADNEzzAR and all his stuffed lions,
While pretty young Israelites dance round the prophet,
In very thin clothing, and so little of it?”
There is really no logical reason for halting when once you admit the
validity of the plea on which the use of the theatre for purposes utterly
foreign to its objects and associations is justified.
There is something wrong, when contrivances like these are required
by our priesthood. Had they not better reconsider the matter, and
before invading the temples of the drama, examine whether their own
temples are so thoroughly in order that throngs of votaries may
reasonably be expected there. The theatre is not the place for sermons,
and those who took Orders at Lambeth Palace, o #. not to be seen
taking them at a free-list entrance. As Clifford exclaims in Henry P.I.
“Chaplain—away !”

AN IMPUDENT JEW.
MR. “Jo. Joseph, a general shopkeeper, of the Hebrew persuasion,”
would seem to consider that as he is not permitted to be a legislator,
he may indemnify himself by criticism on the laws that are made for
him, and the judges who administer them. The other day, MR. Jo., if
the police-report in a four-farthing contemporary be correct (which, by
the way, we don’t guarantee to be the case), did bring a poor woman
named KENDALL before MR. SELFE, because he, Joseph, had lately
missed two spoons, two sheets, and what he probably called a veskit.
As these articles were left in an open box, and KENDALL, as charwoman,
came in and out of the room in which it was kept, it was clear to
Joserſ the Ebrew that she must have taken them. "The accused cried,
and declared her innocence, and, we quote the report, remarked: “That
wicked Jew wants to send me to prison.” But the evidence that
satisfied Jo. Joseph would not, satisfy the earigeant MR. SELFE, who
came out with the following observation, to the discomfiture of the
ebrew:—
“There is no evidence at all against her.
She ought not to have been taken into
ustody at all. She is discharged.
I tell you what, MR. Jo. Joseph, you are liable
to have an action for false imprisonment brought against you.”
Upon this the enraged shopkeeper charged the Magistrate with
being mistaken, and reiterated that the accused was the thief.
MR. SELFE, however, retained his opinion, and said—
“There is not a tittle of evidence against her, MR. Jo. Joseph. You have done
very wrong, and more respect should be paid to the liberty of the subject. The
poor woman has been deeply wronged, and is discharged.”
But the pertinacious Jew was not finished off. He would have the
last word, and (according to the report) he made his exit, observing—
“The Law ith ath good as the Judge ith bad.”
For which piece of impertinence, MR. SELFE, if he heard it, should
have locked up the Jew until he made a penitent appeal for pardon.
Even Shylock, who had really a good case, and was scandalously
treated by the quibbling Christians, complimented his judge, and
behaved himself like a gentlemanly Hebrew. , But really, that Jo.
JoSEPH, having committed a gross wrong, should be permitted to be
insolent to the Magistrate, is a little too good. However, if a decent
attorney will take MR, SELFE’s hint, and present Jo. with an instru.
ment inviting him to have the question re-considered, at the suit of
|. MRs. KENDALI, the punishment which he earned in Court may
e administered in the way best calculated to touch his feelings. As
he thinks Christian law so good, it would be liberal to let him have a
little more of it. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CORPORATION ITSELF AGAIN.
ANY persons thought the conventional
idea of the LoRD MAYOR and the
Aldermen was beginning to be regarded
as a vulgar error. The motion that they
were especially addicted to venison
and turtle was taking a place amongst
opular fallacies. To suppose them to
e particularly fat, and peculiarly prone
to those indulgences, which produce
corpulence, namely eating and drinking,
was fast getting regarded as a mistake
evincing a want of sharpness and
practical knowledge; an innocence and
a greenness. Many a fond lover of
comic antiquity was i. to an ap-
prehension that the burlesque glory of
Guildhall and the Mansion-house was
departing. There remained, to be sure,
Bar, and Gog and MAGog, to rebuke
their despondency; nevertheless it was
a fact that the civic monarch and the
civic nobility were occasionally, if not
often, to be heard, talking wisely, and
even grammatically; not necessarily
misjoining sin and plural, con-
founding v with to, and omitting or
superadding h. Reflecting minds were
entertaining serious anxiety for the con-
servation of that ludicrous element, the
ancient, venerable, endearing, and pecu.
liar characteristic of the corporation o
London. All who may have been in-
fluenced by these melancholy misgivings
will derive a most comfortable reas-
surance from a short report lately given
by the Eraminer of a discussion which
- had just occurred among the Aldermen,
under the LoRD MAYOR in Court assembled. It is headed:–
PITIFUL conDITION OF THE COURT OF ALDERMEN.
|Under this affecting title, it informs the sympathizing reader that
“The following interesting conversation took place on Tuesday in the Court of
Alſºº MAYor. This reminds me of a matter of privilege. The Crown has
each year been in the habit of sending eight bucks to the Lord MAYor. This year
I have not had them, although I have applied for them. (Laughter.)"
There, was a time, perhaps, when the LoRD MAYOR’s statement
that he had not received the venison which he expected and had asked
for, would not have been taken as a joke, and hailed with laughter.
However, the Aldermen may, though really viewing their disappoint-
ment as no joke, have determined to bear it with forced good humour.
In the same apparently merry mood they received the similar com-
plaint of one of their brethren:—
“ALDERMAN Rose. I never had the bucks to which I was entitled forwarded to ºne
when I was Sheriff. (Laughter.)”
The LoRD MAYoF and ALDERMAN Rose, however, appear to have
stated their grievances with becoming gravity; and ALDERMAN COPE-
LAND followed them on the same subject, evidently impressed with a
due sense of its importance:-
* ALDERMAN CoPELAND. It is a well-known fact that the Aldermen are very fond
of venison, and therefore it is hard to cut it off.”
The inference is a logical touch of pathos. “It is hard to cut it off!”
This, º regarded, appears to be the mournful exclamation of some
meek an patient sufferer: but ALDERMAN CoPELAND is no such
spoony. No, Sir; the worthy Alderman suggests reprisals:-
“The Corporation is in the habit of providing livery for the Officers of State, and
I would suggest, that as they have stopped the venison, we should stop the clothing.
(Much laughter, and ‘No, no '').”
Gog and MAGog, on this occasion, seem to have been ago
and would not listen with the solemnity which the topic #.
So the LoRD MAYor was obliged to insist upon it.
“The Lorn Mayor. The REcoRDER says he has never had his three bucks.”
This remark brought up the RECORDER; and that learned gentle-
man certainly evinced an adequate sense of the weightiness of the

matter in question. He pronounced the following judicial opinion:-
“It is, perhaps, important that it should be known that this is not a mere pri:
vilege granted, but it is an absolute right. Formerly the Citizens of London had
the right of hunting in the Royal forests, and it was then agreed that in lieu of
their hunting in the Royal forests, a certain amount of venison should be sent to
the officers of the Corporation. Therefore, this was compounding a legal right
which the officers of the Corporation possess. . It is not a mere gift of the Crown;
but it is a composition in lieu of an ancient right. (Hear, Hear.)"
the Lord-Mayor's Show, and Temple
f| has to issue tickets for the up and
The above reads partly like a legal opinion, and partly like a legend
related by a forester, in a melodrama. It suggests an idea of the
learned speaker attired, as to one half of his person, in official wig and
gown, knee shorts, black silks, shoes and buckles; and bedizened, as
to the other, with hat, and feathers, green braided tunic and breeches,
and russet boots, and a girdle, with a horn in it and a hanger at it,
half round the waist. It also causes imagination to picture to itself
London citizens stag-hunting in the Royal Forests—John GILPIN
associated with SIR. WALTER TYRREL–and conjures up a vision of
the horse and his civic rider, too extremely #iº. to be further
dwelt upon without pain,
It is worthy of note that the LoRD MAYor expected eight bucks,
Alderman Rose more than one, and the RECQRDER three. , Hence
arises a question, which never perhaps occurred before; namely, How
many fat bucks is a Lord Mayor, an Alderman, or a Recorder, capable
of eating up in a season F. Waiving this, however, let us rejoice in the
above-quoted specimen of the discussions of the Court of Aldermen.
Taken in connection with the altercation which lately took place on the
|º between two of those dignitaries about an allusion to tallow
which one of them thought personal, it affords hope that the good old
times of the city are not yet gone.
A PRODIGY IN AN HUMBLE STATION.
ANY gentleman desirous of losing his life without appearing to
"...} it by his own act, so as not to incur the suspicion of suicide
should travel, backwards, and forwards, by rail between Banbury and
Oxford, until he meets with a fatalaccident—at least, if dependence is
to be placed on the statement of the writer of a letter in the Times,
signed A. A., who avers that—
“At the Kirtlington Road Station (a small one, no doubt) between Banbury and
Oxford, one man, and one man º: has every day to do the following duty :-He
own trains, frequently coming and going close
together: he has six signals to attend to, and four pair of points; to attend to all
passengers' luggage, and to receive all parcels, to collect tickets, to carry a lamp in
the evening half a mile on each side of the Station, his office and signals in the
meantime being left without any one; he has also to weigh up coal for the company
and to load the corn-trucks. . He has also to put any horses and carriages
on the rails.”
The description of this individual's ordinary avocation reads like an
account in our sporting contemporary of one of those feats which are
performed for a wager, and which, consist in running so many miles
and in the meanwhile picking up a lot of stones with the mouth, an
doing a number of other almost impossible, things. Railway station-
master and railway station man-of-all-work, this person must be a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO GOLIGHTLY TEAZLE, ESQ., M.A.,
Of the Saturday Review.
YRTAEUs,” of the Sa-
turday Review, of Oc-
tober 24th, informs
us of the sudden
and alarming indis-
position MR.
l, GoLIGHTLY TEAZLE,
|| wherefore Mr. Punch
presents his compli-
ments to that afflict-
ed gentleman, and
in acknowledgment
of his exertions as an
operator secundum
artem or secundum
artes, as the diploma
runs, Mr. Punch un-
dertakestoprescribe
for him gratis.
Mr. Punch has the
more confidence in
dealing with his case
as experience recalls
to him many similar.
- There is the case
of A., who received a corporal chastisement, and who was in consequence
riven insane by an imputation on his second cousin. There is the case
of B., who relieved a painful corn by applying a dozen leeches to the
foot of her bedstead. And there is the case of C., who received a con-
tusion on the nose, and who extracted the bruise by a blister on his os
sacrum. These are cases in point, and Mr. Punch has great pleasure in
making a note of them to console MR. TEAZIE., If Mr. Punch is right
as to MR.T.’s constitution, it is by momeans liable to the serious attack
of which he complains. It is quite out of the question that he could
suffer from verbum sapienti, because for this there must be a predis-
position in the patient, which Mr. Punch does not recognise in the case
of MR. TEAZLE.
Nothing is more common, as Mr. Punch observes, than for a patient
to mistake the nature of his own disorder, and so in this instance MR.
TEAZLE supposes that, he is touched in the region of the heart by a
verium sapienti, when the true seat of his discomfort is somewhere else,
probably in a less vital and delicate part of his organism. It is true
that, by what DR. MARSHALL HALL designated the reflex action of
the nerves of sensation, the symptoms of Yi. TEAZLE do, no doubt,
bespeak, a very considerable cerebral irritation. “ $º:
folly,” “bigotry,” “imbecility,” “miserable doggerel,” “brutality,”
“irreverence,” “dirty,” “nauseous,”, “contemptible,” “pitiful
drivel,” “professional buffoons,” “beslobber,” and the like, indicate
a foul state of the tongue, and disclose the existence of a lurking fever
in the system.
Mr. Punch is the more concerned for MR. Tº AZLE, as such symp-
toms incapacitate him for the performance of his functions as the calm
monitor and critic of the vulgar “middle classes.” The air of superior
refinement and º: which is requisite for this office is, thus oblite-
rated, and MR. TEAZLE, like one of the coarse middle-classes them-
selves, is betrayed into motions of an expansive nature, which ruffle
his shirt-front, disorder his neckcloth, entail a larger outlay for starch
on his washerwoman, and in the meantime impair his influence with
polite society. -
Mr. Punch must not only take into account the detriment to MR.
TEAZLE and the wax-lights of literature, but the encouragement to
those greasy and illiterate persons whom the bad taste of the public
has rendered so offensively popular. There is no doubt that some of
these low people will be encouraged in consequence to think less
deferentially of their Saturday Reviewers. Hitherto they have ag-
|...} as far as they were capable of understanding it, in the esoteric
octrine of the Eton Philosopher—ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes
emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros., But if the mastery of arts is combine
with such manners as these, and has so little influence on the irrita-
bility of the initiated, the reverence for Masters of Arts will decrease
simultaneously with the general loss of confidence in the Latin Syntax
and its examples, till by-and-by even a Popjºy Prizeman will come to
be thought of little more account than the “serial” scribblers who
write for the world at large, and for whom the fact that their writings
are popular affords a presumption that they are contemptible.
Mr. Punch is so concerned for the º consequences, that
he wishes MR. Teazle to be instantly bled, and the refined extract
to be preserved in a Dresden China Wase for a regular analysis by the
College of Physicians.
In the meantime, apart from the immediate cause of the complaint,
and the nature of which Mr. Punch understands perfectly, he is inclined
to attribute much of the consequent irritation to the circumstances of
MR. TEAZLE's early diet and nurture. If it is true that MR.T. was
. upon pickles, in Mr. Punch's opinion the vinegar is still in his
system.
But Mr. Punch will pay § attention to MR. TEAZLE's case, and
hopes shortly to report favourably on his progress.
THE CRACKING OF BIG BEN.
Who cracked the Bell?
‘‘I,’” says John Bull,
“Because I'm a fool:
And I cracked the Bell.”
O BULL, you’re a Booby. You’d got a fine Bell,
A thing that did credit to HALL and to WARNER,
And stupidly eager for toll and for knell,
You stick up your Bell to be banged in a corner.
And why so impatient, and why could you not
. Till the Bell was in place condescend just to tarry?
You’ve cracked it, in two senses sent it to pot,
And the tower must be dumb, to the fury of BARRY.
You can’t make a statue, no more could old Rome,
Who vaunted that “others might model the brasses”
(See Wirgil, lib. vi., where each schoolboy's at home,
And every one else, except ignorant asses).
But when alii had mollins practised their skill,
Not even the Romans, so clumsy and comky,
Went pounding the aera spirantia, until
The “breath” came through cracks, as you’ve done, you
old donkey.

AN UNFORTUNATE OBSERVATION.
MR. HAMILTON NISBET, that great landed Squire and Protectionist
has been abusing the London shopkeepers. The ox of Protection has
been heard to speak often enough, but has never, hitherto, proclaimed
himself an ox. M.R. NISBET, however, has done something even worse
than that. He calls the shopkeepers of London “butchers going
to cut the throats of the landed interest.” In this remark, does not
MR. NISBET, as a member of the landed interest, appear to express an
apprehension of being converted into weal?
SO MOST PEOPLE THINK.
WHEN BIshop BERKELEY raised the cry “No Matter,”
He used two words than which no answer’s patter
When the existing BERKELEYs scrawl, or chatter.
A BELL FoR BEDLAM.–Poor Big Ben is cracked. His case is
hopeless, and he ought to be sent to an Asylum.

KEYS OF MYSTERY.
E have no wish to be
thought of a Paul-
Prying disposition,
or desirous to pro-
trude our nasal fea-
ture into secrets of
the State, but we
must say we feel
femininely curious
to learn why the
QUEEN can never
travel in her own
dominions, without
having to pull up at
every city that she
comes to, and re-
ceive a bunch of
keys from the hands
of the authorities.
At Aberdeen the
other day, the chro-
niclers inform us:—
“A magnificent arch
was erected at the
boundary, and here the
ceremony of presenting
the keys of the City
was performed: the
| LoRD PRovost, in a few loyal sentences, bidding HER MAJESTY welcome, and the
| QUEEN expressing gratification at being once more in the City of Aberdeen.”
Now, as far as the loyalty and welcome are concerned, we can see
no cause to quarrel with this ceremony; but the presentation of the
keys is now a meaningless absurdity, which we are quite sure could
not have “gratified.” HER MAJESTY. When cities had walls, and
city keys, had locks to them, there might have been some sense in
handing them to royalty; but we regard the ceremony now as an effete
superfluity, a piece of mere theatricalism which must annoy the QUEEN
and, indeed, is only fit for the Princess's. Of course we shall be told
that the custom is an “ancient” one, and that loyalty and homage
are implied in the observance of it; but to modern minds these ancient
customs are of questionable import, and partake rather more of nuisance
than advantage.
It really seems ridiculous that in this boasted age of Progress
the QUEEN should be arrested by these key-presenting, Provosts
who seize on her like button-holders, with their small talk an
inanities. It is time the royal road were cleared of these infesters,
who do not hesitate to stop the QUEEN upon her own highway; and,
Hºf keys like pistols rob her of some golden minutes every time
they catch her. Paying them attention is as bad as paying turnpikes,
and the QUEEN .# be relieved of all such taxes on her patience.
Of course etiquette demands that she should “express her gratifica-
tion’ at these trials of her temper, but we believe that the QUEEN’s
English of her speech is something different. Every time she has to
stop to have some City keys presented to her, we can imagine HER
MAJESTY saying to herself, “Don’t come stopping me, you tiresome
men. Go away, do : and take away those Baubles!”
The ceremony, too, is the more absurdly stupid, as the keys are
“ presented” only to be handed back again. How the QUEEN can be
gratified by this inane anomaly, it is only for the minds of Corporations
to conceive. Were she to express her thanks for it, she could not use
a truer phrase than “Thank you, gentlemen, for nothing.”. Of course
ywhen one’s presented with a thing, one naturally expects that one will
be allowed to keep it; and although bunches of keys are somewhat
troublesome ironmongery, we really should; insist, if we were HER
MAJESTY, upon Qur clear right to pocket all that were presented to
Us. It is true that keeping keys is a source of great anxiety (the
wear and tear of mind from the mislaying of our own turns, we quite
believe, at least a dozen hairs grey weekly), still the QUEEN might
have a keeper of her keys as of her conscience: in fact, at no great
rise of salary, LoRD CRAN worTH would, no doubt, consent to act in
both capacities. -
In cases were the keys were, as at Aberdeen, of silver, we should
ourselves, were we HER MAJESTY, be still more disposed to keep
them; for although of neither use nor ornament as keys, We, might
get them melted into tea-spoons, and so enrich Our royal plate-basket.
The keys might, then be looked on in the light of royal perquisites,
and there would be some consolation for the stopping to receive them.
As it is, their presentation-recalled as soon as made-amounts only
to the giving of the airiest of nothings: in fact, is what CARLYLE would
term, a Windbag, to which nothing that we kn - -
of usefulness. -
If the custom be persisted in (and these ancient ones die hard), we
ow of can give an air
that any keys when presented should be considered given out and out.
It would however be still more an amendment of the matter, if a bunch
of grapes were substituted for the bunch of keys. The presentation of
a pound or so of juicy cool Black Hambro' would be a graceful act of
homage to HER MAJESTY when travelling; and a much more refreshing
ceremony to stop for, than the presentation of some tasteless specimens
of metal-work; We are not in general rabidly utilitarian, but in this
matter of the keys we feel certainly disposed to ask, What can be the
use of it? and till some one solves the mystery, as we consider it
affects HER MAJESTY's convenience, we shall jã ourselves excused
for feeling so key-urious.
LEARNING AND POLITENESS.
IF. Latin, and Greek are meant by the ingenuous arts which, ac-
cording to the parliamentary quotation in the Eton Grammar, soften
men's minds and do not suffer them to be brutal, the quotation is at
fault, and should cease, to be made in the House of Commons, the
Mansion House, and elsewhere. Scholars, engaged in any dispute
about words, have always been peculiarly abusive; and some of the
disputants in the late
exemplified this characteristic of the scholastic mind. Short of calling
possible. It is very odd that
found associated with Greek and Latin—that proficiency in those two
particular dead languages, should so frequently be combined with
insolence. The want of classical º e is sometimes ascribed
to the circumstance that the deficient individual was not properly
whipped, but the possession of it seems to be frequently accompanied
with a very serious need of horsewhipping.
TITE BARNACLE'S CUR.
THE cur that on a recent grave
Betrayed his nature’s failing,
Continues still to misbehave,
And kicks invite by railing.
What earnestness of would-be scorn!
What eagerness in ...i.

Was his tail trodden on, one day?
His ear, all sore with canker,

APROPOS OF THE GREAT BONNET OUESTION.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
- “I AM delighted to see that the Reviews are, at last,
beginning to give their attention to really important subjects. The last
h'estminster for instance, has an article on Female Dress, which I hope
will be followed by others on ‘Housekeeping,’ ‘Cookery,’ ‘The
present treatment of Wives by Husbands,’ and so on. ese are
matters which really come home to people's businesses and bosoms.

of-the-way matters, as now fill up two-thirds of all the Quarterlies.
They are all very well for the men who write them, because they have
got up the subject, and like to show off.
“But if the publishers want to sell a hundred copies of their reviews
for one, they should take up things that everybody knows something
about, or Qught to know something about. They ought, to have more
lady contributors, like the authoress of that article in the Westminster
upon ‘Dress.” 1 I complain of is, that the subject is too cursorily
treated. You can’t deal with Dress as a whole in a single paper. You
want one article for the Bonnet alone, and another for the Mantle, and
another for the Morning Gown, and another for Evening Dress, and
so forth. So as to complete the female wardrobe, perhaps, in twelve
articles.
“Take the Bonnet for example. Only think what a range the reviewer
ought to traverse to exhaust that...Why to deal with ‘the Bonnet'
alone in a way commensurate with its importance, would take volumes
instead of a single article, much less a few paragraphs of an article. I

in the drawings I send with this letter—we were wearing round hats, which we thought very
becoming; but we found to our astonishment that it was considered quite improper to go to

“Now I wish to ask you, Mr. Punch, to compare No. 1 and No. 2 of the accompanying

Cheering for the Spanish Bondholders.
It seems that the great man of the new Spanish Ministry is our old friend Mon. We do
not think that Mon will feel comfortable, or be able to do justice to himself as well as others,
until he gets Ton by his side. We all know if there is a greater characteristic than another
of a Spanish Ministry it is, its special talent for looking after the Meum and Tuum ; and Mon
and TöN, we imagine, will be an agreeable suggestion of the fate that is in store for Le Mien
| and Le Tien. That is decidedly the Alpha and Omega of a Spanish Ministry. Every other
; interest is a complete dead letter.

Against our wish and will.

We ask that BoMBA would our case
To open trial bring;
Against that claim he sets his face,

Has England nothing like a fleet,
And no such things as guns,
To teach a tyrant not to treat
In such a sort, her sons?

And Otho knuckled down.

A MUSICAL RECEPTION.—When the whale was stranded

WE CAN’T MAKE A BRIDGE.
WE can’t make a monument, and now it seems we can’t make a
bridge. A poor simple suspension bridge is completely above us... It
is worth while walking down to St. James's Park, merely to see how
clever we are in making a failure. All lovers of the grotesque should
make the muddy pilgrimage. If a prize had been offered for an ugly
bridge, we doubt if a finer specimen could have been selected than the
one which rears its puny head over the ornamental water at the old
spot, where the ferryman used to feather his oar with so much dex-
terity. Surely, ornamental water deserved a bridge with some pre:
tensions to ornament. As it is, we believe a long plank, stretched
across, would have been less stuck up, and far more ornamental. The
worst is that, since the water has been purified, you have the hideous-
mess twice over. Not only do you have the eyesore above, but
the bright reflection of it, also, below. The advantage of this im-
provement is, that you have two eyesores instead of one. . It lies so
squat on the water (as though it were taking a sitz-bath), that the
poor birds can hardly swim underneath it. Some of the swans have
to see them with their throats wrapped u
already got stiff necks, from stooping so continually to avoid receiving
a knock on the head it would not astonish us, as the winter advances,
in flannel; an aged swan,
with an old stocking tied round its neck, would certainly be a most
moving object of sympathy.
We suppose we shall get accustomed, in time, to this new disfigure-
ment of our mutilated metropolis, as we have done to others of a
Kindred ugliness; but it is very trying at first. To complete the
mockery, we hope that a board will be put up with the following
entreaty:—“The Public is respectfully requested to protect this
valuable bridge.” On our word, it is such a malefactor against the
rules of good taste, that it richly deserves being hung, as it is, in
chains not less black than those |al are suspended over the Felon's
Gate at Newgate.
To give it an air of additional lightness, we must not omit to state
that the iron-work has all been painted a deep funereal black, that
WOL. xxxiii.
imparts to the structure a rich coal-barge heaviness, worthier one of
the wharves at Blackfriars than the pellucid banks of St. James's. It
is so black, that we fancied the drawing must have been made by
CoLE; only for the credit of our Schools of Design, we cannot and will
not believe it. Let us trust that Art has not sunk so low in this
country as this Suspension Bridge in the St. James's Park would
indicate. Without any offence, to the Chinese, we must say that it
would be a disgrace to the Willow-Pattern Plate.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW ORDER OF CHIVALRY.
- Sº - º
ID any gentleman ever buy a horse without being cheated?
Is not the brute always found, within some short time
after the purchase, to have something or other the
matter with it, which must have been well known to the vendor, and
which rendered it worth less than its price? To these questions there
can be but one answer, which is so obvious, that all equestrians, whose
legs are of a natural honest colour, will rejoice greatly to hear that an
Association is about to be established for the purpose of securing good
horses for respectable people, under the name of the Horse, Society.
The object of the Horse Society will be to provide purchasers with
horses correctly described, and really and truly appraised at their actual
value. With this view the most eminent jockeys, veterinary surgeons,
and horse-dealers, will be engaged by the Society to pronounce opinions
on all the animals offered by it for sale, and as these opinions will be
liberally paid for, buyers will, of course, be enabled to depend upon
them, how great rogues soever those who deliver them may be. It is
calculated that even people accustomed to deal in horses will speak the
truth when they know it is their interest to do so, and therefore the
Horse Society intends to engage, as professional advisers, some of the
greatest rascals on the Turf, that is to say, on the face of the Earth.
The Horse Society will be a joint stock company; and though it
will be essentially based on the principles of truth and honour, some
minds, perhaps, will entertain a little doubt whether it will be able
very long to preserve its integrity. For Companies, on the one hand,
are ºil. said to have no conscience, and on the other, we know
that very few indeed, even of the most high-minded men, can be long
concerned in horse-dealings without º into fraud. The horse
demoralizes almost everybody who has anything to do with him more
than merely to ride him; and we can only hope that the poisonous
moral atmosphere which appears, to surround that so-called noble
animal may not overpower the Society that will be obliged to breathe
it, and degrade a chivalrous band of gentlemen into a set of 'ossy
blackguards. -
COOKING BY ELECTRICITY.
WE have read an interesting account of a dinner that took place at
St. Dénis, at which all the good things were cooked by electricity.
According to this, the old latterie de cuisine will soon be replaced by a
galvanic battery. Our plum-puddings will be boiled by means of
electric currents. Dishes of electric eels will become as common as
plates of boiled beef at the Old Bailey. Bots and pans will be replaced
by Leyden jars, and the old spit will be driven out of the kitchen by
the positive, or negative, pole.
An “Electric okshºp ” will be a new opening in this scientific
age. We may live to see at the corner of streets, electric potato-cans,
with a stream of electricity fizzing out instead of the jet of steam.
By the bye, we wonder if, in Telegraph Offices, the accounts will be
“cooked” by electricity? It will be as well for Directors to abstain
from the Stock Exchange, and to give up the practice, after receiving
an important dispatch, of rushing to their broker's two or three times
a-day, or else the public may be raising the cry that the accounts are
“highly charged.” In the meantime, we shall look out anxiously
every time we go to the City, to see if there has not shot into existence
a scientific JoE’s, where the visitor sees his mutton-chop cooked in the
same room by means of electricity
THE CAMBRIDGE BANQUET.
How the City can ever forgive itself for having delayed an opportunity
to eat, drink, and flatter, so long as it has postponed these performances
in the case of the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, Gog only knows—unless he has
told Magog. Usually, the instant a man, no matter what his anteceden
has reached the top of the tree, pole, ladder, or whatever other goo
or bad eminence he has coveted, the citizens are at him with their
turtle and ſlummery. Punch need not name names, now that allis
serene, but he has not the faintest doubt that were Wiscount WILLIAMs
himself, at the head of a rabble of his vassals, to rush into the royal
palace, terrify the FIELD-MARsh ALP.A. into a fainting fit, and by
menaces obtain (not that he would, if we know our courageous
Sover EIGN) the promise of a Dukedom and estates to match, the City
of London ºil be at the DUKE of LAMPETH's door, simultaneously
with the milk and cat next morning, begging his Grace to fix a day to
receive the Freedom. Drawing a veil over the terrible picture, and
simply moting that the City measures men, and measures, by one test
only, Success, Punch cannot but record his astonishment that the Duke
of CAMBRIDGE, who has really merited, and received, far better thin
than City honours, should so long have been permitted, to º t
golden opinions he had won, without the additional daub of Guildhall
gold-leaf being smudged upon them.
Amends, however, have been made this last week, when the fated
CoMMANDER-IN-CHIEF was ſeted in the City, and after enduring a long
address from SIR John KEY, one of the few civic magnates who can
speak English (LoRD MELBourºn E said so) had to sit out a Mansion
ouse dinner, whereat assuredly his fellow-guests were of a mixed
order. It might be amusing to sit down with the Siamese and
American Ambassadors, all of whom are acquainted with our language,
the hero CARDIGAN is not unimposing at table, PRINCE WogoRIDEs
may have entertaining anecdotes from Moldo-Wallachia, and there
were some distinguished soldiers, whom even Mr. Punch would gladl
see at his board. But these were the plums of the City pudding, an
most of the remainder might be what is called in Hebrew “a feast
of Fat Things,” but by momeans what a decent Duke is accustomed to.
However, good fortune makes us acquainted with º dinner-fellows.
SIR John KEY gave the Duke some well-deserved praise in some
well-rounded periods, one of the best of which was that in which the
CHAMBERLAIN (not the Lord CHAMBERLAIN-copy the address) paid
an admirable tribute to “a pen, as fearless in its exposure of abuses as
unsurpassed by the vividness of its graphic power” in dealing with the
Crimean Campaign where the Duke's laurels were won. Nevertheless,
we do not observe the name of the applauded WILLIAM Howard
Russell in the list of guests at the banquet, and we congratulate
him thereon, for this was not “empty praise,” and was far preferable
to the “solid pudding ” Mr. Punch has mentioned.
The City gave the Duke a sword in the afternoon, and a knife and
fork in the evening. The inscription on the former must have been
revised by some intelligent foreman at HAN.cocks', the manufacturers,
for it presents no grammatical error that we can detect. Long may
H. R. H. behold it hanging over his chimney-piece among his pipes
and Crimean relics. The knife bore only one word, namely, “Rogers,”
and the fork was impressed with the City device. Both had been
unexceptionably cleaned, the one by the rotatory knife-cleansing
apparatus, the fork by a piece of wash-leather bought by the Lord
MAYOR’s servant from a Jew named, we believe, Isaacs.
The earlier speeches at the banquet demand, and received, no par-
ticular attention, except from PRINCE Wogorrors and one or two
other foreigners who could not understand a word of them. The
American Minister was good enough to say, in reference to the cere-
mony of the day, that he knew nothing about titles, but “could
understand”, a prince being a very decent kind of crittur, and also
that he hoped the Indian scoundrels would be tarnation well licked.
He then liquored, and the MAYoº gave the President of the Council,
the EARL §º.
Now GRANVILLE's speech was really the event of the week, because
this is the first time that a Minister of any standing has come out upon
Indian affairs. It was clear that the Earl had been getting up the
steam, for he had a lot of notes to help him, in case, Mr. Punch sup:
poses, the Mansion-House champagne might make him more ecstatiº
than rationalistic. He went to work like a man, and after the expecte
praise of the Duke, began to praise Loºp ELGIN, for his noble conduct
in coming across to India when he had nothing to do in China.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Having thus got the audience into a laudatory state of mind, GRAN-
VILLE began to eulogise LORD CANNING, and set forth how he had
not begged for the office of Governor-General, but, being appointed,
took of his coat to think the more intensely how he should improve
India, and then, putting it on again, went out and improved it until
India rebelled. }. GRANNY is a clever man, and was very cautious,
and begged only “Fair-Play” for CANNING, This he is sure of, but
what was asked from him in return was Fair-Work, which is not
exactly apparent from any dispatches Mr. Punch has seen. GRAN VILLE
solemnly promised that if CANNING should have acted in a “maudlin’
manner, he, GRANVILLE, would be the first to serve him out, but he
revealed that in a private letter LoRD CANNING had spoken most
severely of the Sepoys, and called them Devils. The rest of the
speech was apologetic, but hypothetically so, for LORD GRANVILLE
evidently knew nothing more ; what has been going on between the
authorities in India than Mr. Punch does, and we have no doubt that
the only brief he received in re CANNING was the following note from
Broadlands:– -
“Dear GRANNY,
Go and puff CANNY:
Lay it on thick,
And swear he’s a brick.”—P.
But when the laying on comes to be looked at, it is really very little
that the President of the Council can say for the Gover Nor-GENERAL
of INDIA. For once in his life, GRAN VILLE tired his hearers, and
PRINCE WogoRIDEs was observed to be fast asleep long before the
oration was over, while the Aldermen were yawning 'i. mad.
An artful dodge had been contrived in order to get LoRD CRAN-
worTH a hearing. The MAYQR proposed the House of Lords, and the
citizens who love a real lord º: y, and would marry him to their
daughters, or do anything but his “paper,” waited for the expected
aristocrat. And when they only found a law.lord, who had been not
very much better than one of themselves in early life, they could not
exactly run away, especially as the bottles, were not empty. So
CRANNY got an audience, and even a cheer, and went home and dreamt
that he was DEMost HENEs and was sitting upon LoRD BROUGHAM.
Punch is happy to know that his friend the DUKE has, since the
banquet, been as well as could be expected, and is highly thankful for
his Freedom from the City.
THE ART OF SINKING A TELEGRAPH.
MR. PUNCH has received a good-humoured letter from MR. JoHN DE
LA HAYE, of Manchester; a remarkably good-humoured letter as
coming frºm a gentleman who thinks that Mr. Punch pronounced
his invention absurd. Wr. Punch, however, in noticing a newspaper
paragraph, relative to MR. DE LAHAYE's contrivance for the sinking
of submarine telegraphs, took particular care to guard himself from
being understood, and misunderstood, to impute absurdity to the plan
of MR. DE LA HAYE, even taking the paragraph in question as correctly
describing it. However, the paragraph is inaccurate; and here is MR.
DE LA HAYE's own specification of his patent:—
“In order to prevent the cable from breaking through the strain caused by its
weight in sinking perpendicularly from the ship, we º to render it partially
buoyant by surrounding it, its whole length, with a light substance, such as
coopers' rushes, so that its specific gravity would be about one-sixth more than
that of water. This would allow the cable to sink slowly, a sufficient depth, so as
to be safe from the effects of the waves; but would prevent its sinking at once on
the bed of the ocean. As the rushes would be only temporarily connected to the
cable, by means of bands of tape, made to adhere by a compound soluble in water;
it would be freed at any given time; and resuming its original specific gravity,
would sink on the bed of the sea, but only at a considerable distance from the vessel
paying it out.” -
Mr. Punch has still to ask, as he asked before, concerning the in.
yention above detailed, How about the waves, and Will it wash? or
Won't it wash too well? That these questions may not be satisfactorily
answerable he does not say. His hope is, that it will wash in a per-
fectly successful manner. In that happy event, the sub-Atlantic cable,
although really submerged by the help of coopers' rushes, will doubt.
DE LA HAYE-bands.
! PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIP.
|
WE have heard of two brothers (their united ages do not exceed 27,
| and their united heights cannot soar much above 5 feet 10), who have
| gone into partnership at the West End. They have commenced
operations at the corner of two fashionable streets. One is a Crossing:
sweeper, and the other is a Shoe-black. Their places of business are,
you may say, next door to each other. The first dirties, as though by
accident, the boots of those Swells, who do not give him anything, as
they step over his crossing, and the second comes in for the benefit of
cleaning them. In this way, they play into each other's hands, and
divide a considerable sum at the end of the day. Their system is
less be said by execrable punsters, to have been sunk by means of
doubly sure, for it is rare that a Swell gets off without paying one or
the other. If he escapes the broom of ScyLLA, there is the brush of
CHARYBDIs that is certain to be down upon him at the next step. So
lucrative has the partnership hitherto been, that we understand as
much as a hurdy-gurdy, a monkey, and a cage full of white mice,
besides a central lamp-post, where a good penny paper business is done,
has been refused for it.

PRETTY FLORA ST. CLAIR was a milliner fair,
Her smile it was pleasant to view,
And so thought the grave ALEXAN per BoIAIR,
And so thought the gay HARRY BLEw.
Pretty FLOSSY.ST. CLAIR didn't very much care
Which Swell her devotion should bless ;
BoLAIR had dark eyes and magnificent hair,
But BLEw was a stunner at dress.
She would wait till one chose for her charms to propose:
of long her suspense was to be,
For the very same Sunday both gentlemen rose,
Determined to write to Miss C.
Each penned his best vows that, if she’d be his spouse,
He’d be true as that nuisancé, Dog Tray;
Each posted his letter, to be at her house
The very first thing the next day.
On Monday Miss Flossy, with ringlets so glossy,
Received at 9:30, Bol. AIR's,
And instantly wrote and accepted, because he
Had chanced to be first with his prayers.
But at 10:45 did BLEw's letter arrive,
Too late: she was pledged to the first,
And the elegant HENRY’s intention to wive
Has (perhaps for his good) been reversed.
“But,” asks a sharp roa, “why with different knocks
Were the letters delivered?” All fair.
BLEW simply employed a Receiving-House Bor,
A Pillar-Boz clinked for Bola IR.
The latter they clear ere the dawn-streaks appear,
And Aurora's red fingers make sign,
While Receiving-House letters, O lovers give ear!
Are not fetched from the shops until IX.
And FLQRA ST. CLAIR is now MRS. BQLAIR,
And like Nour MAHAL (in edged frills),
She whispers, and twines his magnificent hair—
“Remember the Pillar of HILL’s.”

A vulgar FELLOW.
We never heard of one, ABSALOM DELL, a Brighton auctioneer, until
reading, the ºf advertisement, and after reading it few people
will wish to hear of the man again:—
THIS DAY.

What life-inspiring words to shipwrecked fellow creatures 1
MR; ABSALOM LELL is instructed by the owner to Sell by Public
Auction, at the King and Queen Hotel, Brighton, on Thursday (THIS DAY),
October 29th, 1857, at Half-past Three o'clock,
THE FORE AND AFTT MAIN-SAIL of the unfortunate Ship “PILGRIM,”
recently wrecked off Brighton. Her fate, alas ! was the reverse of our good friend
BUNYAN's Pilgrim. Also, at the same time and place of sale will be offered, &c. &c.
The heartless flippancy with which ideas of the saddest and gravest
character are used § this man DELL to make up an advertisement
needs no comment. But what does he mean by saying, in his abomi-
nable English, that “the fate of the Pilgrim was the reverse of BUN-
YAN’s Pilgrim.” The latter went to HEAVEN–the ship came to
Brighton. It is really dangerous for fools to º with serious words
and we recommend this DELL to adhere to the legitimate clap-trap and
cackle of his º and to abstain from topics which belong to
another pulpit than his. -

A FAvourite underling of the Admiralty rushed one day last week,

CoNSIDERABLE astonishment has no doubt been created by the
following advertisement, which appeared in most of the papers:—
EXETER HALL SERVICES for the WORKING CLASSES, under
the sanction of the Bishop of LoNDON.—The SERVICE fixed for To-MoRRow
(SUNDAY) 8th instant, WILL NOT TAKE PLACE. The REv. A. G. Ebouarr,
Incumbent of the Parish, has, by a notice served yesterday, FoRBIDDEN THE
SERVICEs. Until the legal question shall have been decided, the Committee will
therefore suspend the course. - SHAFTESBURY, Chairman.
Office of Special Services Committee, 1, Robert Street,
Adelphi, Nov. 6, 1857.
Now that patent theatres have been abolished, so that SHAKspEARE
can be lawfully performed elsewhere than at Drury Lane, it seems hard
that a clerical manager should have the power to interdict the per-
formance of the Church Service in a rival House of Worship. Manager
we say, because this prank which the REv. M.R. EDouarT has playe
the Exeter Hall Committee, looks very much like the proceeding of a
member of that histrionic sect which affects stoles, copes, and candles,
and in general imitates the antics of Roman Catholic priests. We
shall be surprised to find, if we do find, that this divine is not a
Puseyite. The Puseyite may be said to be a famatic bearing the same
relation to a º an ape bears to a fool, or a monkey to a monk;
and the stoppage of the Exeter Hall services can only be regarded as
an ecclesiastical monkey's trick.
Entertainment in High Life.
AMONG the fashionable intelligence we find the announcement that
the DUKE and DUCHESS OF North UMBERLAND are entertaining a
select circle of visitors. What a funny Duke and Duchess . We hope
their entertainment is received with roars of laughter.

#. who
SEBASTopol AVENGED !
(An Article supposed to have been written for the Penny Morning Startler.)
HE CZAR OF ALL THE RUSSIAs
has wreaked a subtle ven-
geance on us. With our
arms away in India he feels
we’re at his mercy: as hot-
pressed and defenceless as a
sheet of cream-laid foolscap.
The sheet is in his grasp:
he can le” it at
“crumple -
pleasure. But first he writes
on it our Dooyſ in the plain-
est Russian text. ... The
| English nation , shall be
struck off from the face of
the earth: may, their very
language even shall be forth-
with obliterated. The tongue
they speak shall not survive,
even as a dead one. Hence-
forth there in fact is no such
word as “English.”. Seehow
he has done it. We quote
from a contemporary; our
foreign staff is limited:—
“The EMPEROR OF RUSSIA has
annihilated the English language
by a stroke of his pen. German
is no longer to be taught in the
College of Iskutsh (where there
is a considerable trade with California), and the programme of the studies announces
that “la langue Americaine' is to take its place.”
Perhaps, though, we are hasty. In the blindness of our fear we may
have jumped to false conclusions. The CzAR may only mean to act
the Fº of a wise sovereign, and have his subjects taught the language
of the countries where t º trade. Yet why draw this distinction
between Yankee-tongue and English? Is it simply, from a wise, pa-
ternal, kinglike reason 2 Is it simply because Yankee-slang is more
uncouth than our “QUEEN’s English,” and therefore would assimilate
more closely with langue Russe & Does the CzAR think langue Ameri-
caine would come more easy to his students; and that tongues used to
such sounds as Istpostschik and Golopschin would give congenial glib-
ness to Slogdollagise, Absauotilate, Ginjuleps, and the like? Yet may
it not embroil is with our brother JøNATHAN–this giving him the
credit for a language of his own—this subtle snake-like hint that he
! speaks, doubtful English? JoNATHAN is touchy. His dander’s easy
riz. 'Twould be a dark day for Old England should this elevate
his monkey. With Cottom in war's balance, how Manchester
would tremble! And when MANCHESTER were fallen, where would
stand Great Britain -
Alarmists we are not; but there is fearful cause to quiver. Flesh is
however fallible: we may be mistaken. From our hearts we hope it.
But our knowledge is but human. There is no telling what may
happen. It is as well always to be on the safe side. If our hints be
not taken by our Slumbering Government, let it not at least be for-
otten that we gave them. We have sounded the alarm. Ruat Hanglia /
E have done our duty. On the Russian horizon the least cloud is
portentous. Let Ministers have heed to that which we have shown
them. Though no “bigger than a weasel,” it may overspread Great
Britain. In our present i. of peril, precaution is our policy. , Let
| Official Benches look to it. Let PALMERSTON, with bated pride of
place, condescend for once to take a morsel of advice. Far-seeing he
may be (for he has somehow scrambled to a high position), yet the
“ smallest monstrous” penny-a-liner of the MIGHTY PREss sees
farther. Bear witness this Great Russian Portent! Eureka—we have
spoken!
SWEEP FOR THE SWEEPS.
THE City authorities seem to be taking a step to get rid of a
guisance. The statement may appear incredible, but the facts are
before the world. The highwaymen, who under the name of crossing-
sweepers, plunder the nervous and moiest the brave, are to be got
rid of. Their intolerable pertinacity has brought this upon them. Any
has a walk of twenty minutes between his residence and
is place of business, is persecuted by at least a dozen of these pests,
who have either a # to his money, or have not.

should be even, “invited” to pay twice. But it is better than the
old system, and now ladies and other timid persons will approach a
crossing without double terror, that of being badgered by a mendicant,
and that of being run over by an omnibus.

into a cookery-book, and, see what a Warden-pie is, and then think
whether it is anything like a Dirt-pie. New brooms, but no new

A TWO-FOOT RULE.
QP course we adore pictures, and the new Paul Veronese (our
£14,000 bargain) is worthy of all homage. But really SIR CHARLEs
EAST LAKE has proposed, to all who came to see Alexander and the
Ladies, such a preposterous ceremonial that we trust he will reconsider
the matter. He, or the authority in charge of the National Gallery,
has fixed up a notice, requesting Visitors “to scrape and wipe their
Feet.” Now we really cannot do this. When our boots are once
buttoned up, we hate unfastening them, and then the pulling off one’s
socks on the steps of the National Gallery is a great bore. And for
ladies such a process must be singularly inconvenient. We repeat
that with all reverence for Art, we cannot consent to go through a
more than Oriental humiliation at the shrine of Paul Very-uneasy.
THE GREAT BERKELEY BUSINESS.
(Summary, to the very latest Electric Dispatch.)
SAYS GRANTLEY to BooDLE,
“EARL BERKELEY’s a noodle
Whom you all lead along in a string like a poodle;
And I’ve just diskivered
He’s sealed and delivered

Like those, we discuss on no kind of conditions;

Makers, solicit the attention of the heads of shaky firms and tradesmen (large or
small) of exhausted capital and credit, to their unrivalled manufactures of an arti-
ficial currency, whereby the solvency of bankrupt traders may (one time in ten
million) be securely re-established. Without much labour and at no expense,
SACKIT, KITE, and Swag have set up the most perfect machinery for turning out
“good paper” with the greatest possible despatch, and from their unbounded
means of manufacture the largest orders can be executed at the very cheapest rates.
Their “first-class bill” may be §.”. a most superior article, and well worthy
of inspection: the neatness of its make concealing almost wholly its flimsiness of
texture, and rendering it, negotiable at any rate as waste-paper. Their blank
acceptances are also strongly recommended, as being highly serviceable in cases of
emergency: the body of the draft being left in blank, the filling up is left to the
discretion of the holder, who may insert whatever sum and date and drawer's
signature he chooses.
SACKIT, KITE, and Swag, likewise beg inspection of their Imitation Autographs,
which are got up with such nicety of finish that only the expertest Banker's clerk
would doubt their being genuine. The names, being those of perfect Rothschildren
in credit, may be used with much advantage as endorsements to a Bill, and will
impart a good appearance to the very worst of paper.
SACKIT, KITE, and Swag would also direct notice to their List of References,
which will be found a highly useful appendage to the counting-house. It contains
some hundred names of non-existent persons, to whom inquiries as to solvency
may safely be permitted. In case of such inquirers sº, through the Post
Office, care is requisite, of course, to have them taken in, by providing proper
agents to receive their letters, and so preventing their return through the Dead
department. The answers sent can then of course be made in any terms that ma
be deemed advisable. In cases where inquiry is to be made in person, S. K. & S.
can supply efficient representatives at the very shortest notice, and will guarantee
their playing any part that is assigned to them, whether it be a LADY CROEsus living
in the country, ºr a retired—to-Bayswater commercial millionnaire.
Note. The principles, or want of them, on which S. K. & S. conduct their business
will not allow them to send out their manufactures upon º All articles
are warranted, but no trial is allowed. Parties in need of them must buy out and

Observe. S. K. & S. being determined to maintain their reputation for supplying
their goods genuine as made, have resolved not to trust to any Agents for supplying
them. Their manufactures are therefore not to be distinguished by any known
trade-mark, but are to be had only at the Mauufactory, Front and Back Cellars,
19, Cadger's Rents, Whitechapel. N. B. No admittance to the works except after

EXTENSIVE ROBBERY OF CORN.
bunal to entertain such a case as that which is thus stated
by the Sherborne Journal:—
“MARTHA ALLEN surrendered on bail to take her trial on a charge
of stealing a quantity of wheat of the value of one penny, the property
of JAMES PHippes, farmer, of Frome, on the lst of August last.”
On a charge so grave and important as the above a
culprit ought, manifestly, to be arraigned before a Judge
at the Assizes—if arraigned at all. The prisoner, was
proved, in evidence, to have been nursing some children
in a field, and one of these little robbers plucked several
ears of corn, and gave them to her. All a set of rogues
in grain together. The receiver was clearly as bad as the
thief; yet why was not the thief indicted as well as the
receiver? Perhaps, because any jury would have declared
the thief innocent: as the jury before whom this case was
tried actually did declare the receiver to be. MARTHA
ALLEN was acquitted of the penny, or Phippeny, accusation
, which had been brought against her. Her case might have
been summarily disposed of, but she, with a due sense of
its character, refused to be tried by the Magistrates.
Three courses were then open to those gentlemen: they
might have committed her for trial at the Assizes, they might
have done what they actually did, or they might have dis-
missed the case. The wonder is that they did not do the first
of these things—the last was, of course, out of the question.
MR. PHIPPEN appears to have been compelled to bring
MARTHAALLEN to what he fondly hoped would be justice
by the fact that he had lost several pennyworths of wheat
by the ravages of small depredators; sparrows, probably,
as well as children. Might not a farmer, by a new statute
for that case made and provided, be empowered to employ
well as the sparrows, that come to prey upon his corn?
MARTHA ALLEN–a young woman, but evidently an old
hand—acted wisely enough in electing not to have her
case, disposed of by the Great Unpaid of Zummersetshire.
As they did not dismiss it, perhaps, had they adjudicated
on it, MARTHA ALLEN, for receiving, at the hands of an
infant, unlawfully plucked wheat, value 14., would now be
tripping it on the treadmill.

A LOVE OF A DOG LOST.
REALLY, people set their affections on the strangest objects.
... We do not use this latter substantive in the feminine acceptance of
it, as meaning “perfect frights: ” in which sense it is mostly used for
human application. ...We admit, though, that our strikingly original
expression, might with some truth be received as including, human
“objects;” for, CUPip being blind, it is no strange thing to find people
make the queerest “objects” objects of affection. But the reflection
we began with was induced by a perusal of the following advertise:
ment, by which it will be seen that an objective passion can be kindled
by another object than a human one —
OG LOST.—STRAYED, on Wednesday last, from No. 11, West-
bourne Villas, Harrow Road, a small WHITE POODLE. He has a paralytic
affection which occasions him to throw up his head every moment. If brought
back a handsome REWARD will be paid.
If we lived in the neighbourhood of Westbourne Villas, we should
certainly consider it a melancholy duty to call twice a-day at least at
No. 11, for the purpose of inquiring if their treasure had returned to
them. As it is, we trust they will accept our deepest condolence for
their irreparable loss. , We are induced to use this adjective, because
we fancy that a dog which “throws his head up every moment” is
not to be replaced for either love or money. Of course, throwing up
his head involves its coming down again: so that this extraordinary
animal performs, in fact, twice sixty distinct movements of the cranium
think a paralytic poodle can anyhow be looked on as a healthy object
of affection, and if we happened to have so misplaced our own, we
should have accepted our bereavement as a salutary lesson. However
much affection we might have felt for such a creature, we can but think
his constant twitchings would have fidgeted us somewhat, and that
we should have regarded his evaporation as a º release. Although
the reward is a “handsome” one, we cannot well believe the poodle to
have been so; and we regard it as a part of the extravagance of the
advertisement about him. It seems preposterous to fancy he was
valued as an ornament: and as for being useful, the only use one
could have put him to would have been as a performing dog, to
º; a capital accompaniment to the popular street-tune of Bobbing
round.
We trust we shall escape being thought unfeeling in our comments,
but we candidly admit, that there are other reasons than his smallness
‘. which we think that this “small poodle" can be viewed as no great
OSS.
INFANCY AND RACES.
AMONG the racing intelligence we observe mention made of a race
at Newmarket, the prize contended for being denominated the
“Nursery Stakes.” . The horses entered for these stakes, one would
think, should be cock-horses, and the jockeys very young #.
The Nursery, in connection with the Turf, is suggestive of pleasing,
age that his late possessors should have gone to the expense of an
per minute. This is an amount of head-work such as no dog could be but perhaps illusory, ideas of innocence and verdure. We should like
trained to, and indeed it puzzles us to fancy how it can have been to know what the Nursery Stakes consist of. Perhaps they are com-
accomplished. Two movements per moment amount to nearly con- prised in a little drinking-cup, bearing the inscription of “A Present
stant action, and the animal that made them may be almost viewed as from Newmarket,” or, “For a Good Boy.” Such a little cup would

MR. PUNCH AT THE LAUNCH.
R. PUNCH went to the Great
Ship Yard, on Tuesday, the
3rd of this present Novem-
ber, but not with the slight-
est idea of seeing the vessel
launched. He knew, in fact
that the experiment would
not succeed on that day. He
knew it from having read on
the card of admission—
“The Directors have not been
able to determine the period of
launching, and consequently have
been unable to provide refresh-
ment for visitors.”
The want of logic in this
announcement made it clear
to Mr. Punch's mind that
something would go wrong
where the reasoning power
was so inadequately put
forth. He wept, in fact, as
he got into one of the dirty
carriages on the Blackw
Railway. Why, he mourn-
fully said, did not the Di-
rectors think for a moment.
Why not have printed,—
A gloom was over his soul,
-
Launch when we can, Lunch at 1:30.”
and it was in keeping with the dismal, muggy day selected for pro-
moting MR. Scott RussBLL’s gigantic Baby from its cradle to the
bed of Thames.
He reached the quarter, termed by the Railway officials, Limos,
without any accident to speak of, or any event of more importancé
than his threatening to give into custody a kind of marine commercial
gent, unless he took his exceeding muddy boots off the cushion on

snob obeyed. But there are scores of snobs who commit the same
offence, and encounterno Mr. Punch. This little act of chivalry somewhat
brought up his spirits, and at the Limos Station, he cheerfully scram-
bled to the top of an omnibus, in company with thirty or forty other
gentlemen, and the vehicle went off at a rattling pace through the
narrowlanes, supposed to be streets, in Limos. A new line of passenger-
traffic seemed to be open for the occasion, to the discontent of the
aborigines, who scowled at the omnibus in savage dislike, scarcely
justified by the driver's evident determination to run over some of
them, if he could, in memory of the Launch.
For about a mile, between Limos and, Millwall, and up to the very
yard, a sort of fair was being held, where was congregated a great
mass of anism. The homest artisans of the neighbourhood, of whom
there are thousands, had gone with laudable curiosity to see what
they could of the great experiment, but no such healthy excitement
charms for the scoundrelism of the Isle of Dogs. A very brutal
assemblage was gathered, and it yelled, larked, hooted, gambled, and
emitted foul language, and made some of the spectators consider
whether MR. CHARLEs SELEY’s bold device of a Press Gang for
recruiting, might not be tried with advantage at such re-unions.
Their material might be used up in the coarser work of war, and the
educated soldier might be reserved for duties worthy of him.
The mounted Police seemed quite aware of the character of the mob,
aud rode about and across it with diligence, and passengers received
no worse treatment than vile tongues can bestow. And the yard was
reached, and in two minutes more the two Greatest Facts of modern

the piquant red petticoat, and the exquisitely-ſitting military-heele

delightful friends, and he hereby records his gratitude. Also he
beheld the Siamese Embassy, smoking very complacently, and this
reminded him to do the same. He had at this period occasion to
observe the perfectly helpless air with which the majority of spectators
regarded the launching machinery, and to note the insane *†.
which others were giving of it. Mr. Punch's amusement in this respect
was largely shared by some of MR. RUSSELL’s intelligent workmen, who
ternatural courtesy, took the fair hand of the young lady who was to
perform the baptismal rite, and escorted her with great devotion to
the platform near the bow. Her graceful yet, emphatic dash of the
flower-encircled bottle against the vessel was the only success of the
day. The Great Eastern was christened, and it is surely a fortunate
omen for her that the officiating clergywoman's name is HoPE. This
would be a good place for a Latin quotation, only Mr. Punch doesn't
happen to remember one. He has, however, set a young friend to
search the Delphin HoRACE for every ºpes and spen in the index, and
if that party finds anything appropriate, it shall be added in a note.

could not hold its own.
Whether, the officials are right in blaming workmen, or workmen
were justified in what they did, matters not much. The might
experiment was brought to a stand-still, and cannot be renewe
for three weeks to come. The vessel, though christened, hesitates
to renounce the Works of Mr. Scott Russº. She will be taught
her duty better, Mr. Punch hopes and believes, early in December.
There seems no cause for discouragement. A difficulty, we are
informed by LoRD LYNDHURST, means a thing to be overcome, and
MR. BRUNEL agrees with his Lordship.
Soon after it had been announced that there would be no more
launching, and while a small gentleman in a state of excitement was
frantically adjuring the police to clear the premises, and abusing them
as sticks dressed up as policemen, because they took the process
rather easy, Mr. Punch º: to discover that he was wet through.
With his usual prompt intelligence he decided that it must be raining
and this he speedily perceived was the case. Therefore, having helped
a good many red petticoats to jump off wet beams, and having been
rewarded with a good many charming smiles, Mr. Punch threw his
fine form into a Hansom cab, and returned to his native metropolis,
singing,

At a Court of Common Council, held last Friday, there

in such an elegant retort as the above. No wonder that
the LoRD MAYor rose to order, though whether he
ordered eau-de-Cologne, or lime, or burnt feathers, or rose-
water, or whitewash, or what #. deodorising mixture,
the report omits to state. However, the beauty of the
satire has yet to come.
The very next piece of business of the Common Council
turns on Billingsgate Market, and an orator jumps on his
legs, to move:–

BIGOTRY, INTOLERANCE, AND FIREWORKS.
Fifth of November was very general, and very signal this year. No
less than 5,000 persons were employed in letting off fireworks on
Tower-Hill. At Hammersmith—a place which is greatly infested with
Roman aliens–numerous Guys were paraded; among them there was
a living reality on horseback; a gentleman who had got himself up in
a style combining FAwKEs with FALSTAFF. These displays of popular
bigotry and intolerance are greatly to be j and they
are very seasonable just now, when Popery is trying to enslave the

EGLINTON TO THE RESCUE
We have much pleasure in extracting from the celebrated Morning
Journal which especially devotes itself to the publication of fashionable
intelligence, the following announcement:—
* Lord EGLINTON AND FINANCIAL CRISIS IN SCOTLAND.—The EARL OF EGLINTON
announces that he will take payment of the rents on his estates due at this term in
deposit receipts of the Western, or in the notes of any Scotch bank.”
The name of EGLINTON was already celebrated in connection with a
modern tournament; but the bearer of it will now have earned a
reputation for serious chivalry. To rush to the rescue, to dash into
the midst of a fray, and, regardless of personal safety, to rally a retreat-
ing host, and arrest a panic, is just that particular kind of exploit the
performance of which is characteristic of a true Knight: It was also
customary for knightly heroes to scatter largess among their followers,
occasionally, when they happened to have a little money about them.
Their followers very often consisted of the rabble, and the money
which they caused a parcel of knaves to scramble for was generally
thrown away. But the largess which the EARL OF EGLINTON has
virtually bestowed on his tenants, will doubtless be the means of saving
from ignoble insolvency, and preserving from capture and durance
vile, a goodly multitude of true lieges; right worshipful citizens and
burghers and stout yeomen.
WOL. XXXIII.
THE IRISH SEPOY."
OUR execrable contemporary, the Irish National Sepoy, raves in the
following terms:–
“No one now denies that England has received her mortal wound—that however
long or short she may linger, her days are numbered. A unanimous feeling seems
to be taking possession of the public mind, that England, in a sorer strait than she
was in '82, will ere long be glad to act as she did then, if we ourselves will, only use
our opportunity as our fathers did theirs.”
The National Sepoy should not say too much about *.
Language apparently meant to excite rebellion may afford a certain
opportunity. That opportunity may be taken; and then, some fine
morning, about eight o'clock, we may see, the Irish National Sepoy
suspended. The National Sepoy is'allowed plenty of rope, and he is at
least putting it about his neck... A trap-door may, in a very short time,
fall down beneath the soles of his boots, unless, before its descent, he
shall have kicked his boots off, in order to falsify the predictions of his
friendly monitors. . He may be sure that any attempt to create another
Sepoy mutiny will be crushed in the bud without ceremony; and that
if #. does not even now meet with a more ignoble punishment than
that which Punch recommends to be inflicted on him, the reason is,
that in the opinion of HER MAJESTY's Government, and, the British
Public, as well as that of Punch, it is sufficient to annihilate him by
blowing him away from a popgun.

PHYSIC FOR THE FAIR.
AMONG the various cures, through
which relief is promised, by adver-
tisements, to suffering humanity,
A may now be enumerated the “Move-
s/; ment Cure.” Not knowing the na-
ture of this remedy, we cannot say
whether it is a novelty or a method
of treatment known for a consider-
able time, Dancing, if it has been
successfully prescribed and prac-
tised in cases of bite by the Taran-
tula spider, was a species of Move-
ment. Cure; and it may be sup-
posed to form an element in the
system advertised under that name.
Accordingly, the *. of the
dancing-master will be greatly ele-
wated, so, indeed as to become quite
a first position, for he will hence-
forth tº: his place as a professor
of the toe-and-healing art. Balls
will be given instead of boluses,
and polkas and waltzes will be pre-
scribed, to be danced at bed-time,
andſrepeated every few minutes, to
the great delight of interesting inva-
lids: though as a movement cure
the dancing would be more effectual
if taken in the morning and during
the day.
The Movement Cure would also
ſº benefit many delicate young
adies, if they resorted, to it by
walking several miles daily at a
good brisk |. in the open air.
This is a well-known.cure for the
effects of champagne, and cheaper char
beverages, imbibed in excessive
quantity over-night: but as the complaint, is chiefly confined to the
grosser sex, so is the use of the remedy. The skipping-rope may afford
one means of adopting the Movement Cure; and that noble animal the
horse may furnish another to beautiful beings who would be so much
more beautiful because so much more healthy than they are, if they
would but put themselves under, the Movement. Cure by taking plenty
of exercise. Not only would the Movement Cure of walking remove
numerous headaches and most of the similar complaints to which
young ladies are subject; but it would also put an to a complaint,
not medical, with which, they are assailed. ... In order to take proper
walking exercise, it would be necessary for them to wear clothes which
they could freely step out in, and which they would not be obliged to
keep holding up with both hands out of the mud.
MR. PUNCH*S POLICE.
BRUTAL TREATMENT OF A HUSBAND.—Yesterday, after the other
charges had been disposed of, a rather mild-looking, well-dressed man,
named Moses Joseph Weal, aged about 40, was placed in the dock,
charged by his wife with having stayed at his club until two in the
morning, and having then come home in a cab, and a state of obfus-
cation. The charge was heard by all present, including numerous
females, with a shudder, and the prisoner, who seemed desirous to
. was indignantly ordered by the worthy Magistrate to hold his
tongue.
Margaret Weal, wife of the prisoner, deposed that they had been
married several years, during which time he had treated her tolerably
well until of late, when he had taken to use very strong language in
her presence, had frequently absented himself from the house at the
dinner hour, had committed outrages upon her relatives, and had re-
fused her the necessaries of life. She had borne all this with patience,
but on the preceding night he had committed the offence with which
he was charged.
Judith Tigertail, mother of the witness, corroborated the daughter's
evidence in every respect, except in declaring that the latter had not
told half the wickedness of the prisoner.
James Diddle, driver of cab 198,276, gave evidence of º:
brought the prisoner from the Taraxicum Club to Somers. Town, an
was convinced that he was drunk, inasmuch as he had disputed the
amount of the fare.
Rosa Johnson, servant in the family, deposed to having, opened the
door to her master, who was unable to come in with his latch.
key. In reply to a question from the Magistrate the witness said,
that this might have arisen from her master's being intoxicated, but
alsº from her mistress having put the chain up.
The worthy Magistrate, with evident disgust, asked the prisoner
whether he would be sent for trial, or summarily punished.
The prisoner said, that if it was all the same to the Magistrate, he
should like to say a few words, and he made a statement which not
only completely met the allegations of the prosecutrix, but excited the
liveliest sympathy from every one, except the females, in court. He
said that he had been a good husband to the complainant, had allowed
her plenty of money, and never inquired where it went to, and that he
had frequently, after taking off his boots on a wet º put them on
again, and gone out to buy her some delicacy for her supper. That
she had behayed herself well until in an evil hour he had permitted
the witness Tigertail to reside in the house, since when all had gone
wrong. He could never get his breakfast punctually, though, having
a situation it was important to him to be to his time in the city. He
had (and here the prisoner shed tears) had cold meat for dinner three
times in one week, though the complainant and her mother had always
a hot lunch. He had not, he said, a button on his shirt, and here the
poor fellow turned up his sleeves, and the condition of his wristbands
caused a sensation among the spectators. When he had remonstrated
he had been abused by the witness Tigertail, who had asked him
whether he fancied he had married a needlewoman, and had flung into
his face her deceased husband, an officer in the Excise. (Sensation.)
He admitted that on the occasion in question, after a long series of
snubbing and privation, he had so far forgotten himself as to say he
would be hanged if he would take the complainant and her mother to
a Little Bethel at Clapham, instead of keeping his promise to spend an
hour or two with an old schoolfellow. As for being intoxicated, the
Magistrate might, as a married man, know that a woman always threw
that charge into her complaints, as an honest baker adds the lump of
bread that makes up the quarterm. He had been sober enough to take
the cabman's number, ºl begged to charge him with extortion and
insolence.
The witness Tigertail, who had been very violent during portions of
the prisoner's statement, here flung a corpulent old umbrella at him.
The complainant offered no further evidence beyond hysterics.
MR. PUNCH said that this was a case which showed the *:
of hearing both sides, a plan which he had always adopted. The
large was dismissed, and the accused might, if he pleased, place his
wife in the dock. This the latter declined, but manifested no disin.
climation to see his mother-in-law there. 'Ultimately after a feeling
remonstrance with Mrs. Weal, and a severe lecture to the witness
Tigertail, the Magistrate sent the cabman to prison, and recommended
Mr. Veal to forgive his wife this time on her promising to amend, and
giving Mrs. Tigertail notice to quit. The parties then left the court.

ORTUNATELY, the City is be-
N coming * itself again.
The tightness of the money-chest
with which it was attacked,
has been relieved by the remedy
which Doctor PAM prescribed
for it. The current of the cur-
rency is returning to its cham-
nels, and the banks are in no
danger of breaking with the pres-
sure. Respiration for a while had
very nearly ceased. Men feared
almost to breathe, for there was
such infection in the air that
a breath might have destroyed
them. But, the crisis once past,
signs of health are º re-
turning. PHYSICIAN PAM’s pre-
scription has been followed by
a “Ha, ha! cured in an instant!”
As a proof of how much easier
things are daily getting, it is
enough to say a Scotchman yes-
terday was seen to take a ride
upon a penny omnibus.
Eighty-five, Fleet Street, being
in the City, Mr. Punch of course
was much affected by the panic.
With his usual noble heroism he held himself in readiness to play the
part of CURTIUs, and plunge into the gulf as soon as it was asked of
#. and he was shown its whereabouts. Resides doing this, he sacri.
ficed his pocket on the altar of his country, by expending a considerable
portion of his capital in collecting fullest details of the progress of the
panic, and getting all the earliest and latest of intelligence. This he
sent by special Tobygrams half-hourly to the Treasury, and thus
apprised the Šaji, of the symptoms of the case. It was in
this way that the crisis was perceived, and was prescribed for: Bank.
ruptcy impended, like the Sword of DAMocLEs. All England was, in
fact, just going through the Court. A deus ea machină was of course in
requisition; and the demand was of course supplied by Mr. Punch.
And now, the country being saved, Mr. Punch .." contemplates
the fact of its rescue, and with untiring energy applies himself unrest-
ingly to a new Herculean labour for it. Sparing mo expense in cabs,
Afr. Punch has gathered some statistics of the consequences of the
crash, and as cautions to posterity, he now proceeds to print them:—
The Editor of one of the pro-Sepoy penny º was in such con-
sternation at the tightness of his money-market, that he exclusively

paring to smash for upwards of a twelvemonth; and now, it is believed
will attribute their misfortune entirely to the Panic, and no doubt will
be rewarded with a first-class certificate. -
The wife of a respectable and highly cautious stockbroker was so
alarmed by what she heard her husband say about the “low state of
the bank resources” and the “drain of gold from the establishment,”
that she made haste to realise the notes she had for housekeeping, and
in her hurry purchased more things for her wardrobe than the larder.

And feel the happiest of men:
Until the odorous grouse next door
Bid me on goose reflect mo more.
In short, where'er my steps I wend,
New fragrances my nose befriend :
| Een now my nasal memory dwells
| With rapture on those evening smells
MR. LARKER was so “engaged in the City” while the money
pressure lasted, that he never once reached home until long past mid
.." then was so much overcome that he could not take his
oots oil.
A “pions” maid-of-all-work, holding a situation in a serious family,
being confidentially informed by the baker's boy that his master said
as hern were gitting in a mess and worn’t to have no credit, acted on
the hint that very afternoon, and decamped with her piety and half-a-
dozen teaspoons.
. A constant rider in the comfortable New Saloon Omnibuses was so
distracted '. the panic from his usual intelligence, that he jumped into
one of the French $.". Menageries, and did not find out until
afterwards how he had been bumped and battered.
No less than nineteen done-up gentlemen made excuses to their
tailors, on the ground that money was so tight they had really no loose
cash for them.
The Chairman at a Meeting of an Agricultural Society was so
affected by the sight, of the new, sovereigns he was awarding to
Prize Labourers, that he immediately wrote off a letter to the Times,
declaring that there need be no fears of distress among the working
classes, for the peasantry he knew, had hoards of gold which they,
when out of work, could well fall back upon.
A Belgravian footman who had been “inwesting”, some spare
“puckwisits” in the Three {". Cents, was so overjoyed at the sus.
ension of the Bank Act, and the consequent advance of Government
curities, that he actually returned a civil answer to a lady who called
to apply for a governess's place. -
At least ten dozen stingy husbands who had promised to escort their
wives and families to JULLIEN’s, took advantage of the Panic for the
postponement of their visit.
MR. TIPPIER found his nerves so shattered by the influence of the
Panic, that he was forced to take more than ordinary measures of
relief, and he therefore took three extra half-pints daily to fortify his
confidence that things were all serene with him.
One of the most eminent of the Hebrew bill-discounters had worked
himself one day to such a pitch of excitement that he swallowed three
pork-sausages for supper without discovering his error.
Another bill-discounter, of strictly Christian tenets, was thrown in
such a state of mind by finding that some “paper” he had been
“doing” had in fact been doing him, that to compose himself for rest
he was prescribed the strongest anodyne, and even MR. SMITH's Poems
failed to set him nodding.
MR. BROWN’s wife's mother, chancing to be staying with them, took
occasion of the Panic to read a lecture on economy to MR. B. at
º, in answer to his grumbling at “that blanked cold
muttom l’”
These are some of the effects of the late monetary crisis; and the
nation may determine if they are not of a monitory nature.
GOOD NEWS FROM OXFORD.
WE were much gratified by the perusal of the following announce-
ment in the Guardian:-
“DR PUsey.—Our readers will be glad to hear that Dr. Pusey has returned to
Christchurch considerably benefited by his residence at Malvern.”
What has been the matter with the celebrated leader of the Trac.
tarians, our contemporary and Guardian does not state...We apprehend
it to have been a sort of ague or malaria which, as DR. Hooper informs
| the medical student, “attacks people in the neighbourhood of Rome.”

thank her for having at all events got some pleasure out of his money while it lasted.
ñd she, if she was a dear, warm, kind, affectionate, sweet, good, darling little rib

poisoned by dukes and marquises for fear the Stars and

times sent as presents to somebody else’s—same remark

of all this. Ask about these things and the lords of creation
are as mute as a dead, nigger in a coal-hole. But there’s

must be so) we must repair it. We’ll have a good time.

“FANNY FERN,”
HINT TO THE ANTI-DIWORCE LEAGUE.
LL, the Puseyite Clergy, and
their allies, roused into fresh
wrath_by the announcement
that MR. JUSTICE CREss-
well is to be the grand arbi-
ter in Matrimonial Disputes,
have got up a sort of memo-
rial protest against the new
Divorce Act. Their docu-
ment reads like a sneering
joke, and will be received as
such a joke should be. Their
9int is, that the Act of
niformity (usually one of
the grievances of the Church-
above-State party), ordains
that a clergyman shall pro-
claim his approbation of the
marriage service, which, ac-
cording to these interpreters,
declares marriage indisso-
luble under any circum-
# stances. It is not worth
while arguing with such
gentlemen, and indeed, as
was said about GIBBON's
irreverences, “who can re-
fute a sneer?”—but as the
Divorce Act is, happily, law, and is not going to be altered to please
certain priests, whose professional whims have already been largely
considered, suppose they go on doing what they have been doing for
years past, namely, altering the Marriage Service. Mr. Punch has
iven away about a i. brides, and has wept among a thousand
ridesmaids and never once heard that remarkable service read through-
out, every parson exercising his own discretion, and mutilating accord.
ing to his own notions of decorum, tediousness, or modern manners.
The remedy is evidently in the hands of the Puseyites, and it is a little
unworthy of them to affect respect for Acts of Parliament.
CANNING PERE ON CANNING FILS.
So great a stress has been laid by LoRD PALMERSTON, EARL GRAN-
yILLE, and others, as to LoRD CANNING, and SIR COLIN CAMEBELL
being the best of friends, that we are reminded of the celebrated line
in The Rovers—a production written by a very near relative, of the
Gover NoF-GENERAL of INDIA, viz.:-‘A sudden thought strikes me.
Let us swear eternal friendship.” We have no doubt, after the very
strong assurances that have been publicly made, that fonn CANNING,
the moment he saw SIR CoIIN, delivered, with due theatrical emphasis,
the above noble sentiment, and then, retreating a few steps, and baring
their manly breasts, they rushed into each others' arms. You may be
sure that on LORD CANNING's side, “the wish was father to the
thought.” The “eternal friendship” has already lasted three weeks'
and why, pray, shouldn’t it last three weeks longer?
ThE UNIVERSAL ALPHABET.-It has
only three letters, but they
are understood all over the world; viz. “L. S. D.”

MoTTo For QUEEN ISABELLA.—“The pleasure that we love

MERCY FOR NANA SAHIB.
BY A HUMANITARIAN.
TUN.F.—“Guy Fawkes.”
FIRST catch your NANA SAHIB; then, though you may speak your
mind to him,
Qh! pray do not harsh language use, or be at all unkind to him.
Point out how naughty 'twas of him with cruelty to slaughter
The mother and her little boy, and helpless infant daughter:
But there º:
Don't doom your brother NANA SAHIB to the drop.
Reprove him in a gentle way, and don't severely scold him,
And if he weeps with penitence, in soft embraces fold him;
Say all you can to comfort him, should he remorse exhibit;
But be not so hard-hearted as to swing him on a gibbet.
No; there stop, &c.
Say nothing calculated to distress, or pain, or frighten him;
Sing DocTQR WATTs's hymn to him, in order to enlighten him,
And teach him that according to the principles of charity,
His little hands were never made to perpetrate barbarity.
And there stop, &c.
Qbdurate should he show himself, and of rebuke a scorner,
As it is possible he may; then put him in a corner:
Till he shall say that he’ll be good, and promise reformation,
Keep MASTERNANA SAHIB in that weary situation:
But there stop, &c. :
If for an inconvenient time, he stand there, contumacious,
Confine him to a lonely room, but one that’s light and spacious;
And threaten, merely threaten, though you prove a story-teller
'Mong toads and frogs and beetles, that you’ll put him in a cellar:
But there stop, &c.
His spirit should these measures fail, as fail they may, of breaking,
Lay hands upon his shoulders then, and give him a good shaking;
lſ in his course of obstinacy still you cannot stop him,
Then say, but only say, mind, that you’ll take him up and pop him.
But there stop, &c.
All these means of correcting him in vain when you’ve gone through
with hi
m,
Then let him go, and tell him you’ll have nothing more to do with
him;
But leave him to the Bad Man, and let Bogy fly away with him,
And take him to a wicked place, where j will play with him :
But there stop, &c.
Though NANA SAHB may have done some deeds of slight atrocity;
In fact, though he has far surpassed a tiger in ferocity;
Oh, never hang him like a dog—for hanging him would hurt him
But preach to him, and leave him, if unable to convert him.
And there stop.
Send not Cawnpore's gory butcher to the drop.
ANOTHER STOPPAGE.
WE regret to have to announce the sudden stoppage of one of the
largest firms at Poplar. We allude to the Leviathan steam-ship, that
was obliged to bring its operations to a stand-still on the third of this
month. A run was expected on the banks of the Thames, but this
calamity, by resorting to measures of the most vigorous nature, was
fortunately averted. The fix of the Leviathan, we are informed by
persons possessed of means almost as extensive as the ship itself, i.
only a temporary one, . The moment, the “pressure.” begins to relax
there is but little doubt that she will get off her difficulties, and go on
most swimmingly. In fact, business is announced to be resumed at the
beginning of next month, when every effort is to be made to ease hel
present position. It is confidently asserted that all expectations, a
soon as the ship commences paying out,” will be honourably liqui
dated in full. It has a large floating capital at command, if it coul
only get at it. The most stirring †. be brought to bea
upon it in order to surmount this passing culty.

“VANDERDECKEN, BY JOVE!”
DOES THE BANK DO BILLS P
THE Times having announced that notwithstanding the financial
crisis the Bank of England refused no good bills tendered in good
faith, our young friend, MR. LARKINGTON BEAN, of the Temple (some-
what incited by the appeals of his laundress and the menaces of his
tailor) made his way into the City yesterday morning, and, arriving at
the Bank, demanded an interview with the Governor. The porter was
at first inclined to give our young friend into custody for profane ch
but finding that he was serious and very persevering (having screwe
himself up with some pale ale), the official pointed out the Governor as
he happened to cross one of the courts. MR. BEAN immediately
introduced himself.
Mr. Bean. I say, Governor. -
The Governor (very much disgusted and haughtily). Some—mistake—
er—porter—
Mr. Bean. No porter so early in the day, Governor, thank you. I
want to have half a talk with you.
The Gov. Quite impossible, Sir. (Tries to pass on.)
Mr. Bean. Not at all, impossible, my dear old fellow, but very
probable, and highly likely. My name is BEAN.
The Gov. Neithe: officially nor privately, Sir, has that fact, or rather
statement, the slightest interest for me.
Mr. Bean. Talking of interest, Governor, just brings us to the point.
You've been and raised the rate again, I see. Ten per cent, eh?.
The Gov. Really, Sir, I have neither time nor inclination to discuss
that topic or any other. You are taking a strangeliberty. -
Mr. Bean. Pardon me; pardon me, Governor. That sort of thing
won't do at any price. You are an official, created for the benefit of
society. I’m a member of society, and when I ask you a civil question,
I have a right to be answered.
The Gov. (amused). Granting that. I were disposed to answer a
question, Sir, I have heard none. Your conduct, certainly, is very
questionable. -
Mr. Bean. Neat enough, Governor, and now we come to business.
ºuestion is, will you be good enough to give me a cheque for this
Ill
The Gov. O! Ah! You are the clerk of one of my tradesmen. When
he sends a proper person to ask for his account in a proper manner,
he will be paid. -
Mr. Bean (in his turn very much disgusted). I a clerk, Sir! I a snob,
Sir! I collect a tradesman's debt, Sir!...I am a gentleman, eating my
terms in the Temple, and in all probability shall one day be a Member
of Parliament, . overhaul your Bank Charter, Sir.
=|meaning, MR. Brows—
The Gov. When that time arrives, Sir, if I am spared, we will re.
commence our conversation at the point at which we now drop it.
Good day, Sir.
Mr. Bean. At that time, Sir, I shall ask you whether it is consistent
with your notions of mercantile propriety to publish an advertisement
inviting gentlemen into the city to #. business, and then treating them
with rudeness.
The Gov. Are you out of your senses, young gentleman?
Mr. Bean (having recovered his ercellent temper). Not a bit, Governor.
The Times, which of course represents the moneyed interest, announces
that you do all good bills, if the people who bring them really want
the mopuses, and are not trying to make a pot against a rainy day.
Now, here is a capital bill, fifty at three months, three safe names on
the back, and I want the money awfully. So, having complied with
all your requisitions, just come in and write us a cheque, unless you
happen to have the tin in your pocket.
Gov. (smiling). Without endeavouring to disentangle your
Mr. Bean. BEAN, Sir. Think of a brick. - -
The Gov. I am entirely at a loss to understand the object of that last
suggestion; but to dispose of your application, at once, I will just
mention that the dealings of the Bank of England are with commercial
bills, and will wish you, MR. BRICK, a good i. |
..Mr. Bean. BEAN, Sir, And you are so hasty, Governor. I thought
city men piqued themselves on their caution. This is a purely com-
mercial bill... I want every shilling to pay tradespeople, and *...;
a tailor, a wine-merchant, and an oyster-monger; and though I must
give a pound or two to my laundress, her husband keeps a sausage and
cat's-meat shop, so that amount of currency will flow in a commercial
channel, too. Now will you hand over the money?
The Gov. You don’t understand what you are talking about, Sir, and
I cannot waste my time in º; Pray go away. -
Mr. Bean. But, Governor, I am bound to say that this is a very
rotten and fishy way of administering the national cash. I don’t want
to make offensive allusions to SIR John PAUL and MR. REDPATH, but
really to be told to come for money, and then to find all sorts of shady
excuses thrown into one's face, is rather a bit of everlasting humbug
which one would not expect from a British merchant.
The Gov. I am not a British merchant, Sir, so the remark is per-
fectly inoffensive.
Mr. Bean. Now, I consider that you are, Governor, and that you are
trying to sell me. Come, give us the money.
The Gov. I trust, Sir, that when you are at the bar, you will be as
pertinacious, but more discriminating, or your unfortunate clients will
regret having instructed you. -
Mr Bean. Sorry to hear you descending to abuse, Governor, because
it shows you haven’t a leg to stand on...What nonsense you talk about
my affair not being commercial! If I didn't deal with tradesmen, they
wouldn’t want to give orders to manufacturers, and if I paid 'em, they
wouldn't want money from you. . So that I am at once encouraging
commerce, and º. the interest of your Bank, and yet you
bº; over a fifty pound bill. - - -
he Gov. My dear Sir, every one to his trade. Do you go on giving
orders to tradesmen, and not paying them, and we, here, will do our
best to accommodate them with the means of executing the commands
with which you favour them. . -
Mr. Bean. That is the most immoral doctrine I ever heard from an
elderly gentleman in a white choker.
The Gov. What appear the immoralities of commerce are not incom-
patible with social #. -
Mr. Bean. Horrid principles! Besides, Governor, the thing is im-
possible. I can’t get any more credit.
The Gov. In that case, Sir, you must revert to cash payments.
Mr. Bean. But I have got no cash. -
The Gov. In that case, Sir, you must suspend operations. -
iſ: Bean. But I can’t suspend eating and drinking, and wearing
clothes.
The Gov. I regret your inability to comply with the dictates of
mercantile honour, Sir, and must decline further intercourse with a
person so unfortunately situated. [Effects his retreaf.
Mr. Bean. But stop, Governor. Hoy! I say!
[But as the GovertNor does not stop, MR. BEAN reflects for a fetc.
momenis, and thinks he will call on the “Times,” and apprise
the conductors that they are misinformed by their City Corres-
pondent as to the proceedings of the Bank. On second thoughts,
he goes into BIRCh’s, and has some turtle-soup and punch.
Extravagance. -
CLEOPATRA was the first to fling away jewels in the piggish manner,
condemned by the proverb. She was in the habit of throwing pearls
to ANTONY’s (s)wine.

WHAT IS A TUBMAN ?
T THE sitting of the Court of Exchequer
on Monday week, it is reported that—
“At the sitting of the Court to-day, MR.
OGLE was called upon to take his seat as Tub-
man, he having been appointed to that ancient
and honourable office, vacated by the elevation
of MR.LUsh to the dignity of Queen's Counsel.”
We are curious to know what a Tub-
man is? Will MR. John TIMBs, in his
next edition of Things not Generally
Known, kindly inform us? It is so
far satisfactory to know that it is an
“honourable” office; but in what,
pray, does the honour consist P., M.y.
thology acquaints us that the residence
of Truth was at the bottom of a well.
Our legal reports now give us the
information that Honour resides, like
- a second DioGENES, inside a tub.
What does the Exchequer want with a tub more than any other
Court Is it to carry away the fees The Court that of all
others needed the assistance, we should say, of a tub, would have
been the Bail Court; and, for what we know, the duties of this
very Tubman may consist in lending a hand occasionally in bailin
out the different suitors. A cab-stand has its waterman, an
why should not a Court of Law have its Tubman? In our ignorance
of his “ancient and honourable functions,” it may come within the
sphere of this Tubman to hand “refreshers” to the various Counsels
and, speaking at random, it is probable that, for convenience sake, he
keeps all his Tubs in the Rolls’ Court? You may be sure that it is
some meaningless and lucrative office, that, in sense and decency,
ought to be abolished. We should like to see this rotten old tub sent
rolling down hill after our Silver Sticks, and Gold Sticks, and
numerous other sticks and forms that block up the entrance to our
Courts, royal, . and otherwise.
Before conclu #. we will make one more guess. We are all of us
familiar with the AEsopian illustration of the lawyer swallowing the
oyster, and handing the Plaintiff and Defendant each a shell... Now,
it may be the office of this Tubman to be in attendance-like the one
at the Albion, SIMPsoN's, and other places—and open the oysters for
the lawyers!
IRISH PROWERBS.
EveRY goose thinks his wife a duck.
No news in a Newspaper isn’t good news.

A. LESSON IN TOLERATION.
IN DICKENs's Household Words, an old. Thug, in India, is described
as putting his five children through the Thug, exercise; making them
9through the business of strangling and robbing a victim—much as
. Dick ENs's own Fagin practised young thieves in picking pockets.
The narrator informs us that among the lookers-on was “a very
interesting looking woman of about two-and-twenty years of age.” He
i asked her what she thought of the exhibition, and her answer, prettily
couched in a proverb, was:–
“The mango always falls beneath the shade of the parent tree?”
The moral view of the case did not seem to present itself to the
young lady's mind; so her interrogator naturally turned her attention
to that, by asking her opinion of the crime. Mark her exquisitely
beautiful reply:—
“She looked up with as lovely a pair of eyes as ever saw the light, smiled, and
responded, “Heaven will hold us all, Sahib ''”
What a lesson of kindliness and charity this gentle Thug, of the
softer sex of Thugs, should teach us bigoted and intolerant English
people!...When devotees of a different persuasion from our own, commit,
on the Continent, and elsewhere, little outrages upon humanity; such
as the denial of decent burial: when they imprison those who forsake
their sect: when they impose other little restraints upon personal
liberty: when they suppress the sale of books merely for being incon-
sistent with their opinions: when, as now at Vienna, they hinder the
study of medicine and surgery by forbidding dissection: when they
side with tyrants who torture statesmen, and oppose and malign
liberal Sovereigns and their enlightened Ministers: when, nearer home,
they foment sedition, intimidate voters, and evince sympathies more or
less ill-disguised with our enemies, and particularly with murderous
and inhuman rebels: when they exultingly anticipate our downfal, and
gloat over our reverses; when they employ the political power with
which in our once liberal and tolerant mood we trusted them, for the
obstruction of our public business, and in subservience to their own
sectarian views;—why should we allow ourselves to be so enslaved by
our marrow prejudices as to take any notice of such trifles?
DEER-STALKING MADE EASY. A HINT TO LUSTY SPORTSMEN.
i
Doubtless, many of these things are done in perfect sincerity.
“Heaven will hold us all, Sahib l’” And what if those, whose ideas of
veracity are more liberal than ours, occasionally cause the eyes of a
picture or a statue to move, or get up a supernatural apparition, in
order to feed a faith of which the appetite is more craving than our
own? Why should we have the bad taste, to ridicule the sanctified
imposture ? The motive was good; or even if it were bad, what then?
“Heaven will hold us all, Sahib." And why, if the zeal of the pre-
ecessors of certain religionists was once so burning that it consumed
other religionists at the stake, should we remember, far less commemo-
rate, any such painful matter of history? Let us forget it. Let us
bury it in oblivion. If it could be now repeated—if several hundreds
of martyrs could be burned in Smithfield to-morrow, an enlightened
politician would ignore that event the next day. “Heaven will hold
us all, Sahib l’’. And besides that, when men go into Society, they
meet lots of fellows who have formed connections which render any
allusion to such subjects as those above mentioned an unpardonable
offence against good taste. Besides not being genteel, it is }. a bore.
What if a band of pious conspirators, at home and abroad, are saying
and doing all they can to injure old MRs. ENGLAND and her vulgar
institutions? “Heaven will hold us all, Sahib | * Give us a cigar.

A HERO AND A HUMBUG.
LIFE assurance does not prosper in France, owing to the priests,
who have a well-grounded objection to a man's arranging his mone
affairs except when he is upon a sick-bed. But there is another kin
of Assurance which is proverbially French, and of which our diverting
friend MonsLEUR JULLIEN has brought over an exceedingly large
supply. . We had indeed no notion, until a recent Thursday, how
much of the article the musical Hebrew possessed. Upon that occa-
sion—and upon occasion of his producing at the Promenade Concert
a piece of blatant, quackery called a Delhi. Quadrille—MonsLEUR
JULLIEN certainly developed an audacity to which, were we writing of
*# not a mountebank, we should º a harder name.
f he had º the most serious subject of the day as a theme
for fiddles and fifes, and for the delectation of his patrons the gents,
Mr. Punch would scarcely have noticed it. Such topics have been
selected so often, that such dodges have almost become legitimate
devices for folks of the JULLIEN order. To be sure, at the very
moment that M. JULLIEN’s trumpets were braying or piccolos squeaking
in imitation of the sounds of battle, the real thing might have been
going on, and his audience’s fellow-countrymen might have been
slaying and being slain, with all the ghastly accompaniments of the
battlefield. But we agree to forget these things. A quadrille is named
from Delhi, because everybody is thinking about Delhi, no matter in
what connection, and we are really ſº. to M. JULLIEN, or to the
#. writer who supplies his literature and advertisements, for
taking as his theme the terrors of Delhi instead of the horrors of
Cawnpore. This piece of delicacy, this concession to English feelings
could hardly have been expected. We should have repaid his forbear-
ance by silence, but for his subsequent proceeding.
The wife and daughters of the noble soldier who has been fighting a
battle every other day, and, under Providence, saving India to us, had
received a box for the concert, and had occupied it. At the close of
the quadrille a noble idea struck M. JULLIEN–unless, indeed, he had all
along planned his coup, and had entrapped LADY HAVELock in order to
execute it. He, the great Monsieur JULLIEN, conductor of the fiddles,

nable nuisances, the Wans, which the other abominable
nuisance, the Corporation, permits, to block up the traffic
and round which Mr. Punch and the world in gener
dance a frantic dance of triumph whenever the monstrous
and over-loaded piles come to grief. But as the Company's
omnibus so wounded a horse that he had to be killed, the
jury's love of justice triumphed over its hatred of Vans,
and a verdict was given against the Company for Fifty-six
pounds.
But the Second Case was more amusing. The Company
have ºl. in a published document, that it is deter-
mined to promote its interests by the usual means—or
some such words. The usual means, would appear to be
what is called “nursing” any omnibus that presumes to
carry º on the Company's line of road. “Nursing”
means the driving one vehicle close before, and another
close behind, the objectionable, omnibus, so as, to prevent
its getting :*::::A; should it have secured a rider, to

pretty sharply—the hand being that of a conductor of the
opposition omnibus. The nursing experiment havin
crushed and maimed his hand, a † was again appeale

Let us hope that the apparently misplaced energy of
the Company will henceforth be exerted in a way more

[November 28, 1857.
PRIZE LABOUR IN LONDON.
T delights us to an-
nounce that the happy
motion of rewarding
years of service by a
moment’s exhibition on
the platform at a meet-
ing, and the presenta-
tion of a sovereign or
so by Yº of prize-
money, will no longer
be confined to the pro-
vincial districts, but
will be yearly carried
out in those of the Me-
tropolis. In each of
the Ten Towns initialed
by the Post-office steps
are being taken now to
set on foot Societies,
whose aim will be to
give encouragement to
a protracted course of
industry, by holding out
rewards to those who
labour longest. Extremely , odious comparisons have recently been
drawn between the º: lives of servants here in
London and the far more favoured lot of those residing in the country:
whose services are sure (provided only their employer have paid up his
subscription) to meet with their reward at the hands of a Society, with
perhaps an ex-Exchequer Chancellor attending, all alive, to see the
premiums distributed, “.0 fortunati minium. /* has been the general
exclamation of all the London men servants acquainted with the
Georgics : —
“O fortunati mimium, sua si bona nÓrint,
Agricolae quibus ipse, procul politicsque criticsque,
Fundit humi facilem plausum B.º. facundus!"
Besides, as that great orator has stated his conviction that such
societies are “wise and F. undertakings, and have raised the
character of all chasses of the Community,” it is felt that as Londoners
are part of the community, they will clearly be found raisable by this
great elevating influence. Moreover, it is known that the machinery
for raising them will not beyºry costly, if worked upon the principle
adopted in the country. ... “The vulgar test of money,” which MR.
DISRAELI j. of for the valuing of conduct, will be, so far as
it is possible, discountenanced. º but nicely suitable rewards for
merit will be chosen, and annually submitted to a public competition,
The selection of the prizes will be entrusted always to the strictest of
economists, and a committee of Scotchmen will be yearly called upon
to certify that the articles selected are of the lowest market W.
In short, every care will be adopted to ensure the presentation of the
cheapest of rewards, so as to leave no doubt upon the minds of the
recipients that it is not the “mere moneysworth” of the prizes which
are given, by which “the excellence of the individual” is appraised
by the community. -
It will, in fact, be the object of these Metropolitan Societies to
extend the sphere of usefulness, which is limited at present to the
Agricultural Associations; whose members have for years enjoyed an
enviable monopoly in the annual production of their crops of prize
labourers, to whose existence the research of MR. DISRAELI assigns
eleven-twelfths at least of our national prosperity:—
“Commerce and corn may languish and may fail:
Consols decline till there be found no sale :
Still our Prize Peasantry, the platform's pride,
With funds anew Old England will provide.”
To facilitate the growth of the Prize-Servant Crop in London, the
system which has proved so efficacious in the provinces will be generally
adopted by the metropolitan producers, and as fruitful results are as
confidently looked-for as those which have attended the provincial
cultivation. It is conceived that the effects of “emulative competi-
tion” will be shown in our Ten Townsmen as well as in the rustics;
and that the “spirit of improvement” will prove as strong a stimulant,
whether those to be excited by it are countrymen or cockneys. , Wé
are ourselves unwilling to admit that we are ever ignorant of anything,
but we must candidly confess we know of no sufficient reason for
forming any different conception of the matter. Indeed, we entertain
no doubt that if the public-platform system, praised by orator
I}ISRAELI, have really as he says “imparted life” to country clods,
this one successful trial is enough to prove the fact of its “vitalisin
influence,” no matter where that influence may happen to be exercised.
As the Town Associations have not actually started, it is only with
an eye to futurity that we regard their institution. Some preliminary
steps have, we are told, been taken; and by those who support the old
associations they will doubtless be deemed steps in the right direction.
. “For a good Girl,” will
We are, not at liberty as yet to divulge any more than we actually
&nqw; but we at least shall break no confidence, if we give a pen-
and-inkling of the nature of the premiums, which, we have our own
authority to state, will be most probably awarded.
Beginning, as our sex inclines us, with the other, we believe that
the First Prize for the reward of female merit will be a corkscrew and
liqueur-glass to the oldest chamber laundress, on service in the Temple
or any of the Inns: her age to be computed by competent authorities,
and to date not from her birth, but from the commencement of her
legal practice. Candidates will all have to produce their testimonials,
supplied by the gentlemen whose chambers they have tended; and in
cases where the gin-corks of any one employer are shown to have been
tampered with above a dozen times per diem, the candidate shall be
ineligible to receive a premium.
To the Prize Maid-of-all-work, serving in a lodging-house, will be
resented a new cap, of the value of two shillings. No applicant,
owever, will be suffered to compete unless provided with certificates
that in at least three situations j within a twelvemonth, the dura-
tion of her service has been longer than a fortnight. . Extra premiums
of ribbon will also be awarded, if sufficient proof be furnished that, in
five times out of twelve, any candidates have wiped the black-lead from
their fingers before trifling with the jam-pots; and a pair of worsted
mittens, of not less cost than fourpence, will be given where two
lodgers shall be found attesting witnesses that they have ever had
their shaving-water brought up hot enough to use, and within twenty
minutes from the time they rang for it.
A Prize, Snuff-box, priced at Sixpence, will be publicly contended
for by workers-out as charwomen, being offered as a stimulus to their
competitive exertions. Any candidate attested by the master of a
dwelling-house to have gone through a day’s charring without leaving
her ; for him to break his shins against, will be presented, in
addition, with a new pair of pattens.
All early-rising housemaids who can prove they have got up within
five-and-twenty minutes after “missus’ bell have rung”, for them, will
be rewarded for their merit by a cotton nightcap ; and the Prize Cook,
who brings evidence of having kept her temper, during dinner-serving
time, once a week upon an average throughout a twelve months’ service,
will be entitled to receive an ornamen pepper-box, engraved with an
appropriate inscription of the fact. Small pecuniary premiums will also
be awarded to maid-servants who prove that they have entertained their
“cousins” not more than twice a week where followers have been
forbidden; and any cook who shows that she has passed a fortnight in
a family, without having asked a policeman in to sup with her, will
receive a wreath of daisies from the hands of the Society, in recog-
nition of her virtuous and self-denying abstinence.
The Prize Monthly Nurse who never makes excuse of her weakly
constitution to have sweetbreads for her dinner, and “somethink
otted hup” for supper, with a rum-and-water nightcap medicinally
after it, will receive a child’s mug, mottoed in gold letters with the
words “Reward of Merit,” and a satin ribbon book-marker inscribed
be presented to the nursemaid who can take
her charges to the park, without reading a romance, or flirting with a
soldier. The prizes for male servants will be, similarly chosen. A
whisker-brush and pocket-comb will be awarded to Adonises in plush
and powder, who can now and then so far forget their ornamental
qualities as to make themselves of use to anybod but their masters;
and a prize of a new shaving-pot will be publicly presented to any
British footman who can so far forget the precedents of plush as to
treat the “fambly” governess with an occasional approach to some-
thing like civility. #. groom who never lends nor lets his master's
horses will get a pair of riding-gloves and half-a-crown for beer;
while the Buttons who is proved to have ever gone an errand without
stopping on the way to have a game of marbles or a pennyworth of
. : will be awarded six large brandy-balls and a prize penny
whistle.
We have said enough to indicate the nature of the premiums by
which deserving servants will in London be rewarded. It will be
owned there is no fear of the prizes being prized for their intrinsic
value; and we see no reason why they should not prove as strong
“encouragements of iº ” as those which are provided in pro-
yincial districts. We have little doubt ourselves that the prizes we
have mentioned as awardable in town will be as thoroughly “appre-
ciated ” by their praiseworthy recipients, as are the soverei
presented for long service in the country: of which appreciation
MR. DISRAELI's insight has enabled him to state that “the manner
of receiving them” is a convincing proof. “Miserable critics” may
sneer at the sheer worthlessness of the articles presented, but we may
remind them that merit, like virtue, is its own reward; and that,
since good servants are in fact beyond, all, price, it is idle to attempt
to present, them with a prize which should in any way pretend to
represent their money value.
“We reward,” as MR.DISRAELI has so analogously put it; “wereward
with prizes of blue and red riband acts of the greatest patriotism and
heroism;’ and surely therefore Servantism need not be affronted, if the
rewards it is presented with are as intrinsically valueless. A sovereign

“received in the spirit in which it is offered” is doubtless quite as
much appreciated at the end of fifty years of service, as the presen-
tation of a cottage to be held rent-free, and five-and-twenty pounds ºr
so per annum for a maintenance. To encourage length of servitude
the honours of the platform are honours long eferred, however much
the critics may denounce them as shortcoming; and if the system has
proved one of such bucolic benefit, it is time that London Servants
should likewise be improved, upon the plan of Slow Rewards and Very
Little Profits.
THE INVISIBLE PICTURES.
EARLY everyone has heard of pictures that
can only be seen in a certain light, and
of others so contrived that they can only
be seen from a certain direction. But the
most magical paintings are those in the
National Gallery. They are invisible, ex-
cept by glimpses, from the opening of the
doors until one o'clock in the day. The
henomenon has been variously explained,

other morning, to get a view of the new
WERONESE, we fancied we had solved the

ome to dinner; so nursery-maids must
depart, and, soldiers having no further
reason for lounging against the rail, the
pictures come into view.—Q. E. D.
A SCENE IN A CHURCHYARD. GROSS OUTRAGE ON
THE ACTORS.
WE are sorry to say that, at Lewes, the other day, the British
Public allowed itself to be betrayed into excitement and violence.
It rushed upon a reverend gentleman and seven or eight Sisters of
Mercy, turned them out of a churchyard, hunted them through the
streets, and tore the ladies' dresses and the priest’s surplice and hat.
It chased them into a public-house at Southover, and then remained
outside, yelling and shouting “No Popery!” The poor priest con-
trived to slip away from the public-house, and bolted in his shirt-
sleeves across a field to the railway-station. Whether his shirt-sleeves
were all the clothes he had on, or not, the contemporary from whom
we derive the ſº does not state. By the help of the police
the Sisters of Mercy were conveyed to the same place in a fly, followed
by the British Public and the boys, who continued whooping and
crying “No Popery!”
What provocation could have so highly exasperated the British
Public, and so inflamed its noble mind with rage as to urge it to hoot
a priest and a party of ladies through the streets, and tear the clothes,
not only of the former but also of the latter, forgetful of all respect
for the cloth, and even of all reverence for the Crinoline?
It appears that after the conclusion of the burial service, the priest,
the REy. MR. NEIL, attempted to read an additional service, contrary
to the desire of the officiating clergyman, and also to the wish of the
father of the deceased. One of the bystanders then cried, “No
Popery !” another exclaimed, “Muck him out !”—and this suggestion
seems to have been immediately acted upon. The Sisters of Mercy
apparently involved themselves in the reverend gentleman's calamity,
by acting with him, or, taking a part in his performance as super-
numeraries in a very melancholytscene.
The priest who thus contrived to attract the British Public at his
heels, and the heels of his female attendants was not, we apprehend, a
regular Roman, although his pursuers bawled “No Popery!” We
suppose that he was merely one of those imitative English parsons
who ape the alien original. Nor do we imagine that his assistants of
the softer sex were genuine nuns; we surmise that they were but
mimic sisters, and not so much even, as half-sisters.
Of course such mock-brothers and sham sisters have a right to play
. if they please; but they should choose some other theatre than
a churchyard. However we may deplore the maltreatment which they
experienced at the hands of an . British Public, we cannot
wonder that such actors were hissed off such a stage.

CASE OF CLERICAL NERVOUSNESS.
SOME years ago, an advertisement was continually appearing in the
jº. announcing that “a Clergyman of Cambridge University,”
aving cured himself of a nervous disorder with which he had been
afflicted for many years, offered, “from benevolence rather than gain,”
to cure others. For some time we have missed this old familiar
advertisement; and we are afraid that, its author sleeps with his
fathers, and with DR. DULCAMARA. But if that divine and empiric, and
ornament of the University of Cambridge, is still in the land of the
living, and if he really can cure others of nervous diseases, it would be
desirable, for the friends of a nervous patient, to invoke his assistance
in a case thus reported by the Caernarvon Herald:—
“The Rev. D. R. DAVIEs is an extreme Puseyite, holding very high doctrines on
Priestly authority and the powers of the Church. On a recent occasion he declined
to be present at a festive treat given by a gentleman of large property in the neigh-
bourhood to the children of the various schools, alleging “that he could not sanction
with his presence any communication between the children of the Church and the
children of Dissenters, heretics, and schismatics, who were out of the pale of salvation.”
The above forms the conclusion of an account of a scene which the
reverend gentleman named in the narrative is reported to have caused
in Rhos-y-medre Church, Rhuabon, during Communion, by extraor-
- behaviour exhibited towards a brother clergyman. If it is
correct as to facts, Benevolence rather than Gain should be instantly
appealed to on his behalf, provided that Benevolence can do anything
for him, even although not without deriving considerable gain from
the transaction. He must, indeed, be very far gone in º, and
ought to have his hair removed in time, and before his malady shall
have reached that final stage in which the sufferer often shaves his
own head. That head has taken unto itself the notion that the children
of Dissenters are out of the pale of salvation. It is a pity that such a
head, whilst it continues to be so hot as it is, should long remain out
of a pail of cold water.

APPALLING LEGAL NEWS.
MR. JUSTICE ERLE did one day last week, administer to MR.
SERJEANT THoMAs the following rebuke:–
“The licence of questioning allowed to Counsel had become a public nuisance.
For some questions a barrister ought to be prosecuted.”
In consequence of these observations, a meeting of certain members
of the Bar '. been held at the Alibi Tavern, and the following reso-
lution has been unanimously agreed to:-
“That this meeting views with alarm and disgust, the possible interference of the
Judge with the free and unbridled exercise of speech by the British Advocate, and
considers that if a barrister, in the exercise of his vocation, is to be interdicted from
questions to any witness, implying that such witness, if a man, is dishonest, and if
a woman, is unvirtuous, such barrister is crippled in the discharge of the sacred
duty for which he is hired. And this meeting hereby records, its conviction, that
if such restriction be enforced, no honourable and highminded man call hence-
forward accept a brief.”
The profession is, however, under the circumstances, as well as can
be expected—or desired.

Every ten years or thereabouts that regularly seizes me;
A sort of a contraction, with a tightness and a dizziness,
That won't allow a body for to go about her business.
It comes on with a pressure, and a clutching and a clawing,
Then there’s a running at the chest, a pulling, and a drawing,
And then there is an emptiness, and sort of feel of sinking,
With a kind of nervous shaking, and a fainting and a shrinking.
And then I’ve noises in my ears; a breaking and a crashing,
A blowing up and bursting, and a falling, and a smashing,
Which worries me to that degree which is beyond expressing,
None knows but they that feels how them there noises is distressing.
I feel that I must die if this goes on a minute longer,
Then some one comes and cuts my stays and I’m directly stronger.
Which makes them say Ilace too tight-I scorn the accusation:
But I must have that support for to maintain my situation.
The truth is this; I’m worrited by nephews and by nieces,
That plagues me, and that bothers me, and tears me into pieces,
They go too fast a pace for me, pursuing some delusion,
And then I lag, and the result is ruin and confusion.
I am too old a soldier to cajole, or coax, or wheedle,
And still enjoy so good a sight that I can thread my needle,
My dwelling is Threadneedle Street, and England is my nation,
And Parliament and PALMERston I look to for salvation.
A “WESSEL * OF WRATH.
THE exultation of the Editor of the Record at learning that the
second attempt to launch the Great Ship had failed was perfectly
ecstatic. The amiable religionist had specified his belief that the
defeat of the first attempt, and the killing two of the workmen was a
judgment of Providence upon the directors of the company for calling
the ship Leviathan, a name which some interpreters of THE Book
conceive to mean Satan, while others think it denotes something the
Record considers a great deal worse, namely, the Church of Rome.
The Record appears to believe that unless the name is changed, the
vessel will, if º, sink. The ill-success of the new attempt,
on Thursday, the 19th, has confirmed our contemporary’s convictions.
Yet, if the name of a ship is really of such awful import, what would
the Record say to one who should set out on a missionary excursion,
deliberately embarking on board a vessel named after two Pagan demi-
gods, who, when on earth, were the foulest criminals, treacherous
murder being one of their offences. -
The so-called Evangelicals are not celebrated for their learning, and
therefore we will explain that we allude to the Dioscuri, better known
as CAston AND Poilux, whose names were borne by the Alexandrian
vessel selected by the great ApostLE of THE GENTILEs to take him
to Italy—and which did take him there in }: safety. But...it
would not in the least surprise us to find the Record, with its superior
lights, accusing St. PAUL of “presumption”—the school to which our
contemporary belongs is by no means reverent when its Pharisaical
tenets are controverted.
Fellow Feeling among Foreigners.
SoME of our continental contemporaries are greatly shocked at the
severity with which our conquering troops have punished the mis-
greants who outraged and tortured. En * women and children.
Perhaps they can more easily *. the unpleasantness of the
punishment than the atrocity of the crime.

HERE is something afflict-

that, in spite of Matri-

speak of the quatrennial
recurrence of the oppor-
tunities of Leap Year,
there is still kept up a
standing army of those
blighted beings yelept

ally driven to make known

and (receive into them a
wife. Bein
PARAGONS
of a sensitive
and sympathising nature,
- we generally lose an
= *. a-week from
the saddening announce-
ments which appear in
Sunday papers, headed
with the word “Matri-
mony,” and tailed with an
address where addresses
will be paid to ladies who
- - apply for them. Were we
of either French or fashionable de extraction, we should confess that
we are “desolated” weekly by regrets, that these lone ones have as
yet found no philanthropist to help them, and save them the expense
of advertising their heart-wants. Surely an appeal might be urged to
the Benevolent, asking aid to set on foot a Connubial Humane Society,
where proper means of rescue from a life of single wretchedness might
be had on application at the dépôts or receiving-houses. Ladies of all
aspects might be kept on show by the Society, and cards to view
supplied to the forlorn ones who required them; substantial guarantee
being furnished by the applicants that their better halves would be
inducted into comfortable quarters.
Meanwhile, in the absence of this charitable institution, we think
that we may do the single state some service if we suggest another
way of filling up the vacuum which the advertising gentlemen announce
in their affections. If we happened to be single (Judy, pardon us the
thought!) and felt doubtful, where to look for a heart-treasure of a
wife, we really think we should betake ourselves to a Domestic Out-of-
Place Office, and ask some highly recommended housemaid to be
partner of our bosom. Judging from the requisitions we see daily in
the papers, we feel sure that if perfection exists anywhere in petticoats,
it is personified on this side of the Channel by a maid-servant. See
here, for example, what a bundle of requirements we found the other
day inserted in the Times: and the catalogue is really not much longer
than is now becoming usual. We quote word for word, merely changing
the address to one which, we conceive, if there be anything in names,
reads rather more appropriate:–
WANTEP, for a gentleman's family, TWO MAID SERVANTS; one
as good cook, with a thorough knowledge of foreign dishes, to assist in the
housework; the other as nurse and housemaid, good needlewoman, to wait well at
table. Both must be early risers, with personal recommendations for strict honesty,
sobriety, cleanliness, º good temper, trustworthiness, and respectability.
Wages,—Housemaid, about £10 per annum, everything found; beer money, three
er day. Apply by letter only to MRs. FIDGETs, Omelette Villa, Grub
ench person, with good references, preferred. No Irish need apply.
half-pence
Street. A
There is somewhat of ambiguousness in the verbiage of this : for
instance, how a knowledge of foreign dishes is “to assist in the house-
work” it is not slightly puzzling to a male mind to conceive: but it is
clear at least that persons who respond to MRs. FIDGETs' advertise-
ment must, in addition to their other properties, possess considerable
cheek. To own herself the owner of ; a string of qualities as is
specified above, an applicant must needs be anything but modest; and
it is hardly º: would put so low a value on herself as to come
to terms with . F. at the wages above hinted at. There is a
vagueness in the phrase “about £10 per annum,” which to cautious
minds would somewhat seem to smack of the suspicious; but even
ting that this sum be paid down annually in full, it would
e scarcely giving more than a sovereign apiece for the good qualities
engaged for it. Merely in that one sentence which begins with “early
rising,” and exhausts itself at length in the word “respectability,”
there are specified no less than eight distinct essentials; and besides
all these, the cook must be “good,” as well in cookery as temper, and
however highly, she be thought of by those who recommend her, she
must not think herself above assisting in the housework: an assistance
which is certainly not more than will be needed, where the nurse, that
is the housemaid, is to serve also, habitually, as Sempstress and as
waiter. One would think the labour-market must be tolerably glutted,
when requirements such as these are quoted at so low a figure as a
£10 note per annum, plus three half-pennies per diem for expenditure
in beer; an allowance which might almost lead recipients to fancy
that their character for soberness was thought a little doubtful.
It is said that a demand induces always a supply, and we presume
that MRs. FIDGETs will find what she was “wanting” at the date of
her advertisement. For ourselves, with the experience which we have
had as housekeepers, we should as soon have thought of advertising
for a pair of female Dodos, as for a pair of female servants such as
MRs. F., has pictured. A good-tempered cook and an early rising
housemaid, have long been classed in our belief with the extinct
creation: and we have imagined that one might, as well expect to find
the Lost Tribes of Israel, by now inserting in the Times a reward for
their discovery.
But, really-to conclude as we commenced—if such paragons of
femininity as . F. requires, exist, we should recommend all wife-
seekers to be on the look-out for them. Such housemaids should at
once be offered their promotion from the scrub-brush to the key-
basket, and should be no ºf. let to waste their sweetness upon the
dusty air. “ Clean, active, and good-tempered”—what more would man
require? And “trustworthy” withaſ! No fear of a new bonnet
being, once a-week or so charged among the puddings! Clearly,
bachelors at any rate should copy, MR. FIDGETs; for were they
advertising for a wife, they could not well be more particular. For
ourselves, we are most happily in no want of that article; and should
we hear of such personified perfections as MRs. F. requires, she may
rely, at least, we shall, not be connubially deterred from forwarding
them on to her. As it is, however, we have not the remotest notion
where such paragons in petticoats exist, and we can therefore but
assure her of our wish that she may get them.
A SPICY ARTICLE.
IN RE Woolf LEyy, alias HoRACE MonTEFIORE, alias WILLIAM
LANGFEIDT, alias WILLIAM Lyon, before MR. CoMMIssionER PHIL-
LIPs, in the Insolvent Court, the subjoined conversation is reported to
have occurred between the learned Commissioner and the unfortunate,
but worthy, insolvent;, the latter having stated that about 1850 he
had visited the United States with another gentleman in º
as general dealers, and that, in that capacity, they had travelle
throughout the Union with American curiosities:–
“CoMMissionER. What are American curiosities?
“INsolvent. Wooden nutmegs, and such things.
“CoMMIssionER. Did you sell them for real spice?
“INsolvent. We did. (Continued laughter.)
“CoMMissioner. And did you persuade the Yankees to buy them 2
“INsolve NT. They did not know the difference. We sold them in the cities of
the West, Indianapolis, and other places. Others sold wooden hams, but we did not.”
Probably, this respectable merchant deceived himself in the suppo-
sition that the Yankees actually took the wooden nutmegs for real ones.
Of course, they were far too 'cute to make any such mistake. They
affected to receive, them as genuine out of that politeness which is
characteristic of American gentlemen. MR. Woolf LEvy, in the
simplicity of his nature, could not conceive them capable of such
dissimulation; but doubtless the fact was, that the Yankees knew very
well what sort of nutmegs they were buying, and bought them to sell
again.
When we ascribe innocence to MR. Woolf LEVy, perhaps we are
in a measure wrong. We may be incorrect as to the name. It would
probably be better to say WILLIAM LANGFELDT. WILLIAM is a
Christian name, and LANGFELDT does not seem to imply descent from
ABRAHAM. And the funny little trick of selling wooden nutmegs for
real spice is just that which one can hardly imagine a gentleman, who
really rejoices in such names as Woolf LEvy, playing.
(Laughter.)

M.P. for Finsbury, hurried off, the other morning, to ascertain the fact for himself.
He first called at the Divan in the Strand, and began his inquiries., MR, RIEs

when, if he did not receive the information he wanted, he

[R. KILPACK, after some meditation, said that he did
not think any question about Moldavia had been raised

speaking about the Wallachs, though whether it was
AMEs or HENRY he was not sure. He invited MR. Cox
to enter the American alley, and see whether anybody
there looked likely to be able to satisfy him; but MR. Cox,

revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other, and

somewhat hastily, and went away, declaring that he would

SILLY SOLONS.
CERTAIN Magistrates of Wakefield have (if a report
before us be trustworthy) singularly illustrated the extreme
fitness of the country gentleman for the judicial duty. One
of those foreign rascals, so dear to our female population,
one of the scoundrels who import, unfortunate creatures
to grind organs for the torment of rational persons, was
charged at Wakefield with brutal ill-treatment of a poor
|German girl. Her hurdy-gurdy, or whatever nuisance, it
was, had not lº. sufficient hushmoney on a particular
day, and so the fellow—her fellow-countryman—is sworn
to have assaulted her abominably, and taken away her
shoes and stockings, and some other º of her dress.
The case was clearly made out, and then the Magistrates
made fools of themselves, collectively, by inflicting a trifling
fine, and one of them made himself a fool, individually, by
an offensive, and silly speech. The ruffian was amerced
in twenty shillings, and the Justice said “Such things
might, do, in Germany, but would not do here.” The
ridiculously slight fine speaks for its own º and
anybody who knows the tºº. is aware that brutality is
the very last charge which can be brought against them.
They smoke, and drink beer, and talk queer philosophy,
and do very little, but they are a very humane people,
and far in advance of ourselves in the knowledge of what
is due to the so-called weaker sex. We assume the accu-
racy of the report, but should be glad to learn that it is
incorrect, for the sake of the British bench and British
courtesy. -

HUMOUR'S OF THE CITY COMMISSION OF SEWERS.
WE record with'pleasure"a few amenities of language interchanged
between some worthy members of the City. Commission of Sewers,
which afford a fresh indication that the City is beginning to be itself
again, and to transact business after the worshipful old fashion. . At a
meeting of the Court of that civic Commission, the Chairman
announced that the Ilford Cemetery had been consecrated the day
before by the BISHOP OF LONDON, and highly praised the arrange-
ments made on the occasion, by the Burial Board Committee, for the
convenience and comfort of those who had been invited to attend. He
also strongly eulogised, the conduct of the Bishop, and the discourse
delivered by the Right, Reverend Prelate. In the praise of the
arrangements one fº however, could not concur. MR.
DEPUTY LOTT complained that “he himself was shut out from the
chapel after struggling and fighting his way through a dense mob, and
was umable to witness the ceremony.” Whereupon DEPUTY Bow ER,
after making some laudatory remarks on the Bishop's address, which
he described as “so wise and so impressive, that every Dissenting
clergyman in the Kingdom would have been proud to have delivered
it,” observed that—
“DEPUTY Lott, no doubt purposely kept in the background during the perform-
ance of the ceremony, in order that he might find an opportunity of making a com-
plaint, which was his invariable custom. (Hear, hear.)”
Strange to say, this extremely personal imputation of motives
elicited no retort—no reply even—from DEPUTY LOTT–who presently,
however, showed that his silence probably was owing to deafness
rather than forbearance. The altercation was taken up, with a slightly
irrelevant turn, by MR. H. L. TAYLOR, in the following polite and
humorous speech —
“MR. H. L. TAYLOR. I am glad to find that so many people were pleased with
the address of the Bishop. I should have been at the cemetery yesterday but for a
circumstance which prevented me, and which will prevent me at any future time
from visiting it. I allude to the armorial bearings of our clerk, MR. Daw. Three
jackdaws form a sort of heraldic device or bearing, which, with the worst taste, has
een placed against one of the houses. These are called the armorial bearings of
MR. Joseph D.Aw, the clerk to the commission. So long as they remain there, I never
will be a party to put my foot inside that place. (Laughter.)”
MR, TAYLOR's heraldry would seem to be small, whatever may be
thought of his breeding. On the former point he was gently corrected
by the supposed exhibitor of the symbols which he took for armorial
bearings; who gave him the following brief lesson in blazon:-
“MR. Daw. I may state that the armorial bearings referred to by MR, TAYLoR
are not jackdaws, they are three crosses. (Laughter.)"
The conversation on the ceremony of the previous day—not a word
having been uttered about the sewers over which the Commission is
supposed to preside—went on a little further without any reciprocation
of civic ††, until, on a vote of thanks to the Bishop,
“DEPUTY Lott, in supporting the resolution, loudly complained that he was
not able to hear the sentence of consecration.”
Doubtless he had also not heard the speech of DEPUTY Bow ER; for
if he had, it would of course have produced alittle explosion of feeling,
like that evinced in the succeeding dialogue:–
“MR. ABRAHAM. M.R. DEPUTY Lott was in the foremost rank.
“DEPUTY Lott. You are stating that which you know is untrue.
“MR. ABRAHAM. You were.
“DEPUTY Lott. I deny it. (Confusion.)”
veracity might have been adjourned to Chalk Farm, even from a City
meeting—a time happily past. The courtesies of debate, however,
were thus further exemplified :-
“MR. ABRAHAM. I witnessed it with my own eyes...MR. Deputy Lott was
present in the chapel during the whole of the first stage of the proceedings for more
than half an hour until we went out to perambulate the grounds. He might have
read the sentence of consecration—it was printed. .
“DEPUTY Lott. I had a right to be inside to hear it. -
“MR. ABRAHAM. You were standing within a few feet of the Bishop.
“DEPUTY Lott. That's wholly untrue. (Confusion.)”
Here the Chairman interfered—not too soon, perhaps. If he had
not, bottles"might have been thrown—had there been any at hand.
Such a growſing and grunting and barking as that above quoted, we
have not heard in the City for many a day. Such a mode of trans-
acting civic business had almost fallen into desuetude. To read of it
will make many of our senior subscribers feel quite young again. Some
people may think the language, with specimens of which we have been
entertaining them, unbecoming. It is not, altogether unbecoming:
“Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat,”—and sewers have foul
mouths. We need not complete the parallel.
There was a time when the further discussion of this question of

MORE NEWS OF ALEXANDER POPE.
(From the Literary Gazette.)
THE world of letters will rejoice to hear that in addition to the
recent invaluable discoveries bearing upon the history of ALEXANDER
PQFE, the poet, several new facts have come to light. Although these
will tend to render useless and obsolete all the existing biographies of
the bard of Twickenham, the truth in such matters is too important
and solemn not to be received with gratitude even by those who may
suffer. Without further prelude, we are enabled to announce, first,
that the dog “Harlequin,” which was presented to the wife of BISHQF
ATTERBURy, was never quite cured of its broken leg, and ultimately
died of the distemper, in or about 1724. Secondly, that EDMUND
Čunli's maternai untić had a severe attack of toothache injune, 1716.
Thirdly, that the Christian name of the wife of the Sexton at Twicken-
ham was not JANE, but JoAN. Fourthly, that the # himself some-
times shaved himself, but not often, though he would frequently apply
the lather, leaving the razor to his servant. Fifthly, that though not
robust enough for much gardening, he would often remove dead leaves
from the bed with a smaſhoe (by the way, does, this throw any light
on the line: “Every, woman, is at heart a rake”?), Sixthly, that
MARTHA BLOUNT took very little sugar in her tea, and also liked to
sit, in the evening, with her shoes down at heel, because that arrange-
ment gave relief to her corns. (Mark that, MR. CoRNEY.) Seventhly,
d Pope on with his scarlet cloak behind the
scenes, after Mustapha, the poet desired him to let the servant do it.
Eighthly, that the poet was much displeased, when, on some one saying
that the verse of his Odyssey swept nobly along, LoRD CHESTERFIELD
f BROOME in it.” And
lastly, that the little ivory instrument with which Pope used to adjust
his nails never came into HoRACE WALPole's possession at all, but
was given by LADY HERVEY (MoLLY LEPEL) to the grandfather of a
Welsh gentleman whose name we have not yet discovered, but who
lived, or at all events was in Montgomeryshire in 1819. . These facts,
though they may tend to overthrow many received theories, and may
startle those who deem themselves best acquainted with the poet’s
THE MODEL WIFE IN 1857.
SHE dwells in fair Belgravia's halls,
Sweet Fashion's peerless Queen,
And all her soul, infºtes and balls,
Is in her Crinoline.
Her “jupon,” like the Nassau globe,

Flaunts its inflated gauzy robe,
Or swirls tempestuously.
And thus expanding more and more,
She fluctuates in her walk,
Subduing SWAN AND EDGAR's corps
With undulating talk.
She names a time, with kindling eye,
When, soaring through the air,
Sweet maids, balloon like, up shall fly,

LAWN-SLEEVES AND SHIRT-SLEEVES.
ANY respectable persons will perhaps be
very much shocked by the following
statement made the other day by the
BISHOP OF LINCQLN, in addressing a
meeting of the Church Pastoral Aid
Society:—
“Nevertheless, out-door preaching was a
most valuable aid to the minister of a large
arish. “For the first time," said the incum-
nt of Nottingham Church to him, a short
time ago, “since I have been appointed to this
Church, I saw men at Church in their shirt-
sleeves soon after I commenced open-air preach-
ing.” Now, he (the Bishop) did not say that it
was desirable that persons should come to
Church in their shirt-sleeves, but if they were
to be in their shirt-sleeves, they had better go
to Church than elsewhere.”
Ladies belonging to the superior
classes often carry smelling-bottles with
them to Church, lest they should faint
there; but the precaution of providing themselves with Leamington
salts will be even more generally taken by them in visiting a place
of worship, if they think they are likely to be horrified by the
sight of men in shirt-sleeves among the congregation. The fact
that a Bishop has expressed, an opinion that shirt-sleeves under
any circumstances are admissible in Church, is calculated to excite
terror and alarm in exclusive circles. The beadle of every fashion-
able Church, which, is furnished with a gallery will, of course, be
directed to show, all comers in shirt-sleeves into that part of the
building, inasmuch as the law will not permit him to turn them back
from the doors, for the reason that they are not in correct costume.
A grate or screen of ornamental scroll-work will have to be erected
in front of every such gallery, in order to conceal the horrid men
who, sit there, and most of whom not only would otherwise appear
in shirt-sleeves, but also in beards of a week's growth. How to
º of these shocking fellows in the new Churches, which are
built without galleries or pews, will puzzle the authorities. In
some of these, where the service is conducted in the histrionic manner,
the officiating priest will perhaps sprinkle the shirt-sleeved portion of
his flock with eau-de-Cologne, and call it holy water. After what the
BISHQP OF LIN colN has said upon the subject, it will perhaps be
considered, in elegant society, that he himself stands decidedly in need
of some sort of purification. Most sweet voices will vote that he
Qught to be deodorized, and disinfected, and perfumed. They will
doubtless propose to sweeten him with chloride of lime,' and then to
scent him with lavender-water, or fumigate him with incense.
Where, it will be demanded by the better orders, can people in their
shirt-sleeves expect to go to ? And how, then, can a Bishop think
them fit to go to Church in such a state? The public-house is the
place for them; the proper accompaniments of shirt-sleeves are a pipe
and a pewter-pot. It is quite clear that the Bishop of LINcol N is
forgetful of his dignity, and utterly regardless of the difference and the
º which have so long existed between lawn-sleeves and shirt-
Sleeves.
REDEEMERS OF OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER.
IT may be, in a measure, true that we are, as a nation, somewhat
too intent on aggrandizement, and that we are apt to make a little too
much haste to rich. Yet there are not wanting among us noble
examples of disinterestedness, evinced in the most tremendous pecu-
niary sacrifices. For instance, the Times says that—
“The Election Auditor for the North Riding of Yorkshire, has published his
return of the expenses incurred at the last Election for that Division of the County,
from which it appears that between £11,000 and £12,000 was spent by the three
candidates—viz., about £6,000 by the HoN. Colonel, DUN.combe, M.P., nearly
£5,000 by the HoN. J. C. DuNDAs, and only £620 by MR. E. S. CAYLEY, M.P.”
Now, take even the last and least of these sums; it really would be
a great deal for a man to spend for the good of his country, even if the
mere expenditure were all. But when we consider that the money is
expended in order that the donor may make the additional sacrifice of
time and labour for his country's benefit, we are lost in admiration of
such munificent patriotism, which, did we not roll in unbounded riches,
we should hardly know how to imitate. When we look further, and
see honourable gentlemen paying from £5,000 to £6,000 to obtain a
seat in Parliament, our admiration rises into astonishment. The worst
of this is, that it swamps our veneration for kings who shared their
loaves, and saints who divided their cloaks, with beggars, in the days
of old. What is such small charity to the romantic generosity of
modern Members of Parliament, who strip themselves of so many
thousands in order that they may serve their constituents, and that
with the severest toil? What excellent legislation ours ought to be
since our legislators are so earnest in their task, and so devoted And
WOL. XXXIII.
what is their reward? The thanks of a grateful nation? Not neces-
sarily; on the contrary, they are often abused in the newspapers for
their conduct, and on the hustings, hissed and pelted with ståle eggs.
Beyond the applause of a good conscience within, whilst perhaps an
ungrateful people pelts and hisses them without, what can these
chivalrous gentlemen, who give so much money for a place in
Parliament, expect to get for it?
SEWERITY OF THE WEATHER.
As a proof of the extreme severity of the weather, we may mention
that we saw last week, at the house of MRs. MATERFAMILIAs, a mag-
mificent Christmas-Tree in full bloom. . We have the authority of that
º lady for stating, that she gathered from it, only the evening
before, as much as an indiarubber ball, two postilion boots, six paste.
board drums, one walnut-shell work-box, one wooden squirrel (whose
stomach, we noticed, cleverly contrived to do duty as a nutcracker)
besides a whole apronful...of dolls, sugar-plums, tin trumpets, coloure
candles, and bonbons. There was a variety of fruit, also—preserved,
waxen, cotton, and otherwise. An * which could scarcely have
been ripe, for it was as hard as wood, belonged to a very curious
species, for upon its being opened in the middle, a whole set of baby’s
tea-things was found inside, instead of the ordinary pips. On looking
into it, it seemed to us to be a kind of Hoax-apple.
We believe that it is extremely rare that a *istmas Tree has been
known to bear fruit at such an early period of the year. The 25th of
December is generally supposed to be the earliest day on which the
various branches of this very fruitful tree arrive, at full perfection.
Christmas Day is the grand harvest-home of all Christmas-Trees, but
MRs. MATERFAMILIAS has anticipated that auspicious event, by nearly
four weeks. Her numerous progeny are in a state of the most irre-
pressible ecstacy over this premature inauguration, though we regret to
state that, at the last moment of going to press, the rumour reached
us that the family doctor had been sent for in the greatest hurry.
MITRES AND FIGHTERS.
OUR beloved hierarchs have had a meeting, and have resolved, that
the real remedy for India is the creating new episcopal sees. Mr. Punch,
with HAVELock in view, begs to turn Dissenter, and to cry, not
“More Bishops,” but More Baptists.
“BRAvo,
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!
A CLEAN sweep has been made of Holywell Street." The obscene
pigeons have been turned out of the dirty dove-cotes.” But while
the pigeons have been vexed, censure spares the crows. The rookery
of the quacks is undisturbed, and their vile and lying advertisements
still pollute the country newspapers, and some of the London journals,
and #. upon the tables of fathers of families to afford Sunday reading
to their sons and daughters. ...To go through Holywell Street or not

afflicted with partial blindness.

If there be any excellence more than any other for which this
publication is conspicuously famous, it is for its unflinching praise an
advocacy of all ancient institutions, and for the efforts which it makes
to ºvert their abolition. Conservative to the backbone, Punch is always
at his post to defend all good old nuisances against, the onslaught of
Reformers, and proclaim himself the champion of all the vested wrongs
which are a Briton's birthright as they are his boast. Every reader
will remember how zealously we strove to perpetuate Protection, and
avert the doom which robbed us of our cherished Smithfield Market:
and we can point, with a proud finger to the course we have pursued in
upholding Temple Bar, and the throne of Gog and MAgog, and
defending the time-honoured Courts of Probate and of Chancery. In
short, whenever any Bulwark of the State has been attacked, we have
always pointed out that the nation would fall with it: and whatever
follies have descended from the “wisdom of our ancestors,” we have
always done our utmost to preserve them for posterity. .
Quae cºmita sint—as we never wrote a school theme without more
than once remarking-it may surprise our constant readers to be told
that we for once must make exception to our rule, and must claim to
be excused from the defending of a Nuisance. It afflicts us to confess
that we are at length induced to doubt the wisdom of the Game Laws,
and the justice of the Justices who are commissioned to dispense them.
The case which has compelled us to forswear our old allegiance, and
retire from the championship of both Game Laws and preservers, was
brought the other day before the Court of Queen's Bench, and is thus
epitomised by the Daily News paper:—
“The defendant MR. BALLERY, a person of considerable property, and a Justice
of the Peace for the County of Durham, had two men brought before him by a
couple of policemen, charged with the destruction of a rabbit on his own property.
Instead of at once declining, as an interested person, to act in the matter, Mr.
BALL.NY convicted the delinquents in a severe penalty, ordered them in default of
immediate payment to be handcuffed and sent to prison, and finally compromised
the matter by liberating them on payment of a sovereign a-piece, which instead of
handing over to the County fund, he put into his own pocket.”
For this trifling offence a criminal information was filed against the
Magistrate, and a jury having found him guilty of corruption and
extortion under colour of his office, he was sentenced by the Court to
a year's imprisonment and the payment of a fine of two hundred
ounds. In delivering this sentence the Court, through the lips of
. Justice Coleridge, observed that—
“It was the boast of this country that the greater part of the administration of
justice was carried on by the unpaid gentry, as a part of the duty which belonged
to them in respect of their property; and he (MR. Justice ColeHipGE) fully con-
curred in what had been said by the Solicitor-GENERAL, that that duty was in
general discharged with strict impartiality to high and low. On the one side there
was power, and wealth, and learning, and on the other poverty, and ignorance, and
distress; and considering those relative positions, when once a case of extortion
was brought befºre the Court, it was impossible to regard it otherwise than as a
crime of great magnitude, and to be º with very severe punishment. In such
a case it was the duty of the Court to deal out its sentences with equal severity, as it
would do in the case of the lowest person in the country. Indeed, when the Court
considered the advantage which was given to the educated over the uneducated, the
gº. of the former ought to be visited with greater severity than that of the
ºr.
There was another little matter too that came out in the evidence,
which the Court might have commented on with equal indignation:
d of his judgment, and when in the cravings of his nature he forgets the
namely, that the Magistrate might not improbably have pocketed his two
sovereigns, and escaped his punishment, had he not been so indi
as to attempt to tamper with the honour of policemen. MR. BALLENY, it
appears, when receiving from the poachers the £2 for his rabbit (that
eing of course the market-price of the commodity in Durham) pre-
sented the two officers, who captured the delinquents, with the insuf.
ficient hushmoney of five shillings a-piece. Had there been but one of
them, the bribe might have succeeded ; as it was, their honesty
*..." the wiser policy, and their dual better nature prompted them
to peach.
Another feature in the case which also should be noted was the fact,
that the two sovereigns which MR. BALLENY extorted were actually sub-
scribed by the friends of the two culprits, whom he, the greater culprit
sat in legal jº over and threatened to lockup. The men pleaded
º and requested time to pay; but neither plea nor request would
ustice, as personified by worthy MR, BALLENY, stoop in its umbending
uprightness to listen to. Having the bandage of self-interest on its
eyes, Justice could not see extenuation or excuse. ... So, the men were
kept in custody until the hat had been sent round for them, and their
iº from the pence they had been weeks perhaps in saving,
had raised the pounds for payment of the Great Unpaid.
It was remarked by the §. in its reviewal of the evidence, that—
“One of the men had said, and there was nothing to show that it was not true,
that his whole offence consisted in his desire to shoot a valueless rabbit, which he
wished to give as food to his sick wife.”
Rabbits valued by their owner at two sovereigns a-piece cannot well,
we fancy, be looked upon as “valueless;” but the Court clearly held that
there was some extenuation in the fact of a }. man seeking food for
his sick wife, albeit in the Game preserves of his rich neighbours. Ne-
cessity, no doubt, is a rather loose logician; and the reasons for
abstaining to procure his wife a dinner, will not be closely argued by a
man who is in search of one. However much he be disposed to reve-
rence the Game Laws, there are times when his hunger gets the better
existence of an Act of Parliament. Even the best educated would
find it hard to reason closely on an empty stomach; and where distress
is backed by ignorance and sluggish mental faculties, the causes for
abstaining from infringement of the law are still less likely, we opine,
to prove sufficiently deterrent.
ut however much we may approve the sternness of the sentenge
which was passed on MR. BALLENY, we cannot help regarding him in
some sort as a martyr. It is an especially, marked attribute of the
Game, Law that it touches nothing which it does not, dishonour.
MR, BALLENy's injustice was no doubt mainly the result of the injustice
of the law which he was called on to administer, and, in pocketing
himself, the fines which he imposed, he merely put in practice and
reduced to personal application the principle-or want of it—on which
the law is founded. The Game Law is entirely a one-sided institution.
Of all protective ordinances it is the most selfish. Being instituted
solely for the game-preservers' benefit, the spirit of the act is to a
surety carried out by their having the dispensing of it. Self-preser-
vation is the first and strongest law of the preserver's nature; in
dealing with a poacher over whom he sits in judgment, the only thing
he thinks of is his own protection. From viewing the law º as 3.
personal convenience, by no great stretch of mental eyesight he gets to
view the fines he has the power to impose, in the light of being personal
indemnities for loss, and conceives, like MR. BALLENY, that he is
authorised to pocket them.
But we must repeat, that we regard this sufferer in some sort as
deserving of our sympathy. There must be made allowance for the
strength of the temptation to which he was exposed, and for the
demoralising influence of the law he was administering. The Judge
who sentenced him commented sternly on the fact that he had satin |
judgment as an interested person. “The policemen did wrong” said
MR. JUSTICE ColeRIDGE—
“In bringing before a Magistrate two persons charged with an offence on his own
property; and the obvious course for the Magistrate was to have dismissed the
officers with a rebuke, and have ordered them to take the poachers before some
other and disinterested person.”
Yes, obviously this would have been the juster course: but in dealing
with a poacher, . where is a disinterested Justice to be found? As
well expect a cabman to give you an unbiassed estimate of distance, as
expecta country Magistrate to administer unbiassed justice in a game
case. No matter whether the offence be committed on their own or
another person's
poachers, and are leagued in common cause to compass their extermi-
nation. Wherever a bird falls or a rabbit is “picked up,” the le
preserver considers himself injured by the illegal destroyer, and having
| -
the law in his own hands, will not hold them from dispensing it. So
long as England “boasts” of its unpaid gentry Justices, so i. g will
biassed sentences continue to be passed, and the temptation to wº
doing such as MR.BALLENy's exist. As the law is now adminis
full preseryes inevitably make full prisons. Peasants become gaol-birds
through the keeping up of pheasants; and what is sport to country
gentlemen is moral death to numbers of their poorer neighbours. The

They seem to rub their noses almost against the canvas. The same

It is not always that the borrowing a French hint leads to so satis-
factory a result, but the improved tone and sportive liveliness now
characteristic of the Saturday Review completely justify the bold expe.
riment of its conductors. Any assistance Mr. Punch can render to his
generous and enterprising contemporary shall be heartily at his service.
LADIES’ SCORES AT LINENDRAPERS’ SHOPS.
IN RE a fast young lady, who figured the other day in the Insolvent
Court, the following dialogue took place between MR. ComMissionER
PHILLIPs and MR. Buck, a silk mercer, one of the opposing creditors.
MR. Buck having stated that the insolvent had paid him nothing since
he gave her credit:—
“Mr. CoMyrissionER PHILLIPs thought Mr. Buck should have stopped his hand
when the first quarter was not paid.
“MR. Buck said that if he adopted such a system with ladies who appeared
respectable, he could not, nor could other tradesmen, go on.
“MR. CoMMissioner PHILLips did not know about going on, but he apprehended
it would be the best course to adopt.”
The law really ought to come to the assistance of MR. Buck, and
other tradesmen of his unfortunateſ class, and enable them to “go on”
without letting themselves in for bad debts incurred by extravagant
ladies. We think there is a law which renders a pot house keeper
unable to recover from a sot the yalue of liquor consumed in tippling.
Let a similar statute be enacted with reference to the parties who
minister to the intoxication of female vanity. It would then be
necessary that all payments for finery should be made in ready money:
thus, linendrapers would be secured from bad debts, ladies prevented
from getting into trouble, and husbands would not find every now and
then that they had bills to discharge which they never dreamt of; so
that all parties would “go on” much better than they do now ; when
the linendraper goes on to bankruptcy, and the customer, or the
customer's husband, to Portugal Street or the workhouse. .

in America, that an Abolitionist Missionary has pirated the title, and

[AdvertisBMENT.]
THREE WEEKS OF INDESCRIBABLE AGONY, heartbreaking,
distress, feelings of sinking, alarm, and terror, oppression and tightness of the
chest, shaking and convulsions, horrible nightmare, frightful visions, gloomy fore-
bodings, increasing incapacity for any kind of business, and a threatening break-up
of the whole system.—MARIA Jolly MoTHERBANK, Threadneedle Street, London,
has been completely cured of the above symptoms by the delicious PAPYRus
ANGLICANA Food, administered by PALMERston AND Co. This invaluable article
of diet acts so beneficially on the constitution as to arrest the most dangerous dis-
order, to restore its pristine soundness, and renew a healthy circulation, recourse
being required to No. BILLs, or ANY OTHER MEDICINE. The Use of Gold in a great
measure superseded by this remedy, which acts as a universal solvent. Prepared
and issued at the Bank of England, by authority of PALMEkston AND Co., Downing
Street, and to be obtained at all respectable Establishments in Town and Country.
CLERICAL FIDDLERS.
OUR attention has been called to the following advertisement in the
Guardian of the 11th ultimo, by a friend of ours, who is himself a
Curate out of place, a violinist and violoncellist.
WANTEP A CURATE, near Town, unmarried, of good address, who
takes an interest in schools, and can accompany with the violin or violoncello
the pianoforte. Stipend, £100. Duty not heavy. Address, REv. M. A., &c.
The following reply was posted on the 22nd ultimo:—
“REVEREND SIR,
“PERMIT me to reply to your advertisement, and to enume-
rate my qualifications seriatin, according to its requirements.
* “I am “unmarried; ” but allow me to add—what I judge from the
tenor of your annonce will be no disqualification—I am by no means
indisposed to change my condition.
“‘Of good address.’... My native modesty forbids me to dwell, on
this requirement; but the silver teapot now before me, presented by
the fair district visitors of my last cure, inspires me with the hope
that I am not altogether devoid of those softer adjuncts of humanity
which appertain to the youthful adherents of our school; since I
venture to presume you are, like myself, strictly Tractarian.
*Takes an interest in schools.” Where the schools are visited by
ladies, which I cannot doubt is the case in the present instance, I beg
to say my interest in those establishments is intense.
“‘And can accompany,’ &c. As a pupil of VENTRE-CHAT fils,
I need perhaps scarcely say the quivering string obeys my plectrum
I am a devotee at the shrine of CREMöNA; and beg to add that I
should consider no amount of ‘duty” of this description as ‘heavy.”
“Thus, Reverend Sir, I think I may be permitted to say I can fulfil
all the requirements detailed by you as necessary to entitle me to a
place in your pulpit and parish, and am, &c.,
“REVEREND FIDICEN.”
“P.S. Please send photograph of the fair accompanyist.”

I’HOTOGRAPHIC TRUTH.
SKETCHED FROM A CASE OF SPECIMIENS.
TO MY MURRAY.
AUTUMN, 1857.
THE wind and tide have brought us fast,
The Custom House is well nigh past,
Alas! that this should be the last;
My Murray.
The spirits in my flask grew low,
Mine sinking too, I rushed below
And in despair cried, "Steward, ho!”
My Murray.
But once on shore, my troubles end,
Sights, sounds, no longer me offend,
I clap thee on the back, my friend!
My Murray.
My classics, once a shining store,
For thee put by this monºfi or more,
Now rust disused and shine no more,
My Murray.
So well thou’st played the hand-book’s part,
For inns a hint, for routes a chart,
That every line I’ve got by heart,
My Murray.
And though thou gladly wouldst fulfil
The same kind office for me still,
My purse now seconds not my will,
My Murray.
Thy shabby sides once crimson bright
Are quite as lovely in my sight,
As mountains bathed in roseate light,
My Murray.
For should I view, them without thee,
What sights worth seeing could I see,
The Rhine would run in vain for me,
My Murray.
Companion of my glad ascent,
Mont Blanc I did with thy consent,
And saw wide-spread the Continent,
My Murray.
Once I could scarce walk up the Strand,
What Jungfrau now could us withstand,
When we are walking hand in hand,
My Murray.
But ah! too well some folk I know,
Who friends on dusty shelves do throw,
With us it never shall be so.
My Murray.
A LADY AND A JUDGE,
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I am a Wife, and not in the least likely to be divorced,
having a separate settled income of my own, which I allow my
husband (who is a tolerably good boy as times go) to spend for me.
Therefore I am not personally interested in the subject on which I
address you.
“But, my dear soul, what on earth do they mean by appointing
MR. JUSTICE CREsswºll, to be the head of the new Divorce Court?
I think that in all my life I never heard anything so preposterously
ridiculous.
“Do you know, but of course you do, that MR. JustigE CREsswell
has had the bad taste to remain single all his life. That he is, in
fact, a bachelor. And this is the gentleman whom you lords of
creation purpose to º as the judge of matrimonial differences.
I would not at first believe that such a proposition could be seriously
made, but my husband took me into the Vice-Chancellor's Court the
other day, and there I saw MR. CREssWELL as calmly as possible
hearing a question in marriage law, to break himself in, I suppose, for his
new duties. Oh, it’s all settled of course, and a protest comes too late.
“Now, in the name of i. what can a bachelor'know about
matrimonial quarrels. Perhaps, being a bachelor, he dislikes women,
or has remained unmarried because married men who ought to have
known better or have had more pride, have described their condition as
uncomfortable. Pretty kind of justice, we are likely to get from such
a Judge as that. I should not be at all surprised if he gave a brute
of a man a divorce from his wife for the most trumpery causes... Sup-
pose she should not air his newspaper, or should mislay his slippers
(though the ungrateful fellow never remembers that she worked out
her poor eyes making them), or should give him weaker coffee than
my lord likes, or should have a headache and not come down to pour
out his breakfast (though some, brutes like their, rubbishy newspaper
and sulky breakfast alone), or should forget to tell him of a bill to be
aid until the man's in the hall, or should go out and forget to leave the
eys and the pig can't get at his whiskey-bottle, or should ask him for
a new dress when he has been losing his money at Doncaster, or should
like to have her relations in the house (and what is more natural?),
or should in fact commit any of the little offences about which you all
make such a fuss.
“Well, a married judge would know that they are the common lot of
married people, that accidents will happen, that we must take the
sours with the sweets, and that a woman who has condescended to marry
a man and look after his interests, is not to be nagged and irritated
and found fault with for every slight offence against his majesty. But
a bachelor, especially if he has been talked at by married men (who
will scoff at matrimony like anything, and yet would as soon part with
their heads as their wives), I say what does he know about
forbearing and putting up with things? Perhaps...he has lived
in chambers, with a º valet and a terrified laundress,
and has been accustomed to find every pin that he has laid down left
in the same #. He expects that a wife is to let things alone, and
be afraid to disarrange his tables and books, I dare say indeed, and I
should like to know how they are to be kept from the dust, and besides,
who has a better right.—[Our fair Correspondent here departs so utterly
from her argument, and wanders into such a general survey of relative
º ſº we have reluctantly cut away four pages of very instructive
Žazzer.
. “Then, my dear creature, having'shown you that a bachelor judge
is unfit for such business, there is another thing. MR. CREsswell is
specially unfit to decide on our cases, from his own particular habits.
DAVID ſº husband) asks a good many lawyers to our house—at least
they call themselves so, though I never see their names in the papers—
and they tell us a good deal about the judges, and what goes on. They
all speak yery highly of MR. CRESSWELL, and say that he and another
judge (is his name EARL?) are the only two who treat what they call
juniors with kindness and courtesy. That may be all very É.i. But it
seems that MR. CRESSWELL likes making short work, and hates long talk
and palaver, and so do I, and gracious knows that Inever use more words
than, are necessary to make a person understand a thing, but some
people are stupid and then you must say a thing over and over again
or it is not impressed upon their minds; and the proof that it is so is
their giving way, which husbands won't see, but, while they hold out,
they accuse their wives of *# on talking in a circle; but as I was
saying, he cuts things short. The other day (it has never been pub-
lished, but it’s quite correct) there was a slanderous case, a man had
been assailing a woman's character, unjustly, and it had been argued
all day, and at last it came to him to–what do they call it—do his
Sum up. . All the counsel were prepared with their note-taking, and
the reporters all attentive, and everybody silent, and what then P. The
Judge waited to see that all the court was watching, then looked at
the jury, and said:—
“Defendant's a foul-mouthed fellow—what damages?"
“Now, Mr. Punch, I say that a Judge who ties up a whole case as

I may say in such a parcel as that, is unfit to sit in, judgment on a woman. He would have
no sympathy for her eloquence, and would very likely call it nagging, and give the brute who

THE FORTIFICATIONS OF CHELSEA.
THANKs to the Univers. That enlightened, well-informed, and unprejudiced print has
unmasked a nefarious design of LoRD PALMERStoN upon which Mr. Punchin his turn hastens
to call down the indignation of the country. Early last week the Univers announced—
“England is arming everywhere. SHE Is ABout To speND HALF A MILLION IN THE ForTIFICATION of
CHEL8EA.”
It is too true. The moment we read it we despatched a note by an express boy to LoRD
ALMERSTON, demanding an explanation. The miserable boy, wishing to ride home, got into
a General Omnibus, and arrived late at night, and nearly starved. But we had not waited
during that incredible period. We had dashed down to Chelsea to examine whether lines
were being traced, guns mounted, or ditches cut. And we had scarcely got to Cadogan Pier
when the whole terrible scheme of fortifications became visible. A fearful job is in contem-
plation. As calmly as we can, we will tell the nation (still mindful of the Martello Towers)
what profligate expenditure of its money is about to be made.
The river Thames is to be diverted from its course at Battersea Park Bridge, and is to be
carried round the new park, and out at the Old Swan pier. A strong fort is to be raised
on the ground that will thus be vacated, and is to be armed with the long Egyptian gun
and the great, mortar at present in St. JAMEs's Park. Cremorne Gardens are to be cut up
for barracks, MR. SIMPsoN receiving a pension of £1000 for three lives, namely his own, the
hermit's, and the head-waiter's, and his rifles and targets are taken at a valuation. The fort
is to be manned by the Chelsea Collegians. The Grand Junction Water-works have signed a
contract to lay the whole district from Sloane Street to the World's End under water at five-
and-twenty minutes' notice. All the barges in front of Cheyne Walk have been bought, and
are being fitted up as gun-boats, and swivel-guns command the passage and public houses
as you go towards Queen's Road., The upper part of the goody-goody shop near this point is
to be rebuilt as a residence for the Governor, but until any invasion occurs the juvenile
population will be permitted to purchase bullseyes and Albert-toffy as at present. The church
tower is being made an observatory, whence to watch an invading enemy, but the Latin
inscription on the monument outside is to be kept up, because nobody ever yet got through
it e regret to add, that one whom we believed a patriot, the Wiscount of LAMBETH, is
moving heaven and earth and LORD PANMURE to get himself made Governor of the Fort.
Such is the atrocity which the faithfuls Univers has unveiled, and though LoRD PALMER-
STON's gold, lavished upon one of the Editors, bribed him to endeavour a few days later to
suppress the information, by sº that when the Univers said CHELSEA, it meant Ports EA,
the contemptible stratagem has had, no avail. Paris believing, and justly, that Chelsea is to
be made a Vincennes, and Punch calls upon Parliament to prevent so abominable a scheme.
BULL-DOGS AND RETRIEWERS.
THE fame of England is redeemed
By Indian triumphs won, , .
The vapours are dispersed, which seemed
Awhile to cloud her sun. -
The laurels, that were somewhat nipped
Amid Crimean frost, -
Of a few leaves if they were stripped,
Bear loads for handfuls lost.
And yet on Russian ground was shown
What British warriors can,
By hosts in Alma's fight o'erthrown,
Repulsed at Inkermann,
Right well our soldiers did behave,
And, let the truth be said,
Their chiefs approved themselves as brave
As those they should have led.
With valour burning in their veins,
And flaming in each breast, .
Lndauntedly they risked the brains
Of which they were possessed;
And if those brains had been knocked out
By bullet, shell, or ball
Save to the owner, it is thought
The loss would have been small.
Yet let us not forget what foe
They had to cope with then;
The rascal, NANA SAHIB’s no
Such man as ToDTLEBEN.
Perchance they were not over-wise;
Yet this there is to say,
That second fiddle to Allies
Our leaders had to play.
All whereon Candour can insist
Although we may admit
Still, that which noble lords have missed,
Have common generals hit;
Reward must correspond to deed,
At any rate this once.
The scholar, by a higher meed,
Distinguish from the dunce.
HOOKIE MAC WALKER'S
CONSCIENCE.
Of all cases of “Conscience Money” ever
recorded in the Times within our memory, the
following is the most wonderful:—
“The CHANGELLOR of THE ExchEQUER acknowledges
the remaining halves of Bank-notes amounting to £30, on
account of unpaid Income Tax from “Highlander.’”
Fancy Rob Roy, if that worthy were still in
existence, sending the Government a lot of mone
on account of unpaid Income-tax due upon j
mail! It is not, perhaps, quite impossible to
conceive ROB to have been capable of such a
freak of romantic and inconsistent conscientious-
ness, but that DoNALD of the present day could
dream of paying any tax of any kind unneces-
sarily, is altogether incredible. Nobody in the
world would be less likely to do such a thing
than a Highlander, except a Lowlander.
Besides, there are hardly any Highlanders now,
except deer; the dukes having driven almost all
the men out of the glens. HER MAJESTY's
once celebrated stag, “Highlander,” if he has
not been eaten by men or dogs, may have retired
on a pension—but Income-tax would have been
stopped out of that, as it is stopped out of the
scanty dividends of poor ſº ladies, who are
put to the greatest trouble if they attempt to
get the undue deduction refunded. The an-
nouncement—with all respect for its Right Hon.
Author—we conceive to be a facetious fiction,
intended to joke Income-tax defaulters into
paying up their arrears, by representing that act
of reparation as having been performed even by
a Scotchman.

INFIRMARY FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE HEART.
WE have received the Annual Report of this excellent institution.
of packing; and the proverbial virtue of patients is again strikingly
exemplified. The epidemic which broke out last autumn in an esta-
blishment for young ladies at Merton is attributed to a French Count
who had apartments opposite. It spread with great virulence; but,
the noxious agent having been arrested (for debt), the malady was
arrested also. Up to Michaelmas Day there were admitted into the
infirmary–
Broken hearts - 4SS
Of these, 305 (or five-eighths) were simple fractures, and 61 (or one-
eighth) were compound ditto. The rest were cases of mere temporary
derangement, and readily yielded to the appropriate remedies of pungent
badinage, or mild rebuke.
We subjoin a few extracts:—
GEORGIANA St. G., age nineteen., Cautiousness-small. This was
a casualty case, commonly called “love at first sight.” The patient
was riding on horseback in Hyde Park with her papa, CoLoREL ST.
G., when she was struck by the appearance of a remarkably fair and
handsome man, with an auburn moustache. The shock, as may be
º was very severe. For some days she had repeated attacks
of despondency, attended with irregular respiration and, considerable
mental disturbance. In this state she was brought to the infirmary,
and placed under the care of DR. Quiz. As it threatened to be an
obstinate case, DR. Quiz at once determined to perform an operation.
Having by secret inquiry discovered that the auburn moustache was
the symbolic adornment and advertising medium of a fashionable
perruquier in -- arcade, DR. Quiz assumed a white apron and pair
of scissors, and approaching his patient with great deference, politely
solicited her hand and—a lock of her hair. For some minutes the
patient struggled against her sense of the ridiculous. These convul.
sions were succeeded by agentlefit—of laughter, and, having expressed
her admiration of the doctor's skilful mode of treatment, the patient
was discharged—cured.
LYDIA S., age seventeen. Confidence—wonderful. The affection
under which this patient suffered was clearly attributable to a perni-
cious drug administered by an unscrupulous practitioner, the HoN.
MELTON Mowbray, whose flattery given at a race-ball, in allopathic
doses, produced its usual debilitating effects. In this state she was
brought to the infirmary, and placed under the care of DR. DAMPER.
Several other patients having manifested similar symptoms,
DR. DAMPER discovered that they also had received prescriptions in
the form of billets-doux from the º Mowbray, the contents of
which, upon analysis, DR. DAMPER found to be highly deleterious.
The exhibition of these dangerous compounds by DR. DAMPER
Though numerous cases have been brought in, there are no complaints|f
produced in his patient great nervous excitement. The heart, however,
was not seriously implicated, and, having shed one or two small tears,
the patient felt herself much relieved, and was given over to her friends
with directions in case of a relapse to administer another reading of
the Mowbray notes.
ELIZABETH. B., age twenty-nine. Dominant feeling—love of the
beautiful. This patient being at Paris with her uncle was,induced to
visit FRANCONI's Equestrian Establishment, where she became
enamoured of an artise, who danced on the tight-rope while playing
the violin with inimitable grace. The combined attractions operated
magnetically. ELIZABETH looked upon the circus as an elysium.
it she found, what she had long sighed for—a sympathetic cord, and
while her heart-strings (to use her own language) were twined around
the pºle, her reason (to use her uncle's) staggered, unable to maintain
its balance. In this state on her return to England she was brought
to the infirmary, and placed under the care of DR. Sooth E HALL, by
whom anodynes were administered in copious doses. The inflam-
matory symptoms still continuing, DR. Sooth E HALL, with ELIZA-
BETH's consent, wrote to the artiste proposing marriage. The answer
was as follows:–
“Moxsie UR,-Sila jeune femme a du talent, et qu’elle veuille con-
sentira apprendre à marcher sur des échasses, je l’épouserai, bienque
vous dissiez qu’elle n'a point de fortune; mais mom salaire étant assez
faible, j'aibesoin d'une épouse qui puisse faire quelque chose dans ma
partie pour contribuer a son entrelien et à celuiade sa famille.
Agréez, monsieur, l'assurance de ma considération distinguée.—
Apollo Wola NTE.”
(Translation.)
“SIR,-If the young woman has talent, and would consent to learn
to walk on stilts, I am willing to accept her hand, although you say
she has no fortune; but, as my salary is small, I require a wife who:
can do something in my line towards the support of herself and family.
Accept, sir, the assurances of my distinguished consideration.—
Apollo Wola NTE.”
This fine tonic, though it created a feeling of nausea, produced its
anticipated effect. The patient was restored to consciousness, and has
had no return of her weakness. She is now married to a brewer.
ETHEL.J., age twenty-one. Beau-ideality—large. This patient—a
delicate girl, with large, languishing eyes—was suffering from a heated
and artificial atmosphere, engendered by indiscriminate reading of
oreign romances. She was brought to the infirmary in a very
melancholy state, and placed under the care of DR. DAMPER. Cold
applications were made to her understanding; but without!producin
any sensible effect. She would take no mourishment but a novel.
Suspecting that the imagination was morbidly affected by devotion to
her favourite author, C– DE E , a consultation took place
between DR., DAMPER, and his colleagues, Sooth E HALL and Quiz,
when it was thought advisable to dispel the illusion by the exhibition
of caustic. DR. DAMPER accordingly wrote to his agent at Brussels
for the required escharotic, which was promptly sent, and consisted of
the following composition:-"C-DE E- is an elderly gentleman,
irritable, and addicted to snuff. I found him in hisłchamber, wearin
a faded morning gown, and *::::: in boiling his own chocolate.
Violent hysterical weeping followed the application of the caustic; but
the crisis was past, and the patient, though still suffering slightly
from hallucinations, may now be pronounced convalescent.
ANGEL.A. W., age thirty-seven. Predilections—ministerial. This
patient, having sat for some time under a young transcendental divine,
was admitted into the infirmary with an attachment growing out of her
admiration. DR. DAMPER operated. He placed before her a certified
statement, by which it appeared that, up to the 1st of April inclusive,
the divine had been presented with Berlin slippers, 260 pairs; embroi.
dered braces, 115 pairs; bead-purses, book-markers, dedicatory verses,
&c., &c., number unknown. DR. DAMPER then put it to his patient
whether, in defiance of such fearful competition, she would longer
cherish her hopeless passion. This powerful irritant was repeated at
intervals, but without producing any reply. ANGELINA W., still
remains in the infirmary, perfect recovery at her advanced age being
considered extremely questionable. -
ALDERMAN G., age fifty-seven. Constitution-soft. Another casualty
case. This gentleman was brought in suffering severely from a wound
inflicted upon him by the eyes of a brilliant young widow. For some
months his slumbers had been brief and unrefreshing; his appetite,
naturally robust, had º broken down; real turtle was now a
mockery to him, and cold punch had lost its fascinations. The case
requiring active treatment, the patient was ordered to read Bardell
v. Pickwick (Dickens's Reports), also Re Weller, sen. (idem.).
After consulting these authorities attentively, the patient expressed
himself satisfied, and walked out of the infirmary without assistance,
That evening he dined at the Albion alone, having previously ordered
covers for three. - - - - -
The report concludes with a neatly-turned compliment to the ladies
of the visiting committee, under whose direction eighty-four threats of
º for breach of promise have been attended with encouraging
results.

PROGRESS OF CIVILISATION.
THERE is an imitation of Punch regularly published at Turin.
There is to be a Punch, also, in St. Petersburgh.
The latter, at all events, will be a novelty, though we can hardly
understand “Wit dancing a hornpipe in fetters.” Our vanity will not
allow us to believe that Punch will be any the better for being “bound
in Russia,” and for having clasps put by the Censorship to each volume :
However, the two facts above are highly promising. As the world
grows more civilised, we shall_next hear of Punch appearing, as a
second Pasquin at Rome, or at Naples, perhaps; and who knows but
we may yet see a Punch in Paris, appearing every week with large
caricatures right under the nose of iºns Nºroºn; it is the one
remaining beauty that Paris wants, to be perfect.

LoRD PALMERSTON said rather a neat thing to Mr. Punch at the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S IMAGINARY CONVERSATION S.
MR. BENJAMIN DISRAELI AND WISCOUNT PALMERSTON.
Lord P. M.R. DISRAELI A most welcome visitor. Pray sit here,
near the fire.
Mr. D. 1 thank your lordship. Oriental blood is warm enough any-
where. First, apologising for this intrusion upon a political adversary,
and a much occupied statesman—-
Lord P. Who in either capacity is always º and honoured in a
e
conference with the most remarkable of modern Chancellors of
Exchequer. -
Mr. D. ". coldly.) I postpone accepting your lordship's compli-
ment until destiny shall have permitted me really to develope the
financial ideas of which my LoRD DERBY’s tenure of office allowed
* to ventilate a sample. I have called to talk to you about
Ilſlla.
Lord P. As I have said, I am always honoured and happy to see you;
but if there were one subject more than another on ... I had rather
not be talked to, it would be that infernal Peninsula.
Mr. D. Be not afraid. I am not about to condemn or to instruct.
I
am not even about to compliment you on the neat trick by which you
demolished the Indian reformers, and by causing it to be proclaimed
that the Company was to go down, when nothing was further from
your intentions, you prevented their meetings and combinations.
Lord P. A trifle. It might have been done better, but it succeeded.
Mr. D., I am not about to submit to you my views in regard to the
º administration of India. Those you will hear in the proper
place.
Lord P. And, I am sure, with pleasure.
Mr. D. I have no such surety; but we are both too old to care
about pleasure.
Lord P. Puer Hebraeus / I was taking my M.A. degree about the
time, when you were baptised—or whatever it was that made you the
excellent Christian you are.
Mr. D. And your lordship is a judge of orthodoxy. , My mission
to-day is to º a few inquiries, to which, in all probability you will
feel it desirable to make evasive replies.
Lord P. Not improbable.
Mr. D. I am quite aware that I have no right to make them.
Lord P. I trust that you will not adopt the novel course of letting
that fact stand in your way. -
Mr. D. Distinguo, as the Jesuits say. In the House I claim a right
to be as impertinent as I please. Here, we meet as gentlemen and
men of the world: I shall scarcely be offended if you tell me nothing,
and of what you do tell me I shall make what use may suit me.
! —ehº
Lord P. De deur maua il faut choisir le moindre, and I am less
alarmed at your oratory than your epigrams. -
pº. Do you know why my LoRD CANNING gagged the Indian
ress :
Lord P. He never did any such thing.
l/r. D. Right. It was the English Press in India.
Lord P. Do you want a House of Commons answer? If so, the
Gov. ERNOR-GENERAL, Sir, in the exercise of his discretion, of which no
public servant ever had more, or employed it more judiciously, deemed
it expedient to repress, by special means adapted to the circumstances,
Oh, you don't want a House of Commons answer? Well, the
civilians hated the journalists, and eagerly pounced on an opportunity
of serving them out; so CANNING was #: into the work under
pretence that the papers did mischief.
Mr D. Just so. But why did he not interfere with the native press.
Was, it not matter of notoriety that the little beastly Indian }. ers,
besides containing all sorts of indecency, were constantly publishing
barefaced sedition?
Lord P. The missionaries brought the fact under LoRD CANNING's
notice, but you could not expect him to attend to missionaries.
Mr. D. But people about him could read. Did not the Doorbin
publish in Calcutta a proclamation, under LORD CANNING's very nose,
calling on the natives to rise.
Lord. P. And it was prosecuted.
Mr. D. After, an indignant demand that could not be resisted, and
what then : The CHIEF JUSTICE, the old new son-in-law of the philo-
sepoy, MR. GRANT, took a verdict of guilty against the conductors
and findi them—one rupee. Does your Lordship know how much a
rupee is
Lord P. Two bob.
Mr. D. I congratulate you on your general information. This was
the only native paper that LoRD CANNING touched, though the others
were carrying all over the country seditious news and encouragement
to the mutineers.
Lord P. Lor!
Mr. D. Not that he was ignorant of the state of the case, for in
June he called the native papers “poisoned weapons,” and then had the
effrontery, to say that he saw “no solid standing-ground" upon which
a line could be drawn, separating the white editors from the black
Ones.
Lord P. By Jove!
Mr. D. But now notice, while the poisoned weapons were let
alone, how savagely the English papers were treated. Do you know
why the Friend of India, always the thick and thin upholder of the
Company, was “warned?”
Lord P. Tell us.
Mr. D. Because, in the owner's absence it was confided to an editor
who had occasionally touched up the civilians. So he was touched u
for a perfectly harmless article on the “Centenary of Plassy,” an
the paper was threatened with suspension for another harmless article,
but forgiven on condition of the dismissal of the new editor.
Lord P. Sharp practice.
Mr. D. Nothing. The Bangalore Herald was actually put down for
reprinting the “Centenary of Plassy” before its editor knew of the
warning to the Friend. The Madras Athenaeum was only warned for
the same crime.
Lord P. Smart practice.
Mr. D. Well, the Akyab, Advertiser was suppressed without any
º at all being assigned, the Commissioner simply refusing the
Icense.
Lord P. Saves trouble, that sort of thing.
Mr. D. Very true. And then there was a general crusade. The
Madras Eraminer was warned for saying that the Madras Government
had recommended the removal of a Government agent at Chepauk, for
oppression. The Dacca, News was warned for a legal article on the
Tenure of Land by Europeans. All the Arracan circulars were sup-
pressed, though they have no more politics than prices current. And
the Hurkaru was suppressed for some sarcasms, but the fiercest
sarcasm came from the Government against itself; for, my Lord being
afraid that such an act would rouse the London press, the veto was
taken off the day before the mail left for England.
Lord P. I call that neat, but not gaudy, as the First Whig said
when he painted his tail sky-blue.
Mr. D. The Poonah Observer and the Calcutta Englishman were
warned for reprinting an article from the London Press. -
Lord P. In praise of yourself?
Mr. D. No. That paper may have its own reasons for estimating
highly the merits of the humble individual before you, and in some
eyes, this may weaken its influence, but its Indian articles are
admirable.
Lord P. Well, my dear MR. DISRAELI, you were going to make
some inquiries. At present you have done nothing but give me
information. -
Mr. D. I want to know how Tord CANNING's three friends in the
Cabinet mean to defend him. He has but three—you, who always
defend your subordinates; GRAN VILLE, who has his own reasons for
admiring CANNING ; and ARGYLL, who is a very nice little duke, but
knows nothing of the subject?
Lord P. Quis vituperarit *
Mr. D. I intend to do it, and in earnest. And I mean also to ask
why, when the Calcutta people volunteered to arm, by which means
the Calcutta soldiers could have been released, and sent up to save
Cawnpore and Lucknow, they were all snubbed and rejected, though
now that they have insisted on arming, LADY CANNING is sent down
to present colours, and is received in sullen silence.
ord P. Ah! don’t work that subject too much.
Mr. D. No, but I’ll work it enough. And incidentally, to show the
sweet affection felt for the natives, I shall ask why, when some Maho-
metans went into one of the Homes of Refuge set up by the Calcutta
people for the poor refugees, and when these Mahometans insulted the
women, Government neither hanged nor flogged the scoundrels, but,
so far as is known, let them go unpunished P
Lord P. I fear you are revengeful. -
Mr. D. I flatter myself that I am. Well, look out. CANNING is a
weak creature, alternately obstinate and helpless, and I know that he
was bullied into crushing the Press by HALLIDAY, the Lieutenant
WOL. XXXIII. º

-
Wººse from Vienna the Own Correspondent of the Times informs
us that—
“Anthony ERNEST, the Lord Bishop of Brünn, has just edified the faithful in
this empire by announcing that “the oil of St. WALBURGA" possesses miraculous
powers. The Right Rev. §ºrd does not inform his flock what kind of fluid the
oil in question is, but he certifies that a girlin an institution kept by the Daughters
of Christian Charity' did on a certain day kiss a bottle containing the aforesaid oil,
and was immediately cured of an inflammation of the eyes, which was so violent
that she was almost blind. The Bishop was so much struck by this, that he ordered
the Daughters of Christian Charity for ever to keep holy the 7th of November, that
being the day on which “the miracle” was performed. It is said that some heretical
writer in Germany has dared to call the Daughters of Christian Charity in Brünn
impostors, and the VERY REv. ANTHosy ERNrst a credulous old gentleman.”
Although we certainly admitthat we put no faithin the miraculous oil
of St.WAIBURGA, and that as for its ºphthalmic properties, we regard
them in effect as being all our eye, still we cannot quite agree with the
unnamed German heretic in viewing the Lord Bishop as a º
“credulous old gentleman.”. We believe, indeed, to use a somewhat
free expression, that his lordship is in fact a rather deep old file. With
our knowledge of the ways in which the Romans “do” at Rome, and
why their pictures wink at Rimini, and how their miracle-machinery
is generally worked, we are pretty well convinced, that if the Christian
Daughters of Brinn Charity have been º of imposture, the very
good and saint-like ANTHosy, has helped to do the trick. We may
depend that his certificate of their eye-healing oil was the result not of
credulity, but of preconcerted dodgery. Money º; the
Sisters were perhaps instruggles with their banker: and hi -
oil as a means to bring “the faithful” to their Christian Institution
where, of course, all comers have to pay their footing. Having worked
their miracle, the next thing they required was to advertise the fact—
and no º offering the good Bishop a percentage of their profits,
they succeeded in engaging him to make the matter public. We
regard his “announcement,” therefore as a puff, and in no way as a
symptom of delusion or credulity. It being to his interest to bring the
eye-specific into popular demand, he makes it his business to exhort
his blind believers, in the blindness of their faith, to go and try the
article. His certificate, in fact, is just a parallel to those which are
furnished by I.QRp Holio Away and other vouchers of quacknostrums;
and we should recommend, that when the oil of St. WALBURGA is

advertised in Austria, the announcement should be decorated with a
portrait of the Bishop, represented in the act of kissing a quart bottle,
i. ºliming in German the equivalent for, “Ha! haſ Cured in an
stant l”
We suppose if Bishop ANTHQNY’s certificate is ascertained to draw,
the example will be followed elsewhere on the Continent, and all the
getters-up of miracles, and dealers in infallible specifics for the faithful,
will retain a special Bishop as their advertising agent; and set down his
“announcements” among their trade expenses. . The dodge of the
Brünn Daughters in getting their oil certified by a father of the Church
will be copied to a certainty by all traders in such nostrums; and
doubtless the chief miracle-mongery establishments will offer premiums
for the best episcopal advertisement; and in the rivalry of trade,
perhaps will find it pay to keep a Bishop on their premises, to certify
to customers the genuineness of their wares. Pushing men of business
in the quack miracle and medicine line will get episcopal assistance in
penning their trade circulars; and with alſ the unctiousness of lan.
guage which a Bishop can command, will announce their latest
novelties and invite inspection of their stock. The patentees of any
Sainted Hair Oil or Holy all-my-Eye Snuff will pay a prelate to attest
that he has had his “Baldness. Removed” by thirteen bottles of the
one, and his eyesight restored by nineteen pinches of the other: and,
as usual, his certificate will end with the logical requirement, that the
patentees will, kindly forward him another large supply, of their
| infallible specifics.
With but very little stretch of our caoutchoutical imagination, we
can fancy, if the dodge of these Brünn Sisters is found to be success-
ful, that dealers in old relics will copy their address, and make use of
the same means to advertise their treasures. We can readily imagine
that the spirited proprietors of old church curiosity shops, would not
shrink from posting placards outside their establishments, headed by a
= | picture of their certifying Bishop, with an adjuration in their language
to, “Look here! This is the right Shop!!”. The fortunate possessors of |
the toe-nails of St. Vitus might give º warranty that those
articles were genuine, and any wholesale dealer in the corns of good ST.
IIMPA might similarly certify the truth of their extraction. Following
the lead of the Sisterhood of Brünn, the bottler of St. BLUBBA’s tears
might get a prelate’s voucher that his goods were unadulterated, and
sound in preservation: and a Bishop might be paid for announcing to
the faithful, that the holders had some remnants of the wardrobe of
ST, FILTHUs, and that there were still to be obtained a few remaining
hairs of the ief whisker of St. Histºre.
The keepers of church peep-shows might resort to the same means
of making known their treasures. In their charges to their flocks,
Bishops might continually make announcement of the fact, that the
exhibition of the Bleeding Statue was still open to believers; and that
crowds were still attracted daily to the interesting show of ST. Domingo's
hair-shirt. . Due notice might in this way be episcopally given of the
days on which a picture would next condescend to i. and of the small
charge which had been fixed for the admission; and in short whatever
exhibitions were opened to the faithful, recourse might be had to epis-
copal persuasion, as an inducement to church sight-seers to come and
be let in there. We confess we might ourselves be tempted to a peep-
show where a Bishop was on hire to officiate as touter, and stood on
the outside bawling through a speaking-trumpet, words which in his
º were equivalent to “Walk hup ! Honly thr-r-r-r-r-uppence
leach | | ?”
We have no wish to waste space in the conjecture of remote and
|improbable fortuities; but if ever England should become a Roman
Catholic dominion, and the oil of ST. WALBURGA be in demand i.
our doctors as a remedy for blindness (events of about equal likelih
to happen), we may expect that the Brünn Sisters will, in their Chris-
tian §, appoint some agent to supply it. Purchasers, of course,
would have to bear the cost attending exportation; but, in spite of
this enhancement of the price of the specific, a sufficently brisk sale
might no doubt be commanded, if the Sisters’ course of puffing were
judiciously pursued. Just to start with, they perhaps would content
themselves with advertising “FIFTY MILLION gº every one of
which, of course, might be personally certified by the right reverend
H. whom they paid to do so. Should CARDINAL WIsby AN, be
iving at the time, his Eminence perhaps might find it worth his while
to undertake the office, for which, indeed, his knowledge of the English
º (as proved in his late letters to the Times) most admirably
ts him.
Not being of “the faithful,” we own that we have small belief
ourselves in the oil of St. WALBURGA: and regard the miracles it
works as merely optical delusions, which only eyes that are blind with
superstition cannot see through. In fact we should not mind confess-
ing, were we privately examined, that if any day be ever set apart in
England for the use of this specific, we think it should be, not the |
Seventh of November, but the First of April.

When a friend is sinking, Hope is like the Anchor that the Deal pilots take out to

It is unkind to boast of the English Constitution in the presence of Foreigners.
Invalids never exactly like to hear a strong man bragging about his health.
The loss of a joyful illusion is always a painful thing. It is like a child looking at

HORRORS OF ENTOMOLOGY.
WHEN SHAKSPEARE tells you, by the mouth of Hamlet, that there
are, more things, in Heaven, and Earth than are dreamt of in your
philosophy, he tells you a little more than what people generally con-
sider. In Earth, he says, as well as in Heaven, there are more things
than any of which your philosophy dreams. How accurate was the
insight from which he spoke, is proved by steam, gas, railways, the
electrotype, the electric telegraph, the photograph, and other wonders
which have turned up since his day. The case of . Granville v.
h is also a case in point. DR. GRANVILLE leaves his house free
from bugs; M.R. PUGH immediately enters it, and finds it swarming
with them. Whence came the insects?... A marvel closely similar has
occurred, simultaneously. Prodigies like misfortunes, never, come
single. Among the news of the week we read that:—
“At one of the recent meetings of the Entomological Society, MR. Westwood
exhibited a new species of Flea, of a monstrous size, which had just previously been
found in a bed at Gateshead. This imperial bloodsucker is twenty times larger
than the common flea.”
The theory of the Transmigration of Souls might account for the
development of this imperial flea: but this is a heresy. But to what
degree may not this kind of development proceed, for aught we know?
To what dimensions may not a flea-bite attain? What is to prevent
the development of a flea as big as a common flea looks when magni-
fied by the oxy-hydrogen microscope P Are we secure against the
occurrence of fleas each large enough to eat up a whole man, and
requiring the prowess of a ST.GEORGE or a MöRE of More Hall to
destroy it, or the aid of a 48-pounder to crack it effectually:
FLOWERS FROM LE FOLLET.
AMONG other particulars of “Fashions for December” our papilio-
naceous contemporary informs the ladies that—
“Square low bodies for dinner-dresses are more in request than the low body of
the ball-dress.”
Square low bodies. My Gracious ! Oh! Fancy a low square body
in any dress. How very plain! And a low body in a ball-dress would
be a perfect ſº it *
The softer sex is also presented with the following information:—
“It is said that some of our élégantes intend to introduce the fashion of wearing
natural flowers in the hair this winter. We hope it will not prove mere rumour, as
no work of art can compare with that of mature. Such a coiffure must, of course, be
very recherché, but it will necessarily be very expensive.”
Oh, My!, Natural flowers in the hair in December 1–won’t they be
nice? In the summer one wouldn’t care about them—but at Christmas
they will be—oh l—so very, very pretty. Very likely they will be a
little dear, but law, what signifies?—and so much the better for the
frozen-out gardeners and people out of employ.
N.B. The above comments are all fancy. Mr. Punch merely imagines
that he hears them. It may be very true that he is a goose.
THE QUESTION BEFORE THE House.--Dry as the Monetary
Debates may be deemed, they relate to a subject of immense Interest.

Sad abbreviation
Of their short vacation!
For that began hard on September.
The QUEEN must have had a strong reason
For thus, at this present odd season,
The Houses convoking,
In haste hot and smoking,
But the matter is less than high treason.
For a breach of our mere Constitution,
In order to stop prosecution,
The breakers, confession
Have made of transgression,
And wish to receive absolution.
No doubt 'twill be readily granted;
They having no error recanted:
They will freely be shriven,
And fully forgiven,
When all the great spouters have ranted.
Necessity governed their action,
They had to remove a contraction,
Which commerce entangled,
And soon would have strangled;
They won’t have to make satisfaction.
Constraint made them break the Bank Charter,
Which nearly had brought us to barter;
It must have been broken,
When all shall have spoken,
Will be owned in almost every quarter.
But oh! what a deal of debating -
Of mouthing, and preaching, and prating,
Of frothy oration,
And vague declamation, . .
The matter in hand are awaiting!
LoRD DERBY will flow like an ocean,
On amendment as well as on motion,
DISRAELI speak columns,
And GLADston E talk volumes,
Devoid of a sensible notion.
For mights will the farce be repeated,
The §§ confusedly treated,
ith cheers and with laughter,
The orators after,
Each joke and each common-place greeted.
And many a diligent crammer,
Statistics and figures will hammer;
And some, approbation,
Will earm by quotation,
From Eton’s profound Latin Grammar.
So let us sing, “ Utsunt Dirorum,
Mars, Bacchus, Apollo; virorum”—
And “Effodiunfur.”
Those “opes" which (sunt) are
Our “irritamenta malorum.”
VERY SORRY TO HEAR IT.
IN the last theatrical news from New York we
read an announcement, evidently intended to be
complimentary, but which does not speak well
for the kind of entertainments patronised by the
Americans.
“At 444 Broadway are NAGLE's Juvenile Comedians.
Here 28 children play light pieces in a manner to put their
elders to the blush."
We are extremely sorry, and think that the
sooner the 444 is shut up and the 28 well
whipped, the better.

PANMURE's rum relatives (Dow B included), nor was the objectionable
English to be charged to the Minister's Sécretary, who drew up the
Speech, which was spoiled by the interlineations of such Members of
the Cabinet as the PREMIER would allow to see the document. For
instance, the first paragraph halts thus : —
“Circumstances have recently arisen connected with the commercial interests of
the cºuntry, which have induced me to call Parliament together before the usual
time.”
The QUEEN, when left to herself, always knows and expresses her
9wn mind, and would not have left it in doubt whether it were the
“circumstances” or the “interests” which induced her to summon
Parliament. The Secretary had written:—
“I have been induced by circumstances, &c."
But I.ORD CRAN worTH made such a fuss about beginning with what
he called a good long word, that he was allowed to make the above
mull, thereby disloyally assimilating the QUEEN’s style to his own.
However, the matter is not of much consequence.
The Speech referred to the following subjects:—
Suspension of the Bank Act.
Manufacturers’ distress.
India, and our Heroes.
Indian affairs generally.
Peace in Europe.
Evacuation of first.
Estimates.
Parliamentary Reform.
Property and Criminal Law Reform.
Wisdom of HER MAJESTY's audience.
The ceremony was made interesting by the introduction of a little
sentiment into it. The Royal young lovers, PRINCE FREDERICK and our
PRINCEss were present º the way, Mr. Punch begs to thank FREDERICK
for his handsome gift of £100 to the indian fun ) and the people along
the line of procession and elsewhere were quite enthusiastic at the
sight of the illustrious couple. In other respects, everything was
much as usual.
The debates on the Address occupied the Lords until 11, and the
Commons until 7:45. LoRD PortMAN and LoRD CAREw were the
echoes in the Upper House, and LoRD DERBY, of course, cavilled at
nearly every point in the Address, and gave it his cordial vote. The
orator was really eloquent on the deeds of our soldiers in India, and
amusingly sarcastic on the general misdoings of Ministers. He gave a
#. poke at LORD PAIMERSTON for his declaration, at the Mayor's
inner, that we were ready to fight anybody in Europe; the fact being
that, according to LORD PALMERSTON himself, there was nobody in
Europe who had the least idea of fighting us. [By the way, it was
unlucky that a police case, in which “John PALMERSTON,” charged
with firing a pistol in the middle of the night, near the Monument, urged
that it was quite an aimless demonstration, had not occurred, to help
LORD DERby to a capital hit.] - THE EARL wanted to know what
had become of China, and whether, as threatened last year, we had
broken her up as MR. QUILP, shipbreaker, broke his ships, namely, so
very small that nothing could be seen of her? He walked into the
unfortunate CANNING and the Indian Government, and was not much
more civil to the Government at home. He was for a discriminating but
tremendous vengeance on the Indian miscreants, for whom killing was
too good, and a long life of humiliations and labour in chains would be
a fitter punishment. Finally, he laughed at LQRD PALMERSTON, the
Great Reformer, who was now roaring for reform “like a sucking-
dove,” and the Earl affected to want to see the Reform Bill as soon as
possible. To him GRAN VILLE, who had not much to say, except
that the Bank Act was not to be altered, but that an Indemnity was to
be taken, and the subject referred to a Committee. This intimation
incensed LoRD GREY, who thought that an Act which had to be
suspended whenever its stringency was inconvenient was a nullity.
LoRD MERCATOR (QVERSTONE) was for letting everybody go to ruin
or not, just as might happen, º his system were adhered to.
Heaps of people might smash, but the storm would clear the air.
LORD EGLINTOUN took a less philosophical and more merciful view.
LORD. MonTEAGLE then rose, and of course we went away.
fe if recorded that fono Mºy took the oaths and his seat.
LORD PUNCH had thoughts of introducing his friend, but LoRD CAMP-
BELL, who fancies himself a kind of historian (Miss STRICKLAND
concurring), was desirous to do so, and LORD PUNCH goodnaturedly
gave way. The other godfather was LoRD BELPER (né STRUTT), who
was good enough to remain awake long enough to see LORD MACAULAY
through the oaths, for what will not friendship do?
In the Commons, MR. WYREHAM MARTIN (in clothes he looked
uncommon smartin) moved the Address, but MR.AKRoy D, of Hudders-
field, was rather an Irish kind of second, and took a shot at his
principal. . Of manufacturers’ distress, MR. AKRoyD by no means
spoke in the easy hopeful way befitting an echo, but as one who had
seem and sympathised. MR. DisrAELI then helped the House, very
agreeably, through a considerable portion of the evening, and fired o
some meat epigrams and nicknames. His success was in part attribut-
able to his having had all the preceding evening to study the Speech,
and get up impromptus against it...For he and LoRD, DERBY gave no
dinners, but while the Ministers (like the English at Hastings), passed
the eve of battle in songs and feasting, the Opposition (like the
Normans), spent it in religious exercises. Copies of the Speech were
duly and courteousl sent by Ministers, as usual, to the hostile leaders,
but there were no Tory dinner-parties to discuss the manifesto. So a
better harangue was got out of Dizzy than if he had been asked by
WALPOLE, HENLEY, and such like “to stick that, (meaning the other's
last dinner-table stupidity) into his speech.” MR. D. begged hard to
have the Reform Bill at once, but PAM laughed, and told him that he
would, P. hoped, spend his Christmas more pleasantly than in culinary
experiments upon the Ministerial goose.
Friday. LoRD SHAFTESBURY proposing a plan for preventing paro-
chial parsons from prohibiting promiscuous preaching in their parishes
[the writer is open to an engagement for composing any Christmas
play-bill] was furiously assailed by SAMUEL of the Stalwart Legs, who
actually charged him with “indecency.” LoRD GRANVILLE thought
such language rather objectionable. LoRD ELLENBorough gave
notice of an elephantine charge upon the Government in the matter of
India, and if disagreeable things can be said on the subject, Mr. Punch
has every confidence in ELLENBoRough's saying them.
MR. Monckton MILNEs demanded to know what was to be done
with those Cives Romani, the English engineers in the foul keeping of
KING BoMBA. LoRD PALMERSTON did not seem to think that they
had much to complain of now (a significant word) and said that we
could not prevent their being tried by Neapolitan law. We only º:
that he has given orders to our nearest Admiral that they shall not be
found guilty. - - - --
We incline to think that a certain Cat then looked, if she did not
leap, out of a certain Bag. - -
MR. PACKE, Conservative member for S. Leicestershire, said on the
report of the Address, that the Speech from the Throne promised no
Reform Bill. The words were—
“Your attention will be called to the laws which regulate the representation of
the people in Parliament, with a view to consider what amendments may be safely
and beneficially made therein.”
This vague intimation MR. PACKE contrasted with the language
of the Speech, when Bills, ready for production were spoken of.
“Measures will be submitted for your consideration.” He expounded
that the Ministerial statement meant anything or nothing—perhaps a
Committee to consider whether any and what reforms were wanted.
If there were a Bill, it ought to be produced at once; and if it were
not produced at once, but late, the Conservatives were not to be
blamed should they refuse to consider it, except with due leisure. . .
Here every one of Mr. Punch's masculine readers will be kind
enough to raise his forefinger, lay it to the side of his nose, wink, and
then resume his usual gentlemanly behaviour. There are exigencies
when the rules of politeness may be suspended, like those of
the Bank.
SIR CoRNEWALL LEWIs, Chancellor of the Exchequer, then spoke
for about two hours. In two minutes, anybody, with Mr. Punch's aid
shall be master of the harangue. PEEL's Act Öf 1844 was not intended
as a panacea, but only to stop paper and panics. This last, crisis had
nothing to do with the Bank of England, but was the result of Ameri-
can Derangement, which had operated to make necessary a Suspension
of the Act, and a meeting of Parliament to indemnify the suspenders.
The smashed banks ha ſº not on account of their notes, but of
other liabilities, out of their legitimate line. LoRD PALMERSTON
having given leave, the Bank clerks were set to carry Two Millions
out of the cellar into the parlour of the Bank, and the money
was put into the big wine-cooler, to be ready, but the public had
called for nothing like the amount. SIR. C., asked for an Indemnity,
and a Select Committee to inquire into the whole question.
GLADston E saw no sense in an inquiry which would come to

nothing, and he would prefer legislation. He said that the currency question, had driven
more people mad than love, [Want of currency has, Mr. Punch, believes, especially as a man
must be mad who makes love without it]. MR. SpooxER, attributed the crisis to the Bank
Act itself, and not at all to Popery. MR.GLYN did not, and being a banker, thought the Bank
itself should have the relaxing power. MR. HENLEY, charged the Act with having created
a false system, founded on re-discounts, and inflated credit. LoRD John Russell was so
pleased with everything and everybody [being all cock-a-whoop at having the Jews handed
over to him this year] that MR. DisrAELI had to rebuke him for “vague declamation,” which
greatly shocked BENJAMIN. He came out with one of his Bangs. This crisis arose, not from
the mismanagement of the currency of England, but that of, the capital of Europe. As
Europe contains several capitals, it would have been better had he been more precise. But
he soon stooped, and objected to the Ministers retaining so mighty a pºwer as that of
suspending the Act, because they might use it to oblige a rich supporter. This, brought up
SIR. G. Lewis again, and he explained that his Government had never promised support to
some firm he mentioned—(QverALLs AND Journey or some such name—we never heard
of them) whatever brag their manager might have uttered. He then said, that to pass this
Indemnity Bill was the chief object of the early Session, and MR. DISRAELI courteously
promised all the opposition in his power. So began the Little Session of 1857.
“Please, Sir, it's Mr. Stork, as 'as called with 'is Little Bill /*
HIGH JINKS FOR THE HUMBLE CLASSES.
It will be cheering to our humbler readers, who peruse us at the parochial institution, or
º: unpretending public-house, to read the following quotation from the organ of the superior
classes :-
“But one or two annual festivals are not enough for the hard-worked peasantry. Every Christmas and
*...º.º. Easter and Whitsuntide, cvery Mid-summer and Michaelmas—should be marked by
meetings of rich and poor together.”
This looks very much as if there was a good time coming for ploughmen and carters.
Their contemplated meetings will probably begin at Christmas. The landed mobility and
gentry of most, if not all counties, and the dignified clergy, will, on the Christmas-Day and
Twelfth-Day, now approaching, invite their poorer neighbours, the hard-worked peasantry,
to meet their richer neighbours, the farmers, millers, and maltsters, and the large grocers,
tailors, and other respectable tradesmen, and manufacturers in the adjacent towns. On that
; festival thes, several, classes will feast together, in various halls, on the usual old
English fare. Qn Twelfth-Day, divers County Balls will be given at which all ranks will be
invited to attend, at the expense of the higher. The solicitors and surgeons, among the rest
of the lower orders, will then have an º of dancing with the daughters of persons
who are infinitely exalted above them by having a great deal to live upon, and nothing to do,
and by being the children of those who have lived
in doing nothing for some generations. Curates
as well as other poor people, will be invited to
these entertainments; and if they do not dance
at the Twelfth-Night County Balls, they can look
on : and they may play at snap-dragon, and think
of spiritualizing that amusement. To carry out
these arrangements nothing more will be neces-
sary than, in the rooms where they are to be
given, to lay down cocoa-nut matting, so that
the nails in the shoes of a large proportion of the
guests may not tear up the carpets or scratch
the floors.

O FREEDOM, for which I have sighed
So long, from the trammels of care '
Intestate a miser has died,
And I am his fortunate heir.
At last, independence is mine,
From fear I enjoy a release
Of ruin by others’ design,
Misconduct, mistake, or caprice.
My eyes I can lift from the board
Before me abundantly spread,
No longer beholding the sword
Of DAMocLEs over my head.
My cheek on my pillow can lay
And around me my warm blanket draw,
Northink when the workhouse, one day,
May grudge me a litter of straw.
My dwelling to furnish I dare,
ith pictures my walls to adorn,
Nor ask myself how I shall fare,
Of all these possessions when shorn.
My home gay and cheerful appears,
With objects which gladden my sight,
No longer an irony leers -
In all things that round me look bright.
Ay, now I can travel at ease,
At home if unwilling to stay,
Am_able to go where I please,
Not being perplexed how to pay;
Have something to give or to lend,
Without a discouraging sense,
That I may from helping my friend,
My own parish put to expense.
And then I can hunt, fish, and shoot,
In peace, when for sport I’m inclined,
Or give to the higher pursuit
Of knowledge, my undisturbed mind;
Can strive to become good and wise,
And kinsfolk and neighbours to bless,
Not having, before my own eyes,
The spectre of want and distress.
That is, I could do all these things,
Misgiving remote from my breast,

If I could but safely invest.

And tenants may ſail of their rents.
Should taxes the people drive mad,
Then, what will ensure Three-per-Cents?
When boards of directors abound
With rogues, what concern can I trust :
I cannot tell rotten from sound, -
I know not the thieves from the just :
Alas! I remain insecure,

Of keeping the money I’ve got.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
-
PROCTORS,
PANTOMIME.
HE Christmas-tide is coming:
and, as the Observer would
redundantly express it,
“‘the note of preparation’
is now sounding in our the-
atres, and their echoes are
hum’ of labour, that pre:
ludes the production of
those pantomimic novelties,
with which the ‘festive
season’ is inaugurated an-
nually within the walls of
nearly every English Temple
of THESPIs.” .
Now, we think a proctor
on the stage in the part of
Clown or Pantaloon would
be as great a novelty as any
audience on Boxing-night
might reasonably expect :
and that this appearance has
been actually contemplated,
a late passage in the Daily
Aetºs induces us, to guess.
Under the fit heading of “A
Scene in Court,” the Pre-
rogative reporter thus de-
scribes the rehearsal:—
“MR. CHARLEs DyNELEy, the Senior Deputy-Registrar, had been admonished to
be more guarded in his behaviour to MR. CRosse in special. and to the profession
generally. Last Court day MR. DYNELEY delivered in a Memorial to the Judge, in
which he made a formidable series of counter-complaints against various members
of the proctorial body. No copy had, however, been delivered to MR. CRosse, who
was now assigned to answer the charge.
“SIR. J. Dodson, who presided, said that whatever complaint MR. DYNELEY had
to make must be made regularly, and he (SIR. J.) would do the best he could to do
justice between the parties. Mr. DYNELEY's conduct was really most unseemly.
“Mr. DYNELEY. Unseemly Surely I have a right to protect my character, after
my 33 years of service 2 -
“SIR. J. Dodson. Undoubtedly. But other persons have also a right to protect
their characters.”
It would seem that, MR. DYNELEY’s notion of Protection is not
dissimilar to that which not long since was entertained by our worthy
agriculturists. Ruat colum—so long as Number One is safe. Number
One is the only unit in the million to whom it is essential that protection
be extended. 999,999 other folks may lose their characters, but
MR. DYNELEY’s must, of course, at any cost be guarded. ..
What follows is however still more farcical and footlightish:-
“The learned Judge ordered MR. DYNELEY to furnish copies of his charges to all
the parties .#
MR. DYNELEY. Then I shall have to make nine statements, and how I am to
conduct the business of my office in addition, I really do not know. Mr. ORME has
been laughing at me all the morning, and I beg therefore to read a passage from my
memorial respecting him. -
“SIR. J. Dodson refused to hear: nevertheless MR. DyNFLEY persisted in reading
the passage. In it he charged MR. ORME with having used the following words to
him, in the presence of two clerks; “I am about to retire from my profession, and
my greatest satisfaction in doing so is, that I shall never have any further commu-
nication with you, you poor man, you unhappy wretch ' ' (Laughter.) MR. DyNELEY
added—Don't think that I am at all a poor man; for I have my choice ºf receiving
£1100 a-year for doing nothing, or of receiving £2000 a-year for the discharge of
my office in the New Court. I consider that the whole of this affair is to deprive
me of a position to which I have fairly earned a right... I feel myself peculiarly
aggrieved by the proceedings of this day, and if I don't think proper to deliver the
copies ordered by the Court, I shall take my own course.
“The painful discussion was then brought to a close."
The position to which this Senior Deputy, Registrar, has, in our
opinion, “fairly earned a right,” and of which we should regret
assisting to deprive him, is a place upon “the boards,” we will not say
to admire the most—his pathetic humour, or his persevering bore-
ishness. Perhaps the greatest hit of his morning's performance was the
way in which he turned from lamenting his distressed and over-worked
condition, to attacking. MR. ORME for smiling at his grief. The
; suddenness of the transition from pathos to malignity is really quite
Robsonic; and the petulant refutal of the charge of being poor
reminds us much of Daddy Hardacres' denial that he’s rich. In his
excitement MR. DyNELEY overlooked the little fact, that the poverty
he had been taxed with was that of intellect, not pocket, and his
letting out that he could choose between an income of £1100 a-year for
doing literally nothing, and one of £2000 a-year for perhaps not doing
much, we can but look at as a letting of the cat out of the blue bag, in
which receptacle the animal, for proctorial reputation-sake, had best
have been kept hidden. - -
A morning performance is in general, we think, a rather tame affair
—but we regret that we missed witnessing the one we have described,
for the “scene” must really have been quite as good as any play which
awakened, by the “busy |f
as Clown, but as Comical Old Gentleman. One hardly knows which quality ||
one can now-a-nights see acted. . As it is, we must, congratulate the
body of ..". upon, the histrionic talent which, their Member has
displaye , and we think with very little practice his “position” as a
pantomimist might be lastingly secured. By devoting a half-hour or
so daily to the study, the learned gentleman would soon acquire a
knowledge of traditional stage-business, and climb to an acquaintanee
with the higher branches of the art. From the laughter-moving way
in which he badgered MR.ORME, we have very little doubt that he
would speedily succeed in bullying Pantaloon in the most risible of
ashions; and seeing how he stirred up every one about him, it is clear
he has a special aptitude for handling the hot poker.
WORDS TO THE UNWISE; OR, THE DONKEY'S
DICTIONARY.
ADyICE. Generally consists, even when the giver is sincere, in recom.
mending somebody else to imitate himself. Qne man tells another what
he would do if he were in that other's place, instead of telling him what
would be best for him, differently constituted, to do in his own. Advice
is very commonly mere dictation; the expression of a desire to control
other people's inclinations and regulate their conduct. In reviewing
our past career, we, in almost every instance, repent of having taken
the advice we took, and rejoice for not having taken that which we
rejected. Medical advice is of dubious value, and advice gratis is not
worth what it is offered for. , Little dependence can be placed on any
advice but that of a respectable solicitor.
BANTER. Is the polite and §. expression of contempt. It is the
conversation of gentlemen who despise one another. Nobody dares to
banter the QUEEN, or a judge on the bench, or anybody that he fears. The
objects of banter are usually those on whom it can, or gentlemen think
that it can, be practised with impunity. Banter tires a §. aS
reasonable conversation bores a fool. To rid yourself of the plague of
banter you must retort it, but in the retaliation of banter care should
be taken to return insult for insult in an elegant and pleasant manner.
CHAFF. “Who ate puppy-pie under Marlow, Bridge?” is an
example of chaff, as oftentimes addressed to Thames bargemen.
Chaff, between blackguards is what banter is between gentlemen. . It
is the reciprocal raillery of cads and rascals. “Where were you last
night?” and “Who stole ducks?” may be taken as popular instances
of chaff. , “How about Botley assizes P” is a piece of chaff commonly
addressed by Hampshire clowns in general to the particular clowns of
Botley, in that county. The Hampshire assizes are held at Winchester;
but tradition relates, that once upon a time, a man was hanged by the
inhabitants of Botley, because he could not drink more than a certain
quantity of beer. Ållusion to this piece of Lynch law is a method of
insulting, or chaſſing a Botley rustic, which is to this day practised with
high success—in violently enraging him. Ostlers, and the generality
of the rogues that are concerned about horses, are especially prome to
bandy chaff. The triumph of chaff lies in the excitement of wrath;
but the sting of chaff and banter, for the most part, consists rather
in insolence than in satire.
FAIR AND FOUL ILLUSIONS.
FoR once in the way, we are enabled to praise an advertising doctor,
and we seize the opportunity of doing so, with delighted avidity.
PROFEssoR WILJALBA FRIKELL, describing himself as “Physician to
their Majesties the EMPEROR and EMPREss of Russia,” announces
that “his new and original Entertainment, performed without the aid
of any Apparatus, entitled Two Hours of ILLUSIONs, will commence
at 8, and terminate at 10 o'clock.” Here we have a Physician candidly
avowing that his professional practice consists in the º of
illusions. How much more honest and respectable is such a Physician
than an M.D. who professes to cure diseases by means of homoeopathic
globules | Those illusions are merely harmless, but, the illusions, of
R. FRIKELL are not only harmless, but amusing, and hence probably
in some degree medicinal. Entertaining illusions are better cures for
low spirits than quack medicines. These pretended specifics are
illusions of the nature of the Jack-o'-lantern, and lead those who are
deceived by them through long and dreary mazes into final grief. The
atent medicine is the lantern; the advertiser of it is the Jack, or
É. that goes about with his imposture under the patronage of the
Government, whose stamp is a warrant to the British Public that the
rascal's good-for-nothing or pernicious compounds are genuine.
[Advertise MENT.]
HE GENERAL OMNIBUS COMPANY respectfully begs leave to
inform the public that it is a malicious libel, published by an enemy, which
invites morning passengers by the Company's Omnibuses from Chelsea to London,
to take their dinners with them. It may not be unwise in such, passengers to
provide lunch in their pockets, but the Company pledges itself that any of its
omnibuses leaving Chelsea before ten o'clock, shall reach Temple Bar before
dinner time.

“It is with the utmost regret that I inform you, that I have
been reduced to the necessity of suspending cash payments.

venience, as the considerable interval which has elapsed since my last
liberation of capital will have enabled your affairs to adjust themselves

my part.

that the conduct which has been pursued by the Bank of England has
entirely deprived it of my confidence, and that had sounder and more
liberal principles actuated parties in possession of capital, it might not
have been necessary for me to address you upon the present occasion.
I cannot too strongly condemn the course taken by those who
are ready to advance money when it is not urgently needed, and
having, thus created fictitious wants, decline accepting fictitious
securities.
“In the course of a few days a Schedule will be laid before you,
comprising the total amount of my liabilities, with a scheme for liqui.
dating them, which will, I trust, not only meet your approbation, but
that of a distinguished legal personage who will act as arbitrator
between us. - -

POPULATION OF THE ANIMATED KINGDOM.
WE read that “in Austria the Census has begun for animals as well as
for human beings!”. This is an improvement, we fancy, i. the English
* of merely dotting down the heads or different members of a family.
It is true, difficulties might occur, and if there is a Wombwell in the
|Austrian dominions, he will have to send in a tolerably long list. We
can imagine the case of an old maid being awfully puzzled with her
Census-paper. If one º: Fraulein, who lives near the Lust-
Garten, in Vienna, sends in all the particulars of her domestic menagerie,
it will present some such miscellaneous collection as the following:—
“5 canaries, of which 3 are hens and the other 2 draw up their own
water by means of little buckets: 1 dormouse that is always asleep; one
hedgehog in the kitchen to eat up the filthy blackbeetles; 3 guinea pigs,
that feed out of your hand; 1 Italian j." that is always shiver-
ing from the cold, though he has a beautiful pardessus on, made of
the finest pink merino, and trimmed with blue rosettes and ribbons;
1 Malay parrot, that talks five different languages, and imitates all the
cries of the town, besides giving all the words of military command
quite as loudly as RADETsKy; 1 cockatoo; 1 spaniel (real Blenheim);
1 French poodle (very clever—beats a drum, rings the bell, rolls a
wheelbarrow, and fires off a small cannon); 1 Angola cat; 1 Persian
ditto: 12 tortoiseshell ditto; 1 tame squirrel, (follows you all over the
house, like a º: 7 white mice; 28 kittens, of various ages, colours,

Cochin-chinas, bantams, and other pets of the poultry-yard.
You may be sure, there is an equal amount of brute wealth in England.
If a similar º for animals were circulated here, we have a
strong suspicion that the returns would prove that in tame squirrels,
accomplished canaries, polyglot parrots, and encylcopædical dogs, and
poodles, we were the richest country in the world. Why in cats alone,
we should lick the rest of the universe!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HORRIBLE CONSEQUENCE OF EATING Too MANY MUSHROOMS
FOR SUPPER.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, 7th December. Hereon "occurred' a good instance of the
respect entertained by Ministers for the Houses of Parliament. In
the Lords, the EARL of ELLENBoRough brought up the conduct of
LoRD CANNING towards the English in India, and that unfortunate
Lord was severely handled and weakly defended. As CANNING, and
by inference, the Government, that º him, were catching it,
LoRD GRANVILLE dexterously tossed in the telegraphic message
which arrived that evening, and the welcome news, that SIR COLIN
CAMPBELL had reached Cawnpore, let the Ministers down easy. There
was no harm in this device; but now please to notice. In the Commons
LoRD PALMeRSTON was interrogated about the same despatch, and he
not at the moment wanting any sop for Cerberus, declared that he di
not think the message had any value, or was more than an echo of what
we already knew.
LoRD MULGRAVE is made Bailiff of Hempholme, so the virtuous
Scarboroughites may choose a new member. They cannot choose a
i. urbane one than the courtier who has just left them for a better
erth.
LoRD PALMERSTON brought a message from the QUEEN recommend-
ing the Commons to confer a pension of £1000 on SIR HENRY HAVE-
Lock for saving India. This was not thought enough, as we give
WERNoN SMITH £4000 for losing India
agreed that the pension should be given for two lives, that of the indian
hero and his son. MR. WHITE, member for Plymouth, made some
very sensible observations contrasting the small honours given to
HAVELock with the large ones which had been accorded to the Cri-
mean blunderers, and LoRD PAM, who perfectly understood MR.
WHITE, pretended to think he meant to disparage the real achievements
of the Russian Campaign, and fired away much mock indignation.
But MR. WHITE
Was very right,
And Punch declares it hard, again,
That HAVELOCK wears
The badge that flares
On LUCAN and on CARDIGAN.
The Bill approving what LoRD PALMERSTON did at the Bank was
read a second time, and in the course of the week passed both Houses.
Tuesday. LoRD SHAFTEsbu Ry explained, his plan for enabling the
clergy to preach in Exeter Hall, or where they like, without, reference
to the clergyman of the parish. To speak theatrically, the Earl thinks
that if the regular company cannot “draw,” the star system should be
introduced. Touching which matter, Mr. Punch has one thing to say.
It is announced that there are to be night services in the grand old
nave of Westminster Abbey. This is well. But the Abbey must be
warmed and lighted, and Mr. Punch hereby gives notice that he
; and later in the week, it was |P
expects the Chapter personally to see the lights and fires out every
might, as he is not going to have the Abbey burned down, merely
because the Westminster parsons cannot get people into their own
churches. Note, that some of the Bishops do not approve of LoRD
SHAFTESBURY's plan; but all those whom ‘. has made (he is called the
Bishop-Maker in the House) are, of course, on his side.
This was the day of the Great Fog, and the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE
could not i. to the House in time to speak on the HAVELock grant,
but came down at last, and appended his approbation, in terms which
the Duke possibl did not mean should convey the idea they appear
to express; namely, that he undervalues the importance of the Indian
Campaign.
In the Commons, Circumlocution came out strong. Calcutta has
memorialised Government to take away the ridiculous CANNING. The
House wants to see the memorial, but WERNoN SMYJTHE will not pro-
duce it, because it was not forwarded, according to etiquette, through
that yery Governor-General, and has sent it back to India, to come
round the reg way. But surely there must be a copy, which will
quite answer the House’s purpose.
Wednesday. Nothing particular beyond a rather pedantic protest b
MR. GLADstoNE against the House's interfering to increase the rewar
to HAVELOCK. It would, he thought, lessen the value of such things,
if the Crown were dictated to. This is nonsense. If our gracious
QUEEN were an autocrat of the days of chivalry, and hung ropes of
pearl on a gallant, knight's neck while inserting rolls of banknotes
into his gauntlet, interference with a Lady's will and pleasure would
be impertinent. But as these Royal Messages are now discussed by
some elderly gentlemen in Downing Street, and written out by a clerk,
before the QUEEN hears of them, the case is altered, and there is no
impropriety whatever, when HER MAJESTY says, “I should like to tip
that good boy,” for the Parliament to answer, “Do, your MAJESTY,
and we’ll imitate your Grace.” MR. GLADSTONE has been translating
HoMER until he has translated himself back to the times of MEMNoN,
and his daughter AGGY MEMNoN.
. Thursday. LORD, MELVILLE, a grave authority on such a matter,
intimated his belief that the Government were deeply culpable in the
matter of the Indian revolt, having received long before its breaking
out, warnings which should have induced them to take precautionary
measures. LoRD GRANVILLE pretended not to know anything about
it. LoRD PUNCH was not in the House, or would have asked, whether
LORD DALHOUSIE did not, a year and a half ago, call the attention of
the Indian authorities to the absolute necessity, for increasing our
military force in something like pºrtion to our increased territories,
and whether he was not pooh-pooh'd,
In the Commons the memorial of the oppressed Belgravians against
the Organs was presented by SIR John §. and it excited the
earnest sympathy and indignation of the House. It is to be hoped
that the Nuisance will now be dealt with, either by making organ-
grinding a felony. Meantime, and until legislation takes place,
why not teach bull-terriers to fly at the leggings of the savages A
couple of docile dogs would clear a whole neighbourhood. We pre-
sent the hint to MR. Bishop, of Bond Street, and also to MR. BILL
GEORGE, of Tyburnia.
LoRD JoHN RussBLL then brought up a new subject, of much interest.
It seems that there are 40,000 Jews in England, but, owing to certain
formalities in the oath of a member of Parliament, not one of these
Hebrews is able, if elected, to take his seat in the House of Commons.
This really seems very hard, not so much upon them, as upon England
generally, who is prevented from choosing any representative she may
lease, or rather who may please her. LoRI. John proposes, in next
Session, to alter the oath, in the case of the Jew, and to enable him to
serve his country.
Friday. There were Currency debates in both Houses. Mr. Punch
would not outrage his readers’ feelings by doing more than record such
doings. The details are entirely unsuitable for publication.
In the Lords the EARL of CLARENDON “believed, but could not say
for certain,” that the French Government meant to abandon its free
negro-labour scheme, which LoRD DERBY, (the MR. STANLEY of
i. ro Emancipation days) denounced as a recurrence to the slave-
rade.
In the Commons, Mr. ToM DUN.com BE announced a plan of his own
for letting the Jews in—returning the kindness which, in his time,
some of them have probably shown him. He means to proceed by
resolution. But there are such things as Law-courts, and between them
and the House would come a collision in regard to certain penalties,
and though the two great bodies would be unhurt, the unfortunate
Hebrew who would be crushed between them would be in no degree
comfortable. - -
The Corporation of London is to be reformed, if that body is good
enough to approve the Government Bill. Another attempt is to be
made upon . Medical Profession, and a plan will be introduced for
making something like a Minister of Justice.
The officer who captured the hoary scoundrel called the KING OF
DELHI, was obliged to promise the old ruffian not to put him to death,

miscreant's life, as a spectacle and warning to his ex-subjects, might

the slaughter of Englishwomen and their children, ought to have been

The CHANCELLOR of the ExchequER's motion for referring the

was perfectly ludicrous. He seemed utterly unaware that there is a
railway from the Sea to Cairo, and that the East India cadets do the
rest of the journey to Suez, (a pleasant ride, with lots of refreshment

OUR CITY ARTICLE.
oNEY is money—the first pro-
position to be established, to
an intelligent comprehension
of the present monetary crisis.
This proposition we shall
prove, as is often done in
equally momentous instances,
by taking it for granted, or by
asserting it, which comes to
the same thing.
Well, it being demonstrated
that money is money, we come
to the second proposition,
which involves an analytical
disintegration of the forego-
ing; and accordingly we re-
solve it from our immemorial
experiences into the instru-
ment of purchase in whatever
shape, sign, or substance we
may possess it for the time
being. This power is of two
kinds, namely, material and
moral, or as the latter might be
expressed, moralplus material.
ith the material we have
nothing to do at present, so
handing it over to the bullionists, as a settled question, we shali
treat entirely of the moral, which is so exceedingly unsettled. A
Bank-note is moral money: namely, the promise to pay plus the means
of paying—moral money of a definite value. A regular attendance
at church in a prominent seat with crimson linings, and a large
gilt bible and prayer-book, is moral money, of indefinite value. A
ood stock of assurance, or—as it is philosophically expressed—
ass, is capital enough to begin the world with, and is one of the
most ordinary metallic bases on which men commence the superstructure
of the credit system. A superfine coat with a general neatness of attire
is a subsidiary power of purchase; namely, part and parcel of the sm
change of that golden integer, the man sterling. A respectable frequency
in subscription lists for benevolent institutions, jº. good for a
year's dealings with butchers, bakers, grocers, tailors, haberdashers,
shoe-makers, blacksmiths, and the whole circle of local industry. A
handle to one's name, a fine house, a handsome equipage, are all
so many powers of purchase. A solemn look will always find an old
lady to endorse it. A portly figure, grey whiskers, and a port-wine
nose, with a slight dash of Burgundy on the cheek, command universal
credit. A smooth tongue, a taste for prayer-meetings, the first gloss
of a white neckclothºonly the first, the first speck is bankruptcy—
commercial enterprise, a character for success, a smooth tongue, worth
and counterfeit-worth, are so many purchase-powers, so much
moral money plus material-so many constituent parts, so much small
change of that golden integer—the man sterling plus the £ s. d.
Sterling for which he promises to stand good. Of course this is all so
long as the convertibility of the promise to pay is not called in ques-
tion; with the stoppage of payments the whole becomes moral minus
be balanced against bad half-crowns and counterfeit coin generally.
A five-pound note is five moral sovereigns...A counterfeit five-pound
note is five immoral sovereigns—scientifically speaking, and takin
into consideration the juder ad quem and the compound interest which
they bear in the Milbank Penitentiary, the Hulks, and the Penal
Colonies, which merely form the coupons paid by the nation on the
more unequivocal investments of rascaldom traced back to the purchase
É. which originally created them. The operations of the counterfeit
ranch of this É'. are somewhat exceptional; and º they
create and uphold purchase powers of another stamp, namely, Judges’
wigs and Barristers' gowns, all the sharp practice of attorneyism, and the
whole arms, legs, and instruments of the law, from the Lord Chief
Justice’s ermine to the hangman's rope; their effect is, upon the whole,
the same coutraction of the moral purchase money of the country, as the
restrictive action of the Bank Charter Act of 1844 exercises on the
Bank-note circulation when the gold gets low.
But what are all the Bank-notes in the world against the solemn
faces, fine dresses, and addresses, regular church-goings, with crimson-
lined pews, handsome equipages, fine houses, name-handles, benevolent
subscriptions, soft voices, grey whiskers, portly presences, port-wine
noses, business energies, and all the purchase power of the man sterling,
plus the means sterling: the moral money plus the material money,
which is one vast “promise to pay” stamped on the face of the who
body social P So to speak †. if money be money, and
purchase power be money, and ing that conduces to credit, Or
assists rascality, be purchase power; then everything is money—good,
bad, or indifferent—all the constituent small change of the man sterling,
plus the £ s. d. sterling, with their respective counterfeits.
Even let a man's property be entirely personal, that is to say, let his
only hereditary estate be “that estate of sin and misery" on which,
as we are all heirs to it in common, no one can be expected to advance
money: and his personal property, that only real property in the world,
—namely, what his hat covers—he has a purchase power proportionate
to face, figure and address in the domain of moneyed spinsters and
jointured widows so long as he is personally marketable. When sold—
that is, when he becomes the property of a wife—he has simply invested
his pers capital in the estate of matrimony, with its contingents.
He has realised, as we say on 'Change,_no doubt on a due estimate of
the capitalisation of dinner-parties, pleasant trips to Richmond, white-
bait at Greenwich, petit-soupers, tºl. and other things of the kind, to
which he has been accustomed in his marketable epoch; and draws, if
need be, on the credit of the honourable estate and the moral value of
the pledges which are its natural produce.
Money, money, money, everything is money. And if everything
be money, good money, bad money, or indifferent money, real coin,
sweated coin, clipped coin, or counterfeit coin, even down to crapulous
head-aches on which the wine merchant, the physician, the apothecary,
and the drysalter all draw their respective percentages of profit: why
all this patching at our monetary system P # the only question be the
convertibility, namely, the moral plus the material—why such a legisla-
tive fuss about that fragment of the great universal promise to pay—
the Bank-note * Why make it dance and beck and bow and come and go
and rise and fall as the mere shadow of its golden constituent? Why
make a mere monetary coquette of it—
“Nolit ubi velis, ubinolis capiat ultro—"
(alas, how painfully applicable and inapplicable the two clauses) till it
cause its most ardent woers, alike the honest and dishonest, to die
off in pecuniary phthisis, monetary consumption, and all kinds of
disorders of the chest. As well #. a law regulating coats, hats,
carriages, horses, houses, name-handles, benevolent subscriptions,
solemn faces, port wine noses, Burgundy cheeks, and all the resources
of credit or of rascality, and all forms of the moral money, plus or mixas
the material as the case may be. . Prohibit people from going to church
if their bankers' balances do not justify sorespectable a line of conduct;
ordain that solemn faces shall become miserable faces the moment the
golden reserve shows a tendency to exhaustion; that fat, comfortable
men shall fast and get low in the flesh when their metallic basis does
not justify a creditable display of adipose tissue; that portly presences
ºil deport themselves no longer uprightly when the golden stay is
withdrawn; that port wine noses shall bleach themselves blue with
tears; and benevolent men contract their benevolent subscriptions to
a certain statutory limit, and walk about with hº sewed up,
to show that they have no more use for them. these purchasing
powers are so much money, so many promises to pay, so many notes
on the great Crédit Mobilier of public homesty; and all the thirty-eight
millions of bank-paper, in the three kingdoms, are but a fragment in
comparison. The º: question, therefore, is less the convertibility of
the *::: money than the convertibility of the paper men; to distin-
guish the real from the counterfeit, the honest from the dishonest, the
enterprising man from the gambler; to find a better standard than
gold for moral money, and a better basis than gold for the convertibility
of the man sterling.

all she was worth.
Accordingly
PUSEYISM AND PRIVATE FAMILLES.
WE have much pleasure in stating that the REv. J. M. NEALE, the
unfortunate clergyman, who was so grievously maltreated b º
eille
that he attempted, on that occasion, to read any supplement to the
burial service. This is not all. The REy. JoHN, Scobell, the father
of the deceased, in a published account of the affair, substantiates his
denial. But then the REv. John ScoBELL ascribes to the REv; MR.
I
NEALE conduct much more likely than the recitation of superfluous
prayers to have occasioned the Lewes riot. He states that, after the
vault in which the body was deposited had been locked, MR. NEALE,
ickly and excitedly laying his jhand on his arm, exclaimed, “MR.
§. I must see you; where can I speak to you? I will enter
the vault.”
Now, if this was really the language and conduct of MR. NEALE, he
behaved more histrionically even than we supposed. In insisting on
entering the vault, he acted the part of an ecclesiastical Romeo.
Ma Scopeii, adds:-
“ Unfortunately, as is stated by reliable witnesses, MR. NEALE condescended to
enter into altercation and retort with the people around him—to act and speak
with violence of manner and gesture, to prolong his stay in the churchyard, to call
upon the policeman to break open the door of the vault, to declare that he would
stay all night for the purpose—that he would rather die than not enter it.”
In February last, MR. ScoBELL had written a letter to MR.NEALE,
calling upon him to refute the following, among other accusations:—
* 1: That you have been carrying on by letter, under cover to the mistress of my
infants' school, a clandestine correspondence with my eldest daughter while in my
house.
“2. That you hold clandestine and secret meetings with her, of some hours'
duration, in the private apartments of my infants' school-house, situate in my
parish of All Saints, Lewes. -
“3. That you there usurp, dishonourably and unlawfully, the office of parish
priest of All Saints, Lewes; wearing a surplice; exercising Liturgical offices;
receiving confession and pronouncing absolution.”
To these statements, MR. ScoBELL says that MR. NEALE declined
to reply. Perhaps they are erroneous: and º: the BISHOP of
CHIcHESTER had no sufficient reason for withdrawing his countenance
from the Sisterhood of St. MARGARET’s, East Grinstead, because “it
has for some time past submitted itself to the mlimited influence of
MR. NEALE, a clergyman,” adds the Bishop, “in whose views and
practises it is well known I have no confidence.”
The above facts in addition to others, for which we must refer the
reader to the Surrey Gazette and the Daily News, will perhaps explain
why, by an indignant multitude, whose proceedings were entirely irre-
gular, the gown of the reverend confessor—and father confessor—
came to be stripped off his back.
|
|
MR. NEALE may be as innocent as the EARL of SHAFTESBURY or
Mr. Punch himself of the charges brought against him by MR. Sco-
BELL. From the statement of the latter gentleman, however, it is
quite clear that somebody decoyed his daughter into the Puseyite
nunnery at East Grinstead—to which we believe she has left all her
roperty, MR. NEALE and Miss GREAME the abbess of the convent,
eing, according to her father's statement, the executor and executrix
to her will. Might not that document, by the way, be disputed ? MR.
ScoBELL had i. consult Sir Fºeppricº'ſ resºr on that
oint. The immediate agents in the enticement of Miss ScoBELL
rom her family appear to have been two, hysterical young
ladies, one of whom tells her, in a letter, “I really think our
Blessed intends better things for you, dear; ” and another presented
herself to Mr. Scopeii, in a remarkable black dress, and wearing a
cross, “which by a long string of beads hung at her feet.” The
former of these idiots belonged to a nunnery at Oxford, said to be
lººded by DR. Pusey; to whom perhaps she alluded as “Our
essed.”
Enough, probably, has now been said to convince fathers of families
of the necessity of employing private watchmen to keep an eye on any
of the Puseyite gang who may be lurking about the premises, or trying
to sneak down the area. Big brothers will also do well to provide
themselves with good sticks, wherewith to expedite the exit of any
such intruders who may be found about the house. Rational young
ladies, doubtless, will have the water jug always in readiness, to empty
its contents on the head of any Tractarian Don Giovanni who may come
serenading them with a canonical Deh, vieni, under their windows.
A Delicate Ear.
WHAT a very curious conformation of ear must be possessed by MR.
GoulBURN, the worthy Commissioner of Bankruptcy. Somebod
before him, the other morning, used the word restaurant, upon which
the Commissioner observed, “I don’t like that word, it sounds like one
we heard in the last case, namely, hypothecate.” We have been repeat-
ing both words ever since, in the hope of discovering the likeness, but
have not yet succeeded. It was surely MR. GoulBURN who pronounced
Tobacco to be a legitimate rhyme to Long Acre.
No More Landlords.
HURRAH! Henceforth, quarter-day will have noterrors. A respect:
able stationer advertises “Fifty Receipts for Rent for Five Shillings.”
That’s upwards of twelve years of security from involuntary contribu-
tions to one's Landlords. Hooray! Who'll lend us Five Shillings?

enough fuss has been made about these Indian chaps. I don’t say
that when a soldier does his work well, and is obedient and subservient

Lord G. They say that he fought eight or nine battles, some of 'em

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
game are about a hundred times heavier than any that were, ever
played for in Europe. Well, allow that it’s all true, what your Roy AI,
lºgº said showed how thoroughly you really understand the art
oi War.
Lord L. Of course. The greatness of a campaign is not to be
measured by the importance of the objects, or the brilliancy of the
strokes, but by the rank and position of the combatants; and two
kings fighting for Eel-pie Island would make a greater campaign than =
two smobs fighting for France or Spain. -
Lord C. You spoke royally, Sir, and as a prince should do.
H.R.H. (aside). By Jove, I don’t much care about this. To have
pleased one of 'em so much wouldn't be any great shakes; but when
both are delighted, I must have put my foot in it. -
Lord L. Really, Sir, when one considers what was done in the
Crimea—
Jord C. The sacrifices that commanding officers made—
Lord L. Losing all one's comforts—for I had no yacht, on board
which I could command my cavalry like a gentleman—
Lord C. (in a fury). I wish you’d command your temper like a
gentleman.
Lord L. Show me the way.
Lord C. I generally show you the way in most things. .
H.R.H. My Lords! . But in the argument you are right. Great
sacrifices were made in the Crimea, and I hope the country will
remember them.
Lord L. And we sustained great losses. - - -
H.R.H. Yes. I have heard of more than one very illustrious officer
actually losing his head.
Lord L. It is almost past jesting, Sir, when we find the Army
threatened as it now is. If civilians and the House of Commons are
to take upon themselves to be judges of military men, and to apply a
olitical standard to their exploits, the service will simply go to the
euce.
Lord C. If the smobs are to take out of the hands of the Fountain
of Honour (by which I mean your Royal HighNEss's most illustrious
relative) the right to reward officers, or are to increase rewards because
it is fancied that a great object has been gained, there’s an end of
everything. -
H.R.H. Don’t let’s make it a personal thing. I dare say our Family
and the country understand one another very well. We'll leave that
out of the discussion. Am I right in supposing that what I said on
that foggy evening (and wasn't it foggy, I say?) is taken, as a sort of
patronising thing, and meaning that the officers in India had done all
very well, but were not to be over-estimated? Eh, my Lords?
Lord C. We look at it in that light with great º Sir.
Lord L. And your Roy AL HIGHNEss expressed the feeling of the
best kind of men in the service... I mean, of course, our sort; officers
whose rank and wealth have had legitimate influence in their promotion.
Lord C. I don’t much fraternise with the snobs, myself, but I’m
told, and I’m sorry to hear it, that there’s a good deal of low senti.
mental feeling in the Army about these Indian officers, and that there
would be no row if the Company’s troops were put on the same footing
i. º Queen'. Anything more offensive and atrocious I never
eard of.
Lord L. But your Royal HIGHNEss may be sure that the more
the Indian fellows are snubbed the more what I may call the Swells
will be pleased, and it is to be hoped that you will go on as you have
begun.
*# H. My Lords, I have an appointment, and you know my love of
punctuality. There has been a misunderstanding, which I, attribute
to that abominable fog, but I’ll clear it up the first opportunity. I tell
you what. I wish we’d had HAVELOCK in the Crimea. [Erit.
Lord L. Ah, and I had had to command him. Deuced little praises
he'd have got from the House of Commons, if I’d had to cut out his
work for him.
Lord C. Just so. I've no patience with snobs. Well, we've done
the civil thing by the Duke, I suppose.
Lord L. Though you're no great judge of civility, eh? Yes.
Lord C. You be—(But as his Lordship banged the door, in going out, it
is impossible to say what was his parting advice to his Brother-in-law).
A Lost Dog-Neither Here nor There.
THERE was an advertisement in the Times a few days ago for “a dog
that answers to the name of Mustard.” Not difficult to find such a dog!
Mustard is the most natural companion to meat. , Cut, a, sandwich for
him, and you will see that Mustard, if he is a well-bred dog, will come
running in as naturally as possible.
THE NEXT EXAMPLE FOR SEPOYS.
THE KING OF DELHI has not been hanged. If that is not enough
A HER0'S SISTER."
IEUTENANT SALKELD, the young
soldier who gloriously blew
open the gate of Delhi, is no
more. Mr. Punch has but
one word to say. It has
reached him that the heroic
SALKELD's sister is admi-
rably doing her duty as Gov-
erness in a London family.
Surely, Lord PALMERSTON,
surely, House of Commons,
should the lady' remain at
that honourable duty, Eng-
land having read the Delhi
despatch, it will be from
choice, not from need.
HEBREW WITHOUT POINTS.
REMARKs such as these, coming from a provincial contemporary,
should really make us hesitate to give his name, though possibly he
may not have the grace to be ashamed of it or them.
“The Jew nuisance is up once more, and LoRD JoHN RUssell is content to have
that well mumbled bone pitched to him by LoRD PALMERSTox, in compensation for
taking Refºrm out of the Bedford repertoire. We shall have the old cant and twaddle
all over again. We are to hear civil and religious liberty demanded for a set of bigots,
who notoriously have among them, in proportion to their numbers, more rascals
than any population in Christendom. hen do you hear of a piece of knavery
requiring cunning (not courage, for the Jews are a cowardly lot; §. you ever see a
Jew soldier?) and one or more of the “Hebrew persuasion,” as they are foolishly
called, is not at the bottom, to instigate, plot, and profit by it? Are not most of
the marine store-keepers, who poison and transport generations of children, Jews or
Jewesses. Is there not a wholesome instinct that makes us recoil from the race f
And in answer to these facts, we are always told that Rothschild is a good-natured
man, and MonTEFlore a generous one, and that the Jews have many schools and
no be . Fine reasons, certainly, for letting Old Clo' into the House of Commons.
We jºia: the Lords will be staunch, and if John NY RUssell, in titude for
certain services by his hook-nosed clients, chooses again to advocate so : a Cause,
their Lordships will serve the Jew Sepoys (who hate the Christians as much as their
fellow-Asiatics do, and are as delighted to plunder them) in the same unhesitating
way as before. A howl may be raised, but the people of England will be pleased.”
The singular conglomeration of charges, reasoning, hints, and sneers,
in the above remarkable paragr º: seems to entitle it to a place in our
columns as a natural curiosity. To attempt to argue with a gentleman
who has got his thoughts into such a i. ..". simply waste of
time and paper. It may not, however, beamiss to remind him, that the
Jew claim does not rest upon the various questions whether the
Jews are virtuous, or brave, or friendly to §. or whether
Christians (excluding the particular Christian above-quoted) like them;
but upon the single and simple question, of whether they are English-
men. If they are Englishmen, each Jew has an †: irth-
right, and so long as you keep him out of that, you do him a wrong.
e wish we could get the sentimental element taken out of the dis-
cussion on both sides. The matter is one of pure law, and BARON
Rothschi LD’s good-nature has, we admit, no more to do with it than
MRs. IKEY SoLoMONs’ marine-store. If BARON ROTHscHILD is not
an Englishman, that is to say a Briton, and were ten times the excellent
and worthy man he is, he has no right to a seat in a British House of
Commons; and if MRs. IKEY SoLoMons' husband is a Briton, and that
obese lady had trained into thieves the youth of ten parishes instead
of two, MR. IKEY has a right to take his seat, if elected, beside MR.
DISRAELI or MR. GLADSTONE. The Hebrewphobist whom we have
}} is probably incapable of perceiving this, but it is right that Mr.
unch should point it out; because, and herein, he agrees with his
brother journalist, there is a probability of a good deal of “cant and
twaddle * being talked upon the subject. As to comparing the Jews
to the Sepoys, having previously denounced the former as cowards, we
must leave the two imputations to be reconciled by the reader...We
do not believe, that if the handful of British Hebrews were at liberty
to do anything they pleased, they would draw anything sharper than a
bill at short date, or charge more furiously than at the rate of sixty
per cent., and those who abuse the Jew for “cunning” will please to
recollect how many centuries of ill-treatment have beaten him down to
the position in which cunning is the only weapon of defence. There
was no cunning, save a soldier's, about JUDAs MAccABAEUS, when he
did things worthy of HENRY HAVELock; but the treatment to which
the Jew has been subjected for ages tends to conyert the MAccABA:US
into the Scarabaeus. But, as aforesaid, the Hebrew should rest his
claim upon nothing but the rock of right, and in answer to all taunt,
say with the Venetian capitalist:-
to put an end to the Indian Mutiny, NANA SAHIB, as soon as Lord
| CANNING can catch him, will, of course, be pensioned.

THREATENED ABOLITION OF THE HOUSE
OF LORDS.
How did we ever come to have an hereditary peerage P. How is it
that we are blessed with an aristocracy and enjoy the advantage of a
House of Lords? These questions are suggested § a statement made
by Colon EL, NoKTH, speaking in the other House, on the pension
fº to SIR HENRY HAVELock. Colonel, NoFTH is reported to
ave said:—
“CAPTAIN HAvelock had participated in all those battles which had gained for
his father such world-wide renown; he had highly distinguished himself as an
officer, and had received for his gallant conduct the Victoria Cross. He thought,
therefore, that this was a case calling most loudly upon them to follow the general
}. which was to grant such pensions for two generations. (Hºar, hear.) He
oped the circumstances of CAPTAIN HAvelock would be considered by the Govern-
ment, and that the same pension so deservedly awarded to his distinguished father
would be made to descend to him.”
If acts like those of HAVELOCK Senior, accompanied by similar acts
on the part of HAVELock Junior, are not enough to ennoble and enrich
all future HAVELocks, how came anybody in the House of Lords,
except LORD OVERSTONE the capitalist, to be enriched and ennobled ”
It may be a very sound principle to reward deserving men in their own
persons merely; but if this principle is to be adopted by the Govern-
ment, of course they it." to let the Peerage, and the House of
Peers, die a matural death.
Suppose the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE had taken Delhi; suppose the
exploits of HAVELOCK and OUTRAM had been performed b }. EARL
of LucAN and the FARL of CARDIGAN; would not his ROYAL
HIGHNEss have instantly received a truncheon like that which has
been wielded in the mouths of so many cannons by another Roy AL
HIGHNEss? Would not two noble }. have been exalted into two
more noble Dukes, and would they not have been decorated with any
and every star, garter, ribbon, cross, medal, or other distinctive bauble
which they had not earned, or at least had not received, already?
A thousand a-year is a good income in these times, but if the
services of such a man as HAVELock are worth only one thousand
a-year, whose services, MR. BULL, do you consider to be worth five,
to say nothing of ten or twenty? What has any ex-Chancellor, except
LoRD BRough AM, done for you that can be for a moment named in
comparison with the exploits of GENERAL HAVELock? Of what use
to you is any one of your Bishops in comparison with that hero?
One of his flock. Did I say it warn’t. Do you want to hargue, you beggar?
Either you underpay him shamefully, or you excessively overpay them.
It is true that the dignity of a Peerage may necessitate the difference,
and HAyeLock's pension may suffice a commoner, but if HAVELock is
to remain a commoner, of course no more Peers will be created, and
the Upper House will be allowed to expire.
FUN AND FREEDOM OF OPINION.
THE Hampshire Independent contains an account of a comic religious
meeting, which took place the other day at the Victoria Rooms
Southampton, when the members of the Independent Congregational
Church celebrated their Fourth Anniversary. "Our Southampton con-
temporary thus concludes his report of the proceedings:–
“MR. MARTIN, in a humorous speech, proposed a vote of thanks to the ladies
who had supplied so excellent a tea, and alsº to the indefatigable individuals who
kept the tea-pots supplied with boiling-water, and the vote having been carried by
acclamation, MR. NASH made a few remarks.
“The Meeting was then closed with the doxology and the benediction.”
The doxology and benediction, which succeeded MR. MARTIN's
humorous speech about the ladies, may perhaps, have been felt to
present some contrast to the facetious address of that gentleman. A
transition so abrupt, and so #.". by the natural laws of emotion,
was likely to produce an effect the reverse of solemn, and, there is
reason to fear, occasioned too many: mouths to be suddenly stopped
with pocket-handkerchiefs. This unhappy result might have been
obviated by the introduction of a few dry words on business between
the fun relative to the ladies, and the devotion. However, we will
not be too critical in a case like this, and we notice, with pleasure, the
introduction of hilarity into the transactions of the jolly independents
of Southampton, who enjoy their fun, as well as their faith, at their
own expense, and not at that of other people.
Bankruptcy and Boobyism.
WE read in the Musical World that at Hamburgh a couple of Italian
opera-singers have made such a sensation, that in one evening the
audience called them before the curtain Thirty times.
that Hamburgh should at this moment be in commercial ruin, when its
affairs are in the hands of such Fools?

SHAMEFUL SEPOY ROBBERY OF GENERAL HAVELOCK.
- ºt-_ HE Morning Star, in its sum-
mary, tells us that GENERAL
HAVELock gained eight or
nine victories in two months
and “captured 10 guns.”
Now, this is a cool, robbery
committed upon the illustrious
General of no less than sixty
guns ! Isn’t it mean, is it not
cowardly, to attempt to rob a
man of his hard won glory?
Is it not like a Sepoy journal?
Of course, we shall be told it
is an accident, but we do not
think the excuse can be ac-
cepted, inasmuch as the sum-
mary is generally the best-done
= thing in the paper. We vote
that our bilious contemporary
be called upon publicly to
: restore to the insulted General
, the sixty guns he has been so
shamefully plundered of, and
further, that he be sentenced,
Ž as a fit penalty for his attempt
* at spoliation, to write ten
cheerful articles in ten con-
secutive numbers. To one of
- - his melancholy disposition,
who sees everything at home, and abroad in the deepest India black, we cannot imagine a
more terrible punishment. The only fear is, that the novelty might have the effect of selling
SAD OMISSION AT THE CATTLE-
SHOW.
WE regret to state, that the editor of the
Saturday Review sent several Pens to the exhi-
bition in Baker Street, but that they unfortu-
nately arrived too late. They were the Pens of
his various contributors. Every one of them
was of the cross-breed, but finer specimens of
the class could not well have been selected.
Judges of such articles declare, with the greatest
confidence, that they must have carried off the
rizes. All the Pens were to have been exhi-
ited in the Pig-Department. MR. GoLIGHTLY
TEAZIE had a highly-bred Pen that was ad-
mirably adapted “to go the whole hog”—at
least that was the compliment honourably con-
ferred upon it by the classic, Editor, who had

MR. PUNCH observes, with regret, that the directors of some of our
theatres are trying to take the bread out of the mouths of the penny
newspaper people, and their allies, the roaring ruffians who bawl news
in the quiet streets. It is growing a habit, when real or supposed
tidings have come in, for a manager or actor to step before the curtain,
and announce to the audience the contents of the Telegram. This
seems to us unfair, and calculated to injure the interests of the
Catchpenny Press. -
At least, we conceive, that, if a theatrical artist will meddle with
public affairs, he ought to do so artistically. He has no right simply
to plunder the newspaper. He ought to dress up his announcements
i in some little accordance with his vocation. If he be a singer, let him
give his news operatically; if a tragedian, poetically; if a comedian,
comically; if an equestrian, hoarsely.
For instance, suppose a Telegram has come in, and MR. HARRISON,
at the Lyceum, considers it desirable to communicate the news to the
house. Let him come forward to the footlights, and, with a glance at
MR. MELLON for a chord, sing what the poet of the Rose ºf Castille
would have written, as follows:–
|
|
THEATRICAL TELEGRAMS.
|
|
|
|
“I am not now a Muleteer,
I’ve news to tell that you should hear,
It's come by Telegram:
A glorious battle has been fought,
The rascally Sepoys have caught
A licking; yes, and so they ought,
From brave Sir Colin CAM.
(Bells.) CAM, CAM, CAM, CAM, CAM, CAM, CAM, CAM,
From brave'sſa Coin CAM.
His Bell would not come into rhyme,
And so down there you hear it chime,
(Bells.) CAM, CAM, CAM, CAM, CAM.”
Or, in the second case, we will imagine that MR. CRESWICK thought
it necessary to communicate the same sort of thing at the Surrey (not
that he has ever done so, yet): he should step out before the tragic
green baize is removed, and address the house:–
“War’s a dread thing, but, sanctified by right,
It is a noble thing. Noblest of all
- When it smites down the crest of cruel men.
CAMPBELL has closed with NANA. On the turf
Lie in their blood full fifteen thousand blacks,
And, 'mid them, on a gibbet, fouls the air
Their ruffian chief. Shout we for CoIIN CAMPBELL!”
Thirdly, let us suppose that MADAME CELESTE had desired to
apprise the Adelphi audience of the same fact, and had deputed our
friend—the world’s friend—MR. PAUL BEDFoºd, and his illustrious
ally, MR. WRIGHT, to make the speech. MR. B.’s wink would be
worth * as he surveyed the pit, and was monarch of all he
surveyed:—
Now, my bricksy-wicksy-wicksies, what doiyou say, eh? Haven't
the CAMPBELLs been coming, eh, and coming it pretty strong? We
rayther flatter our shirtbuttons that they have just been and done
that same.
Mr. Wright, P.S. (invisible). I say, JACK, what are you cackling
about P Mustn't talk to your benefactors like that, you know.
Mr. Bedford. Come along here, Guv'nor. Talk of cackling, here's
a billy ducks. (Produces paper.
Mr Wright (enters). Where's BILLY! ...Why, you stoopid old crea-
. * d'ye call that a billy for? Nice sort of a rhinoceros you
Illust be.
Mr. Bedford. Come, come, Gov'nor, don’t be hard on a fellah. We
haven't all got your hysterical information, you know. Read that
photographic messuage, Guv'nor.
Mr. Wright (with intense contempt). Photographic messuage! (Takes
the paper.) . It's my belief, JACK, that you’re a megalotherium. t’s
about the size of it.
Mr. Bedford. What’s that, Gov'nor?
Mr. "... A great beast, JACK. But never mind. You can’t
help it, and you wouldn't if you couldn't. Let's see, you old elephan
tiasis. (Reads the Telegram, amid shouts of applause.)
-
THE NEEDFUL METAL.
SoME of our readers may think that MR. CoMMISSIONER Got IBURN
was a little hard upon a party who appeared before him the other day
in the Court of Bankruptcy; and respecting whom he made the
following observation:—
“He then raised money upon those goods, and in the opinion of the Court only
satisfied the holder of the bill of lading by committing a fresh crime; namely, by
obtaining a quantity of tin, before he failed, from a MR. Jones.”
But, how could he, poor fellow, satisfy the holder of the bill other-
wise than by obtaining a quantity of tin from somebody or other? If
he had not procured the tin from MR. Jon Es, he would have been
| obliged to get it from MR. SMITH or MR. B.Row N, or MR. Robinson.
From the fact that he failed after having obtained thattin, his mistake
appears to have consisted in not obtaining enough.

ONE HockLEY WooD, an attorney, seems |
to have been utterly flabberghasted at a major ||
and a minor proposition set before him, last week
by LoRD MAYOR CARDEN. HockLEY had been
acting for some people who were making an
unjust charge of felony; and the case having
proved rotten, the MAYOR observed that it was
“monstrous that any solicitor should undertake
such a case.” This speech presented a new idea
to MR. WooD, who in his utter bewilderment
remarked that, “any solicitor must undertake
any case that is brought to him, so long as he is
on the rolls.” The MAYOR begged not only to
contradict Wood, but to add that no respectable
solicitor would have undertaken such a case as:
that? And he discharged the prisoner, the |
audience “cheering loudly.” We think SLR
RoBERT was a little hard on WooD. Perhaps
it was really the first time he had ever heard
that any work that is paid for is regarded by
society as too dirty for an attorney. His legal
education was *::: We do not think

. AN ACT OF CONTINENTAL GRACE.
It may be well occasionally to desist awhile from Qur habitual
practice of ridiculing our own British absurdities, in order to anim-
advert, with playful derision, on those of our Continental neighbours.
The subjoined telegram from Madrid is a piece of intelligence which
will excite the laughter of every rational Englishman:-
“The Prince has been baptized.
“An amnesty has been granted for political offences, and to persons condemned
to light punishments.”
That any excuse for pardoning political offenders may be a good one
in Spain, is possible enough; but what, reason is afforded by the
baptism of a royal baby for remitting the punishments of common
...'. What a set of fools we should have thought HER
MAJESTY's Ministers, if, on the occasion of our last Royal christening,
the HoME SECRETARY had ordered all the convicts under, sentence for
petty larceny to be let out of gaol Rogues are punished for the pro-
tection of the public; and all remission of the punishment of such
offenders is an abatement of that protection.
To signalize a baptism by the amnesty of pickpockets, is to increase
the general liability to the loss of pocket-handkerchiefs, and to make
that solemnity an occasion for indulging the worse portion of the
people to the detriment of the better.
There is a very particular reason why the inconsistent and irrational

DIVERS Bishops, in lawn, and in the richer livery of the Scarlet Lady,
have, at fitting times, received in these pages such castigation as erring
hierarchs deserve. But what are we to say of the new Bishop of
LONDON, DR, TAIT? Truly he is a scandal. This man has been down
among the dirty and squalid people of Bethnal Green, for the purpose, as
he says, of making himself acquainted with their condition. More,
he specially invited them to come to a church, whence he did his best
to exclude on that occasion (by what right, we should like to know,)
respectable folks. And he, the Bishop, a Lord in the House of Lords,
preached to these unclean creatures, and with his own lips (not even
º the doctrine through a clean chaplain) pressed upon them his
views for their welfare. He told them not to indulge in dreamy
notions about a heaven up in cloud-land, but assured them that there ||
would be a º new earth, on which should be neither sin, poverty,
nor sorrow, and he gave them certain advice as to qualifying themselves
for it. And hundreds of these creatures expressed their thankfulness.
This sort of thing will not do. . We can’t have seedy-minded Bishops.
We are happy to know that, painful as the task may be, DR. WILBER-
FoRQE has undertaken to remonstrate with the eccentric DR. TAIT, and
remind his Lordship of what he owes to his order. Luckily neither on
a Bishop's mitre nor a Baron's coronet are there leaves, or we should
have trèmbled for their fate among the silkworms.
Relief for Rich and Poor.
THE suspension of the stringent provision of the Bank Charter Act
has relieved the dealers in money. Could not the stringent provisions
of the Poor Law be slightly relaxed, also, in favour of the destitute,
thrown out of employment by the crisis? Surely Government and the
legislature will not play fast and loose: loose with the discount-houses,

After visiting the Cattle Show, Farmer Giles gets a “little bit o' dinner,” drinks a
bottle of “red poort,” and has a fearful dream in consequence.
A COMET IN A LAW COURT.
With all our depth of penetration, there are occasionally mysteries too deep for
us to fathom ; and such a one we find in the following statement by the Daily
News reporter, in re a recent applicant to the Insolvent Debtors’ Court:-
“This insolvent, a butcher, who applied under the Protection Act, attributed his appearance to
the high price of meat, and the loss he had sustained in June, when the Comet was expected, by a
large quantity being spoilt.” -
Whatever the “appearance” of this butcher may have been, we are puzzled to
conjecture how, in any way, he could assign it to the causes which he mentions.
The high price of meat º: undoubtedly affect the looks of many people, by forcing
them to total abstinence from that nutritious condiment, and compliance with the
dietary rules of Vegetarianism. The ruddiest of beef-eaters might show a change
in his appearance, were he driven by high prices to farinaceous viands, and lived a
month or two on cabbages washed down with toast, and water, . But we should
have thought a butcher was one of the last people to be forced to give up eating
meat, just as we should fancy that in case of any scarcity of coals, the last persons
to use wood would be the people of Newcastle.
But much as this may puzzle us, the second cause alleged is greatly more per-
§. How a butcher's meat can have been spoilt by the expectation of a
omet, it really quite surpasses our imagination to conceive. é have heard
wondrous tales of the appendages of Comets, which we have generally regarded as
tails for the Marines; but here we have a Comet appearing in a Law Court with
a tale of its destructiveness in bond ſide evidence, and no doubt supported by a
host of affidavits; it is worthy, too, of notice, as showing in the strongest light the
baleful influence of Comets, that the damage was occasioned not by actual approach,
but by mere expectation of the vagrant body. As coming events cast their shadows
before, so Comets, it would seem, are capable of damaging when merely in
expectancy.
Although we sympathise immensely with this unlucky butcher (who may thank
his stars, however, that he was not Comet-struck himself, as well as his large quan-
tity of meat), we can hardly be surprised at the upshot of his case, which resulted,
we are told, in an adjournment sine die; or, in other words, until the plea which he
set up should be capable of proof. In applying on such grounds for the protection
of the Court, the insolvent might as well have sued for its protection from the
Comet; and when next that visitor is currently expected, we should recommend
his seeking. #!". advice, as to how best to preserve his meat from being
spoilt by it. If it be thought that he would only show his weakness by taking
such a course, we consider that such imbecility would be
about on a par with the strength of his late, argument, in
showing cometary cause why he was entitled to protection
by the Act. We know when men are pushed for reasons,
they often have recourse to forcible expressions, but really
this assigning one’s misfortunes to a non-arriving Comet,
we can but view as an attempt to come-it much too strong.
SIGNS OF THE SEASON.
DISMANTLED now, the forest trees,
...Are in the dreary case, . . .
Since they have doffed their liveries,
Of footmen out of place.
All bare, except the evergreens,
Their leaves which do not shed,
The gloomy paths of sylvan scenes,
My highlows, cease to tread.
Along the pavements now to pad,
It is i.'. Way,
Where, whilst the groves are dark and sad,
The shops are bright and gay.
There let us muse upon the goods,
Which bid us understand
As fully as the leafless woods,
That Christmas is at hand.
The butchers’ to the pensive mind,
mpart a sweet relief;
There Meditation food may find
In lovely bits of beef.
And if perchance, a thought of gloom
May on the heart intrude,
We smile to think who can consume
All that amount of food.
The linendrapers' also teem
With objects rich and rare,
Which lovely beings truly dream
That they shall shortly wear,
Burnous, and Bertha, and Visite
Of azure, white and pink,
You hear them cry, “Oh dear! how sweet !
How charming ! Only think!”
Nor do the sons of Crispin not
The wayfarer amuse,
See in their windows, what a lot
Of smart white satin shoes!
Approaching parties these portend
To everythinking mind;
And thus, wherever we may wend,
Diversion still we find.
We see the grocers’ windows piled
With raisins, currants, spice.
“My eye l’exclaims the gazing child,
“How plummy! Oh! how nice!”
And then a maddening thought there comes,
And rushes o'er the brain:
We wish, when we behold those plums,
That we were boys again!
Tests of the Passions.

To find out whom a child loves, make it a present, and
notice to whom it is most eager to show that present,

to me.
In the sporting papers of about this time four years, or perhaps less,

gusted with the rascality which he has witncssed, and of which he has been a

how all gentlemen are deterred from the noble sport by the scoundrelism of those

And, my dear young Lord, your bankers’ account will be the worse by
some £30,000 by the interval between the two dates. And that sum
will have gone to benefit a set of fellows whom it would be a most
excellent thing to send to penal servitude for the rest of their natural
lives.
Come, GEORGE WILLIAM, there haye been some clever men in your

HOW MR. COOKE TAKES DELHI.
... WE used to think that there were nearly enough of the SoMERSETs
in the public service. Wherever there was a good berth vacated, if one
of that family did not get it, his failure was certainly not owing to any
want of asking. But there is a gentleman of the name whose merits
have been overlooked by all Governments, and that is MR. C. A.
SoMERSET, who supplies, ideas and dialogue, for the spectacles, at
Astley's. We only wish that he had been sent to India instead of that
unhappy LoRD CANNING. He would have made short work with the
Sepoy scoundrels. You would not have caught him insulting the
loyal English population of Calcutta, or its press, by placing, them
under the same disabling laws as the black traitors. .You would not
have found him preventing the Christian population from arming and
organising. You would not have i.” #. interposing between
treason and its punishment. In a word, SoMERSET would have been
as right as CANNING has been wrong, and that is saying a great deal.
This eulogy is not passed in ignorance of facts, as CANNING is
defended by his ministerial friends...We have seen Mr. SoMERSET's
notion of dealing with the Sepoys... We saw it from a box at Astley's;
and we declare it to be highly satisfactory. . A new spectacle has been
got up, in which the history of the rebellion is set out, from the mutiny
at Barrackpore to the storming of Delhi. It is a most animated affair
the interest never flags, and the author has had the good taste ;
elsewhere, and where it might have been reasonably looked for), to
omit º attempt at reproducing the horrors of the Indian crisis. We
see the black rascals º: and rebelling, and rendering themselves
just detestable enough to make the audience shout with joy when the
swift vengeance of countless supernumeraries, breaks upon the
miscreants, and they are banged, beaten, bayoneted, blown from guns,
or otherwise disposed of, as suits the scene. Small time are they
allowed even for their greatest triumph, when some ladies are made
captive. Hardly have the latter time to deal out defiance and a pistol-
shot or so, when in dash the Highlanders, and every ruflian is pinned
with the steel. Another attack upon the women is punished even
more summarily—the soldiers, borrowing the bonnets, lie in ambush,
and as the Sepoys rush upon a defenceless prey, out leaps the
blasting volley. And as for Delhi, the revenge of England comes down
upon it * storm of fire that makes you smell powder for an hour
erWards.
The spectacle is quite a national one, and sends away the audience
most confirmed anti-sentimentalists. LoRD CANNING's head is said
to be very cool—as cool as his conduct—but we have a motion that a
jury from Astley’s would order it off with very considerable prompti-
tude. British enthusiasm is thoroughly stirred up, and we are far from
sure that if the Sepoy actors held out too long, a reinforcement from
the pit would not storm the orchestra and whack the traitors. And
when it is desired to concentrate the feeling of the house, MR. JAMES
HollowAY, as a Serjeant-Major, promoted to be a Cornet, (the exclu-
sive system will not do coran populo) fights such a dreadful sword
combat with four enemies, that the applause of the spectators becomes
hurricanish. The Generals, HAVELock, HEARSEY (with no one to snub
him for promptly doing a wise thing), Wilson, and others, ride with
heroic recklessness, . young MR. CookE, as a military photographer,
is alternately ºf and valiant, as circumstances dictate. In fine,
those who want to see lots of soldiers of all sorts, good fierce fighting,
and the invariable triumph of HER MAJESTY's arms, had better go
over Westminster Bridge, which is still tolerably safe.
