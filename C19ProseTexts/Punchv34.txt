T might have been at Freemasonic Hart's—it might have been after earnest diving into QUARTER-MAINE
Liquor Law-it might have been during a study of Women of England after Ellis. Never mind that.
FAHRENHEIT filled his glass to 90, and Mr. Punch filled his to—but never mind that. It had been a
very good dinner, and the other noblemen and their ladies had gone out into the balcony.
The foremost man of all this world went to sleep. No. He did not so condescend. Sleep came
to him, gentle, and whispering, and cooing, like a wife who wants an extra cheque.
And he slept
pleasantly, as a husband who has promised to draw one.
A dream came to him. If, beloved, you will only take flounders, and salmon, and eels stewed
and fried, and sole, and mullet, and lamprey, and whitebait, and trout with Tartar sauce, and ducklings,
and peas, with a few trifles of cream, jellies, and ices, adding strawberries and cherries, casting in sherry,
hock, Moselle, champagne, and maraschino, and then pouring on claret of the first price, until you go
to sleep, perhaps you may have a dream, too. If you have not, the preliminary process will repay you
—and your host.
And Mr. Punch dreamed that he was MR. RAREY.
And behold, Rulers of the Earth had been turned into quadrupeds, by an elevating and improving
magic, a hint from
" the Ævan bay,
Where CIRCE dwelt, the daughter of the Day."
And their people brought them to the great RAREY-Punch that he might tame them.
Came prancing in, a haughty black horse, with a red eye, and he tried to trample upon everything
in his way. They called him Corsican. A Newspaper was laid before him, and he stamped it to
atoms, and only to those who approached him on their knees would he be placable. Mr. Punch talked
to him for five minutes, and then Corsican ran playfully about, holding the Cap of Liberty between his teeth.
He kicked a hole in a drum, and snorted with delight as Mr. P. whistled our National Anthem.
Keys embroidered on his cloth, there entered a sleek, but vicious-looking Italian horse, named
Tiara, His vice, as was explained by one Mazzini, his keeper, was, that having gained your confidence
by apparent good-nature, he would strike out, lame you, and try to roll over you. He had actually

maimed, in this manner, another horse called Liberty, who had then been killed by a French quack
veterinarian. In ten minutes Tịara was dancing on his hind legs, to the music of LUTHER'S Hymn.
A handsome creature, of Spanish blood, was then introduced. She was named The Innocent.
She had fondling and wheedling ways, but suddenly lashed out and bit venomously, and never was so
dangerous as when apparently in the best humour. She came of a bad stock, but ill-training had been
the poor thing's worst enemy. Very brief time passed, and she was caracoling round the ring, delighted
with a popular air called the Pronunciamento.
Why a Turkish horse, named Abdul, was brought to Mr. Punch, he could not tell, the animal
being in an enfeebled condition, and incapable of doing much harm. The point seemed to be to give
him activity, but the only thing that excited him was the attempt to take away any of his gay trappings.
There was talk of entering him for the Enlightenment Stakes, but he evidently could not live the pace.
Then came Bomba, an obstinate brute, exceedingly malicious, whose forte was getting anybody into
a corner, keeping him there, and occasionally kicking him in the face or stomach. The stern, yet mild
Dompteur stood no nonsense from this animal, and in a quarter of an hour he amiably beat time to a
hymn of Watt's, and it was clear that he would see no enemy in a PARK.
A rather young horse from Vienna was next subjected to the process. He also was ill-bred rather
than positively vicious, and he became frightened at the commonest objects, when nothing allayed him
but the sight of soldiers' uniforms. He was gradually familiarised, by the Tamer, with the sight of the
obnoxious articles, and speedily allowed a Newspaper to be freely flung at him.
Some Russians then came with a horse called Alexander, “I had a good deal of trouble with his
Sire,” said Mr. P., “but this seems altogether a horse of another colour.” And so it proved, Alexander
rather shying at the sound of a gun, but being apparently pleased with that of the railroad. “A free
goer,” said Mr. Punch, “and I hope to see him at Ascot."
Lastly came a Yankee horse called President Sly Boots. The moment he entered, he deliberately
winked at Mr. PUNCH. The latter went gently up to him, and, being a master of the American language,
addressed him as follows :-“I calklate, old hoss, as you ain't in want of no teaching from me. Lookin'
reound after Cruiser, air you? Never mind about cruisers. That's all square, yes, Sir-ee.
knows it all-fired well, old hoss. Yew git out!” added Mr. Punch, with one of Mrs. BARNEY WILLIAMS's
most brilliant squalls.
President Sly Boots set up such an uncommon hearty horse-laugh, that Mr. Puncu awoke, and
determined to prefix his dream to his

RANDOM REFLECTIONS.
Next to that of umbrellas, the ownership of books is
perhaps the least respected. Hence the philosophical
though rude remark, that fools lend books, and wise men
borrow them.
The value of a "good thing” depends on him who utters
it. The joke of the host is certain to be laughed at; that
of the poor relation is scarcely even listened to.
My Son, if thou wilt wear tight boots, there are three
bad things thou wilt inevitably suffer; namely, a bad corn,
a bad gait, and a bad temper.

when the laws of private property extend to umbrellas, and
a case of confiscation may be dealt with as a theft; when a
laundress in the Temple gives up taking snuff, and abstains

In a song rather popular some years ago, a gentleman used to pay

this filial tribute to the talent of his departed parent :
"O, feyther bad a jolly knack

The lines occurred to Mr. Punch as he was consulting a batch of

to work. For every body makes Almanacks now, and with very few
exceptions, they are all stupid affairs. The Meteor which appeared to
announce the publication of Mr. Punch's Own, and about which so
many letters were written by astounded sky-gazers, was a very appro-
priate tribute to the single work of the kind that can be pronounced
perfect. But though perfection is not to be expected elsewhere than at
85, Fleet Street, why need a thousand calendar-makers do their work
so badly?
What is the use of sticking against certain dates, that HORNE

begins-that the Battle of Ravenna was fought-that Pickles were
invented—that CICERO was murdered—that GARRICK appeared—that

forth? Two-thirds of the dates which are usually commemorated
nobody cares about, except those who will not be satisfied with such a
barren record. Next, the jumble of things makes these memoranda
more absurd, for the person who cares about BARBAROSSA does not
care either for GARRICK or pickles, and the GARRICK fancier is not
likely to be much interested in the Battle of Ravenna. As for the
sporting entries, they are simply idiotic. What sportsman needs to
be told when he may blaze at grouse, and when at pheasant? And
who else wants to know anything about the matter?

Englishmen.
HENRY Watt and CHARLES PARK, British subjects, have been, by
the command of the absolute BOMBA, now since the end of June last,
confined, first for three months in BOMBA's dungeon of Vicaria, and
subsequently in his other dungeon of Salerno, near Naples.
In the first of these dungeons they were stripped naked by the police
or prison authorities, and, in that state, insulted and jeered at by those
blackguards. They have been confined in a prison consisting of two
small, dark, and very damp holes, destitute of ventilation, and kept in
a condition too filthy to be described by Mr. Punch. Under these
sanitary circumstances, they were immured during July, August, and
September, the three hottest months of the year. They left these
sties only to be examined by the police, and were handcuffed in going
and returning.
Their diet was suitable to the character of their prison-bad black
bread, and soup so nasty that they could not swallow it; a combination
of liquid and solid aliment resembling that on which British pigs are
ordinarily kept when not particularly meant to be fattened. It was,
doubtless, stuff like hogwash-with a difference for the worse. In
addition, they were allowed four grani a-day: which did not, however,
raise their allowance to an equality with pigs' dietary, as pigs usually
get a quantity of grains considerably exceeding four, even interpreting
that number of Neapolitan grani to signifythree half-pence and a fraction.
Their beds differed from the litter of swine chiefly as to the bed-
steads, which consisted of boards supported on trestles. Their
bedclothes were formed of one mattress stuffed with bad tow, mixed
with bits of straw. The document which Mr. Punch is quoting some-
what needlessly adds, that "they suffered much from vermin."
From the abominable lairs of Vicaria they were transferred to the
Salerno dungeon, handcuffed and strapped back by the arms with a
tightness which tormented them; and in this misery they were con-
veyed a journey of thirty miles by night, at a slow pace, in a carriage
almost air-tight. They cried for air, and it was refused them.
This treatment caused Watts to show symptoms of insanity, and
has afflicted PARK with fits.
These British subjects are imploring Bomba to bring them to trial
for the offence of which they are aecused. This consists simply in the
fact that they were found on board the Cagliari steamer, acting as
engineers. They say that they were compelled to do so under duress.
They demand their trial, fondly trusting to substantiate their defence
-fondly; because BOMBA's Attorney-General has been trying to
tamper with depositions which they propose to produce in their favour.
Even trial is denied them.
Under these circumstances it is not at all wonderful that the blood
of old GENNARO should boil-if, under any, it is capable of miracu-
lously assuming fluidity. It will be very much more wonderful if the
blood of old John Bull does not boil, and boil violently over, at the
spectacle of the cruelties, indignities, and injustice inflicted by the
modern TIBERIUS on the betters of Roman citizens.

THE MUSIC OF NATURE.
WHEN we are out upon the hills,
"Tis sweet to list to rural sounds;
A mingled noise of purling rills,
Of lowing kine, and baying bounds,
And many a small bird's mingled song
Arises from the vale below;
Unless perchance the wind is wrong,
And from our ears the sound should blow.

(if)
We note the crowing of the cock,
We mark the steed's far distant neigh,
We hear the bleating of the flock,
And donkey after donkey bray,
All these are common notes 'tis true,
Which humble instruments produce,
Yet are they sweet to listen to;
And there's the cackle of the goose:
The duck, too, lends her tuneful quack,
To swell the music of the vale,
The mill supplies its ceaseless clack :
Add songs that smack of too much ale,
All these are sounds remembered well,
And o'er the memory oft they ring;
On such the Poet loves to dwell,
When he invokes the Muse to sing.
But oh! there is one simple sound,
Amid the rustic symphony,
That never yet hath poet found,
Most sweet, most striking though it be.
It is a pleasing cry of pain,
First loud and strong, then soft and weak,
Which language to describe is vain-
The dying pig's perpetual squeak.

MARRIAGE ON SMALL MEANS.

BY A SWELL OF SLENDER INCOME.
To marry a girl on three hundred a-year,
Would involve self-denial extremely severe,
When if ten times that income a fellow enjoyed,
On his pleasures and wants it might all be employed.
I must put down my brougham if I am to wed,
And establish a cradle, of course, in its stead.
I must give up my club and my sporting pursuits,
And resort to cheap tailors, and wear fewer boots.
A wife, whom a fellow has got to support,
Is the dearest of things that a fellow can sport;
And still dearer are children-I speak in the sense
Of a man of the world-in respect of expense.
Oh, yes! I'm aware the cigars I consume
Are so much per annum that flies off in fume,
And I know that the sum wbich in smoke I expend,
Would suffice to procure tops and bottoms no end.
My cab-hire would buy lots of small boots and shoes,
But the latter investment I beg to refuse,
And I'd rather devote all I could from my store
To buy my own boots—which I mentioned before.
Of course, if a man gives up all that makes life
Worth living, why then he may marry a wife,
Whose face is her fortune-whilst all he has got,
Will just serve to boil-horrid object—the pot.
I wish you may get it-I wish you may see
Myself in a chair with a child on each knee,
And a number of others, about me at play,
In a cottage, with nowhere to put them away.
I'll follow my pleasures, I'll stick to my club,
And while I'm enjoying my glass and my grub,
With content I'll regard want of conjugal bliss,
Exclaiming, “That isn't so jolly as this."

as none but warm imaginations could bave possibly predicted.
But however wonderful it may have been in England, the mildness
in Calcutta has, we are obliged to say, been far more extraordinary.
Among the proofs of it with which the press has overflowed, this
extract from the Daily News is the most recently confirming :-
"In Delhi and the neighbnurhood our lenient policy, MR. COLVIN's proclamation
and the Clemency of CANNING' have been bearing the richest fruit. Very few of
the inhabitants of the villages which revolted have been punished, notwithstanding
that in almost all our fugitive countrymen and women experienced the most savage
and inhuman treatment. It is stated by an eye witness that our soldiers. having
made what was considered too god å use of the bayonet against these assassins,
have been disarmed, and clubs placed in their bands; that the wretched Goojurs,
whose normal vocation is robbery and murder, have raised a canvas city outside the
walls of Delhi, and are paying for admission within ; that the King still holds his
regal state, and that bis youngest son, notwithstanding the comments of our fettered
press, still rides about on an elephant, waited upon by two English offers. When
it is recollected that the Princes of Delhi commenced the massacre in May last, by
shooting from their chairs of state our unhappy countrymen who took refuge in the
Palace, we may be excused for not keepivg our indignation pent up within our
breasts, and for announcing the simple facts to our countrymen in England.”
The only thing that tends to shake our faith in this intelligence is
the statement with respect to these two English officers, who are said
to be in waiting on the young Black Prince of Delbi. The disarming
of our soldiers we can readily believe, and we should fancy that the
clubs which were exchanged to them for bayonets were mere panto-
mimic “properties” of cottonwool and canvas, constructed so as not
to hurt the poor dear darling Sepoys on whose precious heads and
shoulders they might chance to fall. We can well believe too that
LORD CLEMENT CANNING's orders have been to punish nobody whom
it was possible to spare ; and that therefore the misguided villagers,
who helped the mutineers in their devilish atrocities, have been let off
with a caution not to do so any more. But that a brace of British
officers should have been made the waiting-men or fluu keys of the
Prince of Delhi Darkness, is a statement such as only a MUNCHAUSEN
could have dreamed of, and its obvious untruthfulness must throw
a shade of doubt upon the rest of the intelligence.

newspaper report-a paper was read by DR. ALEXANDER PEDDIE ON

Ne'er may your life wax shady,
Still may your path be shiny,
All rosy-nothing spiny.

You were bebolding lately,
A point, which I may mention,
Perhaps won your attention :
The line of Kings, descending
From Banquo, never ending;
I hail you the Queen Mother,

May the first line long sit in
The royal seat of Britain,
On Prussia's throne the second,
From you to doomsday reckoned.

Bid evermore to treason,

Conjoined by lasting tether,
May they both pull together.

rumour, which ran the whole length

until it had reached Regent Street,
that the Beadle of the Exeter

to death whilst in the passive dis-

rumour assumed the most alarming
proportions on account of the deso-

region, as it became painfully evi-

befalling that respected official,
there would not be a living soul
near him to render him the smallest
assistance. Accordingly, a small
party of benevolent individuals
formed themselves into a heroic
party, and lost no time in hurrying
to the locale in question. To their
great relief, they found the Beadle
in the perfect possession of his

A FEW QUERIES TOUCHING A LATE
WEDDING.
Can't our penny-a-liners be loyal,
Without writing themselves down flunkeys ?
Can't our crowd gape at ciphers royal,
Without such percentage of " drunkies ?"
When we want a wedding cantata
For our PRINCESS Royal's espousal,
Why for a TENNYSON CATNach barter,
An owl for a singing ouzel ?
When English fiddlers find fingers,
And an English composer chords,
Can't we find six English singers,
Who at least could pronounce the words ?
When the flame of loyal feeling
Breaks out in an illumination,
Must we always be revealing
Our dearth of artistic creation ?
With official and non-official
Conceptions put to tension,
Is wreath and star and initial
The limit of our invention ?
Can't we find for our toiling masses
Some féle beyond a street-tussle ?
Some show for our upper classes
Of more state than a play-house hustle ?
Must we still in ruts of old stick,
All alike, both high and humble,
Our nobs the slaves of Goldstick,
Our snobs the slaves of BUMBLE ?

AN ASTONISHING MAYOR.
THERE is a certain Mayor that may be described as a lusus natura.
The Mayor in question is alluded to in the following extract from the
columns of a very loyal contemporary, relative to the provincial re-
joicings of Monday last :-
“Not a single preparation of the slightest character was made to commemorate
the event, which was suffered to possess no more interest here than if Oxford had
not been part and parcel of HER MAJESTY's dominions.
But the fault does
not rest with the citizens, who as a body will not yield in loyalty and attachment to
their Sovereign, and all that is near and dear to her, to any of her loving subjects;
but Oxford, unfortunately, has at the present moment, at the head of affairs, one
who, though a good and benevolent
man in himself, is exceedingly crotchety on
all matters relating to the dignity of office and public observances. In proof of this,
he refuses to wear the robes of office, to go to Church with the corporation, as has
been the case here from time immemorial, to allow the mace to be carried in proces-
sion there, or to recognise the
Judges of the land by presenting them at the assizes
with the customary gloves. With such a wet blanket thrown upon it, Oxford could
not be expected to do much."
What an extraordinary Mayor! This Mayor of Oxford really seems
to have a perception of the ludicrous; an idea of mock solemnity and
burlesque. He actually thinks that a municipal person, strutting in
robes behind a beadle, who also struts shouldering a gilt club, çuts a
ridiculous figure. He entertains a heterodox contempt for absurd
pomp, and, there is every reason to believe, would look, with appalling
irreverence, on the greatness and glory of the opening scene of the
sublimest of Christmas pantomimes.

ODE TO PHIPPS.
Who through life so gaily trips
As a man whose name is PHIPPS?
Lightly through the world he slips,
All its choicest honey sips.
Him no trouble ever grips ;
Him no winter ever nips;
He burns wax while we burn dips :
Let him err, yet no one whips,
As we'd serve out rogues and rips.
If a wit, we hail his quips ;
If a captain, he gets ships;
If a schoolboy, each one tips ;.
Cards for him have heaviest pips,
He's a god to snobs and snips :
Toadies hang upon his lips :
Luckier than POPE'S MR. CRIPPS,
Or than prosperous SAMUEL PEPYS
Honour's fountain o'er him drips,
Nought his fortune's pinions clips.
Let us with hurrahs and hips
Cheer each man whose name is PHIPPS.
CONCESSION TO THE PEACE SOCIETY,
FROM some statements published by a contem-
porary on the subject of ordnance, it appears
that the cost of a 13-inch shell, as it flies through
the air, is two pounds ten shillings. At each
explosion there go two guineas, bang! The esti-
mated cost of firing a 36-inch bomb is nearly
thirty pounds. These figures afford some idea
of the shelling out which is necessitated by
warfare. We hear a good deal of the bore of
monster mortars ; but it is a still more mon-
strous bore that we should be obliged to blow
away, in making other people miserable, the
enormous sums that would suffice to make
ourselves jolly.

Outpoured from heroes' veins,
Where gallant NICHOLSON and NEILL
Have found a soldier's grave,
And though unscathed by shot or steel,
Fell HAVELOCK good and brave ?
Were they whom hosts of orphans weep,
Whom crowds of widows mourn,
In peace that we may eat and sleep
From friends and kinsfolk torn
Their toils, their pains, did they endure,
And were their lives but sold,
That we might life enjoy secure,
Whilst they in death are cold.
That we might safely count our gains,
Increasing day by day,
Only for that, are their remains
Now mouldering into clay ?
That wealth, with unabated flood,
To England's shores might flow,
Shed they alone their noble blood,
And are they lying low?
Laid they their lives down but for this,
That Commerce might pursue
Her thriving course, and rich men miss
No doit of revenue?
Of pompous wealth, of mere purse-pride
The champions, did they fall?
If so, they martyrs only died
To Mammon after all.

FORTUNATE FELLOWS:
Not so; those martyrs' blood, we trust,
To better purpose sown,
Will not have sunk in Indian dust,
To bear such fruit alone:

as Sir Henry RAWLINSON, took the oaths and his seat for Reigate.

an amusing experiment was made, by a sort of partial adoption of the

contrived to “manipulate” the voting papers.

TOUGH BOILED BEEF; OR, THE
FAMISHED SOLDIER.
A Domestic Romance.
A SOLDIER came to my area gate,
Whom my wife would have sent away,
For our larder had suffered much of late ;
But I said, Let the Warrior stay.
Let him go to his Cook for something to eat,
For his hunger craves relief;
He'll enjoy a bit of good cold meat,
After living on tough boiled beef.
Beyond all trades, to the trade of war,
Do victims the fastest fall;
But consumption thins the ranks by far
More quickly than steel or ball.
They give them worse than paupers' food,
Much worse than they give a thief;
How the deuce are our foes to be subdued
On a diet of tough boiled beef ?
How the fuel can keep pluck's fire alight
Is what doth exceed my ken.
I wonder how our regiments fight
On such a regimen.
'Twere no marvel at all if the bravest host
Should in action come to grief,
Being victualled, not on the
best of roast,
But the worst of tough boiled beef.
Let my kitchen's plenty, then, repair
soldier's wasted frame,
Supplying his country's lack of care
For the sustenance of the same.
Let the sausage, too, hiss in the frying-pan,
With all my heart, right lief.
I will not grudge it that valiant man,
Who is sick of the tough boiled beef.
Hungry soldier, thou’rt welcome here,
Thou shalt have a good blow-out,
Go some of ye, fetch him a pot of beer,
Ale, or half-and-half, or stout.
There's a cold leg of mutton, I think, below;
Wrap it up in a handkerchief;
Thou may'st bear it away-for 'twill be, I trow,
A change from thy tough boiled beef.

ROMAN VACANCIES.
The subjoined is worth reprinting, for the
sake of our comments upon it:-
“A letter from Rome, of the 6th, says: 'CARDINAL
FIESCHI died last night. His death makes the number of
vacant hats in the Sacred College eleven.'
Does the vacancy of a hat consist in the
emptiness of the head that is inside it, because
if so, we need not go to Rome to gaze on a like
vacancy. Walk down. Pall Mall, or St. James's
Street, at the hour when the empty swells come
out thickest, and you will see vacant hats by the
dozen. By the bye, if there are vacant hats, we
suppose there are also vacant bonnets ?
The
yacancy is not at all improbable, inasmuch as it
is quite a rarity, from the present fashion of
wearing the bonnet down the back, that one
ever sees a lady's head inside it. However,
there can be no doubt as to the peculiarity of
the hats hanging on the eleven pegs in the
Sacred College above mentioned. Depend upon
it, the "vacancy” consists in the fact of each
of them covering a caput mortuum.

ODDITIES OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
The Electric Telegraph is continually making the drollest
mistakes. The other day came the subjoined telegram in
reference to the Dacca mutineers :-
“ABRYULE is keeping a sharp look-out for them.”
"FRATER,” in a letter to the Times, suggested that
ABRYULE was probably MR. YULE, the energetic Commis-
sioner of the Bhaulgulpore division. But how came the
telegraph to call MR. YULE ABRY? Is his name ABRAHAM,
and was ABRY delivered as the abbreviation of that name
by the sender of the message ? or is ABRY to be regarded
merely in the light of a telegraphic mull? This may seem
a question of not very much inportance, but it opens up
an interesting field of inquiry. The wire which creates

SIR RICHARD BETHELL came down to the Commons, so absorbed in

utterly forgot the change of Ministry, went to his old place, and sat
down by MR. WHITESIDE. The latter was so taken by surprise that
he actually had not time to interpret this into an insult, and to put
himself in a rage; and he went so far as to shake hands with SIR
RICHARD, a liberty which aroused him to a sense of his situation, and
he darted over from WHITESIDE to his right side. New writs were
ordered for the Ministerial constituencies-(SIR BULWER LYTTON,

“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH, “ Hyacinth Cottage, Tuesday, 1858.
"As you are always the Champion of the outraged and oppressed,
I make no apologies for troubling you with this, for I am sure you will
allow it is a case of real distress, and one that has the strongest claims
upon your sympathy. The appeal I wish to make, through your widely
influential and delightful columns, is in behalf of a most suffering and
most deserving class; who, although you have occasionally ridiculed
their weaknesses, yet feel they can rely on your known gallantry to help
them. The martyrs I allude to are those poor injured creatures, the
MOTHERS-IN-LAW of this our otherwise 'happy land ;' and as I am
not ashamed to own I am one of them myself, you must excuse me if
my feelings prove too strong for my propriety.
Now, goodness knows, I'm not of a complaining disposition, and
I'm sure as for that matter there's no more uncomplaining creature
living than a Mother-in-law. But there are some things, Mr. Punch,
that would aggravate an angel : and the way these horrid men who
have been writing to the Times, and divulging half the secrets of
their 'frugal' married life, and for my part I'm astonished at their
making such disclosures, and putting down their Washing and their
Doctors' bills, and even nursery expenses, it's really quite indelicate,

fact of there being such a person in existence as his Mother-in-law, I'm

VIRGIL v. PALMERSTON.
Boru PUBLIUS VIRGILIUS MARO and JOHN WILLIAM TEMPLE
VISCOUNT PALMERSTON, have given a sketch of the "Civis Romanus,"
according to their notion of the qualities implied in the word. There is
matter for close and edifying comparison in the two pictures.
That of the Roman Poet occurs in the 6th book of the Aneid, where
Pius ÆNEAS descending into the lower world under convoy of the
Sibyl, meets the shade of ANCHISES, who paints him a picture, by
anticipation, of the greatness of the future Rome.
Here is the "Civis Romanus" of Publius VIRGILIUS MARO:-
Excudent alii spirantia mollius era,
Credo equidem, et vicos ducent de marmore vultus,
Orabunt causas melius, cælique meatus
Describent radio, et labentia sidera mundi.
Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.
Hæ tibi erunt artes, pacisque imponere morem,
Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos."
A very stately picture, it must be owned, and one which, with a
slight permutation in the last line, has a close parallel in the “ Civis
Romanus" of the late PREMIER. PALMERSTON'S “ Civis Romanus," it
will be seen, is in effect VIRGIL'S--with a difference:-
“Let France in her bronzes excel us,
And such like artistic knick-knackery,
JOHN BULL is too wise to be jealous
Of skill in such flimsy gim-crackery.
Own we can't make a statue, at any rate,
Though we're quite up to snuff at a mull;
Admit that our Bar is degenerate,
And our talking in Parliament dull.
Let us grant without scruple LEVERRIER
Out-telescopes Adaus by far.
What's the odds ? The more plauets the merrier,
And Neptune can't be a French Star.
Remember as “ Civis Romanus,".
You've to rule all the world, if you can:
There's no fact of history so plain as
That your field of empire is man.
Leave the weak, though their cause be a holy one :
Back the strong, though your conscience cry nay,
Knuckle down before Louis NAPOLEON,
And bully COMMISSIONER YEH !
A Man to be Carefully Avoided.
“Oh! yes,” exclaimed young SHARPUS, at a deserted hotel in the
loneliest part of Southend," I always make a point of travelling with a
pack of cards-trust me for that. There's no knowing, you see, my
boy, what may turn up in the course of one's travels.''

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

About the hour when LORD PALMERSTON proceeded to the Palace
for the purpose of tendering his official resignation, a whisper got
abroad that MR. Cox, the indefatigable Member for Finsbury, had
professed himself in readiness to undertake the Premiership, and had
every expectation of a summons from HER MAJESTY. It is understood
that Mr. Cox, when this suggestive rumour reached him, immediately
rushed home to put on his Court suit, and gave directions that a
Hansom cab should be in waiting, that he might lose no time in obeying
the behest.
The Honourable MR. HARDUPPE, the representative of Rotten-
borough, employed the whole of Saturday in calling on his tradesmen;
assuring them that, now LORD Derby would come in, he was certain
of a place, and they were certain of some payment.
Upon leaving the Palace, after giving in his resignation, LORD PAL-
MERSTON was met by the MARQUIS OF CLANRICARDE; and the two
proceeded in close conference until they reached the residence of the
EARL OF DERBY. LORD PALMERSTON at parting was observed to wink
distinctly twice with his left eye; and the MARQUIS OF CLANRICARDE,
after solemnly slapping his nose with his right fore-finger, threw away
his cigar-end down the EARL OF DERBY's area, as an intimation pro-
bably that his attempt to form a Ministry would doubtless end in
smoke.
Somewhat later in the evening a conference was held in the small
supper room at the Tantivy Club, at which the voices of LORD SCAT-
TERBRAIN and SIR NOYsEY RATTELTRAPPE, the members for Great
Boresboth, were most in the ascendant. The conference was afterwards
adjourned to the smoking-room, but we are unaware if anything
resulted from it more important than a headache.
We are, we think, exclusively enabled to report that, throughout the
interregnum, there have every night been meetings in the Card-room
of the Loo Club; and we believe that some deep games are understood

NEVER may the Pass-port System be introduced into Old England

A RAILWAY THAT PAYS.
The Eastern Counties Railway appears to be a paying concern--in
a certain sense. At the usual half-yearly meeting of its company, lately
held at the London Tavern, Bishopsgate Street, under the presi-
dency of MR. HORATIO Low, the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
a very remarkable oration was delivered by a-
“MR. VANCE, who complained of the excessive and unjust taxation to which
Railway property was subject, and that was one cause of its depreciation. (Peor,
hear.) He complained of the severe manner in which LORD CAMPBELL'S Act ope-
rated upon Railway Companies as regards accidents. During the past half-year the
Eastern Counties had paid £4,000 for compensation for injuries to passengers.".
A very paying concern, truly, to have paid £4,000 damages in half
a year for compensation for injuries to passengers ! Broken bones
appear to form a costly breakage on the Eastern Counties Line.
Fracture-and-contusion-money seems to constitute a large portion of
the working expenses of the Eastern Counties Railway. How to
arrest this awful waste of capital? Hear MR. HORATIO Low:-
“ The Chairman said that the matters complained of had had their most serious
attention, and he could assure them that every resistance possible would shortly be
organized by the Railway Company themselves."
Did it not occur to MR. HORATIO Low that if he were to organize
the arrangements of his dangerous railway rather better, he would
adopt the best method of saving fracture-money, in saving fractures ?
How much have other railways—the South Western for instance, had
to pay for the negligence of their servants within the same period ?
“Thrift, thrift HORATIO!” may be a very natural demand on the part
of Mr. Vance and the other shareholders, but the wisest frugality of
MR. HORATIO Low would be that of economizing the hurts and maims
which prove so expensive to the Society whose affairs he superintends,
To organize resistance to a wholesome law will only involve additional
and unavailing disbursement. HORATIO's tbrift should consist in the
reduction of casualties involving liabilities for funeral baked meats
and similar matters, such as surgeons' fees, splints and bandages. If
he wants to organize a scheme for enabling the affairs of his Railway
to be conducted without any care for the safety of its passengers, he
should begin by stopping the mouths of such indiscreet complainants
as MR.VANCE. Who that is informed that the Eastern Counties Railway
is paying at the rate of £8,000 a-year for damage done thereon to life
and limb, will not carefully make his will before risking his carcase
upon it; or, unless under the pressure of the direst necessity, will

But still let us hope, if we've short lives to run,
They may turn out more merry, than six years ere this ;
And I earnestly beg, when a job's to be done,
You won't mull it like W. B. (whom we miss).
But come—the more rare is our chance of a start,
The more we should make of this lucky encore;
In office we meet : who knows when we may part ?
You'll have one quarter-day, though you may not have more.
Then go in to win: tip convictions the wink;
We've no credit to lose and a great deal to gain :
And if we've no principle, serving for link,
What's principle's línk, boys, to interest's chain ?
" AND DOTH NOT A MEETING."
(As sung by LORD DERBY ON welcoming, in 1858, his old Cabinet of 1852.).
AND doth not a Meeting like this make amends
For the years I've been sporting and spouting away,
To see thus around me my 'Fifty-two friends,
Once more looking forward to sweet quarter-day?
Though o'er some of your consciences, thoughts of lang syne,
And poor old Protection, be stealing-what then ?
That humbug is buried : your blushes, nor mine,
Can't bring the old lady to being again.
What mingled remembrances creep o'er the heart,
On re-entering the room, where we last had our fling !
The mistakes and the mulls, in which each bore his part,
Stilléround it, like last night's tobacco-smoke, cling.
As letters some Frail hath unwarily traced,
In Election Committee-rooms steal on the sight,
So-a Mene and Tekel, I had hoped effaced
Large W. B.s on the walls come to light.
Yet though, as through pages of HANSARD we wade
To recal our old words, e'er rehearsing our new,
We may here and there come on an awkward parade
Of unredeemed pledges and hopes gone askew;
We surely can fill up the Sessional hours
With the Bills the late Cabinet leaves us in store;
Beg the country will kindly consider them ours,
And give us a twelvemonth of place, as before.
So frail is our tenure, four quarters, at most,
Is all you can touch of the pay you hold dear;
E'en majorities often (Pam knows) may be lost:
And majorities aren't much in our line, I fear.
THE DIVINITY OF RANK.
The Univers boasts that during the last few years there have been
converted to Popery in England, 3 duchesses, 1 marquis, 2 countesses,
4 viscountesses, & ladies, 10 baronets, 2 archdeacons, 85 clergymen, and
272 persons moving in the upper ranks of life; and further glories in
the fact that English titles imply genuine aristocracy, and not sham.
Apparently the Univers thinks that genuine titles involve theological
intuitions, and that true aristocracy, enjoys an instinct for the dis-
cernment of true faith. If the list had run thus, 3 mathematicians,

sicians, 2 surgeons, 85 solicitors, and 272 other persons engaged in
intellectual professions, it would have been somewhat more to the
purpose. Rationality and education may be conceived to have some-
thing, at least, to do with the determination of doctrinal questions :
but it is difficult to conceive what peculiar ability to decide in matters
of religion appertains to rank.

ROMANCE OF A ROOMY 'BUS.
“THERE, why don't yer get out and ride ?"
A smart and lively Cabman cried
To us—there were but two of us,
Inside a stopping omnibus.
This omnibus, some minutes good,
Still at the Knightsbridge stand had stood;
The Cabman marked the long delay,
Which caused him what he said to say.
“Bank!” the Conductor cried, “Bank! Bank!”
Whilst laughter shook the Cabman's rank;
“Bank !-why the Bank might shut up shop,
Thought I, my friend, whilst thus you stop.”
The vehicle was a " Saloon;"
“I shall not end my journey soon,”
I said in my impatient breast :
Again the Cabman urged his jest.
An old red 'bus had passed the new,
Wherein there sat alone we two.

Still, still by repetition gained.
At length, afraid that we should stay

AMIABLE LANGUAGE.”
IF Britain with BOMBA the Bourbon must cope,
She must give up reliance on diplomate's soap,
To Civis Romanus no longer resort, or
To MALMESBURY's douches of mild milk and water-
Quintessence of “amiable language."
Each dodge diplomatic in vain we have tried :
Have prayed, cringed, and blustered: palavered and lied :
But BOMBA supported by soldier and priest,
Still joins the worst features of Bourbon and Beast-
Though we'd not use unamiable language."
First we sent Lord Soft-Sawder, so balmy and bland,
But Bomba trumped all the court cards in his hand.
Next we tried on His Excellence Virtuous Indig. ;
But BOMBA sans façon, floored that mouthing prig:
In not the most “amiable language."
Pale Fear made an effort to get at his
But by Austrian bay'nets 'twas met, front and rear;
Stern Conscience attempted to whisper "Beware!'
But the chaunt of the mass-priests swelled loud on the air,
And drowned his "unamiable language.”
Now Civis Romanus is nothing, again,
And GLADSTONE bas laid dowu the pamphleteer's pen,
And Fear is shut out by the Austrian steel,
And Conscience lies crushed 'neath the priest's sandalled heel :
And there's nought but most "amiable language."
King BOMBA can do what he likes with his own,
Can laugh at the dangers that threaten his throne,
Scourge, fetter, and slay, at his absolute will
(Though volcano and earthquake, un-courtier-like still,
Will indulge in "unamiable language.")
Now's the time for that long, strong, and all-at-once pull,
Which best suits that rudest of mortals, Joan BULL,
And-diplomacy banished--an opening is given,
To let loose the long-hoarded vengeance of Heaven.
(Excuse such “unamiable language.”)
One ambassador 's left us at Naples to quarter,
Lord Sixty-eight-pounder and suite-Shell and Mortar:
Theirs the tongue that to BOMBA's perceptions can speak,
Where Truth, Right, and Conscience discourse heathen Greek-
And get snubbed for "unamiable language.”
For each groan of our countrymen, maddened by wrong,
Let our guns find an echo, sublime, loud, and long :
For each stroke of their lash, and each clank of their chain,
Let those stern iron lips lift a voice prompt and plain,
Though they mayn't use quite" amiable language.”
Through the dungeons, where victims of tyranny groan;
Through the palace, that opens to flatterers alone :
Through the courts, where foul Wrong usurps Justice's rod;
Through the temples, where mass-chaunting priests bemock God,
Thunder, guns, in "unamiable language !”
Thunder guns, till crowned tyranny cow's at your word:
Too long, mighty guns, has your voice been unheard.
Was there e'er man or moment that called you—I trow,
The man is at Naples, the moment is now
For your clear, if not "amiable language.”

A Barrister sat upon Quarter day,
As if to show us their sunny locks,
Mending a pen at his ease.
“Why dream I of married bliss ?
And tempt us to come and talk.'

No title to her smiles,
To watch the blush on their cheeks,
Because I've an empty purse:
The light in their liquid eyes.
“Wait, wait, wait,
Oh! why should money a blessing earn,
Oh! but for one short hour,
In the spring when violets blow,
And Poverty-a curse !
To whisper a word of love;
And wait, wait, wait,
To forget for a moment my wretched fate,
In December's frost and snow.
“Wait, wait, wait,
And the dreary prison above!
It's Oh! to be a snob,
My patience is all in vain;
From gentility's cares afar,
And what are its wages ? nothing to do,
“Oh! for a single hour!
To rise and fall with the ill-bred mob,
And nothing at all to gain.
A respite however short!
If this is to be at the bar!
This dingy gown, this barbarous wig, Only a walk on the grass below,
That only disfigures one's hair ;
Or a friendly chat in the Court !
A gentleman's rank: and as to the bank,
A walk by the river would ease my heart,
“Wait, wait, wait,
From nine o'clock till live";

But in my lonely grief
Here must I stay, lest the world should

Notably it is present in a high degree in three species at least, of
power of the human animal-speech.
the second, or Subbrachial group of the Malacopterygii, which, as is
well known to the Association, includes the flat-fishes—sole, flounder,
turbot, plaice, &c.
A sudden and sharp application of the common sole, for example, to
the os coccygis or to the gluteus murimus muscle of the human subject,
is followed by a most smart and sensible shock, often driving the
subject of the experiment out of a room, and even down-stairs.
But this power in the sole is confined, apparently, to the nerves of
motion : the volition of the persons operated on as above described
did not seem to be affected. They moved because they could not
help it.
The common flounder seems to operate on the nerves of volition as
well, and its effects are particularly visible in connection with the
nerves and muscles of speech. We have all had frequent opportunities
of witnessing these effects, in a very painful form, among public and
after-dinner speakers. Such persons, under the influence of the
flounder, seem to lose the thread of their discourse, stammer, hesitate,
cough, twiddle their hands, shift their posture uneasily, and finally, if
the operation of the flounder is prolonged, sit down abruptly. But the
influences of the sole and flounder, however distinct, are nothing in
comparison with those of the plaice.
I have recently had an opportunity, in common with many lothers,
of watching the benumbing powers of plaice, in a very conspicuous
instance. The subject of the experiments, Mr. B-RN-1 OSB-RNE,
is a middle-aged man, stout in build, of a dark complexion, and a
sanguineo-nervous temperament, particularly lively and off-hand in
conversation, quite destitute of nervousness or veneration, and what
many would describe as overbearing in manner. The experiments
were continued over a period of three years. MR. B. O. submitted
himself to them voluntarily, and after repeatedly defying the influence.
The plaice selected for the purpose of the experiments was a small

ST. JAMES'S HALL AND COMPANY.
ST. JAMES's Hall opened the other evening, by several
doors, having been provided with ample means of ingress
and egress, so that the public will be enabled to walk into
it with ease, and to escape from it with expedition in case
it should ever catch fire. That this new music-ball should
be burnt down, however, would be lamentable; for it is
really a magnificent one; vast in dimensions, elegant in
proportions, splendid in decoration. Its opening took
place with a concert; when, according to our fashionable
contemporary :-
“It was honoured by the presence of H. R.H. the PRINCE CONSORT,
a large number of our aristocracy, and a very numerous general com-
pany, belonging for the most part to the better classes of society."
The word “better” in the above passage appears to be
used in its primary sense, and not as merely meaning
better dressed and better off. For, in the next sentence,
we are informed that :-
" The grand inaugurative Concert, got up under the able direction
of Mr. BENEDICT, was of a sacred character, and devoted entirely to a
charitable purpose."
By the better classes to which belonged those persons
who, conjointly with the PRINCE CONSORT and a number of
the aristocracy, honoured St. James's Hall, we are there-
fore to understand the more devout and charitable portion
of the public. To exercise charity in going to hear sacred
music is to do the sort of thing that might be expected of
those classes, wbich excel the rest of the community in
goodness, and may therefore accurately be styled better.
Such people also may, perhaps, without entire absurdity,
be said to honour bricks and mortar with their presence.

simply to the fact, that MR. BULL opposes his

much. It could hardly vituperate him more. If
he were to roast a Jesuit or two alive, and
stretch a few Oratorians on the rack, he would

THESE THINGS ARE AN ALLEGORY.
In the Adventures of a Jack-of-all-Trades, included in
MR. CHARLES READE's last very amusing volume, pub-
lished under the eccentric title-Cream, that ingenious
author has allegorised the present position of the Cabinet,
under the transparent veil of the misadventures, trials,
terrors, and crowning disappointment, of the man who
travelled with an Elephant.
The least learned in the political history of the day will
at once recognise in the daring Mr. Loett, Jack-of-all-Trades
and Master of none, our present dashing PREMIER, with his
happy-go-lucky. temperament, his readiness to change
masters, and liveries, his turn for speechifying, and his
happy knack of dazzling the country by a grand turn-out,
and a lavish display of posters. Nor less recognisable-

A COMICAL SUGGESTION.
A GOOD joke appeared the other day in the Post, communicated by a
Correspondent in a letter on the subject of Church Extension, for
which object he makes the following droll proposal :-
“Methinks a sort of rent-charge, in the form of a small per-centage upon the rent
of bouses and shops in the towns in which trade and manufactures congregate the
human beings they call into existence, upon the estimated interest of the capital
invested by the manufacturer in his machinery, as analogous to the husbandman's
farm, would fully auswer the purpose, and would moreover increase with the
increasing need."
Methinks-the gentle reader will probably exclaim--methinks I see
some serious member of the House of Commons rise and move for
leave to bring in a Bill, having for its object
, the imposition of the
Church-tax above recommended, and methinks I hear the roars of
laughter with which he would be greeted on all sides of the House.
Methinks I see MR. BRIGHT shaking his sides with guffaws, the tears
of fun coursing one another down the cheeks of Mr. BOWIER, and
MR. ROEBUCK on his back kicking in convulsions of glee.
Unhappily the first of April occurred in Passion week, during the red flames, crowns of glory, dark projections from the rim of the

And a jolly young butcher am I;
I cuts from the prime,
And I sends home in time,
And my joints they are never too high.

And the public's delighted to buy;

On my legs and my loins,
And they praises their dinner sky-high.

And friends I hope we'll ever be.
When halcyon days no more are bright,
And dreams of joy in sorrow end,
Send round to me, by day or night,
The Doctor is your constant Friend.
The world is but a gilded Pill,
The breeze of fame a sweetened draught,
And when they fail you, as they will,
You'll know what hollow spells you've quaffed.
But in the hour of grief and blight,
When darkest visions near thee blend,
Send round for me, by day or night,
The Doctor is your constant Friend.

consequence of the interest taken in that of India. On this principle
LORD JOHN should pull down LORD NELSON from the Trafalgar
Square column, and run up the HAVELOCK statue there. But we
concur in the impropriety of changing the old name of Westminster

MONUMENTAL NOMENCLATURE.
SIR W. FRASER, in the House of Commons, asked LORD JOHN
MANNERS whether there was any objection to the bridge about to be
erected over the Thames next above Waterloo-bridge being called
Sebastopol-bridge. There is one-in addition to the objections which
LORD JOHN mentioned. A siege or a battle is a horrible necessity
imposed upon us by our enemies. They oblige us to take the trouble
and accept the danger of destroying their strongholds and themselves :
a glorious work for our soldiers and sailors because it is dangerous,
and to ourselves because it is expensive. Battles and sieges are whole-
sale executions; but the personal risk to which the combatants are
exposed makes some difference between those on the wrong side and
brigands, and a vast difference between those on the right side and
hangmen. Glory to our heroes for their courage and self-sacrifice
glory to the tax payer : glory for ever ; but otherwise no glory! If
we wish to perpetuate the memory of our victories, which may be
desirable for the admonition of our enemies, let us give the names

JOHN BRIGHT, as a stripling, was a general favourite, though he
made but a poor return for the affection that was showered on him by
all bands, for he was always fighting. There was not a boy in the
whole school-and they numbered some 250—but he had fought more
than once with. One day his parents (worthy Quakers of the most
peaceful persuasion) called to see their darling son, but he was not to

though the viands were none of the choicest; and what fun, though
there was a scarcity of knives and forks, and slates often had to do
duty for plates! Young GEORGE, when the currant wine was sent
round, used to stand up and make speeches, just as at a charity dinner.
He would give the “Church,” the “Army and Navy,” and all the
other " loyal and patriotic toasts." He used to return thanks for the

THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.
(Being the Lamentable History of one, Little
Bill and his Brother.)
Now ponder well my public, deare,
The wordes which I shall write;
A doleful story you shall beare,
In rhyme brought forth to light.
An aged gentleman kept shoppe
In Lead'nball Street of late,
Who long in India had dwelte,
And there held large estate.
Sore sicke he was and like to dye,
No helpe his life could save:
So struggling sore, John COMPANIE,
Addressed him for the grave.
No love, or little at the moste,
JOHN Bull and him did binde;
For gain he lived, in feud he dyed,
And left two Babes behinde.
The one was called Bill number one,
Not passing three weekes olde;
The other was Bill number two;
A babe queint to beholde.
The guardians of the elder Bill,
As plainly did appeare,
Would pickings have from the estate
Of millions a yeare.
So from the other Babe much gain,
In land, and place, and gold,
Should fall to whoso it did guide,
By council uncontrolled.
But if both Babes should chance to dye,
Ere they to age should ronne,
Their uncle, RUSSELL, must step in,
By law of number one.
“JOAN RUSSELL," said the dying man,
“If all be true 1 heare,
Few friends hath small Bill number one,

A Popish gentleman, named Swift, bas been writing angrily to the
Papers, with complaints that the assassin GIOVANNI LANI, executed
last week, had been made the subject of Protestant attempts at con-
version. This MR. SWIFT considers a wicked persecution. All that
seems to have been done was to place a Bible in the man's cell, with a
Tract or two, except that a couple of religious ladies paid him one
visit, but as they could not speak a word of any language he spoke,
they could not have perverted his mind much. This, however, incenses
the furious SWIFT, who will not be appeased by the statement that the
authorities did at first not know Lani's religion, but that when they
learned it, they allowed priests of his own faith to come to him. SWIFT
says they ought to have kpown, and did know. We agree with
Swift that there was prima facie evidence, in the whole of LANI'S
conduct, that he was influenced by Catholic principles, and therefore
the authorities were to blame. A man desiring to emigrate, has a
good object, but a man who, not having money enough for this, robs
and kills a fellow creature to obtain it, “does evil that good may
come,” as to which practice being strictly Catholic, read Pascal.
Thus a man'who makes a false confession in the hope of saving his life,
and then makes a true one in the hope of saving his soul, is evidently
deeply imbued with the spirit of Popery. We think Newgate owes
every apology to Rome, and the only extenuation we can suggest is,
that Protestantism can hardly be seriously suspected of desiring such
an acquisition as M. LANI, to whom the Lady of the Hills is as heartily
welcome as she is to nine-tenths of her other martyrs and confessors.

THE BALLAD OF POPPETINA.
(Respectfully Dedicated to the Author of the Ballad of " Oriana.")
“ £1 Reward. Lost, from No. 7, Carlton Terrace, a little Pug Dog; answers to the name of POPPETINA; no further reward will be offered."-Advertisement
published in the Times last week, and extensively placarded in the neighbourhood of the Duke of York's Column.
My heart is wasted with my woe,
With whiskers large and talk so small, And tail of triple curl unique,
POPPETINA.
POPPETINA ?
POPPETINA!
No other pet I e'er can know,
With muzzle black, and ears a-peak,
POPPETINA.
Which when I fondly used to tweak,
You slipped out, past her careless side,
POPPETINA,
Though Regent Street dog-merchants show
POPPETINA;
Dear tiny things as white as snow,
Flung yourself on the streets, so wide,
How sharp and sudden was thy squeak,
POPFETINA!
POPPETINA,
POPPETINA;
The purchase I'll for thee forego-
Upon the London streets so wide,
I cry all day: I spoil my eyes :
POPPETINA.
And got picked up, my pet, my pride,
POPPETINA.
POPPETINA!
As the light on dark was growing,
And in the Times I advertise;
Picked up, my pug, my pet, my pride!
POPPETINA,
POPPETINA.
POPPETINA!
The St. James's cows were lowing,
Bill-stickers I employ likewise;
POPPETINA.
Where hoardings, and dead walls arise,
Costermongers round were going,
Some hideous wretch, with hardened face,
POPPETINA,
Calling Spring flowers "all a-growing,"
POPPETINA,
Men read thy name, thy shape, thy size,
Had watched you, beauty of your race,
POPPETINA!
“ All a-growing, all a-blowing,"
POPPETINA;
POPPETINA.
First lured you to his coarse embrace,
The vile dog-stealer's tricks I know,
Then plunged you in his pocket's space,
POPPETINA!
In my boudoir, warm and bright,
POPPETINA,
Already may have fall’n the blow,
POPPETINA,
And I was left in cruel case,
POPPETINA!
You were wont to pass the night,
POPPETINA.
They may have thought my offer low,
POPPETINA.
And higher fancied I would go,
POPPETINA,
Within a house of osier tight,
They came and told me where I lay,
Upon a sheepskin footrug white,
And slain thee, that I did not so,
POPFETINA,
POPPETINA,
POPPETINA!
How that my pet had run away,
So snug you slept, my own delight,
POPPETINA.
Thy skin perhaps they'll send to me,
POPPETINA.
With but a feather (as they say)
POPPETINA!
Where were the maids, page, footmen-all-
You might have knocked me down that day, Memento mori sad of thee,

any transaction in which horses are conspicuous excites with quite
peculiar violence the propensity to cheer. What cheers attend the
great event at Epsom, and every similar event; and not only that, but
every carriage drawn by four horses, and conveying people to see the
event! How heartily the crowd cheers each "drag" that passes them
on the road! There is something very pleasing in this; in particular,
because it shows an absence of that malevolent feeling of envy, and,
on the contrary, a disposition to rejoice in the happiness of others.
The crowd cannot go to the Derby itself, even in donkey-carts, it is
probably hungry, certainly thirsty, and it knows that the drag contains
an immense quantity of cold meat, chicken, lobster-salad, bread, butter,
cheese, champagne, and, what is more tantalizing to itself, beer. Yet
it cheers the vehicle, with its contents and their destined consumers.
How unlike some crowds that could be mentioned !-how different
from a Socialist or Communist mob!

lexcitement, that late in the day LORD JOHN RUSSELL, for the first time
in bis life, vainly attempted to pronounce the words Brish Constushon ;
that MR. GLADSTONE, as a Peelite, saw two if not three Courses
before him; and that SIR JOHN PAKINGTON nade abusive remarks

Villiams's subsequent and elegant dancing at Cremorne was the
theme of universal admiration.
Thursday. The CARDWELL Censure debate was resumed, and there
was some good speaking. MR. JOHN Bright came out with some
home truths, and explained in the frankest manner to the Cambridge
House party that he knew they wanted office, but that he should try
to keep them out, because the Tories were at once more civil and more
squeezable. LORD BURY, a young gentleman of five or six and twenty,
who is the son of LORD ALBEMARLE, and is facetiously alleged to
represent Norwich, brought out the distinct admission that what his
friends desired was to expel LORD DERBY, a piece of indiscretion for
which he was no doubt severely wigged at Brooks's. SIR JAMES
GRAHAM walked into the opposition in one of his crushing and biting
speeches, and SIR RICHARD BETHELL (“the learned knight,” as Mr.
DISRAELI, preferring the word Knight to the word gentleman, calls
him) tried to be specially insulting to the Ministers, and was by no
means unsuccessful.
But a sudden termination to the fray was at hand. That day there
arrived, from India, despatches of no small value. They showed that
LORD CANNING's celebrated proclamation had been sent to the Chief
Commissioner of Oude, Sir JAMES OUTRAM, who had commented upon
it, almost in LORD ELLENBOROUGH's words, that it meant confiscation.
They showed that LORD CANNING had considered this, had ordered
every copy of his proclamation to be carefully destroyed, and had
issued another, of a similar general nature, but including an ample
promise of restitution to all who should pay homage to the QUEEN.
Next day these papers were in all hands, and it was felt that the
Office-hunters must seek another hunting ground.

streets, but as he crossed Palace Yard this afternoon he was heard to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TRIBULATIONS OF W. B.
(Apropos of the Derby doings of 1858.)
Run second ? What–our Gur'nor? Well, That there Caucasian Arab, too-
Ow could he run to vin ?
Call that an 'oss to win!
Of all the stables ever vos-
Leastways, all I've been in-
Dear, dear! the colts, the two-year-olds,
I never see a stable yet
That in my days I've seed,
(I says the thing with pain)
By Protection out of Statu quo,
As looks less like the stable
Wich that's my fancy breed;
A Derby 'Oss to train.
Good, solid, well-plucked 'osses,
As could make a waitin' race;
It comes uncommon 'ard on me,
That you know'd where you could ’ave em,
As have know'd the days gone by,
If they ad more bone than pace-
When we sported the old colours,
And warn't up to fightin' shy.
Not like the leggy, lathy brutes,
When we'd sperrits above crosses,
Like 'urdles tall and thin,
Took what odds was to be got;
That's ent’red now for everythink,
When we hadn't no dark 'osses
But never runs to win
In all our Derby lot.
By Conceit, p'raps, out o' Progress,
Like that there Stanley colt;
When, if we 'ad a match to run,
One o' these days-you take my word
We ran it straight and square;
That 'oss 'll make a bolt.
When, if we'd entries for a race,
Scratch or forfeit warn't thought fair.
Then there's that Arab, Benjamin,
A Leg, in them days was a Leg,
As they makes sich fuss about,
And a Swell he was a Swell;
Blest if I see what he can do,
But wich is wich, in these ere times,
Unless it is let hout,
It's more than I can tell.
Wich I'll own a chap's ribs he can try,
(He did try old Bob Peel's),
How's folks to know who's who, wot's wot, And them as puts bis back up
With gents as tries such jobbins on ?
'Ad better mind his 'eels.
You've a bet booked with SIR ROBERT
What's the odds it ain't F. ROBINSON ? But if it comes to runnin',
Then, a nob his stable colours
Just you show me wot he's done,
Would no more a-changed than flew That the Guvn'r should be sweet on 'im,
But now all coats seems all the same,
And put him number vun?
Ony no vun sports true-blue.
He's a showy 'oss, I grant yer,
But I'm blest if he ain't slow,
I little thought to see the day
And an 'ard-mouthed brute, to keep him
The good old “ Tory” blood,
straight,
That bred so many winners,
As hever was no-go.
Should go out in our stud.
To see the old “Tory” strain go out, There's many cracks up Pakington,
And the new “Rad” stock come in!
And his performance brags,
And he do look more like runnin'
Than most oth' Guy'nor's nags;
And it's true he is long-winded,
Gits more fresh the more he goes,
Still he ain't my figure of an 'oss,
Too much 'ead and too much nose.
No, bless your 'eart, we're out o’luck,
There's Tox run a bad second,
And there's The Elephant besides,
On whom the stable reckoned,
Fust favourite for the Ingy Stakes,
He've gone and broken down,-
Such a race too! Why MUSTER BULL
On it 'ad laid a crown!
I know you 'll say the stakes is drawid
For this here famous match.
Twixt LORD CANNING's Proclamation,
And LORD ELLENB'ROUGH's Despatch.
But things has reached a precious pass,
Now this here game's begun,
Of tabling stakes, that must be draw'd,
'Acos they can't be won.
Now there's SIR JOSEPH ’AWLEY, he
Desarves to make his tin,
Of his two osses he declares
With which he means to win.
But when our Guv'nor enters
Tory and Rad and all-
'Cos he can't win with one oss,
Vy, he tries to win with all.
Now, I've seed a deal of stables,
And this is wot I've found,
Twixt two stools, or two osses,
Folks is apt to come to ground,
But I'm past my work, they tells me,
And there's nobody minds me-
When it comes, you say I said it
Wich my name's W. B-

this, though perhaps it was unnecessary, as no one in his senses would
believe that important duties could be entrusted to such a person as
the prisoner evidently was.
Mr. Bright said that the magistrate's inference, from the appearance
and tone of the prisoner, was perfectlv logical, but he regretted to say
that mankind were not governed by the rules of logic, and the man
Smith bad, there was no reason to doubt, been allowed to rush into
places where an angel might fear to tread. No answer to the charge
has been offered.
The prisoner attempted to renew his allegation, that he had been a
person in authority, but was finally prevailed on by his solicitor to
plead that he had suppressed, not purloined, the letter in question, at
the instance of an elderly party in whom he had much confidence.
MR. PUNCH. Who is this elderly party ?
The prisoner after fencing with the question, said that the party
lived in Piccadilly, but he was not quite sure about his name.
Mr. Punch. How does he get his living ?
The prisoner. He holds bottles.
MR. Punch. Bottles, man, what nonsense are you talking there?
Do you mean horses?
The prisoner gave a vacant kind of smile, but adhered to his state-
ment about the bottles.
Mr. Bright said that the affectation of foolishness was very natural,
but the trick was transparent. That the prisoner had an accomplice
there was no doubt, and ihe man was called Piccadilly Pam.
MR. Punch. Is he in custody ?
Mr. Bright. No, your worship, he is at present out. But I believe
him to be engaged in a job which will shortly bring him under your
worship's unfavourable notice.
Mr. Granville said that nothing could be more unfair than this
attempt to prejudice the magistrate against a person not within his
jurisdiction.
MR. Punch. No person is beyond that. But I am not in the habit
of allowing myself to be prejudiced. Go on with the case.
Mr. Granville then, in an eloquent speech, urged that his client,
who was not a person of strong mind, had in an evil hour been induced
by the counsels of an unscrupulous friend to purloin the letter, in the
hope of annoying the witness, Elephant, who had been betrayed into a
trap, and was no doubt, vindictive, especially as it had led to his being
turned out of a good situation. But there was an entire absence of
interested motives, for the letter could be of no use to his client, who, if
he could read it, could not understand it. Ample precaution would be
taken that the prisoner should never have another opportunity of com-
mitting such an error, and he hoped the magistrate would take an

twenty converts have in all been made, and that at an expense of less

contrast.
Among the musical conversions achieved by the Society, there are
reported several most interesting cases, which we regret our want of

In the Commons our friend Pam, by no means satisfied with our

upon BENJAMIN, declaring that the late Ministry had not nearly
got into war with France, had not tried to embroil the Sar-
dines in Neapolitan macaroni, had not advocated massacre
in India, and had not acted like a Cabal. Also he taunted Mr. Dis-
RAELI with having written articles in the Press newspaper, in order to
help himself up in the world. [By the way, this last charge was not
befitting Pam, and Punch has written to MR. Panizzi for a copy of
a certain work called the New Whig Guide, whereof more anon.]
BENJAMIN was armed and ready, and dashed at Pam with much
pluck, likening himself to M. DE PÈNE, who, having defeated one
enemy, was immediately set upon by another of terrible reputation, an
illustration more pungent than proper, considering circumstances ; but
then the Examiner newspaper had just likened Ben bimself to SPOLLEN,
the Irishman who was not hanged for murdering MR. LITTLE, so that
the Whigs had given BEN provocation to use hard words. He rather

DIZZINESS AFTER DINNER.
SHALL I give you the true explanation
Of DISRAELI's strange language at Slough,
Which has called forth so much indignation,
And caused such a deuce of a row
?
Strange that no one has managed to guess it,
So plain on the surface it lies;
But of course our friend BEN won't confess it,
For 'tis what a man always denies.
But there—we have all of us been so,
And we know what it is very well;
Pitt and Fox were both frequently seen so,
As you've heard some old gentleman tell.
Take no sbame for the love of a beaker!
What used all our great statesmen to do?
And DUNDAs said: "I can't see the speaker,"
And the other said: "I can see two."
BEN's oration was made after dining
With farmers—and who could expect
But that, words to facts not quite confining,
,
Oh, how plain is the case when 'tis pondered!
To the dullest perception how clear!
And who is there whose speech
has ne'er wandered
After drinking a great deal of beer?
OUR BREAD UPON THE WATERS.
THAT "coming events cast their shadows before” is generally
known; and it is almost as notorious that Mr. Punch usually espies
those shadows before anybody else. This latter circumstance is too
often ignored or overlooked. Witness a recent leader by Mr. Punch's
fashionable contemporary, on the impending moral and physical revo-
lution about to result from Chemistry. According to the Post,
Chemistry threatens to upset Political Economy, by enabling us to
make, out of the earth beneath our feet, the varieties of food and
clothing which we are now obliged to cultivate or import. This anti-
cipation is founded on a lecture lately delivered by PROFESSOR FRANK-
LAND, at the Royal Institution; a lecture showing how substances,
heretofore supposed capable of being produced only by living plants
and animals, can now be compounded out of the simple elements of
matter; so that "the food of man may be produced directly from its
original sources, without the intermediate agencies of vegetation and
animal life.”
In Mr. Punch's Pocket Book for 1855 you will find an article entitled
Vegetable Mutton, or Beef without a Butcher, wherein, after a statement
of the chemical formula of flesh, occurs the passage following:
“It does not follow that by putting water into a vessel, adding charcoal to it, and
pumping into it hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen gas in the above proportions, you
can make a quantity of meat, even if you galvanize the mixture; but perhaps the
discovery of some agent yet more subtle than electricity may one of these days
enable us to compound venison itself out of air, water, and cinders."
The article then goes on to show how, by commingling the proxi-
mate or immediate constituents of flesh, it may soon be quite possible
to make meat; and illustrates this statement by a prescription for a
leg of mutton. But the speculations based on the lecture of PROFESSOR
FRANKLAND are clearly forestalled in the above preconception of the
idea of compounding venison. Mark, especially, the specification of
"cinders.” According to PROFESSOR FRANKLAND, the particular
source out of which organic substances have been chiefly formed of
late is coal. The Morning Post thus remarks on the possibility of
substituting coal for corn :-
"Coal presents us with all the materials for making the best of bread; and when
we consider what the chemist has already done with coal, it need not excite sur-
prise that he should knead it into the staff of life."
If out of coal we can get bread as well as meat, the whole of our
necessary food will be comprehended in coal. Since from coal, more-
over, may be extracted most or all of our fruit flavours, wine-flavours,
and perfumes, coal will also include no small proportion of our
luxuries. Our creature comforts will resolve themselves into fuel, and
all we shall require will be to be duly stoked. But all these brilliant
prospects were intimated three years ago by the philosophy of
Mr. Punch.
It is, certainly, very often that we blow our own trumpet, but we
are continually compelled to do so by the forgetfulness of our just
claims which other people are always evincing, and by that strong and
supreme sense of justice which will never suffer us to forget or forego
what is due to ourselves.

and some expressed a hint that he would burst his boiler. On being
charged with reckless driving and disregard of orders, BENDIZZY at
once assumed an air of coolest nonchalance, and could not be brought
to show contrition for his carelessness. When pulled up by Inspectors
PALMERSTON and RUSSELL, he remarked, with much bravado, that "it
was all serene," and that he“ didn't care a rap” for their raps upon
his knuckles.
We think there is no doubt that he exceeded his instructions, but of
course as his employers cannot well do without him, they have done
their best to hush the matter up. They have indeed gone so far as to
acquit him of all fault, and to signify official commendation of his
conduct; but this is only following the stereotyped routine that "no
blame attaches to the servants of the Company. The only feasible
excuse that in our view can be made for him is, that the train which he
was driving was started after dinner, and it therefore cannot be much
wondered at if he did not see his way clearly. We have said that
nothing serious resulted from the accident, and it is thought that on
the whole BENDIZZY got well out of it. The facts were, however, dis-
located terribly, and the features of the case were so thoroughly
distorted as scarcely to be recognised by those who were acquainted
with them.

CHIVALRY AT COVENTRY.
In describing the progress of the QUEEN from Coventry
to Stoneleigh Abbey, and just after having related how she
received the address of the Mayor and Corporation, the
PEC Top POLKA
Morning Post's own Reporter, soaring from the language
of simple narrative into that of romance, says that:-
“ LORD LEICH now threw himself into his saddle, and galloped off
in advance of HER MAJESTY's carriage."
Somehow the description of LORD LEIGH mounting his
horse, by throwing himself, that is, by leaping into, his
saddle, presents that nobleman to the mind's eye in a
rather comical point of view. The act of throwing oneself
into, on, or at, anything, is a motion of impulse and
excitement. To throw, in this sense, is, according to
JOHNSON, “to lay carelessly or in haste;" as :-
" His Majesty departed to his chamber, and threw himself upon his
bed, lamenting with much passion and abundance of tears, the loss of
an excellent servant.-CLARENDON."
Several eminent fashionable novelists have also said :-
“He threw himself into his cab, and dashed off to the Opera."
There is a certain recklessness and self-abandonment in
that abrupt, and rapid transition from one place to another
which is effected by throwing oneself. This impetuous
manner of traversing space is natural and becoming in
a moment of agitation, but appears slightly incongruous
with the solemnity of a state occasion. Hence the idea
of LORD Leigh throwing himself into his saddle, forces a
smile. This feat of agility was performed by the noble
lord immediately upon the delivery of the address of the
MAYOR and Corporation of Coventry, to the formality of
which ceremony it must have exhibited a diverting contrast.
How many stone LORD LEIGü rides we do not know,
though no doubt our sporting contemporary does; but the
amusement which his Lordship afforded the beholders by
throwing himself into his saddle must have borne a direct
ratio to his weight.
