A NEW CHAPTER OF AL KORAN. INTITULED, THE RAIMENT. REVEALED TO THE PROPHET
PUNCH, IN THE STREET WHICH IS CALLED FLEET.
IN THE NAME OF THE PROPHET-PETTICOATS !
A
ND there came unto me a vision, which was perspicuous, yea, and profitable. And behold a maiden,
dusky, but lovely as the summer night when the moon hideth her face and the silver stars come forth
like diamonds in the crown of a King. Her form, modestly but lightly attired, was graceful as is that of
the gazelle, or of the emerald virgin, Norah, whose gown is sung by the Western poet, TIMOur. Her name
was INDIA.
And there were sounds of rejoicing and gratulation, and thunder of cannons, and rushing
of rockets, and banging of squibs, and cracking of crackers, and blazing of lights. Lo, it was the first
day of the eleventh month, and Asia shouted and said, VICTORIA, even the Queen of the Isles, is now
our Empress, and her glory shall be uplifted. And I said, It is well, I, even I, Punch, did this thing
for her. Then I saw in my vision, that to the sweet maiden, India, as she stood in her soft beauty,
there came a fair sister, fairer than she, and her look was as that of a woman who is not afraid to look upon
the face of a man, or to smack the same if need be, or none. Upon her head was a helmet, and behold
her skirts stuck out like unto the hoops of old, and as she came, men stood aside to make a wide path
for her, and some, stricken by the hem of her garments, rubbed their ancles, as in pain. Nevertheless
all admired her, for she was comely, and the robe gave her a goodly Presence. Then I, Punca, marked
the end, which whoso marketh in wisdom shall make his mark in the days. And I knew the name of

the beautiful stranger, and that it meant Land of the Painted Men. For her naked forefathers painted
themselves blue. And she came, sweetly smiling, unto the maiden, India, and kissed her, and said,
Henceforth we are sisters indeed, daughters of the same mother. And India kissed her, and I, PUNCI,
envied each in turn. Then said the Land of the Painted Men, even BRITANNIA, Lo, I have brought
thee a present, my charmed garb, wherewith I vanquish and conquer. Place it, I pray thee, upon thee,
that it may conceal thy beautiful form, but may show forth the glory of the silkworm, and of the weaver,
and of the milliner, and of the lady's maid. It will make thee glorious to behold. Is it not called Crinoline ?
And the sweet maiden, even India, was allured by the enticing words of BRITANNIA, and with the thing
which she brought, even as it were a coop of hoops and bars, did the gracious India invest herself, saying,
Lo, now am I too, civilised. And they would have kissed one another again, but could no longer
approach by reason of the garments. Then I, even I, Punch, stood forward, and I said unto the sweet
maiden, INDIA, Truly thou hast arrayed thyself in the raiment of vanity and extravagance, nevertheless,
it is fit that beauty do as she will. Howbeit, that thou mayst not wholly be carried away by folly, here
is a casket of magic diamonds which thou must daily look upon, and they will sparkle forth to thee
teachings and lessons which shall make thee the glory of Asia even as they make thy sister the glory of
Europe. And the maiden said, My Lord is all goodness. And I, even I, PUNCH, did present her with my

opened as usual, was very cold. Montagnes Russes were erected on
the Serpentine. The Thames was frozen over, and the atmosphere
became really bearable. For some weeks the House was almost full,
and business progressed cheerily. This went on uutil Easter.
Returning after the holidays, we found matters changed much for
the worse. April set in close and muggy Noisome vapours rose from
the tepid waters. The House rapidly thinned. Night after night we
saw fresh gaps on the benches, and missed familiar faces. Each day
the Morning Post recorded the departure of three, four, or half a
dozen dear and honourable members for Wales, the Highlands, the
Alps, or some other remote and elevated region. After a while, in
order to assuage the public anxiety, means were taken to prevent these
melancholy announcements. Henceforth, when we saw fresh vacancies,
even behind the Treasury bench, no one ventured to notice the
circumstance.
A resolution was now passed allowing members to smoke even in
the House itself. The aroma of tobacco was supposed to be a disin-
fectant: it was at any rate a consolation.
Whitsuntide passed. May was hot. Jane hotter. Thermometer
92° in the shade. The state of the river and House indescribable.
A complete panic now set in. It was a regular sauve qui peut. In one
week forty-five members applied for the Chiltern Hundreds. During the
next sennight the number rose to ninety-seven. Every evening a dozen
or twenty writs were moved to fill up vacancies. New elections were
proceeding over the whole country with some curious characteristics.
No candidates appeared, but the friends of every influential personage
in each locality nominated his best enemy. The Whig magnate pro-
posed a Tory, and the Tory a Whig. At the poll, Yellows voted for
the Blue nominee, and Blues for the Yellow. The scenes that occurred
when the unfortunate victims took leave of their families were heart-
rending: some, instead of obeying, escaped into foreign lands, beyond
reach of a Speaker's warrant; others hid away, or wandered 'forth, in
strange disguises. A son of 'the DUKE OF RUTLAND was traced into
Lincolnshire, and found dressed and serving as one of his father's
gamekeepers. He was brought to the table, and sworn in between

THE QUEEN ON THE RIVER.
What sight was that which loyal eyes
Beheld with horror-not surprise-
On Thames's filthy tide,
Which bore VICTORIA, England's QUEEN,
Who, down the River having been,
And the Leviathan ship seen,
Back to her Palace hied?
Familiar with that River's smell
Who
cannot fancy, all too well,
The odour which prevailed,
Which rose from the polluted stream
As thick, but not so white, as cream,
And in a suffocating steam,
The Royal sense assailed ?
How shall I state what thousands saw,
Indignant, yet oppressed with awe,
Their blood which well-nigh froze ?
The River's perfume was so vile,
The SOVEREIGN, as she neared Dogs' Isle,
Was fain to hold—nay do not smile
A bouquet to her nose !
Where will the Constitution go,
If sewage shall much longer flow,
Thy banks, old Thames, between ?

And hast not spared the QUEEN !

ENCOURAGEMENT OF PESTILENCE.
The battle is as to who shall pay for the puri-
fication of the Thames. The country objects,
and we are afraid, that some fine pestilential
morning, Father Thames will make a forcible
appeal to the feelings of Englishmen, and throw
himself regularly upon the country in the shape
of Cholera. It is said that the sewage of the
Thames is a sure, safe, and tid(e)y fortune, but
apparently no one likes to draw upon its banks.
In the meantime, the miasma continues. The
Pestilence may knock, with its plague-cart, at
our doors to-morrow, and demand a heavy pole-
tax of every living person. It will be too late,
then, to stand higgling-haggling about the exact
rate of payment per head of this pestilential tax.
When the evil is at our thresholds, we shall
regret doubtlessly that we allowed the accumu-
lation of filth at the bottom of the river to be
the only settlement of this question. In the
meantime, so long as this pernicious squabble
continues, Vive le Cholera ! Our only fear is,
that its creed will not altogether be " Live,
and Let Live."

THE word of command most familiar to the

“NON REDOLET SED OLET, NEC
REDOLERE SOLET."
Both in Parliament and out of it a good deal
bas been said of the Conservancy of the Thames.
Unsavoury as it may be, the subject has been
lately in everybody's mouth. But although
public speakers, not less indeed than private
ones, have done their utmost seemingly to ex-
haust the fertile topic, a remark still remains
wbich (so far as we're aware) has not as yet
been made on it. In fact, unless the truth be
sacrificed, the observation we allude to cannot
possibly be uttered. It is as clear as its own
mud that, while the River-sewer Thames is suf-
fered, as it now is, to continue in bad odour,
its conservancy at any rate can never truthfully
be spoken of as a conserve of roses.

Quoth Sir Pot: "For your late K.C.B.s,

For washing's a process agrees
With such knights as that wretch JUNG BAHAWDER,
Though to wash such a blackamoor white,
If even your Bath, Sir, be equal,
Is a problem (you'll own I am right)
Which has yet to be solved by the sequel."
Quoth Sir KETTLE: "I own it was rash,
To blow out the brains of his cousins;
To settle th’avuncular bash,
And shoot down his rivals by dozens ;
But if you cast up my BAHAWDER,
Why on your own list should be found
ABDUL MEDJID, -to drop all soft sawder-
That servant of heathen MAHOUND ?”
Quoth Sir Pot : " But just look at your host

Famed, betwixt you and me and the Post,
For nought but their blund'ring vagaries.
I'll fling you DUNDAs in there with;
The whole four will make up a poor HECTOR;
And what do you say to A. SMITH,

Quoth SIR KETTLE: "Don't cast up to me!

Thx Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench is a judge
whose remarks are usually judicious. At the late Norfolk Assizes,
however, the noble and learned lord made an observation, an obiter
dictum, not perhaps characterized by his usual shrewdness. GEORGE
Bates, aged 34, was indicted for stealing a certain thing, the property
of GEORGE NEWENS, under-bailiff to BARON ROTHSCHILD. During a
fire which happened at Newens's house, Bates bad saved the thing in
question, but refused to surrender it unless he were paid ls. for his
services. He was acquitted of the charge of larceny; whereupon the
following opinion was pronounced by-
LORD CAMPBELL. I am sure that if BARON ROTHSCHILD had been present, he
would willingly have paid the sum."
Now the thing which had been saved from the fire, and for the
rescue of which 18. was demanded, was-what do you suppose ? A
ham. Does LORD CAMPBELL think, on consideration, that BARON
ROTHSCHILD could possibly have paid salvage for a ham? We cannot
conceive that the honourable Member for London would have con-
sented to make any such payment for any such purpose, when we con-
sider how long a conscientious scruple bas kept him from taking his
seat in Parliament, by deterring him from making a merely formal
profession, which many other honourable gentlemen do not besitate to
make without meaning it. BARON ROTHSCHILD, if in personal danger,
might be anxious to save his own bacon; but he can have no ham to
save, and to expect that he would pay for the preservation of his
bailiff's would be unreasonable.

UBJOINED is the conclusion
of a letter addressed to a
morning contemporary of
fashionable celebrity, and
views which may be ele-
gantly described as Haute
Église. The previous part
of the epistle consists of
insinuations of partiality,
injustice, and subservience
to vulgar prejudice, against
the BISHOP OF LONDON
for refusing to listen to
the special pleading of the
pseudo-Father Confessor,
MR. POOLE, and the cack-
ling of certain poisy indi-
viduals of his flock. The
remainder also indirectly
alludes to the Bishop.
“However supine his official
superiors might be, he would
not escape rebuke if Parliament
were sitting. Is there no one
in the House of Peers having
manliness enough to ventilate
this subject in the interests of
truth and justice ?
« Номо.”
" London, July 13."
The passages in the fore-
going sentences unneces-
sarily underlined should
be taken into account in translating the word “Homo.” That signature must not be received
as synonymous with Vir. It is to be understood to signify a human being, a mortal, an
individual, or, as Society says, a person. Homo is a substantive of common gender, and in
the present instance is evidently to be referred to the second sex. If there were any doubt
on this point, the fact that the particular word manliness-is underscored without being
rendered emphatic in the sense of an attribute, would conclusively settle it. “HOMO ” is
evidently a fair devotee of the Belgravian persuasion, determined to stand up like a woman
for ber parson, and the privilege of the private catechism of the confessional. We should
like to know how many yards of Crinoline "HOMO” is surrounded by during her devotions ;
how much space on a seat in St. Barnabas's Church is occupied by “ Homo's" petticoats.
Though, if " HOMO” is the better half of a Vir, or husband, it may be, and is, indeed, very
likely, that she has repudiated the last-mentioned garments, and wears the opposite sort
of things. Figuratively, at least, those things must needs be worn by that married lady who,
with the knowledge of her husband, goes to whisper everything she has to blush for, into
the ear of a reverend young gentleman, or even an old one.

He dined, inside the House, at seven;
In morning sittings he was fried;
Never was galley-slave so driven,
From morn to latest eventide :
And for what purpose thus he sat,
That member knew not, nor do I;
He never caught the Speaker's eye,
Nor once to speak clutched off bis hat;
He only said, " The House is dreary :
It doesn't pay
he said.
He said, “Of this life I am weary,
Better break stones instead.”

Upon the middle of the night,
Waking, be heard dark Dizzy crow,
And bandy compliments with BRIGHT;
From 'neatb the gang-way Ayrton's low
Came to him : without hope of change
In sleep he seemed to vote forlorn,
Till coldly looked the grey-eyed morn
Upon the Palace Yard cab-range.
He only said, “I'm very dreary :
Past two again," he said.
He said
To one so weary, aweary,
What is five hours in bed ?"
Near BARRY's stately terrace-wall
The Thames with blackened waters crept;
There, when the long debate did pall,
Time was that he had smoked or slept.
But now the odours drove away
The lustiest smoker : after dark,
No mild Havannah's fragrant spark
Upon the waters cast its ray.
He only said, “It's very dreary:
They won't adjourn,” he said.
He said, “I am aweary, aweary,
And can't get home to bed."
And ever when the tide was low,
And mud-banks drank the solar ray,
Within the lobbies came a flow
Of perfume, fraught with Thames bouquet.
And when the tide was very low,
And beyond bearing grew the smell,
Foul of the Boards of Works they fell,
And bullied Hall & THWAITES & Co.,
He only said, “It's dull and dreary:
It's very dull,” he said.
He said, “ I'm naturally cheery,
But all my fun has fled."

ROME AND CARTHAGE,
SUBJOINED, MR. JOHN Bull, you have another hiss and rattle from our sacerdotal and
serpentine contemporary, the Univers :
“The world will never recover substantial peace until England shall have become Roman Catholic, or shall
have ceased to be a first rate power.
With England no alliance is possible. The nations of the
earth ought, therefore, to come to an understanding, and hurl against her the famous sentence—'Delenda
est Carthago.'"
So, according to the Romish organ, England is the Carthage of modern Rome. Such
being the case, Carthage has a great advantage in knowing it, thanks to the Univers. The
Carthaginians will perbaps learn to keep a sharp look out after the Roman emissaries and
sympathizers, wbo would of course be only
too happy to facilitate the invasion of Carthage
by the nations of the earth which the Univers represents, if ever they should come to the
very Catholic understanding alluded to by that eminently Christian organ. Threatened men
live long; they are forwarned and consequently forearmed. The Carthaginians accordingly
will perhaps contrive to find a HANNIBAL, and more than one, who will at least give Rome
some trouble, and render her sentence for the destruction of Carthage less easily exacted
than pronounced.
The Giaour's Potion,
“May you eat dirt !” enraged Turks roar ;
The curse is nasty-vain you think it:
But as for dirt, when Thames you pour
Into your mouths, at least you drink it.
Daily, within the steaming House,
The member's public spirit leaked
Out at his pores; he thought of grouse--
Red-wattled, strong-winged, horny-beaked--
Coveys, from stubbles whirring out;
Old country houses oped their doors;
Old shooting ponies tramped the moors;
From the old pool leaped six-pound trout ;
Then said he, “If the fancy's cheery,
What is the fact?” he said.
He said " The House is very dreary,
And weighs on me like lead."
The blinding Budelights in the roof,
The slow clock ticking, and the sound,
Which to reporters, perched aloof,
The spouters made, did all confound
SPARE TABLES.
A Book has just been advertised under the title of " Tables Showing the Income-Tax, at 5d.
in the pound.”. We should think that the chief peculiarity by which Tables would show the
Income Tax at 5d. in the pound, would be that of being very scantily supplied.

EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT SALE.
It is not often that our Government spontaneously proposes to do
the right thing; and, whenever such proposals are by accident let
drop, it is surprising with what cleverness officials manage Not to Do
it. The following shameful case, which we copy from the Times, will
serve to illustrate the fact :-
“BURNING OF THE SARAH SANDS.—The tape in Whiteball is increasing in red-
nees. When the screw steam-ship Sarah Sands caught fire, 400 miles from the
Mauritius, on her way to Calcutta, with the 54th Regiment on board, the men com-
posing her crew distinguished themselves in a manner which induced the Board of
Trade to apply to the brokers of the ship for their names. After much difficulty,
and by sending to the other side of the globe, the names were obtained and for-
warded to Whitehall. The Board has just written to CAPTAIN Castle that, 'since
making the request my Lords bave carefully considered the provisions of the Act
which enables them to grant rewards for gallantry in saving life at sea, and they
have come to the conclusion that, although they are most deeply impressed with
the very unusual courage, energy, and good discipline evinced by yourself and
others on the occasion in question, they doubt whether the Act of Parliament would
justify them in granting rewards in this case, and they fear that they could not
grant such rewards without setting a precedent which might lead them hereafter
into very great difficulties.
Government Sales are advertised now almost every week, and
really this seems one of the most extensive character. After taking
pains to find out those deserving of reward, Government says coolly
it has no reward to give them. By calling for the names of those
brave deserving men, wbo so nobly risked their lives to save the life
of others, Government, of course, has raised their expectations ; but

We are about to send over to the French nation the funeral car of
the EMPEROR NAPOLEON. We have sad forebodings that we are going
to give it to them for nothing! That would be a deplorable mistake.
We demanded, and received, 180,000 francs for the tomb and grounds
at St. Helena. That was perfectly right, only the property, was sold
rather under than over its marketable value. The Americans, we
guess, would have given a precious sight more for it. In fairness, the
lot should have been put up to public auction. However, if we let
this funeral car go out of the country as a stupid free gift, we mean to
say, it will be nothing short of a national disgrace. The mawkish
generosity of the thing will go far to forfeit the reputation that has
been fairly, or unfairly (but we hope) fairly), awarded to us of being
very little better than “a nation of shopkeepers." It is well worth
£300, if it is worth a sou. We are positive that MADAME TUSSAUD

HOW FATHER THAMES APPEARED TO THE CABINET, ON THE ROAD TO THE WHITEBAIT
DINNER, AND WHAT HE SAID TO THEM.
The sky was blue, the sun was bright,
Till STANLEY's brow grew less severe, Chained up full many an eager tongue,
Gaily the steamer ploughed her way,
And e'en sardonic Dizzy smiled.
And thinned full many an awkward
Freighted with hearts as blithe and light? And now the Isle of Dogs was past,

As school-boys' on a holiday.
And the Trafalgar rose to view,
Who sped along the India Bill?
With Youth (as STANLEY) at the prow, When suddenly a cloud was cast,
Who huddled up the Jewish claims?
Pleasure (as BULWER) at the helm,
That shut the Hospital from view.
Who on supply kept WILLIAMS still?
At top of flood the waves they plough
Ungrateful !-who but Father Thames ?
That lately threatened to overwhelm. And from the cloud a perfume rose,
That might be smelt but never sung; “I lurked behind your terrace wall,
On to their annual white-bait lark,
And every member to his nose,
I breathed athwart your window blind;
By Wapping's odour-breathing shore The guardian bandana flung;
Up through your chimneys I would crawl,

Slowly the cloud took form, and slow

Or through your air-shafts entrance find :
The perfume to a centre grew,

The steamer dashed with Ministères
And on the deck before them, lo!
Your foes have fled: 'tis me they fear :

A grisly form appeared to view !
Mine are the triumphs you have won-
Triumphant o'er the Sessions' fears,
Yet uninvited I stand here!

A DESIDERATUM.
" To Mr. Punch.
“LIKE your correspondent, JOHN STOUT, the
week before last, I have the misfortune to hold what is
facetiously called a 'sitting in a West End Church. It is
chiefly frequented by the upper circles, and these ‘upper
circles have so alarmingly increased in diameter since
the ladies took to steel jupes, that I find my once spacious
sitting' reduced to the narrowest of perches. Now, Sir,
as we are all supposed to be equal in church, and to leave
outside the porch our worldly conceits and social dis-
tinctions, would it not be well if these 'jupes could be
so contrived as that the lovely wearers might deposit
them in the vestibule of the church, to be called for, like
the carriages, at the conclusion of the service ? LADY
BALLOON'S crinoline stops the way!' would be a cry quite
horne out by the fact; and, though The DUCHESS OF
HEAVYSTERN's jupe just pulled on might give rise to
misinterpretation in minds inclined to levity, I cannot
doubt that a service of Ecclesiological linkmen might soon
be organised, with a series of cries that would not create
any double-entendre, or give umbrage to the most fastidious.
'I cannot think that the machinery required would be
complicated. The fair wearers of these elaborate fardin-
gales, on arriving at the church door, might gracefully duck
out through an aperture in the side, like the entrance to
a bell-tent, and enter their fortification again, after the
service in the same manner, raising the skirts of their robes
when inside, and letting them drop modestly and inoffen-
sively over the upper edge of the steel-ribbed erection.
"Ăn extra beadle might be laid on to watch over the
jupes and crinolines during the service, and to see that
the idle boys and girls of the neighbourhood did not take
advantage of them for temporary encampment, or hide
and seek.

ALTHOUGH the Stewardship of the Chiltern
Hundreds is not only a sinecure, but a sinecure
without a salary, that office is likely to be now
in great request. There would, indeed, be an
eager competition for it, but for the circumstance
that its capacity is such that it can never be
filled, but may be occupied by any given number
of men at the same time. Now that the House
of Commons has been unchristianized by the
admission of BARON ROTHSCHILD, bow can

and the other conscientious opponents of Jewish
emancipation, retain their seats in that House ?
The House of Commons has, in their minds,
committed a heinous sin; will they be partakers
of it? Nay, they will be worse than partakers
of it, unless they wash their hands of it, and
withdraw themselves from out of the assembly
of the unchristian.
The majority of the Commons, that let in the
Jews, did not believe that they sinned in so
doing. MESSRS. WARREN, SPOONER, NEW DE-
GATE, and the rest of the minority, think that
they did. If they accept the admission of the
Jews, they will accept the sin with their eyes
wide open. Suppose the House resolved that
the Speaker should cease from going to prayers.
Would they remain Members of it in that case ?
Surely they would, if they remain such at pre-
sent. If the House is unchristianized it is un-
christianized. If the gentlemen in question bad

not now fling up their seats rather than their

Romsey-on-the-Mud, August 5, 1858.
Who would go abroad to be pestered and plagued at every step of
his journey with the passport nuisance, when he might remain in his
native land and enjoy such a walk as I have just taken this morning,
and such a glass of ale at the end of it? Here I am at the White
Horse. It is market day-great market day they call it here. Pro-
found silence reigns, with rebellion only on the part of a cow that
keeps lowing I suppose for her calf, which will probably in a few hours,
become veal. Yet the square which I am contemplating from the
window of this publicbouse is full of men and beasts. The men are
farmers--but they have not yet dined. Nevertheless they keep
running in and out of the coffee-room, and drinking beer, but it will
take much beer to make them noisy. That, however, is not the fault
of the beer, but the peculiarity of the farmers. I have now imbibed a
pint of that same beverage, which I am afraid is as much as is good
for me. I hope my manuscript will not raise a suggestion that it is
more than that.
The prospect from this window is as picturesque as any that a Con-
tinental traveller can be surveying from that of any entomological
hotel. When I said that the men below were farmers, I generalized
too much. Some of them are butchers, and their azure garb contrasts
agreeably with the coats and smock frocks. On the other band it
matches beautifully with the blue of the sky; so did the harebells in
the banks and among the heather as I came along: For there is
plenty of heather hereabouts, between this place and Southampton,
and a native might stamp npon it and say that his name was JOHN
ADAMS-if that was his name, as it might be. The way lies in many places
through patches of wood and copse, with fern and toadstools (some of them
esculent) by the side of the road; and what more can a tourist want ?
Here you have a combination of English and Scotch scenery-there
are lots of firs and pines beside many parts of the road - with a sky
superior to that of sunny Italy, as the Cockney poets call that land of
priest-ridden boobies and brigands. Then the dress of this country is
quite as pleasing to look at as the costume of that, and doubtless
much cleaner. Besides the blue and white frocks, there is a charming

Oh, what a ridiculous fashion !

About encircled by a coop,
Composed of air-tube, bar, and hoop ?

WHAT TO DO WITH THE LEVIATHAN.
Many ingenious contrivances have been suggested, but
we like our own recommendation the best. We propose
that she be maintained as a kind of sewer-vessel, for the
purification of the Metropolis. Let the whole of the
sewage of this dirty London be emptied into her many
holds; and, when all of them are full, let her sail with the
cargo right out to sea, and discharge it in the middle of the
ocean, where no human nostrils are likely to be offended
with it. This might be done once or twice a-week, and
would triumphantly bridge over the difficulty of deciding
as to what particular point of the river the metropolitan
sewers are to favour with their fragrance. The Leviathan
is so far stuck for finances, tbat her works, for the mo-
ment, are at a complete stand-still. Being commercially in
rather low water, it would not take much to bail her out.
We fancy the vessel might be had almost dirt-cheap; so
that, as a speculation, it would promise to pay more than
(s)cent per (s)cent. Besides, it would effectually sink all
the disputes now raging as to the best system of drainage;
and thus a sweet little gain would be effected of some
dozen millions of pounds, that we are seemingly eager to
throw into the gutter in the construction of drains, that
no one seems to know how, or where, they are likely to
turn out. In our opinion, the Leviathan would make a
first-rate floating sewer; and, supposing economists ob-
jected to flinging so much wealth into the sea, means
might easily be taken to turn it to profitable account for
agricultural purposes. It would only be a graceful com-
pliment to appoint MR. MECHI commander,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

We have received the following Telegram from our Scarborough Correspondent:-
Scarborough, August 6th:-The weather is charming, although I do not feel much inclined for transactions of a business nature.
I am decidedly better. My Doctor, a most sensible man, recommends me to take Horse Exercise, and go into agreeable Society.
I endeavour to carry out his suggestions.”
SAM.
A MELANCHOLY BUT INSTRUCTIVE NARRATIVE, FOUNDED ON FACTS,
AND ON HORACE SMITH'S “GEORGE BARNEWELL."
SAM SOAPEY stood at his Palace door,
Promotion hoping to fiod, Sir;
His Apron it bung down before,
And the tail of his wig bebind, Sir.*
A Lady, so painted and smart,
Cried "Pardon my little transgression,
But I know what is next to your heart,
Now, what do you think of Confession ?"
Rum-ti-iddi-ti-ti.
Her face was rouged up to the eyes,
And red was ber ladysbip's toggery,
And folks who are thought to be wise,
Recognised a professor of roguery.
A bundle of Keys at ber waist-
Says she, "I can help you, Sir, that I can,
In the South I am very much graced,
And I live at a place called the Vatican.”-Rum-ti, &c.
Her language his wits did bereave,
She proceeded to carney and gabble on,
And at last (which you'd bardly believe)
He smirked at the Lady of Babylon.
Says be, "I should get in a scrape,
Could my late and respectable Síre hark;
He'd frown sbould a WILBERFORCE ape
A sleek Ultramontanist hierarch.”– Rum-ti, &c.
Says she, “Don't be frightened at names,
You 're always to Rome bad a tendency;
* Hierarchical wigs have no tails, and hierarchical Oxford has no wig, but
trifles must not quench the sacred fire of poesy.
Stand up for Confession; your game's
To struggle for priestly ascendency.
Cut the priest a back-way to the house,
And you've cut through the isthmus of Darien:
Fathers, husbands, are not worth a souse
After that, my fine stout-legged Tractarian.-Rum-ti, &c.
“Let laymen surrender their rights
To the curate; he knows what his trade is ;
He'll keep the wife's conscience from frights,
And he will ‘direct' the young ladies.
Get the women but under your thumb,
No chance for the male interlopers,
They may talk and protest till they're dumb,
The priest has the sway-and the coppers." —Rum-ti, &c.
This counsel he took from his love,
And in Parliament's very next Session

For the excellent rite called Confession."
But Premiers are wary, and they can see
Whom 'tis expedient to fish up;
Lo! an arcbiepiscopal vacancy,
And Sam is not made an Archbishop.-Rum-ti, &c.
If that Woman were here, dash my wigs,”
Cried he, “I'd come LUTHER and Knox at her,
I'd slate the old mother of prigs,
And raise my episcopal vor at her.
I fancied I'd made such a rare book,
And now I'm in just the wrong box for 't;
Had I stuck to my Anglican Prayer-book,
I should not have stuck BISHOP OF OXFORD.”-Rum-ti, &c.

The letter is signed THOMAS CHAMBERLAIN, Hon. Sec. What manner of man is
MR. CHAMBERLAIN? Is he a saint of the melancholy and Sabbatarian species? Does he
object to "dancing, archery, cricket, quoits, and games of ball,” or is he scandalized
only by "Punch-and-Judy, dancing-dolls, nigger-song singers, &c. ?” If not a saint, is he
a retired Beadle ?
If MR. CHAMBERLAIN is a serious character, we would beg him to reflect seriously. He
alludes, apparently, to all the amusements above-enumerated as “low vulgarities. We
presume that he at any rate thinks Punch and Judy vulgar. That is a hard word. Let
him say, “popular” instead, and consider how fine a thing for the nation is the popularity
of Punch and Judy. There can be no doubt that the energy and perseverance of the British
race are largely owing to the lessons which are beaten into their infant beads by the all-
conquering cudgel of Punch, and that his reckless atrocities inspire youth with daringness,
and blunt those too delicate sensibilities which constitute a spooney. We are afraid Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN, when he was a little boy, did not see enough of Punch and Judy.

has sprung up of M.P.s visiting their constituents, and
ivflicting on them long speeches. We object to this two-
fold tax. Let Members speak in Parliament as much
as they please, but we do not see what right they have to
speechify, out of Parliament. The nuisance is quite bad
enough during the Parliamentary season, without being
extended through the whole year. The House of Com-
mons is the proper arena for dulness, and we cry out
against the insidious attempt that certain loquacious
legislators are making to extend it. We propose that every

SOMETHING TO SEE.
Has any reader of Punch the happiness to possess as his wife, a
Large Winged Lady? And further, has this extensive, yet angelic
personage got a wardrobe ? If not, an advertiser in a provincial paper
has something to say to her. These are his offers :

We hope this introduction will be mutually serviceable to both
parties, and we should feel quite rewarded for any little trouble we
may have taken, if we could receive a photograph of the Large Winged
Lady.
A MONSTER.
The Banff Journal tells a remarkable story about a boy who was
bitten at Fochabers by a savage cat, which flew successively at his
throat, thigh, and leg, to which it stuck hard. Our Caledonian con-
temporary adds-
“The animal was more of a polecat than the common domestic cat, being a cross
between the two, and was quite rabid at the time.
A polecat being an animal of the weasel tribe, a cross between it and
the ordinary cat, is a curiosity which would make the proprietor's
fortune if exhibited. We trust the boy was bitten by no other cat
than this hybrid, as according to zoological laws, it is an animal that
can have no existence.

THE ROYAL DRAMATIC COLLEGE,
Let our thanks the boon ackuowledge;
And our cheers its undertakers;
Here's to the Dramatic College,
Here's to him who gave the acres !
Rest your bones and take it easy,
Now your leaf is sere and yellow;
Poor old stagers cramped and wheezy,
Who no more can strut and bellow!
Stars declining, unrepining,
Gossip still of buskin leather;
College fellows snugly dining
In your common room together.
College fellows, talking over
Foot-light triumph, green-room quarrel,
Now you 've changed for quiet clover,
Former crops of thorn and laurel.
Dons dramatic, why not vary
Ancient saw with fresh example,
Youths in statu pupillari,
Forming on the good old sample ?
With experienced eye judicious,
Sprigs of promise deftly culling.
From the stage-struck crowd officious,
Whom you warn their lives from mulling.
If the art be worth a College,
Skill dramatic is worth reaching;
Gifted minds and needful knowledge
Come of choosing and of teaching.
Let the Stage be a profession,
Let the Drama be a science;
Chosen, not from indiscretion,
Followed, not in world's defiance.
Noble utterance, gracious bearing,
Life from its dull prose-husks sifted,
Baseness crushed with scorn unsparing,
Manhood to its height uplifted
Are not these fair means of teaching
Men what men should aim at being ?
Showing is the best of preaching,
And believing comes of seeing !

“ILLI ROBUR, ET ÆS TRIPLEX.”
We are told that to commemorate the QUEEN'S
visit to Cherbourg, the EMPEROR has ordered a
pyramid of granite to be put up as a monument
of the "remarkable event.” England once upon
a time was the favoured means of furnishing
his Majesty with bread, and he now returns the
compliment by giving her some stone. Well,
granite is undoubtedly a durable material, and
is therefore not uncommonly selected for a
monument.
But we fancy that in this case bronze would
have been fitter : although we grant that as the
monument is to be erected close to the sea--
shore, and as salt air is, we know, injurious to
metal, the proposed granite pyramid would
doubtless prove a_monumentum ære perennius :
that is to say in English, more lasting than a
bronze one.
But, then, the EMPEROR has such a stock of
brass on hand,
that he might have saved himself
the cost of buying fresh material, and have relieved
himself in some part of his æral superfluity.
Had his Majesty erected a pyramid of brass,
we might have looked upon it as a portion of
himself, which, of course, would have enormously
increased our veneration for it. To the statue
of his uncle which has been put up at Cherbourg,
the EMPEROR might have added an effigies of
himself: the truth being typified in tbe pyramid
of bronze, that he is possessed of no small heap
of brass.

the fact was given by a policeman, but the Manchester Guardian,
which reports the case, omits to mention the name of the base
informer at whose instance the accusation was brought. The false-
hood of that accusation, which, even if true, nobody but a malevolent
bigot or hypocrite would have preferred, will be evident from the
following extract from our Manchester contemporary ;-
“MR. Ayos, solicitor for the defendant, elicited in cross-examination that the

wheat which the defendant was cutting had been beaten down by rain, that clover
was growing through it, and that it was beginning to sprout. On these grounds
MR. Amos contended that the defendant was engaged in a work of necessity. MR.
Ross, stipendiary magistrate, admitted the full force of this defence."
And so, you will conclude, the brute who brought the charge was

clergy or dissenting ministers. There were civic magistrates as well
as a stipendiary one on the bench. MR. Ross took that view of the

THE FIGHT OF RED LEGS.
SHOWING HOW AN HONORABLE ENGLISH LORD DID CASTIGATE A PRESUMPTUOUS ROMAN PRIEST.
AND ye did well, LORD EGLINTON,
And the priests they straightway emptied And we'll drink success to the Telegrapb,
When ye knocked off bis perch
down
Which at length has gone so right,
The crowing bird called Cardinal,
What a Jew would call the Vynth,
And the great L. L. sball lay the sword
The red-legged Cock of the Church. And their wines dispatched,
they shouted loud, On the shoulder of CHARLES S. BRIGHT.
"A health to PiUS THE NINTH!”
'Twas the Cardinal, and he sat in pride,
They summoned the Quality, great and small,
Drinking the good red wine,
But though they met upon Irish ground, They summoned the great L. L.
And a hundred priests and more sat there, And in public guise, I ween,
And the day was fixed, and the punch was
All kicking up a shine.
No glass was raised for a loyal toast,
mixed,
To the health of Ireland's QUEEN.
(And it's jolly that same did smell.)
“What ho, a toast," quo' the Cardinal,
" A toast, my shepberds bold,"
“ 'Tis well, 'tis well,” quo' LORD EGLINTON, Tidings were brought to LORD EGLINTON,
And every priest he filled his glass,
“ The Popish toby we'll tickle;
As he sat in his L. L's chair,
As full as the glass would hold.
I flatter myself, my boys, I've got
"You'll see a neat thing in the red leg line,
A very fine rod in pickle.”.
The Cardinal will be there."
(A vulgar trick, but it suiteth well
The snobs of the mass-house steeple ; They've laid the Cable across the sea, Then out and laughed LORD EGLINTON,
Rome's priests, like JEROBOAM's, “come They've laid the electric rod;
And his subs looked out for the joke,
From the lowest of the people.”)
One end astounds the Irish herring,
"I think,” says the Lord of the Tournament,
And one the Newfoundland cod.
My rod has had time to soak.
The Cardinal he looked around
With a sacerdotal wink,
"A feast, a feast,” cries the Dublin Mayor, "Go down, my ilegant aide-de-camp,
And he cried, “'Tis meet, my shepherds “ In honour of science and pluck,
I know you'll enjoy the job;
bold,
We'll drink success to the Telegraph, And say I'll be jiggered before I dine
Our Sovereign's health to drink.”
And to its promoters, luck.
Along with that red-legged snob.
And every priest he raised bis glass,
“The Lord Lieutenant shall grace the board, “And none of the Lord Lieutenant's court
And he stood in act to tope,
The Chancellor likewise,
Shall show any honour or grace
And the Cardinal cried, with uplifted voice, And all the hoight of Quality,
To the bloated priest who dared put the POPE
“ To the health of our Lord the POPE.” Which the Dublin boys do prize."
In our gracious SOVEREIGN’s place."

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Merrily laughed the aide-de-camp,
And off to the MAYOR did hie,
And with infinite glee administered he
This regular slap in the eye.
And the guests were met, and the feast was
set,
And there was the Cock of Rome;
But the Lord Lieutenant and Quality
They took and they stopped at home.
Right flustered then was the red-legged bird,
Ănd a feeble cackle he made,
And never so stupid a speech was heard
From one who's a speaker by trade.
"I didn't believe that the English Lord
Would have bad the pluck,” he said,
“ To give a Prince of our Holy Church,
Such a thundering punch in the head.
"Before my priests and my devotees,
That would lick the dust of my shoe,
I receive the cut direct, as a bint
That my priestly ideas won't do.
"I
fancy I've gone a little too far,
These Saxons are obstinate pigs,
I must give my priests a cue to stop
Their ultramontanish rigs.”
A feast, a feast, is spread at Dundalk,
The priests are assembled there,
And the red-legged Prince of the Church has
come,
And KIERAN fills the chair.
And there's Dr. Dixon and LORD BELLEW,
And the President of Maynootb,
And Dr. M‘NALLY, and BoWYER, M.P.,
That remarkably sapient youth.
And a couple of hundred Romans more,
With brogue as broad as their shoes,
And some of the priests they carried the
whips,
With which they collect their dues.
A health, a health,” quo' DEAN KIERAN,
To the POPE be laus et gloria ;
And now a health, which I'm sure you'll drink
With delight, To our QUEEN VICTORIA,"
“Aha! aha!" quo' LORD EGLINTON,
When he read the story in print;
“It seems to me," says LORD E., says he,
“Old Red-Legs can take a hint."
So here's to the Lord who would not flinch,
But served out the Cardinal well,
We can quite afford to give Rome an inch,
While we keep such a jolly L.L.

AN EQUESTRIAN DIFFICULTY.

A WOMAN'S QUESTION.
A LITTLE book has just been issued by the “Committee of the
Ladies' National Association for the Diffusion of Hygienic Know-
ledge,” under the interrogative title, Why do not Women Swim ? A
wretch bas answered, "Why indet d? Women of all creatures ought
to be able to swim.' Most of them are light enough, and many are
empty enough.”
Quoting only to condemn this horrid observation, let us express the
delight with which we learn that there exists an association for the
diffusion of bygienic knowledge among ladies. We hope to witness
the success of this society's labours in the disuse of tight lacing, the
increasing practice of walking exercise, the growing fearlessness of
sunsbine, and fearfulness of gaslight, attested by radiant eyes and rosy
cheeks, not destined to fade almost as fast as the leaves do. Having
made these remarks, we will propose the health of the Ladies-and
may they learn to take care of it.

BOOBLES! What a nick-

ILL-DIRECTED LOVE.
(A RECENT GREENWICH TRAGEDY, BY POLICEMAN X.)
MR. T. BLANK was a party to pleasure much inclined,
He were fond of whitebait dinners, and of taking too much wind :
And who he gallivanted with he didn't mind a bit,
In fact, a bow with many strings, that any miss might hit. :
In Greenwich dwelt this THOMAS, and near him fair and coy,
Inhabited a sempstress, which her name it was MOUNTJOY ;
(THERESA by her Christian name), and in an 'ouse not far,
There dwelt another sempstress, Miss JULIA LAZARRE.
Now Thomas, it appears, from the sequel of this case,
To both those lovely sempstresses, with an unblushing face,
Had paid his court-I wonder 'owever it was done-
Till-along of his duplicity—their two young 'earts was won.
This THOMAS wrote a letter, which he meant for Miss MOUNTJOY,
And the height of loving language in it he did employ;
“ Dearest THERESA, don't refuse this evening me to meet,
As I should find your company at eight o'clock most sweet.
“We'll meet upon the bridge that atop o' the lane doth lie,
And while the stars are twinkling a walk we will enjoy ;
Do not let Julia know of this, and bring the baby, mind-
Yours dearly and affectionately, THOMAS," so 'twas signed.
Now that same evening MR. T. had made a rendezvous
With Julia
-see what sempstresses will be and go and do !
And to soothe the disappointment of the injured Miss LAZARRE,
He wrote exactly in the words, that here reported are:
* Dear JULIA,—you must not think your Thomas is unkind,
But an engagement will prevent my seeing you, I find,
This evening, as
proposed; to-morrow we will meet,
Yours, ever dearly, Thomas." —such was his base deceit.
When MR. T. had wrote and seald those precious billets doux,
(Not thinking there are powers above such treach’ry to confuse)
His hand by Cupid guided-that blind young
archer-boy-
Miss MOUNTJOY'S did direct LAZARRE," and Miss LAZARRE'S

I would have given a sovran to have been upon the ground,
When the postman did deliver these here letters on his round:
Miss L. she walked to Miss M.'s house, and “Miss MOUNTJOY,”
“ Here's a letter, Miss, that's meant for you, though it's addressed
to me."
Then Miss M. took from her pocket the letter giv'n above,
And in an aggravating way it to Miss L. she guv:
Saying, “If you come to letters, Miss, from MR. T. here's one,
That to your hands and not to mine, did ought for to have gone."
Then Miss L. upon Miss M. made so furious an attack,
That Miss M. she went and locked herself in her parlour, two-pair back;
And Miss L. she tried to smash the door, but too strong the door
did find,
So she went and smashed the windey, such was her state of mind !
Of course Miss M. could not stand by, and submit to bave her windey
Shivered to bits, so she rushed out, and then there was a shindy:
And language passed which never, you would fancy, could employ
A THERESA and a Julia, not to speak of a MOUNTJOY.
And this led to a summons, which the hearing was last week,
Before JAMES TRAILL, or SECKER, Esquire, the Greenwich beak;
And then on the inquiry came out, plain as A, B, C,
The letters of that artful and 'eartless MR. T.
Now all young men be warn'd by this; if you've two strings to

proved always unavailing, and even at the last the earth-hunger never
left him.
Still less in his social than his mercantile relations do we find the
deceased worthy to be held in good repute. Cringing to superiors, his
treatment of dependents was tyrannous and harsh. In the selfishness of
a monopolist, he cared for no one else; his own.countrymen were pro-
hibited from setting foot on his estates; and be pushed the law of tres-
pass to such rigorous extent, that to come upon his property, without
his leave and licence, was made byy Act of Parliament, a crime and
misdemeanour, punishable by fine; confiscation, and imprisonment.
In spite, however, of his harsh and arbitrary despotism, our doubts if
he was ever really feared by his dependents are sanctioned by the
fact that they thought him an old woman, and could never be brought
to show any feeling of respect for what they held up to derision as a
petticoat sort of government.
Nor, while we thus regard him as a thoroughly bad landlord), can
we admit that his behaviour was much better as a master. His
conduct to his servants was capricious in the extreme. He either
bullied them or petted them beyond the limits of endurance. He over-
paid his overseers, and let them pilfer as they pleased; and, in fact, ha
did bis best to spoil all in bis Service. But, although profusely liberal
and careless as a rule, he showed to them att times a niggardly dose-
fistedness. In proof of this, we need not mention the hequest which
he made at the last gasp to a man of his,, named MILL, who had
served him with great faithfulness
, and had grown old in his services
The post which Mill had occupied was that of a night-watcher;
and it would be difficult to name a fitter person for the place. Some
notion may be formed of the meanness which occasionally distingnished
the deceased,, when we state that a legacy off £500 was the paltry
sum he left in recognition of MILL's service.
It remains but to add, that the deceased died possessalioffa consider-
able property, consisting both of real and of personal estate. In
gracious compliance with a national requestHER MAJESTY has com
sented to act as sole trustee;, and it is, therefore, in the QUEEN'S
name the effects will be administered. There is no doubt that the
property will be better managed henceforth than it ever yet has been;
and we may hope that it will soon be cleared of all encumbrance.
There is, we think, great cause for gratulation in the change, although
it may be urged that it is merely nominal! Our loyalty, of course,
obliges us to own tbat, whatever were his merits, the deceased, upon
the whole, did not bear so good a name as to be compared for one half
second with the Royal one. In paying our last tribute to the
HONOURABLE JOHN, we must own we think his room far better than
his Company; and we trust that it may never come within our
province to have to write the word "Resurgam” on his tombstone.

THE GROWTH OF LONDON.
BARON DUPIN estimates, “if the population of London keeps on
growing at its present ratio, tbat, in 1901 it will be 5,816,900.” Night
we ask the Baron if he has taken the Thames into his calculation ?
Does that “noble river” in 1901 remain as it is ? or is it to be sweet-
ened ? or is it to be taken away altogether? These different views
put quite a different aspect on the Baron's peep into 1901; for it
stands to reason that 5,816,900 human
beings could not possibly live,
with a pestiferous river, such as the Thames now is, running right
through them. And allow the Thames to pursue unchecked its present
course of pollution, it is doubtful wbether there will be any population
at all in our savoury Metropolis. All the inhabitants will have died

“1. A Band of Ethiopians (considering how they murder melody and kill time

of three to ten inclusive. Like many Coburg princes, they seem to have learnt the
secret of turning their German brass in this country into English gold, for they are

The following is part of a speech by SIR JOHN TRELAWNY,
delivered, a few days ago, to his Tavistock constituents.
He is speaking of the Church Rate Bill:-
“ I am afraid we may have great cause to divide ourselves from the
Bishops, for the Bill was smothered by a great avalanche of long-
sloeved Bishops. I went to the House of Lords one day, and I saw
a row of Crinolines (laughter) reaching a long way, and these were
the Bishops, all stolid and grave, but exceedingly ignorant of the
elements of Church Rate law. It was melancholy to hear them so
ignorant of the simplest proportions of the Bill."

A SCOTTISH PATRIOT.
Glasgow, believe it or not, wants more water to mix
with the intolerable quantity of whiskey wherewith she
besots herself. Her Water Commissioners require, in the
course of their operations, about fourteen acres of land be-
longing to one JOHN MACGREGOR, Esq., who, in Scotch
fasbion, calls himself GLENGYLE, from the name of his
estate, and who is stated to be a collateral descendant of
Rob Roy MACGREGOR. If disposition could prove pedi:
gree, we think any herald would pass MR. GLENGYLE's; for
in the first place he demanded for bis fourteen acres
£25,903 118. 8d., and then, remembering his feelings,"
increased his price to £93,500. The stunned Commis-
sioners could only gasp out that bis whole estate, of 2200
acres, with all its rock, bog, and beather, is not worth
more than £7000. A Southron reader is equally astonished
that under such circumstances the parties could meet for
an arbitration. Such, however, is the case, and the Lord
Advocate of Scotland was umpire, or oversman, and
gave GLENGYLE £490. If our friend GLENGYLE did not
want to ticket bis estate with a probibitory price, (just as
some English idiots marked their hideous Cochin China
cocks at a hundred guineas each, at a show the other day,)
what on earth did his monstratious demand mean? All
we can say is, that Glasgow will at last have an excuse for
her drunkenness, should she be able to say, that she can
buy no water except at the most awful and extortionate
price ever heard of.
Perhaps this is the solution of the GLENGYLE problem
-the owner of the estate is a patriot, and not being able
to bear the contempt with wbich drunken Glasgow is
spoken of by moral and civilised folk, resolved, at the
chance of losing a good sale, to provide her with a plea in
extenuation of her depravity.

SCIENTIFIC GASTRONOMY.
THOSE rather numerous persons whose minds are chiefly given to
eating and drinking may be seriously interested in certain revelations
made at the recent meeting of the British Association for the Advance-
ment of Science at Leeds. During a conversation on the subject of
the lately discovered metal Aluminium, a MR. F. GRACE CALVERT
mentioned that the substance in question rapidly decomposes in water
at 212°, and indeed at all temperatures, more or less; insomuch that
a wire of it wbich he had left enclosed in a tube of water_for
twelve months bad become converted into gelatinous alumina. This
discovery suggests a hopeful method of converting, aluminium spoons
into jelly, and thus of being enabled to eat jelly out of a mere
spoon.
A DR. GEORGE HARLEY read a paper entitled Notes of Experiments
on Digestion, calculated to raise the most agreeable and sanguine ex-
pectations. He has, he states, discovered that the pancreatic secretion
unites in itself the functions of the salivary, gastric, and biliary
secretions." This secretion of the pancreas is, he remarks,
valuable substance to those who suffer from indigestion,” so that, "in
fact, if they could determine the active principle of that secretion, they
would gain the power of digesting anything they pleased. He had
been labouring some time in the preparation of such a substance, but
he had not yet got it in a pure state.” When DR. HARLEY shall have
succeeded in accomplishing the object of his scientific labours, he will
have completely eclipsed the discovery of “pepsin," and by enabling
everybody to digest anything, have conferred a real blessing on Alder-
men. The Corporation of London will perhaps constitute him their
officer of health. He will have endowed the bipes implumis, man, with
the faculty of the all-digesting bird, and achieved a physiological
triumph which will be quite an ostrich-feather in his cap.
PHEBUS APOLLO, brilliant son of Leto
By cloud-compelling thunder-wielding Zeus,
Audacious mortal men are putting thee to
A vile, ignoble, base, uuworthy use.

Holding the ribbons of his fiery steeds.
O thou, the blazing orb of day that ridest !
Hear how low slaves profane it for their needs.
Patron of artists, sons of art abuse thee,
Art's graceless sons, discrediting their name ;
Some of their impudent pranks may but amuse thee,
Thine indignation others will inflame.
Photographers, on Science basely trading,
The Sun thou rulest to their ends pervert,
And make it do the drawing and the shading
Of pictures cheap and scandalous as dirt.
Oh! monarch of the Muses and the Graces,
Down on this earth a moment cast tby gaze,
And see what foolish, vulgar, snobbish faces
Those fellows to portray compel thy rays.
The silly smirk, the grin of vacant folly,
The sensual mouth, low front and snubby nose,
The leering eye, or maudlin melancholy,
Of pert, affected, Cockney belles and beaux.
And not alone the mean unlovely features
Of suchlike brutes thy Sun do they make paint,
But likewise all the antics of the creatures,
Acts worse tban bad enough to shock a Saint.
Their apish revels, by this new invention
The sunbeams pure these kpaves oblige to fix,
Perpetuating scenes too gross to mention,
Of human beings playing monkeys' tricks.
Phæbus Apollo ! take thy
bow and arrows,
And quell these horrid Pythons of the mud;
Transfix them, nail them, as boys shoot cock-sparrows;
Chase them like clouds before thy face that scud.
Let thy sharp shafts, unerring as the rifle,
The foul offensive brood of reptiles smite;
Make them know what it is with thee to trifle :
Teach slaves of darkness not to shame the light.

ANOTHER MIRACLE IN FRANCE !
It is well known that very few Englishmen have been seen in France
this year. It is reported that at a certain village in the neighbourhood
of Pau, a curious-looking stranger was seen by a female peasant, who
declares that he had a red book in his hand, and was walking in the
sun at noon at tbe rate of five miles an hour. The book was declared
to be about the size of one of MURRAY's Handbooks, and other facts,
-such as the stranger carrying a red umbrella, and wearing top boots,
and his being followed by a big bull-dog-point beyond a doubt to the
certainty of Albion being able to claim the undisputed glory of owning
this noon-day pedestrian as one of her travelling sous. The whole
village turned out in a state of the greatest excitement to witness the
strange phenomenon, but nothing further has been seen of it. A
lodging-house keeper, who has had five-and-twenty years' knowledge of
the English, and their curious ways, was sent in pursuit of the stranger,

ODE TO AN OLD HUMBUG.
YOUR sands of life well-nigh run out,
Retired Physician,
Have taken such a time about,
That I have very little doubt
That you are hearty, hale, and stout,
In good condition.
Your grave is not already dug,
Or the presumption
Is, you creep to it like a slug,
And cling to life with tightish hug.
You say that you've found out a drug
To cure consumption,
So soon from earth about to pass,
As you assure us,
The scythe so close upon the glass,
Ready to mow your ripened grass,
Why not divulge it to the mass,
And gratis cure us ?
Of doing good then you'll enjoy
T'he noble pleasure,
And in that bank aloft, old boy,
Which pays in gold without alloy,
Which never panic will destroy,
Invest your treasure.

No longer falter,
And fumble at death's latch no more ;

FINE LANGUAGE AT FAULT.
THE Banff Journal, in making mention of a remarkable
townsman of that ilk, describes his calling in terms which
are meant to dignify it, but which, in reality, degrade it.
"Mr. Thomas EDWARDS has," says our Northern contem-
porary, ever since be was able to work, followed the
calling of an operative shoemaker." What is an operative
shoemaker? The Second Roman Citizen in Julius Cæsar,
describing the nature of his profession, says, “I am,
indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes." He meant to say
that he was a cobbler: and “ surgeon to old shoes” and
"operative shoemaker may be regarded as convertible
phrases. Therefore MR. THOMAS EDWARDS of Banff might
be taken to be, according to the statement of the Banff
paper, a cobbler. But that journal proceeds
inform us,
as touching MR. EDWARDS, that “he may be said to be
fully master of all that is known in ornithology and
zoology, while in conchology and botany his knowledge is
also profound.” Now, a master of ornithology and zoology,
to say nothing of conchology and botany, though he might
not have the capital requisite to enable him to be also a
master shoemaker, must surely possess an amount of
brains which would raise him at least to the level of a
journeyman, and above that of a cobbler : unless, indeed,
in the neighbourhood of Banff, shoes are so long worn and
so often repaired, that it takes a cleverer artist to mend
them than the one who manufactured them. If that is the
case, then the Banff Journal displays fine meaning rather
than fine words in styling MR. EDWARDS an operative
shoemaker; but if not, it affords an instructive example
of the injudicious use of a redundance, intended for a
euphemism, but, in effect, derogatory.
However, be the nature of the operations which MR.
EDWARDS performs in connection with shoes what it may,
he is to be congratulated on having successfully set at
nought the classical but absurd proverb, which forbids all
practitioners of his professional art to apply their minds
to the consideration of anything higher than highlows.

By far the most precious of craft afloat,

There are husbands with luggage, and husbands with none,
There are husbands with parcels in hand,
They bring down to wives whom they lately have won,
Who pretty attentions command.
There are husbands who know whate'er time it may be
Their wives on the jetty will wait
For that Hymeneal argosy,
With its matrimonial freight.

But the Monday Morning is “Monday black,”

And the wives look monstrous blue;
So loud the bell rings, and the steamer starts
On her way to Thames Haven again,
And amid those who leave are as many sad hearts,
As there are amid those who remain.

Having premised thus little, we will beg to remark,
that the last time we saw Netley Abbey, it was
in such a state as to be likely to mislead any
Cockney into an etymological blunder. It was full
of nettles; and, as PopJoy would naturally observe,
very well deserving the name of Netley Abbey.
We wish we could say that nettles were the worst
of the superfluities that abounded in its interior
but will only state that it contained refuse as well
as weeds. When last we heard of it, which was
very lately, it was in precisely the same state, which
our informant described in words intermingled with
whiffs. We trust that, in so public-spirited a neigh-
bourhood as that which adjoins Netley Abbey, the
proprietor of that venerable ruin will not have
it to say one moment longer, that he is unable to
have it swept and weeded, and obliged to let it
crumble to pieces, for want of funds.

CHOWLER UPON MECHI.
The toast of "The Stewards” having been
drunk at the late Meeting of the Waltham
Agricultural Society, the immortal Chow-
LER, of Protectionist memory, made a speech
as good in its way as that delivered by LORD
JOHN MANNERS, to which it bore the same
relation as that which may be supposed to
exist between the sturdy yeoman and the
chivalrous lord. The oration was bluff and
brief, like the bark of a mastiff. Subjoined

“According to MR. MECHI, the agriculture of this
county is a disgrace to us. He did not know MR.
Mechi's farm; but a friend used that identical epithet
to describe the condition in which he found MR.
MECHI's farm, and particularly MR. Mecar's pigs."
MR. MECHI had better take care what he
says. The proprietor of Tiptree Hall lives,
when he lives there, in a glass farm-house;
and he forgets the proverb which he ought

DITTIES FOR DONKEY-EATERS.
Among things which are not known so generally as they should be,
is the fact that there not long ago was set on foot in Paris a sort of
Cannibal Society for Eating Ass-flesh. Of the rules of this Society
we have not as yet learnt much; nor have we an idea of what amount
of ass-eating the fact of one's subscribing to it yearly would entail. It
is also a moot point with us, whether the members rise in the ranks of
the Society in proportion to the number of the donkey dinners they
attend; and if this be so, we cannot help confessing to ourselves that
the Presidentship certainly would be a cut or two above us, if our only
way to reach it was by eating our way up to it. We hear, the Ass-
eaters maintain that a donkey's flesh is just as short and sweet as is
his gallop;
and they kindly invite sceptics to test of that opinion; but
so long as we can get a mutton-chop at home, we shall not be lured to
Paris by the prospect of an ass-steak. Still further to prove the cor-
rectness of their taste, they hunt up Classic literature for precedents
for donkey dining; and assert with no small triumph, that with ancient
Roman epicures a dish of donkey cutlets was especially a weakness.
But really this no more inclines our appetite for ass-meat, than we
should expect to get a liking for boiled negro, from being told that the
gourmands of the Cannibal Islands were partial above all things to a
nicely-cooked black pudding.
If the Society gains ground, and becomes really popular, (which we
about as much expect to hear as that the Comet's tail has been depo-
sited in the British Museum, or that a fleet of Chinese junks have
stormed and taken Gibraltar), of course its popularity will exercise an
influence on literature, and the delights of Donkey-eating will be found
a theme inspiring both to poets and essayists. We shall have a second

RUSKIN'S BARN-DOOR.
MR. RUSKIN, in his paper on Art,
read the other day at Liverpool, ex-
pressed a hope that little clowns might
at least be taught drawing to an extent
sufficient to enable them to delineate
“ ducks' heads,” and “thrushes
breasts.”
Whether this is altogether to be
hoped or not, we can hardly de-
cide. The comic element in rusticity
is its essential beauty. Without
it, rusticity would be simply dull.
Viewed in relation to Art it would
be less rich, if more accurate, in its
manifestations. At present one of
the most charming objects which the
pedestrian encounters in his rural
rambles is the pictorial Barn-Door
which serves as canvas for the crea-
tions of juvenile! rustic art. Under
the various sketches, mostly in chalk,
which adorn this familiar superficies,
the name of the object meant to be
represented is generally scribbled.
Hereby we know that this or that
extremely abstract idea of a human
figure, in which the limbs are lines,
and the fingers radii of a small circle,
is meant for the Beadle, or some other
local dignitary or personage, probably
unpopular; passing by the name of
"OLD SCROGGS," for example.
This effort of uncultivated genius,
together with the gallows (of the
Derrick type) to which it is con-
tiguous or attached, will disappear
from the barn-doors if Mr. RUSKIN'S
hope is fulfilled ; and we doubt if
the "ducks' heads,” and “thrushes'
breasts” will satisfactorily supply
the place of “OLD SCROGGS," and
“WALKER.”

A TREMENDOUS BAG.
Miss LUCY SMITH went out shopping the other day, and brought
home with her a most tremendous bag. It was so heavy, that it was
as much as the Page could do to bring it into the parlour to be
inspected by the ladies. Upon its contents being emptied on to the
dining-room table, it was found to contain :-a bottle of Kiss-me-
Quick, a pair of white satin shoes, a bulky packet of gloves (cleaned),
a dozen rolls of cotton, a paper of pearl buttons (to mend Papa's
shirts), a box of cough lozenges, a bundle of violet-powder, a kettle-
holder, ten yards of blue ribbon, a pack of club cards, a pair of
American overshoes, a pot of bear's grease, a pound of jujubes, a
velvet necktie, three cambric pocket-handkerchiefs with LUCY”
embroidered in gay flowers in the corner, a pair of mittens, a small tin
can supposed to contain acidulated drops, beads and long pins and
gold daggers and imitation coins for the hair, fifteen yards of the best
long cloth, a bundle of brushes and small jars of gum for potichomanie
work, small curling-irons, several small pots containing perfumes
and mysterious volatile essences for the toilette-table, numerous papers
of different varieties of Berlin wool with coloured pattern of Brigand
for the same, two ounces of shot to sew round the bottom of one's
dress, seven yards of edging for night-caps, a set of doll's tea-things,
two packages of bird-seed for the canary, a bath bun, one Convent Cell,
and Two Fond Hearts, with Ten Thousand a Year. Besides the above,
there was concealed inside the long cloth a yellow book, that looked
suspiciously like a French povel; but, as it was hastily snatched up by
Miss Lucy, it is perfectly impossible to mention the name of it.
Miss Smith was not a little pleased with the results of her day's sport,
having brought down every one of the articles enumerated in the bag
herself in the space of little more than four hours and a quarter,
It must be mentioned, however, that the lady in question is a practised

you.
A BUSTER FROM CARDEN. .
ONE of Dr. Watts's beautiful poems for children has been brought
forcibly to our mind by the behaviour of our admirable Sovereign,
the MAYOR CARDEN, Baronet. That glorious orb is within a few hours
of setting; and the Mayoral splendour will soon merge in the
Aldermanic wave:
“ But when he comes nearer to finish his race,
Like a fine setting sun he looks richer in grace."
Scarcely a day passes but CARDEN distinguishes himself by some
superhuman display. We would try to chronicle his brilliancies ; but
nothing less than a weekly supplement would hold one-half of them.
Still
, we must preserve some record of the Great Mayoralty;
and
perhaps the following oration, delivered by SIR R. W. C. in a bigamy
case, is as worthy of his transcendant genius as any of his magnificent
outpourings.
To understand the first sentence (though, like the old Scotch lady
and her admired preacher, we wad no ha' the presumption to attemp
to understand CARDEN), it should be said, that one of the young ladies
who
had been victimised by the bigamist was very pretty. Thus spoke
SIR ROBERT:-
“I wonder the fellow got tired 80 soon of his marriage with you, MRS. GEER. It
must be a hard-hearted wretch to run away after only five days of married life with
I wish I had him here. If I could do with him what I should like, he never
should have another wife. I should not mind hanging such a fellow. I think if
ever a man deserved hanging, it is for deceiving a woman, particularly under such
circumstances as have been disclosed here to-day. It is the vilest act of which &
man can be guilty. It will be some satisfaction probably to each of you to see him
in the dock on a charge of bigamy. I certainly should like to see him tried upon
that charge at the Old Bailey. I trust that what has occurred here to-day will appear
in the Newspapers, and I have no doubt its publication will bring half a dozen
other young ladies here. I will lend every assistance I possibly can to bring such
a vile wretch to justice. He will have no mercy at my hands if he comes into them.
I feel deeply for the situation of MRS. GEER, and cannot help congratulating Miss
upon her fortunate escape."
Certain productions of great men have been in reverent affection
christened by their adorers. A Symphony of MOZART's is called the
Jupiter. Bacon's Summary of Argument is termed the Vintage.
Punch’s diamond annual of wit is called the Pocket Book (and will be
published on the Ninth of November, together with LORD MAYOR
WIRE, price two-and-six,—the book we mean), and CARDEN's con-
densation of all that is manly, vehement, and noble, should have a
name. Let us call it the Buster.
We despair of adding, effect to such a superlative harangue by any
remark of ours. But, if we recollect aright, it was thought fine in
CICERO, when opening fire upon L. CALPURNIUS Piso, to dash at him
with a Jamne dides, Bellua, jamne sentis ? “Don't you see yet, don't
you feel yet, you Beast ?” Unless a typographic caprice has happily
snatched for LORD CARDEN a grace beyond the reach of art, he has
unconsciously, we are quite certain, imitated CICERO. Look at the
second sentence. "It must be a hard-hearted wretch”-it, a neuter
pronoun, and applying therefore to a Beast, by implication. Here is
the true artist. The fiery appeal, the swelling period, the appalling
stamp, to entrance and enchain the million-the exquisite and classical
grace, thrown in without effort, to delight the scholar. For the many,
the gigantic and glowing picture-for the few, the elegant and delicate
cameo.

THE LORD MAYOR TO HIS
BED-CANDLE.
N
It was the eve of Lord Mayor's Day,
The last day of the LORD MAYOR's year,
His glory soon to pass away,
His majesty to disappear;
St. Paul's would strike another hour,
Proclaim the limit of his span,
And shorn of pomp, and stripped of power,
Reduce him to an Alderman,
He took the candle, wont, at night,
To guide him to the couch of rest;
He struck the match, applied the light,
And thus his end of dip addressed :
"My candle, as thou buruest down,
And shortly wilt have ceased to flare,
So brightly shines the civic crown,
So soun extinct is the LORD MAYOR.
“Thou 'rt now an inch of mutton fat,
And I am every inch a lord.
Thou'lt be a speck of grease-like that
Down, too, shall I drop to my Ward.
As is thy lustre, e'en so brief,
Is all the splendour of my reign,
How soon the civic royal chief
Must yield the mace and duff the chain !
"Alas, that all that's bright must fade!
Lord Mayors away, like candles, pass,
A little while in light arrayed,
All flesh, nay turtle fat, is grass.”
Thus moral speeches did he spout
Till St. Paul's iron tongue did roar,
And then his bed-candle went out:
And so did he-LORD MAYOR no more!

THEORY OF TOM TIDDLER'S GROUND.
Some interesting particulars about aëroliths were pub-
lished the other day in the Times. These things may be
compared to the cherubs of popular imagination, for they
are small celestial bodies-though cherubs are said to
be “all head and no body." Some aëroliths, however,
are, comparatively, to bodies terrestrial, little strangers
of considerable magnitude. One in 1807, which fell in
the State of Connecticut, was, before it was broken, three
or four times as big as the Observatory at Paris. It is,
perhaps, fortunate that this aërolith fell inland instead
of tumbling into the Atlantic : for, if it had done that, it
might have killed the Sea-Serpent, and thus have inflicted
an irreparable loss on the Natural History of the Future.
Aëroliths generally fall with a loud explosion, which is pot
easily accounted for, though their fall naturally makes
some noise in the neighbourhood where it is observed.
They are small planetary musses, whirling in space about
the earth, and occasionally getting within reach of its
attraction, when down they come like Newton's pippin,
only they are blackened by fire, and thus in the state of
au overdone roast apple.
These bits of planets are composed of iron and nickel,
albeit the glitter of the stars would induce the supposition
that they were silver; though all that glitters is not silver
any more than gold. But there is no reason why, if the
stars contain nickel and iron, they should not also contain
the more precious metals, and why on some day in this
month, when stars shoot, that is, aëroliths fall
, periodically
in large numbers, a few nuggets should not drop among
those metallic meteors. Perhaps, if Jupiter were to go to
pieces, he would come down in a golden shower, which
would be too much of a good thing for Danat, represented
by the Earth. How do we know that the Diggings are
not places where it has been raining gold? These sug.
gestions will perhaps dispose some of our readers to look
out for shooting-stars, if not to expect that they may pick
something up by doing so.

THE PLAGUE OF ADULTERATION.
Popular Complaint to a Popular dir.
Oh, have you heard the tales of late,
How tradesmen all adulterate,
There's scarce a thing now, sad to state,
That's free from Adulteration,
Your tea is mere chopped hay and sticks,
Your Wallsend's safe to burn like bricks,
With sand your sugar so they mix,
That daily in your throat it sticks
Your coffee is chicory, beans, and bones,
Your jeweller sells you paste for stones,
In short whate'er you purchase owns
Some taint of Adulteration.
Chorus.
Hoens, pocus ! fee, fo, fum!
No wonder we all look so glum,
For nothing but ill-health can come
From the Plague of Adulteration.
Your best kid-gloves are really rat,
Your butter is pig's lard mixed with fat,
Your mutton-pies are made of cat,
By this plaguy Adulteration!
Your beer is strychnine, salt and slops,
And everything save malt and hops ;
And if you rashly call for wine,
I would not that your fate were mine!
Of lees and logwood port is made,
And even worse things, I'm afraid,
And sherry is now so tricked in trade,
'Tis nought but Adulteration.
Chorus.-Hocus, pocus ! &c.
Where'er you go, whate'er you buy,
Whatever" noted shop” you try,
For genuine goods in vain you cry,
Nought's sold but Adulteration.

It is said, that evils often cure themselves. When things are at the

Adulteration Mania, which is, we now find, raging so furiously around
us. The bad things we have heard of it make us think we cannot
possibly hear worse. Being at the worst then, we may hope that it
will mend, or rather we should say, we hope that it will end. When
the demand ceases, the supply, no doubt, will stop.
Now, that the demand will quickly cease, we cannot question. We
cannot in reason doubt that after what has been disclosed, people will
abstain from buying cheap and deadly sweetmeats, and the like harmful
compounds of adulterating tradesfolk. No one in his senses would
eat, wittingly, such poisons; and so Bedlamites will soon be the only
buyers left for them. Drugged lozenges will shortly be a drug in the
market, and all such deadly mixtures will become dead stock. The
known sanity of Englishmen in general proves this. With our eyes
open to that which has been lately brought to light, we must see that
a demand to be served with a cheap sweetmeat must imply a fitness
for immediate strait-waistcoating. The man who would eat lozenges,
knowing them to be "daff,” cannot be regarded as otherwise than
daft.

a long flannel
shirt would give all the heat required, and be twice as clean, without
embarrassing the men's freedom of movement. The absurd weight of the boot
should be diminished at once, and with reasonably strong shoes, a stout flannel

do all that it is in his physique to accomplish."
It would appear from this, that we were somewhat premature in
saying England has abolished the torture of the Boots, To make men
march in heavy boots in a burningly hot climate must entail on them
such sufferings as amount to actual torture; and while they bear this,
they are loaded with such weighty upper clothing as must increase
their torments to an almost insupportable degree. We stigmatise our
ancestors as cruel and inbuman; but they were generally content with
one torture at a time. Now, we are far from being satisfied with
this. In keeping with the age of refinement that we live in, we have
so refined our cruelty that we have recourse to three tortures at once.
Besides torturing a Soldier with the Stock and with the Boots, we add
a treble agony in the torture of the Weights. In addition to his knap-

we learn what burthens they all have to carry. It is the clothing, not
the climate, which they find past bearing. Solvitur ambulando. A
week's marching proves the fact. Our falsely-called "Light” Infantry

"God save the Queen” is still extant among us, as any one who
“lends his ears to aurist JULLIEN, to deafen for him any night, can

us is "Wait for the Waggon !” It may fairly be regarded as the " Jim

"Keemo Kimo,” “Bobbing Around," and half a hundred other shortlived
public favourites. “Wait for the Waggon" enjoys, while we write, the
enviable distinction of being for the nonce the pet song of the popu-
lace. Whenever one goes out one's ears are sure to tingle with it.
Every street-boy whistles, every organ grinds, it. “Poor Dog Tray”

Now, taken for a continuance, even turtle nauseates. The alder-
manliest of Aldermen in course of time will tire of it. It distresses
them to own it, but they can't disguise the fact. So is it now with us.
The talented composer of "Wait for the Waggon" must excuse us if
we say that we have had enough of it. We are not fastidious, but we
hate monotony. Gluttons as we were of it, toujours "Wait for the
Waggon” palls upon our palate. Its burthen is beginning to lie heavy
on our stomach. It humiliates us to own our want of better taste,
but with our character for truthfulness we cannot well conceal it.
Anything for a change. Variety is charming. If we cannot alter the
air, perhaps we may the words to it. What does the public think of
"Wait for the Omnibus ?”
We confess that this idea is in some degree a borrowed one. We
filch it from the evidence of Policeman A., 248, who gave this testi-
mony lately in the Westminster Police Court :-
“At five o'clock on Wednesday evening, the 15th of September, a Saloon omnibus
came up with one London General omnibus behind and one in front. The Saloon
omnibus was hailed by a lady and gentleman standing near the tailor's shop; the
Saloon drew up to take them, when the London General driver drove his horses to
two feet behind the door. The conductor got down from his omnibus, and took hold
of the lady and gentleman, when I told him to keep on the hind part of his omnibus,
unless he was called, and that if he repeated the offence I should report bim. He
intimidated the lady and gentleman, so that they refused to go into the Saloon
omnibus, and calling a cab, went away. On the same day, at 12:37, one of the
London General omuibuses was loitering in the High Road, Knightsbridge, when
I took my watch out of my pocket, and looked at the time, and going across to the
driver, took the number of his badge. I asked him what he was doing there, and
he replied, Waiting for the saloon omnibus.''
This throws a bull's-eye light upon the blackguard "Nursing,"
System by which 'busses are brought up in the way they should not
go, and the public's lives and limbs are daily put in jeopardy. With
thé merits of the case on which this evidence was given we have
nothing now to do, and have little wish to meddle. Let magistrates
decide when 'bus men disagree. Our province is to see to the pro-
tection of the public... As the public support Punch, we can't
afford to have the public maimed, and knocked over and killed, as
threatens to be its fate if this 'bus nursing continues. Between two
contending 'busses the public falls to the ground, and in nine times
out of ten runs the chance of being run over. In the above case the
public contrived to get a cab, and was lucky to escape with only
damage to its pocket. But the public cannot always expect to be so
fortunate. It must look to being injured in person as in purse, if
something be not done to protect it from these 'bus brigands. The
way they lie in wait is highwaymanly in the extreme. "Your money or
your life” is the cry which they get up to intimidate a passenger.
When an unprotected female falls into their hands, she may thank her
lucky stars if she escapes without a bone broken. With a couple of
conductors fighting for possession of her, the chance is she will bodily
be damaged in the scufile. Indeed, if steps be not devised to check
this nursing nuisance, we shall hear of women suffering some such
terrible a fate, as that of being torn to pieces by Wild Busmen; or
else of being dragged off to some underground retreat (say, for instance,
such a cavern as the White Horse Cellar), and there being forcibly
detained, by a band of these 'bus brigands, until their relatives have
clubbed together for their ransom.


Three wives sat up in JANE CLARKE's for hours,
And they told her to put every article down;
They ordered the silks, and they ordered the flowers,
And the Bill it kept rolling up, gown upon gown;
For wives must dress, and husbands will pay,
Though perhaps they will be in a terrible way
When they're dunned for the Bill that is running.

BANKRUPTCY COURT
Three Bankrupts were figuring in the Gazette
On a Tuesday night, when the sun went down,
And the women were weeping, and quite in a pet,
For the dresses they never will show to the town:
For wives will dress, though husbands can't pay,
And Bankruptcy's surely the pleasantest way
To get rid of the Bill and the dunning.
A STIFF NECK-OF LAND.
By advices from the Levant we learn that-
“The scheme of M. FERDINAND DE LESSEPS has received a terrible and severe
blow through the retirement of M. BARTHÉLEMY DE ST. HILAIRE from the office of
Secretary to the Company of the Suez Canal."
The severity of the blow which the scheme has received is owing to
the high scientific reputation of M. DE ST. HILAIRE; since his aban-
donment of the Suez Canal speculation implies that he thinks it no go.
Besides being an adept in science generally, M. DE ST. HILAIRE is,
we believe, a great Hippophagist; and if he can manage a horse-steak,
but feels a difficulty about getting through the Isthmus of Suez, we
may be pretty sure that the latter is a tough job.

THE CAT AND DOG COURT.

AIR-“ The Literary Dustman."
THERE is a Court, contrived by late
Enlightened legislation,
Where couples who each other hate
May get a separation;
The Court of Probate and Divorce,
To which, mate spouse ill-using,
The party wronged may have recourse :
Its business is amusing.
For thence we see that married life,
Is often stormy weather,
And some folks live, as man and wife,
Like cat and dog together.
Some fools there are who wed for love,
Whilst many wed for money;
Their matches were not made above :
Their moon soon fails of honey.
Then words grow sharp, and manners rough,
At length no more they smother
Their mutual ire, but kick, and cuff,
And beat, and scratch each other.
And so, &c.

Derive strange revelations,
How pairs genteel like common brutes
Behave in altercations;
They bandy curse, and oath, and blow,
And each tries each to throttle,
And if they don't the quart-pot throw,
They fling the claret-bottle.
And so, &c.
Take warning, lads and lasses too,
That are about to marry;

if they would stay and assist him. He was endeavouring to balance himself on a
tight-rope from which he was sure to get a fall."
The Illustrated Times of Saturday, December 4th, contains a
passage which is the subject of this notice; and it is to be found in a
column, headed “The Lounger at the Clubs."
“My personal experience of baronets, limited though it be, does not inculcate a
belief in them as a class. Perhaps I have not been fortunate, but of the half-dozen
with whom I have been brought into contact, one is a cynic, one a stupid nin-
com poop, one a spiteful fool, one an antiquated fogey, one a harmless chip-in-
porridge, and only one a real gentleman. Two of these live on their estates, two on
ihe reputation of their ancestors, one by bedabbling his 'bloody hand' in coal-dust
and retailiog Yorkshire slack' to London merchants, and one by his wits-and,
heaven knows, he has but a slight subsistence!”
Really, really, good MR. LOUNGER, this is rather strong. We are
not ourselves acquainted with many baronets, and consequently can-
not speak to the exact truth of your little observations. We are ready
to believe that you who, no doubt, belong to all the crack clubs of
London, and move, of course, in ‘gilded saloons of fashion,' are better
up in the subject than ourselves, but we must take leave at the same
time to protest entirely against the re-introduction of such a style, and
such a repetition of the old habits of coarse invective and abuse,
which we thought had disappeared entirely from our press.
You may possibly be unfortunate in your acquaintances, but what of
that? Is that any reason why you should take to calling men “Nin-
compoops, Chips-in-porridge,” and “Spiteful fools,” in a public
newspaper ?
Let us give you a word of advice, which our respectable old age
entitles us to give such a mere boy in periodical literature, as is the
"Illustrated Times.” Learn that coarseness is not brilliancy, that
slangy vituperation is not wit; and depend upon it you will find that
the interest the public take in your writings and the confidence they
repose in your contributions will not be one whit the less. We give you
this advice the more gladly, as we think you can do very much better
things if you will only remember a little-just a little—that a journalist
should also be a gentleman.

Whiskers are very fine at RAFAEL's, as it is frequented by most of the

THE HOUSE TELEGRAPH.
A TELEGRAPH all over London? The wires brought

Well—I don't know. There's a good deal to be said on
both sides.
It certainly would be pleasant to be within five minutes
of such a message as “Dine at the Club with me at seven;"
or “SQUATTLEBOROUGH JUNCTIONS.” at six premium
-I've sold your hundred, and paid in the cash to your
account;” or “Little stranger arrived safe this morning at
twelve, mamma and baby doing well;" and one might
occasionally be grateful for such a warning as “KITE and
POUNCE took out a writ against you this morning-Look
alive;" or "JAWKINS coming to call on you; make yourself
scarce.”
But think, on the other hand, of being within five
minutes of every noodle who wants to ask you a question;
of every dun with a "little account ;” of every acquaint-

“ SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE."
Our friend Pam has been assisting, we see by the
Times, at an Agricultural Meeting at Romsey; and from
the report of the proceedings we select the following gems
of oratory :-
DR. BEDDOME observed :-
He had the pleasure of soeing the other day a statuette, on which
were inscribed the names : 'PALMERSION-Crimea, China, India,' and
these three names would go down to posterity with the noble Lord.
His Lordship, however, could not show his moral courage by crossing
the Channel without becoming the subject of public criticism and
Yet there was this coincidence connected with his
visit to France, immediately after his return the EMPEROR OF THE
FRENCH gave a free pardon to Count MONTALEMBERT.”
Dr. BEDDOME appears to us to be rather an awkward
apologist. We wonder what he means by his Lordship’s
moral courage in crossing the Channel. Was it displayed
by his not fearing sea-sickness ? or did it require a very
great exercise of moral courage indeed to visit our well-
beloved ally? We should be inclined to suppose the latter.
It must have been very like putting your head into the
| lion's mouth.
We are glad that India, China, and the Crimea, will
go down to posterity with the noble Lord. It will be,
doubtless, a great honour for them, and one they will of
course highly appreciate, though we think they would pre-
fer to be associated with some other names, such as RAGLAN,
CLYDE, ELGIN, or HaveLOCK.
The pardoning of MONTALEMBERT, hitherto unexplained,
has new light thrown upon it by this oratorical Doctor.
No doubt he was put up as a prize at quintain, or fencing,
or skittles, or some other light and exhilarating pastime,
and was won by the noble Lord, who immediately pardoned
him off hand. We should like to know whether it was the
Bottleholder who suggested the delicate irony of making
the pardon take effect on the anniversary of the great
Napoleonic prize-fight, 2nd December, on which occasion
the EMPEROR though he hit foul managed to win.
Save us from our Friends," Pam no doubt said at
hearing the Doctor's feeble remarks, which we couldn't
explain till we found he had filled the office of Mayor six

And manners are by morals not surpassed.

And bid a would-be demagogue despair ?

Behold where proud France Freedom's banner waves,
And Austria wears the Cap of Liberty !
Ye miserable thralls, uplift your eyes
To Italy, where men indeed are men,
Where self-ruled Rome with uncurbed Naples vies
In licence of the conscience, tongue, and pen.
Look where the sovereign people yonder reigns
In Russia, ye unhappy serfs, who cower
Beneath the tyrant's frown, and hug your chains,
And kiss the rod of arbitrary power,
What, don't you feel the yoke that galls your polls,
The gyves whose gripe has cut you to the bone,
The iron, which has pierced your very souls,
Crushed by an Aristocracy and Throne ?

A fraud that made and keeps you bondsmen. Down

Where all mankind, except black men, are free;

Where Concord reigns, and Union needs must last;

We understand that preparations are already being made for the

contemplation, and noble parties will be organised for Prisoners' Bars.
Marbles will also be honoured with aristocratic patronage, and several
sets of personages of exalted rank will engage in the amusing compe-
tition of Lob-out and Shoot-ring. It is also whispered that some
Scotch Lords will condescend to play Hop-scotch. Of course, a distin.
