PREFACE
1999
YOU, who would truly be wise
, discarding all cant and all humbug;
You, who would know what is what, and also its converse-what isn't;
You, who would see through a millstone without peeping in at the hole ;
You, who incline to impart to your grandmothers skill in egg-suction;
You, who would be on a level with tabac in pulverisation ;
You, who would manifest knowledge concerning the hour on the dial;
Down on the knees of your heart, and thank Mr. Punch for this Volume.
Here
you
will find the true story, here, and in no other quarter,
(For all the historians but Punch are windbags, and blockheads, and boobies,
And further to quote T. CARLYLE, Apes from the Sea called the Dead Sea,)
Of six most eventfullest months, first half of the year Fifty-Nine.
Year of the War in the South, and the winning the Derby by Musjid ;
Year when the Oxford boat won, and Cambridge was merged in the billows;
Year MR. MILLAIS came out with those terrible nuns in the graveyard;
Year the great Ebrew composer, Beer, gave Le Pardon de Ploermel ;
Year the first fountain for drinking was set up by GURNEY, near Newgate ;
Year ALFRED TENNYSON uttered a trumpet-tongued warning to Arm us;
Year that KING BOMBA departed from out of the world he polluted;
Year that the Daughter of England gave a nice baby to Prussia ;
Year that Miss CRAIG took the prize for her Ode at the London Burns Festival;
Year that the young PRINCE OF WALES was received by the Pope in the Vatican;

PREFACE.
Year MR. PUNCH, the Avenger, kicked Mr. Cox out of Finsbury;
Year that the new Temple chambers were marked with the name of SAM JOHNSON;
Year that the fashion broke out of abusing our wives for bad dinners;
Year QUEEN VICTORIA announced that India, subdued, was HER kingdom;
Year MR. OWEN, Professor, expounded the dreadful Gorilla ;
Year that the Tories, in office, brought in another Reform Bill;
Year that such Bill was rejected, and DERBY appealed to the Country;
Year when the General Election ejected his Lordship from office;
Year that LORD PALMERSTON found himself Premier again on Whit Sunday;
Year that Sam WARREN the Poet was raised to be Master in Lunacy;
Year that the Westminster Clock began to have thoughts about going ;
Year that the gay Floral Hall rose alongside of the Opera House ;
Year the Welsh child in the Gallery howled while LORD STANLEY was speaking ;
Year that the EMPEROR NAPOLEON THE THIRD entered Milan in triumph;
Year that the Thames smelt as bad as it did in the year antecedent.
Such the events which occurred in one-half of the year Fifty-Nine;
Such, and ten million beside, in the Volume before you are noted.
Noted, but not in the fashion of Apes from the Sea called the Dead Sea;
But made texts for uncountable wealth of wit, ever blended with wisdom.
Down on the knees of your hearts, thanking great Punch for this Volume;
Rejoice that you live in a world that He condescends to enlighten ;
Shout for your Queen and your Punch, and then all go and mind your own business :
Leaving Him Watcher, Protector, Censor, Curator, Chastiser.
PUNCH.

BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
BY A SERIOUS DIARIST.
March 24. My dear daughter LAURA'S
birthday. She has pleased me very much
lately; for she has taken pains to break
with some needy relations who were in-
clined to presume upon our relationship,
and to visit us too often, and sho has
managed to offend them so gracefully
that they cannot complain, and yet can
hardly be so moan as ever to intrude
again. Also, at my wish, she has dis-
carded CAPTAIN HARDUP, and contrived
to let my rich old friend GRUB MOULDY-
WORT see that his attentions are not
disagreeable. I augur the very best for
the dear child's future ; and feeling that
I ought to do everything for her, I pre-
sented her to-day with a pair of dumb-
bells, to improve her figure. They had
belonged to my sister, deceased, but were
nearly now. May they prove beneficial !
FIRESIDE FANCIES.
Of all kinds of knowledge there is none
less backed by modesty than the univer-
sally claimed knowledge of the way to
poke the firo. In every one's opinion
there is but one right way to do it; and
in every one's opinion that right way is
their own. Were an Essay to be written
upon How to Poke the Fire, nobody would
read it without feeling quite convinced he
could have written a far better ono ; and
yet no one could get any one to coincide
with that opinion, without every one's
reserving that his own would be the best.
The fire makes a noise when something
bright pops out of it. So is it with your
Wits. They generally make noise enough
when they have shot out something bril-
liant.
Many say they love a fire for its com-
panionship : but it will not do to be on
too close terms with it. Like a certain
class of men, a fire is pleasant company,
but to be so one must keep it somewhat
at a distance.
If the fire be not poked it will get dull
and dead. Poking stirs it into life and
wakes it to a blaze. In like way too the
fire of genius might die out, were it not
stirred to action by the poker of Neces-
sity. The brightest of ideas have in this
way been poked up, and tho dullest minds
so stirred that they have shone forth
flamingly.

BEHAVIOUR IN THE BALL-ROOM.
Do not, for the purpose of creating a
sensation, accompany the musicians by
a performance on your chin. It is a
mark of vulgarity. If a dispute arises
respecting priority of engagement to a
partner, nover offer to "go the odd man"
for her.
AN UNACKNOWLEDGED PHILANTHRO-
PIST.-A Stock Exchange humourist has
observed, that every miser is, after all, a
lover of his specie.
PHYSIC FOR THE PIGS.-A gentleman
farmer, who has been inoculated with
homoeopathy, perseveres in attempting
to cure his bacon with infinitesimal
globules.
MONSTER MEETING.-A geologist assem-
bles the Ichthyosaurus, the Plesiosaurus,
the Labyrinthodon, and other contempo-
rary reptiles of the ancient world, in his
museum.
PROFESSIONAL ENTHUSIASM.-A mem-
ber of the Swell Mob, having an addition
to his domestic happiness, registers the
little stranger with an alias. The mother
of the infant sings it to rest with “ Alibi
"ADJOURNED de die in diem." -To-
morrow.
A DELICATE FLOWEP..--The rose blushes:
no wonder, considering the things that
are done under it.
A BRUTE.-Mrs. Mopes says she should
so like a little change. MOPES offers her
two-and-sixpence for half-a-crown.
THE CONTRADICTORY SEX !-A young
girl at school wisbes she could have two
birthdays in every year ; as she grows up
she wishes that she had but one birth.
day in every two years !
PENNY-WISE PHILOSOPHY - Is not
always to be despised. For instance,
ROWLAND HILL is the first philosopher,
who, being "penny-wise," proved himself

BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
BY A SERIOUS DIARIST.
April 9. My dear and worthy partner
STOGGINGS's birthday. He has been with
me for many, many years, and from his
having been a faithful and attached
clerk, I raised him to his present con-
dition of partner, nominally, it is true,
as regards profits, but with the advan-
tage of associating with me on equal
terms (though I cannot cure him-why
should Il-good fellow ! of the respectful
"Sir"), and of knowing that in the little
word, Co., is embraced, though the world
is not to know it, the word STOGGINGS.
Our truest joys are those we lock up in
our own breasts, and I am sure I do not
grudge him this. Having bought myself
& new pencil-case, I presented him with
my old one, which, if he repairs it, will
serve him well, and he was pleased to
see I remembered the day. May he
long be spared to serve me

LONDON HARBOURS OF REFUGE
(IN STORMY WEATHER).
THE Lowther and Burlington Arcades,
the Soho and Pantheon Bazaars, the
British Museum, the Opera Colonnade,
and the National Gallery. In addition to
the above, there is the Exeter Change
Arcade; but the latter is seldom resorted
to, excepting in very severe storms. The
pastrycook shops also may be looked upon
as Harbours of Refuge, but as those who
run in are bound to take provisions on
board, it is only such superior craft as
have a purser with them, who venture
inwards.
MAXIM BY A MAN OF THE WORLD.
Don't take any trouble whatever to
please your acquaintance; for the attempt
will be unsuccessful ; and nothing that
you can say or do to ingratiate yourself
with them will save you from being ridi-
culed and traduced behind your back,
If you wish to be generally respected,
treat other people with calm contempt,
and the majority of them will worship
your serene Highness. Aristocracy is
commonly revered.
A SENSATION FOR THE SERIOU8.--The
Record, in observance the irst of
April, comes out with a report of a horse-
race and a steeple-chace, a notice of a
new farce, and an account of a prize-
fight.

COLD CREAM INTER-
NALLY.
COLD CREAM is an excellent
remedy for hot coppers. It is
much resorted to by young
ladies during the London sea-
son after late dancing, lobster-
salad, and champagne, being
taken the next day, under the
name of Ice. This is a wholly
incorrect expression; ice is fro-
zen water: and water-ice is
surplusage. Every young lady
who minds her science will
ask the pastrycook for cold
cream.

S
BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
BY A SERIOUS DIARIST.
May16. My dear old MOTHER'S
birthday. Gladly would I have
made her a costly present, but
that as she is entirely taken off
my hands by my brother-in-
law, whose means are not very
large, it would perhaps cause
invidious comparisons to his
disadvantage, did I lay out any
large sum in testimony of my
love and affection. Nor would
she wish it, with her sense of
family duty, she having nothing
to leave to my children in re-
turn for what their father's li-
berality might take from then.
Yet I thought of a silver urn,
or Sèvres ornament, to be re-
stored to us when my beloved
parent's interest in sublunary
things should cease; but I have
not, alas, that confidence in
JANE's honour that would make
me certain of the restoration,
and we should not tempt the
weak. So I sent my dear pa-
rent a photograph book-mark,
representing a sacred subject,
for her Prayer-Book. Bless her!
EXASPIRATION.—The H-bone

POSITIVE EXISTENCES. -Pigs,
like facts, are stubborn things.

-Wait till your wife has put on

LEGAL REMEDY FOR LOVE. —
No sensible young

caution to secure a promise of
marriage, she will always reco-
ver in a court of law.

“That, my dear, is a crossing
that leads to the Bank."
HOW TO FIND THE DIAMETER

ADVICE TO EVENING-PARTY GIVERS.
BY ONE WHO NEVER GAVE ONE.
HAVING ascertained by measurement the exact number
of persons that your rooms will hold, proceed to issue
invitations for precisely double it.
Sow all your seedy-looking hats and great-coats in the
cloak-room, that you may reap the benefit of some one
possibly mis-taking them. Exchange is no robbery, and
may be an advantage
In hiring your musicians accept the lowest tender, with-
out making inquirias about their antecedents. It is pos-
sible you may but get some Gravesend boat Green-baizers :
in which case, like Swift's bear, your guests will dance to
none but the "gesteelest of tunes."

500 Rushes Out make One Serious Illness,

[The Reform Measure lasts one or two Sessions, according
to the House in which it is brought, and the constitu-
tion that has to be reformed. However, in a House
where there is no opposition, and the members are in
good working condition, the Reform will last a long time.

RIBALDRY REBUKED.
A GREAT deal of wit has been
wasted on the reluctance of
ladies to tell their age, and
stupid men often wonder why
women object to vame their
time of life? The reason for
that objection is, that every
lady dislikes unnecessary
words, and feels that she has
no occasion to tell what she is

tenance.

ADVICE TO EVENING-
PARTY GIVERS.
BY ONE WHO NEVER GAVE ONE.
WHEN the dancing at all flags,
solicit some young lady to
oblige you with a song. This
will greatly add to every one's
enjoyment, and you will find
the dancers set to again most
vigorously, and give no second
loophole for the chance of such
an infliction.
If you happen to have any
reputation as a wit, get up fine
old crusted jokes about tongue
and fowl, and trifle; and let
them off at intervals of not
more than two minutes to any
one who is unfortunate enough
to be in earshot.
When your guests are going
and their carriages are an-
nounced, it will be paying
them a delicate vehicular com-
pliment to bid the band strike
up the air“ Wait for the Wag-
gons !"
CARBONIC ACID. – Brown's

BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
BY A SERIOUS DIARIST.
June 23. My dear boy ROBERT's birth-
day. I think that as a loving father, it is
my duty to make a record of my grati-
tude that my children are likely to re-
ward me for my affectionate care of them.
ROBERT's school is, it is true, costly; but
I do not think that I could maintain him
much more cheaply at home, while he is
rapidly acquiring knowledge which will
soon entitle me to point out to him, dear
fellow ! that he must provide for him-
self. He is at home for the holidays, and
I am thankful to say, that at a very slight
suggestion from me, he abandoned all
ideas of fishing parties and other frivoli-
ties, and attends at my office from nine
to six every day, dusting, sorting, and
cataloguing my papers. He will complete
the work by the time he returns to school,
Gave the dear fellow a brass seal with his
initial, R, which I expressly bought or
him. Bless him !
BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
BY A SERIOUS DIARIST.
July 19: My dear Aunt Mary's birth-
day. I am always much perplexed how
to act upon this occasion ; for she is bles-
sed with wealth, and it is my duty to my
children to neglect no law ful means of
pleasing ber; but then she is occasior-
ally liable to be evilly influenced by the
worldly family of my cousin WALTER,
and might so allot her property that I
should have thrown away the seed I had
sought to sow. Happily, a middle way
was shown to me. A client who had de-
posited with me a large picture was dis-
tressed, and accepted a small sum for it,
and I presented it to my beloved relative.
If it be worthless, the blame be with him
who sold it to me, but I am unlearned
in such things, and it looks imposingly.
May it providentially prosper my cause!

BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
BY A SERIOUS DIARIST.
August 22. My_dear Niece
ALICE's birthday. Unguardedly,
in early days, when one does not
feel the responsibilities of life
as one should do, I assented to
become godfather to my dear
brother CHARLES's eldest child.
Custom has grown up between
us that I should always present
his first-born with some token
on her natal day, and Heaven
forbid that I should break that
pleasant compact, so long as
circumstances make it right to
maintain it. But I have observed
with regret certain indications
that CHARLES has not the same
command of money that he had ;
and as he stands in sponsorial
relation to my little POLLY, he
might be induced, in making a
present to her, to exceed his
means in order to equal my gift
to dear ALICE. So, with reluc-
tance, restricted myself to a
silver thimble for her. May her
industry be blessed !
SHOTS WITH A LONG BOW.
(The Weapon may be inspected in
the Armoury of Mr. Punch.)
THE old Bow Street Runners
were a police force set on foot by
MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL SCAR-
LETT, and from him they took
their title of the SCARLETT Run-
pers.
FREDERICK THE GREAT stood
eight feet in his stockings, and
his fighting weight was upwards
of five-and-twenty stone. (MR.
CARLYLE will, if required, supply
the vouchers for these facts.)
The far-famed Letters of Junius,
it has been proved, were written
by a Mr. Smith, who lived in
London sometime within the
last six centuries. (For further
identification see the Post-Office
Directory.) They were called
Junius's Letters because they were
all dated in the month of June.
The antiquity of Coachmen
may be argued from the fact
that the first thing in creation is
believed to have been a cha-os ;
which in the spelling of the
period is written otherwise a
shay-oss.
Contemporary proofs are ex-
tant in the Vatican that the
Roman Augurs were so called
because they were great bores.
The costume of the Beefeaters
in the year 1001 consisted of a
pea-green coat, with leg-of-mut-
ton sleeves and mustard yellow
trimmings. Their trousers were
of cherry colour, turned up to
the knees; and their boots were
of the kind which is now known
as Balmoral, which they were
allowed daily six hours to lace.

October 25. My dear daughter ELEA.
NOR's birthday She called on us with
her husband, whose business on the Stock
Exchange prospers, and who is every
way worthy of the dear treasure I have
confided to him. SAMUELS seems to have
been lucky in time bargains, and indeed
time is ever blessed to those who know
the value of it. He is perfectly able to
present dear NELLY with any elegancies
or comforts wbich she may require, and
there is no wisdom in expending money
needlessly. So I playfully taxed her
with having come to us to-day in the
hope of getting a present, as when she
was a little girl, at which I thought she
showed some irritation, and therefore told
her, that to punish her, her husband
should have the gift, not she; and I gave
him some shares in a railway I am pro-
moting. May it be privileged !

BIRTHDAY PRESENTS.
BY A SERIOUS DIARIST.
November 12. My dear sister ADELAIDE's
birthday. This vale of life is thickly set
with thorns, and few of us escape them.
Dear MARIA is continuously dissatisfied
that I feel it right not to let a sister's
love and faithfulness go unmarked, and a
bracelet which once I bestowed on ADE-
LAIDE has often been matter of reproach.
Yet did either MARIA or ADELAIDE know
that I found that bracelet, dropped in my
office by an unworthy female client who
is transported, neither would grudge it to
the other. To-day we had an altercation,
MARIA having a fatal memory for dates,
and I was asked how much I had laid out
on my precious sister. Reproved MARIA
with severity, and left her in tears. It
is not for me to tell her that ADELAIDE
knows more of certain past transactions
than I could desire the world to know.
Called on dear ADELAIDE, and gave her
Aunt BETTY's garnets, ou the understand-
ing she got them reset, and was silent on
the subject. May she keep so !

ALMANACK FOR 1859.
FIRESIDE FANCIES.
My Son, there are two ways of putting coals upon the
fire. Where Extravagance takes the shovel, Thrift uses
the tongs. So is it with money. Many use a handful
where a pinch would be sufficient.
From the time of the Old Romans the hearth has been
held sacred. It had then its proper deity, and woe betided
those who dared to treat it with irreverence. So is it now
with us.
The Bright Poker is the deity of many a British
fireplace, and woe betide the husband who irreverently
handles it.
The cynics hold opinion that all friendship is deceit, and
their opinion may be backed when they stand upon the
hearth-rug. A fire is decidedly the warmest friend man
has, and yet mau often suffers from coming into contact
with it. Unless he keep a guard on it, like other of his
friends, a fire may make him burn his fingers.

our use; and as I knew the dinner at home was colder and

private room, a good fire, and a comfortable repast at the
Blue Posts. I was privileged to find all snug, and the
soup, the fish, the cutlets, the salmi, the omelette, the
parmesan, the dessert, and all the wines and liqueurs were,
I hope, blessed to me. And in looking over my diary, as I
drank my 20 port, I felt thankful that I had not only done
my duty to those near and dear to me, but had been able
to show them kindness and generosity.' Having intimated

I was undisturbed by the thought of having to move, and I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ODE ON A PORK PIE.
BY A CRUSTY OLD CHRISTMAS-KEEPER,
The seasoning how sage, the force-meat how amene!
At breakfast, with what grace,
It showed its golden face;
Nor yet at luncheon was superfluous deemed;
Nor even at dinner was it out of place,
We seemed our friend still in his gift to trace,
As if out of the crust his kindly features beamed!
We all ate of the Pie,
But none so much as I,
Ah, little of the consequence I dreamed!
Though of the Pope that holds St. Peter's chair,
Little I know, and less than little care,
Still, “Pie? oh! no—no!” since last night has been my cry,
And“Pie? oh! no-no!” still-while life shall last-say İ!
Oh, that Pork Pie !
What had I done, hard-hearted friend,
That up from Yorkshire thou should'st send
Freighted with Indigestion dire,
And Heart-burn's acrid ire, -
In fortress-crust of golden dye,
Tempting to nose, and gladsome to the eye,
Engrailed with scallop, and set round with spire
Of heaviest paste, made heavier yet with fire
That Christmas mockery ?
So came within the walls of Troy,
Greeted with blind acclaim of joy,
The Grecian horse that held
Within its womb concealed,
The warrior band whose hostile ire,
Did with Minerva's hate conspire
Proud Ilion to destroy!
But no Laocoon raised a warning voice,
Shrieking “ Lament!” when others bade “Rejoice!"
Over this porky snare,
Within whose trait'rous lair-
Bedded in golden yokes, and forcemeat choice-
Stood stalled the ghastly Mare
Of Night, that lifts the hair,
When, by the hag Dyspepsia bestrode,
Across the sleeper's breast she draws her crushing load,
Or drags him at her tail
Through park and over pale,
Or, down the precipice's awful steep
Or, in the briny bosom of the deep,
Till Terror doth o'er sleep prevail,
And starting up we quail,
And goose-skin rigors rise, and o’er our members creep!
Such dreams to-night were mine:
Their source, oh friend! too surely I divine :
It was this flaky death, this Christmas gift of thine !
If before Bosworth's fight,
The crook-back RICHARD passed a night
As bad as mine, or worse,
'Twas that the haunting curse
Of murdered victims poisoned sleep's sweet source.
But I-what had I done,
To porcine sire or son,
Whose greasy limbs within that crust repose,
That ghostly pettitoes
Should trot my duodenum o’er,
Like the familiar floor
Of the low stye which, when in life, they trod?
That phantom snouts should root, and tusks should prod
My stomach's inmost hold ?
That gristly tails should fold,
And mottled sausages entwine,
In still-beginning, never-ending line,
This scorched esophagus of mine ?
Wherefore meseemed the bed whereon I lay,
Was with polonies stuft and saveloys ?
Why that continual noise,
Of swinish grunts, that vexed the slow sad night away?
Friend of the fatal gift,
'Twas thou the hand didst lift
Against the porkers of that pie accurst;
And thine the penance should have been,
The Indigestion keen,
Heart-burn and Flatulence, and-worst-
The dead dull weight, that all night long has been
Burd’ning my midriff, bred of fat and lean,
And still like lead doth hang--
The fevered pulses that like hammers clang-
The Night-mare's gallop, urged by dire Dyspepsia's gang-
Not mine, not mine the Pie-Oh, wherefore mine the Pang!
And yet I needs must own,
Out of my groan,
How cunningly 'twas spiced; combined how well,
Of luscious fat and firm grey lean;
How from each jellied dell,
White-globed, and gold-yoked pullet-eggs did swell,
Lightening what else too heavy would have been;
How rich, how flaky, yet how firm the crust;
Sprinkled how tenderly the pepper's dust;
A CASE OF REAL DISTRESS.
For a reason we shall mention, we think the same young gentleman
is interested in each of the two following advertisements, which we
find next to one another in the Times of the 18th :-
E ,

receive them, with his CAPE, by sending the one TAKEN by MISTAKE, to Messrs.

a
hair, short legs, a white patch on his breast, and a capital beggar. Any person
who will bring the same to the Hermitage, B-, or to 23,
shall receive
a REWARD of TWO POUNDS.
Of course we may be wrong; but we really can't help fancying that
a gentleman who wears, or, as he would rather phrase it," sports” an
Inverness Cape, and carries a short pipe and bit of toffee in his pocket,
would be just the boy to keep an ugly “beggar” of a dog, with long
hair and short legs and a white patch on his breast, and having lost his
precious pet, would be green enough to advertise it.
After all, however, we must not be too hard on him. Down in the
mouth as he now must be, we should refrain from making hits at him.
Let us pity his small weaknesses, and grieve for his great sorrows.
Poor fellow! Only think, ladies, what a loss he has sustained ! Cape
and cutty, dog and toffee, all are lost now! Like Macduff, he is
bereaved of all his pretty ones at one fell swoop. Alas, misfortunes
ne'er come singly. Let us trust that in his Cape there is Good Hope
of recovery, not only of those valuables, the pipe and piece of toffee,
but of the white be-patched Scotch pet, whose preciousness is
moderately valued by his master at a price which is equivalent to the
purchasc-money of one hundred and sixty of our Almanacks.
Striking and Kicking.!
In the Halifax Courier we are sorry to see the following announce-
ment:--
“ STRIKE NEAR TODMORDEN. –The mule spinners employed at MESSRS. ORMEROD'S
new factory, Walsden, turned out on strike on Thursday morning."
We trust that the mule spinners will not discover that in turning
out on strike they have rejected the better part of their nature, and
made asses of themselves,

THERE was a young gallant, of strong martial bent,
A juvenile hero, on glory intent;
The blood of a warrior ran hot in his veins ;.
A full heart was his, but he bore empty brains.
This hero that would be, since now some twelve moons,
A Cornetcy sought in a troop of dragoons;
But he first had an examination to pass.
For now a horse-regiment can't let in an ass.
So what did our hero in such a hard strait,
Impassable quite with his ill-furnished pate ?
He just went and borrowed another man's head,
A substitute hiring to pass in his stead.
The substitute stood the ordeal at once,
And passed in the name of our valiant young dunce,
Who obtained thus by proxy a first class degree ;
His commission he bought, and gazetted was he.
The knave he had been fool enough to suborn
Soon fixed in the young dragoon's saddle a thorn;
The threat of exposure hard bought off, and then
Renewed, and bought off, and repeated again.

Until he could buy off the rascal no more,

Peached forth with on the dupe that had ceased to yield prey.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DREAM OF JOHN BRIGHT.
'Twas on the closing of the year,
About the time of Yule,
Came four-and-twenty loose M.P.S
Tale-telling out of school;
There were some that raved, and some
behaved
Like old Lords of Misrule.
They talked about with reckless minds;
Reformers thick and thin :
All old-world caution laughod to scorii,
Called moderation sin:
Bade folks kick British notions ont,
And Yankee ones take in,
65
Such gen’ral shying ne'er was secu
Since knock-me-downs began;
They turned to mirth rank, wealth, and worth,
As but mob-flatterers can:
But the leader sat apart from all,
A melancholy man!
His broad brim off: his vest apart :
No tie his neck to squeeze:
In négligé unquakerlike,
And with spirit ill at ease,
As a tar who finds he's raised a gale
By whistling for a breeze.
Tired of distorting facts, to fig.
-ures tired of playing cook,
He fumed, he fretted: springing up,
Some moody turns he took.
When lo! he saw a small M.P.,
That pored upon a book!
In what book read you, thus intent?
Progress's Tale, by Philp in ? *
-Progress! Oh, happy they, their faith
Who on the word can still pin !-"
The small M.P. looked up, and said,
“I'm reading Johnny Gilpin."
The leader took six hasty strides-
(To such strides he was prone :)
Six hasty strides beyond the place,
Six hastier back anon:
And down he sat by the small M.P.,
And talked to him of John.
While they have much ado to hold
The saddles they bestride,
Nor more control the steed they sit,
Than vessels do the tide :
It is the team has bolted: they
Are passengers inside.
“And well,” quoth he, “I know for truth
Their pangs must be extreme;
Stokers, who find they're stopped the valves,
When they wish to shut off steam-
For why--methought I was such an one
But last night-in a dream.
A Brummagem CROMWELL I would be,
And to the Speaker's face
As a fool's-cap treat his reverend wig,
As a bauble mock his mace.
Yes: now, said I, the old House shall die,
And a new House take its place.
Two monster meetings at Birmingham,
At Manchester but one;
A talk at Glasgow and Edinburgh,
And then the deed was done:
There lay the old Parliament defunct,
And I was the great gun!
“ There lay the old Parliament defunct,
And I had drawn the bill!
But, oh! the pricks and qualms I felt
When I had wrought my will:
There seemed a life in the Old House,
Not even I could kill.
“I thought of all my triumphs there,
In Coru-Law fights of fame;
Ten thousand thousand memories
Seemed to be crying “Shame!'
I took my COCKER in my hand,
But the figures went and came.
And now for my new Commons' House
The writs went through the land;
Which I had parcelled out in squares,
Symmetrically planned:
With household suffrage and ballot-box,
That numbers might command.
“ The new House met: a motley set:
The place I hardly knew:
What with Coxes multiplied by ten,
And the Pope's brass band by two.
The old House had few working men,
But none at all had the new !
" Yet where the old House passed one bill,
The new one, it passed three:
For as all were of one way of thinking,
They didn't disagree.
And the know-nothings and the havc-nothings
Worked well in companie.
" And first they voted each Member
Should have his pound a-day;
And then they voted the National Debt
Should be sponged clean away;
And they organised labour on the plan
Of no work and good pay.'
“I urged them to clap on the break;
I swam against the stream:
But was called a bloated aristocrat,
Puffed out by blood and steam-
My good M.P., remember, this
Was nothing but a dream.
They roted the peoples of the earth
What the French call solidaire ;
Went in for oppressed nationalities,
Big or little, dark or fair ;
I called for diminished armaments,
But I found myself nowhere.
“ The Income-Tax they doubled sooni
In country and in town:
Why should not the rich, they asked, pay up
A shilling in the crown?
I quoted M CULLOCH and Adam SMITII,
But was instantly coughed down.
The old Trade-Combinations
Next reared their heads and thrived;
The statutes against Forestallers
And Regraters' were revived:
I saw Protection's old flag brought out,
And for shame 'neath the benches dived !
"O Lord! to think of their wild schemes,
And mine so right and fair ;-
Retrenchment, non-intervention,
Frec-Trade, and Laissez faire !
Where were my hopes from the House I had
made?
And Echo answered, “Where?'
“I had raised a power I could not guide;
Like Gilpin, of whom you read;
I meant to stop at Birmingham,
And got Lord knows where instead.
And the more I pulled at my horse's reins,
The straighter he kept his head.
I couldn't appeal to Knowledge;
Household suffrage drown'd her cry:
I couldn't appeal to Wealth or Worth,
Or Rank their power to try ;
The ballot to all such influences
Had given the go-by.
“ Then down I cast me on my face,
And did my best to weep:
And I wished the Old House alive again,
And the New One fathoms deep-
But 'tis easier to lose the road,
Than back to it to creep!
Oh, me--that frothy, fussy House
Besets me now awake-
Coxes and WILLIAMSES by scores,
With each a speech to make;",
And ERNEST JONESES at intervals,
The monotone to break!
“ And still no peace to my tortured soul
Will night or day allow;
That dreadful New House haunts my life-
I'm sitting in it Now!”
The scared M.P. looked up and saw
Huge drops upon his brow.
That very night while his platitudes
That M.P.'s audience hissed,
A stout Quaker took train for Rochdale,
And resumed the spinning of twist.
And if John Bright bring in no bill,
I can't say 'twill be miss'd.

MITCHEL AND MADNESS.
MR. MITCHEL, celebrated for the oil of vitriol
which he used to pour on the troubled waters
of poor old Ireland; for being transported,
escaping to America, and trying to make the
country that shelters him too hot to hold him,
declares himself, according to the New York
Times, the sole member of his party, and calls
himself the United Irishman. The constitution
of this truly Irish party will inevitably break
up. The belly and the members will disagree,
the head and the heels will want to change
places, the whole system will become disor-
ganised, and go to pieces. Before that consum-
mation arrives, however, the party ought to be
put in a strait-waistcoat; because it is a man
beside himself: lest one side of it should throw
vitriol on the other side, or run it through with
a pike, and thus the United Irishman should
commit suicide with the view of saving his
own life.
The Results of Hippophagy.
A BERLIN gentleman has eaten so much
horseflesh lately, that his nature is becoming
rapidly altered." He went to a farrier's the
other day to be measured for a new pair of

his wife finds the greatest difficulty in reining

the poor man partook so largely, must have

EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF WHALES.
We have been informed by our Æsop, that a meeting
of Whales took place the other day off a large iceberg in
the Arctic regions to take into consideration the probability
of their speedy extinction in case of the much longer con-
tinuance of hoop and spring petticoats. The meeting was
rather thinly attended, in consequence of the number of
Cetacea which have been lately destroyed for the sake of the
Whalebone which they supply for the manufacture of Crino-
line, or some of its machinery; A great bottle-nosed
Whale stated that the price of whalebone had risen to full
four times the amount which it cost previously to the
outbreak of the Crinolinomania. According to a Physeter
macrocephalus, spermaceti had risen as high as whalebone
for the same reason, and there would very soon be an end
of ointment if the ladies went on causing the existing
consumption of Whales. Several Whales complained bit-
terly of the EMPRESS OF THE FRENCH for setting the fashion
which is threatening to destroy them from off the bosom of
the ocean, and threw torrents of ridicule on the ladies of
England for the servility and sheepish or gooselike gre.
gariousness with which
they imitate her. A Narwal wished

that he derived some consolation for his bereavements and

deadly to the Whales, it was also suicidal to the wearers;
and that it was better to be harpooned than burnt to death.

THERE was once a little farmer
Living underneath the mountains;
Underneath the Alpine shadows,
In the land called Pié di Monte.
There the little farmer, VICTOR,
VICTOR, son of CARL ALBERTO,
Aided by Cavour, his bailiff,
Kept his little farm in order;
Kept his little patch of garden,
With its rows of Savoy-Cabbage,
Trimmed his little bush of laurel,
Reared his little row of pig-sties,
Reared his little row of hen-roosts.
It befel one winter morning
There was trouble in the pigsties;
Grunting of the boar, Humphrumpha,
Squealing of the sow, Pigwiggin;
There was fluttering in the hen-roosts,
Crowing of the cock, Cochino,
Clucking of the hen, Dorkinga,
Fluttering of the bantam, Sebright.
Grunting, squealing, crowing, clucking,
That the little farmer wakened
From his snoring 'twixt the blankets,
From his snoozing in the feathers,
Poked his head out of the
window,
Far as his moustachios suffered-
His moustachios, red and foxy,
Like two marling-spikes protruded-
Poked his head out of the window,
To discover what the shindy :
Wherefore grunts the boar, Humphrumpha ?
Wherefore squeals the sow, Pigwiggin ?
Why such flutter in the hen-roosts ?
Crowing of the cock, Cochino,
Clucking of the hen, Dorkinga,
Fluttering of the bantam, Sebright?
Soon his eye discerned the reason ;
Hovering grim outside his hedgerow,
Gathered as in act of swooping,
Saw he Austria, the Vulture,
BETWEEN THE EAGLES.
Black of plume and double-headed.
Vulture, whom irreverent sailors,
Sailors heraldry ignoring,
Split-crow” oftenest entitle.
Very angry waxed the farmer,
VICTOR, son of CARL' ALBERTO,
To Cavour the bailiff called he:
Take thy gun, Cavour the bailiff,
Lo, 'tis Austria, the Vulture!
Double-beaked and iron-taloned,
Lean of head and herring-gutted.
With designs both black and bloody,,
Gainst our hen-roosts and our pig-sties,
Hovers she so near our borders.
Not without the best of reasons
Grunteth sore the boar, Humphrumpha,
Squeaketh shrill the sow, Pigwiggin,
Croweth clear the cock, Cochino,
Clucketh wild the hen, Dorkinga,
Flutters fierce the bantam, Sebright.”
As he spoke he donned his garments,
Garments of a martial fashion :
Never was so fierce a farmer-
Pigeon-breasted as to bosom,
And wasp-waisted as to middle,
With moustachios red and foxy,
Like two marling-spikes set cross-wise,
And a marling-spike of beard, too,
At right angles to his moustache.
So came Victor from the cottage,
Victor, son of CARL' ALBERTO,
Full of wrath against the Vulture,
Waiting till Cavour the bailiff
Fetched the gun wherewith to shoot him.
When high o'er him rang the hurtle
As of pinions wide and waving,
And up-looking to his right-hand,
And up-looking to his left-hand,
Either side, he saw an Eagle-
One was ashy-grey of feather,
Worn he looked and somewhat draggled,
-A Robert Macaire of Eagles-
But with eye of latent mischief,
And with talons sharp though sheathèd ;
Black the other was and burly,
Double-beaked, and armed his pounces,
One with sword and one with sceptre;
Somewhat puzzled looked the farmer,
At this affluence of Eagles,
Wondering if inspired by hunger,
Hankering for the boar, Humphrumpha,
Craving for the sow, Pigwiggin,
They thus hovered near his borders,
Fear not,” quoth the ash-grey Eagle,
With the eye of latent mischief,
“ Not for plunder came we hither ;
Not like Austria, the Vulture;
Not for pigs, and not for poultry,
But for aid and for protection.
I am called the Eagle, Louis,
At Boulogne I imped my pinions :
Caged at Ham I burst my fetters,
Soared to the Elysée Bourbon,
Thence unto the Tuileries flying,
There I hold my giddy eyrie;
Swooping whence I come to aid thee,
Guard thy pigs and guard thy poultry,
From foul Austria, the Vulture :
With the Eagle, ALEXANDER,
Eagle from the banks of Neva,
From the muddy flats of Azoff,
And the ice-cliffs of the Irkutsk.
We are here with common purpose
To defend thy pigs and poultry,
From foul Austria, the Vulture,
We are proof against temptation,
Be it pig or be it turkey,
Goose or duckling, hen or chicken ! ”
So, with folding of their pinions,
Sharp of beak and keen of talon,
Gravely stooped the brace of Eagles
Either hand the little farmer,

FINE IDEAS.
WRITING from Stockholm, a correspondent of the Daily News begs
its readers to “take notice" that,
“ The fines dictated by the Swedish statutes for cruelty to human beings, and
which are at this moment in full vigour, are as follows :-For a foot chopped or struck
off, 25 dollars banco (a Swedish dollar banco is 1s. 8d. sterling); an ancle, 25 dollars
banco; a toe, 8 dollars banco; an arm, 10 d. b. a leg, 10 d. b.; a nose, 40 d. b. ; a
hand, 40 d. b.; an ear, 40 d. b.; a thumb, 25 d. b.; a forefinger, 17 d. b,; an eye,
40 d. b.; if the eye is of enamel or glass (incredible, but true !) 60 d. b. , a broken
head, 10 d. b. ; a tooth knocked out, 6 d. b.; small wounds, each 1 d. b. ; a box on
the ear, 1 d. b. The sufferer must not be a member of the Storthing (or Parliament).
at least during the Session, as any such attack at that period, and in the city of
Stockholm, is considered as high treason, and punishable as such.”
As we in England are requested to "take notice” of the paragraph,
we presume the law of Sweden would affect us if we went there, and
that whatever injuries our persons might sustain, would be valued
according to the tariff above quoted. If this be so, the Swedish law
is not without some moment to us; and it comes within our province
to vote for its amendment. We are at present well content to have
our residence in England, bad as are the dinners which the Times tells
us we get here. But should anything turn up to make us live among
the Swedes, it is as well we know the price which they will set upon
our heads, 'in case we are unfortunate enough to get them broken
there. We must confess, however, that the passage we have cited is
based upon a notion of comparative anatomy, which, if we happened to
be hurt, we should certainly protest against. We would not take ten
shillings to have one of our teeth knocked out, nor would we have our
ears boxed for so small a sum as eightpence, unless the boxer were a
female, and the loveliest as well as lightest-handed of her sex. That a
glass eye should be valued more highly than a real one appears to us to
be an optical delusion, and why an arm may be cut off for a fine of but
ten dollars, while a hand is priced precisely at four times that amount,
is a puzzle which to English brains is quite incomprehensible, clear as
it may seem to the turnip headed Swedes. If one's arm be "chopped
or struck off," one's hand must needs go with it: yet for the greater
injury, the less fine is imposed, which in whatever light we view it
seems to us an imposition.
The law making it high treason to hurt members of the Storthing,
shows us in what reverence the Swedes hold their M.P.s, and how far
advanced in that respect they are before the English. But much as
you may praise it, oh! be thankful, fellow-countrymen, that no such law
is yours; else, think what a calamity would long since have befallen
you. The nation would ere this have been in mourning for its Punch !
for if it were high treason to make cuts at our M.P.s, Punch would
long ere this have paid the penalty for doing so.

It fell about the Christmas tide, when graziers kill their beeves,
When hall and hut are hung around with the holly's glossy leaves,
When turkey, chine, and pudding plump present a goodly show,
And many pleasant things are done beneath the mistletoe;
And so they laughed, and joked, and quaffed, and chirruped o'er their
wine.

And still the three full jauntily submitted to the din,
And to that Tower of Crystal sheen right swiftly made repair,
Through the pleasant glades of Forest Hill
, and of Penge the hamlet And in the sky the sun was high, yet still The Three sat on.
The sun went down, the moon went down, the starry dark had gone,

A gleemaiden came tripping in, and, as she twang'd her lute,

And down these reiving troubadours like corn in harvest mowed,
And well his brothers kept their posts, and stood that minstrel shock,
As Eddystone hurls back the surge that raves around his rock.
And back before their strokes the tide of minstrel battle rolls,
Some shriek for help to salve their shins, some for priests to shrive

CABS AND COFFINS.
NOTICE
DIVINE
SERVICE
An inquirer in the Times keeps on continually
asking, as though the question were a riddle
which he defied the world to guess :-
WHY ARE CABS USED FOR FUNERALS?
To this we feel inclined to make echo. Why,
indeed! The only reasons we can think of for
using cabs for funerals are, that some infection
may probably be spread by them, doctors' bills
made longer, and funerals increased. Doctors
and undertakers are, we think, the only persons
whom the practice can advantage, and to the
former of these classes it is of doubtful benefit,
as it is clearly to their interest that the census
should increase, and that their patients be kept
living as long as they can pay for it. Now the
sickness which is spread by using cabs as hearses
is more likely to diminish than to swell the cen.
sus; and as children are more prone to infection
than adults, our surgeons lose the profit of
many a grown-up patient, by the patient, when
in long clothes, being put into a cab, and there
getting what in no long time will prove its
deathstroke. The doctors therefore should pe-
tition for an Act of Parliament against using
cabs for funerals; inasmuch as they (the cabs)
are thus made vehicles of infection which any

think is a style of advertisement that is beautifully precise, charmingly
illogical, and tantalisingly biographical.
The precision is apparent throughout. You are told that the chariot
is "yellow;" that it has "front and back seats;" and is the produc-
tion of a “first-rate maker,” as most chariots that are advertised for sale
generally are. We wonder the advertiser did not carry the love
of precision even further, and inform us of the weight of the chariot,
the number of nails used in its construction, the united ages of all the
persons who have ridden in it, and whether it has any objection to
travel.
The illogical feature (it is the first chariot we have seen with an
Irish bull yoked to it) is traceable in the two facts, that the carriage
was built in London,” and yet “has never been twelve miles from
Dublin.” The distance between the two capitals must have shrunk
terribly recently-and perhaps it is the action of the sea-water that has
caused the shrinking or else Irish miles must stretch almost as
much as Irish traitors' consciences.
The biographical department, however, carries away the prize. We
are pleased to hear, for her health's sake, that the “lady preferred an
open carriage;" though it grieves us to hear that "lätterly she has
only kept one horse." This, however, has a look of carefully-studied
economy about it. Wise is the woman who, going too fast, has the
courage to pull up in time, - even though it be with only one horse !”
But the biography is not carried out half fully enough. We should like
to have been favoured with more glimpses of this lady's secret habits
and wishes. Why could not the advertisement have been amplified

i
and, as he fondly thought, invincible Guard, went down before the sons of Lochaber,
and the children of the country which boasts of Schehallion and the glories of
Lochnavar. By one who was present and engaged on that bloody day, I was told
that at one point of the battle the conflict was fiercely raging, when a command was
given, Make way for the Greys.' The order was obeyed. The infantry parted
right and left. The war-horses of the Greys marched through the space opened for
them with steady and martial tramp. They met the French : and, in ten minutes,
the French were cut to pieces.”
7 MARSHALL proves that England has no national poet; no national
music; no national song ; that all her odes, history, and metaphysics, are
written by Scotchmen :-
“Notwithstanding the greatness of her SHAKSPEARE, and her MILTON, England,
Sir, has not, in the proper sense of the word, a national poet. Scotland has ; she
has BURNS. England has neither national music nor national song. Scotland has
both. In the whole range of her poetic literature, will England find anything to
equal Scots wha hae ui' Wallace bled, or the Cotter's Saturday Night ?' Can she
match ® Auld Lang Syne ?'-a song which is sung with enthusiasm, in far and dis-
tant lands, by every man who has drawn his first breath at the foot of the Gram-
pians, near the waters of the Doon, or on the banks of the
Tweed.
There are two magnificent odes of which England boasts, Ye Mariners of
England and the Battle of the Baltic'-but who wrote them? A Scotsman. That
Scotsman was THOMAS CAMPBELL, the author of the . Pleasures of Hope.'
"When England required her history to be written, she sent to Scotland for an
historian. That historian was HUME. MACAULAY, whose brilliant history has
recently appeared, is a Scotsman. DUGALD STEWART was a Scotsman; and it is but
as yesterday since SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON, the first metaphysician in Europe, passed
away. SIR DAVID BREWSTER and ROBERT CHAMBERS, men of world-wide celebrity,
still survive to surround with a halo of lustre the name of their country. And yet
we are told by the Times that Scotland is nothing more than is the fenny county of
Lincoln, or the bullock-feeding county of York.'
MARSHALL smashes England generally, and raises up Scotland upon the
ruins :
"The ignorance of England is notorious; the intellectuality and educational
acquirements of Scotland are proverbial. One half of the inhabitants of England
are unable either to read or write; in Scotland there is not a cow-boy nor a house-
maid who cannot read the Bible, and lift the pen to communicate with a distant
friend."
MARSHALL retorts with a crushing sarcasm the English calumny that
Scotchmen always move southwards :-
“The English are in the habit of taunting Scotsmen with going into England and
of never returning to their own land. There are many thousands of Englishmen
THE THIN END OF THE WEDGE.
who crossed the Tweed and took up their abode at a place called Bannockburn, and
who have remained there for upwards of three hundred years without the slightest
appearance of their revisiting the land of their fathers till the day of doom."
“SOUND HIGH THE MARTIAL STRAIN.”
Even MARSHALL is merciful. The Battle of Bannockburn having been
fought A.D. 1314, MARSHALL modestly describes the interval between
conquered : Caledonia has found a vindicator : England may shut up! intruders have in truth, been trespassing on the Scottish soil for

significant character.

that the Royal Academicians were to be turned out of the National
Gallery, Trafalgar Square, and that they were to have a new place built
for them in the grounds of Burlington House. And as the PRINCE OF

(who has given him a mosaic table) will want Marlborough House in
the autumn, the VERNON pictures and the TURNER pictures must in
their turn decamp. So they go to South Kensington for the present.
LORD BURY is quite determined that we shall be allowed to marry
our wives' sisters, and to-day introduced a new Bill permitting it. Of
the opposition to that Bill, Mr. Punch has said the most severely con-
temptuous thing, when he has mentioned that the leading opponents
were MR. GEORGE BOWYER, MR BERESFORD HOPE, and MR. HENRY
DRUMMOND-—a queer trio, illustrating Faith, Hope, and Charity. A
majority of 155 to 85, in favour of the Bill, showed the numerical
opinion of the House, and an examination of the names will show that,
LORD Bury had with him not only the noses but the brains.
MR. EWART tried in vain to get the House to pledge itself not to sit
after twelve on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This arrangement was
intended to enable Members' wives to command their husbands'
attendance at the Opera-house, with the umbrella and cab, and it was,
of course, needless to include Saturday, as though there is an opera,
there is no house on that night. But LORD PALMERSTON thought
that the ladies might manage for themselves, and rudely called the
proposal “a self-denying ordinance.” It was rejected by 237 to 28.

Oh, dear, what exciting announcements

To the intresting fact that LORD CRANSTOUN,

What care I for Begum or Nana,
What care I for Tantia Topee,

Of Sir W. FRAZER, M.P. ?

For “elegant vessel," we may safely trust that HERR Lux would,
had his dictionary knowledge of English been equal to his unaffected-
ness, have put "pretty pot.”
She that might propose to use HERR LUX's pomatum could be at no
loss how to do so, being told to rub her hide with
it till the most of
grease is sucked up. Much less intelligible to her would be the
direction which a domestic salvemonger would have given her to
"apply the unguent with manual friction until the majority of its
oleaginous particles are absorbed.”
We admire the advertisement of HERR LUX so much that we could
almost rub our own hide with his pomatum every morning, instead of
scrubbing it with yellow soap and a brush of hogs' bristles. We com.
mend his style to the study of our advertising perfumers; whose puffs
produce in our nostrils an effect precisely the reverse of that which the
articles cried up in those nauseous manifestos are designed to excite.

German, and eschew their condemnable miminipiminivity and
idditiosity.
MINISTERS RETIRED FROM BUSINESS.
It is a curious thing for a Minister, when out of office, to occupy his
leisure, like Mons. Guizot, by writing a learned book upon L'Amour.
We can hardly picture to ourselves an English Premier throwing his
idle moments into the investigation of such a subject as Love—unless it
should be our noble LORD PALMERSTON, who ought to possess a deep
knowledge of the sweet mystery, if we may judge from the fact of his
rejoicing, for upwards of half-a-century, in the playful cognomen of
Capid ?

familiarised with British puffs will doubtless be pleased with an
example of German English advertising literature subjoined :-

bed, one take a little of that pomatum, and rub 10 or 15 minutes on the hands or
others parts of hide, till the most of grease is sucked up. After a quarter of an hour,
one wash the rubed parts with warm soap-water, and dry it than with a fine
handkerchief.

CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE.
Our facetious contemporary, the Illustrated Times, has been printing
riddles lately in the place of criticism. One of these we find in the
following remarks, having reference to a picture in the British
Institution :-
“ A Mr. Burgos gives His notions of Spanish life, which, I need hardly say, are
not quite so satisfactory as MR, PHILLIPS', and anything more unpleasant than the
attempted imitation of this great master's style cannot be conceived."
With the kind view of calling to console poor MR. BURGOS, and to
ask him how he felt after this critical attack, we turned to the cata-
logue to find out his address, and were puzzled by discovering that his
name was not inserted. We next consulted the Directory, and were
perplexed still more by finding there was no such never a person.
In despair then, but resolved on the unravelling of the riddle, we paid.
a visit and a shilling in Pall Mall, to try and see the picture which had
roused the critic's wrath. We speak with some slight diffidence (not
being a critic), but by patience and an eye-glass we think that we
discovered it in “No.78," in which a Spanish subject is undoubtedly
depicted, and which bears in the corner the initials of the artist, with
the addition "Burgos, 1858.” Remembering that Burgos is a town
in Spain, we then thought that we could solve the enigma which had
puzzled us, and could guess why Burgos, being a town in Spain, was
not to be found in the London Directory. Had we thought of this
before, we might have saved ourselves the hunt; but then who would
ever dream of a critic writing riddles, and miscalling an artist by the
name of a place ?
HERE has been a

other
dinners differing
from our customary roast-beef, mutton, veal-and-ham, chops and
steaks, potatoes, greens, apple-tart, plum-pudding, bread-and-cheese
and celery. It is surprising that no gastronomer has hitherto
proposed to revive the “Dinner after the manner of the Ancients,"
of which so appetitive a description occurs in Peregrine Pickle.
For an epicure who is disgusted with his sirloin, what can be more
tempting, what more likely to prove savoury and succulent, than
a nice dormouse pie? Our gormandisers all seem partisans of the
French romantic school—they might, for a change, cultivate a classical
taste, remaining as remote as ever from the prejudices of the British
palate. But we must not indulge in too much talk about eating, which
on the sensitive stomach is calculated to produce an effect which is the
reverse of that process.
THE LAWYER'S TEAR.
Shed on the First Reading of Sir H. CAIRNS' Bill to simplify the
Title to Landed Estates.
UPON his heel he turned,
To take a last fond look
At the deeds by which such pretty sums
He had contrived to book.
Those abstracts too he eyed,
Which Cairns away would clear:
And the lawyer sadly turned aside,
And wiped away a tear !
He thought: “Alack! O law!
If thus they dock our fees,
Ere long thy votaries 'tis plain
Will scarce earn bread and cheese ;
Some pleasant six-and-eight
Will daily disappear ;
And who will o'er our beggared state
Let fall the pitying tear ?
“ Recovery and Fine
Have long abolished been,
JOHN DOE and RICHARD Rós have both
Been banished from the scene;
More costly fictions still
,
Hard truth! will disappear :
And all in vain the lawyer will
Implore the client's tear.”
A second here he shed,
Oh, do not deem him weak!
A tear upon a lawyer's nose
Some pity should bespeak.
And yet thy grief repress,
For is the truth not clear-
When lawyers say they feel distress
A good time, sure, draws near.
SOMETHING LIKE A QUESTION.
HAPPENING to be in Court during the trial of the case DICKSON v.
LORD WILTON, Mr. Punch was much struck with the briefness, neat-
ness, and precision of the questions which HER MAJESTY's Attorney-
General, SIR F. KELLY, put to the witnesses. One of these questions
was so beautifully epigrammatic, that Mr. Punch could not help taking
a note of it, that he might preserve it as a model for cross-examining
Counsel. The punctuation is exactly Sir FITZROY'S:-
“Now COLONEL DICKSON will you be kind enough-I hope that you will indulge

THE BEST SEWING MACHINE.
The very best Sewing Machine a man can
have is a Wife. It is one that requires but a
kind word to set it in motion, rarely gets
out of repair, makes but little noise, is seldom
the cause of a dust, and, once in motion, will
go on uninterruptedly for hours, without the
slightest trimming, or the smallest personal
supervision being necessary. It will make
shirts, darn stockings, sew on buttons, mark
pocket handkerchiefs, cut out pinafores, and
manufacture children's frocks out of any old
thing you may give it; and this it will do
behind your back just as well as before your
face. In fact, you may leave the house for
days, and it will go on working just the same.
If it does get out of order a little, from
being overworked, it mends itself by being
left alone for a short time, after which it re-
turns to its sewing with greater vigour than
Of course, sewing machines vary a
great deal. Some are much quicker than
others. It depends in a vast measure upon
the particular pattern you select. If you are

“ PROFESSOR OWEN said, that about ten years ago there was exhibited in the
Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, under the auspices of Mr. Barnum, an immense fossil
skeleton which had been brought from America by a MR. COOKE. A long com-
pounded Greek name was given to the animal whose remains it was represented to
be, and crowds were consequently attracted to see the prodigious monster.
FESSOR OWEN soon detected that this immense fossil animal with the strange Greek
name was composed of the fossil bones of three large Mastodons put together to
form one."
This Barnumised compound of pre-Adamite remains was bought for
the British Museum ; and one good Mastodon was made out of a selec-
tion of bones from those of the three imperfect specimens that con-

THE REFORM BILL.
DONE INTO HIAWATHAN VERSE BY MR. PUNCH.
If you question, if you ask him

What about this new Reform Bill,
Gives, or else preserves, the franchise. Whence, the legend adds, meek Moses
Just brought in by BEN DISRAELI,

When last year they entered office?
Who will henceforth have a franchise ? If, before, they've sent two thin men,

Let them now elect one fat man,
That the Bill has seventy clanses,
You may go and read those clauses.
Thus the self-same weight preserving
Not to mention certain schedules,
Those who do not like can lump it.

mentioned for helping to
bring her name before the
world), extracts a charming
epigram launched at the
wife of the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER by one of the set,
named T. Ross. Objecting to the Savings Bank clause in the Bill,
he said :-
“He would like to know how MR. DISRAELI would himself have fared in this
particular had he not married that rich old woman. (Laughter and Cheers.) He ques-
tioned if he would have saved twopence. (Laughter and hear, hear.) He was nothing
but a political adventurer, but it would not do this time. (Renewed cheering and
laughter.)"
This argument against the Bill was received with the favour that
might be expected. The insolent allusion to Mrs. DISRAELI was
rewarded with cheering and laughter.” That might be expected of
the people who admire St. Pancras spouters. Insult to a lady is just
the sort of illustrated logic they love. But there were two or three
gentlemen present. SIR BENJAMIN HALL, who is a gentleman, and
hopes to be a lord, was there. Why did he not tell the vulgarian
Ross that there was no necessity for brutality? MR. EDWIN JAMES,
who is not only a gentleman, but an honourable and learned gentle-
man, was there. Could he not have smashed Ross with one of the
poetical quotations so telling on juries-
“Come, you Ross,
Shut up, old hoss,"
or some such effusion ? MR. WYLD, M.P., who sells maps (and very
good ones), was there. Could he not have hinted to the fellow not to
get into such low latitude. None of them interfered, however, and

make speeches and answer for their conduct before an audience that

merchants to be transferred from the rule of the Indian Government
to that of Sir BULWER LYTTON, the Chancellor brought in a Bill for
getting rid, in great measure, of that once useful institution, but now
obstructive nuisance, the Grand Jury. He pointed out how this body
frequently prevented a proper trial being had, as in the painful case,
to which his Lordship adverted, of the poor lunatic pauper, who was
kept in a shower-bath for half an hour and then dosed with tartar
enetic, by order of a medical man named SNAPE. The Chancellor,
then Sir F. THESIGER, had strongly advised the Lunacy Commis-
sioners to inquire into SNAPE's conduct, and “one of the ablest
London magistrates” decided that the case ought to be sent for trial.
But the Grand Jury threw out the bill to the astonishment of all, and
SNAPE was not tried. LORD CHELMSFORD added some other argu-

Wednesday. LORD JOHN RUSSELL gained a triumph, -his Bill for
improving the law of Debtor and Creditor being read a second time,
and much approved. There is another Bill of the same kind, which
passed the Lords next day; and so the two are to be considered
together, or, as MR. HADFIELD might say, smultaneous. Something
was then done towards relieving the Quakers, whose feelings about
affirmation had been incautiously hurt by the Jew legislation of last
year. It is quite right to remove every kind of vexatious interference
with anybody's creed, or superstition; and as there is no more perse-
cution of Quakers, and as they have "concluded” to dress like other
people, and to talk grammar, it may reasonably be supposed that in a
few years there will be no more Quakers left; for who will care to
belong to a sect unless it is oppressed, or singular?

Hôtel de Louvre, and being an explosive shell, destroyed half Paris ;
a third attempt was equally successful, destroying the other half.
After this pretty practice, (though better has been made we must
admit) the seven-and-twenty double Leviathans, built for the transport
of troops, embarked three hundred and eight thousand volunteers,
armed with the patent self-acting, self-loading, self-aiming, and self-
cleaning gun, now universally used in the British army. They were
headed by LORDS BROUGHAM and PALMERSTON, those two surprising
veterans, who, we believe, will never grow any older, and were landed
at Boulogne at exactly 2.58 ; twenty-eight minutes after the declaration
of war. Being provided with BRAY's patent traction-engines our gallant
fellows were enabled to reach Paris in 22 minutes, and thanks to the
efficacy of the gun above alluded to, made very short work of the
inhabitants of the country they passed through. They entered Paris
(or rather what was left of it) under cover of the celebrated noxious
smoke-producing machine, which exceedingly horrified the helpless
Parisians, but which, being no thicker than an ordinary London fog,
had few terrors for the bold sons of Albion. CAPT. SMITI and the
Armstrong gun having arrived shortly afterwards, made such play on
the provinces, from the top of the column in the Place Vendôme, that
they sent telegraphic despatches at once up to town, placing themselves
entirely at the disposal of their conquerors; the last town gave in its
allegiance at 3-45, and the war was thus at an end in one hour and
forty-five minutes from its commencement. It is surprising to us that
France, who has been so repeatedly foiled in attempts of this kind,
should have again endeavoured to disturb the peace of Europe. We
had hoped that war had been entirely put an end to by the perfect
state to which we have brought our artillery and engineering The
French people must surely have forgotten, how the five small Arm-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FLATTERING TESTIMONIAL.
We understand that the English residents in Paris
intend presenting LORD COWLEY with a little testimonial,
in remembrance of his Lordship’s recent Mission to Vienna,
and the success which has attended his pacific labours. To
typify his Lordship's usefulness at Court, it is proposed the
little souvenir should assume a form rather of utility than
ornament; and we believe it will consist of a set of dinner-
napkins, which, in his Lordship’s hospitalities, will be in
constant use. We understand that the napkins will be
tastefully embroidered by the hands of those (remarkably)
select few of our fair countrywomen who have been honoured
by his Lordship with a dinner invitation. Of the designs we
are at present not at liberty to speak; but we are given to
understand that napkin "No.1" will be embroidered in the
centre with a few neat lines of compliment, setting forth
the dinner services LORD C. has done the State; and that
on napkin “No. 2" will be depicted, in raised needlework, a
portrait of his Lordship, taken from the life, as he appeared
on his return
from his late pacific mission. To give the like-
ness more effect, certain details will be added from MR.
MILLAIS' picture, and underneath will be inscribed the
explanatory words—
" Paris, March, 1859: 'De Returne of pe Dove'-Without pe

WHAT MAY BE DONE IN FIFTY YEARS.
An American paper is eloquent upon the many inven-

first half of the nineteenth century. Amongst others, may
be enumerated the following :-Punch, Steamers, railways,
the electric telegraph, gas, photography, and chloroform.
The second half of the nineteenth century scarcely pro-
mises to be so rich. Its claims to originality do not, at
present, extend much beyond-Crinoline, all-round collars,

A SHOWER OF REFORM BILLS.
Mr. H. BERKELEY, M.P., said, at Bristol :-
“Talk of not wanting Reform! Why, there was hardly a member
in the House among those 600 gentlemen who had not a Reform Bill
in his pocket."
We trust that they will remain there. A shower of
600 Reform Bills would be a legislative avalanche such
as the stoutest Reformer could not fail to be alarmed at.
The House might be effectually buried underneath the
heap, which would certainly be one way of reforming it,
in the same way that a patient is frequently cured by
being killed. Such a Radical cure as that of our national
complaints would be more than the most reckless_Radical
would like to bargain for. If these 600 Reform Bills are
really in existence, it is certainly the strongest plea we
have yet heard for an immediate dissolution. Parliament
is not safe, the nation is not safe, no one is safe, so long as
this vast amount of combustible material is allowed to
be deposited under one roof. Were any one of them to
go off, there is no calculating the amount of mischief it
might inflict; and were they all to explode, England might
be shaken to her deepest foundations. An American
senator carries about his person a revolver ;-an English
legislator, it seems, is armed with a Reform Bill. We do
not know which would be the more comfortable position,-
to sit between two loaded revolvers, or to have a Reform
Bill, charged to the muzzle with explosive principles, on
each side of you! MR. GUIDO FAWKES’ stock of gun-
powder inside the walls of Parliament is harmless as an
arsenal of brandy-balls, compared to this huge accumulation
of Reform Bills!

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
THE ARGUMENT.
HE POET PUNCH, feeling that nothing
but heroic verse can do justice to the
deeds of the Reform Battle Days, pro-
ceeds to describe the history of the
conflict in the most noble strains of
which the subject will allow. He
beginneth with Monday, the 21st
March, and continueth until Friday,
the 25th thereof.
Now Westminster's great clock, high
raised in air,
Had stricken four, had any clock been
there;
But DENISON and BARRY, dawdlers
twin,
Deny the town Big Ben's harmonious
din.
The other DENISON, the Speaker, sat
Enchaired, and guarding his three-cor-
nered' hat.
Petitions on petitions strewed the floor,
One Member brings a dozen, one a
score,
And one a hundred, which he painful drags
To fill the ever-yawning carpet-bags.
The time is past, petitioning is done,
The hour of pointed questioning begun.
But brief to-day the catechismal rite,
Quick query, answer prompt, although polite.
Bills, dealing with twelve millions, vowed to Mars
For shooting weapons, pass like shooting stars,
And Russell's nervous cough, and Dizzy's nose
Blown slightly, tell those chiefs have met to close.
Rises lithe BENJAMIN, with air sublime,
And moves the Bill be read a second time.
A single moment o’er the floor he flits;
His say is said, he takes his hat, and sits.
Then rises RUSSELL, eager for the raid,
And moves amendment to the motion made.
Not mine,” he cries, "the duty to condemn
This measure solely that it comes from them ;
For though I deem it showed a want of grace
In that minority to grasp at place,
And though I hold that it might not be wise
In such as they to raise reforming cries,
Still, give your word to sovereign or to sweep,
And that engagement you are bound to keep.
The Ministry were pledged to give a Bill,
'Twas fair to draw it with their utmost skill.
“Grave is the question, statesmen, therefore grave
Is the attention I would humbly crave.
Look well before you leap, for if you swerve,
No afterthought your bacon can conserve.
“I feel much fortified when I reflect
That even his friends to Derby's Bill object.
The thoughtful HENLEY quits the council board,
The generous WALPOLE must renounce his Lord.
“ This Bill to change the Constitution goes,
To ancient rights its authors prove them foes.
They seek to do our great Reform away,
And in the boroughs give the Tories sway.
Therefore do I denounce it, and beside,
I think a wider franchise should be tried.
The day has come, nay, I might say the hour,
When we should give the working classes power.
The Bill I view with something like disgust,
Hold it as noxious, dangerous, and unjust,
Though here and there it takes a liberal jump,
Too little leaven for so large a lump.
'Tis said they will dissolve upon this Bill;
Well, let them face the country, if they will:
I'm not afraid, but should things go awry,
On Derby heads the consequences lie.
As for the charges made against myself
That I'm ambitious, factious, or want pelf,
I'm half ashamed the rubbish to repeat.
Such bosh be blowed.” He scowled, and took his seat.
Next to the table see young STANLEY draws,
The Tories' hope: each Tory storms applause.
In a well-written speech he met the foe,
And urged 'twere dangerous to reform too low,
Our choice must lie, so argued DERBY's son,
Between a moderate Bill like this, or none.
From yonder gallery comes a voice of wail,
And woman's cheek is red, an usher's pale.
A child—what doth such infant there on high?—.
Emits a shrill and discontented cry.
Loud laughs the House: the SPEAKER, in a rage,
Sends frantic orders by a flying page,
He'll clear the Ladies' gallery. Gods! how dare
The women bring their brats to bellow there?
Some said that RUSSELL's bride had come to teach
Her boy to recollect his father's speech.
'Twas no ungraceful thought; but, far away,
The child suspected urged its harmless play.
Another mother chides her pet-alas,
Why bring that pet, O Lady of Plate-Glass!
Forgive her, SPEAKER, thou hast eyes to see.
When did plate-glass reflect a sweeter plea ?
Then, in swell garb, and most elaborate shirt,
Rose a gay youth, well known as BUNNEY STURT.
Nor smarter was his garb than his address :
He liked not much the Bill, but Russell less.
Voted with Dizzy, thought with Dizzy's foes :
Did Dizzy smile upon him when they rose ?
BURY, the Bill would bury out of sight;
KER SEYMER set himself to wallop BRIGHT;
Hebraic SALOMONs the Bill decries
As in Jewdicious. LIDDELL thinks it wise.
Then Woon his bark contributes—tis but small;
To this he would prefer no Bill at all.
Dashed the wild HORSMAN at his liberal friends,
And charged them all with party aims and ends :
He tore their battle, smashed them left and right,
And made the speech of chiefest mark to-night.
'Tis meet to tell that Mills made fight for BEN,
That KNATCHBULL.HUGESSEN did not, and then
Sad NEWDEGATE assailed with piteous cry
A Bill to please the fierce democracy;
And LORD R. CECIL urged, in language terse,
"Twere better take this Bill than wait a worse.
The dull debate's adjourned, the Senate drives
Off to its toddies, clubs, weeds, whist, or wives.
Hail, Mews, or rather hail the Hansom cab
That leaves the mews, and we're in luck to nab.
Again the House has met-debate begun,
Wilson is up, old COCKER's favourite son.
Arabian numerals at his bidding range
Against the new Mosaic-Arab change.
Convinced, not charmed, each listener marks with joy
The peroration of that Counting Boy.
For lo! upstands the Crichton of the Age,
Romancer, statesman, orator, and sage,
Playwright, translator, essayist, divine,
Historian, poet vowed to love and wine-
Of all man's brain may do 'twixt sun and sun,
What hath not EDWARD BULWER LYTTON done?
With vigorous utterance and with finished phrase
He charges home, and blow on blow he lays.
No paltry subterfuge employs his pains-
I'll give the franchise where you 'll show the brains.
To education be the suffrage free,
Impatient ignorance gets nought from me.
Beware-nor trust it-or the State may fall.”
A storm of plaudits shakes the lofty hall.
Byng, hope of Whigs, of course talks Whiggish talk,
PHILIPPS desires the RUSSELL scheme to baulk:
FORSTER, of Walsall, joins LORD John's array,
STANHOPE, North Lincoln, won't vote either way:
Dodson, East Sussex, thinks the Bill a myth,
VANSITTART, Windsor, sees its stuff and pith:
CROSSLEY 's for what he calls the working class,
KNIGHTLEY the Bill, amended, says should pass :
And gentle SIDNEY HERBERT seeks to smother
This Bill, and let LORD DERBY make another.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A rougher champion, RUSSELL, comes in view-
Now hold thine own, here stands the bold Sir Hugh.
Small reverence, John, that brave Hibernian owns
For Holland Houses and old Whig dry bones.
That awful dynasty, those gloomy nods,
And the small utterance of your frigid gods
He laughs to scorn, and tells you, to your face,
Your motion's but a trick to grab at place.
That England don't like "dodges," that just now
When all the world is waiting for a row,
Statesmen should be forbearing, candid, true,
Not hatching small devices, John, like you :
Aud all your fummery won't disguise your aim :
To get LORD DERBY's seat 's your Little Game.
How like you that from one of Erin's bairns,
(Scotch-Irish by his name) Mac CALMONT CAIRNS ?
The smart debate's adjourned, the Senate drives
Off to its toddies, clubs, weeds, whist, or wives.
The day of Woden passes; that of Thor
Beholds resumed the fight só hungered for.
The fluent MILNER GIBSON takes the plain,
And shouts to have the Bill untimely slain.
The graver ADDERLEY the House invites
To stand by property's acknowledged rights.
HEADLAM condemns—the Tory BENTINCK sees
Much in the Bill with which he disagrees;
But, adds our GEORGEY, sooner than consort
With Bright's confederate, Russell, he'll support.
Young WILLIAM DENISON, LORD LONDESBOROUGE's heir,
Opposes in a speech that's brief and fair;
LOCKE King's enraged that Ministers adopt,
His Franchise Bill, but mangled, spoiled, and chopped;
While HENEAGE DUTTON, as a Boodle should,
Supports the Bill because it is not good.
Fat Fox asserts the popular demand,
HOPE thinks the Bill, as practical, should stand.
And BERNAL OSBORNE, breaking silence, pokes
At various parties various well-meant jokes,
Condemns the measure in his off-hand way,
And blows up Cairns for blowing-up LORD J.
Then WALPOLE rises, and with anxious pains,
Why his portfolio he resigned, explains.
Raises objections to the Derby scheme,
The rights of property his strongest theme.
He hopes the Government will not be floored.
But adds that it were much to be deplored,
Were they so badly bold, so void of vows,
At such a crisis to dissolve the House.
Then on the yawning Commons' wearying sight,
Refreshing, looms the stalwart form of BRIGHT,
Coughs cease, mouths close, and men sit up to hear
The bold invective, and the telling jeer.
They look for show of gladiatorial force,
For direst slaughter, dealt without remorse,
For that best blow which gives the deepest pain,
For these the Commons look-and look in vain.
Non qualis erat. Calmly he declares
The Bill a mockery of his clients' prayers,
Derides the fears of those who fear the Crowd,
Asserts its rights, in language bold and proud,
Foretells its certain victory o'er the few,
Demands Reform that shall be large and true,
And promises our guerdon shall be seen-
In what? Mob rule ? No. Strength to State and QUEEN.
Nor taunt nor threat escaped him while he spoke,
Nor from his eye the gladiator broke.
The long debate's adjourned, the Senate drives
Off to its toddies, clubs, weeds, whist, or wives.
Thrice hath the sun upon their conflict set,
And the fourth day beholds them grappling yet.
NORTHCOTE, for Government, in piteous strains,
Of cruel treatment by its foes complains,
And pleads its willingness to alter much
That's inexpedient, or is fancied such.
At this sneers CARDWELL: Angel DRUMMOND states
The Bill contains what he intensely hates,
But votes a second reading. MR. DENT
To such a course refuses his assent.
Semi-defends the measure MR. PACKE;
LORD HARRY VANE comes down upon it, whack;
While STUART WORTLEY, like a lawyer, tries
To lead opinion to a compromise, -
Suggests the House agree to keep the measure,
Reserving right to botch it at their pleasure.
Then, deeming that 'tis time the train to shunt,
Stands the tall VISCOUNT in the battle's front.
The House is hushed to calm,
and crushed to jam,
As fixed it listens to the wily PAM.
Good-natured insolence, but lightly veiled,
Marks each gay period with “sensation” hailed.
He votes with RUSSELL, nay, his Noble Friend
Had shown him his Amendment, freshly penned,
And he had told his Noble Friend the same
Was the most perfect thing that he could frame.
The Bill was very bad, without a doubt,
But that's no reason DERBY should go out:
He must not tear his Bill, nor yet resign,
Nor must a Dissolution be his line.
(In fact, he can't dissolve--the House must choose
On that: he'll want Supplies, which they'll refuse.)
LORD DERBY to the Commons must submit,
And pass the measure they may vote is fit;
And, for the aid he has been pleased to lend,
LORD DERBY ought to thank his Noble Friend.
Pleased that his speech had every Party riled,
The virtuous PALMERSTON sat down and smiled.
Then fiery WHITESIDE to the battle rushed,
And red-hot eloquence like lava gushed.
Who was LORD PALMERSTON, to give advice ?
A blundering player, though
he loads his dice.
And who were LORD John RUSSELL and his tools ?
The Bill was splendid, and they all were fools!
He scorn’d the counsel meant the scheme to kill:
The Queer's Advisers would uphold their Bill.
The strange debate's adjourned, the Senate drives
Home to its toddies, clubs, weeds, whist, or wives.
Nought else of Parliamentary marks the week,
Nought else of which the poet Punch will speak:
Save that the Lords, who say they ’re Ladies' Men,
Smashed the Wife's Sister Bill; by (only) 10.

THERE can be no doubt that JENKINS still occasionally looks in at
the office of the Morning Post, and polishes a pair of boots or does a
paragraph. His hand is evident in the subjoined extract from a critical
notice, in that journal, of a print representing some ladies, and named
The Bouquet of Beauty :--
“Few modern artists know better than MR. CHARLES BAXTER how to paint 'the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Given the necessity, you want a Bill
Of far more boldness, and of greater skill.
So spoke the tall and venerable vir,
With tardy diction and Northumbrian burr.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
THE ARGUMENT.
THE POET PUNCH, albeit extremely disgusted at the duration of the
conflict, continueth to record the events of the Reform Battle Days,
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art. He beginneth with Mon-
day, March the 28th, and endeth with Friday, being All Fools' Day.
Last, on his feet brave PAKINGTON upsprang,
And dashed at all antagonists slap-bang :
Fought for the Bill, and hurled no measured strokes
On PALMERSTON for all his jeers and jokes,
His counsel scouted, and his wrath defied,
And bade the House the measure's fate decide;
Let RUSSELL win-he gave them warning fair-
The Bill should be among the things that were.

Poluphlos-
Boiotha –
Slasses.'
The fifth debate's adjourned, the Senate drives
Off to its toddies, clubs, weeds, whist, or wives.
STIRRED to a blaze once more the battle flames,
And forward stands the stalwart EDWIN JAMES;
Foregone conclusion doth his speech denote,
Namely, that Derby falls before the vote.
Next, a new Premier EDWIN darts upon,
And hands the country to the good Lord John.
Right earnest pains doth gallant Edwin take
To show what ministers LORD John should make;
Not dim old Whigs, or boys of lordly breed,
But real men, the people's friends indeed.
BEAUMONT, a Liberal, which his name is BLACKETT,
Votes for the Bill-expected to attack it.
LORD Elcho, loyal to his friend LORD GREY,
A Liberal also, votes the Tory way,
And, in a smartish speech, gives little quarter
To BRIGHT, whose speech he christens milk-and-water.
Bad is the measure, growls E. Ellice, sage.
Smyth would amend it on another stage.
The fated Bill receives an extra knock
From grimy Southwark's delegate, John LOCKE.
The LORD ADOLPHUS TEMPEST plainly tells
His creed—the workman's real friends are Swells;
Whereat the ready MONCKTON Milnes invites
The swells to yield the workman's claim of rights.
Then oily GRAHAM rears his length in air,
And gazes round him with a wild despair :
Laudator temporis acti, when Reform
Rode on the whirlwind, and he hurled the storm.
That was a triumph. He had fondly deemed
That settlement was final. He had dreamed.
The time had come, he urged, with accents sad,
To lower your franchise, and 'new Members add ;
Nay, though he hates the sneaking secret ball,
He hears it asked for with increasing call.
No vulgar champion now bestrides the field,
But one beneath whose blow the best have reeled.
The classic GLADSTONE earliest takes the floor,
Armed, doubly armed, with eloquence and lore.
Pleased on his lips the listening Commons hung,
And truths divine came mended from his tongue.
His polished blade like glancing lightning flies,
Stabbed at his feet the Resolution lies :
But ere hath ceased that Ministerial shout,
The Bill itself he hacks and hews about,
Lops off its clauses, as, in ancient day,
ULYSSES lopped MELANTHIUS' limbs away;
But spares its life, and loftily requires
The House to make it what the House desires. :
Small boroughs hold high place in his esteem;
He'd have the Senate half an Academe,
Where boys, returned for tiny burghs, should learn
A statesman's business, and its duties stern.
Give votes to friends of WILLIAMS, HADFIELD, Cox,
But keep a door for Pelham, CANNING, Fox.
The great Debater spoke: and sat, while cheers
Of the pleased Commons vibrate on his ears.
“The Bill is framed, at least in my belief,
With crafty Tory purpose," quoth MONCRIEFF.
“On purpose to defeat yon artful dodger,
(John RUSSELL) I support,” said PALMER (ROGER).
WESTHEAD, who's not the best head, will oppose.
To t'other lobby MAJOR EDWARDS goes.
COLLIER on Ben looks black as any coal.
Walsh thinks the measure good, upon the whole.
0. STANLEY seeks its death on every ground.
MACAULAY deems its principles are sound.
From Yarmouth's Member, learned Q. C. MELLOR,
Ben gets the thing Ben Caunt would call a smeller.
HARDY, the Under-Secretary, hits
Both hard and fair, and vindicates his wits.
And JOHN FITZGERALD, Irish ex-A. G.,
Propels his brogue against DISRAELI,
Assails the Bill, and fervidly affirrums
The Resolution clear in all its terrums.
The sixth debate's adjourned, the Senate drives
Off to its toddies, clubs, weeds, whist, or wives.
Wet are the streets with Wednesday's filthy snow,
When to the House the eager Commons go.
The Thursday night has come, and word is passed.
That leaders mean this night shall be the last.
The foremost blow is struck by young Du CANE,
Who votes with Ministers. In fiercer strain,
Rails at the Bill the elder son of PEEL,
ROBERT, whose mouth is seldom stopped by meal ;
His taunts, though not refined, the House amuse,
If slight the value of his statesman-views.
GASKELL regrets the Bill was ever framed,
But of the RUSSELL motion is ashamed ;
And kindly Slaney, with reverse of joy,
Resists a Bill which he would not destroy.
E. EGERTON (what's that about a Peer)
Supports the measure, though some points are queer.
COBBert and Collins think it good enough,
While WESTERN censures it in language rough.
HUDSON and Hodgson, RUSSELL's dodge rebuke,
And so does WYVILL, christened MARMADUKE.
To rhyme a roll of names is rather hard,
Be ample beer permitted to the bard.

[APRIL 9, 1859.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The night grows deep, --each moment nearer brings
The Fate that comes with victory on her wings.
'Tis said !-believe or not the awful tale,
Told by Policeman X, with terror pale,
That, on this night, the DUKE in Bedford Square
Sent from bronze lips a shout upon the air,
And that CHARLES Fox, who fronts him, slowly rose,
Cheered thrice, and straight resumed his seat and doze.
Strange things take place, which mortal wits surpass, –
Hath bronze
some secret sympathy with brass ?
WALTER opposed the Bill, but likewise said
He could not lend the Resolution aid.
Again let Ministers exert their tact,
And frame a Bill that might become an Act.
'Twas theirs the legislative path to show,
Nor such a duty on the House to throw.
GREENALL and GILPIN spoke on different sides ;
The first with Ben, the next with John divides :
And HENLEY, though dissentient, thought it fair
In the Committee to make matters square.
Then ROEBUCK rose, the world at large to teach,
Condemned professed Reformers, all and each :
Had not the slightest confidence in Pam,
Considered LORD JOHN RUSSELL as a sham.
Bright was an orator, no doubt; but, pshaw!
His sense and judgment were not worth a straw.
If at his (ROEBUCK's) dictates they'd correct
The Bill, supplying what he deemed defect,
He would sustain the Ministry; if not,
He didn't care how soon they went to pot.
The Chariot of the Fatal Hour hath come,
Nor longer may DISRAELI be dumb.
All eyes are on him, and his rising claim,
All tongues in chorus call upon his name.
With cheek unchanging from its sallow gloom,
However near his ministerial tomb,
With hand whose almost careless coolness spoke,
Its grasp well used to deal the sabre-stroke,
With eye, though calm, determined not to spare,
Did BENJAMIN his willing weapon bare;
Sweeps his long arın, that sabre's whirling sway
Sheds fast atonement for six nights' delay.
Some pains he deigned his chieftain's head to guard,
Some pains to prove his measure's treatment hard,
And boldly he affirmed its right to live,
As giving all a statesman dared to give.
Then sudden turning on his focman's flanks,
His showering sarcasm volleyed through their ranks :
Chief marks their leaders for his biting hail,
Stout PALMERSTON, the man without a tail,
Bright, ribald scoffer at the peers and throne,
Doubtless with some ambition of his own,
And plotting RUSSELL, with his subtle ends,
For ever scheming to upset his friends.
Those the conspirators whose wicked will
Sought to destroy a well-considered Bill,
And check a Government that watchful stands,
The peace of Europe trembling in its hands.
So Dizzy struck through brass and triple steel,
Inspiring hope himself had ceased to feel,
Still to the last his battle-word he cried
Then came the sound of doom-“DIVIDE! DIVIDE!”
TAYLOR and JOLIFFE at the table stand,
Tellers, with KNATCHBULL HUGESSEN, and BRAND.
One glance reveals the fortune of the fight,-
Stand the twin Whigs-or Tories--to the right?
Ha! all is o'er,—the battle's lost and won :
The Noes, Three Thirty, -Ayes, Two Ninety-one.
As many Articles as Churchmen sign,
So many Noes outnumber,—THIRTY-NINE!
That Friday good LORD DERBY seeks his QUEEN,
With what result, on Monday shall be seen:
Honours and office at her feet he lays.
So Punch concludes the Battle of the Days.

Our gallants all beside us : our grooms at our back.

And la, such a clearance we make of our plates !

Can this be our excellent friend, the Chairman of the

THWAITES be doing, as bear-leader to the sable Sovereign

To breakfast he had scarce sat down,

BIGOTRY, OR SOME BLUNDER, AT
BOSTON. (U.S.)
The following statement in a newspaper correspondent's
letter from Boston, U.S., seems to confirm the prevalent
belief that our American cousins entertain peculiar ideas on
the subject of morals :-
“There has been some excitement in Boston for nearly a week, in
consequence of some of the Catholic scholars in one of the public
schools refusing to use the Protestant version of the Commandments
and the Lord's Prayer. Three of the boys who left on account of their
conscientious scruples have been arrested for larceny, one of them
being a Protestant.
The meaning of the latter of the above sentences in con-
nection with the former is open to some question. It may
simply be, that the boys who left the school on account
of their conscientious scruples were subsequently arrested
for picking pockets, from which those scruples did not
restrain them; and that, one of them being a Protestant,
the inference which ought to be drawn is, that a Protestant
as well as a Catholic boy may possibly be a young rogue.
Or the sentence may have been intended to signify that
the boys were arrested on a fictitious charge of larceny,
brought against them from motives of bigotry or intole-
rance, and including the Protestant boy as an incipient
pervert. Or it may imply the fact that they were arrested
on a true charge of larceny; refusal to use the Protestant
versions in question amounting to that offence by the laws
of New England; and one of the juvenile recusants being
actually a Protestant. Or, lastly, perhaps, we are to under-
stand its import to be, th it is larceny in Boston to play
truant, and that the two ordinarily conscientious young
Papists, and the extraordinarily conscientious young
Heretic, were apprehended for stealing away from school.
On the third and fourth of these suppositions, the insti-
tutions of the United States, or at least those of New
England, are insane. On the second, bigotry in Boston
must be frantic. On the first, the sentence in question
conveys little news, and bears to the preceding one that
simply negative relation which only indicates that its
author was probably an Irish gentleman.

man savant has taken the trouble to count the number of hairs exist-
A DISINTERESTED INQUIRER.
INDUSTRY, such as that chronicled in the subjoined
paragraph from a contemporary, ought to be rewarded :-
“ HAIRS OF THE HEAD NUMBERED.—The Medical Times says, a Ger-
ing in four heads of hair, of different colours. He found in a blond,
140,409 distinct hairs; in a brown, 109,440, in a black, 102,960, and in
a red, 88,740."
Such trouble is the more deserving of some material
recompense, inasmuch as it is not likely to have been
remunerated by the moral and intellectual gratification
which attends a scientific discovery, particularly one that
is of any use. Unless all the four heads were of the same
size, it would be impossible to draw any conclusion, from
the relative numbers of the hairs of each, as to the average
of such heads of bair, except, indeed, the biggest heads
had the fewest hairs, and even that would not prove much.
It would be necessary to lay a great many heads together
in order to generalise safely concerning their propor-
tionate hairiness; and then, though the utility of the
generalisation might be vast, it would not be obvious.
Continental philosophers are fond of honours; and
perhaps a title would be, if not the most acceptable
present that this one could be offered, at least the most
valuable that his country could very well afford. His
field of research may have been a barren domain; but it
would be graceful to create so diligent a numberer a

The Money Market.
THE Indian Correspondent of the Times says, “Opium
is to the Malwa banker what bullion is to the Bank of
England.” We have heard of money being a drug, but
here a drug is literally money. However, we think we
should prefer the “rest” of the Bank of England to
a rest that was the feverish result of opium. No wonder
that the money market of Bombay is in such a collapsed
state. It must experience the greatest difficulty in rising
with so much opium in its system.

THE COMMUNITY OF CRINOLINE.
The great diurnal oracle of fashion published,
the other day, the following remarkable state-
ment, furnished by its own correspondent at
Fashion's head-quarters, Paris :-
La Marche opened the ball this season with three
races or rather steeple-chaces, which, however, did not
call for comment, the added money being small, and the
fame of the competitors second class ; nevertheless
beauty, rank, fashion, and crinolines, all more or less
lovely, attracted by a bright sun and genial atmosphere,
flocked in thousands to the scene of action."
Beauty, of course, is feminine ; rank and
fashion, placed in apposition with beauty, are
feminine also; crinolines are feminine, of neces-
sity. Besides, they are all above described as
more or less lovely, therefore must needs be
feminine. Beauty means ladies distinguished
by their personal charms; rank, the female aris-
tocracy; and fashion, ladies who occupy a bril-
liant social position. What sort of ladies are
crinolines, then? Crinolines, in the foregoing
passage, are distinguished from fashion: it there-

genial and fresh interpretation of high-class comedy has
rendered him a universal favourite with the frequenters
of the Dunlop Street Theatre. — Glasgow Bulletin."
We have taken a slight liberty with this
"accomplished” gentleman, in altering the
name wherewith he has been gifted, to one
which we conceive is more expressive of his
talents; but on this we trust to him to put
genial interpretation,” for which, we
are informed, he is so eminently famous. MR.
STIGGINS must believe in our sincerity when we
say we use the pseudonym without meaning any
sneer in it. We have no wish to cast ridicule
upon an actor who, we hear, is so respected"
in his art, because he happens to be “admired
for his scholarly attainments.". The actor to
whose buskins MR. STIGGINS is appointed to
succeed has also his admirers for his scholarly
attainments and for the advantage of the
playbill-studying public, we rejoice that a fit
person has been found to fill his place. The
Iore which has been lavished on the fly-leaves
of the playbills, which have lately been produced
at the Princess's Theatre, must have taxed the
highest powers of the deepest-read of scholars.
On a literary account, then, as well as a dra-
matic one, it relieves our mind to hear of MR.
STIGGINS's engagement, which we trust will be
of profit to the public and himself. Bilious
critics, it is true, may sneer at the preliminary
announcement of his merits, and may ask in
what the drama is connected with divinity, and
whether studying the Apocalyse at all prepares
an actor for studying a part.
“Not to speak
profanely,” were the Divina Commedia to be pro-
duced at the Princess's, MR. STIGGINS might
perhaps find his divinity of service; but it could
not much advantage him in comedies in general,
excepting peradventure in those of the divine
WILLIAMS. Nor, as bilious critics further
might remark, is it quite clear why such learning
is paraded in his puff. Among the “unco guid
of Glasgow it may perhaps advance an actor
to give out in the papers that he is well up in
divinity; just as cooks will sometimes advertise
their church-going and their piety, in addition to
the virtues of their made-dishes and pastry. But
playgoers in general do not as the unco guid
do." In London, for the most part, we like to
see things in their place, and do not want
divinity lugged into a play-puff. It being as
an actor that MR. STIGGINS comes before them,
it concerns the London public much more to
be told of his theatrical abilities, than of his
Apocalyptical research; and until they have had
the privilege of reading what he has written and
of seeing how he acts, it must, we fear, remain a
doubt with all unbiassed critics whether his light
comedy be as heavy as his books would seem
to be.

PARISIAN GOSSIP.
“ THERE was immense trouble with MEYERBEER's new opera. To
the title, Le Pardon de Ploërmel, there was the grand objection that it
might remind people of the late terrible fiasco known as Le Pardon de
Montalembert. This was the composer's difficulty. Then, when it
came to be known that Pardon did not mean a pardon, but a sort of
Congress, the Tuileries took fright, and visions of a frantic mob
clamouring for a Parliament came upon M. Duplicité." Next, it
became known that the interest of the plot turned upon the resolution
of somebody to clutch at gold by the most unhallowed means, and at
the price of destruction to the innocent; and then the Ante-chamber
got into a state of mind, and certain of the billiard-marking nobility
protested against scandals. Then the fact came out that a goat was an
important performer, and a certain Minister was despatched to super-
intend rehearsals, and watch lest the wicked wit of the manager might
trim the animal's beard, so as to bring the face into any resemblance to
that of an excessively exalted personage. Then, some of the priests
about the Court raised an objection to the profanity of thunder and
lightning, especially when brought into play by a Jew, and it was only
by a promise of a private
box for the season to a certain Archbishop
that this was got over. Then, one of the dames d'honneur

A BLOW FOR THE BALLOT.
(See Speech of LORD JOHN RUSSELL, Times, April 13.)
SIR, as touching the Ballot, I briefly would state
(For I've no wish to lengthen this tedious debate),
That with SIR R. BETHELL I cannot agree,
Wben he says that the law says all votes should be free.
Ancient statutes he quotes for his proofs, but, Sir, I
Him to find the word Ballot' in old laws defy.
I've read all Pitt's speeches, and those too of Fox,
And in neither is any demand for the Box:
So I say, and I'll stick to 't with due resolution,
Secret voting's no part of the Br’ish Constitution:
As a Briton I therefore detest it, and go
With friend Pam when he calls it mean, sneaking, and low.
Still I can't say I think, as I once did, I own,
That the Ballot-box now would endanger the throne;
My predictions on this point I therefore retract,
For I think no great damage would come from the act.
I've such faith in true Britons, be they small men or great,
That I think none desire to imperil the State:
And though granting the Box might not make the Funds go up,
Still I don't think 'twould end in a general blow up.
“At the same time, albeit I've so altered my views,
As to own in the Ballot there may be some use,
And to think that some good to effect it might chance
(Though I see but small benefit from it in France),
While I've shown 'twould result, Sir, in nothing unpleasant :
Still I cannot support it—at least, not at present !”
!
More Flunkeydom.
"It is proposed,” says an Irish paper, “to erect a bronze statue to
the MARQUIS OF WATERFORD, to be erected in the People's Park in
the town whence he took title.” This is simple slavering adulation.
That of late years the Marquis was a kind neighbour and a good
landlord, is a fact on which his neighbours and tenants are to be
congratulated, but not a reason for erecting a statue to him. The
flunkeyish proposal compels Mr. Punch to remark, that if bronze be
wanted, it might probably be found in the stock of knockers wrenched
off by his Lordship in his “eccentric" days. Save even a deceased
Marquis from his friends!

SHAKSPEARE AND LORD CAMPBELL,
ROBIN HOOD might have envied the gentleman mentioned in the
following brief Police report:-
“WESTMINSTER.-JOSEPH MORRIS was finally examined, charged with stealing a
great quantity of property from the stables of LORD CAMPBELL, Stratheden House,
Knightsbridge.
"The prisoner, who made no defence, was committed for trial.”
The act of breaking into the stables of LORD CAMPBELL was one of
similar daring to that of walking into the lion's den. There cannot
but be something awful to a thief in the character of a Judge, of which
the influence must extend even to the Judge's premises; though of
course there are none which the depredator, if he could be sure of not
being detected, would feel greater pleasure in plundering:
We may imagine what a high joke Sir John Falstaff would have
thought it, under assurance against a contingency which would have
turned the jest against himself, to perform the exploit for which MR.
MORRIS was sent to gaol. It will be remembered that Falstaff's
outbreak of exultation on hearing from Pistol of the death of Henry IV.,
concludes with the following remarkable words :-
“Let us take any man's horses ; the laws of England are at my commandment.
Happy are they which have been my friends; and woe unto my Lord Chief
Justice !"
The exhortation to steal horses, in close connection with the
denouncement of woe against the Lord Chief Justice, may, by the least
conjectural Shakspearian commentator, be supposed to bear additional
testimony to the prophetic soul of SHAKSPEARE, particularly as the
great dramatist doubtless foresaw that he would be under some obli-
gation to the present successor of ŞIR WILLIAM GASCOIGNE. Hence,
there can be little difficulty in concluding that, when he put the horse-
stealing proposal together with the malediction upon the Lord Chief
Justice, into Falstaff's mouth, he had an eye with a forewarning
purpose to the future robbery of LORD CAMPBELL's stables.
THE RETIREMENT OF THE WISCOUNT.
How gallantly, how merrily, to the Country down go we,
The addresses are all printed, the beer is flowing free;
The agents and the canvassers are bustling, blithe and bright,
Like creatures who have all to gain, and nought to lose by fight.
The voters share their triumph; out mouldy freemen creep;
And seedy householders emerge from under clouds so deep,
In their wake like any ale-butt the licensed wittler mark,
Oh, proud must be Britannia of such a wholesome lark !
Yes, proud must be Britannia: despite what croakers say,
That constitutions aren't improved by moist’ning of the clay;
That who conquers of such combatants to her don't matter more,
Than which of two Kilkenny cats is left upon the floor.
I would I were Britannia with Commoner and Lord,
Competing for my service, with pen and tongue and sword;
I'd tell the House of Commons—that talks so fast and free,
"A few less words, and a deal more work, or you won't do for me."
But Britannia grew paler, and paler still she grew-
In spite of all her eager slaves that to the hustings drew;
And something in her manner proclaimed some loss was nigh,
To which all coming gains would be, what cads call "all my eye.”
Then came a horrid whisper that turned Punch's hair to grey-
That the noble WISCOUNT WILLIAMS from Lambeth drops away:
Britannia may well turn pale, and ask of all her friends,
Who will henceforth save cheese-parings, and rescue candle-ends ?
Penny-wisdom o'er her champions in agony may weep;
Pound-foolishness may deck herself in sables dark and deep;
But no second WISCOUNT WILLIAMS the Commons House will sec,
Not e'en Lambeth has another retail-dealer dense as he.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SAGA OF THE SEA-LORDS AND THE DRAGON OF DEOFRE.-YE FIRSTE FYTTE.
(From the Norse.)
His person bespattered,
Besmirched his array;
All faint with the fire-flaughts
The weird worm had flung;
And red from the clutch, where
His sharp claws had clung.
Kick out false KEARN-EGGA,
Or help me do so.
Who not bites through this worni
With the steel of the sword,
In the hall of the Pakings
No longer is Lord.”
Then outspake that sea-king,
Of Pakings the chief.
“ What thegn of my meynie
Brings Deofre relief?
Who beardeth the dragon,
The fire-drake OSBETRN,
Despite his sharp tongue-tip,
His hide, or his horn?
Be thine the adventure-
KEÃRN-EGGA, the bold !
To drag forth the fire-drake
Os-BEÕRN from his hold.”
CROWNING its sea-walls
Wind-swept, and white :
Welcome to passengers
Pallid of plight,
Fair riseth Deofre-town,
Far over flood :
There dwells a Dragon,
Deadly of mood.
OSBEÕRN, that dragon hight:
Dark is his mane :
Scales as of brass
Buckler his brain :
Sharp is his tongue-tip,
Sudden to slay;
Pain on its point sits,
Prompt after prey.
Fierce from his fiery throat
Flashes are flung;
Tails hath he many,
Tipped like his tongue.
So won the weird worm,
Wild by his wave-home;
Grim in his grinning,
Gay in his grave home:
What jarl will beard him,
Bold against brass,
Reckless of tongue's point,
Pierce the worm's pass ?
Who OSBEÕRN, the dragon,
Will drag from his den,
Till his teeth and his talons
Are mocked among men ?
There sat in the White Hall
Of sea-kings the flower :
From the town of the Pakings,-
A Viking of power :
As they told of the dragon,
The fire-drake OSBEÕRN,
How his tongue-point and tail-sting,
Worked woe, night and morn.
How in Deofre his wonning
That worm held at will,
None so bold as to brave him,
With blade or with bill.
How who so essayed it,
Emerged in dismay,
9
But KEÃRN-EGGA the crafty,
Sat still in his place:
Though the Lord of the Pakings
Grew red in the face.
Now, hie thee, KERN-EGGA.
KERN-EGGA said, “Nay:
'Tis no work for a sea-king,
Foul fire-drakes to slay.
Such deeds bring not glory,
Nor profit of pelf:
If worm OSBEÕRN need killing,
Go kill him yourself ?”
The chief of the Pakings
Grew red, and waxed pale:
And the Vikings around him,
Made snug for a gale.
He turned to Jarl RICHARD,
The Viking DUNDAS :
“Go thou, my Jarl RICHARD,
KEĀRN-EGGA 's an ass.
For my thegn when I chose him,
He swore to be true,
And wherever I bid him
To seek derring-do.
Go thou, fight this dragon:
Yet, ere that thou go,
Then answered Jarl RICHARD,
That sea-king so stout,
“Be it ne'er said, one Víking
Another kicked out.
As KEARN-EGGA answered,
E'en so answer I:
As a sea.king, of dragons
I'd rather fight shy.”
Then the chief of the Pakings
Turned angry away,
And from each of his chieftains
Th’emprize did essay:
But each, when applied to,
Said “No” to his face,
Though threatened with loss
Of his sea-king's high place-
Till KEARN-EGGA, the stubborn,
Cried : "Stay here, who will;
Be it might to steer galleys,
Not dragons to kill."
And he rose from his seat,
And strode out of the door,
And Jarl RICHARD had followed,
And two Vikings more;
But the chief of the Pakings, !
He clutched at their skirts,
And he lauded their prowess,
And praised their deserts;
“In the White Hall I pray you
Your seats still to hold,
Nor follow in dudgeon
KE`RN-EGGA the bold.
And for fighting this dragon,
As fought he must be,
I will find me some Berserk
Our champion to be.”

THE REWARD OF JUVENILE MERIT.
THREE little boys, says the Post, found, while picking
up loose stones on a part of the PRINCE CONSORT's Farm,
abutting on the Long Walk at Windsor, which had been
turned up by drainage operations, a lead case containing 501
silver coins, chiefly half-crowns, of ELIZABETH, CHARLES-
THE FIRST, and JAMES the FIRST ; and-
“The boys divided the coins among themselves, but on the discovery
becoming known to MR. Tart, the steward of his Royal Highness,
the coins were collected and forwarded to HER MAJESTY, and the
boys suitably rewarded."
How? We should like to know in what manner these
boys were suitably rewarded for being found out with the
coins. The reward may have been considered suitable by
the giver, but the receivers may have found it unpleasant.

LAMENT BY A TRUE BLUE M.P.
(Touching the state of the Clock and the state of Parties.)
WHEN the Clock's hands they won't work,
And the Clock's wheels they won't play,
How are poor old boys in Westminster
To be up to the time o' day?
“Look at your private tickers,"
That's all very well to say;
What we want is something to set 'em by,
And tell us the time o' day.
Oh, our father's times were the good old times !
When, according as your lay
Was Tory or Whig, you'd a leader so big,
To show you the time o'day.
You'd no reasons to find, nor to make up your mind,
But by what PITT or Fox might say
You set your ticker-be it slower or quicker-
And that was the time o' day.
Like a tall clock-tower that tells the hour,
To the town miles and miles away,
Those leaders so great, in matters of state,
Gave small folks the time o' day.
But in these wild times men scorn tower-chimes,
For what their own fobs may say;
Big leaders are dumb, and the big Clock 's mum,
And none gives us the time o' day.
Well—a watch of your own, and a mind of your own,
Are very good things in their way,
But I've no watch to wind up, and I can't make my mind up-
And I don't know the time o' day.
A LITERARY WAIF.
HE day after the Finsbury
Election a letter was put
into our box containing two
or three proof sheets of what
seems to have been the
commencement of an Uni-
versal History. As the word
“ Cancelled " appears upon
them, we conclude the in-
tention of completing the
work is abandoned for the
present. That the world
may know what they have
lost, we venture to reprint
the portion which has
reached us.
“It was at the battle of
Pharsalia, which was fought
during the Wars of the
Roses, in the spring-time
of the year B.c. 1672, that
EDWARD the Blue Prince,
the eldest son of Old KING
COLE, after slaying fifteen
Saracens with his Cour's
revolver, engaged in single
combat with his mortal foe,
PRINCE RUPERT, who was a
rival suitor for the hand and the affections of Fair ROSAMOND. After
they had fought for upwards of six hours by Canterbury clock, the
gauntlet was thrown up in favour of PRINCE RUPERT, who, in striet
conformity with the old law of duelling, mounted on the shoulders of his
defeated foe, and sounded his own trumpet in defiance of all-comers,
Being then carried pig-a-back to the Ladies Gallery, he was crowned
with cabbage-leaves by the Queen of Beauty, impersonated by the grand-
mother of the LADY JANE Godiva. A photograph of this extremely
interesting ceremony is still preserved in the Assyrian Room at the
British Museum. The motto which encircles it was composed for the
occasion by the MAN OF Ross, who, it is believed, was the poet-laureate
of the period. The honour of its composition has, however, since been
claimed by CHAUCER, BUNYAN, ROBINSON, and ALEXANDRINE SMITH.
In the spelling of the period, the scroll stands thus :-
Happie, happie, happie Payre!
Nun butte Braibe desserbe Fayre."
"ALEXANDER THE GREAT (who was complimentarily called so by
his courtiers, being, in reality, of a somewhat dwarfish stature) suc-
ceeded to the throne of Troy upon the death of CLEOPATRA, the mother
of his wife. His coronation was attended with more than usual pomp,
WIDDICOMB THE FIRST being master of the ceremonies. Under the
system of one RARI, a trainer of the period, the king was quite
successful in taming the White Horse, and drove him in his curricle
to the Augean stables, where he was put up. On the same day, the
king sat down to a lunch of lampreys, at which, to please QUEEN
HELEN, he dissolved his finest pearl in a butt of Malmsbury. It was
during his reign that the declaration of independence was signed by
the Athenians,
and the colony of Macedonia received
a constitution at
the hands of NERO, and was enrolled by WILLIAM PENN among the
Free Trade States.'
“The long-vexed question, which has so disturbed historians, from
HOMER and HERODOTUS up to JOSEPH HUME and FLETCHER, as to
who dragged whom round the walls of what, has been set at rest by
the researches of WILLIAMS, “the divine,' an antiquarian of Lambeth.
From a Chaldean MS. exhumed by this gentleman in his Nineveh
exploration, which was undertaken in the hope of finding out the
North-west Passage, and of discovering the Sauce of the Niger, the
true facts of the case have been clearly brought to light. The truth is
plainly patent to all who can decipher the Sanscrit hieroglyphics, that
the dragsman in question was CÆSAR HELIOGABALUS; who, after the
capture of Philippi from the Jews, harnessed to his drag the horses of
KING DIOMED, and so 'dragged'the conquered HECTOR home to dine
with CLYTEMNESTRA at her villa near Vesuvius.”
"The meeting at Philippi, to which CONGREVE was indebted for his
drama of The Rivals, was a duel that took place B.c. 1654, between
REGULUS THE NINETEENTH, champion of Christendom, and the
heathen crusader, Brutus AFRICANUS. The meeting, as originally
fixed, was arranged to have come off upon the plains of Pompeii; but
as the Amazon queen Dido had electrically telegraphed her strong
wish to be present, and as there was then no railway from her palace
to Pompeii, the valley of Philippi was appointed for the meet. It was
on this occasion, saith Asser the historian, that the expression ' Et ta

of remembering not only that they had heard its first sound, but that they had
some share in its erection.-Thos. M`NAMARA, Administrator.
“ 18th April, 1859.
“P.S. The offerings will be received within the railing, around the great Cross in
front of the Church, and the last Mass will be delayed till a quarter past twelve, to
allow the congregation time to enter the Church."
We wonder if the ceremony did take place on the first of May,
If so a Jack-in-the-Green would have added largely to the solemnity of
the proceedings.. As the Clock began to strike, the big drum and the
pandean pipes might have raised a loud shriek of deafening congratu-
fation, and my Lord Duke and my Lady would have joined doubt-
lessly in a riotous dance to express their unbounded joy. It must
have been such an exhilarating thing to hear a Church Clock strike.
We are curious to know whether the horological débutant was nervous,
or husky, and whether it gave out the twelve notes it had deliver
in a clear bold unfaltering tone ? The subscription might have been
affected by the way in which the Clock recited its first lesson in
public, and if it gave out only eleven strokes, or went so far as a
baker's dozen, or delivered them in a stupid stuttering manner, the
coppers might have melted away almost to nothing. We should like
to learn how many persons waited, after the wonderful performance
was over, for the hat to be carried round, and also whether any mad
wag cried out “Encore," as soon as the twelfth stroke had been con-
cluded. We trust that a report of this Phihsborough début will duly
appear, and that we may also be favoured with a portrait of the Clock.

THE ENFIELD RIFLE.
WHEN BONAPARTE THE FIRST prepared
For England's coast invasion,
Our fathers armed-by Mercy spared
For valour from occasion.
That swarm, about a foeman's ears,
Would then have proved no trifle,
Although those British volunteers
Had not the Enfield rifle.
Their arms they learned by dint of drill
Right cleverly to shoulder;
For native land to die, or kill,
No Spartans e'er were bolder-
But they to shoulder old Brown Bess
Had then to be contented.
The Rifle which we now possess
Not having been invented.
Now old Brown Bess was not a gun
For shooting to depend on.
Good work she did, but that was done
With bayonet fixed her end on.
And she'd have served the volunteer
Full well, it can't be doubted
To thrust invaders in the rear,
Their forces having routed.

With rare and little error,
Of old the cloth-yard arrow flew,
Its very name struck terror.

The following drama has been enclosed to Mr. Punch by a corres-

to it, or indeed to do more than to poke it into Mr. Punch's letter-box
in an envelope without direction. The brilliancy of the composition
however renders any formality superfluous, From the mingled sim-

the writer can hardly have had time to give many previous dramas to
the world, and the extraordinary size of the handwriting confirms
Mr. Punch in this idea. Of the merit of the play there cannot be two
opinions, and if MR. KEAN would bring it out at the Princess's, with
a magnificent suite of drawing-rooms with golden furniture, for the
first act, an allegorical history of Boulogne for an entr'acte, and a
view of that port, real water and ships, and a splendid féte for the

THE LAMENT OF ALNASCHAR-BEN-ISRAEL.
WHEN we went to the country, a victory clear
By the cash of the Carlton we hoped to have snatched,
But now the Elections are over, 'tis clear,
That We counted our chickens before they were hatched.”
We've bribed and we've bullied: we've put on the screw;
With all party colours our banner have patched;
But in vain; neither dross, dirt, nor dodging will do
To give us the chickens we ought to have hatched.
Had I known what I know,'gainst Pau, RUSSELL, and BRIGHT,
DISRAELI and DERBY had never been matched :
We'd have dropped to ’scape punishment-thrown up the fight,
But “We counted our chickens before they were hatched."
O’er the grave where we lie, by this act of our own,
Like Japanese Courtiers,"happy dispatched,"
Let this be the Epitaph carved on the stone,
They counted their chickens before they were hatched.”

THE BATTLE OF PAVIA.
This Battle is being fought every day in Regent Street, in conse-
quence of the disputes that are going on between the Vestry and the
inhabitants as to the proper paving of the thoroughfare. At the hour
of our going to press, the entire street was up, and a proper settlement
of the question, that has completely changed the surface of the neigh-
bourhood, is not expected for a long time. MR. DONALD NICOLL
repeats the words of FRANCIS THE FIRST, and goes about saying that
“ Tout est perdu fors l'honneur.” If Regent Street has not lost its
honour, there is a hope that it will learn in time how properly to mend
its ways. Now that the ex-member for Frome is no longer in Parlia-
ment, he intends trying whether he cannot make matters a little
smoother in his own parish, and is determined to leave no stone
unturned with the view of filling up the horrible chasms that discord
and litigation have left at the door of almost every peaceful parishioner.
We only hope that he may succeed in making the ground, that of late
has been so terribly torn by the pickaxe of dissension, somewhat firmer
than it was when last we had the jolting misfortune of rolling over it in
our carriage, the springs of whose body were nearly as much
dislocated
as the limbs of our own. For months and months, Regent Street has
been the terra-infirma of the metropolis.

PROMISE FEEDING.
MR. DISRAELI displays his usual ability in
feeding the hop-planters of Kent, and other
distressed districts, with a liberal prodigality
of promises. They always are to be blest, but
somehow never are. Next year the duty shall
be repealed, or at least some of it; but next
year,
like to-morrow, never comes. Their case
is always to be taken into consideration," and
we all know the meaning of such a Govern-
ment phrase. Things to be taken, in a public
office, into consideration, invariably remain
“under consideration.” That is the only con-
sideration ever paid to them. The poor hop-
planters believe in this flowery sustenance, and
come up to Downing Street regularly once a
year to be fed. The CHANCELLOR OF THE
EXCHEQUER feeds them with a tender and
bountiful hand, and knows exactly how to fill
their hearts, if not their stomachs, or their
pockets. It is a species of spoon-meat, for
which the hungry agriculturists evince a hearty
appetite; they relish the food,--thinner than
any workhouse gruel,-and, like young Oliver,
are always" asking for more.” MR. DISRAELI,
in his art, is a most cunning nurse,-a perfect
witch in his way; for he understands, in the
Macbeth sense, how to keep, with each depu-
tation, “the promise to the ear” of these
gaping gentlemen, and how, as unfailingly, to
break it to the hop."

indeed, be said of
BOMBA :-
“ Affliction
long time he bore,"
if BOMBA has really been suffering under that complication of disorders
which he is said to have been afflicted with. It appears, also, that his
state was at one time so desperate as to be considered beyond medical
aid; wherefore, in the belief that
" Physicians were in vain,"
the royal sufferer had the blood of St. JANUARIUS placed in his room,
that its liquefaction might perhaps effectually supersede the doctors.
Already, Punch has expressed the suspicion that Bomba has been
shamming. If he has, mark what will follow. BOMBA will come out
some fine morning as well as ever, and as fresh as a daisy, declaring
that, after having been given over, he had been restored to health by
means of the blood of St. JANUARIUS. Then there will be a festival
to commemorate his marvellous recovery: BOMBA will go in procession
through the streets of Naples, and the priests will institute a flare-up.
Now then, stupid ; if these things should come to pass, please to
remember how many contradictory statements--therefore, how many
falsehoods—have been circulated as to Bomba's ailments; and con-
sider whether the story of his supernatural cure ought not to be
concluded to be only one lie more.

My name it is Jumping JEMMY-

Famed for leaping and turning about,
And for going right round—just so! (Pirouettes.)
But don't call me fickle, good people,

You don't call your weathercock fickle
For telling each change of the wind-
Then why try get me in a pickle,
'Cause I'm given to changing my mind ?

Of a pilot who'd e'er be abuseful,

Andihow's man alone to stand steady,
When all around man's on the change!
In Life's whirl, all to whirl must be ready;
Mine's only a very long range,
And I've still been consistent all through,
To make inconsistency pay
Just as nimble my acts to undo,
As I'm nimble my words to unsay.
Chorus,
With my wheel-about, turn-about, right-about-face;
I may change my line, but I'll stick to my place!
'Tis but to save strain in my motions,
For an easier leap to prepare,
That I'm always extreme in my notions,
Since extremes often meet, you're aware.
'Twist two stools some men boggle and bother,
And between them come, bang, to the ground,

And safe in my seat still am found !

laws may be adapted to the contrast of colours in a purely party sense.
To begin at the beginning, Mr. Punch must quote the statement
“ GOING IT LIKE VINCKE-ING.”
“M. CHEVREUL's attention was first directed to this subject in consequence of
some complaints made as to the quality of certain colours prepared in the dyeing MONSIEUR DE VINCKE tells us that he "places great reliance on the

as to the want of vigour of the greys employed in the shadow of blue and violet Mr. Punch has not the ghost of an idea. The general impression is,

coalition. Not to make the matter too abstruse," says M.
CHEVREUL-
"Let us remind the reader that there are but three primaries, viz., red, blue, and
yellow, out of which, in various combinations, all other imaginable colours are
composed. The secondary colours (not to go further) are three, severally composed
of two of the three primaries, iz., green, composed of blue and yellow, orange,
composed of red and yellow; and violet, composed of red and blue. Taking the
whole three primary colours to complete the cycle of colour, the doctrine of comple-
mentary colours commences : which may be briefly explained by stating that every
primary colour has for its complementary colour the secondary colour, which is
composed of the other two primaries, and, vice vered, that every secondary colour
has for its complementary the primary colour, which does not enter into its own
composition. Thus red is complementary to green, blue to orange, and yellow to
violet; and vice vered."
Adapting this politically, Tory, Whig, and Radical correspond to
the "three primaries;” and out of these the various shades of party
colours are composed. For instance, Liberal-Conservative is that
which corresponds to violet, being made of Tory (red) in combination
with Whig (blue): a union which, in such a case as MR. GLADSTONE's,
makes a not unpleasing sort of Oxford mixture. The Derbyite, again,
is that which answers to the orange, blending the Tory (red) with the
Radical, or Chartist, yellow; a combination which produces the
strangest of effects, and in most eyes is regarded with a colourable
suspicion. The doctrine of complementaries accords in politics pre-
cisely with that which has been stated. The primaries-or premiers
need assistance from the secondaries, and it is by being compli-
mentary to them that they get it. For instance, red, or Tory, premiers
are complimentary to green, that is,
to the united Radicals and Whigs :
and the compliment is returned by green becoming complementary, i. e.
filling up the ranks, on a division, of the red.
Coming now to the pith of M. CHEVREUL's observations, Mr. Punch
learns that his “principle” consists in “simply this :”—
“That the eye after looking for any period, more or less in duration, upon any one
colour, immediately acquires an aptitude to see the complementary of that colour,
which will influence its appreciation of all objects upon which it may simultaneously
or immediately rest. For instance, during or immediately after looking at red, white
will present a greenish hue, and objects of all other colours will be more or less
qualified by the latter hue. Thus-red, the complementary of green, placed by the
side of green, increases its intensity; and
so of blue
in juxtaposition with orange,
and greenish-yellow with violet. And when the complementary colour to any
colour acting upon another colour in juxtaposition is partly composed of the last
named colour, or when the colour in juxtaposition is partly composed of the said

complementary, the colour common to both becomes intensified in the colour in
juxtaposition. For instance, orange being placed beside red, the orange will acquire

THE DERBY RACE.
MR. Punch has no wish
to debar his readers from

the subject of the Derby
Race. On the contrary, in-

out quackery, he will assist
them to obtain the best and

Without in any way pre-
tending that he has the gift
of prophecy, Mr. Punch con-
ceives himself at liberty to
mention that any persons
wishing to be "put up to a

become “knowing ones” in
the matter of the Derby
Race, will find all the latest
information in Burke's Peer-

particular is there given of
the Derby house and family.
They will learn there to a
certainty whom the present
Earl succeeded in the family,
though his succeeding in
the House remains at pre-

One would think there could
be only one opinion on the

coincides with it; but we par-
ticularly agree with the follow-
ing portion of that delivered by
the learned Doctor :-
“In the unhappy event of such an
attempt to procure justice proving in-
effectual, it will remain for the Govern-
ment of the injured subjects to take
such measures in their behalf as it
may deem expedient."
Certainly; and as any wise
Government will deem no mea-
sures that it could possibly take
on behalf of those aggrieved par.
ties expedient, no wise Govern.
ment will take any. It is hard
for the dupes of Spanish rascality
to lose their money, but they
had no business to lend it to
foreigners. Let their example
be a warning to all other un-
patriotic fools who supply the
sinews of war to brutes who are,
or may be, the enemies of Eng.
land. We hope that all those
who shall henceforth be guilty
of such base stupidity will be
ruined, and go to the workhouse.
To encourage them to commit a
blunder so gross and a crime so
atrocious, by extorting redress
for the Spanish bondholders
from the debtors by, whom they
have been deservedly swindled,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(JUNE 4, 1859.
for there is a forest in Richmond Park; it was formerly the site of the
palace of one of our kings; and many of the pleasing verses which
have from time to time been written for this Journal were composed
CORDIAL
in some of the excellent hostelries at Richmond-but this is a digres-
GIN
sion, which may be pardoned). To invite LORD PALMERSTON to come
to LORD John's house, which is called Pembroke Lodge, on account
of the number of Pembroke tables in it, would have been impossible.
But, as we have said, a lady's wit made all serene, to adopt the popular
phrase. We believe that to LADY JOHN RUSSELL may be attributed
the merit of the suggestion,
made on coming out of the Opera, that the
scenery from the balcony of the Star and Garter (a happy name for the
hotel - Hail, Star of Brunswick! and so on) was now very charming in
the viridity of spring.; and that the pleasant thing was to order dinner,
stroll in the park while it was preparing, and then return to the repast
and the view. With the exquisite finesse of highly-cultivated woman-
hood, the LADY PALMERSTON apprehended the meaning of the hint, and
asked which day was the best, when there were fewest of the London
club men and the rest of the lower orders hanging about and staring.
LADY John thought Wednesday a good day, being one of the London
dining-out days; and the distinguished ladies entered their respective
carriages.
By à curious coincidence, about ten minutes past six on Wednesday
evening last, LORD and LADY PALMERSTON were seen traversing the
green sod of Richmond Park, when they suddenly came upon LORD and
LADY John RUSSELL, and mutual well-bred surprise was manifested,
which we may inform our readers is called embonpong, or good taste.
The distinguished party strolled along, and fortunately came towards
the spot where our reporter, to whom a hint had been given, lay hidden
in one of the iron tubular drains which intersect the Park. From the
carelessly colloquial tone of the two statesmen, and from the difficulty
which our reporter had in keeping some frogs and toads, whose
residence he had invaded, from hopping into his ears, he could but
imperfectly gather what was said. But he distinctly heard LORD JOHN
RUSSELL suggest to his noble friend to take a peerage, to which pro-
posal the late Premier responded with an allusion to a party who had
taken a name from his habit of constant perambulation. Some laughter
followed, and then some talk in a lower key, of which our reporter
could only catch, "Lead of the House; they won't stand your

FEELING deeply conscious that at a crisis like the present, the eyes
of all the Continent (as usual) were upon him, Mr. Punch convened a
meeting at his official residence (called vulgarly his office), with the
object of determining what measures he should take for the purpose of
increasing our national defences. Keeping punctually the appoint-
ment he had made with himself, Mr. Punch, having voted himself into

THE EXPERIENCE OF A DOWNING STREET
LETTER-BAG.
GIVE ear to the groans of a Downing Street Letter-bag,
Impressed with Victoria's broadest red-seal,
Than wbich there was never a kinder, or better, bag,
One stouter to travel, or slower to feel.
When I first came on duty, I might be conceited,
At Post-Office bags apt to turn up my nose;
Had I dreamed in what style I was doomed to be treated,
How small I had sung, not e’en Downing Street knows.
I flattered myself I was meant to be trusted
With weighty despatches—important and grave-
With cipher and signet of office encrusted,
To spin down the rail, and to steam o'er the wave!
State-secrets, I deemed, would be placed in my keeping;
And protocols monarchs were
ing to see,
One whisper of which would set Europe's heart leaping,
Methought would be freely entrusted to me.
Nothing less than a Consul I thought e'er would handle
My bright Bramah lock, and my leather so white;
No taper, below an attaché's wax-candle,
The wax of my seal be permitted to light.
Bright dreams of my youth, how I laugh to recal you,
Contrasting the facts with the fancies ye wove!
Young bags by my side, I am loth to appal you,
Describing the mean and mixed calling I drove.
There's nought that a Custom-house duty is paid on,
But I have been rudely compelled to convey :
No burden, the basest that bag can be laid on,
But I must find room for it, blush as I may!
No man or no woman that boasts an attaché
By way of acquaintance but makes me a fag;
Nought's too hot or too heavy, too trenchant or trashy,
To ask for a place in the Downing Street Bag.
Odder bed-fellows misery ne'er brought together,
Than at times in my bosom have lain side by side;
Till with laughter I oft could have split my own leather,
But that laughter was checked by my sore-wounded pride.
Pork-pies in my depths have with protocols jostled,
Dutch cheese and despatches disputed for space;
A Treaty I've seen in a crinoline nestled,
And a pink billet-doux, round a Hampshire hog's face.
I've borne toys and tariffs, ties, trimmings, and treaties,
Pills, pickle-pots, breaches of peace, hunting smalls;
Declarations of war, sugar-candy and sweeties,
Shilling razors, sharp answers, revolvers, recals.
I have ta'en parcels heavy as MALMESBURY's letters;
Lace light as a PALMERSTON's touch-and-go style;
Many bales of red-tape, and some slave-trading fetters,
The Complete Story-Teller and Moniteur's file.
I've carried the news of the exit of BOMBA;
The report of POERIO's escape from his chain ;
CAVOUR's declaration, and “Suoni la tromba,"
And a head of PRINCE PLON-Plon in alicampane.
And wonder of wonders-o'er all I have carried-
A despatch of LORD MALMESBURY's late I conveyed,
Wherein common sense to guod English was married,
And not e'en a blunder in spelling was made !!

MA
THE BALLET OF THE BRAVE.
A LETTER in the Pays represents a portion of
the French army in Italy as a questionable race
of beings. Describing some amateur theatricals
got up by some of the men, it says that,
“Some of our Zouaves were lodged in a barn which the
inhabitants had converted into a theatre for a strolling
company, and there still remained a stage, a curtain,
scenery and foot-lights.
In the evening the
theatre was crowded, and the performances were charm-
ingly varied ; namely, a vaudeville, a pantomime, a
ballet, and singing. For my own part I laughed till tears
fell from my eyes at the ballet, which was executed by a
dozen Zouaves who were attired like the dancing-girls of
the opera."
On the eve of highly probable battle, and con-
sequent departure from this life, beings capable
of dancing with the gaiety evinced by these
Frenchmen, must be either much more or
much less than common men. Either they
must have been endowed with a fortitude and
courage capable of contemplating any amount
of bodily suffering, and of meeting death with
indifference, in addition to enjoying a conscience
entirely at ease as to their ultimate destination;
or they must have been incapable of fore-
thought, and destitute of rational souls. On the
former supposition, they were saints and philo-
sophers : on the latter, apes. Their countryman
who witnessed and described the performance
was himself clearly a philosopher-a double
sage: DEMOCRITUS and HERACLITUS in one.
The sight of it occasioned him both to laugh and
weep. He naturally laughed—though he might
more naturally have hissed-at seeing the heroes
display their pas, attired like the dancing-
girls of the opera.” He more naturally wept,
perhaps, to think how soon shot or shell might
shatter the athletic frames enclosed in corset and
petticoats, and spoil the manly limbs attired
in pink fleshings and decorated with white satin
shoes. He deserves credit alike for his laughter
and his tears.

MY STARS AND GARTERS !
I SOMETIMES wish I were a King
That Honour's fountain I might be ;
And oh how fresh you'd find the spring
If Honour bubbled forth from me!
For rank and title I'd bestow,
By an old rule, on objects new:
Since I should by the maxim go,
Honour to whom the same is due.
My coronets the heads should grace
That held within the highest brain.
Science I'd give at least a place
As good as eminent Chicane;
For I think useful knowledge ought
To hold its head as high as law,
And do suppose that men of thought
Deserve no less than men of jaw.
Brave Soldiers I would still promote,
And Sailors—for they keep the peace;
And for that cause, with equal note
Would I distinguish the Police.
The knife encountered in the slums
Should merit Valour's Cross to show;
Death from a home-born savage comes
As like as from a foreign foe.
What are domestic cut-throats less
Than Sepoys, or than Sepoys more?
What else are slaves, with fell excess
Who burn to ravage England's shore?
From equal blackguards, guards alike,
Policemen act with soldiers' hearts,
And soldiers for BRITANNIA strike,
As Constables for Foreign Parts.
Inspectors I would Captains make,
Superintendents all should be

A General Officer's degree.

To guard our shores and seas :

Nor is moved by idle fears,
But he sees no harm that we all should arm
As Rifle Volunteers !
Lest sudden foes assail us,

Our Fleet—who knows ?-may fail us,
Nor serve our shores to guard.

Good reason there appears,
To have, on land, a force at hand

Our forces we'd increase;
But 'tis our foes by frighting
We best may keep at peace.
For who will dare molest us
When, to buzz about their ears,
All along our coast there swarms a host
Of Rifle Volunteers ?
Abroad ill winds are blowing,
Abroad war's vermin swarm ;,
What may hap there's no knowing,
We may not ’scape the storm.
Athirst for blood, the Eagles
May draw our dove's-nest near;
But we'll scare away all birds of prey

No menace we're intending,
Offence to none we mean,

Hark, how the priests are chanting,

Their side strength to slay their foes ;
Hostile Gregorian notes,

That's the way your True Church goes.

THE SCHOOLMASTER AT HOME.
THE “Apposition” of St. Paul's School (whatever it
may be) was this year “honoured,” we are told," by the
attendance of an audience at once highly classical, clerical,
and select.” Among the guests of the Head Master * were
po less than five Bishops, and we have no time to count
how many minor Reverends, two of whom, we know not
why, are called irreverently." posers.” For the amuse-
ment of these dignitaries, or it may have been the reverse,
certain "excerpta” were recited from old and modern
writers; including a scene from Love's Labour Lost, in
which we are told-
MR. HOWARD was a droll Dull, Mr. GARDINER a comical Costard,
and MR. BENNETT a good Sir Nahaniel (Curates, by the way, are not
knighted in these degenerate days)."
After this, for the further delectation of the Reverends,
came a specimen
“Of the turgid declamation of that stilted declamation of grief, the
tragedy of the Phoenisse, doubtless dear to the ranters, if not the
Roscii, of antiquity."
And to wind up the amusements, there was given a scene
from the Persa of PLAUTUS; in which we are told that-
“When Dordalus the pimp was beaten by the boy (Pægnium)
with a hearty 'take that' kind of verberation, every one laughed
aloud, perforce : the doleful.perculit me prope" of 'MR. HOWARD
was irresistible, and the boys in the rear of the room appeared
highly delighted at this practical mode of conjugating toe verb
τύπτω.”
At the close of the speeches, we are told that the Head
Master, at the request of the Bishops, announced the
addition of an extra week's holiday, which gratifying state
ment was “received with the vociferous cheers of the boys
present. After this announcement, which concluded the
business that was done rotundo ore, the guests, we learn,
retired to the house of the Head Master, where, the
reporter states, an elegant refection was prepared for
their refreshment."
This is very obviously the language of the schoolmaster.
In the language of the school, they had “ a jolly good
blow-out.”

TARPEIA. A WARNING.
As one Ré Galantuomo should write to another,
This letter, beneath his own broad British seal,
King Punch sends King VICTOR EMMANUEL, his brother;
With best wishes for his, and Sardinia's weal.
With intrest, dear brother, right honest and bearty,
We have watch'd the past progress of you and your state ;
Seen Patriotism still vanquishing Party,
And teaching how e'en a small power may be great.
Each stout-hearted protest 'gainst Austrian pretension,
In our brotherly heart a quick echo has found;
Each effort to solder Italian dissension,
Us to you, heart and hope, still more closely has bound.
From the foot of your Alps, Freedom's chosen dominion,
Shone your light-joy to friend, rage and envy to foe;
While the black Austrian Vulture expanded her pinion,
Like a death-shade o'er Lombardy, crouching in woe.
We trusted, we loved you ;, we shared in your gladness,
As Italy, state after state, own'd you friend;
And tyranny, stung by that joy into madness, ,
Bade whet claw and talon, the victim to rend.
Had the vulture made swoop—'ere the summons was spoken,
Shield to shield, sword by sword, we had stood, close allied,
Vulture-wings, vulture-talons, our onset had broken,
While Red Cross and Tricolor waved side by side.
But you waxed hot and hasty; you bent to impatience,
You bade to your borders the might of the Gaul:
He needed no challenge: asked no provocations :
So eager to come, he scarce waited a call.
Shall Eagle be trusted to war upon Vulture ?
Bird of rapine against bird of rapine array ?
As well Light wed Darkness, Brute Force embrace Culture,
As Absolute Will second Freedom's essay.
Shall grapes grow on thorns ; or shall figs spring on thistles ?
Blame not those who ne'er look such strange fruitage to see:
What kin owns the wind, round your snow-peaks that whistles,
With the breatlı courtiers utter, bow'd head and bent knee?
Be our wish what it may, 't will not chase evil omen ;
We think of the legend of Rome's early day;
Of Tarpeia, who opened the gate to the foemen,
Nor dream'd her that opened they first would betray.
She had seen the gold gleam-by the well as she tarried-
Of their bracelets; to womanish longing she yields:
She would ope, for the gauds on their arms that they carried :
They promised; they entered; she died 'neath their shields.
May the lot of Tarpeia from you be averted !
For your too easy faith may you ne'er have to blush:
When by these, your defenders, betrayed and deserted,
You find that the shields which should shelter, can crush.
Lord Derby's Garter.
On the out-going. Minister's step, some
Have made a ridiculous din, Sir;
If you can't get blue ribbon at Epsom,
Why shouldn't you get it at Windsor.
