NNIHILATING, without an effort, some weeks of time, MR. Punch presented himself at the door
of the Congress of Paris, 1860.
The door did not fly open at his approach, but a herd of dukes, sentinels, marquises, porters,
counts, gentlemen-in-waiting, and other menials on guard, prostrated themselves before him, and abjectly
begged that he would retire, as it was as much as their lives were worth to suffer any intrusion upon
the Conclave.
“Your lives | Retire | Intrusion Ha! hal’’ exclaimed his Serene Haughtiness, with a glance of
flame that instantly scorched up all their tinsel stars and gold fripperies into unhandsome shrivel.
“Away, Canaille /*
Only the giant HoMER (through GEoRGE CHAPMAN) can worthily narrate the next terror. Even
as the godlike Hector, coming before the massy substance and the stupendous frame of the Grecian gate,
did heave up an immeasurable stone, and send it thundering through the planks with forceful sway, did
the immortal PUNCH. Raising in the air an awful Volume, morally speaking,
“It was so huge a one,
That two vast yeomen of most strength, such as these times beget,
Could not from Earth lift to a cart, yet he did brandish it
Alone (Saturnius made it light) and swinging it as nought,
He came before the planky gates that all for strength were wrought,
And kept the post—twofold they were, and with two rafters barred,
High, and strong-locked. He raised the Tome, bent to the hurl so hard,
And made it with so main a strength that all the gates did crack,
The rafters left them, and the folds from one another brake;

iv. PREFACE. [DECEMBER 31, 1859.
|
The hinges piecemeal flew, and through the fervent little Rock
Thundered a passage, with his weight the inwall his breast did knock;
And in rushed PUNch, as fierce and grim as any stormy night,
His brass arms round about his breast reflected terrible light.”
And there, in mute astonishment and dismay, sat the Congress, cowering as the tremendous apparition
broke upon the Members. The very feathers of their pens stood on end with terror, and the ink turned
pale in the silver standishes.
“Sol’” said M.R. Punch. And as that stern eye slowly traversed from face to face, the agitation
became general. Only the Lion of Britain, of all there assembled, gazed calmly upon his great, yet
terrible friend, and winked a welcome.
In the midst of them all, there, upon the velvet-covered Council Board, had descended the mighty
Tome. They looked at it as men might regard a suddenly alighting bombshell—this instant an iron
sphere, the next, an iron storm.
Yet there was a difference in their bearing. Restraining himself, by a strong will, the Elected
of the Millions sat, silent as the Sphynx. The Austrian muttered Latin invocations taught him by his
Jesuits. The Russian shuddered as he thought of Sebastopol and its feu d'enfer. The Prussian glanced
at the door, but then bore himself manfully. The Sardinian half moved to dash his plumed hat upon
the book, but forbore. The Pope bonneted himself and bewailed aloud in a “holy sorrow.” For the
rest, they were simply flabberghasted.
“Listen!” said MR. Punch. For the only time in his life he spoke needlessly. They were intent
as “the trapped creature that hears the hunter coming up the path.”
“You are here to adjust the Affairs of Europe,” proceeded MR. Punch, in a voice that sank deep
into every bosom.
“Before you Dare to take them in hand, take My Counsels to your hearts. There are my
Counsels]" He pointed to the Tome that lay before them. “At your peril neglect this, and I will
brand your Congress in such sort that no lapse of Ages shall wear out my fire-mark. Be wise 1"
He turned, and departed. But he left upon the Congress Board his

POLITICAL
HE new Administration under LoRD PALMERSTON having
met with the approval of the people by the re-election of
Ministers to their vacated seats, Parliament reassembled on
the 30th of June, and proceeded at once to state the policy
of the new Government as set forth in the “Essence of
Parliament.”
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER called the attention of the House to
the deficiencies of the Navy, and other Members spoke as to
providing vigorous measures of defence against any aggression
which might be made upon England; and a most powerful
stimulant to the public excitement was given by a speech
delivered by LoRD LYNDHURST on the subject in the House of
Lords on the 5th of July. His remarks were made with a
view to defence and not aggression. As this remarkable
speech created a deep sensation throughout the country, we
give it at some length:—
“Hitherto, he said, we had relied on what we called "our wooden walls as
our best defence, and experience justified our reliance. Another source of
confidence was the difficulty of transporting troops from the opposite coasts
to our own, and under the old system we had perfect security. But now a
change had occurred. No one could tell what would be the result of the
application of steam power to naval warfare. In a great measure it would
deprive us of the advantage we derived from skilful sailors and give numbers
an advantage; and, therefore, we could not rely perfectly upon our naval
defences. At present we surpassed France in line-of-battle ships, but she
was and would be superior in steam frigates. The French could man a ship
as soon as she was afloat with perfectly trained men; we could not. We
required a reserve, France did not ; because, if we were beaten, we were
at her mercy; if she were beaten, we could not invade her. We ought to
have a Channel fleet able to combat France and Russia ; and a Mediterranean
fleet to hold the road to India. We should have a squadron in the West
Indies, and a reserve of seamen, which should be created without delay.
“Steam bridges the Channel, as Lord PALMERston had said. France
could bring an army together, place it on board without exciting observation,
and land it in a few hours on our shores. “I know,” continued the Noble
Lord, ‘that in 1849, when France sent troops to Civita Vecchia, one frigate
SUMMARY.
carried a distance of 300 miles 2000 soldiers with all the munitions of war. I
am further aware, that a much larger force than that can be embarked for a
short period of time on board a frigate, and a force still greater on board a
ship of the line. I know from information which I have received, and the
accuracy of which I do not doubt, that the French are at the present moment
building steamers for the purpose of transporting troops, each of which is
being constructed to carry 2500 men with all the necessary stores. This,
therefore, is the description of force which you must prepare yourselves to
meet. What then, my Lords, does it become our duty to do? What pre-
cautions does it behove us to take? What force ought we to maintain in
order to be prepared for any emergency which may arise? My answer is, a
force of regular troops—not Volunteers—not undisciplined men, but, I repeat,
a force of regular troops, capable of opposing any military force which in all
probability can be landed on our shores. It is absolutely imperative upon
us to maintain such a force. It is a duty which we owe to ourselves. It is
a duty which we owe to the character of our country. But, my Lords,
independently of all this, we must provide for our garrisons, and also for
that which is of greater importance still—our arsenals. They are, I regret to
say it, at present in a very imperfect state of defence.’ He placed the force
required at 100,000 men, including the trained Militia. “Every observation,
my Lords, which I have made on this object applies as well to Ireland as to
this country. Perhaps the precautions which I have indicated may be even
more necessary in the case of the former than the latter. Ireland may pos:
sibly be looked upon on the other side of the Channel as one of the “oppressed
nationalities”; as a country trampled upon by a nation differing from her in
customs, in language, and in religion. We cannot tell what misrepresenta-
tions may be made, we must, at all events, my Lords, provide equally for
the safety of Ireland as for our own." He could not glance over the past and
compare it with the present without feelings of humiliation. “I recollect
the day when every part of the opposite coast was blóckaded by an English
fleet. I remember the victory of Camperdown and that of St.Vincent, won
by Sir J. Jervis. I do not forget the great victory of the Nile, nor, last of
all, that triumphant fight at Trafalgar, which almost annihilated the navies
of France and Spain. I contrast the position which we occupied at that
period with that which we now hold. I recollect the expulsion of the French
from Egypt; the achievement of victory after victory in Spain; the British
Army established in the South of France, and then that great battle by which
that war was terminated. But I may be asked, “Why do you think such
measures requisite: Are we not in alliance with France? Are we not on
terms of friendship with Russia? What other Power can molest us?” To
these questions, my Lords, my answer shall be a short and a simple one. I
will not consent to live in dependence on the friendship or the forbearance
of any country. I rely solely on my own vigour, my own exertion, and my
own intelligence. Does any noble Lord in this House dissent from the

INTRODUCTION.
I Age
principle which I have laid down I rejoice, my Lords, to find that such is not
the case. But while this is a matter for congratulation, I regret to be obliged
to say that we do not stand well upon the continent of Europe. I do not
think late events have improved our position in that respect. But I go
further, my Lords, and express my belief, as the result of my own careful
observation, that if any plausible ground of difference should arise between
this country and France, and that difference should lead to hostilities, the
declaration of war with England on the part of the Government of that
country would be hailed with the utmost enthusiasm, not only by the army
of France, but by the great mass of the French people." If I am asked
“ will you not rely upon the assurances, and the courtesy of the EMPEROR
Napoleos " " I reply, that I have a great respect for that high person, and
that I will not enter into any explanation on this subject, but will leave
every noble Lord to draw his own conclusions, and to form his own opinions.
This, however, I will say, and I can say it without impropriety. If I am
asked, “whether I cannot place reliance in the EMPERoRNA poleoN ?” I reply
with confidence, that I cannot place reliance in him, because he is in a
situation in which he cannot place reliance on himself. He is in a situation
in which he must be governed by circumstances, and I will not consent that
the safety of this country should depend on such contingencies. My Lords,
self-reliance is the best road to distinction in private life. It is equally
essential to the character and to the grandeur of a nation. It will be neces-
sary for our defence, as I have already stated, that we should have a military
force sufficient to cope with any Power or combination of Powers that may
be brought against us.'"
To this speech MR. BRIGHT made a most unbecoming reply,
and Lord LYNDIIURST afterwards took occasion to explain his
reasons for having called public attention to the subject of our
defences. As to the charge of age, and of being an old Peer,
he pleaded guilty, and at the same time he duly acknowledged
the power of the sarcasm, so pointed, so keen, so bitter, and
so creditable to the taste and talents of the Hon. Member wh9
had made so extraordinary a discovery. As to the charge of
making remarks calculated to wound the susceptibility of a
neighbouring nation, nothing was further from his intention,
which was only to arouse this country to the necessity of
putting its defences in an efficient state. It might be the
policy of some private individuals, when one cheek was smitten,
to turn the other cheek to the smiter, but such was not his
feeling, nor ought it to be that of a great nation.
The measures adopted in favour of the Volunteer movement,
and the consideration of Church-rates, Revision of the
Liturgy, Indian Finance, and other measures, are all referred
to in the “Essence of Parliament,” and we shall therefore
occupy our limited space by a summary of the War in Italy
and its results, to which constant reference is made in the
present Volume.
A remarkable speech of the EMPEROR NApoleoN, addressed
to M. HuDNER, the Austrian Minister, on the 1st of January,
1859, was the first indication of the coming storm. “I regret,”
he said, “that our relations with your Government are not so
good as they have been hitherto; but I beg you to assure the
EMPERoR that my personal feelings towards him are not
changed.” The Moniteur endeavoured subsequently to allay
the popular excitement by declaring there was nothing in the
diplomatic relations of France to cause anxiety. The speech
of the KING OF SARDINIA, however, indicated that the en-
croachments of Austria would have to be resisted, and the
marriage of PRINCE NAPOLEON to the PRINCEss CLOTILDE
pointed to another alliance in the hour of need. A circular to
the diplomatic agents of Austria from Count BUOL stimulated
the Sardinian Chambers to authorise a loan of fifty millions.
SIGNOR LANZA, the Minister of Finance, having stated that
the extraordinary armaments of Austria in the Lombardo-
Venetian kingdom and along the frontier of the Po and Ticino,
together with the distribution and concentration of troops in
strong masses at Cremona, Placenza, and Pavia, made it the
duty of the King's Government to take precaution for the
security and honour of the country. Statements of grievances
against Austria, and counter-statements by that Power, were
put forth, and Count CAvour excited the admiration of *"
by his manly, cloquent and patriotic address to the Chambers,
The EMPEROR NAPOLEON, on the opening of the French
Chambers, declared that his continued desire was to adhere to
his declaration at Bordeaux, that “ l'Empire c’est la pair;"
and, after congratulating the nation on the friendly alliance
with this country, added, “The Cabinet of Vienna and mine,
on the contrary, I say it with regret, have often found them.
selves at variance on questions of principle, and a great spirit
of conciliation was required to succeed in solving them,
Thus, for instance, the reorganisation of the Danubian Princi-
palities could only be effected after numerous difficulties, which
have hindered the full satisfaction of their most legitimate
desires; and if I were asked what interest France has in those
distant countries which the Danube waters, I should reply
that the interest of France is everywhere where there is a just
and civilising cause to promote.
“In this state of things, there is nothing extraordinary
that France should draw closer to Piedmont, which had been
so devoted during the war, so faithful to our policy during
peace. The happy union of my well-beloved cousin PRINCE
NApoleoN with the daughter of KING WIcton-EMMANUEL is
not one of those unusual events for which one must seek some
hidden reason, but the natural consequence of the community
of interests of the two countries, and of the friendship of the
two Sovereigns.
“For some time past the state of Italy and her abnormal
position, where order cannot be maintained except by foreign
troops, has justly disquieted diplomacy. This is, however,
not a sufficient motive for believing in war. Let some invoke
it with all their hearts, without legitimate reasons; let others,
in their exaggerated fears, amuse themselves by showing to
France the dangers of a new coalition; I shall remain firm in
the path of right and justice, and of the national honour; and
my Government will not allow itself either to drift or to fear,
because my policy will never be provoking nor pusillanimous.
“Away then with these false alarms, these unjust suspi-
cions, these interested apprehensions ! Peace, I hope, will not
be disturbed. Resume, then, calmly the usual course of your
labours.”
Mr. Punch did not place implicit faith in this statement;
and subsequent events proved the correctness of his foresight.
The English Government attempted to mediate between the
parties, and Russia proposed a Congress, but Prussia pursued
an independent policy. On the 23rd of April, BARON DE
KELLERs, being aide-de-camp to the Austrian General,
GYULAI, arrived in Turin with a summons from Austria,
calling upon Sardinia to disarm. To this peremptory demand
Count CAvour returned an animated reply, and the next
day KING WICTOR-EMMANUEL issued a proclamation to his
troops, announcing the insulting demand which Austria had
made, and which he had rejected with the contempt it de-
served. At the same time another proclamation was addressed
to the Italians, countersigned by CAvou R, and the advanced
posts of the Austrian Army crossed the Ticino on the 26th of
April, and were shortly followed by the whole five corps
d’armée, which step called forth a strong protest from
England. Similar expressions of dissent were issued by the
EMPEROR of THE FRENCH, and on the 10th of May he reached
Genoa, where he was joined by WicroR-EMMANUEL. The
battle of Montebello soon followed, and the Austrians retired
across the Ticino. The sanguinary fight at Magenta succeeded,
the Austrians were again defeated after a brave resistance,

INTRODUCTION.
PAGE
and the French EMPEROR and the KING OF SARDINIA entered
Milan. The same success attended the Allies, culminating in
the battle of Solferino, which led to the Armistice signed at
Willafranca.
The bases of peace were as follows:–
“The Two Sovereigns will favour the creation of an Italian Confederation:
“That Confederation shall be under the honorary presidency of the Holy
Father.
“The EMPERoR or AUSTRIA cedes to the EMPERoR of the FRENCH his
rights over Lombardy, with the exception of the fortresses of Mantua and
Peschiera, so that the frontier of the Austrian possessions shall start from
the extreme range of the fortress of Peschiera, and shall extend in a direct
line along the Mincio as far as Grazio; thence to Scorzarolo and Luzana to
the Po, whence the actual frontiers shall continue to form the limits of
Austria. The EMPERoR of THE FRENch will hand over (remettra) the ceded
territory to the KING OF SARDIN1A.
“Venetia shall form part of the Italian Confederation, though remaining
under the crown of the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA.
“The Grand DUKE of Tusca NY and the DUKE of MoDENA return to their
States, granting a general amnesty.
“The two Emperors will ask the Holy Father to introduce indispensable
reforms into his States.
“A full and complete amnesty is granted on both sides to persons com-
promised in the late events in the territories of the belligerent parties.”
This Treaty (confirmed at Zurich) greatly disappointed the
Italians, and the Assembly at Romagna at once threw off
its allegiance to the Pope, and declared fealty to VICTOR-
EMMANUEL.
We have reserved mention of that noble, gallant, and
unselfish patriot, GIUSEPFE GARIBALDI, who stood forth so
PAGE
prominently in the cause of his country at this crisis of her
fate. He placed himself at the head of a band of Chasseurs
of the Alps, and advanced on the north-west of Lombardy.
At the end of May he drove the Austrians out of Como, and
then crossed the Sesia, when he again repulsed the enemy
opposite Vercelli. On entering Lombardy, GARIBALDI issued
the following indignant and heart-stirring proclamation to
the inhabitants:—
“Lombards,-You are called to a new life, and you will respond to the
appeal as your fathers did of yore at Ponsida and Legnano. The enemy is
the same as ever—pitiless, a black assassin, and a robber. Your brethren of
every province have sworn to conquer or die with you. It is our task to
avenge the insults, the outrages, and the servitude of twenty generations;
it is for us to leave to our children a patrimony freed from the pollution of a
foreign domination. Victor-EMMANUEL, chosen by the national will for our
supreme chief, sends me to organise you for this patriotic fight. I deeply
feel the sanctity of this mission, and I am proud to command you. To
arms, then Bondage must cease. He who can seize an arm and does not,
is a traitor. Italy, with her children united, and freed from foreign domina-
tion, will know how to reconquer the rank which Providence has assigned
her among nations.”
Again, in June, he drove the Austrians to Castenedolo, where
the main body of the enemy endeavoured to surround his pur-
suing troops; but GARIBALDI, coming to the rescue, defeated
the Austrians with great slaughter. Mr. Punch did himself
the honour to forward to this illustrious man a Field Glass,
which he has reason to believe was not unacceptable to the
Great Italian Patriot.

THE entire invading army, consisting of 239,572 soldiers of all arms
having been destroyed to a man, the pirandières, after much kind
treatment, having been divided among the London managers of theatres,
for operatic purposes, and the captured Emperor of France and Italy
having, at his own request, resumed his place as a London policeman,
the people had leisure to note the various episodes of the campaign.
Among the most brilliant of these were the deeds performed ; the

having been resolved to permit the invaders to land before attacking
them, Ramsgate was handed over to the legal riflemen, and during the

“THRICE is he armed that hath his quarrel just.” Victor EMMANUEL's quarrel
being just, the chances on his side against that of Austria are three to one;
and, his, accordingly, is the stronger side. But generosity always prefers the
weaker side; therefore, if the British nation is generous, it will choose that of
Austria. The side of Austria will thus become the stronger side. But might is
right; consequently we shall be on the right side: therefore our quarrel will be
just: therefore, we shall be thrice armed; thus in that state of dignity and defence
which is the becoming attitude of this great country. True, when our own
becomes the stronger side, other generous nations, if there are any, will then take
the part of our enemies; but that will not signify, so long as we are able to take
our own part, and set the rest of the world at defiance,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
How To DREss our RIFLEMEN.
EveR zealous as he is to encourage a good cause, and in every way
to strengthen our national defences, Mr. Punch would be the last to
ridicule our Rifle Clubs, or to poke fun at the patriots, who are
enrolled as volunteers. But he cannot avoid noticing that, judging
from the letters which have reached him and the Times, by far greater
anxiety is felt throughout the country on the subject of the dressing
than the drilling of our riflemen: and that the forming of a corps is
thought of vastly less importance than its uniforming. ore care and
thought seems taken that our volunteers should look effective on
arade, than that they be made efficient in their practice. . In fact,
y-killing seems to be the chief destruction aimed at; and many of
the suggestions which have been lately sent to him, Mr. Punch inclines
to fancy must have been º by tailors. As specimens of the taste
which has been nationally displayed in the devising of a dress, Mr.
Punch has only space for the following leash of letters:–
“Werily friend Punch, these be parlous times. The evil Spirit, War,
is moving Sons of Belial to beat each other's brains out. Peradventure
there be men whose heads are empty as their pockets, and who have
as few brains as they have halfpence to be knocked out. But, truly,
thou and I, friend Punch, can ill afford to lose our moneys or our heads,
and we need to use the latterfor protection of the former. I am a man
of peace, but I have bought a rifle, and I can hit a half-crown at above
two hundred paces. I love
all men—even foreigners—
for are they not my brethren?
But if my brethrensmiteme,
shall Inot in brotherhood re-
turn to them the compliment.
“Thine, in all sincerity of
spirit,
“EPHRAIM BRoapBRIM.”
“Postscriptum. – What
thinkest thou, friend Punch
of my device for a new dress?
To the coat of ancient date
I have, for sake of freedom,
ioined the modern ‘knicker.
ockers.” The hat is copied
from one worn by DRAw-
THE-Long-Bow BRoapBRIM,
an ancestor of mine, who was
a fighting-man in NoLL's
time. The broadbrim, as
you see, serves well to shade
the eyes, and will in wet
weather do instead of an
umbrella. The workboxworn
in front is meantin war time
to hold cartridges, but when
used in times of ſpeace, on
practice or parade, will serve with equal handiness to hold cigars or
is sandwiches. I mean the suit to be of drab, which,
º BRIGHT shows us, is a thorough fighting
colour.”
“MAJOR PIPECLAY presents his compliments
to Punch, and begs to forward a rough sketch
ºf a dress, which Major, PIEEcLay has invented
for a Rifle Corps, and which, he feels per-
suaded, will be nationally adopted. That our
volunteers may look as smart and soldier-like as
possible, Major PIPEcLAY thinks their uniform
should in most respects be similar to that worn
by the Regulars. A stiff and tight-sleeved tunic,
with cramping shoulder-knots and cross-belts:
trousers, scanty in the seat and baggy on the
boots: the regulation leather stock, and the hot
and heavy shako: form a dress, which in the
eyes of the best military authorities, is more
suited for a soldier than any other suit. It com-
bines ease with elegance in a most marked degree,
and clearly serves not less for ornament than use.
The drooping plume is an addition of MAJOR
PIPEcLay's own inventing, and will assist the
taking aim, as it will serve to shade the eyes
although it may be feared that it will now an
- - * then get into them. Another of its uses is,
º 2:- that it effectually conceals the , face, which
----- when the corps is ambushed will be of marked
advantage to them.”
“I ;3 Punch, old Cock, Bobby Jones and I have been and joined
a Iłiſle ſui, and we are rather in a fix about the dress one ought to
sport. You see, this is a free country, and every man may wear what
toggery he likes: and as the Government have said nothing not to
nobody about uniforms, of course every corps of Riflemen is left to
choose its own. Now, the thing one wants to aim at, is to hit of
something neat and not the other thing, you know; for if one comes out
extensive and makes one's
self conspicuous, one’s as
certain to be “potted” as
a stale Yarmouth bloater.
But the dress I’ve been
concocting will allay all
fear of that. Just cast
your eye on this impromptu
sketch of it:
“There! I question if
you'd knock off a more
quiet stylethan that; and,
excepting the buff, boots
(which I own to having
cribbed from a drama at
the Vic.), it’s all my own
invention; all quite “new
and º as they say

they are copied from the
French. Of course the
colours may be worn ac-
cording to the taste and
fancy of the wearers. I
should myself suggest that
the coat be a pea-green
one with blue and yellow
facings, , the trousers
either º or cherry-
coloured a la H. R. H.’s
Own, buff boots, as afore- - -
said, with lavender silk linings, and the hat light brown or grey, with
aF. or purple plume. As to the rifle and accoutrements, they are
9f course of quite a secondary importance, and one may therefore
leave them to be furnished by the Government, I would, however,
adopt the hint which, I saw lately in the Times, that every volunteer
should be armed with a long spear, in order to defend himself when
coming to close quarters. #e object of a Rifleman is to keep himself
as much out of sight as may be, and to be quick in his movements
from one ambush to another; and the dress I have suggested, with
the addition of the lance and a rifle made as cumbrous as the Govern-
ment can make it, will most admirably serve for both of these require-
ments. A showy uniform like this, too, would be sure to please the
ladies: and that, I take it, is what nine men out of ten of us are
clubbing for. So, give your orders, gents, while the tailor’s in the
room, and if you don't loºk nobby 'taint the fault of
“CHARLEY Wobbles.”

AN END OF FALSE IMPRISONMENT.
The result of a late trial in the Court of Queen's Bench seems to
show, that the inspection to which private lunatic asylums are at
present subject is insufficient to prevent the occasional incarceration in
those º of persons of tolerably sound mind. Hence arises
the question, how to secure inspectors vigilant enough to look sharp,
and see that, in the mad-houses which it is their business to supervise,
nobody that has a right to go loose is shut up, . There are also asylums
of a somewhat different nature from those which lunatics are confined
in, namely, convents and nunneries, the inmates of which have
voluntarily subjected themselves to perpetual imprisonment, in some
cases, it is stated, accompanied with private whipping. Some of the
persons who have taken this step, sometimes, there is reason to believe
subsequently repent of it, and wish to get out; and are then detaine
ainst their will. The bare possibility of this case renders it desirable
that conventual institutions should, like retreats for the deranged, be
placed under the superintendence of proper officers. All proposals to
this end, however, have hitherto been resented as insults by those who
believe, or pretend to believe, that all monks and nuns are satisfied
with their condition, and that all superiors of those fraternities and
sisterhoods are incapable of maltreating the people who are in their
power.
Now, an arrangement for the inspection of monastic houses might
be divested of aught insulting by a simple expedient, which is sug:
gested by their aspect in relation to lunatic asylums. let keepers of
the latter institutions be the inspectors of the former; and, rice versä,
let abbots and abbesses, or ecclesiastics delegated by them, be
empowered to overhaul the private Bedlams. º this natural system
of give and take, bear and forbear, affront would be precluded, and
mutual jealousy and .*.*.*.* ensure the result that no sane

nition ? Hollow cylinders. And what are ever so many soldiers
without sufficient food? Food—and poor food—for powder. There is
too much reason to fear that one well-fed Frenchman could lick, three
Englishmen in an advanced stage of starvation; and though our
English ancestors won Agincourt upon very reduced rations, it is not
to be hoped that their descendants would be equally fortunate on a
similar occasion, if “these English" were “shrewdly out of beef.”

“Injustice to Ireland” and “Injustice to Scotland,” until it, has
become tiresome to laugh at either the one or the other. We think
we will change the humour a bit, by trying to raise the cry of “Injus-
tice to England.” It strikes us that a great deal of fun might, begot
out of that cry, and if our Scotch and Irish friends would only be kind
enough to take the matter seriously, and fancy that we were in earnest,
the fun would be materially increased....We shall put a few dozen rods

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 7
MOTHERS.
RANSPORTED with pleasure,
Mr. Punch notices a glimmer-
ing of sense and reason in the
ſº. of Convocation.
n the Lower House, the other
day, among the notices of mo-
tion given, there was at least
| onejudicious and praiseworthy
proposal, namely,
“That an alteration be made in
the 29th canon, which pohibits pa-
º rents from being sponsors to their
| own children.”
| The change in an absurd
and vexatious regulation thus
contemplated will be a real
º blessing to the Paterfamilias
of the future. The necessity
of *...* godfathers and
godmothers—at least of pro-
curing god-fathers—is at pre-
sent one of the greatest diffi.
culties of Paterfamilias's posi-
tion. It obliges him to ask
favours of a number of per-
sons who are mere acquaint-
ances—for what Paterfamilias
with even a moderate famil
has intimate friends enough
to suffice his needs respecting
the font? It therefore involves
the admission of comparative
strangers into an intimacy which may be unpleasant. The foolish usage which requires that
he who stands sponsor shall also stand what is vulgarly called Sam, as for instance, by
forking out spoons, aggravates the annoyance of having to make such requests. If the
spoons were customarily wooden, or the cup which is their alternative, crockery-ware, as
they should be if intended to be symbolic and appropriate, the delicacy of Paterfamilias
would be spared for this, matter; but, Society demands that the vicarious renunciation of
9mps and vanities shall be signalised by tokens of a material not meaner than silver: and
Materfamilias, would be disgusted with the shabbiness that would dream of anything else.
So Paterfamilias has, in effect, to ask men on whom he feels that he has no sort of claim, to
present his children with plate. This is not pleasant to any gentleman.
“To ask for a gift of money or money's worth, however, is ten times less repugnant to the
feelings of a gentleman endowed with conscience plus the sense of honour, than to request
another gentleman to promise and vow that which he cannot º perform. Godfathers
and godmothers might as well promise that their godchildren shall be taught Hebrew, as
romise to 'see that they receive a Christian education. The actual parents of children—
aterfamilias and Materfamilias themselves—are the only persons who can make any such
promise with any prospect whatever of being able to keep it. -
Paterfamilias must not entertain too sanguine a hope that the proposal for reforming the
29th canon will be accepted. The majority of the Clergy will surprise Mr. Punch very much
if they consent to the relaxation of any sort of bondage that oppresses the people. But
entlemen, who sign articles in a non-natural sense, or in no sense whatever, may perhaps
É. excused for not understanding the scruples felt by others in *. promises and vows of
which the observance is impossible, and in treating the most solemn engagements as
ecclesiastical fictions.
NON-NATURAL FATHERS AND
A NICE THING TO SAY TO A GENTLEMAN.
MossIEUR WEUILLOT, our favourite of the Univers, has been publishing some conversations |}
he had with PRINCE METTERNICH. Here is a sample of one of them:—
‘‘ ‘Count BATTHYANY,” said METTERNICH, on taking leave of him, “you will persevere in a wrong course,
and I make you this prediction.” “What?’ ‘Count BATTHYANY, you will be hanged.'"
This is as elegant as it was kind. We do not know a more agreeable character than a
tolerated old, fogey, who is continually prophesying unpleasant things of his friends. All the
Prince's predictions, however, did not come so true as the above. There is the celebrated one
of the Deluge, which has not held water as yet, excepting so far as Austria is being gradually
washed out of the map of Europe.
Here is another sample of the Prince's refined conversation:—
“I (WEUILLot) asked the Prince his opinion of Kossuth. He told me, in one word, that he did not give
high place to that demagogue or that he placed him on the same level as BATTHYANY.”
To place KossuTH on the same level as BATTHYANY, would be, apparently, to accord him a
much higher place than the Hungarian patriot would have any wish to aspire to... Mons.

WHEREAs a grievous war is waged
In parts beyond the sea,
Wherein, against our will, engaged
Ourselves may come to be,
And therefore have the sword to draw,
To guard our native shore;
Now we, the limbs of England's law,
Have formed a Rifle Corps.
We’ll learn with perfect aim to shoot,
That so, in time of need,
We may, to any foreign suit,
Be *. ed to plead,
With force and arms to take and seize
All trespassers found here,
And every doe on this demise,
To kill and slay like deer.
We will not, judgment by default,
Let go, with laches base,
In any action of assault,
If we conduct the case.
They will the first assault commit,
Then we’ll put in our plea;
An Enfield rifle-ball, to wit,
Against their battery.
All comers we will serve upon
The writ, Ejectment j.
And lodge detainers if they run,
To save themselves by flight.
For Habeas Corpus we will move,
And numbers they’ll return
Whose bodies will our practice prove :
whom it may concern.
Our word is Fieri Facias /
Wherewith we’ll open fire,
And on them with a Capias
We’ll rush, if they retire,
And execution will ensue.
What bills can lawyer file,
Like rifles that will carry true,
And kill at half a mile?
So let all trespassers beware;
And let a foreign host
Take notice that in case they dare
To land on England's coast,
Our goods and chattels to convey,
To kill, destroy, and burn,
Ne eaeant regno–that’s to say,
They never will return.

REPORT OF AN IMPORTANT CASE
LATELY TRIED BEFORE CHIEF BARON PUNCH, AND HIS
DECISION THEREON.
BETWEEN Ayes and Noes a strange contest arose,
The Reform Bill had set them unhappily wrong;
The point in dispute was, as every one knows,
To whom the said Bill for Reform should belong.
So John was the lawyer, and argued the cause
With a great deal of skill and a head full of learning;
And Chief Baron Punch sat to balance the laws,
So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.
In behalf of the “noes” it will *. appear,
And your Lordship, he said, will undoubtedly find
That Reform has been always consigned to their care,
Which amounts to possession time out of mind.
Then explaining the cause of Reform to the Court,
Your Lordship observes how exactly it tallies, .
With the views always held by the “noes,” and in short,
It fits into their mouths like a pipe in Aunt Sally's.
Again would your Lordship a moment suppose .
Tis a case that has happened, and may be again
That the “noes” should be ayes,” and the “ayes” should be "noes,”
Pray to whom would a Bill for Reform belong then P
On the whole it appears, and my argument shows
With a reasoning the Court will never condemn,
That Reform Bills most plainly were meant for the “noes,”
And the “noes” were as plainly intended for them.
Of course, should the “noes” come in office again,
On this point they’d at once be transformed into “ayes; ”
So whichever the case is, it's equally plain,
That to either my argument justly applies.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 20–23. Owing to the absence of the principal actors in the
new drama of the Cabinet, those artists having had to give represen-
tations on various provincial stages, the scanty performances at the
WestminsterTheatre have offered, this week, no point worthy of notice,
and on the 23rd instant the House closed until the following Thursday,
when the returns of the absentees will permit the resumption of regular
business. The system of extortion by those who are entrusted with
the admission to, seats, and whom, it is now almost necessary to
bribe heavily, will, it is thought, be subject of early regulation,
and it is probable that M.R., ALBERT SMITH, and MR. BENJAMIN
WEBSTER, who have abolished that disgraceful system in the places
of entertainment under their direction, will be asked for advice as to
its extinguishment in the National Theatre at Westminster. The

contrary notwithstanding) to present it immediately in the most
efficient manner, and regardless of all expense. The First Lord is to

DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD.
ScENE–The Lower Regions. Present—Boyſ BA and Louis PHILIPPE.
The Shade of METTERNIch enters, with an easy but stealthy and
cat-like step.
Bomba (to Metternich). Welcome, caro mio, to this lower world.
Louis Philippe. Where only—to parody a well-known English epitaph
—your own diplomacy can be surpassed. -
Metternich. Your Majesty is pleased to compliment. Laudari a
laudato. I revere in your Majesty a master in that mystery of state-
craft to which I have devoted a long—and let me hope, not altogether
mis-spent—life. But where is the English epitaph you speak of P
Aſº Philippe. On the monument of a musician in Westminster
Jey.
Metternich. Ah! I did not visit that building during my residence
in London. I do not care for antiquities, or architecture. Besides, I
had so much to do at the Foreign Office, I never got further in the
day-time than Downing Street. -
Louis Philippe. Of course you visited the Houses of Parliament?
Metternich. Frequently, and with considerable curiosity. ..My fami:
liarity with continental bureaua had, I thought, abundantly illustrated
for me OxENSTIERN's famous exclamation; but the Houses of Par-
liament confirmed its truth, even more triumphantly.
Bomba (brusquely). Cospetto / What jargon is this? Who ever
heard of OxenstierN, or his &lº Wa: was it?
Metternich. “Alas! with what little wisdom the world is governed.”
Your Majesty must have become familiar with the observation—in
practice.
Bomba. Yes—I never found it required much brains to deal with my
birbone of Calabrians. But then I had the stick, and the state-prisons,
and the Police, and Holy Church.
Metternich. Great helps—doubtless; but I fear they have availed
your Majesty little more than similar instruments of Government have
availed my own august Kaiser, in Vienna.
Louis Philippe. I was always, and constitutionally, averse from
severity. I trusted to a gentler means of coercion.
Metternich. Self-interest, I presume your Majesty means—or what
Utopists call “corruption.” I am afraid that most useful means for
the maintenance of established authority broke down in your Majesty's
}. as completely as the rougher machinery in ours, and his Majesty's
ere.
Bomba. Speak for yourself. I kept my rascals down to the last. To
e sure, PoERIo and his gaol-birds got safe off to England—may
St. Januarius confound it, and its GLADston E and PALMERSTONE ;—
but at least, I died a king, and in the odour of sanctity.
Metternich. Your Majesty has my profound respect. I own, though,
that the latter fact would not have led me to anticipate the pleasure of
this meeting. I have not the advantage of ". Majesty's commanding
interest with the most Holy Catholic Church–nor (to Louis PHILIPPE)
I fear, had you, Sire.
Bomba, Eh P. You mean I ought to have been betterlodged—la su–
(pointing upwards)—I suppose there’s been some mistake about my
carta di soggiorno. St. Peter will set all that right, by-and-by. But,
Prince, I’m glad of this opportunity of talking with you. I want to
know how the world is |. governed, now ºce have gone.
Metternich. A question I have frequently put to myself, your Majesty,
during the latter years of my life; but without obtaining any satis.
factory answer.
Louis Philippe. I don't feel so much difficulty; I imagine corruption
will still be found an excellent means of maintaining authority in
France. It broke down under me, to be sure; but I was too easy.
I ought to have blended a little more of the fortiter in re with my
suaviter in modo.
Metternich. Your Majesty will excuse me, I am sure, if I presume
to differ with you. Corruption has, I fear, lost its real efficacy, as a
means of governing, no less than force and suppression. The strangest
ideas have, somehow, taken root and spread. This notion of nation-
ality, for example. How we should have laughed at Vienna, in 1815,
if any of the Congress had breathed the word ' . This feeling—that
states are not mere geographical and political entities; that there are
such things as common life, and sympathies between nations of the
same blood—is of quite modern growth, and cannot be dealt with on
any of the sound principles of government recognised till now. And
this phantasmal thing called public opinion—which presumes to call
monarchs and ministers to question, to sit in judgment even upon
congresses, and to be admitted to the confidence of diplomats—how
are we to deal with it P And these Utopian ideas of a right in
the people to participate in the work of their own government, L
§: daring habit of questioning absolute authorities in Church and
tate—
Bomba (impatiently). Bestemmie /
Metternich. I am at a loss to conceive how any government but
Martial Law will be possible much longer.
Bomba. A permanent state of siege must be established everywhere.
I hope my FRANcis will not hesitate. -
Louis Philippe (shaking his head). I fear even that will be impossible
in France, after the present régime has run its course. As to what is to
come in its place, #}. no conjecture: Davus sum—non (Edipus.
Metternich. “Après nous le deluge,” Sire, I have often said to my
august master, the late Kaiser, who, you are aware, had certain mental
peculiarities (touches his forehead).
Bomba. Mezzo matto /
Metternich. But, I confess, I had no notion the cataclysm was so
close upon our heels—in fact, that I should be called upon to transfer
my services from the late world to this our very agreeable scene of
existence (he winces), while it was actually in progress. Ce pauvre

Bomba. Corpo di Bacco / I don't

Louis Philippe. I can hardly wish even my grandson to succeed to

Metternich. And if the work of government be a growing difficulty,
the task of diplomacy is daily approaching nearer to an impossibility. It
was a delicate business, even j. one had to reckon only with Majesty
or with Ministers, with Courts or Cabinets; but now that nations

Louis Philippe. Ah! mon cher confrère, when you have been as long

account, as recommendations for employment down here. But see,
they are coming this way, to repave i. place we stand on. I recog-

THE HANDEL FEAST.
Mr. Punch's Presentation of Thanks and Testimonials.
A CRowded Meeting was held on Friday at Mr. Punch's residence, for
the purpose of presenting the thanks of the community to the founders
and up-getters of The Íſandel Feast, and to the various assistants who
had had a hand or voice in it. The meeting was attended by delegates
from all quarters of the musical world (America, and even Australia,
included); and it is almost superfluous to state that the greatest har.
my prevailed throughout the evening:
r. Punch, being unanimously voted to the Chair, commenced the
business of the meeting by observing that all present, and some eighty
thousand guests, who (as his office would not hold them) unavoidably
were absent, had enjoyed such a feast of “the Roast Beef of Music,”
as it never had before been attempted to serve up. He, therefore,
begged to move that the thanks . the guests present, and of the
eighty thousand who, from want of space, were absent, should be voted
to the founders of The Handel Feast, and to all those who had given
lent, or had vended their assistance to it. In addition to this vote o
thanks, he also begged to move that the following testimonials should be
forth with presented, as tokens of the gratitude and admiration of the
audience for the services which had been rendered for their benefit. He
therefore called on every one who had been charmed by the Centenary,
that is to say, each one of the nearly ninety thousand who had happily
attended it, to second him in carrying out the resolution following:-
“Resolved, That in addition to the Thanks of the Community,
these Testimonials be presented to the persons there with named :
“To CoMMANDER-IN CHIEF Costa, promotion to the rank of Musical
Field Marshal, with a hiton of the value of at least a housand guineas:
in recognition of his skill in the drilling of his forces, and the untiring
and energy with which he led them on throughout the whole of
the Sydenham campaign.
“To GENERAL (MANAGER) Bowley, C.C.P., & C.S.S.H.S.," ablank
cheque on the Company for his distinguished services, and a request
that he, as Manager, will fill it up to as goodly-sized a figure as his

To these and to a host of others who assisted, Mr. Punch moved that
the thanks of the nation should be given for the rich, feast of music
which had lately been provided. The resolution being carried, the
Chairman brought the business of the Meeting to a close, by expressing
his dear Judy's wish (which coincided with his own), that the success
of the Centenary would ensure its being encored in less than half-a-dozen
years, and that as we cannot have too much of such good things, there
ought every five years or so to be served up a HANDEl Feast.

A DREAM OF THE FUTURE.--THE CENTENARY OF PUNCH.
THE BALANCE OF NEUTRALITY.
THE POPE has lately been canonising two fresh Saints. In order to
lease, everybody, he chose one French Saint, and one Austrian. This
is holding the balance of neutrality with a most impartial hand. As
the Holy Father is the faithful custodian of the keys of St. Peter, of
course he will take good care that, no more Frenchmen are admitted
into the calendar than Austrians; six of the one will be counted out most
religiously to every half-dozen of the other. By the bye, considering
the kind of military sandwich that the Pope at present makes at Rome,
with the Austrians on our side, and the French on the other, we can
easily understand how the Saints were fabricated. Only they might
have spelt the word correctly—“cannonised.”
THE FIGHT FOR LOMBARDY.
Austria has long been an unwelcome guest in Lombardy, and a great
expense to her entertainers. Having the worst of the battle, it is now
time that she threw up the sponge.
A MOST GENEROUS ADMISSION.
We are so charmed with the generosity of the following beautiful
sentiment, that we cannot refuse it immortality in our columns :-
“We believe that a good Englishman is preferable any day to a bad Irishman."
What largely adds to the value of the generosity is the fact of its
having emanated from an organ that is both Irish and Roman Catholic.
After this, we may hope to see CARDINAL WISEMAN giving way tº feel-
ings of Christian charity, when he is enlarging on the theme of England,
he only fly-spot on the purity of the above sentiment is the ugly
§. it raises as to the possibility of there being “a bad Irishman.”
e would rather not have had our faith disturbed that there ever had
been, or ever could be, an Irishman who was otherwise than good.
“LE BAFTAME Du Feu.”—As PRINCE NApoleon is not yet quite
prepared for this military ceremony, it is to be postponed, we believe,
until the Italian Campaign is completely over... A pound of the best
gunpowder tea has been ordered for the occasion.

VOLUNTEERS AND VETERANS.
To the Editor of Punch.
IR, I have been preciously dis-
usted with the way in which the
apers, have been, writing about
Rifle Clubs, and volunteering their
suggestions about arming Volun-
teers. What the (blank) can penny-
a-liners know of rifle-practice,
excepting when they treat them-
selves to “six shots for a tizzy'
in their Derby dissipations, or
when they waste their time in
trying to knock over the wood
hares which Cockneys shoot at, at
Cremorne? How the (dash), Šir
can a fellow with his nose chained
to the desk pretend to have an
insight into military matters: and
what the (dash dash) can a snob
who gets his bread and cheese by
scribbling know about the dressing
or the drilling of a sharpshooter,
or the manoeuvring or management
of a corps of Volunteers? Let the
cobbler stick to his wax and the
shopman to his . and let the
penny-a-liner people, who write
what I believe are called the
leading articles, give up trying to
lead the public to imagine that the
Press knows more than the authorities, and that the rules which have
been issued for the guidance of the Rifle Clubs would have been
drawn with more .#. and with less bad English, had they been
framed (say) in Fleet Street instead of at the Horse Guards.
“In my censure of the conduct of the papers at this crisis, I must,
however, make exception of one of your contemporaries, which seems
to me to view the matter in a highly prºper light, and to pay, due
deference to the (of course) superior wisdom of us. military writers.
Knowing the disrespectful way in which, it spoke of the authorities,
when the Crimean (so called) ‘blunders’ were (as it was said) “con.
firmed by the Government Commissioners,’ it may surprise, you to
hear that the journal which I think deserves some praise is the Eraminer.
Upon the much debated subject of military dress, this paper makes
the following most sensible remarks:—
“With respect to dress, we trust that the good sense of the }. will prevent
it from being influenced by the insidious counsel of military reformers, who would
set at nought the hallowed experience of ages, and the rules and regulations of the
Horse Guards. A blacksmith and a tailor, say these doctrinaires, dress in the
manner best suited to their respective trades, and why should not a soldier do so?
simply, let us tell these wiseacres, because blacksmiths and tailors require the free
use of their limbs, whether to wield the hammer or to ply the needle; whereas the
soldier need only move by word of command, and has to preserve an outward
appearance which cannot be sacrificed with impunity. A soldier with the free use
of his arms and legs would become a mutineer in twenty-four hours, and it is from
a well-founded conviction of the necessity of muscular restraint, as a preservative
of discipline, that our military authorities insist, upon the present style of dress.
We trust therefore that the Volunteers will steer clear of all new-fangled ideas on
this subject, and conform to the existing regulations."
“The dress which the Eraminer proceeds to recommend is fashioned
on the best of military models, and if it be not serviceable, at any rate
is soldierlike:–
“A close fitting tunic, with plenty of lace and buttons; a leather stock (nothing
gives so military an appearance as a stiff neck!); a top-heavy knapsack, difficult to
put on, and impossible to shake off; cross-belts requiring daily pipe-claying;
trousers tight round the seat, and baggy round the ancles, so as to catch the
brambles and draggle in the mud; boots of the Weedon type: the serviceable and
becoming infantry shako, with the re tion great coat to sop the rain up in wet
weather, form a dress in which British soldiers have fought and conquered, and
which no brave Wolunteer should be afraid to wear."
“Afraid!, ay, that’s just it, Sir! One of the chief beauties of the
British soldier's dress is that it serves to test the courage of the wearer.
A man must needs be gifted with no ordinary pluck, to face not merely
death, but a life of killing torture. Cramped and fettered as he is by
h's hard, stiff stock and cross-belts, and weighed down by his shako
and “top-heavy’ knapsack, his powers of endurance are put early to
the proof, and one may tell within a week or so what sort of stuff he’s
made of. Moreover, knowing what a deadly foe consumption is to
face, a man who dare stand water, in a regulation sop-coat, may be
trusted to stand fire as an agreeable alternative ſinsist then that
the dress most fit for Volunteers, is one that should be ſashioned on
the model which the Horse Guards has, in its all-excelling wisdom,
inyented for the ‘regulars. Of course we military men can put no
faith in Volunteers until they give us ocularly good proof of their
valour; and for this reason alone I should advise them to adopt such
a uniform as ours, though its usefulness and elegance are quite enough
WOL. xxxv II.
to recommend it. With regard to the colour to be chosen for their
clothing, your clear-headed contemporary most sensibly says this:-
“Among those who glory in outraging the best feelings of our nature, there are
some who have even objected to the colour which immemorial usage has established
for the dress of riflemen. They contend that it results from repeated experiments
that, of all colours that could be selected, dark green is the one least suited to skir-
mishers, as being at a certain distance more conspicuous than even red; while
silver or iron grey so completely blends with the colour of surrounding objects at a
few hundred yards' distance as to be almost indistinguishable, and offer no mark to
the enemy. We fully admit all this, but we have yet to learn that the British
Volunteer wishes to conceal himself from his foe. So un-English an idea is worth
of men who advocate vote by Ballot? The Horse Guards have established .
green as the proper dress to be worn by Rifle Corps, and unless disposed to question
the military judgment of the Duke of WELLINGroN and the PRINCE Consort, our
Volunteers will do well to adopt a colour which history has immortalised as the
Horse Guards' Green.”
, “Sir, these are brave and manly sentiments, and will find an echo
in every British breast ! I congratulate the writer, penny-a-liner though
he be, upon taking so conservative and clear-sighted a view of a matter
which civilians are mostly in the dark about. What, Sir! Are our
skirmishers to be afraid to show themselves? Are we Englishmen to
take a mean advantage of invaders, by sneaking behind hedgerows in
inyisible grey clothing, and thence to shoot them down like dogs
without offering, them a chance of their returning us the compliment?
Forbid it, chivalry and courage 1 forbid it, all the laws of fair and
gentlemanly warfare! No, no. Come what danger may § Jove!
we must stick to our colours. Newspapers may call us fooi ardy if
they will, but vulgar taunts will not provoke us to forget what is
“immortalised. The man who shrinks from wearing green wears,
clearly, the white feather, and is unworthy of the name of a British
Rifleman! - -- - --
“I remain, Sir, yours indignantly,
“A WETERAN, BY Jove! SIR! AND NOT A VolunTEER.”
“ Pipeclay Club, Saturday.”
“P.S. My friend SHAREskulle tells me that he thinks I am mis-
taken, and that the (blanked) article I’ve quoted is meant to be
ironical. But this need not prevent your printing my opinions; only
it, shows what (blankblanked) scoundrels all you literary men are,
when you write what you don't mean, and cheat one into fancying that
you really do mean it.”
A TÉTE A TÉTE WITH TAIT.
“Dat veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas.”
ThE All Saints' crows his Lordship pets,
And, hoping against hope, forgets
The º birds that thence have come,
Fled to the rookery of Rome:
Forgets his summary eviction
Of priests from Pimlico; no fiction,
But sternly real: witness PoolE,
Who sloped before his sharp ferule.
Anent which cases, Punch, Confessor,
To the British Public is addresser-
“Can it be right away to fritter,
Consistency for gold and glitter?
Can it be right to consecrate
The new church in Street Margaret,
Which looks more Puseyite by far
Than English churches elsewhere are?
Must then a WESTERTON arise
To clear the case for his Lordship's eyes:
Or Bishop Punch let fall the weight
Of his oak truncheon on TAIT's tele?”
THE PRICES OF SEATS.
A SEAT in the Park costs One Penny.
A Seat for Marylebone costs £6,000.
Really, we would sooner have a seat for the former than the latter.
Once seated, you can sit without fear of any one turning you out;
and instead of a discordant braying-Vestry continually bellowing in
your ears, you have some charming music to listen to. .You have no
parish PUBLIcolas to seduce you with their eloquence, it is true; but
then, to compensate for that loss, you have some of the most beautiful
women in the world to look at, until you regret. that your bosom does
not contain a thousand hearts, that you might give one to each.
In addition to the above advantages, for which, in the language of
the late lamented MR. Richardson, “there is no extra charge,” you
have the satisfaction of knowing that you have in your pocket a com-
forting little balance of £5,999.19s. 11d. We would see the Marylebone
publicans giving body to their porter by committing suicide in their
own vats, and the Kºi... iſ...}. stuck against their own
walls first, sooner than they should have a single penny of it.

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
MR. Punch having accepted office as Purveyor-General of Puns to
the Royal (and every other British) household, presented himself
yesterday to his º constituents, in order to go through the
constitutional formality of being re-elected as their representative.
It being known that Mr. Punch would make a speech on the occasion,
the interest taken in the proceedings was of course intense. Long
before the hour which was appointed for the º all approaches
to the place of nomination were blocked up; and when Mr. Punch's
carriage reached the Convocation House, the only modes of entrance
left him were, by scrambling down the chimney or by taking off the
roof. As the latter operation would have kept the meeting waiting,
Mr. Punch, with that urbanity which always has distinguished him,
consented to submit his sacred person to the former; observing, as he
did so, that few men entered Parliament with cleaner hands than he
did; and that, having swept Loºp DERby out of Downing Street,
there could be no objection to his looking like a Derby º A.
facilis descensus being happily accomplished, Mr. Punch forthwith
exchanged his soot for a Court suit, and, appearing on the plat-
form, was greeted with the most tumultuous applause. When the
cheering had subsided, the Vice-CHANCELLOR proposed Mr. Punch
for º ection in the following highly classical and complimentary
remarks :-
“Adsum, hodiè, Academici, ut suffragiis vestris commendem virum
omnium virorum preclarissime illustrem, cujus quidem magnæ
bonæque qualitates sunt in nostris oribus et auribus familiares ut
suntilla verba qua: “domestica”vocantur (plausus). Sum super mea
cruraut illum vobis nominem, sed nomen tam bene notum nomi-
marem non necesse est. Neque est necesse, neque id foret possibile,
hunc virum apud vos toomuchium laudare. (Mon/ non/) Quis enim
Doctorum ac Academicorum ignorat guantum ille polleat virtute, quam
sit rebus publicis versatus. et privatis, quam sciens (scio equidem)
omnigense doctrinae, quâm literis excellens, quam oratione stunnans,
quam vitae, atque morum integer et purus, quantum denique. Estille
uptosnuffice levatus, et quam bene expertus intempore diei (audite/):
itaut handmente humaná possit concipiullus alius mortalis qui Nos
in senata tam digne representet. (Audite/ audite/). Non vir ordi-
maris has partes potest agere, non homo communis vestris igitur
suffragiis est nunc exornandus; sed Is, cujus ingenium, wittum, et
doctrinam, totus mundus civilisus admiratur et applaudat. Is, quem
invertis Aristotliensibus Terpáywos ºvev Jºyov vocare licet. At quod
est, vermaculariter, Brickus º error!. Eligere hunc hominem
vos jumpere dehetis' (Magnus plausus.) Nemo sedis ipse unquam
potest esse parallela ejus. (Major plausus.) Eum denique prº omni
in omni capiatis, namgue haud ullum ei similens invitā húc videbitis.
(Plausus º Concludo igitur, amici, nominando MAGNUM
PUNCHIUM, virum pissimum et perfacetissimum, pro vobis in AEde
Communium resedere.”
A. º: burst of cheering followed this address; and no rival
appearing, Mr. Punch was re-elected, and addressed the learned
eeting in the following meat speech:-
“Amici, atque Acad-amici. (Mor: Oh! oh!). Solitus ut, sum ad
publicum loquendum, tamen mihi est diabolice difficile invenire verba
meos sensus quae exprimant, Hoc were est proudissimum momentum
mea: vitae. §º Wobis cunctis, Academici, et praesertim meo
ono amico qui jamjam elocutus est, meas optimas et, calidissimas
velim dare gratias, Virtus, ut vos scitis est suirewardus (auditºſ),
Anglia expectat ut quisque homo suum ‘duty” semper faciet. Ego
meum semper feci, memoid potest negare (Mon! non'): et in me
nunc eligendo yos vestrum jam fecistis. . (Plausus.) Brevitas, vos
scitis, anima est Punchii: ergo, Academici, vos non detinebo. (rºr.
Non ad omne /) Dicam igitur “Valete!’ non necesse est ut vobis
adderem nunc “Plaudite!”
At the conclusion of this eloquent and highly, classical address,
Mr. Punch resumed his seat * thunders ºapplause, "tria tem-
pora tria” being called for in his honour, with the usual addition of a
parvum unum in.” Mr. Punch then having quaffed a glass of College
ale, just to take the taste of the dog. Latin from his mouth,jumped
into a special train, which was in waiting, and reached his home in
time to take his Judy to the Haymarket, where he found that the new
play of the Contested Election had attracted, pretty nearly as closely-
crammed an audience, as had Mr. Punch's uncontested election,
whereof he to posterity here hands down the particulars.
VERY APPRoPRIATE–We are informed by the Moniteur, that GENE-
RAI, DE LA HITTE, who has made the new rifle cannon his especialstudy,
is about to join the army of Italy. If a name can carry luck with it,
GENERAL DE LA HITTE is clearly “the right man in the right place.”

THE FOREIGN OFFICE SPELLING-BOOK.
(As LoRD MALMESBURY would have it.)
WE understand that on his taking his departure from the Foreign
Office, LoRD MALMESBURY presented to the clerks, by way of souvenir,
the yery, graceful and º: gift of a new Spelling-book, which
his º had himself been compiling for their use. His Lordship
having lately given vent to the opinion that what is called Orthography
is no test of education, that spelling is at best a most “capricious
science,”, and that the fashions of it alter as often as new bonnets, his
Lordship's Spelling book will be perused with no small interest, as
embodying his somewhat peculiar ideas. Some notion, may be formed
of the scope and style of the great work from the following excerpta
from its concluding pages, which are devoted to a series of questions
to º student, founded on the rules before propounded for his
guidance:— -
“In spelling the word ‘Kollonies’ do you generally begin with a
‘C’ or with a ‘K,' and do you prefer j three l’s, two, or one?
“How is the word “Goverment’ usually spelt now, and in how
many distinct ways can you remember to have seen it spelt P
“What do the three letters “C,” “A,” and ‘T.’ stand for? and can
you suggest any variation in the spelling?
“How does MAvon spell “beleive,” with the e first or the if Which
do yºu prefer yourself, and state your reasons for your preference?
." In what number of wrong ways can you write the phrase, in toetal
vialation of our treatise.’ Mention, if you can, a Foreign Office prece-
dent for the use of each.
“In speaking of an author, would you call him a ‘littery’ or litte:
#. º Which is the best way of spelling the word ‘artikle;’
and which do you write oftenest, nuespaper’ or “noospaper?”
“Do you incline at all to the phonetic way of spelling? If so, and
you write your words as you pronounce them, would you, as a fashion-
able man, write the word ‘orwewy’ with two r s or with three ?
“When you invite a man to dine, with you, do you terminate the
word ‘dinnaw’ with ato, or er? And do you like to put one n or
two n s in the middle * - -
“In the course of your experience in a Foreign Office clerkship, have
you ever come across a Governmental document, in any part of which
you could pick out six words following, spelt as any spelling-book or
dictionary spells them?
“Can you write “a blind pig’ with the use of but two letters? If
not, state your reasons for believing it impracticable.
“How is the word ‘Erthkwake’ written in your office? And do
you recollect ever seeing it spelt “Earthquake?’
“Do you know how DR. JóHNson spells the word ‘orthogggraphy?’
Mention your authorities for using the three g's.
“‘At the cieling of these presence.’ Is this phrase correctly spelt?
and, if you think not, how would you proceed tº alter it? -
“When writing a letter on the third day of the week, do you in
general head the sheet with ‘Twosday,” or with Toosday?', State
which of these you think is most correct, and which word of the two
you, in your own mind, fancy looks best. - - -
“If you were in a hurry, and had to write the word ‘inalienable,”
how would you contrive to render it intelligible? -
“How does WALKER spell the words “shuting,” º and ‘dawg
cart?” and in what way do you yourself prefer to spell them?
“With how many wrong letters could you write the word “kauphy,’
if you gave your mind to it? -
“Does Johnson spell 3. with a 'G' first or a “J”
“‘Obstreperous” or ‘Obstropolous?’. Which of these is commonly
adopted in the Foreign Office, and which do you consider the most
gentlemanly spelling? -
“Did you ever write the word ‘Yatch’ right at the first shot;
and have you never in despair been reduced to write it “yot?’”

[July 9, 1859.
PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CIIARIVARI.
l
A VICTORIA CROSS FOR THE LADIES.
FIRST DISTRIBUTION.
MR. PUNCH has long felt that acts of the most devoted heroism are
perpetually being performed by the ladies, without the slightest recog-
nition from the Lords of Creation. The French have the Cross of the
Legion of Honour, which may be awarded (it is believed) to both
sexes. Whether this be so or not, the priz Monthyon, for acts of exem-
plary virtue, is certainly open to the faſter half of the species. Among
ourselves, the Victoriº Čross has been instituted for the reward of
distinguished ntry, but it is as yet, confined to our soldiers.
Woman “Laudatur et alget.” Let a member of the sweeter sex rise
to heroism even of the sublimest order, her virtue must still be its own
reward. Feeling this wrong deeply, Mr. Punch as chosen champion of
that delicious portion of the creation, of which his Judy is a distin.
guished ornament, has determined to remedy so crying an *; by
the institution—at his own expense—of a Wictoria Cross for tes.
The cross is of gold filagree, and may be worn either suspended by a
ribbon round the neck, like a locket, or as a brooch, or ornament to
the waist-belt. - - - -
It is only bestowed for acts of distinguished heroism performed in
society, where other ladies are present, and where the bataille des dames
is being waged with the usual weapons of the sex; or for acts of unex-
ann ifresistance to temptation. It is open to alſ classes of society.
he first distribution of this new mark of distinction took
Mr. Punch's Office last week, when the Ladies' Victoria
Valour was awarded:—
No.1. To Miss PRIscILLA WARRoys (of Evergreen Lodge, Hol.
loway), for at once avowing herself thirty-seven, in answer to an
invidious question put by Miss CoIDst REAM (who is herself five years
younger), in the presence of four other ladies, three of them unmarried,
and with five gentlemen in the room. -
N.B. Miss WARBoys is so well preserved that she might readily pass
for twenty-nine.
2. To MRs. BLADEBONE. (of. Canonbury, Square, Islington), for
heroic resistance to temptation, in passing along the whole length of
Regent Street and Langham Place, the day after last quarter-day, in
the company of MR. BLADEBONE, without once stopping at a bonnet-
shop, or making any remark on the contents of any of the milliners’,
haberdashers’, drapers', or shawl-merchants’ windows. . BLADE-
Bose, was aware that MR, B. had just received his salary.
3. To MRs. WRENch (of No. 99, Victoria Square, Pimlico), for
receiving, without any exhibition of irritation, or, any attempt at
apology, two gentlemen invited to dinner by her husband without an
#. notice |. invitation having been given after a Greenwic
inner the night before, and MR. W. having unaccountably forgotten
the occurrence), -though there was only hashed mutton for dinner,
and the unexpected guests were driven to eke out their meal with
bread-and-cheese. , Under these most, trying circumstances, MRs.
WRENCH is proved (on the evidence of the maid-servants, and her own
mother-in-law, who resides in the house,) to have been unembarrassed,
lace at
ross of
and even cheerful, though MR. W. has the character of a person who ||
attaches exaggerated importance to what he calls “the duty of
keeping up appearances.” This almost incredible feat of heroism ||
is further confirmed by the º of both the male guests on the
occasion, who are, married men. hey declare they couldn't have
believed it unless they had seen it, and they have given serious offence
at home by repeating the circumstance.
4. To, Miss PepDLEs (of Rutland Gate, Kensington, Gore), for
repeated acts of heroism in covering, by an accompaniment much
louder than was warranted by the composer, the false notes of Miss
BLAIR, an acquaintance and rival, at LADY SchIMGEOUR's matinée
musicale.
5. To BETSY. PRIGGLEsworth (laundress), for repeated acts of
heroism in leaving untouched, for the whole of a long vacation, in
A closet in the chambers of her employer, MR. O'MulligAN, of Gray's
Inn, the remains of sundry bottles of spirits, partially emptied by that
gentleman, and left by him without any protection or safeguard what-
ever. These acts of heroic self-restraint are proved by MR. Q'MULLI.
GAN's own evidence... Arriving suddenly from Ireland, at a late hour
of the night, by the Holyhead train, when all the public-houses in the
neighbourhood were closed, and visiting his closet as a forlorn hope,
he made the welcome but most unexpected discovery of the bottles in
uestion, the temptation of which had been so heroically resisted by
Rs. PRIGGLEsworth.
6. To LADY BLANCHE CASTLETON, eldest daughter of the EARL
of HUNGERDown (of Castleton Manor, Wilts), for her heroism in
resisting the attempts of LADY BITTERStone to press a footstool on
ºr country neighbour, Miss MILLICENT CLodgkusher, (the effect
of whose pretty face is liable to be marred by the shape and dimen-
signs of her feet,) during a morning call, at which several persons
of both sexes were present, and where much attention was being
paid tº Miss C. by the son of the county member.
7. To CoRNELIA, wife of ALGERNoN SIDNEY BuLCHIN (M.P. for
Little, Pedlington), for her heroic presence of mind in immediately
throwing into the fire an invitation to Cambridge, House, intended, no
doubt, to undermine the independence of her husband in the discharge
of his legislative duties. -
8. To EMMA, PLAINWAY, (wife of MR. Joseph PLAINway, head
clerk in H.M. Red Tape and Sealing-wax Department), for her heroism
in always speaking of the gentleman in black, who carries round the
dishes at her dinner-party of the season, as “our green-grocer.”
“THE BITTER CUP.”
WE see something advertised under the above name. We do not know
what it is, nor do we care to know, for “a bitter, cup” possesses but
few recommendations for our lips. It may be a cheerful companion to
“Th9RLEy's MUg,” for anything we know. , Bitterness that arises
out of ºne's ºups is a thing rather to be avoided, we should say. The
man, who is dejected, or in misfortune, is said to drink out of “a bitter
cup,” and, taking hold of it in this, sense, we should think that the
Conservatives have been of late drinking very deeply out of this playful
itcher. We make an honourable exception in favour of DisrAELI,
or he does not want any bitterness. For ourselves, we do not require
anything of the kind, for we always take to our liquor in the kindest
manner. If we have a preference, we would sooner have a Cup of
Bitters to a “Bitter Cup” any day. We should say that the latter
too frequently left an unpleasant taste behind it. Perhaps the “Bitter
Cup” is “the glass too much.” that Paterfamilias, carried away by
his feelings and the gin punch at Richmond, is sometimes apt at this
thirsty time of the year to take overnight. Away, far away from us
any such treacherous, poisºnous Cup! Repºntance lurks at the bºttom
of it! The “Salmon” enters too deeply into its contents, and hence
the “swimming headache” that so frequently arises the next morning
from a person incautiously partaking of that most intemperate of fish.
It is time that the Salmon took the pledge |
Austria's Four-leaved Shamrock.
“AUSTRIA,” says a journal in her interests, “will deal retribution
on the platform of her Quadrilateral.” Nous cerrons. Entire change
of tactics sometimes succeeds, and this is assuredly the very first time
Austria has ever tried to deal on the Square.
A STRIKING FAILURE.
. How can we expect the House of Commons to abandon its night
sittings, and not to sit up, like a parcel of old women, talking so late,
when the very Clock, that is supposed to guide their movements, sets
them the wretched example it does in keeping such very bad hours?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LION AND THE EAGLES.
RED beaks and red talons, wild wheeling, and soaring,
Hot eyes darting hate, twin fierce screams of disdain,
Then a rush to mad grapple, and see, there comes pouring
Torn plumage, in blood, on the beautiful plain!
So fight the fell Eagles, while deep in the forest
There pants in heart-tremble the Dove on her spray;
Yet courage, thou gentle one, all thou abhorrest
Is crippled, self-maimed, in that venomous fray.
Who watches the Eagles: whose calm steady eye on
Their struggle is turned with the glance of a King?
Some live who can speak how the eye of the Lion
Has flamed into fire as he surged for a spring.
Some live not. What savage beside him is lying?
Avenged the pure blood on that savage's claws.
It is not so long since the Tiger lay dying
A prey to the wrath of those terrible jaws.
'Tis whispered, (yet who hath such secret in keeping P)
That when the fell Eagles from conflict shall part,
A stoop may be made upon lambs that are sleeping
In ſolds very dear to the Lion's great heart.
It may be—He knows he has torn down all foemen,
He knows Who has armed him with courage and might,
And (accepting one enemy's corse as an omen)
The Lion of England is watching the fight.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JUNE 30. Thursday. They had all got back safe to their §: (the
Ministers), except MR. GLADSTONE, who was not prevented from run-
ning straight home (as may be supposed) by his seeing three courses
before him, but by the Ultra-Conservatives of Oxford setting up an
opposition to his return. To the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer,
the Christianiser of HoMER, the Allº!: of DEMOSTHENES, was
opposed the Birmingham Railway, in the person of its Chairman,
LoRD CHANDos. But in the end, the silver voice of GLADstoNE pre:
yailed over the railway scream, though a new Evangelical, whistle had
been fitted on expressly for that occasion, to wake up torpid parsons in
the provinces, and the CHANCELLOR triumphed by 1050 Oxonians to
859 High-lows. -
In the Lords, the EARL of GRANVILLE, who did not make a
Ministry, explained how exceedingly glad he was that the business had
been taken into stronger hands,--a gladness which the nation is happy
to share with him. LoRD MALMESBURY defended his conduct as
Foreign Minister, declared that he had done all in hisP. to prevent
the war, and insisted that in his despatches he had abused Austria
quite as much as he had scolded the Allies. The ColoniaL SECRE-
TARY stated that he did not know whether MR. CoRDEN, just then
returning from America, would take the office kept open for him by
LoRD PALMERSTON; but if the said RICHARD did join, he would per-
fectly understand that no Quakerly nonsense came into the QUEEN’s
Councils with him, but that he associated himself with a Ministry that
was going not only not to diminish the national defences, but largely
to increase them. History might be an old almanack, but the histor
of the Victorian Age should not be Poor Richard's Almanack. It hat
since been signified that MR. CoRDEN will not join, for the which
Mr. Punch may have something to say to him. It is to be hoped that
MR. C. was not afraid of the Swells with whom he would have had to
be connected. . Mr. Punch can assure him that the real swell is highly
affable; and it is only smart stock-jobbers and Manchester millionnaires
and Qther stuck-huppers, that would have objected to his Unadorne
toilet, his probable ignorance of the biography of our º
and his inability to pass an examination in club-window scandal.
There was not much else to mark, the opening night, except that
#. promised Neutrality, and Opposition promised avoidance of
action.
LoRD PALMERSTON made his first speech as Premier, and expressed
his intense satisfaction at being joined once more in government by
his affectionate friend, John Russell. He announced that there was
to be no Reform Bill this Session, as the estimates, budget, and other
matters would last till the grouse-days, after which, of course, it
would be unreasonable to expect gentlemen to stay in town to consider
what votes could be given to mechanics. He hinted, however, that
another Session might be necessary this year, but solemnly promised a
*--- - - - - - - - - -
Reform Bill as soon as possible. As regarded Foreign policy, it was
rather amusing to notice, that the Ministers who have j". got off the
roundabout took glory to themselves for having acted exactly as the
newly-mounted parties had advised; while the latter rested their claim
to confidence on their pledge to follow exactly in the course chalked
out for them by their predecessors.
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER assailed the Government at once for a decla-
ration that the country should be well defended,—but did not get it.
MR. WHITESIDE introduced a plan, for some law reform, of a con-
solidatory character, but was told by the ATToRNEY.GENERAL that
though the idea was meritorious as far as it went, it did not go far
enough, and that the subject was in better hands.
Friday. LoRD CHANCELLOR CAMPBELL has appointed MR. BLAck-
BURN, barrister, the new Judge, rice ERLE, promoted. The Bar don't
like an unknown man to be exalted; but the public, considering that
the less you know of a lawyer the more likely you are to respect him,
does not share this feeling; and Lords LYNDHURST, CRAN worth,
WENSLEYDALE, and CAMPBELL, all testified to-night to MR. JUSTICE
BLACKBURN's learning, ability, sound law, virtue, and all the rest of
the qualities appertaining to the English judge. LoRD LYNDHURST
took the opportunity of poking a Shakspearian compliment to LoRD
CAMPBELL on his attaining his new honours, and politely cited the pas-
sage in which Macduff remarks upon Macbeth's having it all now. Since
the horrible disclosures which are now startling the world upon the
subject of Shakspearian emendations, one is afraid to quote the divine
WILLIAMs; but Mr. Punch would like to know in what edition Lord
LYNDHURST's citation, calls, the Macbeth witches “sisters.” They
were so no doubt, and the family must have been a pleasant one, and
brought up in a way that does honour to Scotch education.
LoRD RIPON announced that the Government meant to do a good
deal for the Rifle Corps, but had an objection to their shooting the
public generally while practising. LoRD, HowDEN, who has º
nearly all his life on the Continent, asserted that .# Frenchman and
woman would exult in France's being able to humiliate England by
invasion. Everybody concurred in the desirability of promoting the
Rifle movement, without offensive reference to what might be the
ultimate Target. LoRD BROUGHAM dilated eloquently on the necessity
of our having a splendid, Navy, and the Duke of SoMERSET, who
would not take the trouble to make himself heard, mumbled out a
brief speech to the effect that everything would be done properly. If
this is a specimen of the way SoMERSEt is going to win the affections
and confidence of the country, Mr. Punch may have occasion to invite
his friend LoRD PALMERSTON to reconsider ministerial arrangements.
Some miscellaneous and mainly, but not º unprofitable talk in
the Commons. It came out that the Board of Works (ThwAITEs's)
have actually commenced the “intercepting scheme.” for the Metro-
politan Sewage; and that we are to have a Bill for facilitating the
getting on with the Divorces, for which there is so large a demand.
And now for the Estimates. ..
For the better understanding of the Debates, ladies, Mr. Punch
would mention to you that Mr. BRAND is the new Whip, instead of
HAYTER, deservedly whitebaited by his friends this week, and MR.
MASSEY is the new Chairman of Committees instead of MR. FitzRoy,
who is Minister for minding the chairs in the Park, and had better do
it, too. Chairman of Committees doesn't mean Speaker of the House,
and it may be equally desirable to inform the British female that LoRD
CIIANCELLOR does not mean CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, and
that, the Master of the Rolls is not the husband of the Mistress of

ast table.
CLASSICAL BUTTER.
ANY reader who is .# enough to read ; Latin may get a
quiet laugh from the report of the proceedings which took place at the
Oxford University Election. The speech, which was delivered in pro-
posing MR. GLADSToxE, is given by the Times reporter at full length,
and will repay perusal much better than most speeches. Qne advan.
tage of the custom of spouting in dog Latin is, that it enables one to
say the greatest nonsense, without one's being thought to be at all
absurd in saying it. Moreover, one need never fear to lay one's kvěos
on too thick, when one spreads it under cover of a classic phraseology.
If wrapped in a dead language praises the most fulsome may #.
swallowed without sickening. MR. GLADSTONE, as all know, is the
modestest of men, still he neither winced nor flushed at the Dean's
#. in proposing him. Yet it was bristling with compliments as
thickly as a sponge-cake porcupine with sweetmeats. Every other
word was a laudatory adjective. “Wirum doctissimum, dignissimum,
diligentissimum,”—not a sentence but contained half a dozen of these
“issimums.” Well, of course all this was strictly in accordance with
oldſº.; and of course, too, whatever a Dean says must be right.
Still, we doubt if doubtful Latin be a credit to our colleges: and we
think that, at all future University Elections, better taste and better
scholarship might certainly be shown, if the speeches were to smack
more of the Study than the Buttery.

HAPPY REMOVALS.
WE ºf to congratulate the public on two happy removals that have
got out of the way with the greatest possible grace and the smallest
possible noise. The first of these removals is the Richmond Bridge
Turnpike. It is very strange, the road to Hampton Court looks, as
clear again without it; and not only that, but the beautiful F. Ill
front appears now twice as open. The second removal, is of that large
block of melancholy buildings, that did duty as cavalry barracks near
the Kensington Gate, on the Hammersmith Road. They are all swept
away now, and the bricks that contributed to its ugliness may have
helped to lay down the new pavement in Regent Street, for what we
now: Why the same improving besom did not also sweep away the
abominable gate that is by the side of it, is a mystery to us. High-
waymen are extinct, but turnpikes still hold their ground. A Turnpike
ate is a licensed Digk TURFIN, for he allows no traveller to pass along
his road without º upon him to “stand and deliver.” It is time
that the highway was cleared of these insatiable robbers, that infest the
neighbourhood of London in the same plundering degree as the banditti
do the vicinity of Rome. We want some spirited REBEcqA who, on
the legal side of the hedge, could knock on the head this hydra skulled
monopoly, whose defiant motto too long has been —“Non Tol(l)imé
Tangere.” In the meantime, the Richmond Turnpike has set a graceful
example by quietly walking itself off. We will not attempt to follow
it, but § only indulge in the passing wish that the other Turnpikes
round the Metropolis would endeavour to imitate its elastic gait !

THE POPE AND THE PERUGIANS.
THE inhabitants of some of the Papal States having, immediately
on the departure of the gentle Austrian troops, revolted against
the mild rule of the Sover EIGN PONTIFF, a note for the informa-
tion of Foreign Courts was drawn up by the Cardinal Secretary
of State, at the command of the Holy Father, as a preliminary to the
reduction of his refractory subjects under subjection to the beneficent
and blessed 'yoke of the Popedom. From this manifesto of infallible
wisdom and º the subjoined is an extract. Having set forth
that the people of Bologna had uttered seditious cries; had risen,
some of them, in arms; had displayed tricoloured flags and cockades;
had assembled in crowds before §. Legate's palace, taken down the
ontifical arms, and told the Cardinal Legate that they had constituted
ICTOR EMMANUEL Dictator, and that the example of Bologna had
!. followed by Ravenna and Perugia, the papal document declares
at—
“Such events taking place under the eyes and to the horror of all, cannot but
fill with bitterness the paternal mind of his Holiness, who has seen with what
fraudulent and malignant arts it has been, and still is, tried to detach from his
legitimate authority and º: some provinces which have been primary
objects of his most anxious love and beneficence.”
In the bitterness which filled his paternal mind, the Pope formed a
resolution, which is intimated in the conclusion of his note:–
“His Holiness finally reserves to himself to proceed to the acts necessary to
maintain intact, by all the means with which Providence has entrusted him, the
sacred and inviolable rights of the Holy See."
So the regiment called Swiss, to the honour and glory of Switzer.
land, which fights for the viceroy of the monarch whose kingdom is not
of this world, stormed Perugia on the 20th instant, “slaying,” writes
a person, from Rome, “burning, and plundering, as if in an enemy's
country.” According to the same authority, “the soldiers broke into
the houses whence they had been fired upon, and committed the most
dreadful excesses.” For example:–
“Nine women and children were victims to the ruthless soldiers in different
houses, and the cruelties of war were aggravated by the horrors of licentiousness.”
Such were the acts necessary to maintain intact the sacred and
inviolable rights of the Holy See. The rights of the Holy See are
inviolable under all circumstances: some other sanctities are not, as
is proved by the sack of Perugia. That event also proves that the
paternal mind had been filled with bitterness to overflowing. So much
the worse for the women and children. The loyal Roman Catholics of
England will not fail to contrast the conduct of the Papal troops, in
merely massacring and 'outraging ladies and babies, whose husbands
and fathers had rebelled against the Vicar of Heaven, with the ruthless
slaughter and execution by British soldiers of our poor Sepoys, whose
only crime was revolt against a power which is the great champion and
"Wºº of heretical depravity. -
hem we consider the justice and mercy which—with an excess of
the latter—characterise the temporal government of the PQPE, and
reflect that it derives these celestial qualities from that which consti-
tutes the Holy Father's holiness; and when we further perpend the
fact that the glorious war now raging in Italy,–in which we may have
the pleasure of being involved, and to which we shall be indebted for a
delightful increase of taxation,--is owing to the attempt of Austria to
support a good system of government, inspired by the Holy Roman
Hierarchy, and particularly the Jesuits, we see clearly what ignorant,
uneducated, vulgar ninnies and noodles are all the opponents of
Popery, and what wise and strong-minded men are those politicians
who contemptuously but carefully affect to denominate them “old
women.”
An After Thought.
THERE is a tradesman in Manchester, where they do know what
rain is, who has brought out a “METTERNICH UMBRELLA.”. Round the
covering, which is of watered silk, there is engraved the diplomatist's
falsified saying of “Après moi, le Déluge.” It is described as the
safest thing going for keeping the wet out. -
Mist AKEN EconoMY.—It is folly, my Lords of the Admiralty, to
ruin the British Fleet for the sake of a ha'porth of tar.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CIIARIVARI.
[July 9, 1859.
--
A CHAPTER ON SLANG.
ow debased is that tongue, once
our glory andP;
By a torrent of Slang how re-
morselessly dyed; -
As this Punch has observed with
a patriot's pang, -
He devotes to his country this
Chapter on Slang.
To its champions and friends,
from the small to the big,
From my LoRD BoBBY CAUDLE
to little BILL PRIGG:
Punch addresses these lines, and
he hopes they’ll amend,
When he holds up to laughter
“our dashing young friend.”
Our dashing young friend of to-
day never tells
The hotel he | up at, or
house where he dwells,
Of his Diggins perchance we’ll
hear something about,
Or his Crib, or Concern, Sir, or
where he Hangs out.
Our friend has no pocket, he
... may have a Fob,
Though it holds not a shilling, it may hold a Bob;
It has not a º: or any coln in, -
Though it may have a Tizzy, a Bender, or Tin.
Qur friend of to-day has no watch to his name,
'Tis a Ticker, or Turnip; if wrong, it goes Lame:
What the hour is he knows not, though able to say
How the Enemy goes, or what 's His time of day.
Our friend knows of nothing that’s strange, it is Rum;
His is not a companion, he’s always a Chum; -
Though his Chum is not staunch, yet he may be a Brick,
And though young men are fast, d things else so are Slick.
Our friend knows of nothing a plague, it’s a Baw
Though he drinks brandy Neat, he has ne'er had it raw;
His father’s no father, but out of a &:
He’s the Guv'ner, Öld Buffer, Old Cock, or Old Bloke.
Our friend of to-day has no coat, it’s a Tog,
And he ne'er dresses well, though he Goes the whole hog,
He is then just the Cheddar, the Cut, Cheese, or Style,
Though his head bears a Bollinger, Beaver, or Tile.
Our friend prone to vices you never may see,
Though he goes on the Loose, or the Cut, or the Spree,
For brutally drunk, he's as Screwed as old Nick, -
And you’ll find him next morning, though Seedy not sick.
Qur friend of to-day sees a Kid, not a child,
And he never gets steady, he Draws the thing mild;
A jest should be Knocked off Cheesed, Shut up, or Stashed,
And a man's broken nose, is his Claret-jug squashed.
Our friend never suffers a fraud or a cheat,
He is Gammon'd, or Sold, or Let into it sweet;
He never retreats, º he Mizzles it quick, ..
Or he Slopes, Bolts, or Hooks it, or else Cuts his stick.
Our friend of to-day is not calm, he is Cool,
And a man who's not wise, must be Soft, or a Fool;
For a scolding, he always Čomes in for a wigging,
A Rowing, a Jawing, a Lipping, or Rigging.
Mr. Punch thinks it high time his Shop to shut up,
He commends these remarks to each Darling young pup,
Who in slang words deals largely, and thinks it Dem rare,
Like our snobs, nobs, and footpads, to slang, and to swear.
A Sting in a Title.
By way of reprimand, the sarcastic nature of which we do not
exactly understand, Count Gyulai is to be created for his misdeeds,
“The Ban of Croatia.” . If the desire was to stigmatise the Count,
.# not have alled him in plain language at once, instead of the Ban
of Croatia, “The Bane of Austria?”
ONE MORE BOMBA.
Le Roi Bomba est mort; ripe le Roi Bomba / Such might well be
the exclamation of Neapolitan loyalty. The Naples Correspondent of
the Morning Post writes word that—
“The new King of the Two Sicilies inaugurates his Government by continuing
the system of the late King. Arrests are every day made in order to intimidate
and prevent any public manifestation of sympathy for the war of Italian inde-
}. To form part of any demonstration; to raise a hat when the new
edmontese Envoy passes; to talk of the victories of the allied armies; to wear in
the button-hole a pink, white and red, which with the green stalk would together
form the tricolor, and a thousand other futile causes, is sufficient to cause the
offender to be thrown into a dungeon."
Thus, “AMHRATH an AMURATH, succeeds, and BoMBA BoMBA,” to
take a slight liberty with the mighty line of SHAKSPEARE. The son
takes after the father, with the addition of being apparently somewhat
deranged. Rampant and outrageous insolence, ridiculous in its extra-
vagance, on the part of a flunkey, is generally servile imitation. Like
master like man. According to the authority already quoted:—
“The prefect of the police insults the prisoners by telling them that the liberators
of Italy, Victor EMMANUEL, and Louis NApolfoN, will soon come and release them
from their cells."
This functionary might be º to have taken, the historical
character of our Jupg|E JEFFERIEs for his model, were there not reason
for supposing that the madness of mockery above instanced had been
copied from the contemporary pattern of his own king. BoMBA THE
SEcond, if the subjoined statement—from the same source as the
foregoing—is true, must be as mad as any dog in these dog-days.
“FILANGIERI and other generals have visited the forts of the city, and prepared
a plan of defence for the kingdom ; and from remarks which dropped from one of
the Generals, it appears that the King has it in contemplation to attack the French
troops at Rome, and put down the insurrection in the Romagna. This surmise is
confirmed by the departure of nine battalions of troops commanded by GENERAL DE
BENEDICTIs. The ambulances have been ordered, as well as the military chest.”
The strait-waistcoat ought to be ordered, and the cold douche, for
the KING or NAPLEs. Perhaps, however, not the cold douche. The
madness of his Majesty may be so thoroughly canine that it would be
only aggravated, by that remedy. The French troops at Rome, are
sleeping dogs, which any small puppy but a very rabid one would be
only too glad to let lie. If young BoMBA really does entertain the
design of attacking them, he must be in a desperate state of hydro-
phobia. It is to be hoped that he has no counsellor wise enough to try
to dissuade him from attempting that frantic enterprise, and possessed
of influence enough over him to induce him to abandon. it. , Happy
will it be for his subjects if he is invincibly bent, on courting his own
political destruction, and getting the Bourbon dynasty improved from
off the face of the earth.
A MELANCHOLY WIEW OF MARRIAGE.
HAVING mentioned that the Bishop of GIBRALTAR, the other day,
held a confirmation in the chapel of the British Embassy at Constan-
tinople, the correspondent of the Post at that city says:–
“On the same day Sir HENRY AND LADY Bulwen were present at the marriage
of PRINos. JEAN CARAFA, and Mr. LL.B. CARoline Duka ND. His Excellency addressed
a few words of encouragement and advice to the young married couple after the
ceremony.”
Very kind, and as far as advice went, useful, no doubt, was the
discourse which SIR HENRY BULwer was good enough to address to
the youthful, pair. They may have profited by the advice of an
experienced diplomatist, but in what way could they have required his
encouragement * Are we to regard them as a poor young Prince and
Princess, beginning the world with º to depend upon but their
own exertions, and with the Fº of a large family, whose cradles
the Prince will have, in the first three or four instances at least, to
rock P Did the Princess want to be inspired with hope in the prospect
of keeping a mangle, and the Prince to be persuaded to take a cheerful
view of having to turn it? The difficulty of making both ends, meet
is one which a newly-married bride and bridegroom uniting youth and
inexperience with slender means, may be materially helped to surmount
by a little cheering exhortation, but there cannot well be conceived
any other which they are likely to encounter, and not likely to get over
perfectly well without anybody's encouragement. Perhaps, however,
the immense amount of justice which has to be administered by the
Probate and Divorce Court has suggested a view of matrimony so
gloomy as to constitute for a young couple just married a need to be
emboldened to expect domestic happiness.
On the Advertising Pillar at Hyde Park Corner.
THough, to those whose profession’s to advertise stuſ,
It's useful for drawing the tanners,
Good taste must object to a permanent puff,
And call it a piece of bad “Manners.”

“My worst fears are realised l’”—husbands obtain
A happy release from a foul marriage chain,

The wicked Divorce Act is bearing these fruits.

To the snobbish hoi polloi, the mercantile throng,

Thank Goodness! the husband in humblest low life
Must still remain link'd to an infamous wife;
And the wife a fast knot to the savage wretch ties,
Who beats her, and kicks her, and blackens her eyes.
Divorce for the million continues too dear,
'Tis, happily, out of the labourer's sphere;
But soon will its price to their means be brought down,

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
... Monday, July 4. The House of Lords received, for the first time, the
illustrious WERNoN SMIJTh, who has cast his SMITH and now flutters
as the gilded and gaudy LyyEDEN. And a more useful addition was
made to it in the person of the late SIR BENJAMIN HALL, now Lord
LLANovER, which does not rhyme to Hanover but to Dover.
The House of Commons was menaced by M.R. Edwin JAMEs with a
speech on behalf of MR. Chisholy ANSTEY, on a given date. The
subject is too terrible for jesting. LoRD PALMERston repeated that
he could bring in no Reform Bill in the present session. . It must be a
severe trial to this zealous reformer to restrain his natural eagerness to
enlarge the franchise and to realise MR. TENNyson's ideal of a
Cabinet:—
“And statesmen at Her council met
Who knew the seasons when to take
Occasion by the hand, and make
The bounds of freedom wider yet
“By shaping some august decree
Which kept Her throne unshaken still,
Broad based upon Her people's will,
And compassed by the inviolate sea.”
Tuesday, Lord Lyndhurst came out with a spirited speech, in
which he declared that, speaking only from a Defensive point of view
We ought to have ships .# to smash the navies of France an
Russia; another fleet to hold the Mediterranean; another to protect
the West Indies; and another to see after Ireland, in case the
Liberators of mankind should look upon the Irish as an oppressed
nationality: We ought, he thought, to enlarge all our arsenals and
garrison all our fortresses; and then, he conceived we might smile with
much affability upon the world generally. Expense was nothing, and

cheers from Mr. Punch. LoRD STRAtford DE REDCLIFFE, who knows
more about foreign politics and foreign feelings than any nobleman in
the world,—with the single exception, of course, of LorD PUNCH DE
FLEEtstreet, also thought that England ought not to live upon
sufferance. Lord GRANville, for the Government, did not think it
likely that France, engaged in war (GRANNY's ideas were charmingly
illustrated by the news of Friday), would attack us, and as for
Russia, she was engaged only in improving the condition of her subjects.
Happily, the practical part of his speech atoned for his ridiculous
balderdash, or ; this time MASTER GRANVILLE would have been kicked
out of office by Mr. Punch. He stated that we were arming as fast as
we could. Lond HARDwicke justly remarked that it was too late to arm
when you were knocked down. The DUKE of SoMERset made an exces-
sively foolish and petulant speech, and but that Lord PALMERston
has ordered this person to improve the Navy in ."g way, and that

GRANville for his drawing-room twaddle. ElephantHoRough did
not believe in moral influence unless º: by º force. The
Duke of ARGYLE was, if possible, silfier than the other duke, but
he will look particularly queer if a regiment of Zouaves should quarter
themselves in the big hall in Sutherland House, make targets of the
statues, and poke holes in that charming picture of her Grace and the
baby in the dining-room. The Duke of Rutland, taking title from
a little county, made a little speech, but it was to the purpose. Mr. Punch
entirely approves of the conduct of the Lords who recommended earnest
attention to our national defences, and it is not the sneers of any organ
of unwashed and spiteful refugees that will induce the people to think

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 16, 1859.
that the English Peers went out of their way in demanding protection
for the English soil. In this sense Mr. Punch is a most bigoted
Protectionist, and would impose the largest amount of duty upon those
whose business it is to be our watchmen.
Various matters were talked over in the Commons. MR. GREGORY
brought up the case of MR. RYLAND, who seems to have been done out
of an office he held in Canada, some years back. He appears to have
been treated with remarkable injustice. , Mr. Punch, who has scarcely
time to do more than save the country about four times a week, has not
read the documents, but is perfectly satisfied to rest upon the opinion
of MR. WELSBY, one of the ablest and most right-minded members
of the bar, who has pronounced strongly for MR. RYLAND, Mr. P.
therefore endorses the petition—“Let right be done,” and though the
House did not care to be bored with a mere matter of honour and
justice, it will be wiry times for some folks if Mr. Punch is again riled
in behalf of RYLAND. M.R. Collier brought in a Bill limiting the
ower of the county court judges, to send folks to quod. At present,
if a dirty messenger puts a dirty piece of paper into your hand in the
street, and you, thinking it is an advertisement of DR DIRT's museum,
or something cognate, throw it away and forget all about it, you are
soon afterwards hauled to prison for forty days, on the charge of having
manifested for the county court the contempt you felt for the quack.
A good Rifle debate was followed by the defeat of an attempt by MR.
Alcock to do away with turnpike tolls, and a Bill was introduced to
t rid of the restriction, which prevents a Papist from being Lord
hancellor of Ireland. There will be what is inelegantly designated a
Howling Shindy about this Bill before it is done with.
Wednesday. The sitting was º in discussing a Bill of MR.
I)ILLwyn's on Endowed Schools. When these establishments were
founded, there was no specific exclusion of Dissenters from their
management, because just then the Dissenter was an uncreated animal,
or, if a specimen of anything approaching the nature of such a creature
lurked about, and read his Bible in ignoble holes, the haughty founders
of schools would have thought it about as necessary to exclude him, as
Mr. Punch, making his will, would deem it needful to provide that no
Gorilla shall be his executor. Things have slightly altered, and the
Dissenters think that they may now be permitted to share in the
advantage of these endowments. It is an audacious prayer; and after

THE MYSTERY OF A LADY'S DRESS.
FROM Le Follet of this month, we have the pleasure of learning that
“the robes are generally made with five or seven flounces, the top one
not reaching higher than the knee.” This is extremely moderate, and
husbands, with incomes under £300 a year, will be delighted to learn
that the number is so limited. For ourselves, we think “seven
flounces” positively absurd, and you might as well have none at
if they are not to go any higher than the knee. We had hoped to
see a lady who was all flounces—a regular muslin La Scala, tier upon
tier of flounces rising right up to the proscenium. The time was,
when you could not distinguish the dress from the profusion of the
trimmings. If they keep falling off in this way, we shall soon be able
to see what the pattern of a lady's dress is like.
Further on, Le Follet tells us confidentially that “it prefers a skirt
completely bouillonnée, notwithstanding the inconvenience of its
holding the dust.” We do not know what bouillonnée exactly means.
We are perfectly aware that bouillon means broth, but still it is a mys-
tery to us how any one can prefer a skirt that is bouillonnéed all over,
for we have noticed ladies, who at dinner have had a little soup spilt
over their dress, look as though they did not altogether like it; nor
can we see how “broth” and “dust” would go very well together.
Supposing they do, the recommendation of this new fashion seems to
be º it enables every Lady to be Her own Dust Carrier. The
º: ought to be very much obliged to them. -
With regard to bonnets, we are informed that “thin bonnets are
usually made with double curtains.” Why not have your bonnet, like
an old four-post bedstead, with curtains all round it? It would be
much cooler, though we have a difficulty in seeing what great use there
is in having a bonnet at all, when you have a couple of curtains to hide
it! We cannot help staring, also, at the notion of a “thin bonnet.”
The thinness may be in consequence of the weather. The heat is so
intense, that we can almost imagine a “chip” getting thin. .
In the way of trimmings, we are told “a novel an º: effect”
is produced by having “bunches of red currants falling round the
front of the bonnet.” We should be afraid, if the currants were imitated
with the deceptive reality of Zeuxis' fruit, that the birds would come
and peck at them. The ladies have carried flowers and fruit on their
heads; vegetables will soon follow. The Covent Garden basket-
carriers will be getting jealous of the competition.

PORTRAIT OF A DIABOLICAL ENGI,ISHMAN.
CoRREspond ENT of the
Siècle makes the following
statement, which is pro-
bably a hoax:—
“One of the best shots in GA-
RIBALDI's service is an English-
man of 50 years old, who carries
a capital caster rifle, and,
aided by a pair of spectacles, of
which he stands in need, brings
down every Tyrolean chasseur
that he takes aim at. Some-
body lately asked him whether
he #. been attracted to join
the Italian volunteer co by a
strong feeling for the Italian
cause or a love of sport? He
answered very coolly, ‘I have a
great respect for Italian inde-
pendence, but I am also very
fond of shooting.'"
This story is almost in-
credible, because it is un-
likely that an army of
brave men, fighting for
their country's liberty

no soldiers of any corps but a regiment of Thu -
no such Englishman in GARIBALDI's service, with GARIBALDI's know-
ledge; or GARIBALDI is not the man we take him for... If his
troops do contain any such Englishman, that disgrace to England has
probably fled the realm, in consequence of having committed the
murder of the man whose remains were found on Waterloo Bridge, or
some other undiscovered act of like atrocity. If the correspondent o
the Siècle has not, in the tale above quoted, fabricated a bad joke at
the expense of Englishmen, he should publish the name of our infamous
countryman who shoots Tyrolean chasseurs ºil. because he is
very fond of shooting. To the villain's name should be added a
description of his person, like that of a felon advertised in the Hue and
Cry. Because he may be taken prisoner; and, if he is, it is to be
hoped that he will be hanged, as every £nglishman deserves to be who
goes fighting from any other motive whatever than that of patriotism
and the sense of duty which he feels as a Briton.

COLOURING EXTRAORDINARY.
TheRE is no accounting for tastes as to female beauty, and MAUYE
is so much the rage, that we are hardly surprised to learn from the
following advertisement in the Times of last Wednesday, that some of
our fair friends have devised means of transferring the fashionable
colour from their clothes to their complexions:–
FQUNP, on the 30th ult., a handsome LADY's PARASOL, left there
by two ladies, of mauve cºlour, lined inside with white, which may be had at
ARTHUR GRANGER's Stationery Warehouse, 308, High Holborn, W.C.
At the same time we should be rather inclined to consider that “two
ladies, of mauve colour, lined inside with white,” deserve to be classed
as at once “plain and coloured,” ins of “handsome,” as in the
polite language of the advertisement.
Toujours àpropos de Bottes.
THE French have rushed to the rescue of Italy to saye, what is
familiarly called, the Boot, from the iron heel of Austria—but for the
Italians to expect that a separate kingdom will ever be patched up out
of the disjointed bits is, we are afraid, in the hands of the French, a
hope that is quite bootless.

COMMON SENSE IN “SOCIETY.”
The “Fashionable Arrangements” for last
week, in Fashion's own journal, included the
following truly sensible announcement:-
“Lady LLANoven's afternoon and dancing party—from

In the first place, LADY LLANover unaffect
edly, calls her, entertainment a dancing, party,
naming, it in plain English, and eschewing the
snobbish Gallicism by which the like assemblies
are usually denominated. In the next, her dancin
party begins at the suitable hour of four, and en
mencing at the late hour of nine at night and ter-
minating at the preposterous hour of three in the
morning. Her guests have four hours' dancing,
which is enough for all purposes, amongst
others, for that of acquiring an appetite by exer-
cise, and thus they are enabled to enjoy a good
late dinner, which is, in fact, an early supper, at
| home; and after that the male portion of them
have sufficient, and not too much, time to sit over
their wine, and smoke their tobacco. Both the
matter and manner of the above notification indi
cate that a great benefit has been conferred on the
superior classes by the elevation ºf SIR BENJAMIN
HALL to the Peerage. , Sanitary hours of dancing
will, it may be hoped, be rendered fashionable by
the example of LADY LLANover, whilst the same
influence will also induce the wholesome moral
usage of employing the English language for the
expression of the high jinks, festivities, and other
practices and peculiarities of the uppercrust of
society, which are now, from imbecile and mis-
taken ideas of delicacy and refinement, generally
expressed in French phraseology, so as to gloss
them over, as it were, with a sort of polish, w ich

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PREY FOR THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER.
N the sentimental and ro-
mantic department, or second
column, of the Times, the
other day, there *:
the following pretty kind of
notice:—
“M. H. B. P. has written again
to FRED.”
“Has she?” will have
been the * question
of many a lady whose hus-
and is the namesake of
MR. CARLYLE's Prussian
hero. “Again has she—writ-
ten to FRED P” How often
before? And to think of her
not only owning it, but pub:
lishing it in the newspaper!
Oh the impudent creature!
—and as for FRED, I have
Ino patience with him.
FRED is likely to have a
fine time of it for some years,
in consequence of the above
advertisement. Under the
name of FRED are to be
included a very considerable
number of married men so named. Of course it would be the same if
the name were ToM or BILL. “Have you had another letter from
M. H. B. P. f. I dare say M. H. B. P. is all that you could wish. If
M. H. B. P. had made the tea, it would not have been so bad, perhaps.
You had better go and talk to M. H. B. P.” Such are the taunts
and reproaches which thousands of unhappy husbands will now, on
the occasion of every little matrimonial squabble, be subjected to,
through the indiscretion of the authoress of the above advertisement,
by the publication whereof , she will have destroyed the domestic
happiness, or at least disturbed the peace, of an indefinite number of
private families.
A MOTHER-IN-LAW ON NEUTRALITY.
“Of course, my dear, I go in for the non-interference principle. It
would be affectation, worse than affectation on my part, if I pretended
to say that my sympathy was not all upon one side. It is but natural
that it should, and I believe if anything was to happen to my dear
child—who, though I say it, is the sweetest child in the world—that I
should go mad, or out of town, or get thin, or do something desperate,
such as would probably pull me into a premature consumption, or the
hospital, or the workhouse, or, it may be, my grave! As I have said
before, neutrality is my creed. I look on, and, whatever I may think
do not say a word. It’s very painful, but I do it... I have not lived aii
my life, dear, without knowing what man and wiſe are. I know that
they will disagree occasionally—that they will fall out every now and
then, and have their little fights. Let them fight on, I say, and fight
it out asbest they may. They must make it up at last. There never
was a quarrel so long, but there came an end to it at some time or
other. People can't always be º A perpetual cat-and-dog
ife would war out the best cat and the best dog in the world after a
couple of months. So, my dear, I make it a rule to remain neutral-
but then it’s a kind of ‘armed neutrality.’ They know my strength,
and when they have had enough of fighting, they always come to me
to make peace for them. Then, and not till then, do I interfere. You
must know if I don't make war myself, that I hold in my hands what
is called the “sinews of war.” All the money is mine. I haven't
parted with that power yet, and it is extraordinary what a long way
advice will go, when bac ed up with a little money. Then, when bot
sides are worn out, and tired, and exhausted with fighting, and when their
consciences tell them what precious fools they have been for trying to
injure one another, I come in and interfere, and my previous neutrality
makes my interference all the more valuable. The consequence is,
what with my purse, and what with my advice-for I generally find
that the foolish dears need pecuniary assistance }. as much as moral
aid, and very frequently, more so—that I can almost do what I like;
and I need not tell you that I always succeed in making the best terms
I can for my poor daughter, Peace is once, more restored, and cele.
brated afterwards with a dinner at Richmond, or a trip to the sea-side.
That is, dear, what I call “an armed neutrality,” and all mother-in-
laws, if they were wise, would go in and do the same. Interference,
to be effective, should occur very seldom. "That mother-in-law is
strongest who interferes the least—more especially if she has both
reason and money on her side.”
POLITICIANS IN STATU PUPILLARI.
At the annual commemoration at Oxford, the young gentlemen of
that University, whilst waiting for the commencement of business in
the Sheldonian Theatre, are accustomed, as is well known, to amuse
themselves, and the company with an expression of their political
feelings. This is a very useful custom, for the applause and disappro-
bation of the Qxford Undergraduates form a sure and certain criterion
of the right side in politics and the wrong. Qn the occasion, in ques-
tion, last week, for instance, after a manifestation of feeling, which was
not political,—namely, loyalty, which they of course evinced by cheering
the QUEEN and the Royal Family,–they made a series of demonstrations
as conclusive, after a fashion, as so many votes of the House of Com-
In OilS.
A report of the event in progress having recorded their glorification
of British monarchy, says:—
“It was not so, however, with respect to France, for the call of three groans for
the EMPEROR was implicitly obeyed.’
Thus the Undergraduates of Oxford appear to be of opinion that the
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH is wrong in taking part with Sardinia in
antagonism to Austrian domination in Italy. This appears the more
probable from what ensues:–
“Then followed a round of cheers for Lord DERby that shook the very buildin
for a time, and, by way of contrast, Lord PALM ERston drew down a succession o
hisses and groans, but comparatively mild to hosa which greeted the name of
Lord John Russell.”
The late PREMIER is supposed to have aleaning in favour of Austrian
sway in Italy; the present PRIME MINISTER and Home SECRETARY
are known to be solicitous for Italian liberty. Oxford's Undergraduates
proclaim their sympathy with the reputed friends of Austria and
Austrian despotism, and their antipathy for the statesmen who desire
the liberation of Italy.
It is further the opinion of the Undergraduates of Oxford, that LoRD
DERBY, who is chiefly celebrated for unsuccessfully opposing the repeal
of the Čorn Laws, deserves high commendation; and that LoRD PAL-
MERSTQN, for having served his country above forty years, preserved
peace during nearly all that time, and towards the end of it concluded
the Russian war successfully, merits much dispraise. Also, that LoRD
John RussłLL, who, carried the Reform Bill, and who has combined
civil and religious liberality with resistance to foreign and invasive
priestcraft, is worthy of vehement hisses.
We are next informed that—
“FRIEND BRIGHT found but few friends in the assembly, and there was not a
single sheer to redeem the volley of disapprobation that burst on the recital of his
name.”
MR. BRIGHT is i. by the Undergraduates of Oxford to be a
democrat without a redeeming quality.
Then we find that—
“Three cheers were proposed for MR. GLADstone, but were given amid over-
powering groans, and next in succession was suggested, “Three grºans for his incon-
sistency,’ which received the promptest attention.”
Accordingly, a majority of the Oxford Undergraduates condemns
MR. GLADston E for giving his country the benefit of his abilities as a
member of a Liberal Government.
The MARQUIs of CHANDos was heartily cheered. The Oxford
Undergraduates think that he has done something. MR. DISRAELI
was “highly popular,” and
sº" and long were the plaudits lavished on the Chancellor of THE Exche-
The Undergraduates of Oxford are, perhaps, under the impression
that MR. DisrAELI is the author, not only of some clever novels, but
also of very much useful legislation.
The Bishop of Oxford and DR, Pusey were also “very popular,
and their names were hailed with rounds of applause.”
. The Undergraduate theologians of Oxford approve of Puseyism and
its saponaceous prelate.
We had almost omitted one material expression of the Under-
graduates' sentiments:—
“‘Three groans for the Times newspaper' was a proposition, too, that was carried
out to the very letter.”
The Times, therefore, is not the leading journal in the estimation of
}: ºrd Undergraduates. Of course they prefer the Morning
erata.
We now return to the proposition with which we started,—that the
Undergraduates of Oxford indicate, to a certainty, the right, or the
wrong side in politics by their hisses or their cheers. The right side
is denoted by the former, and the wrong by the latter. Their seniors
need not be ashamed of stooping occasionally, to take a lesson from
these young gentlemen.

A YOUNG LADY ON THE HIGH CLASSICAL SCHOOL OF
ORNAMENT
“MY DEAREST MAUDE,
“You know that the RANDoMs have just returned from their long residence
on the Continent, and I am longing to tell you that I spent a day last week with
IMAGEN.RANDoM, who kindly showed me her jewel casket. O, MAUDE! how I
wished for you to share my excitement! I have not yet recovered it, and the only
comfort I have, is that last night, after dinner, I coaxed Papa into a promise
that we shall spend next winter in Rome ourselves! IMogºs says, of course
there is a great deal to see in Rome that everybody must see, but then you know,
dear, we read about all those things when we were at school, and we can buy plenty
of photographs of the Coliseum, the Forum, and the Temples, &c., to show our
friends in England where we have been, so that we need not waste much time upon
them. ...!!y great object in Rome is to go, the very first thing, to that dear,
delightful, interesting shop, CAs, ELLANI's, in the Via Poli, where, IMogen says,
ou, have nothing to do but to lay down scudi enough, in order to be made per-
ſectly classical in appearance and style. Only think of that! Every thing there
is taken exactly from the antique, so that you are quite safe in choosing whatever
you like, and cannot go wrong.
“By the way, however, IMogen says, it is just as well to take a look at the
Etruscan Room in the Campana Museum when you have a spare hour, that you
may satisfactorily judge for yourself what perfect copies. CastELLANI's ornaments
are. IMOGEN's jewel-casket contains two or three º Bullas, one set with

ECONOMY IN EARTHQUAKES.
IN Manilla, the windows of the houses are made of
oyster-shell instead of glass. This is done with a double
view—the first being to keep out the glare of the sun, and
the second being to keep down the expense of an earth-
quake. The latter is a frequent visitor in Manilla, looking
in repeatedly upon the inhabitants without the smallest
ceremony; nor is the earthquake seemingly in the least
propitiated by the august-like appearance of the casements.
Apparently, he does “remember the grotto,” though un-
fortunately for the natives, his remembrance comes rather
oftener than “only once a year.” It must be awkward to
live in a town that is so constantly being shelled from top
to bottom in this way! Fancy waking up some morning,
and seeing half-a-dozen shells flying in hot haste into your
bed (or shakedown, rather), in consequence of an earth-
quake, with the deliberate aim of a canon de précision,
battering the walls of the town down! Such a town is
only fit i. Quakers—or Earthquakers, as you might call
them—to hang their broadbrims up in. It is not adapted
for persons of steady habits like our own. Our steadi-
ness would be shocked to see, through the medium of
these oyster-shell windows, the sun reflected the first
thing in the morning in bright visions of “early purl.”

she has found them very inadequate to the massive and heavy, not to say ponderous,
style of ornament, which, it seems, a classical costume requires. Between our-
selves, she confessed to me, that the weight of her Bullas, and her gladiator's
necklace is positively distressing to the collar-bones; that her hair is visibly
diminished since she took to wearing Greek daggers and Roman pins, both of
which are so pretty and so antique, that she is unable to give a preference to either,

“Leycester Squar, July, 1859.
“Mox cher Ponc
HE,
“KNow you what is that which is what we call élanº. It is
that quality in our soldiers which renders them irresistible. Without
doubt, that which causes this attribute so admirable of the French
troops, it is their courage. But besides that, it must be that there
is another reason of that speciality of our braves. For what the
Austrians, also brave, have they not the like of it? I go to tell you:
it is the same defect of your own forces, so incomparable for their
solidity. It is something of physic-a certain stiffness of the limbs.
From whence comes that? I will declare it to you. In a word, it is
for fault of not to have never learned to dance. From their first
infancy all our soldiers have danced always; that has rendered them
agile, Your own come to the parade from the plough, where they
only learned to hop the clod. If you wish them to approach our own
in &lan, make teach them all to dance. Let the dance be aſº of the
drill military. Your regiments have bands that play quadrilles, for
what good, unless the men dance to them? Make them do so. Let a
master of dance be appointed to every regiment, beginning with the
Guards of the British Grenadiers. I give you permission to inform
M. the Duke of CAMBRIDGE that I am willing to undertake that part
of the education of the distinguished Coldstreams. . -
“Accept, Sir Ponche, the assurance of my high consideration.
“JULES DE DEUxTEMPs.
“P.S.—Your divine WILLIAMs—or JAcks—however, some one of
our great poets, said, that none but the brave deserve the fair sex.
The passion which inspires beauty is intimately related to that which
vents itself in combat; it is thus the necessary partners of the dance
contribute to inflame the invincible ferocity of our Zouaves.”
WHAT OUR WESTRYMEN HAVE DONE FOR US.
So it seems that, after all, it is the French we have to thank for the
Advertising Column which so graces Hyde Park Corner. Well, we
must confess we are not surprised to hear it. Although we English
are so famous for embellishing our streets, we somehow fancied that
this column was a cut or two above us. The design seemed far too
tasty for an insular conception; and the º happy blending of
ornament with usefulness appeared much too felicitous for English
minds to procreate. -
The discovery of authorship we owe to MR. CowPER, who has taken
up the task of putting down these nuisances;-a task which, we opine,
should win for MR. Cowper as much praise as the Task brought tº
his poetic namesake. It was in these words MR. Cowper, made
mention of the fact that the Piccadilly column was not a British
work of art, but, like bad English farces, was “taken from the
French”:-
“We had often been threatened with a French invasion, but one had now actu-
ally taken place to which he desired to call the attention of the House. A certain
French company had come over to London and had taken possession of some of the
chief thoroughfares of the Metropolis, including Hyde Park Corner, where they had
pulled up the pavement and established a remarkably uncouth edifice, which
a lbough one Member of the House regarded it as ornamental, was looked upon by
almost every one-lse as a hideous disfigurement. (Hear, hear.) It was stated that
the company intended to erect similar columns at Chelsea Bridge and a hundred
other places, for which they had obtained the permission of the local vestries.”
Have, they, indeed?, What a charming prospect for us! How
thankful we should be that we live in a free country, and that we are
blessed with vestrymen to govern us! What delight it is to think
that (but for meddling MR. Cowper) we might have seen our streets
adorned with a hundred other columns, each as tasteful and as useful
as that opposite the Duke! But this odious MR. CowPER thinks our
streets look best without them; and, as to their utility, he sneeringly
observes:–
“The only excuse that was offered for those structures was, that they gave
information to the public, and it was true that anybody could ascertain from them
the nearest police station, the time of day, the day of the month, the direction of
the wind, and among other information, the hour at which Cremorne opened, the
}. where a soirée dansante was held, and the residence of DR. Eary. That in-
ormation might be very useful, but the middle of a crowded carriage-way, where
those who stºp to read would incur a great risk of being run over, was hardly
the fittest place to publishit.”
Offer an excuse, forsooth! Pray what apology is needed for a
structure which embellishes and beautifies a º As well offer an
excuse for having built the National Gallery, or for the graceful
squirts and statues which adorn its lovely front! And then this
ruffian. MR. CowPER has the barbarous audacity to bring to ridicule
an ancient institution of the country, and to question if our vestrymen
be fit to govern public taste;—
"As he said, the parish vestries had sanctioned these erections, and according to
the present state of the law they had power to do so; but he thought that vestries,
although very proper to superintend the paving and lighting of the streets, were
not the best § to act as guardians of the public taste.”
That a British House of Commons should degrade itself by listening
to such sentiments as these, and then should, by a swingeing majority
of votes, give the utterer of such language leave for bringing in his
Bill, is to our mind a full proof that the British Constitution is fast
sinking in decline, and that rampant Red Republicans will soon dance
upon its corse!

which Banbury is so widely and justly celebrated. We may
also conjecture that the two statues, which are to accom.
pany the image of her MAJESTY will be equestrian. One
of them will probably be that of an elderly female on an
animal resplendent in the native hue of stainless marble.
The fingers of this effigy of an ancient dame will be adorned
with rings; and to the ten toes, visible through the pecu-
liarity of her costume and chaussure, will be appended as
many small bells, which, vibrating in the breeze, will make

A HELPING HAND FOR THE HANDEL COLLEGE.
QAMBRIDGE Dons and Oxford Doctors may be startled by this heading,
and may wonder where on earth the Handel College is, for at neither
University has its name been ever extant. Mr. Punch who is in this,
as in all other matters, more learned than the learnedest of either
Dons or Doctors, will devote himself as usual to the task of their
enlightenment. -
To the question, where on earth the Handel College is, the answer
is, at present it is not on earth at all. The Handel College is as yet in
being but in Fi but of course now Mr. Punch is pleased to advocate
its name, its local habitation will be speedily complete. To dolts who
doubt the power of Mr. Punch's influence, it may be shown from the
Prospectus that there are other grounds for a belief in his prediction:-
“A Plot of ground, (the lowest value of which, for building purposes, is estimated
at £5,000,) has been offered gratuitously, and Mr own on Es, likewise gratui-
tously, has consented to act as Honorary Architect, to draw plans and superintend
the building. This part of the movement cannot fail to be considered as the ground-
work of the charity, and justifies the Promoters in making an appeal to the Public
for their cordial support in the undertaking."
As the promoters of the College are doing a good work, Mr. Punch
will give them pardon for making a bad pun, inspeaking of the building
land and plans which have been offered them as being, in their view,
the “groundwork” of the charity. With what good intentions the
College will be paved, the short sentence which next follows is quite
long enough to show:—
“The study and toil of the Musician do not always lead to large º
rewards, and, co uently, the Orphan children of poor but deserving Musicians
are often, whilst still young and helpless, thrown upon the world unprotected and
unprovided for; and it remains only to state that the College or Asylum will be for
the Orphans of Musicians of all Classes, to afford those Orphans a Home whilst
unable to assist themselves, and so to educate them as to enable them to obtain a
respectable living when they arrive at a proper age to go out into the world.”
Lest some may think the College inappropriately christened, the
promoters state their reasons for the name they have selected: which
are, that as the College is intended to be founded in the year which is
to all known as the first, HANDEL centenary, they wish to pay a “lasting
tribute to his memory” by connecting with his name the charity
they set on foot. As HANDEL was himself a charitable man, and pre-
sented to a charity the greatest of his works, there seems fit reason
now to make a handle of his name, if it will be of service to a charitable
end. Other good and noble names, too, are connected with the Colle
as guarantees...that all in-comings will be properly laid, out. The
smallest contributions will be thankfully received, and the largest will
by no means be less thankfully acknowledged. If the more than
eighty thousand who attended the late Festival were to pay a fit thank-
offering for the pleasure they received, the Handel &l. Fund
would nearly be as goodly a property as Punch /
One last grind on the reader's º of benevolence. Let him, if in
his soul he be musical, reflect, that { helping to bring up the helpless

OH, HOW JOLLY!
THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION.
WHAT is the Momentous Question?...It is not Reform. The little interest that
anybody might ever have felt in that, died away when the word had been used for
the last election cry. The War had some claim to pre-eminence; and the individual
who has recently invested capital in Knickerbockers, would naturally make out
a strong case to show that the formation of Rifle Corps bore of the º
But if we go to that never failing index of public opinion, the youth of London,
we shall find that the momentous question is of a personal nature, that it is one
which must stir instantly the inmost recesses of all hearts. It must cause equal
anxiety to the prince and the peasant, the daughter and the diplomatist, the
minister and the mamma. . . -
A, dark cloud of suspicion, appears to have fallen on candid and confiding
England, for daily ten thousand Britons insinuate the existence of a sinister pur.
pose in the bosoms of their brethren, by asking in melo-dramatic tones the awful
question, What’s your little game?
The history of Europe during the months of May and June, 1859, might have
been altered, if some six months ago, that munificent nobleman who represents
our country at the court of Paris, upon receiving assurances more fervid than
usual of the goodwill borne by a great personage towards all mankind, had sud-
denly administered an interrogative thrust to the imperial ribs (such as his Excel-
lency of (P.) Bedford might give to his bland Majesty under similar circumstances),
and popped the question. Qr if court etiquette forbade a direct hº bein
put to a sovereign, the effect would scarcely have been diminished, if he .
adopted the equally Fº form of observation, “I knows your little game.”
en a noble leader of the Liberal party submitted a certain resolution, to the
consideration of another noble leader—a resolution which ultimately caused some
small expense to the members of the legislature, and some little delay in the
business of the country—it can scarcely be doubted that the statesman who gave

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 11. Monday. Lord RIPON stated that, in order to make Volun-
teers clearly understand that they were not Regulars, the Government
did not intend to pay them a single shilling on any pretence whatsoever.
On the contrary, they were themselves to pay their instructors. The
case of the Coolies, who (facetiousness is inevitable) are so coolly kid-
mapped for the West Indies, came up; but the Duke of Newcastle
said the subject was really so important that he could not think of
attending to it.
It was always a most desirable thing to have a telegraph wire from
India to England, and now that the former country f. been handed
over to such a person as SIR CHARLEs Wood, the necessity of knowing
how things go on is greater than ever. Therefore, as #. object is a
national one, it is very proper that Government, by guarantee, should
facilitate the scheme, and a Bill for the purpose was all but finished off
to-night. The wire is already laid to Aden, and the Mahometans have
been aidin' the promoters very loyally, and whacking some contu-
macious pilgrims, who, not seeing the use of the signal-posts, naturally
knocked them down. -
The Great Clock has come to grief again, owing to the architect's
interference. The hands have been made very handsome, but so pre-
cious heavy that the works will not act on them. Why on º oes
not Lok D PALMERston take the matter up? When he was at the War
Office, about eighty or ninety years ago, he had the Horse Guards'
clock taken to pieces and improved in every way; and if he would just
use his energies, which are as vigorous now as they were in the early
part of the last century, the thing would be done.
LoRd JoHN RUssell, in answer to MR. DisrAELI, professed total
ignorance upon the subject of the negotiations which that very day
were going on at Villafranca, between the Eagles. The House then
went into Supply, and MR. Kin NAIRD pleaded piteously for the poor
aristocrats º carriages cannot get from the Exhibition and
FARRANck's, the pastrycook's, into St. James's Park, by Spring

poohed him, and actually condescended to urge that the part KINNAIRD
wanted to cut up was a quiet walk, liked by the humbler classes and
their children. It is disgusting to hear such vulgar arguments paraded
in an assembly of gentlemen; but bad examples are contagious, and
MR. HENRY HERBERT proceeded to point out another bit of ground
that might as well also be opened to the poor children., HERBERT
may have a sort of right to talk in this way, because he throws open
his own lovely grounds at Killarney (O ! MATILDA, MARIA O,
them eyes! O! SIR CREsswell CREsswf:LL!—But lie down, Our
Heart) to the wanderer, and is hereby thanked and immortalised; but
what heed was there for Mr. Six Nºy to follow with his perpetual
pleading in behalf of the children of the poor? Really, Honourable
Gentlemen forget their dignity.
It was refreshing, after that display of vulgarity, to find a real
specimen of military gentility, full blown. There is in the House a
§. Dickson, whose modesty is so great that he has concealed
his merits, hitherto, with so perfect a success that nobody has ever
been able to find them out, -a noble answer to the snobs who sneer at
military, insolence,—but who was on this occasion inspired, by just
indignation, to come out strong about “trash in the newspapers.”
The fact was, that an excellent letter had appeared in the Times,
written by an officer who is also a soldier, calling attention to one of
the most important questions of the day, the position and condition of
the Army. The letter infuriated Dickson (or perhaps he may be a
skilful carpet tactician, who likes to please military superiors), and he
exploded, as aforesaid, about “trash,” and gave GENERAL PEEL an oppor-
tunity of announcing that he felt the “greatest possible contempt”
for newspaper opinions. This is fair enough, for before Jonati AN
was happily ejected from office, the newspapers afforded the public
sufficing reasons, for feeling the same sentiment touching his abilities.
However, PEEL had to answer the newspaper “trash,” and, if he has
not made any blunders in his figures, his statement is satisfactory,
inasmuch as we have 110,000 soldiers at home, including Militia, but
excluding Marines and the Enrolled Pensioners, and our artillery is in
good order. -
Wiscount WILLIAMs DE LAMBETH abused the Navy Estimates, for
the very reason why, Wiscount Punch De FLEETstreet applauds
them;--they are the largest ever presented to Parliament in time of
peace. They are £12,862,000. There was much more sense in his objec-
tion to flogging our sailors. The British Lion should cut low relations,
and the Cat is a very seedy member of the Felis ramily. Keep whip-
cord for the aspirants to hemp, wife-smashers, fraudulent trustees, and
the like. The Estimates occupied the rest of the night, except what
was consumed in a discussion on a Bill for robbing certain rate-payers
in order to make up for robberies caused by the neglect of certain
parochial officers.
Tuesday, Came the news that Louis NApoleon, who had gone to
War on a pledge that the Austrians should be driven out of Italy, had
“funked” at the Quadrilateral, and, after losing about 100,000 men in

unprofitable combat, had asked for negotiations, succumbed to Austrian
dictation, and submitted to leave the double-headed Eagle in posses-
sion of the terrible Quadrilateral aforesaid, to º: the creatures
of Austria on the petty thrones from which they had been shaken, and
so to end the war; a ridiculous and ephemeral juggle of a Papal
Presidency of Confederated Italy, and the handing over a portion of
Lombardy to the KING OF SARDINIA (whose Minister, Count CAvour,
retires in disgust), being the dust to be thrown in the eyes of such of
the inhabitants ºf Europe as took off their j. after a certain
Second of December. Populus cult decipi, decipiatur, is to be the
device for the Tuileries illuminations. The news was duly announced
to the Lords and the Commons.
LoRD LYNDHURST got a Select Committee to consider how justice
is baffled by the ridiculous mode of taking Chancery evidence. The
Commons declined to allow a Scotch parson, named GRIEVE, to trans-
figure himself into an English parson. LoRD John Russell had not
decided whether he would let the QUEEN accept the Feejee Islands.
MR. CHIsholm ANSTEY's case, brought on by MR. Edwin JAMEs, has
really something in it, and seems to disclose some awful rascality at
Hong Kong; but the DUKE of NEwcASTLE had not had time to read
the hardships of the Civil Examination system, which brutally insists
that a young gentleman, in describing himself, shall not begin Jackass
with a G; but KockREIN, as one of his protégés would probably write
it, failed. On the appointment of two Committees, the usual row was
made by the Irish, and then came #' of the Howling Shindy pre-
dicted by Mr. Punch, touching the Bill for permitting a Catholic to be
Irish Chancellor. Government supported the Bill, and the debate
stood over, after, some good firing; nobody, of course, except Exeter
Hall, being in the least in earnest, and Exeter Hall being in earnest
only in wanting to spite the Papishes.
Wednesday. Religion—that is to say, Church-rates—all day. SIR
John TRELAwNEY's Abolition Bill on for second reading; and, after a
decorous fight by the Conservatives, and some unblishing Ratting
(which is politely called submitting your own opinion to that of
others) by
carrie
rejected by the Lords. -
Thursday. LoRD CAMPBELL introduced a very º Bill, for
the purpose of letting attorneys loose upon the public at the end of
three, instead of five, years’ study, if they have graduated at a
university. However, solicitors who get on by Degrees are usually
preferred to those who get suddenly rich. The Spº OF NEWCASTLE
stated that Government intended to refuse to renew the licence to the
Hudson's Bay Company, who are a sort of modern incarnation of the
feudal game system, and endeavour to keep an enormous territory
clear of human beings, in order to promote the breed of animals whose
skins will sell. The DUKE of SoMERSET explained that we are not to
look at our mercantile steamers as possible war-ships.
In the Commons, after some practical discussion touching the
Indian army, Supply came on again, and all the Navy Estimates were
disposed of, the debate pleasantly finishing with a row between SIR
J. GRAHAM and SIR. C. §. on the old subject, the Baltic fleet.
“He man the Fleet !” exclaimed CHARLEy, in a rage: “there never
was a fleet sent to sea in such a disgraceſul state!”. And he demanded
leave to read to the House his enemy's private letters, which, SIR
JAMEs retorted, the impolite Admiral had already done. SIDNEY
HERBERT then moved the Army Estimates
ment, and got several votes on account of about £12,000,
means to have for the soldiers.
[J/r. Punch was leaving the House, soon after two on Friday morning,
when the odour of the abominable river came upon him in a foul flood.
He staggered, and was carried by LoRD PALMERston, LoRD John
Russell, and MR. DisBAELI to his carriage. After some minutes he
felt a little better, thank you, but owed it to himself and the world
immediately to leave town for his beautiful country seat, where he is at
present staying with his attached family.]
Morality Rewarded.
It was but a few days ago that it was announced, apropos of the
uadrilateral, that Austria was going, for the first time, to “deal on
the Square.” See how Virtue prospers! No sooner has she taken
this course, than the War ends, and she saves nearly every pound of
her Italian bacon."Who would not be virtuous?
“The EDUCATED CLASSEs.”
CAN the pets of LoRD MALMESBURY, who at an examination cannot
pass from getting impaled on their own pothooks and hangers, be
supposed to belong to the “educated section?” . If they do belong to
ALMERSTON and JoHN Ryssell, such second reading was lº
by 263 to 193, in about which proportion the Bill will be
the class, we will wager they are at the bottom of it.
FIGURES AMONGST FLOWERS.
IN the tropical aquarium, in Kew Gardens (which can now be ad:
mired in all their gay holiday attire, and are visited by thousands of
happy droppers-in every day—only what a pity it is that their beauties
are not visible until One o'clock P.M., as though Nature were a
coquette, whose toilette would not possibly allow her to “receive” at
an earlier hour!) there may be seen a fine specimen of that most won-
derful of all vegetable productions, the lace, or lattice-leaf, plant of
Madagascar. Ladies, who have an educated eye for lace-work, are
particularly recommended to pay it a visit. We suppose young Mada-
f." brides wear veils and entire dresses made of this particular
ace, on their wedding-days, and doubtlessly fancy it as becoming as
Valenciennes, or the most pointed production of Brussells. We are
told that this plant has been largely copied by artificial florists, and
that many millions of leaves have been made and moulded into wreaths,
garlands, and chaplets. It has produced considerable profit to the
manufacturers, who have named it “the skeleton leaf.” We should
have preferred a more flowery name. It isn't a pretty notion to wreathe
the #. Mr. Cocîr ANE made an attempt to get rid of some of ..."; the brow of Beauty a coronal with such an anatomical association
of ideas. Fancy the head of your beloved smothered in skeleton-
|leaves! However, it is too much to expect poetry and millinery too
from a manufacturer. If the flowers of his imagination were not as
artificial as the others he sells, the contrast might be injurious to his
business. We should have thought rather that it had been the poor
milliners, who realise starvation prices only by their needles, who
had given this plant the ironical name of the “skeleton-leaf.” In
their bitterness and want, they must mockingly think that the thread
of their existence could have been made out of no other leaf.

FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS OF A PARLIAMENTARY LIFE.
At a Finsbury dinner (Finsbury ought to be doubly blest, for it can
boast now of its “PET,” and its PETo), MR. T. DuNcombe, after
alluding to his five-and-twenty years of Parliamentary services, said:—
“Of all things he desired to see before terminating his

ITALY IS FREE,
ITALY's free—Italy’s free—
From Savoy to Sicily, shore unto sea!
The Frenchman has come—with his “hey presto, quick!”
The two headed Eagle before him to kick.
Why ask antecedents? Why hint of a doubt?
Coups d'état, Boulevard massacres, why prate about?
Don't you hear how he swears—a bold swearer is he—
That he’s come to set Italy free—very free—
Look again, little dears, clear as mud it must be,
That his promise is kept, and that Italy’s free!
True, you might have asked voice as to sheathing the sword:
You might have wished Piedmont to put in her word:
Might have wished the black vulture's broad wings to be clipped:
Might have wished certain dukes of their dukedoms well stripped:
Might, some, p'raps, have wished for a little less Pope,
for some folk, not so much and for some folks more rope:
Might have wished one United Italia to be—
But a truce to your wishes and wants—aren't you free?
Yes—only look hard enough; plainly you’ll see,
That Italy's free—oh—exceedingly free!
Qf the PQPE at your head—that kind well-meaning man;–
You are free to make just the best use that you can:
With an Austrian rivet on leg and on arm,
To }. you from making too free to your harm,
And a Tuscan fº. and a Modenese too,
And a youthful KING BoMBA—who's freer than you?
Qf course you’re not flee to bite, struggle, and kick:
Austria's maxim is still, “Spoil the ch d, spare the stick.”
You can’t wish to be free, to make rumpus and row;
You don't know what's good for you, of course you’ll allow—
So, to pastors and masters obedient you'll be,
Ilike a good little Italy—though you are free.
Free–free—from the shore to the sea—
From the Alps to the Appenines--free, all so free?
DEAD WELLS AND DRINKING FOUNTAINS.
PUT this and that together. This is part of one letter in the Times:
“SIR, Seeing a recommendation from Sir JAMEs DUKE to erect a fountain to be
supplied from the well at St. Dunstan's, Fleet Street, I have taken the liberty of
stating I saw that said well filled up to the brim with the bones of the dead who
had been buried in the old Church ; therefore I think it advisable the fountain
should be erected at some distance from that sacred spot.”
That—subjoined—is another letter in the Times, printed immediately
below the preceding;-
“SIR, If your Correspondent ‘S. J. M.” refers to the Church on St. Dunstan's
Hill, E.C., I beg to inform him that there is at the present moment a pump, the
water from which is deliciously cool, and very extensively used.”
|Ugh
!; had been happy,”—the consumer of St. Dunstan's well-water
may say, borrowing, with a slight difference, the words of Othello, “if
the general parish, myself, and all, had tasted the contents of that well,
so I had nothing known.” The two letters are quite reconcileable one
with the other. If the old well was filled with the materials named in
the first letter, the pump mentioned in the second must belong to a
new well s close by. The delicious coolness of the water, which
causes it to be “extensively used,” is just what.confirms the state-
ment of both the correspondents of the Times. Water, derived from
the sources which St. Dunstan's fluid must, by their united account,
come from, is known to be popular; chemistry explains why; it is a
saline draught. But chemistry also shows that it is something more
and something worse; and sanitary science says that it is very un-
wholesome "Drink not that water, the constitution of which suggests
that it might be drunk standing and in silence.
Nobility Sharpens the Appetite.
Swell. Do you know, my fine fellah, I was dining with the DUKE of
CAMBRIDGE yesterday.
Envious Friend. Nonsense! -
Swell. Yes—true, 'pon honnah, at the London Tavern!

ERE is an advertisement which
may interest Paterfamilias,
who has no end of millimers'
bills to pay:—

COATS. – MADAME AMET
cautions persons from dealing in
the above, unless signed “AMET."
Paterfamilias willbeamused,
as well as interested, by this
announcement. Considering
that there is nothing in the
isolated word AMET to show
that it is a French proper
name, and not the third per-
son singular of the imperative
mood, present tense, of the
Latin verb, “amo,” “to love,”
he may be disposed to smile
at the idea of his wife and
daughters going about with
such a º: inscribed on any
ortion of their dresses. If MADAME AMET wishes to advertise her
º ch-spring Petticoats, perhaps she has her name marked on the under
margin, so as to be exhibited in walking, in the case of most young,
and in that of some old, ladies by the voluntary.upholding of the
skirts. That name elegantly embroidered in that situation, would be
highly ornamental, and might be useful as an advertisement, not only
of the maker but also of the wearer, if unmarried and wishing not to
remain so. AMET, whatever the word may be understood to mean by
womankind, will, by mankind be translated, “Let him love;” that is,
“Let somebody love” (understand) me—with a view of course to
marrying me—in other words, “I am in want of a husband.” “To be

by “AMET.” displayed on a petticoat. -
No doubt, watch-spring jº. are highly fashionable, and the
watch-springs are calculated to make the petticoats go; and, if º
have the same effect on the single daughters of Paterfamilias, they wi
be worth that gentleman's money.
EXTREME PROBABILITIES.
We live in high pressure times, but Mr. Punch flatters himself (or,
rather, does himself simple justice in asserting), that He can keep
ahead of the times, the telegrams, and even the talk of his wife, or
anything else, no matter how distressingly fast it may be. He believes
he has rather been and done it with the following information, which
has not yet reached even Printing House Square:–
IMPORTANT TELEGRAMS.
RECEIVED THROUGH MR. REUTER's OFFICE.
“Paris, August 24.
“The EMPERoR is dissatisfied (mécontent) with LoRD PALMeRSTON's
explanation on the English National Defences. He still, regards
them as a menace to the independence of France and an insult to her
glory. He has desired the DUKE of SoMERSET to be sent over.”
“Paris, August 25.
“The DUKE of SoMERSET has been waiting in an ante-room of the
Tuileries for five hours. The EMPEROR has just sent to say that he is
going to the Opera, and the man must come again early in the morning
(de bon matin). The Duke was in such a rage at being called a man
that he pulled the nose of the menial who brought the message. This
has complicated matters.” -
“Paris, August 26.
“The nose has been put straight, but the EMPEROR has given the
Duke orders to return, instantly (tout à l'heure) to discontinue all work
in your dockyards, and to despatch one half of your entire fleet to
join the anti-slavery squadron, off Brazil.”
“Paris, August 27.
“Qn consideration, the EMPERQR sees in the Battery at Brighton a
standing menace to Dieppe. He has sent orders to have the flag staff
taken down, and the platform turned into a station for donkeys.”
“Paris, August 28.
“You will hear to-morrow that the EMPEROR has desired the Tower
of London to be dismantled ...} and the LoRD MAYOR sent
over as a hostage for the performance of the decree.”
“Paris, August 29.
“His Imperial Majesty has transmitted directions to the English
War Office to disband the whole of the various Rifle Associations, and
send over their weapons to Boulogne for the armament of the Capécure
Zouaves.”
- “ Paris, August 30.
“The EMPERQR requires the dissolution of the English Yacht Clubs
and the destruction of all yachts whose tonnage is over three tons and
a quarter. LoRD ALFRED PAGET and MR. A. ARCEDECKNE are to be
forwarded to Paris by the night-train.”
“Paris, August 31.
“The Court of the Tuileries is extremely dissatisfied at the delay in
carrying out the |. already made, and regards it as an ap-
proach to the perfidious system of treachery (trahison) so often and so
unworthily practised by England in her relations with her forei
friends. A demand will be made to-morrow which will decisively
intimate His Majesty's feelings.”
“Paris, September 1.
“The EMPEROR selects this day, the first of the partridge season, to
demand that every English person possessed of a gun of any kind shall
instantly pack it in a box, and remit it, carriage paid, to the Minister
of War, Paris. Pistols are included in this order.”
- “ Paris, September 2.
... “The EMPEROR desires that the Buoy at the Nore be cut loose, as
it acts as a kind of bait (amorce) to the English to indulge in excursions
and cultivate that nautical taste which has rendered them so insolently
rough in their behaviour to Continentals.”
“Paris, September 3.
“The EMPEROR demands, that Ramsgate, Dover, Plymouth,
Lowestoft, Aberystwith, Southampton, andſ Gravesend, be at once
ceded to France, not as accession of territory (a view which France
abhors, and repudiates), but in trust for the Liberty of Europe, as
defined by His Majesty.”
“Paris, September 4.
“The EMPEROR has heard with sympathy Ireland's cry of agony.
|Her bitter cup is now full, and it is reserved for him to dash it to the
ground. Her liberation is at hand (tout près). GENERAL MAcMAHON
a descendant of her Kings, who were allies of France before #ngland
was discovered by CAESAR, is charged with the execution of this decree.
ºt “Paris, September 5.
The EMPEROR DEMANDs THAT MR. PUNCH BE seNT over. To
PARIs, INSTANTLY, IN chAINs.”
“ Dorer, September 9.
“ADMIRAL SIR CHARLEs, NAPIER has just annihilated the united
fleets of France, Austria, and Russia, and is swearing awfully because
his grog is not strong enough.”
ERROR OF THE PRESS.
SPEAKING of the peace, a philo-French contemporary of ours is
pleased to say:—
“Throughout the whole campaign, which the Villafranca treaty, we think, fairly
terminates, the EMPERoR Napoleon has kept one consistent course. From his
first step to his last, he has advanced with firmness, but with moderation. In
France and in the field, in the Court and in the Camp, he has acted all along with a
suaviter in modo, which not many men in England believed that he and
ſewer still that he would have the strength of mind to exercise.”
There is in this statement an error in the spelling, which, to please
LORD MALMESBURY, we hasten to correct. However suavely the
EMPEROR may have acted in the Court, it is sheer nonsense to say that
he has done so in the Camp. But rather than º the wisdom of
the writer, we look upon "is error as a typographical mistake. If he
had said that in the field Louis NAPOLEon acted “Zouaviter in modo,”
the statement would have been more in accordance with the fact.
CONJUGATOR. DE SE.
A REMARKABLE appeal from the Court of Exchequer in Ireland
came, the other day, §. the House of Lords. The case was that of
BEAMIsh v. BEAMish, and the point in question was the validity of
what may be called a truly Irish marriage. That marriage took place
in 1831, privately, between the REv. SAMUEL SwayNE BEAMIs H and
IsabelLA FRASER, at the house of one ANNE LEwis, in the City of
Cork, and the ceremony was performed by the reverend bridegroom
himself. Matrimony and hanging are often spoken of as mutually
analogous, the parties in both cases being said to be “tied up; ” but
though many fools have hanged themselves, very few have ever thought
of marrying themselves, and perhaps nobody but a clergyman of MR.
BEAMIsh's country could contemplate the rash act of sui-splice.

Courteous Stranger. “Em—Would you like to see the Newspaper, Sir f"
[Exhausted Editor, who has seen nothing but Newspapers for the last four-and-twenty
hours, looks aghast!
THE FORTIFICATION OF LONDON.
THE Dutch once came up the Thames, and
burnt our ships in the River. Catch anybod
serving us the same trick now, at least in such
weather as this, when the state of the Thames is
such as not only to secure it from the approach
of an invader, but also, alone, to maintain it irre-
sistibly on the offensive." Whilst the Thames
enables us to hold our own in holding our noses,
as at present, there is little fear that any enemy
will venture to show his nose in the River. That
is our ditch of defiance; our moat inaccessible.
The great Copropolitan tidal drain is a sewer-
intrenchment against all adversaries, and will be
|found an impregnable British stronghold º the
| dirtiest foreigners, who have hitherto always
been supposed to be much stronger than we
are, including all the . of our Great Un-
washed. The most powerful of strangers to
England and ablution will recoil from our over-
powering Thames.
A Trifle from the River.
At the Thames Yacht Club Meeting the other
day we observe that “Zouave got near Westal,
and then came Alarm.” Just what would hap-
pen, we should think, if one of the red-breeched
tauriens called Zouaves had the chance indicated.
However, “after Zouave came on Destiny.” If
ever the situation be realised ashore, we trust
that the rigging of the last-named craft will
comprise one rope only.
A PRIZE BUTCHER,
THE sign-boards of certain rural hostelries of the good old style
romise the equestrian traveller “Entertainment for Man and Horse.”
hat is to say, eggs and bacon, bread and cheese, cold meat, perhaps
and chicken, are at the service of the biped; whilst the quadruped wi
find hay in his manger, and may get a feed of corn. The horse will be
entertained with water; the man with beer and pipes. The entertain-
ment of the one will differ considerably from that of the other. Until
lately, the idea of a man and a horse entertaining themselves, or bein
entertained, with the same meals, would have been deemed absurd.
The subjoined testimonial, however, appended to an advertisement of
“HENRI and Co.'s Patent Horse and Cattle Feed,” seems to show
that, however ridiculous it may be to imagine, the superior being,
except in danger of starvation, resorting to the diet of the lower
animal, that preposterous eccentricity is nevertheless a fact:—
“Dulwich.
“I hereby certify, that in º: of having experienced the beneficial
effects of HENRI & Co.'s Cattle Feed, I have taken one cwt more, and will continue
to use it, and also to recommend it to my friends and the public generally.
“GEORGE SHAw, Butcher.”
. A butcher, of all men, is the last one would expect to find regaling
himself upon cattle food. Is MR. GEORGE SHAw a vegetarian? That
is possible, even as a brewer may be a teetotaller; and many brewers,
for reasons which are best known to themselves, never taste their own
beer. What must that beer be, then, after it has undergone the mani-
º: of the publican? But this is a digression; and we return to
R. GEORGE SHAw, with the question, now that he has taken more
than one cwt. of HENRI and Co.'s Patent Horse and Cattle Feed, how
much, he has gained in weight on that provender? Also, to what
extent he carries his vegetable feeding: whether he ever grazes on a
common; whether he munches the furze there, and the thistles? We
hope we shall see MR. Shaw at the next Smithfield Club Cattle Show,
among the spectators if not in one of the stalls; and wish him, in
advance, a merry Christmas, and success to the beef which, as well as
his own carcase, he has doubtless fattened on Henri and Čo's Horse
and Cattle Feed.
AN ITALIAN ECHO.
: ITALIANs What’s your gain by Solferino?”
“Corpo di Bacco, English, bless'd if we know.”
THE WESTMINSTER PALACE, Clock-Since it was thought time
that this Clock should do something for its money, it has been decided
to put it at the head of HER MAJESTY's Stationary Office.
A SHYLOCK, AND A SKYLARK.
It is not often we find poetry in the purlieus of a Police Cºurt, but
the following case shows that it is sometimes to be met with there:
“John PINNEy, a boy about fourteen years of age, was charged with stealing a
cage containing a skylark, the property of a foreign Jew, named Solomon BERNARD
Polack, of No. 15, Mount Street, Wºº.
“MR YARDLEY, after hearing the evidence, said, I shall sentence the prisoner to
fourteen days' imprisonment for stealing the cage. As to the lark, it ought to be
singing in the sky.
“The Prosecutor. It sings at my house.
“Mr. YARDLEY. It ought to be singing in the air, over the fields and meadows.
Do you recollect the beautiful lines beginning “Hark! the lark at Heaven's gate
sings."
*#e Prosecutor. No, I know nothing of that.
“MR. YARDLEY. Give the lark freedom; release it.
“The Prosecutor. I will try. It cost me money.
“MR. YARDLEY. Now, do oblige me : release the bird.
“The Prosecutor. I'll try, I'll try. It cost me much money—think—the money,
Sare 1 (Laughter.)"
We almost wish MR. YARDLEY could have acted like the “wise
young judge” in SHAksPEARE, and, like that “Daniel come to judg-
ment,” could º have turned the tables on the Jew. We regret
almost that skylarks are not subject to the Game Laws, and t *
any one caught catching them and caging them might “catch it.
Larks are God's free creatures, and Fº what earthly right can
man claim to imprison, them : viewed as Nature's Fº they
belong to the fº fields which MR. YARDLEY speaks of; and stealing
them is clearly an act of petty larceny, which our Magistrates §
law should have the power to punish, Humane man, as he is, it woul
doubtless have rejoiced the heart of MR. YARDIEy, if, after sentencing
the boy for the stealing of the cage, he could have sent the Jew to
quod for the stealing of the skylark.
A Liberal Offer.
THERE is a hideous French column recently erected near the house
of the late victor of Waterloo. We all cry out for its removal. Now,

ADVERTISING COLUMNS.
IMPORTANT PUBLIC NOTICE!
-
EVERAL
myriads of
anxious correspond-
ents requiring inform-
ation, Mr. Punch begs
to give notice, that
the Bill" which has
been moved for “to
prevent, the setting
up of advertising co-
lumns” will in no
way interfere with
the setting up, as
usual, of His adver-
tising columns. These
columns will, as here-
tofore, be “set up”
every week by his
most careful of com-
positors, and no pains
will be spared to keep
out typical mistakes.
Mr. Punch may speak
with truth of his ad-
vertising columns as
being at once useful
and most highly or
namental. Unlike the
mad monstrosity
which now disfigures
Hyde Park Corner,
more even than the
monster statue of the
Duke, Mr. Punch's
columns always are
= set up in good taste,
and nothing that is
objectionable is ever
to be seen in them.
So far from being an eyesore, and disfiguring the streets, Mr. Punch avers that his adver.
tising columns adorn and greatly, beautify the fortunate, shop-windows in which they are
displayed. Mr. Punch nihil tetigit quod non ornarit; and he may point with pride to his
advertising columns, as proving with what good
taste he blends ornament with use. . It also is a
proof of the good taste of the public that his
advertising columns are held in such repute.
Still, although each week adds inches to their
high reputation, the charge for entrance to the
columns remains at a low figure. -
Mr. Punch concludes this notice by expressing
his opinion that, while the public have His
advertising columns at command, there can be
no public need of having any others; and he
therefore begs to pat MR., CowPER on the
back, for bringing in his Bill to prevent the
setting ºp of columns by French companies,
whom, if need be, Mr. Punch will use his
columns to set down.
THE BRITISH PEERAGE.
At high water the other day, Father Thames
was elevated to the House of Peers. His re-
ception was not of the most cordial nature, all
doors and windows being unceremoniously closed
to prevent, if possible, his admission. The
Peers, too, fled hastily in all directions to avoid
being brought into contact with this very super-
fluous, and anything but agreeable, addition to
their aristocratic House. The question is, what
can be done to purify the dirty old gentleman,
so that he shall smell sweeter in the nostrils of
their offended Lordships; or, better still, what
precautionary measures can be resorted to in
order to prevent for the future similar unplea-
sant introductions?
Negative Proof.
It is said by the first of critics that a Great
Poet is discerned in his knowing when not to
write. It is said of Louis NApoleoN, by his
admirers, that he is a perfect master of the art
of fortification. He evidently knows when to
let a fortification alone.
Tº
COMPANION TO THE HYMENEAL ALTAR.
THE aristocracy, and other persons of good taste and high refine-
ment, are apprised by the subjoined announcement of a means by
which they may pay an elegant compliment to persons about to merit,
or who may have just merited, that delicate attention:—
“AN APPROPRIATE WEDDING GIFT,
In square 16mo, price 7s.6d., elegantly bound,
THE MARRIAGE SERVICE,
Printed in Gold on a tinted cardboard, and Illustrated with emblematical
- designs on every page.”
This truly interesting and exquisite novelty offers an opportunity of
eligible investment to those industrious and enterprising young gentle-
men who hawk the penny papers about the streets, and introduce
their heads into omnibuses, with cries of “Daily Telegraph " or
“Hevening Statºr/". If they would lay in a stock of the resplendent
edition of the Marriage Service above described, and, posting them-
selves every morning at the doors of St.George's, Hanover Square,
thrust a copy into every carriage containing ladies crowned with
orange-flowers, and gentlemen with white satin bows in their button-
holes, they would ºft immense numbers of that Pºiº wedding-
gift, perhaps without much danger of getting their heads punched for
impertinence by the bridegroom’s “best man.” On the contrary, it is
probable that the graceful act would be rewarded with many a sunny
smile bestowed on the gallant urchin, and accompanied with the sym-
pathetic greeting, “Welcome, little stranger | *
The Marriage Service, illustrated with doves probably, and Cupids,
and printed in gold letters on tinted paper, is a step in advance | the
silver twist which unites the fashionable couple, represented by their
respective pasteboards, in an envelope enclosed to their friends. So
#. lace excels silver lace, and the Marriage Service akin to the
ormer would be a suitable, companion to... that. Altar which persons

MR. PUNCH, writing nobly himself, can afford to enjoy noble writing
by others, and so far from possessing any of that meanness of spirit
which leads some folks to detract from the merits of their rivals, he
delights to bring forward with honour and glory anything that deserves
applause. In that beautiful spirit, he extracts from the Leicester
uardian the following exquisite account of a fête in Bradgate Park,
good-naturedly lent for the purpose by the EARL OF STAMFORD AND
WARRINGTON:—
“The day was the Queen of Summer's fairest, not a cloud obscured the sky,
whilst a refreshing breeze gently wafted through the studded slopes and glens, and
as the happy gatherings, exuberant with mirth in the plenitude of their gambols,
their innocent pastimes and recreations, luxuriated well-nigh to satioty, their cup
of joy was filled to overflowing by the soul-stirring strains of the band, which con-
tinuously poured forth from the venerable ruins with magic grandeur and sublimity.”
Isn't it suceet 2
The same lofty and lovely style is preserved in personal narrative,
for we are next apprised that—
“The Countess of STAMFord AND WARRINGton, who, with the Noble Earl, was
engaged in piscatorial pursuits throughout the day, kindly forwarded to MR. H.
Nicholson, the handsome sum of £25,”
which was very kind of her Ladyship. It would have been vulgar
when a Countess was being spoken of, to say that she was fishing; and
Mr. Punch makes his best compliments to the Editor of the Leicester
Guardian, and congratulates him upon the charming contributor whose
services he is happy enough to have at command. , Our friend the

A REAL SCOTCH ROMANCE.
HE fact that oatmeal
is extremely fatten-
ing for ducks, may
rowth of this fine
cotch canard, which
appeared the other
day in the Glasgow
Bulletin:—
** GARIBALDI A
SCOTSMAN.
“SIR.—Reing allowed
two days' recreation last
week, I bent my way to
the banks of the A -
to enjoy a day's fishing.
In my rambles I neared
Greenloaning, where I
met an old man—by
name, JAMEs ANDERSON,
pensioner, late of the
42nd Highlanders—and a
most intelligent old man
I found him to be. After
the weather, the next
great topic of the day
was the war. I had
bºught a copy of your
paper at the Bridge in
the morning, which I
gave him. He said, as
most others do, that
GARIBALDI was the hero
of this war; and, with
laughing face, exclaimed,
\ ‘Faith, we may be proud
of him; I kent his faither
and grandfaither baith."
Of course I questioned
him about him, when he
related the following:-
“‘His grandfaither,
auld JAMEs GARRow, was
a shoemaker at the auld
brig o'Stirling, who often
mended my shoes, and his son—BALDIE—listed in our regiment, was present at mony a hard battle along wi'
mys if, got a severe wound at Toulouse, and, under the care of a pretty Italian girl, a servant in a noble
family, f 't quite lecovered of the bullet wound, but not so easy of the wound made by her dark eyes. In
short, they were married, and had one child. E'er I left France, he went along with the family to Italy.
They could never call him BALDIE GARRow, but GARIBALDIE, and his son, I am certain, is the present great
commander."
“On my return to Stirling in the evening, I made strict inquiry, and find there are still a great many
families of the name of GARRow: and an old man of the name of DANIEL KARR recollects the same BALuis
having enlisted in the gallant Forty-Twa. Delighted with my success, I determined to communicate to you
as soon as I returned, in the hope that your giving publicity to the foregoing, may elicit something more
concerning this mystery.
“I am, &c.,
“25, Hill Street, Glasgow, June, 1859.” “John SINCLAIR."
There, young ladies! isn't that a nice romantic story? and how clinchingly it proves that
in the quality of strangeness fiction falls far, short of being, comparable with fact! The
mending of the shoes by the venerable “auld grandfaither;” the 'listing of the fiery and
frolicsome young BALDIE, who, not content, to step in his aged parent's shoes, aspired in
his soul to higher things than soleing; the “mony” battles BALpie fought; his wounds by
black eyes º by bullets; his nursing, love, and marriage; and the birth and boy-behaviour
of his first and only chy-ild, who grew up like Aºi and became a “great com-
mander;”—what novelist could hope to | up his three volumes with a string of more
exciting incidents than these? How sad it is to think, that there are brutal-minded readers
who unfeelingly would question the truth of the narration; who would prick up their sharp
ears at the first words of the story-teller, and very likely pencil a curt ...' the margin,
as to whether the word “faith !” is a Scottish exclamation, and whether all that follows be
not similarly false.
... For ourselves, so far from †. any doubt upon the statement, we believe that, in reality,
it falls short of the facts... We believe that its narrator, had he further taxed his memory,
might have remembered that, while serving with the “gallant Forty-twa,” he “kent” the
forty-second cousin of GENERAL Gyul A1, whose name by those of his relations who could
write was written “GILLIE ;” whose birthplace was the “Hielands,” and whose Court dress
was the kilt. Had he further stretched his memory, he might have also recollected that
GENERA, MAGMAHON was a hero of Scotch parentage, as, indeed, is plainly indicated by the
prefix “Mac;” and that the French hero, CANROBERT, was by family a Briton, having in his
infancy been christened “Robert CANN.”. So, too, we opine Hº, by a little further
stretch, the “intelligent old man” might have still further recollected that the soldier
BALDIE GARRow was so called from being bald; and that he inherited his baldness from his
“faither,” who was scalped by the Red Indians, when they fought at Bunker's Hill,
commanded by the Austrian—but then Yankee—GENERAL Schlick.
All, this, we repeat, might the old pensioner have stated, had his hearers only lent him
their long ears a little longer. We, who in our youth have turned believing aural organs
to the tales of Greenwich pensioners, can quite easily imagine what Scotch veterans could
tell us. The keen air of the north is sharpening to the wits, and invention comes to aid
when memory is failing. Had MR. ANDERson been treated to a sup or two of “whusky”
he might have made up something stronger than this tale of his about the mother of
GARIBALDI, which our readers will, we fear, consider as a mère's-nest.

MATRI MONIAL ALLIES.
E understand that Colonel the
HoN. Joseph BUGGINs, brother
of floºd Buggins, and Private
Secretary to the iſſure of Ål.
DERshott, is about to form a
matrimonial alliance with the
HoN. Miss BLOGG, daughter of
LoRD and LADY BUNHILL. A
matrimonial alliance will shortly
take place between the LADY
SUsANNAh DoRCAs PodgeRs,
youngest daughter of the EARL
of CARRAway, and MR. JACOB
BEAN, second son of MR. ABRA-
HAM BEAN and LADY SARAH
BEAN, of Strathfogie, N.B.”
Such, in essentials, which do
not include names, are the
terms of a recent announce-
ment in the Post, headed Ap-
Pºins Marriages in High
ife.”
Why are marriages in highlife
always called, in the language
of that superior state of existence, matrimonial alliances? Is it that they
are not, in fact, regular out-and-out . like the conjugal unions
of the inferior classes? Is high life so much of a heaven that there are
no such things as common coarse marriages in it * Does matrimonial
alliance mean an engagement which somewhat resembles matrimony,
but is by no means identical with that union? We know that when a
matrimonial alliance between persons of quality. is ratified at St.
George's, Hanover Square, the Marriage Service is read, every word
of it, in the vulgar tongue, out of the Common Prayer Book; although
dignity is usually imparted to the rite by the Bishop who generally
rforms it, assisted by a clergyman who is an Honourable as well as a
verend gent. Before the law, therefore, a matrimonial alliance and
a marriage are precisely the same thing. What, then, constitutes the
social difference between them?... If the matrimonial alliance is not a
complete marriage, in what particular is it less than a marriage?. In
the alliance, the hands of the high contracting parties are joined as hard
and fast as those of the lowest couple in the marriage. Are the matri-
monial allies of high life supposed to be distinguished from common
married people by the non-existence of union between their hearts?
A SONNET UPON A SCENT.
A LEARNièD Chemist writeth to the Times,
That Thames stink is innocuous—“mere ammonia,”
That neither sulphuret reeks from its slimes;
Nor carburet. Oh, had that Chemist only a
Iº upon Thames-brink, (as for my crimes
I have, ſ: to say), his brains were stonier,
Steeled to all tests, save that sure test which climbs
Into the nose, and I would bet a pony a-
-gainst science upon smell. Oh, let these rhymes,
At which I sweat, under my light Siphonia,
(A Templar—one whom London smoke begrimes,
And briefless prospects steep in melanconia—)
Proclaim (whate'er tests prove, howe'er Thwaites limes)
Thames-mud ain't smelling-salts—pace the Times.
BAWARIAN SMALL BEER.
WE are ashamed to say, that we have a namesake at Munich, if the
Paris correspondent of a contemporary is quite correct in making the
subjoined statement:—
“The Punch of Munich, in its last number, contains the following:—“Proud
Albion is rejoicing in its neutrality; the Thames becomes daily more fetid." The
readers of the Munich Punch think this very fine and witty.”
Mr. Punch is happy in the certainty that he has no readers, indeed,
no one reader, so profoundly stupid as the readers of Herr Punch, of
Munich. , Wherein, do the fineness and the facetiousness, of the
arallel between England's rejoicing in neutrality and, the daily
increase of the Thames in offensiveness, consist? As the weather
grew hotter, the stench of the river increased; but, whilst the war
proceeded, the neutrality of proud Albion remained the same. Our
neutrality may have been disagreeable and unpleasant to the sanguine
absolutists who expected the assistance of a free, people; but neutra-
lity is mild, and the Thames, like some, unwashed, reeking, beery,
smoky people, not far from the Iser, is full-flavoured.
HERO-WORSHIP AT ST. CLOUD.
To celebrate the return of the EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, crowned
with victory, Imperial service was celebrated on Tuesday evening last
week at the Palace of St. Cloud, where his MAJESTY in person received
the homage of his votaries, consisting of the Senators, Deputies, and
members of the Council of State, together with the grand officers of
state, and ladies of honour.
The celebrants were, M. TRoPLONG, the Count DE MoRNY, and
M. BARochE, Presidents, respectively, of the Senate, of the Legislative
; and of the Council of State. They wore gorgeous vestments of
the finest cloth embroidered with gold lace, in combination with plush
of inexpressible splendour, and the most brilliant pumps and buckles.
The imposing ceremony was commenced by M. TROPLONG, in pros-
trating himself thrice before the EMPEROR, repeating at each genu-
flexion the words, “Salam Aleikoum !” when the dignified assistants
responded, “Aleikoum Salam /* This done, the adoring servant
incensed his master; not, indeed, offending him by any excess of
adulation, but fumigating him by means of a thurible, or censer,
whence a grateful smoke ascended to a nose which had room enough
for some quantity.
Having again knelt, and embraced and passionately kissed the
EMPEROR's feet, TRoPLONG then proceeded to vindicate his name b
addressing his IMPERIAL MAJESTY with a glorification of a lengt
that allows us to quote only some of it. Thus began the sacrifice of
praise:–
“Sire.—If your Majesty, consulting only the superiority of your arms, had
allowed the war to continue, the general feeling in France, and perhaps in Europe,
is that nothing would have delayed your irresistible march, and that Magenta and
Solferino would have been followed by new triumphs. Why, then, did the EMPERott
resolve to stop at the height of fortune 7 -
“Your Majesty has told us.”
At these emphatic words, the congregation lifted º their eyes and
smote their breasts: some wept. They comprehended that if the
EMPEROR had not vouchsafed to reveal his gracious purpose, it would
have been inscrutable.
M. Troplong then proceeded to tell his IMPERIAL MAJESTY what it
was that his IMPERIAL MAJESTY had told his creatures,-exactly as an
Archbishop sometimes does in a similar composition. He then burst
into the following strain of panegyric:—
“Sire, France has understood this noble language: she has recognised in it your
devotedness to her, as well as your elevated foresight in the presence of unjust
{..., and, of the extravagant pretensions of revolutionary passions. After
ving followed you with pride to the field of battle, she admires and sanctions you
in that heroic moderation which belongs only to great characters.”
Not any nausea being manifested by him to whom this homage was
rendered, the sacrificator proceeded, carried away by his enthusiasm,
which, assuming a classical character, rapt him into antiquity, with
reference to Scipio and HANNIBAL. He concluded by performing a
symbolical ceremony, which consisted in presenting Louis NAPOLEON
with a plate of bacon cut preternaturally fat.
De MoRNY, kneeling, with clasped hands, burst out in the following
devout exclamation:—
“Sire,—In three months how many prodigies have been witnessed I"
He then went on to relate, the marvellous works of the Victor of
Magenta and Solferino, and the hero of a fight yet more tremendous;
saying:—
“But the noblest of all victories is that which you have gained over yourself.
In the intoxication of triumph, you have shown yourself a generous enemy as well

M. BARoche, with truly religious earnestness, pronounced the
following benediction:—
“Blessed be God, who brings you back safe, covered with fresh glory, to France, of
which you are the saviour and the hope, between this august Consort, of whose firm
courage and lofty reason we have had proofs during your absence, and this noble
child, who already learns to thank Heaven for the triumphs of his father."
So saying, the Minister knelt and reverently, tendered to , the
EMPERon a packet of soap composed of the purest glycerine; whilst
his two companions, in the same humble posture, laid each of them
hold of an Imperial leg, and began vigorously to clean the boot
thereof, by means of a towel moistened with rose-water, earnestly
declaring what pleasure they should have felt, had not the boots con:
sisted of patent leather, in giving them a splendid polish with the most
refulgent blacking. The solemnities concluded with a sacred dance,
executed by the ladies and gentlemen of honour bright.

WHAT WE ARE INDEBTED TO THE FRENCH EMPEROR.
THE entente cordiale has been maintained at an expense of thirteen
millions additionally of taxation every year. Eight millions of these
are spent on warlike armaments. This has been going on ever since
the beginning of the French Emperor's reign. In truth, Louis NAPO-
IEoN has been a very dear friend to England. The question is, if
friendship, like gold, may not be bought too dearly. The article ought
to be of the most precious value, and of the most refined description,
to command so ift a price. Is the entente cordiale worth purchasin
at that extravagant rate? and has John BULL grown such a ma
spendthrift in his epicurean tastes, as to be able to spend thirteen
millions every year in the mere outlay of “cordials” alone? We can
recollect the time, when the old fellow, spurned such effeminate
luxuries, and was all the healthier for it. The British Constitution does
not need the support of French cordials.
The LATEST MARVEL, IN THE NEST-BUILDING way.-A little

FUMUS GLORIA MUNDI.
IN a will case a few days ago, SIR CREsswell. CREsswell, remark-
ing on an allegation that one of a certain Lunatic's habits was to
smoke a good deal, is reported to have said:—
“I have a great objection to smoking, but certainly I should not carry my objec-
tion so far as to hold that it was evidence of insanity.”
Different, things are objectionable to different men. Mr. Punch
happens to be fond of his weed, but, if occasion arose, would probably
say this:—
|... “I have a great objection to lawyers, but certainly I should not carry my objec-
tion so far as to refuse to dine with a clever judge, like CREsswell, for instance, if
he asked me.”
. After this, it is only necessary for Mr. Punch to mention that he is
disengaged for Saturday fortnight.
On second thoughts, Mr. Punch supposes that SIRC. CREsswell, as
a Divorce Judge, said his say to please the female world, which looks
up to him with a certain fascinated admiration. Probably he had his
cigar-case in his pocket in the robing-room all the time.]
EMPERORS AT ODDS.
ON arriving before the walls of Verona, says Louis NAPOLEoN,
“I found before me Europe in arms, ready either to dispute our successes, or to
| aggravate our reverses.”
., FRANCIS-Joseph, on the contrary, declares that he found himself
likely to obtain less favourable terms from Europe in arms than those
which it was. Fº that Louis NAPQLEoN would dictate to him,
He was afraid that Europe in arms would aggravate his reverses, and
by no means dispute the successes of his adversary. It is to be hoped
that there is some mistake between the two Emperors, for at any rate
that which lies between their Imperial Majesties is not the truth. Is
it quite certain that they knew what they were about, or that they
know what they are about now, in making impracticable agreements
for the settlement of Italy? The most res .# and moderate con-
clusion to which we can come is, that one of these august personages
is a booby. May Titania haply awake, and find out Bottom *
A Double-Edged Motto.
THE Saloon. Omnibus Company (which may be compared to the
|Westminster Clock, inasmuch as everybody seems anxious—and no-
body able—to get it wound up) bears, on its vehicles, the motto “Jam
omnibus satis.” One of the facetious Counsel of the Bankruptcy Court
the other day expressed his hope that this motto, which he translated
|“enough for everybody”—might be found applicable by the creditors,
when the Company's assets came to be divided. We should prefer
to apply the motto to the unlucky, Shareholders, and to translate it,

heroic father never did. He has made an unsuccessful attack upon a

ALARMING EPIDEMIC-THE WHISTLEPHOBIA.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MR.PUNCH was condescending enough to explain to the world, last
week, how the Thames breezes drove him from town, after the Thurs-
day night's debate. In consequence of his absence the discussions on
Friday were entirely without interest. In the Lords there was some
unprofitable talk about the unprofitable peace, and something of the
same sort took place in the Commons. The latter, however, got to work,
and voted all the Army Estimates and a good many Civil Service ones,
and were informed that we shall soon have 300 Armstrong rifled cannon.
Mr. Punch passed four days on his back on his lovely lawn, readin
MR. Tº NNysox's new volume of poems, giving, of course, a day to ...;
of the four. (He may remark, en passant, that the Laureate’s Quadri.
lateral is a noble fortification of his fame). The number of cigars and
the quantity of iced liquids which, he imbibed during that happy hori-
zontalism are nobody's business but his own, Finally, he got so im:
bued with the Laureate’s beautiful work, that he would think and
talk of nothing else, addressed his children as Enid and Elaine, and
upon Mrs. Punch's caressing his manly beard, and suggesting an extra
cheque for some ridiculous purpose, responded–
." With all my heart, my pretty Vivien."
In this mood he returned to town on Monday night, in order to hear
the CHANGELLOR of THE ExchEQUER open his Budget, but the
exquisite Tennysonian music clung to his brain, and he actually com-
}. the following resumé of the speech, without being aware that he
ad turned it into poetry:—
GLADston E the good, GLADstone the eloquent,
GLADstoNE, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Rose in the chamber on the Moon's warm night,
And gave long talk to the perspiring throng,
The while the Thames stank like the very deuce,
Lime striving vainly with his tainted slime.
| And GLADSTONE, gravely smiling on them, said:
| “Sit still and gather honey. I presume
Before I state the expedients I design,
'Twere well I summarised the ºfºul
Of my Caucasian predecessor's work.
His estimate of what the year would bring
Was six three nine two ought, and three oughts more.
The tin accrued, however, in excess:
Six five, and four seven seven, and two eight four.
Expenditure was less than this last sum, |
And we’ve in hand £800,000.”
Then plaudit issued from the listening House,
But GLADstoNE gave a deprecating smile.
“Neither the stamp on cheques, nor the increase
In duty on Hibernia's ardent spirits
(Deem not I mean her sons, I mean her swizzle)
Has yet produced, so far as I can tell,
The sum DisBAELI supposed they would.
Who can know all things in this mundane world?
Touching those cheques, I find the man who draws
May hand his coloured slip across the counter,
Unstamped, and (if his balance will permit)
Receive the coin; *::: I shall stop,
And he who draws shall stamp: 'tis like he'll stamp,
And may be swear, if he have over-drawn
And the mild clerk declines to draw it mºld.
And smiling once again, or at his joke,
Or at the thought of what was coming next,
G1.ADSTONE proceeded. “Now, my estimate
Of next year's income thus do I announce. -
Six four, three four ought, and three oughts beside.
That is the sum the Country should produce
Up to the end of March approximating.
Sixty-four millions and about a third.
'Twere fine to clap an Income-Tax on that,
And fine the country fivepence in the }; -
A thought of genius, lent by godlike Punch.”
At that loved name they rose tumultuously,
Cheering and shouting, and, with peace restored,
The fluent speaker thus took up his tale.
“Now, hearken to the H. expenditure,
And if it is not heavy, I’ll be blowed;
Armies and Navies, and Gibraltar Cables
And the new work in China and Japan,
And nine-and-twenty millions on the Debt,
Are items that mount up, with other things,
And Nine and Sixty millions, (not to name
A fleabite of two hundred thousand Fº
We, that is I, and PALMERSTON, and Lewis
Ånd savage SoMERSET and courteous HERBERT,
And all the rest of us, propose to spend
Before the thirty-first of coming March;
Put that, my gentle hearers, in your pipes,
And, at your pleasant leisure, smoke the same.
“Now,” he continued, in his honey tone,
“This shows, you see, a gross deficiency.
When I say gross, I do not mean reproach,
But use a cant-word of commercial slang,
Because it sounds uncommon business-like.
And this deficiency subtraction's rule
Shows to amount, O friends, to Millions four
And Hundred Thousands, added, eight, six, seven.
Where shall we get that money, O my friends :
“Bear with me while with me I would bear you
Into reflection, for some moments' space. ..
Though space is not a cognate word with time,
And time—but that’s a thing we will not waste
Dissecting nicely every passing phrase,
When we should be P." for other frays
The thought whereof affrays the patriot mind.
This year I think we’ll call Exceptional.
We have a grand Armada, and besides
A noble army; both we’ve lately raised
For reasons understood of all of you.
If in six months, or twelve, things grow not Worse,
You all know what I mean, and worse means war)
'e may suppose that they will surely Better.
Therefore, I say, let’s pay our way at once,
And be prepared for what contingency
Fate hath in store—if war, we’ll want all cash
Then to be got; if peace, at twelvemonth's end
We’ll kick the 'Incºme Tax to Belzebub,
Lucifer, Moloch, and their President,
Friend of the President of Italy.”
Cheering from anti-Papal NEW DEGATE
Led louder cheering from the Liberal bench.
Then onward went the Homeric Chancellor.

“Do not, Obrethren, do not let us borrow,

No, as Virginius says, “No way but this’—
I FEAR we MUST AUGMENT THE INCOME-TAX.”
He would not note the shudder which went round,
But eager in his eloquence spoke on.
“There is a credit which the maltsters take
In paying duty—we’ll deny them that

Nor let i. maltworms wriggle out of sight,
But pay at sight, like any other folk.

He gave the blow, but ere they well could feel it,
Followed it up with one more cruel yet.
“I must have money now. I cannot wait.

I’ll charge the whole year's Fourpence, which I add,

Shall pay three halfpence only. I have done.
Let my Four Millions be at once made up,
I trust your loyalty and patriotism
And to herself that England will be true.”
“O Masters, do you love my tender Tax?”
This little exercise, having in some degree relieved Mr. Punch's
mind, he reverts to his usual but inimitable prose, and proceeds to
record that in the House of Lords on the above night, viz.:-
July 18. Monday, LoRD MALMESBURY found great fault with a
letter Lord John Russell had been writing to the Prussian govern-
ment, warning it against going to war. , Lord Wodehouse defended
his chief, and declared the despatch to be a precious deal better than
anything MALMESBURY had done; and NEWCASTLE and GRANVILLE, as
†: of LoRD JoHN's, cried out, “Of course it is l’” There is,
however, no of course in the matter, some of MALMESBURY's late
despatches having been very tidy, and JoHNNY being by no means a
Complete Letter Writer. The Commons, as has been said, had the
Budget; and not much was said beyond a general grumbling :
ance of the scheme, a reception which the polite and grateful
GLADston E called “generous.”
Tuesday. Sensible observations by divers Lords on the necessity of
our having telegraphic communication with all our QUEEN’s posses-
sions. GRANville mentioned that the Gibraltar wire would not be
laid until next year. The QUEEN recognises Hospodar Couza, of the
Principalities,<-a piece of information which is not so unimportant as
it may appear to the ignorant. The Public Health Bill had rather a
near squeak for it (sycophants of vestries canting against “centrali-
sation,” as if Bumbles were to be trusted when a sudden epidemic
comes), but was carried by 101 to 95. It is to arm Government with
powers in the event, of an emergency. A discussion as to how many
soldiers ought to be kept in India, was ended by its º
agreed that nobody could know. MR. FortsTER wanted Parliament to
ask the QUEEN to assemble it in the winter instead of the summer, but
F%
LoRD PALMERSTON got almost into earnest in protesting. against such
interference with shooting and Christmas, and by 121 to 48 the notion
was scouted. MR. BAINEs failed in convincing the Home SECRETARY
that everybody ought to be allowed to print the State version of the
Holy Scriptures; and considering the extreme beauty, accuracy, and
cheapness of the innumerable editions of The Book, .#the importance,
while a particular version is authorised, of preserving exact uniformity
of text, MR. BAINEs’s grievance may be pronounced visionary.
Wednesday. Acertain Scottish Kirk-rate received considerable damage.
A. Weights and Measures Bill was read a second time; it is to do away
with local bushels, and establish imperial dittoes. MR. CowPER with:
drew his Bill against the hideous Hyde Park Corner lamp, but promised

making a great speech in his own honour, and proposing that the new

candid manner that MR, DISRAELI knew nothing about anything.
MR. BRIGHT abused everybody, especially the Press, in a Peace speech;

against the newspapers saying that our enormous armaments were to

ference, upon the notorious fact that every child in #. is regu-

will not admit this, and not only insist upon grants in aid of schools,
but allege that there are parents who neglect to send their children to
them, and ought to be punished for that wrong to society. Unhappily,
too, that #. notion is gaining ground; and it was only the
other day that three parents, earning large wages, were wickedly com-
pelled to fulfil promises to pay something towards the support of their

and child. Such noble patriots shall never lack any recognition
Mr. Punch can make of their worthiness.
LITERATURE FOR LADIES.
ALTHOUGH, in common with all editors, we are supposed to be pos-
sessed of almost universal knowledge, we are at a loss to know who
wrote the following advertisement, which was conspicuously printed
in the Times of Thursday week. Clearly it could never have been
*:::::: by a gentleman, and as certainly, we think, no lady could have
penned it :-
O AMATEUR LITERARY LADIES.–Females of good education,
are invited to JOIN A COMPOSITION SOCIETY. No remuneration offered,
and no expense incurred. Address -
Attractive as the first four words of this advertisement * be, we
think their influence must be greatly weakened by the fifth. It is all
very well to say that no expense will be incurred; but no well edu-
cated lady would accept an invitation to appear in a Society, at the
cost upon her entrance of being called a “female.” From the know-
ledge of her dictionary which her “good education”, would probably
have given her, she would know that the word “female” is no synonym.
for “lady.” The term “lady” is applied exclusively to women, and
it is not every woman who has properly a claim to it. The word
“female”. may, however, be applied to other animals; and to call
women “females” is to speak of them as part of the inferior brute
creation. Fine ladies think it vulgar to be spoken of as “women:”
but they had better be called this than bear a synonym with, “crea-
tures,” and have a word applied to them which perhaps may leave it
doubtful if they be not even cats.

52 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FRANCIS.JOSEPH THE GREEN.
HoPE º to have told the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA a flattering
tale. In his late manifesto, that Imperial young man, after having
expressed himself as “ bitterly deceived” in his “well-founded hopes”
that—the late contest not having been entered into for the defence of
the rights of Austria only—he was not going to be “left alone in it,”
proceeds to say:—
“In spite of the ardent sympathy, worthy of acknowledgment, which the justice
of our cause has inspired, for the most º in the journals and peoples of Germany,
our national allies, our most ancient allies, have obstiuately refused to recognise the
great importance of the grand question of the day. Consequently Austria would
have been obliged all alone to face the events which were being prepared for, and
which every day might have rendered more grave.”
He seems really to have imagined that not only Prussia, but even
England also, would take up arms, and actually lay down money, to
support his cause, that cause being, in addition to the Austrian des-
potism, the papal tyranny. He fancied that we, even we, would be
sure to fight for that crown in which the brightest jewel is the Con-
cordat-black diamond What can he have been thinking of, what
can he have been dreaming of P. Has he not heard the British Lion,
any time these seven years, roaring “No Popery”?—has he not seen
the writing on the wall? Alas, no! Civilisation has yet to chalk
* No Popéry” on the walls of Vienna. Will Europe have peace till
it is inscribed on those of the Vatican?
This imperial youth is a remarkably ingenuous one. Witness the
following passage from the document above º A confession
more artless was never made by a penitent schoolboy:—
"The honour of Austria coming intact out of this war, thanks to the heroic efforts
of her valiant army, I have resolved, yielding to political considerations, to make
a sacrifice for the re-establishment of peace, and to accept the preliminaries which
ought to lead to its conclusion: for I have acquired the conviction that I should
obtain, in any event, conditions less unfavourable in coming to a direct under-
standing with the EMPERoR of THE FRENch, without the blending of any third
party whatsºever, than in causing to participate in the negotiations the three great
powers which have taken no part in the struggle.”
Experience has instructed the juvenile ruler. He has acquired the
conviction—perhaps it has been beaten into him—that he would gain

better terms for himself and his Concordat, from Louis NAPOLEON,
who wears, or fears that he wears, his crown partly by favour of
Roman Catholic priests, than any that he could expect from Russia,
Prussia, and England; powers which agree in disowning the Pope:
the last-named one of them considering him spiritually a humbug and
temporally a tyrant, and wishing that everybody would renounce his
authority altogether, or that he would go to Jericho.
However, the EMPEROR of Austria has at last found out the
mistake which he had the wonderful greenness to make-under the
misguidance probably of Jesuits, who were older and ought to have
known better. He may get wiser as he gets bigger—unfinished,
; at present, in the upper storey., Some sign of amendment in
im may be spicq in the resolution, which his manifesto declares him
to have formed, to improve the shining hour of peace by devoting all
his attention and solicitude to a certain “fruitful task” which he
proposes to accomplish:-
“That is to say, to found in a durable manner the internal well-being, and the
external power of Austria by the happy development of her moral and material
forces, and by ameliorations conformable to the spirit of the time.”
Ah—that’s something likel as the Hampshire agriculturist, at a
public dinner said, when he had P. sugar into his Hock. Ameliora-
tions conformable to the spirit of the time?, Representative institu;
tions—ecclesiastical tribunals ignored by law—perhaps a Court of
Probate and Divorce established, together with some approach to the
liberty of unlicensed printing. Then we shall get on. Then will
invigorated Austria flourish, and FRANCIs-Joseph the Green acquire
a name which Posterity will call Evergreen.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“A KEAN BANQUETEER” is informed that there really was a MR.
MACREADY who, some years ago, produced, both at Covent Garden
and Drury Lame, the plays of SHAKSPEARE and others, with every
necessary accessory of scenery and costume. MR. C. KEAN was not
born at the time, and therefore no reference was made to his once-
celebrated predecessor on the night of the “Banquet.”

THE SOLUTION OF ITALY.
YE Powers 1—ye Statesmen, o'erladen with cares,
The solution who seek of Italian affairs,
You have got the solution, to speak chemist-wise,
But the substances in it you can’t crystallise.
The solution is turbid—all waters are so
That are troubled—the Tiber, and, worse than the Po,
The Thames, that is making our Parliament sick,
So vile is its odour; its filth is so thick.
The Italian solution two bodies contains,
The Pope and the Kaiser, poor Italy's banes,
With a King in excess, whose oppressed º
}. Willo
le groans,
And a sort of sub-monarchs, the
ll thrones.
Some spirit there’s in it, whose presence is proved
By rising whenever the pressure’s removed;
| Inflammable spirit, like spirit of wine,
With King, Duke, Pope, aiser, that ne'er will combine.
Expose it to light; and that agent, there’s hope,
Will produce a precipitate—throw down the l'ope.
Then add a free acid, for that is the thing
Which will send to the bottom the Dukes and the King
Now shake up the liquor and carefully strain;
Collect on a filter the dregs that remain,
In a crucible put them, and roast, and reduce,
Reserving the extracts for show—if not use.
Then there’s your solution pellucid and clear;
Evaporate gently till crystals appear;
Allow them to form in the shape they like best:
And Italy's question will soon be at rest.
What would my Uncle say?

ASTONISHING A CONGREGATION.
The subject of the following º is not one which usually
comes under Mr. Punch's censorship, but, as CowPER says:-
“Laymen have leave to dance when Parsons play."
The other day, we read that:—
“There was a special choral service in Westminster Abbey, the sermon *::::
preached by the Rev. HENRY Darry, B.D., Prebendary of Salisbury, an
Chaplain to the House of Commons, in aid of the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts. The reverend gentleman astonished the congregation by
giving out a text which no one recognised as a passage of Scripture. The words
were, ‘We may, we must, we will,’ and he obtained them in the following manner:
"We may,' from the 3rd of Genesis, 2nd verse; “We must," from the 14th of Acts,
22nd verse; “We will, from the 24th of Joshua, 21st verse. The combination of
the three, formed, the text, from which he proceeded to argue that we may, we
must, and we will, evangelise the world.”
Now, “astonishing” a congregation is not, Mr. Punch humbly
submits, the exact object with, which a clergyman should ascend his
à..." It might be inconvenient, did our ministers take that view of
heir duty. . There is no saying to what lengths energetic parsons
might go. A young Boanerges might not be satisfied with a mild bit
of Mosaic work, like MR. DRURy’s, but might adopt some other
method of “astonishing” his flock. Suppose he blacked his face, and
said, “Ah, you see how black I am, but you don't see how black sin
is.”. Or suppose he fired off one of Messrs. DEANE's revolvin pistols
(loaded only with powder, of course) at the organ, and exclaimed, “This
is a revolver, and apropos of that, my beloved brethren, let us revolve
in our minds the meaning of the words which you will find in, &c.”
On the whole, we recommend our clergy to avoid illegitimate arts
of attraction, and to rely for effect upon eloquent and affectionate
expositions of the Truth., MR. DRURY himself is, a very excellent
minister, and will take our hint in good part, especially when we remind
him of another clergyman's story about the way in which he stopped
a chattering person who was stringing isolated texts of Scripture
together, after the fashion of certain “serious” talkers. Scandalised
at the use the quoter was making of the most solemn and pregnant
jº the worthy priest calmly said, “Suicide, you know, is recom-
mended in the Book.” The “astonished” talker was brought up very
short indeed, and stammered out something about a jest. “Certainl
it is, upon, your principle of quotation.” “Eh P What? Where
How?”. “Are we not told that “Judas departed, and went and
hanged himself?’” “Ye—es.” “Is it not also said, “Go thou and
do likewise?’” - -
Next time our excellent friend MR. DRURY proposes to astonish a
congregation, perhaps he will remember this narrative, and give them
a text without solution of continuity.
THE BEST AND THE WORST.
THE Papal States have generally been described as the worst govern-
ment in the world. MR. #. wyer would wish us to believe that they
were the very best. MR. Bowyer is a Papist, as his position of brass-
trumpeter to CARDINAL WISEMAN fully verifies; and his opinion on
such a subject as the Papacy must be as true as it is disinterested; but
we should like to know if the Roman government is to be looked upon
as the best in the world, what kind of government must the worst be?
If the government in the Papal States is so º..". we wish
the ministers who attempt to govern us, and do it so } would go
tº Rºjo, the sake of arming to do what Rome does. The English
would then be as happy as the Romans now are.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 25. Monday. LQRD LYNDHURST, at whom it had pleased MR.
BRIGHT to scoff, in reference to his Lordship's recommendation to
England to be armed, let fly at that respected Quaker, and caught him
what (if pugilistic terms be not out of place when one is alluding to so
pacific a personage) may be designated an extremely neat, one on, the
conk, in return for a sarcasm, “so pointed, so, keen, so bitter, and so
creditable to the talents and taste of MR. BRIGHT,” as the callin
LoRD LYNDHURST “an old #: His Lordship then demanded o
the DUKE or SoMERSET whether the French ships were not armed
with rifled cannon, and whether our own were or could be. SomeRSET
made one of his usual mild and affable replies—he had heard that the
French ships were, and he knew that our own were not, and wouldn't
be for ever so long, but he wasn't going to talk about the matter;
LoRD BROUGHAM made a good speech about his own grey hairs, and
Education, aud referred to the general opinion that the humbler classes
have better schools, in proportion to requirements, than the middle
class. This is natural, inasmuch while the schools for the former are
to a lº. extent under surveillance, anybody is free to set up a middle
class school, without any inquiry into his or her knowledge of what
should be taught or fitness to teach it. There was a nursery dialogue
of old days, and it will do again. One Deborah addressed her favourite
Donkey:-
“Says Dr.BoFAH, wherefore, since learning's the rage,
arrowbones, cherrystones, bundle'em jig,
Should not my dear Donkey teach children their page,
Come, set up a school, and be one of the age,
Of this wonderful, wonderful, wonderful age."
The Deborah-Donkey classical, commercial, , and , mathematical
establishments are very numerous, as will be found out by parents who
are trustful, LoRD BROUGHAM wanted the Committee of the Privy
Council to inspect middle-class schools, and the Bishop of LINcoLN,
formerly a first class Preceptor, known at Islington as MR. JAckson
strongly approved an inspection scheme, but LoRD GRAN VILLE, o
course, thought that the Committee had too much to do already, and
he suggested nothing else.
In the Commons, after a discussion whether we or the Colonies
ought to defend the latter, and an expression of opinion that they
ought to do something for themselves (certain localities of the kind, on
the other side of the Atlantic, defended themselves very well indeed,
once, upon a time), SIR DE LACY EVANs moved for a Commission to
j. into the condition of our national defences, but Government
ob º said that it should appoint one of its own, and would not

In our opinion, it has been maliciously put
forward to prove the cruelty of French surgeons in always trying worthless experiments on
animals, and is an absurd story that is only fit to be told to the horse-marines.
THE POPE AT HIS LITTLE GAME.
THE Pope is indulging in his little game
again. He threatens any one, who has the
impertinence to attack in any manner the tem-
poral power of the Roman Pontiff, with “a major
excommunication!” The threat is magnificent!
Victor EMMANUEL, when he heard of it, must
have fallen on his knees, and have humbly sued
for pardon. It is amusing, when real cannon-
balls were rattling about, to see the Pope pop-
W; off his little sacerdotal powder and shot.
e are afraid that all “the thunders of the
Vatican,” let them thunder ever so thunderingly
until every disbelieving Protestant is deafene
with the noise, will not avail much by the side of
NApoleon's new artillery, and that not all the
canons of the Church wiſbe able to do as much
execution as one of the recently-invented pieces
de précision. Of course, it falls to the duty of
these “canons of the Church” to keep up a
constant supply of the “thunders of the
Watican.”

not to do away with everything of the kind, but only to prevent such
things being brought without the sanction of a magistrate. In the
course of discussion of estimates, MR; GREGORY called attention to the
very small salaries paid to the gentlemen who have charge of the
various departments of the British Museum. Now, these officials are
none of your ignorant or crammed humbugs recommended by great
eople, but scholars thoroughly up to their work, who can tell you
}. a fragment of an egg-shell what bird it would have come to, can
translate, at sight, the inscription on a perfectly illegible coin, and can
see through the boards of a portfolio whether the print that is goin
to be offered them is valuable or rubbish. Yet these highly educate
entlemen can, by no possibility, attain to the amount of salary of a
eutenant-colonel on half-pay. . GREGoRY deserves the thanks of
all instructed persons for calling attention to the subject, and must
persevere. “GREGoRY, remember thy swashing blow.”
Tuesday. It seems that we are awfully cheated in gas, the vendors
having the means of sticking us up for pints, and quarts, and gallons,
and in fact what they like. It costs Five millions o money per annum.
So we are to have proper, measurement, and inspectors to see that
those horrid looking black things, like mysterious clocks, that the gas
people put up behind our doors, and occasionally come and peep into,
teli'heſtruth. But unless the bills sent in are inspected too, what’s
the use, for the shrewdest Materfamilias gives up at the gas account.
The Health Bill, we are happy to say, was read a third time, so we are
not quite de endent on Bumbledom, incase there should bean epidemic
from the Thames odours. The Bishop of LoNDoN wants more
churches, but LoRD, GRANyILLE does not seem to think it likely his
spiritual lordship will get them.
There was a capital bit of rich farce in the Commons. SIR John
TRELAwNEY’s Bill for doing away with Church Rates came to the
Committee stage, when MR.NEwideGATE, champion of the establish-
ment, said that he accepted the situation, and agreed to abolish Church
Rates, but proposed to levy for the support of the churches two-pence
a pound on all property that has paid church rate within seven years,
and this imposition was to be collected with county rate, and, if the
payer chose, it might be deducted from his rent. The House was so
extremely stupid that it could not see the difference between this and
a church rate, and rejected the plan by 191 to 99. Then the discussion
on church rates got curiously mixed up with one about bells, Members
complaining that they went out of the House to be beyond the reach
of arguments, on the understanding that they were to be rung for
when it was time to vote, and that upon several occasions the

dine comfortably. The opera was a brilliant success, and the Opera-
House did not rise till nearly one in the morning.
Hednesday. The Bill for regulating the County Courts in respect to
their power, of , imprisonment went through Committee. Many
instances of the abuses of this power were adduced, and it appears that
it is very much used by the rascally hawkers who entrap the ignorant
wives of labourers and others into purchasing trash withou] their
husbands' knowledge, and then come down on the latter with County
Court summonses. QRSTUART mentioned the case of a girl, who,
when a child of fourteen, had been induced to buy a shawl which she
could not pay for, and at nineteen was committed to gaol in respect of
the debt. The gallant Major did not mention the name of the judicial
ackass who had made the order. A Bill for getting rid of the
avelin men who are supposed necessary to sustain the dignity of the
Judge, when on assize, was lost by 115 to 112. , The learned persons
themselves think the attendance ridiculous enough, and like IDomeNEUs
and AENEAs (Iliad xiii.):—
“Around their heads unheeded javelins shine,”
but the country folks regard the business as imposing, and anything
that makes them think awfully of the Law may º, be preserved
with advantage.
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER could not get an address for inquiring into
the condition of Greenwich Hospital. The fact was, that on account
of the state of the river, Members were afraid of being sent down to
Greenwich; but their fears are idle. If they go by rail, and proceed
at once to MR. QUARTERMAINE’s, or MR. HART's, they may enjoy a
modest repast, without other inconvenience than having to pay for it,
and the whitebait is capital just now, º extremely apt to get into
your head unless you take great care to have the very best of Cham-
É. and Claret, and plenty of both. On a vote for the National
allery, MR. ConinghAM attacked SIR CHARLEs. EASTLAKE, against
whom the only thing seems to be, that he once bought a spurious
Holbein (very likely quite as good as the original), and had the man-
liness to own that he was wrong, instead of obstinately insisting that
the picture was genuine. The House would not allow a reduction of
the vote; nor was LoRD HADDo more successful, on occasion of his
wanting to reduce a vote to Schools of Art because undraped ladies
were among the models. He, like a good many other wiseacres, con-
founded the nude with the voluptuous, and intimated his belief that
the downfall of Athens dated from the introduction of naked figures
into her art. England and America must be in a bad way then, with
Ere at the Fountain and the Greek Slave, works of eminently demoral-
ising and sensual character. The son of
“The classic Thane, Athenian ABERDEEN,”
ought not to talk nonsense which might be expected from MR. Roch-
Ford CLARKE. However, he shares his faith with another worthy man,
even the Pope, who hates the nude (the Scarlet Lady is so intolerant
of immodesty) and has just let a wonderful Venus go to Russia for
next to nothing. - -
One LEATHAM and one SchENLEY, Esquires, were respectively
walked out of Wakefield and Dartmouth, by reason of the electors
having been bribed to return them. The same fate, later, overtook one
Monk and one PRICE, Esquires, up to Friday Members for Gloucester.
Thursday. The Lords went on, with the Bill for improving the
I)ivorce Act, and by 36 to 9 carried a clause allowing the Judges to
shut the court-doors ºf a case the details whereof should be
acceptable only to wicked old dowagers, and the patrons of Holywell
Street literature. The Press will do well to take the hint, and avoid
i. it indiscreet for Paterfamilias to leave his newspaper about the
Ouse.
In supply, Wiscount WILLIAMs indulged in a vulgar Lambeth sneer
at SIR §s BROOKE, but was rebuked by MR. Estcourt and MR.
MILNEs, the latter of whom said that RAJAH BRookE’s name would
live with that of SIR, WALTER RALEIGH, . At this old, WILLIAMs
hooted “a laugh,” and then inquired of his next neighbour “who
RAwley was.” SIR JAMEs is to be congratulated on haying such
enemies. Three election petitions were withdrawn, doubtless for
sufficing reasons—given. - -
The debate then assumed dignified proportions. It was felt that
something must be said about Foreign Affairs, but the difficulty was
that there was nothing to say. However, the Three Great Lights of
the Government, Russell, PALMERSTON, and GLADSTONE, managed
to shine out with considerable brilliancy. The question is, whether
England is to help in settling Italy, and the answer. is, that Italy is
so unsettled that there is no call for immediate action, and we must
wait and see how things go. LoRD John was happy to read in the
Moniteur that the armies and navies of France were to be put on
peace footing; but, his lordship is not now on his way to the Tower,
and the housemaid there is not dusting up, the Block. The public,
therefore, may be sure (Mr. Punch having been in the House) that
Lord J. DID Not ANNounce that ouh NATIONAL DEFENCEs welve
TO BE WEAKENED BY THE WITH DRAWAL OF ONE HALF-POUNDER OR
9NE DRUMMER-BQY.. There was some fencing about England's having
been the channel of conveying certain French terms of peace to
Austria, and PALMERSTON explained that Lord John had been
asked to send, the letter, but he objected to being any party to the
#. and hinted that the French Ambassador had better send it
himself, as the postage of even a double letter to Vienna was only
about one-and-fourpence. However, as France had spent a good deal
on the war, and money was an object, LoRD John had consented to
fºrward the document, but was in no way pledged to its contents.
He has also repudiated the allegation that he described the Treaty of
Villafranca as a just one; the reporter possibly having heard him say,
not that a just treaty had been made, but that a treaty had just been
made. (Ambulator.)
The Pope was a †: deal abused, and very properly; but he has
two advocates in the House, one being Bowyer, ARDINAL WISEMAN's
cross-bearer, who talked the ineffable nonsense that might have been
expected, and declared that the Pope's government was “progres-
sive,” in which, opinion Mr. Punch is very happy to concur with the
Grossbowyer, believing, also, that such progress is exactly in the
direction in which an equestrian mendicant is popularly said to
travel. , The other advocate was MR. MAGUIRE, who is an exceed-
ingly clever man, but the victim of so infatuated a personal affection
for the Pope, that if his H. was MR.M.'s own father, instead of being
merely his spiritual PAPA, the excellent, MAGUIRE could scarcely be
more attached to him. One cannot be hard upon such a sentiment
or be incensed that MR. M. should have apprised PALMERSTON and
RºssELL that when they were forgotten nobodies, the Papacy would
still flourish in glory; and that, in the mean time, LöRD J. was
“detested” and LQRD P. “abhorred” in Italy. To all the assertions
of the goodness of the Pope's government, our own had the quiet
retort, “Why, then, are thousands of bayonets necessary to preserve
the Infallible Man from the vengeance of his happy and loving
people?” The debate had, as hath been said, dignity, ºt no result.
Friday. DR. TAITE º to legislative shortening of the Church
Services, but said that the Bishops could do it.
The Commons went on with the Income-Tax Bill. MR. W. Scully,
who recently made such a pitiable exhibition of himself on the subject
of the appointment of Irishmen (as such) to office, that Mr. Punch, in
mercy to such wretched helplessness, would not allude to the circum-
stance, announced that he should renew the tomfoolery. Mr. Punch
hereby places at the service of Scully's friends a presentation to the
Asylum for Idiots. There was a National Defences debate, in the
course of which MR. CoBDEN politely alluded to Mr. Punch's Great Cut
of last week, as evidence that John Bull, was uneasy in regard to
France. MR. Cobden thinks that reliance should be placed on royal
words. Elsewhere than in the House it is said, “Put not your trust
in Princes,” but may difference of opinion never alter friendship.
LoRD PALMERSTON intimated, that what a foreign nation might do in
the way of disarmament was nothing to us: our business was to be
properly Defended. Wire PAM!
A FIDGETY SUBJECT.
MR. DRUMMOND was kind enough to tell us, in connection with the
Italian subject, with which it had so much to do, that—
“There were fidgets on all subjects. There were private fidgets, county fidgets,
and political fidgets, and there was on the part of many people a desire to do what
sailors called ‘shove in their oar where there was no water.’”
Could not MR. DRUMMOND have elongated his catalogue of fidgets?
Are there not the fidgets of the wife who is sitting up for her husband,
the fidgets of the adventurer who is waiting for dead men's shoes; the
fidgets of the maid-of all-work who is lon # for “her day out” to
come round again; the fidgets on the part of ULYSSEs, who is becalme
off Kurrachee, for his dear wife, PENELoPE, who is fidgeting her life
out in Mornington Crescent for his return home; and a thousand other
fidgets, far too fidgety for the reader's patience to mention? , And
lastly, are there not the fidgets of the hon. Member, who is always
trying to achieve popularity by eccentricity, and cannot succeed in doing

shallow subjects that will not hold water P Is MR. DRUMMOND ever
visited by such fidgets, and is the House ever fidgeted in having to
listen to his vain efforts?

FOREIGNERS IN BAD ODOUR.
The smell of the Thames is bad enough, Gog knows; but there are
other smells in London which are even more offensive. For instance,
in the Lambeth Police Court t'other day, the attention of the Magis.
trate was directed to an odour, which no odour de Cologne could
obliterate or equal. According to the Times' report of the proceedings—
“MR. MARSDEN, the Westry Clerk of the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, accom-
panied by some members of the Vestry and several respectable inhabitants, attended
at this Court for the purpose of supporting a summons nst some foreigners who
are the occupiers of premises situate at the rear of Wellington Place, Southampton
Btreet, Canberwell used for the melting of fat, and which business, in the process
of manufacture, causes an effluvium which, as it had been represented to the Westry,
; º ...” nuisance, and dangerous to the health of the inhabitants of the º:
urno
“MR MARsoºn stated, that from the representations made to the Vestry, it
appeared that the premises in question were made use of by a company of foreigners
for the purpose of melting fat, a portion of which was º in casks and shipped
off for Holland, for the purpose of being mixed up with butter, and, after the mix-
ture took place, was re-shipped back to London as pure Dutch butter. (Laughter.)"
... What there is in this to laugh at we are puzzled to conjecture. It
is our avocation to be judges of a joke, but we can see no fun in mixing
stinking fat with butter, especially when we ourselves may chance to
be consumers of it. Such a joke as this we consider to be no joke,
and those who laugh at it may do so on the wrong side of their mouths.
As for eating Dutch butter cfter what we hiº. learned of it, we
can only say, that if we do we're Dutchmen.
That we are justified in using the epithet we have done, to describe
the nasal properties of the fat which is in question, the evidence which
follows will suffice, we think, to show :—
“The first witness called to prove the fact was Mrs. Ganarrr, a widow lady,
who said she lived about 40 yards from the premises, who described the Inuisance,
and said that for the last three months she had not had the doctor out of her house.
Her children were all ill, and she suffered himself from sicknees and nausea, and all
F. by the gross nuisanco on the premies complained of. The smell resembled

and remove the nuisance, the witness pnd her "...º. leave the neigh

“Ma. BRIsTowr, the medical officer of health fort
• parish, said he had frequently
visited the premises, and that the business carried on there was a gross nuisance,
and very injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.
“MR. Harris, the ground landlord of the premises in question, and other owners
of house property in the neighbourhood, said that a number of their tenants thad
given them notice, and they were quite certain they should not have a tenant left
unless the nuisance were removed.
Strong testimony this that the smell was also ditto., Noses however
differ, as much perhaps as tastes; and a nuisance, which offends the
sense of other people, may in the nostrils of its maker be the sweetest
nasal diet. In proof of this we find that—
“A person with an enormous beard, and with a º
Magistrate that the fat melted was all fresh, and could not
described."
The effect of this assurance was, we think, a doubtful policy:—
“The Magistrate considered it would be a serious proceeding to shut up the
place and put an end to the defendants' trade and business at once, and therefore
adjourned the sumulons for a week to see if the nuisance could not be remedied.”
accent, assured the
such a nuisance as
Shutting up a nuisance-shop may be a “serious proceeding,” but it
is surely not more serious than causing injury to health, and sickening
whole families who are neighbours to the nuisance. Putrid meat this
weather soon induces putrid fever; and although a week is no long
while to wait, it may take a lifetime to cure the ill effects of it. We
think that had the Magistrate thought twice about the matter, he
would, as second thoughts are best, have ordered that the nuisance-
shop should be at once shut up, and that the trials made to “remedy”
it should be attempted off the premises. The remedy is often as bad
as the disease, and when experiments are made to “improve” a putrid
smell, we should certainly ourselves prefer keeping out of nose-shot.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VISION OF VAUXHALL.
CoMRADEs, you may leave me sitting in the mouldy arbour here,
With the chicken-bones before me and the empty punch-bowl near.
“Rack” they called the Punch that in it fiercely fumed, and freely
owed :
By the pains that rack my temples, sure the name was well bestowed.
Leave me, comrades, to my musings, 'mid the mildewed timber-damps,
While from sooty branches round me splutter out the stinking lamps.
While through rent and rotten canvas sighs the bone-mill laden breeze;
And the drip-damp statues glimmer through the gaunt and ghastly trees.
And the seedy stucco crumbles from the orchestra hard by;
And the firework-frames like gibbets rear their arms athwart the sky.
And the monster platform stretches blank and bare beneath the moon;
And the night-wind through the boxes wanders with an eery croon.
Let me sit and sadly ponder o'er the glories of Vauxhall;
Sink this mouldy mildewed Present; from its grave the Past recal.
Is’t the Punch that stirs my fancy—or the

Dimly, as through clouds a steaming from a thousand fragrant bowls,
Periwigged, pulvilio-scented, CHARLEs THE SEconD's revel rolls.

In gay doublet, trimmed and broidered, ribboned shoulder, ribboned

BROUNcKER rants, and NEWPORT roysters, while SAM PEPys stands
by to see—
Sounds the nightingale's sweet twitter from the green trees overhead;
..Shrieks below the City Madam with Court gallants sore bestead.
Hark, 'tis pretty MRs. MERCER, trolling out ToM D'URFEy’s song:
Hark, to CASTLEMAINE’s loud laughter–brazen'st of the brazen throng.
Saucy JENNINGs with Count GRAMMGNT bandying the motpour rire;
NELL Gwyn NE fondling handsome SIDNEY, spite of Buckhurst
frowning near.
CHARLEs himself, his black face hidden in a vizor blacker still,
Laughing, ogling, and oddsfishing, light of wit, and loose of will.
See the cheesecake.blithely, broken, and the syllabubs afoam;
Hark at Thames, alive with boat-loads, for Spring Gardens, or for home.
Drugget-aproned drawers bearing Claret and Canary-pottles,
For wild wits and bona-robas to refresh their thirsty throttles:
And through all, sly, smug SAM PEPys, with a twinkle in his eye,
Taking careful note for entry in his Diary, by-and-by.
Thicker rise the fumes, and faster, but less furious streams the rout,
As QUEEN ANNE’s decorous following bows the Merry Monarch's out.
See the long, thin faced Spectator, elbowing his silent way
For SLR RogeB, close behind him, open-mouthed, and eyes astray;
Rapt in wonder at the music, and the movement, and the sights;
Elbowed by the vizored Madams, dazzled by the thousand lights.
This way swaggers STEEL, half tipsy, but still kindly in his drink;
There good-humoured little GAY, to iodse MXT Prior tips the wink.
Swift stalks, rolling indignation in his blazing deep blue eye;
St. John laughs off state blue-devils with LoRD Oxford smooth and sly.
They have passed and now the GEORGEs usher in a duller race.
Blank the scene, till sudden lighted by the look of WALPole's face.
There he sits—the wizened watcher—cynical and calm and cool,
Ready to note others' follies, or is...} to play the fool.
There the PETERshAM sits blazing with her rouge and saucy stare;
There the crowd applauds the GUNNINGs—fairest sisters of the fair.
Here trots Bozzy all in triumph with the Doctor on his arm;
While, not less triumphant, GoLDY guards “the Jessamy bride” from
arin.
Pass, familiar shadows, trooping to the Land of Long-ago;
Let the Regency's hot orgies set more brimming bowls aflow.
Room for rampant Colon EL HANGER! Bloods and bucks of Carlton
ouse,
Box the watch, and smash the tables, shiverglass, and wax-lights douse.
Room for PRINCE HAL redivirus—petticoats and pimps and all–
Down before that wig so curly and that coat so creaseless, fall!
Room for AEMACK's maccaronis-room for BRooks's playmen true,
MARCH and SELWYN, Fox and CARLISLE,-set the punch bowls blazing
blue !
Masquerade and gay Ridotto blend the cream and scum of town;
Statesman's toils, and senate's glories, with Soho's endearments crown.
While o'erhead the ghost of SIMPson lifts the ceremonial hat,
In deportment but inferior unto GEORGE the Great (by fat).
With such phantoms for evoking, shall I summon sorrier shades?
Ghosts of gentish generations,—stray of shops and waif of trades?
Shadows of cheap shilling fº. flickerings of a dying flame;
Straws by desperate speculation clutched at, in its drowning game?
No Tamid these wretched ruins, trees all black and walks all green—
Be the ghosts of my evoking such as graced the ancient scene.
Be they ghosts girt with a glory, somewhat sulphurous though it be;
Ghosts of the Vauxhall that hath been—not of the Vauxhall we see.

rule, for the passengers on the silent highway of London, improperly

A TERRIBLE STATE OF THINGs.
We have it on the assurance of MR. MAGUIRE (a distinguished
brazen player in the Pope's Brass Brigade), that the name of the
hon. Member for the City of London is “detested” amongst all
Italians, whilst that of the Noble Lord the Member for Tiverton is
“utterly abhorred.” We wonder how Lords John and PAM, have so
long survived this horrible affliction. Isn't it a marvel how PALMERs-
ToN can, under the painful circumstances, be as jolly and jaunty as he
is ? How can he have lived to the fine old age, and have retained his
senses, in the happy way that he has done?"Can he ssibly be
indifferent to the º: of Italian hatred P And does LoRD John,
sublimated also by a like indifference, sº aS :"... though
Rome existed no more than Carthage? e should advise them, if
they have any respect left for the Pope, to offer up candles, and have
masses said for their souls, at that pretty fancy bazaar of a chapel that
has lately been opened, with such, º and Popery, in, Margaret
Street, avendish Square; and which, in our eyes, is nothing more
than "a House of Call for 'Romans.”

CHARIVARI.
|August 6, 1859.
Clerical Magnate, who has strayed a little from the right path. “My dear child, can
you inform me whether this is a public way?"
Child. “No, Sir; but come along o' me, and I'll show you the way to the Blue Lion."
[His Reverence's horror may be more easily imagined than described.
“IT'S A MAD WORLD, MY MASTERS 1"
THE second column of the Times grows daily more
amusing. The following appeared in it on the 26th:—
To I. W. §ſ. mind the place]. All your DISTRACT.
ED RELATIONS implore you to RETURN. A letter lies for
you at the [Blank] Bank. Pray, if you value your own happiness, get
it at once.
If we know anything of human nature, we should say
that the effect of this appeal upon I. W. would be to
greatly strengthen his rº. to keep away. The notion
that a man would be tempted to return by the knowledge
that some maniacs were in waiting to receive him, seems to
our mind so insane that no one but a lunatic could ever
entertain it. Were we blessed (or otherwise) with a lot
of mad relations, we certainly should try, unless we thought
that we could cure them, to go and live as far away from
them as possible. No good could come of contact, and
possibly harm might.
As for the letter which awaits him at the Bank, we
should say that I. W. would be wise not to call for it.
Presuming from the context that this letter has been
written by his lunatic relations, we would wager any
money it would not repay perusal. So many madmen daily
put their nonsense in our letter-box, that we may fairly
claim some knowledge of “distracted” correspondents,
and our experience goes to prove that what they write
is not worth reading. Indeed the maniacal effusions with
which we daily are afflicted would be enough to madden
the robustest intellect, were it not that, as an antidote
Punch is ever close at hand, and Punch has ever proved

penny, per pair. The CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer
would finger a nice sum every year, and not a soul would
be pinched by it.
THE ENCORE SWINDLE.
ExcELLENTLY well done, MR. SIMs REEves. Remarkably well
done, MR. SIMs REEVEs. You have Mr. Punch's plaudits, the least
whereof will in your opinion outweigh the opinion of a whole Surrey
Hall of groundlings, MR. SIMs Reeves.
So there was a great crowd in that, Surrey Hall, to hear Miss
Dolby, and MADAME Bishop, and yourself and others, and the lovers
of music permitted themselves to go on as follows :-
“The first piece set down for MR. Sims REEvrs was Fra Poco, which he sung
with only too great effect. He left the orchestra amidst great applause, which, as
usual, was extended to a vociferous encore.”
That is to say, that having paid to hear you in one song, and being
leased with you, they endeavoured to obtain a second without paying
or it. . Well, you did not think proper to accede to the demand, and
the amiable audience got into a rage, and would not even listen to an
explanation. They “waxed furious,” according to the report, because
you would not be robbed. However, after a good deal of riot, they
condescended to listen to the explanation. It was—
“To the effect that MR. REEvrs, having to sing two other pieces, could not
repeat so trying an effort as that just made.”
This, REEyes, was a conciliatory explanation. The crowd had no
i. to ask it, but it being made, we certainly agree with the Reporter
that it
“Ought to have satisfied everybody. It did satisfy all but an excited minority,
who, in spite of overwhelming cries of encouragement to the conductor to proceed,
P. in hissing, groaning, and hooting. This disgraceful scene lasted about
ºf an hour, and was only terminated by the performance despite all demands to
the contrary—of the Wedding March, in Midsummer Night's Dream. The drunus,
trumpets and violins had fairly the best of it, and the Iroceedings were tranquil
enough till MR RErves made his second appearance. Wolleys of hisses, grºans.
and catcalls mingled with the vehement applause that saluted him. For some
minutes he took this unusual reception in good part, bowing and smiling at every
outburst of the popular humour as if it were unmixed flattery.”
Half an hour of blackguardism, vainly sought to be put down by the
decent portion of the auditory. We are happy, however, to read that
they were the majority, and even at the cost of prolonging the scene,
they gave battle:–
“But this sort of thing soon gets beyond a joke, and when it was evident that a
mischievous few, at various entrances of the tuilding, were determined MR. REEvrs
should not be heard, a contrary resolution was expressed with equal decision.
Deafening peals of cheering were kept up in order to intimidate the disturbers, but
still they held out. In vain the great singer tried the effect of his soothing art
upon the disturbers. They broke him down in the second verse of . When thou wilt
be my Bride'. In vain he bowed in his sweetest notes, "My breast doth incell with
pride." His offended admirers answered with implacable derision. Glenching his
music scroll, he exclaimed, “I am too much of an Englishman to be beaten l' and
coolly took a chair."
However, the majority was now, determined on having an end to
“this sort of thing,”, and in obedience to angry demands for the
expulsion of the offenders, the necessary steps were taken, and divers
blackguards were eliminated, receiving a smiling greeting from
MR. REEves as they were dragged away.
“Thus by degrees the tumult was subdued, the song was recommenced, and MR.
Rerves retired amid a tempest of unqualified applause. Half an hour later he sat
down to the piano to sing “My Pretty Jane'. The cheering that followed was im:
mense, but scarce a single voice ventured to ask a repetition . To the universal
surprise and delight, the exultant tenor came back and sang to his own accompani-
ment the “Baw of Biscay." Of course this completed his triumph, and MR. SIMs
REEves finally retired from the orchestra a greater favourite than ever."
All very well, and Mr. Punch, as has been said, is pleased to con-
gratulate MR. REEVEs very heartily on the pluck he exhibited. But
the scene arose, as many similar scenes have arisen, from the ignorance
of English persons as to the law of meum and tuum. No doubt that
amid that crowd of noisy, ill-bred fellows, there were some who sup-
posed that they had a perfect right to command the great artist before
them, or Miss Dolby, or AME BIshop, to give them as much
music as they chose to call for, º they had paid only for what
was set down in the bill. Now, if there were any such, and one of
them were a tailor, what would he say to Mr. Punch, who, having
bought a waistcoat of him, should insist upon having another for
nothing, because the first pleased him so * “But O,” comes in

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
the coarse and material mind, “that’s different. A waistcoat is a
thing—cloth, buttons, thread—a song’s only a noise.” Well, let us
concede that the tailor cannot understand us, and let us take a dentist.
Suppose he has pulled out a tooth so neatly for a guinea that Mr. Punch,
tient, insists on having a second pulled out without extra º
ome, if a song is only a noise, an extraction is only a pull. “But
that would be dishonest, he has been learning for years to pull out
teeth, then there are his name and reputation, and his time.” Granted,
and that Mr. Punch would be a swindler, in the case of the waistcoat
or of the tooth. What of the singer? Has he not been learning for
years to get out the high note that delights ou. Are his name and
reputation less valuable than the dentist's Is his time less valuable?
The fact is, painful as it is to declare it, that everybody who attempts
to enforce (mind, we don't say anything against a complimentary
request) a second performance of what has already been given, is a
person who is endeavouring to procure a valuable thing without paying
or intending to pay for it. The name the lawyers caiſ such a person
hath been given above. When this is thoroughly understood, and that
a “peremptory encore” means a forcible theft, we shall have no more
such disgraceful scenes as that at the Surrey Hali.
Meantime Mr. Punch appends, with much approbation, the following
passage from the excellent remarks of his contemporary, the Daily
Telegraph, upon the whole business:–
“Singers have too long been oppressed by the tyranny of encores and the almost
brutal exigence of musical audiences, and it is time that artists should make a bold
stand, and emancipate themselves from an intolerable thraldom. The ‘general
decree' ºf five thousand persons cannot be permitted to force a man to ruin the
finest voice that has been heard for years.”
If it were the most worthless, instead of the finest, the argument
would be just the same. No audience has a right to dictate in the
matter. If the singer chooses to oblige people with a repetition, well
and good; but if he declines, the audience ought to apologise for
having asked what was unreasonable.
and “generous benefactors,” are gone by, the artist is on a perfect
equality with his audience, and gives them the fruits of his, skill in
exchange for their money. Let him be on the best of friendly terms
with them, but let us have no sneaking submission on his
insolent patronage on theirs. And so, bravo and farewell,
REEVEs, and may the shadow of your moustache never be less.

MEDICINE AND MORALITY.
IN no other country is so much medicine drank as in England.
When the Teetotallers have put down the drinking of spirits, they
must direct their attention to the putting down of the enormous con.
sumption of medicine, and try to put that down; for, in our opinion,
the one habit is just as pernicious as the other, and in its nauseous
time has perhaps killed nearly as many. The drug-shop is almost as
destructive an agent as the public-house; and where you find the one,
you may be pretty sure that the other is not very far off. , A Medicine
Pledge is fearfully wanted. It seems that the duty paid on patent
medicines during the last year amounted to £43,090 14s. 1d. "Now,
the duty on every box of magic ointment, or vial of infallible elixir,
amounts, we believe, to three-halfpence, which sum will enable the
reader to calculate for himself the exact number of draughts and pills
that were consumed in patent medicines alone by the medicine-taking
community in the course of one year.
In strong contrast to the above, the sum remitted during the same
period to the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER, as “conscience-
money,” amounted to £3,015.9s. There seems to be a great deal of
medicine to very little conscience 1 The nation is evidently fonder of
the former than the latter; or are we generously to take the smallness
of the conscience-money as a complimentary tribute to the virtues of
the people. The English lead such a virtuous, exemplary life, that
their consciences are perfectly easy and at rest, and they have nothing
to reproach themselves with, or pay for, on that score. Viewed by this
becoming light, the Englishman's love of medicine is only equalled by
his love of morality.
One question more, and we have done. We are curious to know
how much the above quacks, who sold the £43,000 worth of pills, con-
tributed to the £3,000 of conscience-money?
“Go into a Back Room.”
Magistrate's Speech to MR. BABBAGE.
MR. BABBAGE's Calculating Machine has at last proved a failure.
He went home from the Police Court, the other day, and endeavoured
to calculate the thickness of the skull of the Magistrate, who, being
asked to relieve, him of the intolerable nuisance of a gang of street
musicians, did the magisterial best to aid the ruffians in, driving MR.
BABBAGE from his chamber of study. The Machine is unable to register
so great a number of inches. However, it can set down a portion, and
the sum is Brought-on.

OUR WIVID WISCOUNT.
Wiscount WILLIAMs uttered one of his best things in a debate on
Supply the other night. In reference to retiring, pensions, he said he
i. observed that “when persons retired from ill health they usually
lived a good many years.” “Of course they do, WILLIAMS,” said
MR. Toy DuNgoyſkE., “If they retire from ill health, they necessarily
approach good health.”. The Wiscount could not see this for a very

it was “a subtlety worth

INSURE YOUR MEMBERS’ LIVES
WE º think, when a constituency elects a man for Parliament
the least thing they could do for him would be to insure his life, an
at their own expense to keep up the insurance. Considering the
dangers of the service he performs for them, they ought to take steps
at the outset for providing for his family. “Leave health behind, all
ye who enter here,” may now fairly be the motto for the House of
Commons' doorway; and something clearly should be done for the
doomed ones who *. through it. If country sceptics have a doubt
of the perils which are nightly undergone by their M.P.'s, let them
hear what MR. AYRtoN has said upon the subject, and then own them-
selves converted to our Christian way of thinking:—
“MR. Ayrton called attention to the outrageous system of ventilation. Some-
times when the House was exceedingly warm, very cold air was pumped in at the
feet of hon. members. This drove the blood to the head, and produced headaches
(a laugh), which often compelled him and others to leave the House. Then, recently,
the most abominable odours had been pumped in through the holes and slits at
their feet. The smell of the chloride of lime which was used was pleasant enough :
but at other times the uncorrected atmosphere of the Thames was wafted through
the floor, and then the effect was dreadful indeed. (Hear, hear.)
Unfeeling minds there may be, which are pity;proof, and will in no
one whit be moved by sorrow at this story. Still coarser minds there
may be, wherein the statement will awaken, not sympathy, but
sarcasm, and whence the question will arise, as to whether the “cold-
air” pumps be half as great a nuisance as the many greater “pumps”
upon whose feet the air is pumped. And there is, besides, a climax of
º attained by those who choose to moot the savage point, as
to whether the production of a headache by iced air be half as likely
to occur as its production by iced drink. For our own part, we
should scorn to make such mean insinuations; and our benevolence
inclines us to conclude as we commenced, by i. ſ. that each
Member, should have his life insured, against the Thames and other
evils which each Members' flesh is heir to.

[*:::::::::::: to
MR. BROUGHTON.
AN IRREWERENT ALDERMAN.
SUCH a *†. meeting of the Court of Aldermen took place the
other day ! The *}; in debate was the City .# as likely
to be affected by a Bill in Parliament for the regulation of the office of
Queen's Remembrancer; and, after some remarks from the LoRD
MAYOR:—
“ALDERMAN HUMPHERy thought it would not be wise to º the Bill. He
looked upon the alteration introduced in the clause as one likely to bo beneficial
and convenient in its operation, as the Queen's Remembrancer or his agent might
be very well substituted for the high official who had been in the habit of announcing
HER MAJESTY's approval of the Sheriffs, and presiding while the .sheriffs were
occupied in the tomfoolery of cutting the sticks and counting the hob-nails. He
. could not see what advantage could arise from persevering in such a practice
at all. (Murmurs.)”
ALDERMAN CURITT agreed with ALDERMAN HUMPHERy; SIR PETER
LAURIE expressed similar sentiments; but
“ALDERMAN CARTER exprossed himself strongly upon the word ‘tomfoolery,’
used by ALDERMAN Humphery. He wished that word had not been used. It might
as well be said that the Lord Mayor's inauguration was tomfoolery. In fact, every
ancient form and ceremony up to the QUEEN's Coronation . be subjected to an
imputation of the kind, dictated by a feeling of levity and indiscretion. Such inno-
vations as that to which the Lord Mayor had very properly called the attention of
the court would inevitably lead to others of a more serious nature."
Hear, hear, ALDERMAN CARTER! To be sure, Sir! Quite right, Sir!
“Tomfoolery” is an expression which, as ap lied to an ancient an
interesting ordeal for testing the intellect P the Sheriffs of London
and Middlesex, is dictated i; a feeling of levity and indiscretion.”
It certainly is equally applicable to the LoRD MAyoR's inauguration,
and particularly to the 1,0RD MAYor's Show. The abolition of the
time-honoured ceremony in question would, no doubt, lead to other
innovations of a still more serious nature. Gog and MAGoG would
soon go the way of the City Barge, or fare still worse, unless some
truly worthy Alderman likewise bought them, to adorn the hall of his
own mansion. What ALDERMAN Humphery irreverently calls “tom-
foolery,” is, in proper and respectful language, the comic element in
the civic Constitution, and is essential to its vitality. The Corpora-
tion would never thrive without it. Iaugh and grow fat; but laugh

THAT’s LATIN.—“How quietly pretty little MRs. PEACHBloom is

NOT EXACTLY A DRINKING FOUNTAIN.
An attentive correspondent, writing from Congleton, has sent us the
subjoined card, with a request, on the part of the Colliers of that dis-
trict, for a translation of the Horatian line at the top of the ticket,
placed there by the Rev. J. Lush, the Incumbent:—
| Fies nobilium Tu quoque fontium.
TICKET OF ADMISSION TO THE
TEA PARTY
UPON MOW COP, THURSDAY, JULY 21sr, 1859.
Gentlemen, 1s. 6d. each.
No. 642. J. L.
To comply with our correspondent's request, and translate a quota-
tion from %. would be carrying, as it were, coals to Congleton
but for a fact which he mentions in connection with that piece of
Latin. The tea-party for which the card is a ticket of admission, was
to celebrate the opening of a well made by a benevolent lady, or rather
d of an excavation meant for a well, inasmuch as the hole which Mrs.
RANDLE WILBRAHAM has caused to be dug for the purpose of obtaining
water has none in it, and never had any. Under these circumstances,
the resemblance between the fountain of Blandusia and MRs..W.'s
well, which can render the address to the former, intelligible in its
application to the latter, is not easily conceivable...MR. Lush, perhaps,
“rapt, into future times,” quotes lººk intending to predict
that the well, at present insufficient to fill a kettle, will contain the
element necessary for a tea-party one of these days. Or, perhaps, he
means to describe the real state of that well without water rhetori-
cally, calling it a fountain by the same figure as that whereby the patron
of a tea-party might, as an advocate of temperance, if he were not
named, be appropriately nick-named, LUSH. On any other supposition,
if that reverend gentleman spouts his HoRACE on a dry well, he
himself must be considered to stand for the pump.

by suddenly ğ. up and delivering a Reform speech. . He actually
advised the Government, in preparing the Bill which we are so certain
will pass, next. Session, to omit any enactment of a º or pecu-
niary qualification for voters at elections; he thought all working-men
ought to have votes, and——
But the trance of astonishment was here broken, and LoRD
DUNGANNoN was the first to recover his speech and rebuke the
audacious TEYNHAM. Indeed, if the pedigree of the latter had not
been a venerable one (he descends from an Attorney-General of HENRY
The EIGHTH, and is not, therefore, a novus homo,) he would have cer-
tainly caught it. But LoRD GRANVILLE, following IORD DUNGANNON,
begged that the radical Baron would not say anything about Reform,
which should be introduced as early as convenient next Session.
The Lords had a little wrangle over the Divorce Amendment Act,
and some of them professed jealousy at the idea of excluding the
public, however fit it might be that the cases, should be heard in
private. The exclusion clause, somewhat modified, was carried, and
the Bill passed.
Having favoured the Chinese, with sufficient, pepper, it is now
desired to force our salt upon them; but as salt is a government
monopoly in China, the authorities there are not particularly delighted
with the idea. As we are to proceed in the most friendly and Chris-
tian manner in our dealings with the Flowery Parties, the orders from
home are, not to pour in our salt violently, but to “watch for, any
opportunity of breaking down the monopoly.” . Doubtless, they will be
understood by the adventurous persons whom it may concern.
In the Commons, LoRD BURY and MR. SchNEIDER were announced
to have been returned by bribery, and, consequently, to have been
returned to private, life. The Tories have been jºi. hugely, as
Liberal after Liberal has been ejected. Seven of that party have #:
unseated; and as LoRD DERBY was turned out of office by thirteen
only, the Conservatives say that had the investigation been made
before the vote on the Address, he would now be in office. But there
are some cases to be heard on the other side: meantime, however, the
laugh is fair enough. Another thing is to be said, namely, that it is
believed that the managers, of party, in London, go in to, win at
elections without regard to the wishes of the candidates; and, if the
men can only be seated, and brought up to the scratch for such battles
as that which floored Toro DeRºy, the Committees may do as they
like afterwards. If the House of Commons were not in the hands
of the attorneys, an Act would be passed making it penal for any-
body to act as º: at all in any election whatsoever. But you might
as well expect the House of Lords to abolish the eldest son's right to
º º:lº. l f the folly and ob
n Supply, there were grievous complaints of the folly and obstinacy
of the }. Boards for governing towns; and there can be no doubt
that, the petty influences and quarrels of small neighbourhoods cause
much jobbery and obstruction to sanatory measures. Mr. Punch is
WOL, XXXVII,
being perpetually implored to interfere in cases where helpless people
are poisoned by bad drainage, because their superiors either combine
or contend. #. will be down upon some of the parties, shortly.
The great business of the night was SIR CHARLEs Wood's speech on
the affairs of India. The pecuniary mess intº which we have got there
is something Awful...It will º, bear telling; but it must be told,
for there is nothing like taking the Brahminy buil by the horns. There
is a deficiency of about Twelve millions, and a half, and this must be
met. Sir CHARLEs begins with borrowing Five millions at once, and
will soon have to ask for the rest. However, MR. JAMES WILSON is to
o to India, and see whether he cannot introduce some sort of account-
eeping, and put an abominable system into order. MR. BRIGHT was
largely abusive of our management of India, and it is hard to say that
he was wrong. -
Later, Mr. Roebuck was very scornful about the reports of Election
Committees, and mocked at the hypocrisy of men who re orted their
belief that candidates, advancing large sums of money, did not intend
it to be used for bribery. MR. Bouverif waxed wroth, and assailed
Roebuck for daring to impute perjury to Honourable ¥ſembers; for
which rebuke, on a following night, MR, Roßbuck (rudely, but not
altogether inappropriately) described MR. Bouverie as a Prim
Prater. -
Tuesday. LoRD BRough AM spoke about the Strikes now unhappily
revalent, and expressed a wish that they could be prevented...Qher
}. wished the same thing, but none of their Coronetted Wisdoms
had any plan to propose; so the matter dropped. .
The 'Commons went again at that enormous grievance, the Judges'
Javelins, and reformed them; but SIR. G. GREY compelled the with-
drawal of the reform. Sir GeoRGE, either to-night or on another
occasion this week, incurred the wrath of Qolonel FRENCH, who
strongly advised him to drop his habit of “lecturing” Honourable
M. -
A foreign debate was to have come on, but the demise of LoRP
MINTo, Lord John Russell's father-in-law, caused its ſº
and Mr. Monckton MILNEs carried an address for the purpose of
punishing the ruffianly merchant captains who inflict cruelties upon
their sailors. If the Americans would consent to Qur hanging or
flogging their sea-scoundrels, we would gladly return the Cºmp iment,
j then justice would be got on whichever side the Atlantic the
offender happened first to ... But JonATHAN is extra tenacious on
such matters. A Count-Out pleasantly finished the evening.
Wednesday. Colonel, GREVILLE, who ºf. to have served on the
Húl Élection Committee, had bolted to Ireland, and was ordered to
be chased and arrested, which was done. He said he was Wºry ºi
and had gone on what he thought public duty; so he was ºff:
on paying his fees, and sworn on the Committee, and probably availed
.# 5f the opportunity to do a little swearing on his own account,
when the little }. of the SERJEANT-At-ARMs, was presented to him.
Mſ. Lºotomers is made a Lord, because he did not insist on having
office at the last change; so a new Member is wanted for Taunton.

64 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 13, 1859.
Thursday. The only fun of the day was inthe House of Commons, in Sup-
ply. LoRD PALMERston, who thinks he knows everything (and does know
a good deal), made a speech on Architectural.Art, and took enormous
pains to prove that MR. Scott's design for the new Government Offices
ought not to be adopted, because it is Gothic. The noble Lord seemed
to have been reading up MR. PETER CUNNINGHAM's Handbook, and
gave a very long list of public buildings in London, in order to show
that Gothic architecture was not Fº". but the list comprised such
a lot of edifices which one would be glad to hear had fallen down, or
been burned, that the logic went for nothing. Anybody who really
understands the question, knows that Gothic architecture can be ren-
dered suitable for the |. oses of any building, religious or profane;
and clever old PAM ta º nonsense. Even LoRD JoHN NNERS
had the “pull” upon him on this occasion. SIR Joseph PAxton set
the House right º the foolish notion that, Gothic apartments must
be “dark.” Greek architects built walls without windows: it was the
Gothic builders who made those holes in the walls; and SIR. Joseph
declared that Scott's design actually provided rather too much light.
For the credit of the country, Mr. Punch hopes that the best design ||
will be adopted; and as the House voted £30,000 for the foundation,
and this is to be under MR. Scott's direction, things seem working
the right way.
- ſº A queer plan for .# Serpentine instead of cleansing |-
it is to be adopted at an expense of £17,000. The world will rejoice to
hear that SIR ToMMY WILson, has had another overthrow—he having
once more ventured to try it on about Hampstead Heath. LoRD
FERMoy, as the new M.P., for Marylebone, had the opportunity of
walking into WILsoN, and did so ver properly. A bit ; ºiſ.
originated by MR. Rojºc, touching DR. MICHELL, M.P. for
Bodmin, who retires, as he plainly says, rather than ruin himself by
defending his seat, º he is innocent of bribery, gave some interest
to a dull evening. The House of Commons is intended for Rich Men
only, or men whose friends are rich, and people who have simply the
incomes of gentlemen have no business there. Our National Defences
continued the pièce de resistance in the House, as Mr. Punch trusts
they will prove elsewhere at need. The Ministerial White Bait was
ordered for the following Wednesday.

which a correspondent

paper,” but by using needle
and thread to fix i. ex-
tract to her note, – our
correspondent “trusts that
we shall not imagine” that the character of Devon cooks has “fallen to
so low a standard ” as the “perpetrator” of this “absurd advertise-
ment” believes. In a culinary interest, as well as that of gallantry, we
hasten to allay her apprehensions on this point. Our imagination, we
assure her, is in much too firm control for it ever to run riot in the manner
she so fears it may. In our wildest dreams of fancy we never could
believe in the existence of a cook who was not honest and .
and, above all, sober to a fault. We believe this is the general culinary
rule, and we see no cause why Devonshire should form a base, excep-
tion to it. We should as soon think of hearing of a tipsy teetotaller
as of a cook being notorious for a weakness for strong drinks. If the
“perpetrator” of the above has any doubt of this, let him consult the
pages of The Greatest Plague of Life, and he will there find the most
ample confirmation of the fact. Or let him moot the point in any
company of ladies, in which it is his fortune to obtain a moment's
audience: and he will learn from them that cooks are all avoiders of
strong liquors as carefully as Punch is an eschewer of weak jokes.
THE LAMENT OF THE SPIDER.
IN window and in cornice-nook my filmy net I spread,
Qr from the ceiling hang aloft my web of slender thread,
#. from *†. inside in vain; no snare can I devise
hat longer afford me prey. I can't catch any flies.
None are there to be caught, alas!—no luck about the house;
I’m like a cat that’s neither fed, nor yet can find a mouse.
As stingy housewives use their cats, all mistresses treat me,
E’en when dear lazy serving-maids my works leave besom-free.
This dwelling swarmed throughout with flies a little week ago,
And I and hosts of brothers hung our meshes high and low;
But now our quarry’s all destroyed; each fly is dead and gone:
My brothers are departed too, and I alone live on.
Deprived of e, and so of food, starvation I endure,
'Tis poison that has ruined me—that deadly Papier Moure;
That web—more fatal to the flies than any net of mine— -
Was set for them the other day—from which I’ve ceased to dine.
They drank—they flew away—they died—I caught some in their flight,
Woe is me that I tasted them, for since I’ve ne'er been right;
With inward pangs convulsed. I writhe, and, if I could, should groan,
From eating flies infected with worse venom than my own.
A º º the soaking scrap the spider's sport which spoils,
Which mocks his patient industry, by frustrating his toils;
Now is my geometric woof of not the slightest use,
Except to point the cackle of a moralising goose.
Farewell my old, my loved abode, whence, forced by want to roam,
Forth must I go for sustenance, and find another home;
Where, for there only can I live, there only food procure,
The blessed inmates don't mind flies, or don't use Papier Moure.
HALF-MEASURES.
TIE ChancELLOR of THE ExchequER, in asking for a vote of
£10,000 to re-coin the old copper coinage, informed the House that the
“intrinsic value of the new coins would not be more than half of the
present ones.” . We ask the CHANCELLOR or the ExghEQUER if this
is what he would call turning, “an honest penny?”—for every newly-
coined penny, according to this statement, would not be worth more
than the present halfpenny. This is a system of half-price that the
Mint seems to have borrowed from our Theatres. The CHANCELLOR
of THE Exchequer, should write outside his door, “HALF PRice
HAs CoMMENgED.” This is a new form of taxation, and if for every
§ he receives he only gives back a halfpenny, it is a clear gain of
ifty per cent, and we do not see what necessity there is for the impo.
sition (imposition in every sense) of the Income-Tax, Will the same
reduction be carried out with our silver and gold coinage 8 for it
romises, if adopted, to be the speediest extinction of the National
ebt that has ever been hit upon. Putting the revenue down at
£70,000,000, he will be able to apply £35,000,000 of it every year
towards that amiable purpose. We always thought that MR. Gilad-
ston E was a first-rate Chancellor of the Exchequer, and now we are
convinced of it. He not only gives us a bright new coin, but saves
the nation sixpence upon every shilling. MR. DISRAELI was not so
good a Chancellor—by one-half.
Things are Much as they “Used to Was.”"
At Milan, the mob flung the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA’s portrait into
the streets. It matters but little about the copy being turned out, so
long as the original has the power of turning in again. It has not
pleased the Genius of Italy to take FRANCIs-Joseph off the hooks just
yet. We are afraid that the shadow of his countenance will be felt
over Lombardy for several years to come. The EMPEROR may thank
Louis NApoleoN for restoring him to pretty nearly the same º:
that he has always occupied. The only relief the poor Italians have
is, to denounce the restoration as “a hanging shame.”

“Whilst I bless myself for being unburthened, I pity others for being
laden with calamities so heavy as women who are stupid enough to be
gulled by such trickery as the vulgar humbug above, instanced, which
would disgust and repel any reasonable being. These female fools
must be very numerous, or it would not pay the ‘Tow?ery Gang’ to
rint and circulate their appeals to idiotic credulity. The lying enve-
ope above alluded to contained a sheet as large as a local newspaper,
also full of lies, the biggest of which were printed in red ink. This
tissue of falsehoods commenced with the following sham summons:-
“@fficial Notitt.—THE DILAPIDATIONS to the Premises, No. —.
“&ſo — — and all others whom it may concern.
“THE CoMMITTEE of METRoPolitan Surveyors who adjudicated on the above
premises, having commanded their immediate restoration, ºtrttp, furthtt order
and decree, and give you Notíct accordingly, that the said premises must be cleared
of all Stock in Trade, Furniture, or Property, whatsoever ready for the commence-
nuent of the works by Monday, the 25th day of July, 1859, under a Penalty for
further delay of One Thousand Pounds.--So herein fail not at your peril.
“Dated this 12th day of July, 1859.”
“Next came the following equally authentic statement:
“The said STOCK IN TRADE to the value of £50,000 is comprised in the very
Richest Silks, SHAwls, DREssRs, FINESTTABLE DAMAsks, &c.
“And then ensued the fudge subjoined:
“The above distressing Notice places MR. — on the very vergo of Ruin ; the
most prompt measuros alone can rescue him; that is, to scll his Stock instanter at any
price he can ; this he has resolved upon, regardless of fate. He frankly submits
his terms. and confidently relies upon the British Public crowding to the rescue, as
the true benefit is theirs alone.
“The Sale is most positively limited to the 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd day of
July, 1850, and no longer.
* Parties residing at a distance will be paid Omnibus Fare on Purchases in excess
£2.
“This GREAT SALE will be found to have no parallel both as to Richness, Mag-
nitude, and Costliness of the Goods, as well as the Fatally Ruinous Prices, at which
.# will be sold,—either extremity, of richness or cheapness, it is impossible to
enno.
“Remember the sale is limited to Tuesday, July 19th, Wednesday 20th, Thursday
21st, Friday 22nd, and Saturday 23rd, by which time all must be swept away, no
loss will be allowed to prevent that great result."
“From the foregoing examples of fraudulent puffery, I suppose the
linendraper's name and address must be omitted, lest if any silly
women happened to take, up Punch and sce this letter, the extracts
contained in it should do the fellow, for their part, all the service of an
advertisement. I do not write for them. I write for men about to
marry, to whom I would say “Do no such thing,” or at least ‘Look
before you leap,” and beware of binding yourself for life to a simpleton
capable of being imposed upon by such preposterous bosh as that of
these advertising haberdashers.
“The feminine flats are next presented with a list of prices thus
headed:—
“A CATALOGUE.—Great and Illimitable Selling Off in consequence of Compulsory
Alterations of Premises, of the Wast, Costly, and Varied Stock of , Walue
£50,000. No goods at more than one-third their value, many much less. A truly
commercial wonder of wholesale sacrifice and devastation of Property. For Five
Days Only. See margin.”
“The prices are of course illustrations of the statement that the
goods .# all be sold at less, and much less, than their value: a
statement. I have no doubt that many of the softer sex believe, not:
withstanding that it comes under cover with a lie on the face of it. I
shall not go into details, for I hate the very name of the articles con-
cerned—‘organdi’—‘cachmeres”—“alpacas'—‘chintz’—‘tabbinets’-
‘balzarines’-things which at the best are flimsy, and at the cheapest
expensive. I will only say that among them I observe :

LADIES’ MAIDS AND LINDLEY MURRAY.
LADIEs have, we know, a hundred thousand occupations; but they
really should find time to write their own advertisements. Here is
one, for instance, which we cannot for a moment think a lady could
have written, and we must, perforce, ascribe it to a lady's maid:—
IF the LADY who has got a WHITE SINGLE SQUARE CASH.
MERE SHAWL, TAKEN by MISTAKE, at Ashridge, on Saturday, July 9th,
will be kind enough to RETURN it to No. 11, Wilton Crescent, Belgrave Square,
when the owner will return the White Barège Scarf Shawl, also taken by mistake.
Should the Government Examiners catch sight of this advertisement
(and now it’s put in Punch they cannot well help doing so), it is likely
that the next batch of our Civil Service candidates will be required to
point out its grammatical defects, and to remodel and translate it into
purer English. Stepping, therefore, in to the assistance of these
gentlemen, we may notice that the “got” is an inelegant redundancy;
and that the word “when” is likewise a redundancy, not inelegant,
perhaps, but clearly incorrect. The insertion of the “when’’ makes
the sentence an imperfect one, and it terminates appropriately with the
word “mistake.” -- -
It was through gallantry, we shrank from ascribing to a lady the
composition of a sample of bad language such as this. , But, our
courtesy may, after all, have forced us into error. English ladies have
been known to think it fine to talk in French, and for this cause may,
erhaps, affect an ignorance of English. Who knows but in Belgravia
§. grammar is in fashion, and that writin º is thought
as much “the thing”, as writing quite illegibly? We have heard it
said that French is held in more importance at a lady's school than
English; and it may be that a servant, though not having the advan-
tage of a, “finished” education, is made a better mistress of her
language than her mistress. . While we keep this to Qurselves, no great
harm or shame can come of it; but, for the credit of the country, the
fact should not go out of it... We, therefore, wish the Times would
§ its advertisements, lest foreigners who know our language should
e led to say, and say with truth, that very many of ourselves don’t.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT SPIRIT-RAPPING CAN DO.
ERE are a few marvels that
Spiritualism has in its secret
power to do. Our informant
is JUDGE EDMONDs, our Ame-
rican friend, who may be said
to have fairly given his min
to the study of the subject,
for there seems but little
§ doubt that he has gone stark
§ staring mad upon it:—
“I have seen a chair run across
a room, backward and forward,
with no mortal hand touching it.
I have seen tables rise from the
floor, and suspended in the air.
I have seen them move when not
touched. I have known a small
º, bell fly round the room over our
\º heads. I have known a table, at
which I was sitting, turned upside
down, then carried over my head,
and put against the back of the
sofa, and then replaced. I have
seen a table lifted from the floor,
when four able-bodied men were
exerting their strength to hold it
down. I have heard, well vouched
for, of a young man carried through
the air, several feet from the floor,
through a suite of parlours. I have
seen small articles in the room
fly through the air and fall at the
}. designed for them, and some-
#. sº rapidly that the motion was invisible, and all we could see was that the object had changed its
ocation."
Now, we want to know if Spirit-Rapping is capable of achieving all the above flights of

be a considerable saving in time, bother, and expense. No horses would be needed, no
cumbrous carts, required, whilst the services of drunken porters, who touch few articles of
value, without breaking them, could be entirely dispensed with. One effective spirit-rapper
would be able to do all the business. He would only have to be put en rapport with a
fourpost bedstead (a rapporter would not be abad name for these new spirit-carriers), and, hey
~
presto! before you could give a double knock
at a nobleman's door, it would be sent galloping
as quick as any four-poster through the air all
the way from Pentonville to ºfºil and that
done so rapidly that not a soul would be able
to notice its magic flight! ALADDIN's Palace
must have been moved by some such mysterious
agency. ...The surpassing beauty, too, of this
new motive power is, that it would do away
with all the º trouble of packing.
Everything might be despatched precisely as it
was, and no fear of smashing the largest article
apprehended., Glass -cases, looking-glasses,
washing-stands, would all “fall at the places
designed for them” with a charming precision,
worthy of a flap-scene in a Pantomime. We
suspect that Harlequin's wand must have a sly
touch of spirit-rapping in its wooden nature, or else
it never would transport things and persons with
such wonderful touch-and-go nicety and dexterity.
f JUDGE EDMONDs could only get some
brother-rapper to send him flying over here (for
if spiritualism has the power of carrying ward-
robes, why not human beings?) we are sure that
a rapid fortune awaits him. He has only to
turn PICKFORD on this new expeditious prin-
ciple, and he will soon have more goods than
he will be able to find rappers for. We vote
that he exhibit over his warehouse door a board
with the inscription:—“Goods REMoved IN
Town or Country. To ANY DISTANCE BY SPIRIT
MEDIUM of A 500 spirit Power.”
...Could not the same inscrutable influence be
likewise most serviceably employed upon travel-
ers, commissionnaires, cabs, and omnibuses?
By this invisible telegraph, an alderman might
be sent flying from Paddington to the Bank
for twopence, in less than two minutes. How
convenient, too, when one wanted the children
sent home from school, instead of having to go
to fetch them
It is clear that the boundary-line of the Spirit-
World, and its marvellous powers, have not yet
been defined.
ROMANCE IN RUSSIA.
DATING from St. Petersburg, a correspondent sends us a myriad of,
compliments, and an advertisement which we shall pººl, transcribe.
In general our modesty prevents our publication of the praises which
are poured on us; but for a reason we shall state we feel obliged for
once to make exception to our rule. We are told, then, with “pro-
found respect and admiration” that—
“Punch has certainly gained ground here. He does not get his precious pages
mutilated as formerly. He is always looked for with anxiety, and received with
pleasure; for he-makes us to forget many along hour, which would otherwise be
very dreary in our Arctic winter. He is our constant companion, going with us to
office, and when we take our guns for field sport, Punch always makes his *
ance at the halting-place, and often keeps us longer than sportsmen wish.”
The reason we §: this is not to blow our trumpet, for we have
neither need nor liking for such music. Everybody knows that Punch,
wherever he is read, is read with pleasure and with, profit; and to
publish to the universe the uses of its Punch, would H. to publish
news so stale that nobody would thank us for it. We simply print
the paragraph to show that Russia is pursuing now a more enlightened
policy than that in which her Government was “formerly” benighte
and now that Punch may enter in unmutilated shape, her progress an
prosperity must be regarded as assured to her.
And now for the advertisement, which, taken from the Journal de
St. Pétersbourg, runs thus:–
“Dimanche, au pont de Chaines, près le Jardin d'Eté, il a 6té volé un petit chien,
raco pintcher, poils longs, blancs et noirs, a moitié tondus, oreilles longues, nez et
levres noires, ayant l'air d'un petit lion. "Il sºappelle Mylord. La personne qui l'a
trouvé ou acheté est conjurée de le rapporter Maison Démidoff, Perspective de
Nevsky, No. 54, la récompense sera bonne. Ilest l'unique amide samaitresse.”
To a mind like ours, which ever brims with sympathy and sentiment,
there is something inexpressibly affecting in this statement, and we are
afraid almost to trust ourselves to speak of it. Overcome by the sad
tale of this lost duck of a dog, we cannot dwell as we should wish to
do on his surpassing merits. "When we think of his “black nose,” a
tear trickles down our own, and the mention of his “poils longs, a
moiſié tondus” makes us sigh to think of his capillary attractions, and
tº sorrow that the owner of them should sheer off. His most touching
charm, however, is that which claps a climax on our grief at his elope.
ment. “Il est l'unique ami,” we are told, “de sa maitresse /* What a
picture of bereavement do these few º: words supply How shar
must be the lºft in the bosom of that blighted one, whose heart an
hearth have been made desolate by the bereavement of alas! her one
and only friend!. Ilest l'unique amide sa maitresse. If he be dead,
what an inscription would this be for his tomb! And yet, º: aS
it sounds, there must surely be some hidden meaning in the phrase.
Words so full of love and tenderness could hardly, we should think, be
said of a mere lapdog. Perish the thought ! No!, Clearly, although
spoken of as being one belonging to the family of “PINTchER,” the
lost one is a creature of far nobler, “race.” The “unique ami” may
be possibly a puppy, but he is plainly a two-legged one, and if he wears
a tail it is as a tail coat. There are many º living who have the
air of little lions; and it must be to one of these, who may be known
b * ºns ears,” that the piteous conjuration “de sa maitresse” is
essed.
A PET FOR A PALACE.
It saddens one to think what losses are sustained, which, although
one has the will, one has no power to alleviate. Here, for instance,
} a sample, which we quote from the unfailing Second Čolumn of the
Times:—
HITE COCKATOO LOST, from 77, Street, on Saturday
last. Repeats “Pretty Cocky" constantly. A liberal REWARD is offered on
its being returned.
A cockatoo which is “constantly” repeating “Pretty Cocky,” must
really be a charming and invaluable companion, and the most liberal
of rewards would hardly represent the worth of it. At the same time,
had the treasure chanced to fall into our hands, we should not have
felt quite easy in our mind—nor in our ears—while such a pet
remained in our unworthy keeping. Had we failed in ascertaining
its unhappy rightful owner (who, no doubt, would have been found to
be distracted by his loss), we think we should have, sent it to the
EMPEROR of THE FRENch, as being one who would appreciate it
even more than we could hope to do. Bored as he must be by the
arrot-like repeating of his praises by his ministers, it would no doubt
; a relief to him to get a cockatoo to listen to, whose “large utter-
ance” was limited to the one phrase, “Trctly Cocky!”,

Majesty's horse rear. The

the fire became warmer as
the uniform of the Gene-
rals and the cuirasses of

a smile ; “silence them,

coming it too strong. No amount of “jumpin

ess a man, to clear a hundred yards at a bound
—a hundred yards of ground. French soldiers,
we have heard, are remarkable for élan, but to
leap to such long lengths they must be something
more than elands.
Charming Congruity.
LoRD PALMERSTON tells us that if MR.
Scott's design for the new Foreign Office is
allowed to be carried out, we should onl
get “a frightful and disagreeable-looking bī.
ing” for our money. We think this defect, if
true, is a very strong argument in favour of its
erection, inasmuch as the more “frightful” and
the more “disagreeable º ”, the new
Foreign Office is, the less is it likely to jar with
the other buildings that at present, adorn our
lovely Metropolis. A beautiful edifice might
attract notice, and moreover would only tend
to destroy that charming uniformity of ugliness
which we have succeeded in maintaining unin-
jured for so many years in London.
ExPORTATION OF BURDENs.
Those who pay the Income-Tax will drink the
less French wine. Though the taxation which
their navy costs us does not extend abroad to
our warlike neighbours, it nevertheless comes
home to them.
A “BRAWO?” FOR BARRY.
“PRAY, Mr. Punch, what is it makes men talk so foolishly, in Par-
liament? From the stuff which is reported of them, one would fancy
that the Thames mud gets into their heads, or that their brains are
nightly blown out by the blasts of ventilation. There must be some-
thing in St. Stephens which is destructive to good speaking, else how
can one account for the balderdash one hears there. It is a melancholy
fact that nine-tenths of the debates are only fit to be addressed to the
constituency of Bunkum. No sooner does a man, gain the title of
M.P. than, it seems to me, he loses the best half of his intellect. Let
him be a DEMosthenes before he takes his seat, and he sinks to a
mere Spoon ER the moment that he rises from it. Why, even MR.
AYRTON makes a stupid speech occasionally. The assertion may seem
strange, but only listen, Sir, to this:—
“The fact was, that incompetence and extravagance seemed to mark the whole
arrangement within this building. For instance, an enormous sum was wasted
above their heads in forcing light through plate glass, whereas one-third of that
light would be sufficient for the House if it were not placed outside the glass. This
extravagant arrangement tended merely to gratify some one's caprice. But from
beginning to end the whole building was nothing but a piece of mediaeval folly.
(A laugh.). It carried them back 400 or 500 years with no other end than to deprive
them of all the advantages which science had since placed at their disposal. Instead
of ample light there was obscured glass, in order to imitate a period when the
manufacture of glass was in its infancy (hear, hear); and although our manufac-
turers now produced the most beautiful crystal, the House was full of little trumpery
pieces of glass a few inches square, inserted in lead casing, and dignified by the
name of windows. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) What could have poss the
minds of any man, or any set of men, to insist that everything about the Houses of
Parliament should accord with the ignorance of some hundreds of years ago, rather
than with the advanced intelligence of to-day! (Hear, hear.) And this was called
the perfection of art | Why, ornaments of the most trumpery kind stared you in
the face at every turn. Look at the absurd paintings within the House, which led
#. members to attend very little to what was being done, while some could
hardly rise to speak without having their thoughts distracted by the lions and the
dragons, and the rest of it. (Laughter.) This trumpery was repeated from one end
of the building to the other. If some man at Birmingham had contracted to erect
the Palace, one could have understood his reasons for casting the portcullis and the
Tudor rose."by the dozen, and for sticking them together afterwards in all parts of
the buildings; but that men should carve stone after stone with a repetition of the
same design, that they should scribble the History of England in writing which
nobody could read, so that the very Policeman on duty had to say, ‘You must turn
the other way, Sir, to look at that,' passed all comprehension. (Laughter.) Yet this
was called decoration It was a disgrace to the country to have erected such a
lº at all, and the decoration showed a poverty of invention which even a school-
joy would pronounce contemptible. (Hear, hear.)"
“There now, did you ever hear more silly stuff than that? Why, in
the name of common sense—or, what is more extraordinary, of House
of Commons sense—what in the wide world, Sir, does MR. AYR roN
want? To complain of the House as being ‘trumpery’ and “absurd,’
and unsuited for the purposes for which it was designed, seems to my
mind as unreasonable as to quarrel with our statues for being ugly and
ridiculous, or to find fault with our fountains because they look, like
squirts. It is the proud boast of us Britons that we never will do
anything like anybody else: and in not departing from our insular con-
ception of what is True, and Beautiful, and Loveable in art, we pro-
erly maintain our nation's independence, and keep up our reputation
}. consistency at any rate, if not for common sense.
“With regard, Sir, to the charge that the º, in construction,
is behind the time, and carries those who sit in it back to the Dark
Ages, I say so much the better, and I rejoice to hear it. There may
be dolts and idiots who may think that if the House were built
more in accordance with what this MR. AYRTON calls our ‘advanced
intelligence,” there, might be more marked progress in our course
of legislation; and that if the windows were made to give more
light, our statesmen, peradventure, might be more enlightened, . But
to my mind, Sir, our progress is too fast as it is, and I am thankful to
the architect for planning means to check it. As one of the old
school I hate newfangled notions, and the notion that a Government
ought to be enlightened is in my view quite a novelty, and I have
therefore a just horror of it. ... None could ever have conceived it in the
good old times, and only Radicals and Chartists even now would dream
of it. “Innovation’ and ‘improvement’ are to my mind but the
synonyms for “reform’, and ‘revolution;' and of these two words I
know not which I hold in greater hatred.
“As for the “extravagant arrangements’ of the House, and the
‘enormous sums’ we have wasted on the lights and (so called) orna:
ments, so far from our complaining, we ought, Sir, to feel proud...of
them. Let other nations screw and pinch their builders as they will:
there is no reason why England should degrade herself in this way.
John BULL can afford to make his payments through the nose, and I
am pretty sure he feels a sort of proud pleasure in *.i. so. The
enjoyment that a snuff-taker derives from taking snuff, I believe John
BüLi, deduces from this other nasal luxury. -
“In defiance then of all that MR. Ayrton may have said, I contend
the House of Commons is a truly British building, and I cry ‘Bravo,

CIVIC POETRY OF PARIS.
THE Address lately delivered to the EMPEROR OF THE FRENch by
the chief Municipal Council of Paris, ought to make the Court of
Aldermen perfectly ashamed of themselves. There is no poetry in the
congratulations which the Corporation of London occasionally offers to
the QUEEN, Substituting. “Madam”, for “Sire,” the civic, digni-
taries would never dream of glorifying HER MAJESTY in the following
vein, wherein ERCLEs’ vein, a tyrant's vein, mingles with that of a
lover, which is more condoling:-
“SIRE, On the day of the departure of your Majesty theº of all France,
joining in the idea and the resolutions of the EMPERoR, offered to him in a warm
ovation, its arms and treasures to carry on the war. It promised to watch like a
mother over the sacred depositintrusted to it."
The personification of the people is a poetical idea which never would
have occurred to your Worships. You would never have the grace—
and elegance—to tell your Sovereign that the population of Cheapside
and the neighbouring districts joined her in her idea and in her reso-
lutions, and offered her its arms and treasures in a warm ovation. It
is true that an ovation means a display analogous to the lesser triumph
of the ancient Romans, which was “allowed to those commanders who
had won a victory without much bloodshed,” instead of meaning a
popular demonstration made in honour of an EMPEROR on the eve of a
sanguinary war. No doubt the description of arms and treasures as
“offered in a warm ovation” is not exactly sense. But you could
never have composed such nonsense as that any day.
When did you ever talk of the British public promising to watch
like a mother over the sacred deposit intrusted to it? Did_you ever,
any of you, conceive an image so interesting? Image?—What idea
have you London Aldermen of images, beyond Gog and Magog?
When did you ever give utterance to an expression of gratitude of
this kind?
“The Civic Council of Paris is glad to testify publicly its devotion to your
Majesty's dynasty, and its gratitude for that genius which has thrown such new
splendour upon it."
What gratitude have you ever felt, or, even evinced for the genius
which is continually throwing new splendour upon you from the Office,
85, Fleet Street “Hang ye, gorbellied knaves!”. .
f some of you have occasionally joined in the National Anthem at
the prompting of loyal enthusiasm, and under the influence of iced
punch, are any of you capable of singing the subjoined Te Imperatorem
—if you know what that means?
“Sire, the patriotic acclamations of an immense city in the presence of your
invincible soldiers—its earnest prayers to God, who º you, will soon resound
on a solemn occasion, and proclaim that the nation, proud of its Emperor, admires
you and loves you for this new glory added to our flag, for this firmness which no
danger disturbs, for this calmness which dominates even the exultation of triumph,
for those blessings ofrº. so promptly recovered; finally for the noble attitude
France assumes towards Europe."
Ah, ye callous old sinners!—how long will it be before your dry and
formal religious utterances and allusions will assume the fervour and
reverence of the above devotional language? And when will you learn
to employ such, a grand prosopopoeia as that which represents France
assuming a noble attitude tº: Europe? When will any address
that you may concoct and vote at one of those prosy Courts which you
hold for the despatch of dull business exhibit England standing in a
noble attitude? The sublimest and most beautiful composition of that
kind that you will ever, produce, will never suggest the idea of
Britannia invested with Crinoline, in a hat and feathers, gracefully
balancing herself on tiptoe in a posture of triumphant vanity.

AND so the French Eagle is about to have its claws clipped. Louis

throws up his commission, and throws down his arms. His sword is
on the point of being sold off as old iron, and the swords of more than
half his army will go with it. So says the Moniteur, and Punch (of
course) believes it, though Punch is not quite certain when the sale
is to commence; but Punch trusts that, when it does, it will be found
a genuine sale, and will in no manner resemble what is known as a
mock auction. Until assured of this, Punch trusts that MR. BULL
will not relax those peaceful preparations for which an extra four-

PALLADIAN PALMERSTON.
OUR friend PALMERStoN, made an uncommonly funny speech, the
other day, at a morning sitting of the House of Commons. Why
uncommonly? Because the noble PREMIER's speeches are commonly
funny by reason of the humorous, and witty remarks in which they
abound, like the º: of this popular periodical. But, on the occasion
in question, the noble Lord at the head of her MAJEsty's Government
indulged in a discourse abounding in the sort of fun which is sometimes
afforded by the observations of a dunce, who boasts of his inability to
tºº §§ or music, or painting. He said a number of fine
things of this kind in disparagement of Gothic Architecture, in par-
ticular as proposed for adoption in building the new Foreign Office.
Among these may be instanced the following:—
i. The Gothic was not an English style of architecture, but it was imported from
alor --
Our noble friend never heard of the “Early English” style, and does
not seem to be aware that the Mediaeval architecture of this count
had a character peculiarly its own... But did the Palladian style origi-
nate in England? did the Tuscan, the Doric, the Ionic, the Corinthian
the Composite * There is, however, a certain style which may be sai
to have originated in England, just as the English language did, if we
may compare a grand language with a ludicrous architecture. LORD
PALMERSTON himself exemplified this British order:-
“They had in London the following buildings in styles not Gothic:—The Bank
of England, the Mansion House, the East India House, the Royal Exchange,
Somerset House, the Custom House, the British Museum, the º: House,
the National Gallery, Greenwich Hospital, the University College, the Post Office,
Chelsea Hospital, Buckingham Palace, and Stafford House.”
These buildings, with a few exceptions—Chelsea Hospital, for
example, which is one of the least ugly of them—are mixtures of the
classical temple and the modern dwelling-house. They correspond
exactly to CoNoN, and Lysan DER, and ALCIBLADEs; to Cicero, CATO,
JULIUS CAESAR, and MARG ANTONY, attired partly in tunics or togas,
and partly in the hats and boots now worn by gentlemen or by coster:
mongers; wearing spectacles together with swords and shields, and
likewise carrying umbrellas, or smoking short pipes, as they are repre-
sented by an illustrious artist in the Comic Hist , and other
combinations of wit and learning. This truly British order of archi-
tecture may be called, or has been called, the Cockney Classic. The
spirit of the simply Classic is beauty and grace; that of the purely

ticularly claims the attention of Farmers, Gardeners,
Florists, &c., and all who suffer from their ravages will
do wellto avail themselves of its use.”
We certainly have never yet heard any-
body complain of suffering from the ravages
of either farmers, gardeners, or florists, whom
the above announcement seems to stigmatise
under the head of dangerous vermin. How-
ever, the poisonous wheat which the Don-

If any confirmation were wanted of the

will bring it to 5, Cradle Street, St. James's Square,

As the reader may suppose, we have altered
the address: partly for the reason that we
don’t wish to be personal, and partly because
we think that, the word which we have sub-
stituted, is slightly more appropriate than
that which we suppress. It must, we think,
be viewed as a sign of second childhood, when
we find a grown up baby with a coral for a
plaything: for that’s the only use to which
we fancy that the corals above-mentioned
could be put. Why such things are called
“charms” we are too ignorant to know, and
too hot to try and guess. If we look at them
as ornaments, there seems nothing very charm-
ing in a “pig” and a, “chair;” and, not
being of “the faithful,” we have no faith in
such relics as being capable of “charming”
in a superstitious sense. A brooch is not a
common thing for men to wear; and had
not the word “artist” been put in the ad-
vertisement, we might have thought some
“charming woman” was the owner of these
charms, in which case, of course our sym:
pathy would have stopped our criticism. But
we must confess, we feel no P. for a man
for losing what was, neither of ornament nor
use to him. Had this artist lost his cutty,
he would have had our instant jº but
we have none to throw away on him for losing

74 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 20, 1859.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
UGUST 6. Saturday. Mr. Mid-
shipman Easy, having two
tooth-brushes, a new one and
an old one, purchased, with
the latter, a copy of the Arti-
cles of War, from a brother
º officer of his ship. Mr. Easy,
on perusing this code, rather
approved of it, as enabling
him to confute his captain in
argument; but SIR Joseph
PAxton states that sailors in
general do not appreciate this
valuable quality in the Arti-
cles, and object to come un-
der them. This fact was
brought out in a discussion
on the Reserve Force of Sea-
men Bill, when LoRD CLA-
RENCE PAGET, who was him-
self Mr. Midshipman in the
Asia, at Navarino, allowed
- that many of the Articles
were old fashioned, and said that they were being re-edited, ..
A hypocritical measure, ſº to restrain Corrupt Practices at
Elections, was “continued.” It reminds folks of the taunt of the
silly constable in Measure for Measure. “Dost see now, thou wicked
varlet, what has come upon thee. Thou art to continue,” and it is
about as nonsensical. The Election Committees also “continued,” in
their way, and people are really shocked at the wickedness of poor
people in being so ready to sell what rich people are so eager to buy.
or some reason or other the Universities, on MR. GIADSTONE's
motion, were exempted from the operation of the Weights and Measures
fliii. The Homeric statesman is probably partial to Troy weight, and
would serve out moist sugar-
“Softly sweet in Lydian measures.”
Monday. This was a Great Night, according to, Parliamentary
measure of greatness. An actor, who estimates the value of a part by
the number of “lengths,” would have been in ecstacies.with the quan-
tity of talk, only that it was fairly divided. The Times surrenders
twenty-five columns and a half to the debates. In the Lords, NoHMANBy
that venerable, or at least old Peer (as MR. BRIGHT would º opened
upon the Peace of Willafranca, and declared that the world believed its
terms to have been patched up by LoRD PALMERSTON, and M., DE
PERSIGNY. The disgust of LoRD P. at its being suggested that he had
tried to make peace anywhere, must be, a thing to be conceived
rather than described. foºd N. praised Austria through, thick and
thin, whatever that extremely ridiculous and entirely vulgar phrase
may mean, and had actually good words for the GRAND DUKE of
Tuscany. When LoRD HEN and all his novels are gone where the
weak niggers go, one Mas. Elizałºwnº's lºokºut of Guidi
House #. and her womanly, belief that the lips of the DUKE
Leopold, which were “warm with his, children's kisses,” could not
utter “a cold lie” (they did, though), will preserve that False. Duke's
memory for the scorn of a century. LoßD Wodehouse said, what
was proper in reply to HEN’s charge that our Government had been
an adviser in the matter, but admitted that LoRD John RussBLL had
acted as Postman. -
The attempt, of the Dissenters to get into the management of
Endowed Schools was squashed for the present, the Bishop of LoNDON
coming out with some mild ridicule of what his respected Lordship
termed the imaginary grievances of our dissenting brethren. Those
abominable, atheistic, superstitious, schismatic bigots, the Dissenters,
have been rather civil to DR. TAITE, because he went preaching in
beggarly neighbourhoods, and to omnibus men and other canaille, as
if a iſo. ancied that he ought not to leave such º souls to the
inferior clergy; but Zion, and Jireh, and Mahershalalhashbosh will now
be down upon 'Fulham.
But the Grand Hui was in the Commons. Nearly all the best
fireworks went off;-the GLADSTONE Catharine-wheel, fizzing three
ways at once; the WHITESIDE “maroon, to imitate cannon,” and a
bad imitation too; the John Russell Jack-in-the-Box; the DISRAELI
Flower-pot, remarkable for its flower of brimstone: the HENNEssey
Roman candle, a new affair, and not ineffective, but for its ill odour of
sanctity; and the PALMERSTON, pot de feu, throwing everything but a
light upon the subject. The whole business was a Do; and the Daily
ews uncivilly announced in the morning that LoRD Éicno, the pro-
moter of the fray, had been made safe. But the debate was really
a good one, and GLADSTONE, especially, whacked, the blue book, of
Loºp MALMesBURY's despatches in a way that did honour to his
hand and arm. He warmed to his work, and smashed into LoRD
ELCHO like a good one, making all sorts of smart hits. Among other
things, he complimented ELCHO, who had referred to lexicographic
SAMUEL for a definition of “neutrality,” for having taken all pains to
instruct and inform his mind by a reference to the “all-but-inaccessible
pages of DR, Johnson.” LoRD John made a meat, very happy, and
; unfair comparison of WICTOR EMANUEL to WILLIAM THE
HIRD; and LORD PALMERSTON was exceedingly funny (borrowing the
idea from Bubbles of the Day) about the uncomfortable position of the
Pope, sitting upon so many bayonets. . It will be seen, therefore, that
everybody did his best to promote the harmony of the evening, and the
party did not separate until a late hour, nearly three.
It just occurs to Mr. Punch, that he has not mentioned the subject
of the debate. It is really of very little consequence how a pleasant
evening is brought about; but the curious may as well be informed
that the Conservatives pretended to wish to pledge Government not to
go into any congress about Italian affairs, and Government pretended
to be indignant at any notion of being fettered, but declared that they
had no intention of ;...& Of course there was no division,--
why, it was only two days from St. Grouse.
Tuesday...We don't kill a pig every day, as the song says; and after
some Militia talk in the Lords, they were off before six. The Commons
had a personal matter before them,--a squabble about the Pontefract
Election, wherein MR. Over END, M.P., appears to have been too keen
for MR. HUDSON late M.P.'s friend MR. LEEMAN, and to have rather
cooked the goose, of a MR. CHILDERs (first syllable short, as in
É. a descendant of the celebrated Flying ditto. This naturally
ept them; but as soon as that was over, and the case of a poor boy,
stated to have been ille y enlisted, and killed by the discipline of
Parkhurst, came on, the House, as naturally, was Counted Out.
hºednesday. The Lords cut away at heaps of Bills; and LoRD CAMP-
BELL volunteered an utterly uncalled-for declaration that he was
opposed to a man's marrying his sister-in-law. These spurts of senti-
ment are not uncommon in the Lords, who never laugh at one another;
and a Peer might get up and say he liked oysters with their beards on,
or didn't think camphorated chalk good for the teeth, without exciting
a smile. And if it were otherwise, you might as reasonably expect to
rile the male Hippopotamus at the di. by laughing at the female,
as annoy our friend CAMPBELL by laughing at him; and if it did vex
the brave. old. Scotch trump, LóRD É. would sooner spend an
evening with Wiscount WILLIAMs, or on the river, than do it.
The Overend bother again in the Commons, and the matter, referred
to a Committee, who ſº reported that on the whole MR. CHILDERs
had been queerly used, and ought to be replaced in a position in which
the law makes it utterly impossible that he should be replaced. This
is the sort of justice that may be expected from Committees, and no
other kind will be got until a regular legal tribunal takes cognisance
of election wrongs.
Then there was a really important debate about the Indian Army, on
a Bill, which |. authorising the keeping 30,000 English soldiers in
India, but nobody was much interested in this, and probably a house
might not have been kept, but for a subsequent debate on a motion
about the way electors are “waked up” at Wakefield.
Thursday. An Indian debate in the Lords, and LoRD PUNCH's friend,
LoRD LYvepEN, made his début, beginning by saying “he could not
do”—something or other. Nobody ever supposed he could do any-
thing, except dress so neatly and talk so fluently that young officials
were momentarily deluded into admiring him. LoRD ELLENBoRougii
wanted strong measures in India, and was pleased that MR. JAMEs
WILSON was going out to take the finances in hand, though as there
are no finances, JAMEs's place looks like a sinecure.
The Commons had another Count Out, but first had a little Catholic
row, Newp:GATE abusing and Bowy ER defending CARDINAL WIse-
MAN, on a Bill exempting Catholic Trusts from proper investigation.
The amended Divorce Bill was passed, the clause for keeping out the
public on certain occasions being rejected, though SIR. R. BETHELI,
says that the Divorce Court is the resort of “a jeering, laughing, and
º mob,” eager to hear what no clean-minded person would wish
to hear.
Friday. Penultimate sitting. No end of work done. Also, LoRD
DENMAN (we need hardly say that this is not the clever LoRD
DENMAN, but quite tº.; volunteered the information, that a cousin
of his, name unknown, had written to him to say that, in the unknown
cousin's opinion, LoRD MALMESBURY had been an admirable Foreign
Minister.
In the Commons, another Bribery victim was sacrificed—HoARE, of
Hull. MR FITzRoy announced that he did not like to stop the Sunday
music in the Parks, as requested by certain Sabbatarians. º MELLOR
expounded the hard case of two men who had received a very heavy
sentence of penal servitude for stealing oil-cake, but as the judges
were magistrates at quarter sessions, and the men were said to be
poachers, the wonder is that they were not at once executed in the
court-yard of the Sessions' House, MR. BRADY then tried his hand
with a private grievance; but this was felt to be too much, and the
House was counted out for the last time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Saturday. The ultimate day. Everything being huddled up and
bundled out of the way, LoRD CAMEBELL sent for the Commons, into
the House of Lords, and delivered the following sentiments on the part
of His Royal Mistress.
You may go. You have been good boys. ...
But next Session you must really do Something.
Foreign folks are trying to get Me into Congress.
I scarcely know whether I ought to consent. -
I should be glad, of course, to promote peace and quietness.
I have sent a Plenipo to Pekin.
I am unaware that I am going to be quarrelled with.
India is E. She must be reformed,
Especially in regard to money matters.
I am extremely obliged for Military and Naval reserves.
Also to you, Commons, for all money voted.
I am rejoiced that the country is happy and content.
Now go home, and continue good boys.
The usual bowing and handshaking having been performed, ereunt
Omºtes.
And so Mr. Punch, with infinite satisfaction to himself and the world,
once more bottles up the Essence of Talk. Would he could as easily
bottle up the Essence of Thames. Plaudite.
DEFEND US FROM OUR DEFENDERS!
“PUNCH. - - -
-- Newspapers to my mind are intolerable nuisances, and, I
don't often waste my time and temper in perusing, them. But the
other day I had to j." railway journey, and as the train of course
was late (these newfangled conveyances are never punctual to their
time), I walked up to the bookstall and asked for the John Bull, that
being the § º which an Englishman may read without bein
disgusted with low revolutionary sentiments. ... Haven't a John Bull,
Sir, but here’s last week's Eraminer, if that will do as well for you.’
This was the insulting answer I received... Of course the fellow knew
that the Framiner was one of the most radical of papers, and seeing by
my face that I was Tory to the bone, the blackguard, Sir, no doubt said
what he did to chaff me. Being ignorant, however, of its º;
character, I paid my sixpence for the paper, and was surprised to fin
in some respects, that it was worth the money. In an article, for
instance, upon the getting up of Rifle Clubs, I came upon the following
most sensible remarks:—
“There are certain persons in this country who do not hesitate to advocate the
arming and equipment, at the cost of the State, of the several hundreds of thousands
of men, who with no qualification beyond a stout heart and brawny arms, would
claim their right to be enrolled in defence of the kingdom. This would be creating
a national force with a vengeance. Why, every common day labourer, whose whole
year's wages would not perhaps amount to the price of his rifle and uniform, would
come forward as a volunteer, and the State would not only be putting arms into the
hands of this dangerous class, but actually teaching them how to use these weapons
after they had got them.”
“This reductio ad absurdum is excellently put. The idea of common
labourers being trusted with rifles seems to my mind, I confess, too
preposterous to dream of. Besides the danger to the Štate, only think
of the great peril to our partridges and pheasants. . As the Etaminer
points out:—
“Hitherto our admirable game laws have, in a measure, served to keep the t
mass of the people ignorant of the use of fire-arms; witness the majority of our
recruits, who on joining the army scarcely know the difference between the butt
and the barrel of their muskets; but once give every grown man a rifle, and instruct
him how to hit a target at 500 yards, in a few years there will be as *. dead shots
in England as there are in Kentucky; and although invaders might thus be kept
at a distance, it would be at the expense of all we hold most dear; from such men
no pheasant would be safe, no deer park would be sacred."
A, pretty prospect, truly 1 Defend us, say I, from having such
defenders! It is very well to look to the preserving of the country
but we must also keep an eye to the preserving of our pheasants. f
for one have far more fear of poachers than invaders. England without
the Game Laws would not be safe to live in : and who could hope to
see the Game Laws kept in force, when “every grown man” had a
rifle, and knew how to use it?
“People talk with some alarm of the defenceless state of England,
but it frightens me far more to think of the defenceless state of m
F. As it is, by keeping up a ; force of gamekeepers,
e
b
manage that my pheasants sleep in tolerable safety; but if rifles
e sown, broadcast among our poaching population, no army of obser-
vation, that I could hope to organise would be sufficient to keep watch
on their nocturnal movements.
But a still more clinching proof of the necessity there is to keep
our Rifle Clubs select, and to admit no Wolunteers but men of known
position, is found in the concluding passage of the article:—
“We are quite prepared to hear the advocates of anarchy and socialism contend
that a man may be unable to pay £10 for his weapon and dress, and yet be attached
to his ‘..."; if only by the jº. tie of a home and a family, which he would
desire to defond if attacked by an invading foe. Such claptrap hardly requires
serious,confutation. A man who does not possess a £10 note, can hardly have a
home that is worth protecting; and if, under such circumstances, he should have a
family, his gross imprudence only furnishes an additional ment against in-
trusting him with the use of fire-arms. * * Once admit universal franchise in
the Volunteer corps, and it will make its way into other institutions, till the throne
and the altar shall be undermined.”
“Precisely my opinion, Punch... These Rifle Clubs, you may depend
on it, are innovations fraught with danger, and it béhoves us tº be
ghary of affording them encouragement. Government has done wisel
in damping to some measure the ardour that has flamed for them, an
I think the more cold water that is thrown on it, the better. For only
just consider, once place the working-men and the well bred ones on a
footing (which we should do by admitting them alike, as Volunteers),
and where, pray, is the social quality to stop? We should ere long
have our peers hobnobbing with our peasants; and our lords, from
standing next them, may form friendships with our labourers. In
short, there is no saying how these Rifle Clubs may harm us, if we don’t
take care to keep them º exclusive., Equality of footing is the
thin edge of the wedge, and when the wedge is driven home, all the
bulwarks of Old England will be split up for abonfire, and Republicans
and Chartists will dance around it in diš
“As my life is well insured, and I am not a Member of Parliament
(or I might be carried off by the miasma of the river), I quite expect
to live to see my worst predictions realised. Meantime, Pune , I

“ONE of THE OLD SCHOOL.”
"... Noſe.-As we have no wish to deprive any paper of its privileges,
we should much regret to weaken the force of this exception. But
we feel constrained to state, that we believe the quoted article was
meant, to be ironical; and by writing as he has done, "One of the Old
School,' has only shown his length of (y)ears.
“That's the way the Money Goes.”
IN, an article the other day upon the Civil
Service Estimates, the Times began a sen-
tence by remarking that:—
º As for the public purse, it is a mere abstrac-
on."
Yes, exactly...That’s just it. The public
purse is just a “mere abstraction” from our
private pockets.
Cab Law Amendment.
GREAT inconvenience is often
experienced by the rider, in a
. from the want of sufficient
means of communication with
the driver. To thrust your head
out of the cab-door and bawl
is unpleasant, undignified, and
for along time ineffectual. The
... the cabman ge-
nerally sticks. To remedy this
great nuisance let an improve-
ment of the last Cab Act be
introduced early next Session,
; that in the absence of a check-string, it shall be lawful for any
fare to break the window in front of him in order to poke the driver.
Painful Separation in High Life.
It is with feelings of the deepest regret, such as, in, our present
afflicted state, it would be utterly impossible for us to describe, that
we record the following distressing fact, which we extract from one of
7|the French telegrams of last week:—
“THE DUKE of MALAkorf HAs LEFT NANCY."
What, let us ask in the name of outraged humanity, has “NANCY"
done to be left by the Duke in this brutal and public manner *
A PEERLESS EXAMPLE.
THE DUKE of North.UMBERLAND has, lately, given a thousand
bottles of sherry to each of three hospitals. It has been remarked
that it would be well for, other members of the aristocracy to “do
likewise,” but that the Duke is one Perse (PERCY).

A TYRANT.
THE MEMBER ON THE MOORS.
THE Member of Parliament goes to the Moors,
Now all of his speeches are made out of doors,
His ºl. game is abandoned for #.
But he cannot get rid of the slang of the House.
“Order, order!” he shouts, if too soon the birds rise,
“Hear, hear!” at a hit from his party he cries;
And hails, as his way through the heather he steers,
A bad shot with laughter—a good shot with cheers.
At his bird should another unfairly let fly,
...Oh, oh!” is the Member of Parliament's cry;.
He says when his neighbour the game slightly wings,
“I second that motion,” and down the prey brings.
Should the ground they are beating no booty return,
“I move,” says the Member, “this House do adjourn;
And brace after brace right and left whilst he kills,
He observes, “That’s what I call repealing your bills!”
If he mentions his gun, that short word he’ll expand;
“This weapon,” he’ll say, “which I hold in my hand.”
To the dogs, hunting Wii. “Question, question' " he bawls,
And pot-hunting “unparliamentary” calls.
Qn the tip of his tongue is the cry of “Name, name!”
“Divideſ’’s his proposal of sharing the game.
The game-bag the “budget.” he terms evermore,
“This day six months,” the season when sport will be o’er.
He is, “free to confess,” and “he will not deny
That he did not or might not” have wiped his friend's eye,
If he called him a muff, still he meant no offence;
The word was not used in a personal sense.
Master Jacky (who pursues the fagging system even when home for the IIolidays). “Off, HERE You ARE! I've BEEN LookING Fon you
GIRLs EveRYwhERE. Now, You Just MAKE HASTE Hoxſe, AND PEEL ME A Lot of SHRIMPs For My LUNch !”
Thus laughing and talking the whole summer's day,
In that parliamentary kind of a way
On his legs in the heather, as though in the House,
The Member of Parliament follows the grouse.
THE RIGHT HERO IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
THAT trustworthy French gentleman, ON DIT, informed us, the
other day, that when the victorious army entered Paris the EMPEROR
Louis NApoleoN was to place himself at the head of it. The same
reliable authority neglected to tell us what position PRINCE NApoleon
was to take up on the same occasion. We should say, if the Prince
had any respect for others, or even any respect for himself-if in that
valiant breast there was locked up any truthful recognition of his own
merits, that, in modesty, he could not think of *...; himself
until the whole army had defiled, when he would present himself
proudly at the tail of it; for such has always been the post of honour
that Fion. Fion has affectionated the most, as well as the place of
danger in which he has always distinguished himself the greatest. We
must say, that PRINCE, NAPoiroN is the very last man in the French
army ever to put himself unduly forward.
A Joke from a Jetty.
“I say, SNooks,” said SYKEs, as the two friends lolled together on
the pier at Lowestoft, “I say, SNooks, my boy, why are our brown
faces like Apollo's chariot?”
Gasped the panting SNooks, “I haven’t an idea.”
“No, I don't suppose you have. Nobody has one now. It’s too
hot to think, this weather. But come, I’ll ease your mind. Answer
—Because it’s the Sun's tanned 'em!”
hiº SNooks gasped again, and groaned, and—well, didn't drown
SCII.

GEESE AND GANDERS.
E quote from the re-
pºſt of a meeting of
“Society Masons,” re-
lative to the Strike, a
rather good ... thing,
which was said by a
member of the asso-
ciation:-
** Joseph Turnpºrt. It's
an old adage that “what is
#. for the goose is good
or the gander.’”
Combined against
each other, recipro.
cating º: and mu-
tually suffering and in-
flicting loss, the work-
men on the one hand,
and the masters on the
other, do certainly ex-
hibit themselves under
circumstances which
render them peculiarly
comparable, respec-
tively, to ganders and
geese. In reference to
both sides MR. TuR-
NER was very happy in
the remark that what
is good for the goose
is good for the gander.
He would, however,
have been much hap-
pier if he had observed
that what was bad for
the goose was bad for
the gander, and if
employers and employed could perceive that combination is equally bad for gander and for

If you would wish to have a good servant—
one that is faithful, honest, and attentive, and
whom you will never quarrel with ; one that will
never bother you for wages, nor drink your wine

A CONCORDAT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
THAT special statesman the O'Donoghue, the other evening, in a
brilliant speech, most luminously pointed out a tremendous mistake
under, which LoRD PALMERStöN and LoRD JoHN Russell, have
been labouring, throughout their respective careers. , Erin's bright
particular star, before whose name the definite article stands for Mr.,
is reported to have said that iſ
“The noble Lord at the head of the Government and the noble Minister for
Foreign Affairs were still in pursuit of a phantom which had been the fixed idea of
all their lives. ...That idea was ostensibly the destruction of the temporal power of
the Pope, while in reality they had sought the destruction of the Catholic religion
all over the world. (Hear.)"
Hibernia's distinguished son also administered a fine rebuke to MR.
GLADSTONE:-
“He had listened with great pain to the speech of the CHANcellor of THE
Exchequen, (hear, hear!) and as one who professed the Catholic religion, he should
be sorry to have to sit on the same side of the house with, or even near to that right
honourable gentleman. (Hear, hear, and a laugh.)”
The laugh was probably a tribute to the humour which insinuated
MR. GLADSTONE to be a pestilent heretic. Heresy, so rank as that of
the ultra Protestant representative of Qxford, the G'Donoghue
jocosely treated as contagious. Of course he could not have seriously
feared that he might contract, the disease himself in consequence of
going too near the infected Minister, although, by pitching into that
great Homeric scholar, he ran some risk of catching it. However,
as it was, he utterly demolished him, by the subjoined crushing
refutation:—
“The right honourable gentleman said, at least in effect, that the people of the
Papal dominions were chained to the earth. Now, that was not true. It was a
statement which was not founded in fact. It was contradicted by the condition of
the ple, and every one who was acquainted with or had travelled in those
dominions must admit that, in a temporal sense, there did not exist in the world a
more popular Sovereign than Pius THE NINTH. (Hear, and a laugh.)”
Qf course this shut up MR. GLApstone, but not only that; it also
enforced conviction on LöRp JQHN himself, whom we find subsequently
making the following remarkable concession, and confession of faith-
a faith which the O'Donoghue will of course recognise as the faith,
or, in other words, the cheese:—
“I believe that if you allow the
(hear, hear), and that is the doctrine w
F. of Italy to settle their own concerns
ch my noble friend and myself have always
held in this house, especially during the whole course of the present Session—if you
allow the people of Italy, whether they have hitherto lived under the rule of the
KING of SARDIN1A, or of the GRAND DUKE of Tuscany, or of the DUKE of MoDENA,
under the Pope, or under the KING of THE Two Sicilies, to settle with their Sove-
reigns on what terms they shall pay their allegiance, there will no longer exist the
irritation and discontent which has long prevailed, but they will proceed with
peace and order to establish the foundations of good Government."
What articles of belief can be more satisfactory to the O'Donoghue
than the foregoing Credo º LoRD, John Russell, believes that the
subjects of the Porº ought to be left to settle their own affairs with
their Sovereign. The O'Donoghue says that Pigs The NINTH is as
popular a Sovereign as any in the world. What better plan then for
maintaining the Pope's sovereignty can he imagine than that of allowing
it simply to rest on the broad and firm basis of popularity?, The with-
drawal of all foreign troops, therefore, from the papal states, will as
exactly effect the end desired by the O'Donoghue as it will answer
the purpose of LoRD JoHN RUSSELL.

[AUGUST 20, 1859.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SERPENTINE THROUGH A SIEVE.
OME slight inconve-
nience is likely to
attend the ingenious
plan for cleansing
the Serpentine advo.
cated, and about to
be adopted by MR.
fitzno. If the Šer.
pentine is to be fil-
tered, and there is
any filth in the Ser-
pentine, the filth must
collect on the filter.
If the filter is to
occupy nearly an acre
of ground, a great
quantity of filth will
be deposited on a
considerable surface.
If this extent of filth
is to be occasionally
exposed to the sun,
it will reek a little,
evolve a few rather
nasty gases in certain
quantities, and per-
haps engender some
fever. -
Modern chemistry
enables the perfumer
to extract the sweet-
est scents from the
foulest dregs, dross,
sediment, sweepings,
rubbish, lees, refuse,
and unspeakable orts.
The residuary stuff
of gas-works, – the
nasty pitch and tar, and their graveolent kindred hydrocarbons, may, however, be men-
tioned. , Perhaps, some profound chemist will inform. MR. FitzRoy of a process, by which
the mud of the Serpentine, collected on a filter, may be, not, indeed, deodorised, but trans-
muted into an odoriferous substance, which may be carted away in the day-time, diffusing
a fragrance like that of jessamine, violets, syringa, or otto of roses. .. -
First, however, catch your fish. Collect your filth—if the Serpentine contains any. MR.
STEPHENson seems to think, not much:—
“He was in the habit of riding almost daily by that river, and he must say that during the last three, or
four years he had perceived nothing so ... to his olfactory nerves as to lead him to coincide in the
outcry which had recently been raised. (Hear, hear.) He believed the outcry was entirely unfounded,
because, whatever the state of the Serpentine had been, it was not now to the best of his judgment in an
offensive condition.”
Perhaps, MR. STEPHENsoN, because, as Grandmother Shandy observed, “you have
little or no nose, Sir.” The Serpentine looks, at least, like soup, if it has no smell. ..MR.
FITzRoy, however, is catching his fish, according to the continued statement of our eminent
engineer:-
“Supposing, however, that the water was impure, the question was, how the nuisance should be reme:
died. The Serpentine was a stagnant lake (hear), and the other day, in riding along the banks, he observed
that a quantity of lime was being poured into the water. The consequence of this proceeding was, that he
saw dead fish floating on the surface, and occasioning the most offensive decomposition.”
Thus, MR. FITzRoy is turning the water of the .. into limewater, and killing all
the fish. So that he is catching his fish both literally and figuratively; he is poisoning
the roach and dace, and creating filth in the Serpentine; dead fish, occasioning, as MR.
STEPHENson says, “the most offensive decomposition,” and doubtless exhaling “a most
ancient and fish-like smell.” - - - -
If there had been no filth in the Serpentine, there was no occasion to put any lime in it,
particularly since the lime causes more filth than it cures. The same circumstance may be
considered to render steam-pumps and filtering-tanks unnecessary.
According to MR. FITzRoy :—
“Two questions which were quite independent of one another had been mixed up in this discussion, the
first relating to the mud at the bottom of the river, and the second with respect to the water itself.”
In discussing tea, two questions are, in exactly the same manner, mixed up, which are
as entirely independent of each other as the water of the Serpentine and the mud at the
bottom of it. The tea is mixed up with the hot water which is poured thereon, although the
tea-leaves have settled at the bottom of the º Infusion after infusion of hot water at
length extracts all the goodness of the tea; and in the same way, MR. FITzRoy appears to
think, washing after, washing will remove all the nastiness of the Serpentine. Some time
may be occupied in this process, as the dirty bed of the Serpentine is to be washed by driblets,
with its own filtered water. - -
In preference to filtering the Serpentine, MR. FitzRoy might, perhaps, as well leave it
alone, and, instead of throwing lime into it, stock it with eels. They would assimilate
its organic impurities, which, in the substance of eel, might ultimately * in the shape
of stew, or spitchcock, affording abundant nutriment to thousands. But if the filtration of
our great, fashionable pond is to be carried
out, it will be necessary to consume the muddy
remainder by some more expeditious means, if
it cannot, be sweetened by the aid of science.
Let a sufficient number of ducks be provided to
eat up all the mud, a measure which every old
woman, and, every child knows will prove infal.
lible. The birds will soon pay their expenses:
Bayswater will smell of nothing worse than sage
and onions; and SIR Joseph PAxton will acknow-
ledge the mistake he made in opposing the grand
project for purifying the Serpentine.
ONE HUMBUG THE LESS.
WE are glad to state, that one little concession
has been paid to the British Press, by the removal
of an absurd form that was of no legal, or moral,
good whatever. Formerly there existed a mock
ceremony that imposed on a paper the necessity
of making out securities to the extent of £300 or
£500, and the trouble consequent on that º:
lation was almost endless. Many a name of a
respectable referee had to be given before the
punctilious official would be satisfied with his
solvency. This exaction of security was all the
more nonsensical, inasmuch as Somerset House
never by any accident gave credit. Not a penny
stamp would it advance, in spite of all your secu-
rities, unless the Fº was previously laid down
on the counter for it. The Connaught Patriot
now informs us that this harassing process has
been done away with ; and we beg most unfeign-
edly to compliment Somerset House on the won-
derful display of good sense that has prompted
the removal. It is so much the less red tape in
one of our government offices. All parties will
move and breathe, the more freely for being
relieved of the useless trammel. After all, the
real security of the press is in the truth, talent,
and respectability with which it is conducted.
The public are the best judges and guardians for
seeing that those conditions are always conscien-
tiously complied with, and they know now to
inflict the heaviest penalty by no longer coun-
tenancing the paper that does not act up
honourably to the spirit of them. A warning,
far more effectual than any that could emanate
from a minister's office, is a falling circulation.
A MILD COURTIMARTIAL.
THE following, from the “Military and Naval
Intelligence” in the Times, is a remarkable sen-
tence. It is the sentence of a Court Martial on
one HENRY PRESTON, a Sapper of the Royal
Engineers, for desertion:—
“The Court, in consideration of his former character,
sentenced him to be marked on the body with the letter
“D," and to be imprisoned in Fort Clarence for 56 days.”
Eight weeks, imprisonment for desertion is a
merciful punishment; ... and instead of having
been merely marked with a letter on his body,
Sapper PRESTON, might have had, his back
scored with fifty lashes. He certainly had very
lenient judges, the rather inasmuch as he was
sentenced to be marked with “D’’ for Deserter,
in consideration of his former character /
An Extravagant Notion.
CIVILITY, they º, costs nothing, and yet
looking at the Civil Estimates, and the enor-
mous sums annually disposed of under them,
we should say that it was a very expensive
article. It is fortunate that they are “Civil,”
or else perhaps John BULL would not put .#
so quietly with them. We have always notice
that when it comes to a question of spending
money, what a remarkably Civil Estimate Minis-
ters do take of poor old JoHN, to be sure!

THE MAUWE MEASLES.
LovEIy woman is just now afflicted with a malady which apparently
is spreading to so serious an extent that it is high time to consider by
what means it ºy be checked. As the complaint is ". a new one,
doctors disagree of course as to its origin and nature. There are man
who regard it as of purely English growth, and from the effect which
it produces on the mind contend it must be treated as a form of mild
insanity. Other learned men, however, including Dr. Punch, are dis-
posed rather to view it as a kind of epidemic, and to ascribe its º
entirely to the French. Although the mind is certainly affected by
the malady, it is chiefly on the body that its effects are noticeable: and
having most maturely considered the complaint, Dr. Punch is of opinion
that it is not so much a mania as a species of measles.
e main reason which inclines Dr. Punch to this opinion is, that
one of the first symptoms by which the malady declares itself consists
in the eruption of a measly rash of ribbons, about the head and neck
of the person who has ºf t it. The eruption, which is of a mauve
colour, soon spreads, until in some cases the sufferer becomes com-
pletely covered with it. Arms, hands, and even feet are rapidly
disfigured by the one prevailing hue, and, strange as it may seem, the
face even looks tinted with it. Like the other form of measles, the
mauve complaint is very catching: indeed, cases might be cited, where
the lady of the house having taken the infection, all the family have
caught it before the week was out. Although its ravages are principally
among the weaker sex, there are several of the stronger who are sub-
ject, to the malady; but with these, the mauve measles assumes a
milder form, and in general one good dose of ridicule will cure it.
It being his desire to check the progress of the malady, Dr. Punch
has held several consultations with himself to determine on what
course of treatment to prescribe for it. There are for certain epidemics
some specific forms of cure, but for the mauve measles none as yet have
been discovered. Where the measles º springs, as in some cases
it does, from a slight determination of le. Follet to the head, a cure
may often be effected by removing for a while the cause of the infec-
tion, and by providing for the patient a more healthy mental stimulant.
In severe cases, however, such a course is not sufficient; and although
the application of the knife may be avoided, there is found not seldom
need to use the scissors. , Married ladies have been cured by amputa-
tion of their pin-money; but this is a strong course, and except in
extreme cases, Dr. Punch would not advise it. Actual cautery, or
burning, has likewise been resorted to; but when applied to a new
dress this is a costly form of treatment, and husbands who have tried
it, have been known to burn their fingers. Moreover, it may lead to
inflammation of the temper, and this is generally with ladies most
troublesome to cure.
Dr. Punch therefore prescribes a milder course of treatment, and
recommends that when the symptoms of the mauve measles first show
themselves, a gentle dose of reasoning at once should be exhibited,
with the view of ascertaining if the mind be much affected. Confine:
ment to the house is a most excellent corrective, and where it is found
racticable, should always be persisted in., Total abstinence from
#. must be rigidly insisted on, for these exciting stimulants
foster the disease, and indulgence in them therefore is strongly to
be deprecated. The same caution applies, to milliners' and bonnet
shops, which, being infected places, should just now be marked as
“Dangerous.” . .
Dr. Punch is not a quack, and he therefore never puffs himself; but
in the interests of womanity, Dr. Punch may briefly state that, treating
the mauve measles as a form of mental weakness, the best medicine to
g. for it is the invigorating tonic, which is exhibited in Fleet
treet every week by Dr. Punch.
MONSIEUR “ BOUNCE.”
THE champagne which was drank the other day on the Great Eastern
has set everybody talking of her progress towards completion, and
much anxiety is felt as to when and whither her trial trip will be, and
who will be the persons favoured with a passage; As Punch never
stoops to publish exclusive information acquired by sneaking down
back staircases and listening at key-holes, he will not say one word
about the two first of these questions, however much, it may be in his
power now to do it. With regard though to the third, the name of
one of the chief passengers has already been made public, and Punch
therefore breaks no secrecy in publicly commenting on it. . In the first
line of the Times' second column of last Friday, it is stated in big
letters that:—
Bounce IS GOING OUT IN THE BIG SHIP.
Well, but who is “Bounce?” some reader may exclaim. “Bounce”
must be of course a nom de guerre, or nickname. Who then is the
person it is meant to represent *
On most points such as these, there is no need now to be mute.
The reader having brains (or he would not be reading Punch) may by
using them and turning to a part of the same. Times, very, easily
discover the real name of “Bounce.” As a portion, of the Foreign
Correspondence in that Paper, the following big words are printed in
small type:—
“At the present day there exists not in the world an army at once better pro-
vided, better administered, better fed, better kept, better instructed, or braver than
ours; and when once there shall have been completed the service of maritime
transports, which will E. the unexpected throwing of a corps d'armée ºn a point
of the enemy's shore, the enemies of France, or those who are jealous of her, will
have to think twice before provoking her."
The writer of these words is Monsieur GRANIER DE, CASSAGNAG;
and it clearly must be he who announces, as above, that he will sail in
the Big Ship under the pseudonym of “Bounce.” Great men are not
often users of big words, and to our mind, Monsºuk GRANIER but
dwarfs himself by using them. Little minds not seldom are implanted
in large bodies: #. if the body of Monsieur be equal to his bounce,
we should say that the Big Ship would not be big enough to hold him.

WHAT a set of fools the Pop E must think the sovereigns and
ministers of Europe, at whom he has launched a circular, signed by his
Secretary of . State, CARDINAL ANTONELLI, informing them, with
reference to the interferences of the Sardinian Government with the
Pontifical tyranny, that—
“All the measures taken with the view of preventing or extenuating this series
of evils having been in vain, the Holy Father, not forgetful of the duties incumbent
P. him for the protection of the States and for the preservation in its integrity
of the temporal domain of the Holy See, which is essentially connected with the
free and independent exercise of the Sovereign Pontificate, protests against the
violations and usurpations committed in spite of the acceptance of neutrality, and
desires that his protest may be communicated to the European Powers.”
Really, one º almost imagine, that his Holiness and his
Eminence regarded the European Princes and Cabinets in exactly
such a light as that in which a titular Irish bishop views the most
º: og-trotter in his diocese, and moreover imagined themselves
able to palm off upon them just such absurd and monstrous humbug as
the mitred impostors of Erin are accustomed to address to the natives
of the Emerald Isle. It is difficult to conceive how they can have the
coolness, not only to assert that the º domain of the Holy See
is essentially connected with the free and independent exercise of the
Sovereign Pontificate, but even to make this assertion by way of
reminder, as if it were acknowledged by all the world. The peasants
who believe that St. PATRICK destroyed the reptiles of their island by
preaching, might, with equal gullibility, receive and swallow the
assurance that the patrimony of St. PETER is a certain extent of
territory which was really and truly held by St. PETER; as, of course
it was, if St. PETER was the first Pope, and if, as Pio'Nono an
ANTONEIL1 aver, the temporal domain of the Holy See is essentially
connected with the free and independent exercise of the Pope's
spiritual office. No human beings less ignorant and less credulous
than those wretched clowns could even listen for a moment to any
such fudge. Surely, therefore, the Pope, and the CARDINAL must
consider the potentates and statesmen, for whose edification they
composed their circular, as blockheads and boobies of the grossest
##". and density. Of course, they cannot for a moment believe
their own statement of the essentiaſ connection of the temporal
possessions and spiritual rule of the Holy See. If anybody else were
to make such a declaration, and maintain it seriously, would they not,
indeed, anathematise him for heresy P
The condemnation of their own Fº in that case would be
consistent inconsistency. It would be quite in keeping with that
Orientalism which mingles in the quality of the Western Church, so
calling itself—with the spice of Sultan which characterises the Pope—
if the imbecile bombast which the Holy Father raves in were not more
like the EMPEROR OF CHINA’s nonsense. In point of reason, justice
and dignity, his Holiness exhibits a curious analogy to the Gran
Signior of other days. Or we may liken the modern Pontiff to the
ancient Caliphs, and look upon ANTONELLI as Pio NoNo's Vizier.
The Past, Present, and Future.
WE sacrifice the Present in regretting the Past that has already
gone, and in tormenting ourselves about the Future that has not yet
come. It is pretty much the same with a Widow. Between the
husband she has lost and the husband she is expecting, her days are
spent in alternately sighing over what she cannot change and what

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN EPICUREAN IN AN ASYLUM.
At Earlswood, near Redhill, there is an Asylum for
Idiots; a place to which the benevolent reader doubt-
less thinks that competent authority ought to send some
Mr. Bouncer, having asserted that he had taken a “Moor," receives a few empty Hampers
as reminders from his friends.
of his acquaintance. The idea of such an institution
which most people entertain is, that it is simply a place of
comfortable confinement; but from an account of a “Visit
to Earlswood,” by the REy. Edwin SIDNEY, it appears that
the asylum there situated is also an abode for the educa-
tion and instruction of the weak and limited intellect.
Thereat is practised, with considerable success, a plan for
making the most of the little mind possessed by the im-
becile; of expanding the contracted understanding, so to
speak, or of blowing the faint spark of mind into as great
a blaze as possible. The instances of the improvement thus
effected, as related by MR. SIDNEY, are very interesting.
Among them may be cited the subjoined. In the basket-
room, where the pupils are taught to make baskets of
wicker-work, he says:-
“Here we asked a diligent little fellow which he liked best, being
there or at home, ‘Happier here," said he. “Why?" was the next
question, and the answer was, ‘Have more to eat, and nobody teases
me."”
This lad may, and we suppose must, have been an idiot
once; but surely he now no longer deserves that appella-
tion, but a very different one. hat ordinary schoolboy,
questioned about happiness, could have expressed his sen-
timents on that subject better, or would have had any
other, at least any other more elevated, sentiments to
.#. A wiser reply could not be expected from the
collective wisdom of the City of London, the Aldermen
and Common-Councilmen in Court assembled. Many a
man who moves in high society, instead of being associated
with idiots; whose club constitutes the asylum to which
he retires, and who thinks himself, perhaps with justice, a
sensible fellow, would, if asked why he preferred that
asylum to home, answer exactly in the spirit, and nearly
in the words, of the above terse and pithy speech from
the mouth of an idiot boy, elevated, by the system of
mental culture, practised at the Earlswood establish-
ment, into a philosopher.
How To KEEP Food on A WEAK Stomach.-Bolt it down.
HOW WE SPEND OUR SUNDAYS,
WHAT a mistake it is for foreigners to find fault, as they do, with
our observance of the Sabbath. They say that Sunday, as we keep it,
is the dullest day on earth, a day which tempts to suicide as a way of
killing time. Triste people as we are, we never are so triste as we
always are on Sundays. we do on Sunday is, to go to church, and
dine, and go to church, and go to bed. Other occupations we have
nationally none, excepting when we cut our throats for the mere sake
of amusement.
Of course every English reader knows how false are these impressions,
but it is not every Englishman who knows the full extent of our enjoy-
ment of our Sundays; and though ignorance in this may individuall
be bliss, it is nationally advisable to struggle for enlightenment.
case which came on at the Mansion House a day or two ago, throws a
policeman's bull's-eye light on our observance of the Sabbath; and
those who are in the dark perhaps the flash may somewhat startle.
Foreigners who ask how we amuse ourselves on Sunday, should listen
to the evidence of Policeman Six-One-Six:—
“I was in Houndsditch, and I heard a row, and upon going to Fireball Court I
found the inhabitants, according to their usual practice on Sunday evenings, fightin
by dozens together like cats and dogs, and tumbling over one another. f: is .#
ful to witness such scenes as take place there, and the prisoner was the worst of the

been fighting that night, so I took him into custody.”
Tumbling, getting drunk, and fighting like a lot of cats and dogs,
these are now our “usual” Sunday evening practices. This is how on
Sundays we amuse ourselves at Court, that is to say, at Fireball
Qourt; and we have many more, such Fireballs. Moreover, mark,
O Foreigner, these Sunday occupations are not illicit pleasures. They
are sanctioned by our law, and only in extreme cases are they stopped
by the Police. Mark the logic in the evidence of Policeman §§.

night, so [observe the 'º. I took him into custody.” One scrim-
mage per night, then, is the legalised allowance. Anything beyond it
is a breaking of the Sabbath, and put down as an excess.
But Punch has no cause to complain of Policeman Six-One-Six. As
he had been taught it, he doubtless did his duty. The question is,
however, are the nation doing theirs? Might not something more be
done to stop, the “usual practice” of fighting upon Sundays than
simply stopping would-be combatants from indu §: in it twice P
Might not other occupations be publicly devised for Sunday afternoons,
which would in some measure prevent these “usual” evening practices?
For instance, would it not be well to try the effect of opening harmless
places of amusement, by which those not quite so innocuous might be
ossibly shut up? The pastime of inspecting, say, the Crystal Palace
ourts, would . surely a not more harmful amusement for a Sunda
than the legalised amusement of street tumbling and fighting, whic
are the “usual” recreations in such courts as Fireball Court.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OMETHING really must
be done to stop the
Z practice of punning
which has of late be-
come so scandalously
prevalent in Parlia-
ment. It is not very
often that we wade
through a debate, but
when we do, we are
sure to find it brist.
ling with bad jokes,
such as even the most
shameless of burlesque
writers would blush
at. The reporters, we
believe, do the utmost
= in their power to
suppress such painful
matter, and struggle
nobly to preserve the
= reputation of our
senators: but in spite
of all their vigilance,
; scarcely ever a Times
passes without afford-
ing the most melan-
choly proofs of the
low state to which
the wits of our “Col-
: lective Wisdom” are
reduced. No sooner
does a Member get

making a JoEMILLER

they perpetrate, like circus clowns, the ancientest of jests; and so insane are the attempts at b
joking which are made, that the speakers seem less fitted for St.Stephen's than St. Luke's.
As we of course have no desire to nauseate our readers, we will but cite one extract from
the evidence before us, to show what grounds we have for making these assertions, and to
In a debate
prove with how much levity subjects the most .# §: commonly ...; t d t
. UAYLEY is repor O nave Stooped to
the other night upon the Civil Service Estimates,
utter this:—
“As to the talk about bad air, before they could hope to see any improvement in the ventilation of the
House, he would say, with the venerable MRs. GLAssE, first catch your hare.” (A laugh.)” -
Readers who survive this may incline to moot the point as to whether his consti-
tuents should not wait on MR. CAYLEY to demand from him some sort of explanation of
his joke. . The question also may be mooted, as to whether a committee should not sit
upon such punsters, with the view of ascertaining the condition of their intellect, and
requiring, on occasion, their acceptance of strait waistcoats and vacation of their seats.
What makes the matter worse (if puns so bad are capable of any pejoration), is that so
far from condemning, the House laughs at the offenders, and º, shakes its sides where
it ought to shake its fist. Besides, as we have shown, the levities are not confined to
matters of light consequence. The ventilation of the House is no joke to those who suffer
from it; yet the CAYLEYs do not hesitate to try to make a joke of it. They trifle with it as
though it were a “trifle light as air,” instead of being as it is, a “heavy blow and sore
discouragement” to all the throats which are exposed to it.
We recoil with awe, from fancying what HANSARD will grow like, unless some measures
be devised to check this painful practice. Just conceive what wretched lives will be led
by the reporters, when a debate upon a question of deep national momentousness—such as
the proposal of a peerage, or a pension, say, for Punch—is proceeded with in some such a
facetious way as this:—
“LORD PALMERSTON then rose, in pursuance of his notice, to move a vote of thanks to,
and of confidence in, Punch. His Lordship said the claims of Punch were so well known,
that no one but a spoon or a SPOONER was not conscious of them. (Hear!) Were he to
mention, for example, how often Punch had saved the country, he should merely be
repeating what everybody knew: and though, as Premier, it was his place to be a watch
upon the House, there, in this case was no need for him to act as a repeater. (A laugh.) He
( }. PALMERSTON) knew full well what Punch had done for him, and he trusted he knew
better than to wish to do for’ Punch. He proposed therefore, in order to lengthen Punch's
life, to present him with a pension, which would no doubt effect that purpose. (Hear!)
Previty, they knew, was called the soul of wit; but this was clearly a misnomer, for the soul
of wit, in fact the sole wit, now was Punch, (hear, hear /) and, not being a lawyer, Punch
had nothing of the brief about him. (Laughter.) eople very often wished that so-called
‘wits' would cut it short: but so far from 1. wishing that Punch should be cut short,
cvery one who knew him longed to see him longer. Besides voting him their confidence,
which was a mere matter of course, the nation therefore plainly should present Punch with
a º; (hear, hear!), which would ensure him
a long life, and, there was no doubt, a merry one.
(Cheers).
“LORD JoHN RUSSELL had intended to pla
nothing but first fiddle, but his respect for Pine
ersuaded him to second his friend's motion.
Hear!) He thought, though, that a pension
was a worldly-minded present; and although no
doubt a tribute which his friend would not de-
cline (oh, oh!), still it was not one that was
suited to a mind of more refinement, such as
his (LORD º or as he dared say, that of
Punch. (Hear!) He begged therefore to pro-
pose the erection of a statue (oh, oh!) as a gift
more in accordance with our ancient British
usage, which when an author wanted bread
made him the present of a stone. (Question /
and cries % “name /*) Now Punch was not in
want of bread, and bread therefore was not
kneaded (the noble Lord pronounced this so that
thirteen Members tittered); but the erection of a
statue was strictly constitutional, and would
show that, as regards our rewards to men of
genius, we did as our ancestors, and were still
in statue quo. (Laughter.)
“SIR BULwer Lytton said, that speaking for
himself, he agreed that writers now-a-days were
not in knead of bread. (A laugh.) But when we
make a man a statue, he became a sort of butt,
and another sort of butt would be a more be:
fitting present. To use the language of antiquity,
he would just remind his hearers that Gloria
claret. Claret, glorious old claret, clarified the
wits, and a butt of claret therefore was a fitting
gift for Punch. (Hear!)
“MR. Roebuck said his tastes inclined to
something sourer. He would say with HoRACE,
‘Hockerat in Votis.’ His advice to Punch was,
in two words, ‘Accipe Hock.”
“MR. HADFIELD remarked, that he had learned
another bit of Latin when at school, and his
imbibing it had biassed his bibations ever since.
He had forgotten whether JUVENAL or HoMER
were the author, but the quotation, he remem-
ered, ran in these three words, ‘Fortiter occu
portum, which, as he translated it, meant ‘Stick
to Forty Port". He proposed the presentation
of a pipe of this to Punch, as the pilot who so
often, when the Government were all at sea, had
brought them into port. (Cheers.)
“An honourable Member, whose name we
could not catch, recommended the addition of a
ton of prºmº cigars, on the ground of the old
axiom, ‘Erfumo dare lucem,” meaning that Punch
can draw enlightenment even from his smoke.
“MR. DISRAELI had no wish that the debate
should end in smoke. (Laughter.) As a literar
man, he wished to see his friend Punch we
rewarded for his works (cheers); and he agreed
with his friend PAM (who, though he was not
of the craft, knew more of its requirements than
his friend Jonny, who was), that to a well-read
man of letters there were no letters more grateful
than the trio £ s. d. (A laugh.)
“MR. BRIGHT observed, that this was a blunt
way of putting it (laughter), but being a plain
man he was a lover of plain speaking. . As a
business man, he always º a sharp eye for the
blunt (great laughter), and he for one would not
refuse a pension were, it offered him, ‘Hold
thyself ever ready for the pouching of the ready”

(MR. WILLIAMs) would not object to sanction some less costly form
of tribute. As blending use with ornament, he would, suggest the
resentation of a penny china mug, with the inscription, “For a Good

“Several Members rose in wrath at the economist's suggestion, and

his fist, and delivers a blow upon her forehead, the mark being visible

self,” whereas the valiant Righahi, WILson himself admitted the blow,
but stated that he struck in “self defence.” The friendly fishmonger's
devotion carried him to the verge of scaliness.
SoLOMON BUTLER, a gun-maker, of Stepney, is going home at one
o'clock in the morning, and taking offence at some alleged conduct on
the part of a woman called SARAH Hudson, imitates MR. RICHARD
WILson, and gives her such a blow that her mouth is swollen (says the
report) when she makes her complaint. Persons of the neighbourhood
are vulgar enough to feel indignation at MR. BUTLER's behaviour, and
— - -
make a clamour about his door, at which some of them throw stones.
He comes out with a gun, which he “levels and fires in the direction of
the crowd,” and into the face of Policeman SMITH, 253 K. There was
only wadding besides the powder in the gun; and though wadding
often knocks an eye out, it ſuckily did not do so in this case.
MR. SolomoN BUTLER had no faithful fishmonger PIMM to come and
swear that the gun went off of itself, or was not loaded at all, or that
there was no gun; but he has an attorney, who assured the Magistrate
that MR. BUTLER was a well-behaved and well-conducted man.
The two Magistrates who heard the two cases acted to the best of
their judgment. The clerk was fined Four, Pounds, which was
instantly, paid...Mr. Punch does not read that any remark was
addressed to faithful fishmonger PIMM touching his Pythias-like
devotion. The gun-maker was ordered to compensate SARAH Hudson,
and he made it all right for Ten Shillings. -
Mr. Punch is not inclined to blame either of the admirable Magis-
trates. He has fre º had to praise both, thereby elevating them
to the topmost height of human ambition. But he wants to suggest
that there should be a regular tº: of charges for smashing the faces
of woman, If... it were right to make the Casino patron pay Four
Pounds, why did the Stepney party get off for Ten Shillings'? ... Next,
it occurs to him, that if it were right that SARAH should receive the
Ten Shillings, *} should not CATHERINE have had the Four Pounds.
Lastly, and in reference to both cases, why had not the Magistrates
the power of ordering MR. RICHARD Wilson and MR. Solomon
BUTLER into the yards of the respective courts, and instructing an
able-bodied gaoler then and there to endorse upon the backs of the said
WILSON .#BUTLER a few mild memoranda to the effect that female
foreheads, and, notably, female lips, were made for yery different pur-
poses than to be smashed into by cowards? It is for such persons,
and their like alone, that Mr. Punch, devising other punishments for
gº; but brave fellows, would preserve the “harmless necessary
at.”
The gun, and friendly fishmonger PIMM, seem alike to have been let
off without other notice, so no more upon that score; and Mr. Punch
will merely, make PolicEMAN SMITH, K 253, happy for life by con:
gratulating him on not going with his Oculus Er. His inspector will
translate this to him.

WHILE THEY ARE AT SCARBOROUGH, PATERFAMILLAS THINKS HIS LITTLE ONES OUGHT TO LOSE NO
OPPORTUNITY OF DRINKING THE WATERS -
THE NINE HOURS’ FIX.
THE Nine Hours’ Movement is a misnomer. What is called a
movement has been a stand-still, and, instead of nine hours, has occu-
F. many days, during all which time the progress of building has
een arrested. The only movement that has been made, whether by
masters or men, is one of some distance on the line to ruin, -aterminus
to which sufficient F. in the strike would carry both parties.
The ..". of anybody who has the slightest idea of justice must
be deci º with the men. They are perfectly right in wishing to
receive ten hours' wages for working nine hours. They would be per-
fectly right in wishing to work the shortest possible time for the
ſº possible amount of wages. They have a perfect right to com-
ine for the attainment of these objects, and are not greatly to be
blamed if they make faces and cast reproaches at such of their mates
as refuse to join their combination. Besides, it is desirable for the
public good that their hours of labour should be lessened, and their
means of living should be even increased. Less work and more pay
would enable them to learn the fiddle, or anything else better calcu-
lated to cultivate and improve the mind, whereby they would become
still more orderly and well conducted than they are already; and then
they would be enabled to put money in the Savings' Bank, -or why
not in DRUMMOND's 2–to the diminution of pauperism, and therefore
of poor's rates. -
At the same time, everybody who knows what equity means must
sympathise with the masters. They have an unquestionable right to
make the greatest possible amount of profit on their capital. They are
fairly entitled to give the minimum of wages that a workman will
accept for the mazimum of labour that he will return. They are justly
at liberty to eat. turtle and venison, drink champagne, keep boxes at
the Opera, ride in c es, or enjoy themselves in any other legal
way, on the proceeds of their business, as much as they please. They
are free, if not bound, to give their children the best education they can.
They ought to have large balances at their bankers, wherewithal to
mcet accidents and reverses of trade, otherwise they would be liable at
any time to be ruined, and disabled from .# any workmen at
all. Moreover, if the sums which they spend in self-gratification were
spread over their workmen in additional wages, the increase for each
workman would be a ridiculous fraction. -
Both parties being thus equally in the right, neither can, in con-
science, own themselves to be in the wrong. At this rate, the Nine
Hours' Movement—such a movement as it is—must continue till the
course of the masters ends in the Gazette, and that of the men in the
workhouse. This prospect seems rather to suggest the expediency of
a compromise.
The Early Closing Movement was a movement indeed—a movement
ahead, not backwards, or downwards and deucewards. Tremendous
sacrifices, and awful and heartrending bankruptcies, and alarming
failures, have since been announced in the drapery line, but none of
them have been ascribed to Early ºf -
Why cannot bricklayers' work, as well as drapers' business, be com;
º within a shortened space of time—a space of time shortened
y only one hour? Could not the masters, on the one hand, concede
the time required, and the men, on the other, ensure the requisite
work? Touching one hand and the other hand, by the way, is there not
some exceedingly Protectionistical arrangement existing among brick-
ayers, prohibiting a skilled workman, from using, both hands, by
forbidding him to put down, his trowel? This device for extending
employment by literally crippling industry, if it exists, is really worthy
of the landed aristocracy. 8. not a little nonsense of this sort be
sacrificed by the men, and sixty minutes in return be granted by the
masters, without any loss on either side, but, on the contrary, to the
satisfaction of both parties?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CUT FOR A CRITIC'S PENCIL.
ND - for your reading and
writing, saith our friend
ſº “let that appear
when there is no occasion
for such vanity.”
Our friend the Athenaeum,
thought by those who admire
it not (somewhat of a ma-
jority, but let that pass), to
e a sort of literary Dog-
berry, is faithful to the coun-
sel of its º,
One DANIEL MACLISE (a
name that hath been heard
of, though assuredly not
through any self-assertion
of its owner, singularly
ungifted with the instinct
that asks critics to dinner,
and with its pastry buys
their puffs) has for a couple
of years, or thereat, been
quietly accomplishing a mar-
vel in art. #. the Royal
Gallery, in the Parliament
House, he has prepared a
work, vast in its actual size,
but a hundred times waster
- in its greatness of thought.
Wellington meets Blucher, date Waterloo. The cartoon for the fresco has
been set up, and the artists have visited it. And such has been their
honest, and hearty, and artist-like admiration, that Daniel come to
Judgment of his Peers has been received with a shout of applause, and
all the other men who make our Age of Art have taken MACHISE cor-
dially, by the hand and thanked him for his work: . And though he was
not likely to forget those thanks, they placed in his studio a memorial
of their visit, a trifle in its price, a treasure in its purpose. Artists'
chalk is held in a kind of nippers, which the French very properly call
a Porte-Crayon, from porter to hold, and craie, chalk; and this, in gold,
the artists of England presented to DANIEL MACLISE, in memory of his
having shown them his noble cartoon.
There was none of the Testimonial quackery or vulgarity about it.
They did not keep a subscription list open at a banker's, pledging
themselves that everyman who subscribed should see his name in print.
They did not advertise a eulogy, and whip, up contributors who, from
circumstances, dared not refuse money they grudged. They simply
went and bought the little, thing, and made it a great one by what it
implied. And they did not even send the announcement of what they
d done to the Papers, seeing that DANIEI, MACLISE has nothing to
gain by the Yºuding adjectives of penny-a-liners or the approving grin
of gobemouches.
Nevertheless, (for what deed is not now put into print P) the fact
reached the Athenæum, and was duly engraven on its adamantine
columns." But inasmuch as it is the unhappiness of some folk that
they can never speak of a becoming action without a disparagement or
a sneer, the Athenaeum was totally unable to say that the artists of
England had given MACLISE a Porte-Crayon, The recording angel of
the Athenæum looked down from his, altitudes, and gaye a becoming
snub to painters who dared to act without his leave. He º: upon
these audacious painters the bitter sarcasm of stating, that they ;
łºwledged MR. MACLISE's great merits by giving him a Pencil-
aSe.
How they must writhe, SIR Edwin, and STANFIELD, and DAVID
Roberts, and Egg, and CREswick, and the rest of them. A Pencil-
Case! Cieur / you may notoriously buy that in albata for eightpence,
in silver for half-a-crown, in gold for a few shillings more. A paltry
Pencil-Case! Why, the mere subscriptions screwed out of the §.
girls give something better than that to a beloved manager. A Pencil-
Case! As hath been said, how the painters must writhel
Nay, somebody having taken the .# º trouble to set the
Athenaeum right (or the latter º at he had), the opportunity is
snatched (or made) for a second, withering sneer. The Athenaeum has
looked into the Dictionary, and insists that Porte-Crayon does mean a
Pencil-Case. Dogberry comes out with his reading and writing, and
refuses to be set right, happy to repeat his biting sarcasm. A Pencil-
ase—a lead pencil-case, for Dogberry sticks to the lead.
We all know what Dogberry desired to be written down. His desire
was unfulfilled. The Athenæum is happier, and happiest, (as in every
day life, we all are,) in the *. eing self procured. A Porte-
Crayon is not a pencil-case in the ordinary use of language, any more
than Porte-manteau means a cloak-bearer. The word Porte-Crayon
means exactly what has been said, a º: for chalk, and its being
called a pencil-case also means exactly what we have said; namely, that
the Athenaeum wished to sneer at a graceful act of artist-homage, not
perceiving that had the present been a mere cure-dent (which, the
Athenaeum would probably have translated “a dentist”) or a couple of
wrist-studs, the homage would have been equally honouring, and that
the sarcasm is lost in the malice. -
However, it is something that the Athenaeum did not, applaud, the
º and bedaub it with epithetical plaudit, as loyal, and subtle,
and chivalresque, and §§
Finally, does anybody think that Mr. Punch would have condescended
to say a word about such small bosh, but for his being thus enabled to
add his subscription to the Porte-Crayon, ly shouting ab imo pectore,
“Well done, D. MACLISE!” Does anybody? Ha! haſ haſ

RECOLLECTIONS, BY JOSEPH TODGERS.
THE remarkable success of a volume which has lately been published
under the title of Recollections, by Samuel Rogers, has filled Mr.
Punch with envy. And being one of those persons, of whom there are
several, who have no hesitation in º to trade upon the good
fortune of another person's idea, he has been sedulously at work
endeavouring to get up an imitation of the novelty. He has happily
succeeded in securing the MS. of an old gentleman, who, by a curious
coincidence is named Joseph TodgERs, and who is in, the habit of
writing down the smallest remarks made by individuals whom he meets
in society, and whom he conceives to be distinguished. These jottings
are so exactly in the manner of the late poet-banker, MR. Rogers,
that another instance is afforded of the saltatory powers of great wits.

NO SUCH LUCK!
UNDER, the heading of “Bishops on
Strike,” the Dublin Evening Mail says:—
“We have to announce a formidable strike—no
less than a strike of the Roman Catholic hierarch
of Ireland. Yes—the Romish Bishops have struc
en masse for an increase of Popery in the national
schools. . . The strike of the Romish Bishops
is still more formidable than the strike of the build-
ing trades, or even than that of the master-builders.”
What does our Irish contemporary mean
by the strike in which, he says, the titular
Bishops of Ireland have combined? . A
strike of the Roman Catholic hierarchy,
like a strike of the builders, or the tailors,
or any other class of artisans or workmen
is a cessation of work. It is organised
under the direction of their central Chair-
man at Rome, who occupies what they call
the chair of St. Peter. This ecclesiastical
strike, indeed, whenever it has occurred
almost, has been prescribed and dictated
by that Chairman or President of the
Popish Union, at its Centre of Unity, so
called. . In short, the Pope has generally
directed the strike; not, however, by that
name, but under the denomination of Inter-
dict. The observance, however, of the Papal
mandate has always consisted in a regular
strike on the part of the Popish church.
men. The Bishops and the rest of the
Clergy have ceased to perform their func-
tions—a sad thing for people who believed
the performance of those functions indis.
pensable for their preservation from the
jaws of Tartarus. It was a strike en masse
and en messe. Is this the sort of strike
meant by the Dublin Evening Mail? Have
the Irish titular Bishops, authorised by the
Pope, laid Ireland under an interdict be-
cause Popery is insufficiently inculcated
in the national schools? # this be so,
they have acted, Pope, and all, in an ex-
tremely Irish manner, by striking against
their own people because they are dis-
satisfied with the Government, which the
could not possibly gratify by any proceed-
ing so much as by a strike—by a dis-
continuance of the work which a British
Administration would only be too happy
to find substitutes to supply.
Ilifferential Duties.
“Hope,” says Colºripge, “is a Duty.”
We mention this for the information of the
CHANCELLoR of THE ExchequER, so that
he may be down upon Hope, and make it
ay the duty at once. We wonder if the
ope Duty would yield as much as Hops?
AMERICAN OUTRAGT, ON THE EMPEROR.
1T has been said that the Americans admire Louis NAPOLEoN, and
in the event (omen dii avertant) of his supposed interests and those of
England being antagonistic, the former would be favoured by Brother
JonATHAN. Mr. Punch, however, can state upon the best authority,
American authority, that this is not the case. In a leading article in
the New York Herald, now lying before Mr. Punch, are these words:–
“We are seriously of opinion that if Louis NApolfoN were not Emperor of the
French, he would have made a first-rate newspaper Editor. His style is like that
of the American papers.”
Perhaps bitter, savage scorn of a man could hardly be carried further,
and we would not reprint such an insult to the EMPEROR but for the
purpose of showing the extreme contempt in which respectable
Americans appear to hold him. For ourselves, despite many objections
we may have to his Majesty’s antecedents, and relatives (including
PLON-PLON) we by no means think so meanly of him as does the New
York Herald.
ExAction.—The Lawyer's claim when the Action is over.

We read in the Times of August 18th, that one MURRAY, a pick-
pocket, was charged with picking the pocket of
“Mr. Gronoe Stacey, a gentleman living at Richmond while he was walking in the
Commercial Road.”
The feat is accomplished. MR. STACEY is the eighth wonder of the
world, whoever may be the ninth.

POSERS FOR POLICEMEN.
THE|P. of more Income-Tax may incline us to look into our
national expenses; and among the lesser items in the Civil Service
Estimates, we may possibly be somewhat startled to discover that the
bodies of police which weat present are maintaining cost the Govern-
ment last }. above a million of our money. Of this trifle it is shown
that the Irish Constabulary, by a new arrangement, swallowed some
Eight hundred thousand Pounds. But, high as this price seems, no
taxpayer can grumble, when he learns what a superior article we get
for it. The Hibernian Police are not mºrtly men of letters, in the
sense in which we look upon our “A” or “B” divisions. How deeply
they are read may be judged from these tough questions, which have
been put to certain of them by the Government Examiners:—
“Explain fully the meaning of the following geographical terms:—“Peninsula,'
F.". ‘estuary,” “delta,' ‘plateau,” “watershed,' and give three instances
of each. Describe the position of the following places:—St. Helena, St. Albans,
Corfu, Toronto, Salisbury, Copenhagen, Agra, Vienna, Inverary. Singapore, Stirling,
Cairo, Nillala, Meerut, Hastin Owhyhee. Write a geographical description of
any one country of Ancient, Europe, stating its boundaries, physical features,
products, manufactures, divisions, and principal towns.”
Ever friendly as we are to the advance of education, we should
regret to write a word which might in any manner check it. e have
little wish to limit the acquirement of knowledge, or to cause the
slightest stoppage in the onward march of intellect. Ambitious minds,
owever, strive to make such strides of progress that their march
seems to be taken in a pair of seven-leagued boots; and then the odds
are that the marcher goes ahead too rapidly, and skips much useful
knowledge in the leaps and jumps he takes. So long as a policeman
has a knowledge of his business, his possessing other knowledge is no
cause for our complaint. We think, though, when the Government
examines him for service, the Government need only test his serviceable
knowledge. To question a policeman in ancient geography appears to
us about as needful as to puzzle a militiaman with points in mathe-
matics. We should as soon expect the one to know the boundaries of
any ancient European country, as that the other should solve problems
on the differential calculus, or show that he had vows enough to cross
the Asses' Bridge.
With no wish, as we say, to limit their attainments, we think, had
we the office of examining policemen, we should content ourselves
with putting much more simple interrogatories than those which the
“dull season” has just tempted us to quote. Our problems would
assume more practical a form; and instead of asking about promon-
tories and plateaus, our queries would relate to areas and kitchens, and
our questions about places be confined to those of cooks. A knowledge
of to º might be useful to policemen, and we therefore should
...; we had quite a right to test it. . Instead, then, of inquiring
about Agra or Toronto, we should ask for a description of places not
so distant; places where, for instance, hot suppers were provided, and
where a leg of good cold mutton might be always found in cut. A few
queries of this nature might test if the policeman were a man of much
inquiry, or had devoted himself much to culinary pursuits. It might
likewise be of service to get him to describe the cooks he was ºf:
to, dwelling more, especially upon their “physical features,” but not
omitting to describe what “products” in the way of pastry they were
famous for, and, whether any “boundaries” were ever put upon their
perquisites. His visiting-list might be a test of his fidelity, and might
serve to throw some light, perhaps, upon his moral character, as well
as to §: proof of his judgment and good sense. Speaking generally,
we believe that, in the eyes, of a policeman, the charms of cooks are
found not in their persons, but their pantries, and their attractions
consist º in the dainties they dish up. An affection for nice sup-
pers is a weakness with the force; and if her perquisites be handsome,
they will court the plainest cook.
As so considerable a portion of the life of a policeman is passed
in the discharge of culinary duty, it surely is as well to test his fitness
for such service, and to learn as far as may be what experience he has
had in it. Should the Government Examiners wisely act upon this
hint, they are at liberty to use our questions on cookography, which we
really think would prove quite as practically useful as those upon
geography, which in fun have called them forth.

“In a case which occurred, MR. BEARD applied for his costs.
“His Honour: You will have your costs, but I tell you that on and from the 1st
October next, a great many alterations will be made, and I intend to be very strict.
Only a day or two ago I allowed a counsel el 3s.6d., who told me that he did not
consider his case of sufficient importance to appear in costume, but I shall require
not only counsel, but also solicitors to robe, or I shall not allow fees.”
The learned counsel's remark that “he did not consider his case of
sufficient importance to appear in costume” suggests a scheme of new
and improved arrangements respecting legal uniform. When the gen-
tleman of the long robe assigned the unimportance of his case as a
reason for not putting his long robe on, he meant, of course, to imply,
that a certain amount of importance attached to a case did require that
it should be conducted by an advocate attired in that vestment. He
was willing to wear his robe in a matter involving a considerable fee,
but could not do it at £13s.6d. It would have been more satisfac.
tory if he had stated the figure at which he would have thought appear-
ance in professional costume necessary; but suppose a given amount.
The question will then arise whether, if that amount demands robing,
higher amounts ought not to demand more robing, so that the pleader
would be robed with a profusion proportionate to the importance of
his case? This principle might not only be adopted and acted upon in
Sheriff's Courts and County Courts, but also in Nisi Prius, where
something like it is in º already; for there the barristers all
wear wigs, or, if not, they become invisible; the judge cannot see
them, and will not hear them. The standard of the importance of cases
might be either pecuniary or moral, but in proportion either to the
money, or to the moment of the question involved, might be the fulness
and complexity of the costume. The more serious the case, in either
point of view, the more comical the wig and gown might be rendered
the former by additional rows of curls, and lengthened pigtails, an
the latter by fringes, embroidery of various colours, and other equally
or more, ridiculous decorations. Characteristic costumes #: be
worn in special cases; for example, in breach of promise actions,
which are usually laughable, and wherein the counsel might figure in
the drollest dresses, which would be suitable to the suit. The general
rule, however, should be that of absurdity of attire in proportion to
gravity of question, as aforesaid. Usage is a great point in law; the
judge in the Crown Court at Assizes is a much more elaborate Guy
than his learned brother on the Civil side; and when he proceeds to
pass sentence of death, he enacts the solemn absurdity of cocking a
thing like a pen-wiper on the top of his wig.
is one that Mr. Punch may claim the credit of suggesting, which, like
all he ever does, is supereminently powerful and transcendant to all
else. The clinching proof of the advantage of marrying a wife's sister
is, that a man thereby may have a second wife without his having, a
second mother-in-law. The Mamma of his first wife no doubt would
still continue to reside upon his premises, but he would probably have
rown somewhat reconciled and used to her; and her presence would be
arless irksome to put up with than that of a new mother-in-law, whose
temper would be strange to him, and whose tantrums he might find
it plaguy troublesome to cure. Besides, it possibly might chance
(though the contingency is certainly remote from being probable) that
his first wife's mother might have beaten, a retreat, and left him
monarch of all that he surveyed in his own house; in the which case
his felicity would be without alloy, and even Mr. Punch might envy
him his º - -
The only fear would be that, were such unions to be legalised, selfish
husbands might be tempted to make away with their first wives, for
the sake of the delight of marrying again, without having to maintain
another mother-in-law through doing so. Marriage and no mother-in-
law seems really such a luxury, that few men could deny themselves
the pleasure of obtaining it. -
“The mothers who bore us” has been long a standing toast, and all
who sit in Parliament no doubt would gladly drink it. But were “The
mothers-in-law who ‘bore’ us” proposed as the next sentiment, it is
possible that certain of our M.P.'s might not relish it. Had the argu-
ment which Mr. Punch has herein been adducing been used when the
Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Bill was brought before the House
it is doubtful if that measure would not have been carried, an
marriage without a mother-in-law have been legally allowed to us.

a learned society in the

edification of certain tene-
ments (in one of which I
was resident from 1760 to
1765), affixed to them the
designation. of DR. JoHN-
soN's Buildings. The objec-
tion that those buildings are
not mine may occur to the
trivial, but can never dis-
turb the satisfaction of the
candid, and the pretended
lover of Truth should assure
himself that his critique is
dictated by the teachings of
conscientiousness, not prompted by the carpings of ºft -
Ö, isic omnes? It is with pardonable reluctance that I discharge
the duty of indicating an instance of the foible to which, I, ori inally
alluded, but to accept the compliment of the Benchers ºf the Temple
without protesting against its exuberance were to lººdily
unworthy of a man, and an insincerity unbecoming in *. hristian.
*Aware of my’indubitable partiality, for the Latin tongue, the
learned persons who have done me, the honour, to inscribe my name
upon the honorary monument in the Temple, have condescended tº
substitute for the initial of . surname the classical I. With repeated
impropriety the newly erected habitations are twice designated—
DR. IOHNSON'S BUILDINGS.
“Sir, the nomenclature is false and ridiculous, and the absurdity is
rendered still more flagrant by the employment of the English pos-
sessive case. At the commencement of the name no longer mine is
º Latin, and at the concluding extremity is colloquial
English:
“Turpiter atrum
Desinatin piscem mulier formosa superne."
“I might desire that in unsolicited homage regard should be shown
to undissembled affection, and that the mural line commemorating my
humble name should be composed in the language to which the repose
of death has accorded the precision of settlement. In some cell of the
Temple a hand might have been found capable of so simple * task.
futinasmuch as the appellation of the buildings, was destined most
frequently to be employed by the uneducated, and almost invariably by
the English, there would have been inadvertence in bestowing a Latin
name upon a London edifice.
"Of the folly which has now been committed I will, delineate the
ludicrous character by demanding whether the miserable laundress,
circumambient to her sordid toil, replies to an inquiring, acquaintance
that “she is going to Dr.I-on-son's Buildings?” Rationality repudiates
the assumption.” Yet for a majority uninstructed like herself were
those buildings inscribed with my mutilated name. . -

MR. CoBDEN, in his Rochdale speech, talked much and ;:

picture of an M.P. with his head shaved, in Newgate, on bread an

at the Crank, or a LoRD BURY at the Treadmill.
There are some considerations, however, which MR. CoBDEN has,
perhaps, not taken into account in this matter.
Admitting that Electoral corruption is a very deplorable thing; that
the “good and safe men”—who come down to Boroughs at Election
time in false wigs and whiskers, and ensconce themselves in back shops
with bowls of º: and bundles of Bank-notes, wherewith to
- - ms of free and independent electors, are great
rascals; is it clear that this is the worst style of man who influences
the fate of an Election; that the voter, who sells his vote for a couple
of sovereigns and an unlimited allowance of beer, is the worst element
of a constituency; and that the result of an election thus won, is the
Worst Fºl for the country? Upon my word, I am not by any means
sure of lu.
Take the º demagogue, who covers his selfish motives
under a cloak. of patriotic profession; who promises to the crowd
results of political measures which he knows no political measures can
secure; who, ascribes motives wholesale to opponents, sets classes by
the ears, embitters master against man and man against master—it
strikes me, that this mouther is more mischievous than the briber, just
in proportion as he addresses himself to a less venal class of the
electors, and works by #". false and evil thoughts into men's
heads, instead of good and solid sovereigns into their pockets.
Again, I take it that a voter who gives his vote under the influence
of such a man's hustings-talk, is a more mischievous elector, for the
time º; than the stolid freeman, who mechanically barters his sweet
voice for beer or bribe, ºf in proportion as the misled man may be
enthusiastic in his belief of the de -
acceptance of the poisonous error. we are to shave the head of
the briber, what punishment is to be reserved for the conscious
deceiver, humbug, and bunkum-monger of the hustings?
If }}". is to be kept between penalty and offence, it strikes
Mr. Punch, strongly that, the shaved head, the bread and water, the
solitary cell, and the crank, would be at least as well-bestowed on the
rogue who perverts some of our best tendencies and instincts to his
own selfish and dirty ends, as on the buyer, of a certain numner, of
votes, which if not given for money, would still be taken into the market
for some less tangible, perhaps, but not less sordid, consideration.

CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONS.
We understand that the following arithmeticalquestion was recently
set to a candidate for a diplomatic appointment:-
“If four clerks could .# a despatch of twenty-four pages in three
days; how many days would it take six clerks to copy a despatch of
thirty-six pages?”
The candidate finding some difficulty in answering this according to
º ordinary rules of arithmetic, sent up the following diplomatic
reply:—
“With reference to this question, it appears to me that the answer
must depend entirely upon what kind of fellows the clerks were; for
within my own limited experience of the service, I could undertake to
select six who would never finish it at all.”
We are happy to be able to state that the Civil Service Com-
missioners immediately recommended this gentleman to LoRD John
Russell for a Secretaryship of Legation.
ºr MR. Punch begs to acknowledge from BARON BRAMWELL the
receipt of the second half of a Conundrum, marked “Original,” and
numbered “32,567;” but declines, out of respect to the Baron's repu-
tation for facetiousness, according to it the large importance of type in his
illustrious pages. The conundrum in question is not half so funny as any
of the learned Baron's decisions; or it may be that the wrong half has been
sent by mistake? The two halves have been pasted up in Mr. Punch's
office over the counter, as a warning to other culprits who attempt to
pass similar bad conundrums. BARON BRAMWELL is earnestly entreated
not to try again.

A GOVERNESS STRIKE WANTED.
As striking seems infectious, we really almost wonder that the
Governesses jo. Strike. They have certainly more cause for it than
nine-tenths of the workmen who have recently turned out. Few work-
men work harder than do our poor Governesses, and clearly none
receive worse wages for their º The following advertisement will
show the price of Governess-labour as last quoted in the market, and
it seems to us quite low enough to justify a §. :-
Rºº. GOVERNESS WANTED (in the country), who is qua-
lified to educate five children, between the ages of 5 and 14, in the English
courses, with French, music, and drawing, a person above 25 years of age, and
willing to look after the children's wardrobes, preferred. Salary 20 guineas per
annum, with laundry expenses. Apply by letter only to J. B., -Street, Islington.
To educate a “child” of the advanced age of fourteen in English,
French, and music, to say nothing of drawing, could scarcely take less
school-time than full three hours per diem. For a child of five years
old, the schooling might be shorter; but the teaching of five children,
aged between five and fourteen, could hardly average less than quite
ten hours a day, and such hard labour has a claim upon the interest
and the capital) of people who support what is called the Nine Hours
ovement.
The offered wages for this work are one-and-twenty pounds, per
annum, which is about the same as that of upper housemaids and head
cooks. Such ºy is at the rate of not one penny more than eight
shillings a week; dividing this by five, we ascertain that one-and-seven-
F. is the precise cost to the parents of each child's daily schooling.
...; out this reckoning, we omit to count the cost of the resi-
dence and washing; for we look upon these items, as the wages which
are offered for the work of “looking after” what the writer calls the
“wardrobe.” but which, using plainer ºf". we should call the
children's "clothes.” To teach "the English courses” (whatever
they may }} Governess, of course, must be well versed in English;
but we think, however closely she may look into her Dictionary, she
will not learn from it the meaning of the verb active “to look after,”
as it is used in the advertisement which offers her a place. To “look
after,” in the sense in which the advertiser uses it, means certainly to
“mend,” and probably to “make.” So that the “person” who is said
. ºted as a Governess, will find the post of sempstress really is
er place.
To conclude as we began. We have, in general, we own, no sym-
pathy with Strikes, and, except in extreme cases, we should never
recommend them. Men who try by striking to better their condition
find it turns out “wice worsa,” and that, for the most part, their turns-
out make it worse. But the position of our Governesses is really now
so bad, that almost any change would better it; and were a Governess
. to be attempted, we think some striking benefit might possibly
result.
BEAUTIFUL BUTTERMILK.
According to the New York Semi-Weekly Tribune,
"A physician in Louisville has discovered that by living principally on butter-
milk, a human being may prolong existence to the period of two hundred years.”
A bard of Ireland, of later date than the one who—said Richard III.,
“told me once,
I should not live long after I saw Richmond,”
in a song-book of the early part of this century, informs his readers that
“Potatoes grow at Limerick and beef at Ballymore,
And buttermilk is beautiful—but that you knew before."
The property of causing longevity has not, however, been before
known to reside in buttermilk. The beauty of that liquor is, as the
Irish bard intimates, no discovery, and perhaps the same observation
is applicable to its alleged power to prolong life. The physician of
uisville, who professes to have discovered that a human being can
F. his existence by, any means, whatever to the period of two
undred years, is, unless he is as, old as that himself, most likely a
countryman of the buttermilk bard, and perhaps, changing climate and
not mind, may have migrated to Louisville from Limerick.

KING PUNCH*S AMNESTY.
ollowing the example of
the EMPEROR OF THE
FRENCH, KING PUNCH pro-
claims an amnesty to politi-
cal offenders. A full pardon
is extended to all sitters in
St. sº who have,
ºil e past Session, com-
mitted any crimes against
good judgment or good taste,
or nave made themselves
amenable to any jokes, or
other pun-ishments which
have, for public safety, been
inflicted by KING PUNCH.
In still further generosity,
KING, PUNCH proclaims
that henceforth, and till
such time as is stated at the
foot of this His notice, He
grants His gracious leave to
all political delinquents to
commit whatever follies and
absurdities they choose.
Now that they no longer
can bore the public ear,
the prosiest of prosers may
prattle as they please, and Members fond of gabbling may gabble as they
wish. Having now retired to the bosom of their families, the geese and
donkeys who infest the Commons of the country may cackle, hiss, and
bray as loudly as they like. The Wiscount. WILLIAMSEs may reach
their penny-wise economy, and practise their cheese-paring to the last
scrap of the rind. The WHITEsipes may rant, and the Q'Donoghues
may rave, and the Pope's Brass Band may strike up at their most dis-
cordant pitch. Dog Tear'ems may bark, and grievanced Irishmen may
howl; and the long-windedest of lawyers may exercise their lungs to
their extremest stretch. AYRTONs fi. with the gab may throw open,
when they choose, the flood-gates of their oratory, and volubiles in omne
may overwhelm the ears of all whose buttonholes they catch. In short,
the bores and nuisances who so infest St. Stephen's and disturb the
public peace while Parliament is sitting, have now KING PUNCH's full
lºsion to indulge their separate foolings to the top of each one's
ent.
KING PUNCH proclaims, however, that this amnesty will last only up
to, and until the opening of, next Session, and that then. He will renew
the measures He has taken to ensure the public safety from the bores
He has denounced.

THE END OF ALL THINGS.
M. DE LA GUERRONIAERE delivered a pious discourse, on Sunday
last. He preached to the Councils-General of the Haute Vienne. His
text was taken from the history of the late Italian campaign, and he
improved the occasion by extolling the goodness and wisdom of
NAPOLEoN THE THIRD. Subjoined is the commencement of the
address delivered by the reverent gentleman:—
“Gentlemen, The great events which have preceded the meeting of the Councils-
General, authorise me to-day to address you on matters freign to our useful and
no test labours, but which respond to irresistible impressions and sentiments. The
present year will count in history among those which God has marked for the glory
of France."
The labours of M. DE LA GUERRONIERE are no doubt as useful as
they are modest. His º is apparent from the estimate which,
as a Frenchman, he has formed of the position occupied by France in
the Universe. This is so high, in his opinion, that the Author of
Nature himself, in consideration of the vast importance of France in
the scheme of things, has paid her the attention of marking certain
Years for her glory. Omnipotence itself consults the glory of France.
he glory, of France ranks among final causes. ill M. DE LA
GUERRONIERE be content with this proposition? Will he not insist
that the glory of France is the sole final cause of creation?
A Wise Reply. -
“I’LL get you up,” says Bob to BILI,
“A Testimonial, an you will.”
: I thank you, no,” says BILL to Bob ;
“A Testimonial marks a snob.”
INFALLIBILITY'S FOUR REASONS.
“His Holix Ess is said to have assigned four reasons for refusing to become
President of the proposed Italian Confederation.”—L'Univers.
“CoMº, Pope, my dear Pope,” says good EMPEROR NAP,
“Make one on this jº. occasion;
I’ve got a new crown for your three-storied cap,
Be Head of our Con-fed-e-ra-tion.
A favour like this, for the sake of a peace,
I’m sure that you will not deny us;
'Twill give the old Papacy's life a new lease.”
“I’m blowed if I will,” says Pope PIUs.
“Q, don't talk like that, Holy Daddy,” says N
“Remember my aid and my succour; -
I saved your crown once, and may do so again,
Next time you get into a pucker.
If you’ll be the Head of the Union, you see,
ou’ll give it a Catholic bias
That’s doing what’s º by the Church and Saint P.”
“I’m hanged if I will,” says Pope PIUs.
“But why?” says I.N., “if a layman might ask,
And what is your little objection?
I need not remind you there’s work in the task
To keep down your flock's disaffection.
And if you came out as a friend of the free
(You’ve power both to bind and untie us),
You'd make things more pleasan; for you and the See.”
“I’m dashed if I will,” says Pope Pius.
Says NAPOLEON º “The old pig is a fool,
wish it were lawful to curse him,
He’s got no more sense than his own Holy Mule,
I’ve a precious good mind to coerce him.
Then (aloud) Holy Father, 1 pray on my knees,
That with more condescension you’ll eye Us—
Come, head the Confederacy, do. If you please?”
“I’m d-BLEssed if I will,” says Pope PIUs.
AN IMAGE BY MR. OSBORNE.
At Liskeard, the other day, MR. BERNAL Osborn E expressed the
following belief:—
“I believe if Lord DERBY and MR. DisPAELI and MR. Gladstone and Lond John
Russell were to meet in a room together, and consult without rd to party, they
would come to the conclusion of introducing a very satisfactory Reform Bill. They
say, ‘We must go with our party.' . The consequence of that sometimes is, that the
people of this country are crucified between two thicves, and they get nothing
except when these gentlemen fall out. (Roars of laughter.)"
It is not, however, so much the belief of MR. Osborne that merits
remark, as his illustration of it, which is remarkable for irrelevance at
least, if not for something else. It is somewhat of a puzzle. By two
thieves MR. Osborn E of course does not mean the four statesmen
whom he names. He intends, we presume, the Whig and Tory parties
º personified, and supposes the people of England as indi-
vidualised under the form of John BULL. ow, in the position
wherein he represents the parties, it would be possible for the central
one to gain anything by the falling out of the other two, it is not quite
so easy to understand. The parallel suggested by MR. BERNAL
OsBORNE .. does not run on all fours, and perhaps it was the
extraordinary hobble which it consequently displayed that occasioned
“roars of laughter.” Otherwise we do not understand the laughter;
for Liskeard is not Houndsditch. There is, by the way, one conside-
ration suggested by MR. Osborn E's very irregular metaphor, which is
in a measure satisfactory. It might—without reference to its hon.
author—be regarded as a symptom of the parliamentary eligibility of a
too long oppressed and enslaved people.
An Eternal Bore.
WE are tired of hearing Rome called the Eternal City, and no doubt
the Romans themselves are still more weary than we are of the con-
tinual recurrence of that hackneyed phrase. All the rational world,
and especially the Roman part of it, would be glad if Rome, were to
exchange the Fº title of the Eternal City for the plain
denomination of the Temporal City.
A NATIONAL FEELING-LoRD, PALMERSTON sets his back against
the Gothic. It was but natural that his Lordship should have, a
leaning towards the Italian, when we remember his oft-repeated decla-
ration of “Civis Romanus Sum.”

staff will be a kind of distaff, inasmuch as it will
be exclusively in the hands of females. The
hands engaged to work the telegrams, are those
of young ladies, and the Company has already
fifty-five pairs of them in their employ. We
rejoice over this announcement, as each new dial
will open a new circle of employment for women
and it is rather too bad that all the loaves an
fishes of this world should be monopolised by the
men, and nothing but the bones and crumbs
should be left for the women. The employment
augurs well for the success of the Society, as we
are told that female society is the best of all
good company, and a telegraph company is sure
to answer well, inasmuch as we alſº know from
experience that young ladies are noted for their
readiness in always giving a quick and º:

will never have long impatiently to wait, as from
the nature of things, they will no sooner have
put the question, than they will receive all their
answers on the spot. Moreover, the preference
of employment is only due to the acknowledged
superiority of the sex, as it stands to reason
that a woman must make the best telegram-
marian, if we only take into consideration how
much more expert and industrious than a man
she is in working at the needle / ... In fact, we

some of which may have the effect of inducing habits of reflection in
the female mind. For example:—
“The French buy our old written parchments, and return them to us in the
form of delicate kid-gloves.”
Heretofore, too many, a girl, in putting on her glove, has only, in
i. her hand extended in that act, considered the beautiful fit of
the envelope to the exquisitely formed member. Knowing that French
gloves are made out of old English parchments, she may now think,
not only how well they set her delicate hand off, but of what interesting
documents they once formed part—leases, indentures, and settlements
of personal property; the deeds last named having a peculiar interest
for intelligent young ladies. She may meditate on the possibility, that
her gloves may be portions of some old record of great historical im-
portance, which has been lost to the literature of the country by
official negligence and the want of proper custody of public manuscripts
and muniments.
Ladies again may thank Chambers for informing them that—
“There are certain small brown domestic annoyances which tidy housewives
cannot endure to hear even named, and which have received the masquerading defi-
nition of ‘B flats.' Now, Australia has the misfortune to be prolific in these B flats,
and an enterprising colonist has devised the means of obtaining a useful brown dyo
from them.”
This piece of information will enable the female mind to moralise
with some degree of novelty. Silk, in this point of view, may be said
to be worn out. Beauty and Fashion have long been aware that their
finest apparel is the work of “a poor worm,” and don't want to be
told that any more. The reflection will be new to them that their nice
brown morning dress derives its rich warm tint from the colourin
matter of a poor B flat, if B flat is the best of synonyms for the insec
in question, of which the mordant qualities (independent of its dye)
render it perhaps more worthy to be called B sharp.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SAVE ME FROM MY FRIENDS.
Mong the many felicities of
now be reckoned that rarest
of all, the §". of
N reading his own Life. Men's
N lives, as a rule, are not writ-
N ten till their deaths. Their
laurels are usually mingled
with cypress, yew, and other
mortuary “strewments.” To
MR. Charles KEAN has
been reserved the satisfac-
tion of listening to one of
those performances on the
biographical brass trumpet
which are usually sounde
§ only when the ear of their
subject is deaf, and his vanity
|. tickling. In this, at
east, MR. KEAN belies the
old proverb. He is ante
obitum beatus.
The passionate enthusiasm of MR. Cole has deluged the hero of his
idolatry with such a douche of laudation as few men could have stood
up under and breathed. Luckily, MR. CHARLEs KEAN is case-
hardened. He has gone through such a course of puffery, that nothing
in the way of superlatives can tell upon him much. Like an Indian
stomach, seared with capsicum and curry-powder, to which common
Cayenne is tasteless, MR. KEAN’s palate has been accustomed to such
high spicing of flattery, that even MR. QoIE’s praise may seem to it
.. To be “called over the coals” has hitherto been equiva-
lent to getting a good scolding ; but to be “called over the
Cole” must henceforth mean to be soaped from head to foot with the
creamiest and most unctuous,of commendation, and rolled, in the
butteriest of puff-paste. And this brings Mr. Punch to the subject on
which he ventures to join issue, no less with MR. Cole than with his
unwontedly kind critic in the Saturday Review.
MR. QoIP complains bitterly of the unfavourable newspaper criticism
to which MR. KEAN has been subjected. Both the biographer and the
reviewer seem to imply that this unfavourable criticism was due to envy,
malice, and all uncharitableness, stimulated by MR. KEAN’s independence
of the offensive insects who thus buzzed about him. This is, to Mr. Punch,
an altogether new view of MR. CHARLEs KEAN's relations to criticism
and critics. What he had always heard, and had been compelled, with
considerable reluctance, to believe, is, that MR. CHARLEs KEAN, so far
from being “independent” in his relations to his º critics,
was all through his career weakly and unwisely susceptible to their
praise or blame; that he lost no opportunity of conciliating, cajoling,
or otherwise i. such as he could influence in his favour;
that he at º laced himself in such relations with his critics as to
believe that all who did not praise him were influenced by the lowest
and basest motives of personal antagonism, while at the same time he
did not hesitate to win favourable notice by means which, had he been
less vain, he must have seen deprived praise of all value whatever.
So far from agreeing in the view of MR. Cole, that MR. CHARLEs
KEAN has had to complain of the newspapers, Mr. Punch would say
that there never was an actor who has been so unduly puffed and
panegyrised; that his efforts, as a Manager, to win audiences over
to the Elizabethan drama by spectacle and show, have received, at
least, their full meed of recognition; and that this recognition would
have been more #. ad it taken more note of what had been
done before MR. KEAN's day, with better taste and less pretension,
in the same direction, by MR. MACREADY and MR. PHELPs.
Mr. Punch i. admits that the conduct of MR. CHARLEs KEAN
to his actors has §: marked by liberality, kindliness, and conside-
ration;–that, in his º there have been shown an industry,
a business-like promptitude and ††, and an attention to pro-
prieties of costume, place, and period, all very rare in theatres. But
A/r. Punch must still be allowed to think MR. CHARLEs KEAN a very
bad actor. That he has done anything to raise the literary character
of the stage, Mr. Punch must, take leave to deny. Whether he has
raised its historical character, by the pageantry he has introduced into
the plays he has produced, Mr. Punch hopes he may be permitted to doubt.
Like other managers, MR. CHARLEs KEAN has cast about for means to
make his theatre pay. Being unable to give the public good acting, he
has given it pretty groups of carefully-costumed supernumeraries and
hallet-girls, ingenious applications of the oxyhydrogen or electric
light, and clever contrivances of slots, steel framework, and other stage
mechanism. That all this has cost him a great deal of money and a
great deal of labour, is certain: it is to be hoped that the public
patronage has replaced the one and repaid him for the other. But
that MR. CHARLEs, KEAN is a public benefactor, Mr. Punch is quite
unable to admit: that he has been the subject of undue depreciation or
MR. CHARLEs KEAN must |d
systematic dispraise on the part of the newspaper critics, is a palpable
misrepresentation of the fict: that he has done anything to elevate
the literature of the stage, or the position of the actor as an expo.

BAD JOBS FOR JOHN BULL.
How the deuce can it be, that works always cost me
Twice or three times as much as .# neighbours;
And for all that I pay I don’t get half what they
Have to show for their taxes and labours?
Be the thing what it will, it is underdone still,
And overcharged ne'er less than double;
Whilst, beside all the cost, an immense time is lost,
And there’s always an ocean of trouble.
In maintaining a fleet by the French I’ve been beat;
To think that I’ve e'er lived to say it!
Of my army so small the expense would appal
Any other who had to defray it.
It is true volunteer forces can’t but be dear,
But my ground for vexation and rage is
That, of all the vast sum whereunto my works come,
The least part goes in labourers' wages.
Building, statue—what not l—by mistake or by plot,
s run up to a figure enormous,
And I pay through the nose every fellow that blows,
Through our house, air to cool us or warm us.
Whilst the man, like a fool, when cold blows us more cool,
When we're warm blows of heat aggravation,
*Till we cry, with a curse, that the air’s ten times worse
Than it would be without ventilation.
Did you hear, deep and long, like the boom of a gong,
My big bell tell the time from its tower?
Those lugubrious sounds cost twice ten thousand pounds,
But the clock wouldn't point out the hour.
The bell cannot swing where they’ve put it to ring,
By reason of bungle and blunder;
If the whole with a run were to come down, for one,
I can only say I shouldn’t wonder.
The Prince declared free institutions to be
Just at this nick of time on their trial,
They produced a dead lock on the part of the clock,
hich was all you could read on the dial.
Cheap and nasty is bad, but dear mulls drive me mad,
Worst of all waste is waste and no pleasure.
Fellows botch every job whilst among them they rob
And plunder John BULL without measure.
A Joke from an Economist.
It is a well-known fact that the Parsees, though rolling in wealth,
evince the greatest, reluctance to part with any of it. Taxes, es:
pecially, they hold in the most religious abhorrence. They are the
richest and the stingiest class in India. When these characteristics
were told to MR. JAMES WILson, he said they reminded him, with the
exception of the wealth, of his own country. Upon º: indignantly
called upon to explain what in the name of nonsense, he meant, he
said, with a sly twinkle of his humorous eye, and in his own peculiar
inimitable Scotch accent:—“I allude, boys, to the Parsee-money”
(parsimony).

CLERGYMEN AND BAPTISTS.
Juvenal, says that poverty often makes persons ridiculous; but that
persons well-to-do often make themselves ridiculous is a truth which
Punch finds weekly reason to assert, and were the word “persons” to
be printed with an “a,” confirmation of the statement would be no
less readily forthcoming. As a proof that parsons sometimes run, the
risk of ºl. at, a Correspondent sends us the following adver-
tisement, which appeared in a provincial paper not long since:–
EMPORARY CURACY.-Wanted, for a Country Parish, bordering
Ad3. the Sea, a CLERGYMAN to assist the Rector during the Bathing Season.—
ress -
This, our Correspondent thinks, may perhaps “amuse our readers,”
and with a sagacity which, does him no small credit, he proceeds to
point out what he deems the reason why. From the phrase “to assist
the Rector during the bathing season,” he argues that the Curate who
is temporarily wanted will be reduced to the position of a common
bath attendant, a duty, which few Clergymen would like to undertake.
Now, if our aim were simply to "amuse” our readers, we might very
likely do so by writing on this hint. A laugh might certainly be got
up at the notion of a Rector doing duty as a §t. man, and having
in the season his hands so full of business that he is forced to advertise
for temporary help. It might be ludicrous to speculate as to how the
wanted Curate would be proved fit for his post: as to how his aqueous
erudition should be plumbed, and whether he could save himself if he
went out of his depth. A Curate when appointed to do duty in the
sea would have not merely, to read, but to wade, himself in; and it
might be curious to picture his performance of this ceremony, and to
guess whether or no he would take his shoes and stockings off, and
whether he would flounder or contrive to come out swimmingly. The
question also might arise, as to whether or no his orthodoxy would not
be endangered; inasmuch as when officiating in the functions of a
bathing man, he might be looked upon as being less a Churchman than
a Baptist, the chief part of his duty being to give dips.
We repeat, were it our mission merely to amuse, speculations such
as these might perhaps fulfil our purpose: , But as our aim is to advise
and, where needful, to instruct, we should recommend this Rector to

be more careful in future in wording his advertisements, and to avoid
their bringing ridicule or censure on his cloth. As the calling of a
Clergyman is a serious vocation, he should eschew the use of language
which may serve at all to raise, a laugh, at his expense. When a
preacher preaches English, he should at least know how to write it;
and jià be careful to avoid parading doubtful phrases, such as that
on which we have the pain now to comment. Although not disinclined
to view it as a merely clerical error, still we cannot quite condone it
as a fault of no account. We shall cease to be believers in the
benefit of clergy, if we find the propagation of bad language is their
work. Therefore we trust when next this Rector is in need of an
assistant, and finds himself compelled to advertise his want, he will not
allude to the requirements of his curacy as though its duties were
confined to the diocese of Bath.

A PALPABLE ADWERTISEMENT.
SQME very interesting details, have lately ex-
cited the utmost interest on the part of the
public in reference to the Asylum for Idiots,
which admirable institution ought to receive a
contribution from every one who does not think
himself qualified for residence in its comfortable
apartments. But we fear that it will be some
time before any new admissions can take place
the institution being so inconveniently crowded
with correspondents of the º Advertiser.
Two have just been removed thither under
curious circumstances. Their condition was de-
tected by their both furiously insisting that

and that another French officer said to the
correspondent, laughingly, “that the next cam-
aign would not be in Lombardy, but in Lom-
ard Street” (sic). With such cases prevalent, it
may easily be º: that the Asylum is over-
crowded. This, however, should induce the
public to come forward with large assistance
to an institution so evidently needful.

MORE SANCTIFIED SLANG.
THERE exists a periodical of the religious class and baptist order,
bearing the ridiculous denomination, of . The Earthen Wessel. The
contents of this vessel may perhaps be inferred from the subjoined
specimens of the material encrusting its exterior in the form of adver-
tisements. This is one of them:—
MPORTANT to those of the Lord's Ministers who are suffering from
a variety of Diseases. G. SEABORN, Baptist Minister and Medical Botanist, most
respectfully informs the Saints of God, that he has been made a blessing to hundreds,
both in reference to soul and body. Any person suffering from any disorder, may
address a letter to him, stating the symptoms of their disease, the time they have
been suffering, and by enclosing six postage stamps, he will send advice and a
medical º G. S. has recourse to God in prayer before sending out any medicine
or recipe. If help is to be obtained in any case, he engages speedy relief—especially
in Rheumatism, Liver and Bowel Complaints. Direct, G. SEABonn, opposite the
Prince of Wales, Magdalene Street, Colchester, Essex. The Works of William
HUNTINGToN sent post free on receipt of fourteen stamps each volume, of G. S. as
above. Books of every description new and second-hand.
G. S. is open to Supply any destitute Church of Strict Baptist principles.
Upon our word, this is no burlesque of an example of sanctified
slang. It has been cut bodily out of the light brown wrapper of the
Earthen Wessel of August 1st, of this present year of Grace, whereof
G, SEABORN appears to be a precious babe, , Let not the Sabbatarians,
who misjudge Punch because Punch confutes their fanaticism, think
that “G, SEABORN, Baptist Minister and Medical Botanist, most
respectfully informs the Saints,” &c., is a profane parody, for the
authorship of which Mr. Punch is responsible, and *} t to § put in
the stocks. They are mistaken if they imagine that Punch is irreve-
rent enough to caricature the most hypocritical snuffle with that degree
of grossness involved in the announcement that “G. S. has recourse
to, &c. &c., before sending out any medicine or recipe.” The words
here quoted, as well as those omitted, are no exaggeration, and G.
SEABORN is entitled to all the credit for ludicrousness which can be
given to the assurance that “if help is to be obtained in any case, he
engages speedy, relief—especially in Rheumatism, Liver, and Bowel
Complaints.” The idea that G. SEABORN's º have a peculiar
efficacy in rheumatism, jaundice, diarrhoea, and colic, will be deemed a
high joke by our readers—we assure them that the idea, if not the
Joke, is G. SEABORN's own. It will be observed that whatever may be
G. SExpons’s botanical knowledge, his literary attainments are not
those which are befitting any Minister but a member of a Cabinet that
WOL. XXXVII.
might be constructed by LoRD MALMESBURY. When he says that any
person may address a letter to him, stating the symptoms of their
disease, he proves himself indeed to be no unitarian, though he does
not write, we hope, like the generality of baptist ministers. If his
É. Were trustwºrthy, his correspondents would be numerous
elieving his promise that “by enclosing six postage stamps he will
send advice and a medical, recipe.”... Six postage stamps are a pre-
scription that anybody would take if he could get it by merely writing
for it at the expense of one. The notification that G. S. undertakes to
send the “Works of WILLIAM HUNTINGTON” on certain conditions,
is remarkable. WILLIAM HUNTINGTON was a canting coal-heaver, as
G. S. probably knows; a coal-heaver, who may have heaved sea-borne
coals. He wore what may be called a collar of S.S., or at least went
about with the letters S. S. marked upon some part of his dress, if not
on his collar. By those initials he meant “Sinner Saved,” as G
probably also knows. But G. S. perhaps does not know that a famous
wag interpreted them to signify Sad Scoundrel. The less G. S. says
in future about WILLIAM HUNTINGTON the better.
“Destitute Churches of Strict Baptist principles” may be puzzled
to understand what it is that G.S, is . to Supply” them with.
He is not, as a botanist, literally full of herbs, and as a baptist minister
there seems to be nothing in him.
Literae Scriptae Manent.
THERE are thousands of letters taken yearly to the Post Office, and
left there, because they have no. addresses on them. Supposing the
letters had the power of articulation, we can ſºnº, their taking up part
of the City motto, and exclaiming, “Dirige Nos.”

AIDS TO CRIMINAL DEVOTION.
º HE refutation of a be-
- lief which was com-
prised in the demon-
ology of the dark
ages, is apparently
contained in a Blue
Book recently issued
on the subject of con-
vict discipline. The
Rev. MR. ALDERson,
Chaplain to a convict
settlement, after re-
lating the interesting
circumstance that a
capital choir has been
established there with
“an accompaniment
on the harmonium by
a prisoner constable”
(set a thief to catch a
thief) who, however,
was unfortunate
about to be remove
by a ticket of leave,
goes on, as repre-
sented by the Daily
Telegraph, to state
that—
“The prison chapel is
not satisfactory, and the
flies swarm there in num-
bers distressing to the
convict congregation, al-
though, on the other
hand, it prevents them
from falling asleep inser-
mon time."
The ancient demon.
ologists supposed that
Beelzebub was the god of flies. If that were the case, Beelzebub, one might think, would
hardly employ his insects in worrying convicts, to prevent them from falling asleep in sermºn
time, unless indeed he felt perfectly satisfied that the sermon would go in at one ear of the
rogues and out at the other. That this is the course which sermons are apt to take through
the convict sensorium seems indicated by the further statement of the same authority that—
“Candidates for the Communion table were numerous—we trust, not for the sake of the sacramental
wine; but the truth must be told, and other gaol chaplains, not quite so sanguine as Mr. ALDERson, have
found that the greed of a mouthful of wine was the primum mobile with the most ostentatiously pious
convicts.”
It is evident that ordinary sermons produce no moral effect on convicts. The effect
which they do produce on the criminal mind is the same as that which they too generally
produce on the common mind. It is just that effect which, in the case of MR. ALDERson's
flock, was prevented only by the flies. If unconvicted sinners require awakening sermons,
convicts can derive little benefit from discourses naturally tending to send them to sleep.
BANQUET OF AUTHORITIES IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT.
The residents in the neighbourhood of Newport, the other day, and for some succeeding
days, were greatly disturbed by an unusual grunting and º: proceeding from the
denizens of the various styes.jn that part of the Isle of Wight. The cause of this uproar is
explained by the following paragraph from the Hampshire Advertiser:-
“The annual licensing dinner given to the licensed victuallers of the Isle of Wight by Messrs. Mew came
off on Wednesday. Between 300 and 400 persons sat down to partake of the annual repast of sucking pig,
about 40 of whic A were killed for the occasion.”
. It was the massacre of their tender young which had made the pigs unhappy, and occa-
sioned them to express their parental feelings in that combination of bass with trºſe which is
characteristic of their kind. The public will learn with interest that sucking-pig is the elect
dish of the licensed victuallers of the Isle of Wight, and may be curious to inquire whether
it is the favourite, delicacy of that body in general, or whether the affection for it is merely
insular, and rºstricted in insularity. Victuallers should be authorities in gastronomy—Cuique
in suá arte. , The Morning Advertiser will perhaps afford the information of which the desire
is suggested by its Hampshire namesake and contemporary. We cannot quit this subject
without remarking, that the sight of 350 landlords sitting down to 40 sucking-pigs must have
been interesting in as high a degree as the smell of the repast was fragrant º elicious.
More Chiming than Charming.
MR. DENIson defends the purity of Big Ben. So pleased is he with his noisy child, that
he will not, admit that it has any striking fault. Its characteris, altogether, without alloy.
However, he is ready to make this concession,-"if not exactly true, at all events Benis a
great discovery; or, in more musical words, Se non è vero, e Ben tropato.” If the tone is
not *:::::: ſure, still it is remarkably well feigned. We suppose we must admit this as “a
sound excuse.”

MR, PUNCH'S TESTIMONIAL TO MR. CHARLES.KEAN. OUR ROWING CORRESPONDENT.
N Monday last, to celebrate “My DEAR PUNCH, | Harengville, France.
\ the closing of the Princess's
b. Theatre, Mr. Punch, as the
acknowledged MAECENAs of
the stage, gave a banquet
to the wardrobe-men and
scene-painters, who have
lately been engaged in the
#ſº thatestablishment.
The banquet which was
served at Mr. Punch's private
residence, was got up by
that gentleman regardlessly
of cost; and dramatically
speaking, proved a most de.
cided hit. A grander scene
than that which was pre-
sented to the guests, it has
but rarely fallen to a scene-
shifter to witness. The
appointments were all in the most admirable taste, and some notion
may be formed of their splendour and magnificence, when it is stated
that the properties, which were produced on the occasion were the
same as have been long in daily use by Mr. Punch. The knives and
forks and glasses were all º, “of the period;’ and the table was
adorned with a most elegant assortment and variety of plate, com-
prising the plain white and more recherché willow-pattern.
The cloth being removed, and bumpers being filled, Mr. Punch went
on his knees to give the toast of the evening. He said, they met there
to commemorate the closing of a theatre which had been long viewed
as the home of the Shakspearian drama, and had of course therefore
enjoyed a large amount of public patronage. As to whether this
support had been deservedly conceded, there could be, he thought, no
difference of thinking; for in the unbiassed opinion of all judges
who were competent to come to a decision on the subject, the real
cause of the success which had been gained at the Princess's was the
presence of the One Great Actor who performed there, and attracted
nightly myriads by the magnet of his genius... The name of that Illus-
trious One their own hearts would reveal to them, and he (Mr. Punch)
would not impugn their judgment by º; . (Here the entire
company started to their feet, and interrupted Mr. Punch with such a
burst of cheering that the explosion killed a cat on Mr. Punch's tiles, and
a Policeman in his kitchen rushed up to quell the tumult. Silence being
at length restored, Mr. Punch proceeded thus :)—In, speaking of this
gentleman, he (Mr. Punch) should content himself with simply making
the assertion, that no praise could be too high for a Genius so exalted
and that the longest eulogy which language could express would fal
short of the laudation which, was properly his due. Skilful as a
manager, and learned as a scholar, it was however as an actor he so
eatly was ... He had never mouthed and ranted as
ess smooth-tongued actors might; and such was the distinctness and
clearness of his utterance, that when choking with emotion, his
and gasps were quite intelligible, and every one who heard them
exactly what they meant.
#. than if it had been farce, and in whatever character his talents
had been exercised, his vows had been as plain as the nose upon his
face. Nor was this Great Genius great merely in the drama. Eclipsing
as a “Star” the most brilliant of stage luminaries, he had shone out
no less brightly as a º and the learning he had lavished
on the fly-leaves of his play-bills fully showed he was a man of letters.
ln saying this, he (Mr. Punch) claimed no novelty of diction, Nor
were they solely his own sentiments he was trying to express. He was
echoing the comments of the best informed of critics, and spoke merely
as the mouthpiece of the unbiassed British Press. Having, however
slowly, at length come to the conclusion that their judgment was the
right one, he #. resolved on making public recantation of his scepti-
cism, and of showing º proof tangible, that he had come to the true
faith. With this view he intended to present a Testimonial, which the
whole strength of his establishment had been exerted to get up; and
he thought it right to mention that, following the principle which else-
where had been acted on, his poorest of employés had
give their ‘.

sist of, it had not yet been settled; but he inclined to think the fittest
and most graceful gift to offer would be a set, of his (Mr. Punch's)
periodical, with an index to the jokes which had been cut at this Great
Actor, and which in all future editions would be carefully erased.
Mr. Punch concluded, amid general applause, by drinking the good
healths of all the company assembled; sºying it was to them that the
nation owed its thanks for the upholstering of the drama, whereof the
Great Man they had worked for had long been the head upholder.

“THE fervour of my devotion to Art is intense, but an Italian
summer is equally warm. I love communion with the classic shades,
but, they afford no retreat from the rays of Phoebus. It was all very
well for the ancient Romans; while a gentleman could appear in
society wearing nothing but a sheet and a quiver, like the Belvidere
Apollo, or stroll down to the Coliseum in the simple but elegant
summer costume of the Discobolus; while the baths of DIOCLETIAN
and of CARAcALLA were filled by limpid streams in which GLAUcUs,
ANTIPHo, or any other swell of the period, might, lead an easy,
anthropopotamus-like existence—breakfast, dine, and sleep in the
bath, without even the trouble of rubbing himself dry afterwards,-
mighty pleasant a Roman summer may have been in those days, I say.
As for the present—phew the bare notion of it is a stifler. I bore it
like a native of Troy (that is to say, with peculiar fortitude,) at first.
I worked as long as I could. I had a conduit laid down in the
house, and a stream of water, fresh from the Barberini Fountain
passed through my studio night and day. My models were supplied
with fresh relays of ices from NAZARRI's every half hour (that gº

castor-oil as a vehicle for my colours (GALLINACCIO stole a pint one
evening for his salad, and came back looking very penitent next day).

he could wear his goat-skin breeches no longer; JACINTA (an elderly

heard cheerfuly exclaiming, “Eh £ moiſ” moi, malade?—Oh no / pardy

for a grand historical picture, viz., The Birth of King Pepin, and am
now staying at Harengville-sur-Seine (where that illustrious but unfor.
tunate monarch first saw the light) for the purpose of making studies.
“Verily, my dear Punch, we live in strange times. It is scarcely
two months since I left the Mediterranean. In that short space of
time what unexpected events have taken place in the political world !
Six weeks ago there was not a contadino in Italy who did not believe
the French Émºnon to be the Saviour of his country. Then he was
‘Benedetto; ' now he is ‘Birbone;” and from being esteemed as a
Louis d'or, he is now only regarded as lui-même again. As for the
French, their disposition appears not only to waver, but to revolve
º to the issue of events. A short time ago one heard of
nothing but the glories of war, and every fresh victory was hailed with
enthusiasm. Flags adorned the streets; lamps were hung at every
window, while thousands of their countrymen were j low upon
the plains of Magenta or before the heights of Solferino. Austria was
held up for execration. Hideous caricatures of her bravest soldiers
appeared at every shop-window. . The popular cry was ‘Perſide
utriche /? and “Sacrrrrrrrée sauer kraut.”
“The excitement had scarcely died away, the festive lights had
hardly smouldered out, and the red, white, and blue calico been furled
up and put in a corner, when a small affiche appears, posted on the
walls, and the magical words “Amnestie '...} are read by the
gaping crowd. Presto! the sentiments of the whole French nation
are changed in a twinkling. . War is suddenly discovered to be, a
horror; victories cost blood; sieges are affreur. The cry is for ‘the

LOUIS NAPOLEON'S COURT JESTER,
EveRAL thousand thanks,
DE MORNY | A thousand of
the warmest thanks that
can be uttered this cool
weather!. It takes no com-
mon mind to make a joke
in this dull season, and the
genius who can do so, de-
serves a niche in Punch.
You, DE MoRNY, have most
fully merited that honour.
Your speech before the
Council-General of the Puy
de Dôme, Punch cannot
but consider a great effort
of facetiousness — every
word of it is redolent of
humour the most happy.
Dip into it where one may,
one is sure to come upon
a jest of the first water.
Here, for instance, in the
opening sentence of the
º are two such gems
of jokes, that when even
set in Punch, they will be
looked upon as brilliants:—
* You have º; gentlemen, in the enthusiasm excited by our victories,
you have shared in the unanimous gratitude of France for the great moderation of
the EMPERoR. But you find it difficult to understand how His Majesty's evident
desire to prevent a European conflagration can have caused in England the news-
paper articles, the Parliamentary speeches, and the warlike preparations of which
so much has been said."
“Unanimous gratitude!” hal, ha! hal. “Evident, desire!” ho!
ho! ho!, The jokes are really both so good, one don't know which to
laugh at loudest. The two statements are so funny that it puzzles one
to say by which one is most tickled. The chief charm in them both
lies in their gravity of humour. One regards, them at first sight as
really matter of fact assertions. A second glance, however, reveals
the hidden fun of them, and one seems to see the wink which accom-
panied their utterance. - - - - -
. Here too is another bit of comic speaking, the joke of which consists
in one's regarding it as serious:–
“We live at a period when the hatreds of castes and families have succumbed
from the increased mildness of manners, and at which national hatred and preju-
dice have been effaced by civilisation. The new generations have something else to
do than to avenge the past; they are too enlightened to act on any other motive
than the interest of the present and the future.”
Bravo! DE MoRNY...Another thousand thanks, to you. The Mil.
lennium has arrived. Ha! haſ haſ you’ll really be the death of us,
DE. MoRNy....There are no such vices extant now as enmity and pre-
judice....Civilisation has effaced all national tººl. The Gallic
Çock “has something else to do” than crow for vengeance. Qh!
dear, yes. Of course. Just ask the cockadoodle colonels if it hasn't.
But by way of comic climax, what joke can equal this?
“You know, without doubt, by means of what logic the English explain their
apprehensions. They say, “Our press is free ; the French press is not so; therefore
insults have not the same importance in one as in the other.” That is quite an error.
There are in France no means of preventing a journal from publishing what seems
to it right; the Government is only armed against the press with the power of
warning and of suspension, which are repressive measures.”
Now, isn't that delicious! . Really, Count DE MoRNy, the EM-
PERQR your master should appoint you his Court jester. The humour
of that º ” is so exquisitely clownish, that unless you had your
cheek rouged you must have blushed to say it. How facetious too you
are in imagining...we fancy that the French press is not free. Free ?
Why, of course it is. o in England doubts it?, Everybody here
knows that the French press now is free—as free, at least, as France.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ANOTHER RAILWAY ROW.
A MEETING of the Directors and Shareholders of the Eastern
Counties Railway took place yesterday, when the usual scene occurred.
Mr. Punch is unable, from the preternatural pressure on his space to
give the proceedings in eartenso, but is happy to oblige the parties by
the following condensed account of what occurred.
MR. HoRATIQ LovE, the Chairman, was about to take the Chair,
when it was pulled from under him by several shareholders, amid the
º of some, and the disapprobation of others. . After a severe
fight, and the destruction of the Windsor chair he had intended to
occupy, the honourable gentleman succeeded in establishing himself on
a cane-bottomer, shut up his antagonists, and opened business. He
said that they had assembled to consider— -
SERJEANTTozER said that they were always considering and never
getting dividends. It was the case of the song,
“There was an old man and he had an old cow,
And he had no victuals to give her;
So he out with his fiddle and played her a tune,
Consider my cow, consider.”
The Company were the old cow, and the Chairman wanted to fiddle to
them. (Laughter and applause.) If music were the food of LovE, he
might play on, as SHAKSPEARE said, but they wanted something more
substantial.
The Chairman said they should have a substantial—he meant sub-
stantive motion directly. He hoped that they would hear him.
MR. WADDINGTON, as a gentleman, assured the honourable Chairman
that they would do nothing of the kind. (Cheers.
MR. Jones said that the man who would not listen to the voice of
L9X5 was a brute, whom it was base flattery to call a coward. (Cries
The Chairman said that he had never sought his present office—
MR. BROWN said that he had sought the Chairman's office often
enough, but never could find him at home, and whether he was away
revelling in enjoyment at the expense of the Company, or was inside
the office smoking, and wouldn't answer the door, he could not say—
The Chairman. I never smoke, though I puff the Company sometimes.
(Cheering.) Encouraged by that response he would proceed. He did not
affect to deny that the Company was not at that moment an El Dorado,
or a Golconda, an Ophir, or a California. It was not an ever springing
fountain of gold and silver— -
MR. BRown said that his accusation was borne out by the Chair-
man's words. That last was the habitual cant of the gambling;table
keepers at races, and the Chairman must have been in the habit of
frequenting races to hear such expressions. If, instead of going to
races he would attend to his business— -
The Chairman. I never was at a race in my life, except once, when I
went to the Race of Portland to buy stone for the Company—
Mr. Robinson. And a nice Bill of Portland you brought us in for the
speculation. (Hear, hear.) -
The Chairman. Hold your noise. Admitting, he continued, that the
Company was not exactly prosperous, he nevertheless contended that
it was not at a stand-still. - -
Mr. Williams. But its trains often are, and in a disgraceful way.
I myself, with a lot of excursionists, were kept several hours the other
morning waiting for conveyance to Rye House— -
The Chairman. And what business had you to be going to Rye
House. It was not a place for gentlemen, though all yery well for the
inferior classes. He should be ashamed to bring forward such an
objection in a Meeting like that. The honourable Fºlor was not
going to get up a Rye House Plot there, he could tell him. . . .
SERJEANT Tozer said that such a display of aristocratic indignation
was all very fine, but he, on the contrary, asserted that the line was
“snobbishly’ conducted, and their Bradshaw was the Book of Snobs.
(Innense uproar.)
The Chairman said that as sure as his name was HoRATIQ LovE—
MR. WADDINGTON said that there were more things, in heaven and
earth than were dreamt of in MR. HoRATIO's philosophy, and several,
especially, in the Eastern Counties Railway. The way, for instance,
in which the porters bawled out the names of the stations was most
obnoxious and offensive.
..The Chairman demanded whether the honourable proprietor would
like to have their porters sent to Cambridge for education. It was
on the line, only fifty-seven and a half miles from town, and any
facilities— - - -
MR: WADDINGTON said that the Chairman's irony passed him like
the idle wind, but considering the º falling fortunes of the
Company, the Chairman reminded him of a Cambridge authority, the
Master of Downing. (Cheers.)
MR. Jones here tried something about Brazenose, but being informed
that this was at Oxford, muttered that the Chairman had brass enough
for anything, and sat down without any applause at all. -
The Secretary then rose to read, the ort, but the tremendous
shower of hats that were instantly shied at him, compelled him, after
some struggle, to abandon the idea. An º respectable hat
struck him on the nose, on which he emitted a slight oath, but imme-
diately apologised for making what he called a beaver-dam. (Applause.)
The Chairman said that he would now proceed to his duty of declaring
a dividend.—(The meeting rose en-masse, and shouted for several minutes.
Order being restored:)
The Chairman would be obliged by their allowing him to conclude
his sentence. He would proceed to #. duty of declaring a dividend—
(Renewed sensation)—of declaring a dividend to be a thing entirely out
of the question at present, and he wished them a very good morning.”
The Chairman left the room, and a scene of indescribable confusion
followed, in the course of which our reporter was, we regret to say,
knocked down eight times in mistake for the same number of directors.
In the course of a few hours the meeting quietly dispersed.
* Our reporter seems to have made a mistake about this last part, as it seems
that the Eastern Counties do pay a dividend. We fear that our young man has
fallen into the melancholy mistake of preferring what he thinks to be smartness to
what he knows to be truth. As the rest of his report is unimpeachable, he remains
in our service, but is “warned.”
PROCLAMATION BY KING PUNCH.
KING PUNCH hereby proclaims to anxious myriads of His subjects
that He has not the least intention to reduce those standing armaments
of sarcasm and satire, which have made His name so formidable where-
ever it is known. On the contrary, unmoved by what Emperors may
be doing, or pretending to be doing, KING PUNCH sees no fit reason at
present for disarming; and He therefore condescends in His great
fººt. to notify that they who dare provoke him must beware of
is just wrath. To punish all offenders, no matter where or whom,
His trenchant sword of satire will be sharpened once a week, and the
utmost pains be taken to preserve its keenest edge, and fit it for the
service of giving out great cuts. Moreover, lest His bayonet of sar-
casm be blunted by disuse, KING PUNCH will take all care to keep the
fineness of its point, and ever have it ready to administer home-thrusts.
The same attention also will be paid to other weapons in His royal
armoury. His shafts of wit will always be found in the best feather,
and certain to fly true to the butts which they are aimed at. All the
arms, in short, wherewith invention has supplied him, being arms of
rare precision, will ever surely hit the mark.
In the way of heavy ordnance, KING PUNCH has a good number of
great guns at His command, whose large calibre of intellect, and
enormous length of range, make them terribly tremendous when they
ever open fire, and certain to demolish those on whom they are brought
to bear. As heretofore, KING PUNCH will keep this “dread artillery”
in perfect working order; and whatever stronghold of snobbery He
lays siege to, He, as heretofore, unfailingly will smash. Abundant
stores of ammunition will be always kept in readiness; and besides
the larger missiles which are fired from His great guns, His great
arsenal of wit will always be supplied with heaps of quips and cranks,
and jokes and jests, and such small shot.
The standing army of brave penmen whom He keeps in pay will
continue to be kept up regardless of expense, and besides the “regulars”
enlisted in his ranks, encouragement will graciously be given to volun-
teers who may on emergency be ready to assist. As defenders of their
country from Snobbism . Silliness, KING PUNCH may point with
pride to his crack corps of ready writers; and without boast or bravado
may record the simple fact that, whenever there is any slashing service
to § done, they are never found to shirk it, or to turn tail from the
work. In fine, KING PUNCH throws down His gauntlet in challenge to
all comers; and in the modesty of greatness He calls the world to
witness that, ready to scourge the .. smash the scoundrel as they
are, for mingled skill and bravery in leading a good cause, there are
nowhere better officers than those upon his staff.
Human Sight.
INyouth, we look upon life through the small end of the telescope;
in old age, through the broad. They are the same objects, and yet we
wonder that what once appeared so large, should now seem so very
small. Alas! that happy time, when all things were sweet as confec-
tionery to our innocent taste, will never come again—nor shall we
care much, if it never does.—An Optician and an Optimist and an
'Ouseholder.
CREATURES OF CONTRADICTION.
IN many trifles, Man is just (or unjust) as contradictory as Woman.
For instance, he objects to see flies in his port wine, and yet the
fastidious monster is not in the least enraged at the sight of the
bee's-wing !

AN IRISH STRIKE.
THE Carpenters of Dublin have followed the
example of the Builders of London by striking.
They have struck for an advance of 4d. a day on
the standard wages of 30s, a week. Everybody
knows that a very considerable proportion of the
London bricklayers are Irishmen. The London
strike, therefore, may be nearly as much an Irish
strike as the Dublin one; particularly since the
workmen of London generally have not struck.
Anyhow, the strike, whether in London or Dub-
lin, is too likely to prove an extremely Irish affair
in the end. The masters, having lost money by
suspension of business, will, when they re-open
their establishments, very probably indemnify
themselves by paying their workmen at a lower
rate, and thus ſº men will find that they have
struck for a reduction of wages—a proceedin
§. is just what might be denominated an Iris
trike.
Sweet Innocence.
THE simplicity of MR. Bowy ER beats every-
thing. He was saying, the other morning, in
his own innocent way,+“You know they call the
Pope” (and here he made his usual salutation)
“a Sovereign Pontiff, and I confess, I do not
understand it; for I have yet to learn how three
crowns—and that is all the Pope has—can
possibly make a sovereign.”

jist like to see the Britisher as could beat them grand descriptions our
hoys penned us of the SICKLEs trial. All-fired fine they were, and
here’s another sample for you, equally socdologising. I seed it in the
IWashington Star a week, or two ago, but the weather's been so hot,
Ihain't had time to send it you. It’s not only, as I say, a scrumptious
bit o' word-fixing, but it may be morally of sarvice to you Britishers.
You say we wops our niggers: wal, perhaps we does, but anyheow
you’ll own, we treats our sinners marcifully. Although, when they
desarve it, we claps 'em into quod, we doesn't scrunch the finer feelings
of their human, natur out of them. , Though under lock and key, we
lets 'em act at times like free and independent citizens. For instance,
this is heow they kept the Glorious Day of Independence in the
Penitenti-ary as we’ve built for 'em at Washington:—
“While the sovereigns º were enjoying the ‘largest liberty' of which
the day is capable, the convicts at the Penitentiary were allowed somewhat enlarged
privileges, and the celebration there was decidedly unique as well as interesting.
* * * Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon the convicts were
assembled in the º and entered upon the exercises of the day in the presence
of quite a number of ies and gentlemen from the city. The room was decked
with flowers and evergreens, and at the eastern end, fronting the audience, appeared
in handsome letters on a blue ground the motto:—“We Still Love our Country.'
In the rear of the visitors were the male convicts in their prison uniform of parti-
coloured white and blue clothes, and separated from them by a screen (punctured,
however, with numerous ‘peep-holes,' showing the strength of feminine curiosity)
were the female convicts. Copies of a written programme, with coloured embel-
lishments on the margin, bearing the names of WASHINGTON, LAFAYHTTE, Mont-
Gomsity, Kosciusko, were distributed among the audience, alul were carefully
preserved and taken away by the recipients."
“Guess you’d give one of your wise teeth for a glimpse of this
here programme? Or if not, that gal, Judy,” would; for ‘feminine
curiosity’ is strong on both sides the Atlantic. , Wal—bring her over
here, old cuss! and we'll jist liquor, and I’ll show it her. They say
sea-sickness is 'bolished neow the Big Ship is afloat, and, Crinoline
and all, sure-lie there will be room for her. But see heow dazzling our
Star shines in its critique of the performance:–
“The Declaration of Independence was read by BARRETT in a clear voice, and his
appearance rather favourably impressed the audience, being that of a frank, kindly
young man: and it was not easy to realise that the crime for which he is incarce-
rated was that of murder 1
“The address of the day, by R. SMITH, was an effort to occasion yet more interest
in the speaker, a young man with a fine expansive brow, and a quick intelligent
eye. The address was well conceived, and was delivered with appropriate gesture
and elocutionary effect, showing scholarship and cultivation on the part of the un-
fortunate criminal. We forbear giving his name in full at his earnest request lest
it should come to the knowledge of his aged mother (thus far kept in ignorance of
the fact) that her only son is within the walls of a prison. His crime, we believe,
was forgery.”
“‘His crime, we believe, was forgery." Reckon that’s a peowerful
climax. And here’s a tallish bit of sentiment about another prisoner,
whose sudden death had ‘thrown a sad damper’ on the flare-up:-
“Much interest attaches to the name of CroqGIN in this community, from his
having been one of the most daring members of the celebrated ‘Naylor gang' of
burglars, and from his escape from gaol, and his subsequent adventures while con-
cealed prior to his re-arrest by the police. He was about twenty-four years of age."
.." But if you want to hear tall talkin', as BILLY SHAKSPEARE says,
‘jist loan me your auriculars: ”
“In his address he spoke of the celebration as a novel one; but outcasts though
they were, the fire of patriotism still glowed in their bosoms. God forbid that their
misfortunes should entirely crush out their finer feelings . . For himself, he felt
keenly the degradation which attached to him, but his fixed resolve was to here-
after redeem his good name.
“Proceeding to recite, in vivid language, the leading events in the history of the
country, and of the War of Independence, he went on to depict the material pro-
gress of the country, closing i. all º to his fellow-prisoners to aspire to a
higher position, and urging upon them that to this end there was no surer means
than the cultivation of true patriotism. Altogether, we have heard infinitely worse,
and not many better specimens of Fourth of July spread-eagleism outside the
Pºiº
“This address was warmly applauded upon its conclusion, not only by the spec-
tators but by the convicts, who seemed to take no little pride in the creditable
effort of one of their number."

.NERvous we are not, nor ever needlessly alarmists. But we are
living a doomed life, and so are all our English readers. There is no
mistake this time about the fate which is awaiting us. We have long
feared an invasion, and our fears will soon be realised. The foe is close
at hand. Tremble, Britons, at his coming! Shake, Saxons, in your
shoes; for surely you must quake when you list to what the Dundalk
Democrat has said of him:-
“He knows all our weak points; and our opinionis, that he would lose no time
in going round to land in Connaught or Bantry Bay, but would dash boldly on the
capital, and seize the Castle, and all the arsenals in Dublin. He would, we fear,
strike at once at the heart of our power, and scatter us like chaff before the wind
before we could organise our forces. Among the Young Ireland party there was no
one but he capable of leading an army of liberation. He was a manofiron will and
indomitable courage. We believe he possessed that boldness and energy which
would inspire his followers to rival the soldiers of any other nation indeeds of
heroism. He is a man to decide quickly, and to carry out his p with an
unerring judgment and a vigorous arm. He would have the men of all districts
either with him or against him, and would deal roughly with all who should desire
to stand on neutral ground. Such a man as this would prove a formidable foe to
English power in Ireland; and, although he might run some risks, it is certain
that he would not be so easily caught as Wolfe Tone. If his visit to Europe be to
aid the invasion which the English seem to expect, he will have no mercy for John
#: and will more than rival GARIBALDI in his furious onsets against the Great
ritons.”
. And who, it may be asked, is this “formidable foe?” Who is this
indomitable, iron-willed invader, who, “knows our weak points,”
and is to “scatter us like chaff?” The Dundalk Democrat does not
conceal his name. John MitchEL is his name: merciless John
MITCHEL; maniacal John MITCHEL. Mitchel, he of vitriolic and of
vicious memory. Transported he was once, and now returns for ven-
geance on the sanguinary Saxon. “Some risks he may run,” but once
caught makes twice shy. , You may catch a Wolfe asleep, perhaps;
but MitchEL is a weasel that you won't again mab #. As
GARIBALDI to the Austrians, so jº's MITCHEL to the English. He
has armed him for the fight. See, his lion's skin hangs, round him;

UNCALCULATING SORROW.
OUR Dublin contemporary, the Freeman's Journal
lishes an advertisement in combination with the fo
announcement:-
“August 10, at his residence, , vintner, after a long and painful
illness-affection of the heart brought on by fretting—deeply lamented by a large
circle of friends and his disconsolate widow, who still continues to carry on the
business. May he rest in peace.”
The disconsolate condition of the lady whom we may presume to
have penned the above advertisement, no doubt occasioned a slight
defect, which is noticeable in its composition. In the distraction of
rief she omitted one word which is required to connect the totally
#. facts which that notification proclaims. The concluding por.
tion thereof should have run thus:– “deeply lamented by a large circle
of friends and his disconsolate widow, who, however, still continues to
carry on the business.” The public would then have understood that,
although disconsolate, she was still carrying on the business, which
excess of sorrow might erroneously be supposed to prevent her from
attending to.

MUZZY NOTIONS OF MERCY.
OUR friend the Advertiser will be too much for
us one of these days. If he makes us laugh until
something happens, he must really provide for
Mrs. P. and the kids." He stated the other
day, in reference to the anticipated reprieve of
SMETHURST, that “he” (the Advertiser that is)
“knew that the QUEEN was always ready tº
ive a Fº response to an “gº. for mercy.”
ut of what very funny old School-book does
the Advertiser get his motions of the functions
of the Crown? We are half inclined to believe
that he thinks the English Sovereign “signs
death-warrants,” and dº the royal pen into red
ink, for the purpose. He surely imagines that
SIR. GeoRGE Lewis, having decided on a re.
rieve, comes crawling on his knees to QUEEN
Ictor LA, and after a meat and pathetic speech,
founded on Portia's, about mercy, humbly begs
for lenity to the culprit. Really it is too bad
of the Advertiser, being such a favourite, at
Court, not to obtain more accurate knowledge.
He should not write as if the QUEEN had the
faintest personal *. for, or even
acquaintance with, the proceedings in such
cases...We assure him, on our honour, that
HER MAJESTY has nothing to do with criminal
documents, and consequently never dashes away
the pen with a “Would I had never learned to

A RACE IN DANGER.
MR. PUNCH, having humanely given his establishment, a holiday,
having sent his upper servants to Ramsgate and his inferior ones to
Margate, and having turned his horses into Hº Park, has taken to
ride, of late, upon the tops of omnibuses, the only place in truth
whence a true conception can be formed of the real character of
London. There, safe, and like Jupiter high throned all height above,
the hurrying crowd, the furious Hansom, the deaf four-wheeler, the
rattling carriage, have no terrors for the London traveller; there he
can. y survey mankind, from Chelsea to Mile End, and besides
having many agreeable revelations of first-floor, life, he can really see
what the architecture of the Metropolis is, and be more and more con-
firmed in his conviction that LoRD PALMERSTON hath once at least in
his life talked bosh. But this is beside Mr. Punch's present theme.
He has noticed (and what has he not noticed P), that something or
other has wrought the most wonderful change in the character of his
old friends (yes, my Lord Duke, he honours you with his friendship,
but can afford to keep humble friends, which you can’t) the Omnibus
Illen.
...Qf old, it seemed that the Omnibus Driver amply fulfilled his duty
if he drove his vehicle with ordinary skill, avoided curb-stones, an
gas abysses, was grumpishly civil to the passengers who sat near him,
and quietly growled at his conductor for not making two people f.
out at once if they lived within a street or two of one another. The
Conductor was also equal to his task if he kept, a tolerably sharp
eye on the populace, unhesitatingly stated that the Omnibus went
exactly where any inquiring person wished to go, and had spirits enough
to take an occasional mild º: at a rival. A readiness to pass b
money, and a disposition to be insolent if twice told the same thing,
Were also ordinary characteristics.
All is changed. The word “Wake Up” has evidently been given to
the Omnibus world, and there has been a wake, with a witness.
Drivers and Conductors have been transformed into the most wide-
awake, energetic, almost frantic of creatures. Instead of being lead
they are quicksilver. Eyes, and ears, and brains are all alive, an
artillery officers hurrying their guns from point to point, º .
an advancing or retreating enemy, could not be more steady in their
position, more desperate in their dash. . And all insolence has vanished.
A º almost a feverish politeness is observed, information is given
and even tendered, thanks are returned for money, you are a patron
and a benefactor—only, with tears in their eyes, the offi
“look sharp.”
A terrible rivalry has sprung up, it seems, and certain “Times” are

business of the twin managers of each omnibus is to violate this agree:
ment in the most daring, or the most subtle way; to “get the road;”
to sweep their enemy's passengers off; to meet him at angles and
corners; to slang him furiously, and . him with every crime that
is not capital; to cut away through nameless and obscure streets, and
up courts, and if necessary down cellars, so as to get out into the
broad thoroughfare before him; to be ready, as a captain will in stress
throw his guns over, to tear out all their own passengers, and shove
them into a friendly Bus, so as to enable themselves to dodge the foe
without imprecations from the inside; to be prepared with a storm of
clamorous affidavits for the “time-keeper,” the main point of which
is that the deponents are the most innocent of lambs, and the most
trampled of victims; to turn a perfectly blind eye and deaf ear to any
old hiſ or lame gentleman whose tardy entrance into the vehicle might
spoil the race; to keep a succession of little boys as "E. at the
corners of streets, and by posts, which infants screech horribly the
names of the drivers that have last F. the station; to crawl, like
a tortoise that has taken laudanum for gout, and anon to dash forward
like a pickpocket that has caught sight of a detective's askance glance;
to drive over costermongers, barrows, washing-carts, children, or any
other impediment if necessary, but, to be infinitely cautious and slow,
if slowness just then is the desired dodge; to be fertile in resources
for stopping, such as the discovery of an imaginary stone in the near
horse's off fºr. or the absolute necessity of buckling up that mare two
holes (and it is astonishing how awkward a handy man can be); to see
visionary passengers half a mile off—or not to see real ones at three
yards, º: to circumstances; and generally to follow out the one
object of the life of these gallant and ingenious men, namely, to cheat
each other’s “Time.” -
The occupation affords scope for the exercise of all the best faculties
of man—patience, courage, vigilance, perseverance, skill, eloquence
and if a passenger happens to have nothing to do, and not to be at
nervous, the game is not an unamusing one. Unhappily, such passengers
are not the majority, and Mr. Punch regrets to hear. that the clamour
of the majority against a . in which the public is bumped and
hurried and ... or dragged and drawled and wearied, according
to the state of the said game, has eventuated in a contemplated Police
Act for dealing with Omnibus traffic, and º: it to ignoble and
vulgar order. The new and fine race of men, thus greated by the
necessities of competition, will be swept away, like Red Indians. They
shall not say that “they had no bard and died.” Mr. Punch has
embalmed them. -

CRINOLINE FOR BLUE COAT BOYS.
l NY. Y DEAR Jolly, old
º º
ou are tired of
fºil; jokes made
about Crinoline, but
when a fellow really
wants to talk about
it seriously, I hope
you’ll do the liberal,
N; and give him space
§ to speak. ...Everyone
keeps calling it a

vance, but I mean to
sº say it’s not by ever
§ such long chalks so
cumbersome and
clumsy as those ugly
yellow etticoats
which we Blue Coat
boys are bothered
by. You can't think,
Sir, what a nuisance
our old-fangled
dresses are to us.
The gowns are bad
enough, for they go
dangling about our
heels like the swell chaps Noah's Ark coats which you’ve been and
made such fun of. And it’s no joke 1 can tell you having nothing on
one's head (and, you’ll say, precious little in it t). One, gets such
jolly colds in winter, to say nothing of the Smuts; and in the summer
time, my Wig' doesn't the Sunjust warm you! I declare Isometimes
fancy I can hear my brains all frizzling like our pancakes on Shrove
Tuesday. Can't say either I admire one's having to sport, those yellow
stockings. As that party in SHAKSPEARE says, it’s “a fashion I
etest.” (We had to stick the passage into Iambics on last verse day,
so that’s how I remember it). But I declare the yellow stockings
ain't by ever so much so beastly as those brutal yellow petticoats which
when the frost comes they serve out to us. To make boys dress in
etticoats seems to me to make great girls of them; and when a
ellow’s near sixteen (as I shall be next August), he don’t like being
made a Molly of, or in any way thought missy. But then BLOBBER
says the Governors, regard the yellow petticoats as an “ancient insti-
tution,” and think the country would be ruined and the School would
go to smash, if we got leave to leave off wearing them. So you see
it’s no go our petitioning against them. But I say, Mr. Punch, now
couldn't you persuade the Governors to let us all sport Crinoline when
they make us wear the petticoats? Besides being ornamental, it really
would be useful to us; for the great nuisance of ‘the yellows’ is their
sticking to one's legs so, and º up a fellow when he tries to run
or jump in them. They swaddle, a chap up like a baby in its long-
clothes, and make one's knees feel tied together like a donkey's when
he’s ſettled. We somehow tuck them up enough to get a spin at
football, but as for playing fly-the-garter, one might 3. as well expect
to play at lea j. the Monument, as to try and take a back when
one has got the yellows on. In short, the yellows make us feel a little
in the blues, when we peep through our school railings and see the
butcher-boys go grinning at us... They mayn't be so well up in VIRGIL
or Thucy DIDEs, but they’ve the free use of their limbs, and that’s a
ood deal more than we have. Their minds p'raps may be stunted,
ut at all events their bodies aren’t. A butcher-boy could easily clear
a pillar letter-box, while a blue coat boy could hardly go clean over a
mere door-scraper.
“Do then, Mr. Punch, try to make them give us Crinoline. It can't
be good for boys to be swaddled up like babies, and not allowed to use
their limbs as they feel naturally inclined to do. How can a chap play
cricket, or any other manly game, while his legs are swathed together
like those mummies from the pyramids which f. so often seen at the
Museum on wet holidays. It’s just as silly and unnatural for boys to
wear a petticoat, as for women to wear the t'other things. In either
case you know the wearer’s certain to be ridiculed. Why, one can't
half º one’s holidays, one gets so precious laughed at. The
moment I get home I can hear the servants giggling at my rummy-
looking toggery, and all the time I stay they . on making fun of it.
Last time I went down, our old gardener brought me round my pony
with a side-saddle, 'cause he said he knowed as how I couldn't straddle
in them petticoats!
MR. PUNch,”

insult, and we feel bound, for our dear Judy's sake, to ask for explanation.
+ We say nothing of the sort, Sir. We believe that your head-master is a very
able man, and we have no doubt that he keeps your heads in capital condition.
“Pray then, dear old Punch, do use your influence with the Gover-
nors, and make them let's wear Crinoline, which will let us stretch our
º more. If they will persist in dressing us like girls, we may surely
ask to have our petticoats cut fashionable. , Be a brick now, do, and
say just half a word for us. BloBBER says the Governors are precious
nuts on Punch, and that they go yº own to Greenwich or Black-
wall for it. So if you’d just print my letter, they’d see what it is we
want, and no doubt at your request they’d jolly soon come down with
it. At any rate a word for us would get you heaps of kvěos, and besides
would ever so much increase your circulation, for you know our fellows
would be sure to buy the number.
“So I remain, in expectation, your young friend,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GRAWE SUBJECT.
As being the “peculiar and distinctive feature in its plan,” we see a
Burial Company advertises to those who stand in need of it, that it
pursues what it calls “the Railway System of Interment.” What this
puzzling phrase may meanit much perplexes us to guess. We have very
often heard of railways having killed Wºr but we never before learnt
that they undertook to bury them. Yet when one hears it said they
have a “system” of interment, one cannot but suppose the practice
must be frequent with them. Moreoyer, it is puzzling to guess in
what respect their system is different from others. That it is so we
infer from such marked stress being laid on it, and from a puff being
put forward of its use by way of precedent. Railways certainly in one
sense may be said to have pursued “a system of interment.” They
have buried heaps of money, there is no denying that; and they have
also caused interment of the hopes of many shareholders. These
burials have been generally performed at railroad speed; nevertheless
we think their º: execution can hardly be regarded as an act of
happy dispatch. Nor in respect of their economy are they at all to be
commended; , for they usually have proved to be most costly cere:
monials, and have been known to drain the very deepest pockets. If
this “system of interment” be the one which is alluded to (and with
all our powers of thinking, we can’t think of another), we must
confess ourselves completely at a loss to see its merits: and if they
wish to gain a good name with the public, we think the less that burial
companies are “distinguished” by it, the better.
COLD WATER, CURE FOR WANTON MISCHIEF.
SoME mischievous rascal or gang of rascals the other day destroyed
MR. MARMADUKE LANGDALE’s fountain in Endell Street. This dis-
ſº fact suggests the expediency of modifying the arrangement
or enabling the poor, public to quench their thirst by means of
fountains. The homely old Pump should be substituted for the
fountain, which combines elegance with utility indeed, but also with

strength, is, that if any blackguard is caught attempting to injure it,
he can be immediately placed under it by the indignant multitude, and
subjected, for some time, to the wholesome influence of its refrigerant

THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER.
You must not wake me early, wake me early, JAMEs, d'ye hear,
To-morrow’ll be the slowest day of all the whole long year;
Of all the whole long year, JAMEs, the saddest dreariest day,
For all the world is gone to shoot, and I alone must stay.
There’s many a first-rate pointer, but none so good as mine;
There’s SMITH's dog Don, and joinson's Dash, and BRowN’s pup
- Caroline;
But none can work like my good Rose in all the place, I say—
Yet all the world is gone to shoot, and I have got to stay.
I shan't sleep sound all night, JAMEs, I’ll lie all night awake,
And only get a fitful snooze when day begins to break;
And then at eight I must put on my uniform so gay,
For all the world is gone to shoot, and I alone must stay.
As I came up the barracks whom think you I should see
But THoMPson leaning on his sword, and whistling “Rosa Lee’”
He H. and forgave me those cross words of yesterday,
For he was going off to shoot, and I had got to stay.
He thought I was a ghost, JAMEs, I looked so ghastly white,
And I doubled by him silently, just like a flash of light:
They say I’m proud and sullen, and just the same were they,
If all the world had gone to shoot, and they had got to stay.
I’m dying for the turnips—but alas! it cannot be
My heart is almost jº stubblefields for me.
There's many a much worse fellow will enjoy himself all day,
For all the world is gone to shoot, and I alone must stay.
To-morrow I shall have to drill upon the barrack green,
And you’ll be there as well, JAMEs, to see me serve the QUEEN;
For the shepherd lads have taken the shilling, more fools they—
And while all the world has gone to shoot, to drill them I must stay.
Upon the Colonel's hard hard heart I used my utmost powers,
But he said that applications had come to him in showers:
I argued, but he loºked so cross, and shook his head so grey,
That all the world is gone to shoot, and I alone must stay.
The sentries come and go, JAMEs, in front Fº the grass,
And they ask the man who comes in late, if he has got a pass.
Qh! how I wish that it would rain throughout the livelong day,
And sell the men who’ve gone to shoot, while I alone must stay.
So you must not wake me early in the morning, JAMES, dye hear,
Let me sleep and try forget the griefs and sorrows which I bear.
To-morrow’ll be of all the year the saddest, dreariest day,
For all the world is gone to shoot, and I alone must stay.

CLERICAL SLIPS AND SKIRTS.
THE Morning Herald lately contained a passage in a leader which
may be considered to be remarkably characteristic of a journal regarded
as the organ of the Derbyites. The writer of the article, referring to
the ungratified vanity of some clergymen, says:-
“Hence the enlightened enthusiasm which we occasionally meet with, and hence,
in St. George's in the East, the manciple, stole, and other names, even the spelling
of which is, we confess, very difficult to encounter.”
This is a striking exposition of views which are professedly those of
LoRD MALMESBURY. They will not probably meet with the assent of
our readers, who will perhaps hardly consider the Orthography ºf alb,
chasuble, and dalmatic, to be much more formidable than that, of
stomacher, bib, and tucker; but perhaps MALMESBURY will, exclaim,
“Who said that it was f* We ourselves, though we certainly do not
think it hard to spell the names of the various articles, of Puseyite
millinery, will *i; confess that we doubt if we should be equal to
the spelling of the analogous details, of female ºf mentioned in
Le Föllet. A very complex nomenclature is that of the yarious west-
ments overspreading the expanse of Crinoline: a contrivance which
perhaps those effeminate parsons whose heads are turned with the love
of dress, will ultimately take to wearing under their ecclesiastical
petticoats.

THE MINISTER IN TOWN.
(From the Court Circular.)
Wiscount PUNCH, First Lord of the Treasury, transacted business
yesterday at his office. He received all his colleagues, and told them
that they might go away, and yacht, or shoot, or fish, or study Conic
Sections, or read the Idylls of the King, or, lie on the beach and smoke
short pipes, or preach, or vaccinate gratis before ten o'clock, or see the
St. Leger, or sit in an attic and grow moustaches, or bathe, or flirt, or
write articles for quarterly reviews, or try the water-cure, or do exactly
what they pleased, as he would take charge of the Nation, and had got
a telegraph laid to their Royal Mistress's residence at Balmoral.
“He spoke, and straightway found himself alone within the room.”
LoRD John PUNCH, Foreign Minister, transacted business ſº
at his office. He sketched out a new programme for the settlement of
Italy, and enclosed copies to the Powers. He enclosed a packet of
Poor Man's Plaster to the Pope, who has hurt his leg. He wrote to
compliment the American PRESIDENT on fitting out an anti-slavery
squadron. .
THE RIGHT Hon. MR. PUNCH, Chancellor of the Exchequer, trans-
acted business yesterday at his office. He considered the report of the
Decimal. Committee, and pronounced it...bosh. He inspected some
designs for the new bronze coinage, and didn't like them, but sketched
something much better.
SIR GEORGE, DEvoNSHIRE PUNCH, Home Secretary, transacted
business yesterday at his office. He ordered a policeman to be sta-
tioned to protect the Drinking Fountains from ruffianism. He
sketched a bill for abolishing street organs, street cries, Crinoline,
perambulators, and other street nuisances.
THE DUKE. of PUNCH, Colonial. Secretary, transacted, business
yesterday at his office. He ordered immediate reforms in all parts of
the world, and sent off expresses to the fifty-two Colonies under his
control. Having a few idle hours afterwards, he sent for MR. ANstEY
and listened to him, in re China, from Two P.M. till a Quarter past
Eight, by which time MR. ANstEY had nearly completed his intro-
ductory narrative.
SIR CHARLEs PUNCH, sº for India, transacted business yes-
terday at his office, that is to say, he sent for MR. JAMEs Wilson, an
told him that he, SIR CHARLEs, trusted everything to him, and hoped
he would make a #. job of Indian Finance, as he, SIR CHARLEs, was
utterly bewildered and mystified.
THE RIGHT Hon. SIDNEY Punch, Minister for War, transacted
business yesterday at his office. He placed the Army on a new footing,
completed the defences of the Country, and kicked LoRD CARDIGAN
into the middle of next week for his impudence in wanting the Fifth
Dragoon Guards.
THE DUKE of SEYMoUR-AND-PUNCH, First Lord of the Admiralty,
transacted business yesterday at his, office. He manned, the fleet,
braced up the mainsail, dashed his old eyes, and spoke civilly to more
than one person in the course of the day.
LoRD CHANCELLOR PUNCH transacted business yesterday in
Chambers. He considered whether he could ask for a coronet for his
son, W. F. in addition to his own and his wife's, but on reflection
thought he had better wait a little.
THE EARL or PUNCH, Postmaster-General, transacted business yes-
terday at his office, and issued a decree that nobody who left his street-
door without the letter-box requested by MR. Rowland HILL should
receive any letter at all until all the letter-box folks had been served.
SIR RICHARD PUNCH, #º, transacted business yes-
terday at his Chambers. He codified the Civil law, and had made
reat progress with a code of Criminal law when he remembered that
e had been bothered by the PREMIER for a Reform Bill. He drew
this and went to dinner.
The above particulars having been tºº." to HER MAJESTY,
she was graciously pleased to express her perfect satisfaction with the
conduct of her Minister In Town.

my sorrow in a bowl of that

“Let me compose myself.

occasion this wild rhapsody ? I have been visiting Vauxhall ! The
statement may seem maniacal, but—Ghost of SAMUEL Cowell, ha!
ha! haſ “I am not mad.” Alas, there, where I have passed the
happiest moments of my life, there have i been passing two whole days
of the most miserable. Oh, SERAPHINA' SERAPHINA: Oh!, There,
where you and I have spent so many ‘splendid shillings, and the whis-
pering trees have listened to our cooings and our billings: There,
where we’ve consulted the Hermit in his Cave, and seen the Sea King
Neptune emerging from the wave: There, where we have watched the
artistes on the slack rope and the ti ht; and paid one and sixpence
extra 'cause ’twas called a ‘Gala Night:” There, where on wet even-
ings we have caught such colds and cramps, being tempted out by
º of “Ten Million Extra Lamps:” There, where when exhausted

in the smelling of your salts: There, where slowly strolling down the
dark Italian Walk, my, hat hath touched your bonnet in our low;
breathed lover's talk: here, where ºf balloons so quick have vanished
from our sight, and so oft we’ve cried o! O! at the rockets' skyward
flight: There, I sadly have stood by, and seen the scenes we held so
dear put up to public auction by the ruthless auctioneer: Yes, there,
my SERAPHINA, I all helpless have looked on, while the voice of MR.
DRIVER hath re-echoed ‘Going—Gone !'. While the fixtures, and the
figures, and the fittings, great and small, have been sold in lots six
hundred from the Gardens of Wauxhall!
“Alas ! yes, it is too true. I have seen the ‘properties’ cleared off
the ‘Ro § The same eyes that beheld them in all the
brilliant brightness of a Grand Night's ‘blaze of triumph,' have seen
them sold off dank and dirty in the plain prosaic daylight. Ah! what
agonising anguish I suffered at the spectacle! Every falling of the
hammer was a knock-down blow to me. When ‘Lot 1” was put up, I
thought I should have fainted. Yet there was little in the Catalogue
to account for that conjecture. . The brief words “Four stout painted
deal tables’ do not to unpoetic minds ºney much ºf sentiment.
But to me how fraught they were with it ! . For I thought, O SERA:
PHINA twas at one of these ‘stout tables’ that we sat, when my fond
arm encircled thy slim waist, and I so nearly popped the question

“Lot 51 awakened still more sentimental fancies. The words cling
to my memory, like drunken men to lamp-posts: ‘ One deal painted
table, with turned legs (one of the original tables made for the Gardens
in 1754!). A table with turned legs in 1754! Is table turning then of

“Am not I in dreamland, or in Uncle Tom land? Do we sell our
aged servants when they cease to be of use to us? Alas! I fear me,
yes. Here is the damning proof of it:—‘Lot 112. Scenery to Hermitage
and Hermit.” Reading this, I fancied that the Hermit would be sold.
The Hermit was not sold Ha! haſ haſ I was.
“A few lines further on, the Catalogue still }: me:—‘Lot 119.

Hunting Party, with costume of Louis XIV, 12 feet square.” Did Louis

and SERAPHINA’s Crinoline does not cover above an acre.
“Again I hear resounding the voice of MR. DRIVER, His cry is
for ‘Three Dozen Blue Waurhall Supper-plates.” O DRIVER, DRIVER!
You’ll drive me to distraction. Haply ’twas on one of these three
dozen plates that was brought the fatal sandwich which I, as a great
treat, had promised SERAPHINA. I mind me that my looks were as
cerulean as the plate, when searching madly in my pockets, I found
only twopence ha'penny. The brutal waiter laughed when I told him
I would call and pay him the next morning. And the still more brutal
BLOGGINs more foully mocked my misery by dashing a half-crown
'down, and crying, “Keep the coppers l’—Ah! lucre, filthy lucre' Ah!
faithless SERAPHINA' It was the glitter of that half-crown that
A |dazzled thy young eyes, and turned aside their love-shafts from me to

“Again am I perplexed by the wording of the Catalogue. Were it
a QUEEN’s Speech, it could not be more mysterious. “Busts of Eminent
Persons’ are announced upon the title-page. Lot 204 I find is “A
Plaster Bust of Scott.’, A ‘ditto Byron,' and a “ditto Tennent’ (who's
he P) follow it. Are these the ‘eminent persons?' What have they
done for Vauxhall, that Vauxhall should note their eminence? But
stay, the next three lots are “dittos’ of ‘the celebrated M.C., Mr.
Simpson.” MR. SIMrsoN 1. Ah, he was eminent indeed, Vauxhall made
him immortal, and he returned the compliment. Rightly then had
Vauxhall a triad of fine busts of him.
“Lot 215 declares itself “A Keyboard of Dumb Piano.” This key-
board is a lock upon my undºgstanding., What is a dumb piano?
Some merciful invention of an Anti-piano-playing-in-Houses-with-Thin-
Walls Company? Blessings on it, if it be; and on the Genius who
invented it! § that the piano next door were a_dumb, one! The
MISSEs STRUMSTER live next door, and—they keep a “Ladies' Seminary.”
Kind reader, drop the tear of pity on my plight!
“These reflections overcome me. hen next I hear the fatal
hammer 'tis falling on “A small round Composition Table.’ I wonder if
this table be a help to composition, and if need were would assist to
composition with one's creditors P. If so, maybe there are some com-
posers, who’d be glad of it. I wonder, did the Vauxhall Poets use
this table, when they wrote those Comic Songs which, when sung by
Vauxhall vocalists, everybody roared at, and when sung in private
circles, every one was bored by. I think the fun of those sad canticles
consisted in the funny hats in which the singers sang them. I wonder
if these hats were # in the ‘three hat-bores’ in Lot 253, and whether
any of the fun still clings to those receptacles. Quo semel est imbuta

boxes as wine-casks. *
“Among the “useful articles” and “miscellaneous effects,” I look
with anxious hope of buying a barometer, Alas! my search is fruit;
less. Vauxhall doubtless had one once; but it no doubt committed
suicide. No sane-minded barometer could point always to ‘Much
RAIN’ without a suicidal damper being thrown upon its spirits.
“I count two-and-eighty punch-bowls knocked down by the
hammer. But who shall count the headaches—the ar-racking head-
aches—which have had their birth in them? Teetotalism, I fear, was not
in feather at Vauxhall. The stock of soda-water glasses amounteth but
to twelve, but of brandy glasses sold there are more than thirty dozen!

here cracked on Royalty? “Lot 311. A Transparency of H.R.H. P.A.”

TURCOS SOLDIER MAKING HIMSELF AT HOME IN A PARISIAN FAMILY.
A HUMAN CANDLE.
MR. WILLIAM PALMER, of the celebrated
Patent Candle firm, was brought the other day
before MR. D'Eyncourt, and fined for suddenly
springing out of a railway carriage, and falling
on his side, and not being hurt.
Nothing can be more improper than need-
lessly to risk one's life or limbs, except the
risking anybody else’s. But we seem to see a
sort of apology for MR. PALMER. . He had pro-
bably been musing upon his own business, and
considering how he could improve the structure
of the Candle Lamp that bears his name. . Now
it is the faculty of genius to become absorbed in
the object of its *::: and as it were to amal-
gamate therewith. R. PALMER was perhaps
fancying himself to be a Patent Candle, and was
brooding, with a visionary spring under him,
upon that abominable jerk with which the
candles, so acted upon, sometimes leap upwards,
to the ruin of a midnight student's sensitive
nerves. “Yes,” mused MR. PALMER, “that is
the mischief. I (as º jump so,”—and the
action expressed the word; and out he shot,
* * scandal of the officials, who have no
souls.
We are very glad that he was not hurt, and
shall be more glad if the incident helped him to
the required inspiration.
THE TESTIMONIAL TABLET.
The preternatural spread of the Testimonial system, which now
includes in its parasitical embrace every kind of person, to whom any
other kind of person can make a toad-offering, renders it impossible for
the public to keep itself “posted up” in the records of humbug,
without some other aid than that of the puff paragraphs manufactured
by the recipients of these presents. Mr. Punch, with his usual frantic
zeal to serve society, has therefore undertaken to publish an occasional
programme of Testimonials about to be offered, and will thus at once
supply information, and hints for imitation.
Any particulars which }. may wish should be thus advertised,
must be sent to Mr. Punch's office, in sealed envelopes, with the cards
of the parties. . And where the person to receive the Testimonial is not
the person paying for it at the silversmith's or elsewhere, that fact is to
}: ºted, not necessarily, for publication, but as a guarantee of good
aith.

liamentary career.
MR. Lushy NIPPs, the respected potman at the Hobblers' Arms,

session of the late JAMEs GREENACRE, Esq., deceased.
foºd Bº Dr. Gourmi. The interesting occasion of this
nobleman having been permitted by his eminent medical attendant,
DR. CRAPAUD, to be wheeled out upon his terrace after his long illness,
inspired some of his tenantry with the idea of presenting him with a
memorial, of so delightful an event, and a subscription having been
originated, a i. little model, in gold, of a Bath chair, (with
working wheels, &c.,) will be proffered to his lordship, with an appro-

Qn Pompey's Pillar he makes his sign,
On the Pyramid's top he cuts his line,
On the Crystal Palace's tower so fine,
There is not a rafter that does not shine
With the pencil-lead of the ºlman.
Set him down on a nice new benc
Two minutes more, with a jerk and a wrench
He's digging the names of himself and his wench;
O, if we .# borrow a leaf from the French,
And teach good sense to the Englishman.
The glass of the carriage in which he rides,
The handsome mirror mine host provides,
The window wherever the snob abides,
The humble i". his way that guides,
Are scribbled upon by the %.
In Lichfield's aisle lie two little dears,
Young mothers moisten the marble with tears,
The Cunningham-Chantrey Babes, for years
Appeared thereon, and perchance appears,
The scrabble of many an Englishman. -
Qn the top of the church, in the bathing machine,
On the walls of the Castle that holds his Queen,
On the arch of the cloister damp and green,
On the seat of the pew, there’s sure to be seen
The mark of the scrawling Englishman.
And now to the grim Crimea he goes,
And there where the bones of his dead repose
ſº by honoured and valiant foes)
e’s at it again, and Europe knows
The fellow is—only an Englishman.
Whoever does such a sneaking jo
At home or abroad is a rascally Snoh,
And whoever may spy him, JULEs, WILHELM, or Bob,
Will oblige Mr. Punch by punching the nob
Of a coarse and a mischievous Englishman.
Wiscount WILLIAMs, while reading that the KING OF OUDE em:

THE STEAM CAT.
THE fast-improving ºf. of the age has occasioned an active revival
of the wholesome º: ment of Flogging in the Army. At Coldbath
Fields, and probably at other prisons, there is proceeding a restoration
of the same good old discipline. Much mawkish sentiment has been
excited by the circumstance, that at Woolwich, the other day, the
diseased back of a soldier was lashed with a degree of violence a little
too sanguinary. Therefore, lest the Cat should afford a handle to
hollow philanthropists, by which they may succeed in wresting it from
the control of colonels, and the gras y drummers and executioners,
it is expedient that some means should be provided for regulating the
force with which the stripes are applied to the human skin, and the
extent to which they lacerate it. For this purpose, an ingenious
invention has been submitted to the Horse Guards, in the shape of a
Flogging Machine, . This clever contrivance is worked by steam, by
the power of which the momentum of the lash can be recisely
adjusted. At high-pressure, it exerts a quantity of Jack-Ketch power
sufficient to lay bare the ribs and dorsal vertebrae of a muscular
grenadier at one stroke; but perhaps it will seldom be required to
perform this amount of action, at least in the present stage of our
civilisation. When less steam is put on, it º according to the
reduction, tear and scratch the id: to a depth varying from half an
inch to less than a line,—will produce mere ºor only a slight
redness; and may, indeed, be made to “do its spiriting” so “gently,”
as simply to cause a pleasing titillation, and to ply the cat with such
leniency that its stripes . be
- - |. sufficient to whip the dust off an
officer's boots. This machine will render the military and civil autho-
rities independent of a soft-hearted executioner, and will save them
from the excessive zeal of one whose heart is too much in his work.
To the civil prescribers of flagellation this instrument of torture will
prove an especial boon, as it will enable them to inflict the exact
amount of torment they please on the criminals in their power, instead
of the uncertain agony º a whipping 9bscurely signified by the loose
and indefinite terms, “good,” “sound,” and “severe.” One further
advantage presented by this interesting application of machinery must
not be omitted: it is so constructed that, whilst at work, it may be
made to utter a scream like that of the railway-whistle, in which the
shrieks of the sufferer under its operation may be drowned if required.
This engine of correction, has received the warmest approval in a
distinguished quarter, in which it has been pronounced a pretty piece
of mechanism. Its introduction will mark, if not a new era, at least a
return to an old one; and the rack, improved by modern science, will
. #. be re-established soon after the establishment of the Flogging
acillub.
SCOTCH PLUSH.
PLAID is commonly considered a fabric peculiar to Scotland; but
plaid, as a specially Scotch article, is in danger of being superseded by
plush. Here is a pattern of that commodity advertised by a Caledonian
contemporary:—
HE PRINCE OF WALES BIBLE.—From an anxiety on the part
of some of the best families in Town to procure copies of the abovo Bible, the
Subscriber begs leave to intimate that he has placed sheets in the hands of his
Binder, which, he trusts, will be ready by Monday. Meantime, a fac-simile of the
Prince's Bible may be seen at the §. Bible Warehouse, together with a
beautiful copy of the Scriptures presented in 1853 to HER MAJESTY and PRINCE
ALBERT, through the Duke of Athole.
PERTINAx M“Sycophant, Proprietor, South Bridge.
Is this not plush of which one might almost be excused for saying
Ne plush ultra & Truly, here is your plush of the most vivid thunder-
and lightning. The sheets in the hands of M'Sycophant's binder will
surely come out of them bound in that material, which will be more
i. to the edition than even the most brilliant red Morocco, which
might represent it as blushing for its title. Plush without blush is
the publisher's proper symbol. Curiously enough, the sacred volume
which might have plush for its lids, has already plush of the same
colour in its original preface,—plush pieced in there in servile adula-
tion of that “most dread Sovereign,” who, by the way, was a Scotch
monarch. To the respect of M'Sycophant, and to the reverence of
the creatures whom MSYCOPHANT addresses, the Bible is commended
by its association with royalty; and the plain Scriptures are not so
precious as those which have been consecrated by having been pre-
sented in 1853 to Her MAJESTY and PRINCE ALBERT, through the
DUKE of ATHole.
HAT WILL THIS COST TO PRINT 2 is a thought often oc-
curring to literary minds, public characters, and persons of benevolent inten-
tions. An immediate answer to the inquiry naturally occurs also tº ºvery sane
erson, “Much more than it is worth; and I will therefore expend the money,
#. in purchasing a complete set of Punch, where I shall find all I have to say
infinitely better said for me; and, secondly, in increasing my life assurances, by
which means I shall leave behind me writings for which my posterity will realiy
be grateful.”

WOTER-BOTTLING STOPPERED.
OUR male readers of course know what it is to “bottle” voters. But ladies equally of
course can have no knowledge of the process, and should female curiosity impel them to desire
it, they may easily inform themselves by º; the Assize reports, which have faute de
news been overrunning all the papers. They will learn there that the course which is pursued
in bottling voters, like as the course of true love, but rarely runneth smoothly. They will
read that in one recent case “much violence was resorted to,” and that in another “the
voter was much bruised.” And reading this, their feelings will incline them to agree with
us that it is high time at this present that such bottling should be stopped.
We are not Teetotallers, and would never stop a bottle where legitimately pushed. But
to bottle up a voter is to push him to extremities, and as this is an infringement of the free-
dom of the subject, while this is a free country we cannot but complain of it., There is
too much body in such bottling to please us, and they who make a trade of it deserve to
et their knuckles rapped. Although no friends to bribery, we like it better than coercion.
e don't so much object to treating voters to a bottle, but to bottle them up bodily amounts
to false imprisonment, which there ought to be most stringent and deterring laws to stop.
The lightest punishment awarded for bottling a voter ought to be, to send the bottler for a
twelvemonth to the Jug.
BRIGHAM YOUNG, PAPA.
AccorDING to a conversation which HoRACE
GREELEY, of the New York Tribune, had with the
High Priest or Archhumbug of the Mormons,
Pio NoNo has a formidable Antipope in BRIGHAM
YoUNg. BRIGHAM pretends that his Church is
not only infallible, but is moreover instructed by
direct revelation, through himself of course, so
that he is not obliged to wait till an opinion has
ºil. ground and become general among the
Mormonites before he ventures to publish it as
a new dogma. BRIGHAM is a cock that crows on
his own peculiar elevation to precisely the same
tune as that of his rival on the Seven. Hills.
Witness the following portion of his dialogue
with H. G.
“H. G. : Then I am to understand that you regard
other Churches professing to be Christian as the Church
of Rome regards all Churches not in communion with
itself—as schismatic, heretical, and out of the way of
salvation ?–B. Y. : Yes, substantially.”
PIUs says BRIGHAM is not in the way of sal-
vation, and BRIGHAM says that PIUs is out of it.
What is this more than “Cockadoodledoo!” on
the one side and on the other? Only the Yankee
cock crows higher than the Italian one. The
Pope of Utah, moreover, has much more reason
in some of his apostolical versions and renderings
than the Pope of Rome. For example:—
“H. G. : Does not the Apostle PAUL say that a Bishop
should be “the husband of one wife?'—B. Y.: So we
hold. We do not regard any but a married man as fitted
for the office of Bishop. But the Apostle does not forbid
a Bishop having more wives than one.”
A Bishop, says the text, as enlarged by Pope
BRIGHAM, should be the husband of one wife at
least. As retrenched by the other Pope, it is
consistent with a canon which makes one wife
for a Bishop one too many. Is not the Antipope's
addition to the plain words of the precept a little
more reasonable than the Pope's subtraction
from them?
THE DISTURBANCES IN THE
EASTERN CHURCH.
WE are sorry to find that the Eastern Church,
namely, St. George's in the East, has become
infected with the same follies and superstitions
as those which have hitherto been limited to the
Western Churches, particularly St. Barnabas's
and St. Paul's. Clergymen officiate in the
Eastern Church attired in the very height of
Puseyite fashion, wearing vestments of gay and
gaudy colours; green for example, and, for aught
we know, mauve. They also give themselves the
same ridiculous airs and graces as their brethren,
we might almost say their sisters, in the Churches
of the West. As in the West so in the East,
these innovations have excited great tumults
among the laity, attended with manifestations of
an iconoclastic spirit, which reverend gents who
think fit to make images, figures, or Guys of
themselves had better beware of.

BockFRs, AND DECLARES THEY ARE THE Most comfortABLE THINGS
PossIBLE ; AND so THEY ARE.
PUNCHPS IMAGINARY CORRESPONDENCE.
WISCOUNT PALMERSTON to LoRD JoHN RUSSELL.
“My DEAR John, “ Broadlands, Sept. 19.
“HAVING a little time upon my hands, I cannot, I think, do
better than fulfil an intention which I have for some time entertained,
and address to you a few words of advice, which I am as sure that you
need as that, you will take it in good part. Our long, intimacy, the
similarity and intensity of our political convictions, besides my having
a year or two's advantage (as it is amusingly called) over you in age,
will be my excuse for this course, if any excuse be needed.
“With the sanction of my Sovereign, my dear John, I have placed
you in a situation of great responsibility. It is a situation which I
myself filled for many years, an º rather than myself, shall say
how. I assure you, my dear John, that it will give me the most sin:
cere pleasure to recognise in you a worthy successor to myself; and
that I may have, in the afternoon of life, that gratification, is one of
#: un reasons, and possibly a selfish one, for my now taking you in
all Cl.
“My task would be an easier, one, my dear John, but for your
extreme ignorance. Do not recoil at the word, or, as you sit in your
library flºº indignantly round at books, most of them larger than
yourself, which you have laboriously read, sedulously analysed, and
disgracefully disfigured with your profound marginal notes. I will do
you no injustice, I believe that the Oxford Examiners would do you
some did they pluck you for shortcomings in history. I am sure that
you know Fº well that MAXIMILIAN THE SEconD, of Germany,
married the daughter of the EMPEROR CHARLEs THE FIFTH, that
Louis THE FourTEENTH declared the Gallican Church independent in
1682, that LoRD CHATHAM, as MR. PITT, supported the Broad
Bottom Ministry, and that Mr. Wrigºroñº's Biſſor abolishing the
Slave Trade was rejected by the House of Lords in 1804. Pray, my
dear John, do not suppose that I accuse }. of being ignorant of
knowing myriads of things the knowledge of which is entirely useless.
I should be most reluctant to put myself in the position of the Blind
Beggar of Bethnal Green with you, and drop my fact and date (as he
dropped money against his daughter's lovers) against your fact and
date. I should be bankrupt in no time.
. “But, my dear John, your ignorance is of another and more serious
kind. You do not know men, and what is of more consequence, you
do not know women. ... You really amuse me (or would do so if I could
be amused at the misfortunes of my beloved country) when I see you
in Society attempting to gain the confidence of the former, or the good-
will of the latter. Believe me, my dear John, no highly virtuous youth
from a Dissenting College, with Dwight's Theology on his table as his
prize for an Essay on fredestination, could be more convinced that he
was the eighth wonder of the world, or more certain to be at the beat
a wonder whose º the ...” fixes at the ninth day. I
wish, my dear John, that I could make you a man of the world.
º flet me instance, for a moment, a case or two in point, and you
will forgive me, when you, observe how intently, and affectionately I
must have watched you. At a party at your own house a few evenings
before the termination of the Session, you may remember that
D'Azeglio came up to you, and after a grimace or so, which you did
not very happily imitate he asked you whether you had sent off a
certain despatch. What he wanted to know, of course, was whether I
had seen it, and you maturally wished him to think I had not. What
was your foolish answer? “Un bon cheval n'a pas besoin d’éperon,”
with a half-toss of º: head. He did not want to spur you, he wanted
to know a fact, an 3. pert little answer was not evasive, only cha-
racteristic. Why did you not say point blank that you had sent it.
You know quite well that you had not, so no harm could have been
done. Why not, my dear John, be frank and natural? Those dusty
little sayings which you, hoard up, because you can pronounce them
glibly, are really out of date. -
“Well, then, at LADY PALMERSTON's assembly, the next night, a
lady asked you a question about the Villafranca treaty. It was a silly
question, and intended to be, but it was not sillily put, nor is the asker
a silly woman. She had no business to ask it, when has a woman any
business to ask the things she does? But she certainly got a sillier
answer, and it was intended for a wise one. You must out with
another of your proverbs, “Une femme ne cele que ce qu’elle ne sait pas.”
# dear John, it was very pedantic and almost, rude. Why, on earth
did you not explain to the woman confidentially anything that came
into your head, and send, her away pleased with your confidence, and
utterly mystified? As it is, wait till you want her to keep young
GABBLETON in town for a division. - -
. “Now, my dear JoHN, consider what I have said, and in your deal.
ings with the world try to be a little more a man of the world. You
have industry, andB. and a certain amount of brains, which in
the brother of the ſure of B. may be called talent, and you ; do
a good deal for yourself if you would not be old-fashioned and pedantic,
and would have a little more bonhommie–there’s a French word for
you as a sugarplum to sweeten the bitters.
... “I need hardly caution you to keep this letter to yourself, and burn
it when read.
“Always, my dear John,
“Yours, faithfully,
* The LORD JOHN RUSSELL.” “PALMERSTON.”
LORD JoHN RUSSELL to WISCOUNT PALMERSTON.
“MY DEAR LORD, “ Fichmond, Sept. 20.
“I AM favoured with your Lordship's letter dated the 19th
instant, but received this morning, at 11 A.M. - -
“That the Prime Minister of England has time “upon his hands’ is a
circumstance which may be differently interpreted by those who form
different opinions of the individual holding that office. I am unaware
that MR. Fox or my LoRD MEI Bourne ever complained of having too
much time for the business of the º: - - -
“Waiving the other, points in your Lordship's introductory, para-
graph, and especially the reference to the intensity of political con-
victions on the part of a Minister whose earnest devotion to Reform
actually makes him, tremble to approach it, I would observe that I
believe your Lordship was born in 1784, and that my natal year was
1792. Your Lordship is Fº to compliment, me on a certain
acquaintance with dates, and it is due to myself to show that the credit
is not entirely undeserved. - -
“Your Lordship will be good enough to receive my protest against
the assumption that i. placed me anywhere. I have, in my time, had
most reluctantly to place your Lordship outside a Cabinet, but I cannot
admit that you have been in a condition to place me in one. In the
* into which I entered from a sense of duty to my country,
and for the purpose of removing my LoRD DERBY from office, the
choice of place was my own, and I should have selected the Premier-
ship, but for feeling that the Foreign Qffice required, more states:
manship than the nominal headship of the Government. To the implied
and scarcely decent allusion to the Sovereign, it may suffice for me to
remind your Lordship of a certain . procured by me for a
Minister who neglected the trifling formality of acquainting his QUEEN
with the contents of his foreign despatches. - - -
“Passing over a variety of phrases, which would be impertinent in
an individual less accustomed to substitute impertinence for pleasantry,
I would simply remark, that your Lordship's successes in this world by
no means justify your adopting a dictatorial line. I could find in the
books, to which you make taunting allusion, more profitable rea
than the study of your Lordship's career, but I do not think I shoul
detect in one of them an instance of an individual assuming to be
a statesman, and at the close of a long career of alternated hollow
triumph and helpless tumble, preaching Insincerity as the leading
article of his political faith.

“I shall not enter into detail, my dear Lord, or vindicate myself for
what it suited me to sayin well-watched conversations in your drawing-

CHIVALRY IN EXCELSIS.
HE man who would refuse to
stretch forth his hand—and so
forth. When did Mr. Punch
ever decline to help a lady who
wanted anything? The perse-
vering way in which the doings
of his friend “MRs. Jones
of Plateglass” are perpetually
brought before the "excited
world really deserves all the
co-operation he can afford.
Whether he entirely shares
the Plateglass idea that the
universe watches the Plate-
glass movements as astrono-
mers watch comets, or Lord
John watches PALMERSTON, is
beside the question. Mr. Punch
is far too chivalrous to be par-
ticular. He had not read any
announcement about Plate-
glass for at least three weeks,
when he suddenly lighted upon
a statement in a Welsh paper
that “MRs. Jon Es of Plate-
glass, whose carriage was re-
cently upset, has recovered
from the effects of theaccident.”
The paragraph does not say whether the lady was in, the carriage;
but, presuming that such were the case, and that all is well (had
he an idea that all were not so, of course he would split up his pen
into Welsh consonants sooner than joke, on the matter) he proceeds
at once to º the desired publicity and to offer his gallant
homage to the lady, thus:-
“MRs. Jones of Plateglass,
Going over a pass, -
Was upset, her postilion most likely an ass:
But since the Welsh stones
Have demolished no bones,
Punch begs to congratulate dear MRs. Jon Es.”
The Laureate Abroad and at Home.
ALFRED TENNyson has just returned from a visit to Lisbon.
Curiosity having been expressed about the motive of his voyage,
Mr. Punch is authorised to state, that it was not for the purpose of
adding a sprig of Portugal laurel to his English garland. Had the
visit been to Spain instead of Portugal, one might have supposed it
i. ſh a performance on the LAUREATE's official instrument,
the Sack-butt.
CON. FOR A COCKNEY.
WHY is the extra Income-Tax like a Whirlpool.
Because it’s a vortex. (IPartar.)
LOOK TO YOUR GOLD DIGGINGS.
A VoICE from Backworth, Victoria, the voice of a British subject,
crles—
“I am one of 200,000 men who live in one of England's colonies; we each, upon
an average, export close upon £100 sterling, the greater part to the mother country.
. . We can muster something like 10,000 weapons, muskets, rifles, &c.; as to
ammunition, we have no powder unless it is for blasting purposes. . . . In our
chief towns we have movable property worth £20,000,000, houses, gardens, &c.,
that have cost us twice as much, but we are so ill-protected that 1,000 men, similar
to Englishmen, could levy £5,000,000 from us as a ransom, or could do our property
damage to the extent of £70,000,000. Besides which, there is shipping and property
of England always in Hobson's Bay to the extent of millions."
Is there any occasion to quote more of this sort of thing? Isn't
it obviously the preface to a demand for a vote of an enormous sum
to provide a fleet, an army, and fortifications for the defence of
Melbourne? There is necessity for a little further quotation, as the
conclusion to the foregoing statement is not what previous experience
would lead any one to anticipate:—
“We do not wish to beg—what we need we can pay for. All we ask from the
home Government is, say, 50,000 or 100,000 rifles, with bayonets and ammunition.
Your War Minister may draw upon us for the amount. We will not dishonour his
draft. You should send out, say, three heavy-armed gun or dispatch steam vessels.
You often send more where they are less needed.”
This |. will of course be attended to as soon, as Parliament
meets, unless Parliament is saved that trouble, which it might, be,
easily. Why should not an association of enterprising capitalists
forthwith supply the Melbourne people with all the arms and ammu-
nition they want? Their demand for weapons and gunpowder, might
speedily be met by a joint-stock company, of limited, and very limited,
liability, since the customers would be sure pay, and, '...i in urgent
want of the desired articles, would doubtless give a good price for
them. Their want is pressing. Are there no Filibusters in America,
and elsewhere? Russia is in want of a loan: suppose she were to go
in a man-of-war or two, and borrow money of Australia, on her own
terms?" The French Colonels have never yet thought of sacking
Melbourne—the enterprise would be more profitable and less difficult
than a similar attempt upon London; where, though they might grab
considerable booty, they might not be able .. to get off with
it. Australia has now no protection from the Colonels, but the mode:
ration of the EMPEROR, and sea-sickness, which would perhaps forbid
their voyage to the Antipodes, because, in the present, state of our
own national defences, it is the principal obstacle to their crossing
the Channel.
AN ERROR OF THE PRESS THAT WANTS
CORRECTING.
WE extract the following advertisement from the Athenaeum :-
REPORTER WANTED.—WANTED, on a Newspaper in a small
Town in the West of England, a REPORTER and READER, who would be also
required to keep the Accounts, and attend to the publishing of the paper. One
practically acquainted with Printing indispensable. Address, &c. &c.
We wonder what the salary would be of the above rarity that is
wanted. It ought to be something stupendously large, for we notice
that the reporter is expected to do the work of no less than five separate
individuals. . He must be reporter, reader, accountant, publisher, and
something of a printer. The remuneration ought to be correspondin l
comprehensive. Our only wonder is, that the list of required .#
cations stopped so short as it has done. . It might with equal justice
and good taste have been extended much further. Why have not laid
it down that no one need apply who could not clean the windows,
sweep out the º put the children to bed, drive a donkey-cart to
market, and make himself 5. useful when company came to
dimer; .# might, also, have been said about wearing a livery,
and following behind the family, and carrying the prayer-books, when it
went in grand parade to church on Sundays. e reporter on a pro-
vincial paper is sadly to be pitied. He is expected to know, something
of everything, and to do a little of everything. Qccasionally he walks
in the course of the day as much as a postman. He must be ready at
a moment's notice to run into the country some five or ten miles, to
attend a coroner's inquest, or to pay court for days to the chief con-
stable of some distant district, in order to pick up some exclusive
information about a recently ºpºd murderer. He must sacrifice
his time, his rest, his meals, his tastes—everything to his employer.
As for sleep, he must sleep where he can, and at what hours he can.
So long as the steam-engine is panting for “copy,” he must not think
of closing his eyes. The provincial reporter occupies on the press,
pretty much the same position as a governess holds in society. He is
equally hard-worked, and not much better paid. We should like to
put, for a short time, the proprietºr of the above “newspaper in a
small town in the West of England” to do what he modestly demands
of the encyclopediac reporter he is in search of, and we will warrant
that, after a week's hard fagging at it, he would willingly purchase
his release by exchanging places with his maid-of-all-work.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PENAL SHIRT-MAKING.
CAN, anyone have forgotten the Song of the Shirt, which—as every-
body should know—was first printed in these columns? Here is a
case to bring that canticle, to mind: a case brought the other day
before the Hammersmith Police Court:—
“EMILY DAwes, an attenuated and sickly-looking woman, living at Key's Terrace,
Hammersmith, was placed in the dock before MR. PAYNTER charged with illegally
pawning several soldiers' shirts which had been given to her to make up.
** MR. MARTIN said he *Pºliº on behalf of the prosecutor, who was the sub-
contractor for the making of military clothing under the contractor to the Govern-
ment, and he did so with great pain, as he believed the offence had been committed
through the paltry pittance which was allowed for making up of shirts for soldiers
and sailors. His client received 5s. 6d. a dozen for the making of the shirts, and he
employed women, who worked at them for 4s. 5d. a dozen, so that he had only a
profit of 1s. a dozen.
shirts which had been given him to be made up, and according to his contract he
was compelled to i.º. all good. He was therefore obliged, although reluc-
tantly, to press the charge against the prisoner."
A profit of “only” one shilling on an º of four and sixpence, is
at the rate of more than 25 per cent. Tr º: whose business
brings them “only” this percentage, can afford to lose a part of it b
the pilferings and losses which are and ever will be incidental to suc
trades. We therefore cannot pump much Fº up for any sub-contrac-
tor who ; chance to have been robbed of twenty dozen of his shirts.
The sympathy we feel is for the victims of this system of sub-sub-sub-
contracting, which so sicklies” and “attenuates” the poor folk who
do the work. As the Magistrate remarked:—
“These contracts often ed º many more hands than Mr. MARTIN had
mentioned in this case. e then asked if the women had to find their own thread
in making up the shirts at 43. 6d. a dozen.
“MR. MARTIN said they had. He also said that the shirts were made for the
Government at 1s. 10d. each.”
The thread which women have to find, when making shirts at the
starvation price of four-and-sixpence * dozen, is not alone the thread
which, the linen-draper sells them. Life hangs by a thread, and 'tis the
thread of their own lives which they so often quite use up, or cut short
in the process. But it is no good talking sentiment. The question is
if something can't be done, and that at once, to stop the strain upon
this thread which in so many sicklied shirt-stitchers is so fast wearing
out. On this point hear a man who is entitled to a hearing;-
“MR. PAYNTER said it was a melancholy case, and he was afraid there was no
cure for it. They could not think of regulating the labour market to prevent what
was called “sweating,” but he thought the public would be much benefitted if that
kind of work was made up in prisons. It was the right employment, and succeeded
very well in the German prisons and the other parts of the Continent. He had
pressed those views upon the authorities, but they met with strong objections. He
sentenced the prisoner to pay le. 10d., the value of the shirt, and a fine of 20s., or
14 days' imprisonment.
“The prisoner was locked up in default.”
What the “strong objections” were, we are curious to know, Very
possibly the knowledge might convince us of their strength; but we
own that in our ignorance we think that penal shirtmaking would
rove a most effective and deterring form of punishment. We cannot
º opining that our gaols would be less popular, were our criminals
to be sentenced to learn scwing and make shirts; being dieted the
while with the same amount of food as our poor starving sempstresses
are able to afford themselves. Perhaps this might not wholly “cure,”
but it would certainly, we think, reduce the sweating system; which
the Government should do its best to throw, cold water on, instead of
fostering and fomenting, as seems, now to be the case. Penal shirt-
making would be more useful work than crank-turning; and if worthy
MR. PAYNTER’s views were rightly carried out, our soldiers would no
longer be of those of whom 'tis said—
“It is not linen you’re wearing out,
But human creatures' lives.”
PRETTY PIGS.
“MR. PUNCH
“if you'll look into the Builder o' last wake, you'll wind
there’s an interestun article in un about ‘Pigs’ and *Whistles." A
chap, one MR. H. N. SEALEY, as zims to be a cleverish zort of a feller
read a peaper tother day at a meetin' o' the Zummerzet Harkalogic
'Ziety on the word Pig. , Well,—there,’tis too much of a preamble to

for a maaid. I never knowed afore that Pig and Gal was zo near akin.
Well, there, they be boath on 'em good creturs in their proper places,
—which is rayther different, I’ll allow; and then there's another
difference ’tween a zow and a young ooman, which Is’pose I needn't
hardly pint out to you, -that is to say, the more score a zow is the
better; but, as for t; tother, one score is enough for she, and if so be

During the last few weeks his client had lost 20 dozen of

THE FRENZIED FRIENDS! A TALE OF TERROR!
jºurn to SNooks, “My SNooks, what makes you look so
serious?”
Said S.Nooks to SMITH, “My friend, I have a silent sorrow here,”—
giving a big thump upon his well filled waistcoat. -
“A sorrow? and you silent? Pooh, pooh, don’t be foolish. ‘Give
sorrow words: the #. that does not speak,’ goes and bursts its
boiler, or does something quite as dreadful. Come, tell me what's
the matter. Say. Has ANGELINA flirted? Have you been and
dropped your door-key? Have you done a little bill, and has the bill
returned the compliment? Has your uncle CROEsus cut you? Have
you smashed your favourite cutty? Have you been drinking some
Catawba? Have you got the stomach-ache? Have you—”
“Peace, friend, ºf I will tell you,” sighed the wretched SNooks.
“A far worse fate than these is that which hath befallen me. Know
that I this morning have met the miscreant Jones, and he hath as
usual asked me a-c—co—”
“Speak, wretched one!” gasped SMITH. “Say, was it a conundrum ?”
“Alas, yes!”, groaned the other. “An unutterable conundrum;
one that would have palsied any lips but Jones's ; one that like a
poison-shaft still rankles in my breast, and grieves me to the heart's
core to reflect on man's depravity.” -
“Out with it then, my S.Nooks. 'Twill ease your mind to tell it me,
I am robust in health. You need not fear my fainting.” -
Moved by his friend's appeal, poor SNooks, in a low voice, made
this terrific revelation:—
“Why is the EARL of SHAFTESBURY not unlike NANA SAHIB P”
“Because he is a person who is vile and tropical.”
A pause of just ten minutes and three seconds for reflection.
'ell, where’s the joke?” gasped SMITH. -
“There, I knew you wouldn’t see it. I can't tell jokes as Jones
can. Would you believe it, my dear boy, the wretch jºured
those three last words so as to sound like ‘philanthropical/?”

fiding to each other in secret how old they were; and it was found
that their united ages amounted to one hundred and twenty-five years.
The most singular thing, however, is, that the daughters of these six
ladies—and each lady had one—were in the next room, trying over the
last new Polka; and, upon calculating their united ages, the result
revealed the astounding fact that, though not yet married, still º
were older than their Šiº. by seven years, eleven months, an
fourteen days! The mystery is still unexplained; and yet we should
be loth to accuse the young ladies, for the purpose of gaining a victory
of no moment whatever, of having made themselves out to be older
than they really were.
One-Sided Constructions.
MANY of us, too many of us, are apt to attribute a bad motive to a
good action; but few o us, when a poor devil has been guilty of a bad
action, ever think of attributing a good motive to it.

“A FOOL AND HIS LUGGAGE.”
A TALE OF THE EASTERN COUNTIES RAILWAY.
S º dear Punch,
you will please to re-
member -
Is the day of St. Partridge
—the first of September,
We expect you on Wednes-
day to tiffin: --
Bring your best double gun
and your own shooting-
traps
You will find a small party
—the right sort of chaps.
Believe me, yours truly,
A. BIFFIN.”
Such the letter (’twas dated
from somewhere near
Lynn)
| Set me off in a cab, the ex-
press train to win,
Full drive to the Bishops-
gate Station. -
The famed Eastern Counties
—that theme of abuse—
Famed for cooking its own and its passengers' goose,
Beyond any line in the nation.
I paid double cab-fare; so fierce was my haste;
But the station once reached I repented the waste.
Eastern Counties expresses don't hurry. -
There was pushing and rushing and struggling and bustling,
Crushing toes, barking shins, Porters heaving and hustling–
And shouting, and swearing, and scurry.
Leather gun-cases rattled about one by scores,
Coupled pointers seemed jammed up in all of the doors,
In a chaos of muzzles and tails. -
'Twas ten minutes past time, but serene o'er the riot,
All reckless of Bradshaw, in dignified quiet,
The Engine stood calm on the rails.
They seized on my º: they gave me no ticket, .
When I asked, I was thrust through a strait platform-wicket,
And hustled up into a seat. -
And I inwardly murmured, 'twixt sulking and stun,
“Your will, Eastern Counties Directors, be done,”
When—oh joy—’tis the Engine's quick beat!
On, through Stratford and Waltham and Broxbourne and all,
As but Eastern Counties expresses can crawl,
Through flat Essex, as flatly, we glide:
Stopping, where no express but an Eastern would stop,
Where there’s no one to take up and no one to drop,
And in Cambridge at length we subside.
And there was the scena of Shoreditch again—
The row and the riot—the struggle and strain–
The push, and the press, and the pull.
Breathless haste, where of calm and good order was need,
And slowness, where passengers fretted for speed-
Great cry and—alas!—little wool.
So to Ely and last-fifty minutes o'er due,
Patient * ims, to Lynn's ancient city we drew—
With delight from my carriage I tear.
Quick! my gun-case—my bag—or, as I am a sinner,
Ishan’t get to BIFFINs in time for their dinner—
NoR MY BAG, NoF MY GUN-CASE WERE THERE!
+ - - + - - + -
My pet double Moore, that I longed to display
Drºgº; birds, right and left, on St. Partridge, his day;
hooting coat—that 'twas pleasure to wear;
Shooting trousers, impervious to wet or to whin;
Shooting boots, old and easy, ;: fitting like skin—
—all—far away—who knows where !
I bullied—I blustered—entreated, cajoled—
Eastern Counties officials are cruel and cold,
All the more as their victims are hot—
* Pr'aps mythings were at Norwich—or Wisbeach,” they said,
“Or at Bury, or Yarmouth, or Lowestoff, instead:”
But at Lynn it was clear they were not.
“Why make such a fuss?, Things were frequently lost;
Lusº would get mislaid, when so many lines crost—”
hey'd telegraph for it—of course.
“Perhaps I might get it in course of to-morrow
Pr'aps a week or a month hence,” meanwhile ºf might borrow.
‘Only clothes—it was well’twas no worse.”
Why pursue the sad tale? All the time of my stay,
My º: and bag—were still far, far, away—
} my friends I was rigged for the sport.
Need I say that my gun was a bad second-best,
How tight were the trousers—how º; the west,
And the boots—oh, how cruelly short |
But if, in the stubbles, I looked like a Guy,
'Twas still worse, when the dinner-bell sounded, and I,
In borrowed plumes had to appear—
Dress boots, never-mention-ems, waistcoat and coat,
By charity rigged from my toes to my throat—
Need I say that my pangs were severe!
My pleasure was F.T.' three days were o'er,
I was fretting and fuming to Shoreditch once more,
To the lost-luggage-office I rushed—
Quoth the bland office-keeper, “Your things, Sir, are here,
At Bury they’ve been, though how, isn't so clear.”
I gazed–BUT THE MAN NEVER BLUshed:
ENGLISHMEN AND ENGLISH.
WHY cannot plain Englishmen take the pains to write plain English?
This is not a riddle, reader. It is to us a painful question, and by
no means one to laugh at. We cannot ourselves answer it, and we
know nobody who can, and that is one, chief reason why, to ease qur
minds, we print it. . #very reader will of course oblige us with his
views about it, and if our mind be not enriched, our waste-paper store
at least will be. We repeat, then,
Why cannot plain Englishmen take the pains to write plain English *
Every day we find fresh cause to pop this most momentous question,
Dip into any column of advertisements we will, we are sure at the first
plunge to bring up some new reason for it., Here for instance is a
specimen fished from a shipping journal, which will serve as illustration
of the truth of what we state. With the exception of the names, for
which we only are responsible, the extract runs—or halts, rather—
verbatim thus:–
“TO SHIPPERS AND MERCHANTS IN GENERAL.
“LINDLEY, MURRAY, & Co., General Agents, London, would say that, in
every description of Scotch, Woollen, Cotton and Linen manufacturers, as well as
Manchester and Leeds goods, they can be supplied as well, as quickly, and with as
much satisfaction in every respect—more satisfaction, as L. M. & Co. are always on
the spot, and undertake nothing which they cannot perform with despatch, as it is
possible to do.
“All communications promptly attended to in person or by letter.”
L. M. & Co. would clearly, we should say, be something more than
ſº if what, they, tell us of their business were true:
which it is not. We º: flatly on this point, for we wish not to
speak sharply; and we doubt not that L. M. & Čo would prefer to be
accused of stating an untruth, than to be charged with what amounts
to a grave criminal offence. £ngland is not a slave state; “manufac.
turers” are not here articles of merchandise, and it is therefore wron
to class them with “Manchester and Leeds goods.” . When L. §
& Co. assert, that they can deal in “manufacturers,” they accuse
themselves of what in fact amounts to body-snatching; for no live
manufacturer by law is saleable in England, whatever chance of pur-
chase there may be for a dead one. -
Were we not persuaded that L. M. & Co. are stating an untruth, we
should certainly reveal their real names to the police; for not only is
their trade, by their own showing, an illegal one, but they lead us to
infer that others are engaged in it. Their phrases of comparison can
but be construed to mean this ; and the puzzling, incompleteness of
their “ases” and their “more” we attribute to the startling nature
of their statement, which was enough to frighten grammar clean out
of their heads.
A Slight Misprint.
“The German smokers are, it appears, in an ecstacy of delight in consequence
of a report that PRofesson LIEbro has discovered a mode of º: ordinary
tobacco the perfume and flavour of the finest Havannah. It is said that the most
experienced connoisseurs have been put to the test, and have smoked the prepared
tobacco in the belief that it was the finest Cuban.”–Morning Paper.
MR. PUNCH is compelled to record his a priori conviction, that this
#: is attributed to the wrong Professor. It was made not by
LIEBIG, but by BIG-LIE.

ITALY'S PARTIAL SUCCESSES.
(A Song from the Moniteur.)
CoNFOUND you Italians!, myself, you rascalions,
Your conduct extremely distresses,
Great objects unheeding—these hence not suc-
ceeding-
You seek little partial successes.
Successes so little, that we gain no tittle,
My policy all in a mess is
Because you derange it, and forcemetochange it
By those little partial successes.
I feel an objection to that wrong direction
n which your new freedom progresses:
Your Princes expelling, and thus by rebelling,
You win little partial successes.
I had for you other designs which you bother—
| in short what I wish to impress is,
|My end whilst I’m bent on, your own you’re
intent on— .
All those little partial successes.
French Idiosyncrasy.
A FRENch Paper boasts that France of all
nations, is the only one that goes to war for an
| idea. England at any rate, fights, no more on
that account. She is not such an idiot.

A SMALL POPE PIUS.
We read in the Papers that a few days ago there appeared, before
MR. LONG, at Marylebone, a Roman Catholic, priest, named Robert
SMITH, “attached to the Roman, Catholic Chapel, Kentish Town,”
charged with an assault upon a child named JoHN Cox. The evidence
was as follows:—
“John Norwood, residing near the chapel, said that on Sunday evening he saw
several children, among whom was the complainant, at the door of the chapel, who
were knocking at the door. The defendant came out, upon which the children ran
away. They were followed by the defendant, who upon coming up to the com-
plainant struck him with his hand, when he fell. While complainant was on the
ground he was struck by the defendant three or four times. hen he got up his
mouth seemed full of blood and his cheek was grazed.
“In answer to the defendant, he said he had no stick.
“MARy Cox, complainant's mother, stated that her son was four years and five
months old. She fetched him from the chapel, when she found his mouth, nose,
and cheek bleeding.
“The defendant stated that he did not knock the complainant down, and that he
ell while he was running away.
“Defendant was fined 10s, which was paid.”
The REVEREND ROBERT SMITH º to have been so very much
“ attached,” as the reporter says, to his chapel, he could not bear its
door to receive a knock from the hand of a child. Little children are
evidently not suffered to come to that temple. The REVEREND Robert
SMITH defended himself, and stated that he did not knock the com-
plainant down. Probably this was true, the hurry of a child of four
{. old to get out of the way of a full grown and furious, clergyman
eing quite enough to cause it to tumble, and we should be sorry to
see a minister of religion unjustly accused. But the REVEREND
RoBERT SMITH had nothing to sa ºf to the report, to the
charge of beating little John NY Cox when he was down, or, if he
did say anything on the point, the Magistrate did not believe
the REVEREND RoBERT, and mulcted him in ten of his namesakes. It
will doubtless be a lesson to his Reverence, but Father Punch, in
addition, hereby prescribes to the sinner, for his soul's health, to sa
nineteen Paternosters every morning before breakfast for a week, an
while doing so, to meditate upon the meaning of the words (if he under-
stands Latin), and consider whether frightening babies till they fall
down and make their faces bleed, and wopping them when down, is a
proceeding exactly in accordance with the spirit and teaching of the
orison he is rººf.
But, culpa nostra/ The REveREND Robert will have a triumphant
answer for impertinent heretics. Who is Mr. Punch * Is he to dictate
to the clergy? Let the profane party mind his own business. Is not
the REVEREND MR. SMITH simply imitating the head of his own
church, His Holiness Pope PERUGIA? Of a surety he is. Were not
the poor little Perugians .."; in a small but possibly troublesome
way at the door of the Vatican, begging for liberty. And what did
the Pope to his children? Why, even as did the RevPREND Robert
SMITH to the children of Kentish Town. Rushing forth frantically
in the form of a Swiss Guard, he, Pope PERVGIA, stabbed, shot, and
slaughtered his troublesome children by way of a lesson in holy living
and dying. Nay, the REveREND SMIth smote a child of the ripe age
of four years, but the REveREND Pius caused an actual baby in arms
to be killed, because it had been decorated with a cockade of a colour
º: at Rome. The Kentish Town priest is not equal to his
laster.
SMITH is fined Ten Shillings. PIUs is not yet in custody. But
there is good hope that ere long the Italian culprit will be fined a
Crown.

THE LAST SWEET THING IN HATS,
SUBSTITUTES FOR MILITARY FLOGGING.
To Colonel NoFTH, M.P.
MY DEAR Colonel,
IN proposing “The Army and Navy” the other day, at Ban-
bury, you are reported to have told the farmers that—
“The punishment of flogging for desertion in the Army had only been lately
sanctioned by Parliament in the Mutiny Act, and it was absolutely necessary.
because during last year alone there were no less than 11,000 desertions, and it
must be borne in mind that every soldier cost the country for his kit and his bounty
alone E6 18s, independently of which a large expense was incurred in drill.”
Absolutely necessary, my dear, Colonel? Will you, on reflection,
adhere to the statement, that flogging is absolutely necessary to prevent
desertion from the Army? Is the British Army so uncomfortable a
i. that, but for the terror of the lash, the soldiers would burst
their confines, and break out of it? Is it, indeed, too hot to hold any
private soldier, undeterred from quitting it by the tormenting scourge
of the military guardian furies? And is it the fact, that the number of
deserters last year amounted to anything like eleven thousand—
allowance being made for the rascals who re-enlisted to sack a second
bounty? Can you think of no better means of preventing such whole:
sale desertion than tying º the wretches who are guilty of it and
torturing them? . y not...For I find you, in continuation,
making this acknowledgment:-“With regard to the punishment of
flogging, he had no hesitation in saying that it was a degrading punish-
ment, but it was intended to be a º: one. No doubt it was a
Severe º and he himself had seen both officers and men
faint while it was .# inflicted, and if MR. BRIGHT, or any other
man, would provide an effectual substitute, he had no doubt the whole
Army would gladly receive it.”. - - -
“Hear, hear,” cried your audience #. this last expression of
opinion. I, too, say, hear, hear. Wanted then, an effectual sub-
stitute for flogging Can f suggest any? Čertainly not any simply
penal substitute, at once more effectual and milder. A more effectual
substitute of that kind would be a severer one. You sometimes brand
deserters in addition to flogging them. Well, suppose you branded
them—not by tattooing, but, more majorum, with a red-hot iron.
The superaddition of branding to flogging would be more effectual
than mere flogging. ...; ear-cropping, and other the like
good old inflictions, would doubtless produce increased effect of the
same kind. And if you tore a man's back with red-hot pincers, instead
of, knotted cords, you would probably find the pincers an effectual
substitute for the cat-o'-nine-tails.
But must the substitute, to be effectual, be penal?, Must we take
this point for granted? Could desertion be stopped by encouraging
soldiers to remain in the Army as well as by discouraging them from
deserting it? ... I suspect it might. Better permanent pay, the stipu-
lated amount hº paid in cash, the chance of promotion, and com-
fortable, and decent quarters, would, perhaps, if the idea of any
alternative for punishment can be entertained,—constitute an efficient
substitute for floggi Might not one of the causes of desertion, for
example, be removed by remedying, in barracks, that inconvenience
which is similar to the Carrier's grievance in Henry IV. P. The cause
ceasing, the effect ceases—would not, the abolition of the causes of
desertion, in so far as they can be abolished, prove a substitute for
flogging, effectual, in such a measure as at least to render corporal
punishment not absolutely necessary? The substitute would be ex-
pensive P. It would hardly cost so much, however, after the rate, as a
state of things in which five thousand soldiers are found to jump at an
opportunity of getting, discharged from service. . This is not the con-
temptible fancy of a blank civilian, but the opinion of the PRINCE
Consort's gallant comrade,
FIELD MARSHAL PUNCH.
P.S. Recollect, the lash was once thought absolutely necessary in
madhouses, but now its employment has given place to humane treat-
ment, and the substitute has proved effectual.

OH! BARRY and DENIson ne'er shall we get a
Good pair of hands to exhibit our paces,
So long as you two only double your meta.
Physical fists in each other's faces.
If BARRY would make them so weighty no baro-
-Meter could weigh them,-no barrow could carry;
As Time will not wait, but flies on like an arrow,
'Tis meeter that we should not wait for CHARLEs BARRY.
At Ben Rhydding, DENIson seems to be bidding
For lightness of hand—as though old Time would linger;
But Big Ben, himself of his DENIsoN ridding,
Still tolls a lament for the loss of his finger.
Each writes to the “Times,” while the time's flying on:
At each letter the ire of each seems to wax hotter;
SIR CHARLEs gives his deep digs, while warm DENIsox,
From out his cold sheets, throws SIR CHARLEs in hot-water.
Oh! BARRY and DENISON, let us alone;
Or put lands to the work—not of writing a letter—
But as both of you have so much face of your own,
Each take to a face; show which does it the better.
Or let some one else, who’s a little less wroth
Give us hands, that are not only handsome but strong.
While you two—many cooks only spoiling the broth,
May prove to the world that you’re both in the wrong.
AWFUL WARNING.
IN the Bath Chronicle we discover the following appalling para-
graph:–
“CAUTIox to YAwners-On Thursday last, a young man named Dupnose, a
servant to MR. R. Biggenpº N, Peckham East, was in the act of yawning, when his
jaw became dislocated. By no effort of its own could it be brought to its original
position, and with his jaw distended he proceeded a distance of two miles to a
surgeon's, MR. Hooksit, of Hadlow, who replaced it, and no serious consequence
ensued."
If this is true, no father of a family, unless himself a medical man,
will in future allow SIR, ARCHIBALD Alison's History of Europe to
remain in his house. To be sure, the appalling catalogue of SIR. A.A.'s
blunders, set out by a merciless torturer in FRASER's Magazine, must
deter, any humane. Paterfamilias from leaving the ,ton, or, so of
mistakes termed a History within reach of young §: Still, how-
ever, the fate of MR. DipRose should be known in domestic circles.
THE TOBACCO-PIPE OF JOHN SOBIESKY.
“The tobacco-pipe out of which Johann Sobiesky smoked during the siege of
Vienna, and which had been carried away by the French about fifty years ago, hº
lately been sent back to Vienna, and re-instituted to its former place and honours.'
THE relic may well be cherished, but hardly, perhaps, by the govern-
ment which, after being saved from the Turks by the gallant KING OF
Pol:AND, took part in two successive partitions of his kingdom, and
finally joined in the suppression of the liberties of Cracow, I-the very
city in which the Polish monarch, gathered the army which rescued
Vienna from the Mussulman. The whiff of SoBIESKY’s, pipe is the
most fitting emblem of Austrian gratitude; but one would º think
that Austria would like to remind people that her professions of thank-
fulness to the Polish hero expired in smoke.

132 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[SEPTEMBER 24, 1859.
Mr. Timkins (loq.). “What am I sitting up here for Why, they say you can't have too long a
rod for Roach-fishing; so I just invested in a ‘five-and-twenty footer, and this is the only plan I can
hit on for getting at my hook to bait it.”
A POSER FOR THE PUSEYITES.
THE Reverend Swell who has been causing such a shindy at St. George's in the East
º his eccentric toggery and clerical gymnastics, has written a mild letter in defence of those
absurdities, which he contends are needful to the due performance of the service. His
Reverence seems to fancy that people go to Church with the view rather to exercise their
eyes than use their ears; and he º considers that a preacher, to be popular, must
appeal more to the ocular than to the aural sense. It is, doubtless, this idea which disposes
him to argue that much of the impressiveness and influence of the service is dependent
on the visual attractions which it offers; and, therefore, that a clergyman, attending, as
# º: to be looked at more than listened to, is fully justified in being most attentive to
ls uress.
Holding these eccentric views, his Reverence does not so much surprise one by contending
that the effect of the Church service would considerably be heightened if proper vestments
were º: to the performance of each part. Variety is charming, even in a church; and
as, according to his Reyerence, the attraction of a clergyman lies chiefly in his dress, it is
natural to infer that, with at least his female hearers, the oftener he changes it the more he
will attract. In fact, “not to speak Fº a parson, to be popular, should try and copy
the late CHARLEs MATHEws in one of his, “At Homes;” and, in performance of the service
should act up to the pattern of those P. entertainers, who represent at least a score of
characters per night, and the merit of whose acting is the marvellous rapidity with which
* change their dress. ... - -
o carry out these notions, and design the various vestments which a parson ought to
wear, is a work for clergymen-milli
has the pain to laugh at. Yet were Punch to be
consulted upon clerical costume, there is just one
hint which he would like to offer: namely, that
as the sermon is that portion of the service in
which alone the preacher can utter his own
thoughts, it would be well if le delivered it in
suitable attire, such as to those who sat beneath
him might seem an outward sign of what was
really in him. Were this notion carried out,
Punch would forbear to question his dear
brethren, the Puseyites, whether parsons who
talk stuff such as º: which caused this article
might not with some fitness preach their sermons
in a fool's cap.
A MAYOR.—AND SOMETHING
MORE,
In common, he presumes, with all rightminded
persons, Mr. Punch feels always awed in the
resence of a Mayor. Mr. Punch regards a
ſayor as a creature supernatural: a, being
gifted with peculiar, sagacity and wisdom;
whose dicta are too deep for merely common
minds to fathom, and have far surpassed in
º the Oracle of Delphi and the Hermit
of Vauxhall. That Mr. Punch is as correct, in
this, as in whatever other opinions he... has
formed, a hundred proofs at least come daily to
his hand. The one which he selects for present
illustration is a decision, lately given by the
Worshipful of Windsor. The proceedings which
elicited the judgment of this Solomon, were
thus mentioned in the columns of the Wi
Erpress:–
“A º with her son and two young children had
taken shelter from the rain on Friday t under the
South Western Railway Bridge in their boat. Their d
swam across the river, and lay down on an island whic
belonged to Mr. B. M.R. B.'s "watchman' ordered the
young gentleman to fetch the dog off the island. The
reply was, “You may drive him off, if you like, but you
don't suppose that I au going to do it." The man then
tened to tie the dog up, and made use of such re-
marks as lead the lady to remonstrate, and ask * if he
was aware that he was addressing a gentleman in the
presence of a lady." His answer was, "I have spoken to
more gentlemen than ever you did?" The son, hearing
his mother thus insulted, was exasperated, and in the
heat of the moment cried out, “If you don't mind what
you say, I'll blow your brains out!”
That the terrors, of this threat may be º
perly appreciated, the report proceeds to state:
“As there was nothing in the boat but some provisions,
it was not very likely he could carry out this threat: and
the man showed he had no fear of it by still continuing
his abuse.”
In point of fact, the threat was just about as
terrible as if the youth had said “I’ll chuck you
over St., Paul's,” or “I’ll throw you down
Niagara,” or “I’ll come ashore and kick you
into the middle of next week.” Nevertheless,
the man made afterwards pretence that he was
frightened at the youth. So, a warrant was
applied for, and, having nodded through the
case, the Mayor turned to the man's master,
delivered himself thus:-
“I suppose we must bind defendant over to keep the
peace for six months, under a penalty often pounds.”
. This º to the prosecutor to help the
judge to settle what sentence to award, appears
a stroke of such sagacity as nomere mortal could
have struck. Mr. Punch is therefore fortified in
sticking to, his faith, that Mayors are º:
natural, and something more than men. hat
that something more may be, Mr. Punch, in his
reat awe, will not venture to reflect. As a
orse may, by cross-breeding, acquire a more
than equine longitude of ear, so, by virtue of his
office, a Mayor may gain appendages, which fit
him to be viewed as being a Mayor—and Some-
- iners, but not a work for Pulºk. Let the clerical costumiers thing More.
- devise what robes º please; except in wholesome ridicule, Punch cannot spare his space to

There must surely, we should say, be some mistake in this. Curates
surely, must be paid their yearly stipends free of Income Tax. Surely
any Clergyman who can º to keep a Curate would take care to pay
his salary clear of all deductions. Oh yes, the more we think of it, the
more we feel persuaded that such is, because it must be, the inevitable
fact. In this case very possibly the Clergyman neglected to make
mention of the payment. Small wonder such a trifle should have
escaped his memory. What was one and threepence to a reverend

A not bad Yankee notion might be the publication of an American

so many additions from the *...*. ranch of the family, that
the compilation of such a lexicon has become very desirable. “Roor-
backs,” now!—What are “roorbacks?”, one would like to ask the
New York Herald, which, at least, should always come out with a
glossary. Comparative philologists, who derive the words of all lan-
guages from certain primitive roots, may have some difficulty in tracing
the affinity of the American verbal coinage to the Queen's English;
much more in attempting to make out the relation of Yankeeisms to
any of the other Indo-European languages; a course of investigation

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE “NATION " IN A FIT.
N the disaster at the Peiho, the
Nation newspaper makes the follow-
ing, among other remarks:–
“On the waters of the Peiho the British
banners have been covered with defeat,
slaughter, and disaster. Deep under its
waves lie the shattered skeletons of her
vanquished flagships; flying for safety to
Canton are the remnant of her routed
forces. . . . All draggled with blood,
all ghastly with wounds, all pale with
defeat—defeat, wounds, blood, all of their
own seeking and chall ng—are fleeing
the men who were the first to “run up
the signal for action,' and enter upon the
fight in which they have been so terribly
worsted 1"
Here the authoress of the fore-
- going efflux of hysterical spite, was
overcome by emotion, of which she strove in vain to vent herself. She
sprang from her seat and danced; she tore her dress, and scratched
her, own face in the self-inversion of her unglutted malice. Choked
with the passion which she could neither spit nor swallow, she then
fell into a fit, whence having been recovered by means of burnt
feathers and hartshorn, she proceeded, her stays having been in the
meanwhile cut, to insult the misfortune of bravemen with the following
overstrained and incoherent taunts:—
“Loud rise in England the gnashing of teeth and the oaths for revenge: 'ſoul
play, foul play,' is called from lip to lip, which means, “we have been beaten;' foul
play; we took gun-boats up the peaceful river to intimidate the Chinese cowards,
and sweep all before us; foul play, foul play, we, instead, have been swept away.
We thought we were the stronger party, and therefore ran up the signal for action;'
the action has gone against us; we {A. had to fly, having been shot down “like
birds;’ therefore, “foul play, foul play.” Never was defeat so self-sought, so utter,
so complete. The “action,' for which the English admiral, of his own choice, ran
up the signal,” and made the first movement, was literally a battue of the British
assailants. They fell, not in tens, but in scores and hundreds, under the skilful fire
of the long-despised Chinese . The Chinese did not prove helpless sheep
this time, that is all. Their shout of victºry will not be unheeded in the East. . .
The tº: redden in the sky; the days of Eastern conquests and plunder are over!
The tide has turned on the Peiho.”
Here the overwrought woman, uttered that piercing shriek, which,
as indicated in the “Revivals,” is the well known characteristic of her
complaint, and again fell, foaming and kicking, on her back, where she
lay for the space of an hour in violent convulsions, insomuch that it
took three men to hold her. - -
The sex of the writer of the foregoing extracts from the Nation is a
fact, the discovery of which needs no clairvoyance. Nobody can mistake
it who has ever had an opportunity of hearing the rancorous invective
the rampant mockery, the exorbitant imprecations of infinite. and
impotent hate, the rabid canine howlings uttered by, an inſuriated
female of the lowest class, in the gripe of the police, and restrained by
handcuffs from using her teeth .."nails.
But the best of the joke remains to be told. Whilst NorAH scolds
and mocks as above in the columns of the Nation, Jupy accompanies
her sister's abuse with an article suggesting that Her Majesty should
be graciously pleased to pardon MEAGHER, MMANUs, and—MITCHELL!
As if the Nation thought it was taking just the course calculated to
render it an effectual intercessor with the British Government on
behalf of Irish traitors—not to name both a traitor and a devilish and
dastardly miscreant; the vitriolic champion of slavery.

But Pimlico, Brighton, gave birth to the infantine Thomas DE SAYERs.
Qft on the shingle he wandered, his curls floating free on the breezes,
And the mermaidens smiled on the child as their pearly wrists played
with their tresses,
And they whispered, “One day to be great, to be named where the
ntles assemble
And glory of glºries, be hymned on the harpstrings of Punch the
Worldmaster.”
Then . the mermaids away, and the child began picking up
muscles,
Omen that soon his own muscles should win him a banner and blazon.
Not all at once waxed he great, like a bubble, or tyrant, or pumpkin,
Slowly he gathered and garnered the strength that is now so colossai.
Humbly (all good men are humble) he laboured in modest obscureness,
Toiling at work which, BEN Jonsos, the eminent poet, disdained not,

Sign that DE SAYERs should bray every foe as it were in a Mortar.

Many a station the latter hath crowded with eager admirers,
Fiercely demanding the cars to bear them to witness his glory.
When will such thing be affirmed of the sanctified THoMAs M.WILSON.
Still, not untried were the thews of the young and the promising hero.
Many a foe came across him, often he closed in the conflict,
Often his enemy fell, prone in the dust of the brickfield,

strings of Fleet Street, ...
And visions of glory came o'er him, and scarce he beheld his opponent,
Who, eager to follow his fortune, let out at the ribs of DE SAYERs.
Then struck the DE SAYERs in fury, but wily SIR ROBERT back darting,
Escaped from the Scylla, a wop, to meet a . a tumble,
And wrenched in a pitiful fashion his manly and sinister shoulder,
And there should have ended the fray, no longer an even contention;
But the º knight DE BRETTLE insisted on once again showing his
mettle.
So for the last time they closed, but the arm of SIR ROBERT was
eeble
And vainly descended its blows on the leathery frame of DE SAYERs,
Who, ...; his time, sent his right full bang on his enemy's
Squinter,
And made him look nine ways for Sunday and finally fail to perceive it.
Then, improving the shiny, as ever beseemeth a bee that is busy,
Went in with one smash at the shoulder—the battle is over and done.
At the feet of the child of the muscles is prostrate the child of the
oysters,
And sº is licked and chawed up, as she was by old England at
Oolden.
Porto Bello done up in six rounds, as it was with six ships by brave

And SIR THOMAS DE SAYERs, the Champion, is hailed as the victor

Yet, let no undue exultation be heard in the palace or cottage
In the halls of Balmoral the CoNsoBT will please to restrain his delight.
Let the Peerage of England be calm, and subdued be the joy of the
Ommons,
Nor need MR. TUPPER break out with a hymn of rejoicing and praise.
Though short was the fight, it was brisk, and both heroes are covered
with honour,
But not as Decisive this Battle were thought by the erudite CREAsy,
Had that learned Professor designed it a place in his next new edition;
And who but the Destinies know in what fashion the fight would have
ended,
Had the shoulder of BRETTLE the Brave been only as stout as his

EXCITEMENT OF THE HANSOM CABBLES ON THE APPEARANCE OF A SWELL OUT OF THE SEASON.
MISSES AND MERLINS.
7 HE sage who defined man to
be a tail-less biped, without
feathers, was introduced to
a plucked goose, and wished
§ of his relationship.
evertheless, that men and
women, have very , often
something of the birdlike
in their nature, is a truth
which every day we find
fresh reason to assert. For
instance, here is an adver-
tisement which will serve
uls as a ºf to hang up yet
another illustration of the
fact:—
0 FALCONERS, &c.—
A very strong young female
MERLIN, fond of the lure, and
trained to strike it well; will
Fº'ſ be partially entered to
arks before this is answered,
with all her furniture complete;
also another female, rather
smaller, not quite so far ad-
vanced.—Apply, &c.
They who have read the
Idylls of the King (and who
has not ?) may think of
“lissome WIVIEN,” when
they hear of a “young female’ being “fond of the lure,” and more-
over “partially entered to larks.” Nor will the word “Mºriº
serve at all in such case to lessen the illusion. , But we surely need
not go back quite so far as good KING ARTHUR's time to meet, with
a “young female” who answers this description. Why, every nine in
ten of our bread and butter misses have been thoroughly well fitted
to come forward as respondents to it. The simplest of them show a
fondness, for the “lure” at a very early age, and are trained to
“strike” a lover ere they get their bibs and tuckers off. Lover-
hawking is a sport for which “young females” in petticoats seem as
naturally, fitted, as the young females in feathers, one of whom above
is advertised, are in general found suited for the other kind of sport.
Just as our young Merlins are trained to strike the lure, so are our
.."; Misses schooled to bring down (to an offer) any lover they’re
et fly at. Their game generally consists of those of us poor creatures
who have feathered our nests well; and the better our nests are lin
the worse in general it is for us. At the very moment, may be, when
we are most in feather, and are pluming ourselves on the snug nest-egg we
have laid, down swoops some young and well-trained female Merlin on
our head, and we surrender up our life into the claws of the enchantress.
Whether, a young lady on her entrance to a boarding-school, may
with propriety be spoken of as being “entered to larks,” is a ques-
tion, which we leave to stronger minds to agitate. Flustered as we
are by mere suggestion of the query, we dare not trust ourselves to
dwell on it, or hazard a response. As the question is however one of
national importance, it would be well if information were collected on
the subject: and were Parliament now sitting, we should certainly pro-
pose that a Committee be appointed to examine and report on so
momentous a moot point. Should it be found that even “partially.”
such really is the fact, the discovery, of course, would strengthen our
belief, that human creatures have a something birdlike in their being
and that young Misses and young Merlins show a natural affinity and
marked likeness in their tastes. Were lovely woman classed amon
the feathery creation, her gift of gab might well entitle her to perc
with the poll-parrots, were not her fondness for the lure a sufficient
jºin that a place among the hawk-tribes is the right one to assign

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GREAT SEA-SIDE BUILDING squabble.
A LARGE and influential open-air Meeting of Operative Juyeniles
engaged in Seashore Building was held on Ramsgate Sands on Monday
morning last, with the view to their determining what attitude to take
in reference to an alleged combination of their nursemaids for the pur-
pose of shortening their hours of spade-labour. The Meeting, for the
most part was composed of Master Builders, but, a fair sprinkling of
Misses were also in attendance, who *: to take great interest in
the general proceedings. A splendid sand-heap being , raised and
scooped into a seat, a severe struggle ensued as to who should act as
Chairman. The post of honour was, however, at length assigned to
MASTER Bouncºn, who voted himself into it, he being much the
biggest of the Master Builders present. An order being issued to
strike work and shoulder spades– , -
The Chairman opened the proceedings by observing that they met
there to resist an act of tyranny, such as was an insult to all freeborn
British children, and which he for one would never stoop to brook.
(Applause.). He would not use slang º more than he could help;
but they might º have heard their. Pas talk, about, “pocketing
an insult.”. Well, he had º this insult in the pocket of his pinafore,
and with their permission he would proceed to read it out to them.
(Hear!) It was signed by all the nursemaids in Ramsgate, and ran
thus:–
“I declare that neither in my present place of nursemaid, nor in any future
situation I may occupy, will I demean myself by working more than Nine Hours
per diem, as overseer of the children while building on the sand: nor, without
advance of wages, will I ever undertake any manner o T. or in any way
assist them in the progress of their works; nor will I engage myself to stop the
Master Builders from dabbling in the sea, whether it be with or without their shoes
or stockings; nor more than twenty times an hour will I run in and prevent their
being carried off their legs, or tumbling themselves down and rolling in the water,
as but for constant watching they inevitably would do.”
This, they must allow, was a most obnoxious document. He could
not read the signatures, for most of them were marks; but he believed,
as he had said, that it was signed by all the nursemaids who were then
in Ramsgate, and delegates were stationed at the pier-head and the
railway to prevent any nursemaid from arriving without signing it.
The document had artfully been put forth on a Monday, just when his
hearers knew their Pas had gone away to town, and would not be back
until the Husbands' Boat on Saturday. Here then was a week of
gross oppression to look forward to. (Groans.) What was to be done
was more than he could say, and he therefore begged to be excused
from saying it. (Cheers, and a giggle, which was instantly suppressed.)
He would however call on some one to get up and suggest something,
and if that something were worth anything, he would use his strongest
influence towards carrying it out. (Reneiced cheering.)
Several º: here rose in a most excited state, but the Chair-
man's eye first catching that which buttoned in MASTER BLoggins,
that young gentleman obtained the precedence of speech. Striking a
tragić attitude, and assuming as sepulchral a voice as age allowed him,
he said:—
“My name is Bloggins,
upon Highgate Hill
My father feeds ºp ghga
Here the orator was interrupted by a spadeful of sand, which was
thrown so accurately that it, almost choked him. Advantage being
taken of his temporary speechlessness, MASTER JAwLER gained per-
mission to speak by way of proxy. He said that what their Chairman
had told them was quite true. They were in fact the victims of as
wicked a conspiracy as had ever come in his experience to witness.
(Sensation.). In the whole course of his life (and he begged to say he
should be Six next. April) he had never, had acquaintance with so
tyrannous an act. The combination of their nursemaids was a piece of
foul oppression, which they, as rising Englishmen, were bounden to
resist. (Cheers.) The declaration was an insult to the youngest un-
derstanding... It was like setting a sum in addition or subtraction,
[in his warmth the orator pronounced this word “substraction”] to a boy
who’d got as forward as the double rule of three How to show their
marked contempt for it was what they now had to consider, and he for
one, should not feel easy in his yº until their brutal tyrants were
º: º Mt. the dust. (Shrill cheers, and shouts of “Bravo! Go it,
ssy /*
MASTER BRIGHTEYEs said he had no wish to make a row, but in his
opinion the last speaker was a duffer. (Cries of “Order /* and “Oh
crikey!"). Why, what did his speech amount to? A mere volley of hard
words. , Now he (MASTER BRIGHTEYEs) could use hard words as well
as any boy. He could pronounce “Kosciusko,” and say the whole of
“Peter Piper six times without missing. But it was no good calling
names, when there was nobody to listen to them. (Hear!) If they
wished to free themselves an flabbergasterfy their nursemaids (yes,
that was a hard word; he’d found it in a sentimental nigger son
which he was learning), it was by deeds not words that they coul
hope to do it. , They must all rise as one man (“hear, hear?” }. sia:
pinafores), and go to their Big Brothers, and get them at once to kick
the nursemaids out of doors, and then to telegraph to town for their
Pas to send them new ones.
MASTER SLYBoots feared his friend would find his dodge would be
no go. From the knowledge which he (MASTER SLYBoots) had of their
Big Brothers, he should say they were more º to kiss nursemaids
than to kick them. (Cries of “oh / oh /” from the Masters, and “oh,
my /?” from the Misses.)
| , MASTER SLINKER could corroborate (the word he used was “crobrate”)
the last speaker's assertion. He and his chum SLYBOOTS, having both
inquiring minds, had kept a watch on their Big Brothers, and had often
º; the º seen them do what was imputed to them. (Loud
isses and groans, and cries { “you’re a sneak /*
|, MASTER SMITH suggested, if the Big Brother plan failed, they had
better see if their big Sisters could not help them. Girls had nothin
on earth to do, except to loll about on camp-stools, work crochet, an
read novels; and it would be an act of charity to give them occupation.
|They might just as well, he thought, employ their time as nursemaids,
|a. go bathing for the sake of letting their back hair down, or walkin
up and down the pier to make their cheeks red. ſº oh/). If they’
do this, their Pas would save no end of wages, which might be spent at
| Christmas time in º: and—and—(a voice “And pudding /*)
| Yes, and pudding; he begged to thank his honourable friend there for
the hint. He was ſº to add “and lollipops,” but º Was
more substantial and he liked it better. (Hear, hear / and a cry, “Oh,
so do I; don't you, BoB ") -
MASTER JONEs observed that this was a departure from the question,
which was not whether they liked lollipops—of which there was no
doubt—but whether they could lick their nursemaids, which he thought
seemed far more questionable. What their maids had to complain of
he really could not see. For his own part he was ready to work twelve
hours on the sand, and he could not conceive how persons could get
tired in only mine of it. -
A very little lady in a white frock and mauve mantle, protested with
a pout that she could do without a nursemaid; and as for helping them
at “thand-heapth,” she thought that their big “thithterth” would be
only in the way. Some children were of course not so able to protect
themselves: but for her part, she considered that when a girl was
three years old, she was most fully ºpelent (the fair speaker called
this “tompetent”) to take care of herself.
The Chairman said that this was the best speech he had listened to.
If girls didn't want a nursemaid, surely boys co o without one.
He should therefore ask his Ma to give his her discharge; and to
settle the whole business, he should move this Resolution:-
“That this Meeting, feeling competent to take care of itself, resolves henceforth
to dispense with the attendance of its nursemaids, and further to take steps to
º upon its Parents that it determines to be naughty till its wishes are made
good.
This heroic resolution was seconded and carried amidst such a burst
of cheering, that several anxious mothers came to see what was the
matter; º with some precipitation the Meeting was dispersed.

BAD LANGUAGE BY A LADY 1
#2 ometimes we feel inclined to
-- #. the question, What do
oreigners who have "learnt
English, and who chance to
read our newspapers, think of
the bad language which may
constantly be found there?
When we say bad language, we
however don’t mean “Bilings-
gate.” The language we allude
tois badmerely in construction;
and its vileness consists in its
vile grammar, not vile words.
We rarely run our eye down a
column of advertisements with-
out catching sight of half a
hundred failings of this sort.
Here, for instance, is a sample
º the Times of the 10th
ult.:—
OUSEMAID WANTED–a
steady, healthy person, between
20 and 30, of the Church of England.
She will be required to assist an in-
valid lady and her daughter to do
part of the housework and needle-
ºs- work. Kindness shown to a deserving
º/Nº- person. No followers, but all reason-
able leave to go out. Two other ser-
vants and a nurse kept. Wages Æ12,
with allowance for tea. The washing
put out. Beer allowed. It is re-
---
-
=== ~
quested none will apply who cannot
i.tº." gººd characters, and who cannot be recommended for cleanliness and good temper. Apply by
etter, &c. &c.
Kindness—good wages—easy work—and beer allowed. Were it not for one thing, this
would seem a tolerably enviable place. The º drawback is that the mistress can’t write
English, and this is a defect which we should fancy housemaids now-a-days would sooner
erish than put up with. The second sentence of the statement is the proof of our assertion.
}: is there said that the “healthy person” who is wanted is required “to assist an invalid
lady and her daughter to do part of the housework and needlework.” Now, any “person”
who is “healthy” in mind as well as body must see that no such thing is meant here as
is stated. It is sheer nonsense to suppose that an invalid lady would “do part of the
housework,” to say nothing of the needlework, when she had in her employment two
servants and a nurse, and could offer such good wages for a third to come and help them.
What we take to be the real meaning of the sentence is, that a housemaid is required to assist
—that is, to wait upon—the invalid and her said daughter, and to do part of the housework
and needlework aforesaid, whereof the "other servants” and the nurse will do the rest.
If this invalid lady really wants a fourth assistant, she had better lose no time in amending
her advertisement. Servants now-a-days are such literary, characters, and so much of their
time is spent in study of their language by reading the best written and most improving
prints, that the error we have noted could not fail, to be detected, and would prove a sure
deterrent from entering the house. With the knowledge of pure English which her Family
Friends and Guides, and other journals would have given her, no housemaid would demean
º by entering a service where the ladies used bad language, although they gave good
er.

A PARALLEL,
ENGLAND hath her two Great Easterns,
Crowning boasts of English lips:
This, Leviathan of Conquests,
That, Leviathan of Ships.
Strong the heads and hearts whose striving
Our Great Eastern Empire wrought:
Strenuous those, to consummation,
Our Great Eastern Ship that brought.
Both *. through their stage of blunders;
Failure marked their earlier day;
Both o'er failure grew to wonders—
Monster ship and monster sway.
Till the rulers of that Empire,
And the framers of that Hull,
Stretched their hands in self-complacence,
Laurels of success to cull.
In DALHousie's boastful minute,
Summing up the work achieved,
Realms annexed, and foemen baffled,
Arts diffused and means retrieved;
In Reports of blithe Directors,
Loomed that Empire's mighty sceptre
O'er two hundred million souls:
Rose that steamer's bulk gigantic,
Like the whale 'mong minnow-shoals.
Princes, 'neath the one's vast shadow,
Dwindled into vassal's rank:
War-ships 'neath the other's quarter,
Down to tiny cock-boats sank.
Proudly spake we to the nations,
“Would you learn the art to rule,
See our mighty Eastern Empire,
To its masters go to school.
Would you win mechanic triumphs,
Nature's forces yoke and tame,
Visit our Great Eastern Steamer,
Mark her engines, lines, and frame.”
How should we have heard the prophet,
Whose ill-omened voice had dared
For reverse in Ship and Empire,
Bid our pride to stand prepared:
'Gainst vain-glory tried to warn us,
Rosy after-dinner talk— Lest, between the cup and lip,
sº success and Empire's fortunes . A ſ: cartridge lose our Empire,
There was care or cloud to baulk # closed stop-cock wreck our Ship?
Yet that prophet truth had spoken,
Hard as on our pride he bore:
Great effects from little causes,
Flow still, as they flowed of yore.
Scarce had died our song of triumph,
From the Durbar and the Deck,--
Our Great Realm for life was grappling
Our Great Ship was dashed in wreck!
And 'twas even a greased cartridge
Raised her subjects 'gainst the one;
And 'twas but a fastened stop-cock
Left the other half undone.
But that stop-cock and that cartridge,
Had its weighty tale to tell—
How the thing that men deem smallest,
Tests man's ruling ill or well.
Too great striving after glory,
Too great striving after gain—
Ship and Sway, the self-same story,
Tell to men for both too fain.
Good and Right are Glory's sinews;
Gain of Care and Prudence grows;
Reft of these, the one is rotten,
Short the other, stripped of those.
Let us meekly use the lesson,
In the two disasters read:
Let their warning check and chasten,
Working hand and heart and head.
Till our Empire justice-strengthened,
And our Steamer wisdom-ruled,
Show that wise men by misfortune
And endurance best are schooled.
Take we, too, this consolation; . . .
Strength by shock is deepliest tried—
Stout the Sway, to stand such º
Stout the Ship, such wrench to bide.
So may after generations,
Wiser for our follies, see,
Our Great º bless the nations,
Our Great Ship defy the sea.
A PECULIAR MEMORY.
IN proof of the scarcity of birds on the
Caithness Moors, “one gentleman” writes to a
northern newspaper that “he has seen more
cheepers this year than he can remember.” To
what system of metaphysics shall we turn for
an explanation of a º so extraordi-
nary? How does he know that he has seen
more than he can remember? If he does not
remember that he has seen them, how comes he
to know that there were more than he has seen?
This gentleman cannot be a descendant of that
scald who wrote “Tho' lost to sight, to memory
dear.” We deeply sympathise wit the forgotten
cheepers.
Dash without Damage.
WE cannot too strongly condemn ADMIRAL
Hope, baffled, and wounded at the Peiho in an

officer must be called to account for his unsuc-
cessful audacity. England expects a man to do
more than his duty, but cannot forgive him for
failing in the attempt to do it. We will enforce
responsibility whilst we compel risk; we will

imposing synonym, as
we shall show, is §.

that fools are not extinct
by publishing his Alman-
ack for the ensuing year
this being, he is proud
to state, his thirtieth
early issue. Not having
}. the mandate, “not
to speak profanely,” MR.
ZADKIEL º: Sze begins
his preface thus:-
“I may now say, faith-
fully, that I thank God I
have been permitted to pen
the contents of this Alma-
nack for so long a period as
Thirty YEARs. After having
been so long a time before
the public, I may fairly accept the increase of nearly two thousand in the sale
last year as a proof that I have not laboured in vain. I continue to receive
assurances that in America and India my writings in favour of the grand truth,
that the heavenly bodies do influence the human mind, and affect the destiny of
Inankind, are favourably and extensively perused : hence I was not surprised to
hear that, when the Royal Welsh Fusileers marched into Lucknow, and liberated
the brave garrison, one of the first objects of interest discovered in a bungalow
thore was a copy of ZADxIEL's Grammar of Astrology."
For the credit of the army, we could wish this were discredited;
and as the statement rests on merely hearsay...evidence, we put such
faith in MR. ZADKIEL that we shall not believe it true. But, not
dreaming for a moment his assertion can be doubted, MR. ZADKIEL
founds this question on the questionable fact:-
“Who can say how far the confidence of that noble band of Englishmen had been
upheld by the assurance that the owner of that book (doubtless an astrologer) may
have held out that the heavens promised them eventual delivery? The idea that
this was so is a reward for all my labours, and bids the remembrance of the abuse
and vituperation I have undergone, for defending the cause of astral truth, disappear
from the mind as the flakes of falling snow melt away when they impinge on the
ruffled waters of the ocean.”
. There is a poetry about this which smacks of the Mosaic, and
inclines us to consider whether ZADKIEI, be the genius whose immortal
verse is chucked into cab-windows at the railways, and by persons of
good sense is instantly chucked out again. -
The allusion to our soldiers having inspired a warlike tone, MR.
ZADKIEL blows this blast of defiance to all sceptics:—
“Where, I may now demand, where, after thirty years of uninterrupted advocacy
of the truth of the doctrines of astral influences, are the marks of the hostility of
the enemies of those truths? Who is the man who has ventured “to print a book.'

Repeatedly have I challenged the Savans, the philosophers of our day, clothed as
they are in the panoplv of pride, making broad as they do, the phylacteries of their
mathematical gannents, affecting to treat with contempt the oldest science that
exists; repeatedly have I challenged them to answer my propositions, to prove to
the world one single instanoe in which Nature has turned her back upon herself,
by producing a child not evidently born under the laws, not governed by the
Potencies of the stars. Have they accepted the challenge? Again, I ask, Have they f
And Echo answers, Nay!”
If echo answered “Bray/* the reply would be more sensible. The
man who would accept so asinine a challenge might fitly take the cry
of a donkey for his war-note. But having said what echo didn't,
MR. ZADKIEL goes on blowing his own trumpet thus:—
“No distinct work to disprove astrology is to be met with in our day. Its
adversaries take shelter in the anonymous columns of such onesided vehicles as the
Athenaeum, or those still more lob-sided public instructors, the country newspapers.
The editor of the former has gone through some thirty years of life, disputing
against, abusing, vilifying, and ridiculing astrology: but he has never ventured to
deny its facts, never dared to attempt its º; appeal to any one well-known
nativity, public or private. He is now leaving that work, having fallen like myself
into the sere and yellow leaf of age. We hasten pas à pas with equal footsteps to
the grave; and in the world of spirits we shall both shortly meet, to know for aye
which of us has done most service to the cause of truth.”
After this terrific onslaught, we really tremble to inquire, Are the
Athenæum's shutters up?... Our contemporary seemed healthy, and
showed fair signs of vitality; but it can scarcely have survived so
deadly an attack. Thus, having doubled up, the papers, as a child
might its perambulator, MR. ZADKIEI, claps his eye to an imaginary
telescope, and makes believe to read the future in the stars. We
string together, some half-dozen of his choicest pearls of prophecy,
adding here and there a word or two of comment on their worth?—
“Voice of THE STARs—FEBRUARY.-Lord PALMERsroN has Jupiter opposing
his Moon, which brings him into ill-odour with the mercantile world and the clergy.”
|Too bad this of Jupiter, but we'll bet “Cupid" will get out of it.)

These extracts having shown the wisdom of the work, it may be
asked, who are the fools who, in “increasing thousands,” purchase it.
Under the head “To Correspondents,” MR. ZADKIEL kindly throws
some starlight on this point; and in doing, so he helps us to a bit of
information which we think is not less worthy of our note:–
“fºr NATIvities AND HoRARY QUESTIoxs.-On all subjects in connection with
these matters, or for advice when the mind is really anxious on any subject; or for
information as to the best period to offer corn, cattle, and other commodities
for sale, &c, apply by letter only to SAMUEL SMITH, Esq."—[of Humbug House,
Takeinemwell.]
MR. ZADKIEL's revelation that his alias is “SMITH" seems, of all
his revelations, to us the most º and the only one on which
we pin the slightest scrap of faith. A proof that knaves are often
fools is, however, to be found in his thus letting out the cat. It is
clear the name of “ZADKIEL” sounds more imposingly than “SMITH;”
and imposition being the main object of his business, the more im-
posing title must of course be best for trade. Were the Almanack next
year entitled “SMITH's" instead of “ZADRIEL's,” we opine its circula-
tion would sensibly decrease. “ZADKIEL” sounds mysterious, and with
a certain class of people mystery attracts. We will wager the dull dolts
for whom the work is manufactured, would not find their long ears
tickled half so well by “SMITH.” The mind bucolic is perhaps the
most gullible of intellects, as is proved by how the charlatans called
“farmers' friends” have tricked it; and it is, therefore, small surprise
to us that MR. ZADKIEL should lay siege to the bucolic mind, and,
what to him is more worth seiging, the bucolic breeches' pocket. MR.
Z. professes to inform his friends the farmers, as to when they best
may sell their corn and cattle; but he omits an observation the
might, quite as much rely on, that if they follow his advice they will
§ themselves most º included in the sale. The “other”
saleable “commodities” on which he proffers his advice, we take it,
are cooks’ “perquisites” and stolen pocket-handkerchiefs, and all such
articles, which sometimes it requires some tact to sell. Our chief
cause for this conjecture is the estimate we form of MR. ZADRIEL's
morality, from the signs of it he sprinkles through some Fº his
work. The most noteworthy of these are pages 80 and 81, which are
headed—
“LUNAR INFLUENCEs for 1860, to be considered when about to commence any
very important matter.”
Here, what superstitious idiots have learnt to call their “lucky days.”
are noted, month by month. We subjoin a brace of specimens, which
may be accepted as fair samples of the bulk:—
FEBRUARY. l November.
Day. Day.
2. Ask favours. 1. Deal with public bodies.
8. Deal with old persons. 2. Trade, ask favours.
4. Trade, marry. 3, 8, 17, 22, 23. Ditto.
10. Travel, ask favours. 4. Marry.
16. Ask favours, marry. 5, 9, 14, 18, 19, 29, 30. Ditto.
20. Ileal with old men. 11, 15, 25. Deal with surgeons.
24. Marry, go to surgeons. 10, 16, 26. Deal with old men.
Those who think that marriage is a lunatic proceeding have, on
ZADKIEL's authority, a “lunar influence” to show for it. According
to his table, about a dozen days per month are lucky ones for marrying,
though the sequel, “go to surgeons,” may seem somewhat of an anti-
dote. Quite as frequently recurring are the days for “asking favours.”
and “dealing with old men; ” which transactions are, we take it,
“very important matters” in the kitchens where the Almanack of
ZApkIEL is studied. If we read the former, “Ask for left-off clothes
and perquisites,” and by the latter understand “ijeal with oldragmen,”
We 8 j put probably the right construction on the words. We there-
fore charge this MR. ZADKIELTAo SzE, alias SMITH, with encouraging
our servants to prig our clothes and kitchen-stuff, and would suggest
that he should head his page of Lunar Influences with the much more
fitting title of A Calendar for Scanps. When, by following his advice,
our servants find themselves in * they will have their lucky
stars and MR. ZADKIEL SMITH to thank.

SIRENS AT THE SEA-SIDE.
Miss MARTINEAU proposes that ladies should be taught to swim.
All the young ones ought to be able to swim naturally, like ducks, as
they are; and as for the others, if not ducks, what are they, for at any
rate they are no chickens? The proposition of Miss MARTINEAU sug-
gests certain additions which, when it is adopted, should be made to
The Girl's Own Book. Besides proper directions for swimming
floating, diving, treading water, &c., instructions should be supplie
for performing various feats of elegance, dexterity, and skill. Aquatic
waltzes, polkas, and quadrilles are evolutions which the fair swimmers
might be taught to#. to their own great delight and recreation,
as well as to the diversion of all beholders. Elegant bathing-dresses,
suitable to an aquatic ball, would render such a performance at any
fashionable watering-place abundantly profitable. The dresses, of
course, would be of a very light, material, unless, by means of gutta-
percha tubing, crinoline of ordinary extent † be conveniently
floated. Young ladies might also learn to embroider in the water, hem
handkerchiefs, do crochet, or execute drawings in water-colours. A
piano, supported by a little buoy, would afford peculiar means for
musical aquatic exercises; and the performer, accompanying herself in
a song, would appear like a regular mermaid, with her tail out of sight.
If young ladies generally could swim, and took to swimming, the waves
that wash the beach of Albion would swarm every autumn with sea-
nymphs, and the British shores, would be assuredly crowded with
worshippers of those marine divinities.
“Oh, that Sort of Person!”
TheRE has been a i. deal of º excited among vulgar
º: in England, by the account of the stealing and restoration of a
ahy in Paris. This interest was at first shared your better classes,
it being stated that the abstracted infant had been “exquisitely
dressed,” but this was destroyed when it came out that the baby had
been for some time “nursed” by its own mother.
PROBABLE RAILWAY CATASTROPHE,

to make the simple insurance against accidents of this class, which
may be effected by an adequate provision of guard and break power.”
If the board of directors . this once secure, but now perilous railway,
will only go to the expense of * it in a proper condition, they
will avert an alarming sacrifice of human life, which more than one of
our contemporaries may correctly describe as a holocaust of human
victims, since the train may take fire, and burn the Bishop of WIN-
chESTER, and PUNCH. If CAPTAIN Ross is right, the South-Western
Railway, whose officials used to boast that it was “slow and safe,” is
. in consequence of having ceased to be safe, not half what it used

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HEAD OF ENGLISH COMPOSERS.
Few days ago we
were startled by read-
ing in the Musical
World, or somewhere,
the following painful
announcedient :-
“W. M. BALFE.
Two Locks or
HAIR. 2s.”
We are sorry to
hear that the com-
poserof the Bohemian
Girl, who has fur-
nished the public with
J so many beautiful
airs, should be re-
duced to such a ver
low state himself.
Has it, then, come to
this, that the head
of our musical pro-
fession has but “Two
Locks of Hair” that
he can call his own?
or are we to under-
stand that he is cut-
ting off all his curls,
and selling them to
his numerous admi-
rers at the modest
rate of a shilling a
lock. The price is
very slight — too
slight; whereas the
consumptioninbears'
grease and macassar,
to replace the loss,
measured by the enormous demand, must be unusually large. We shall only be too happy to
have a lock ourselves, in order to help him through the hirsute struggle, if so small a
quantity as a shilling's worth is made. We say only one lock, as it would be awkward to
wear two lockets. We only hope that our friend's hair has the same º power as his
musical genius, for we should be sorry to see one so distinguished as W. BALFE
appearing before the public in the character of a bald composer, though the baldness
would be but little apparent in his case, from the number of laurels with which his musical
}.ºutly decorated. Does he think it would do him any good to consult the Barber
o zlºe.
THE GOVERNMENT BROKER.
WHAT would the Government do without its Broker? There never is a difficulty in the
Money Market but he ſº comes forward, and spends his £15,000 or £20,000 with no
more concern than a school-boy would drop his halfpenny at the nearest apple-stall. This he
does, not merely one day, or a couple of days, but he will go on buying for weeks and weeks
together. He is the financial physician to the State, and no sooner does Government feela
little tightness in its chest, than the Government Broker is ready to relieve it by immediately
applying for an investment, the happy application of which to the part affected enables the
É. to exclaim, with as much saltato flº as the dressing-gowned invalid in GeoRGE
RUIKSHANK’s pictorial advertisement, “Ha! Ha! Cured in an instant!” He is the best
friend the Old Lady in Threadneedle Street ever had, and, supposing that elderly female ever
took it into her head to marry, we should not at all wonder at the Government Broker being
the object of her affections. His wealth must be something enormous, considering the
amount he spends in the course of the twelvemonth; and his frugality must be almost as
great as his wealth, for we notice that he never buys for any other purpose than that of
Hºf into the Sayings' Banks. He must make money very fast, or else has an enormous
“ready-cash” business, that brings him in thousands every week throughout the whole year,
inasmuch as it is a stereotyped fact that the Government Broker limits his operations generally
to buying, for you rarely catch him selling. This is a proof of the sure principle upon which
he always conducts his business, and the consequence is, that the interest which accrues is
invariably not less sure than the principal.
The wonder that takes away our breath is, how a man who commands so much wealth, and
scatters so much good wherever he scatters his gold, should have remained so long unknown?
Is it not curious that the British Association, which amuses itself in solving some of the
most, abstruse mysteries of science, as connected especially with commerce, should not have
raised some inquiry as to the name of this large public benefactor? A little investigation
into his character would have well repaid º: curiosity. Seemingly, he is one of those
pure-minded philanthrºpists, who do good by stealth, and would blush to find it fame. He
must be a large-hearted, open-handed individual, whom we confess we should like extremely
to know. It is not often you meet with a man who is so rich, and at the same time, so
liberal. But few capitalists in the City are so colossal in their dealings, and yet so modest;
we cannot recall to mind another millionnaire, who does so much good in his golden way, an
WOL, XXXVII. Q
nevertheless does it so quietly, as our friend,
if he will only allow us so to call him,) the
vernment Broker.
May he always be buying
another £15,000!
FRANKLIN.
THE Polar clouds uplift—
A moment and no more—
And through the snowy drift,
We see them on the shore—
A band of gallant hearts,
ell-ordered, calm, and brave;
Braced for their closing parts—
Their long march to the grave.
Through the snow's dazzling blink,
Into the dark they’ve gone.
Nº pause: the weaker sink,
The strong can but strive on.
Till all the dreary way
Is dotted with their dead:
And the shy foxes play
About each sleeping head.
Unharmed the wild deer run,
To graze along the strand:
Nor dread the loaded gun
Beside each sleeping hand.
The remnant that survive
Onward like drunkards reel;
Scarce wotting if alive,
But for the pangs they feel.
The river of their hope
At length is drawing nigh—
Their snow-blind way they grope,
And reach its banks to die!
Thank God: brave FRANKLIN’s place
Was empty in that band.
He closed his well-run race
Not on the iron strand.
Not under snow-clouds white,
By cutting frost-wind driven,
Did his true spirit fight
Its shuddering way to Heaven.
But warm, aboard his ship,
With comfort at his º:
And hope upon his lip,
The gallant FRANKLIN died.
His heart ne'er ached to see
His much-loved sailors ta'en;
His sailors' pangs were free
From their loved captain's pain.
But though in death apart,
They are together now;
alm, each enduring heart—
Bright, each devoted brow!
The Game of Piedmont.
We observe that a new pastime is adver.
tised under this name.
According to our idea,
the game of Piedmont must resemble that of the
umpire who was chosen by two
entlemen play-
ing all-fours, who had considerable doubts with
regard to each other's honesty.
He was to
receive so much a game for seeing fair play, and
at the close of the evening proved to be the
only winner.

CHARIVARI. [October 8, 1859.
PEOPLE I DON'T WANT TO MEET.
A Paper printed purely for Private Circulation.
BY ONE WHO DON'T MIND BEING CALLED A CRUSTY OLD CURMUDGEON.
OMEBODY or other—I don't
a bit know who, and 1
don't one atom want to
know—has, I believe
written a book entitled
never read the work, and
I don’t intend to read it.
I seldom care to read a
book further than the
title-page. When, one
knows what it's, about,
one can imagine the con-
: tents, and supposing that
one can't it’s seldom any
loss to one. Nine authors
out of ten write nothing
that’s worth reading.
What they, write, one
could write better, if one
cared to try, oneself. As
- for reading such a boo
- as People I have Met, I
should never in my senses
dream of dipping into it.
What .."; to hear of
Fºl. whom some one else has met? Bah! I'm enough bored by people whom
meet myself. To think of people I can't help meeting is plague enough for me.
Why worry myself with thoughts about another man's acquaintances?
No. If the work had been entitled People I don't want to Meet, the name of it
perhaps might have tempted me to purchase it. There's some pleasure in learning
that other men have bores to plague them like oneself. Moreover, when one reads
of disagreeable people one can't help, being constantly reminded of one's friends,
and can take a quiet pleasure in reflecting on their faults, and in noting in the
margin “Ah, that’s just like that sneak, SNooks!” or else adding the curt
comment, “Bravo! ToMKINs to the life . How I hope he’ll see it!”
I feel sure a work of this kind would command a splendid sale, and win no end
of compliments and kú80s for the writer. However, these incentives will not tempt
me to produce it. Not being by trade an author, ſhave a balance at my banker's;
and as for popularity, I'd rather be without it. , Still there's no harm, in my
ºf how my notion might be worked, and what agreeable reading it would
certainly produce. You may say it is not proper to parade one's friends in print,
nor manly to make fun of even fools behind their tº: Bah! I turn a deaf ear
always to such sentimental snivelling. What's the good of having friends, if one
can't use them. It seems to me, their follies are fair literary capital, and authors
would be asses if they did not trade on it. Besides, by trying to offend a man, one
merely tests his friendship, and he should take it as a compliment that one
considers it worth testing.
For my part, as I said, not wanting fame, or money, I don't intend to bore
myself with bringing out a book. Still if you’d like to know a few of the People
I don't want to Meet, I'll just jot down a line or two, by way of introduction. I
don't so much mind work, when I can worry other people by it; and if my sketches
of my friends bore you half, as much as their acquaintanceship does me, I shall
hold myself repaid for the labour of describing them.
So then, Place aur dames! No, no. That be hanged. Man came before woman,
and I can't see any cause why he should yield his precedence. Place aur hommes/
say I. I’ll begin with my friend SMITH.
Now SMITH is one of those (to me), objectionable creatures, whom all their
friends (but me) persist in nicknaming “Good fellows.” SMITH has good health,
and good spirits, good temper and good nature, and, what in ladies' eyes is better
still, good ſooks. Every one likes SMITH, and that is one great reason why I myself
detest him... “Good fellows” in Fºl are my particular aversion. Because of
their good fellowship º get the best of everything, and, although they least
deserve it, their friends always, make the most of them...If I meet SMITH out at
dinner, I observe that he invariably gets helped sooner than I do, and almost as
invariably has the pick of the tithits. He gets the lion's share of whatever's best
on table, and although (in my opinion), he’s an ass in conversation, he somehow
or other always plays the lion's part. My most telling jokes fall flat when SMITH
is sitting next me; and, however, weak and stupid, his are always roared at... In
fact, I never enjoy my dinner when SMITH is of the party. The mere sight of
a “good fellow” always takes away, my appetite. It . gives me indigestion
to see the quantity of “nice bits” which the carvers will put by for him, while I
and other guests may whistle for a taste. In the drawing-room, moreover, SMITH
is equally a nuisance. It almost makes, me sick to see the women pet and cosset
him. Pretty widows cluster round him like flies about a sugar-shop; and girls flirt
with him as pleasantly as if he were a parson, and repose in him their confidence as
though he were a priest. They allow him to take i. which I would give my
ears for, but I should only get them boxed were I to volunteer the gift. In this
way, as in others, I find that these “good fellows” somehow always get the better
People I have Met. I p
k| most men a
of me, and rob me of whatever I, most take to be º
due. Wherever I meet SMITH he is a nuisance an
annoyance to me, and that is surely a fair reason for my
saying, I Don't Want to Meet him.
Then in, there’s BRowN. I can't bear meeting
BRowN, although I own he’s just exactly the antipodes
of SMITH. Brown has had health and bad, spirits, bad
temper and bad looks. Who can possibly find pleasure in
meeting men like Brown? His voice is so lugubrious it
reminds one of a meeting-house, and the long faces he
ulls would do for a broad farce. BRown is always sicken-
ing one by talking of his ailments, and, mentioning the
medicines which he has been prescribed for them. As
some fools take delight in telling you what quantities of
wine they have been drinking, so Bāown appears to relish
an unhealthy sort of pleasure in counting up the quantities
of physic he has swallowed, and º; he has floored a
six-ounce bottle at a sitting, or made “dead men” of half
a score or so of draughts per day for weeks. Ugh!, To
hear Brown's conversation is like walking through a hos:
ital; and when I add that he’s an ugly and ill-tempered
ooking brute, and that it gives, one the blue devils to
glance at his blue looks why, who the d–ce can wonder
that i ijon't Want to Meet him?
MRs. Jones, although a lady, is (to me) a hardly less
objectionable person. MRs. Joses is, what is called by
“nice creature.” Her male friends, as a rule,
are over head and ears in love with her, but I can't con:
ceive their reasons for those amatory somersaults. I hear
them say they think her pretty and piquant; but, as lan:
guage was invented to conceal one's thoughts, of course I
can’t conjecture what they really think of her. It sounds
well enough to speak of her as “pretty” and “piquant,”
but “common-place” and “pert” would be more truthful
epithets. One can't call women “pretty,” who have little
turned-up, noses, such as, MRs. JóNEs has; and the way
in which she pities me for being an old bachelor, and laughs
at my “odd ways,” as she is pleased to call them, fools
who stand by may think “piquant,” but I myself call
“pert.” I never meet MRs. }. but she seems bent
onB. fun at me, and surely that is cause enough why
I Don't Want to Meet her.
I need not waste my time in a description of Miss
ScraunchER, for, I take it, no one Wants to Meet these
more-than-half-male misses; who, if they married, would
stick out for Woman's Right to wear the thingummies,
and whose minds seem to grow stronger as their hair gets
weak. Nor need I spare much, space for Miss SERENA
SIMPER; who has no idea of Righting anything—but love-
letters—and whose brains are just as weakly as Miss
ScRAUNCHER's are robust. There may be childish idiots
who like such dolls to prattle to, but I am not an idiot,
and I Don't Want to Meet them. Neither do I Want to
Meet that MRs. RABBitT WARRENNE, who is, so to
speak, quite wrapped up in her babies, and seems, as far as
I can judge, to have a new one once-a-week. To hear that
woman chatter about whooping-coughs and measles, is, as
the Yankees say, a “caution” which young bachelors
might profit by. I never have but once “enjoyed” the
“pleasure” of her company, and then she told me the
addresses of sixteen monthly nurses, and gave me the
recipes for twelve varieties of pap!
As for º young friends, Whypper SNAPP and NYNNY
HAMMER, their names speak quite enough for them, and
I need say no more. Blockheads, young or old, I don’t
much Want to Meet. Ciphers such as these cut a r
figure in the world, and the society of ciphers is not a thing
I sigh for. Nor have I any wish to meet a man like
SkunkE. SKUNKE is not a {iº He is sharp and
shrewd enough...But somehow, SKUNKE is never in good
odour with his friends. He is always stirring up the cess-
pools of small scandals, which nobody but he would ever
care to poke his nose into, and which, but for his said
stirring, would soon cease to be smelt out. BLABBERLY
again is a fellow I Don't Want to Meet. When BLAB-
BERLY is present, one can never half enjoy oneself. If one
feels inclined to cut up any absent friends, or to make a
nice ill-natured joke at their expense, BLABBERLY's quick
ears are sure to catch up what is said, and his tongue has
an unlucky habit of repeating it. Then, too, there's my
friend SLYNKE.—But why pursue a subject which º:
more and more unsavoury. # have surely said enough to
show that I’m surrounded by People I Don't Want to

worse than taxgatherers. What though I may mix in what

On the planning of sewers, and cleansing of courts.
Ah, me! when I think of the dinners I’ve seen,
The venison so fat, and the turtle so green, .
The rich marrow-puddings, so melting and mild,-
Grey-haired man as I am, I could weep like a child.
Audacious Reform lifts its voice for our fall:
They publish our archives, our records o'erhaul;
Pry into our revenues, scan our accounts,
Our sal'ries examine, and gauge their amounts.
Yield not thus, brother Aldermen, tacit and tame.
As the Senate of Rome met the Gaul, when he came,
To meet the Reformers, in Guildhall sit down,
Majestic and awful, in chain and in gown.
When the foe in that terrible presence shall come,
He will shrink from his enterprise—dazzled and dumb;
Will dread to encounter the Alderman's ban,
And feel the LoRD MAYoR something higher than man!
If, false and faint-hearted, no Alderman stirs:
if a craven Lord Mayor to º roject demurs.
At ãº feet, Gog and Magog, #. off my #.
And my Alderman life—like a BRUTUs—lay down!
NE PLUS ULTRA-MONTANIST.
MR. PUNCH's recommendation to make short work with the Krish
priests who refuse to use in aid of the law their absolute power over
their flocks, has caused a vast explosion of wrath in the journals
devoted to the ultra-montane hierarchy. Of abuse, especially from the
tools of the priesthood, Mr. Punch has had so much in his time, while
working out reforms in Church and State, and generally revising and
improving the Constitution, that he can bear it very equably. But
really, when it is advanced as a new grievance, that LoRD, DERBy has
caused notice to quit to be served upon the priest of the tenantry who
notoriously harbour a murderer, and who, if ordered by that priest
under pain of his Church's thunders, to hand over the scoundrel, would
do it in an hour, Mr. Punch cannot, help thinking that there must be
some other connection between Irishmen and Impudence besides their
both beginning with an I.

A SAINT IN CRINOLINE.
A NewspareR paragraph ascribes the following act of enlightened
devotion to a lady whom we should think incapable of it:-
“EUgáNIE, the Empress, has presented the dress worn by her on her first appear-
ance at Church after the birth of the Prince Imperial, the embroidery of which cost
£20,000, to the statue of the Virgin in Notre Dame de la Sparde.”
The writer of the above, perhaps, confounded the EMPREss of THE
FRENch with the QUEEN of SPAIN, or the Queen of some native tribe
lately converted from fetichism by the labours of jesuit missionaries.
. The idea of EugéNIE presenting a dress to the statue above named,
is too absurd. There was, indeed, said to be an idol of the same
denomination,-
“Who at Loretto dwelt; in wax, stone, wood,
And in a fair white wig looked wondrous fine;
But the EMPREss of THE FRENCH would have, at any rate, better
taste than to cause an image of the Madonna to be attired in that ridi.
culous fashion. Yet to dress such an image in Crinoline would be just
as ridiculous; and, doubtless, EugéNIE would not even put a statue of
Venus into the preposterous drapery in which her milliners have
arrayed herself. .
If otherwise, if the EMPREss has actually presented the Madonna
with her own §.". may expect that the EMPEROR will
honour his wife by following her example. He may just as well pre-
sent some Saint with one of his own uniforms, and dress the holy man's
*: up in a kepi, a tunic, and a pair of Napºleon boots. In kissin
the latter, an Imperial devotee would be enabled, in that case, to ki
two birds, as it were, with one stone.
BOOBIES OF BRIGHTON.
As BRIGHToN is about to fill again, or may be full already, for what
Mr. Punch knows, it may be agreeable and acceptable to the public
and especially the visitors to that watering-place, to know that medic
testimony pronounces the sanatory arrangements of the place to be
simply Abominable. A very large number of the smart houses are not
fit to be inhabited, because Drainage has not been attended to. Several
attempts have been made to obtain the necessary powers for purifying
the town; but these efforts have been defeated by “a knot of obstinate
and prejudiced persons, who are incapable of understanding anything
on the subject except that drainage costs money.” These Beasts—no,
Punch withdraws the word; for beasts do comprehend and value of clean-
liness;–these Idiots insist on Brighton's continuing to be poisoned.
It is no business of Mr. Punch's ; but as he has thousands of friends
who “use.” Brighton, he deems it friendly to advise them to mind their
eyes, or rather another portion of their faces. But who are these
recalcitrant jackasses who hinder the purification of theſº and of
whom the medical men complain?, Let Mr. Punch have all particulars,
and he pledges himself to make the parties throw themselves into the
sea after a very few applications of his cudgel.
THE NEW CUT.
When will innovation cease? SIR John BowFING informs us that
the celebrated Happy Dispatch of Japan is no longer, the elegant
ceremony it used to be, but that Reform has reduced it to a mere
execution. The insulted Japanese nobleman does not now enfranchise
at once his soul and his internals with the famous, “transverse cuts,”
but his friends assemble and simply cut off his head. This is offensive
effeminacy, and as a sound Protectionist-Conservative, Mr. Punch
augurs no good to the Japanese kingdom from it. Besides, suppose a
nobleman has no head—suppose, for instance, that some Wiscount
WILLIAMs of Japan had been told by a Japanese LoRD PAIMERSTON
to comprehend a subject before speaking upon it--how could the out-
raged lord vindicate #. honour?" Nations should keep in the old ruts
and the old cuts.

BOOT-MENDING. ST, JANUARIUS AT IT AGAIN!
HERE's Europe in pother, and bustle and bother seem a
Kings and Kaisers, at conclave and council and plot;
Each crowned Royal Brother distrusting the other,
And insular England distrusting the lot.
While, cause of the riot, herself calm and quiet,
Italia, at length by past blunders grown wise,
On her Apennines sitting is busily fitting -
Her boot with new welts, stouter soles and fresh tics.
Her delicate hands the fair lady commands,
To their task unfamiliar j earnest endeavour:
Her carving and limning her fiddling and hymning,
She has done for herself, but her boot-mending, never. -
Sometimes Pope, sometimes Kaiser, sometimes King, as adviser,
How her boot should be mended, she used to invite:
That it pinched her severely she felt but too clearly,
But trusted strange cobblers to set it all right.
Till, as might be expected, their botching’s detected,
In such a misfit, that poor Italy swears
She’s so pinched heel and toe that, to stand or to go,
Is equally torture, the boot while she wears.
So though France eager stands to take work off her hands,
And Austria's young Kaiser puts in the same suit;
sº Italy, “No-on a new tack I’ll go :
know my own pinch, and I’ll mend my own boot.”
CULLENARY COLLEGES.
. The Dublin Freeman affords the friends of education the gratifying
intelligence that:—
“On this day will commence the meeting of the four archbishops and two suf-
fragans from each of the provinces, to consider the condition of the Catholic Uni-
yersity, with a view to devise means which will improve its efficiency, and render
it fully worthy of its exalted object."
. This is the way to shut up the atheistical Colleges in which the mind
is dieted on raw food, gorged with plain historical matter of fact, and
stuffed with natural science. To denounce those base abodes of
unqualified learning was a mistake on the part of the Right Reverend
Fathers—who, are not infallible in policy and tact. The judicious
course would have been to take no notice of those dens—to ignore their
existence—to treat them with merited contempt. Then the holy and
sagacious prelates might, with dignity the more imposing, have pro-
ceeded to do what they are happily doing now—to cut out those
despicable institutions. The Fº Catholic University of Ireland, by
the efforts of the successors of St. Patrick, will soon be reared in tow-
ering majesty above the petty seminaries of unseasoned, knowledge.
Its venerable, Professors will emulate the miracle by which that illus-
trious saint relegated the batrachians to the bogs and confounded all the
other reptiles. They will drive away the vermin who occupy the chairs
of uncooked philosophy and literature. . As when, to employ a new
simile, the Sun, rising in unclouded splendour, at once dispels the
shades of night, and extinguishes the delusive luminaries which mis-
lead the wanderer, so will the Catholic University of Ireland, diffusin
an effulgence of glory, produce an effect upon the schools of unbiasse
thought which can be adequately described only in the pastoral of one
# º only genuine prelates who alone are incapable of writing
uSilan.
DR. LIVINGSTONE IN DESTITUTION.
To a letter dated Kongone Harbour, July 30, 1859, the illustrious
and adventurous DR. LIVINGstoNE adds a most important postscript.
He thus writes:—
“P. S. . . . We have failed to receive our regular newspapers, and not a Punch
except yours—nothing more is needed to prove us out of the world.”
DR. LIVINGSTONE has undergone great privations, but he has never
expressed so keen a sense of the severest of them as that which he
exhibits in complaining of his want of Punch. We do not know which
of two emotions we feel the more º with the distress
of the best of doctors, or pride by reason of the cause which chiefly
occasioned it. We wish we possessed the power of clairvoyance, and
could publish prophetic numbers in anticipation of events, so that
stores of Punch for long voyages and travels might be laid in by enter-
prising explorers like DR. LIVINGstoNE.
A CONUNDRUM FOR THE COURT CIRCULAR.
WHY is BARON BRAMwell's wit like scandal?
Because a little of it goes a very great way.
The good Saint Januarius has been at it again. This º
vulgar phrase, but we use it with all reverence; at least, with all the
reverence we can feel for the good Saint. While he conducts himself
in so unsanctified and common-place a fashion, he must expect to have
unsanctified and common-place things said of him. We repeat then,
that the Saint has been “at it again.” A letter from Naples, which
has been seized on by sub-editors, and stuck in all the newspapers
(anything, however stupid and nonsensical, does to fill their vacant
corners now Parliament is up), has edified the British public by
narrating how—
“The great event of the day for the clergy and the lower class of the population
is the miracle of St. Januarius, which has this year been accomplished with a
rapidity without example. The liquefaction of the blood of the Saint took place
yesterday morning in two minutes ſ Repeated salutes of artillery from all the forts
in the town announced the happy event; for when the miracle is effected rapidly
it is considered a sign of prosperity for the kingdom.”
If this be so, we are surprised that, more effective measures are not
regularly taken to ensure the so-called “miracle” being rapidly per-
formed. Whatever apparatus be employed for the occasion, we think
it is but clumsily adapted to the purpose. If a rapid liquefaction be
so “happy” an “event,” there surely are abundant means at hand to
guarantee it. Science surely might prescribe the taking of such º:
as would secure to a dead certainty the coveted result; and as the
measures now in use, it seems, cannot be relied upon, we should recom-
mend that others should be sought for, and adopted. The liquefaction
might, perhaps, be done more rapidly by steam; and if so it would be
easy to fit up such machinery as would work the so-called “miracle”
at more than railroad pace. Or if a dry heat be the best to effect a
rapid melting, we should advise the priests at Naples to buy them-
j. new bellows, and get up a rousing fire when it is wanted for the
process. Or, they might try what could be done by applying a hot-iron
when the melting should come off, in which case, upon melting days, it
might, perhaps, be suitable to heat the holy poker.
We learn further, from the letter which induces these remarks,
that—
“The miracle takes place three times aY. : the prayer and the fête lasting nine
days in May, eight davs in September, and one day in December. It also occurs in
the ancient town of Puzzoli, where the Saint was beheaded. The stone on which he
was executed is preserved in the church of that place, and his blood appears on it
at the same moment as the liquefaction takes place at Naples.”
Clearly, too, in this case, the helping hand of Science, might be
called in requisition, to secure the sure recurrence of this saintly
“double event.” By the aid of electricity, Naples and Puzzoli might
be instantly connected, and the simultaneous “appearance” of the
blood be guaranteed. in fact, the sanguinary apparition might be got
up just as easily as the appearing of the “gory locks” of Banquo at
the banquet, or of the Corsican ghost-brother with the blood-spot on
his shirt. If the faithful wish tº raise the reputation of their Saint,
we think that Science might materially assist them in so doing. A
belief in so-called “miracles” like those of JANUARIUs is clearly incom-
patible with scientific knowledge; and if due advantage were but taken
of this truth, many new and paying “miracles” might be brought into
the market. In places where the steam-engine has never been inspected,
and where electric telegraphs are utterly undreamt of, their agencies
might readily effect a so-thought “miracle,” and deceive the eyesights
blinded by the darkened superstitions which are the stock-in-trade and
groundwork of the Romish Church.
A SERIOUS CLOWN.
AccordLNG to a Bangor paper—
“The Derbyshire Advertiser states that a young man, a member of an evangelical
church, advertises in a local paper for board in a pious family, where his Christian
example would be considered a compensation.”
If the advertisement which the Welsh paper says that the Derby.
shire paper says that the local paper contains, is contained in that
aper, the evangelical young man who inserted it is a youth who might
o better than by acting in private the part of a hypocrite. . He might,
with more emolument probably, play. Clown on the stage, in a panto-
mime, where the cool impudence which appears to be his peculiar gift,
might be displayed to great advantage; provided that, in addition to
that talent, he is endowed, as he probably is, with a j for grimace,
and can also swallow strings of sausages and jump through windows.
The Soldier's Call.
It must be confessed that, in the way of flogging, the British Arm
outstrips every other army in the world. It is too bad that the Britis
Soldier, who never allows the enemy to see his back, should be called
upon to exhibit it to his own countrymen!

ANECDOTES FROM BALMORAL.
Collected, with the permission of Mr. Macflunkey, from the Scotch Papers.
ANY incident in the Highland life of our Sovereign will be interesting
to all her subjects, and we are happy to be able to give one which we
have obtained from a favourite domestic in the Royal household.
Going out for a drive, the other day, HER MAJESTY, as she graciously
ascended the carriage, was observed to look at the mists that were
curling around the majestic brow of the opposite mountain, Ben
Cuttypipe. The QUEEN pointed them out to PRINCEss BEATRICE,
and said, “Is it not like smoke P’” We have ourselves frequently
inspected the scenery, and can bear testimony to the accuracy of HER
MAJEsty's comparison.—Peebles Parasite.
The QUEEN, accompanied by the PRINCE Consort, was walking on
Saturday in the beautiful road from Glenbrimstone to Clantoddy, when
an old Highlander, named JAMES MACTURK, who has just accomplished
his hundred and seventy-second year, but is as hale as a man º:
met the distinguished couple. He was not aware, from the unpretend-
ing appearance of the Royal pair, that he was in presence of such
illustrious personages; . his cheerful salutation as he passed had
more of cordiality than of reverence. HER MAJESTY smilingly responded
“Good morning.” When told of his mistake, the old man, nothing
daunted, said, “Weel, she’s a bonny leddy.”—Fifeshire Fawner.
Truly fift. it is to know that the PRINCE OF WALEs, who in-
herits no small part of the wit and humour of his illustrious parents,
is also exceedingly well, read, in the history of Scotland. e are
| informed that His Royal Highness was amusing himself, on a recent
occasion, by an amicable engagement with the foils, in the hall at
Balmoral, his honoured antagonist being the youthful LoRD MACDUFF.
In the course of the graceful exercise the PRINCE, perhaps thinking
his foe somewhat slack to lunge, exclaimed, with an excellent imitation
of a distinguished tragedian, “Lay on, M'Acorpiº. It is equally to
the honour of a Prince who has been most carefully brought up, that
he abstained from completing the somewhat irreverent ſº of the
great Scottish dramatist.—Listener of the Lothians.
HER MAJESTY, it is well known, is very fearless about weather when
she is in the Highlands, and sometimes is pleased *ś to
rally her attendants upon their fear of catching cold. Overtaken by a
shower, one day last week, in the neighbourhood of Loch Jabber, the
Royal party paused for a few moments, and LADY HERMIONE Non-
MANTon, the lady-in-waiting, suggested that they should take refuge in
the nearest cottage. Her MAJESTY assented, and the shelter was
gained, when, turning with a smile to the fair and distinguished hydro-
phobian, the QUEEN said, “Now, LADY HERMIONE, 1 hope that you
are happier.”—Elgin Eavesdropper.
Our revered Sovereign, as is well known, sets an admirable example
of attendance to religious duties. Being in her pew on Sunday week,
in the little church of Banchorister, the Sovereign paid marked atten-
tion to the worthy minister, the ReverEND ANDREw FAIRSERVICE, as
he gave out the text. The QUEEN was then seen to, lay her Royal
hand upon a book, and the intense curiosity of the whole congregation
|Wis excited to discover what their Monarch was about to do. They
all rose, and either stood on the seats or leaned over the gallery tº
| observe the QUEEN’s movements. What was their delight to behold
their Ş. open the Sacred Volume, turn with º ease to the
|text, show it for a moment to PRINCEss ALICE, and lay the book down
% to listen, attentively, to the excellent minister.—Clackmannan
atterer.
QUEEN Victoria takes a wifely interest in the field-sports of her
illustrious husband, and rarely fails to come down-stairs on His Royal
Highness's return from deer-stalking, and look at the spoils of the
chace. An unusually fine stag fell a victim to the Prince's great skill
last Wednesday, and on its being submitted to HER MAJESTY for
examination, the QUEEN regarded it with mingled admiration and com:
passion, and remarked to the PRINCE of WALEs, “Really, Papa ought
to be in the Rifles.”—Glasgow Gobemouche.
“Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,” says our great Scottish
bard, ALLAN RAMsAY, but we are delighted to be able to state that in
the case of our beloved Sovereign, old ALLAN's dictum does not hold
ſº e have reason to º positively to the fact that the QUEEN
as repeatedly said that she has been graciously pleased to enjoy

exceedingly good nights during her sojourn at Balmoral. That this
arises in part from our QUEEN’s mind º calm in the conviction of
being beloved by the nation, we do not, as loyal subjects, doubt; but
for the honour of amid Scotland we must claim for the mountain air of
Caledonia some of the credit of procuring for her monarch “rosy
dreams and slumbers light.”—Inverary Idiot. -
It has, we believe, been remarked that after a certain period o
enjoyment of a delightful scene, human nature becomes less keen in its
enjoyment, and satiety ensues. The observation is founded on a good
general knowledge of mankind. But that there are exceptions to the
rule we are able to testify, and one of them is in the case of the illus-
trious offspring of our beloved Sovereign. On their coming out upon
the lawn at Balmoral, on the morning after their arrival, the PRINCEss
Louis A exclaimed, that she believed the scenery grew more and more
beautiful every year, to which remark her brothers and sisters assented.
Need we add that the indulgent smiles of their royal, parents showed
that even if the scene had not improved (and it would be difficult to
improve it), they were not displeased at the enthusiasm of their
amiable children.—Dundee Dunderhead.
N.B., Mr. Punch, his Sovereign's most devoted admirer and cham-
pion, solemnly declares that he will publish a great many more of these
things (with their exact pedigrees), if the Scottish pennygrubs do not
abstain from persecuting that Royal lady and her § with the
ºjºs effusions of unmitigated flunkeydom. Nemo se impune

SPORTS IN THE NORTH.
GAME case was lately
tried at the Gates-
head County Police
Court, when MR.
RAM.sey, who was
on the Bench, terri-
fied everyone by let-
ting off in the open
court the following
opinion, which we
have Fº: up,
with all the marks
of the magisterial
lead about it, in the
Northern Counties’
Advertiser:—
Ö.
|
º
\ſ. |
Tºº
** MR. RAMSEY said
the deputation gave
him the right to shoot
- himself, or to give liber-
3. shoot to anybody
else.”
We do not know
whether the report
is a correct one, nor
are we told whether
MR. RAMSEY avail-
ed himself of the
- right that he said
the deputation gave him. If he did, it is to be hoped that MR. RAMSEY
is a very bad shot, and did not succeed in making game of himself, or of
anyone else. If a Magistrate has “the right to shoot himself,” then
our Great Unpaid should be taught “the Rifle, and how to use it;”, or
else, failing to hit the object they aim at, they might wound the beadle,
or wing the clerk, or kill, half-a-dozen lawyers, which would be a loss
that society at large would grievously deplore, and could but ill replace.
If MR. RAMSEY has any fire-arms, they s ould be taken away from him,
for fear that he might, in some moment of over-zeal, be measuring out
his own charge, and passing sentence, ready primed and loaded, upon
himself. We have often heard of the sword of Justice; but a musket is a
new weapon to be placed in the hands of that blind old lady. It Qught
to be removed from her, or she will be doing serious injury with it one
of these days, unless the presenters take good care beforehand to with-
draw, their charge. We have not yet heard whether this new sport,
which at all events has the one merit of accelerating ſº...". at the
bar, is to be introduced next term into Westminster Hall. BRAMWELL,
however, will be safe; for we all know that, as a judge, he is not worth
his powder and shot.

“WHAT power on earth, save Rome,” frantically demands a Roman

Most Roman Catholic journals are miserably ill-informed, which is
of no particular consequence to them, inasmuch as their admirers are
usually a little deeper in the misery of ignorance. But it is unfor-
tunate for ill-informed persons to risk observations in the presence of
Mr. Punch.
He replies to the above demand,
The BRITIsh PARLIAMENT.

. Now then, gentlemen of Over the Mountains. You see that a Par-
liament can make quite as good a Saint as a Pope. And we doubt
not that in the entries of that angelic registrar, whom the Reverend
LAURENCE STERNE states to be in the habit of crying over his ledger,
the title conferred by the Parliament of 1768 is written out just as
large as any one which has ever been conferred by a Pope, from

POACHING UNDER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.
The following pretty little illustration of rural felicity is extracted from a country
paper:—
“Condition of DoRsets HIRE LABouhers.-At the Wimbourne Petty Sessions, last week, a case occurred
which nfully illustrates the condition of the Dorsetshire peasantry. GEoRGE FRAMPtoN, a labourer, was
charged with being in possession of a hare, a fortnight old, which he had caught while he was at work in a
harvest.field. A nominal fine of 1s., but a real mulct of 12s. costs, were inflicted upon him; but, inasmuch
as it was stated that he had a wife and five children, and that his wages were only 8s. a week, a fortnight was
allowed him in which to pay the money.”
The Magistrates have no option in cases of this kind but to convict; for a nominal offence
they must inflict a nominal fine, and cannot help the costs which attend it. However, they
might as well have sent this unhappy swain, #º. to prison at once as have allowed
him a fortnight in which to pay 13s. Given, 8s, a week, a wife and five children, how shall
a Dorsetshire swain contrive to save 13s. out of the money in two weeks? Twice eight is 16;
take i3 from 16 and there remain 3. There are 3s ſºft for the swain to live upon and
maintain his wife and children. A county meeting should be called in Dorsetshire to take
into consideration this problem appointed for swain FRAMPTON to solve... Somebody might
perhaps, move, so to speak, the previous question—namely, how any British swain could
contrive to exist and keep a family of six upon 8s. a week at all? No wonder that a swain,
with a limited imagination, and a dreadfully low moral sense, should, think that a little
poaching, might furnish, a practical solution of this difficulty—especially ºf, of such
mitigated enormity as the offence of picking up a hare, that, came in the way, of his sickle.
The probable hunger of such a swain might almost be allowed to reduce his offence to
gameslaughter. - - - -
Wimbourne is in Dorsetshire. From Dorsetshire to Warwickshire is some way; but if
the person who was mean ºpough or cruel enough to play the informer against FRAMPTON
is an inhabitant of Wimböurne or the adjoining district, his neighbours might surely,
amongst them, manage to send such a disagreeable brute as far as Coventry.

We believe that as the condition proposed by the SULTAN is an impossible one, arrangements
are being made by the Pope for transferring the machinery of the fire to Naples, and for
combining it with the present, contrivance for boiling the blood of St. Januarius. The

Whose story I’ll deliver.
Firstways he steamed to Ning-Hou. Fou,
Along with his Legation,
And there our vessel was brought to

Conducted by a Mandarin,
A blowin' like a porpus.
This box was made without a lid,
But hadn't got no winder,
That breathin, it might not forbid,
But observation hinder.
With necessaries it was stored,
Though sight it held a check on,
Had food and liquor both aboard,
And backy too, I reckon.
Upon a raft 'twas sot to go,
Considerable pretty,
All up the Ki-Tcheou Yun-ho,

Still shut their grand state box in.

And brought, with care particular,
To where they first intruded,
Like blacks inside a nigger-car,
As snug, and more secluded.
I reckon that’s the way to treat
Our#. and glorious nation,
And offer humble pie to eat

But we must swaller down our pride,
When dollars we are seekin',
And be content, old hoss, to ride

CANT OF TWO KINDS.
THE author of the subjoined advertisement, extracted from the
Lamp, seems to hold somewhat more than the doctrine that mendicancy
is meritorious:—
HE UNFINISHED CHURCH.-4:500 are yet wanted, for repayment
of which, Heaven is the security. Still, my dear brethren, is the Congregation
of Kentish Town your suppliant; still am I cºmpelled to appeal thus to your charity
for the love of Him why gave you all. It is for the glory of His name ! . Pray, then,
listen. Pray give be the amount ever so trifling ; for it is the small sums that
make the large amount, and welcome, indeed, and blessed are the offerings of the
poor Proud may you feel when, with the blessing of God, our Church is finished,
that not “uly you, but your children's children may reverence it as the monument
of your charity. Jo º shall I announce to you the day on which a Grand High
Mass will be solemnly ºld for you, its benefactors, for whom the Holy Sacri-
fice is new constantly offered up every Monday.—Your true Brother in Christ,
2, Fortess Place, Kentish Town, London, N.W. RoBERT Swift.
“The work in which the REv. Robert Swift is engaged has our cordial approval
and sympathy. “N. CARDINAL WISEMAN.”
To solicit alms on account of a chapel, certainly, is not a species of
begging which a divine need be ashamed of; but the reverend author
of #. above composition goes rather out of his way to imitate the style
and language of a common mendicant, begging off his own hook.
“Gentleman, ar yer got ar a copper to relieve a poor man? do bestow
| a trifle, Sir, Gentleman,—do, Sir, I-please,, Sir,”—is the species of
importunity which is suggested by the appeal of the Rev. MR, SwiFT
to the charity of his co-religionists. Apparently, he considers that, not
only is the practice of begging wº of imitation, but also the lan-
#. which is usually adopted by the followers of that profession.
e are glad, however, to see that he is not too bigoted to borrow one
little piece, of persuasive rhetoric, from the charity sermon of his
renowned Protestant namesake. “If you like the security, down with
your dust,” said the VERY REveREND Jos ATHAN SwiFT; and he said
no more. He thought that was enough. He did not go on to say that
he was “compelled to appeal” to his “dear brethren,” and to address
them after the pattern of “Do, Sir; pray, Sir.” But one would hardly
be surprised to see the REVEREND #: exhibiting himself in the
street, at Kentish Town, attired in his surplice, as an ecclesiastical
equivalent to the mechanic out of employ, who, wearing a respect;
able white apron, goes about singing “We’ve got no work to do,” and
WOL. XXXVII.
bawling, “My Chr-r-r-r-istian friends, I am sorry to appear before you
in this disgraceful situation.” The unemployed mechanic sometimes
sings a methodistical hymn; and perhaps M.R., Swift, imitating his
§:. example, with a due difference, would oblige the public with a
regorian chant.
Still, begging for one's Church is one thing, but begging for one's
self is another; and here is an advertisement from the opposite theo:
logical quarter, which beats the foregoing one hollow in respect of
cant, because the cant of this other announcement is obviously insin-
cere. Read it:— -
“NOTICE.
“The Editor is acquainted with several servants of Christ who, for trant of means, are
unable to distribute “THE Evangelist" to the extent they desire. If, therefore, any of
our Christian readers feel that for Christ's name sake they would like to further this object,
the Editor would feel great pleasure in receiving Donations for the purpose.
“44ſ. All orders should be addressed to the Publishers, MR. —, Welbeck Street,
$.” Square, London, W.; or to Messrs. —, Tichbourne Court, High Holborn,
nqon.”
This is, of course, a mere dodge to promote the circulation of a
religious periodical. It is remarkable for its sordid commercial
irreverence, in which quality it excels “Sanctity of the Grave com-
bined with Economy of Charge.” Therefore, it is more ridiculous than
the maudlin, but enthusiastic appeal in the Lamp, and, of the two, the
more highly calculated to bring religion into contempt.

[October 15, 1859.
BIG BEN.—AN ODE.
1.
A Worce ran through the town,
Sad as the airy tongue which spread
The news through #. “mighty Pan is Dead!”
A voice ran through the town,
And men went up and down,
Whisp'ring the awful fact,
“Big Ben is cracked!”
2.
Heavy the tidings fell.
Could it be true? The Bell,
Whose ponderous iron tongue
..., Gong-like, the hours had rung,
Till Westminster put cotton in her cars!
The Bell, whose solemn, slow, ding-dong,
Disgusted Common-Law-Court praters,
And Parliamentary debaters, , .
Proclaiming “Time is short and talk is long!”
The Bell, in strife conceived, in struggle cast
O'erlooked by DENIsoN, looked down upon by
The Bell of many blue-books—hung at last,
After so many perils, to miscarry!
ARRY-
3.
Commissioners of Works came, went, and came,
'Ere out of MEARs's mould his frame,
Majestic he upreared:
And when at length his voice was heard,
Doctors of Music listened to his E:
Great Tweedle-dum with greater Tweedle-dee,
In solemn conclave on the question sat,
Was it E sharp–E natural—E flatf
But what his E was, little cared the crowd,
They only knew that E was loud,
And were content with that.
4.
So Big Ben had a sound to fit his size;
But how to lift him nearer to the skies,
To the gilt cock-loft crowning BARRY's tower?
Where fix the tackle—how apply the power?
All questions to give pause. For Lo,
Like that great architect, his house who planned,
But left no place wherein the stairs could stand,-
Illustrious BARRY, ever so,
His clock-tower's plan prepares
Leaving no room for clock and bells to get up-stairs.
5.
Then DENT and DENIson their wrath's full vials poured,
On BARRY, and on QUARM, BARRY's factotum:
And letters through the Times were fiercely showered,
(Most wearisome to all but those who wrote 'em,)
While, like the bier of MAhom ET, up-hung
*Twixt Barth and Heaven, Big Ben was slung;
Till, at the last, by wond’rous engineering, -
And checks, and counter-checks, and side-way steering,
Up in the tower he i.
And at the monster in his gilded chamber
ſº the proverbial fly in amber)
old climbers gazed, with scarce believing stare,
And “wondered how the devil he got there.”
6.
At length—at length—our clock-tower had a voice!
In Gothic clock-face eke it could rejoice—
So Gothic in blue lettering indeed, -
Save antiquaries, none the time o'day might read—
But clocks need hands to show the time,
As well as bells the hours to chime,
And works to move their wheels.
The face and bell, and works are there
But where the hands? And echo answered “where?”—
Then the Times columns showed,
How the old feud still glowed,
And DENISON and BARRY, truceless foes, -
On the clock-hands astride, were fiercely bandying blows!
7.
Meanwhile the vacant clock-face, without fingers,
ln º: of Time and Tide in idlesse lingers,
ntil the public voice, in fierce assault,
Rose asking “Whose the fault?”
“Not mine—not mine,” quoth DENT,
“My clock was made, and went.”
“Not mine,” quoth BARRY, with mellifluous benison
Upon smooth-speaking DENIson.
“Not mine,” quoth DENIson, as to old Harry
He recommended BARRY.
8.
That battle duly fought—at last,
e hour and minute-hands are cast:
Upon the Gothic face,
At length they take their place—
At length the clock is going, -
And DENIson and DENT, and BARRY all are crowing !
And now the Quarter Bells are hung,
And, humble seconds to Big Ben, give tongue,
And joyous Westminster at length may say,
...We have a Clock that tells the time of day:
Though many years have in the work been lost,
And twenty thousand pounds it cost,
We have our clock—and tisn't we that pay.”
9.
With BARRY, DENIsoN, & Co., sore grieved
ondon, from charge and counter-charge relieved,
At last, beheld the lingering work achieved,
Yet scarce its º believed.
But there before us, palpable to sight,
Upon the Campanile's gilded height—
In Gothic gravity and pride of place,
Shone the gold-checkered and blue-lettered face—
Nothing that to a clock pertains there lacked,
Nor hands that marked the minutes and the hours—
Nor quarter-bells that spoke, with humbler powers,
While vibrant, with a voice that shook the towers,
Big Ben boomed out, at length—a mighty fact
For weeks we heard the sound,
Tolling the hours, for miles and miles around;
But scarce our tympanums familiar had grown
With that portentous tone—
When lo! strange silence, falling
On ears unwonted, tells the news appalling—
Big Ben is cracked!
Where the crack came, and how—
Whether in rim or bow—
. If in his frame congenitally hid—
Whether the hammer j,
Not wisely but too well,
Hitting him harder than folks .# it did—
Nobody seems to know—or no one likes to tell.
Was't that they braced him up too tight?
Was’t that his metal was too slight?
Alas, we know not—we but know the fact.
Big Ben is cracked!

BOMBA REDIVIVU.S.
2- URELY the world has not for-
- - gotten BoMBA, of pious, or,
at least, of superstitious
memory? If so, here is
something to put the world
in mind of him. We quote
it from the letterofanaples
correspondent, which ap-
ared in a contemporary a
ew days since:-
“To-day (the 20th) in accord-
ance with the traditions of the
monarchy, the Court proceeded
to the Cathedral in great pomp.
The King, the Queen, the young
Princes, the King's brothers, the
Count and CountEss of AGUILA,
and the Count and Countess of
TRAPANI, went to venerate the
relics of St. Januarius, and re-
ceived the benediction of his
Eminence CARDINAL RIARIO,
Archbishop of Naples.”
What the relics are, the
account omits to state. The
saint's hair-shirt, very pos-
sibly, and a handful of the
ashes which he used to wear
on fast days; and his last
- - washing-bill perhaps, and
one of his eye-teeth, and some cuttings of his corns, and a snip off his big
toe-nail, and a lock of his back hair, clipped on the day of his beheading.
Such precious things as these would be quite as well worth keeping as
many saintly relics we have seen preserved in Italy, and which the faith-
ful are on show-days permitted K. the payment of a trifle) to behold.
Whether they be things for a Christian king to “venerate,” and for a
Christian Court the while he does so to dance attendance at his heels,
is a question which we leave to other writers to dilate upon. Enough
for us, in all due reverence, to chronicle the fact; and to remark, that
in our thinking the benediction of the Cardinal was a fit close to the
ceremony. Very surely were we asked to “venerate” such relics, we
should be apt to make response that we’d be blessed if we would; and
the presence of the Cardinal to perform this benediction seems, to
show that such response is expected by the guardians of the relics
of the saint.
After all, we almost wonder that the KING does not abandon this
“tradition of the monarchy,” for it seems to bring him no great
popularity or profit. We learn from the same letter, that-
“The Royal cortège passed through the whole city. The people present were,
however, not very numerous; a fact attributed to excess of zeal on the part of the
police, in unnecessarily occupying the streets with agents and gendarmes.”
This would really seem to intimate, that the people don't care much
for the “traditions of the monarchy,” in which respect, perhaps, they
show more wisdom than the KING. wiy the police should cram the
streets with agents and gendarmes, because his, Majesty is going to
“venerate” a saint, is a riddle which it somewhat perplexes us to
guess. The most probable solution is, that the KING is #. his father,
and not being over-popular, likes to go out under arms.
Well, a king can do no wrong—at least the proverb says so; but
were his Majesty to ask us our opinion on the subject, we should tell
him to show less sham “veneration” for the saints, and to show a little
more true veneration for his people. , We should advise him to consult
their interests rather than his priests', and to set his face against the
superstitious practices which the “traditions of the monarchy” have
kept hitherto in countenance. The more he trusts his people, the
more credit he will get: If he gives them ſº liberty, he will
probably enjoy greater liberty himself, and will not have to cram his
streets with agents and gendarmerie, to protect his sacred person from
danger of Lynch law. In short, the less he acts like BoMBA the more
he will be liked: and if he would take steps to earn an honourable
name, the fewer steps he takes in the paternal shoes the better.
“SAVING CLAUSE.”—Those of the Cato'-nine-Tails, we fancy, could
well be saved in the British Army.
THE LETTER OF THE LAW AT LYNN.
THE Lynn Advertiser contains an account of a remarkable adminis:
tration of what seems to have been meant for justice, on the part of
country Magistrates, in conjunction with an exciseman. The case is
thus stated:–
“WORDSLEY. PETTY SEssions.-Monday.
“(Before W, TRow and J. Holcroft, Esq.rs)
“CAUTION to BEERHouse KEEPERS.–IMPortANT INFormations UNDER THE Ex-
cise Act.—The infringement of the Excise Laws relating to Beerhouse keepers was
attended with heavy penalties in two cases heard before the Bench this morning.
MR. Josiah REDFord, Supervisor of Excise, laid an information against MARY
PLANT, a Beerhouse keeper, living at Rowley, for having in her possession a third
of a pint of brandy, contrary to the statute in that case made and provided. The
information was laid under the 3rd and 4th Wict., c. 61, sec. 10, which renders any
Beerhouse keeper having in his possession “sweets," which include British wines,
brandy, and other spirituous liquors, liable to a penalty not exceeding £50."
MR. Josiah REDroRD, it will be, presumed, not being a common
informer, laid this information in the painful but conscientious dis-
charge of his duty as a British exciseman. Yet-
“MR. REDForm stated that there was no suspicion in this case of any intention
on the part of defendant to sell spirits without a licence; it was only a violation
of the law in keeping any quantity of “sweets" in the entered premises, liable to
be inspected by the Excise officers. He asked the Bench if they thought it a case
in which they thought proper to make a recommendation for a reduction of the
penalty which they thought proper to inflict, to give him an intimation in order
that he may forward it to the Inland Revenue Board."
Then what occasion was there for MR. ReproRD to inform against
MARY PLANT * , Are excisemen bound, to bring people to punishment
for a merely technical violation of the law, which they do not even sus-
pect those people of intending?, And if they are, have Magistrates no
power to dismiss merely nominal charges?. From MRs. PLANT's case, it
appears that excisemen must inform on frivolous pretences, and that
agistrates must inflict monstrous fines. For-
“The defendant acknowledged having the brandy in the house, but pleaded
ignorance of the law in this respect. The Bench informed her of the amount of
penalty to which she had rendered herself, liable, and, under the circumstances,
taking into consideration that the house had been properly conducted hitherto,
inflicted the penalty of £12 10s., at the same time making a recommendation for a
further reduction of the penalty.”
So that the Magistrates could not, apparently, reduce the fine below
£12 10s. An offence against the Excise Laws, accordingly, is worse
than homicide. Wilful malice is the essence of murder; killing by
mere misadventure is not even, manslaughter. In the case of an un-
witting transgression of the Excise Laws, the judge can only pass
sentence, and forward the recommendation to the proper quarter.
Before the same bench—
“A similar information was laid against a Beerhousekeeper named Joseph WALL,
living at Summerhill, Kingswinford. The defendant was represented by his wife,
who pleaded guilty. The prohibited article in this case was about half-a-pint of
elderberry wine, which MRs. WALL said she made solely for the use of her own
family. She said she had kept a beerhouse for 26 years, and was not aware she was
doing wrong. The Bench, upon the recommendation of the Excise officer, inflicted
a similar fine of £12 10s., also with an intimation that the Excise authorities should
be communicated with in order to reduce the penalty."
Another report gives the quantity of elderberry wine as four bottles;
but what then? If it had been a. ...i. an ounce, a drachm,-
nay, a minim-would not the exciseman have been obliged to inform,
and the Magistrates to convict and punish, all the same? By the way,
their Worships seem to have taken the law from MR. REDFORD, as
implicitly as they would if he had been their clerk.
All this kind of thing may be perfectly constitutional; but is there
§§ * injustice, or maladministration of justice, in the Papal
tates
ONE MINUTE'S ADVICE TO MEDICAL STUDENTS.
THE inaugural addresses have just been delivered at the metropolitan
medical schools. The one at the Middlesex Hospital, by MR. MITCHELL
HENRY, though modestly called an Introductory Lecture, might, from
its truth and eloquence, have been more correctly termed a Finished
Discourse. He enlarged forcibly on the beauties and advantages of
“earnestness of purpose;”, and so earnest and impressive did, the
learned gentleman seem to be in º down the moral law, that we
really should accuse him of practising, like an honourable physician,
everything that he preached. If medical students do occasionally, go

they follow it, in preference to those paths that sometimes lead them to

the old truth hold so firmly as in the medical, that “practice makes
perfect.”

According to his Moniteur, the EMPEROR has decided that he never
means again to go to war “for an idea.” If this, be #: his intention,
he must give up thoughts of battling about the Papal See, or else
punsters will protest that he is fighting for an-otion.

ATA DINNER GIven by My Lond BRoadaches to some of His TENANTs, CURAgoa Is HANDED
IN A LIQUEUR-GLAss To OLD TURNIPTops, who, swallowing IT WITH MUCH RELISH, SAYS-
“Oi zay, Young MAN! 01'LL Tak zum o' THAT IN A Moog ' "
THE POPE’S ALLOCUTION.
“The following is the text of the allocution of the Pope, delivered at the Con-
sistory of the 26th ult.”:—
IN June, my dear Brethren, with heart full of grief,
We cursed, you remember, each infidel thief
Who was trying to grab at Ravenna, Bologna,
And other domains of which we are the owner.
We told the assassins they'd made a great mull, for
Their Present was sin, and their Future was sulphur.
This kindly remonstrance we hoped would succeed,
For they knew that we loved them most dearly, indeed,
And 'twas only in love, if we shortened their lives,
And sent Switzers to finish their babies and wives'.
But they mocked at our gentleness, sweetness, and patience,
And now the base demons have prigged the Legations.
They turn out our spies, and they empty our gaols,
§§ of tortures therein tell indelicate tales,)
ur mendicant monks they revile and abuse,
And brutally bid them to wash and wear shoes;
And the Qdour of Sanctity, martyrdom's wealth,
They say is a case for their vile Board of Health.
They publish most blasphemous books, too; in one
They dare to assert the earth goes round the sun;
And as for our miracles, think how they hate 'em
When º say Januarius’s blood is pomatum,
Consign Weeping Pictures to brokers or cupboard,
And swear that no statue of saint ever blubbered.
The wretches, the monsters! But, Brethren, we find
Much comfort in bearing this fact in our mind,-
The parties who’ve kicked us from out each Legation
Are only the folks who have had education:
The low, and the dull, and the poor, and the mean,
Are as fond of their Pope as they ever have been.
And now, my dear Brethren, if cursing would do,
We’d blaze at the beggars till all things were blue;
But the ears of the wicked, to yerbal attacks
Are judicially bunged up with infidel wax,

POOR STOWELL THE INFORMER.
THE following brief Police Report will be read
with pain:-
“GUILDHALL-The further hearing of the charge of
conspiracy to defraud against THoMAs Stowell, the
notorious common informer, having been appointed to
take place at an early hour yesterday morning, the case
was called on as soon as Sir W. CARDEN took his seat on
the bench, but defendant did not appear. According to
the usual custom, the Court waited an hour for him;
and at the expiration of that time the Magistrate or-
dered him to be called upon his recognisances, he having
been admitted to bail late on Saturday. Upon it being
ascertained he was not in attendance, his own recog-
misances, and those of his two sureties, were ordered to
be ostreated, and a warrant was issued for his appre-
hension."

We should consider the severity of the º:
that he must undergo in wrestling down those
sensibilities, which are pained in discharging
the ungrateful task of bringing inadvertent or
unintentional offenders against a mere statute,
to punishment. The popular obloquy, also,
which is attached to his calling, and which he
shares with the despised and abhorred but bene-
ficent Jack Ketch, necessitate on his part an
amount of moral courage which commands our
approbation. And when he gets into trouble, on
a charge of conspiracy to defraud, from a mere
excess of that impulse which constitutes his
ruling love, we are sensible of the same regret
as that which we feel when Jack Ketch comes
to be hanged.

And we hereby denounce to the world, and all time,
Each Romagnese act as a horrible crime.
Let the infidels, heretics, traitors, and knaves.
Have no peace in their lives and no rest in their graves:
The dungeon and scaffold, the steel or the rope
Shall teach them to wrong their affectionate Pope;
Fire, famine, and slaughter consume them away,
Till Beelzebub collars the last. Let us pray.
LAW FOR THE LAWYERS.
The revelations made before the Gloucester and Wakefield Com:
missioners, touching Election practices in both those places, will
probably impel that eminent Christian, the ATToRNEY-GENERAL, to
§onside; hoº far he can by a short Act of Parliament, release the
inhabitants from electoral responsibility. But Mr. Punch is anxious to
H. out to Gloucester and Wakefield, that they never in their topical
ives had such a chance, as now, of doing a good thing for themselves.
Look at the squad of º whose guilt, as direct, or, indirect
bribers, is either avowed by themselves or is beyond a doubt.. The
anti-bribery law is explicit and strong. Surely it can be put in force,
and a very large removal of the Attorney nuisance can be made in, the
two places. This would be a sanatory step, and, if vigorously taken,
might save the necessity of disfranchisement.
A Railway Bore.
TRAVELLERs not only see wonderful things, but often say stupid
things. For instance, we heard a First-Class Passenger inquire the
other day, and as the train was going at the rate of fifty miles an hour,
it was impossible to escape him, “Whether another Route in Railway
language meant a Branch line P” It is needless to state that we got
out at the very next station.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PAUL-PRYISM AT THE POST-OFFICE.
The question, Who’d be an employá in the Post-Office at Liverpool?
will probably suggest itself to the reflective reader, on perusal of the
dozen interrogatories following, which the Postmaster of Liverpool,
“acting on his own authority alone,” has (the Daily News informs us)
lately “judged it expedient” to put to his “subordinates,” but also
fellow-servants:—
“P. O., Liverpool, Aug. 24.
“For MR. —, who I request will carefully answer the following questions, for
the information of the Postmaster-General:- -
“1. Where do you reside?
: 2. What rent do you pay? what taxes?
! 3. Do you pay the rent quarterly, monthly, or weekly?
“4. Have you any income beside that received in your official capacity, here, or
do you carry on or share profits in any kind of business. If so, state particulars?
“5. What family have you? If you have any children state their ages, and
whether any of them is in employment; and if so, the wages received, and by
whom employed?
“6. Did your expenditure for the year ended 31st July last exceed your income?
If so, what amount?
“7. State as nearly as you can the principal items of expenditure, and what
caused the excess?
... 8. State the amount of your debts, and to whom they are owing?
"9. From whom have you borrowed money during the last two years? When
did you borrow it, and has any portion of it been repaid t Have you undertaken to
repay debts by weekly instalments or otherwise?
“10. Have you lent money to any person in this office? If so, state his name,
the amount, and when the transaction occurred; also, whether such money or any
portion of it, has been repaid?
'' 11., Are you a bondsman for any person (whether connected with this office or
nºt) who has borrowed money from a loan society? If so, state his name, address,
the sum you are surety for, and when the loan was contracted; also the name of
the Society from which the loan was obtained?

and if so, state how much it cost you, and did you leave before the
fireworks?

WHEN Parliament is up one sees strange things in the papers., Here
for instance, is a specimen, which we copy from the Times of about a
fortnight since:—
“A RAILway TRAIN Stopped by Mtish Rooms.-" I was travelling last week,
writes a Correspondent of the Durham Advertiser, “by a railway on the English side
of the borders of South Wales, when we happened to pass a field strown with a most
luxuriant growth of mushrooms. I had hardly remarked the circumstance to my
companion when we felt the train suddenly stop, and looking out to the front we
saw, to our astonishment, the driver jump off the engine, vault the fence, and pro-
ceed to hiſ his hat with the treasure.” in a moment the guard was over the fence
following his example, which, as may be supposed, was infectious, for in less than
half a minute every door was thrown open and the field covered with the passengers,
every one of whom brought back a pretty good hatfull. . Not till this desirable
result was attained did we proceed on our journey, some of us wondering whether
we had been dreaming, and whether, instead of the Welsh borderland, we were not
travelling by some newly constructed forest line in the far west of America. We
begged ãº guard, who did not seem quite comfortable about the joke, to have the
place entered for the future in his line of route as "The Mushroom Station.’”
It certainly sounds strange to hear of the stoppage of a railway train by

Railway, we assuredly should not have felt, so much, surprised at it.
The trains upon that H. travel so like snails, that the least thing in
the world would suffice to check their progress. , Were an Eastern
Counties engine-driver to pull up an express, that he might go and
catch a butterfly, or to stop a special train that he might get a pint of
beer, or try and find a sixpence that he happened to have dropped, we
should view it as an every day and ordinary occurrence. Punctuality
and speed are sovery little studied on the Eastern Counties Railway, that
we question if the guard would condescend to make a note of so trivial
a matter as the delay of half an hour or so in the arrival of a train.
Indeed, supposing i. a stoker chose to go and i. blackberries, or
to fly a kite, or play a game of marbles with the driver, we doubt if the
Directors, were the matter brought before them, would take the pains
to haul him over his own coals.

16.1
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EXHIBITION OF THE WORKS OF VERY EARLY
MASTERS.
ConsiderABLE excitement has prevailed of late in juvenile artistic
circles, in consequence of a proposal to get up an Exhibition of the
works of very young, or early, British Masters. The proposition, we
hear, emanated from the MASTERs SMITH, whose name is too well
known to need a word of introduction, and whose nursery has long
been quite a nursery of art. Directly they conceived the felicitous
idea, the MASTERs. SMITH held daily meetings with themselves for the
purpose of determining how they might work it out: and in order to
secure the best advices on the subject, they took into their confidence
their friends the MASTERs BRown, whose practical suggestions proved
of infinite assistance in bringing the conception to a tangible result.
At the hint of MasTERs BRowN, the MASTERs SMITH obtained parental
leave to use their nursery as the room where the projected Exhibition
should be held; the leave or lease, being however only granted on
ºion that all visitors on entrance were to mind and wipe their
snoes.
Having settled these preliminaries, the MASTERs SMITH and BRowN
formed themselves forthwith into a Hanging Committee, and issued
notices at once to all the nurseries adjacent, that the works for
exhibition might be instantly sent in. It being thought desirable, as
space was somewhat limited, to confine the show to specimens of one
especial branch of art, much anxious cogitation was expended in deter-
mining which the one should be that the Committee should select.
The MAstERs SMITH inclined to vote for the Very Early Outline, or
Slate Pencil School of drawing; while the BRowns, being Masters
somewhat more advanced, proposed that Water Colour artists only
should exhibit, they having themselves recently received a box of
paints, which they doubtless thought would place them far a-head of
all competitors. The matter ºf formally referred to MASTER
GREEN, that young arbitrator settled the question in dispute by
deciding that #. SMITHs and BRowNs should meet on neutral ground;
and that the Exhibition should include none but works of the Black
Figure, or Sticking Plaister School, in which he (MASTER GREEN) had
principally studied. After much debating, this decision was agreed
to; a result owing mainly to MASTER GREEN’s mamma, who promised
a supply of open tarts to the Committee, if they would consent to carry
out the suggestion of her pet:
As is commonly the case in all our Fine Art Exhibitions, the works
which were sent in were more than there was room for, and the hanging
became literally a matter of suspense. The usual rule, however, was
adopted by the hangers; and inasmuch as pleasing everybody was
quite out of the question, they determined to please nobody—except, of
course, themselves. . Their own works, being placed in #. very best
É. the remaining space was filled up with whatever came most
andy, and chanced to be a fit.
Last Monday being the day fixed for the private view, we enjoyed
the usual privilege of gratuitous admission. This favour being of
course a gag to hostile criticism, we
feel at liberty to make but few ad-
yerse remarks. To begin at the
beginning, of the works we chiefly
noticed, we may mention No. 1,
which we heard an Early Master at
our elbow call a Wunner. - -
H teresting picture is entitled simply
Ma, and is the work of Master
WHITE, aged four years and three
- - . weeks. ot having the felicity of
- - knowing MRs. White, of course
we cannot state whether the likeness be correct; and we should cer-
tainly in gallantry incline to the conviction, that ¥ſms. WHITE is surely
not so black as she is painted. But although perhaps fair justice is not
done to her complexion, our readers will perceive from our engraving
of the picture there is a breadth of design about the bottom of the
flºº, which seems taken from the Crinoline, if not exactly from the Ar
e.
In MASTER Jones's Sister Annie (No. 22) the Crinoline is handled
with even greater freedom, and its outlines
are depicted in all their naked truth. There
is a charming boldness in this treatment of
the nude, which stamps the work at once
as a very early masterpiece. An artist of
maturer years than MASTER JONES would
have probably not ventured on so delicate
a subject. MASTER Jones however being,
as the Catalogue informs us, aged only five,
no doubt enjoys the privilege of using as a
studio his elder sister's dressing-room, and
his tender years prevent him from seeing
cause to shrink #. revealing what he

which appears to us to show that they have re-
cently been twiddled; and judging from the look
of their protuberant exuberance, we should say
the greatest pains had been taken with their
growth.
Very few landscapes have been sent to be
exhibited; but in animal as well as architectural
depiction, the very early masters have come out

the same in their design, every house having a window on each side of
the door, and all the chimneys being stuck just in the middle of the
roof. ith the animal painters too there is a like sameness of subject.
Fully nineteen out of twenty of them have painted, nothing else but
| horses, nearly all of which are taken in precisely the same attitude,
the legs being all of them extended to the utmost, and a fly-away
appearance being given to the tails. There is a woodenness, moreover,
and a stiffness in the drawings which inclines us to believe that the
young masters in this school are content to use their rocking-horses in
|. #. of living models, and do not as a rule pursue their studies from
the life.
Reverting to the figure pictures, we select for special mention No. 84.
This work of art is ..". the Catalogue, John
Thomas, and may be viewed as a fine specimen of
the domestic school. The attitude is clearly formed
from the best models, and shows a power of ob-
servation which, we think, reflects great credit on
the artist. From the adjunct of the supper tray,
we are led to think the artist is of somewhat
ripened years, and has had entrance in the holi-
days to some country “evening party,” where
stale sandwiches and negus are still handed as
ºlments ” between the polkas and quad-
rllies.
No. 99 is a still more ambitious picture, and is noticeable as being
the only work exhibited in which there is more than one figure repre-
sented, and anything like composition is in any way aspired to. The
incident depicted is one with which most children are probably familiar,
and which the youthful artist no doubt studied from the life. Any one
who has frequented any of our Parks
must have seen perambulators stopped
by the military, and their wretched
little inmates left to swelter in the
sun, while the nursemaid and the
soldier interchange their loving
WOWs.
We have only now to add, that this
Fine Art Exhibition will be opened
in a day or two, we believe, indeed,
as soon as the admission fee is fixed.
Much anxious discussion has been
- held upon this point, it being of
course desired that, for the interests of Art, the Exhibition should be
popular, and it being of course also wished that it should pay. As far
as we can learn, the Committee seemed inclined to fix a penny as the
price of a single entrance, ticket, and, we believe a week's admission
will be guaranteed for sixpence. These prices, it is reckoned, will
defray all the expenses of string, gum, paste, and tin tacks, and other
costs incurred in the hanging of the pictures; while the surplus (if any)
will be spent by the Committee in the purchase of tops, marbles, brandy-
* and lollipops, and similar incentives to the progress of High
A Venial Offence.

whose case the Bishop of Oxford is about to issue a commission of
inquiry, is the “suffering the reading-desk to be desecrated by a number
of bricks being placed there.” We should rather have thought the
ºffending Vicar's congregation, would have been, thankful to have a
“brick” in the pulpit, considering how sadly familiar one is with
“sticks” in the same position. Besides, how can the Bishop of
Oxford object to bricks in the pulpit, considering that, whenever he
preaches himself, there is a whole pillar of the Church there?

They memorialise the Quees to have the old English
words taken out of the Prayer-Book, and doubtless would

is “obsolete.” A writer in the Illustrated News remarks
that the next attack will be upon our other old books, and
that we may have “to tremble for the Book, for our

our terrors for the last-mentioned case. As for the Prayer-
Book, there was an old gold Wind-Bag called Goethe, who
protested º: the plain ºf: of the º as
coarse; and who, for instance, wished the command which
specially condemns Pope Pius, changed into “ Thou
really oughtest not to raise thine hand in anger inst
any fellow-being.” The old cold man's maunderings found
no acceptation. We do not expect that any of the 450
delicate parsons will have the inquiry in the matrimonial
service, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this
man” transferred into, “May I inquire from whose charge
this, amiable [young] lady, is to be transferred to that of

HOW SCHAMYL WAS CAUGHT.
THE translations which the newspapers have given of the Russian
commander's despatch, in which he describes the taking of SchAMYL,
are all incorrect. It is extremely unfair that the invariable veracity of
the Russians should be thus perverted. We have taken pains to
re-translate the account, which, as given below, tallies, as will be seen,
with the general impression in St. Petersburg as to the mode in which
the valiant Circassian was captured:—
“To His Imperial Majesty the EMPEROR OF ALL THE RUssIAs.
“SIRE,--I am happy to inform your Majesty that the arch rebel
Schamyū is, in my power; but I must add that he has been dearly
bought, by the sacrifice of many of the images, if not of Providence, of
yoh, Majesty, which is the same thing.
Qn discovering that he was in a certain fortress, which I had thought
would be his refuge, I instantly made an advance; and, in fact, I
advanced twenty thousand rubles to the commanders of the outposts.
§. one of those visitations ºf Providence which always overtake your
ajesty's enemies, these officers were, that very night, miraculously
stricken with deafness and blindness, so that we passed their positions
undiscovered. .
“l then determined to surprise the sentinels, and your Majesty can
hardly imagine their surprise when a volley of silver rubles was fire
with unerring aim into their pockets. Under that effective fire they
rapidly succumbed, and left the ground free to your Majesty's victo-
rious troops.
“The more delicate operation of forcing the gates without alarming
the garrison had then to be attempted, and it was difficult; but what
are difficulties in the way of soldiers who are doing your *:::::
ls
work? The resources of military science enabled me to achieve t
object; and by the employment of keys made of the best silver, the
gatº swung open without noise, and the day was our own.
“Having ascertained the house in º the brave but misguided
Circassian chieftain was hidden, I instantly directed a charge; and
your Majesty will find that charge, to the amount of 200,000 rubles,
âuly entered in the accounts of the army. Everything went down
before us, including the bars of the door of SºHAMy!'s house, and in
a few moments the redoubted chief was your Majesty's prisoner.
*Thus was gained a great victory by your Majesty's arms, as they
appear, upon the reverse of your Majesty's coins... -
‘Where all behaved so well, it were almost invidious to point out any
one for distinction, but I must venture to recommend to your Majesty's
august notice the gallant CoLoREL DIppleDorr, whose adroit

The King. My lamented father had the honour—as I learn by a
memorandum in his Hours—of sending some few bottles to meet your
Holiness on a certain return to Rome in April, 1850. Was it then that
the flavour was so agreeable to your Holiness?
The Pope. Ah! The wine was welcome-more so, perhaps, than a
few French friends who did me the kindness to taste it. But this is a
world of misery, sorrow, and wretchedness, and was intended to be so,
as is affectingly observed by that Irish Archbishop whose barbarous
name ever escapes me. To your health, my son, and may you tread in

MONCKTON MILNES ON THE MAINE LAW.
HERE is a secular cant,
as well as a religious
cant. . For example,
lecturing philanthro-
pists, are constantly
ascribing the crime of
the country chiefly to
drink. At the Social
Science Congress at
Bradford, the other
day, MR. Monckton
MILNEs, in refutation
of this particularcant,
honestly said, -
“Itap to me, how-
ever, to be asserted with-
out sufficient foundation,
that the crime of any
country is mainly de-
pendent on the con-
sumption of intoxicating
drinks, and that the
higher morality of man-
kind mainly depends on
abstinence from this gra-
tification."
What moral nations
the Mahometans
ought to be, – tee-
totallers of twelve
centuries standing
What an innocent
race ought thin pota:
--- tions to have rendered
A set of would-be censors of British manners and customs are still
our mild Hindoos! - - - -
plotting and contriving the introduction of the Maine Law, so as to prevent a man without a
cellar from getting a glass of ale. On this project of those pedantic busy-bodies, again hear
Monckton MILNEs:—
“I feel, however, that whatever we do in this matter, we must do it fairly between all these classes.
must not leave me and my LoRD BRough AM our claret and our sherry, and, in the words of the old song—
“Rob the poor man of his beer.”
“You must not allow to us all the comforts and socialities of life, and deprive the artisan of the locality
which is his club and his soirée, and that before you have built him a decent house to go to, or taught his
wife to dress his supper. Beware of the patronising benevolence which would debar the working classes
from all gaiety of heart and manners except such as your refinement of taste may appreciate, and rather
endeavour to raise their standard of pleasure than to restrict their present enjoyments."
You
Yes, you iniquitous Pumps, if you are to have a just Maine Law, you must pass an Act
to prohibit the importation of Port, Claret, Burgundy, Champagne, Cognac, Schiedam, and
every other description of wine and spirit. Perhaps you will maintain that the infamous
bribery and corruption which have just been brought home to so many ... gentlemen,
were owing to the “fermented beverages” which they are used to indulge in. But what
if there is a votary of temperance among the ºriº. Why, then you will ignore
him, as you do {{. Turks and the Brahmins. If common thieves became thieves from
addicting themselves to beer, of course uncommon thieves, such as criminal bankers and
embezzling trustees, began to deviate from the path of rectitude in consequence of taking
their glass of sherry. f. you will assert that they did.
A M. Law is a law for schoolboys. Its advocates are a set of would-be self constituted
pedagogues to the grown population. . They want to shut the public-houses against the
public, as though the public wore pinafores. Perhaps these disciplinarians would, if they
could, make the public wear pinafores. Perhaps they desire to persuade the naughty people
to allow themselves to be occasionally hoisted, and receive wholesome correction from the
hands of their amateur preceptors with a switch. People, indeed, who are capable of
allowing themselves to be subject to childish restraints may well be expected to submit to
the chastisement of children. Anyhow, they deserve to be whipped. Liberty for ever!
even, the liberty to get drunk. here there is no freedom there is no virtue; where men
are disabled from drinking there is no sobriety. Keep brandy out of the reach of infants;
lock it up in lunatic asylums. But desist, O ye Pumps, from urging, Society to allow you
to put it in a strait-waistcoat, and a high chair and a slobbering bib. If you cannot be
quiet, go the whole Pump, and clamour for a law which will not only close the pot-house, but
prevent you from fuddling yourselves in your own apartments.
A Volume of Sentences.
It seems that Big Ben is to be cut into four pieces, so as to let him down easy. We
should be more gentle in the blows we inflict on this fallen favourite, though we suppose it
is in human nature to strike one who has been so immeasurably above us all. We think
sufficient punishment has already been passed upon poor Ben, for not only has he
been beaten, hung, and drawn, but now |. is to be quartered; and we actually had the
cruelty to make him ring his own death-knell as well. In fact, its life may be compared
to a set of the Newgate Calendar, for it has been nothing but a series of trials that
. volume upon volume of “sentences; ” every one of which has been carried into
execution.
THE CABMAN’S PROGRESS.
“Much remains for us to do, but the advance of edu-
cation is certainly very marked. Classes once illiterate
now show a love of literature, the taste for which indeed
has even reached our Cabmen, who in demeanour and
civility are not the men they were."—Social Science Speech,
October, 1859.
AIR-" She wore a Wreath of Roses.”
He wore a cape of oilskin
The night when first we met, .
And rather husky seemed his voice
With recent heavy wet;
His cab was of the shabbiest,
His horse mere skin and bone,
For cruelty to animals
No sentence then was known;
I saw he was a bruiser,
And timidly did bow,
To an estimate of distance
No court would sanction now.
A flashly painted Hansom
When next we met he drove,
And all his chums regarded him
As quite a nobby cove:
I never knew him condescend
To take his legal fare,
Save once, when hired to Highgate,
For “he wanted change of air:”
And though he drove as brisk a trade
As any cab in town,
I never heard him own that he
Had change for half-a-crown.
And once again I see that man,
No bully now is there,
He treats a lady civilly
And takes Sixpence for his fare:
His cab no more is windowless,
No longer “screw "-propelled,
As in the good old time when he
The reins of power held.
I see him as my fancy paints,
And some may live to see:
For ’tis the age of progress
E’en with cabmanity!
TYPES OF LONGEVITY AND DISEASE.
THE great difference between the French and
English Press is avertissemens and advertise-
ments. By apertissemens the one dies, --by
advertisements the other lives. ...You may call it
a question of life and death. The only warning
that an English newspaper needs is the fact of
its circulation becoming less, and less every
week; it then knows that it is gradually sink-
ing. The French government adopts, with
regard to the Press, the system vulgarly attri-
buted to apoplexy—it generally gives three
warnings, and then the life of the poor patient
is suspended. . The organs of the English Press
are full of health and vitality, whereas the life of
the French Press hangs upon a mere thread, that
can be cut short by the scissors of the Censor
at a moment's notice.
Square and Compass.
It is perfectly right and proper for labourers
to combine in order to obtain a fair day's wages
for a fair day's work; but any masons who will
suffer themselves to be bullied by other workmen
out of working on their own terms for whom-
soever they please, are at any rate no Free-
maSOIls.
BALM For BLUE-StockINGs.-Beauty is a
great thing, but Learning is better. In the esti:
mation of the ancients, even, the Muses counted
for three times as much as the Graces.

Sept. 8, 1859. RALPH BüchAN, Hon. Seo.
“Fools” have been truly said to be “the game that knaves pursue; ”
but the sportsmen have usually to go and hunt the game up. In the
case of the London Homoepathic Hospital Medical School, however,
the game forms itself into a preserve, and invites the sportsman. The
subscribers to that institution will of course, employ, as their medical
attendants, those practitioners whom they will have chosen to lecture
on the various homoeopathic humbugs assuming the name of medical
sciences. The proposed lectures present some. !. on, which a
loquacious impostor might enlarge, to the great edification of his crazed
. credulous audience. For instance, he might expatiate on the
infinite divisibility of the materia medica, and the atomic theory and
ractice of medicine. “Surgery, as modified by homoeopathy,” would
a very interesting theme; particularly if the lecturer could make out
the amputation of a limb to |. practicable with an infinitesimal knife.
The treatment of some diseases of children, such as headache and belly-
ache, by infinitesimal doses of something like pastry and unripe fruit,
would also form, a very suitable subject for ingenious and delusive
eloquence. Much speaking would be required, and some will think,
. naturally be expected, from º: lecturers; otherwise the
"hours” which were to be advertised should be seconds, and in
further conformity with the minute medical philosophy, the “terms”
also remaining for announcement might be farthings, if the lectures
were likely to be worth so much money.
PUSEYISM.–The game is not worth its scandal.
GROSS ILLTREATMENT OF A GREAT PUBLIC
BENEFACTOR.
MR. WICE-CHANCELLOR SIR. W. PAGE Wood, may be a very great
lawyer, but he is not the first great lawyer who has ..";
down a bear, and a short-sighted bear into the bargain. Mr. Punch
hopes his readers will agree with him, that SIR. W. P. Wood deserved
that title, when he ventured in his paper on Charitable Trusts, read
before the Social Science Association at Bradford, to give, as an
example of what he calls “absurd and preposterous bequests,” the case
of a testator “who divided his estate into two portions, one to be given
to the fifteen prettiest young women in the parish, who were most
constant in their attendance at church; and the other to the spinsters
of fifty years of age, possessing the same qualifications.”
Absurd and preposterous, indeed! Mr. Punch would be glad to
know how many testators make half as good a use of their money. Does
SIR. W. P. Wood think it no benefit to society to encourage the growth
of pretty girls, and their attendance at church? If so, Mr. Punch begs
to differ from him toto coelo, and devoutly to put up his prayer for just
such a testator in every parish in England. And don’t let us be told
that leaving a nice little round sum to be distributed every year to the
fifteen prettiest girls in a place wouldn't encourage the breed. Don't
we see the agricultural societies, and the poultrycultural societies, and
the horticultural societies, and the societies for the culture of rabbits,
and canary-birds, and a thousand other things, going just the same way
to work to develope the growth of gigantic turnips, fat pigs, and sheep
and cattle, lop-ears of preternatural ugliness, mottled mules, bright
golds, gigantic gooseberries, Brobdignagian grapes, and so forth P And
can't we all speak from experience to the fact, that the prizes and the
medals these associations offer do develope the thing to be rewarded,
whether it be flavour or monstrosity in fruit and vegetables, ugliness in
º, song and colour in canary-birds, or pinguitude in beasts of the
el
Let us then consider SIR. W. P. Wood’s “absurd and preposterous
testator,” as simply the founder of a “PulchrſtudiculturAL Asso-
CIATION,” in his native parish; or, if you want the English change for
such a very large piece of Latin coinage (almost as bad as the name of
the Sociological Association itself), take it as “an association for the
cultivation of pretty girls;” an association, too, which, instead of a
paltry medal, or a twopenny-halfpenny £5 prize, holds out the fifteenth
share in a comfortable rent-roll—a reward as superior to the usual
trumpery tokens of honour, as a pretty girl is above a prize pig or a
sº cabbage.
ote, too (as MR. RUSKIN would say), that this admirable bene-
factor of his species seeks to cultivate the growth not only of prettiness,
but of godliness with it, to say nothing of his supplemental bequest
for the fifteen fifty-year-old spinsters, who have best preserved their
good looks and church-going habits. Really, the more one thinks of
it, the more one is inclined to consider the man must have been one of
our greatest and profoundest social reformers, one who deserves to
be considered, in respect to women, what Fisher Hobbs is to pigs, or
MR, HUxTABLE to turnips.
Observe, he has gone in for encouraging spinsters at once in respect
for their own good looks and regard for religious observances. He has
thus hit the ..". blot of the elderly female character, its tendency to
separate, good looks, from, good works and ways, as though devotion
were only compatible with dowdiness, and piety inseparable from a
poke bonnet and a sharp face under it.
An absurd and preposterous bequest |! Positively, the more we
revolve the matter, the more we feel inclined to say to everybody who
has a fortune to leave (and is not disposed to leave it to Mr. Punch),
“Go thou, and do likewise.” Mr. Punch is not at all sure that he may
not leave his own colossal estate to found just such an association in
eyery parish in England. What an idea to hug on one's death-bed,
that one had laid the seed of generations of pious and pretty girls, and
pious and pretty old women, for grey hairs well worn have their own
charm; that one had helped the dowries of the one, and lightened the
loneliness of the others; that one had brought the flush of pleasure
into so many sweet young faces, and heightened the glow of so many
lovely and º; eyes; not forgetting #. sadder, but not less sweet

THE PIERIAN SPRINGS AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
THE Trustees of the British Museum are erecting drinking-fountains
in the hybrid-looking portico in front of the building. This is in itself
º no means a bad move; but it would be still better if º were to
allow the stream of their benevolence to flow a little more freely in-
side the house. The underpaid officials there, like scantily watered
plants, present, a remarkably, dry appearance, and even a moderate
shower in the shape of an addition to their present low salaries, would
no doubt considerably refresh them.
MR. GLADSTONE, SIR. G. C. LEwis, and several of the Trustees are
classical scholars, and although we cannot expect them to “come down”
like Jupiter did to Danaë in a “torrent of gold,” yet º might recol-
lect the Virgilian maxim, “Nunquam prudentibus imber obfuit; ” which
being freely translated may mean, “prudent men do not ever object to
a shower”—in the shape of an addition to their salaries. Now, the
gentlemen employed at the Museum are, we F. “prudent men,”
and they certainly deserve such a shower in the shape of salaries as may
enable them to maintain a decent and respectable, if not a luxurious,
position in life. PINDAR, indeed, says, “piazov uty tºwp, and no doubt
water is a very excellent thing in its way; but even water does not
wash out the duty of remunerating gentlemen of ability and high
education in proportion to the time and talent which they expend in
the public service, even although, as MR. GLADSTONE argued in the
House of Commons, “their duties are in some degree congenial to
their tastes.” Does the i. honourable gentleman think his salary
as Chancellor of the Exchequer too high or does he dislike his
position so much as to receive a handsome douceur for occupying it?
An Aid to Rogers' Recollection.
CHARLEs JAMEs Fox was coming out of the Thatched House Tavern

A LONG LIFE, AND ANYTHING BUT A MERRY ONE.
At a banquet given by the MARCHIONEss of LoNDoNDERRY to her
tenants at Carnlough, the farmer who proposed his good “landlady's .
health, coupled it with the wish, “May she live a thousand years.”
This wish may have been kindly meant, but we are afraid it is almost
incapable of realisation; especially when we recollect, that no woman
was ever yet known to live, at the very outside, beyond the age of
thirty-nine. We believe there was only one exception ever known,
but then she was an annuitant. Nor do we think that many ladies
would care about ...}. the gift, supposing the offer was made to
them. What lady would have the courage to look at herself in the
glass, when she was five hundred years old * and what chance would
there be of her procuring a husband when she was advancing towards
her 900th birthday? She would always be condemned to marry a
husband infinitely younger than herself; and we all know, that such
matches never turn out well. Moreover, it would never be possible
for her to conceal her age, and to woman what charm has life if she
cannot, resort to that little amiable deceit, which after all, to speak
charitably, is resorted to more to cheat herself than others. “To live
a thousand years” would, instead of a blessing, turn out a bitter curse,
which the fair possessor of the gift would infal ibly regret more and more
every day of her tedious existence. Fancy what an unapproachable old
bore the best woman in the world would be, when she was touching
her 999th year; nor can we fancy she would look very pretty at that
age! . The picture is too hideous to contemplate—so let us throw a veil
over it. No, the good Marchioness deserves a better reward than the
above, and that is, to live, in the grateful memories of those she has
made happy and comfortable on her estates, for several long bright
years to come.

§runel, DIED SEPTEMBER, 1859.
Stephenson, DIED OCTOBER, 1859.
A NATION’s Pioneers—they rest. To mock
Renown like theirs with sculptured tomb were shame:
Where the bridged chasm, or where the pierced rock
Attests mind’s victory, read each hero-name.
Yet in an epitaph their names shall live,
That Silence, there, may pay one noble due:
THEY DIED UNTITLED. Of what Courts can give,
No jot, O knaves and fools, they grudged to you.
NEW LITERARY ENTERTAINMENT.
IT delights us to announce, that the amateur dramatic writer, MR.
Slow EcoCHE, intends shortly to commence a series of readings from
some of his rejected five-act tragic works. MR. SLow EcoCHE, as hi
friends are pretty well aware, has been for some time in the habit of
indulging private audiences with recitals from his writings, and has
always been in readiness to read for any charity, whenever any of his
friends have had the charity to listen to him. By so doing, he has
sacrificed some portion of his time, and has caused still greater sacri-
fices of the patience of his hearers: and as the limit of endurance has
in either case been reached, MR. Slow ecoche feels that either he
must henceforth altogether give up reading, or seek in public the
attention which in private is denied him. t-
Believing in his power to read as well as write, MR. SLOWEcoCHE
has decided, and his friends think very wisely, to pursue the latter
course. The first reading will come off about the middle of next week,
and will consist of the first act of The Plebeian's Grandmother, a tragedy
composed on the Elizabethan model, and which for its exceeding
blankness, both of verse and plot, has secured for its author a very
high position in his own opinion. The remaining four acts will sub-
sequently be read, an entire unbroken evening being occupied by each;
and on his next appearance MR. SLow Ecoch E Wii diversify his (so
called) Entertainment, by reading some choice specimens of his
less ambitious style. These will comprise works of the Victorian
school. That is, pieces written for production at the “Wic,” but
which, owing he believes to the foul machinations of a literary clique,
have never been allowed as yet to see the footlights. The catalogue of
these rejected unread dramas is very far too long for us to publish in
extenso. But to show what a rich treat the admirers of MR. SLOWE-
Coche have before them, we may mention that the list of pieces chosen
for his readings, will comprise no less than twenty of the heaviest of
his “heavies.” Among them will be read his intensely thrilling
drama, called The Haunted Cemetery; or the Ghoul and the Ghost
which will probably be followed by a piece of painful interest, entitled
very suitably, The Revenge of the Revolter; or the Warwhoop in the
Wilderness. We are delighted, too, at seeing among the chosen pieces
that horribly exciting, and uncommonly blue-fiery one, which was
expressly penned for MR. N. T. Hicks, but was (for reasons before
stated) never acted by that gentleman. The startling name of this
;..." drama is, Ferdinand the Fleacatcher; or the Doom of the Demon
tºy.

YoUR kingdom is of this world, then, sire Pop E,
Since you and all your priests such wrath express,
'Gainst them who seek to ease your Holiness
Of temporal cares—and will succeed, we hope;
For then the Italian mind will win free scope,
And liberty of pulpit and of press,
That truth with falsehood may have leave to cope.
Then law and order Italy will bless!
That desperate clutch of earthly majesty
Doth scanty logic on your part evince.
See you what diadem your brow adorns?
If ºthis world the papal kingdom be,
The Vicar are you not of this world's Prince?
So then, if you are wise—draw in your horns.
INDIA UNDER THE INCOME-TAX.
INDIA is about to realise the advantage of sharing with England
equality under government. In our Eastern empire is about to be
introduced a measure for “taxing trades and professions.” The bless-
ing of schedule D–under protest from the Calcutta Chamber of Com-
merce—is to be conferred on our Indian fellow-subjects. This is a
very promising financial experiment. The celebrated truthfulness of
the Indian character will insure the minutest accuracy in all the
Income-tax returns which will be made by the scrupulous natives.
But the correctness of these statements will have to be taken for
granted. No tax could be more popular with our Oriental brethren
than one which will allow them to tax themselves. A generous con-
fidence in their probity will be repaid; but there must be no hesitation
in taking the payment, then all will be well, but not otherwise.
Beware of assessing them at a higher rate than their own; otherwise
the effect which Schedule D will have on the industrious masses of
India will be too likely to resemble that which the greased cartridges
produced on the Sepoys.

The waves were º drowsily alongside of the pier, and p

the resonant and raucous strains of a brass-band, stationed for some subtle reason close

listeners of Cornopean-haunted Pimlico, or
Trombone-bemaddened Bayswater.
At such a time and place, what wonder

“Why, MARLAN, my pet, what a rummy thing

her HENRY’s manly bosom, and resuming a more
Christian and less Christy form of utterance,
“Can your Authorship inform me when the wave
which is now passing us may be said to have

stop his ears: but, like the “lissome Wirien,”
the fair one “clung and clasped his hand,” and

HUNTING THE BLACK BADGER.
MR. PUNCH's affection for the Undertaker is proverbial. The love
and respect he entertains for the cringing, but greedy fellow, who in
the hour of sorrow avails himself of our indisposition to contest details,
and secures a .# order for his extortionate mummeries, exceeds in
degree, but is closely akin, to Mr. Punch's regard for the greasy, spirit-
drinking, whispering hirelings who assemble in unclean knots at the
bidding of the Supreme Ghoul, and help him to get up the abomination
called a Genteel Funeral. Hence, when a wise man, or woman (like
the late excellent QUEEN ADELAIDE), leaves testamentary direction
that an Undertaker shall, in a certain instance, be choked off from all
plunder that can be saved from his dirty hands, Mr. Punch usually
expresses his respectful approbation. And when any other incident
occurs, calculated to cast contempt upon the vulgar and º: display
got up by the Carrion-Crow of Society, Mr. Punch is also well pleased,
What a future age will think of our toleration of such things, it is
hard to say. When cremation shall have superseded interment; when
no more
“The long funerals blacken all the way;”
when “ashes to ashes, dust to dust,” shall cease to be a falsehood in
the mouth of the priest,--and when Mors Janua Vitae shall be a living
thought in the minds of the |. instead of a hack motto for a hatch-
ment; why, a good many other desirable things will have occurred, if
DR. CUMMING's prognostication of the end of all things—“positively
the last time of the end of all things: N.B. Copy the address”—
should not precede such reforms. Meantime, the more contempt cast
upon the Undertaker and his craft, the better. - - -
Only in this sense—for Mr. Punch sees a good deal of an objection-
able character in certain proceedings he is about to mention—does he
peruse with any feeling of satisfaction a long paragraph from a Derby-
shire paper just received. The Undertaker's craft has been called into
exercise, it seems, in what is called honour, not of man, but of the
friend of man. At a place, whose name is that of the scoundrel attorney
in Guy Mannering, lives a person named ScHoles, recently the possessor
of a favourite hound, whose name was that given by old Cobb ETT to the
late SIR FRANCIs BURDETT. The animal's hunting propensities were
extraordinary; but every dog has its last day, and “Old Glory’s ”
demise took place the other night. Her owner was about to deposither
remains under an old pear-tree in his garden, but this very sensible
proceeding was prevented by “some of the old hunters of Glossop,”
who, unless their conduct was prompted by the laudable desire to
insult and degrade the Undertaker, may also be described as some of
the old idiots of Glossop, persons who never need be afraid of knocking
out their brains in the hunting-field. They insisted upon Old Glory's
being interred with funeral rites.
Let Derbyshire tell its own tale:–
“Information of the coming event was at once dispatched to different of the
country, and on Saturday last, about forty hounds from Chapel-en-le-Frith, Hayfield,
Millbrow, Mellor, Staleywood, and other places, assembled to accompany their
canine sister to her last resting-place. ‘Glory' was put into a coffin, which was covered
with red cloth, over which black braid was crossed, her head surrounded by a hare's skin,
and bedecked with flowers. Several of her own pups were in attendance, having
red ribbons round their necks, whilst the others had black ribbon; and every dog
was lead in a red leash. Funeral cards, bearing the following inscription, were given
to each of the invited mourners :-Sacred to the memory of Glory Scholes,” [Mr.
Punch would have withheld MR. Scholes's name, but for its º: annexed to that
of the lamented deceased] “who died, September 26th, 1859, in the thirteenth year
of her age, and was interred, October 1st, at Cownedge, near Glossop. She was the
mother of one hundred and seventy pups l
Farewell dear friends, a long farewell:
I've crossed these hills when I could almost fly,
I’ve been at the death of many a hare,
Though now I'm dead and lying here.”
The poetry is not much better than that of the º magazines
and newspapers, but it may not have occurred to the old hunters of
Glossop to look into Odyssey seventeen, for a Homeric epitaph on their
extinct friend. We will presume that they used the word “sacred” in
the classical sense, or, more likely, in no sense at all, like an Under-
taker. But let the rites proceed:—
“As the time of the funeral drew near, High Street was crowded with several
thousand spectators. The funeral car was drawn by a black horse, and in it were
seated MR CHARLEs WYATT, the driver; M.R. John Noble, master of the ceremonies;
and MR. GEorge Scholes, owner of the dead hound. The funeral procession started
about five o'clock in the afternoon, the master of the ceremonies blowing a funeral
dirge on his horn over the corpse, on which the canine mourners set up a sympa-
thetic howl. Several hundred persons followed the procession to Cownedge, a
distance of over four miles, where a vast crowd was waiting to see the last of poor
“Glory.” The horn was blown whilst the interment took place, after which MR.
Noble sung “Squire Frith,” and the multitude joined in the chorus. A requiem,

composed for the occasion by MR. BRUNDERETT, was also sung; and to conclude
the ceremony, three long and hearty cheers were given. The cortège then returned
to the Botanical Tavern, where a supper was provided, consisting of six enormous
pies. The invited guests paid the usual funeral gift, and spent a merry evening.”
What “the usual funeral gift” is, we do not know. The munera, or
dona, of the ancient Roman rites were, if we have not forgotten all DR.
SwishTAIL's teachings, things that the deceased used to like. The
bereaved Scholes is the kandlord of the tavern in question, but we can
hardly suppose that the guests pelted him with flesh of dead horses, or
with greaves; but rather that he made a jº thing of his loss in the
shape of the reckonings for his pies and other refreshments. This,
however, is his business, not ours.
But, reserving all other comment upon the whole business, Mr.
Punch would ask, who that witnessed this Genteel Camine Funeral will
ever be able to think gravely of the Undertaker and his mummeries and
his weepers, and his black bandages, and the rest of the rubbish with
which he robs the living in the name of the dead? Undertaking will
surely be a bad trade in Derbyshire, henceforth.
- en the Roman mourners returned from their simple and sensible
rites, DR. SwishTAIL used to tell us that by way of purification they
were made to step over a fire. In humble imitation of the Romans,
Mr. Punch has called the old idiots of Glossop over the coals, but he
has, goodnaturedly, not made them very hot, partly for a reason which
it might not be complimentary to state, and partly because the Glossop
tº: may be regarded as a quizz upon the British Ghoul or
nuertaker.
PUNCH ON PUNCH.
YESTERDAY, at an Association for the Advancement of Social Science,
Mr. Punch delivered a lecture on Punch. Mr. Punch said: In lecturing
on punch, a few of you will ºf: expect that I shall blow my own
trumpet. Nothing of the kind. I am not going to talk about myself,
but of the liquor which is my namesake. It is made with rum, brandy,
lemon, hot water, and sugar. I am speaking, and only intend speaking,
of punch proper; hot mixed punch: and shall º: the considera-
tion of other punches. The things I have named are the essential
constituents of punch. A little beer is sometimes added—advan-
tageously. Instead of mere hot water, tea is occasionally used; and
then your tea not only cheers, but also, if you take enough of it—or, as
LoRD BRough AM would say, too much of it—inebriates.
Put twice as much rum as brandy into the jug in which, and not
in a bowl, your fº 'should be made. The fault of most punch is
that brandy predominates in it. On the contrary rum should predomi-
nate. Rum, without any brandy at all, makes excellent punch. Mere
brandy punch is nasty stuff. Put in as much sugar as the water will
dissolve. . If you brew, say, a quart of punch, let it contain the juice
and the rind of one lemon. The juice, I say; not the pulp. The rind
also; not all the peel; none of the white pith: only the yellow out-
side pared off thin, so as to lay open the aromatic oil-cells. With
regard to the proportion of water you employ, let your own discretion
be your tutor. Some like strong punch; others weak, -ladies gene-
rally prefer weak. I prefer weak to smoke with. -
Don't put these things into your jug in the order in which I have
named them. Make your lemonade first. Mix your hot water, sugar,
and lemon. Let the water be boiling hot—fresh from the kettle on
the fire. If brought up from the kitchen, test it with a thermometer.
“It have a boiled, Sir,” is a maidservant's or charwoman's idea of an
affirmative answer to a question intended to ascertain if the tempera-
ture of the water she has come with is 212°.
Put in first your lemon juice and lemon-rind, º thereon your hot
water, put a wrapper consisting of a folded napkin over the mouth of
your jug, and lay a thick octavo or some other equivalent body, over
the mouth of that vessel, and let it stand for five minutes. Then add
the liquors. If it stands on the hoball the better, and better still if it
stands in the oven. In either of the two latter cases you not only
may, but will do well to, add the spirits before covering up the ".
because the heat they will be exposed to will, more than make up for
their cooling effect on the hot water, which, when themselves heated,
* will º in extracting the aroma of the lemon.
. To bake or stew punch without covering it in, is the act of an unen-
lightened savage, ignorant of the first principles of distillation, which
are familiar even to the Irish native.
Drink your punch from a wine-glass, pouring it thereinto from your
jug. It spoils the pleasure of drinking punch to ladle it out of a bowl
into a tumbler. In so doing you inevitably make a slop, which is offen;
sive to every orderly mind. #. was meant to stick to the ribs and

Horrid Attempt.
We have received a letter from a wretch, who, after pointing out
the fact that one of the horses that ran the other day at the Newmarket
Second of October Meeting was named Gallus, suggests the probabi-
lity that the animalin question was ridden with a halter!
A FATAL FACILITY,
THE EARL of SHAFTESBURY, in the magnificent address he delivered
at the opening of the Annual Meeting of the Association for the
Promotion of Social Science, tells us that “everything has a tendency
to run into abuse.” If examples were needed of this truth, we would
point to the religious newspapers, for you cannot look into a number
of the Tablet, or the Univers, or the Churchman, or the Record, without
instantly discovering that “its tendency is to run into abuse.” Take
abuse away from these papers, and you would have nothing but the
“imprint” left; and that is precisely the end, taking a leaf out of their
own book of charity, that we should like to see most of them arrive at.
A ROMAN MARTYROLOGIST.
. Our Roman Catholic contemporary, the Tableſ, contains the follow-
ing illustration of the position of the Pope in relation to Wicron
EMMANUEL and Louis NAPOLEoN :-
“The state of Italy must be satisfactory now to every liberal mind, for the con-
dition of the Holy See is a sad one. The Sovereign Pontiff is on the cross, and the
whole world is looking on, scoffing and jeering. The KING or SARDINLA represents the
impenitent thief, and nothwithstanding the perils of his own position, he finds time
to insult the innocent one, though he does not curse Pontius PiLATE who has
brought him to his evil case. The EMPERoa or THE FREnch looks calmly at his
work, and is satisfied.”
“Comparisons are odious,” says the old proverb. Does the Table?
want to get that ancient maxim enlarged, by giving occasion for the
new saying, that “Comparisons are impious?” “Pontius PILATE,” and
the “IMPENITENT THIER,” will probably be inclined by the above simi-
litudes to consider that “Comparisons are impudent.” It is lucky for
the Tablet that it does not publish profane articles under the govern-
ment of “Pontius PILATE,”—though that is not a procuratorship, but
an empire. Brother WEUILLot and the Univers have had a warning
for sedition, calumny, and falsehood. We suppose that the Tablet
would represent, M.M. WEUILLot and TAconet as stretched upon the
rack; those Catholic confessors thus undergoing a persecution in its
degree corresponding to the crucifixion of the Pope.
A Benison for Denison.
MR. DENIson, in the letter in which he endeavours to account for
the stoppage of the Westminster Bell, dates it from “Ben ºf.
To make the truth complete, the locality should have been described as
Big Ben Rhydding, for there can be no doubt that it is at MR. DENI-
son's door that the “Rhydding” of Big Ben lies.

OFF WITH HIS HEAD !—SO MUCH FOR
QUACKING 'EM |
A Good Story has been told of an Eastern executioner, who was so
expert in the handling of his scimetar that he could cut a culprit's
head off without the victim's knowing it. . As a proof of his dexterity,
could not be persuaded that their necks were really severed until, at
his suggestion, they tried to shake their heads, when, much to their
discomfiture, their heads all toppled off. - -
It certainly sounds startling to hear of persons living after they have
been beheaded; and although when we were young we heard it state
of KING CHARLEs that he was seen to walk, and talk, half an hour
after his head was cut off,” still we hardly think the statement, esta-
blishes the fact. Yet that persons do exist who have had their heads
off, has been stated, not indeed on medical authority, but on such
authority as is conceded to a quack...Merely altering a name, which
we have no desire to puff, we quote this narrative verbatim from the
Morning Chronicle:–
“Gullaway's PiLLs.-REMEDY for Disorders IN the HEAD.-MR. Newton.
druggist, Hull, states, in a letter to Professor: GULLAway, that MR. John WARE'
residing in stubbs Buildings, West Street, Hull, had been afflicted with giddiness
in the head, off and on, for the last twenty years. Though he tried many ...
remedies during that long period, he found little or no relief from them. Atlast he was
induced to try Gullaway's Pills, from hearing so many encomiums pºssed on their
virtues; and the consequence is, that he is now perfectly cured, and enjoys better
health than ever he did before.”
Marvellous as are the stories—in more than one sense stºries-
which have been told of the effects of these Yº...i* We
think that this surprising statement beats them by long chalks. At
the same time, however, we must own that, to our thinking, thºre is
more marvel in the malady than in the working of the cure. That 4
ºn should have existed with his head “off and on” for a period
extending so long as twenty years, seems to our mind, more astounding
than that he should now be having “better health” at its conclusion
than, as we are told, he has ever had before. What manner of health
a man could possibly enjoy throughout the twenty years that his head

POISON FOR BREAKFAST.
The enormous gooseberries and gigantic strawberries of
journalism are now over, and in come the monster turnips
and prodigious mushrooms. To notices of these last-named
productions are often adjoined tales of hºrrºr, calculated
to terrify their consumers, under the head of “Caution to
Mushroom-eaters.” These warnings would be much more
effectual if they contained some explanation of the nature
of the danger to which mushroom-eaters expose themselves.
We read of death from eating “horse-mushrooms.” . The
horse-mushroom has a bad name, and not a very good cha-
racter; it is said to disagree with those who eat it, and to
occasion colic, and symptoms of that sort; but we find it
represented in the newspapers as producing the effects of
a virulent poison, such, almost, as those of deadly night-
shade or monkshood. Many people, however, eat it with
rfect impunity. It is largely used in making ketchup.
otanists call it Agaricus erquisitus, as if it were peculiarly
choice. The horse-mushroom, by some accounts, is gene-
rally º to the common mushroom in France. The
French, indeed, eat horse, but that would be no reason
why they should eat horse-mushroom, if it were poisonous;
Therefore, if anybody wishes to commit suicide, he will
experience a disappointment should he take horse-mushroom.
by way of substitute for prussic acid.
“Caution to Mushroom-eaters” should be taken to be
addressed to all eaters of mushrooms, and, observe, of com-
mon mushrooms, and not of toadstools. There is no poi-
sonous toadstool so like a common mushroom as to be
liable to be mistaken for it by anybody but a maid-of-all-
work destitute of perceptive organs. Let Mushroom-
eaters beware of stale mushrooms. Mushrooms are ve
like meat, particularly in being subject to putrefaction, and,
when putrid, in being noxious. They are often exposed for
sale in a state which, if they were, meat, would subject
them to seizure and confiscation, and their vendors to fine.
If anybody wishes to kill himself, let him eat those mush:
rooms; but hydrocyanic acid is preferable.

was “off and on,” it surpasses our imaginative power to conjecture;
and we look upon the statement that the patient has been cured as an
assertion which is far less difficult to swallow. Indeed, the story is
like that of the much-advertised bad leg of “more than thirty-five years'
standing,” which the same “Professor” professes to have cured. In
this case, as in the other, the quack has weakened his narration by
coming it too strong. - -
That quack treatment should cure anything is incredible enough,
but the statement of the cure is not a tenth part so surprising as the
assertion that the leg had for so long a time been kept standing. The
best of legs would not bear standing longer than a day; and that a
bad one should have stood for five-and-thirty years is a statement so
preposterous that we doubt if even those who patronise the quack's
pills could have swallowed it.

on be one of those “whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders,”
we leave to more inquiring minds than ours to determine. In the

heads disconnected from their bodies, and to use them as their footballs

narrative they please; but for ourselves, we must confess, we place
quite as strong a faith in the tales of Mr. Gulliver, as we do in the
assertions of the story-telling quack, whom, as we don't wish to be
personal, we choose to nickname MR. GULLAWAY.

PICTORIAL WALLS AND WINDOWS.
Roman prows, armorial bearings, ripe fruit, º:
birds, allegorical figures, antique masks, ideal animals end-
ing in scrolls, and civic insignia, constitute the frescoes
which decorate the ceiling, now visible, of the Royal Ex-
change. Saving the civic devices, the place of these paintings
would be more suitably occupied by scenes of traffic and
commerce, with nothing more allegorical amongst them
than a figure of Business in modern costume, with a pen
behind his ear. It is a pity that frescoes are not always
calculated to serve by way of illustrations of the building
which they adorn, so as to signify its use and purpose.
St. sº said that pictures were the books of idiots,
that is, of idiots so to speak because of their ignorance;
and this is the ground on which the Roman Catholic priests
defend their general use of images; whereby their flocks
ought to feel flattered. Now there are many idiots of this
kind running about loose, different as to creed in every
respect except one, but all united in the predatory per-
suasion. They form the chief part of the attendants at
Police Offices, and Courts of Assize and Sessions; where
the fate of their companions trembles in the balance.
The interiors of our various halls of justice might be
richly frescoed to the advantageous instruction of this
troublesome class of persons. The windows also might
be stained with similar designs. Representations of the
various punishments which the law inflicts upon convicts
might adorn the walls, to the great edification of the
majority of their beholders. hat the crank is, what

AN UNATTACHED
COUPLE.
It has always seemed to us
that in the way of adver:
tising births and deaths and
marriages, people enter very
often into quite needless
particulars. In the matter
indeed of marriages, the
details which are given are,
like fashionable petticoats

only are the names of the
officiating clergyman, and
of his reverend assistants,
stated with all fulness, and
all their titles and endow-
ments mentioned with great
accuracy, and at no small
length, but we are often
favoured also with a préci

of them happen to possess

With regard to births and

this from the "imes of Tuesday week, where
the curious may find the names stated at full
length:—
“On the 16th inst., at Ll— the wife of LIEUT.-Col.

Although we have no knowledge whatever
of the L-'s, this painful revelation of their
conjugal unhappiness, quite took away our usual
relish for our breakfast; and as constant morning
readers of the Times, we must protest against
its publishing what may destroy our appetite.
We have quite enough private sorrows of our
own without being afflicted by those of other
. It is very sad to hear that the L–’s
are “unattached,” but we cannot see the good
of thus publicly parading this announcement of
the fact.

ITALY is recommended by some of her friends

scope for detail; still the public often gets by them an insight in
E. we are sure, has not the slightest wish to pry into.
THE GRAFFITI OF LONDON.
A Most interesting article—in fact, Mr. Punch may as well say (for
there is no false modesty about him, nor any real modesty neither) that
he wrote it himself—appears in the new number of the Edinburgh
Review, upon the Graffiti of Pompeii. The word (which has already
thrown the Wiscount into despair, and made MR, HADFIELD wish, as
he is remarking, that hauthors would honly write Hinglish), means the
Scribblings on the walls and other scribbling places. ow, as Mr.
Punch has recently declared, and will declare again, at the earliest
º”. the habit of scribbling on walls and the like is a vulgar
and snobbish one, but with his usual calm superiority to cavil, he
begs to say that what was done in Pompeii a great many years ago, and
what is being done in England now, are two matters, and if they were
not, who cares? He is exceedingly glad that in Pompeian days every-
body scribbled about, because, in the first place, the inscriptions throw
great light on ancient customs, and secondly because those writings
afforded him a reason for composing an interesting and beautiful
article, and receiving the cheque and thanks of Messrs. LoNGMAN
& Co. Therefore, let there be no impertinent remarks.
It occurred to Mr. Punch, while writing that fine paper, that when
that eternal New Zealander of iono MacAulay's gets of the broken
arch of London Bridge, pockets his sketches, and, comes pottering
about the ruined streets of the abandoned metropolis, SIR CANNIBAL
TAttoo, or whatever the gentleman's name may be, will discover in ex.
tinct London much the same sort of mural annotations as Mr. Punch,
DR. WoRDsworth, and their Italian friends found in Pompeii. It
next occurred to Mr. Punch, that SiR CANNIBAL. TATToo, when he gets
upon the electric wire and shoots back to his hotel in Solander Island,
will ponder over the London Graffiti much as Mr. Punch has done over
those of the buried city. And thirdly, it occurred to Mr. Punch, that
in the Polygamic Review, CCXXIV., may appear the following article,
which Mr. Punch hereby publishes a trifle in advance, and thereby
sells his Australian posterity.

Extremely interesting, in fact we may say howling news from the
Old Island. The indefatigable traveller and antiquary, SIR CANNIBAL
TATToo, presents us with a budget of treasures from the walls, doors,
windows, and other portions of ancient London. To the historian
these relics are invaluable, while to the general reader they are indis.
pensable. Not to detain our friends from the feast SIR CANNIBAL has
set before them, we hasten to offer the following particulars of his
discoveries.

called from its being the place of fashionable marriages, in the days, as
DRYDEN says,
“When one to one was cursedly confined,”
SIR CANNIBAL found inscribed BR GS S N A S (Briggs is an
Ass). Now who was BRIGGs? and who the bold Satirist who thus
unhesitatingly summed up his character in an epithet. We find no
mention of BRIGGs in any History of England, and are half inclined to
risk the idea that the name was given generically to the class of
pseudo-sportsmen and athletes depicted in the celebrated Leech
Cartoons, now in the Presidential Museum at Wellington. In the
same neighbourhood SIR. C. TATToo perceived written the well-known
NO P : PE: Y (No Paupery), which shows that even in those barba-
rous times people were beginning to see the absurdity of being poor
while anybody else had aught to be deprived of. The inscription
NO P : PERY occurs in numerous parts of Old London, º
near the churches founded by St. Pusey, which is a proof that the
alms given away by these imitators of Catholicism had failed to satisfy
the laudable ambition of the working classes for independence.
On a door near the New Gate of London, which was also the place
of execution,-for, by a fine conception, our ancestors thrust, the &
luting scene of death eactra maenia, or as far from the heart of the City
as possible,_SIR. C. TATToo found a rude representation of the instru-
ment of execution, the Gallows, and of a figure pendent therefrom.
Beneath was written MANNING. This was the work of an illiterate
person, and obviously was meant for Man Hung, such being the brief
heading which the newspapers of the day gave to an account of one
of the events common and ludicrous in those times, but which happily
are now of rare occurrence, and which plunge our Republic of Islands
into mourning when such an example has been necessary. A little
further, and on a piece of pavement, was clearly to be read I AM
STAR ING ; but what this means, or what the speaker was staring
at, we have at present no conception. It might, however, have been
the facetious answer to the celebrated British caution “Mind Your
Eye.” SIR. C. TATToo suggests that a letter has been dropped, and
that the word should be Starting. But what could such an ".
mean upon a pavement? The riddle must, we fear, remain unsolved,
in sacculo sacculorum.
In what was called the Temple, from the number of Hebrews (wor-
shippers in the old Temple ºp Jerusalem) resident there, and on the
ground at the entrance of a passage is written M ND T : E
PA I Nº. Of this SIR. C. TATtoo hardly knows what to make. Ma
we venture a guess? Is it Mind the Pain, and has a preceding wor
dropped, which was Merer? If so, we think we see a solution. The
Temple, as has been said, was famous for its Jews, who, again, were
the most celebrated dentists of old times, and who, all schoolboys w
remember, were sent for to draw the teeth of KING John, about 1666.
Well, was this inscription, like the Roman Salve, the address to visitors
to a Temple dentist? SIR. C. TATToo thinks that the last word was

At another point, and near what is said to have been the residence
of the London Mayors before their extirpation, is found a rich distich—

• N D Y O U R A D : “TY R. S.C.A .
This there is great difficulty in reading, and a difference of opinion
has arisen as to the filling up of the destroyed letters. The best
scholars, SIR. C. TATToo says, are inclined to this reading:-
*I am the Knife º the Astley
Handed] your J. A Dirty Rascal."
There is evidently some City legend or sarcasm conveyed in this
couplet. The place where it was found was the banquet-hall of the
Mayors, and probably some AstLEY, a negligent servant, is charged with
having presented to his master “your [Mayor?]” to cut his venzon a
knife wet with the flesh of ūrū. fish, the favourite luxury of those
demi-savages. But there is scope for a score of treatises on the
subject. The last word of the first line has been interpreted “Castle,”
and though we do not think this correct, it may have alluded to the
Elephant and Castle, the famous white-bait house which stood near the
Bank, and was frequented by its managers.
A pretty couplet, about which there is little mistake, records, on a
window-sill, that “My love Sal is a p . . . . . gal,” the defaced word
being no doubt “portly,” the Eºſi. girls, or gals, being celebrated
and admired for their fat. In another place is DO OUR.M. “THER

Farther on, SIR.C, TATToo found the place where peripatetic astro:
nomers exhibited their telescopes for hire; as on a wall, which would
have been an excellent resting-place for the instrument, is “Take a
Sight.” Even in those ºº:: Moon-railroads were known, the
view of the celestial bodies interested our foolish forefathers.
Finally, for we must bring our remarks to a close, SIR CANNIBAL
TATToo perceived upon the entablature of the west pediment of the
clerestory of the A., ruins the letters PUN OR EWE. Now,
what is “Pun, or Eve?” Is this one of those dark mysteries from
which it is in vain to seek to tear the veil? Is it a mystic shadowing
out of some old religion? Does it show the doubts which at that
period saturated the minds of all P Is Pun, or PAN, the heathen
principle of universal nature; and does Eve, typical of womanhood,
point at a more gracious faith, between which, perhaps, some young
and ardent monk in a cell of those old Westminster A., ruins knew
not how to choose? The inquiry is deeply interesting, aesthetically,
asthmatically, and exegetically. The foolish and jº conjecture
that the words were Punch for Ever, we mention but to dismiss with
contempt. Our forefathers, foolish as they were, had grand and mythic
º nor will we ce a dance of BAG o'NAILs over their
graves. Let us rather humbly address ourselves to discover their
meaning. Laborare est orare.
SIR CANNIBAL’s book is the most splendid, the most useful, the
most intellectual, the most graphic, the most fascinating, that has
appeared for several hours, and we cordially recomm it to our
readers of all colours.
GLASS-HOUSE MUTUAL ASSURANCE COMPANY.
THERE is this, great convenience which people enjoy who dwell in
lass houses: whatever may be their position, they always stand in a
avourable light; and however conspicuous may be their failings, they
are invariably overlooked. Till lately, however, there were no means
of insuring these elegant edifices against demolition, partial or entire,
and many upright occupiers were consequently bowed down by anxiety
for their frames. It is hard to be denied the cheerful recreation of
flinging pebbles at a friend's contiguous sky-light ; strong bonds are
necessary to restrain an eloquent householder. To secure these fragile
structures, a Company was started not long since, and from their
Report, just published, they seem to have had a profitable run. The
document contains some curious glass cases, where tenants have been
relieved from apprehended damage to their vitreous abodes. We have
only room for those of universal interest.
Miss PRIscILLA W- was engaged to a soi-disant Irish Captain of
Dragoons unattached, but who, on the appointed bridal morn, was
arrested by his tailor. The dreadful circumstance becoming known to
Miss EUPHEMIA G-, it was expected that perfectly legal proceed-
ings would have been taken by that energetic lady to send a small
missile through the polished front wall of her opposite neighbour.
Luckily, Miss W held a Policy in the Glass House Company, by
whom she was assured that she need be under no apprehension, as
Miss G– had recently accepted the offer of a stout, bejewelled,
bewigged, and bewiskered gentleman, who represented himself to be a
German Baron, but who had turned out to be a Chiropodist.
PERCH, a young and sanguine Stock-broker, having married a
middle-aged lady, with great expectations from her uncle, who held a
lucrative appointment as Receiver of an income riding over extensive
landed property in the north of England, discovered when too late that
her Uncle was a Toll-Gate Keeper on the Great North Road. Under
ordinary circumstances, his cousin GUDGEoN would have been delighted
by a rapid volley of small shot, to unsettle PERch’s transparent tiles.
PERch, however, had obtained an assurance from the Company that
GUDGEoN had been captured by an adventurous widow, whose late
husband was not SERJEANT PLUM of the South-Eastern Circuit, but
SERJEANT-MAJon HUMM of the 101st, with a life pension of one shilling
and three halfpence per diem. No damage was accordingly done on
either side.
MRs. Deputy J– having signally failed in her endeavonrs to ob-
tain vouchers for the High Polish Ball, was anticipating a hail-storm
from the democratic prejudices of Mas. DEPUTY K–, when the
Company on payment of a small premium, gave her an assurance that
her fears were groundless, MRs. #. — having been confined
to her couch, for three days after a Mansion House dinner, in con-
sequence of her inability to obtain a condescending smile from the
Persian ambassador. The threatened storm was according confined to
a thimble-full of homoeopathic balls.
The Misses Olivia and Flor ENCE E— having undergone great
mental agony through the behaviour of two impracticable donkeys on
Durdham Downs, were about to extort, from ToM, their wicked little
brother, a solemn undertaking not to divulge it to the Misses SARAH

Company that those young, ladies were under heavy recognisances to

flock of irascible geese on Peckham Rye. OLIVIA and FLORENCE con-

A NEW FAILING.
NE would have thought that SIR
Robert CARDEN would never have
been accused of “an excess of
good-nature.” However, Sir
Robert Cºpen confesses he was
imposed upon at Gloucester, and
attributes the imposition to his
excess of good-nature. Unques-
tionably t ood-nature must
have been nearly as capacious as
his pocket; for after having been
imposed upon at one election, he
s down and allows himself to
imposed upon at a second,-
a regular case of Double Glouces-
ter, and very strong Gloucester,
too ! No wonder that both his
pocket and his good-nature were
layed upon to the tune they were.
'as it all owing to good-nature,
or did SIR. Robert know the
market he was going to, and,
knowing what he had to buy, take
sufficient means with him for the
purchase ?
However, if SIRRoBERT CARDEN
as any good-nature in his compo-
sition, it will now be put severely to the test, as often as it is his
good-natured fate to listen to the remarks, or to read the couments,
that will be universally made upon those disgraceful revelations made
before the Gloucester Election Commissioners. He is greatly to be
itied. The martyr of his own goodness, his good-nature deserved a
tº: return than the base one he received at Gloucester. The
electors had no right to take in one so open-hearted and credulous to
the enormous extent they did. If any one was bribed, we should say
it was SIR. Robert himself. His simple, trusting nature, that parted
with money to any one who asked for it, was decidedly bribed by being
deceived by everybody. And yet look at the same man at the Mansion
House, º see how terribly severe he is upon any little girl who has
been caught begging for a penny ? The girl may be sentenced to six
weeks' imprisonment, but then, believe us, it is only SIR. Robert's
“excess of good-nature.”

A FEMALE BRIAREUS WANTED.
THERE are two employments, the one reserved for masculine, the
other kept exclusively for feminine aspirants, in which were a Briareus
one of º: employed, he would soon find his hundred hands full of the
duties that devolved on them. Not only are the persons filling these
positions required to devote their brains and bodies to the service, but
they find they have to be, as far as humanly is possible, ubiquity per-
sonified and coupled with omniscience. Of these two occupations, the
first is that of Special Correspondent to a newspaper, more especially
when travelling from camp to camp as ...; and the second
that of Governess to a large family of small children, such for instance
as that mentioned in the following advertisement:—
WANTEP, by a Lady residing about thirty miles from Manchester,
a daily Governess, accustomed to tuition, to educate nine children, all under
eleven years of age. She must be competent to instruct them in English, French,
Music, and Drawing. Salary, £100 a year. Apply, &c.
If these nine children be members of one and the same family, we
may assume that, inasmuch as they are all “under eleven,” one or two
of them can hardly be much more than three or four. Indeed we
probably should not be far wrong in presuming that the youngest of the
nine is not yet out of long clothes, and that the next has still the taste
of pap upon its palate. To “educate” a pupil of such tender age as
this appears to us a work more fitted for a Nursemaid thana Governess
and we think that for the words “accustomed to tuition” there should
have been inserted “used to rock a cradle.” It seems º: to
talk of “instructing” such mere babies in “English, French, and
Music,” to say nothing of “Drawing.” Simultaneously to teach an
infant French and English would be no easy thing to do before the
child has learnt to talk; and what instruction could be given it in
Music or in Drawing we must confess that it completely puzzles us to
uess. The music of the rattle is about the only music for which
abies show an ear; and we know no other instrument which they can
take a turn at, unless it is the handle of some older child’s harmonicon,
and this they are quite sure nine times in ten to break. Moreover, as
for trying to teach a baby drawing, wereally cannot see what advantage
would accrue from it. The only designs of which a baby's brain seems
capable, are designs upon Pa's watch-chain or the pulling of his
whiskers; and no good can result from teaching children drawing,
until they are competent to draw their own perambulators.
We have always had a horror of all infantine º: and we
º d, that, thanks to Punch, the growth of them had stopped. But
advertisement reminds us that the Blimber race is not yet utterly
extinct, and that there are still existing parents who delight to cram
their children with a surfeit of instruction, and weaken their young
minds by their efforts to digest it. If the lady above advertised were
allowed to have her way, she would doubtless fill her family so full of
education, that there would be no room, left for the growth of some-
thing better in them. Prematurely skilled in language and accomplish-
ments, they would thereby be stunted in the growth of those good
qualities, which by nature are implanted in every young brain, and
which are weakened if not killed by the noxious forcing system. For
her children's sake we therefore hope in all º: lady
will not get the governess she “wants” for them; and in spite of the
large salary she offers for the work, we doubt if any governess “accus-
tomed to tuition” would be ...; to perform it. Aspirants for the
place may, we rather think, depend, that something more than mere
tuition will be wanted for nine children, who are all under eleven.
Indeed, it seems to us quite certain, that whoever may consent to
undertake the situation, will find that in addition to her labours as a
Governess, she will be in some degree entrusted with the duties which
usually devolve upon a Maid-of-all-work.
“WHAT TO EAT, DRINK, AND AWOID.”
A Copy of this little book has been sent to PRINCE ALBERT, with
the compliments of one of the Members of the British Association. At
the same time, the hope was expressed that the next time the Associa-
tion pays Balmoral a visit, the Members may be allowed their free
choice of the three occupations, and not be restricted, as they were on
the last occasion, sim ly to the third, and that the least inviting, viz.:-
“What to Avoid.” We can only say that the remedy is a very simple
one, and is in the Association's own hands. Since it was puzzled to
know “What to Eat?” or “Drink?” the next best thing is to ascer-
tain “What to Avoid?” and the answer is plain enough-Balmoral.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
VISIBLE ORATORY.
EveR anxious as we are to promote the peace of mind and happiness
of everybody, and do our utmost to remove the nuisances which worry
them, it delights us to announce that, we have hit upon a plan by
which perhaps the greatest bore in England may be extirpated. We
allude, as the intelligent of course will have surmised, to the nuisance
of political and other public speaking. Any reasonable mode by which
the parliamentary debates may be contracted, and orators in general be
induced to “cut it short,” must certainly be deemed a boon and
º to the nation; and this it is now happily within our power to
conter.
We propose then, that in future all our public speakers (with the
exception of LoRD Brough an and somethree others worth the listening
to) shall when they get upon their legs in St. Stephens or elsewhere,
have permission only to express º by pantomime., Like
MENDElssohn's delicious Lieder ohne Worte, public speeches shall be
henceforth speeches without words. In Parliament or out of it, with
the exception we have mentioned, any orator who wishes to express
his sentiments, must submit to have his tongue tied, or else to wear a
silence-cap to prevent untoward utterance, the Cuffia di Silenzio,
invented for KING BoMBA, shall be kept in every room where public
speaking is permitted. Not to be confounded with an instrument of
torture, the head-piece shall be called the Cap of Maintenance of
Peace... In either house of Parliament muscular debates shall be the
order of the day, and, in sittings after nightfall, the order of the night.
The only, oratory suffered shall be Visible Oratory. “No speaking
aloud” shall be the first rule of the Speaker. Any rising Member
will be ordered to sit down if a syllable escapes him. No matter who
is on his legs, if he says but half a word he will at once have to get off
them. ... He must address himself in speaking to the eye and not the
ear. To be visible, not audible, must limit his ambition.
There may be a question with weakly-minded people, and perhaps still
more a doubt with weakly-bodied ones, whether the suggestions we have
made can be adopted, seeing that most orators would find it too exhaus-
tive for them. It might be argued, and with certainly some slight show
of reason, that few gentlemen of England who dine at home at ease, and
by dint of their good living can scarcely see their knees, would be able
to sustain a leading part in a debate, where the only mode of argument
was physical exertion. There are, doubtless, many orators of great
weight in the House who would soon be overcome in a muscular
debate, and find themselves unequal to much pantomimic speaking.
We know several standing, counsel who would soon have to sit down,
if bodily contortions were their only mode of utterance. Were, visible
oratory the rule at public meetings, speakers even with full heads
could never make much use of them, the while they had full habits.
Their pinguitude, of course, would put a stopper on their panto:
mime, and they would always have to give in to their slimmer-limbed
antagonists.
A few words will, however, serve to answer these objections. When
surplus fat is found to be an obstacle to oratory, there are abundant
means at hand to lessen or remove it. § simply taking exercise and
altering his diet, a Daniel Lambert who aspires to come out as a
Demosthenes, may in a month or two, at most, attain the height of
his ambition. Until he makes the effort, he scarcely would believe what
wonders may be worked by a #. course of training. Total
abstinence from turtle and the like enriching condiments, and a regu-
lation diet of unvarying cold mutton, would do marvels in reducing his
rotundity of body, and bring him down with speed into good speaking
condition.
Moreover, some degree of latitude might in fairness be accorded
to... such overburdened orators, as a balance to the weight of
solid flesh they labour under. It would be easy to devise a sliding.
scale of bºilº, to be allowed them in proportion to their
surplus ponderosity. For every half stone or so beyond a certain
weight, an extra thirty seconds might be º given them.
They would thus be relieved from undue pressure on their lungs, and
be placed more on a footing with their leaner-bodied rivals.
... So, few public speakers now-a-days say anything worth hearing, that
it will be no great loss to any one if they are stopped from saying any:
thing at all. On the contrary, indeed, we think that our suggestion, if
rightly carried out, will occasion no small gain to our countrymen in
general. So much time now is wasted in reading stupid speeches,
which, for want of something better get stuck into the newspapers,
that the º of such waste would be a national advantage, in
the benefit of which all Great (and little) (Britons to a certainty would
share. If the Times were daily published without a single speech in it
how many persons would be spared the task of useless reading, an
what a saving there would therein be of unproductive labour. Reports
of visible orations might always be confined to half a dozen sentences,
by which some notion of the pantomime might be sufficiently con:
veyed. Let the meditative mind but consider what time-saving this
would nationally occasion, and the meditative mind will very probably
agree with us, in determining that we who are the authors of the
notion will certainly thereby have done the State great service, and
will deserve a no small public recognition of the fact.
Admitting our deserts, we, however, must decline to have them
nationally recognised. festimonials and statues are now the only
methods of rewarding public merit, and these have grown so common
that, anybody anywhere may have them for the asking. However
vastly §. ore we may benefit our country, we trust that nobody will
publicly take notice of the fact; for as we have little wish to rank
among the Anybodies, we mean to keep ourselves from being buttered
or bestatued, however great the risk we weekly run of being so.
FREEDOM FOR THE POPISH PRESS,
My Ally and big Brother, NApoleon THE THIRD,
Why silence the Ultramontanes?
Let them say what they please; let them print every word:
We owe them great thanks for their pains.
Would you hinder the viper from hissing, and lack
The hint to beware of its trail?
Or stifle the howling of wolves on your track?
Let the friars and Jesuits rail!
Leº tigers grin wide as they please; let them show
Their fangs; let them growl; it is good.
Their sweet dispositions they thus let us know,'
And what they would do if they could.
If the priests spoke not out, and so kept us awake,
To the top of the tree they might wind,
And once more burn º: alive at the stake,
As men did when their Church ruled Man’s mind.
So let WEUILLot rave on as I suffer M'HALE,
And allow frantic CULLEN his fling.
I say, let the rattlesnake rattle its tail,
And warn us 'tis ready to sting.
Give them all rope enough, and ñeir own necks they’ll stretch,'
Their own weasands morally close
And save us the need of employing jack KETCH,
Which treason, in act, might impose.
ODORIFEROUS PLANTS ON BOW COMMON.
MR. CROLL's Metropolitan Alum Works, on Bow Common, have
escaped abatement as a nuisance by reason that they are only One
great nuisance, among a variety of greater nuisances. The operation
in which the plant of MR. CRoll is concerned is the extraction of alum
from the refuse liquor of gas-works. In yielding alum, the gas-liquor
gives off an insufferable stench, insomuch that MR. Croil's neighbours
pulled him up in the person of his attorney before Mr. YARDLEY the
other day, averring, by their own advocate, that really there were such
nasty smells that came from the Metropolitan Alum Works, that they
must beg the Magistrate to deodorise them by the arm of the law. In
the same way that a gentleman of colour pleaded that an unpleasant-
ness with which he was personally chargeable, was not so bad as that
acquired by a certain white person in the exercise of a particular calling,
MR.C.Roll defended the effluvia of his own works by those of adjoining
establishments; and he got off for the present.
But, as the case may be carried to the Court above, it may be advisable
for MR. CROLL to take any measures that he can to compel any and all
complainants to stay º s. There is a plan that he might
adopt with that view which would more than satisfy those troublesome
parties. From the very liquor out of which he gets alum attended
with foul exhalations, Chemistry is capable of extracting the most
exquisite scents. Let him combine Perfume-Works with Alum-Works
and thus diffuse around his vicinity a sweet savour which shall over-
power all offensive emanations. The surrounding inhabitants will then
no longer be under the necessity of stopping either his works or their
noses, and, instead of being poisoned by sulphurous acid or sulphuretted
hydrogen, will be only ready to die in aromatic pain of fragrance more
delicious than that of Rondeletia or Kiss-Me-Quick.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LOOK IN HIS FACE.
--→es. UR Ladies have a humble
habit of saying that they
are “always willing to
learn,” and though this
statement is usually vouch-
safed in a tone not exactly
that of submission, but in
a way about equivalent
to “Now them, Mr. Cle-
- ver,” it is the part of a
g- well-natured man to accept
== º the declaration, without
regard to the mode in
- -->
=>
which it is delivered.
Therefore, the following
advice from MR. BiNGHAM,
the esteemed Beak, may
be tendered with all de-
- ference. That worthy Ma-
= gistrate had before #. a
is cabman, charged with be-
== ing drunk, and driving
: over Mrs. Dixon, in Rºſ
ent Street. The offender's
defence was, that MRs.
Dixon suddenly stopped
in the middle of the road
as she was crossing. The
Magistrate did not think
this act, aggravating as it
might be to the feelings
of a cabman (who, like one
of MR. SURtees's coach-
men, “ considered the
street belonged to him so
long as he wanted to use
it’’), quite sufficient to
authorise MR. BloRE, the
driver in question, in going smack over the woman and breaking her ancle. Moreover,
MRs. Dixon explained that there was no undue desire on her part to take the liberty of
crossing the road, inasmuch as she had waited ten minutes for a clear path. So MR.
BINGHAM, in his turn, drove over the cabman, with the following prelude:—
“MR. BinoHAM said he gave MRs. Dixon great credit for having waited before ...ºf to cross, a
thing yery unusual with females, they generally running across without looking. Persons walking across a
road should always walk deliberately, and as if they had a right to do so, and should never run, as it threw
drivers into difficulties. They should walk firmly across the street, look the driver in the face, and they
might depend upon it that he would pull up."
After this little explanation of the Social Science of going over a crossing, MR. BinghAM
gave MR. BLORE a month of hard labour in prison, by way of a hint that the streets are
made for everybody, and that a cabman “is not everybody,” as the phrase goes, though he
does “consider himself most people,” as the other phrase goes. -
Reproducing MR. BINgham's advice, Mr. Punch would add, that if every one of the lovely
beings whom he sees in Regent Street and elsewhere is going to look drivers straight in the
face, he shall turn cabman immediately, and he hereby orders the Somerset-house people to
send him a badge, in a mauve velvet case, by twelve o’clock on Saturday next.
A REALLY ENLIGHTENED STATESMAN.
MR. PUNCH begs to signify his unqualified adhesion to the Palmerston government, that is
to say, so long as GeoRGE Clive, Under-Secretary for the Home Department, remains in
office. That gentleman said the other day at Hereford, that—
“He was painfully reminded of the duties of his office by hearing an organ being ground outside, for one of
his most º: duties had been to assist the police magistrates in putting down the nuisance of organ grinding.”
Keep to your work, George CLIVE., Mr. Punch watches your political career with much
interest, and never shall you want a leg up while he can afford you that, accommodation.
One of the duties of the Home Department is to make home happy, and you do well in
grappling with an evil that has broken more women's hearts (by sending their husbands out,
or to the club, or anywhere to be away from the abominable music) than any invention of
modern days....It is a great oversight in the treaty of Zurich, that no provision is made for
the recal to Piedmont of the mass of organ-grinding wretches who now infest England.
If the Sardinians only knew that the “coldness” of England upon the Italian question was
due to the hate entertained for these missionaries of discord, every grinning scoundrel among
them would be now on his way back to the south. Wictor EMMANUEL will please accept
this intimation, Meantime, bravo, GEORGE CLIVE!
The Kentucky Slasher.
Flogging, like Charity, begins at home. It seems that GENERAL HARNEY, the Kentuckian
who got up the San Juan difficulty, and was about to lead on America to flog all creation,
began some time back by flogging one of his negro slaves, Ha woman,—and *:::: her to
death. It is as well that this Cat should be let out of the bag, with which MR. BUCHANAN
-euphuistically denominating it the Sack—has kindly presented the General.
THE ITALIAN CHEWY CHACE.
KING Victor out of Sardinia,
And a fair resolve made he,
That he would hunt in the forests
..Qf Orca Vale for days three;
Till answer came from doughty Ally,
fannexation now might be.
The fattest hartès in all Orca Wale
He said he would kill and carry them away;
-- # my faye,” said doughty Ally meanwhile,
“I will let that hunt be as it may.
“But for hunting after Kingdoms more,"
deem I can't allow:
I'll think it o'er, and plan reply
At my loisir—but not just now.”
Then KING WICTOR out of his Turin came,
And with him a goodly train
Of hunters, sportsmen, all good shots;
And chosen for their merits plain.
For KING Victor was of manly make,
Straightforward and just meaning;
Good fiſh he kept, good faith he held
For due on all sides, without leaning.
KING Victor joyèd in his hunting-bout,
To chase the forest deer;
The buxom air, the sportsman's life,
His royal heart did cheer.
He said, “”Tis time doughty Ally
Sent Answer without craft;
But I wist he’d take his own good time:— ”
And loud KING WIctor laughed,
“I’ll still abide doughty Ally’s
Response in his own way:
But Iween I'll follow still mine own;
'Tis more direct, by my fay!”
Then KING WIctor sought his hunting sport,
And shot with good will and aim;
He downed a noble stag, and said:—
“Non c'e male, that, for game !”
KING Victor in his sprightly mood,
For-joyed in his deed;
Quoth he, “I’ll send this fat ven’son
To one deserves best meed.”
Then called King Victor to him straight,
A trusty page or squire;
Bade him haste to Central Italiè,
And there eſtsoons enquire
For General of the Italian band,
Who GARIBALDI hight:
And deliver from the King's own hand
This token of its might.
Its º t—though now as nunter shown—
In skill of deadly aim,
To bring their mutual foeman down,
And comradeship to claim.
Its might, its right, to guerdon worth;
And graciously confer
This mark of royal friendliness,
Nay, brotherhood, as 'twere.
This was the hunting of Orca Wale,
In lovely Italiè; -
Now long live Victor, stalwart King!
And eke GARibALDi.
Napoleonism, Idealism, and Realism.
FRANCE went to war the other day for an
Idea. That idea was the freedom of Italy from
the Alps to the Adriatic. . Now if the EM-
PERoR of the FRENch wishes to cover France
and himself, with glory, he has only to allow
that idea to become a reality.

NOVELTY.
EoPLE say that there is
nothing new under, the
sun, but this solar obser-
vation is continually, to
our mind, receiving re-
futation. At the theatres
especially there is a con-
stant aim at novelty, and
the aim results occasion-
ally in something like a
hit. We learn, for in-
stance, from a Paris cor-
respondent of the Tele-
graph, that on the night
of opening the Théâtre
Déjazet, which has been
known to older playgoers
as the Folles Nouvelles:—
“The performance was com-
menced by the delivery of a
logue, written, some say,
thirty-six different authors,
others, by sixty-six, which in-
troduced the company and the
new directress to the audience.
and explained in the manner
common to such special pro-
ductions, the plan of manage-
ment to be pursued at the
establishment.”
MORE DRAMATIC
It is no uncommon
thing to hear of authors
joining in the writing of
a piece, but that some
three dozen writers should
have laid their heads
together for the writing of a prologue is certainly a novelty of the very
newest type. As an opening address is not a very lengthy matter, we
almost wonder how so many pens, could have found room to turn a
sentence in it; and we fear their joint production would resemble in
its quality the broth which has been spoilt by an overcharge of cooks.
Public writers are in France so commonly compelled to sign their
names to what they write, that perhaps the thirty-six or sixty-six who
wrote this prologue were bººf to put their signatures to the sen-
tences they penned. If this were so, we really think that to do the
authors justice, their names should have been read out when the pro-
logue was delivered, so that the public might have known to whom it
was indebted for the jokes which chiefly tickled it. It seems to us this
notion might produce, if rightly worked, a capital effect; and as suc-
cesses on the French stage are always copied on our own, we should
not be surprised to hear that the idea has in England carried out.
As the notion might of course be variously acted on, it would not at
all astonish us to find some popular comedian taking his farewell of us
in some such speech as this:—
“Ladies and Gentlemen (Smith), accustomed as I am to public
speaking (Brown), I have never felt myself more at a loss for words
{ ones) than I do upon the present to me heart-breaking occasion
Robinson). I have this evening to take leave of my ky-indest friends
and patrons (Hawkins); to bid farewell to the footlights (Jawkins),
which have nightly lit my path towards an honourable retirement
ſº and flared with equal flame upon each failure or success
Snivey). The profession of an actor is an arduous profession (Snooks).
His progress is a course beset with obstacles and difficulties (Tomkins).
Like the course at Epsom, it is full of ups and downs (Whipper), and
like (Snapper). “the course of true love never doth run smooth’
Shakspeare). But arduous as is the profession I have chosen (Blogg),
have never for an instant thought it was too much for me (Bragg).
I have always been in readiness to undertake whatever part was en-
trusted to my hands (Wilson), however little fitted I may have been
considered for it (Watkins); and to my invincible belief in my own
pºwers I believe Imainly owe the proud º I have gained (Cheeke).
I do remember' (Shakspeare) that the first time I played Hamlet,
e (Jowler), and were absurd enough
be returned to them (Brass). The
was consoled by the comforting reflection that, after all, the geese did
not contrive to save their capital (Stumpy). This anecdote will show
. my ky-ind friends and patrons (Crawler), that I have not always
een the favourite I am (Gibbs). But the pursuit of popularity has
been to me a Love Chace, and I have never feared the Rivals (Sheridan)
who have beset my path (Cocker). , Still, although I may regard
myself as having been the (Thompson) “architect of my own fortune’
(Anon.), it is to you, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would attribute my
success (Briggs). Aided by my ky-ind friends, the writers for the
ress (Johnson), whom I am always glad to welcome as my guests
Jackson), your discernment has, so guided, discovered my deserts
(Cringer), and your unbiassed patronage has most liberally acknow-
ledged them (Snobb). Ladies and Gentlemen (Short), I have now the
º of bidding you farewell (Long). As the Swan of Avon sings
rtade
( ) “Parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say—Good night till it be morrow."—(Shakspeare.)
But ‘the best of friends must part” (Anon.), and as ‘what must be
must’ (Author also unknown), I feel I am compelled once in my life to
yield to circumstances (Prosely). Ladies ...} Gentlemen º
have but two words more to say to you (Stiggins). “Life ain’t ſ
beer and skittles’ (Slick). ‘’Tis not in mortals to command success’
(Shakspeare); but whatever skittles or success I have enjoyed (Griggs),
it is to your ky indness that Ifeel I owe it (Finis).”,
AN EXAMPLE MADE.
MR. PUNCH's Balmoral Anecdotes not having quite succeeded, in
stopping the flood of flunkeydom let loose by the Scotch ers with a
rush that rivalled the Loch Katrine water-works (although he is bound
to say that the nuisance instantly and greatly abated), he fulfils his
menace by presenting a real anecdote of one of these idiots, and more-
over indicating him. A writer in the Fife Flunkey—no, Herald, actually
contributes this rubbish:—
“As the Sheriff of Edinburgh stood in shrieval dignity on the
railway station, a lady sought audience of him. It was granted, an
ceeded to tell him that she had a little girl with her who was deeply in love with
PRINCE ARTHUR, and that nothing on earth would satisfy her short of presenting
PRINCE ARTHUR with a bouquet. The Sheriff pondered a moment, but was afraid he
had not jurisdiction sufficient for the proposed presentation of the bouquet—how-
ever, he would see. Accordingly he entered the Royal Carriage and explained the
matter to the QUEEN, º out to her the expectant young lady, who stood, a
bewitching little creature, all blushes, hopes, and fears, on the platform. HER
MAJEsty, with the utmost promptitude, declared her willingness for the bouquet
scene, and said she could not for a moment “come between the two.” Whereupon the
Sheriff returned with the welcome tidings, and little Miss —— stepping forward
with the grace of FERRARIs, presented her flowers, with a charming consciousness
beaming from her child-face, which no doubt the youthful prince fully appreciated.”

Which, you ass, means the child-face—do you mean that, or the
“consciousness?” Mr. Punch is in doubt which was the worst, the im-
pertinence of the female who, in order to have something to taſk about
to her familiars, poked her child under the QUEEN’s nose, and made the
poor little girl uncomfortable; or the sycophant folly of the writer
who could commemorate such twaddle and rudeness. The speech
attributed to the QUEEN is, of course, “a lee; ” but no doubt HER
MAJESTY was, as usual, very good-natured, and it is a shame that
vulgarians should intrude upon her, or other vulgarians, print the
particulars of such intrusion. Now, Fife, how do you like that ?

who is, perhaps, the most liberal contributor to the French Press, for
the simple reason that there is no Editor who dare to refuse to insert
his articles, was no less a personage than Louis NApoleon him-
self. Should this mighty wielder of the sceptre and the pen, how-
ever, fall under the displeasure of the Pope, and be threatened, like

THE CAB MAN'S CLUB.
. MR PUNCH is exceedingly happy to find that those useful institu.
tions, Clubs for Cabmen, are being established in various quarters o
the town. LQRD SHAFTESBURY states that they are productive of
much fººd and that the Cabmen, instead of going home to quarrel
with their wives, come to the Club, and in intellectual conversation
dissipate the hatred they have formed for mankind during the day's
conflict. Softened down, they are thus restored to their homes, and
statistics show that since the getting up of these Clubs, the percentage
of black eyes among Cabmen's º: been reduced from 1 in 6 to
l, in 10. Mr., Punch, wishes all success to the effort, and is much
pleased with the bye-laws of the Cabman's Clubs. He submits a few
of the rules. It will be seen that they are calculated to exclude every
recollection or discussion of a disagreeable character:—
I.
That no Member shall say “Here you are!” under any circum-
stances whatever.
III.
..That no Member shall look at a map of London, or ask another the
distance from any point to any other.
W.
That in no case, except when one Member promises another a legacy,
shall any Member say “I’ll leave it to you.”
VII.
That there shall be no attempt to pass bad money at the Club.
WIII.
That, except when a haunch of venison is presented to the Club by
LoRD ŚāAPresbury, the word Buck shall never be mentioned.
XI.
That the porter in the hall shall receive the badges of all the Members
on their entering, and shall return each in a sealed envelope as the
owner goes out.
xii.
That Osses shall be as little spoken about as possible, and then only
in reference to sporting events.
xiii.
That a bird's mouth shall be alluded to as his pecker, or some other
device shall be employed to avoid the word Beak.
xW.
That, except when speaking of a fight, there shall be no use of the
word Mill, and that no Member shall describe another as Cranky.
XVI.ii.
That a vessel containing liquid shall be called the Wase, or the
Chalice, or the Ewer, but upon no occasion the Jug.
XX.
That the waiters shall always have small coin about them, and never
have to say, “I’ve no change, Sir.”
XXI.
That all anecdotes of successes obtained over female, aged, country,
or foreign Fares be forbidden, not as unwelcome, but as calculated to
excite envious feelings in those Members who have been unfortunate
enough to obtain little more than their legal hire.
“Save us from our Friends!”
FRANCE is making a claim of 400,000,000 francs upon Piedmont for
the expenses of the late war. It is said that in the event of Piedmont
not being able to satisfy this claim, that it will have to part with either
Savoy or Nice. We doubt the latter, for it would be a shock to our
intellectual powers of penetration if we looked upon Louis NAPOLEoN
otherwise than as a ruler that was not over Nice. .

A FEW GLOBULES FOR HOMOEOPATHY.
Having gone through a small course, of Homoeopathy, and fairly
digested its merits, we have come to the following inevitable con:
clusion:-‘‘What you tell us that is true is not new, and what you tell
us that is new isn't true.”
The latter part of our judgment, or “what you tell us that is new,”
has reference to the assertions of the Homºeopaths that they cure an
average of a hundred and five per cent. of all their cases; and this, too,
by the administration of infinitesimal doses.
With regard, to the former portion, or “what you tell us that is
true,” we mildly take upon ourselves to assert, that the doctrine of
“similia similibus curantur” was known and Fº long before
HAHNEMANN, or any other man of their school, saw the usual poly-
chromatic light suspended over his medical door. Instances of this
are as plentiful as cases in the Divorce Courts. From the beginning
of the world, ever since Mr. Bacchus planted the vine, we have ever
reason to believe that men have occasionally taken “a little too much,”
and cured themselves the next day,..." by a hair of the dog that bit
them,”—a clear case of “similia similibus.”
Again, “Setting a thief to catch a thief,” is as “old as the hills,”—
even those that “flesh is heir to.”
There is yet another instance of this doctrine, well known in days of
yore, in the following nursery lines:—
“There was a man of Teddington, and he was wondrous wise,
ºjº. into a quickset-hedge, and scratched out botlı his eyes;
when he saw his eyes were out, with all his might and main,
He jumped into another hedge, and scratched them in again.”
We leave Homoeopaths in the midst of this quickset hedge to get out
of it, the best way they can. . It is so clear aproof of *like curing
like,” that the blindest º in the efficacy o #. must see it.
There is blindness produced by the Wise Man of Teddington jumping
into a hedge, and scratching his eyes out; and then by going through
another hedge, and the same º: of scratching his eyes, he recovers
them in less (to speak vulgar {}}. two winkings.
Although we fancy we must before this have convinced all reasonable
beings that “like having the power of curing like" is no new idea,
WOL. XXXVII.
----
still we cannot conclude without quoting one last, but no small,
º upon the point, which, we imagine, is dead against the
atomic theory of infinitesimal doses. We do not recollect ever having
heard it quoted by the Homoeopaths themselves in support of their
argument. We, He; beg, in all good feeling, to present it to
them for their especial benefit and behoof:—
“A little money is a dangerous thing,
Drink deeply, or touch not the Pierian spring:
There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
But drinking deeply sobers us again?"
This last line leans a little to the “similia similibus” creedi, but we
make the Homoeopaths a small present of it, giving them full liberty to
extract what benefit they can from it, as a proof we do not wish to be
hard upon them. Meanness is the test of a little mind, and we do
not profess to deal in little things, as though we were no better than a
Homoeopath.
TWICE SHUT UP.
“Mr. WARD, the American º who went in the box to Pekin, did not, after
all, get the treaty ratified there.”—Globe.
O Cousins, in decency, out of your annals
The story (to use Printers’ language) delete ;

And shared with your kinsmen the enemy's knocks,
Than had to remark of your Cabinet Minister, ->
“Oh, breathe not his name, let it sleep in the Box.
A Letter too Many.
Count Roguet has been sent by Louis NAPOLEON on a mission to
KING BoMBALINo. Considering the part now being played in Italy by
the French Emperor, the name of this Neapolitan envoy seems to be
right to a “t.” But the “t” ought clearly to be omitted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BALLADS FOR BEDLAMITES.
ENSITIVE minds are af.
flicted to consider what
heaps of trash our sen-
timental balladmongers
write. Often as we have
called attention to the
subject, we fear but
little profit has resulted
from our criticism. In-
deed, judging from the
samples which have re-
cently been handed to
us, we really think
the stuff and nonsense
which is written is be-
coming annually more
stuffy and nonsensical.
For instance, what pre-
posterous absurdity it
is for a young lady to
burst out, during a lull
in conversation, with
the startling interroga.
tive, “Will you love me
then as now?” a ques-
tion obviously intended
for a private pair of
ears, and not to be pro-
pounded to a roomful
of company. , What
folly, too, it is for any girl to break the solemn silence of a tea-fight by suddenly exclaiming,
.0 Willie, we hare missed you!”—a remark which sets one wondering, as to who, this
WILLIAM is, and whether he has committed burglary, or bolted with the till, or what else is
the reason that his family have missed him. - -
Nor is the folly of such songs the worst fault we can find in them. To our mind their
mendacity quite equals their absurdity. When Miss SQAULLER, for example, at the tiptop of
her voice sings out “I have always a welcome for thee!” she knows as well as we do that were
any one to act upon her general invitation, he would most likely get his ears boxed, or be
kicked out of the house. Moreover, who believes a sentimental singer when he or she keeps
constantly protesting before company, that “I’m leaving thee in sorrow, Annie /"—an action
which a person cannot constantly be doing, although it is just possible one might have done
it once. Who, again, can listen with anything like patience when Miss SchREECHER screws
her voice up to its shrillest pitch, and bursts out with some such bosh as, “Ever of thee I’m
fondly dreaming /* However much Miss SchREECHER may dream when she's asleep, she
cannot, when awake continue in so doing; and to make assertion therefore, that she is
“ever” dreaming is as barefaced a falsehood as well can be conceived. "Such falsehoods are,
however, nightly uttered in our drawing-rooms; and yet the truthfullest of parents take no
steps to clap a º on them.
o put some check upon the sale of the stuff and nonsense sellers who supply, such
rampant rubbish as that which we have quoted, we have devoted some five minutes to the
writing of a song or two, which may serve to throw some ridicule upon our sentimental
songwrights, and may bring them to their senses, if perchance they have any. As
sentimental songs must be silly to be popular, we have tried to make our specimens as
senseless as we can, and in every way to imitate the Bedlamitish bosh which our composers
are insane enough just now to set to music. To read glibly and to rhyme are apparently
the only conditions which are aimed at, and we leave the world to judge if we have hit the
mark. It is a great point, too,with songwrights to make a taking title. , Young ladies who
buy ballads are caught as readily by a title as plebeian millionnaires; and as the first line of
a loye-song is used in general for its title, we may say for popularity, C'est le premier pers qui
coſite. , We have, therefore, paid particular attention to this point, and rather feel inclined
to pride ourselves upon our titular success. There is a something, so striking in the first
lines of our ballads, that we feel persuaded they would make a hit. Were the following
º to music by a popular composer, there is no saying what a heap of money it might bring
us :-
BALLAD–"SEE THE SWALLOWS GAILY SWIMMING !”
Melody by BUFFER. Poetry by PUNCH.
See the swallows gaily swimming, Now the cat hath left the city,
Hop upon the rainbow’s back! Now the dove hath left her den,
See, the milky way is skimming, Waken, love, and hear my ditty,
And the comet's got the sack! I’m the merriest of men'
Sweetly purrs the cheeky chicken, See, my eyes with grief are pouring,<
Softly sings the rampant gnu; See, my heart is black and blue;
While the moon's alive and kicking, Harken then, oh! to my snoring,
Fond one, ah! I love but you! Fond one, oh! I love but you!
The words of our next specimen are also slightly incoherent; but there is certainly good
sound in them, if there be not good sense:–
BALLAD—"THE CLOUDS ARE SHINING CLEAR AND BRIGHT!”
Melody by DUFFER. Poetry by PUNCH.
The clouds are shining clear and bright, The owlets sparkle red as night,
The moon is blazing blue, And sighs the tame curlew;
The frogs are mewing far and wide,
No sound abroad is seen,
So come, my love, and be my bride,
For it is all serene!
The tiger hops from spray to spray,
And clears his ...; throat,
I catch a fragment of his }};
He warbles, “I’m afloat?”
The divingbeil soars high above,
'Tis steered by MR. GREEN;
So come, my bride, and be my love,
For, yes! 'tis alſ sereneſ
In the last of our three specimens there is some-
what more coherence; and as the least approach
to sense is avoided by our song-writers, we
have no doubt this coherency would interfere
with its success. Nevertheless, we mean to
print it, and any publisher, who chooses to pay
us for the copyright, will have our gracious
leave to do the ditto with our ditty, and make
as fine a fortune by it as he can:—
BALLAD—"WHEN THE SPARROWS UPWARD
SOARING !”
Melody by STUFFER. Poetry by PUNCH.
When the sparrows upward soaring
Bruise their wings against the sky,
When the beetle by his snoring
Wakes the dormouse slumb'ring nigh;
When the dolphin on the billow
Ceases for his wife to rove,
And the ..ºf leaves the willow,
Then may I too cease to love
When no more the bosky thickets
Joy to sip the mountain dew,
When to chirrup cease the crickets,
And the sky’s no longer blue!
When the ocean ceases flowing,
When the donkey mates the dove,
When the cochin ceases º
Then may I too cease to love!
There is nothing very wonderful in any of
these ballads, excepting, we admit, that they are
wonderfully silly. Yet if SIMs REEyes would
but sing them once or twice in ". We are
sure that all young ladies would instantly go
mad for them; and there are lots of lunatics
at large in the community who would be insane
enough to lendalistening ear to whatever their
particular young lady lent her lips to. So, as we
never entertain a doubt of the merit and success
of anything we do, we feel persuaded the most
maniacal of musical furores will be at once ex-
cited by our Ballads for Bedlamites.
Passionate Pastorals.
The ARchbishop of MALINEs has published
a ferocious pastoral, abusing the vindicators of
Italian liberty, and menacing eternal bad con-
sequences to all parents who send their children
to the Belgian public schools. If it had not
been for the ravings which CULLEN and, MAC-
HALE have also vented on the like subjects,
we should say that the ARchbishop of MALINES
was unrivalled for malignity.
Buccleuch v. Brougham.
A WoRD to the Electors of the President of
the Edinburgh University. “New brooms,” it
is said, “sweep clean.” But there is an old
BROUGHAM that sweeps cleaner than any amount
of new ones. That is the BRough AM to stick
at your masthead.

the “faithful,” the writer ought to have a large allowance of faith, to think of sending any
money to the office of an Irish newspaper. -
But as touching that same Irish Brigade contemplated by the “parties” who have been

themselves abroad to fight against the emancipation of a foreign people. Let them, go;
GARIBALDI and his brave bands, will soon give an account of the blackguards, and Ireland
will rejoice in a good riddance of bad rubbish.
ASSURANCE DOUBLE SURE.
MR. PUNCH had occasion some little time back to give a significant hint that he did not
approve of one form of Post-Office Assurance, namely, the Assurance that presumed to
inquire much too minutely into the private affairs of Everyman's Castle. He has the more
|. in tº commending a new form of Assurance in the same quarter. MR.
owl,AND HILL hath taken into consideration the fact that it is not easy for a gentleman
with a limited salary to pay a large sum at given dates (not dates you eat, Wiscount; what
a Hass you *}} whereas the same amount might be pleasingly spread over a long period.
Following out this train of thought, MR. HILL hath arranged with divers Life Assurance
Societies, that the Post Office itself shali pay the premiums on the policies, effected by
clerks and other officials in the Establishment, and that the same shall be deducted in small
amounts from the weekly or monthly salary of the party. Now, this is so kind and wise an
arrangement, that nobody can be at all surprised that all the other Government Offices have
abstained from following so good an example. However, with an occasional prod from
Mr. Punch, they may in time be induced to imitate the Post Öffice. -
Now is the time for young husbands and fathers in official situations to show their regard
(if any) for their Partners and Progeny. Now will a slight weekly retrenchment begin to
tell. For instance, a visit to the theatre. A cab to take your wife costs at least two
shillings; boxes, say eight shillings; box-keeper (Adelphi and Covent Garden excepted), one
shilling; ices and all that rubbish, two shillings; your own white gloves, a shilling and a
º Tottenham Court Road). . Well, leave your wife at home, walk to the theatre, go
to the pit, buy a penny bill, have a pint of porter. No cabs, no boxes, no harpy, no ices,
no gloves. This will save eleven shillings and ninepence halfpenny. Now that'sum weekly
is more than £30 a-year, and for that payment you can assure your life for £1,000, besides
the comfort of knowing how much better it is for your wife to be at home minding the
children, than in a hot theatre hearing frivolous dialogues.
There is another way of effecting the same object, but it is so mean that Mr. Punch
mentions it only as matter of form., You cannot get a good cigar under fivepence, and you
smoke four a-day. Give it up, and you will save in the week about the same sum as by the
former process. But this is not recommended. As your wife is to benefit by the assurance,
not you, it is fitting that she make the sacrifice towards it.
But, anyhow, Gentlemen, and others, of the Post, Office, now is your time, and Mr. Punch
§: speedily to hear that all the Government Offices adopt the plan, and all the Assurance
Offices concur in it. Honesty is the best Policy, but a Policy on your life is a very good one.

A BALSAM FOR BRUISED SPIRITS.
WE read that the Governor of Cayenne has
abandoned in that transporting colony the culti-
vation of the castor-oil plant, and replaced it
by sesame. As Sesame was the watchword of
thieves in the well-known Ali Baba story, it may
be considered the most appropriate plant for con-
victs and the outcasts of society, and one so rich
in association that it may be likely to lure them
on to habits of industry, to which such charac-
ters generally entertain a most rooted antipathy.
Sesame in the fairy chronicle was the charm
that opened the cavern in which were hidden
countless treasures; so, in this instance, it may
be the magic key that is to open to the wonder-
ing eyes, of the thieves who work it, all the
§§ that is buried in the earth. . We say
“thieves,’ as it is well known that, owing to the
munificence of Louis NAPOLEON, not a single
olitical exile now remains in the wretched
island of Cayenne, or, else we would not insult
them with so “priggish” a parallel.

IF a cat have nine lives, how many has a lawyer?
This is not a riddle, reader, although you may think it reads like one.
On the contrary, indeed it is a question of grave import, and to
those whom it concerns it is confessedly no joke. The reason why we
ask it is to help to solve the problem as to how much longer the lawyers
will continue to exist: a problem which, according to a high legal
authority, appears to have a .."; disturbed the legal mind. At the
meeting of the Law Association held last week, the chairman spoke
most piteously on this distressing subject, and described in touc ing
terms the lowness of the ebb to which, financially regarded, the pro-
fession was reduced. He said that fees were so cut down, that the
lawyers, as a body, were thoroughly cut up; and the only means by
which they might continue to exist was by ekeing out the scanty and
uite insufficient pittance which remained of their small savings ere
they were so oppressed.
Said the Chairman, MR. BEAUMONT,-
“I admit that it is wonderful, all things considered, yet somehow or other, chiefly
through the practice of great abstinence, we still exist.”
So, according to this orator, a lawyer is in fact a marvel of vitality;
and may, without untruth in this j. be likened to a cat. There
is moreover this yet further similarity between them, namely, that both
creatures are gifted with remarkable tenacity of claw, and keep firm
hold of whatever may come within their clutch. When, therefore, we
are told that the lawyers are distressed, we do not feel quite unmixed
pity for their plight... Protest as they may, that they have nothing left
to live upon, we believe that they have still some mice left in their
larders, to whom, for all that MR. BEAUMQNT may talk about their
.." we are convinced, when they feel hungry, they still pay
elr devours.
THE PRESENT POWDER DUTY.
The Ladies' Own Journal informs our gallant Riflemen that, by the
44th George III., cap. 54, sec. 11, all members of a Rifle Corps are
entitled to wear hair-powder free of duty. The only powder, however,
that Riflemen are now interested in is gunpowder, which would be
unsuitable, in an ornamental point of view, to any hair, except the
coarse and woolly crop of a nigger, and would be applicable to that
only with the effect of ºf refined ſº not to say of painting the
lily, or of adding #if perfume to the violet. In the use of gun:
powder, moreover, it is confidently hoped that our bold Riflemen will
always hold themselves under the obligation of duty.
TO THE NEWSPAPER-READING WORLD.
It may not be generally known that a translation of the Moniteur
appears every morning in London. It is written, we regret to say, in
#. lish, and is j under the name of the Morning Chronicle. It
strikes us to be a tolerably fair translation, but of course there are no
signatures to the articles, as in the ; which otherwise it follows
very closely in other respects. Notwithstanding the omission of names,
however, we fancy, we can detect the tone of some of the most brazen
trumpeters of the Tuileries that are allowed to have their bray in the
columns of the Moniteur... We are sorry that, an English newspaper
should have lost all animal spirit so far as to echo such braying.

RIFLING THE QUEEN’S ENGLISH.
HE following incident oc-
curred at the inauguration
dinner given to the Hal.

take from the Sheffield

“The 4th and 3rd companies
having, in obedience to the
order of their commandin
officers, left “he ante-room an
taken their seats in the hall,
the order, “Second company,
in single file,” was given, and
it was somewhat amusing to
see the manner in which they
obeyed the order, going not in
“single file,’ but in a higgledy-
piggledy sort of fashion, twos-
threes, fours, and all in dis-
order. The civilians were the
only persons remaining, and

toasts were given out in a
similar style, the banquet must have been exceedingly rich. We should say that a
toastmaster was sadly wanted at Sheffield. That high-mettled town, whose
mettle never shines to so much advantage as when displayed in a case of bene-
volence or charity,+can seemingly supply capital knives and forks for a public
dinner, but its English, if measured b ſe above specimen, was, we should say,
a little too blunt. It might beneficially undergo an extra polish or two, before it
is . introduced at table; or else Mr. Punch will certainly “goo in,” and send
Sheffield down a sample of his most, cutting articles, such as not all the grinders
and polishers of the place shall be able to surpass for finish, brilliancy, sharpness,

And make them pań.
Confound those hoops and things,
Frustrate those horrid springs,
And India rubber rings,
Deuce take them all!

No more catch fire and burn.

you will find to your cost, until you can find the accom-
panying half to match it, and so, like a matrimonial match,
to make the two into one. Once for all, we wish to impress
upon you, for fear you should be writing again, that most
decidedly “half a Bank-note is not better than none.”—

THE OLD CLOTHES LINE.
THE subjoined are portions of a letter which has appeared in a
country paper:-
“HASLEMERE.-TAKING A CHILD'S SHOES FOR A RAILWAY FARE.
“To the Editor of the West Sussex Gazette.
“SIR,-Upon coming to London by the 6'15 train from Portsmouth, on Sunday
evening last, and when at Haslemere station, amid torrents of rain, a respectable
mechanic got into the train, with a most delicate child of five years of age, who to
our great surprise had his feet tied up in a white handkerchief. Upon our inquiring
the cause, he informed us that he had travelled down that morning, having paid for
the single journey, but not finding his friends, who had left the place, he was under
the necessity of immediately returning to London. Not having sufficient money to
pay the fare for himself and child back again, they at the Haslemere Station took
the man's waistcoat, which not being sufficient, they took the poor child's new
boots off his feet also. . . . The man's name is Johnson; he works at MEARs's
factory, Blackwall, and lives in the parish of Bromley, Essex.
“Yours, respectfully, Louis A LANGASTER."
“23, Great Tower Street, Oct. 19, 1850.”
The above statement will surely oblige the South-Western Railway
Company to - -
else a new table of fares, arranged on the principle of barter, for the
accommodation of those who may have clothes on their backs, but no
money in their pockets. A hat, so far; a necktie, such a distance; a
coat, a waistcoat, a pair of trousers, so many miles for each article of
apparel. But this sort of tariff would involve the necessity of occa-
sionally giving º as in the case of a swell who, on some race-
course, for example, had got cleaned out, watch and all. His pegtops
might be worth more than the fare they were rated at. Moreover
common decency would demand that the denuded passengers should
go in a fourth-class train. The Company would .. to set up an
old-clothes shop, which might_adjoin the refreshment room. Among
the articles therein exposed for sale, there would probably appear a
good many pairs of “Men's Strong Walking.” But we cannot think
that there would be any children’s shoes, in the window at least; for
even the economical South-Western Railway Company would, doubt-
less, be ashamed openly to exhibit the little lace-ups or diminutive

A SCOTCH EXPERIMENT.
WE read in the Inverness Courier—
“On Sunday the Members and adherents of MR. CAIRD's Church in Glasgow, for
the first time knelt at prayer, and stood at praise. MR. CAIRD announced this as
an experiment for two or three weeks.”
What is meant by experiment? There used to be an idea that an
elephant had no knees, but a writer in MR, ADDISON's Spectator con-
futed that idea by reporting an “experiment,” which resulted in
an elephant's kneeling to #. up MR. PENKETHMAN. Is there the
same superstition as to the conformation, of a Scotchman. And as
to standing There are doubtless rather a larger number of persons in
Glasgow in in any place of similar size who find it difficult to stand
under any circumstances on sº but this is owing to their peculiar
way of keeping the Sabbath, and they are not likely to be members of
MR. CAIRD’s congregation. Why, therefore, call decent and orderly
worship an experiment P But if it be meant that this departure from
certain old practices, adopted, of course, in defiance of certain older
ones, is to be subject to }. approval of the con º it º fairly

she will practically avail the successor of the Fisherman in the latter
character only. The Pop E has christened her the “Concezione Imma-
colata.” He calls his yacht the Immaculate Conception. With similar
taste, a British racing man denominated his horse “Promised Land.”
But what would our Cardinal say if John DAY, for ...}} were to
name one of his horses that which the Pope has named his yacht P
Yet surely a noble animal is more worthy than any structure built by
human hands. Sporting men may rejoice to learn what devotional

ANEw epithet appears in the theatrical adver-
tisements. A º calls himself a Joint
Author. Just the man for the terrible morning
after the production—the time when the stage
manager wants a lot of cuts.
FORBES MACKENZIE’S FOLLY.
The North Briton contains two cases which are highly calculated to
excite what serene and cynical gentlemen call virtuous indignation.
They occurred at Edinburgh. The first is—
“Mr. DOULLS CASE.
“At the Police Court yesterday, before Baillie Cassels, David Doyll & Co., pro-
rietors of the well-known Restaurant, 60, Princes Street, was charged with a
{. of the Forbes Mackenzie Act cºrtificate, inasmuch as on the 10th of Septem-
bºr last, he sold tarts to be consumed elsewhere than on his own premises."
A fellow named DoNALD BAIN, an officious detective officer, proved
that a boy named Richard JAcKhad bought five tarts at MR. Doull's
shop, and walked out with them in his pocket.
MR. Doull, in defending himself, made one remark which merits
reservation." He observed that “There was very, great difficulty in
nowing where the provisions of the Forbes Mackenzie Act began
and ended.” The reporter italicises the word “provisions.” There
can be no doubt that MR. Doull intended his observation for a joke.
Let it be recorded, to the honour of Scotland. MR. DQUIL further
justly remarked, respecting the obnoxious restrictions of the Act in
question, that—
“If these were continued to be enforced upon respectable citizens, he did not
know what they would come to in a short time. A lady might come into *...?
and purchase a cookie, consume the half, and take away the other half in
cule, for which he would be liable, according to the Act."
Then BAILLIE CAssels pronounced judgment, which amounted to
this; that, however absurd For BES MACKENZIE's Act ºf: be, he
felt it his duty to administer it to the best of his ability, and was sorry
to be obliged to fine the defendant £1 5s. A portion of his speech,
however, is worth preserving too; not, however, on account of its wit,
or “wut,” but for its profound gravity:—
“There may be many cases arise where there is great difficulty, and the case of
the lady purchasing the cookie and eating half of it is one of these. He thought
Mr. Douil, might have gone a step further, and asked whether he would have been
warranted in taking hold of the reticule, and taking the cookie from it, after it was
bought and paid for. He feared it would have been found that he had no right to
do so.”
One wonders that even an Edinburgh Baillie could say any more
about the ridiculous case before him than that he was ashamed of
being forced to adjudicate on a matter so contemptible, and enforce so
ridiculous a law.
The other instance of oppressive annoyance under the above-named
fool's Act is
“ MR. RIDPATH'S CASE.
“The next case brought up under the same Act was that of Councillor DAvin
Ridpath, keeper of the Railway Refreshment Room at the Edinburgh, Perth, and
Dundee Railway Station. He was charged with selling two muffins to two lads
going to Newcastle on the 22nd September.
“'The ovidcuco was in all respects similar to the previous case.”
The law, however, appears not to have been the same, for
“MR. DEUCHAR, agent in the case, said that before the passing of the Forbes
Mackenzie Act there, had been a special exemption made in favour of railway
refreshment rooms, which had not yet been repealed."
It may therefore be questioned whether BAILLIE CAssels was not
a mistaken. Baillie body in supposing that in this case also “he had
no alternative but to convict.” MR. RIDEATH was likewise fined £15s,
for selling two muffins to two boys. Mind, Sabbatarian hypocrites and
fanatics, for selling two muffins, not upon a Sunday, but on a Thursday.
MR. Doull, indeed, you may say, broke the “Sabbath”—he sold his
tarts on a Saturday.
FoRBEs MACKENZIE’s Act was levelled at public-houses. It may
shoot the pigeon but it also kills the crow. It punishes a confectioner
for selling a boy tarts, and so long as it exists, to the disgrace of the
legislature, will prevent every traveller, on a Scotch railway from
getting anything to eat but what he can bolt in the refreshment-room.
A. Scotch proverb says that “Fules should na hae, chapping-sticks.”
We will match it with an English parallel. An Act º Parliament
ought not to be drawn up by a jackass. -
BROUGHAM, C.
WITH great, satisfaction Mr. Punch announces, that his esteemed
friend LoRD BRough AM may once more adopt the above signature,
abandoned § him in 1834. He is again a Chancellor. The Universi
of Edinburgh has done itself the honour of electing him as its head,
that is to say 654 of the members have so distinguished themselves.
There was, however, a large exhibition of that curious Scotch super-
stition that a Duke is a supernatural being, before whom prostration
becomes a duty, and the Duke of BUccLEUCH, of whom nothing
whatever in this world is known, except that he is a Duke and a
respectable one, actually obtained 419 votes. The university men who
have had the courage to choose an Englishman, the descendant of
GILBERT DE BROHAM, of Westmoreland, whose ancestors held
Brougham before the Norman §§ (Mr. Punch is thus genea-
logical because he cannot give up to Scotland his adored HENRY, born,
it must be admitted, in Edinburgh), deserve nine cheers from Mr.
Punch, and he hereby gives them, and for the sake of those 654 he
takes Caledonia to his affectionate embrace. Long may the new Chan-
cellor enjoy his dignity. [If, when you come up to town, you will
drive on to 85, Fleet Street, we will make a wet night of it; meantime,
my Lord Chancellor, your health. 390tatutus tt $aluto.] P

his subjects more than any other ruler in the world. This is a merit
that is acknowledged even by his bitterest enemies.

COUNTY COURTSHIP
EN areinformed by a paragraph
in the Daily News, headed
“Caution to Smokers,”
that a MR. PAYNE was sued
in the Westminster County
Court by a Miss Louisa
Hoth AM for £5 damage
done to her dress by setting
it on fire with a cigar-light,
which he had carelessly
thrown burning on the floor
of a tavern-bar. The in-
jured articles comprised a
lack silkvisite, new muslin
dress, and embroidered Cri-
noline, which were handed
up to the Bench for its in-
s i. and amusement.
udgment was given against
the defendant; damages £4
with costs. He had offere
5s. This was mean and
shabby; but the decision of
the Court appears to have
been too favourable to the fair plaintiff. If MR.PAYNE was responsible
for the consequences of throwing fire on the floor, Miss Hotham
was answerable for those of wearing long dresses. The damages should
have been half those claimed, namely £2.10s.; and the case ought to be
§: as a caution, not only to smokers, but also to wearers of
rilloline.
OUR EPISCOPAL CONVERT.
ONE may learn wisdom, even from episcopallips. A new chapel has
been built for Exeter College, Oxford; and the Bishop of ExETER, at
the banquet, told a story about the Duke or WELLINGTON and himself.
Wesley and Pºirotis were once in Cambridge together, inspecting
some fine new buildings there. Says Dux to º “We don’t
build such things at Oxford.”. Smartly, as well as proudly, answers
the Bishop, “Perhaps, my Lord Duke, we don't require them.” Con-
cluded, or shut up, is the victor of NApoleon. But away goeth the
hierarch, and in the calm recesses of Bishopstowe considereth, his
reply. “It was very prompt, I, allow,” thinketh the triumphant
Bishop, “and quite in the Duke's line. Yes, I flatter my mitre, I
dropped into him. But-.” More pondering, and then Dr. Phill-
Potts came to the conclusion that Oxford did require new buildings;
and in process of time, and by the care of MR. Scott, upriseth this
fine chapel: and, later still, upriseth the Bishop of Exeter to preach
the moral—a favourite one of Mr. Punch's—that firstº should stop
and say the best thing you can say, and next you should go and do the
best thing you can do. Not, of course, that the Bishop's opinion will
have the weight of Mr. Punch's:
“Eadem dictaeademgue oratio aequa non acquevalet."
but it is gratifying to find the venerable PHILLPotts atlast treading in
the footsteps of the venerabilior Punch.
THE ORDER OF AGRICULTURAL MERIT.
Says old John Hodge to young John Hodge, says he, Jack, thee
come here;
I've lived and worked here, manand boy, for more nordree score year;
Thy mother brought me ten on ’ee; I rared 'em every one:
They be all at sarvus or at plough, 'cept thee, my youngest zon.
Ten childern have Ibred and kep, ten childern clothed and ved,
Nine on 'em larns and labours vor to git their daily bread;
And thee bist number ten, Jack; for a soger thee'st to goo,
And sarve thy Queen and country, and perſarm thy duty too.
There's twelve on us, the boys and gals, myself and lawful wife,
And I never cost the parish not a warden all my life,
Not a loaf and nare ablanket-on my own legs here Istand,
On which I’ve clod-hopped all my days, on FARMER Hogmas's land.
Now what dost think I’ve got at last for all you gals and boys?
Look here's a gooldenzuvran, and a pair o' corduroys,
A pair of bran-new breeches and a pound, my boy, likewise,
The Hagriculterl Ziety has gied me for a prize.
Zo much for never costun'em the valley of a strawl
A pound, a pair o'breeches, and a power o' purty jaw.
Why even the fat pig, JACK, as weighed over varty score,
He only won a ten-pound prize, he didn't win no more.
Ishan’t wear them there breeches, Jack, but keep ’em for to show,
By way of a remembrance, Iregards the honour zo! -
Mind they be to be thine, Jack, when as Ibe dead and gone,
And, Jack, thee keep ’em for my zake, and zumtimes have 'em on.
Thee'st gwian for a soger, Jack; thee'st ha' to vight thy way,
Med'st come to be a general, and a lord, mayhap, zum day;
Thy quqat all over ribbons, stars, and that are sart o' toys,
But tack thy brightest medal to thy weather's corduroys.
Then, when thee gist a bankut to mobility and squires,
And are a one a cross or star upon thy breast admires;
Have in thy weather's breeches, Jack, and tell how they was won,
To let 'em know how proud thee bist to be thy weather’s zon.
My weather, you may tell’em, fought a battle precious hard—
A fight as lasted all his life—this here was his reward,
Besides a pound, and that he spent, but left what I enjoys,
This Order o' the Breeches—this here pair of corduroys.
“WOICES OF THE NIGHT.”
At Warsaw, we read that the EMPEROR" visited the theatre, and
afterwards remained in consultation with the Russian diplomatists,
until a late hour in the night.” This is tearing a leaf out of our parlia:
mentary debates. We wonder, if as much good resulted from this
interview as generally comes out of our midnight consultations. The
report omits to tellus whether the sitting was a late one? As diplo-
matists are gentlemen rather given to talking, we suppose that the
debate must have been carried into a very protracted hour of the night.
It is a pity that no reporters were present, or otherwise we might have
been favoured with some very curious and interesting details. We
regret, also, that we are equally in the dark as to whether cigars and
spirits, with hot water, lemons, and º were moved for by the
MPERoR, and ordered to be iaid upon the table. We are afraid that
the EMPERoR can have been after no particular good, or else he would
never have selected an hour, at which all sober and well-regulated
individuals are generally in bed.
The War Footing.
Two promising pupils of LoRp CowLEy's were chatting at the
British Embassy over a glass of Sherry. “What, le.diable, my dear
fellow, is Louis Napoleon going to Morocco for?” said one...To
which the other replied, “Cannot pºssibly say, mon cher, unless it is
to get a match for italian Boot.”
A NATIONAL DIFFERENCE.
THE French papers will have it that there is a difference between
France and England. Yes, and so there is, and the difference is simply
this:-France goes to war for an idea, and England has no idea of
going to war.

A VERY PARDONABLE MISTAKE.
Itinerant Musician. “MEANING ME, Miss P”
PRIESTS AND THEIR SHAWLS.
THE subjoined advertisement from the Weekly Registeris commended
to the attention of youthful Puseyites, whom it may serve to convince
that playing at Roman Catholics is a rather expensive amusement:–
WANTEP, a Handsome COPE. The undersigned, who once received
a Cope from a kind but unknown friend, begs to mention that the said Cope
is now almost unfit for use. The poor state of the mission will not enable the priest
to purchase another. The undersigned, therefore, respectfully but earnestly begs
of some good friend to present a new Cope to the church, in honour of our Blessed
Lady and Saint Teresa. It will come safe by rail. Many prayers will be said for
the kind donor. If it be not convenient to send a Cope itself, É10 to purchase one
will be most acceptable.
JOHN CANON DALTON.
St. Mary's Church, London Road, Lynn, Norfolk.
From the conclusion of the above pious and pathetic appeal, it
appears that a cope costs £10. This would be a heavy fork-out for the
.# of young curates, disposed to indulge in ecclesiastical masque-
rading. To be sure, the cope for which the REv. CANoN DALtoN
advertises is explained to be a “handsome" one. MR. DALtoN may
be conceived to be a sacerdotal dandy; and it may be thought that a
serviceable cope is to be had at a lower figure than what he puts it at;
but he distinctly states that his mission is a poor one, so that any but
the very plainest description of cope would probably be out of keeping
with the style of his meeting-house, and the cheapest cope would be
handsome enough for him. A cope fit to figure in before a fashionable
congregation or assembly, would no doubt be an awfully º 'pike.
Parents and guardians of youth intended for the Church should beware
how they confide them to the tuition of Puseyite preceptors, lest those
extravagant ritualists should instil into their minds a love of finery,
which may cause them ultimately to ruin themselves in dress.
If a cope costs only as much as £10, what does a stole cost, and an
alb, and a dalmatic, and a chasuble? What does the complete costume
amount to? But there is every reason to suppose that the price of
copes is “from " £10 upwards to a much larger quotation; and the
outfit of a young Puseyite parson, if at all like the real thing, would
assuredly cost the old gentleman his father a great deal more money
than the sum total of all the bills which his sisters run up in the course
of an entire year for Crinoline.
BuccLEUCH v. BRough AM.–It is the Drone and the Busy Bee.
“FEU DE JOIE.”
A GREAT deal of fuss has
been made about the fact
of fifty-six geese having
been roasted at once before
the same fire, at Norwich.
Why Punch roasts twice
as many every week, and
thinks nothing of it. He
has roasted over and over
again the entire House of
Commons at a single blow
—and though they have
amongst them some of the
very finest geese in the
country, yet every Member
has been done beautifully
to a turn—so much so,
that many a constituency,
when their pet Solan has
been laid before them, have
scarcely recognised him
again. In the same way
Mr. Punch undertakes to
roast at the shortest notice,
as many geese as the legis-
lature and the quacks, the
theatres and the pulpits,
the dissecting-room and the
critics, choose to supply him
with ; and he also promises
to do all the jºi. and
basting and seasoning him-
self. Quantity is no ob-
ject; in fact, the greater
number of geese that come
in Mr. Punch's way the
greater his pleasure in
roasting them. His range
is wide enough to take in
the whole world.
INN-WALIDISM EXTRAORDINARY.
It is rather late now to think of fif out of town; but to those
who, like ourselves, have not yet had their holiday, and who, in like
similitude, have not too much to spend in it, advantages are offered by
the following, advertisement, which, for other reasons possibly, the
reflective mind, we think, may be induced to pause over:—
SLE OF WIGHT.-KING'S HEAD HOTEL AND BOARDING
HOUSE, close to the Sea. Single beds, 1s 6d ; Breakfast or Tea, 1s. ; Dinners. 2s.
Attendance, 1s. “It’s highly recommended to invalids at Evans's.” Oct., 1859.
One is proverbially used to º: cheapness with n—ot niceness,
but if this hotel be as remarkable for comfort as economy, one might
certainly be tempted to form a wish to visit it. In this case one would
have to form a second wish, to know with more distinctness, where the
King's Head really is. “ Člose to the sea” is a rather vague direction,
and one might have to travel completely round the island, before one
hit upon the spot where the hotel is placed.
But puzzling as it is to us to guess the King Head's whereabouts,
the last phrase in this notice of the house yet more perplexes us. As

IMPORTANT NOTICE.-QUITE NECESSARY
A SURGICAL SLAVE TO A FREE HOSPITAL.
MR. Punch has received a paper purporting to be a copy of the
Rules and Regulations Established for the Guidance of the House-
Surgeon of the Samaritan Free Hospital for Women and Children, 18,
Edwards Street, Portman Square. If Mr. Punch were asked to guess
the authors of this contemptible code, he would conjecture that it was
drawn º a Select Committee composed of the greatest snobs and
fools in Marylebone.
The first of these rules declares that—
“I. In regard to the appointment of the House-S n,
“1. He shall be qualified to register under the New Medical Act.”
The framers of these rules, then, want, for their House-Surgeon, a
º who has passed his examinations. They expect to get one
y the following temptation:-
“2. He shall receive no salary, but his board and lodging in return for his
services.”
Could any one of them hire a knife-boy on such terms?
These fellows appear to be alive to the probability that any surgeon
having accepted º: vile situation, might very soon get tired of it,
and wish to cut it. So they stipulate that—
“3. He shall accept the ap for not less than a year, but his period of
service may extend beyondt -
And it is just possible that he may be * that it should extend
beyond that term. The House-Surgeon may be penniless, and unable
to earn an abode and his victuals out of the House. But, as his
masters may wish to turn him out, for reasons of their own, and if not,
still in order that he may lie at their mercy, and exist, officially, in the
breath of their nostrils, the above regulation concludes with the fol.
lowing proviso:-
“At the same time he shall hold office only during the pleasure of the Managing
Committee.”
. Observe the royal º affected by these pett despots. Their sub-
ject and servant, the House-Surgeon, is to “hold office” only “during
their pleasure.” What pleasure? The pleasure, perhaps, which they
expect their slave to afford them, by capping to them and cringing to
and yºf

t term."
them, and trembling before them, and worshipping them,
in their faith and fear. Such is very usually the sort of pleasure whic
Hospital Cºmmittees require Hous: Surgeons, to yield them; and the
Managing Committee of the Samaritan Free Hospital are indicated by
these rules of theirs to be a set of mean tyrants considerably more
arbitrary and insolent than even the common run of Hospital Com-
mitteemen.
By the next rule for the “guidance” of their surgical slavey,
“4. He must give three months' notice of hisintended resignation or retirement.”
They may kick him out at their pleasure, at a moment's notice; but
if he wishes to quit their service, he must give them three months’
warning.
Now come arrangements:-
“II. In regard to his personal accommodation in the º;
“1. He shall have the two back-rooms in the upper storey as his sitting and
bed-rooms."
VOL. xxxv II.
This looks very much like the description of a suite of garrets.
Next—
“2. He shall take his breakfast with the Matron before half-past 9, and his dinner
and tea after 5 in the afternoon, in the Board Room: his luncheon only to be carried
up-stairs to him in his sitting-room.”
These are the paltry requirements and restrictions under which it
pleases these, domineering snobs, to place the private habits of agen:
tleman. If they had not distinctly stated that they wanted a qualified
practitioner for their drudge, one would have concluded the object
contemplated in these despicable ordinances was not a surgeon, but a
surgery-boy. But next to these small statutes come the º
relative to the House-Surgeon's duties, which are of the usual respon-
sible and arduous kind, and include attendance on patients in the
absence of the superior medical officers. Close residence is required.
Smoking is prohibited, of course—not because smoking within the walls
might injure patients; but because old curmudgeons have an idea that
smoking is an exhibition of independence, and therefore invariably for-
bid indulgence, in it to every young man whom they have in their
º Their blackguardly table of rules concludes with this standing
insult:-
“11. Any directions the House-Surgeon may have to give to the General Servants
of the Hospital, are to pass through the Matron.”
and this precious standing order:-
“12. He shall observe all orders of the Managing or House Committee.”
This beats everything. The Committee are to exercise over the
House-Surgeon an authority which is quite divine. He shall serve
them with all his strength. He shall observe all their orders—to do
them. He shall answer their bell, fetch their coals and hot water;
brush their clothes and black their boots. Now, what motive do they
suppºse can induce any young surgeon who understands his profession
to subject himself to their disgusting domination, and accept for remu-
neration his keep, coupled with the necessity of taking his meals with
an old woman, and his lodging, to consist of two back-rooms in the
roof of their hospital? He can have none but imminent starvation, or
the need of opportunity of seeing practice, which he ought not to be in
such extreme want of as he must be to be willing to endure the hard
conditions above º The Governors of every Infirmary, and
particularly those of the Samaritan Free Hospital, should look sharp
after their Committees and take care that the efficiency of their Charity
is not compromised by a board of overbearing, insolent, patronising,
self-interested and vulgar beadles.
OUR CHINESE CEREMONIES.
THE behaviour of Mr. WARD, American Envoy to China at Pekin,
was such as tº give every true, Englishman cause to be proud of his
country. In the account of that minister's yisit to the Chinese capital,
which appeared in the North China Herald touching the question as
to what obeisance should be rendered to the EMPEROR, there occurs
the following passage, the first word of which relates to Kwelliang
the Imperial Commissioner:-
“He sometimes styled the President ta-hwangti, or Great Emperor, and some-
times "President' (a word which he has learnt), and occasionally kiwn-chin, or
princely ruler, to prove his respect for him. Such being the relations between the
two countries, the ko-tau or regular form of obeisance required of envoys from these
nations, i.e., the san-guei-kiu-hoh, “three kneelings and nine knocks," would not be
expected, “but,” said the judge, “one kneeling and three knocks will do for a
friendly power.’”
What was the reply of MR. WARD to the proposal that he should
erform so º and graceful a ceremony? After explaining to
Kweillang that Americans were not accustomed to kneel, except for
the purpose of saying their prayers, he offered the ensuing com-
promise:-
“He would bow very low, and even nine times, if that would add to the solemnity
in their view, or he would stand uncovered during the whole audience, while the
Emperor sat. More than this he would never willingly perform."
The consequence was, that the EMPERoR refused to grant the
American Embassy an interview. This conduct on the part of
MR. WARD is quite of a piece with the sad taste which makes the
American Minister at the British Court attire himself, when he goes
there, in a plain evening dress, instead of adorning his person with a
chocolate-coloured laced coat, an embroidered satin waistcoat, and the
knee-breeches, silk stockings, buckles, and pumps, of an exquisite foot-
man. The Continental nations abuseus for being insular and proud, but
our insularity does not prevent our Court from greatly resembling
that of China; and let us, in the words of KING RICHARD THE THIRD
be thankful for our humility in submitting to wear the decorations of
a lackey in honour of the Crown. Nay, the Speaker of the House
of Commons is, on certain occasions, the º on the part of certain
officers of the House, of demonstrations of profound respect closely
resembling what MR. Warn doubtless, would irreverently describe as
the antic, which he was willing to humour his Cristian Majesty
by performing. We are proud indeed, but proud in the pomp of

Of grief to ancient fogies, and reproof

Last week, a rumour widely blown about,
Walking the windy circle of the Press, ".

Who rule the destinies of Trinity,

Unto the bust of ALFRED TENNyson

Within the Library of Trinity,
Qne great man more o'the house, among the great,
Who grace that still Walhalla, ranged in row,
Along the chequered marbles of the floor, ..
Two stately ranks—to where the fragrant limes
Look thro’ the far end window, cool and green.
A band it is, of high companionship, L-
Chief, NEwton, and the broad-browed WERULAM,
And others only less than these in arts , .
Or science: names that England holds on high.
Among whom, hoped the youth, would soon be set,
The living likeness of a living Bard,
Great ALFRED TENNyson, the Laureate,
Whom Trinity most loves of living sons.
But other thought had WHEWELL and the Dons,

Upon whose greatness Death has set his seal.

“It is too soon,” and when they heard the phrase,
Others caught up the cue, and chorussed #

As if in wrath, WHEwBLL looked up, and said:-
“O Laureate, if indeed you list to try,
and unfix our purpose in this thing.”
hereat full shrilly sang th’excluded bard.
... Soon, soon, so soon! WHEwell looks stern and chill,
Soon, soon, so soon! but I can enter still.”
“Too soon, too soon! You cannot enter now.”
“I am not dead: of that I do repent.
But to my living prayer, oh now relent:”
“Too soon, too soon! You cannot enter now.”
“Honour in life is sweet: my fame is wide
Let me to stand at DRYDEN's, BYRON's side.”
“Too soon, too soon! You cannot enter now.”
“Honour that comes in life is rare as sweet;
I cannot taste it long; for life is fleet.”

“On the occasion of the re-

The opening of an
Italian Opera is generally
attended with some noisy
demonstration. The noise
is usually made by the
orchestra, which, whilst a
young lady on the stage is
singing a love song, sup-
ports her melody with the
clash of cymbals, the clang
of ophicleides, the thunder
of drums, and other appro-
priate and stormy accom-
paniments. The row thus
created...is generally the
composition of SiGNOR
VERDI; but the uproar
which was made the other night at the Opera House at Venice was pro-
bably caused rather by shouting the name of that composer. There is
eyely reasºn to believe that the noisy demonstration cºnsisted in cries
of “Viva VERDI1" translated, if any Britons were included in the
audience, by “VICTOR EMMANUEL for ever! Hip hip hip—hooray!”

THE SHERIFFS SHORN OF THEIR GLORY.
E were sadly grieved to
hear that by a recent
Act of Parliament, the
Sheriffs of London and
Middlesex were exempt-
ed from the necessity of
counting hobnails and
chopping sticks on their
accession to office. Our
sorrow has been mate-
rially lessened by the
information that such
is not exactly the case.
The splendour of the
shrievalty has only been
shorn of this richly ab-
surd ceremonial as far
as regards the publicity
of its performance; but
that is a diminution of
civic dignity which is
very much more than
sufficiently melancholy.
The Sheriffs, up to this
present year, have al-
ways had to count six
horseshoes and certain
hobnails, and chop a
number of faggots, in
proof of their intellec-
up with the end thereof to demonstrate his
sensibility and animation. Then the Sheriffs
roved that they had the use of their intel-
ects and their hands; and, after having been
solemnly chaffed by the learned Judge, went on
their way rejoicing in their honour and glory.
Now, this august exhibition is no longer to be
made in open Court. It is to take place pri-
vately before officers appointed for the purpose.
In the presence of these witnesses the Sheriffs
are to chopsticks and count horseshoes as before,
to render suit and service on behalf of the Cit
for certain manors—it is pretended. This is º

are retained, as they were originally j.

A NEW IDEE NAPOLEONIENNE.
EveRYBODY knows that loyalty just now is, in a rampant, state in
France, and everybody therefore will easily believe that the height to
which it reaches in its rampant elevation proves, every now and then,
to be the height of absurdity. . As a case in point, we cite this inte-
resting paragraph, on which faute de mieur, sub-editors have lately
laid their scissors?—
“A PRESENT of TURNIPs To THE EMPERob of THE FRENCH.-Bullier's Litho-
ſphic Sheet gives the following curious letter, as having been addressed to the
SMPERoR NAPoleon. It was detained at the Office for Examining Petitions to His
Majesty:—‘Sir, –Being the possessor of a small property in the Beaujoles, favoured
by a good soil for wine and turnips, and on Wednesday, my wife having made us
a soup of these turnips, I found the taste so exquisite and so sweet, that the idea of
our dear Emperor instantly occurred to me, and I said to my wife and my two sons,
‘Their Majesties perhaps have not a better º Then a happy inspiration passed
through the mind of my eldest son, and he said, “Father, you ought to send a cask
to their Majesties.' Sire, we are giving effect to the idea. May the vegetables be
eeable to you, and we shall esteem ourselves so fortunate to have procured you
that trifling pleasure. (We have more of them still.) I am, with the most profound
respect, Sire, your very humble and very devoted subject, P. BolMont, Shirt-maker
at Koissay (Ain).' This letter was followed by a second, in which P. BolMont
prayed that his eldest son (he who had conceived such an excellent idea) might be
exempted from military service.”
The Office for Examining Petitions to the EMPEROR may be, and
doubtless is, a highly useful institution, and saves his Majesty no doubt
a vast amount of needless labour. Nevertheless, with all due deference
to those who have its management, we think that presents and
petitions such as those mentioned above, clearly qught to be allowed to
reach their destination. The examiners, no doubt daily do the State
some service by opening and “detaining” suspicious-looking presents ;
and many an infernal machine directed “For the Emperor,” may by
such detention be kept from doing damage to him. But to detain a
gift so harmless as a cask of turnips savours to our mind of quite
unnecessary caution, and rather seems to indicate a relish for those
vegetables on the part of the official examiners themselves.
. At all events, we think that, even were they justified in their deten-
tion of the present, there was obviously no reason why the letter which
came with it should not have reached the EMPEROR. It might have
been thought prudent not to let his Majesty have soup made of the
turnips, for fear they º: be poisoned, or might disagree with him;
but we cannot see what harm the letter could have done him. On the
contrary, we think it would have given him great pleasure; especially
the passage where the writer naively says, that so sweet was the
taste of the turnips in his mouth that “the idea of our dear EMPEROR
instantl . to me.”. The notion that a turnip should remind
one of the EMPEROR is quite a new idée Napoléonienne to think of, and
we feel assured his Majesty could not but have been flattered by it.
There is yet one more reflection suggested by the paragraph, which
it may not }. quite profitless just now for us to make. Qld women (of
both sexes) who next to talking scandal love to talk about invasion
represent the French as panting, to a man, to be let loose on us, an
burning, every one of them, to make us feel their might... Now, if the
fears of these old ladies have not frightened them quite out of the
small wits they have been blessed with, they may derive some consq-
lation from the purport of the second of the letters above mentioned,
which may be fairly taken as a sample of French spirit, as throughout
the country doubtless it is actually distilled. . While French fathers do
their best to get their sons exempt from service, it is clear their martial
spirit is anything but ardent: and while in France a soldier is esteemed
. equal value to a cask of turnips, none surely but the turnip-headedest
of mortals need feel the slightest fear of Frenchmen risking lives so
precious by attempting to invade us.

A HARD CONSERVATIVE HIT.
At the late Conservative dinner at Rochdale, MAJOR EdwardEs
made some diverting observations. For example, after having boasted
that he had always spoken in favour of good old Tory principles, he
made the following remark about PALMERston and Russell –
“They were both intent upon mischief, and they would both do their utmost to
keep the Conservative party out of power, because they were greedy of the loaves
and fishes. (Loud cheers and tº”
The auditors of the gallant Major laughed at the foregoing specimen
of his eloquence, some for one reason, some for another, ºf ... for
a third. The first division laughed because they really believed that
the views of the present, Premier and Foreign Secretary are simply
mercenary; that § hold office wholly and solely for the sake of their
pensions; which probably was what MAJOR EDwARDEs meant to say;
and that in saying so the Major had made a good joke at the two noble
lords’ expense. The second class were constrained to laugh out of
their sleeve, instead of in it, by construing the orator's assertion to
mean that LQRD PALMERSTóN and LoRD John would endeavour to
exclude the Conservative party from power because the Conservatives
were actuated by interested motives. This part of the audience
laughed as some gentlemen may be observed to do when they are play-
fully called rogues—conscious subjects of the pleasantry, and hugging
themselves in the fun which therefore tickles them. The remaining
portion of the assembly perceived that MAJOR Edwardes's imputation
was open to º; constructions, and good-humouredly laughed
at its post-prandial ambiguity.
BELOW RAREY.
MR. RAREY has been lecturing in Dublin before the Lord Lieu-
tenant and suite. The newspaper paragraph, which mentioned this
fact, further announced that—
“MR. RAREY will deliver his second lecture on Saturday next, when he stated
that a very vicious horse would be operated upon."
It was whispered that the brute which MR. RAREY proposed to
tame, was no other than the furious kicking and plunging animal
named QULLEN. But CULLEN is not a subject for MR; Y; he
has published a pastoral, which proves that he is no horse, but of
a lower order of animals.

baby after him, you have a right to apply to that gentle-
man for a sovereign or two, in the child's name. The
MARquis of WesTMINstER usually sends a £5 note in
such cases. The Nurse is the proper person to send to
Grosvenor Gate.
Lettv The Brown GIRL.—If your love for him be so
intense and disinterested as you describe it, we think
that you should not have refused to say “Yes” until
you had seen the receipt for his current half-year's life
assurance. You should have taken his word, and the
entry he showed you in his Letts's Diary, that he had
paid it. Still, in these days, young girls cannot be too
careful.
Edward CLoddon is very anxious for an introduction to a
refined family, in which there are some elegant young
ladies. His laudable object is not so much matrimony,
for he has no money, as to be induced gradually to wean
himself from the habits of inebriation, keeping his hat
on in a room, wearing muddy boots, and smoking a
short clay pipe. He thinks that in time, if he had fami-
liar access to such a household, he might be cured of
some, if not all, of these practices. Any West End
family uesiring such a guest can write to Mr. Punch.
Axion WIRTUTIs says that he never goes to a friend's house
without feeling an almost irresistible desire to steal the
spoons. He asks, is this a crime? Certainly not; it is
mere organisation: and if you wish for the spoons, what
are a few ounces of white metal compared to a fellow-
creature's happiness? No true friend would grudge you
such a trifle.
MARIA.—We can hardly advise you how to turn your
Grecian nose into a ne: retroussé, which you say FREDE-
Rick likes; but something may be done by rubbing it
upwards whenever you use your pocket-handkerchief,
and §: thinking constantly of handsomer girls than
yourself.
A YouNo READER is informed that the beautiful lines–
“How doth the little busy bee
Improve each shining hour,”
are Lord ByRox's. They occur in Lalla Rookh, where
Roderick Dhu, the Last of the Goths, reproaches Clara
Were de Vere for idleness.
EleonorA X.—The author you name is one of the most
virtuous as well as one of the handsomest men of the
day; but as he has already three wives, and is engaged
six deep, your chance is almost hopeless. Still, send him
the £500 note, under cover to us.
LEcton Insipicus asks who is the author of the lines–
“Twinkle, twinkle, little cow,
How I wonder at you, how !
Up above the world so bright,
Warm, and fresh, and sweet, and white.”
We do not remember to have met with them, but they
read like Cowley.
SARAH JANE DoddRidor.—Although we think that meta-
physical disquisition is not properly within the range of
a secular periodical, we have no objection to reply to
your º: and say that we do not believe corn-p
ters to anything but palliatives, and that you must
get the corn out.
A Coxscientious Flux Kry.-"Not at home" is a means
§..."; persons' feelings. “Out” would be a false-
hood. If you were to say “Engaged,” a caller might
wish to wait; if you were to say “Does not wish to see
anybody,” vanity instantly whispers that an exception
is or ought to be made in the inquirer's case. Whereas,
“Not at home” means anything or nothing, and the
visitor goes away tranquil. If you were our Jeames,
and intruded on your betters with scruples of the kind,
you would be served as the elder Nicholas was by the
Saint of that name in MR. BARHAM's ballad.
MaadALENE.-We pity your taste; but if you think a
spangled officer, who wears his golden epaulettes upon
his brow, a nobler being in the scale of creation than your
despised ironmonger, take Mars and leave Wulcan.
KIREs.-No person who wishes to be in health will walk
less than a quarter of a mile daily, unless the weather is
bad, or the exertion exceedingly distasteful.
sleep we take, the better. The poets have said, “How
ºtu. is sleep;" and, besides, we knew it without
them.
STUDious SAMUEL has burned down several houses, in con-
sequence of his habit of reading after going to bed at
night. He asks us whether he ought to discontinue the
Fº We can only say, that if such trifles deter
im from improving his mind, he has taken a name
which he does not deserve.
KMAve or Clues.—Your friend may have been somewhat
hasty in throwing the cards in your face, and knocking
you down with the candlestick; but if we had been your
opponent, and you had said “How Hot," and your
partner had played two Hearts, we should have shied a
tumbler at you.
The more
G.FLETCHER.—We read all the plays you sent, and thought
them very good; but, unfortunately, our laundress has
disposed of them, by mistake, to a butter merchant,
whose name the poor woman cannot remember. You
had better write some more, and keep copies this time.
A Thoughtful GLAzikr.—Divide the rectilinear arc of
polarity by the cube of arithmetical parallelopipedal
progression, and the product will be what you ought to
pay for putty.
A LovER or HIs Country.—Training a Rifle Corps does
not exempt you from all taxation of every kind what-
ever; but if enough lovers of their country join, it may
exempt MR. GLAnston R from the necessity of putting on
some more taxation to carry on a war. As to your
squint, we see no objection to that; indeed, it may help
to deceive an invading enemy.
A Constant READER.—Nay, with pleasure. Besides, is
it not everyone's duty to inform those who are less
instructed than himself? R. I. P. in an obituary means
“Respected in the parish."
PEstERATus.-No, it is undoubtedly unlawful for you to
fire a pistol at a person bringing lº a writ, or a sub-
poona. We are not so sure about the case of a County
Court summons ; but #. had, perhaps, better take
counsel's opinion before discharging the weapon.
J. V. P.-Nothing is more snobbish than imagining offences,
or taking them where they are not intended. If he called
you an everlasting idiot, with no more brains than a
pumpkin, and not half so much heart as a cabbage, we
suppose it was only in playful badimage. If, as you say,
it was before ladies, this proves it was only in fun; for
who quarrels in their presence? You had better beg his
pardon for having been irritated.
Ebon Ax sends us a packet of original articles, and promises
to sead a hamper of game. If he will be kind enough to
send the hamper, and send for the original articles, we
shall be much obliged.
A SINcene ADMIRER.—We don't want any advice; and if
you don't like us, you needn't take us in. Is it you, do
you think, or we, who are obliged by your paying three-
pence for a casket of unequalled wit and inimitable wis-
dom? Better consider that problem before you talk of
patronising. We patronise you, and creation generally.
Betry.-Go to bed.
DAMox AND PyTHIAs.-It is not a good thing to see two
brothers so intimate and inseparable. When you see it,
you may conclude that there are some discreditable
family secrets, which each is afraid the other will reveal
if allowed to form a new friendship.
BLAck-Eyed Susan.-And he had a perfect right to give
you the black eye, if you used the language you mention.
No man likes to be told that he is losing his figure.
A You Na NATURAL1st.—A fungus is not quadruped,
as your cousin asserts, but a uniped. We agree with
you that the flavour is rather inane, and so thought
LActantius WARRo, when he wrote Fungar inani
fattnere.
Phoebe ANN.—With every disposition to promote the
marriages of our fair correspondents, we are unable to
agree with you that a young gentleman's asking you
whether you did not think Walworth a nice place to live
in (he living there) is such an offer of marriage as will
enable you to bring an action for breach of promise.
Try to get him to be more gushing.
FuRiosus.-We see no objection to your going, as pro-
posed, to Bath, nor indeed, when there, to your getting
your head shaved.
UltcK Theodorr: O'Banks.-We have destroyed your
address, and burned all your manuscripts, and if you
come bothering us any more, we have left orders in the
office that whoever is on duty shall forthwith punch
your head, and then take you to the police-station
across the street. Now don't provoke us to harsher
methods of getting rid of an Irish poet.
FRANcks-Philippa-Your case is a very hard one. Your
husband avails himself of your habit of lying in bed
to breakfast and read novels, to help himself to the
best of the coffee. It is mean in him, but you are with-
out remedy. You might, however, revenge yourself by
giving the servant a hint to boil his eggs hard, and
frizzle his bacon to chips.
A Lovka of Stahrs.-The tenure by which the DUKE of
WellingtoN holds Apsley House is his exhibiting
every room in it to any person whose name is either
Aarhua, WELLEslwy (or WEslky), DUKE, or WELLING-
Tox,-in short who has either the Christian name or
surname of the Great Duke. Your card is generally
sufficient, but it is best to take your baptismal cer-
tificate, lest the porter should be in a bad humour.
A BEREAved ONE.-Your lines to the memory of a Belov’d
Huncle are not deficient in sentiment, but would not be
generally interesting. People don't care about their
uncles. And what is the meaning of the line—
“Thy spirrit could not Mix with Common Clay.”
Did not the old *...* like his pipe with his glass of
grog In that case he was a Nass, and unworthy of
your Muse.
Anthony Rowlry.—You have no right to have your in-
dentures cancelled because your master insists on your
washing †. face every day. We allow that he is a
tyrannical brute, but such is the law of England.
Ixquin ER.—Colney Hatch is so called from the great
number of conies which used to be hatched there. To
take their eggs was felony under the forest laws of our
barbarous ancestors.
Fasberic PETERson (Lambeth) wants to be told, privately,
“who Schillen was.” We grant no private replies,
and suspect that there are so many hº of persons
who would like to ask the same question, that our public
answer will be a favour. Schiller was a Hungarian,
who fought under the banner of Don Juan of Austria,
in his campaigns against the Spaniards; and having
been wounded at the capture of Hohenlinden, was con-
verted to Lutheranism by the celebrated Bossurr, and
afterwards wrote the famous Works of Rabelais, which
he dedicated to CAthen INE DE' Medicis. He died a Car.
thusian; and his widow, re-marrying, espoused Hor Ack
WALPole. Now you know as much as Wiscount
WILLIAMs.
Thrspian ENsis.-We have repeatedly said that we will
not undertake to give either the ages, heights, or
weights of actors and actresses. We believe, however,
that MR. B. WEastER is not more than seven feet high,
and that he never played before KING CHARLes The
Second. Ma. CHARLes MAthews has been vaccinated.
You have no right to take a church hassock into the
ſº and put it on to the seat to make you sit higher, as,
f we sat behind you, you should find.
LITTLE JEREMIAH keeps pickles in a currant jelly pot in
his bed-room, and puts them on a chair by his bedside
at night, that he may eat them when he wakes in the
morning. His father threatens him with meat to his
pickles, namely, cold pig, if he perseveres in this
epicureanism. The poor boy should plead the pedigree
of a pickle, as deduced by a celebrated etymologist.
King Jeremiah, Jeremiah King, Jerry King, Gherkin,
Pickled Cucumber.
EMMA's Sisten.—Your poetry is very charming, and had
we space we should have great pleasure in publishing
it all. As it is, we must find room for a scrap :-
I know I AM. A. PRETTY Gial.
I know I am a pretty girl,
Although my cousins sneer,
My teeth are all as white as pearl,
My eyes are bright and clear.
My foot is very small and neat
(To mention it's no blame),
But what is most divinely sweet,
My Henry thinks the same.
And I can sing, and I can waltz,
And make a pudding, too,
And if I have some little faults,
I shall not tell them you.
My hair has got a natural curl,
AMELIA is my name;
I know I am a pretty girl,
And Henry thinks the same.
Go on, dear, music publishers eagerly pay for much
worse songs than that, and some composers think them
“capital words.”
MATILDA and Rosy have had their fortunes told by an old
woman in the Westminster Road, and they want to
know whether we think there is “anything in it,” as
she certainly told them some extraordinary truths. She
told MATILDA that something would reach her ears that
would surprise her, and sure enough next day her
mother gave her a sound slap on each side of the face
for impertinence. Rosy was told that she would shortly
have a loss, and in three days she lost her place for
reading the Sorrows of an Unhappy One, while she let
the mutton be roasted to a cinder. Our young friends
seem fair samples of a fortune-teller's clients, and
nothing we could say would do them any good.
A BEGINNER.—Leave off.
A GRAvesend Belle complains of the young men of that
metropolis, who, she says, seem afraid to speak to a
girl when they have been introduced to her, though
they are impudent enough before introduction, and
stare at you like—we are sorry to say we cannot print
her porcine illustration. Perhaps her hints may do them
good, but we always thought them muffs.
Hoangscus.-Your song of the Night Mare, your Ode
written on a Dissecting Room Table, your Lines on
Galvanising a Deceased Donkey, and your Chants of
the Cemetery and Catacombs, are all extremely elegant
and highly creditable to you, but we fear might not be
acceptable to nervous readers. We give a specimen :-
Then under his ear in terror and fear,
The galvanical wire they apply,
And the Donkey he opened his ugly mouth,
And winked with his fishy º
His leg it swung round, and behold on the ground
Five students are stretched in a row,
And the electrician, in sad condition,
Cried, “Well, if that ain't a Go.”
BARBARA.—It is certainly “very unlucky to cut your
finger nearly off on a Friday,” but we should not con-
sider it an instance of the very highest good fortuneif we
achieved that feat on any other day of the week. Yes,
any girl who cuts all the bread and butter for the
family is a good girl, and ought to have an addition to
her pecuniary allowance.
Antiquanian.—The Edgeware-road is so called from
there being nothing sold in the shops but cutlery.
Miss LAURA MAcoaroon.—Saturate the hair every night
with syrup of poppies to which a gill of maraschino has
been added; flour the head well, and let the mixture
remain in the hair all night. You will find your hair
thick enough in the morning. . If you cannot get
maraschino, treacle and the yolk of egg will do.

no one ever dreams of
being merciful to either.
He gets, imposed on
right and left, in per-
son and in purse. Bores

and have no fear of
being kicked. The re-
motest of relations act
towards him as though
they claimed the closest
consanguinity, and
thereby were entitled
to be worse plagues
rfect strangers play the part of dearest friends,
to dº in on him at any time. As for needy visitors,
he has them thick as thieves, and few leave him without making an attempt upon his pocket.
Bosom friends unbosom their family misfortunes to him, and do their best to make him
miserable by the story of their sorrows. . Yet of all these pests and plagues, none have the
least compunction or compassion in their plaguings. However they may pester him they
feel quite sure he Doesn't Mind it!
In fact, the Man who Doesn't Mind is perpetually exposed to all manner of annoyances
and physical privations. Everybody takes advantage of the goodness of his nature. It
subjects him to insult as well as inconvenience. People stamp on his pet corns, and scarcely
ever beg his pardon. However much they hurt him, they conceive he Doesn't Mind it,
and rely he won't take steps to avenge the pedal injury. When he goes out to dinner
he is always the worst served and the worst seated of the guests. He gets the backbones o
the fowls, and the sc of legs of mutton. No host, ever dreams of giving him tit-bits,
The chances are, indeed, that if the table's at all full he'll be moved off to the sideboard, and
have to eat his dinner among dirty plates and dishes. People take for granted that he
Doesn't Mind where he's put.
At a picnic, too, he finds his fate is just as sad a one. If there happen to be any
children, to be looked to, you may always, take for granted that he's the happy man. , And
besides being appointed to the charge of the light infantry, he is sure to be entrusted with
the heavy baggage also. The commissariat department devolves mainly on his shoulders.
Whoever really is in fault, he is answerable for all its imperfections and deficiencies. When

it happens that the knives and forks are left behind, everybody makes the most cutting of
remarks to him, and digs at him unpityingly with some three-pronged sarcasm, Supposing
such a wonderful accident occur, as that by some strange accident the salt should be
forgotten, of course the Man who Doesn't Mind is told to go and forage for some, and not
to leave a farm-house unattacked until he gets it. Then having duly done what was required
of him as errand boy, of course he is expected to officiate as waiter; and should he steal
time in his waitership to get a snack himself, he is pretty sure to find his seat assigned him
in the nettles, or else where all the broken crockery and lobster-shells are shot. And to
wind up his day's misery, should it rain going home, as it always does at picnics, of course he
is expected to sit patiently outside ...i lend his rival his umbrella; and not to show the
slightest º of annoyance, though he detects that rival, under cover of that umbrella,
flirting fiercely with the widow with whom he himself is smitten!
In short, wherever he may be, and whatever he may do, the Man who Doesn't Mind is
never thought of for a moment, except as a convenience. Whatever foible he ma have, he
never, finds it gratified. His known “little weaknesses” are wholly disregarded. . No one
ever dreams of studying his comforts. Like the desires of Mr. Toots, his most heart-cherished
wishes are considered. ‘of no consequence.”. However useful he may be, no one ever
thinks of even saying, Thank you. Nor is he allowed any periods of respite. If on Monday
he does a service for a friend, on Tuesday the friend s and makes him do another. Any
one, at any time, may ask him to do anything. Whatever hobbies, he may have, people
never give him time to mount a single one of them. They interrupt him just when getting
his foot well into the stirrup, and never have a fear that, he will venture to kick out at them.

But the worst of it is, that in time even his

seeing how his friends_treat him, she learns to
do the same herself. In her domestic calcula:
tions she puts him down as a mere cipher, and

he expects him to go º with her twice
a-week at least, and to do light porter's work,
and carry home her purchases. She even dares
to try if she can feed him on cold mutton, and
she does so with impunity, and even without
pickles; and . she never dreams of palliating
that connubial offence by the after-introduction
of his favourite pudding. At least twice in
every month she asks her “dear Mamma” to
come and stay a week with her, and then, coolly
fills his dressing-room with the parental pugs
and parrots. Of course it gets the smell of a
travelling menagerie. ... But she dreads not the

LEGISLATING FOR THE MILLION.
THE Financial Reformer, a work whose facts
are figures, informs us that every General Elec-
tion costs the successful Candidates the expen-
diture of a million sterling. What it costs the
unsuccessful ditto would º a strong arith-
metical head to calculate. hy should not the
nation have the benefit of that million outlay ?
Why should it all go into the pockets of the
Electors, and so feed their corruption? Since
it is seemingly impossible to put down bribery,
since Members themselves, who should be the
very last to violate the law, are generally the
first to break it, we would recommend that
each seat be put up to auction, and knocked
down to the highest bidder. It would then be
an open commercial transaction, instead of
being a secret one. At present, votes are grown
much as mushrooms are—by being cultivated in
the dark. You sow your money, keep it
thoroughly dark, and in a very short time you
have a beautiful crop of votes, warranted to give
an extra enjoyment to the dinner of any Candi-
date who has the good fortune, thanks to his
Fortunatus's purse, to be elected. Why should
not the nation have the advantage of the mone
that is spent at every election, instead of its iſ
dropping into the cash-boxes, of the hungry
lawyers, and ...; to overflow the tills of
the thirsty publicans -
We would have a regularly: º: public
auctioneer, whose office it should be to regulate
the sale and transfer of Parliamentary seats, and
the Carlton and the Reform Clubs might be
established as agencies. The House of Com-
mons itself might be selected as the Great Poli-
tical Auction Mart, where these seats should be
put up for sale; and, with a little spirited bid.
ding, we will warrant that the million sterling,
which is at present, the estimated cost of a
General Election, might easily be worked up to
two or three millions, and the national exche-
quer would be the gainer by it, Make this happy
arrangement, and CARDEN might again come into
Parliament, and the wealthy LEATHAMs might
traffic §§ in the purchase of a seat, without
being considered in the least disreputable.
Truth is Strange.
WHEN Cuddesden College was finished, the
Builder thought fit to cut the initials of the
Founder, the Bishop of OxFord, and of the first
appointed President, the Rev. ALFRED Potts,
over the entrance, when there appeared—
|S. O. A. P. The inscription has been removed.
A STUPID REMARK.—As there is no House
of Lords in America, a Yankee is justified in
bragging about his “Peerless Country.”

A boy is brought before SIR
PETER, charged with an alleged
attempt to pick a pocket. No
witness appears who can de-
pose to the offence, and the
ground on which the
cutor solely rests, the charge
is, that, he fancied “he felt a

evidence adduced that the boy

THE BRASS BAND BURGLARS.
EveRY now and then when Parliament is up, and sub-editors are
verging on despair for want of “copy,” we see extracts from old
journals stuck into the newspapers to refresh us as to what went on a
undred years , and remind us how much better we are off than
Were our i.º. One of the many points wherein our better-
offishness is specially paraded is the fact, that, owing to our excellent
}: our persons and our purses are less subject to attack, and our
ouses and our streets kept in much greater security. If we chance to
stop out late, there are no Mohawks now o' mights to bully us; and
we can come home from our clubs at any hour we please, without a
fear of being knocked down and half-murdered by a foot-pad. More-
over, when we go to bed we can sleep in peace and comfort, undis-
turbed by any dread lest our house be broken into. A 1, we feel sure,
is at the corner of the street, if indeed he be not supping in our very
kitchen; and with such a cherub sitting up to watch for us, what
nonsense it would be to feel nervous about burglars.
To show, in fact, how thoroughly our safety is protected, and how in
every way a Briton's house is now his castle, we need but cast a glance
at the following Police case, which a day or two ago was reported in
the papers:–
“MARLBorough STREET.-John SUMMERLAD, a German, one of a brass band of
musicians, was charged before MR. BINGHAM with persisting in playing an instru-
ment of music in Queen Street. Mayfair, after he was required to desist, in conse-
*: º * and with assaulting DR. Robrat TEMPLE FRERE, Physician, No.
9. in that stree
'" Dr. Fºrº said, the defendant and others planted themselves in front of his
house at seven the previous evening, and cºmmenced playing instruments of music. fel
His mother being seriously ill in the house, he sent his servant to require them to
desist. The answer being that they had been paid to play, and should not give over
without being paid more to do so, he went himself and told them to stop, and the
reason there was for doing so. The defendant, who was the most prominent, still
refused, telling him he had no power to prevent their music. They had for about
half a minute ceased, and then began afresh. In vain he begged of them to give
over, and while they *::::: the defendant in particular became exceedingly abusive,
telling him he knew English law better than he did, and no one had a right to stop
them. While looking for a policeman they played out their tune, and he followed
them into Chesterfield Street, where they re-commenced. While here the defend-
ant impudently told him he should not have his share unless he went round with
the hat. Here they did not stay long, and he on the look out for a constable, fol-
lowed them still, they every now and then running up against and hustling him ;
the defendant, with the º: of a music stand under his arm, swinging the
same out and aside, so as to knock him on the face with them, of which he, hurt at
the time, had the mark remaining. To protect himself from this violence he with
his hand pushed him off, and the defendant purposely fell, and then charged him
with knocking him down and doing damage to his instrument to the extent of six
guineas. At this moment a policeman came in sight, and he gave defendant into
custody.
“The defendant, in reply, said he had only been a fortnight in London from Hessen,
in Germany, and four days back joined the band. He then read a paper in his defence,
in which he said he was at a loss to understand why he had been fixed on as the
chief offender, for he did go when the rest went, and was thrown down by the com:
plainant, and had his instrumeurt crushed in the fall; that the Magistrate would
doubtless consider him as the injured person, the complainant having dealt out his
own law by upsetting him, and that he looked now for the Magistrate's protection
as a foreigner of recent arrival.
“MR. BINGHAM, having explained the law to the defendant, sentenced him to pay
a fine of 40s., or be imprisoned for a month.”
This case, we repeat, is taken from the papers, not of a hundred
i. ago, but of scarce a fortnight since. It proves, as we have said,
ow much we have advanced in point of street-security; and those
noodles who affect to admire the good old times, may take comfort in
reflecting that, after all, our progress in such matter is not great.
Notwithstanding the invention of gaslight and police, bands of highway
robbers still infest our streets, and steal away our comfort, if they
cannot filch our cash. If we are ill, and just dozing off to sleep,
like Macbeth, they “murder sleep;” if well, and just sitting down to
work, they plant themselves directly underneath our “study” (!)
window, and, unless we pay them hush-money, blow our brains out. .
We think then that such ruffians as John SUMMERLAD aforesaid
should be charged with something more than merely an assault, when
detected in such acts as those above narrated. To break into a house
for the purpose of extracting money from its inmates.--if this be not
“flat burglary,” we should like to know what is: and we think that
burglars §§ alike be punishable, whether they go to work with
crowbars or trombones. We trust when Parliament next meets, there
will be a due revision of the law upon this point... We should like to
see our Magistrates empowered to deal summarily with culprits like
this SUMMERLAD, and enabled to convict them of a crime not short of
elony whenever, as in his case, the burglary was proved to be accom-
panied by violence. Meanwhile, worthy MR. BINGHAM has our thanks
and kvěos for turning his deaf ear to the said beggar's petition, and
paying no heed to the “paper” which he read in his defence.

GUY FAWKES FOR 1859,
THE LAW ON ITS LAST LEGS.
It really almost takes our mental breath away to think of it, but if something be not
done to he F." foster their vitality, we fear the race of lawyers will soon become extinct.
They will be numbered before long with the lost tribes of Israel, and the Lane of Chancery
will know their face no more. The few surviving members, who have more longevity
left them than the rest, will be found with, empty blue-bags at the corners of the streets,
waiting, anxious-eyed to run, or rather hobble off, on errands, as rapidly and far as their
fast failing strength will suffer them. ... Or haply we shall find them crouching curled up On
the pavement, with the sad words “I am Starving /* chalked close beneath their noses,
and a basket for stray coppers held between their teeth.
At the Meeting of the Law Association held the other day, the speakers spoke most
mournfully about their ſº prospects, and many made allusion to the “rainy day” in
store for them, as though there was small chance of their getting an umbrella. The Chair.
man was perhaps the most desponding of the orators, and his oration reads more like a dying
speech, and last confession than any other form of words to which we can compare it.
lenda est Lea was the text on which he preached, and heartrending indeed were the
remarks which he poured forth on it. He plainly
told his hearers that owing to the so-called
“amendment” of the law, they were progressing
fast in a canine direction, or in vulgar parlance,
they were # to the dogs. He declared that
it surprised him they continued to exist; but
he predicted their supplies would fall short be-
fore long, and that they would have to leave
off living upon nothing, and appeal in formá
pauperis to the §. for support.
| But this legal Jeremiah did not content him-
self with simply lamenting his sad plight, and
the sad plight of all those whom, in a legal point
of view, he regarded as his i...."; closed
his Lamentation with something strangely like a
threat, and to his Jeremiad imparted what
savoured very strongly of the Jeremy Diddler
flavour. Speaking, clearly for the purpose of
catching the public ear and “seriously in-
clining” it to that attitude of interest which is
assumed # ears when pricked up by a threat
that they’ll be boxed, or that something else to
8. vantage is in store for them, said the
| “It may not be desirable that we should be too rich:
|but there is a proverb which says, that it is a difficult
| thing to keep an empty sack upright, and I am sure it is
very lesirable for the public that we should not be too
| poor.
| So, according to this gentleman, honesty with
lawyers is an article of luxury, and unless they
are well off, they find they can't afford it. When
a lawyer begins to go down in the world, he
gives up his honesty as he would his carriage,
and pursues his path of plunder contentedly on
foot, until he can afford to be honest and to ride
again. To be upright he considers is a matter
not of conscience, but merely of the pocket.
Like one of those toy figures which are kept
upright by the swinging balance of a weight, a
lawyer is kept upright only by a swingeing
balance at his banker's.
Such at least is what we gather from the
º ": have º: The hint *: it is diffi-
cult to keep poor lawyers upright, appears to
our mind ca sº of no other construction. As
with other beasts of prey, the conduct of a
lawyer is dependent on his appetite. If you
keep your cat well fed, it won't do you much
mischief; and while a lawyer is well-fee'd he
will not show his teeth much. But depend on
it, as soon as either beast feels pinched, he'll
betake himself to thieving without the slightest
scruple, and lay his claws on everything that
comes within his reach.
A CANDIDATE FOR AN INSTITUTION.
UNDER the head of “Undergraduate Extra-
vagance at Cambridge,” the Times relates a
County Court case in which MR. EARDLEY
GIDEoN CULLING EARDLEY, a young gentleman
who has lately come of age, not to say, arrived
at years of discretion,-was sued for the price
of some pictures and a map, bought by him,in
his minority. His bills incurred for similar
trifles were said to amount to £16,000. On
examination, this frugal youth stated that—
“He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and
also a member of the Society of Denmark, and he ex-
ted to be a member of the Society of St. Luke at
ome."
This is apparently a young man of great ex
ectations. The membership of the Society o
t. Luke at Rome is one of them which may
perhaps be realised; but the expectant seems
to stand a much better chance of being admitted
into the Society of St. Luke in Old Street.

HUMPTY DUMPTY.
THE SCHILLER CENTENARY.
THE question keeps recurring to us, Will Punch have a Centenary?
and if so, where on earth will the event be celebrated? The Crystal
Palace may suffice for the Centenaries of ScHILLER, of HANDEL, or of
BURNs; but will it be found big enough to hold the million upon
million worshippers of Punch? Our own impression is that, decidedly,
it won't. Indeed, we shrink not from predicting that a Punch's
CRystAL PALAce will have to be erected expressly for the purpose of
keeping his Centenary; and some faint notion, may be formed of the
dimensions of this edifice, when we prophesy that ships of twice the
size of the Great Eastern will float like toys in the big fountain basin
in the central transept.
Meanwhile, let not the thoughts of the stupendous sights in store
for it, distract the public eye and mind from sights which are now
visible, and which, like those at Sydenham, are in general worth look-
ing at. Until the Punch º comes, the now existing Crystal
Palace will doubtlessly suffice for the keeping of Centenaries. How
many will be kept there before the Crystal Palace has to celebrate its
own, is a problem which we leave to stronger minds to calculate. Had
we not good faith in the good taste of the Crystal Palace Management,
we should almost fear their mania for the keeping of Centenaries
would induce them to keep such as were scarce worthy to be kept. If
the mania spreads much, Centenaries will soon be ; thick as tax-
atherers, and the friends of any Anybody will get them for the asking.
f the maniabenot checked, we may live to seeitmooted, Shall CATNAch
have a Centenary f and the lovers of street organs, who have no ear
for any music except that turned off by Handle, may like to get up a
Centenary for that delightful genius by whom the art of organ-grinding
was first introduced.
As we got into the train which rattled us, on Thursday, to “Der
Crystal Palast Schillerfest,” we seemed naturally to get into a train of
thought like this. Our thought-train was however soon taken off the
line, or at least we had to shunt it to make room for another. This
we started from our mental terminus upon perusal of the following
most mind-stirring remarks, which in German and in English, or at
least in German-English, prefaced a short sketch of Schiller's life
and works, expressly written to be read upon the day of hi
Centenary:-
“Hundred years ago on this very day, the creative power of Providence poured
one of the greatest poetical talents of modern times into a mortal mould.
Hundred yearsfull of terrible events (erschütternder Ereignisse) passed away in the
everflowing stream of time (sind in dem weekselmden Strom der ewigstarren Zeit
versunken und verschunden). Hundred years!—and joyfully-shouting we see in all
parts of our little planet men, unite in order to celebrate the birth of one de-
parted long ago (um die Menschwerdung eines längst Dahingeschiedenen sufeierm 1)."
. After this big-sounding flourish the word-piler subsides into more
simple language, thus:—
“What is it which excites the Germans on this day, at home not less than abroad,
in the North South East and West, on the shores of the icy Neva as well as on the
freier º the º. of ignorance?
thundering (stiirmenden) Niagara, on the Danube as well as on the banks of the
Ohio, ** even on the gold-filled rivers of California? What makes them at home
forgetful of the troubles and cares of their everyday life, their pitiful (kläglich) po-
litical position, the dissension of parties, the want of a happy independance (an
What silences abroad the
German's woefu wº for a Fatherland, his restless chase after mortal goºds, his
hope for gain f hat concentrates and moves all his thoughts and feelings as so
many sparkling planets round one bright sun-light?"
To these poetic questions the brutal and prosaic mind might haply
answer—BEER! If anything can excite a German, it is Beer! If any-
thing can make him sparkle, it is Beer! So at least thinks vulgar
ignorance, and shallow-brained conventionality, Psha! bah! pooh!
Out upon such brutal and untimely jesting ! To-day no thought or
taste of beer is in the German's mind or mouth. What brightens and
excites him on the memorable Tenth is—
“The heartfelt remembrance of the birth of our great and immortal poet, philo-
sopher, and historian, FRIEDRich Schillen ; who, by stepping into the light of this
world, became for ever a beaming light on the horizon of poetry.”
To this we, mentally of course, gave a plauditory “hear!” and then
skipping the biography, which was, an insult to our memory, we read
with mingled rapture, awe and wonder, this:—
“It would be now the moment to establish through Germany's vast provinces a
brotherly unity in political life: for we have proved on the occasion of SchillER's
Festival that the Germans have, in fact, a Fatherland. A great, far-spread, bound-
less country ! (weit ausgeulehntes, unermessliches /) The empire of thought, imagina-
tion, and civilisation There dwell the Germans creating in all the corners and
parts of our terrestrial globe (in allen Winkln und Gegenden des Erdballs), “swelling
sternity but by grains of sand, putting their shoulders to the wheels of progress at
the slowly-moving coach of universal civilisation.”
This picture of the Germans putting their shoulders to the wheels of
the coach of civilisation so completely overcame our comprehensive
faculties, that when we reached the Palace we were forced to have
some lunch, that being the best process we could think of for reviving
them. Having thus regained our senses and serenity, we found our-
selves enabled to listen with complacence to the singing and the
fiddling which was done in the great orchestra, to a rattling accompa-
niment of knives and forks and coffee-cups. -
Owing to our late arrival (we had been closeted with Lord P-L-
M-RST-N and MR. GL-DST-NE, all the morning ºri them to
; up the rough draft of their R–f—rm Bill, which, unless "our
"rench friend” comes to “play a game that two can play at " before
Christmas, will be the trump-card that the Government will lead off
with, shortly after)—through this, we say regretfully, we missed hearing
the Address which was delivered with much pantomime by energetic
DR. KINKEL; and as his speech was all in German, we the more regret
not hearing it, as we thereby lost a chance of pretending to know
German by endeavouring to look as though we understood it.
We also missed the hearing of the Festival Cantata, and the sight of
the “Unveiling of the Colossal Bust of SchillER,” which a small
wag, who of course would have tr-rembled had he known Us, dared
within shot of Our ear to call irreverently a Buster! We, however
were in time for the “Song of the Bell,” and we thought of our cracked
friend all the time that we were hearing it. Perhaps the lines which
most affected us were these:–
“When the copper within
Seethes and simmers, the tin
Pour quick that the fluid which feeds the Bell
Mayflow in the right course glibly and well.”
Reading this, of course we naturally thought of the Tin which we
have poured in, or have shelled out, for Big Ben; and this passage
too awakened a painful reminiscence:–
“Come in, come in
My merry men, we'll form a ring,
The new-born labour christening,
And “Concord' we will name her 1"
With our mental ears still ringing with the Denison-cum-Mears-cum-
Everybody squabble, we thought, had we to re-christen our Ben, we
should rather name him DiscoRD. -
These reflections, of course, naturally filled us, being tax-payers, with
sorrowful emotions. So, on the homoeopathic principle, we tried to
drive away sorrow by taking a small dose of the Show of Prize Chrys-
anthemums, which, as every schoolgirl knows, are called the flowers
of grief.” After a minute iº of the Show (by a “minute
inspection” we mean a glance of sixty seconds), we came to the con-
clusion that the judges had shown judgment in giving seedling “Arthur
Wortley” a first-class certificate, which seedling “Mrs. W. Holborn”
º Holt. W.C.?) and seedling “Miss Augusta” had likewise
one their nurseries the credit to obtain. We also came to the con-
clusion that Chrysanthemums were prettier in blossom than in name,
and we rather thought that a young lady with a cold (a complaint

better avoid asking CHARLEs to come and look at her Chrysanthemums,
for fear her P. ips (and nose § haply make such ugly sounds
as “Cub ald look at by Chrysalthebubs'. -
Having ocularly feasted upon this floral repast, we took the slight
refection of a Captain's biscuit,” a refreshment which is cheap and
nutritious if not nice, and has this further advantage, that while it feeds
it exercises. We then came into the Gardens, Maud, to see the
Torchlight Procession, which as every tourist knows, is a German
institution, and natively rejoices in the unconth name of Fackel-Zug.
A cigar and curiosity impelled us to the lighting-stove, and there a
courteous German asked us most germanely to become one of the
torch-bearers. But the torches being made of pitch, our enthusiasm
fought a pitched battle with our prudence, and as we hadn't our worst
coat on, we declined the honour proffered to us. The torches, when
first lighted had a will-o'-the-wisp look, which made one think that all
the jack-o'-lanthorns in the universe had flocked together for the
sake of having a flare-up, in order, as wags say, to throw a light upon
the subject. ith the fountains playing merrily, and the moon º:
their heads and tipping them with silver (the Benevolent may like to
know that she did not tip Us with any), the scene was quite theatrical,
and had all the advantage, whatever that may be, of having “REAL
WATER!!!” in it. Indeed, if it had not been for the sharpness of
our *::::: (the Crystal £alace air, O Aldermen! is the best of
strops for appetites) we very likely should have felt more sorry than
we were when the nearly burnt out pitch-torches, were tossed into a
heap: a sort of game of pitch and toss which, except upon Guy
Fawkes Days, is seldom played ºf us. Had the evening been
1. dark, the pitch-light would have shone more brightly than it did.
ut what was wanting in the blaze was quite made up for in the
smoke, which rose skyward from the bonfire in as dense a volume as
would be made by a collection of the speeches of our Wiscount; whose
. in this point may be likened to a Fackel-Zug , for, flare up as he
may, t
ere is very little sparkle in it, and it always ends in smoke.
* Prithee, why called “Captain's," eh, good Notes and Queries f
WOMEN'S WORK.
ALENTED SIR, I could find
plenty of employment for
women, but I never can get
any of them to do it. At the
resent moment there are no
ess than nineteen buttons
off my shirts. It is the same
with my collars—not a string

will condescend to teach it
me, though there are six
pianos in the house, I am sure, if there is one.
“Believe me, Sir, it is all nonsense: there is plenty of employment,
but the truth is, when it is offered to the women they won’t accept it.
Why, I would, undertake myself to keep two or three constantly
em łºd all day...with the few things (making flies, punching out
wadding, and the like) that I want attending to. The fact is, the girls
of the present day are getting confoundedly too proud, or else too lazy,
They won't do a single thing. Why it was only yesterday that I asked
Miss Lucy to clean my pipe out i. me, and the young puss actually
refused me to my face!
“That is a fact, Sir, and you are at liberty to make the most of it.
“I remain, Sir, with the greatest indignation,
“A SNUBBED BROTHER.”
“P.S. My sisters say that I am a selfish, surly, º brother, and
that is the reason they will do nothing to please me. Pretty nonsense!
Why they will do anything for ToM, and ALFRED, and Guss; and I am
sure they behave no better to them than I do.”

“DOWN AMONG THIE DEAD MEN.”
“When the Pope is pressed by the Duc de GRAMMost to concede Reforms, he
eludes the request by declaring his readiness “to retire to the Catacombs like sm
many of his predecessors.'"—Times Correspondent's Letter from Rome.
What was that threat, old man?—Thou wilt retire
Down to the Catacombs, where sleep the bones
Of Martyrs snatched from the arena's pyre:
With rude but reverend symbols on the stones,
That from the pagan's desecrating ire
Hid their remains who braved, by faith, both sword and fire?
A Pope among the Martyrs!—the last link
Of the long chain that round the Church's neck,
Has hung for ages—weight enough to sink
Even St. Peter's ship, though proof gainst wreck,
Of enemies—save her own crew that slink -
To scuttle the doomed craft, while her watch-captains wink—
The last link of the Papal coil, essaying
To clasp itself anew upon the chain
Of those first converts: saints that fasting, praying,
Holding all things in common, .# gain
For godliness, found Truth so strong for staying -
Of feeble feet, that they lived down all men's gainsaying.
A Pope among the Martyrs' The worst fruit
Of that unhallowed wedlock of the Church
And CoNstANTINE, claims kindred with the root
Of that true seed, that rather chose to smirch
Its hand with fire, than gold and gems to boot,
Offered to tempt men's souls, in Mammon's skilful suit.
A Pope among the Martyrs! Death by Life—
Battered Corruption crouching by the side
Of virgin Innocence—Love clasp'd by Strife—
Old Falsehood claiming Young Truth for his bride—
So seems the Pope, fleeing from dangers rife
To caves where the young Church hid from the Pagan klife.
Oris’t that to the graves he fain withdraws,
As feeling that his place is with the dead—
Dry bones with dry bones making common cause,
or that the life of these, as those, is fled—
Though a tiara shades the fleshless jaw
And gems and gold still shine upon ºbony ciaws P
Or is it memory of the marvel, wrought
Upon the dead by the dead Prophet’s bones,
That leads the Pope to the saints' tombs, in thought
That there are relics underneath these stones
Which with mirific virtue may be fraught,
To quicken once again that Power which now is naught?
What matter for the reason 'Tis enough
To know the great Iniquity, that sits
Enthroned on Rome's Seven Hills—though ne'er so tough
Its hold on mind and bodies—with mazed wits,
Sees nations mock its thunders, rude and rough,
As summer winds are mocked by some sea-breasting bluff.
ANOTHER POET ON THE SAME SUBJECT.
GRIM.GARIBALDI to breach and to batter comes,
Awfully great is the Vatican's funk;
Pius declares he'll ſº hide in the Catacom º

Such is the aid which the Church's head Shepherd * -
Gives to the flock he should guide and console!
Dreading his own holy hide may be peppered,

Nay, he does well. When the combat and clatter comes,
Men may be there he has reason to dread—
But what a proud day for the Church! In the Catacombs
Skulks from the storm her Infallible Head.

THE
IDEA WE FIGHT AGAINST.
EE the Débaſs on the causes
of our increased armaments.
formation of rifle corps,
state of uneasy expectation,
and double Income-Tax.
Having contradicted the
supposition that themenaces
of the French Press have
caused us to involve our-
selves in all this trouble and
expense, our Parisian con-
tºporary proceeds to say
that—
“The general anxiety which
prevails among our neighbours
is rather owing to a correct feel-
ing of the false position in which
the policy followed during these
last years has placed England.
Nothing is more common than
for men to run into an evil which
they are too eager to avoid, and
the old saying which advises us
not to jump into the water for
fear of getting wet, has also its
application in politics. England
has been of late violently in love
with neutrality, and has pro-
fessed a predilection for peace
hitherto unexampled in her his-
tory. The Times now tells us,
what is the most apparent result
of that conduct, namely, that in
that country, which holds war
- in so much abborrence, they are
now making a hundred thousand
rifles, and everybody is learning
to use them."
Our friend the author of
The Thistle and the Rose is
requested to observe that,
in the foregoing extract,
England is put for the
United Kingdom—part for
the whole. He will please
to mind that this figure of
speech is employed, in the present instance by a French, and not an English
journalist, and may consider whether it is pºlic that a Parisian writer has
conspired with our London contemporaries to insult, by ignoring, Scotland.
The British Public (Punch will not kick against the prickles of the plant which
is not to be touched with impunity, except by an ass) has, no doubt, endangered
peace by having neglected to prepare war. It certainly has neglected to prepare
war, partly because it holds war in extreme abhorrence; an abhorrence not lessened
by the thought of the corpses now rotting in the mould of Italy, which English-
men (and tehmen) have not forgotten, and by the º: ºf the stumps on
which it sees young men hobbling about the streets. But the British Public was
also induced to neglect to prepare war by the fond hope that, some of its neigh-
bours had ceased to be nations of cruel and brutal fools, and º. capable
of running loose upon their kind,+cutting, stabbing, squelching, acerating them
–tearing out their entrails, and burning them alive, from the equally selfish and
silly motive of a thirst for glory; that is, for the pleasure of getting mad drunk on
the pride and ferocity of fiends, and of being worshipped by the survivors of their
victims with the adoration of fear, as the miserable Yezidi worship the Devil.
The British Public has been disappointed. It prepared peace; and the Conti.
nental powers levied war. True, the huge hosts of #. #. are chiefly formed of
conscripts, of whom all may not be the voluntary slaves of their diabolical masters.
Slaves, however, they are, -subordinates of those principal demons; and the best
that can be said for them is, that they serve by compulsion, and, perform under
duresse, the drudgery of poor devils, namely, in tormenting mankind, and trying
to involve others in their own misery and subjection.
The British Public abhors war; but, it abhors enslavement, more. . It abhors
killing; but it hangs murderers, and has constables, who will ºrd them
and drag them to justice in spite of their teeth, and nails, and knives. It will
deal, to the best of its might, in like manner with all comers who may approach it
with sword and fire, vain-glorious and bloodthirsty rascals, who go to war for an
idea; which is the idea of domination, crowning a series of accursed revels in
carnage and rapine.
They Stick at Nothing.
..The old saying gives us fair warning that “if we throw plenty of mud, some
of it is sure to stick.” On the same principle, we * Pwe are continually
throwing abuse at the penny-postage stamps, some of it is very likely to stick,
—which may be one way of making them adhesive, since they will not be so in
any other... These stamps are of the flightiest description, for one of them is no
sooner on than it is off again, just in the same touch-and-go manner as Charles
MATHEws on the stage, when he is acting in a light farce.
They are here, there and everywhere, but in the right
place. They do not deserve being in the pay of Govern-
ment, for they never know how to keep a post when one is
offered to them.

With pointed bayonets propping it.

Unto the ground a man will go.
Much more his Holiness of Rome
Between seven hills to grief must come.
Envoys of France his conduct school;
A rebel people spurn his rule;
As brutum fulmen coolly scan

When excommunications fail,
And drunken Switzer guards turn tail;
When naked Truth dares face the day,

When Austria hides her º head,

The Scotch Express, certainly, arriving at Stafford at

be capable of dining within that time. A quarter of an

would be derived from the number of passengers who

there to leave it. Who would be such a fool as to scald his

he does very little, icºn tell you, a dear fellow, that I do not know all

well to think of hesitating. He assured himself in either the Ineligible

secured, I, and the five darling children at present composing all our

paying if yºu fall by the land of an Inyºdºr.
‘Now, this is the point. If our Riflemen's Assurances are not

“However, that is their business. If I were the Offices, I would at

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HIGH JINKS AT MIDDLESB0ROUGH.
HAT truly odd fellows there seem to
be at Middlesborough l—and the
author of the advertisement whereof
portions are subjoined appears to be
one of them:—
DunkerLEY'S GRAND DRE88 BALL.
AT the repeated request of many of
his friends, MR. DUNKERLEY has made
ments for a GRAND DRESS BALL,
to :: place in the Odd Fellows' Hall,
Middlesborough, on Monday Evening, No-
vember 7th, 1859. . . . . Four Splendid
Iced Cakes will be given-One to the Belle
of the Ball ; another to the Lady who ap-
proaches nearest to the Belle: one to the
Best Amateur Step Dancer, who has attend-
ed MR. DUNKERLEy's parties, and one to
the Best Conducted Gentleman.
The Ball will be kept up till a late hour,
so as to enable parties from a distance to
depart by the ear {.. in the morning.
oors open at half-past eight, music at
nine.
We hope MR. DUNKERLEY’s Ball
went off pleasantly. The prize to be
awarded to the best conducted gen-
tleman seems to, indicate that, the
projected assembly was not likely
to be remarkable for conduct of a
It is to be feared that the iced-cake which was
superior tº:
to have been al -
of the original Apple of Discord, and occasioned a row. We should
like to know who took the part of PARIs on this occasion, and acted as
umpire. The lady who was judged to approach nearest to the Belle of
the Ball was perhaps dissatisfied at coming off second best, although
she may have swallowed the affront with her iced cake. The gentle-
man who had the politeness to approach nearest to such a Belle was,
perhaps, the rather deserving of encouragement. As to the best
Amateur Step-Dancer, no doubt he fairly earned his prize by cutting
capers of a sort very fit to be exhibited in the Hall of the oddest of
Odd Fellows. Peradventure the “best conducted gentleman” con-
cluded the festive evening with a song, namely, “We won’t go home
till morning, till the early trains are near !”
THE WEAR AND TEAR OF RAILWAYS.
... An interesting paper on railway statistics gives us the information
that “twenty thousand tons of iron require to be replaced every year
on railways, owing to the wear and tear, and twenty-six million
wooden sleepers require to be replaced annually from the same cause.”
These sleepers are evidently not what are called “sound sleepers,” or
else they would not have to be pulled out of their beds after they had
been lying down for so short a duration of time. However, there are
other questions connected with the wear and tear of railways that we
should like to be acquainted with.
If a train comes in an hour or two hours late, what is the effect of
the wear and tear upon the patience of the travellers; if a lady finds
that her luggage, which she wants !". that evening to go to a
grand county all, has been carried to quite an opposite direction of
the kingdom, how does her temper stand the wear and tear? If a first-
class traveller is obliged to associate with a set of foul-tongued short-
pipe-smoking ruffians, that are thrust into his compartment, because
there is no room for them in the third-class, is his dignity much hurt in
consequence of the wear and tear to which his fine cambric, as well as
his fine feelings, have during the time been pitilessly exposed? Then
there is the wear and tear of a railway-meeting, when #. poor share-
holders cannot get an explanation from their chairman, who simply
defies them, nor satisfaction from any of the officials, whose sole duty
in attending appears to be to laugh at the questions put to them by
any one who has an interest in the concern ? And lastly, there is the
wear and tear of mind and soul and pocket of the poor creatures who
have invested all their savings in the property, and cannot get the
smallest scrap of a dividend in return.

A GO AT THE GAMESLAUGHTERERS.
THE Mania for Gameslaughter has increased so much of late, that
Mr. Punch, who is a sportsman, and therefore not a gameslaughterer,
feels inclined to say a few words on the subject, for the purpose, if he
of checking the insanity. Mr. Punch has, indeed, two objects in
so. ºf...; one being to prevent the extinction of good sportsman-
ship, which in the present state of things he fears is rapidly approach-
ing; and the other, to prevent the extinction of . furred and
feathered tribes of game, which Mr. Punch, as a good sportsman, has
no wish to see annihilated." Abundant evidence is daily furnished by
the º: that there are grounds for apprehension on both these
accounts. Here, for instance, is a paragraph which Mr. Punch takes
quite at random, from a multitude of others, and without the least
jºin to hold up to special censure the persons who are named
in lt :-
“Is IT Sport, or WHAT *—The Duke of RuTLAND, the Duke of CAMERIDGE,
Sir John Thorold, and Colonel Ty Rwhitt, shot through his Grace's preserves at
Cheveley Park, near Newmarket, and in one day killed 230 pheasants, 30 partridges,
100 hares, and 17 rabbits. During seventeen days' shooting, the DUKE of RuTLAND
and his friends—three guns per day—have killed 702 pheasants, 2,230 partridges,
634 hares, 172 rabbits, 1 woodcock, 1 landrail; total, 8,740 head, and with that shot
by LoftD GroRok MANNERs, on the outside portion of the manor in September,
makes a total of 4.437 head.”
To the question, Is this sport P Mr. Punch says plumply No. A
good day's sport does not, to Mr. Punch's mind, consist in going out
with armies of gamekeepers and gunloaders, and keeping up inces-
santly a blazing fusillade, and blowing everything to bits the very
instant it gets up. This may perhaps be sport to those who love to
hear their guns go off, and whose organs of destructiveness are so pro-
digiously developed that they shoot for the mere sake of making a good
ag. But Mr. Punch takes no delight in such exterminating gunnery.
Mr. Panch loves best to shoot after the manner of the ancients, and he
sees no sport at all in these wholesale modern massacres. What Mr.
Punch calls “sport” is, quietly to go out with a brace of good staunch
pointers, and contentedly to #. is dozen brace or so of birds, while
stretching out his ºft upon a breezy Suffolk heath, or wading to his
knees among the freshly-smelling turnips. When he shoots, he likes
to kill, and generally does so. But the killing does not constitute the
sole charm"of the sport to him. To a rightly-thinking mind, such as
Mr. Punch's, the main enjoyment of the sport consists in breathing the
fresh air, and getting healthful exercise of lung as well as limb; while
the game one is pursuing serves to occupy one's thoughts, and keep
one’s brain from brooding upon matters that might worry it.
No. To Mr. Punch's mind battue banging is not sport. Mr. Punch
still likes to shoot after the fashion of his forefathers, however “mild”
and “slow” that fashion may be voted. Your d old-fashioned
sportsman loved to see his dogs work, and gave them time to do so.
ut everything now-a-days seems sacrificed to speed, and the race of
Pontos is becoming fast extinct. Gameslaughterers can't wait for
dogs to poke about, and point for them. They care nothing for the
leasure of shooting to a point. All they aim at is to make up a big
ag; and, blown to bits or not, every head is scored as game that gets
knºcked down by their guns.
To good sportsmen, however, f. is not sport. Game-
slaughterers may brag of their achievements as they will; but º:
on it, true sportsmen will never praise or envy them. Gameslaughter
is now-a-days a fashionable pastime, and many noblemen and gentle-
men appear to take delight in it. lt is, therefore, with due deference
that Mr Punch complains of it, but it is with no diffidence that he puts
forth his protest. In the eye of a true sportsman the crime of game-
slaughter must rank as an offence scarce less than manslaughter. To
. a hundred brace a day appears to Mr. Punch unjustifiable bird-
icide, and Mr. Punch therefore won't shrink from publicly condemn-
ing it. As yet, no act of parliament has passed to punish the offence,
and LoRD BLAzes or Lord BANGER may commit it with impunity.
They must, however, cease to speak of it as sport, or to fancy by pur-
suing it they earn the name of sportsmen.

The Two Extremes.
The RE are many men who are continually going backwards and
forwards from their wine-merchant's to the chemist’s. To the latter
they go to recover them from the effects of too many visits to the
former; and to the wine-merchant they return to restore them from
what § had been taking at the chemist's. It would be difficult to
say which of the two bottles—the doctor's or the wine-merchant's—
did them the most injury.

MILLINER'S END OF CONTROVERSY.
THE REv. BRYAN KING officiated on the reopening of the Church of
St. George's-in-the-East; occasioning a more disgraceful row than any
which he had ever provoked before. At the conclusion of an irritating
discourse, he told his flock that:—
“Their services henceforward would be performed without those eucharistic vest-
ments which were familiar to them.”
Familiarity, in that instance, appeared to have bred contempt. MR.
KING added–
“He could never again put on those beautiful robes."
Poor MR, KING! “Oh, dear! I shall never put on my beautiful
robes again!” Thus we imagine the reverend gentleman's lament—
or might we not say the lament of the reverend lady?...“Oh, my beau-
tiful robes! oh, my handsome stole ! oh, my splendid cope! oh, my
}. º oh, my love of a chasuble ! oh, my duck of a dalmatic'ſ
oonoo
However, MR. KING despairs, a little, too wildly in his excess of
grief. , He may still put on his beautiful robes, in private, and, thus
attired, admire himself in the looking-glass. Will none of his disciples
É. up a testimonial for him? say, a pair of ear-rings to match his
beautiful robes, and to set them off in proper style, a variety of
Crinoline?
JAPANNING THE POPE.
JAPAN has two emperors—a Spiritual Emperor and a Temporal Em-
ror. Why couldn't the Roman States be blest in a similar way?
hy couldn't Rome have a brace of Popes? There might be a
Spiritual Pope to attend to the affairs of the Church, and a Temporal
Pope to look after the affairs of State. We think it would be an
admirable division of labour, and one that could not fail to improve
A CASE FOR DR. CULLEN:
It is a wonder that DR. CULLEN and his accomplices
who are urging the Irish to clamour for the enslavement
of the Italians, do not get hold and make use of such
monstrous cases as the following one, thus briefly reported
in a contemporary, as having occurred at Great Berkhamp:
stead Petty Session, before SIR. A. P. Cooper, BART., and
F. J. MooRE, ...? ; after those justices had previously
disposed of severa frivolous and trumpery game informa-
tions by fining the defendants—
“HENRY Osborn, of Northchurch, who did not appear, was charged
with a similar offence. Jos-PH WILMoRE said, ‘I met HENRY OsbottN
on Berkhampstead Common. • A rabbit got up, and Osborn threw a
stºne at it, and killed it: he then took it up, and put it in his pocket.’
Fined £1 and 15s. 6d. costs."
Instead of howling and telling lies, the Irish titular
ecclesiastics would, if they were wise, cite such cases as
the foregoing one, and ask if any example of papal adminis-
tration of injustice or maladministration of justice can be
quoted to beat that. If these are the phenomena of con-
stitutional law, does not jiàº. law, they might
ask, immeasurably exceed paternal government in cruelt
and injustice? Of course the Magistrates Cooper an
MooRE administered the law with all the lenity of which
it admitted; otherwise they must be considered as holding
the same relation to the Bench as that which the law
itself bears to the Statute book.
HINT TO A FOND FATHER.
PAPA the Pope must be different from most other papas.
Usually, the closer a child's relations with its father, the
more affectionate is the filial sentiment. But in the Holy
Father's case, while his children in America, in Spain, in
Ireland, profess the most unbounded devotion and love for
him, his children in Rome, close under his º Nose,
would cheerfully subscribe their faggots to forward him on
the road to Saint Peter, or wherever disembodied Popes
are sent. It is a curious fact, that the Catholic says to the
Pope as the sailor (meaning kindness) wrote to his wife.
“The further I get from you the more I love you.”
Evidently, therefore, if Pope PERUGIA wishes to be loved
of the Romans, he should make a bolt of it—and trust
ng I should them to draw the bolt after him.
A FAMILY SECRET.-We never knew a family that had

matters in the papal world, whilst it could not possibly make them
worse. However, we would make the stipulation that the Spiritual
Pope had no more authority than his spiritual moitié in Japan. He
should not be allowed to budge an inch, or look either to the right or
left, or to do a single thing, for fear of evil ensuing from it. He should
be a complete dummy, and the dummier the better, for then it would
be impossible for Cardinals, or Jesuits, or Ultramontanes, to play upon
him, and he would be powerless alike in the hands of the Austrians or
French. He should be handsomely boarded and lodged, and dressed as
richly as the heart of any Pope could desire, but he should not be
clothed with the smallest power of doing either harm or good.
BATRACHIAN ARRIVALS.
IN the Footman's column of the º chronicling the insig-
nificant acts of persons of quality, we read that—

striking contrast to the ordinary flow of incidents, and startle beholders by their

on which the minds of feminine New York had long been concentrated, and with
which all tongues had tampered unrestrainedly. It was the marriage ceremony of
Miss FRANCEs AMELIA BARTLETT with Don Esteban SANCTA CRUz DE Oviedo."
“You see, we ain't so vulgar as to call a splice, a splice. We haint

this here marriage ceremony—
“Took place in the Roman Catholic Cathedral, and the rush to obtain, not seats,
but standing-room, was tremendous. Pews overflowed, aisles were thronged, and
even the outer passages were speedily obstructed. The pews, most favourable for

glories of lace, silk, jewels, and dazzling shoulders.”

democracy: pleasant indeed it would be in any country, but especially our own,
where the lines of social distinction are so clearly drawn, and where the lineage of
those who boast of ancestry can be so far traced back.”
“Ain’t this here a lapsis lingua, or whatever you chaps call it? We
haint got no democrats nor yet no 'ristocrats out here. Ours is A.free
country, and our feller citizens air all of ekal birth. And as for talking
of their “boast of ancestry’ and ‘lineage,’ that sounds to me oncom-
mon like a bit of chaff. 3. toe git on with the splicin’—
“At 11 o'clock, when the o sent forth its melodious welcome, the crowd was
excessive. Rustling masses of humanity writhed in sinuous motion. Who could
withstand those subduing influences of youth and beauty, of glowing throngs and
mellow atmosphere, of flashing gems and sumptuous circumstances generally?
Some ladies could not, it .# for yielding to the pressure they first bewailed
their fractured skirts, then murmured feeble, incoherent appeals for aid, then
fainted, and were borne out in collapse by stalwart policemen. But still the multi-
tude expanded. Then beautiful brows were knitted with ire, cries of º were
emitted, and masculine remonstrances poured out with frantic zeal, all of course
without avail. The excitement was enormous.”
“Wal, if haafe of that be true, I should rayther say it was. Talk of
gals a crowdin' and a crushin' at your Drawrin' ms, why our
fashionable weddin's beat 'em all by chalks. And I’d like to see your
dowagers presenting of a critter as is fit to comb the hair or lace the
stay-fixings of this:–
“The appearance of the bride was unexceptionably charming. Her fair blonde
shone somewhat more luminously by contrast with the more sombre complexion of
DoN EstEBAN. Tall and dignifi though young—her mien indicates but eighteen
#. bore her blushing honours º Her hair was wreathed with orange
owers: her dress was exotic-of Parisian point lace—but her parure was of native
manufacture. It proceeded from Tiffany, was of vast valuc, and deserves a brief
description.”
... “This ‘brief description is so long that I ain't got time to copy
it. But your gals will find what follers pretty much as interestin’.
Next to larnin’ what the bride wore, of course they’ll like to hear the
full partic'lars 'bout the bridegroom:—
“It is only necessary to say of Don EstEBAN, who is some inches shorter than
the lady, and who is apparently some 55 years old, that he is darkishly disposed in
the matter of complexion, with heavy half-curled black whiskers and moustache to
dored white waistcoat and cravat, displaying for ornament only a solitary diamond
breast-pin of excessive dimensions: and that he underwent with composure the
ordeal of inspection to which he was subjected.”
“Reckon as heow this portrait ain't drawed very flatterin', but
then p'raps the penny-a-liner felt a leetle jealous. “Darkishly disposed
in the matter of complexion, is he? Guess that sorter seems to hint
that the Don ain't over fond of goin’ toe the washin' tub; and when
we air told that his whiskers were haafe curled, one might fancy that
the Don had overslept hisself that mornin', and had to bust off toe the
weddin' without finishin' his toilette. Wal, however, that might be,
he came up toe the scratch, and this is heow the splice—I mean the
“ceremony” ended:—
“The assemblage of spectators, momentarily calm at the opening, fell back into
tumult. The confusion and clamour deadened the sound of the Archbishop's voice.
Sometimes the cries of Down front," and other remarks not pertinent to the occa-
sion were heard. Men strained on tiptoe to catch the feeblest glimpse of the absorb-
ing scene. Young girls announced intentions of fainting, until elevated to com-
manding points of view, when their faculties were miraculously restored. Some
women indeed, with unlºoked-for sprightliness, climbed into lofty windows, and
gazed complacently on the less le ones below. Others perched and balanced
themselves insecurely on backs of pews, swaying dangerously with each throb of
emotion that pervaded them. But amid, and notwithstanding all this turbulence,
the ceremony did proceed and end, LIEUT. BARTLETT shedding tears the while.
Then the bride turned, and ºf in full view of the assemblage, her cheeks
flushed with excitement, her eyes diffusing liquid lustre, showered kisses among
her bridesmaids. After that, the party retired by a private door, and general des-
sication followed."
“What ‘general dessication’ is, I ain't learned enough to know,
but to make a fitting climax it should be something stunnin'. Wal,
next toe bein’ the Don, I'd have liked to be a bridesmaid, and come in
for some of them air kisses as was showered on 'em."f think myself
the bride ought toe have kissed the men all round, considerin'
how they’d “strained their tiptoes” toe ‘catch glimpses’ of her.

LITERARY REWARDS.
VICTOR EMMANUEL has been distributing crosses and stars to
certain French literary gentlemen, who followed the Italian campaign.
It is not often that rewards in England are conferred upon literary
gentlemen; but we think that Mons. MICHEL CHEVALIER is deserving
of some distinction from the British Government, for the admirable
letters he is at present writing in the Débats upon the relations between
France and England. Messieurs EDMOND TEXIER, John LEMOINE,
and others, merely received their rewards for recording the events of
war. Mons. CHEvaLIER's cause is a far higher one, and consequently
deserving of a higher recognition. By disabusing prejudices, and
simply telling the truth, he has perhaps done more, from the nature of
his position and the force of his talent, to maintain peace between the
two countries than any English minister. However, as the arts of war
are always more liberally rewarded than those of peace, we suppose
that Virtue, like Mons. CHEvaLIER's, must be its own reward, always
excepting the abuse, of course, of Mons. WEUILLOT, for the abuse of
such men must invariably be received as the proud testimonial of a
good cause.

A REWEREND MASTER OF HOUNDS.
(To the Editor of the “Record.”)
My BELovED BROTHER,
- SUFFER me to draw your attention to the subjoined most
interesting statement which appeared the other day in that truly
edifying newspaper the Morning Post:-
“Foxhuntino AND THE CLERGY.—A few days ago the EARL or Portsmouth
inaugurated his foxhunting season at Eggesford, North Devon, with a generous
hospitality. The nouse was open to all comers, whether attired in fustian or scarlet,
and a sumptuous repast was provided for about 300 guests. The occasion was con-
sidered appropriate for the presentation of a testimonial to the Rev. John Russell,
incumbent of Swymbridge, who for many years had most creditably discharged the
duties of a master of foxhounds of that district.”
LoRD PortsMoUTH, in presenting the testimonial to MR. Russell,
i. in terms of high praise of the popularity of that reverend gen-
tleman and of his kindness and warmth of heart, remarking that—
“. It was true that MR. Russell had shown aſh attachment to the noble sport of
foxhunting, but he (the noble Earl) had never heard that he had ever in a single
instance neglected duties as a Clergyman for the exciting and health-giving
sports of the field. He was one of those who thought that a Clergyman was quite
as much in his place in following field-sports as he was in gadding about to !.
and parties.”
I feel quite sure that you will coincide in the opinion above expressed
by the EARL of PortsMouth. But at the same time I am painfully
afraid that {. will also declare the converse, and say that you consider
a dancing clergyman, as properly employed as a fox-hunting one; and I
also fear that you will further intimate your conviction that the one is
riding and the other dancing exactly the same way, namely, that which
SHAksPEARE (whom the French profanely style the divine º
calls the primrose path; riding and dancing to a place which I nee
not name. Mark then this cheering and satisfactory assurance that the
reverend master of hounds and incumbent of Swymbridge is walking
in the right way as well as accustomed to gallop across country:-
“To show that º of the chace are not incompatible with a zealous
discharge of ministerial duty, it was stated that the Rev. M.R. Russell had pre-
sented to him a testimonial from his parishioners on leaving a former curacy, and
that so highly was he esteemed by his present parishioners that they had also pre-
sented him with a testimonial of their esteem."
These facts may serve to correct some erroneous sentiments which I
have too much reason to think that you entertain concerning, the
pleasures of the chace. , Abide not in the prejudice which deems them
sinful. Oh! if you could only listen to the earnest conversation which
foxhunters are wont to hold on the subject of their cherished pursuit
and particularly on that noble animal by whose aid they practise it-
mean not the fox but the horse—you would soon learn that fox-huntin
is an avocation which may trul described as serious. And oh! i
}. were to notice the glow, of health which suffuses the face of the
habitual huntsman, you would admire the congruity of hale condition
with sound views, amongst which you would then rejoice to recognise
the view holla. Yea, you would own that his fresh-coloured cheeks
are meeter for a Protestant minister than the sallow visage which is
liable to be mistaken for that of a Popish priest. , Believe me, in the
wish that you may one day taste the sweetness, and enjoy the privilege,
of sitting under, and peradventure of riding after, the REv. John
Russell, Master of the Swymbridge Hounds, alway affectionately
yours. 49&INCſº.
P.S. Recollect that the Man of Sin forbids fox-hunting in the Seat
of the Beast.

“Great were the changes in the Consol market to-day. At times
elated with joy, then driven to the lowest depths of despair, the wild
speculators of the Stock Exchange revelled in the severity of the
fluctuations. Men talk of the excitement, of the gaming table, the
hopes and fears of the turf, but what are they to the ferocious exulta-
tion or the terrible anguish felt by those whose fortunes and credit
are doubled or imperilled by a rise or a fall of an-eighth. Yes, one
half-crown may be the ruin or the enrichment of thousands. At early
morn whispers went around that the jarring interests of France and
Austria had been reconciled, and that peace would again reign between
the rival empires. Straight the cry arose, “I’ll give 963,” and far
beyond the sacred precincts of the Stock 'Exchange went forth the
happy news. ‘An advance of an eighth, an eighth advance!’ resounded
from Houndsditch to Temple Bar, from London Wall to London
Bridge. Men spoke fearfully to one another, and hesitated to credit
the (City) worſd wide rumour... Expectation was on tiptoe as the
moment arrived for the Second Edition of the Times. Fiercely jostled
the dealers to catch sight of the fortune-making journal. In a moment
the gigantic BugGINs hoarsely bellowed ‘four new iron-cased gun:
boats for the French navy!’ and down down went Consols until a fall
of a quarter was the frightful result,’ &c.
“There now, Mr. Punch, I flatter myself that that is something like
the writing that befits the leading journal. A different style might be
employed with the D-ly News. In the case of this º paper, a
umore flowing sort of diction is required. At present the D. M. indulges

in a few flowers of fancy, but there is still scope for improvement.
Suppose we give a specimen:—
“Bright as the bright morning sky were the cheerful countenances
of the dealers on the Stock Exchange, and gladdened were their hearts.
A heavenly rumour, that peace was signed, conveyed new spirits to
their bosoms, and Consols at once jumped up an-eighth. Merrily
bounded forth railway stocks, Turkish and those miscalled investments
which are especially the delight of speculators. On they caracolled,
Caledonian leading the way, that stock which represents what we may
call the whiskey side of the character of our countrymen across the
Tweed, so wide are its gyrations. Lancashire and Yorkshire, London
and North Western fast stocks sensitive to the smallest influences,
and then Great Northern, that steady-going bow-windowed (if we may
so term it) stock that moves up one per cent, and has done with it.
Merrily capered the bulls, and tossed up prices so high as to be beyond
the reach of the disheartened bears who shrunk gloomily into their
dens. Alas!, how evanescent is joy. The second edition of that
iniquitous cold, blanket (there is no necessity to allude further to a
journal deserving to be crushed into obscurity, by the enlightened
ublic opinion of England, which as is generally allowed, we represent)

rushed the bears, who with deadly hug pressed down nsols a quarter
er cent. Railways et id genus omne were also determinedly driven
own.”
“And soon. There is again the Mo-n—g H–r—d, a paper devoted
to the interest of LoRD DERby. Why, do not the respectable old

THE TWO MAGUIRES.
The Morning Post says that a fellow named MAGUIRE:—
“As a member of the Town Council of Cork appeared a few days ago in person
to resist the appointment of a deputation to meet Lond CARLIste on the occasion of
his coming to lay the foundation-stone of a new bridge, the old edifice having been
swept away by a flood in the year 1853."
LoRD CARLISLE, according to the Post, put himself out of the way
to travelin November to Cork, at the request of the citizens, in order
that he might inaugurate a useful work—thus evincing his anxiety to
perform a public duty. “Yet,” adds our contemporary:-
“This duty is in the Town Council pronounced to be “humbug and fudge’ by a
speaker who wears, wonderful to say, a barrister's gown, who edits a *
journal, and who—still more wonderful—is a member of the British Legislature.”
In short, from what the Post says, one might be tempted to conclude
that this fellow MAGUIRE was no other than MR. MAGUIRE, Editor of
the Cork Eraminer, and M.P. for Dungaryan...This must be a mistake.
The journal in question goes on to say that this same MAGUIRE also
roposed in the Town Council that an amnesty should be demanded
or the rascal MITCHELL, the escaped convict, who recommended
would-be rebels to throw vitriol on British soldiers, and is now doing
his small possible to persuade the French to invade Great Britain.
The Town Council of Cork, repudiated both MAGUIRE's antipathy to
the EARL of CARLISLE and his sympathy with MITCHELL; rejecting as
well his proposal to insult the LöRp LIEUTENANT as his motion to .
a pardon for the criminal, now trying to levy war against the Queen.
hat the impudent, coarse, vulgar dog who called LoRD CARLISLE's
Act of complaisance and kindness “humbug, and fudge” can have
been MR. MAGUIRE, M.P., is incredible. Still more incredible is it
that the fellow who made common cause with the other fellow actually
engaged in plotting treason against the state is identical with the
honourable Member for Dungarvan. It is true that MR. Magume,
the Irish Member, represents the Pope rather more than Dungarvan.
It is true that this champiºn of Irish freedom has written, a pamphlet
designed to extol the papal tyranny. There is no doubt that he is an
Ultramontane famatic; but surely, some unaccountable blunder has
caused him to be confounded with the insolent sympathiser with a
traitorous blackguard. MR. MAGUIRE is an M.P.. He knows what is
due to the character signified by those initials, which, if hereally were

ANOTHER GO AT THE GAMESLAUGHTERERS.
R. Punch last week said a
few words against game-
slaughter; and, as what-
eyer Mr. Punch may say is
always certainto belistened
to, those few words would
suffice to diminish that
offence. But it being Mr.
Punch's way to clench nails
after hitting them, he has
prepared himself for ham.
mering away at the same
theme, until the crime of
gameslaughter is utter
extinct. The text on which
his Sermon will this week
be preached is taken from
the Montrose Standard of
a short while since:–
“Noble Sport.-The other
day Mr. HALL, who has been
residing during the shooting
season at Hunt Hill, on the
grounds of Lord Panmure, in
\ the parish of Lethnot, killed a
fine young s at 208 yards
distance, from horseback. He
also killed a royal stag, the first
ever known upon the ground,
and shot this year 20,008 hares.”
If it had not been for the last sentence in this paragraph, it would
not have excited the just wrath of Mr. Punch. On the contrary, indeed, .
had the “noble sport” consisted of the deerstalking alone, Mr. Punch
would have awarded it the kºos which it merited. To kill a stag from
horseback at above two hundred yards was a feat of which a sportsman
might be, pardonably, proud, and Mr. Punch would have delighted
to assign him all due honour for it. What is afterwards narrated is
however widely different, and smacks yery much more strongly of
gameslaughter than sport. To shoot a hare at all is scarcely to be
viewed as a sportsmanlike Pºiº Hares should by rights be
coursed or hunted, and not shot. Pot-hunters are prone to shoot
them, it is true; but what is sport to pot-hunters is death to sport
with sportsmen. If pot-hunters had their way, all the game which
could be got at would go º to pot.
Mr. Punch would fain repeat that the killing of a stag at 200 yards
off horseback, is such an act of sportsmanship as may be well calle
“noble sport.” But the term is surely misplaced when applied to the
achievement which is afterwards recorded. To massacre by shooting
more than twenty thousand hares is more an act of butchery than a
feat of spºrt...It savours of the slaughterhouse, and not the º:
lodge or shooting-box. . People who can shoot don't care to kill a hare
º it. One of the chief delights in shooting is to make a difficult shot.
he more difficult the shot, the more one-likes to make it. A sports-
man therefore...seldom lets his gun off at a hare; inasmuch as it is
seldom at all difficult to shoot it. In general, one finds that any muff
gan shoot a hare. Mr. Punch would as soon think to miss a haystack
if he fired at it; and as for the achievement of bagging. 20,000, he is
not disposed to think, it much to boast of Vast as his estates are,
Mr. Punch might find it difficult to put up 20,000 hares, but “when
found” it would be easy work to go and “make a note” of them.
To palliate the enormity of shooting 20,000 hares, Mr. Punch has
heard it questioned whether his contemporary has not put a nought
too much; and it has been hinted that 2,000 would perhaps be nearer
to the truth. To Mr. Punch's mind, however, it really matters nought
if this be so, or not., Be they two thousand or twenty, enough hares
have been shot to show that their destroyer has committed wilful
gameslaughter, and deserves the reprobation of all sportsmen for the
act. fºrcinil a vote of censure is demanded from those who love to
see their greyhounds, or their harriers go a field with them. The
º really is of vital national importance; for unless something be
one to stop such wholesale massacres, the country will ere long be
left without a hare apparent.
Indignant Impromptu,
Who is the Lord Lieutenant of Kent,
Whose business seems to be to prevent
The muster of Riflemen plucky?
Mr. Punch would be very content ...
If that ass of a Lord Lieutenant of Kent
Were kicked from Kent to Kentucky.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HOW A FOOLISH BIRD DID TRY TO SWIM ACROSS YE BRITISH CHANNEL
MUSIC BY STEAM.
ne º Palace is a place
at all times worth a visit,
and it is ºn's worth
visiting just now. Not onl
are fresh air and unadul-
terated sunshine, free from
fog, to be obtained there
(and these are luxuries which
anyone who has to live and
breathe in London would
willingly at this time give a
half-crown and half-day for),
not only are the pompones
and chrysanthemums in
blossom, and the orange-
trees and evergreens all
wearing their best looks,
as befits the favoured in-
mates of a nice warm Winter
Garden; but, added to the
other known attractions of
the Palace, there has lately
been erected one whose fas-
cinating influence will doubt-
less, draw to Sydenham, a
myri of visitors. We
hope we shall not startle
our more nervous-minded
readers when we state that an INFERNAL MACHINE is now on view,
and may be publicly inspected in the Central Transept, where it goes
off daily at one and five o'clock. For a description of this curious
but diabolical invention we are indebted to a contemporary:-
“A new American invention called the “Calliope," or ‘Steam Orchestra," was
exhibited, for the first time in England, on Saturday last, at the Crystal Palace;
attracting, of course, considerable attention by this promise of novelty held out in
the title. Nor was the promise altogether unfulfilled. . The “Calliope,' if not one
of the most harmonious of musical instruments, is certainly one of the most original
ever heard in this world, since the discovery of the bagpipes and the hurdygurdy,
It is, in fact, a species of organ, the pipes of which are worked with steam instead
of air. Externally, it has more of oddity than of beauty in its favour. Upon a
common .#. table, some thirty odd brass cylinders, of varied dimensions.
stand up perpendicularly in two rows, while at one end are keys that set in motion
the mechanism by which they are made to scnd forth sound. The same effect is
also produced with a barrel, working by means of a handle.”
So the grandly-named “Calliope” is in point of fact a barrel-organ,
with the extra disadvantage (that is to say, as far as its hearers are
concerned) that its so-called music is extractable by steam; so that its
motive power becomes a greater nuisance even than an organ-grinder's,
inasmuch as it won't tire and has no body to be kicked.
“One manifest drawback to the new invention is, that at each note emitted a puff
of steam is sent forth also. The consequence is that, after a few minutes' vigorous
º in the Listz manner, the instrument is surmounted by folds of vapour,
eavy and dense-looking as the sculptured clouds in Westminster Abbey. This in
the Crystal Palace produces an effect rather F. than otherwise, perhaps,
and as the steam has plenty of space in which to escape, no manifest inconvenience
results. But we imagine that in a drawing-room the 'Calliope' would be calculated
to disseminate on all sides illustrations of one of the worst features of ‘washing
day" scarcely to the taste of dress-coats or crinoline.”
This sounds somewhat penny-a-linerish, but, it is by no means an
exaggerated statement. ... Our first notion indeed on finding what great
puffs the instrument emitted was, that some of our composers would be
anxious to employ it, seeing that their music will not go off without
puffing. We thought, moreover, that had we been asked to christen
the Calliope, we should have tried to find a more befitting name for it.
To call it a steam orchestra is contrary to fact, for the sounds which it
produces can in no way be compared to those which any orchestra that
we have heard has given birth, to. We should ourselves have rather
called it the Whistling-Eccalobeion, or Steam. Music Hateher, though
there would certainly have been a fair objection to our title, for the
music which was hatched was not music at all, but in fact a most un-
musical most melancholy substitute. Indeed we wonder that the ta-
lented inventor of the instrument did not on first hearing it become a sort
of Frankenstein, and fall an aural victim to the Monster he had moulded.
EMPLOYMENT For WomEN.—To teach the men to behave better to
them... Our only fear is that the employment would take them all
their lives, and that after all they would not gain much by it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 219
A SHOT BY A NON-SHOOTING STAR.
HE Ex-Champion of the
Lºſ º- º Nº ! | y - / º yº- Sepoys (need we name
// Lº º h - ſ º 2^ the Morning Star*) has
//. - ºr- º * - been giving further proofs
--->Tº of its patriotic spirit by
disparagingly sneering at
the Rifle-Shooting Moye.
ment, which, the Star
thinks,—
“On the whole, is very
much to be regretted, because
whilst it proves itself utterl
incompetent for a duty it will
... called upon to fulfil,
that of resisting the invasion
of our shores, its only ten-
dency has been to create a
false impression in France as
to the just and friendly dispo-
sition of º, and it may
yet provoke an antagonism
very much to be deplored.”
Punch need not tell his
readers that he differs
with the Star, toto calo,
in these views. Punch
has all along supported
the Rifle-Shooting Move-
ment, , because, so far
from thinking it may irri-
tate our neighbours, he
deems it a sure means to
induce them to keep
friends with us. How-
ever, this is a free coun-
try, and every one, of
course, has a right to his
opinion; else there might
be such a thing as bring-
7 ºf to a #". the man
who could just now put
forth such silly stuff as
Wº this:—
“In the meanwhile, France ought to be made acquainted with the fact that the Rifle Corps movement, which can
only number five hundred juvenile recruits in the City of London, and but handfuls of unread young gentlemen in the
country, #} no means a national movement like that of 1804, when invasion was actually threatened, and when nearly
four hun thousand individuals responded to the call to rise in defence of their country. . . . . Nevertheless,
these puerile manifestations of weakness, which the Rifle Corps movement has excited, and such rude conduct on the
§§ of certain English journalists, are truly vexatious and annoying, for they help to perpetuate strife, and to familiariso
th countries with the notion of invasion and war."
To make the French acquainted with, our (so-thought) weakness is clearly, not the way to make
them keep at peace with us; and the language of the Star, however lamb-like it may seem, may
be considered quite as likely to provoke them to attack us as the “rude conduct” of those journalists
of whom the Star complains. Of course, foremost in the throng of these rude journalists is Punch,
whom the Star devotes a column to the purpose of demolishing. After accusing Punch of "asinine
stupidity,” and hinting that Punch resorts to the use of illustration, only because his “braying
. ut little chance of being translated into French,” the Star continues thus its complimentary
attack :-
“In pandering to the low taste for braggadocio indulged in by a certain portion, and we firmly believe an insignificant
portion, of its readers, Punch is a disgrace to the country in which it is tolerated. Its cartoon this week is the illustration
of an idea at once the most feeble and the most insulting to our neighbours across the channel. It is feeble even to
silliness, and insolent to a criminal extent.”
Punch calls this complimentary, for, seeing how the Star has pitched into the Rifle Corps, Punch
considers it a compliment to be pitched into by the Star. Censure from some people is the highest
form of º which they are competent to.give; and Punch would much regret saying anythin
just now which might unhappily §§ the laudation of the Star. As for the cartoon the Star is goo
enough to compliment, Punch looks to History to chronicle the effect it will produce:—
“For what purpose can such an artistic falsehood be perpetrated? Is it to excite a laugh on this side of the Straits of
Dover, or hatred of us on the other? If the former be the object, it will be a failure, for we will venture to say, not a
single man of ..".5. sense or good feeling has seen it who has not blushed down into his boots at its imbecility. If
to excite º, t us in France is the object, it may possibly succeed. If, as some people pretend to suspect,
Louis NAPoleoN esigning to get up a war between the two countries, we know no means by º we could more
effectually rouse an exasperated feeling of hatred among the French people than by importing a hundred thousand copies
of this week's Punch, and distributing them among the cafés of Paris and the departments. If Punch should receive a
large order from the French Government for his cartoon, we may look for war; if not, we shall hold it to be proof positive
of the pacific designs of the French EMPERoR.”
If Punch did not “blush,” at any rate he tr-r-rºr-rembled “in his boots” on reading this. , Little did
he think when he knocked off his Cartoon that his “Bow-Wow”. would most probably be sounded
as a war-note, and his design be used for testing the designs of the French EMPEROR
*.*. Postscript (added for the benefit of nervous-minded readers). Up to the hour of going to Press
Punch has only sold his usual million copies, and has Not received the order for the extra “hundre
thousand.” This, then, is “proof positive” that the EMPEROR is pacific. Let England go to bed
and get up again in peace! VIVANT REGINA, ET RIFLEMEN, ET PUNCH !!
THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD
AT ANDOWER.
A. Most outrageous trespass, in-
volving the destruction of property to
an immense amount, has been com-
mitted in the neighbourhood of An-
dover. The perpetrators of this
enormity were the other day brought
to justice at the tribunal of their
county; J. according to the
Andover Advertiser, SIR.J. W. Poll EN,
Bart., H. B. CoLEs, Esq., and the
Rev. C. Doſsos. The particulars of
this aggravated case of extensive and
wilful damage, are thus briefly stated
by our Andover contemporary:-
“COMMITTING DAMAGE.
“ANN GooDALL and DiANA WITHERs, a girl
about 14 years old, both of Charlton, were
º by MR. GEorge FRY, of Enham,
for having on the 20th ult, committed
damage and injury to certain underwood of
his situate in Belgrave copse, to the value of
2d. Defendants pleaded guilty tº being, in
the copse, but said they § no harm; the
Magistrates, however, seemed to have a dif-
ferent opinion, and fined them 13s. being the
costs, and damage to be paid between them.”
When we seriously regard, the
amount of underwood represented by
the value of 2d., and duly consider
the size of the faggot which would be
constituted by a quantity of twigs
equivalent to that sum, we shall be
enabled adequately to estimate the
magnitude of the offence committed
by these little but destructive girls,
and, in some degree, to appreciate the
lenity of the Magistrates in imposing
the more than merited penalty of their
probable crime. The juvenile and des-
perate offenders may think themselves
well off to have escaped with costs
amounting only to 135. to pay for the
tremendous an ºpº havoc which
they committed in FRY's copse. But
the greatness of the judges’ clemency,
as well as that of the # of the
criminals who experienced it, is espe-
cially apparent in the award which
directed that the damage should be .
paid between them. A fine so heavy
as twopence, in addition to 13s., would
have been richly deserved, of course,
by either culprit; but the considerate
justices were content with sentencing
them to halve it, and pay a penny
a-piece.
. This was tempering mercy with
justice; yet the former virtue may
very possibly enter, in too large a
proportion into a judicial sentence
pronounced by the Great, Unpaid, es-
pecially when their number includes
a clergyman. We are by no means
sure that ANN GooDALL and DIANA
WITHERs, on suspicion of damaging
underwood to the value of 2d., ought
not to have been committed to the
county gaol.

§ in that case, be a prodigious
uy.

THE HOUSE-SURGEON IN SAMARIA.
MR. PUNCH has received the Twelfth Annual Report.g
the Samaritan Free Hospital, an excellent Institution, wit
|
FAINT PRAISE,
John (who has come for the Saddle and things). “Yessir, there's Master—he w a
Starin' hard, sure-ly (a pause); and there's t'old mare—and isn't she a Starin'/"
ARTIst (nettled). “Well, there's the dog, he's staring too, I suppose—"
John. “Ay, Sir, that he beſ"
| some ridiculous rules for the
- idance of its House-
Surgeon, on which Mr. Punch animadverted in his penul-
timate number. The Report of the Hospital contains a list
of the Committee of Management, consisting of the names
of persons of honour, worship, reverence, and quality.
That these gentlemen can have composed the rules which
fell under the criticism and condemnation of Mr. Punch,
is quite impossible. As gentlemen of education they must
know that one great use of a Hospital is the promotion of
Medical Science for the public good, and to that end that
the office of House-Surgeon ought, to be a remunerative
one, and the prize of knowledge and ability.
Punch is glad to hear that the actual Matron of the
Samaritan Free Hospital is not an old woman. So much
the pleasanter for the House-Surgeon. But, if she is a
widow, she may marry, and her successor may answer to
the abstract idea of a Matron. Any body of gentlemen
must see the propriety of allowing the member of a liberal
|||ſº to choose his company at his meals, or, if he
ikes better, to enjoy them alone.
In conclusion, Mr. Punch will take the opportunity to
remark, on behalf of the Samaritan Free Hospital, that the
smallest contributions will be thankfully received.
WERY GOOD COMPANY.

LADIEs, believe (we’re sure you will)
Amateur farming's all our eye:

SENSE FROM SALOP.
MR. PUNCH always feels great pleasure in praising, and great pain
in blaming, as must have been observed throughout his career. If he,
therefore, blames a fº many people, and praises a very few, it is
because this is a world in which self-denial is a duty, and we ought to
refuse ourselves many pleasures. He has, however, before him a case
in which he intends to award decided praise. His eye is ubiquitous
and therefore it is not surprising that the luminary in question should
light upon the remote but interesting Salopian borough of Oswestry.
There, as elsewhere, a Mayor has just been chosen. Mr. Punch reads
in the Oswestry Advertiser (which, if it have not the frantic genius of
its Fleet Street namesake, is a precious deal more reliable than that
. organ) that the Mayor selected this year is a highly respect-
able tradesman of the name of PHILLIPs. Touching him, a Town-
Councillor, MR. MINshALL, seconding the nomination, remarked, with
the most straightforward good sense:–
“Some persons may say—"What does a tradesman know about law?" Some
Fº are ignorant of law, and not knowing it, make law for themselves; but
R. PHILLIPs knows that he does not know law, and when he needs it he will have
the good sense to apply to the Town Clerk, who, will always be able and ready to
advise him. MB. Phillips will look at facts with the eye of a man of business, and
he will get his law from the Town Clerk. (Cheers.)"
Mr Punch would have been among the cheerers, had he been in the
council of the town of the late KING Oswald. But only imagine such
a speech made on the nomination of a London Mayor, or any of the yet
more bumptious municipal chiefs of our principal towns. Fancy º
PETER LAURIE, the ex-saddler, that he knew nothing about law, an
that he must apply to MR. Charles PEARson for some when he wanted
it. Why, the roof of the Guildhall would have been blown clean off by
his indignation. We shudder at the idea. , But while imagination is on
the wing, let her take the tremendously bold flight of conceiving
PETER LAURIE, the ex-saddler, making such a rational answer as was
made by MR. MAYoh PhILLIPs:–
“I will devote my time to the duties of the office, and I am sure I shall never fail
to consult our worthy Town Clerk on any questions on which I have any doubts."
No, imagination has ventured on too ºf: flight, and like Icarus
comes tumbling down with melted wings. PETER could never haye
demeaned himself to speak so modestly and sensibly. There must be
something like justice to be had at Qswestry, and we hardly believe
that if a drunken fellow came before Mayor Phillips, and accused a
well-conducted little boy of picking EBRiosus's pocket, simply because
boy was near EBRIosus, MR. PHILLIPs would propose to send Boy tº
Newgate until further notice, or, if he so threatened and were shamed
into fair play, would blunder out that Boy's good character had "saved”
him, when there was nothing to be saved from but a drunkard's mis-
take and a Magistrate's folly. We are, sorry that our PETER is not a
member of the Oswestry town council, though, to be sure, that is
rather a spiteful thing to say of a ºf that never did us any harm.
Mr Punch amends his wish, and would be glad that as good sense
were talked in KING LUD's town as in KING Oswald's.
It Makes all the Difference.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Boy. “Little Britain / Do you mean to say that you've walked London
all these years, and don't know Little Britain/"
FAIR WORDS BY A FRENCHMAN.
MR. PUNCH last week gave a dozen lines of kū80s to Monsieur
MICHEL CHEVALIER, and he feels inclined this week to give a dozen
more. Mons. CHEvaLIER's assertions so startled Mr. Punch, that Mr.
Bunch at first half doubted if he could believe his eyesight: and when
his spectacles assured him, the words, were in real print, he felt more
than half disposed to shake his faith in his optician. One no more
expects just now to find a journalist in France writing, sensibly of
England, than to see a sweep in spectacles or a sailor in top-boots.
When Mr. Punch therefore first saw what Mons. CHEvaLIER had said
of us, he thought he was a victim of some optical delusion, and he even
now can scarcely believe that he is not so. . However, here the words
are, in very black and white, and Mr. Punch can see no cause why he
should not put faith in them:—
“A State which sends abroad 3,000,000,000f. (£120,000,000) worth of the products
of her manufacturing industry, without counting a mass of foreign merchandise, in
respect to which she acts as an intermediate agent—such a nation cannot do without
the freedom of the seas. A State which receives from beyond the ocean for the food
of its population 25,000,000 or 30,000,000 hectolitres (10,000,000 quarters) of grain,
without speaking of the innumerable cargoes of live stock and salted meat, millions
of quintals of sugar, tea, and coffee, indispensable for the well-being of its working
as well as for its middle classes, capitalists, and nobility—such a State is bound to
inquire every morning if something does not appear to be in preparation elsewhere
which may some day acquire dominion on the seas. In a word, the statesmen of
Great Britain, to whatever party they belong, ought to keep watch and guard that
their country's navy may be never held in check. England would be gravely com-
E. even in the conditions of her existence the day when a coalition possible
tween the maritime Powers would render it possible to oppose her fleets with
fleets superior or even equal. It is for her a question of life or death.”
Stripped of pardonable verbiage, what does this amount to ? Why,
to what has been for 3. King Punch's message to his parliament: in
brief, “My Lords and Gentlemen, keep up your Channel Fleet!”
And here again King Punch believes his words are echoed:
“ Up to the present all that she has done has been purely defensive, nothing at
which France can take offence.
“It should also be remarked, that the ardour with which England builds a fleet
to-day is essentially-temporary, for the object she pursues will be attained before
long. The pro me of England is to have, in ships of war, an effective force
which shall equal that of other great maritime Powers, and even surpass it, counting
the stations necessary for the protection of her essions beyond the seas. But,
in reality, what does that mean, if not that the English fleet ought to exceed the
united fleets of France and Russia? For, unless that be done, to speak only of
Europe, the display of that splendid and redoubtable show of political power must
be renounced. But the moment that England wills such a result, it will be impos-
able that it can escape her. It is §ºf easier for her to launch within a given
time a hundred ships of the line than for France and Russia to build fifty; for here
the ways and means are, money, dockyards, and factories for the construction of
É. steam engines. No man in his senses will contest that England can, if she
ikes, devote to her navy much more money than France and Russia together, and
it is further notorious that the capabilities of the respective dockyards is at least in
the same proportion to the advantage of England.”
“The En lish fleet ought to erceed the united fleets of France and
Russia.” Excellently said, good MonsiggR CHEVALIERſ Bravo, good
Monsieur ! Punch thanks you for the hint. The French and Russian
fleets are not united now, but there’s no knowing when they may be.
And, when they are, they “ought to find” themselves outnumbered
by the English. LoRD PALMERSTON, We trust that you will look
to this.
Although our e. as correspondents keep on telling us, is
“valuable,” we really must find room for one short extract more:—
“It is not then to be presumed that any Power will essay with England an im-
possible struggle (joute)—I mean to say will try to equal her by the greatness of her
fleets; for all the world knows that England would tire out whomsoever attempted
to follow her. Whence it is apparently true that England will soon moderate her
preparations, which, once n, are no more than defensive.
“There is a case where England would pass from the defensive to the offensive
attitude, with that vigour which is in her temperament, and which is sufficiently
well indicated in the name of John BULL that the English people have assumed;
that would be if one of the great Powers provoked or threatened her. It would be
the same if, without being the object of open attack, she acquired proof that one of
the great Powers had a previously concerted plan to keep her constantly in a state
of alarm. We must be prepared, then, to see England, irritated by degrees, display
some day her anger with effect, and strike, so far as it depends on her, like a thun-
derbolt. But according to the disposition I have been able to ascertain, and all the
information I have been able to gather, she would not arrive at this terrible extre-
mity until atter deliberate examination, and with the conviction that her quiet and
security were threatened. This is as much as to say, it appears to me, that it would
be easy to avoid this collision, which will cause civilisation long to mourn; or, to
speak better, it is to recognise that such a calamity will be prevented."
The more widely words like these are spread and read the better
and Punch therefore delights to put them in his world-perused an
world-pervading print. That our warlike preparations “are no more
than defensive,” is a truth which clearly nobody who knows us can
deny; and that, if provoked, we should coiſte qui coſite, “with vigour,”
make ourselves offensive, is a fact which our provokers would speedily
find out. The fact, too, that if kept in irritation and alarm we may
some day “display our anger with effect” is a prospect which our
neighbour would do well to º in view. Between the best of
friends it is well always to speak plainly. Words may be misconstrued
and so even may acts. Where no offence is meant none surely shoul
be taken; but our dearest friends can't blame us for looking to our
own." We mean no harm to any one, except if they provoke us.
Bulls are slow to wrath, but when “gradually irritated” they behave
with vigour; and when their anger once breaks loose, as ancient AEsop
teaches, there’s a bad look out for frogs.
THREE CHEERS FOR TYRWHITT.
MR. PUNCH writes the most exquisite poetry nearly as fast as he
writes the most translucent prose; but there is a slight, very slight
difference in the rate of progression in the two departments, and it is
his impatience to do justice to the subject of this article that compels
him to give it in prose instead of in verse. Else he had intended an
Ode to MR. TYRwHITT, whose name, rhyming with Merit, offers every
facility for just eulogy. But Mr. Punch cannot wait even for a rhyme
to express his unqualified, untempered, unbounded admiration of the
following sentiments recently delivered º excellent Magistrate.
An Organ-Fiend was brought before him charged with annoying
a professional gentleman named MATHER, of islington. (The Morning
Star, with its usual vulgarity, calls this gentleman, who is a Surgeon,
with a most respectable address, a MR. MATHER, because he very pro-
perly punished one of the vagabonds for whom the Star has a ridiculous
sympathy; but an Article in the Star is not likely to do anybody much
harm.) R. TYRwhitt did not talk any maudlin nonsense about the
brown beast being a poor foreigner, who knew no better, or about his
own liking, for music, or any other trash, but he fined the fellow
twenty shillings. , And then, addressing himself to the Padrone, or
chief wretch who hires and sends round the nuisances, he said that the
Padrone was—
“The fellow who had brought the prisoner from a distant country for his own
profit and gain, and he was the man who ought to be fined if possible. Such fellows
as the padroni were the cause of much mischief in, England. Respectable people
in this country were not to be annoyed by a parcel of low foreigners, and as far as
he could he would prevent it. The country would not be worth living in if people
were to be continually annoyed by such fellows. Some time since, a measure was
introduced into Parliament for putting an end to this, nuisance. The remedy, pro-
posed was ill-advised and rash, and was such that it could not be expected to be
assed, for by that measure it was stated that a man could not play his flute, on
fººt. Heath. He was of opinion that when the men were brought before the
Court, he should have the power to detain the organ for six months, and then the
padrone would get tired, if he had twenty or thirty of them taken away...for the
organs were expensive. If the inhabitants were to consider a measure of this kind,
and were to petition Parliament, he had no doubt such a measure would pass.
MR. TYRwhitt talked good sense in straightforward English, and
his advice is very sound. Let aggrieved localities—and where is a
locality not aggrieved by these noisy fiends—at once agitate for the
Act recommended. Tooterooeytooey TYRwhitt, and bravo!
Accident in the Fog.
In the terrible fog of last week, Wiscount WILLIAMs, bewildered by
the obscurity, ran bang up against a Pump. An equally bewildered
policeman, coming up, observed, “Now then, move on, you Two.”

HOMAGE TO GERMANY.
A GERMAN has succeeded MR. CIPRIANI Potter at
the English Royal Academy of Music. This election is
only proper, as it is well known that the English know
nothing at all about music, and the few Englishmen who
follow it as a profession are not worth noticing. The
German's name is HERR PAUER, and, without wishing to
ay him a compliment, we dare say he is as well qualified
or the post as any other foreigner. To be a foreigner is a
great advantage sometimes, more especially if you happen
to be a German. "What first rate composers some y Our
musicians would be considered, if they had only been
Germans!. It may be that we are both wrong and mean in
our suspicions. Perhaps, the Committee of the Royal
Academy of Music were kind enough to take the German's
musical attainments for granted, placing every trust in the
old maxim that “Knowledge is PAUER.”
AN ORGAN OF IRISH PATRIOTISM.
SERIOUs and consistent thinkers will admire the following portions
of the programme of a newly-started Irish journal:—
“THE CONNAUGHT PATRIOT.-THOROUGHLY CATHOLIC.—ENTIRELY
NATIONAL.
“The first number of “The PATRiot' appears this day, in the name of God, under
the patronage of the Blessed Virgin, and with the sanction of the venerated Pre-
lates, and revered Catholic Clergy of Connaught. Its principles will be thoroughly
national, uncompromisingly independent.”
Thoroughly national and uncompromisingly independent;-that of
course means ultramontane to the backbone, and entirely subservient
to the “venerated. Prelates and revered Catholic Clergy.” . This
address is signed, “MARTIN A. O'BRENNAN;” a name which, by
the account of its bearer, passes in Connaught for much—if not, like
that of another worthy, for more than it is worth. MR. O'BRENNAN
says for himself that
“The name of the Editor is an evidence that no Catholic interest will be over-
ooked. The Patriot will be temperate in tone, but firm in purpose; its leadin
articles will be bold, but seasoned with prudence, and written in such a style as wi
be apt to improve literature.”
They will be very apt to improve literature, if MR. O'BRENNAN
goes on writing in the , above style. , The leading articles of his
paper will, he says, be bold, but seasoned with prudence. Perhaps he
means what he says—and, if so, what he says, is good English. But
prudence is generally intended to constitute the substance of leading
articles, and boldness only to form the seasoning. MR. O'BRENNAN
may design to pursue the reverse of the ordinary practice in this
respect. In this case his assertion to that effect is excellent Irish.
MR. Q'BRENNAN, having stated his religious creed, goes on to
profess the political faith which is in him :
“The Editor ought to have no need of making an act of political faith, in soliciting
the support of the patriotic inhabitants of his native province, yet, however, as in
these days of treachery and moral turpitude, men, who seek popular favour, should
declare their policy, the Editor pledges himself to the following line of action:—"
PADDY, BRENNAN seems to say that in these days, when treachery
and moral turpitude are prevalent, men, who seek popular favour, should
declare a policy of moral turpitude and treachery. Accordingly, he
proceeds to state the policy which he is going, to adopt in his paper,
and which will include, among other objects, “Tenant Right.” “The
Destruction of the Temporalities of the Irish Church,” and “The Right
of Catholics to a system of Separate Education.” Moreover, he
announces that—
“Fraternity, Equality, Liberty, but no Ascendency, will be our motto. , God
having created man free, how es one man enslave another, or throw chains
around his mind or body? Religious toleration is the great—the grand bond of
society—the strong lever to uplift a fallen nation, or preserve it from falling."
MR. O'BRENNAN should go and tell all that to the Marines—no, to
the Ultramontanes, and the Pope, to reconcile the Holy Father to the
abolition of the Inquisition by the subjects who object to wear his
chains any longer around their minds and bodies.
However, adds our liberal Irish editor,
“Whilst we will be true to the principles of liberty of conscience, we shall deem
§ * solemn duty to hold up to ºil. execration, the unhallowed practice of prose-
ytism.
And then he breaks out in the strain ensuing:-
“If on earth there be one wretch viler than another, it is the person who,” &c. &c
Having relieved his mind concerning the “Soupers,” he thus
resumes :-
“To narrow, not to widen, differences between all sections of Liberals will be one
of our duties, and, therefore, all topics of an irritating character will find no placo
in our columns.”
One would like to know, after reading MR. O'BRENNAN's animad-
versions on proselytism and the Soupers, what sort of topics those are
which he considers really ºf: No doubt he will let us know in
good time; and in the meanwhile we shall await with patience, the
mild abuse and the gentle invective against his Protestant, fellow-
subjects, and the government of the United Kingdom, which we
expect will form the greater part of all his editorial effusions, sub-
stantially bold, and seasoned with prudence... We anticipate much
giversion from his future leading articles, which, whether they will be
“apt to improve literature” or not, wiil, if they are as good as his
prospectus, be very funny.

GERMANY'S WELCOME TO PUNCH,
PUNCH has been readmitted to North Germany—after long banish-

us in accents, which we venture thus to render into our own English :
To my heart, long-banished brother'
Sadly parted from each other
Have we been this many a day!
Hard they strove thy laugh to smother-
Master mine in wit and play !
With his whinger bared for slitting,
The grim constable was sitting,
Keen thy º blood to draw;-
Beaks about the frontier flitting,
Quick to swoop with censor-claw.
Angry Prussia and Westphalia,
Clenched their thunders to assail you,
On the threshhold of our land;
We as brother could but hail you,
Gazing tow’rds your favoured strand!
Humour on thy curled lip sitting,
All unchecked we saw thee hitting
At the follies of the day—
In thy light bark fearless flitting,
O'er the shoals that barred our way.
There was freedom on thy borders;
While all cramped with laws and orders,
German wit must bear the yoke;
Our great Lords—the }. s warders—
Then had little turn for joke!
But at last, new life revealing,
Head to heel, stir fire and feeling,
Where old FRITZ held rule of yore :
And on brilliant pinions wheeling
Wit comes flying back, once more.
Thou, too, oh glad resurrection!—
Tak'st our open door's direction,
Thou, my Punch, heart-welcome guest!
Censor, nor Police-inspection,
Troubling thee to thine unrest.
To my heart—unvexed of sentry—
Brother, make fraternal entry;
Laugh and sport and stay with me!
To the lists I vouch my century
Arm-in-arm, my Punch, with thee!
MONEY INTELLIGENCE.
THE Austrian, Government is actually in receipt of twenty million
florins, which it has just received in exchange for Lombardy! This is
the first bit of ready money which the Vienna Bank has known for
many a bankrupt year. The fact might be recorded under the heading
of “STRANGE. Discovery of CoIN.” We can imagine the astonish-
ment of the Governor of the Bank, upon looking into his coffers, to
find that there was anything in them;...we wonder that the severity
of the shock did not turn his hair white in a minute. Poor fellow,
now that he has got the money, he won't know what to do with
it; so little has he been accustomed to the use of it. As for the
Viennese Government resuming cash payments, that is all non-
sense; we will wager our next week's receipts, which is a liberal offer
as pitted against so small a sum as twenty millions of florins (a beggarly
£2,000,000!), that, the government would not know how to set about
it. No, they will keep the money, and hoard it, as boys do the first
sovereign that is given to them, not liking to spend it, and knowing too
well if they once part with it there is no likelihood of their ever seei
it back again. Occasionally grand entertainments will be given, an
nobles and crowned heads will be allowed, as a great treat, to feast
their eyes on the glittering hoard.
As for the mob, they may make their minds perfectly easy about the
matter, for not a kreutzer of the twenty millions is clearly ever
intended for them. However, every precaution has been taken in the
metropolis to guard against any violent outbreak of curiosity, on the
part of the multitude. A strong military force is quartered round
the Imperial treasury, and cannon have been planted in all the principal
thoroughfares. The Eyreno, need not alarm himself. We are con-
fident that if one of his loving subjects was to see a florin, that he would
not know it. In fact a large sum of money might be made by showin
one at first and explaining what it was. The novelty of the exhibi-
WOL. XXXVII.
tion would be sure to make it pay. An Austrian peasant for a few
}. would be able to purchase a new sensation, such as the Roman
mperor º have given his entire fortune for.
The entire price to be given for Lombardy is a hundred millions of
florins. The Lombards were the creators, we believe, of the pawn-
broking system, and we certainly look upon this transaction as the
largest bit of pawning on record. It does great credit, however, to
the Lombard creation. Lombardy has been pledged for £10,000,000,
and there is no chance of Austria being in a position to redeem it
again. Besides the redemption of Italy is not such an easy thing.
In the meantime, Austria has eighty millions more of florins to
receive. The sudden possession of so much money is more than suffi-
cient to send it crazy. We are sure its head is not strong enough to
stand the blow of such a fortune. Lombardy should only have paid it
a few florins at a time.

224 PUNCH, OR
[December 3, 1859.
A WENERABLE AND A NON-WENERABLE BEDE.
HERE was a pious as well
as celebrated old divine
named RICHARD BAXTER,
whose death was as edify-
ing as his life, and whose
parting speeches to his sor-
rowing friends were justly
esteemed so admirable that
an excellent little book was
made of them, and it was
called Last Words of Richard
Barter. The book had an
extraordinary success, so
É. that an ingenious
bookseller, whose name
A may have been NEwBY for
- anything we know, , con:
# ceived the brilliant idea of
profiting by the fame of the
memorial volume. So, with
the aid of some Grub Street
scribe, he issued another
little volume (MR. PANIzzi
doubtless has it), and this
he entitled More Last Words of Richard Barter.
There is an author of the present day (we will not say an authoress
firstly because there is no such word in the English language, an
secondly because Mr. Punch does not know, in the way that gives him
a right to affirm, that Miss Evans is the writer of the most charming
novel of the #9 who has written Adam Bede. It is not exactly
necessary for Mr. Punch to signify his decided approbation of that
book, because it has been one of the Things of the year, and therefore
would have been at once assailed and demolished utterly from off the
face of the earth by him, had he seen any reason for putting an end to
the admiration with which the tale has been received by all classes
whose good opinion should be coveted. Adam Bede is a first class
novel, and an ornament to English literature.
Now, there is one THQMAs. CAUTLEy.NEwBy, a publisher of books, -
whose shop is situate in Welbeck Street. It need scarcely be
said that he was not the fortunate publisher of Adam Bede, seeing
that the novels which, usually proceed from his shop are not those
to which the epithet “first class” rigidly, appertains, but are, gene-
rally, if harmless in their way, not likely to cause a reader any
intense desire to read them twice, even if he succeed in reading
them once. When a humane person takes up a novel with MR.
NEwBY’s name on the title page, it is to that gentleman's credit that
his name evokes in the bosom of the humane party the gentle, feeling
called Indulgence, and in this way MR. NEwBY is a civiliser and refiner
of mankind, and deserves all laudation. Adam Bede came out of
sterner hands, and is published by a Paternosteric firm, rather in the
habit of considering how far a shrewd public will accord with it in its
opinion of a book, and consequently when the names of MEssRs. WM.
jã Ackwoon & Co. are upon a volume, even the exacting and terrible
Mr. Punch takes it up with a certainty that he shall be repaid for
bestowing upon it some of his golden minutes.
But MR. NEwBy, upon whom the mantle of the paulo-post Baxterian
has alighted, does not see ::::::::::::::::.." not be done by which
he may benefit from the notoriety attaching to the words Adam Bede.
So he announces a work without an author's name (in imitation of the
other anonyme), and he calls it a Sequel to Adam Bede.
Well, as we do not know that the writer of Adam Bede has not aban-
doned the celebrated and liberal publishers of that book, and
deserted a house whose name gives a character to any book that bears
it, and that such writer has not suddenly transferred his or her talents
to the care of MR. NEwBy, and enrolled himself or herself among
Mr. NEwBY's band of debilities, we are unable to say that the Sequel
is not by the original hand. that ignorance—which of course is
shared ºl who are not in the confidence of either Messrs. BLAck-
wood, the Anonymous, or MR. NEwBy—is, we understand, the
triumphant ſº urged by MR.NEwBY as a reason why his
Sequel should be “subscribed” by the trade and read, by the public.
“How do you know,” asks MR.NEwBY, “that my book is not written
by the author of Adam Bede 2°
And Mr. Punch does not know. But if Mr. Punch were to state his
opinion, which is based upon his estimate of the sort of party who
must have written Adam Bede, and upon a consideration of the other
facts of the case, Newbyism inclusive, he would certainly say that he
believes the author of Adam Bede has never seen a i. line of the
Sequel, and is as much disgusted with the tricky way in which it is
sought to gain notoriety for the latter work as are, Mr. Punch and all
other real admirers of literature and fair play. And, proceeding upon
the hypothesis that the writer of the novel and the writer of the Sequel
are two persons, Mr. Punch would express in the blandest, but at the
order of mind that can stoop to seize the conceptions of another mind,
and make (in all Fºliº clumsy) spoil of them, for the sake of
certain miserable shillings. But to touch upon the literary crime thus
committed would be to appeal to canons whereof such a writer can
never have heard. Mr. Punch—arguing, of course, on the hypothesis
of there being two writers in the case—would only point out the
uncleanliness of the trick of trade.
Now, if MR.NEwBy will come forward and state that the Sequel to
Adam Bede is by the author of the original novel, Mr. Punch will also
come forward and retract, with extra fºliº all that he has said
on the subject. If MR.NEwBy will not, why that gentleman must
rest content with having at last succeeded in publishing a book about
which the public talks. How it talks is beside the question.

For Progress and Enlightenment
Almighty tall he figgers:
But there’s a spot upon his sun
That Punch can't shut his eyes to,
'Tis that a word in lightest fun
A duel may give rise to.
O Yankee Doodle, Doodle! do
Your rifle keep less handy:
And lay down your revolver too—
Friend Punch would fain command ye!
A Senator in Congress now,
A lawyer or physician,
Whoever haps to have a row,
Whate'er be his position,
In hot blood deems cold steel or lead
The means that row to settle,
And when his brother's blood is shed,
Thinks he has shown his mettle.
O Yankee Doodle, Doodle! do
Your rifle keep less handy,
And lay down your revolver too:
Friend Punch would fain command ye!
A bar'ster calls a judge a brute,
Straight, out come their revolvers:
In slightest .# or dispute
They’re deemed the only solvers.
Two doctors chance to disagree
A deathbed while they stand by:
To show their skill, they fight until
Each falls the other's hand by:
O Yankee Doodle, Doodle! do
Your rifle have less handy:
And give up your revolver too-
Friend Punch would fain command ye!
Americans ! these deeds disgrace
A free enlightened nation:
The scroll of Honour they deface,
Such blots are degradation.
To check by force—be this your course,
For this your wills be banded:
Stern truth insists that duellists
As MURDERERs be branded!

Your rifle keep less handy;
And lay down your revolver too-

ANOTHER SHOT BY A NON-SHOOTING STAR,

WHO SHALL CRITICISE THE CRITICS P
THE Saturday Review is so critical, a paper that it startles us a little
to find it use bad language. Indeed, we own we felt it difficult to
* our eyes, when we saw in it an article last week beginning
thus :—
“The opinion which MR. Edwin JAMEs and MR. ALLAN have given upon the case
placed before them on behalf of the workmen on strike is a very remarkable docu-
ment. It consists of three branches, of which the first two relate to the rules of
various Trades Unions, and the third to a question whether the masters who joined
in the lock-out have thereby rendered themselves liable to an indictment for con-
spiray. The Member for Marylebone and his coadjutor are inclined to think it
does."
...Are they indeed? Well, before we can agree with them, we should
like to, know what “it” is, and what, it is “it” does. It rather
puzzled us to hear of “branches” of a document, and to be informed
that branches could “relate to” rules and questions. We swallowed
this, however, with a struggle and a gasp, but when we tried to gulp
the “it” it very nearly choked us. In fact the query, “it” suggests
to us is “What does what?” and till this be clearly answered, we
cannot possibly endorse the learned gentlemen's opinion, and say if
they be right in thinking that “it does.”
ROMANCE BY SIR JOHN BOWRING.
IN the course of an interesting lecture delivered the other evening,
at a Meeting of the Society of Arts, on China, SIR John BowRING
took occasion to deny the immorality of the trade in opium, and the
injurious effects which that drug, has been said to produce. In one
especially important particular, º: account, the most cruel injustice
had been done to opium, inasmuch as
“It had been stated, as one of the evil consequences of the encouragement of
opium-eating, that it º: the diffusion of Christianity; but this was so far
from being the case, that in one district into which opium had been introduced as
a substitute for intoxicating drinks, the people had been found particularly willing
to receive Christian Missionaries, and had become ready converts.”
Come, SIR John BowRING, this is the flight of an arrow shot a little
too far. It is notorious that Missionaries, wherever they go, excite an
awakening. . How could the narcotic influence of opium have prepared
the minds of the drug's consumers for that?. Sermons certainly do
sometimes produce an effect resembling that of opium; but coma must
not be confounded with conversion.
A CONUNDRUM TO FILL UP A GAP IN THE CONVERSATION.
WHY is a person older than yourself like food for cattle?
Because he’s past your age (pasturage).
DR. CULLEN'S CHAFF.
THE Irish papers have just published another Pastoral, signed by
DR. CULLEN and several other bishops of the Roman Catholic per-
suasion. The subject of this address is the Irish “Catholic Univer:
sity,” for which it is said those prelates propose asking the grant of
a charter, which they affect to entertain an idea that they have some
chance of getting. On this point they observe:-
“It is so just to grant a charter to our university, we cannot easily believe that
upon reflection it will be denied.”
Do these titular gentlemen really give the British Government credit
for being likely to concede their demand in consideration of its justice?
Surely, then, they are too charitable. . A ministry composed of heretics
cannot, of course, have any idea of what justice means, in common, at
least with the only true believers in mysteries and morals. The holy
fathers must be joking, after the abuse with which they have so long
been pelting their Protestant rulers, when they impute any the slightest
ossibility of a virtue to those enemies of the faith; those impious
§. hemers, fiends, demons, &c.
§. seriously, they proceed:—
“But even without a charter, the university will, to a large extent, realise the
advantages we expect. We do not deem the charter so absolutely indispensable as
some seem to imagine."
To be sure. In short what you intend to say, most reverend gen-
tlemen, is that you do not want a charter at all. A Protestant charter
begged for a Catholic University —you spurn the base suggestion.
A Protestant charter—faugh! it smells like tinder and carrion. You
would not touch it with a pair of tongs. Saving your sacred prisince,
the divil fly away with the dhirty charter
Such, doubtless, are the real sentiments of DR. CULLEN and the
Irish hierarchy of his denomination. “Here’s the health of his
Holiness the Pope; and then that of QUEEN VICTORIA ; and as for
ou, PALMERSTON and RUSSELL, you wicked haythen, bad luck to ye.
ou must know we have founded a Catholic University to teach the
outh of Ireland devotion and loyalty to the Pope, and detestation of
eresy and the Saxon. So now, ye blackguards and thieves of the
world, be civil, and do us the justice of coaxing HER MAJESTY (con-
version and salvation to her!) to hand us over a charter.”
To such chaff as this the only possible, and doubtless, the only
expected, reply would be “Don’t you wish you may get it?”
THE GREAT CIRCULATION.
By the account of the Morning Post,
“So great has been the demand for DR. CUMMING's remarkable book, The Great
Tribulation, that upwards of 4,000 copies were immediately sold, and the demand
for it increases every day."
Long live DR. CUMMING ! Should this wish be fulfilled, and should
a long series of §§. of prosperity immediately succeed this troublous
time, and should DR, CUMMING at the end of them publish another
book, announcing the instant arrival of the Millennium, or the approach-
ing conflagration of the universe, then his new work, likewise, will no
doubt immediately sell to the number of 4000 copies or more, and go
on selling. Such works are sure to sell, in the ordinary as well as in
the slang sense of the word, and those who are sold by them, no
matter how often, continue buying similar productions to the end of
the chapter. DR. CUMMING, therefore, may rest in the assurance that
.#. his prophecies may fail him, he will always be sure of his
profits. '
A Pious Hoax.
ONE of REUTER’s Telegrams, the other day, announced that—
“The Patrie of this evening asserts:—The letter published in the Ami de la
Réligion, alleged to be an answer by the KING of SARDINIA to the EMPERoR of
the FRENch, bears the full character of an apocryphal document.”
The Ami de la Réligion holds the Apocrypha to be canonical; no
wonder, therefore, that all that it says is not Gospel.

A WOMAN’S THOUGHTS ABOUT WOMAN'S WORK.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“REALLY, I can't think what Miss BessIE PARKEs and the
gentlemen of the Social Science Association who patronise her, mean,
when they talk about the narrow field of employment for women. ... I'm a
woman, and I have always found plenty to do, I’m sure; and looking

‘I must tell you, first, that I’m just twenty-one—I won't say any-

you know—say I'm so very like one of MR. LEEch's illustrations. I
suppose by the way they say it, they mean this for a compliment; but I
don’t mention it to you, on that account, but because it will save me
from any attempt at describing myself; and I don’t think any girl ever
succeeded in doing that—I meant to try, but after sitting three-quarters
of an hour before my dressing-glass, I gave it up in despair. .
“Well—so much for my appearance. As to my position in life, I’m
exactly one of the girls Miss PARKEs seems to allude to in her paper.
Papa can't give me any fortune, he says; and I suppose I must look to
being married some day as the best thing that can * to me. I’m
sure I’ve no objection to take my chance—and I, had far rather be

and dinners, and picnics, and dancing, and driving, and making one's

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 229
THE QUEEN AND MR. PUNCH.
State Audience and Presentation of the Cross of Valour.
HURSDAY morning last, a
most affecting ceremony
took place , at Windsor
Castle, which Mr., Punch
will now delight the uni-
verse by chronicling. The
cause why the Court Circular
has not recorded the event
simply was that Mr. Punch
preferred to be his own
reporter; and although all
j. writers would have
given their best pens to
have narrated the occur-
rence, Mr. Punch obtained
the privilege of exclusively
reporting it.
thaving been announced
that Mr. Punch was to be
honoured with an audience
by his QUEEN, and to re-
ceive from her a Royal
recognition of his services,
all the joy-bells in the
kingdom began ringing at
daybreak, and a million tons
of gunpowder were blazed
off in salutes. Mr. Punch
having arriyed by early
train from his own Palace (which inquiring-minded Cherokees may
be informed is placed in Fleet-street) had the honour and delight
of taking breakfast with his Sovereign, who with her own hand
oured his coffee out and cut his bread and butter. The meal
eing, concluded, and Mr. Punch having, enjoyed, his cigar. upon
the Slopes (the QUEEN observing graciously that all great thinkers
must smoke), the Royal party were at once conducted, to , the
Throne Room, and the Audience and form of Presentation then took
place. With a grand flourish of trumpets, the great, doors were
thrown open, and, preceded by a walking Stick (either gold or silver,
Mr. Punch quite forgets ...? the ConquERING HERo of the PREss
was bowed into the presence o his Royal Mistress, to receive from her
the honour which injustice was his due. When the cheering had sub-
sided, and the State Usher had restored, perfect “silence in the
Court,” the QUEEN, rising from her seat, delivered a set speech, which
Mr. Punch wishes he had the pen of HomeR (if Hom(PR had a pen) to
hand down toº; As it is, posterity must be content with
learning that Mr. Punch received the highest praise which Royal lips
could utter: HER MAJESTY, proclaiming in her silveriest of tones, that
he had won golden opinions from Her and from Her Ministers, of
whom She should, as She had ever done, regard him as the chief.
(Here LORD's PALMERSTON and RUSSELL were observed to bow obeisance.)
In especial She would thank him for his last week's great Cartoon;
which, as some, however slight, recognition of its merits, She ha
ordered to be treasured with the Cartoons in Her Commons House,
where History demanded that it should have a place. For his distin-
lished act of bravery in putting forth this picture, which in Her
elief had saved Her country from attack, She had determined to
present the heroic Mr. Punch with the laurel-crown of Victory, and
with it Her Victoria Cross. - - -
Mr. Punch, who had been kneeling upon one knee all this time, in
token of his graceful submission to his Soverei here rose, and
having assumed the attitude of CICERO, in which that orator delivered
his most impressive speeches, said that perfectly accustomed as he
was to public compliment, he felt somewhat overpowered by the eulogy
and honour which his QUEEN had just conferred on him: , Praise from
Royal lips in England was now of no slight value ? and if he did not, as
his friend the Morning Star would have done, “blush down into his
boots” at Her Majesty's laudation, the omission showed no lack of
loyalty on his part, but merely a less degree of sensitiveness in his
cutaneous membrane. With regard to the slight service which he had
done the State, it was reward enough for him to know his Sovereign
hº it. Some of his aristocratic friends who could not roll their
“r’s’ well, had accused him of endeavouring to make a “wow with
Fwance.” Now this absurd assertion was perfectly unfounded. He
(Mr. Punch) had never meant to make a “wow” with France. All
that he designed was just to make a “Bow-wow !” . As his friend DR.
Johnson had once similarly said (he, Mr. Punch, felt sure the Doctor
would have been his friend, had the world been only able to contain a
couple of such great men together), as DR. Johnson had once said,
when Bozzy could not comprehend his jokes, “Sir, I find you wit, but
I am not bound to find you brains to understand it; ” so he (Mr. Punch)
— -
when he gave out his great cuts could not be called upon to give
º the wit to comprehend them. The French press-writers had
ong been barking at Great Britain, and Mr. Punch’s “Bow-wow /*
was put forward just to muzzle them. That the cut had done its work
there was the amplest proof to show. -
It was patent to the world that, directly the Cartoon was laid
before the EMPEROR, he had instantly put forth his instructions
to his prefects to stop the cur-like snappings and º: which
ad worried us. That the cut had been complained of, Mr. Punch
did not deny; but the complaints had come from quarters whose
censure he considered the best kū80s they could give him. He was
told, that on the Stock Exchange the cut had caused a panic, and that
several of the jobbers who were speculating for a rise had, in Cit
slang, been “much depressed” by Mr. Punch. Their depression had,
however, given him but slight concern; for he (Mr. Punch) had always
hated speculation, and he rejoiced when he enjoyed the opportunity...of
checking it. In conclusion, Mr. Punch begged leave, in all humility,
to assure HER GRACIous MAJESTY that (except, of course, his ſº
there was no one in the kingdom dearer to him than Herself; an
coſite qui coſite, or cut qui cut, so long as England, as it did, expected

Mr. Punch then, having kissed the Royal hand, and approvingly been
glanced at by the Royal eyes, left the Royal presence attended by his
suite,_his Sweet consisting of a lump of Royal sugar-candy, which one
of the Royal, Children (Punch will not make others envious by pro-
claiming º had with Royal generosity bestowed on him to suck.

REFORM IN THE HAREM.
According to recent telegraphic advices from Constantinople,_
“A decree has been published in which the sumptuary life, the luxury, and the
corruption of the women is censured, and wherein certain changes regarding their
costume are ordered.”
For sumptuary, by your leave, telegraph, we will read sumptuous.
The decree censuring the women's expensive life, and prescribing
changes of their costume, is sumptuary § you like, and summary also.
The power that can, compel the alteration of female fashions by its
mere mandate, must be great... The sick man cannot be so wery bad if
he is able to exert all this authority over the women. What the pre-
scribed changes regarding ladies' costume are, the telegraph does not
state; but they probably relate, principally to !"; hooped
etticoats, and high-heeled ancle-jacks; revived barbarisms of the
ast century, crowned with an additional folly of this, which are too
bad for the intelligent and civilised Turks, and have disgusted their
rational and enlightened SULTAN. . It is to be hoped that English-
women will shake off the yoke of French milliners, and follow the
example of their Constantinopolitan sisters, so as to combine, as the
advertising tailors say, economy with elegance, instead of combining
extravagance with awkwardness and absurdity.
Charity begins Abroad.
WE read this in the Morning Chronicle last week:—
“A subscription has been set on foot in Lisbon for the benefit of Josſ Rogerto,
the Portuguese seaman who courageously landed the rope from the Royal Charter."
The reader will perceive there is an error of the press in this,
“Lisbon” is of course a misprint for “London.” We never could
allow the man who risked his life to save our countrymen to be first
subscribed for and rewarded by his own.

BARNUM has bought up BLONDIN, ropes and all, and takes him to
Europe to show him the ropes there, and to let him, wander upon
foreign strands (as the poet says) till he gets a good balance at his
banker's, and of course a man who can keep his balance anywhere will
have no difficulty in doing that. BLONDIN's last tight-rope feat may
be new to you, He had a cat-gut rope, made of second-hand fiddle-
strings from the great HANDEL festival, and they strained this rope so
tight that the breeze played a tune upon it. Something like a stretcher
this, you will say. BioNDIN undertook to walk to the middle of this
cord and with a horsehair bow—a very long bow as you may suppose—
to perform a concerto è la PAGANINI on one string. The vibration
nearly cost the intrepid fellow his life; for just as he was bowing his
foot slipped, but with great º of mind he managed to fall in a
sitting position. The people rent the air with their acclamations.
BLONDIN merely rent his trousers, and with vast tact and delicacy
walked backwards to the Canada side, and retired for a fresh pair.
Afterwards BLONDIN passed over on stilts, and upon this performance
being encored the daring artist actually sharpened the feet of his stilts,
thrust the stumps into two soda-water bottles, and, thus shod, again
traversed the cord ' During the last trip the excitement was awful,

GENTLEMEN RIFLEMEN.
We have good reason for announcing that the aristocracy of Hamp-
shire have agreed amongst themselves that membership of a Volunteer
Rifle Corps shall be held and deemed a sufficient passport for admission
to every county or other public ball. All the young ladies of the high
territorial families seated in that advanced bucolic and agricultural
county, have consented to give their hands as partners to any well-
conducted young Rifleman; the fact of his being a linendraper's
or grocer's assistant, notwithstanding. Of course this partnership
arrangement only contemplates the dance; but there is no saying that
it may not in some fortunate instances, extend farther. The spirited
º: of Hampshire will no doubt be followed by every other county;
d the universal landed interest will, in fraternising with the mer-
cantile, make a tremendous sacrifice of pride on the altar of patriotism.

OUR ROWING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH, “November, 1859.
“An eminent Tragedian, who lately terminated his career as
manager of a lº popular theatre, observed, on that interesting
occasion that “the Pitcher goes often to the well, but the Pitcher at
last may be broken.” What this talented º remarked with
reference to his own * is no less applicable to the humbler clay of
your obedient servant. Fatigued by my arduous labours in the cause
of art, and (between ourselves) somewhat disgusted with a Continental
life, freturned not long ago to º native land, and after paying a
short visit to my beloved Aunt (who, you will be º to hear, is in
excellent preservation), I have been endeavouring for some days past
to recruit my health and spirits at that, most favoured and fascinating
of all watering places—the breezy, brilliant, bustling Brighton. You,
my dear Punch, who have seen, and done everything that should be
seen and done by everybody under every variety of circumstance, will
readily understand how welcome the sight of my native shores must
have been to me after such along absence, and appreciate the honest
emotion which filled my breast on beholding so many of my dear fellow
country-women. I allude especially to the Ladies—not only because
they ought, of course, to occupy our first attention, but because at the
present moment they literally form the principal part of the Brighton
pºpulation; Just º sixty thousand visitors (not including the
Talking Fish'), and the greater part of them in Crinoline! Qnly
think of a French invasion—(the coast seems very much exposed)–
. that ten thousand ladies with strong constitutions and stout para-
sols could take care of themselves—what would become of the rest?
to say nothing of the Talking Fish who would, doubtless, take a mean
advantage of the confusion, and ; to his native element:
“Let me turn from such a terrible contemplation. Qf course I
have met a great many old friends...There are some people, my dear
Punch, whom one sees everywhere. Take SLOPER for instance (a fellow
of Quodham, Oxbridge), I was down at the lakes some time ago, and
met him there. I went to hear SPURGEON preach and saw SLOPER
taking notes. Looked in at Evans's the following evening, and found
him before a tumbler of gin sling. Caught him again º the
‘cancan” at º Came across him once more in the Cata-
combs. Saw him last on Mount Athos smoking a short clay—and by
Jove, I hadn't been a week at Brighton, before he walked out of the

“‘Hullo! how do, Easel-you here—Gad—'strawney flar you are
—ponsole—meet lº everywhere—which way are you going?—come
and do some lunch,' &c. &c.
“Having finished our repast at MUTTON's celebrated establishment,
we adjourned to that rendezvous of rank and fashion—the Pavilion.
“As we entered the chaste but †: portico which leads to the
#. I could not help reflecting on the happy accident which induced
the erection of this wondrous building so near the coast. If our Gallic
neighbours fresh from Versailles and the Louvre are not awed into
utter helplessness by the sight of this miracle of palatial architecture,
I don’t know what will frighten them. For my part I feel grateful to
the master mind which designed and raised the noble pile, and only
feel surprised that no fresco perpetuates the memory of its illustrious
founder, and that we stretch our necks to the ceiling in vain for the
apotheosis of GEORGIus Rex.
“As we gaze on its chaste proportions—rich in many a sculptured
onion and oriental chimney-pot—how the visions of the Past rise u
before us. There stood the First Gentleman of England, came in hand,
smiling at poor BRUMMEL from behind his fair cravat, or turning the
back of his creaseless coat upon him. The very ground we tread on
was once pressed by his Hessian boots—which now—
“Heu mihi / "a vectis/-man is but mortal. Charon cares little for

third opportunity which I have lost of renewing my acquaintance with
the WINsoyººs, uncommonly jolly girls. whom I met last winter in
Rome,” and who were also in the Pavilion Gardens, where the band
was playing...The wretch (SLoper) would stick close to me all the
afternoon. It was in vain I endeavoured to shake him off. If I had

A MAN OF SHORT MEMORY.
Few of our readers probably ever saw a more remarkable advertise-
ment than the subjoined:—
O HOTEL-KEEPERS and CABMEN.—LOST, the NAME of an
HOTEL ſº. to be in the nqighbourhood of Bond Street), by a gentleman
who arrived shortly after 12 on the night of Saturday, 19th, and went out the next
morning at about 10. Left luggage consisting of a portmanteau, .*.*. hatbox,
and small deal box. Being a stranger in London, and unacquainted with the name
of the hotel, he has been unable to find it himself, and will feel much obliged if the
proprietor or the cabman who brought him will assist him.—Address T. P., 15,
Ebury Street, Pimlico.
One º wonders how the gentleman arrived at the Hotel the
name of which he has forgotten; that is, if he ever knew it. If he told
the Cabman to drive there he must have known it, unless he gave him
a mere direction to stop at the first Hotel. , His oblivion might be
accounted for by the supposition that the Cabman had picked up his
fare in a state of insensibility, and considerately conveyed the uncon-
scious being to a place at which he would be taken care of. In that
case, it would be necessary further to suppose that the gentleman who
had been drunk and incapable over night, had not got quite right the
next morning; for even then he seems to have been in such a mental
condition as not to have thought of the expediency of ascertaining
where he was and had passed the night. If he is really a person
whose memory is apt utterly to fail him, it is fortunate that he has
been able to direct that answers to his advertisement_should be
addressed to “T. P.,” if those are his true initials. He may not
always be able at need to make so great a mnemonic effort; and he
should tattoo the letters in question on the back of his hand, where he
ill frequently see them : otherwise, one of these days, he will
assuredly forget his own name.
Numismatic Curiosity.
THE most extraordinary coin Mr. Punch ever heard of is, accordin
to a Birmingham, contemporary, now in circulation....That journal,
cautioning the public against taking a franc for a ºilº states that
the difference may easily be known—the edge of the shilling being
milled “while the rim of the other coin is the Reverse.” We hope the
Museum will secure a specimen.
A THIRSTY SOUL.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“As Drinking-Fountains are running all over the country,
couldn't you get one established for my own particular benefit? It is
sº very long since I tasted a glass of pure fresh water, that I should
like to know again what the taste of it was like. I would give any:
thing for a good draught of the New River. I am heartily sick and
tired of the poisonous stuff that I have been for years condemned to
swallow. The wonder is, how I have been able to keep up my head
at all.
“Therefore, dear Punch, I do beg of you, as a favour, to exert your
influence with MR. GURNEY, or MR. R}. of Liverpool, or
LIVESEY of Preston, and see whether a Drinking-Fountain cannot be
laid on for my own especial use. The nearer it is erected to my mouth,
of course, the better. I remain, dear Punch,
“Yours, very low and confined to my bed,

“If something is not done for me, I am sure I shall do something
desperate. , I have a good mind to take to drinking African Port, even
though it should be ift. death of me. Do you think it is as nasty as
the water I am compelled to drink?”

SHALL OUR WISCOUNT HAVE A STATUE *
Too long have we waited for some worthier pen than ours to be
nibbed and dipped to moot this most momentous question. We can
wait no longer. Our feelings fairly overcome us. We have bottled
them down somehow for we can’t tell how long; but we feel our bosom
lºſing, and we must give them vent. Shall our Wiscount have a
Statue / There! The cork's out now, and we can calmly breathe
gain
alm.
Would the public wish to know whence comes this sudden outburst,
we refer them to the speech delivered last week to his constituents b
the noble, because not ennobled, Member, for Lambeth. The speec
was made at the Horns Tavern; and it was in this way that the
speaker blew his trumpet :-
“MR. WILLIAMs (who was warmly received) said he had no doubt that his consti-
tuents looked pretty sharply after him, and he wished the constituencies of England
would do the same with regard to every member, for depend upon it this was the
way to keep them honest and to make them discharge their duty. He attended
the House of Commons throughout the whole of last Session, without the omission
of a single day or night; and no question of the least importance was brought
before the House in which he did not take part.”
Hearing this affecting flourish, who will say that WILLIAMs should
not have a Statue?...Dulce et decorum est, and so forth, we all know;
but the patriot who lives such a life as has our Wiscount has made
more sacrifice for his country than he who merely dies for it. Just
conceive the mental bore, not to say a word of the personal fatigue, of
sitting day and night on the stuffed seats of St. Stephen's, listening to
the ceaseless stream of talk which flows there.
“WILLIAMs expectat dum defluat amnis, at ille
Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis HANsand.”
Full sure the labour is as great, in hearing speeches as to speak; and
we wonder the fine mind and the fine person of our Wiscount could
have survived the torture to which they were self-doomed.
It remains now for the country to recognise his services, in a manner
that shall be befitting to the man. As he has not spared himself in his

BRITISH AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
WHY do all the foreign nations
Rage so loud against our own,
Loading us with execrations,
When we let them all alone,
Whilst we hail their rare advances
In the path that’s good and true,
And lament the sad mischances
They are always coming to?
|
Wictims of their mad distractions
Here, in turn, asylum find,
Exiles of all foreign factions,
Refugees of every kind;
Forced from home by revolutions,
British liberties they share,
Under British institutions,
Dwelling safe in Leicester-square.
What can be their great objection
To the Island of the Free, .
Which affords them all protection,
Shows them hospitality?
Evil they for good return us,
And with curses kindness pay,
Want to rob, lay waste, and burn us,
Why and wherefore who can say?
We decline their lead to follow
Through the fog, and mud, and fire,
They think fine what we think hollow,
We despise what they admire.
Of the monstrous creed which bridles
Them, derision we avow
Laugh aloud at all the idols
Which command at least their bow.
They detest our cool sedateness,
Envy our Constitution's health,
And the evergrowing greatness
Of our mere material wealth,
Hate us for the scorn of trifles
Which they value, or adore;
Therefore need we muster rifles,
From them to defend our shore.

than one penny, as the Economist would doubtless prefer such small
amounts. It can be no slight task to sit for days and nights with one's
face turned to the Speaker, Nocturnd versare manu, versare diurnd.”
One good turn proverbial deserves another; Let us statuefy the
patriot, if we can’t ennoble ſi. But who is there can design a pose
that shall befit him? There is but one mind equal to it. The nation
points to Punch. In the name then of the nation, Punch says let the
statue of our Wiscount WILLIAMs be carved after the thought of him
called the “Divine WILLIAMs.” Let us chisel him as Patience sitting
in a Parliament, and sadly smiling at the grief to which, his patriotism
as brought him. Be the motto underwritten: “Sedet deternºmgue
sedebit Infelir Williams,” until by hook and crook he can catch the
Speaker's eye. Being as he is by far too venerable a bird to be caught
with the chaff of the offer of a title, his statue clearly should be
modelici after the antique. We would have him represented wrapped
up in his virtue (the “Wiscount Wirtue Wrapper” would sell well,
º Moses), and holding in his hand the mouthpiece of Fame's
trumpet, which, in his own praise he has shown how he can blow.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ANOTHER SMASH FOR A STARTELLER.
His national capacity of
Protector of the Public,
Mr. Punch had recently
to smash a MR. SMITH,
who having assumed the
more imposing alias of
“Zadkiel,” had endea.
voured to palm off a cer-
tain sham-prophetic Alma-
nack, containing what he
called the “Revelations”
of the stars. Mr. Protector
Punch convicted this of.
fender of a fraudulent at-
.# to impose upon the
public, and sentenced him
to public condemnation
for the act. For having
thus discharged what he
conceived to be his duty
if Punch was assaulted
with a sheetful of abuse,
wherein it was asserted,
with more emphasis than
grammar, that Mr. Punch
was plainly doomed either
to commitsuicide, bigamy,
or murder, Mr. Punch at
this moment forgets precisely which. What yet more horrid horror Fate may have
in store for him, Mr. Punch may be expecting in a post or two to learn; inasmuch
as he is now about to smash another Starteller, whºse first º: most º:
on reading this annihilating notice of his work, will be to pick the choicest words
º ºlºgue can offer, and hurl them in his wrath at the much-suffering
r. Punch.
The Starteller, or story-teller, whom Mr. Punch means now to smash, assumes the
alias of “RAPHAEL’” to assist him in his fraudulent design upon the public: his
design being simply to extract as many half-crowns, as he can from ſº
pockets, by means of certain blasphemies, absurdities, andlies, which are collectively
entitled RAPHAEI's Prophetic Messenger. It would appear that this sham literary
coinage has been in circulation for nearly half a century, the present being said to
be its fortieth yearly issue. If this statement be by any accidental slip the truth, it
certainly reflects, small credit on the country. It may, however, serve by way of
proof, to those who need one, that the race of fools is by no means yet extinct; and
that although the age of so-called “golden simplicity” hasFº there must be
lots of silver simplicity still current, or MR. RAPHAEL would not have sacked so
many half-crowns as he hints...he has. Here are some, random specimens of
RAPHAEL's advice, from his Table ºf Celestial º and which is prefaced by
the ºnent that each day in the year is affected by some lunar or planetary
aspect:-
“January 19. Ask favours of aged persons, but avoid contracts.
“July 27, Travel, ask favours, deal with Solar and Jovial persons.
“August 18. Deal with things and in persons under Venus and Mars, out marry not.
“August 25, Deal in Saturnine things; ask favours towards night.
* September 1. Deal with surgeons and Mars men. A.M. Good for Chemists.
“Sºptember 20. Deal in things and with persons under Venus. Until 4 P.M. good for Surgeons,
afterwards uncertain. After 7 favourable.
“November 23. Untoward for Martial men and things; travel; ask favours.
“December 29. Deal in Saturnine things, and with Martial men."
º
This instruction might be headed “MoRALITY FoR MAIDsºnvants,” as it is to
them that it is obviously addressed. ...And it is specially for them no doubt that
there is added this delicious bit of kitchen composition. - -
With regard to the prophetic (!) portion of the work, the following may be cited
as fair illustrative samples:–
“At the Meeting of Parliament some antagonisms arise, and a conflict of parties results. . .
A distinguished Lady labours under malign influences. . . The Pope has difficulty to retain the
Papal chair. . . . The influence of Uranus is mostinimical to the connubial happiness of those
whose luminaries are affected by his stationary position in the early degrees of Gemini.' .
Persons having their luminaries in or near 15 or 16 degrees of Cancer, or any sign of the watery
trigon, bask under the benefic smiles of Jupiter. . . The Sun in this scheme signifying the
Parliament, afflicted by Uranus, is indicative of the possibility of a dissolution—it maybe on the
question of Reform. . . The conjunction of Venus and Herschel is of peculiar import, and has
reference to very remarkable and uncommon conduct of a female of note and high rank. . .
Railway casualties are portended. . . The head of the noble house of Stanley suffers grief. . .
An untoward period for lawyers and literary men, one of whom suffers misfortune ord -
- Jupiter is very near the opposition of the moon in Lond PALMERsrox's nativity, which will
produce adverse circumstances, but not perhaps drive him from power. Of this we cannot feel
certain, not having knowledge of the hour of his birth."
“Stuff and nonsense!” Mr. Punch hears some reader exclaim. “What’s the
good of * so much fuss about such gibberish? Who the Blank can º: an
atom of belief in such unmitigated bosh and balderdash as this?” Whereto
Mr. Punch replieth with that calmness which distinguishes great minds, Your
questions, courteous reader, seem fairly enough founded. Nevertheless you must
admit that you are not Everybody, and that Everybody is not quite so knowing
as yourself. There are men and women; and all are not so clever as a Saturday
Reviewer, or (pray excuse the anti-climax) as yourself. We Punch, who write for
Everybody, must of course write for the Nobodies as well as for the Somebodies;
govern themselves.
and for the warning of the former, We must expose this
humbug º although the latter may consider it a
waste of space to do so. A quack-hunt is, We own, not
half so good fun as a duck-hunt. But, fun or not, it is
Our duty, as Protector of the Public, to hunt down all such
quacks as RAPHAEL untilwe make gone geese of them.
NUMBER ONE AND TWO.
. Soyº fine moral principles, mingled with a few commer-
cial fallacies, were enunciated the other day, by a worthy
ship-owner, Mr. DuNBAR, to the assembly of the distressed
shipping interest, convened in the London Tavern. MR.
Dunbar said,
“Gentlemen, I wish we had the good old times of Oliven Chow-
well back again, and then we should know how to deal with
foreigners. . . . But I do º you will go to your homes, and
lay aside the feeling we have of loving foreigners. (Laughter.) An
honest man loves himself first; and the great principle is, that we
should take care of ourselves first, and if we have anything to spare,
give it to our neighbours. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)"
Our Cromwellian forefathers are not perhaps the mo-
dels whºse, examples, we should wisely follow in our
mercantile dealings with other nations. But MR. Dun-
BAR was quite right in protesting against “the feeling we
have of loving foreigners,” although perhaps the British
ship-owners whom he was addressing had not very much
of that weakness to lay aside. He propounded a grand
truthin laying down the axioms that “an honest man loves
himself first,” and that “we should take care of ourselves
first, and if we have anything to spare, give it to our neigh-
bours.” If a man does not love himself first, he will cer-
tainly not love anybody else afterwards, how much soever
he may love his neighbour as himself. He that does not
take care of Number One will not have the means to take
care of Number Two. You may move the world if you
have the where to stand on; you may exercise boundless
benevolence if you have the needful; not otherwise. If we
practise generosity, we must practise it either at our own
expense or at that of somebody else. In the latter case we
are hº MR. DuNBAR's maxims on the subject of
self-love afford a pleasing contrast to the prevalent cant
about self-sacrifice. People who sacrifice themselves sacri-
fice others; and they who talk much of doing the former,
very º content themselves with doing the latter.
When men often accuse other men of selfishness, the fact
generally is that they have failed in attemping to cheat
those whom they malign. He that pretends to be unselfish
is always unscrupulous. The domestic relations of the pure
hilanthropist are frequently shameful; and if anybody pro-
esses not to take care of himself, depend upon it that his
munificence will be imaginary and insolvent.
GARIBALDI’S LOGIC.
The reasons why the Italians should choose their rulers
for themselves are not perhaps at present sufficiently mu-
merous. GARIBALDI very wisely tells the Podesta of Milan,
that “the subscription for 1,000,000 muskets must notoml
not be suspended, but, on the contrary, promoted as muc
as possible.” Muskets, of course, mean rifles. Rifles are
the reasons required. At present, the late subjects of the
Dukes and the Pope have not apparently provided them-
selves with so ample an array of these reasons as may be
requisite, to confute all who may dispute their right to
A million rifles, in hands trained to
use them, are arms of logical precision which carry convic-
tion to º breast at nearly half a mile. If the Italian
º only enable themselves to advance that num-
er of those arguments against any conclusion which may
be pressed upon them by foreign bayonets, they may de-
pendupon it that no attempt will be made to dispute the
position which they will be so well prepared to maintain.
A Point in Favour of America.
In England there are certain periods of the year specially
put aside for shooting, but in America, if we are to judge
from the numerous duels and savage assaults that are
almost daily taking place with pistols and revolvers, the
shooting season seems to continue pretty nearly all the
year round.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MITCHEL AND MAGUIRE.
* ITCHEL, the convict, writes
from Paris a letter which
has been published in a low
Irish newspaper. On the
cool proposal, made by certain
scoundrels who sympathise
with him. to ask the QUEEN
to grant him an amnesty, the
fellow thus speaks for him.
Seii :-
“I do not know whether my two
friends and comrades now in the
United States would avail them-
selves of the “amnesty' if granted.
For my part I certainly would not.
I hope, indeed, to go to Ireland
again, but never § the QUEEN or
ENGLAND's good-will.”
MR. MITCHEL hopes to
accompany an invading army
to Ireland; and if an enemy
ever should venture to land
on that part of the United
Kingdom, it is indeed to be
hoped that the traitor will
accompany the foe. The rifle
in that case will await the
one; for the other will be
reserved the rope. MITCHEL proceeds:—
“It would be impossible for me to live there under her Government without
endeavouring to overthrow it. I should instantly conspire, confederate, and, com-
bine, with person and persons, once more, against the peace of our said Lady the
now QUEEN, her crown and dignity, and so forth : whereupon she would º pack
a jury of true-blue Castle Protestants, again steal my letters in the post-office, again
set BARoN LEF.Roy upon my track (does the Baron still live?) and all the detectives
and suborners, again seize my person and plunder my children, under a false pre-
tence of law. Oh no l I cannot go back to live in Ireland under her dominion; yet
I hope to go back and live in Ireland.”
MR, MITCHEL says too much and too little. If he were contemp-
§º or granted a ticket-of-leave, and suffered to return
to Ireland, and, when he had got there, were to act as, he says he
would, he would be simply taken up again, and tried for high-treason
without much of the ceremony which he anticipates. He would then
be convicted and hanged. It may be possible that he will return to
Ireland, according to his expectation, but if his return, takes place
under the conditions, or with the intentions, which he contemplates, it
will not be to live there very º but to die there speedily; and to
die in his shoes unless he kicks them off, in order to falsify, as far as
possible, the predictions of his friends.
The consequence of which this despicable villain imagines himself is
something comical. His idea of BARON LEFRoy “set upon” his
“track,” and that by the QUEEN, would make it seem that he flatters
himself with the supposition that he is as it were, royal game; some
noble animal of prey, no meaner at least than a wolf, whereas the truth
is, that he corresponds to a rat, and to the nasty venomous kind of rat
which infests sewers, and whose mouth is poisonous with the filth that
it devours there. He talks, indeed, of the QUEEN stealing his letters,
setting BARON LEFRoy after him, seizing his person, and plundering
his children, much as Æsop might represent a rat complaining of the
housekeeper who cut off its communications, put a terrier on its scent,
sent a ferret into its hole, and routed out its nest... To complete the
absurdity of his conceited self-measurement, he says that HER MAJESTY
would do these things “under a false pretence of law,” he, MITCHEL
in the case he supposes, having, on his own supposition, committed
high-treason.
But the funniest point in the above
- º balderdash, is the apparent
† on the part of its infamous author, that the observance of some
legality is due to him in dealing with him. gality, no doubt, would
be regarded in #.; him and punishing him. If caught to-
morrow, he would be dealt with as an escaped convict, strictly according
to law. But his idea of being actually entitled to legal consideration
is absurd. It is laughable to find an unrestrained miscreant, who sets
not only law, but honour, justice, and common humanity at defiance,
expecting that any measure should be observed towards him in
the endeavour to get rid of him. It would be ridiculous of a rat
!. º: for law, although British fair-play might accord law even
0 a rat.
MITCHEL is ludicrously unconscious that his relation to the United
Kingdom, is simply that of a banished vermin. The country has
hanished him; if he returns, it will bane him. Meanwhile the question
for the Government to consider is, whether or no they will move the
House of Commons for the expulsion of any Member of it who may
have been guilty of showing overt sympathy with MR. MITCHEL.
STRANGE TASTE.
WE were startled off our chair the other morning, by reading the
following paragraph in the Morning Star:-
“We F. interesting news from Hayti. Some twenty persons had been con-
victed of engaging in the late conspiracy against the Government, and sixteen of
them were executed.”
And this is from our morbid contemporary, who is supposed to enter-
tain such an acute horror of slaughter that it is said the }. objects
even to killing a flea, inasmuch as the sanguinary act would be
Hºº by no other than the old revengeful law of taking blood for
lood! If the execution of some sixteen unfortunate devils comes
under the denomination of “interesting news,” we wonder what
endearing epithet would be applied to a coup d'état, or a Perugian
massacre, or any of the numerous little rencontres with revolvers that
are continually taking place in Congress and the best society in
America? A łoń. explosion, we suppose, would be classified as
“cheerful news; ” a colliery accident would be doubtlessly denomi-
nated “refreshing; ” whilst a ship on fire, in which all lives were lost,
would be j, alluded to as “the most gratifying intelligence that
has reached us for some time.” A new edition of the Newgate Calendar,
sprinkled profusely with these admiring adjectives, would create a new
sensation. Might we, with all possible respect, recommend the notion
to the Editor of the Morning Star? His talents seem to qualify him
admirably for so congenial a task.
HORRIBLE OCCURRENCE –GROSS ASSAULT ON
MR. PUNCH !
THE world will learn with mingled
Mr. Punch last week was the victim of a
attack, from the effects of which he still is mentally a sufferer.
appears that Mr. Punch was (as usual) in his i."; engaged (as usual)
in settling the affairs of the nation, and just then deciding upon Whom
to send to Congress, when the smallest of his errand-boys timidly
Rºched him, and kneeling on one knee in token of submission,

have been to Mr. Punch but half an instant's work. But with him
invariably mercy tempers justice; and so, with the air of one of Fox's
Martyrs, he leaned back in his chair, resigned to bear the worst.
Emboldened by the attitude the Great Man had assumed, the small
boy grinned and chuckled, and, with fiendish malice, completed his
assault by exclaiming, -

HEAVY AND MELANCHOLY MENDELSSOHN.
THE Programme of the Promenade Concerts at Drury Lane, the
other day, contained the announcement that—
“The first part is selected entirely from the works of MENDELssohn.”
Whereunto was added the notification following:—
“The second part will consist of light and cheerful music.”
The author of the antithesis may appear to have regarded the music
of MENDELssohn, as heavy and melancholy. Perhaps, however, he
º: those epithets simply with a view to attract the gents whom
a whole evening of any composer of genius would have repelled from
the Promenade Concerts to the Casino. By music, the opposite of
light and cheerful, he probably meant, music requiring attention an
interesting the nobler feelings. What he intended by light and cheer-
ful music, most, likely was music requiring no effort to understand it,
and exciting only the animal spirits of those who are incapable of any
more spiritual, excitement. Joy, of heart is heaviness, and elation of
soul is gloom, to the poor gent who has neither heart nor soul.
Liberal and Conservative Loyalty.
THE Man in the Moon may boldly defend his proceedings at Wake:

Commons may justify the means whereby they have obtained their
seats, by alleging that in what is vulgarly called practising bribery and

MAKING THE BEST OF I.T.
Bus DRIVER (after taking the old gentleman's wheel off, d.c.) “Well, you are a funny Driver. Never mind, Sir, jump inside; we'll k'ist the
Pramb'lator onto the Roof, and ketch the pony in no time.”
EYEs RIGHT 1–DRESS (—WORD OF COMMAND.
MR. Punch is, of course, a Rifleman. In the exuberance of his
loyalty, and the intensity of his determination to fight for his ara et
focus, he has become a member of more Volunteer Corps than, he can
exactly remember. His attendance at drills is continuous, and all but
ubiquitous. He may be found at one moment in Lincoln's Inn Hall,—
the next, with LoRD RANELAGH and the South Middlesex at Beaufort
House; and anon with the smartº; fellows of the Civil Service
Brigade between half-past four and six in Westminster Hall, practising
extension motions,—as far as his a priori and a posteriori protuberances
will allow him, and taking, the most alarmingly long shots at imagi-
nary Frenchmen in aiming-drill, and butt-practice.
Of course, as he belongs to so many corps, he has a fine field of
choice before him as to which he will actually serve with ; and in
making up his mind on this point, the consideration of uniform weighs
with him considerably. He has naturally determined to countenance
no trumpery of cocks' feathers, lace, and ornamental buttons-cela ra
sans dire. His uniform must be plain, cheap, and serviceable;...But
among the many competing uniforms that combine these conditions,
he has felt a difficulty in the choice of colour. Mrs. Punch, of course,
recommends “invisible” grey, out .9f wiſely consideration—poor
dear—of her P.'s bodily safety, and Mr. P., from his purely º
desire, to be spared for his country's service as long as possible, had
hitherto agreed with her that the best colour was that which was least
likely to present a mark to the enemy.
But, lo, the shortsightedness of the unprofessional soldier! He now
learns from a military correspondent of the Times (who dates from the
Junior United Service Club), that the more conspicuous the colour he
chooses, the better chance for him of carrying a whole skin out of the
field. #lazing scarlet is the best; rifle-green the next best.
His real danger (it appears from this skilled witness) is not from the
enemy in his front, but, from his comrades in the rear. He is much
more likely to be potted a tergo, at long range, by a friend who mis-
takes him for an enemy, than in the face, by an enemy who blazes at
him for what he is—the truest of Britons. This has led to an entire
bouleversement of Mr. Punch's notions on the subject of uniform alto-
i. and has set him considering whether he cannot devise some
ress which shall combine the double advantage of presenting the most
conspicuous beacon for avoidance to his friends, and the least visible
ºff: |..."; his foes.
e, believes that at last, he has discovered this desideratum. He
would respectfully submit that our Volunteer uniforms should be parti.
coloured—the hinder part of the most blazing and far-resplendent
colour that can be contrived, the fore part of the most misty and un-
distinguishable of grays, or heather mixtures, or whatever else most
confounds men with earth, twigs, or stones. , Observe the great benefit
of this contrivance. It will not merely tend to the saving of life, but
will furnish the Volunteer with the strongest inducement not to turn
tail. . So long as he keeps his face to the foe his blazing back will be
safe from his friends' bullets, while his indistinct front will present the
worst possible mark to the enemy’s fire. But once let him turn his
back, and the Briton will take him for a gray-coated Chasseur de Win-
cennes, while the Frenchman will have the blazing British behind for
the most hittable of targets. The recreant turn-tail will thus be
punished for his cowardice by being placed between two fires, out of
which his chances of escaping scot-free are reduced to a minimum.
Mr. Punch begs to submit his idea to the National Rifle Association,
and to suggest that a corps should be raised to wear this parti-
coloured uniform, and to be styled the “Punch's Reversible Rifles.”
The Latest from Osborne.
“I say,” said WILLIAMs to OSBoFNE, “what is meant by this term
I am always meeting in the French papers, “un succès d'estime?’”
“It is difficult to explain,” said the incorrigible BERNAL, in the gravest
manner, “but I will give you an example—the railway engine, my boy,
was un grand succès de i. $.” find the fact recorded in the
second volume of SMILEs' Life of George Stephenson.”

to append Full Private
JEAN TOULOUROU’s

vernment serving out to me a complete change of upper and
under-clothing, with the means of conveying them, otherwise
than upon my back, which has to support more than it can
comfortably carry already.]
3. In summer wear light clothing ºf soft wool, or Urtica nipea linen, Be
- careful to wash this clothing when it is soaked with perspiration,
[Nothing could be more comfortable, if the Government will be kind
enough to provide me with the soft and light woollen clothing.
As to the ſº nicea linen, I should be obliged by information
what it is, and where and how it is to be come º; The recom-
mendation as to washing has my approval, and I trust will be
followed by the requisite allowance of soap, the proper facilities
for a supply of hot-water, and an allotment of washerwomen to
each regiment.]
4. Wear flannel, both as a waistcoat and round the abdomen. Never
leave it off. - -
[I won't, if once I can get it on. En attendant, I can only wish
I may get it.]
5. Never sleep on the bare ground. - -
[[ solemnly promise never to do so, if I can get anything softer
and pleasanter to sleep }. - -
Put a plank under your feet when you stand still. -
[Two, if the Government will oblige me with them, and inform me
how I am to get ’em along with my knapsack, musket, ammuni-
tion, provisions, cooking utensils, and tente d'abril
6. In summer put a little straw upon your plank. -
[“A Little !” I will invest it with a layer a foot deep, +given the
Straw.
And cover l with a #g of rope-yarn or bamboo.
[Ah—Messieurs of the Sanitary Commission, when you are about
it, couldn't you make it a spring mattrass or an édredon J
7. Never drink water—
ever, if I can get anything stronger.]
Always tea.
[Corbleu ! I am not prepared to give this undertaking, unless
the tea be properly corrected with eau-de-tie, rhum, kirsch, or
other means of quenching thirst known to the soldier. Thé au
naturel is a British beverage, and as such distasteful to every
true soldier of France.]
8. Clarify your water, when it is muddy, with rock-alum.
ſWhy rock-alum ? I shall be perfectly satisfied with the clarifying
powers of cognac. Nay, I prefer that fluid to rock-alum, if a
paternal Government will permit me a choice.]
9. Drink in moderation the spirits of the country, taking care to warm
them first.
|I will.. I respect the institutions of a ponche flamboyante, or a proc
chaud. If the Government wish me to abstain altogether from
the spirits of the country, they have but to serve me out a
sufficient ration of the eau-de-tie of our beloved France, which
is, I am satisfied, better suited to my constitution.]
The best spirits are those made from Sorgho (Kwo-lyang), or wheat.
[I thank the Government for the information, the accuracy of
which Ishall lose no opportunity of testing. Among 360 millions
of people there must be a vast variety of drinks, as to which—
the Government will pardon me for observing—science can as yet
be but imperfectly informed. It shall be my object to submit all
the fermented liquors I meet with to quantitative and qualitative
analysis, for the information of the Government.]
10. Eat moderately.
[A paternal &vement has placed any infraction of this most
valuable rule out of my power. My rations are by no means
excessive; and my sou a day of pocket-money does not enable
me to overload the stomach by any dangerous addition to them.]
11. Never eat ducks.
[I never do—they are a delicacy reserved for my superiors.
have seen them in CHEVET's windows, and in those of the
restaurants.]
The hest meat is that ºf Tonquin, when not too fat.
|This observation is valuable; but I have never yet met with any
meat to which I could conscientiously, apply the epithet “too
fat” or “too lean” either. The soldier's pot au feu, like
death, levels all distinctions.]
12. Eat but sparingly of sweets and fruits.
[Such is my *::::::: as these luxuries can only be procured b
; and plunder is abhorrent to the heart of the Frenc
SOIdler.
The sugar-cane is almost the only wholesome sweet thing.
[Ah, Messieurs de la Commission Sanitaire, make a reservation in
favour of sucre de pomme/]
All others are either too heating, or sit cold on the stomach.
[I have not found this borne out in practice.]
Never eat fruit too ripe.
[I never will; but till now I cannot recal any instance in which 1
have found fruit in this condition. It may be different in China.]
13. As soon as you arrive in the country, acquire the habit of eating rice
as the natives cook it.
[This will cost me no trouble. Consider the habit acquired,
Messieurs. I will not º eat it as the natives cook it, but insist
on their cooking it, that I may acquire the habit of eating it.]
Their rice is much better than bread, which is always heating.
[Thanks for the information. As I said, with regard to fruit, I
have never found myself heated by any quantity of bread I
could procure... I submit myself for any experiment Messieurs de
la Commission Sanitaire may wish to institute upon me, as to the
* of bread necessary to produce the alleged heating
eitect.
14. When you smoke spit as little as possible.
[I never spit at all.]
15. At night, take care to cover your head well, wore particularly your
eyes.
[I demand 26,000 bonnets de coton. Consecrated as that article has
hitherto been to the Epicier, the French soldier will not refuse
to wear it at the demand of the EMPEROR.]
16. In hot weather avoid coldſº ; draughts are always dangerous.
[I request to be informed if this refer to “draughts to be drunk,”
or “draughts to be played”? If the former, fadmit the danger
—and, as a French soldier, I fly to meet it. If the latter, I
wish to know whether the remark extends to dominoes—my
favourite game.]
17. In spring and autumn take care never to get wet-footed in the morning.
[How, if my boots wear out, or the enemy be stationed on the
other side of a stream, or a mud-flat?]
18. Never take a nap in the daytime.
[The old troupier never sleeps—unless like the weasel, with one
eye open, But let Messieurs les Qſiciers take care iſ have my
regular night's rest unbroken, and I promise not to close even
one eye during the day. On any other condition I am compelled
to demur to this jº
Sympathy with the Pope.
THE Government of the Pope must be unpopular indeed, when the
very Romans themselves are crying out “No *...] !” The title of
his Sacred Highness, when he has received his papal congé, might be
conveniently altered to “Pio No-N9 Pope.” His temporal power
seems now to be so very short-lived, that his rule, instead of temporal,
might be appropriately designated as pro-tempore.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MANNSTER CONCERTS.
November scarcely seems to
be a November without
JULLIEN. But as we cannot
have our Mons... we of course
must do the best we can
without him; and the best
thing we can do is to go to
Drury Lane, and hear the
Mannster Concerts.
Readers in the country,
and those from it for the
Cattle Show, may wonder
very possibly what the
Mannster Concerts are, and
will naturally ask Punch for
instruction on the point.
Now, Punch's chief aim and
delight always being to en-
lighten, Punch informs the
world with pleasure that he
has christened the Mannster
Concerts from the name of
their Conductor. As the
Mons-ter Concerts were so
called because conducted by
the Mons., so Punch names
the Mannster Concerts thus,
because conducted by HERR
IANNs.
HERR MANNs—or MR. MANNs, as he prefers to call himself, showing
thereby a commendable desire to sink the foreigner, notwithstanding
that, as far as concerts are concerned, foreign names strangely tickle
the long-eared British Public—MR. MANNs is a conductor who knows
how to conduct himself, and moreover knows how to conduct good
music. Whether he can conduct bad music as well as he can good, is
a point which at his Concerts there is small chance of ºf The
music there selected is nightly of the best, and the sounds which are
emitted serve to show that MR. MANNs is a good sound conductor.
To the eye of the philosopher who looks into the past, there is of
course one shade of gloom upon the Mannster Concerts. it is true the
brilliant shirt front of our JULLIEN is absent, and our eyes are no more
dazzled by his spotlessly white waistcoat. Nor is our bump of vene-
ration excited, as of yore, by that sacrifice of kids, which in his palmy
days our JULLIEN had nightly on his hands. But what is lacking now
in brilliancy of waistcoat is made up for amply in brilliancy of music.
If they appeal less to the eye, they appeal more to the ear, and this
surely is no fault in a musical performance. There is more music and
less row than in the Jullienic era, and one may hear the Mannster
Concerts without cotton in one's ears, which is more than could be
said of certain of the Monster ones.
ASTOUNDING NEWS FROM ROME.
THE following terrific announcement appeared last week in the
Freeman's Journal, a great Irish Catholic organ:—
“We understand an autograph letter from his Holiness has reached Ireland. We
are not yet at liberty to communicate the recipient of this momentous document—
for momentous it is, and calculated to produce the most profound effect on the
Catholic world; but that it has actually been written by Pope Pius, and transmitted
to this country, we are at liberty to state on very high authority.”
The following soothing announcement appeared three days later in
the same journal:—
“We regret to have been led into an error relative to the supposed receipt of an
autograph letter from his Holiness the Pope. We are requested to state that the
document on which we commented did not emanate from his Holiness, or from any
official source, but was a communication from a party resident in Rome, conveying
his opinions on the º pesture of affairs. We thought the gentleman on whose
information we relied was accurate in his statement, but it appears he was
mistaken.”
And then these Irish complain that the Saxon does not put implicit
trust and confidence in all they say, or entertain any very high respect
for their way of doing business! -
But this is not The Freeman's Journal only pleads guilty to
having made an elaborate and extraordinary blunder. Mr. Punch is in
a position to state that the Journal spoke the truth in the first instance
and that such a letter from the Pop; has been received in Ireland, an
a duplicate thereof has been seen by Mr. Punch himself. And the
momentous announcement contained in that document is—and we have
no doubt that it will produce a most profound effect on the Catholic
world—that
His Holl NESS THE Pope is ABouT To ABDICATE, IN FAvour
OF Young MORTARA.
The Freeman's Jºurnal was only indiscreet in prematurely publishing
the fact, and was therefore ordered to deny it; but the matter need be
a secret no longer. It is a long time since Rome has had a Jew Pope,
and almºst as long since she has had a Christian Pope; but now she
gets both in one. Wive Pio NoNo!
HUNTING INTELLIGENCE IN HAMPSHIRE.
A NIMRop. of the New Forest forwarded the other day to the
Hampshire Advertiser a highly technical account of a fox-hunt; whereof
the commencement is subjoined:—
“Lyndhurst, November 26.
“Three DAYS witH THE New Forest Hounds.-Saturday, November 19th, the
meet was at Hill-top Gate, and punctual to a minute Hawtin and his famous bitch
p. made their appearance, followed shortly after by the worthy master, E. Timson,
*Q. There was a good muster of red and black coats, among whom were snº
HENRY PAULET, BART., CAPTAINs HEATH, TIMson, and "M. Powell, Messrs B.
Powell. Gone, Mudge, St. BARBE, Q, and J. SHRubb, EveRitt, PALMER, STRIDE,
Fletcher, Ashby, CARTER, CURN, MULTIs, and ALUs.”
It is to be presumed that MEssIEURs CURN, MULTIs, and ALUs are
local celebrities—mighty hunters in the New Forest. Not for a
moment can we suppose that they are no other than our old acquaint-
ances in the Propria Quae Mariºus of the Eton Latin grammar," Cum
imultis aliis,” implying, the additional presence of those other well-
known sportsmen, and hard riders, “quº nunc perscribere longum est.”
The New Forest Pony must not be mistaken for the Pony of Jerusalem.
The Currency.
The circulation of Punch was 93,456 greater last week than the week
before. The money was paid the moment it was received into the
Treasury, that is to say, into Mr. Punch's till. It is all for the home-
market, not a farthing of it being intended for the Continent, with the
exception of a French bonnet, which Mr. Punch, in the expansive joy
of the moment, was weak enough to promise his wife.

“O MY DEAR DARLING MR. PUNCH,
... “I’ve such, a piece of news for you! At least, I can't quite
call it news, for it’s been in all the#. and as you read everything
I make no doubt you’ve seen it. However, if you have, you’ll find it
quite worth re-perusing, and I’m sure your lady readers will be charmed
immensely with it...What with all, your horrid politics and stuff, it’s
seldom that you editors print anything to interest us. It’s only when
that nasty Parliament is ‘up' that one ever finds a scrap worth read.
ing in the newspapers; and yet I’m sure those horrid speeches don't
do a bit of good, and they are not half so entertaining or instructive as
such dear delightful little paragraphs as this:—
“THE Power of BEAUTY.—In a village near Yvetot, some short time back (says
the Abeille Cauchoise), a case was to be argued before the juge de pair, and just as
that functionary had given notice that he was ready to hear the particulars, the
dofendant, a pretty young female entered. On seeing her, the plaintiff, (a lawyer
in good practice) rose and said, “Mademoiselle, I have not courage to plead against
you, and am sorry to have given you the trouble to come here. I abandon the case,
and will pay all the costs deign to accept my arm ' The proposition was accepted.
The acquaintance thus commenced has produced its fruits, as three days back, the
banns of marriage between the two were duly published.”
“There now, isn't that a sweetly pretty story! At least, I shouldn't
say a story, because of course it’s true. But truth, you know, is some-
times much more strange than fiction. If I hadn't seen this statement
I never should have dreamed of lawyers making love in this way. I’m
sure it’s quite romantic, and would make a charming novel. Of course
you haven't time to write novels yourself, but you really should get
some one of your lady friends to write it. I declare it would be just
the verything for the Penny Parlour Startler, or any other one of
those nice story, telling newspapers which one is pretty sure to see
when one peeps into one's kitchen. I think if I were her, I’d call it
‘Love and Law, or the Young Lady's Revenge /* Onl think now of a
lawyer falling overhead and ears in love at the first sight! I’m sure it’s
quite delicious, and some one ought to write about it. Lawyers are,
you know, such horrid cautious creatures that in general it takes weeks
to get them to propose to one. I’ve heard Mamma say that it took
her all the Long Wacation to get Papa to make a declaration, as he
called it; and my Augustus seems, so terribly afraid he may commit
himself that I don’t a bit expect he’ll pop the question before Christmas.
As for lawyers being ever smitten at first sight, if this Frenchman had
not been so, I never could have fancied it. I should as soon have
thought to hear of bishops learning crochet, or of boa-constrictors
being taught to dance theſº
“No, no, Mr. Punch. The story may be true, but for my part, I
confess, I don't believe a word of it. At first, I own I rather # ; but
that, you know, was only the impulse of the moment. It seemed so
nice for a slice-eater (that’s the same as lawyer, isn't it? AUGUSTU's
told me once he was in training for a “slice-eater’”) to be loye-struck
at first sight, and at once to make an offer such as could not be miscon:
strued, that ideclare felt my heart, quite beat for the dear man; and
if I’d been in Court, I do believe I should have kissed him. But this,
you know, was childish impulse, and would, of course, have been
improper, for a grown-up girl like me. (I shall be sixteen my next
birthday.) And so, on second º I have taken what Pa calls a
common sense view of the matter, and I now feel quite convinced that
this lawyer had some motive for acting as he did. Depend on it he
knew that the girl had something else besides her prettiness to boast of.
It was the power of Booty, not of Beauty, that attracted him.

THE WALUE OF A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT.
A HIGH Idea of the House of Commons is likely to be diffused by
the following advertisement, which lately appeared in the Daily
Telegraph:—
To MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT and Parliamentary Agents—
WANTED, one or two M. P.s as DIRECTORS to an important PUBLIC COM-
PANY, limited. Qualification small, no risk incurred, and a handsome consideration
will be offered —Address, in confidence, with real name, to N. T., Esq., News
Rooms, 76, Strand, W.C.
What are Members of Parliament a piece? appears now to have
become the question in market overt. The above advertisement is so
far, satisfactory, that it, tends to explain the seemingly unaccountable
fact that Honourable Gentlemen will, spend five thousand pounds to
obtain the privilege of working, for their country night and day, by
assiduous attendance on dry debates, and self-devotion to unremune-
rated service on Committees.

CLOSE COMPANIONSHIP.
THE following is part of a dialogue which took place the
other day before the LoRD, MAYor, between a fellow had
up for stealing a watch, and PARTRIDGE, the gaoler, who
had stated that the prisoner had already been sentenced
to seven years' transportation:-
“Prisoner. You have known me for eight years, but how do you
know I have been transported 7
“PARTRIDGE. Because I know you as well as I know myself."
This is a very close intimacy. If it existed during the
whole period of theNº. ºportation, then, all
that time where was PARTRIDGE

A BIT OF BALDERDASH.
The Professor, whose name is omitted in the following Times adver-
tisement, is apparently a candid fellow:—
A. CAESAR aut NULLUS.–Professor 's celebrated ToILET
GEM, a Luxuriant and Oriental Preparation for the Hair. Prepared and sold, &c.
As a scholar, the Professor knows that the name of Caesar signifies,
etymologically, a man with a bushy head of hair, a thing which, by a
natural confusion of names and persons, is popularly called a Brutus.
By “Aut. Caesar aut Mullus,” he of course means to say, only in
happier diction, “Aut Caesaries aut nulla,” or “either a Brutus or a
| head.” This is a very honest way of advertising a º or
hair-wash; it amounts to a plain profession that, as, regards the hair,
the article recommended is a remedy of the sort called “kill or cure.”
Any gentleman using the Professor's “luxuriant and Oriental prepara-
tion,” may therefore confidently expect, either, on the one hand, a
* Gentleman's Real Head of Hair,” or, on the other, what may be
truly described as an “Invisible Peruke.”
A Bill Long Due, but not Honoured yet.
It seems to be the general opinion, as well as the opinion of
MR. Roebuck, that there will be no Reform, Bill next year, on account
of the public mind being so much absorbed by the apprehensions of
an invasion. LoRD PALMERSTON, will perhaps smile at the Reform
bubble being pricked by a French bayonet. It is really too bad of
these Frenchmen!. If they have no craving for liberty themselves,
they need not do all they can to stifle what aspirations we may have.
Since they can have no freedom at home, they seem determined that
there shall be as little of it as possible abroad. It is petty spite
arising from the meanest jealousy.
How To KEEP PolicEMEN OUT OF YOUR KITCHEN.—Hire a cook
whose husband is a Policeman. He will take good care that no other
ºlºmºn is admitted to partake of the good things of your establish-
menu.
BRAVO, IPSWICH!
It gave Mr. Punch a fresh relish for his rasher, to read at breakfast-
time the following, in the Times of Friday last:-
“VoluntEER Corps.-Ipswich.-The Members of this Club have agreed to receive
volunteers unable to pay for their own outfit, on their being nominated by gentle-
men who have already contributed to the funds of the corps.”
The good sense and the common sense of this speaks for itself, and
needs not many words from Mr. Punch to speak for it. To make our
Rifle Clubs effective, we of course must make them national; and to do
this, we must throw them open to the nation. There must be no
exclusiveness or snobbism about them. A Rifleman, when serving, is
nothing but a Rifleman. Be he gentleman or gent he sinks it in the
Volunteer, and his social rank in no way raises or degrades him.
So if our poorer neighbours wish to join a corps, there should be
neither bar of money nor of modesty to hinder them. Those of us who
cannot serve should pay for those who can. Let the rich contribute
money while the poor contribute muscle. Their contributions then
may be considered pretty equal, and neither of them will need to feel
indebted to the other. They will take rank side by side as defenders
of their country, for while the one supplies the funds which are the
sinews of war, the other will be able to provide the muscles for it.
The Calculator's Assistant.
THIs valuable contrivance is a musical instrument, which plays a
variety of common tunes when turned by a handle. In the hands of a
dirty and verminous foreigner it affords a singular help to persons
engaged in abstruse mathematical calculations. Strongly recommended
by DR. BABBAGE, the celebrated author of the Calculating Machine.
OPERATIONS OF THE BOARD OF WORKS.
The Metropolitan Board of Works is a body which does not bear a
yery, good name. A Board which makes a mistake, in its accounts
involving a leakage of several thousand pounds to the advan of
private parties, ought rather, perhaps, to be called the Board of Jobs.

demanding to know

ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR ADMIRAL BOWLES.
“MR. PUNCH,
“Don’t you think that some sort of testimonial is due to old
ADMIRAL Bowles, Port-Admiral of Portsmouth, for the service which
he rendered the British Navy the other day by revoking the leave he
had given those sailors of the Princess Royal to go ashore, and turning
them, for no apparent reason, back to their ship? Of course he was
aware that this treatment of men, who had just returned from a long
cruise, was certain to drive them mad, and create a mutiny. His
courage, therefore, in determining to provoke them was admirable; and
his wisdom is justified by the event. Is it not attested by the fact that
there are now some 100 A. B.’s in Winchester gaol P Perhaps you will
think that the gallant old gentleman requires no other testimonial.
“I submit, however, that his judicious and meritorious conduct is
deserving of some public recognition. Consider its probable effect on
the affair of manning the fleet. We shall probably have to thank
ADMIRAL Bowles for an economy of public money, consequent on the
discouragement to enter the Navy, which his late exploit will have
afforded seamen. There will be the fewer hands, by many, to pay.
Let me, then, suggest that some token of the estimation which he has
fairly earned should be presented to him by a grateful nation. The
gift which I propose is an emblem of rest and retirement, and of some-
thing else which is better symbolised than named. handsomely
embroidered nightcap is the present I would have made to ADMIRAL
Bºwl Es. Especial care should be taken that the cap should have a
splendid tassel, and, to render it still more ornamental and significant,
it might also be decorated with two lateral appendages in the shape
of ears of a certain zoological type.
“This appropriate crown of glory should be worked and presented by
the hands of ladies, the fair sex being especially interested in all con.
duct and behaviour affecting the efficiency of the fleet which protects
Beauty from invasion. Give this proposal a lift with your stick,
Mr. Punch, and also try to knock into the heads of the Admiralty the
ropriety of promoting CAPTAIN BAILLIE and CoMMANDER Josling
or desert of an opposite description to that for which I advocate the
coronation of ADMIRAL Bowl Es.
“I have the honour to be, Sir,
“Your obedient servant,
“SUUM CUIQUE.”
“P.S. If the EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH has really any ‘intentions’
which a powerful Channel Fleet would be required to baffle, he ought
to send ADMIRAL Bowles the Cross of the Legion of Honour.”
Quadrille for County Balls.
IN Connection with the Baker Street Exhibition of the Smithfield
Club, we felt constrained this year to lament the departure of M.
JULLIEN. Had the Mons remained with us a little longer, he would
assuredly have composed a Cattle Show Quadrille; perhaps also an
Ox Waltz or two, and a Pig Polka, or polker dance. But he is gone;
and that unhappily being the case, cannot some native musical genius
take up the subject, and treat it in the more national and perhaps
more suitable style of a country dance?

GOOD NEWS FOR GOOD FIGURES.
UR delight is to interest
º- the ladies, and we now
transcribe for them a most
momentous piece of news,
which has within the last
few days been wafted here
from Paris:—
“The most important Fa-
shion news, at present is the
positive decline in the amount
of Crinoline, which is threat-
ened in high quarters to be
abandoned altogether, as well
as the long dresses, alread
shortening in front, so that
eful figures and pretty feet
{. have so long been
masked by their ferruginous
entourage) will be restored to
their rightful dominion.”
We tremble to contem-
plate the effect which
these few words may be
expected to produce on
womankind in general, and
on the less fair of the fair
sex in particular. Strain
our fancy as we may, it
refuses to imagine the
alarm and agitation into
which the MissEs Sky N-
NYE must infallibly be
thrown, on being j that
Crinoline is “threatened
in high quarters,” and that
Fº ere long it will
e utterly “abandoned.”
Still less can we conceive
the state of desperation to
dresses, it would not at all surprise us to be told
that some such warlike course as this had beeg
agreed upon, and that the SkyNNyes and the
SPLAYFoottes had boldly thrown off their alle-
giance to the Empress of the Fashions, or, to
ive her her other title, the EMPREss or the
RENch. But while we contemplate with terror
the sava indignatio which will seize our lankey
Junos, when they learn the brutal threat of
thus exposing their defects, we cannot but con-
gratulate the better favoured of the sex on their
freedom, from the tyranny to which they have
been subjected, and which has far too long, we
fancy; robbed them of their rights. We rejoice
that “graceful figures” will no longer be con-
y | cealed { their “ferruginous enºurage;” and
we are glad that “pretty feet” will be “restored
to their dominion,” from which they have so
wrongfully, we take it, been deposed. As the
“female form divine” is in our eyes much more
beautiful than any form of ironwork, we shall
delight to see it stripped of its ferruginous sur-
roundings, and its lower half reduced to its
more natural proportions; Crinoline, like death
levels all distinctions between ugliness and
beauty; and while lovely woman stoops to the
folly of wide petticoats, it is impossible to praise
her for the beauty of the figure. She may have
pretty feet, but nobody can see them; and
nobody of sense would take such gifts for
granted. Desinit in Crinoline mulier formosa
superne: and though her face and form be as
beauteous as a mermaid's, her extremities, for
ought that we can tell, may be as fishy.
THE following frightful attempt at wit was
º this morning, just after breakfast,
y that man Jones, whilst waiting with a few
friends for the conveyance to Town:—
which the Misses SPLAYEFootte will most likely be reduced, when they learn, alas! that
dresses are “shortening in front,” and that concealment by long skirts will no longer be
permitted them. Whether the aggrieved ones will forthwith unite their forces, and make
common cause against the enemies of Crinoline, is a matter which remains for history to
chronicle. But knowing to what lengths ladies lately have been going in the matter of their

CROSS AND DAGGER.
THE ardent devotion of the faithful Irish Ribbonman is beautifully
exemplified in a minatory missive, addressed to a gentleman, and pub-
lished in the Belfast News Letter. This edifying composition thus
commences :-
“PREPARE YOUR SHEET AND COFFIN.
“take Notice that for the Abuse you have Poowered on our Beloved Clergy in
comparing them to turkey Cocks I will Make a turkey cock of your Brains and A
scullabogue of your devils dens at No 10 Bridge Street for yºu done, all you could

our Clargey Must Be Respected and the demands of our Beloved and Apostolic
Bishops Must Be granted with Al due Honours to his Holiness Christs wicker on

His Holiness, &c. is perhaps sensible of the honour which he derives
from the circumstance of having so zealous a disciple as the author of
the foregoing denunciation, and of that which follows:–
“you think that old Blood hound—has one of our Respected Clergy in A fix. But
Never Mind if I don't fix him yet for I will Make Another Wild Gºose Lodge of him

as — or — or — one of the greatest ornaments in Belfast I Know you are
fond of this Kind of Music on the other sid so you can Just Clean your teeth on it
don't wonder at this for you shall have more"
What this pious Catholic means by the “music on the other sid” is
a copy of verses addressed to the EMPEROR, or THE FREnch, invitin
that sovereign to invade Ireland, and detach that jewel of an islan
from the British crown. The religious earnestness of the writer breaks
out no less in poetry than in prose, as, for example, in these pretty
lines:-
“May Holy MARY guard thy sleep

o Come and here My Children weep
that prays for thee NaroLir:N.
Louis NAPOLEoN, having accepted the invitation thus delivered:—
“the say to land is quite Absurd
Come Right Across then from Cherbourg"
-notwithstanding the slight geographical difficulty he would encounter
in so doing; having then marched without much further impediment
into the bowels of the land, and driven his bayonets into those of the
Saxon, the consequence according to this religious poet, will be that—
“then down will go great Englands Queen
No more again shel Er Be seen"
and Irish loyalty to the Pope having thus accomplished its purpose;
'º. zeal for the Catholic Faith will enjoy free agency, to the following
eitect-

, Alas! the alternative is the more probable, event. It is but too
likely that this model native of the Island of Saints will come to be
martyred-in a nightcap. These verses are signed “Molly MAGUIRE.”

This orthodox menace, which is dated, “Headquarters Belfast

It will be observed that a peculiar sign is appended to the name
of MAGUIRE. A like mark is prefixed to the signatures of “M. MA-
GUIRE” 's “Beloved and Apostolic Bishops;” and, from some of the
recent. Pastorals and speeches of those right reverend but furious pre-
lates, it would be natural to conjecture that the two similar marks
mean the same thing.

no use for him to think about his own. To wait on her must be the
business of his life, and though he do that “business first,” he finds
she will allow him little “pleasure afterwards.” With dragonlike
sharpsightedness she will watch his every movement, and keep an º:
upon his outgoings as well as his incomings. Her wants must be
satisfied without regard to his, and if she think of his at all it will be
only to prohibit them. She will cut him of his club, his claret, and
cigars, and make him live on toast and water to reduce him to sub-
mission. If he venture to remonstrate he will but put her on her
mettle, and have her gold flung in his teeth, which will effectually
silence him. It is of little use his threatening to sue for a divorce, for
she knows well enough that her money is tied up to her, and that
there’s no law as yet in this unhappy land by which a husband may
prefer a claim for separatemaintenance. -
All this, and much more, the man who weds for money finds out, in
the Moneymoon. The fancied sweets of married life turn acid on his
stomach, and, in nine cases in ten, quite sour him for life. Before the
end of the first week the Honeymoon has set, and the Moneymoon has
risen and shed its lurid light on him. It is by it that he first sees that
he is mated to what MR. T. CARLYLE would call a Money-bag, which,
wherever he may go, he will find a constant clog to him... And what
makes his burden still heavier to bearis, that nobody will give him the
least sympathy to lighten it. If he ever venture to complain of his
hard trial, the universal verdict is, “It Serves him Right!”
FUNNY BUNNY MONEY.
MEN, who fancy they know everything might perhaps be posed and
º were they asked to mention where and when, within the last
ve years, penny buns were used as a circulating medium. We would
* that not one in ten of the Knoweverythings would be able to
reply that the place in point was Jacobstad, and that the time was
during that of the last monetary crisis. . Writing from Helsingfors, a
correspondent of the Daily News says of the famous Fifty-seven pres-
sure :-
-- º: coinage was made use of as far as it went: but I know for a fact that at
a fair held at Jacobstad, in the Gulf of Bothnia, the tradespeople and peasantry
were so inconvenienced by the want of small coins that they employed penny buns
in giving change, and these circulated as copecks, from mantoman, during the
days of the fair.”
To the monetary mind there are several reflections suggested by
this statement, and when he writes again the Daily Newsman would do
well to clear up a few points in it which at present somewhat puzzle
us. We are curious to learn how long the Jacobstad Fair lasted, and
whether the penny buns, which were employed in giving change, were
subjected to any fluctuation in their value. Judging from one's own
experience in buns, one would imagine that their staleness would
depreciate the worth of them; and the buns which were baked at the
eginning of the fair, one would fancy, must have fallen much in value
% the end of it in England buns of yesterday are procurable at
) per cent.under their first price, and if four-and-twenty hours thus
depreciate their value, it is difficult to fancy what forty-eight or more
might do. Moreover, buns are not improved by being passed “from
man to man;”, and if the fair at Jacobstad lasted a whole week, we
should think the buns, first issued were long before the close of it
l
considered not negotiable.
Inquiring-minded persons might also like to know, if the penny
buns at Jacobstad were ever, halved by those who held them, so as to
do duty for, and take the place of, half-pennies. If so, it might be
asked how this process was effected; and whether, in clenching a close
bargain, the buyer ever stood out for having the first bite. e can
imagine how a holder of this new kind of cash would inquire every day
into the state of the bunny market, and ascertain if buns were
“tighter” or “easier”. than last quoted. , But it is difficult to cºn-
ceive how he at lunch-time could restrain himself from eating up his
capital, so long as the bun-coinage continued to be currant.

THE Bells I’ve Shamm'd on,
This town so grand on, .
Have made me famous among greater names.
Though silent swinging,
Nor proudly ringing,
They've sent no music over Father Thames.
I've stood all tremblin',
Neath the vaulted Kremlin,
While aisles vibrated with a solemn hum.
But what’s all their mettle
To Westminster's kettle?
That gave one bang out, and then was dumb!
Men were well wearied
Of chimes so varied,
And longed some simple song to hear;
And my cracked pitcher,
If it were not richer,
At least was newer to the world's car.
At midnight waking,
And thro' silence breaking,
Some bells would seem a solemn sound to tell:
A song of nations,
. In the deep vibrations,
Sending the echo, thro’ many a far-off dell.
But my harsh screamer,
With the shrill cry of steamer,
Awakes no memory of distant times,
Norrings a benizon,
But the knell of DENIsox,
Who first invented these cruel chimes.

and consumed only three hours in the clandestine dis-
cussion of the new arrangements which would be required on account
of the appointment of...MR. Woolhych as standing counsel to the
Board, at a salary of £800 a year. Then, at the instance of MR.
D'IFFANGER, a long discussion took place on the following question of
immense practical importance, whether considered in reference to
the health of the population, or the pockets of the ratepayers:—
Whether, at a meeting of the Íambeth vestry, MR. DEPUTY ON
had or had not made these remarks in reference to the Board:—
“He (Deputy HARRIson) said he could tell the vestry that the Metropolitan
Board of Works was governed by the Chairman; that no pro was made in
Committee, but at his option. Did the Deputy use these words?"
MR. DEPUTY HARRIsoN said that his language had been misreported
and in answer to various pressing invitations to be more explicit, an
repeat what he did say, persisted in simply denying that he had used
the words ascribed to him. This denial constituted the end, as it had
formed the beginning, of the whole debate, which having come to this
satisfactory conclusion, the matter dropped. -
The great public question, respecting the observations which MR.
Deputy HARRison had made in a vestry having thus been settled,
the Board devoted its energies to receiving communications, from
several parishes disapproving of the appointment of its legal adviser.
This onerous duty, having been accomplished, the active and most
efficient Council girded themselves to the trying task of receiving a
report from a committee, consisting of themselves (a committee of
the whole Board), relative to the duties to be performed, and salary
to be received by their future clerk, and nominating a person for
appointment to #. office. That fortunate fºllº; having been
º called in before them, they discharged, the arduous function
of receiving his thanks for the situation which they had given him.
“The other business,” says the report of these weighty transactions,
“was of a routine character, and the meeting then adjourned.” The
routine business got over, by the Metropolitan Board of Works, was
doubtless too difficult for description, if not for despatch. Perhaps it
consisted in the ºff of accounts, that is to say, overlooking them,

Sympathy with the Pope.
IN confirmation of one of the most wonderful of the alleged facts of
Mesmerism, it is stated that the sympathy of DR. CULLEN with the
Pope is so strong, that he can always tell if anybody is venerating his
Holiness by a pleasurable tingling sensation which he feels in his own
great toe.

THE FOUR FISHERS.
(who caught NoTHING.)
Four Merchants who thought themselves wisest and best
Of all the folks in Liverpool town,
To the EMPEROR Looey a letter addressed,
Intended to do him uncommonly brown:
“We'll sound his plans so dark and so deep,
From Liverpool brokers no secret he’ll keep,”
Said they, in their Lancashire toning.
Four Boobies went sniggering round all day
Among the folks in Liverpool town,
And thinking that none were so clever as they,
And how they should come to a great renown:
“We'll strike Lord PALMERston all of a heap,
And show we can catch a French weazel asleep,”
Said they, their impertinence owning.
Four Asses they hung down their lollopping ears,
When the post came in to Liverpool town,
And brought them a letter whereof it appears
Those donkeys couldn't translate a noun.
For Looey knows well how his secrets to keep,
And the Liverpool brokers unluckily reap
A harvest of jeering and groaning.

COMPLAISANCE AND RIFLES.
To His GRACE THE DUKE of RUTLAND.
My LoRD DUKE,
IN proposing “The Army and Navy,” at the Annual Dinner
of the Leicestershire Afººl Society, at Leicester, on Friday last,
our Grace is reported to have made a speech with some sense in it,
§. also containing the passage following:-
“Circumstances, time, steam, and science have swept away our defences.
(Hºor, hear.) Formerly it was impossible for an army to land here without having
to encounter, in a naval engagement, a superior fleet. That is no longer necessary.
It is now pos-ible in a few hours to land an enormous army in this country. (Hear,
hear.) But gentlemen, when I say therefore, for God's sake let us put this country
in an efficient state of defence—let us cºll ºut the militia, encourage the rifle corps,
and do all we can to make ourselves safe—I say also, let us not, in the same breath
—which is not necessary—abuse the uler whom the French people have chosen,
or run down the Church which they choose to support. (Cheers.)”
If the British Navy is really the nullity which your Grace represents
it to be—if there exists the possibility of landing an enormous army on
the coast of England in a few hours—then, my Lord Duke, don't you
think that the Channel Fleet is a humbug, and, seeing that it is, if a
humbug, a very expensive humbug, are you not further of opinion that
we had better instantly break it up and abolish it, and employ the
money saved by that operation in maintaining a standing army to
afford us that protection which we can now no longer hope for from
our wooden walls
In a subsequent portion of your speech, your Grace appears to have
criticised, at some length, the financial and republican principles of
MR. BRight. There are, however, some views which that gentleman,
in common with the Peace Society, is supposed to entertain, and which
also seem to coincide with the sentiments of your Grace. The impro-
priety of abusing the EMPERoR of The FREnch, wantonly and
maliciously, is manifest. Such abuse, however, is improper surely
because it is malicious and wanton, not because it is dangerous. Does
your Grace mean to say that abstinence from criticism of the conduct
of powerful foreign princes ought, for the future, to form an important
element in our precautions for the defence of the nation? By way of
security against invasion, would you have our naval deficiency supplied
by obsequious silence?
Such really appears to be the course of policy which your Grace
would recommend your countrymen to follow: for not only do you
advise them to abstain from abuse of the ruler whom the French people
have chosen, but also to desist from running down the religion which
they choose to support. We are not only, at that rate, to respect any
despot whom the French may please to serve, but also any nonsense
which they may think proper to maintain. The French are ready to
invade us for an Idea, let us, therefore, defer to the theological Idea
which they propose to our veneration. Your Grace believes this
compound ić. to consist, in as far as it differs from your own, of
absurdities and falsehoods; but you say, let us not run it down, for
fear lest the bayonets which Jºli it should run us through.
In the mean time, for your Grace's comfort, let me remind your
Grace that the papers which have been now for some time principally
engaged in maligning Louis NApoleoN are those of the Ultramontane
Irish Press. For instance the Freeman, which vindicates its name by
º the political emancipation of the Italians, has recently been
vehemently attacking the EMPERoR of the FRENch. In one of the
late numbers of this truly Irish advocate of freedom, occur the following
slaps at his Imperial Majesty:—
“Why should histºry be falsified to humour Emperor or State? France has done
more injury to the Holy See than any other State in Europe. ... ... We have not
an opinion or word to retract relati e to the policy of Loßis NApoleon. . The
Freuch bishops arraign the policy of the Empire in Italy. We have done no more.”
Thus your Grace will see that the Church which the French choose
to º is itself actually engaged in running down the ruler whom
they have chosen. Take up the Tablet, and you will find the same
fact exemplified. The organs of the Pope are vituperating Louis
NApoleon just now as venomously as they assaiſ the EARL of
SHAFTESBURY: I do not think that their object, in traducing and
denouncing him, is to provoke him to invade their native, country,
simply because they know that to make him their enemy is to con-
stitute him the friend of the British people at large. Your Grace will
pº not much longer be alarmed by abuse of the EMPERok of THE
"RENch now that the British Public are aware of the circumstance
that Louis NApoleoN, Just at present, has the distinguished honour
of being the special object of the hatred and invective of fanatical Irish
titular ecclesiastics. }. in the meanwhile, enjoy that of remaining
Your Grace's most obedient humble Servant,
49&ANC#.
A New Turn to an Old Question.
THERE is a brisk fire of letter-writing just now about “Works of
Art found in the Drift.” The question we should feel, inclined to ask
is not, “Are there many Works of Art in the Drift;" but “Is there a
Drift in many Works of Art?”

MOPS AND BROOMS.
SoME considerable excitement was occasioned, we believe, in the
fashionable world, by the letter-press attached to a recent cut in Punch,
wherein a gentleman was spoken of as being “Mops and Brooms.”
“Mopth and Broomth !” exclaimed Miss SIMPERTON. “Now, what
can, Mithter Punth'th artitht, mean by “Mopth and Broomth P', I
can't gueth what it ith. I muthtathk Couthin AUGUTIITUTH. Couthin
AUGUTHTUTH, can you tell me what ith meant by ‘Broomth and
Mopth?’” And Cousin Augustus, when appealed to, doubtless
made the . reply that it was meawly—aw—slang phwase, with which
—aw—gyurls of course were not expected to be conversant. Then, on
being, further questioned (Miss SIMPERTON declaring that, she does
“tho love thiang phwatheth”), Cousin AUGUSTUs, it is probable, ex-
plained that “Mops and Brooms” was an equivalentexpression forgettin
‘tight” or “scwewed,” or whatever term be used to signify inebriated.
Another meaning is, however, attached to the word “mops,” of
which young lady-readers are no doubt in equal ignorancº, and it is
therefore our delight to explain it and enlighten them. A “mop” is,
in some counties, a synonym for “fair,” and is used to denote a
hiring place for farm-servants. Whether “mops” be worth preserving
for the queerness of their name, just as certain dogs are kept for the
queerness of their looks, is a question which we leave philosophers to
argue. That there is any other reason which can plead for their
retention, is a point, we apprehend, which admits of no dispute. At
a meeting held at Worcestº, the speakers, speaking from experience,
averred that Statute fairs, or “mops,” were mischievous, and needless,
and unprofitable nuisances; and that the best ...; to be done with
them was, to trundle them away into the dust-hole of disuse.
Said LoRD LYTTELTON, the chairman:—
“That these mops were evils was beyond controversy; the only question was
whether they were necessary evils, or were counterbalanced by attendant advan-
tages. Looking at these mops as applicable for the object which they professed—
the en ment of agricultural servants—he could not see that they were either
convenient or desirable means to the end. The relations between mastor and
—
servant ought to be commenced on a different ºf: there should be some
previous mutual acquaintance, and some knowledge of the respective character
of both master and servant, which could not exist under a system of hiring at
mops. All must depend, as it were, on an engagement at first sight, and *::::
ent upon the physical qualities of the servant. ut, beyond this, there must be an
evil in the promiscuous gathering together of young persons of both sexes without
control, and there was with mops an evil which did not necessarily attend other
oublic gatherings for a particular object. Why should the assembling together of
armers and their servants for the purpose of hiring entail these evils? The answer
given was that it was not necessary at all, but that the collecting together of large
numbers of persons attracted others for the sake of profit.”
Sufficient reasons these why mops should be mopped out, and their
stains be wiped away from the face of rural England. There is one
}. however, to be thought of ere discarding them, which LoRD
YTTELTON proceeded to dispose of thus:–
“With regard to the question of providing some recreation and amusement for
the labourers in lieu of the mops, he was aware that that point had been discussed,
but it was not intended to propose at this meeting any organised system of recre-
ation for those classes. He thought that was a subject that might safely be left to
take its natural course. It was a subject which was very much thought of in these
days, and he thought that the employers of labour, under the advice of the clergy
and gentry resident around them, would be found willing and ready to provide a
better and a far more unobjectionable mode of amusement than that afforded by the
mops for those whom they employed. (Hear, hear.)”
Whether or no “hops” might, under due restrictions, be held instead
of “mops,” is a point which may be argued by those who like to do so;
Dancing is, by many, thought a healthy, wholesome exercise, and
under proper supervision, it might not only improve the deportment of
our clod-hoppers, but also, very possibly, amend, their moral bearing:
Rifle practice too would be a “far more unobjectionable mode of
amusement” than that which is at present afforded by a “mop;” and
although the wives and sweethearts could not take such active steps
in it as they would do in the dancing, the º: perform the looking-
on part, as their sisters do in Switzerland, and stimulate the shooters
without giving them strong drinks. But be this done or not, it is at
any rate high time that the “Statutes” be repealed; and whatever
recreation be established in their stead, there must clearly be some
brooms found to sweep away the “mops.”

But first he set his heart upon
His stock of beeves and swine;
His mind to cattle most was given,
And “darn,” he swore, “my wig'
But I will breed the hugest ox,
And rear the fattest pig.”
This point of honour, weight of swine,
And ox as highly scored,
He proved it at the Smithfield Club,
Before both squire and lord,
And cried as to the judges' view
He bore the monsters big.
“Now bain't this here the hugest ox?
That there the fattest pig’”
They owned his victory—due the palm—

WE are requested by Wiscount PALMERston to publish the fol-
lowing letter, which was addressed to HERMAJESTY by four Merchants
of Marseilles, and the reply.
“MADAME, “Marseilles, Dec. 15th, 1859.
“THE EMPEROR of this country is an impenetrable mystery,
and his ministers are slaves. It is of no use, therefore, for us to apply
to them for information as to probable events in Europe, We should
receive an invitation to mind our own business. Under these circum-
stances, we take the liberty of requesting your MAJESTY to favour us
with a little news. We learn that England is arming from end to end,
that from John Grouts to Silly Isle, from Osbon to Berric, the bugle
calls the riflemen to drill, that many millions of these Woluntaires are
*:::::::::: and that they are full of the martial spirit.
“Manifestly, Madame, there is but one nation of the world that is
worth the enmity of England. She has chastised other nations, but
as one chastises a child for his good, and with no particle of hate. But
France she hates, as her superior, with a fierce and an undying hatred.
England thirsts to renew the § of Agincourt and Poictiers, of
Malplaquet and Blenheim, of Salamanca and Waterloo. She asks
once more to see her coarse-fed legionaries rampant in the Champs
Elysées... We need hardly say, Madame, that we do not hold you
responsible for the evil hearts of your people. It is your misfortune
to be Queen of such a race, and you have our sympathy.
“But, Madame, as business is very much interfered with by the
†. of war, and as we have no burning desire to purchase costly
fabrics of cloth and velvet to be the spoil of British cruisers, we take
the liberty of asking your MAJESTY what your Councillors design to
do... Is this mighty force of Rifles intended for the invasion of France,
or is your ferocious Army to be used for that malignity, while the
Voluntaires protect the coast from the avenging fury of our troops?
e shall be much obliged by a reply by return of post. We en-
close a postage-stamp, and are,

and her President—all jostling, buffetting, rebelling, and revolu-
tionising, that the wonder would be if the “Plate” were not—not
that it is—“cracked” beyond all hope of mending.

THE SUEZ CANARD.
CossiperABLE, astonishment has been caused by the fact that
France, Austria, Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia, have united in a demand
calling on the Sublime Porte to authorise the project of M. DE LEsseps
for cutting through the Isthmus of Suez. The scheme, if carried into
execution, would shorten the way to India. What is that to any other
European Power than England? is the natural question of people who
are not generally considered particularly green and innocent. But it
is not everybody that can see into the heart of a millstone. We do not
hesitate to say, that we are endowed with the faculty of thorough
clairvoyance, because we are, as we have demonstrated to the satisfac-
tion of everybody many thousands of times.
We now proceed to afford one more proof, of the lucidity which we
enjoy always, and not merely at intervals, like some seers. The five
nations above-named, have conspired to destroy the greatness of Eng-
land. Their little game is to acquire the control of the Company whic
is to execute the proposed undertaking. When the Ship Canal shall
have been completed, and shall divide the Isthmus, and connect the
Mediterranean with the Red Sea, they intend to throw across it two
large toll-bars; one at the hither, end, and the other at the farther
extremity: .. They will thus establish two ocean-turnpikes, through
which will lie the nearest way to the East,
Having completed this arrangement, they will immediately proceed
to put in act, for the ruin of British commerce, an ingenious expedient
of that system of protection, which continental nations have already
so greatly, enriched themselves º pursuing. º will levy a pro-
hibitive toll on British shipping, allowing the vessels of all the rest of
the world to pass at moderate rates, so as to have the start of our
merchant ships, and forestall our traffic. We, they reckon, shall, if
they will not let us through the Suez Canal, be obliged quietly to turn
back, and creep our old way round the Cape of Good Hope. They
will, of course, appoint for turnpike-men two famous admirals, each in
command of a vast fleet, in case a British captain should make any
mad attempt to break the bar, or force his way through without paying.
This deep-laid plot will be crowned with success, for how will Great
Britain be able to withstand it? Great Britain will, indeed, become
Little Britain; her Eastern commerce will be annihilated; and her
Indian empire will pass into, the hands of rulers, who not only know
how to govern foreign dependencies, but also how to keep their own
people in order. The sun of En land will set for ever; and Europe
be, consequently, a little in the dark. Then will the five great Powers,
who will have accomplished the overthrow of perfidious Albion,
quarrel among themselves: there will be a struggle: the event whereof
will be, that France will get the upper hand; and finally, for the hap-
}. of all mankind, the Indian Ocean will be converted into a French

ROYAL CHILD’S PLAY IN SPAIN.
EE how pretty all this is'
“The Madrid journals of the
10th say that on the preceding
day two flags, offered by the
Queen and King to the army in
Morocco, were solemnly conse-
crated in the Royal Chapel, in
presence of their Majesties. One
of these flags, that offered by the
Queen, has embroidered on *
side an image of the Immaculate
Conception, and on the other the
Royal arms; the flag offered by
the King bears on one side the
images of Our Lady of Forget-
fulness, Our Lady of Triumph,
and Our Lady of Mercy; and on
the other a crucifix." |
The picture, presented in
the above, extract. from
recent foreign intelligence,
of the QUEEN, and KING
of SPAIN united in playing
at religion and soldiers,
must be contemplated with
pleasure by jº. amiable
mind. Joining their little
flags, all worked in fine
colours, as a present to their
little army, they seem to
resemble a little brother
and sister rather than a man and wife, and exhibit an edifying spectacle
of innocence. What delightful unsuspicion of the horrors and atroci:
tics of war is betokened in the standards embroidered with images of
the “Immaculate Conception” and "Our Lady!”, What a truly lady-
like idea of things of that sort—things the least horrible of which is
the death of men who are lucky enough to have their brains dashed to
atoms by a cannon-ball, What would her Spanish Majesty say to
“Our Lady of Amputation?” The pretty pictures are funny, as well
as pretty—funny, of course, only in a lovely infantile way. What sort
of an image that of the “Immaculate Conception” can be, it is hard to
conjecture, since what is meant by the words is itself, entirely incon-
ceivable in any physical form. The symbol is probably...some play-
thing which the QUEEN or SPAIN was pleased, in giving it that title,
to christen by one of those odd names which we are wont to hear our
youthful daughters or nieces give their ". The images on her
Royal Consort's flag are also º unny, regarded as orna-
mental figures chosen to decorate a bawble by a great baby. . Their
names also appear to be the inventions of undeveloped intellect.
“Our Lad ºp Mercy” is charmingly out of place on the banner
under which the Spanish forces will march to slaughter the Moors if

“Our Lady of Triumph” may prove an emblem of reckoning chickens
before they are hatched. What “Our Lady of Forgetfulness”, may
be supposed to mean, we are at a loss to divine. ... Our Lad

Remembrance” would be more to the purpose of recalling the glories
of Spanish chivalry. , “Let by-gones be by-gones,” is a very Christian
sentiment; but one does not see what it can have to do on his Spanish
Majesty's war-flag. If the KING of SPAIN were a great man, of
course we should say that he is the best judge of his own colours; and
but that he is manifestly a nice little man, and his spouse a sweet
little woman, there would not perhaps be wanting those who might
suggest that “Our Lady of Forgetfulness” may be considered as
synonymous with “Our Lady of Condonation.”
SETTLERS FOR SHAKESPEARIANS.
Is it reasonable to suppose that Othello was out fishing when he
remarked to Desdemona, “Perdition catch thy sole” ”
*Then let the kettle to the trumpet speak!” Is this reading
correct? Should it not be rather, “Then let the trumpet to the kettle
speak!” Speaking-trumpets are, and long have been, quite common.
But what grounds have we for believing that in the time when
SHAKESPEARE wrote, any more than in our own, there was such an
instrument as a speaking kettle?
“My tables' meat it is, I set it down.” May this be cited as a
proof that Hamlet was a butcher?
What authorities can you quote for the popular belief that the man
Macbeth called “whey...face” was in reality a Kurd?

A COUGH IN THE HOUSE.
A-HACK! That cough! Ack-ack! That cough again!
Oh, how it tears through my distracted brain!.
Yack! Mercy Heaven! how can I read or write!
Ack-kack-kack-kack! noise seems made out of spite.
Ahacka—hash! mine ear what tortures rack!
}} shattered nerves! their tender threads will crack. .
A-hawk! Qh, don't! Those thorns mine ear-drums prick.
Yawk! Ackſ Yaw—hawk | Forbear! I shall be sick!
Ahawm! Ahack! This torment is too bad!
Ahash! Hack! Hash! That row will drive me mad!
So it fº on. I stamp—I tear my hair–
Iyell—I shriek—forgive me, if I swear!.
My groans and cries, if heard my room without,
Pass for the screams of toothache or the gout,
Or by the hearer are perchance divined
To speak mysterious agonies of mind.
What if their cause my fell tormentor knows?
I’m sure she could control it if she chose:
Thought, if allowed, to fury which will lash
Mine irritated soul! Another crash! -
My senses whirl. Ye Powers, preserve my wits,
And let me not be worried into fits:
Oh ...; my reason!—take me to your care,
Or else I shall be goaded to despair!
I stop mine ears with cotton to exclude
Those dreadful sounds which still, alas! intrude; "
I bind my kerchief round my throbbing brow,
And §. it in vain—I hear them now!—
Ah! blessed are the Deaf, I moan, with tears,
And wish I had old SURD's unfeeling ears.
Oh, I exclaim, for some less painful sound
Wherein those hideous noises might be drowned'
Oh, for the crowing of a neighbour's fowl'
Oh, for ten thousand mongrel dogs to howl!
Qh, for that greatly preferable bore,
Å knocking carpenter at work next door!
For some harmonious blacksmith o'er the way,
Pig killed close by, or hungry donkey's bray,
F'en for an organ-grinder i could pray,
Öut in the street to stand before my house, and play.
“Pulmonic Wafers” I would fain implore
To stay that plague, or stuff called “Cough No More;”
A doctor, nay, a quack, I'd richly fee
From such a nuisance to deliver me.
Oh, you who may these frantic verses scan,
And have a cough—restrain it if you can.
Sad is a sore affection of the chest,
As sad are peace disturbed, and broken rest.
Expectoration's grievous need I know:
But think, oh, think upon the hearer's woe!
Relieve the bosom with an effort mild:
Drive not your nervous fellow-creature wild.
THE BELLS ON BIG BEN.
Big BEN's case looks scaly, say the bells of Old Bailey;
His voice is quite gone, say the bells of St. John;
He's chock full of holes, peal the bells of All Souls;
Must go to the forge, chime the bells of St. George;
Even my voice is sweeter, sneer the bells of St. Peter;
He ain’t worth two fardens, snarl the bells of St. Martin's;
Case of too many cooks, growl the bells of St. Luke's;
Don't know what they're about, howls St. Botolph Without;
MEARs, DENIson chides, say the bells of St. Bride's;
Well, d'ye think MEARs is wrong? asks St. Mary's ding dong;
I don't, if you do, says the belfry at Kew ;
It's a great waste of tin, tolls St. Botolph Within;
And the cash must come from us, growl the bells of St. Thomas;
Aye, every shilling, add the bells of St. Helen;
And we're not over-rich, groan the bells of Shoreditch;
It makes one feel ranc'rous, say the bells of St. Pancras ;
Yes, that's for sartin, again rings St. Martin;
But what's to be done, once more peals St. john;
Bang'd if I know, tolls the big bell of Bow.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IMAGINARY CONVERSATION.
LoRD PALMERSTON. THE ATToRNEY-GENERAL.
Iord P. WELL, SIR RICHARD, how are º: Deuced cold weather.
Come near the fire. And now, Who's to be our new Solicitor?
Att.G. My dear LoRD PALMERsion, all my information,ºn the
subject is derived from the columns of the Times newspaper. There I
see mentioned the names of certain gentlemen, anyone of whom would
make a more or less desirable successor to my talented friend SIR
HENRY KEATING.
Lord P. Rather less than more, eh?
Att.-G. I am not, prepared to say that, Indeed I am not prepared
to say anything on the subject. I have given it no consideration. If
I had, I might possibly have suggested that—where is the journal in
question (takes it up)—that those who—where is it, here—that those
who “mention the name” of MR. EDw1N JAMEs, mention the name of
a gentleman of-of considerable success.
Lord P. Well, we all know all about him. If he were Member for
anywhere else but Marylebone, the thing would be well enough. -
Att-G. Your Lordship is too much a man of the world to be afraid
of associating with anybody. - -
I've no time to be particular. And JAMEs is a very clever
man, and tells a capital story, and all that; but while he is the Delegate
of those Marylebone Westry snobs, you know, my dear SIR RICHARD,
who would not object to be his colleague. ..
Att.-G. Nobody more than the haughty little nobleman who created
the borough of Marylebone. Besides, that—a-that Epistle of JAMES
the other day about indicting the masters in the strike affair, showed
that he was in no hurry for office. - -
Lord P. He is all i. and can wait. Besides, he can do better
service from an independent battery just now. -
Att.-G. Then I observe, or rather I am apprised by this paragraph,
that another name which is “mentioned” is that of MR. CAPULET
Hºmº. as some of my gay young friends have been pleased to call
llin.
Lord P. MontAGUE CHAMBERs?, . -- ---
Att.-G. I assume it to be a simple impossibility that there was ever
any idea of §§ him.
Iord P. Well, I don’t know. Why. There’s stuff in him.
Att.-G. There indubitably is, and rum stuff, if I may be pardoned a
colloquialism. -
Lord P. He’d pitch into the Papishes, con fuoco, Mr. Attorney.
Att.-G. I am not here to deny the value of MR. CHAMBERs' vitu-
rative faculty, when stimulated by real or assumed theologicalacerbity;
ut. I am unaware that it is the precise business of HER MAJESTY's
Solicitor-General to fustigate a very important portion of HER
MAJESTY's subjects,
Lord P. Especially when HER MAJESTY's Attorney-General can do
the thing in the most superior style! ..
4tt.:G. You are pleased to be complimentary, my dear lord.
. Lord P. Not a bit. I thoroughly concur with my friend Mr. Punch
in thinking you as effective and damaging a debater as ever went in
for slaughter. But you are too good to be used up on the Irish. You are
not a bludgeoneer—to quote Billy, “ you carve your enemy as a dish
fit for the gods, not hew him as a carcase for the hounds.” We’ll ask
you to keep yourself for worthy antagonists—I want a hard-mouthed
tly who will knock fellows down and stamp on them.
tt.-G. What do you say to TEAR’EM
Lord P. Will you undertake for collar and chain?—if so, yes.
Att-G. I’ll see him—I mean that such an undertaking would be an
unwelcome addition to my present responsibilities.
Lord P. He would mind you.
Att.-G. I would take precious good care he did, if I had him in
hand; but—in fact, my suggestion was not serious.
Lord P. No; but the best hints often come out of a joke. I have a
very good mind to send for John Annun.
Att.-6. In that case, have the kindness to send for somebody else.
Lord P. Anybody you like—Who?
. Att.-6. Nay, anybody you like, who can replace the humble indi.
vidual who addresses you.
Lord P. What, you won't have TEAR’EM at any price?
4tt.:G. Not even at his real value.
Lord P. You've been reading ToMMY MooRE--
“Of all speculations the market holds forth
The best that I know, for a lover of poiſ,
Is to buy Roebuck up at the price he is worth,
And then sell him at that which he sets on himself.”
. Att.G., The epigram suits him as well as if written for him. I
imagine that we may pass on to another name.
Lord P. “Gregory, o' my word we’ll not carry coals.”
Att.-G. “No, for then we should be Colliers.”
Lord P. He has waited a long time,
Att.-G. Is it too antiquated a ribaldry to reply, that he must now be
so accustomed to waiting, that a still further postponement will not
be very afflicting P
Lord P. Yes, but where are you to find a better man? For nobody
knows better than you that we want a good one.
Att.-G. I suppose I may assume that almost any change would be
an improvement upon the late occupant of the office in question.
Lord P. If that means that you’ve got a dull man for me, I reply,
No such . and that KEATING was a capital fellow. I won’t have
a Worse, mind.
Att.-6. I have been accused of enterprise, but I never essayed
iº,
Lord P. Who's your man—out with him. -
Att.-G. Do not let me intrude my suggestions., Perhaps your lordship
has some bright particular star of your own whom you wish to insert
into the ministerial firmament?
Lord P.. I dare, say there are lots of barristers, who would make
better Solicitors than any we are likely to lay hand on; and if I had
# time to go down to the Temple and look 'em up, I'll be hanged
if I wouldn't choose my own man, and take you what odds you like I
didn’t get a bad one.
Att.-G. There is a little volume in red, increasing in bulk, I regret
to say, yearly, and called the Law List, which would save your lord-
ship the necessity of perambulating the precincts in question. You
will there find the name of .# gentleman in the profession, from
my LoRD CHANCELLOR down to the last call. -
Lord P. I never read print. I don't think I could if I tried now—
I’ve had my Prayer-book copied out in an official hand for me—and
I’ve no time to go to the Temple, . So, who's your man?
Att-G. I am really unprepared to advise, but if I suggested any-
body it would be my friend MR. ATHERTON.
d P. Hm. Is Durham safe f
Att.-G. That is all arranged. - -
Lord P. Let's see—he's a bit of a Radical, isn't he?—rather goes in
or—
Att.-G. For the Solicitor-Generalship, my dear lord, , Judging from
other flºº. who have had that ambition, I think, it would be
illiberal to suppose that his Liberality will interfere with his Wºndering,
either by speech or silence, the requisite service to HER MAJESTY's
Government.
Lord P. He's not a bad man? - -
| . Att.-G. I had hoped that proposition was implied in my proposing
llm.
Lord P. I never heard anything against him.
Att.-G. Nor I, until this instant. Your lordship's last words are the
unkindest thing that can be said of anybody.
Lord P. I can't tell. It was never said of me. Will }. tell the
gentleman that if he'll call here, he may hear of something to his
advantage. By the bye, have you heard the good thing that somebody
said about our poor dear friend, the Duchess or—--

your Bedouin's dress—(um,_um,)—will return it in a day or two, as I've, (Ah! What!) sent it—

[The Artist's feelings (for colour especially) may be easier imagined than described.
COMMON CRIERS.
It is surprising how infectious tears are at a wedding. First of all the Bride cries, because
she’s jº. be married; and then of course the Bridesmaids cry, perhaps, because they are
not; and then the fond Mamma cries, because she’ll 1–1–lose her d-d-darling: and then
the fond Papa cries, because he thinks it’s proper: and then all the ladies cry, because
ladies as a rule will never miss a chance of crying; and then, perhaps, the Groomsmen cry
to keep the ladies company: and then the old Pewopener cries, to show what deep ſpecuniary)
interest she takes in the proceedings; and then, perhaps, the public cries, the public
being, of course, composed exclusively of petticoats. ut, notwithstanding all these
Niobes, who make, quite a Niagara of eyewater around him, we own we never
tº: seen the Bridegroom cry, and should about as soon expect to hear the Beadle
ulouer.
CHRISTMAS TREES.
CoME fog—come frost—who counts the cost,
Of wood and coal at Christmas-time?
Bring winter in, to warm his chin,
And thaw his coat of rime.
Let those that have help those that lack
To food and fire—to game and glee—
Pile high the screen of berried green,
And plant and deck the Christmas-tree.
The tree that like this blesséd time
Of peace, good-will, on earth, on high,
Thrº frost and snow green boughs doth
snow,
Hope's hue, 'neath winter's sky.
In wealth’s warm room how brave they bloom,
Hung with child-treasures, bright to see:
Butlet us think, that cold and gloom
Should also have their Christmas-tree.
A littleº will plant it there,
A trifling cost will deck its boughs.
The rare full meal of common fare,
The once-a-year carouse,
oarse means of warmth for back and bed,
A blaze where cold bars wont to be—
Such are the gifts we’ll help to spread,
Upon the poor man's Christmas-tree.
And if that nations have a life
That may collective mercies own,
In Britain's heart what thanks were rife,
For God’s hand o'er her shown!
What boughs were broad enough to bear
The gifts she takes by land and sea?
Small wonder hungrierlands elsewhere
Should envy England's Christmas-tree.
As we are rich let us bestow
A thought on poorer nations round;
Letting our fulness overflow,
Giving, as we abound.
Till lands show bright where now is night,
And Europe's borders see
Arise for them, that noblest stem—
Undying Freedom's Christmas-tree!
HAPSBURG HUMILITY.
PRINCE METTERNIch said, on the part of his
master, a nice thing the other day to Louis
NApoleon—if this is what he said, as the Mont-
teur avers:–
“SIRE,--The EMPERoR, my master, in deigning to
appoint me his Ambassador to your Imperial Majesty,
particularly impressed upon me to convince you of the
value of your personal friendship."
The year is ending with a somewhat better
understanding between the two Emperors than
that with º it began. In the meantim
one of them has given the other a º
thrashing. METTERNIch delivers a message
from a sovereign who has evidently been licked
into shape. It is neat and elegant, if not straight-
forward; but we must allow a little, for the
usual humbug of diplomacy. If the Ambassador
had plainly spoken the mind of, the monarch,
whose sentiments he had slightly to disguise,
he would perhaps have said something of this
sort:-"Sire, In sending me to kiss your Im-
perial Majesty's foot, the EMPEROR, my master,
particular ãº me to º deep im-
pression which it has made upon person, and
the conviction which he feels in consequence of
our having so well kicked him, that he had
*: endeavour to keep on good, terms with
you.”. FRANcis-Joseph might, with a view to
conciliation in Congress, as well, perhaps, salute
Louis NApoleon's toe by proxy, at once, as
thank him in a circuitous, if graceful manner, for
chastisement received at the tip of it.

THE WOLUNTEERS.
3. 33allab of the Qſimts,
'Twas when of any fear of war no Briton felt a particle ..
The Times came out one morning with a most exciting article,
The Editor saw far ahead with swift prophetic glance,
Midst hordes of little red-legged men, the Oriflamme of France
Borne onward by a burglar-host, who burned with plunder’s zest
To pillage London, sack the Bank, and bolt with all the “rest!”
Forthwith the warning telegram was flashed along the wire,
Forthwith the British bosom flamed with patriotic fire. . .
Then rang around the trumpet-call—no moment this to trifle,
Up Britons, shoulders to the wheel, and shoulders to the rifle!
Then far and fast the watchword passed, Be ready for the foe.
Thus forth did float the bugle-note, the herald-call to arms;
It reached the busy husbandmen amidst their flocks and farms;
It reached the merchant bending calmly o'er his blue-lined page,
With heart and hand the merchants band, the rightful strife to wage.
It stirred the stalwart artisan–Oh men of brain and sinew
Invader foes who come to blows, will find what metal's in you!—
The blacksmith left his forge awhile, the miller stopped his mill, , , ,
In black and white their vestments dight they hied them to the Drill.
No stint the country gentlemen displayed of martial labours,
But blazed away from day to day at peril of their neighbours. .
The sportsman for his smooth-bored gun provided bullet cartridges,
dy for red-legged buccaneers, as if for red-legged partridges.
Such rush there was for rifle-gear among those loyal men;
Such times had tailors never seen, and never may again;
And Beauty's brightest glances fell, in that eventful day,
To gallants of the belt and pouch all garmented in grey.
Through royal London warlike talk was heard on every hand,
#. swelling 'mid the City, surging westward through the Strand.
Belgravia's lordly mansions then the hot commotion share,
It stirred a gentle flutter 'midst the dovecotes of May Fair.
The kingly fanes of Westminster now heard the martial din;
The #. of volunteers was raised in Lincoln's Inn,
The frescoed hall with measured tramp resounded to the raſter,
Till passers-by much marvelled what those learned men were after.
And East and West, and South and North, through every class and clan,
The warning watchword “be prepared” flew on from man to man.
No idle show was all this stir, no vain fanfaronade,
For, while a hearty prayer for peace each loyal marksman made,
One strong resolve his bosom filled, all doubts and fears abolishing,
To give the foe, should need arise, a proper good French polishing!
PEST-CABS.
CoMPLAINT has been made lately that Small Pox is on the increase,
and among the many causes which have been alleged for this, it is said
that smallpox patients are often put in cabs, and infection so transmitted
to the persons who next ride in them. In this blessedly free country
it is difficult, of course, to interfere with ancient liberties; and a
cabman, if accused of having knowingly admitted small-poxed persons
to his cab, would bellow out some {. about his “vested
rights,” and breathe defiance, mixed with blasphemy, at any “Beak”
who tried to punish him. But without interfering with our Ancient
Institutions, or in any way sapping the foundations of the State, might
not some course be suggested for preventing in some measure this
damage to the public, without causing at the same time any damage to
the Cabman? Without limiting in any way the liberty of the subject,
or professing disbelief in “The right divine of cabmen to drive wrong,”
it surely might be feasible to have specially marked cabs for hirers
specially afflicted, and which only should be suffered to drive up to a
ospital; applicants in unmarked cabs not being suffered to approach.
Or, there might be different cab-classes established; and those who
paid for first-class vehicles might insist on a certificate that the cab was
not infected, and if this proved false, the cabman might be made to
ride in his own vehicle, after the manner of the genius who made the
Brazen Bull. At all events, something must be done to disinfect our
|cabs, else people will regard them as equivalent to hearses, to which
they are in many cases only the next step. A law of Public Safety
must certainly be passed, if it be only to preserve a good name for our
cabs; for so long as they entail such risks upon the public, it is clearly
quite absurd to call them Patent Safety Vehicles.
Medical Intelligence.
A YouNG Lady, residing not a hundred miles from Muddleditch, and
whose brother was “walking” '...'s kindly wrote to say, she would
willingly send up to him her left-o Skeleton Petticoat, if the study of
its anatomy would be of any use to him.

To pillage London, sack the Bank, and bolt with all the “rest!”
Forthwith the warning telegram was flashed along the wire,
Forthwith the British bosom flamed with patriotic fire. . .
Then rang around the trumpet-call—no moment this to trifle,
Up Britons, shoulders to the wheel, and shoulders to the rifle!
Then far and fast the watchword passed, Be ready for the foe.
Thus forth did float the bugle-note, the herald-call to arms;
It reached the busy husbandmen amidst their flocks and farms;
It reached the merchant bending calmly o'er his blue-lined page,
With heart and hand the merchants band, the rightful strife to wage.
It stirred the stalwart artisan–Oh men of brain and sinewſ
Invader foes who come to blows, will find what metal's in you!—
The blacksmith left his forge awhile, the miller stopped his mill, , ,
In black and white their vestments dight they hied them to the Drill.
No stint the country gentlemen displayed of martial labours,
But blazed away from day to day at peril of their neighbours. .
The sportsman for his smooth-bored gun provided bullet cartridges,
Ready for red-legged buccaneers, as if for red-legged partridges.
Such rush there was for rifle-gear among those loyal men;
Such times had tailors never seen, and never may again;
And Beauty's brightest glances fell, in that eventful day,
To gallants of the belt and pouch all garmented in grey.
Through royal London warlike talk was heard on every hand,
Few young men will flirt at the risk of being “they say "d for it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FRANCE
AND CHINA.
HE Gazette de France an-
nounces that it has º:
a Chinese contributor. This
is a learned Chinaman living
in Paris, and he is to write
in that journal a weekly letter
relative to events which may
occur in his own country. In
his introductory communica-
tion he pays the following
compliment to France:–
“I came here because I had of-
ten heard said, that Paris is the
centre of European civilisation;
that it is the brain and the heart
from which all the thoughts and
pulsations which occupy and agi-
tate the people of Europe are
derived. France, in truth, ap
to me to be the China of the West.
I have already studied your man-
ners, usages, and laws, and I
assure you, dear elder, brother,
that I have taken ral pleasure in
comparing your civilisation with
Sº that of the Middle Empire. I have
tº scen that the French have a decided
* tendency to become Chinese in
many things.”
Our neighbours and allies must feel highly gratified at the resem:
blance which is discovered by the contributor to the Gazette de France
between them and his pig-eyed countrymen. We confess we cannot
see a very strong likeness; though it is impossible to, say that the
Napoleonic Empire will not become like the Celestial as it grows older,
according to that writer's prediction. Costume is the º point of
resemblance that we at present perceive, and in that respect the French
and Chinese fashions may to some extent agree in absurdity. It may be
a question whether pinched feet are more foolish or not, than pinched
waists, and if pigtails are more or less absurd than Crinoline.
MODERN ATHENS.
BY OUR Rowing CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH, 1 December, 1859.
“EDINBURGH, the capital of Scotland, occupies a picturesque
but somewhat inconvenient situation on a cluster of hills, about a mile
and a half from the Firth of Forth. It has long been celebrated as the
birth-place of the most eminent men of every, nation under the sun
and being justly considered the intellectual hotbed of Science an
Philosophy, when my talented friend, LANCELot PROPUs, embraced the
medical profession, he naturally selected this spot for the pursuit of
his studies; remarking in his usual facetious way, that if differences
of opinion did exist respecting the relative merits of a London or
Edinburgh diploma, the matter was, after all, only a question of degree.
“During the late electioneering excitement, PROBUs insisted on my
coming down here to matriculate at the University (which can be
done at a moderate charge), in order to qualify myself to vote for
a Lord Rector, to which I consented in the most disinterested manner
(not caring myself £0 0.2d, who holds, the office) –and had the
i. satisfaction of increasing one of the candidate's majority
one vote.
*.*. inhabits jolly little chambers in Ward Street, Hospital
Square. When you ring one of the nineteen brass bells which deco-
rate the street entrance, the door is, opened by some unseen and
mysterious agency. The visitor ascends a winding staircase, and finds
himself in a §tº little room, hung round with uncomfortable
anatomical diagrams. The skull of a hydro-cephalous subject grins from
the mantel-piece, and on a sideboard PROBUs keeps his case of instru-
ments, with various other insignia of his interesting but horrible
occupation. - - -
“Before visiting the other Lions of the town, PROBUs insisted on
dragging me through the Infirmary wards, showing, me all the mos
recent and dangerous cases, and took it quite unkindly that I declined
to see the celebrated PROFEsson McCARVER go through his experi-
ments on the ancle-joint. -
“The Population of Modern Athens consists chiefly of lawyers and
doctors, of whom the former gentlemen abound to an alarming extent.
They are divided into two classes, viz., “Advocates’ and “Writers to
the Signet” (Scotch for Attorneys), an º be seen in throngs fre-
quenting the ‘Parliament House,” which still proudly retains its name,
notwithstanding the melancholy event of 1707. The Great Hall in that
building is lighted up by a large window representing DAME JUSTICE
with her sword and balance. "What a satirical dog the artist must
have been who designed that window! The joke is as transparent as
the glass itself. Justice indeed! it is easy to see through that.
“Among the various useful institutions with which Modern Athens
abounds, there is one which is especially worthy of notice, as being of
incredible service to the learned professions and society at large—I
mean the Conjectural Club. It is composed of a number of praise-
worthy young gentlemen, who devote their leisure hours once a
fortnight to the investigation and discussion of subjects upon which
controversies have arisen or are likely to arise. It is established on
the principle of the celebrated Speculative Society, and, according to
PRobus, bids fair to rival that learned and ingenious body.
“A Programme of the “Transactions’ for 1860 accidentally fell into
my hands, and I subjoin a few examples from recollection, although I
cannot exactly vouch for the accuracy of all, having finished my fifth
glass of ‘toddy' before reading them over.

“All this, I say, is very romantic and interesting, but the poetic
“fallacy' has vanished when you pass back through the grim old
W. It is no longer the sixteenth, but the nineteenth century.
9dern Athens has forgotten old Dunedin.
“How are the traditional notions of my youth dissipated I remem-
ber the time when my conception of a Scotchman was based on that
type of humanity, which may be even now occasionally seen at the
doors of tobacconist's shops, stern as to feature, rigid as to his ex-
tremities, apparently always about to “take a pinch of snuff,” but from
motives of economy, never taking it.
“I expected to find every Scotch gentleman carrying about an
enormous ram's head mull, with the horns sticking out of his coat-tail
pockets. So far from that, if you will believe me, I was not offered so
much as a pinch of ‘Prince's Mixture,” during the whole time I was
in Edinburgh.
| “Don’t believe in bag-pipes any more. The only street-music which
I heard in Modern Athens, proceeded from a London grinding-organ,
played by an Italian boy, and that was an Irish air. It is a mistake to
suppose that the Edinburgh police wear kilts, or carry claymores.
| They do not even sport Balmoral boots, but the professional high-low.
| “The ladies are not universally attired in tartan, and some few speak
English as well as their native dialect. They have heard of other
dances besides the National Reel.
| “Putting the Stone' is not practised in all the public squares, and
the game of ‘golf' is irº in Prince's Street.
“I do not wish to boast of the fact, but I have whistled on a Sunday
without being apprehended by the police.
“Roast beef is occasionally substituted for the national dish at the
tables of the aristocracy; and I must say, on the whole, I do prefer it
to Haggis.
“Red hair is not, as many suppose, one of the qualifications indis-
pensable for the Editorship of the Scotsman.
“Having thus corrected a few erroneous notions which are liable to
arise in the minds of Young England respecting our “canny’ neigh-
bours, I have only to add, that there is a national produce north of the
Tweed, concerning the excellence of which there can be no mistake—
* I was thinking of asking the guide whether he found claret or cochineal the
best adapted for perpetuating the interest in this portion of the floºr; but Prost's
pointing to the heraldic representation of two unicorns starring at each other over
the motto, “Nemo me impune lacessit,” warned me of the danger of chaffing a
, Scotchman—oven in joke.

been said, it does as much for one as any advertised quack º: and has,

quite terrific."
ENTOMOLOGICAL NOTE.
Ticks are found in the test quantities
at the Universities, among the papers of fast
young undergraduates, where they often attain
the most extraordinary dimensions. They also
reach a large size in the barrack-rooms of crack
regiments, and especially in the lodgings occu-
pied by officers of the Household Brigade, one
of their favourite haunts is the ground on which
wild oats have been sown. This crop is never
reaped without ticks making their appearance.
Generally, it may be remarked of these trouble-
some pests, that they have a tendency to sprin
up wherever they are in the least º
and that, the rapidity of their growth is only
equalled by the difficulty of their eradication.
They breed in especial profusion in the offices
of Jew money-lenders, bill-discounters, and
generally where parchment is used in large
quantities.
The application of the sponge has been re-
commended as a remedy for ticks, but it is
generally found that when they have been super-
ficially removed by this process, it is only to
reappear in greater force than before. If allowed
to make head, they will speedily exhaust every
available source of support; and it may be said
of a swarm of ticks as of a flight of locusts, that
“before them is a smiling garden—behind them
a howling desert.”

You would, indeed— - - - - - - -
Could put him in a Civil List.
|NSANITARY INTELLIGENCE,
Absurd as it may seem, we begin really to think that the doctors
have some hand in the setting of the fashions,—they are so pointedly
conducive to illnesses and ailments. Here, for instance, is the latest
bit of ladies' news from Paris; and the reader will perceive how it
confirms us in our thinking:—
“In dresses generally there is little to record; they still bear either a number of
flounces, or none at all, d discretion. Bonnets, in spite of the cold, do not advance
towards the forehead, but tend to the contrary direction by their large descending
curtains.”
Looking at it merely as a Paterfamilias, we see nothing to object to
in the first half of this statement. For aught we care, our daughters
may wear no end of flounces, or none at all, as it best pleases them.
Be they flounced up to the eyes, or go altogether flounceless, they will
in neither case be less dear to our person, though they may be in the
latter cheaper to our pocket. . But, whatever be our damage, they
will not do themselves *ś and so we let them flounce themselves or
º; a discrétion, seeing that they have by this time reached the years
of it.
When, however, we are told that, in spite of the cold weather, it is
not fashionable for bonnets to cover up the head, but, on the contrary,
to be worn still further off it, here our feelings as a father prompt us
to interfere, and firmly to forbid our daughter to be fashionable.
She may be flounced a discrétion, as much or little as she likes; but
we will not see her bonneted d indiscrétion to please anybody. hile
the cold weather lasts, she shall wear a bonnet which j is a bonnet,
and shall wear it on her head, not off it; or we, as a “stern parient,”
will know the reason why. She shall not commit suicide for the sake
of being fashionable, whatever other maniacs there may be who will
do so. Ladies who go out this weather with their brains exposed, can
have but little brains, we fancy, to expose. We can only view them
as fashionable lunatics, and wish there were asylums erected to receive
them. Such persons are not fit to take care of themselves, and should
be placed under restraint, and so stopped from self-destruction, while,
however, they are suffered to remain at large. Perhaps the best form
of strait-waistcoat would be restraint in pin-money. Confinement of
the person º to some extent, at least, be effected through the
urse. Were husbands to allow their wives and daughters less for
ress, the latter would not pay so many visits to their milliners; and
when any suicidal fashion came in vogue, they could not afford to kill
themselves, even if they would.
JACK IN GAOL.
HERE is a pretty bit of a letter for a British sailor to be in aposition
to write! Excuse the style, and consider the statement:-
“I think visitors are allowed to see us about Christmas time, so perhaps you will
have a chance to see us but (minus of our hair and whiskers) we will write again if
I have any opportunity tell our Mothers we are quite happy tell them it is not so
bad as a man of war—"
The writer hails from Winchester Gaol:—
“tell them as if we did not care a fig for it dont tell them we shall have our hair
cut if you write immediately perhaps we shall get it, but dont be surprised if we
dont answere it please to drink our health on Christmas-day tell our friend we
cannot write."
Winchester Gaol is not so bad as a man-of-war, is the opinion of a
sailor confined in that prison, and is penned by him for the comfort of
a sympathising friend. The correctness of it is too apparent from the
risoner's case. He is one of the 108 A.B.'s of the Princess Royal,
incarcerated by the sentence of a court-martial which does not appear
to have been a court of inquiry. From the statement of a correspondent
of the Times, it appears that i. was a perfectly good fellow, and quite
innocent of moral participation in the mutiny wherein he had got
bodily involved. He had experienced four years' confinement in the
floating prison, and preferred the stationary one. What that confine-
ment must have been, may be inferred from the ºf. of his mess-
mates and fellow-prisoners to obtain a temporary liberation, and from
the mutiny which an old blockhead created by sending the poor fellows
back to their ship after allowing them just to touch the shore.
But what a remark from this honest, true-hearted, generous (for
roof of the justice of these epithets, see the Times) British Tar, to
orth to the world pending the present demand for hands to man the
British Navy | The remark has gone forth, my lords and gentlemen,
all the mischief is done; Punch did not publish it; he merely calls
attention to it, and begs to suggest one way to counteract its con-
sequences; that of letting the author of it, and at least his innocent
companions in trouble, out of quod.

“CRACKERS" FOR CHRISTMAS.
MANUFACTURED SOLELY FOR THE JUVENILEST PARTIES.
HE custom of bringing in the
Boar's Head at Christmas still
survives at many very hospit-
able houses, where the comfort
of the guests is seriously im:

the family has the slightest

Plum-pudding owes its origin
to an eccentric millionnaire,
who told his daughter if she
married he would give her no-
thing in the world but a plum-
pudding. Notwithstanding this
discouragement, the girl was
rash enough to marry; as
girls generally will, upon suffi-
cient provocation. Mindful of
her father's threat, she was
not, at all, surprised to find
that he refused to settle any fortune on her. But the imaginative
reader may fancy her º: when, at the wedding breakfast,
there was brought her a huge udding, which, on being cut, disclosed
her eccentric parent's cheque for a hundred thousand pounds, which
was very, nearly boiled to the rags, it had been made of. The old
millionnaire had strictly kept his word. He had only given his daughter
a “plum ” pudding.
Roast beef became a standing Christmas dish in the time of Bluff
KING HAI-called, in more politeness, by historians, HENRY THE
Eighth. This Monarch (vide portraits) used to eat prodigious dinners,
and of course kept a jester to act as a di-gester—the exercise of
laughing being good for the digestion. This jester's name was BEEFFE,
in the spelling of the period, but would doubtless now be written
simply Beef. The KING used daily to amuse himself with making fun
of this Courtjester or, to use his own expression, with “going in and
roasting him;” and as on Öhristmas Day the Monarch always dined
more heartily than usual, he used invariably, as soon as the cloth had
}. remºved, to cry out to his courtiers, “Now come and let’s roast

EUROPE this Christmas waits to see
What’s to be done with Italy:
Whether the despots mean to free her,
Qr somewhat further first to see her.
The Pope, too, waits, with visage grim,
To learn what’s to become of him; .
Whether the fools who’ve owned his sway
His Hol.1NEss will still obey;
Or whether, of his presence sick,
They’ll bluntly bid him cut his stick,
And tell him that, for change of air,
To England he had best repair;
Rome being to him less safe by far
Than three-pair backs in Leicester Squarr.
In France they wait to see war taxes
Laid . the people's backses;
For nobody can there gainsa
The fact, that “L’Empire, c'est la Pay.”
Germany waits, beer-cup in hand,
To hail her new-born Fatherland.
A realm, where sages, brain-bemuddled,
May at their ease sit, and get fuddled;
ardless what the world may think,
So long as they can have their drink.
The Czar of Russia waits to see
His nobles set their serfs more free:
A feat, wherein if he succeed,

To spit their venom at our QUEEN.
England meanwhile waits, all-prepared
From burglars her strong box to guard:
And while abroad War's tempest rages,
And with Morocco Spain engages,
She calmly waits, secure from storm,
The coming battle of Reform.
SPANISH LIMITATIONS.
A LETTER from Madrid, probably official, in the Patrie ‘...;
the demand for payment of a long-standing debt due from the Spanis
Government to that of Great Britain represents England as—
“Disinterring from her official archives these claims, and presenting them at a
moment when Spain is obliged to meet heavy expenses for the war in Africa.”
Very mean and shabby of England to make such a claim at such a
moment, isn’t it? How should we like, in case we were attacked by
France or Russia, or some other state, Holland, or Prussia, or Sweden
to take that opportunity to come down upon us with a demand for the
repayment of £440,000, due over twenty years? Not at all. But
suppose that we had just declared a fancy war against some other
Power, would not a nation to which we owed money naturally suppose
that we had waxed rich, take our indulgence in the luxury of warfare
as evidence of our prosperity, and think the time had at length come
to trouble us in the slightest possible degree to hand back that little
trifle? When a gentleman sets up a carriage, may not his unpaid and
suffering tailor consider, without incurring a merited imprecation, that
the day for sending his biſ in has now arrived? If we had owed Spain
,000, for between twenty and thirty years, on account of war-
material furnished to enable us to establish the British Constitution
by a dynastic º: and had now unnecessarily involved ourselves
in a conflict with a foreign enemy, and when Spain, on the strength of
that symptom of solvency, asked us for the money, if we resented the
emand, and pleaded against it the equivalent to an international

HYMEN'S GAS-LAMPS.

bridesmaid as a kind of gas-
lamp. Of course, we would
not for an instant be so
rude as to compare a lovel
woman to a lamp-post: º
to speak of girls as bein
attachable to posts, woul
be an insult not to them
alone, but to their future
husbands. But there are
many ornamental gas-lamps
without posts, and it is to
these that bridesmaidens
are , comparable. Their
bright eyes light the way
to the hymeneal altar, as
well as, if not better than,
a row of fish-tail burners
- - - - - - could. Like gas-lamps too
their light is such as never requires snuffing; and when turned onto the
full, its radiance is quite dazzling. Another point of likeness too may
be discovered in the fact that the light in Hymen's lamps is often
gimmed by tears, which may be regarded as water in the º No
Company has yet been formed for supplying, Hymen's gas, but this
is not much to be wondered at, for any one who wants it can always
get it for himself. As has been truly said—
“Only propose to blow a bubble,
An ... " What hundreds will subscribe for soap !"
So, only propose, and have a wedding, and dozens of young ladies will
volunteer to act as gas-lamps at it. They view the post of bridesmaid
as being a sort of sign-post which points to getting married; and when
they turn their gas on we have no doubt that they keep an eye to the
main chance.
OUR ANNUAL OBSTRUCTION.
AN alarming obstruction in Fleet Street was created on Thursday |P
morning last by the publication of Punch's Almanack, which took place
at 10 o'clock on that day. All the westward bound omnibuses were
obliged to diverge at Farringdon Street, and go ºp Holborn, in con-
sequence of the crowd which occupied the whºle of Fleet Street. A
denser mass of human beings was never perhaps jammed into any
space. The authorities must not be blamed for omitting to take un-
popular H. to prevent accidents, of which a great number
unavoidably occurred. Fortunately, no lives were lost, nor were any
bones broken; but several toes were trodden upon, which however,
as the concourse chiefly consisted of newspaper-boys of º: weight,
sustained no material damage. MASTER BöAKEs received a severe
dig in the ribs from the elbow of MASTER HUFFEY, who, in the excite.
ment of the competition, did not mind where he was showing. MASTER
RAGG's coat was torn down his back, and MASTER SToggs lost his
comforter. MASTER MULLINGs's hat was knocked over his eyes;
several other, young gentlemen were also bonneted; and MASTER
Bobson was deprived of his cap, which, it is to be feared, he will never
See again.
The promptest attention was rendered to the sufferers by our
attendants at the office, in supplying them, as fast as possible, with
numbers of the Almanack, at no charge beyond the ". ar fee of 3d.,
or 4d. stamped. A good deal of fighting took place among the
urchins, who were more awake to the attractions than alive to the
F. of Punch. On the whole, however, the greatest good-
umour prevailed, and the general harmony was heightened by nume-
rous whistles, snatches of nigger melodies, and other popular airs. A
large body of the City Police was in attendance, and laudably exerted
themselves to enforce order, as well as they could, allowance being
made for the convulsions of laughter occasioned by the illustrations of
the Almanack, which were thrust under their noses, and brandished in
opposition to their staves. Fleet Street remained impassable during
nearly the whole of the day, and all traffic was suspended, except what
was carried on in the interests of Punch. We are happy to state that
no serious injury occurred; though some of the purchasers of the
Almanack nearly burst themselves with laughing at its facetious
Contents.

THE DOOM OF THE POPE.
M. DE PUNCH presents his respectful compliments to the EMTERoR
Louis NAPOLEoN, and has much º in performing for his
Majesty's new pamphlet, issued by their friend M. DE LA GUERRON-
IERE, the same .."; process by which M. DE PUNCH so much
improved the EMPEROR's former, excellent publication, in which he
promised an Italian war. Cordially agreeing with the Emperor in his
conclusion that the Popº must be smashed up, if not exactly into a
cocked hat, into a sort of Beadle-General to the Roman Churches and
other show-places, M. DE PUNCH will not attack any of his Majesty's
premises, and hopes, by the way, that his Majesty will be equally
I.
Let us keep our tempers.
II.
The Pope must have some temporal
wer, or, with priestly instinct, will
serve him.
III.
But his rule must be paternal, and
therefore, the smaller his dominions the
greater his power. IV
He must not meddle with politics, but
confine himself to priestcraft and the
other fine arts. V
His army must be a mere symbol, and
he must really murder nobody; “blood-
shed in his name being an insult to
Heaven." VI

NAPLEs is hardly safe on his own throne.

Congress must settle the question. If
it does not choose to give Romagna to
the Pope, it may merely register a fait
accompli. But it must secure Rome to
him, and give him an Italian militia in-
stead of a foreign army. At present “he
cannot rely on the love and respect of
his people."
M. DE PUNCH would certainly say that Pope PERUGIA could not.
rish gentlemen, who have been de-
claiming in the Pope's praise, what they think of the EMPEROR's
account of the old gentleman, M. DE PUNCH begs most heartily to com-
pliment the EMPEROR upon the bold and logical form in which he has
ermitted their friend, M. DE LA GUERRONIERE to publish his Majesty's
ideas, which, upon the question of what should be done with the Pope
are precisely those of M. DE PUNCH and all liberal and enlightened
ersons. M. DE PUNCH scarcely expected so welcome a Christmas-box
rom the Tuileries.
CLERICAL ELOCUTION.
A REPORT of the ordination lately held by the Bishop or LoNDoN
states that—
“Full choral service was performed; the prayers being beautifully rendered by
the Rev. J. H. Coward, M.A., and the lessons read by the Rev. H. MILMAN, M.A.”
In what sense were the prayers, “beautifully rendered” by the
reverend gentleman? The word “render” has several meanings.
For one example, “to render” signifies to translate. This seems to
be the signification in which it is employed above. MR. CowARD is
said to have rendered the prayers just as MR. CHARLEs KEAN might
be described as having rendered, or interpreted, Hamlet or Macbeth.
We now come to inquire into the import of “beautifully” in the fore-
going connection. How were the prayers rendered in being rendered
beautifully? In a loud, clear, and audible voice P. We hope so. We
hope not with any sort of mouthing or moaning. In accounts of
... Marriage in High Life,” the service is often reported to have been
“impressively” performed. “Impressively” in those narratives is
|...}. nearly equivalent to “beautifully.” One of the graces of the
eautiful .# impressive utterance of reverend renderers and per-
formers of the Liturgy, consists in drawling for the sake of emphasis;
as, for instance, pronouncing the vowel O, in a word wherein it ought
to be short, ridiculously long. In venting these offensive sounds, they
appeal to the sympathies of the canting and illiterate, part of their
congregations, and make the same mistake as that which a vulgar
actor makes when he plays to the gallery.

“MR. PUNCH,
“I wish you would not make such a fuss as you do about
Christmas. I hate Christmas. In short, Christmas is a bore. º
and mistletoe have been worked to death. The former is all very well
in the hedges, and the latter may be an ornament to the tree on which
it grows; but neither, about the house is either useful or ornamental;
Who would commit the absurdity of kissing a girl under a bunch of
twigs before a number of spectators? The inevitable roast beef and
turkey of Christmas are tiresome. The plum-pudding is disgusting.
The *::: is an abomination. The pantomimes are idiotic and
imbecile. Christmas, in my mind, is simply associated with duns.
Qtherwise, it is one continual yawn. Now, old noodles attempt to
sing, and fogies make fools of themselves by ºf at blind-man's
buff—as you might say in your Almanack. ow children are en-
couraged to get upon your knees, and spoil your trousers. I am sick
of it all. I have no sympathies with my kind, if the people who
commit these annual follies are my kind: which I flatter myself the
are not. I abhor Pºlº sentiment about º and goodwill, and all
that sort of thing. I detest yule logs, to which scuttlefuls of coals are
vastly, preferable. I despise ghost stories: let us talk about death if
ou like, which is an end of everything, and I wish Christmas were dead,
ike the heart, to speak sentimentally, of your weary Correspondent,
“JAUNDERs LEGRAND.”
“P. S. Evergreens. Bosh! Fudge They are all the colour of
gamboge. Stick a sprig in a pudding—pshaw! What is a good thing
for indigestion?”
Pardonable at Christmas.
In the interest of the Field Lane Refuge, to which Mr. Punch begs
that everybody will send all the old clothes they can spare, he §:
a new ºff, of a misunderstood text. He would say, “Charity
covereth a multitude of skins.”
