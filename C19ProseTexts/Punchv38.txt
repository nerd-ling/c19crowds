'THE Grand Eeview was over. The Armed Freemen, who had been paraded, in their thousands, before the Queen
of the Isles, had dispersed, and had sought the homes they had shown themselves worthy to guard. The great
day, the memorable Saturday, Twenty-third of June, mdccclx, was done.
The Sovereign, who had surely felt that day that one Throne stood upon foundations of adamant, had retired to
her rest. And the Queen dreamed a dream.
"I know it, Pnipps," replied Me. Punch to Sir Chaeles, aa that courteous Courtier announced the fact in
Me. Punch'b breakfast chamber the following morning.
"Astounding man!" said Sib Chaeles Phipps.
"I breakfasted, and am dressed thus early, Pnipps, knowing that my Queen's Onibocbtticus and Conjectob
would be wanted."
"Preternatural man!" said Sia Chaeles Phipps. "Accompany me to the Palace."
"Attend me to the Palace, Phipps," said Mb. Punch, but with a pleasant smile, that spoke forgiveness of the
Courtier's lapse. But Sie Chaeles could not forgive himself, and the journey was performed in solemn silence.
The State Coach with the Cream Steeds stopped, and in three minutes Mb. Punch had made The Unapproach-
able Bow, which he performs in one Presence only.
"I have had a Dream, dear Mb. Punch," said the Royal Lips, with that smile upon them which is reserved for
the Chief Counsellor and Favourite of the Lady of Kingdoms.
"To save Tour Majesty the faintest care and slightest trouble is the object and glory of my life," said Mb. Punch.
"Might I venture to recal that Dream?"
"I think you know everything," replied the Majesty of England.
"I believe that I do, Madam," responded Mb. Punch, modestly. "And I know what has come to my Sovereign
through the Gate of Ebony."
"Ah! it is a true Dream, then?" asked the Queen.
"Tour Majesty's self shall judge," replied the Onieocbiticus and Conjectob. "It is not for me to question
my Monarch; but, unless contradicted, I will believe that Her Dream was in this wise."
"Tell me," said his Eoyal Mistress.

PREFACE. rjt7NE 30- l86«-
"A Daughter of the House of Brunswick stood on a Mountain, and could see not only the English Isles of her
inheritance, and her strongholds in the Southern Lake, which is not. a French Lake, yet, if it please Tour Majesty—
The Boyal Eye sparkled.
"But all her distant dominions. She saw a broad, happy, loyal American colony, which was preparing all honour
and welcome for her Eldest Son. She saw the gigantic Asian Peninsula, recently subdued by her armies, and now her
Own in name as well as in fact, and a veteran hero was leaving its shore to receive the laurel at home."
"Yes, I did see Loed Clyde," said the Boyal Auditor.
"She saw her vast possessions in the Austral world, with their rapidly growing peoples, resolved, energetic,
prosperous, and, while bent on making their new world what a freeman's home should be, retaining a deep love for the
home whence they came."
"The Prince of "Wales must visit Australia next," said his Boyal Mother.
"And, Madam, She saw the rest of her Fifty Colonies, and her flag waving over each, and the Englishman every-
where performing his mission of civilisation, order, and law. And then She saw, sailing statelily on every sea, her
majestic Fleets. And She beheld, parading haughtily on the plains around her, and in many a far-away land, her gallant
Soldiery. And closer yet, and at her very feet, She saw the Household Guard of England—the Guard that stood before
her yesterday, and gave her the proud and stern assurance that the manhood of Britain is ready to close with any
foe whom the Devil may stir up to do his work."
"That—yes—that was the Dream," said the Lady of the Land.
"But there was one Thought more," said Me. Punch, in a lower voice, and with an inexpressibly arch, yet
profoundly respectful smile stealing over his intellectual features.
""Was there?" asked his Sovereign, with a frank look of inquiry. ""Well, now you mention it—yes."
"Dare I complete my story?" said Mb. Punch. "It was not precisely that something was wanting to the
perfect satisfaction and happiness of my Quebn—let me rather say that She had a hovering impression that it was
possible for some additional gem and glory to be added to the period—that some Koh-i-Noor, or other Mountain of
Light might be laid at her feet."
"I will not deny it," said Heb Majestt, smiling; "but I cannot recollect what form the new pleasure was to take."
"Deign, Gracious Mistress, to look upon this Mirror," said the Magician. And, stepping to its side, and waving
gracefully his baton, after the manner of Coenelius A geippa before his famous Glass of the Future,
"Mormor6 potentisaime parole.
Gird tre volte all' Orieute il volto,
Tre volte ai regni ove dechina il Sole.
"Onde tanto indugiar? Forse attendete
Voci ancor piu potenti"
But the words had power enough. Medea could not have chanted more awfully to the palpitating stars. The curtains
glided aside, and the Mystery was revealed, the Dream solved, the new Gem and Glory of the Period disclosed.
In another moment, bending at his Gracious Sovereign's knee, Me. Punch presented his

POLITICAL
/"\N the 24th of January Her Majesty opened Parliament
^ in person, and the following paragraphs from the Queen's
speech adequately (Mirabile dictu f) express the political
aspect of affairs :—
"At the close of tho lost Session I informed you that overtures had been
mode to me to ascertain whether, if a Conference should be held by the
Great Powers of Europe, for the purposo of settling arrangements connected
with tho present state and future condition of Italy, a Plenipotentiary would
be sent by mo to assist at such n Conference. I have since received a formal
invitation from the Emperor or Acstria and from the Emperor of the
French to send a Plenipotentiary to a Congress to consist of the represen-
tatives of the eight Powers who were parties to the Treaties of Yienna of
1815, the objects of such Congress being stated to be to receive communica-
tion of the treaties concluded at Zurich; and to deliberate, associating wish
the above-mentioned Powers tho Courts of ltomo, of Sardinia, and of the Two
Sicilies, on tho meanB best adapted for the pacification of Italy, and for
placing its prosperity on a solid and durable basis.
"Desirous at all times to concur in proceedings having for their object the
maintenance of peace, I accepted the invitation, but at the same time I made
known that, in such a Congress, 1 should steadfastly maintain the principle,
that no external forco should be employed to impose upon the people of Italy
any particular Government or constitution.
'' Circumstances have arisen which have led to a postponement of the
Congress, without any day having been fixed for its meeting ; but whether
in Congress or by separate negotiation, I shall endeavour to obtain for the
people of Italy freedom from foreign interference by force of arms in their
internal concerns; and I trust that tho affairs of tho Italian peninsula may
be peacefully and satisfactorily settled.
"I am in communication with the Emperor or the French with a view
to extend tho commercial intercourse between the two countries, and thus
to draw still closer the bonds of friendly alliance between them.
"A dispute having arisen between Spain and Morocco, I endeavoured, by
friendly means, to prevent a rupture ; but, I regret to say, without success.
"My Plenipotentiary and tho Plenipotentiary of the Emperor of the
French having, in obedience to their instructions, proceeded to tho mouth
of the Pelbo river, in order to repair to Pekln to exchange in that city tho
ratifications of the treaty of Tien-tain, in pursuance of the LVIth Article
of that treaty, their further progress was opposed by force, and a conflict
took place between the Chinese forts at the mouth of the river aud the naval
forces by which the Plenipotentiaries wero escorted.
"The allied forces displayed on this occasion their usual bravery, but,
after sustaining a severe lis*, were compelled to rctiro.
SUMMARY.
"I am preparing, in concert and co-operation with tho Emperor or the
French, an expedition, intended to obtain redress and a fulfilment of the
stipulations of the Treaty of Tien-tain.
"An unauthorised proceeding by an officer of the United States, in regard
to the Island of San Juan, between Vancouver's Island and the mainland,
might have led to a serious collision between my forces and those of the
United States. Such collision, however, has beou prevented by the judicious
forbearance of my naval and civil officers on tho spot, and by the equitable
and conciliatory provisional arrangement proposed on this matter by the
Government of tho United States.
"I trust that the question of boundary out of which this affair has arisen
may bo amicably settled in a manner conformable with the just rights of
the two countries, as defined by the first aiticle of the Treaty of 1846.
"The last embers of disturbance in my East Indian dominions have been
extinguished; my Viceroy has made a peaceful progress through the dis-
tricts which bad been the principal scene of disorder, and, by a judicious
combination of firmness and generosity, my authority has been everywhere
solidly, and, I trust, permanently established. I have received from my
Viceroy the most gratifying accounts of the loyalty of my Indian subjects,
and of tho good feeling evinced by the native chiefs and tho groat laud-
owners of the country. The attention of the Government in India has been
directed to the development of the Internal resources of the country; and I
am glad to inform you that an improvement has taken place in its financial
prospects.
"I have concluded a treaty with the Tycoon of Japan, and a treaty
regarding boundaries with the republic of Guatemala. 1 have directed that
these treaties shall be laid before you.
"I have directed the estimates for the ensuing year to be laid before you.
They have been prepared with a view to place the military and naval services,
and tho defences of the country, upon an efficient footing.
"I am glad to be able to inform you that the public revenue is in a satis-
factory condition.
"I have accepted, with gratification and pride, the extensive offers of
Voluntary service which I have received from my subjects. This manifes-
tation of public spirit has added an important element to our system of
national defence.
1' Measures will be laid before you for amending the laws which regulate
the representation of tho people in Parliament, and for placing that repre-
sentation upon a broader and firmer basis.
"I am deeply gratified to observe that the great Interests of the country
are generally in a sound and thriving condition; that pauperism and crime
have diminished ; and that, throughout the whole of my empire, both in the
United Kingdom and in my colonies and possessions beyond eoa, there reigns
a ppirit of loyalty, of contentment, of order, and of obe lience to the lftw."

[Januabt to Junk, 1860.
INTRODUCTION.
The whole Speech will be found admirably paraphrased ia
the Essence of Parliament, which, as usual, contains all the
events of the Session really worthy of being recorded.
As the progress of the Constitutional cause in Italy was re-
garded with the warmest sympathy by all classes in England,
much of the present volume has reference to that interesting
struggle, and a brief summary of events will explain many of
the illustrations, and the artioles associated with them in the
present and succeeding volumes. We shall quote somewhat
freely from the Annual Register of 1860.
By the Treaty of Villafranca, whioh was signed at Zurioh
en the 11th of November, 1859, it was agreed between France
and Austria that an endeavour should be made to assemble a
Congress of the European Powers, to take into consideration
the question of the pacification of Italy. The Congress, how-
ever, never met; for it was found impossible to arrange a
common basis of action on account of the disoordance of the
views entertained with respect to the question of the Duchies
of Parma and Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tusoany.
France was pledged to Austria to do all in her power to effeot
the restoration of the Dukes and Grand Duke; but England
was opposed to any interference, and wished the inhabitants
of those kingdoms to settle their own respective Governments
free from the compulsion of external pressure. The conse-
quenoe was, that a great deal of diplomatio correspondence
took place during the latter part of last year without leading
to any result. We have, in our preceding volume, quoted the
remarkable letter of the French Empebob to the Pope, dated
the 31st December, 1859, in whioh he oalled upon the Holy
Father to renounce the Legations, which for the last fifty
years had caused so much embarrassment to his Government,
and in exchange to demand from the Powers that they should
guarantee him possession of the remainder of his dominions.
This added a new element of difficulty, for the Pope was
inexorable in his refusal to abandon any part of the dominions
of the Church; and they were ultimately torn from him by
what, on another occasion, the Empehob called "the inex-
orable logic of facts,'' or, in other words, the irresistible force
of war.
The conduct of the people of Italy was well expressed in a
despatch written by Lobi) John Russell to Lord A. Loftus,
our Minister at Vienna. "In 1848 the people of Europe,
misled by wild enthusiasts, attempted to found stable govern-
ments on republican theories; but at the present time the
people of Italy, in harmony with public opinion throughout
Europe, seek for order as well us liberty beneath the dome of
monarohy, supported by national oonsent and equal laws."
The people indulged in no visionary dream of a republio,
neither were they led into the commission of any exoesses, with
one melancholy exception—the murder of Count Anviti, at
Parma.
The Congress did not assemble, and various plans were
submitted by England and France, but the Pope's temporalities
were ever in the way of an adjustment. At length Count
Cavour addressed a note (in reply to various propositions) to
Cjievalieu Niqra, the Sardinian Minister in Paris, in which
he said,—
"Whatever may be the reply returned by the States of Central Italy, the
Kino's Government at once declares that it will accept it unconditionally.
If Tuscany declares for the preservation of her self-government by meaus of
the formation of a State distinct from Sardinia, not only will it not oppose
tbo realisation of this wish, but it will frankly aid in overcoming the
obstucles which such a solution might encounter, and obviating tho incon-
venience whioh may follow from it. It will act in like manner with respect
to the Romogna aud to the Duchies of Parma and Modena. But if. on tho
contrary, theso provinces again manifest in a clear manner a wish to bo
united to Piedmont, we cannot any longer oppose it. Indeed, did we wish
to do so, we could not. In the present state of public opinion, a Ministry
who should refuse a second demand for annexation, sanctioned by a second
popular vote on tho part of Tuscany, would not only no longer find support
in Parliament, but would soon bo overthrown by an unanimous vote ot
The Provisional Governments of Tuscany and Emilia
(which comprises the Duchies of Parma and Modena and the
Legations) issued decrees at the end of February, announcing
that the people would be called upon, on the 11th and 12th of
March, to vote by ballot and universal suffrage on the question
of annexation to Sardinia or a separate kingdom. The vote
was then taken, and decided by an immense majority in
favour of annexation.
The result of this appeal to universal suffrage, on the part
of iEmilia, was presented by Signor Fabini, the Provisional
Governor, to Victor-Emmanuel at Turin, on the 18th of
March, and on the part of Tuscany, by Baron Hicasoli (who
had succeeded Chevalier Buoncampagni as Provisional
Governor) on the 22nd. On receiving the homage of iEmilia
the King said:—
"In uniting to my ancient provinces not only the States of Modena and
Parma, but also tho Romagna, which has already separated itself from the
Papal Government, 1 do not intend to fail in my deep devotion to the Chief
of the Church. 1 am ready to defend the independence necessary to tho
supreme minister of religion, the Popk, to contribute to the splendour of his
Court, and to pay homage to his Sovereignty."
A bill was afterwards brought into the Sardinian Chambers
to authorise the annexation, and passed into a law.
Another actor was now to appear on the scene of Italian
politics, Francis the Second had succeeded his father,
Ferdinand the Second, on the throne of the Two Sicilies;
and he followed his father's footsteps in doing all in his power
to alienate the hearts of his people and crush every aspiration
of liberty.
At the beginning of April an insurrection broke out in
Sicily at Palermo, where the Royal troops were attacked, and
the city was placed in a state of siege. The rexolt spread
rapidly over the island, and Messina, Catania, and Agrigeutum
declared against the Government. Guerilla bands traversed
the interior, and the movements of the insurgents were
directed by a secret revolutionary committee, the names and
locality of which were unknown to the Royalists. But in the
meantime Gabibaldi was collecting volunteers to take part
in the insurrection. He all but openly organised an expedi-
tion to Sicily in the dominions of Sardinia, and at length, on
the night of the 5th of May, sailed from Genoa with a body of
about 2000 men.
On their voyage Garibaldi issued the following pro-
clamation :—
11 Italians!—The Sicilians are fighting against the enemies of Italy aud for
Italy. To help them with money, arms, and especially men, is the duty of
every Italian.
"Let the Marches, Umbrio, Sabine, the Roman Campagna, and the Nea-
politan territory rise, so as to divide the enemy's forces.
11 If the cities do not offer a sufficient basis for insurrection, let tho more
resolute throw themselves into the open couutry.
"\ brave man can always find a weapon. In tho name of Heaven,
hearken uoC to the voice of those who cram themselves at well-served tables.
"Let us arm. Let us fight for our brothers; to-morrow wo can fight for
ourselves.
"A handful of bravo men, who have followed me In battles for our country,
are advancing with me to the rescue. Italy knows them; they always
appear at the hour of danger. Brave and generous companions, tbey have
devoted their Uvea to their country; they wul shed their last drop of blood
for it, seeking no other reward than that of a pure conscience.
"'Italy and Victor-Ksoc anubi. 1'—that was our battle-cry when we
crossed the Ticlno ; it will resound into the very depths of .dEtuo.
•' As this prophetic battle-cry re-echoes from the hills of Italy to tho Tar-
peian Mount, tho tottering throne of tyranny will fall to pieces, aud the
whole country will riot* lik* one man."

rioe
The Sardinian government affected to disavow this hostile
expedition, but when the end it sought was obtained, Victor -
Emmanuel said, in an address to the people of Southern Italy,
"It was quite natural that tho evonta which had taken place in Central
Italy should havo moro or less excited the minds of the people of South
Italy. In Bicily this disposition of the people found vent iu open revolt.
The people were fighting for liberty in Sicily, when a brave warrior, devoted
to Italy and me—General Garibaldi—sprang to their assistance. They
were Italians, / could not, I ought not to ratrain them"
I Gaeibaldi effected a landing at Marsala on the 10th of
May with four pieces of artillery, and soon joined the insur-
gents, when ho assumed the title of Dictator of Sicily in
the name of Victou-Emmanckl and Italy. The next day
Gaeibaldi defeated 3,000 Neapolitan troops under General
Landi, and occupied Calata Fimi, driving tho enemy from
all their positions. He then advanced towards Palermo, and
at daybreak on the 27th May (Whit Sunday) Garibaldi
attacked the city and drove the Neapolitans out of the streets
into the citadel, from which they kept up a heavy bombardment
aided by the Royalist Fleet in the harbour. At last an ar-
mistice was proposed by Lanza, the Neapolitan oommander,
and subsequently the Royalist troops evacuated Palermo, with
the exception of Fort Castellamare. Garibaldi now formed
a ministry, and remained some time at Palermo, occupied in
the formation of the new Government. On the 20th of June
he defeated the Neapolitans at Melazzo, after a severe contest,
in whioh he was personally engaged, narrowly escaping
death.
The Kino of the Two Sicilies now endeavoured, in vain,
to appease the discontent of his subjeots by concessions, but
Garibaldi issued a proclamation from Messina on the 6th of
August, to the people of the Neapolitan mainland, calling
upon them to unite with him "to constitute Italy without
slaugher of her sons, and together to serve her and die for
her." Shortly after he landed at Reggio, obtained possession
of the fort which the garrison had evacuated, leaving behind
them a considerable number of cannon and 500 stand of arms.
He then surrounded the Royalists at San Giovanni; and so
confident was he that the enemy would surrender, that he
generously forbade his troops to fire; and in a short time a
flag of truce came over from the Royalists. After a brief
hesitation, shouts arose among them of "Vicn Garibaldi!
Viva V Italia!" and Garibaldi went down amongst them,
when he was almost torn to pieces by "hugging and em-
bracing." The Neapolitan soldiers, about 2000, were permitted
to depart to their homes.

street-cry.
179 The New Rogue's March was composed on the occasion
of the discovery of the Pullinqer robbery of the Union Bank,
and several other extensive commercial frauds.
188 The Swans of Thames wero permitted to remain.
195 "Heavy Exchanges, and Both Down."—The Members
of the London and Liverpool Exchanges subscribed a consi-
derable sum of money for Tom Sayers, the pugilist. Other
subscriptions were added and invested for the Champion's
benefit, on the condition that he never fought again in the
prize-ring.
208 Just in Time.—Mr. James Wilson having been ap-
pointed financial member of the Legislative Council of India,
had gone to that country, and, after an interval employed in
making himself master of the complicated subject of Indian
Finance, had matured a plan of retrenchment and taxation
by which he hoped to produce the result so greatly needed in
the present position of affairs, an equalisation of income and
expenditure. Mr. Wilson developed his soheme for this
purpose in an elaborate speech, which he delivered in the
Council at Calcutta, and which was generally received with
approval, both there and in this country. Unfortunately, the
recently-appointed Governor of Madras, Sir Charles Tre-
vkltan, took an opposite view, regarding Mr. Wilson's
projects of taxation as likely to be very injurious, if not
impracticable, in India; and he made his hostility known,
and encouraged opposition to the measures of Government,
in a manner calculated, in the existing state of the native
mind, to create great difficulties and seriously to impede the
success of the projected financial Reform. In this critical
state of things the Government at home was compelled to take
decisive steps in order to counteract the danger; and with
creditable promptitude, they issued orders for the immediate
recall of Sir C. Trevelyan—a step in whioh they carried

January ia bo called from Janus, ton
of Apollo. He had two facea, like those
who keep up festivities during this month,
and who look rcmakably different the
night of the fun, und the morning after.
He appears with a k> y in hia right hand
and a rod in hia left, hence, about the 25th,
Mammaa lock up the jam •cupboard and
despatch the ravagcra thereof to the Uev.
Dr. Swishtail's. Sometimes he has a
beard, aotnetimes he has not, tind the Fame
thing may be observed concerning the Jovial
Janites, whose hands are not always steady
enough to use the razor. If a certain king
of England had not tried so hard to imitate
the two-faced Janus, he might not have
been towards the end of the month, without
any face at all.

are numerous instances of her fraternity
having been devoted in a contrary direction
by Paterfamilias, when he Is atified with the

prised that hia choice lies between eo'd

impeding the working of such con-

Urania, who presides

children arc afflicted in
Lent, and the other
Popularia, w ho sends
them, happy, to Bee the
Euster-picce*. No pip*
were offered to Venus
(though Lord Bacon
died in April), and no
greedy man is ever liked
by the ladies. She is
represented with a
poppy, and the Exeter
Hall speeches begin this
month. She was called
Tclessigama, because
she presided over mar-
riage, and people had
better be married (if
they can afford it) in
this month, because
there is a proverb
against marrying in
May, and if tbry care

Mat is so called from Mala. She was %
daughter of Atlas, and sensible people who
take down their maps, and arrange their
summer tour, instead of waiting on the
fashions. She was the mother of Mercurv,
and that accounts for the quicksilver tn
tliH thermometers dancing so much with
joy to see her. She had six sisters, and she
and all the rest, except one, made crack
matches, but j u r Merope was obliged to
put up with a mortal. Her.ce, when they
were all made Pleiades, Merope's star had
only one burner and no reflector, while her
listers all shine out like Mr. Wat's mar*

this when flirting at Exeter 11*11 or Epsom.

It being considered vulgar now-a-days to
eat much, of course you need not go to
ureal expense about refreshments. A light
repast is all that it is fashionable to give—
i. e„ lots of gas, and little lobster salad.
With regard to wine, you can give your

ir you do not mind giving such as will be

CLASSICALITY FOR THE MONTH.
Ji'vi is so called from Juno. She was the
daughter of Ops, whence so many dances
are now given. Some say she was taken
care of by the Seasons, and this is certainly
the pet month of the season still. She bated
Hercules, whence ladies detest the Club that
prevents their husbands taking tbem to
Richmond or Greenwich this lovely weather,
though the wretches can go fast enough by
themselves, the pigs. The peacock was
sacred to Juno, and if ever people look smart
it ia now. Juno having the privilege of
using Jupiter's thunderbolts, the occasional
storms of the month are accounted for; but
upon one occasion she did a bolt on her own
account, which brought buMneae before the
Olympian Cress well. She was quite in
the right, and had to submit—as will always
happen while gods and men make laws.

CLA8SICALITT FOR
THE MONTH.
Sutxmijer is 00 called
from its having been the
seventh month. The two
new mootbs, January snd
February, were inserted by
Kama (please to remember
the Grotto), who in imitation
of the Greeks divided the
year into twelve parts. On
the 13tb the consul or dicta-
tor used to knock a nail in
the temple of Jupiter, wbich
was about as sensible a cus-
tom at is the counting of
hobnails in our own time.
Considering the fearful ex-
travagance of the priests, it
would have been better had
the chief magistrate turned
a screw. On the last day of
the month there was a fes-
tival in honour of Meditrina,
the goddess of curing, when
the Romans tapped new
wine, probably because it
tnsted like physic. Zudi
Jlafftii* or great games, were
carried on this m*mth, but
in our time it is devoted to
great game-bags being car-
ried off.

PRACTICAL WISDOM.
Whknkv>r you see ex-
posed for sale any article
that strikes your fancy, buy
it If you can ufford it, whe-
ther you want it or not. If
you wait till you actually
want a certain thing, you

READING CHARACTERS DC WRITING.
There are persons who profess to judge
of character by huad writing, and to judge
from their advertisements, there is very
little doubt that their profession pays them.
Tet their judgments, after all, are mere
matters of guesswork. They bate them,
as the gipfiis do, on the mere pretence of
simply looking at the hand. Now, writing
a good hand by no means generally implie*
the having a good head. Still leas is it
indicative of having a good heart. A man
may be remarkable for the superfinest qua-
lities, and yet may write the coarsest and
most commonplace of hands. He may have
the ele****' bruin, and yet may sign his
name so r.bzslingiy that nobody can read it.

ALL THE WORLD'S TWELFTH-NIGHT.
WEARIED with receiving the incessant and overwhelming congra-
* * t ulations of the Universe upon his opening the Thirty-Eighth of
the Immortal Tomes, Mr. Punch commanded that neither visitors nor
letters should be brought up to him for the space of one hour. And
reclining in his delightful arm-chair, the gift of his gracious Sovereign
on his last birthday. Mr. Punch slept. It was the Eve of St.
Twelfchcake.
And a Dream came unto him.
He thought that all the Great Ones of the World held Twelfth-
night.
And out of a vast Helmet, like that which in Horace Walpole's
story came down into the court-yard of Manfred of Otranto, they were
drawing Twelfthnight characters.
By some Mesmeric agency, Punch, though keeping his own majestic
distance from the folk engaged in the revel, was able to read the
painted scrolls which were drawn from the helmet.
And these were some of the characters drawn by the Great Ones of
the World:
The Silent Man or the Tuileries drew Alexander the Great;
motto, " The world's mine oyster, which I with sword will open."
The Emperor op Austria drew Bottom; motto, "I pray you
remember to have me set down an Ass."
The Emperor op Russia drew " Old Brown " the Liberator; motto,
"The serfs are glad through Lara's wide domain."
His Holiness the Pope drew JSolus; motto, "You untie the winds,
and let them fight against the Churches."
His Holiness the Sultan drew Saint Peter; motto, "I am a better
Christian than thou." Which he showed to the preceding drawer.
President Buchanan drew Janus; motto, " Black's not so black,
nor white so very white."
Lord Palmerston drew Warwick the Kingmaker; motto, "Mighty
Pam, that kings and queens o'erthrow."
The Ex-Grand Duke Leopold drew Honest logo; motto, "Exit
tyrannut, regum ultimus."
Count Cavour drew Arnold of Brescia; motto. "Thou canst not,
Cardinal, devise a name so slight, unworthy, ana ridiculous as the
Pope."
Lord John Russell drew Jack the Giant-Killer; motto, "Though
she be but little, she is fierce."
Princess Frederick William drew Queen Victoria; motto, "I
never saw you look so like your mother."
The Kino op Sardinia drew Bernadotte; motto, "'Tis better using
France than trusting France."
Mr. Macready drew Coriolanus; motto, "A fool, a fool, I met a
fool i' that Forrest."
The Queen of Spain drew lucretia (Borgia); motto, "Most
women have no characters at all."
Lord Brougham drew Mr. Punch; motto, "When you take her
without her answer, you shall take her without her tongue."
But here the crowd of Mr. Punch's admirers, eager to go on con-
gratulating him became so dense and noisy, that a humble supplication
from the police that he would be pleased to remove the obstruction by
letting the multitude enter, scattered his dream of the World's
Twelfthnight.

JUVENILE RIFLE CORPS.
"Ma. Punch, "Acacia Route Academy, January, 1860.
"Please, Sir, it says in the paper that there is i> talk of
military training in public schools. That means College boys only;
but I wish you would try to get all of us to have to be taught to be
soldiers, and especially shooting with the rifle, which would be jolly
fun. There is nothing like beginning when a fellow is young; and old
Slater would be so precious mad. If he smells the least gunpowder,
he gets into such a rage; and just let him find a chap out letting off a
squib or a cracker,—wouldn't a fellow just catch it, that's all!
Shouldn't I like him to see me biting off the end of a cartridge, in
which I would make mouths at him, as if I couldn't help it. Bifles is
a game I would ever so much sooner play than prisoner's base, or foot-
ball, or even cricket; and I'd a good deal rather have a lot of bullets
than so many marbles, even if they were all alleys. Do, Mr Punch, try
and make old Slater forced to have us all drilled and brought up to
be Riflemen, to fight for our parents and friends. The College boys
would be only a few, but we should be ever so many. I shall now
conclude, hoping, next half, that, instead of nothing but lessons and
sums, our preceptor will enjoy the pleasing task of teaching the young
idea how to shoot; and I remain, dear Mr. Punch, home for the
holidays,
*' Your young Friend,
"Briggs, Junior."
"P.S. I've just thought of some copies that could be set for boys
that were being drilled and brought up to be Volunteers. For instance,
Avoid Quakers; Advance Artillery: Britons Shoot Home; Charge
Bayonets; Cavalry are Wanted; Drill is a Duty; Keep Close Order;
Bespect Riflemen; Shoulder Arms; Watch your Enemies, &c. AVhat

Too Good by Half.
A Reporter on one of our leading journals, and well-known amongst
his comrades for his love of the dolce far niente, which he has carried
to the most delightful height of fainiantisme, was asked why he didn't
I join a Rifle Corps; when he replied, in a lone of the most profound
'conviction, that evidently released him in his own mind from all future
liability, "No, no, my dear fellow, one Volunteer is worth two Press
men, any day."
STAGE LAWYERS. j
Reader, constant or inconstant reader, have you ever noticed how
the lawyers are maligned and maltreated by the dramatists. As a rule,
one never sees a honest lawyer on the stage. Indeed, the part would
he so novel that an actor would require to be paid extra for performing
it. We should as soon expect a dramatist to write a part for a Gorilla
as introduce so strange an animal as a honest lawyer. No. A lawyer
on the stage is invariably a bad one. In Comedy he is the evil genius
1 of the piece, and though he triumphs for an act or two, before the
I curtain falls he always gets the worst of it. In Melodrama he is, if
;not the villain of the piece, at least the villain's bosom friend and |
| il legal adviser. In a Nautical drama he is always found consorting
with the smugglers and the pirates. The Jack Tars call him "land-
shark," and threaten to harpoon him or to "darken his skylights."
They nickname him a "lubber," and bid him "sheer off, or they '11
scuttle him." They shiver their timbers when he heaves in sight, and
swear they '11 make lobscouse of him if he comes athwart their hawse.
In Farce, too, you may be sure, a lawyer's never introduced excepting
to be laughed at. His make up is always the signal for a roar. His
Iran lanthorn-jaws are as yellow as old parchment, and he dresses in a
seedy shiny swallow-tailed black coat, buttoned tight across his chest
to make him look like a starved scarecrow. His spindleshanks of legs
are made to look still thinner by being cased in tights; and his hands
are enveloped in a mass of woollen fabric, which appears to be supposed
to do duty for gloves.
Then, the treatment he receives is of as bad a fashion nearly as his
dress. He rarely comes upon the stage excepting to be kicked off it.
Like the dog upon the racecourse, everybody hoots at him. In fact,
the part which lawyers have to play upon the stage, is to get the kicks
and cuffs but not the six-and-eightpences. Like Pantaloons in panto-
mimes, they get knocked about and jeered at, and are continually
touched up with the red end of the hot poker.

Wanted-A Ruin.
Among the principal functions assigned to the citizens of Rome by
M. de la Guerronniere (alias Louis Napoleon) in his new
pamphlet, "Le Pape et le Congris" is the "keeping up of ruins"
(cuite det ruines).
It is, no doubt, to have another and important subject-matter for
this duty, that the Irish priests are trying to ruin the National System
of Education.
Wnr is the Western Central Postal District larger than any of the
others ?—Because it is W.C. (double, you ace).

THE POPE AND THE PIG.
As when, mid cots of rustic swains,
With piercing and discordant cry,
Resound the distant hills and plains
To shrill inhabitant of stye;
The hearer of the dismal squeal
Of pain, resentment, wrath self-willed,
A touch of sympathy will feel,
And say, That pig is being killed."
But should he haply bend his course,
Impelled by an inquiring mind.
To Irac* that clamour to its source.
Small reason for great noise he '11 find,
For grains perchance a mere demand,
Or swill withheld by lazy clown;
Cr else the pig is urged to stand
When fully bent on lying down.
So. when with persecution's roar.
The Irish priests our ears assail,
And raise upon llibernia's shore,
A yell that loads the Western gale;
We think the chief for whom ihey howl,
To awful grief must sure have come,
Suppose, at hands of heathen foul,
The Pope is suffering martyrdom.
And so, when we the cause inquire
Of all the row those Papists make,
As though t heir venerated Sire
Alive were roasting at the stake.
The motive of their uproar all

The Papists' grievance thus is small,
And, like the pigs', their cry is great.
MUSIC AND MYSTERY.
Persons who like puzzles might often find amusement in the musical
advertisement*, which are nut forth in some of the weekly prints.
Hew is line, lor instance, which contains so hard a uut that even fiotet
and Querist would find it difficult to crack :—
TOWER'S ROYAL PAVILION, SHAFTESBURY, DORSET. —
J-J WANTED, Three Musicians t«> join immediately, double-handed would bo
prefci red. For p irticulars, a c, address us above.
Dors the advertiser mean to say, that musicians with two hands are
so seldom to be met, with, that he thus avows his preference for those
who arc so gified? If it. be true that as a rule musicians have one
hand more commonly than two, the College of Surgeons should be
acquainted with the fact, and should set, their wits to work in some
way to account, fur it. As far as our experience and memory will carry
us, we cannot call to mind that we have ever seen a one-handed musi-
cian, and this makes us the more curious to hear, if we can do so,
some statistics on the subject.

ever moderate the salary might be, one would fancy that the advertiser
would wish to get as good a player as he could for it; and might just
as well have tried to get an able-legged performer, supposing one were
not more, expensive than a lame one. If we wished to please the public
we should certainly not choose a lame performer for so doing; for
however good a hand he might be with his lingers, he never could

LATE AND EARLY SWEDES.
TjnjoiNED is an interesting
piece of foreign parlia-
mentary intelligence which
appeared the other day in
the culumns of a contem-
porary, under the head of
Sweden:—
"Baron Creutz proposed
that from the age of fifteen
young girls should lie allowed to
answer of their own aceord yes
or no to any suitor for their
hand. M Montgomery opposed
f'e ) roject. declaring that, at
the age of fifteen, love though
strong was too blind, and ti.at
the age of twenty-five was
iudiB|ieni>ablo to lie ablo to
see clearly in so important ft
que.stiou.H
Swedes come on early, if
there is any ground of
reason for the proposal of
Bahon Creutz. Southern
plants are known to shoot
up at about the age which
lie would fix for the ma-
turity of the Swedish species
of turnip. If his estimate
is correct, Juliets are found
in higher latitudes than they have heretofore been supposed to
flourish in.
On the other hand, supposing the view of M. Montgomery to be well-
founded, the Swede must be a vegetable of slowish growth. At twenty,
five in this country such produce has passed by four years the term at
which it becomes capable of disposing of itself, and is marketable by
the grower at a still earlier period. The truth probably lies between
Creutz and Montgomery; and the fair average Swede attains to its
full capacity at nearly the same age with the British tuber.
If Baron Creutz would import some of his fine early Swedes into
this country, they might find purchasers; and would constitute highly
attractive leatures at our agricultural exhibitions and cattle-shows.

Freddy. "Boo-hoo.—Cousin Harry says they won't take me into hit

THE BARD OF BICESTER.
Most of us hare in our youth been delighted with the brief but
pleasantly flowing narrative of the fate of the lady commemorated in
the beautiful lines:—
t ill an Old Tailor of Bicester,
I went out to walk with his sister,
When a bird called a Jay,
Took the old girl away.
Before the old gentleman t'
'There i
Ho wei
Many, of course, have been our speculations as to the real character
erf t.'kU event. When very young, we accepted it in its literalit.y, and
as thoroughly believed that the lady had been borne away by the bird,
as we believed that G»nymede was carried to Olympus bv one eagle, or
Teddy O'Rouhkk to the moon by another. Later in life, we began
to reflect that the age of miracles was past, and that for a bird called
a jay—which we had seen among our noble father's ancestral woods,
and also at the Zoological Gardens for sixpence (on Mondays)—to
carry away a nubile maiden, would be a marvel for which even an anti-
Mosaic geologist would hardly have swallow enough. We therefore
surmised that the bird was an ardent admirer of the lady's, and that
his name was Jay—not an uncommon name (there was a Reverend
Mr. Jay, of Bath, much respected)—and that it was he who had
snatched the damsel, playfully called an Old Girl, from the protection
of her careless brother. Later still, we decided—as one does in the
case of most miraculous stories—that nobody knew whether the tale
were true or false, and that it did not much matter which it was.
And iu that negative atmosphere we reposed.
But a revival of our old sensations has taken place, and a gush of
child like faith has returned upon us, swamping at once our rationalism
and our apathy. We have had news from Bicester. Some ignorant
ersons may want to know where Bicester is. To such—for we must
e rude to none—we reply, that Bicester, Bisetter, or Burchester, is
in Oxfordshire. It was founded under Birinus (bishop of Caer Dor,
which of course is Dorchester), and is noted for its ale. A lively ana
not over-grown print called the Bicester Herald is an organ of the
place, and a hignly respectable organ; and Mr. Punch is happy to
acknowledge that in the journal in question he has made the discovery
that not only is the Sister of the Old Tailor of Bicester still alive, but
that she is still blooming in beauty. A young and ardent Bard of
Bicester, perhaps the Coming Man of the Age, has just addressed to
her some verses which Mr. Punch insists on transplanting from t heir
modest Oxfordshire parterre to his own garden—Paxtoma and Ver-
sailles in one. Here they are, in all their grace and beauty:—
6
TO M.
Dear M.. I have read with delight in extromo,
The lines dedicated to me.
Which tell of the dreams of happiness.
Thou art wont to indulge in, of me.
'I was not aware, there was ought in tbo
Of thy hand, when I parted from thee:
I canuot say that a sigh, stray word, or a
Ever feU yet unbidden from me.
1 Why should'st thou bear for me this secret love.
Unchanging, deep, and true!
If I were not engaged, perhaps then it might be,
That I would fall on my knees before you.
"Oh t say not woman's lot is silence—
She has many means to try;—
And oft in muteness gains ber
bof the c

Bicetter."
(Know*st
Where t to basely spum a heart,
And deem it then forgot.
"I trust at Love's Tribunal when
■ Not Qullty' 1 shall prove,
Thus convince the wi>rld I havo not
This charge of unrequited lore."
At last, then, the veil rises once more on the history of the lovely
ady of the song. The jay did her no harm. He restored her to the
roof of her sires, and she has resided there in peace. But that peace
is now broken. Some one whose name is spelt with six letters—can it
be T*pp*r?—has crossed hei path, and she has loved him. But, alas!
he is "engaged," and, like a true but gentle knight, he discourages
her attentions, and ttnderly chides her advances. He "was not
aware " that he had given her any encouragement, and he hopes to be
able to show that he has not, as, with slight obscurity, he puts it,
"raised the charge of unrequited love." His words may be meaning-
less, judged by grammar, but they are full of meaning in a legal point
of view—it is useless for "M. to bring an action for breach of
promise. Well, well; surely it is better that she should know this at
once than be left, to feed herself with false hopes, and at length waken
from the sweet dream of years to the chill morning of desolation. He
of the six stars has done well not to " fall on his knees "—firstly,
because doing so would have spoiled his Sunday trousers, and,
secondly, because it would have imperilled the happiness of a life.
Sister of the aged Sartor, bear as best thou mayest what the Pare*
have sent thee. There may be (to speak as thy brother might) a silver
lining to the black cloud. Some other youth may come, with as
elegant Sunday trousers and more elegant grammar, and thou mayest
"squeeze" his hand, and not receive a lawyer's letter in return.
Meantime, Punch blesseth tbee, for having called up, for him, the
memories of his youth, and for having called up, for the Bicester
Herald, the most extraordinarily abominable rubbish with which a
respectable compositor's eyes were ever insulted. We now know the
very worst a Poet can do.
THE HOME MARKET.
By the late mail from Hong Kong, we are informed, in the midst of
the commercial intelligence, as follows:—
M American Drills—Nothing doing and vory large stocks on hand."
It is quite different with the British Drills in our Volunteer Market,
we rather guess. Here the Drills could not be firmer nor steadier,
and if the stocks of the guns are rather heavy on hand, still they will
be found to go off very oriskly whenever a demand shall arise for
them. They will not hang fire then, you may be sure of it. We are
glad to state, that the utmost confidence prevails in the English Drill
Market, and t hat not a single step has been taken in that direction
but what has been of a forward and most cheering nature. Numerous
as the British Drills now are, and they have spread so quickly and so
universally all over the country that there is scarcely an Englishman's
leg that by this time has not gone through some sort of drill, it gives us
great and unmixed satisfaction to remark, that there is scarcely a bit
of bad stuff amongst the whole lot of them. It is also a new feature
in these British Drills, that there is not the least shrinking about
them. The more they arc tried, the stouter they stand.
He'« not Everybody.
M. de Walewski, who is a Pole, threatens to resign office if the
Pope's despotism is not to be upheld. Suppose he did resign f There
are still two other Poles, on which we almost venture to believe the
world would still revolve.

THE WESTMINSTER REPRESENTATION.
When Mr. Punch informs
his readers that Westmin-
ster must be condoled with
for ■ having been deprived
of her Representation, his
readers naturally will ask,
what can Westminster have
done that she should be
disfranchised? and imagi-
nary cases of bribe-giving
and corrupting will perhaps
be conjured up by their
imaginative minds. There
is, however, in reality no
cause for such imaginings.
Westminster, until lately,
has had two representa-
tions: the one wherein Sib
John Shelley and Sib de
Lacy Evans have been
popularly chosen to appear
in the first parts, and
the other wherein Davut,
Phormio, and Geta have
been among the principal
characters assigned, and
have from time to time
elicited cheers quite as loud
as those which ever have awakened the echoes of St. Stephens. It
is this latter Representation which Westminster has lost, and which
Mr. Punch and all "old Westminsters" lament. Amplius hand!—
were Mr. Punch in an elegiac mood, he could indite some touching
lines on this suggestive subject. Amplius hand!—let the student
put in classic phraseology even so prosaic a statement as the follow-
ing, and provided that his lines will scan, and there be no false
quantities, he may depend on getting praise in abundance on next
3Verse day:"—
"Farewell to Vf mmm Play.—The time-honoured Westminster Play i« no
more 1 Dean Trench, impressed by arguments which are no doubt of great weight,
has determined that it shall be abolished : and we have therefore seen the last of
I the perplexities of Chrema. the knaveries of Jtavus, and the gasconades of raro*o.
We cannot help looking back with some regiet upon those meetings, when the
flower of our youth, our future Statesmen, Chancellors, and Bishops, essayed before
an indulgent audience tho difficult art of giving? effect in speech and action to the
deepest emotions of the human heart. There was s< mething very inspiriting in the
burst of applause with which some 'old Westminster,1 who had cl mben to the top of
the tree, and now seated himself in the Pit, to fight over again the battles of Lis
youth in the person of his graudson. was received as he entered. Pleasant, too,
was It to observe the tact with which some of the youthful actors took up the
points, and gave effect in a dead language to the wit of a dramatist who lived two
thousand years ago."
Reading this, the reader, if he be but as "intelligent" as writers
love to call him, will naturally ask, what the "arguments" could be
why the Flay should be abolished, seeing there was so much that was
pleasant and heart-moving in it. On this point in the following there
u somewhat of enlightenment :—
"The morality of Terence, though good as far as it goes, is imperfect when com-
pared with that by which Society Is now governed. Though the boys may daily
read in the 7Ym/« which lies on their mother's drawin groom tables, of scenes as bad
as any that Terence depicts, still it is better not to put into the mouths of boys sen-
timents which would shock the susceptibilities of their mothers and sisters, if they
understood them. The preparations of the play, too, no doubt interfered with the
graver avocations of the school. It was a thing of the past. Public opinion was
against it, and Dear Trench will not be blamed for giving it the coup dt tract."
So at least thinks the Guardian. But whether or no the Guardian
is gifted with the power of gauging public opinion, and has foundation
for its statement that public opinion was against the playing of the Play,
Mr. Punch will leave his readers to determine for themselves, if it
happen that they think it worth their while to do so. With regard,
too, to the prophecy which the Guardian has put forth, that Dean
Trench "will not be blamed" for abolishing the Play, Mr. Punch is
not disposed to accept this as fulfilled yet, inasmuch as he himself sees
certain grounds for censure, and is by no means yet convinced but that
he will have to give it. The plea that Terence although " good" is not
'"perfect" in morality, cannot, properly considered, be held to justify
his banishment. Shakspeare might be proscribed on a similar
account, and there would be not more advantage in so doing. There
is such a fault as being overnice, and grossness very often is produced
by too much delicacy. We must say good-bye to a good part of the
classics, if we exorcise all the writers wno have written aught
unsavoury. We cannot wish our sons to have their mouths so full of
foulness that they needs must blurt it out before their mothers and
their sisters. On the other hand, however, we have no wish they
should cultivate such mealy-mouthed mock-modesty as should make
tbem wear an eyeglass so as not to use the naked eye, or blush when
asking to be helped to the bosom of a chicken.
His Very Reverence Dean Trench is a bit of a philosopher; but
such acts as these but smack of the philosophy of Cant, and Mr.
Punch in no way can extend to them his reverence. The Westminster
Play was a pleasant institution. It afforded a meet meeting-place for
old schoolfellows and playmates. It may have had some evil, but it
had far more good; and Mr. Punch unfeignedly regrets its abolition.
Quitta non movere is a good old Tory maxim, and there was in this
case no fit reason to depart from it. One often sees a theatre turned
into a dormitory, _ but the Westminster Players did precisely the
reverse, and so praisewort hy an example should not have been abolished.
Dean Tbench is learned in proverbs—hath he not filled a volume
with themP but there is one which surely has escaped his memory.
When his Deanship gave bis dictum that Terence should be banished,
he must clearly have forgotten that—
"All work and no Plat,
Hakes Jack a dull boy."
This is a wise saw, and Dean Trench, if he be wise, will not fly in
its teeth. Work is very well, but play, at times, is better. Neque
temper arcum. Minds, like bodies, grow up stunted, if they always
have their backs bent. What though it "interfered with graver
avocations," Westminster Play was a part of education. Besides
teaching elocution—which is never learned at College—it fostered
kindly feelings, and evoked most pleasant sympathies. Let Dean
Trench rescind his recent resolution, and when next the curtain falls
upon the Westminster Representation, Mr. Punch will be among the
very first to cry out Plaudiie!
TWO HUNDRED RIDES IN THE QUEEN'S VAN.
At the Guildhall Police Office a woman was brought up, who, it was
represented, had been locked up no less than two hundred times. We
have heard of the " Heto of a Hundred Fights;" the existence of the
"Author of a Hundred Pieces " is also not unfamiliar to us ; but the
revelation of this new " Heroine of Two Hundred Lock-ups strikes
us perfectly prostrate with astonishment. Her whole life, framed on
the model of a beehive, must have consisted of nothing but a series
of cells, although the proportion of whacks must have preponderated
largely over that of honey, forming a moral contrast between the
rewards that are generally attendant upon a career spent in idleness or
industry. Better to have kept her a perpetual inmate in prison, we
think, than to liberate her two hundred times merely to look her up
again two hundred times. In prison she would have been out of
harm's way, whereas as soon as she was set free, she returned once
more to her old practices of smashing windows and assaulting the
police.
The life of this unfortunate creature is but a sorry comment on the
efficacy of our prison discipline; or was her nature so hardened that
no reformatory could possibly make an impression upon itP In the
Sresent instance, this ' Heroine of Two Hundred Assaults " was con-
emned to twenty-one days' imprisonment with hard labour. The
same treatment having failed two hundred times previously, is there
much chance of its succeeding on the two-hundredth-and-nrst time P
Common sense would dictate the trial of some other remedy, or else
it would be only charitable, until such time as she has learnt to distin-
guish right from wrong, to confine her in some place of security,
where she could not inflict injury either upon herself or others.
AN UNUSUAL NEW YEAR'S GIFT.
An Imperial patent is published in the Vienna Gazette, regulating
the financial system of Austria on a perfectly new basis. The patent
acquires the form of law on the First of January. This is a New
Year's gift worth its weight in gold, though perhaps we are too hasty.
It will be as well not to go on so quickly. Suppose we say worth its
weight in copper. We will begin first with kreuzers, then work our
way cautiously up to florins, and end gradually, a small Louis d'or at
a time, with gold. The grandsons of the present Boeotian population
may probably come in for the latter some hundred years hence. We
cannot have everything at once. However, the poor Viennese are
delighted at the opening of the new prospect before them, aud perhaps
it is the extreme distance of it that lends an additional enchantment
to the view. They are so tired of the paper currency, that they are
glad a la Charles Mathews, to take "an} thing for a change."
Ignorance in High Life.

RATHER A KNOWING THING IN NETS.
Admiring Friend. "Why, Frank! What a Capital Dodge!"
Frank. "A—ia-as. My Beard is seen a bore, tliat I have takes a hint prom the Fair Sex."
CLERICAL OLD CLO' MEN.
The recent ferment in St. George's in the East, or Yeast, was
mainly caused by the odd clothing of the clergyman who preached
there. By the account of an eye-witness, this minister was habited—
"Not In the ordinary linen surplice, with tlie graceful appendages of scarf and
univernity hood, but In a yellowish white > l >ak fastened close round the neck, with
trimmings consisting of broad gold laco embroidery, with a cross woven in ttio back."
Seeing that the Puseyites do all they can to make their services
theatrical, we should fancy that an extra "effect" might be produced
if their "yellowish white cloaks" were fashioned a la opera clonk, and
if a crush nat were used by them as headcover. The "broad gold lace
embroidery," which is worn by way of "trimmings" smacks some-
what of the footman rather than the clergyman; but perhaps this is
used to indicate humility, and to be a badge to mark the servants of
the Church.
In defence of these queer vestments it is urged, that they are merely
the "ornaments of a minister," which are by the rubric directed to be
worn: the rubric ordering that—
•'Such ornaments <»f the Church and of tho ministers thereof shall be retuinod,
and be in into, as were in the Cl-urch of England by authority of Parliament In the
2nd yeur of Kino Edward the 8ixth."
But they who quote this in defence of their eccentric way of dressing,
need reminding of the fact, that, "things isn't as they used to was."
The old cfc)' of the Church which these old clo' men have revived were
in Kino Edward's reign cut. out, for a set and special object; the
purpose being to distinguish between the contempt, of all ecclesiastical
apparel on the part, of the severe and strict Genevan School, and the
endeavour to retain or reproduce the customs of the Romish priest-
hood, which were then becoming exploded and disused. There
is no more reason now that the clergy should be robed in the
apparel of Kino Edward's time, than that the laity should wear the
costume of that period. Vestments so old-fashioned are not fitting for
an age so progressive as our own. They indicate to our mind a back-
sliding in the Church; a sliding back, that is, to the costumes of the
past, which are like its customs, quite unsuited to the present.
At any rate, however, if the habit be persisted in, we trust our
bishops will take leaves from the Puseyitish fashion-books, and come
out in the "gorgeous array" of some two hundred years ago. They
might, in one respect at least, find the costume not unserviceable.
The formidable boots which were in vogue in Edward's time might be
used just now with considerable effect upon such persons as the Church
would be the better for ejecting.
ROMAN CATHOLIC EMIGRATION.
The Roman Catholics, in their published protest, declare that they
will not endure the subjection of their Sovereign Pontiff to any earthly
authority. He shall be a King! Marking their "absolute shall,
which Congress may possibly disregard, Mr. Punch, the patron of the
persecuted, begs to propose the formation of an Emigration Society,
with a view to accommodate these protestant papists. This charitable
Association will endeavour to provide the funds necessary to enable
them to abj_nre the realm, and exchange the constitutional Government
of Queen Victoria for the paternal despotism of Pio Mono. They
will thus be empowered to enjoy that form of government in preference
to the other, just, as the Mormons, forsaking the institutions of the
United States, deputed to rejoice under the theocracy of Joe Smith,
and his successor, Bkicham iodno. A large exodus of the "faithful"
may consequently be expected; that is, if nis Holiness will agree to
place, himself at the head of it, and shift the Chair of Peter (with a
Mahometan legend upou it) to some locality as far removed from
modern civilisation as Utah, and the borders of the Salt Lake. They
will leave their country for their country's good, as many others have
done before them who entertained similar views on the subject of
high-treason.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

1815 AND 1860.
Sat beside the spent yule-log,
In its grey ashes lying;
Outside, in oold December's
arms,
The Old Year lay a-dying.
The spirits of the bye-gorie
years
Moved round him, to and
fro;
And the young New Year
stood bent to hear
The red cock's midnight
crow,
As the bells begin to ring
him in
Merrily over the snow.
J3ut never New Year, me-
thought, did wear
Upon his baby-brow,
Less blithesome cheer than
this New Year
That we have crowned
e'en now.
His baby head is helmeted,
In his baby grasp a brand,
In his baby eye a inysteiy,
And a look of stern com-
mand:
And babe though he be, it is plain to see
He has man's work on hand.
Proudly, but painfully, he stept
Up to the vacant throne,
Across the corpse of the dead Old Year
That lay uncrowned, and prone.
And to all the hosts of the past years' ghosts
This haughty challenge threw:
"Your work ye have done, but never a one
Such work as I've to do;—
From the first of the eighteenhundrcda
To him that I'm heir unto."
When to answer his boast, forth stepped a ghost
Of diplomatic air;
His coat was broidered on all the seams,
His knee was gartered fair:
With stars and crosses and ribbons,
His breast it glittered sheen,
No order at all, so great or small,
But there its badge was seen;
Quoth he—" You see here, that famous jcar
Eighteen hundred and fifteen.
"'Twas I that drew the protocols
Of Paris and Vienna;
Laid Europe's best and bravest at rest
In Waterloo's red Gehenna;
'Twas I pulled down Napoleon;
And set the Bourbon high;
'Twas I gave Prance her last war-dance,
And her supper of humble-pie;
'Twas I that linked black eagles three
In a Holy Alliance tie.
"The map of Europe I recast
In the form it wears to-day;
Knocked frontiers about, dealt kingdoms out,
In a free-and-easy way.
I pooh-poohed national feelings,
I laughed at the claims of race:
What were they to escape my stout red-tape,
Or protest in my parchments' face P
So I bade them be quiet, and diplomates'/«/
I set up in their place.
"All this did I, with a hand so high,
That the pressure yet remains;
My mould I set on the world, and jet
That mould the world retains.
'Tis true that of my protocols
Kings and Kaisers have cracked a few;
They nave set up a new crown here and tuire,
And burked a republic or two,—
The Napoleons have turned up again,
And the Bourbons fallen through.
"But still I'm the year that all revere
As the ground of things that be;
Not a Kaiser or King his title can bring
To other founder than me.
And you dare come, you Hop-o'-my-Thumb,
To talk of your work,—pooh-pooh!
After all I have done, I should like to know
What there is left lot you?"
Quoth young Sixty, serene," You forget,—Fifteen
Your doings to undo!"
LADIES' TRAINS.
"Mr. Punch,
"As you devote a considerable part of your columns to the
exposure, with a view to the correction, of the too many bad habits of
the female sex, I will trouble you, if you will let me, to denounce a
gross annoyance which ladies who travel by railway are very apt to
inflict upon their fellow-passengers.
"The annoyance to which I allude is that of causing both windows
of the carriage to be closed, even in the mildest weather, and thus
obliging all the people who are in it to continue for some hours
breathing an atmosphere consisting chiefly of the products of their
own respiration.
"I was served this trick, Sir, by a foolish woman only the other day.
She asked me if I had any objection to have the window, by which I
was sitting, up. I made no answer, but raised it a foot or so, leaving
room for the escape of the air which we were contaminating. There
were some half-dozen of us all together, stifling ourselves in our own
breath. This was not enough to satisfy her, and presently she desired
to know if I had any objection to close the window altogether. I
grinned, and did it. Our united exhalations instantly condensed on
the inside of the glass, and I had to rub a hole in the dew which was
formed by them in order that I might look out.
"Is this lndy aware that she continually gives out a lot of carbonic
acid gas and watery vapour from her chest, and that other people
exhale the same matters, of which the repeated respiration is unwhole-
some, although she may not consider it unpleasant. P Sir, I wish to
j impress upon the female mind, that fresh air is salubrious, and that
I foul air is poison, and that women commonly entertain an excessive
fear of the effect upon the chest of slight cold, and a reckless disregard
| of the pulmonary influence of gross contamination.
"Por fear, however, lest instruction should be refused,—as it cer-
tainly will by tho majority of those to whom it is offered,—I would
request Railway Directors to take steps for enabling reasonable
creatures to secure themselves from being half suffocated in railway
carriages by travellers of the opposite sex. Let ladies' carriages be
provided expressly for ladies, and for those men whom choice may
cause to prefer such insanitary travelling-companions. How incon-
sistent it is to prohibit healthy smoking in railway trains, whilst
unwholesome fuming is permitted to any amount without regard to
"Sir, women are willing enough to let you waste your breath i
you attempt to talk to them for their good, or for your own, and they
might not be so desirous, as they mostly are, to make you consume it
a hundred times over. But so it is. I say, then, let female railway
travellers have special carriages, if they needs must sit with closed
windows; let them have locomotive Black Holes of Calcutta all to
themselves, and to those who may be willing to Bhare their suffocation
for the sake of their society, amongst whom will certainly not be
included your elderly reader,
"Oxygen."
ALDERMANIC REASONING.
The following sentence was dropped at Guildhall, and picked up by
us, as being a great deal too good to be lost:—
"ALDkuMAN Franis. Tou are mi old offender, and although your conduct deserve*
a heavy punishment, I shall not send you for three mouths, ss you would be too
comfortable In prison. I shall therefore send you to prison for twenty-one days."
Why, then, let us ask, should this old offender have the opportunity
of being " comfortable" even for twenty-one days P If prison is such
a comfortable place, the great punishment would consist in a criminal
not being allowed to go there. It should be held out as a reward
rather than as a punishment. None but the good and deserving should
be allowed to enter it, and occasionally the wicked and lawless should
be taken round the wards to see how very happy and comfortable the
former were in them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [January 7, 1860.
DEATH OF A VALUABLE MEMBER OF SOCIETY.
he Talking Fish is dead!
The event is sad enough
to strike every Member
of Parliament dumb with
apprehensions of his own
future doom. This sud-
den demise is greatly to
be regretted, as l here were
hopes of the Fish being
able to attend the Con-
gress about to be held in
Paris. Doubtlessly he
would have spoken as
much to the purpose as
any other official there,
lie would have said " Pa"
to the representative of
the Holt Father, and
"Ma" to the old woman
who does duty for the
Emperob. of Austria,
and what more could
have been wanted? If
a question bad arisen as
to the "balance of Eu-
rope," he could have
pointed to his own scales,
and proved how worthy
he was to hold either the
one or the other by ba-
lancing himself as upright
as any judge (an English
one, of course—who ever
heard of any other that was upright P) right on the tip of his tail. He has been dis-
appointed, also, in not having been invited to diue with Lord Cowley, who, on this
occasion,—and this occasion only—might have been able to boast of having had Fish for
dinner; but all these wonderful things, and many more, have been abruptly checked in
their career by the untimely decease of this duosyllabic wonder, who, when lie met you, did
not accost you with, "1 have just two words to say to you," and then, like too many talkative
monsters in human form, detain you by the button-hole for at least a couple of hours. He
was eminently a fish and not a bore. He said his two words, and no more, simply because
he did not know more than two. His tongue was always dancing a pas de deux (the

paternal and maternal salutations above alluded
to), and you could never persuade him to exe-
cute any other pas, or "Ma" either. He
must have been a good son, this Talking Fish,
for you never could get him to talk upon any
other subject but that, of his parents. In fact,
he was endeared to his master from the fact
of his pay-rental propensities, which he would
exhibit more or less strongly at every new place
he went to.
The loss of the Talking Fish will be largely
felt in the circle in which he moved,—by which
we mean, the large tub in which he was in the
habit of taking his daily rounds. According to
the information we have received from our usual
authentic sources, the Talking Fish is !o be
buried, not in Westminster Abbey, nor St. Paul's,
but in Billinsgate Market. His epitaph, borrowed
from the ducal hatchments, is to be simply, "In
Sealo Quies." Mr. Chisholh Anstey has
offered his services as chief mourner; but it is
expected that the compliment will be paid, par
preference, to Mr. Gladstone, not only because
his "talking" powers are fully equal to those of
his loquacious rival, but also because he is more
closely connected with the Seals of Office, to
which, it is well known, the lamented deceased
had the ambition of aspiring.
Wc need not state that the Talking Fish died
deeply regretted by his keepers, who will feel
his loss most deeply in that part where losses
are generally felt by persons the most deeply,—
viz , the breeches pocket.
What complaint the Talking Fish had, beyond
receiving every now and then a scanty supply of
flounders, we cannot state; but we understand
that he took his final leap from this world into
the next in his rash efforts to combine in his
own person the Seal and Die Department. He
succeeded eventually, and but too well, as the
fact of his own dying painfully testified. It was
his first, as it will be his last attempt in that
line, though it must be confessed that he has
succeeded in making a tolerably deep impression
with it.
IMPORTANT MEDICAL MEETING.
A Numerous meeting of the medical profession was held at
Apothecaries' Hall on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of considering
the propriety of presenting a testimonial from the profession to the
Clerk of the Weal her, in return for his recent management of his
department. Dr. Twaddler was unanimously called to the chair.
Dr. Twaddler said, that he and other gentlemen had felt that the
weather for the last month had been so extraordinarily favourable to
the profits, the legitimate profits (hear, hear), of the profession to which
he had the honour to belong, and was so exactly that which a medical
man with a proper regard for his family must be delighted to see, that
it seemed hardlj proper to pass it over without notice. The thermo-
meter had varied twenty degrees in a day, and tumbled back, or run
up again in a night, ana he was happy to think that few constitutions
were insensible of changes that sent a man out to nis work perspiring
and brought him home freezing. For himself, he had much more work
to do than he could possibly perform, and had been compelled to
restrict his attendance to the residences mentioned in the Peerage.
But, he did not grudge a share in the spoils (laughter) to his professional
brethren. (Applause.) He would call on his friend Mr. Honeyboy
to move the first resolution.
Mr. Honeyboy said, that they should really cut matters short, for
time was fees in a time like this, and they must make hay while the
influenza shines upon them. He was happy to say, that the weather
was most trying, most depressing; you scarcely met a person without
a miserable cough, and as for the children, their life was one long
snivel. (Applause.) He thought the Clerk of the Weather deserved
their best thanks, and (here a bultony lad ran in and whispered the
speaker. Ironical plaudits.) "No, no, my dear fellows," said Mr.
Honeyboy laughing, "it's not humbug this time; he has a real
message for me, a whole family laid up, thank Influenza!" (Ihe
speaker bolted.)
Mr. D'Emulgent said that their friend had gone off in such a hurry,
aperiently (roars of laughter), that he had forgotten his resolution.
Truly they ought to be thankful, for never was there so much sickness
about—not dangerous, mind you, for that it would be wrong to be glad
of, besides its being difficult to deal with, but that sort of very trouble-
some, irritating, disagreeable illness that made everjboriy fidgety and
frightened unless the medical man was constantly m the house. He
thought, however, that, any demonstration on their part was unwise,
as there was already a feeling abroad that if people washed themselves
well, lived well, took exercise, talked cheerfully, and laughed often,
they might do without a good deal of the medical attendance they now
paid heavily for, and it would be well not to increase any prejudice
against the profession.
Mr. Fitzlabel agreed. They were going on very well, let
them take their money and be quiet. He had his washing-copper
brewed full of "The Draught" every morning, and it was empty at
night. (Sensation and applause.)
Dr. Greed had been afraid the weather was going to settle, but up
to that time there were no unfavourable symptoms. He advised their
making their game while they could, and talking about it, if people
wanted, to talk (he didn't) afterwards.
Dr. Twaddler said, that, as this seemed to be the view of the meet-
ing, he would adjourn it sine die, and retire from the chair, heartily
congratulating the profession on a state of things that must fill them
with so much justifiable pleasure.
After the usual vote of thanks, the meeting rushed off to make pills.
LORD BYRON, LORD PUNCH, AND LORD FINGALL.
Lord Fingall, an Irish Catholic nobleman, has very properly
refused to join the ridiculous movement which the Irish priests have
commanded their dupes and tools to perform on behalf of the Pope.
His Lordship's father has his name embalmed in a verse by Lord
Byron, which verse Mr. Punch (in every way a superior poet to the
latter) begs to modify as follows, in honour of the son:—
"Well done, that thou would'st-not, O Fingall, recal
The fetters on millions of Catholic limbs,
And manly the scorn thou must lavish on all
The slaves, that now hail Pope Perugia with hymns."

As LSttle Grigley is on his way to call upon those Jolly Gurls he met on New Year's Evb, he thinks he will
have his Boots touched up. Just as the polishing begins, the Jolly Gurls come round the coener. "Dooced awkward!
Wasn't it?" as Little Grigley said.
TOBACCO-STOPPERS WANTED.
That very reverend Tobacco Stopper the Dean op Carlisle has
hcen breathing forth a second Counterblast against, tobacco, which lie
denounces as the root, or at least the plant, of evil, and brings argu-
ments to prove it of pure Satanic growth. Now Mr. Punch cannot
eclio such a damnatory blast, nor join in any whole-hog putting-down
of pigtail. As an advocate of temperance in language as in liquor,
or in any other form or shape whatever, Mr. Punch holds that, smoking
is good in moderation; and that it is not the use, but the abuse of it.
that harms people. Mr. Punch will therefore join in no Tobacco Total
Abstinence Society, nor will he lend a hana'towards stopping men
from moderately smoking. With regard to boys, however, the case is
widely different. Ali smoking must with them be smoking in excess—
in excess both of their physical requirements and capacities. As a
matter of requirement, boys no more need tobacco than any other
stimulant, and they are not mature enough to use it. without injury.
Any boy who smokes should be treated, Mr. Punch thinks, as a
juvenile delinquent, and by way of counter-stimulant, should have
a dose of birch immediately given to him.
That the evil is a "growing one " among us is quite patent. Grow-
ing lads of any age from six to sixteen daily practise it. Besides the
little vagabonds who prowl about our streets, and play at pitch-and-
toss on Sundays with short pipes in their mouths, there are a higher
class of juveniles who ought to have their pipes put out, and Mr. Punch
would willingly assist that operation. The latter lads stand higher in
point of social status, and their position in the streets is certainly
niore elevated. But although they commonly are seen upon the knife-
bonrd of an omnibus, they are by no means raised thereby in Mr.
Punch1/ estimation; and their habit of short-pipe smoking tends still
more to lower them. As a rule, these lads do not smoke because they
really like it, but because they think it manly to be seen to smoke,
and fancy that they show their independence by so doing. It is.
therefore, not for pleasure, but for snobbishness, they smoke, and
there is no redeeming reason for excusing them. Their pallid pimpled
cheeks, and sallow tallowy complexions, are sufficient indications that
tobacco does not, agree with them: and while their moral health suffers
through the snobbishness aforesaid, their vital stamina is sapped by
the tucking of their cutties. Every whiff which they inhale blows a
portion of their brains out; the more they fill their pipes, the more
their heads they empty. They begin to smoke too young, and grow
prematurely old by it. By the time that they reach manhood, they
nave become the very poorest apologies for men; for it is the nature
of the weed to mate all those grow "weedy" who precociously
indulge in it.
THE TREATMENT OF THE NAVY.
Old Admiral Bowles, in a despatch dated Nov. 20th, admonishes
the Lords of the Admiralty by telling them, in reference to the cause
of the mutiny on board the Princess Royal, that—
"Nothing can be more injudicious And unjust than the way in which officer* and
men returning from lengthened foreign service aro treated with respect to loave;
that they are dealt with as if they were culprits in whom no confidence could bo
Eli,',- i. and nre imprisoned unnecessarily on board their ships, while overy possible
idulgenco is extended to all around them."
Subsequently, Dec. 13th, in another letter, addressed to the same
high authorities, the jolly old Admiral expresses the opinion that—
"The severest measures should be taken to crush this rising spirit of insubordi-
nation in the British Navy."
What a fine doctor the Admiral would have made. An eruptive
complaint is closely analogous to a mutiny. How would Dr. Bowles
have treated a case of small-pox or scarlatina. Doubtless, by the
severest measures calculated to suppress the eruption. He would t bus
have made short work of the exanthemata, to the emolument of the
undertakers.
But if Dr. Bowles would have taken his severe measures with the
system, and instituted active treatment, not against mere symptoms,
but lor the removal of their causes, then we beg Admiral Bowles's
pardon. The gallant old officer would be for putting down insub-
ordination among seamen by hanging or flogging, or otherwise bleeding,
and physicking the misrulers of the Navy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
POPE AND CONGRESS.
The Papacy's a curious thing:
The Pope comprises Priest and King.
Of Kings he is to be the least.
Because he id the greatest Priest.
What, justice can a Prince decree
Like delegate of Deity P
What King should reign like him you call
The Vicar of the King of all?
If, then, the Pope his subjects rule
At best, i.o better than a fool,
His claim to Vicarship would seem
An imposition or a dream.
If what you deem a rock be snnd,
You'll build thereon what will not stand;
No scheme, within the smallest space,
Will do, with humbug for a base.
Napoleon, you'll restrict, in vain,
To Rome alone the Pope's domain;
The mischief you will but confine:
True Priest and bad King can't combine.
A NEW LITERARY INVENTION.
It is extremely disagreeable to a conscientious person to be found
out in a falsehood. For this reason Mr. Punch, who is excessively con-
scientious, hails with delight a recent improvement in the letter-writing
department of life. •
Out of ten letters which one receives, about two are of a kind which
i it is a pleasure, four a duty, and the rest a simple bore, to answer.
; One's habit of course, therefore, is to answer the first, and perhaps
! one or two of the otters, at once, but to postpone and neglect the
i mass. Then, when it becomes an actual necessity to write, one is
bothered to begin with a neat falsehood by way of excuse, or to choose
I. among the half-dozen falsehoods that naturally occur to the elegant
| mind. And another thing is, that there is the probability of sending
contradictory falsehoods to people who are likely to meet one another,
i It is a bore to find that you nave written to a man that you have been
! in Paris for three weeks, and to his brother that you have been laid up
for a month in chambers with gout, and that the two have compared
! your notes at the table of their father, to whom you have intimated
that a domestic affliction has detained you at Brighton.
I Mr. Punch has, therefore, received with pleasure, from an enter-
Srising engraver, whose invention he commends to the notice of
Iessbs. Pheasant & Uncles, or Gherkins & Grotto, or some other
of the great stationary firms, a device for saving a good deal of time
and perplexity in the respect alluded to. Everybody's note paper is
already engraved with his address, and (except in the case of idiots)
with Mr. Rowland Hill's district initial. The ingenious party who
has sent to Mr. Punch goes a little further, and actually begins the
Letter of Excuse for you. Here are some of the specimens:—

in a drawer in the nursery. I suppose that it must have been secreted
by one of the children, and forgotten by the servant. I deeply regret
the delay, and hurry off a line to say that
No. 3.
"Mr dear Aunt, "Eltham, S.E.
"I ielt so overcome at hearing from you of the demise of

"Dear Sra, "War Office, S. W.
"I duly received your letter, but up to the present time was
unable to read it, owing to your writing such an abominably undeci-
pherable hand. But I now gather from a word here and there that
you want some money, and I beg to inform you that
Mr. Punch cannot find room for more specimens, but the nature of
this commodious invention is now clear. Separate pigeon-holes must
be kept for the different forms, and if a writer makes a memorandum
of the number of the form he has used and the person to whom he
sends it, every one of the above excuses, and twenty more, may be
sent to each of his correspondents. Before the stock is exhausted,
parties will have left off writing to him. Any communications for the
inventor may be sent to 85, Fleet Street, and Mr. Punch, not being
a government official, will not hinder the poor man from carrying out
his idea, and not being a British manufacturer, will not steal the
invention and cheat the discoverer.
• Fill up with any place, for even If inquiries are made, the result will only be
the same that always occurs when a letter hat been written and lost—nobody knows
anything about it.

A CHANT FOR CHRISTMAS.
ET A POET WHO BELONGS TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.
Hail, Christmas! Hail, thou season festive!
And bring thy feasts most indigestive:
Mince pies, plum pudding, and boar's head,
Which on the stomach lie like lead.
Go, diner out, and stuff and swill.
That thou thereby may'st be made ill:
Go, eat thy pudding and thy beef,
Then come to me and buy relief.
Ye nightmares, from dyspepsia bred,
Now haunt the supper-eater's bed,
Bid sleep his heavy eyelids flee,
Then in the morn he 11 send for me.
Ye parents, now your children cram
With jellies, mincemeat, cakes and jam
Of pudding too be liberal givers.
And so derange their infant livers.
The poisoned sweets to them present,
Which cakes of Twelfth Night ornament:
Their palates clog with "rock" and "drops,"
And cloy their tongues with lollipops.
Come, snapdragons, a flaming brood,
Mo9t indigestible as food:
Tempt small boys with your fiery sweets,
That he may be made ill who eats.
"Tis sweet the merry groups to see
Who throng around the Christmas Tree;
'Tis sweeter still to think that they
Will probably be ill next day.
Hail, Christmas, then! Of all the vear
To doctors thou 'rt the time most dear.
The more thou temp'st to stuff and swill,
The longer grows the doctor's bill.

PUNCH v. BURQOYNE.
(IN THE HATTER OF "LINE l». VOLUNTEERS.")
"Nothing like leather," quoth the currier in the old story.
"Nothing like Regulars," says Sir John Biirootne, in his paper in
the Cornhitt Magazine, apropot of our Rifle Volunteers. One of Sir
John's principal reasons for his rating any possible force of Volunteers
low in comparison with the regular, well set-up, well-stocked, well-
packed Linesman or Guardsman, is the way in which (according to Sir
John) the former would suffer under the hardships of campaigning, the
fatigue of the march, the miseries of the wet bivouac, the short rations,
and other creature micomforts that real soldiering brings with it. Sir
John has in his head a certain ideal " Regular Soldier,' who can march
farther,—stand more wet and cold,—put up more cheerfully with a
thin blanket, or occasionally a wet ditch and no blanket at all,—digest
tougher beef, or go without beef altogether more cheerfully and with
less harm to himself,—than the Rifle volunteer.
But where does Sir John find his ideal Regular?
In what way does the life of the Regular Soldier fit him to brave
hardship and stand wear and tear better than the Volunteer P
Are we to look for this soldierly ideal among the ill-lodged, public-
house-haunting, nursemaid-courting ranks of the Guards? Gallant
fellows Mr. Punch knows them to be (witness Alma, Inkermann, and
a thousand other well-fought fields): but strong-bodied fellows, tough
fellows, wind-and-weather-and-hardship-defying fellows, they certainly
are not. Or is our ideal soldier to be sought rather in the Line F
Mr. Punch's answer to that question may be gathered from a number
of other questions he ventures to put.
From what class is the Line recruited P
What are the habits of the average private in the Line P
How is the Linesman lodged at home P how abroad P How is he
fed P How is he clad P What is the effect of his barrack duties,—of
his night-guards.—of his accessibility to the temptations of the can-
teen, the barrack-neighbouring trull-house, and beer-shop, with its
singing and dancing rooms, its atmosphere of drink and tobacco, and
its low excess P Are these the influences likely to harden bodies, any
more than to improve souls P Do they particularly fit a man to face
heavy work, long marches, a wet back, and an empty belly P What is
the fact, as indicated by the figures collected by the commission
which reported on the sanitary condition of the Army in 1858 P Why,
this—that, comparing the death-rate of different classes at ages between
twenty and forty, seventeen Linesmen and twenty Guardsmen die
annually to eight agricultural labourers and out-door workmen in towns,
to nine printers, eight policemen, and ten miners. But our Volunteers
are not agricultural labourers at ten shillings a week; nor printers,
shut np for long hours in the close atmosphere of the composing-room;
nor policemen, liable to long spells of night and day duty without
shelter in all weathers; nor miners, subject to impure air and explosive
gases in the pit, and to foul skins and dirty clothes, and too often
filthy habitations out of it. Our Volunteers are the very thews and
sinews of the population—the pick and flower of the middle class, the
young farmers and squires of our rural districts,—the tradesmen, and
merchants, and gentry, and clerks, of our cities.
If the average of life among these Volunteers could be calculated, it
would be found to give as a result, against the seventeen deaths to
one thousand of the Line, and the twenty to one thousand of the
Guards—not 'he eight deaths of the labourer and policeman, the nine
of the printer, and the ten of the miner,—but something like three or
four, if not even fewer.
Mr. Punch respectfully submits to Sir John Burgotne, that for all
purposes requiring endurance of fatigue and exposure, the stamina of
the Volunteer is likely, caterit paribus, to be to that of the regular
soldier of the Line as seventeen to four, and to that of the Guardsman
as twenty to four: in other words, more than four times as tough and
durable. It is quite true—as the Timet has pointed out—that if you
take any army, winnowed of its weak elements by campaigning, you
will get an uncommonly stout retiduum, capable of resisting almost
any amount cf wear and tear; but Sir John Burgotke's comparison
is not one between Volunteers and veterans, but between Volunteers
and Regulars. While these are the elements of comparison, Mr.
Punch must still be permitted to trust in his own corps of Volun-
teers (in all of them, he should say, being effective member of half-
a-dozen and upwards) as far better, instead of worse, fitted to bear any
amount of hard work, without breaking down, than an equal foroe of
Regulars—be they Linesmen or be they Guardsmen.

and trouble involved in
going to, and giving in

&c. Each advertisement
of a joung lady will consist
of an accurate description
of her personal advantages,
accompanied by a sun-por-
trait, by which the exact-
ness of the text will be
capable of being tested,
vhieh may be apprehended

be unsuited to their peculiar taste. The Photographic Advertiser
offers its columns to the bereaved widow, as well as to the
spinster, regardless of years; the mature conviction of its pro-
prietors being, that no time of life, and no antecedent ties, arc
adequate to forbid the loving heart of woman from endeavouring
to cling, like a tendril, to any eligible ohject of the stronger
sex, that may happen to be brought within its reach: an approxi-
mation to effect which is the express object of the Photographic
Advertiser. To gentlemen, the Photographic Advertiser is like-
wise open, and those happily gifted with regular features, luxuriant
whiskers, a prepossessing expression, and symmetrical proportions,
will be enabled, by its means, to negociate all these endowments
with the utmost facility and at the very lowest terms. Gentlemen
less fortunate in ordinary estimation, will find in the Photographic
Advertiser a medium for the exhibition of those peculiarities of phy-
siognomy or configuration, which are not without their admirers in a
world wide enough for us all, not excepting those who weigh eighteen
or twenty stone. The nose which has never attained to, or which
transgresses, the proportion, or which deviates, in what shape soever,
from the outline of beauty; the eyes which are peculiar in their con-
vergence or in the speciality of their colour; the mouth which differs
widely, or by opposite dimensions, from Apollo's bow, will he. pre-

MINISTERS AT A PROVERB.
Anybody who cannot play the drawing-room game of a Proverb is
an Nass whom it were base flattery to call a Muff. But Mr. Punch is
destined to be read in all after time, and in the. course of three or four
hundred years the game may be forgotten. Who, except Mr. Punch,
now knows how nine out. of ten of the Games of Garoantua, commemo-
rated by Mr. Punch's prototype, Francis Rabelais, were played. They
are Forgotten. And so may the Proverb be. Know, therefore, 0 friends
of the twenty-second century, that the way to play the Proverb is this:
A player, usually a clever person with shrewdness and the gift of the
gab, is sent out of the room, out of earshot. Then the others select a
proverb, and the number of players being accommodated to the
number of words in the proverb, each takes a word. The discoverer
is called in, and he proposes any one question of any kind to each
player. In the reply must come in the word which that player has had
entrusted to him or her. The discoverer must use his wits, and find
out what was the aphorism that hath been thus fragmentarily pro-
pounded. Give the leading or key-words to the cleverest players who
can wrap them up neatest,and the little expletives to your weaker
vessels and young ones. Do you understand that, O ye subjects of
the Emperor of the United States, O ye bigoted Roman Bapiists
of St. Peter's, 0 ye Evangelical worshippers in St. Sophia's, O ye
citizens of tire Austrian Republic, 0 ye slaves of the negro King of
Scotland f
If so, you will understand the fun Mr. Punth and the Palmerston.
Ministers had on last Twelfth Night as ever was. For they played
the Proverb, and this was the manner. The dialogue was taken down
in short-hand by Toby.
Mr. Punch, as incomparably the cleverest of the party, was desired
to withdraw. So he went out and conversed affably with the extremely
handsome damsel who ministered the ministerial refreshments, and
being after a time re-invited, found the Government sitting in a semi-
circle.
"Begin at Atherion and end at John Russell, please," said Mr.
Sidney Herbert.
"All is serene," said Mr. Punch, glancing round the array, and
gracefully taking bis place across a chair, with the back of it in front
of him.
"Mr. New Solicitor-General," began Mr. Punch, " how do you like
the duties of your office?"
"It is very kind of you to inquire, Mr. Punch. I hope I give satis-
faction," said the member for Durham.
"Has he said the word?" demanded Mr. Punch, thinking that his
august presence might have flurried the young statesman.
All right, my boy !" said Palmerston.
"Who are jou calling boy?" retorted Mr. Punch. "Boy yourself,
if you come to that! Campbell, what sort of a judge do you think
."•'"ating is going to make?"
"It's a vura deeficull problem, Mr. Punch," said the Lord Chan-
cellor, "an" I canua rightly say that I'm free to gie ye a response,
my man."
Mr. Punch looked dubiously round.
"My Lord has answered, if you translate the intolerable jargon
called Scotch into Christian English," said Sir Richard Bethell.
"Christian Young Men's Association English, Sir RichakdP"
I asked Mr. Punch, silly. "My dear Duke of Somerset, be pleased
to favour me, if possible, with a civil answer to the following question;
| namely, "Why is it a good thing to be polite to peopleP"
i "Neither you, nor the game, nor anybody sha'l make me admit
that it is a good thing to be polite, Mr. Punch," snapped the Duke,
and the others applauded, at which bis Grace looked more savage than
ever.
"How are your Riflemen getl ing on, Siddy P"
i "Capitally," said Mr. Sidney Herbert. "Not a day passes but I
have a large addition to our National Guard."
i "Glad to hear it. Now, Mr. Attorney, how do you think your
Divorce Court—for really it is jour invention—is workingP"
i "My dear Mr. Punch," said Sir Richard Bethell, "I can say
with perfect conscientiousness that there is no single act, of mine, from
the date at. which I took silk to the present moment, that gives me so
much unadulterated satisfaction as that which established a tribunal
for the redress of conjugal grievances."
Mr. Punch addressed Mr Gladstone.
"Oh, thou tamer of Homer, when wilt thou take off the Income
Tax?"
"I could answer you, my dear -V/-. Punch, in three ways," said Mr.
Gladstone.
"But jou shan't, though," said Mr. Punch. "Once for all."
i "In that, case," said the Chancellor op the Exciuquer, "I must
say that au unqualified pledge upon a financial subject is not a thing
I to be extracted from the custodian of the national purse."
"Very nea'," said the Premier.
i "Is it?" said Mr. Punch. "Perhaps, then you'll do the gaudy, and
tell me whether the Reform Bill is ready?"
| "Talk to Johnny," retorted the jaunty Palmerston. "Idare say
he's posted up in domestic details, as he is Foreign Minister; but the
matter's quite out of my department."
"Confound your impudence, Pam!" said Punch "If I believed
vou, there would be, a jolly row; hut, I don't. Now, Charley Wood,
Low far is it from Calcutta to Melbourne?"
| "Oh, come, I say! I don't think you've any business to be setting
a chap sums when we're only playing a game," said Sir Charles,
"and what is more, I will be blessed if I can tell you, and that's
all about it."
"Answered, or blundered as usual?" asked Mr. Punch.
"Blundered, of course!" shouted everybody. "What did you
expect?"
Eh!" said Sir Charles, "haven't I said the word. Bother! No
more I have. Echo answers in the negative. Give us another
question?"
"In which Presidency is Benares, Sir Charles?" said Mr. Punch,
mildly. "Take your time."
"Well," said Sir Charles, after a pause, "I don't profess to know
a great, deal of geography, but 1 have an impression that Benares is in
Bombay."
"He's said it at last," cried several voices.
"Hm," said Mr. Punch, " I think I see the proverb. Lord Gran-
ville, what's the last canard from Paris P"
"I've heard nothing these Lobdays," said Lord Granville,

the Cabinet, after the conversation with the Emperor."
"Now, my dear Sir George Lewis, as I believe I have found out
the secret, you must wrap up your word very discreetly. What, as a
classical scholar, do you consider the most noble deed performed by the
Ancient Romans f"
"Their smashing those Jews," said the Home Secretary, with a
promptitude that showed he bad not forgiven the Mosaic race for the
trouble he had been caused about, certain loans, when Cliancellor of the
Exchequer. "That, was far and away the best thing the Romans ever
did, that demolishing Jerusalem, under Titus, a.d. 60, walking into
the hooknoses like one o'clock, making'em eat sow's head and sausages
before going to execution, and erecting the Arch of Titus in remem-
brance of that most laudable operation.
"Babes," said Mr. Punch, turning up his thumb, after the manner of
the spectators of gladiator fights, when a victim was floored. "And
now, last and least, my dearly beloved Johnny, do you mean that
Palmerston or yourself shall introduce the Reform Bill of 1860 to
the House of Commons?"
"I have no personal vanity to gratify," said Lord John Russell,
"and I am free to confess that, inasmuch as Lord Palmerston has
the ear of the House, that is a reason why be would introduce the
measure in a popular way. But on the other hand, I am the parent of
the bill, and therefore it may be thought that I ought to bring it in,

"That'll do, John," said Mr. Punch, "keep the rest for the intro-
ductory speech. I tell you what, my lords and gentlemen, you might
have selected a less vulgar proverb. Of course 1 kuow that

RISING CORPS.
A Regiment of boys is being organised in Italy under the patronage
of Garibaldi. This rising corps, which.may be addressed literally, in
the words of the Marsetlaise, as Let Enfant de la Patrie," is already
400 strong. It is not often that Punch is opposed to Garibaldi, or
Garibaldi to Punch, but we do protest most emphatically against this
encouragement of a nuisance that cries out more loudly than any other
for suppression. If Garibaldi wanted a regiment of Italian Boys,
why didn't lie organise a corps out of those that, infest the streets of
London, and appoint Mr. cabbage his recruiting-sergeant? They
would have made rather a formidable body, as their powers are well-
known for driving everybody before them, and effectually clearing the
street at any time.
POPE AND POLE.
Punch's prescience is infallible. The ex-Pole M. Walewski, im-
patient of the Napoleonic attack on priestly despotism, has resigned.
And truly, resignation, with two estates and £5000 a year, as a
parting gift, is an easy martyrdom. Besides which, all the decorations
with which a courtier s coat can be spangled are M. Walewski's. As
A Pope, but not his, says—
Start unnumbered gild the- glowing Pole."
And now perhaps M. Walewski, making way for M. Thouvenel
as the Emperor's Foreign Minister, will betake himself to Rome, in
whosecause he has suffered thus terribly, and receive the blessing of
the Holy Father of Perugia. Touching that blessed parent, it may be
mentioned that Mr. Layard (Punch is glad to welcome him to work
again) has just disinterred the fact that while the Austrians were
occupying Bologna, and committing all the cruelties that their priests
applaud, the Pope interfered once only. Was it to save life? Was it
to restrain brutality? Why, we are speaking of Pius IX. An Austrian
officer had slaughtered a boy of seventeen, and as there was a rule
that boys must be eighteen before Austrians could lawfully slaughter
them, the Popb came forward with a Pardon to the butcher who had
been a little too zealous in the service of the Faith. Will M.
Walewski mention to his friend in the Vatican, that this little cha-
racteristic of the amiable Pontiff is now circulated throughout the
world, and add Mr. Punch't best regards, and assurances, that none of
Pio Nono's good deeds shall be forgotten by Puncho Primo? But
if, as is nut improbable, the whole Walewski affair is merely a shuffle
of cards, we shall one day see the great French acrobat again balancing
his Pole, and in the mean time we may leave the Pole to balance
his exceedingly comforting books. Never did renegadism rule higher
in the market.

or "bonnets" being present. Little Johnny is talking confi-
dentially to the auctioneer. Dizzy and Ned the Sloggek are
busy fingering some second hand clothes, which hang near the door, as
if to attract customers; Jack the Quaker standing apart, and
with the manner of one who has nothing whatever to do with the rest.

However, 'no questions asked' was the order of the day, the pigment was handed

A PUT DOWN FOR THE POISONMONGERS.

The ambition of the pastrycook to make his buns look "extra rich"
by colouring them with poison, might rierhaps seem "extra rich" for
its consummate coolness, did not its heartless villain- demand a
stronger term for it. But other hands than the confectioner's were
made uncleanly by the bun-making. On further test it turned out
that the chemist had a finger in the poisoned pie, and that the chrome
yellow left a black stain on his character. It proved upon analysis that—
"No chromato of lead was present at all (indeed it could not have produced such
speedy and violent effects), but that the oolounng matter was pure orpimunt, or
yellow sulphido of a' senic. The druggist when asked hy a baker for a slow poison
hud sold him one of the most deadly under a false name. Application was su**e-
quently mado for a *-amplo of thia powder. He produced a brown paper parcel of
it, loosely tied, aud scattering Irs p isonous cootonts mi all sides Having put up a
sample he wrote on it, 'Chrome yellow* (cliromate of lead) though it proved on
analysis to be yollow arsenic, and the parcel from which it was te.ken was actually
so labelled. With the agenta of life and death in the hands of such men, who among
us is safe T"
Who indeed P will be the probable echo from the reader. Where
druggists are so careless and so ignorant as this, any stroke of business
they may do may be a deathstroke, and probably the reader, more
especially if he be either nervous or dyspeptic, will also echo the sug-
gestion which he finds subjoined:—
"There is little doubt but that many of the obscure chronic and dyspeptlo com-
plaints now so prevalent are due to the systematic adulteration of articles of food
with unwholesome i>r slowly poisonous materials. This is difficult to trace, so it
generally passes unheeded, out. »heu ignorance or knavishness risks our summary
dismissal to our last account with a lozenge or a !>un, a signal examplo should be
made of the culprits. Private individuals, however, can hardly devote time and
trouble as we 1 as a considerable outlay to the grtting up a prosecution. A publio
health officrr. armed with powers for the detection and prosecution of such offenders,
is imperatively demanded in large towns."
This is the opinion of a Doctor who belongs to the Bristol School of
Chemistry, and it is an opinion with which few doctors, except quack
ones, we think would disagree. Quack doctors might say No to it,
because quack doctors mainly live by those "obscure complaints
BT to blink it as we may, there which, it is said, adulteration is so likely to produce. We may presume
is no doubt of the fact, that then that quack doctors would prevent, as far as possible the punish-
poisoning is as rife now as it ment of poisonmongers, and would be the last to sanction the appoint-
ment of detectives to eradicate such pests. We trust however that
the Government have not forgotten their lal.inity, and have no need to
be reminded that. Salus poputi est suprema lex. If they put down
poisonmotigery, they would doubtless in great measure be putting
down quack-doctoring, and would thereby do the state a double service,
killing two broods of destructives with one legal stone. Were a police
force of Poisoner-detectives set on foot, there would be far fewer tricks
of trade played than there now are; and the health of the community
would be much less endangered.
Anyhow, till some such a provision has been made, we shall keep
our sharpest eye upon purveyors of provisions. We shall look upon
confectioners as vendors of dyspepsia, aud shall regard a pastrycook
as probably a poisoner. We shall cat the plainest food wiih inward
fear and trembling, and after taking a ham sandwich we shall expect
to want a stomach-pump. We don't mind owning we had once a
relish for Bath buns, but. that has given place to terror after hearing
of these Bristol ones. Should we be ever crossed in love and desirous
to commit suicide, we might perhaps prescribe ourselves a brace of
Borgia Bath buns, just as oilier lunatics would take a brace of pistols.
But unless we went distracted and wished to blow our brains out, we
should no more dream in future of lunching off Bath buns (and more
especially if they looked "extra rich" ones) than we should of putting
our nose into a blunderbuss, and asking some kind friend to come and
pull the trigger.

The synonym we use now

a host of Browns ana
Joneses who are not less
deadly poisoners, although
their deadly work is done in
course of ordinary business,
and is not made a theme for
opera or harrowing romance.
Scarcely ever a Times passes
without bringing the dark
deeds of these poisoners to
light. For instance, here
is an account of an attempt
at wholesale boy-slaughter
which took place at Bristol
a week or two ago, and
which makes us think the
Borgias could not have been a whit more cruel than the Browns :—
"On Thursday, the 15th inBt., various persons bocamo seriously ill after eating
Bath buns purchased of a confectioner, st Rudland. Among the sufferers were six
youths, pupils at a leading school at Clifton. Within half an hour after eating the
buns they were seised with deadly nausea and other unmistakeable symptoms of
irritant poison. Em-tics having been promptly administered, the greater part of
the material was fortunately removod from the stomach before much atieorptlon
had taken place. Nevi-rth, less, tho violent syrapt/.ms lasted six or eight hours,
and one Ud, who had eaten three buns, was in some danger from collapso. Mr. May,
a publican, who bad also partaken of the buns with like effect, applitd to the
Magistrates for advice last Monday, but as he had not been poiaoued outright, they
could afford no assistance."
We seldom pin our faith upon the dicta of our Magistrates; but if it
be really true that half killing by poison is regarded as no crime in the
eyesight of the law, we think that the law clearly is afflicted with
shortsightedness, and the sooner its defect is remedied the better.
Proceeding with the poisoning, we are next informed that—

The Rifle movement is proceeding in full activity at the various

rifle the supernumerary passengers' pockets.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[January 14, 18G0.
MEETING OF SOUTHAMPTON MAINEIACS.
here was a gathering
of Teetotallers and ad-
vocates of the Maine
Law in the Town Hall
of Southampton on
Tuesday evening last
week. The chair was
occupied by the Wor-
shipful the Mayor,
Mr. F. Perkins, who
had convened the
meeting in com-
pliance with a requi-
sition of a numerous
hody of simpletons.
The magnanimity of
the Maj or in acceding
to their ridiculous
request, will be ap-
preciated by our
readers when they
are told, if they do
not know, that he is
an eminent liquor
merchant. We won-
der that the bare name
of Perkins, its asso-
ciations considered,
had not deterred them
from the attempt to
hold their abstemious
orgies under the pre-
sidency of its bearer;
but probably if Metjx
had been Mayor of
Southampton, they
would have perpe-
trated the same ab-
surd impropriety; and would not have stuck, under similar circumstances, at offering a
similar impertinence to Truman, Hanbury, or Buxton. Perhaps Vegetarianism will take
root and nourish in Southampton; for the soil which nourishes monomania in drinking is to
an equal extent favourable to the allied insanity in eating. The Southampton Vegetarians
will, in that case, perhaps, assemble to discuss their greens under the auspices of a outcher.
If there are many members of the Peace Society in the "Liverpool of the South," we shall
probably soon hear of their meeting, or proposing to meet, with Lord Clyde in the chair.
They could not, to be sure, have a better chairman, regarding him from a rational point of
view, and, in like wise, a distinguished wine-and-spirit merchant may be considered to be a
very suitable person to preside over an assembly having for its reasonable object the practice
of moderation in the use of fermented liquors.

SO MUCH EOR BUCKINGHAM
PALACE!
It seems that dry-rot, or decomposition, or
the action of the at mosphere. or the dampness
of the place, is playing sad havoc with the
facade of Buckingham Palace. The whole front-
age is threatened with a kind of architectural
small pox, that in time bids fair to indent it
with a number of small holes not unlike the
hollows we notice in Gruyere cheese. What
remedy may have been determined upon to arrest
the ravages of this fearful malady, we cannot
say • but if some able doctor, who is well skilled
in the cutaneous diseases of buildings, is not
instantly called in, the Palace will soon be as
open as a doll's house, and we shall be able to
look into the interior of all the rooms, and to see
exactly what the inmates are doing. Prince
Albert will then have every patent right of
boasting that he is the first German Prince in
this country who has ever kept open house.
As we are not advocates for the privacy of
Royalty being at all hours intruded npon by a
vulgar and staring mob of snobs, we should re-
commend some screen being temporarily thrown
up to protect the residents of this crumbling
Palace from the ocular invasion of the million,
who, not content with reading the movements
of the Court Circular in print, would be only
too happy to see them acted to the life by the
real characters themselves. We don't know
whether any new uniform has been selected for
the better equipment of Buckingham Palace, but
it is very clear that the "facings," as they say
in the Rifle Corps, have not yet been decided
upon. In every way it is desirable that a new
face should be put on this stucco abomination,
for it has been an eyesore quite long enough, and
in changing faces could not very well get a worse
set of heavy, unsightly features. From the impu-
dence of its looks, we should say it was much
better qualified to give affront than to take one.
THE SENTIMENT OF COLOUR.
French White is all very well as a water-
colour, but we must not have the Mediterranean
converted into a French Lake.
HIS PERSECUTED HOLINESS.
To Archbishop Cullen.
Most Reverend Sir,
The Holy Father has again experienced, at the hands of
wicked and perfidious men, enemies of all law, human and divine, an
act of fierce and cruel persecution, which exceeds in atrocity any out-
rage that the tyrannical Emperor Nero ever committed on the early
Popes. Oh, what sorrow and compassion must have thrilled the hearts
of all pious Catholics who read in the Times the following telegraphic
narrative of the suffering and insult inflicted on the Father of the
Faithful, as represented by one of his beloved children and servants!
THE MORTARA CASE.
"Modena, Jaw. 2.
n In consequence of a demand made by the family Mortara, who gave proofs to
the Government that the kidnappiDg of their child had been ordered by the Rev.
Fnther and Inquisitor Filetti, the latter has been arrested. Judii iat proceedings
nave been instituted against him upon tho charge of kidnapping a child.'
Oh, most reverend Sir, was Leo the Isaurian, Copronimtjs, Hun-
nkiuc, Herod, Pontius Pilate, ever guilty of so barbarous an
outrage? The Successor of St. Peter, arrested in the person of
Father Filetti. languishes in prison. An Inquisitor is arrested for
taking the child of a Jew into the maternal bosom of the Church. Oh,
most unheard-of prodigy! To what a pitch has sacrilegious audacity
arrived! What, if the reverend Father should be condemned to the
galleys P Another grief will then be added to the bitternesses which
afflict the paternal heart of his Holiness. Will not the faithful sons
of Erin unite to rescue the Sovereign Pontiff from the dungeon in
which he lies immured by proxy P
An answer will oblige your Lordship's most Obedient Slave,
WANTED, A LITTLE MORE IMPROVING.
There has been a meeting at the Manchester Town Hall for the
purpose of presenting a piece of plate to each of the seven members of
the Executive Committee of the fate Art Treasures Exhibition. Nor
would Mr. Punch say that those gentlemen did not deserve the testimo-
nials, nor does he object to the glowing eulogium the speakers passed
upon themselves, and upon Manchester, and upon the Queen, and
upon the pictures, and upon the Police. If it would have been a little
more graceful in the testimonialised parties to say a word for the gen-
tlemen—the Eggs, Scharfs, Deanes, and others—who did the work
and got up the Exhibition, while the "Executive" bowed, and
lunched, and walked about rubbing hands, and talking of the refining
influences of Art, the omission was pardonable, and folks can't remem-
ber everything.
But Mr. Bazley, M.P., took occasion to say—
"Ho hoped that the people of Manchester would henceforth command respect
from many who bad previously disbelieved in their possession of attainments that
were general among the people of Lancashire. He believed the exhibition had con-
tributed to improve the taste prevalent in the manufacturing districts."
Mr. Punch, M.P., is delighted to hear this from his brother-senator.
But it must be the taste for painting only that has been improved, not
that for music, or even for decency, if Mr. Punch may judge from
having read in a Manchester newspaper, within the last few days,
that, at a recent Concert in that city, the "improved" audience were
so enraged because Mr. Sims Reeves very properly declined to give
them twice the quantity of music they had paid for, that they raised
about as disgusting a riot as Mr. Punch has lately heard of, except at
Birmingham, where an "improved" audience committed just the same
offence on the same provocation. Do not these provincials want other
schools beside Schools of Art P

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HUNDRED TO ONE.
TO friend the Duke
or Newcastle, in the
speech which he de-
livered the other day
at Worksop on the
organisation of Rifle
Corps, made a remark
which is worthy of
serious consideration.
The noble Duke in-
structed his bearers
to observe that—
"If they only got a
company of one hundred
to start with, they would
bo the nucleus of a greater
number, who, in case they
wore required—which God
forbid—might render good
service. ■
The number of men
estimated by theDuKE
at Newcastle as sufficient for the formation of the nucleus of a Rifle Corps should be borne
in mind by all those whom its remembrance may concern; and perhaps it will be rather the
more deeply impressed upon their memory by consideration of the paradox involved in a
statement which apparently makes out that one hundred men will serve to constitute the
kernel of a regiment.

STANZAS TO A RESPECTABLE
CONVICT.
Go to penal servitude,
Faithless friend, rogue, scoundrel, thief;
Go, and o'er thy future brood,
With unpitied shame and grief.
Now, thou base, dishonest knave,
Cheat of men who trusted thee,
Ten years long thou art a slave,
Smooth Respectability 1
Pick thy oakum, wheel thy load,
Puff and blow, and sigh, and groan,—
Thou whom conscience ne'er could goad,
Pain of sense wilt now bemoan;
Rascal, would that all thy kind
Could thy sore affliction view,
Warning swindlers, base of mind,
What a villain may come to.
Toiling in a convict's dress,
Lashed to work, if labour tire,
Fear, the sight of thy distress,
In their bosoms might inspire;
As a Guy that frights the crows.
Fellow-blackguards thou would'st scare,-
All thy use is, pangs and woes,
For example s sake, to bear.
THE BLACK QUACK AND HIS "WHITE BROTHER.
The trial of M- Vbtes, who called himself the Black Doctor, and
murdered a good many unfortunate French persons who, afflicted with
cancer, sought the infallible remedy the Surinam scamp proffered, has
set Mr. Punch a-thinking what a blessed thing it is for a Quack to be
in practice in England instead of in France.
Vries has been put upon his trial, and if he had been one of the
celebrated Surinam toads instead of a quack doctor, he could not
have been more mercilessly dissected by French philosophers than lie
was by the Tribunal of Correctional Police. Here is a very small
sample of the treatment the scoundrel got:—
"He had convoked all the architect* of all nations to send in plans for a temple
of Solomon, to be eroctod in the Champs Klyaees, and had promised a prize of
2,500f. for the best. One plan had been Bent to him, and he had suspended it in
his dining-room : but it was not a good oue, and he had not paid the money. 'You
did all that,' said the President, 'in order to attract public attentiou; and to gain
that object all means appeared good to you. Thus you took the name of the Black
Doctor, though you are not what may be called black; and you wrote to the Presi-
dent of the Academy of Medicine a letter, in which you undortook to cure persons
afflicted with cancer, dysentery, and dropsy. Pray, who made you a physician T1
'I, myself. Sir,' answered the accused. 'But you represented that you wero a
physician of the University of Leyden?1 'Hippocrates had no diploma.'"
Passing over a hit of the dingy quack's blasphemy, here is another
specimen of the Court's respect for a rascal's feelings:—
"' Seventeen persons afflicted with cancer were placed in your hands, and you
undortook to cure them in six months: but at the end of two months seven were
dead?' 'Not one!' 'Dr. Vklpeau and Dr. Fauvhl affirm the contrary. The
former analysed your remedies, and found in them nothing peculiar,—nothing
that is not to be obtained everywhere. But as to your patient* in the hospital,
they are at this moment all dead, except two, and those two are dying I' 'At the
end of two months none were dead, and since then it is not I who have attended
them I' On the demand of Dr. Velpkau you wore excluded from the hospital, and
then you caused puffs on your skill to be inserted in the newspapers, and had your
portrait published. Did not this publicity bring you in money?"
With a good deal more of the same sort of mild suasion. The end
will be. that the quack, whose trial stands over, will be sentenced to a
heavy fine and a long imprisonment.
But suppose that M. Vries. instead of being a Surinam quack,
before the Parisian Correctional Police, had been practising in England.
Suppose, for instance that instead of his name being M. Vries, it had
been Ms. Hosea Habbakuk, and that he had been one of those
medical ornaments of the Hebrew race who advertise very largely,
and who are thought to proceed upon the wise and humane principle
of terrifying and plundering any timid fool as much as possible, in
order to make him set, for the future, a due value on his precious
health and money. Now, as these persons are usually "ignorant as
dirt," it is quite on the cards that Mr. Habbak.uk might have slain a
few victims in his zeal for improving them. He might—such is the
coarse brutality of the Anglo-Saxon nature—be brought before a
police Magistrate. But would there be anything of this Kind:—
"' Now, Habbakuk, you are a Jew quack, are you not' Prisoner. • Veil, I can't
say as I ain't a Jew, but quacks is matters of opinion.' 'You call yoursolf a medi-
cal man, but you have had no regular medical education.' 'Vot's the odds?'
'You advertise yourself everywhere.' 'Veil, advertisin' ain't no crime, I spose.'
'But you pretend to cure what you don't understand?' 'So does many folks.'
'You begin by telling a patient that ho is horribly ill and in awful danger, and you
extort large fees out of his terrors.' * O vot 'a tho fools of this here earth for, my
dear, if not to be plunder for the vise thorehof.' 'You artfully draw from him his
family history, and then, if he hesitates in paying you, you threaten to make
unpleasantness.' * Fools should keep their mouths shut.' 'And you don't do him
any good after all, but harm.' 'Anyhow, he's got a lesson.' 'I commit you for
trial.'"
Why, every Old Bailey barrister shudders at the mere idea. Talk
this way to a man who can pay for legal assistance! Bedlam broke
loose could not equal the noise that would break forth from the
bewigged Bulls of Bashan. The Magistrate would be simply slain by
the Power of Sound—and fury. No, poor Surinam toad,—quack, we
mean,—what would occur here would be another thing. Habbakuk
would be represented by a barrister who would watch every syllable that
was uttered,—forbid the accused party to say a word,—bully, insult,
and ridicule every witness against him, especially every lady witness,—
protest against the Magistrate's expressing the faintest opinion,—and
finally declare that there was not the least pretence for any charge
whatever against Habbakuk. Possibly the Magistrate might not be
overborne by this declaration, and might decide on the case going to
another tribunal. Then Habbakuk's barrister would say that "of
course" bail would be taken, and as instantly solvent housekeepers
would be forthcoming. The Magistrate would probably "regret to
see a gentleman of Mr. Habbakuk's station and appearance exposed
to the charge of manslaughter, but justice knew no difference between
man and man,"—and Habbakuk would drive back in his gaudy car-
riage to his smart house, and hasten to plunder as many more patients
as possible, in order to make up for the expense occasioned by his
brutal prosecutors. And when the trial came he would be acquitted
on some technical point; and though the Judge would not express the
slightest regret for the inconvenience Habbakuk had sustained, he
would not feel it his duty to the public to say. "There, you Jew quack,
you've had a squeak for it; but mind how you serve anybody else who
may be fool enough to let you rob him."
Ah! poor Surinam toaa, you should have been an English Adver-
tising Quack.
FANCIES WRITTEN BY THE FIRELIGHT.
One of the first fancies suggested by the firelight is, that everybody
fancies that he can poke the lire better than everybody else. Philoso-
phy may speculate as to what can be the cause which generates this
fancy, but it is doubtful if philosophy will ever make much progress
towards solving the moot point.
How ungrateful is man 1 The fire is decidedly the warmest friend
man has, and yet it is, perhaps the one he most delights to turn his back
upon. But use it as he may, the fire is incapable of returning his
ingratitude. One never knew the fire give one the cold shoulder.
When a cinder shoots out, many say it is a money-box, while others
think it is a coffin. The words are not so different as at first thought
they may seem to us. There are very many men who make, by over-
work at it, their money-box their coffin.
The fire makes a report when something bright comes out of it. The
same thing happens generally with the fire of wit. When brilliant
things come out, it is pretty certain there will be a report of them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE MANUALS.
ST. LUKE'S AND BEDLAM.
On Wednesday evening, last week, took place the Annual Christmas
Ball of the patients in St. Luke's Hospital. On the previous day the
Roman Catholics of London met together at the Hanover Square
Rooms, to express sympathy with the Pope, and antipathy to Lord
Palsjerston, Loud John Russell, and Louis Napoleon. The
former assembly, we are informed by the report of it in the Timet, was
characterised by the utmost good order and strict decorum. At the
latter, the language employed by the principal speakers afforded evi-
dence of violent delusions. Mr. Richard aeeley, the Chairman,
vituperated "the publisher of Punch." A letter, said to have been
written by Lord Fielding, was read, declaring that the Pope had
been driven from Rome in 1848 by the Government of Lord John
Russell, which had supplied the chiefs of the Revolution with money
at the rate of half-a-dollar a day. Another letter, attributed to Mr.
M. J. Rhodes, denounced the constitutional movement in Italy in
outrageous terms. Mr. H. J. Prendehgast delivered a long harangue,
in which he insisted not merely that "the Pope had exercised his tem-
poral power most discreetly, religiously, and humanel)," but even
that his great fault in the eyes of English Protestants was, that he
had no fault at all,"—the orator evidently having confounded the idea
I of his Holiness with that of the Immaculate Conception. Mr. Brett
I moved an inconsistent resolution, which affirmed, in a roundabout way,
the belief of Catholics in the independence of the PorE's spiritual
A STRIKE IN THE PARLOUR.
The wife of a distinguished Private in one of the Civil
Service Rifle Corps has struck for an increase of house-
keeping money; tor she says her husband comes home now
with such an enormous appetite after having been two
hours at drill, that it is utterly impossible to provide the
dinners for the same allowance that she has hitherto done.
Suppers, too, were formerly an unknown thing in her
establishment; but now, regularly three times a-week,
her lord and master complains of being so hungry before i
going to bed, that the tray has to be brought up pur-
posely for him. His consumption is full three times
greater than it. was before he became a Volunteer. It is,
therefore, under these indisputable facts,—to prove which
butchers' and bakers' bills can be brought forward in I
scores too formidable to admit of a sneer, or much less a
denial,—<-that an increase of the home estimates has been
peremptorily demanded; and we believe that matters have
reached such an alarming height in the establishment in
question, that the lady has found it necessary to make a
special appeal to her respected mother-in-law to induce
her to interfere in the matter, with a view of arbitrating
upon it, and getting it properly settled as it ought to be.
It was only yesterday, we are informed, that this poor;
unfortunate Volunteer, whose appetite is seemingly far
beyond his control, finished a leg of mutton almost by
himself; and the worst is, with the small Government'
pittance which as an underpaid Government clerk he draws,
that this is a degree of voraciousness which he can ill
afford. From the additional exercise that he has lately
been taking, his appetite has completely outgrown the
small size of his means, which at the best of times was
always a tight fit; but now shortly it will be quite impos-
sible for him, wit hout pulling in a great deal, to make both
ends meet, if he goes on much longer at the same extra-
vagant rate. What with the drilling he gets abroad, and
the drilling he gets when he goes home, his present life
will soon be too much for him; though the latter, it
must be confessed, though carried out with the greatest
severity, has not the slightest effect in diminishing the
enormous powers of demolition sharpened to an unnatural
degree by the former.
An Admiral Adrift.
We understand that Admiral Bowles (who is said to
have " resigned," but, it is believed, was in reality bowled
out) excuses his late conduct on the plea of the old
proverb that "They who play with Bowles must expect
to meet with rubbers."
The singing of a kettle in one respect resembles the
singing of a stage singer. An attempt to overdo it will be
followed by a hiss.
authority on his temporal power; and also their opinion that the one
could not be duly exercised apart from the other. The proceedings'
came to a conclusion attended with the characteristic incident thus
reported:—
"Tho meeting was subsequently addressed by Mb. Harper, who formerly held
high preferment in the Established Church, and during whiiao speech Mr. T. A.
M alone, a lecturer on chemistry and a Catholic, wbo had ventured to say the Popk
would bo freer iu Ireland than in Rome, received some very rough usage indeed at;
the hands of some violent partisans near the door. He was struck violently in tho
eye, forced from the room, and lost his hat in tho m ■' t e."
In all particulars that may be considered as indications of right
mind, the assemblage at St. Luke's had manifestly very much the
advantage of the gathering at Hanover Square. The latter appears to
have included some persons who were positively dangerous. The
whole number of people present was about 2,000. It is probable that
the institution, whose inmates exhibit so favourable a contrast by the
side of those other parties, would not hold so many patients as theso
amount to, or else the right persons would have been in the right
places if they had all taken part in the quiet ball of the night following
the day of their excited demonstration, and had stayed where they
were after it was over. As it was, they were dancing-mad. It would
be something quite in their own way, to sacrifice a little time at the
shrine, and partake for a season of tne hospitality, of St. Luke.

MURDER IN JEST.
To Mb. Sleigh, Barrislcr-at-Law.
Mb. Sleigh, Mb. Sleigh, pray mind what jokes you make in your
capacity of Advocate. It is quite true that the Mansion House is a
comic tribunal. It is equally undeniable that a squabble between two
gentlemen, named respectively Lazarus Simon Magnus and Henry
Guesalla, the latter being a member of the Stock Exchange, both of
them shareholders id the Great Eastern steamship, and the dispute
having originated from an altercation which took place at a meeting of
that body, must necessarily be an absurd affair. A snobbish, ill-
written, mis-spelt, threatening letter, which one gent, evidently of
the Hebrew persuasion, is accused of sending to another gent, pro-
bably of the same, undoubtedly constitutes a ludicrous case. The
epistle, however, which Mb. Lazarus Simon Magnus, or Simon
Magus, was charged with writing to Mr. Guedalla, contained an
oiler to fight a duel; and in allusion to this, I find you addressing the
subjoined facetious observations to the Lord Mayor :—
"The only part of the letter which I should have supposed would have excited
attention in these days of Rifle Corps and martial enthusiasm is that which offers
satisfaction, and to which I should have thought any gentleman feeling himself
insulted would have given bis perfect acquiescence, although my learned friend has
told us that duelling has been scouted from among gentlemen."
Now, Mr. Sleigh, this is a sort of fun of which I hope that you
will give us no more. To jest, in a court of justice, even though in
the Mansion House, and before the Mayor, on fear, imputed to one
gent, of fighting another gent, is mischievous waggery. It is not so
very long since two linendraper's assistants fought a duel; one of
them was killed, the survivor and the seconds were tried for murder,
convicted of manslaughter, and imprisoned for some two years. Duel-
ling accordingly lost cast e, and we nave had little or none of it since the
shop-boy was shot. "In these days," however, "of Rifle Corps and
martial enthusiasm," as you say, a revival of the practice is a not
unlikely peril. The world is not getting more intelligent or humane
than it was; brutal duels have lately taken place in France; duels
more brutal still in America.
As to the immorality and wickedness of duelling, I will not say a
word, because if I did you would laugh me to scorn, either for telling
you what you deem a truism, or for asserting principles which you
disbelieve and deride. But I would ask you to observe, that the preva-
lence of the usage of mortal combat is a dreadful nuisance to any man
who has brains in his head, and objects to have them blown out by the
hands, and at the will, of a blockhead. There was a time, when, if the
greatest fool at large, and occupying the station of a gentleman,
thought proper to give me the lie, the insult itself being contemptibly
false, I was obliged, on pain of infamy, to call him out, and allow nim a
chance of shooting me through the head, or any other part of the body
situated in front.
Fancy the plague which it would now be, to be forced to incur the
risk not merely of the loss of life, but even that of the loss of a limb,
for a cause of no more concern to you than the bark of a dog!
Observe, that the risk would be all your own; for what wise man
would shoot the fool he was compelled to challenge, and consequently
have to stand a trial for his life, and at least get found guilty of man-
slaughter, which is felony, and entails loss of goods and chattels; as
you ought to know. So, no more jokes on the subject of duelling, if
you love me; your gentle monitor,

Laurels for Laurie.
Sib Peteb is as good as ever. His mind is like a Stilton, the older

remarked, with a degree of candour that every one was charmed with,
that he "really felt half-stupid." "Persevere, my dear Sib Peteb,"

use to any one but the owner."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING WET WEATHER IN THE
COUNTRY.
BY ONE wno "looks upon the sunny side," even when it bains.
eke is no doubt that it
is unpleasant when one
goes into the country for
sake of out-door exercise,
to be shut up in the
house by a succession of
wet days; and if one hap-
pens to be somewhat of
a sporting turn of mind,
the moisture of the
weather is most trying
to one's temper. One is
blue-devil ishly apt to
come to breakfast with
black looks, when the
rain has all night long
been beating hard against
one's window, and there
seems to be no hope of
its holding up ere dinner
time. With foxes waiting
to be hunted and phea-
sants to be shot, one can't
help feeling savage when
one daily finds the glass
midway oetween " Much
rain," and "Stormy," and
inclining, if one knocks
it, to fall rather than to
rise. To the people one
is staying with the bore
is not so great, inasmuch
as they, one thinks, can take their sport at any time. But to an uncagea Cockney,
whose country visits are like angels', few and far between, it is no joke for a week
to be swamped out of one's shooting, and to find the happy hunting grounds,
of which one has been dreaming, are of no earthly use to one, from being under
water.
Nevertheless, sweet are the uses of adversity; and rightly balanced minds, when
shut up in the country, may find something more than billiards to console them.
It is surprising how a week's wet freshens up the memory, and how reviving it is
found to friendly correspondence. As one has gone out for a holiday, of course
one cannot stoop to doing literary work; however much one sighs for one's regular
employment. But one flies to pen and paper as a means of killing time, that being
the sole thing that the wet weather lets one kill; and for want of something better
to occupy one's thoughts, one thinks about responding to one's long unanswered
letters. One's most distant correspondents are startled by next post at receiving
the replies to their forgotten notes and queries; and friends one lias done favours
for, and by whom one has in consequence Deen subsequently cut, are surprised by
the receipt of a long letter of inquiry, begging them to furnish the most minute
particulars about their worldly welfare and spiritual health. Nay, to such a
pitch sometimes in this letter-writing mania promoted by wet weather, that faute
de mieux one finds oneself writing to one's wife, and inquiring if baby has yet
learnt to say "Melchisedek," and whether things in general have gone on smoothly
since one left.
Again, too, being shut up by wet weather in the country, one has leisure to
hold skeins of worsted for young ladies, and to assist in other feminine pursuits.
One learns to feed the parrot, and the bullfinch, and the lap-dog, and is entrusted
with the keep of the vivarium and fern-case, which none but female hands before
have been allowed to touch. One becomes, in fact, a sort of male maid-of-all-
work, and wins thereby, as wages, marks of feminine approval which, had one
been out hunting, one would, of course, have missed. Moreover, when one passes
a few days in a drawing-room, one obtains a clearer insight into feminine employ-
ments than a twelvemonth spent in shooting would ever have induced; and one
feels by one's experience enabled for the future to speak with some authority
upon the often mooted point, as to "what on earth those women contrive to find
to do, when—aw—fellahs are away, you know; and so, by Jove! they—aw—
can't flirt."
As to exercise, of course if there be children in the house there will be no lack
of chances for the stretching of one's limbs. When a brace of bouncing boys, of
three and five years old, mount upon one's back and say they mean one to be
"horse," one may surely make one's mind up to as stiff a bit of work as stalking
old French birds in November on clay fallows, or taking half a score of " bull-
finchers " and clearing six or seven brooks.
Add to this, that, besides one's exertions in the billiard-room, there are other
occupations to which one may betake oneself, and which have both a bodily and
mental good effect. For instance, when confined by stress of weather to the
house, one has time to make oneself not unpleasant to its mistress, and to pay her
that attention which is properly her due. It happens not infrequently that, when
they have line weather, male visitors go out directly after breakfast, and do not
: until the summons of the dinner-bell; and thut all the evening they talk
of dogs or horses, unless they fall asleep, or else slink fur-
tively to bed. Now, wet weather prevents such selfish want
of gallantry, and makes gentlemen who visit her attentive to
their hostess, if only for the cause that they have nothing
else to do.
MACAULAY IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.
January 9, 1860.
Among the men whose words and deeds
He best has taught our time to prize;
Macau lay's honoured coffin lies,
Mid hush of jarring cliques and creeds.
A shadow falls upon his grave
When morning lights the eastern
And one, when sunset splendours rain
Through the
! west window of the nave:
That by hit recent marble thrown.
Who sang of Nelson and the North,
And "England's mariners" rang forth
In music like a trumpet-tone.
This, by his earlier statue flung,
Who in the lettered reign of Anne
Stands out, serenest type of i
Best wielder of our ]
Addison, Campbell—such the t
At our Macaulay's head and i
And what companionship more meet—
Of Essayists and Lyric bards—
For him, whose almost boyish breath
The battle-ballad's clarion blew,
And thence heroic war-notes drew,
To breathe a soul through ribs of death—
When the Armada's march he sang.
Along the guarded English steep.
While leaping watch-fires lit the deep,
And village-bells defiance rang P
For him, whose later essays taught
To narrative fresh arts of grace:
Gave to old truths a novel face,
And new to crystal clearness wrought?
If with the genial English life
That in Sir Roger charms the mind,
Drawing us closer to our kind,
His brilliant pages were not rife,
Yet let us own the Art that threw
Concentred light on giant men:
Made Clive and Hastings breathe again,
And Laud and Stratford strive anew.
Filly his resting-place is given
With these great dead he loved so well.
Stand on his grave, and you may tell
The chief stars of our English heaven.
From Chaucer's glad May-morning beam,
To Spenser's planet rays that warm
Cold Allegory with a charm
Of life, seld given to Fancy's dream—
And Camden's steady light, that falls
In each dim nook of England's past,
Now on some worn inscription cast,
Now on grey tower or minster walls—
And Joiinson's, Beaumont's, changing stars,
One moment glad as Hesper's glow
With light of mirth:—to tragic woe,
Shifting, the next, like blood-red Mars—
And all the galaxy that fused
Their lesser splendours into one,
When William ceased, and Anne begun,
And state-craft writer-craft abused.
Who knew and treasured of all these
What was worth treasuring, more than he
Who to their silent company
Has last gone down, from life and ease F

MORE FANCIES BY THE FIRELIGHT.
S the fire in the fireplace won't
burn without a draught, so the
(ire of inspiration, to prevent
its dying out, needs every now
and then a draft upon a banker.
Some persons pretend tl.ey

But what they fancy to be pho-
tographs are generally all smoke.
Pokers are like critics. Use-
ful as incentives. They are of
use too as correctives; but their
uses, to do good, must be tem-
pered by good judgment. There
is the fear always of their being
used too much. As an overdose
of poker often puts a fire out,
so an overdose of criticism may
extinguish the poetio fire in its
first spark, and prevent its ever
bursting into flame.
The grate looks bright and
cheerful in the evening, when
the fire is in it; but see it the
next morning, how dead and
dull it is! So is it with the
Great. They shine brilliantly at night when the champagne fire is in
them; but when their soda's brought next morning the shine is quite
gone out of them.
When it is discovered where dead donkeys go to, perhaps a poker
may be found in the fender at a Railway station.
Finally, my son, however much tby wit may sparkle, be not over-
dazzled by it. Take warning by the writer. Fancies written in the
firelight turn out not unfrequently unfit to see the daylight.

ITS NATIVE ELEMENT.
The native element of the Great Eastern seems to be hot water, for
it has scarcely been in anything else ever iince it was first launched.
It should not cost the ship much for coals since in consequence of the
liberality of the Directors, the engineers Are provided with hot water
for nothing. The cost of this fluid at suburban tea-gardens is gene-
rally " id. per head." The outlay to tbf) company of the Great Eastern
has been somewhat above that modest figure, for the average of the
expense has been at the rate of £1 per head; but then the shareholders
should not complain, considering the large quantity that they have
received, and taking into consideration also, that there has been no
extra charge for the fun and excitement of the meetings.
Paw and Maw.
We lately lighted upon an advertisement of Maw's Feeding Bottle.
Noticing the odd name of the proprietor of this invention, we occa-
sioned a young lady, who had received a first-rate education at a
Brixton boarding-school, to remark, that a nice feeding-bottle must be
such a convenience to a baby's Maw!
THE SCOTCH PHARISEES' LAST I
The subjoined specimen of Scotch Sabbatarianism is quoted from
the Standard:—
"SABBATH DESECRATION IN SCOTLAND.
"At a Meeting of tho Edinburgh United Presbyterian Association on Tuesday, a
report was read by the Rev. W. Rbid on the subject of Sabbath Desecration. At
the outset it referred to the abatement which had taken place since 1853 of certain
forms of Sabbath desecration, noticing specially the shutting up of the public-bouses
by the Forbes Mackenzie Act. It then noticed, as ' another form of Sabbath dese-
cration which had been somewhat abatod,' the practice of burying the dead on
Sundays. During the five years terminating with 1848 tho interments on Sunday
in Warriston Cemetery were 20 70 per cent, oi the whole, while during the five
years just terminated they have been only 16*86 percent. 'This decrease,' continued
the report, 'while gratifying, is far from being what is desirable. While it cannot
be denied that there are frequent instances in which the nature of the disease
causing death, and the limited accommodation of the dwellings in which death takes
place, may demand burial, even on the Sabbath, it is evident that the practice
extends far beyond the limits of this necessity. The reasons which sustain the
practice are doubtless the convenience of friends and relatives—in some instances,
it is feared, the pride of securing a large attendance—white the solemnity of the duty
commended itself to many as quite in accordance with Sabbath-day observance. It
has been suggested that did ministers decline attending funerals on the Sabbath,
much would be done to abate the cviL"
So, according to these Scottish wearers of the broad phylactery, it is
not lawful to bury the dead on Sundays. Perhaps they would also
object to healing the sick. What day of the week was it when the
Children in the Wood died F If on the first, which the Scotch edition
of the Fourth Commandment calls the "Sabbath," how would the
United Presbyterians of Edinburgh have served the little warbler in
the red waistcoat, the pious bird that so—
"painfully
Did cover them with leaves "?
No doubt thev would have stoned Cock Robin. For the Christian
service which he rendered the bodies of the innocents on the Sunday,
they would unquestionably have pelted him to death on the following
Monday morning. The solemnity of the act would not have commended
itself to them as by any means in accordance with Sabbath-day ob-
servance, and Jack of Geneva would have btoken Robin's bones, as
surely as benevolent Calvin before him burned Sekvetus.
Is there a pin to choose between Jack and Lord Peter P If Jack
had been ruler of Rome and the Legations, would he not as effectually
have made them too hot to hold him as has that big brother of his who
sits upon seven hills in three hats, and wearing petticoats and white
satin shoes f
Among the stupid fanatics, or hypocrites, who met to hear the
shocking nonsense above quoted, there were, however, two respectable
Divines. The Rev. Mr. Cooper, of Fala, protested that he could not
warn his people against the practice of Sunday burial as a desecration
of the Sabbath. And—
"The Rev. W. Rennib, of Dalkeith, could not subscribe to thst portion of the
report referring to Sunday funerals. He did not tee why they should denounco as
wrong Sunday funerals. He was not aware of any passage in Scripture in which
this point was advanced, nor was he aware that the Jews were debarred from
burying their dead on tho Sabbath-day. At the same time, he was desirous that
the funorais on Sundays should be as few as possible. The report stated that the
pride of having a large company to attend tho funeral hod to do with the matter.
Now this was a very uncharitablo view of it. as the Sunday was often the only day
poor people could get for the funeral. He did not Bee how a burial on the Lord's
Day was a desecration. People died on the Lord's Day as well as on any other day
of the week, and he did not see any impropriety or incongruity in a funeral on the
Sabbath-day."
The foregoing rebuke to the dense and blind bigotry of the speaker's
Calvinistic associates is remarkable not only for wisdom, but also for
wit—uncommon qualities both of them, the former equally with the
latter, on the part of the Sabbatarian professors of the Kirk. Mr.
Rennie neatly remarked, that "he was desirous that the funerals on
Sundays should be as few as possible." Capital, reverend and pleasant
Rennie! Funerals on Sundays as few as possible? To be sure, and
as few. also, as possible on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thurs-
days, Fridays, and Saturdays. Bravo, Rennie!
"Beweigh this Justice."
One Adam Valance, a Catholic, of somewhere in Limerick, has
been pounced upon by the priests, and handed to the law, and sent to
prison. His offence was, that he went about and "under false pre-
tences" collected the sum of one and ninepence, which he alleged was
to be applied in aid of the Pope. Well, if it were shown that "the
offending Adam" meant to confiscate that eleemosynary twenty-one
pennies to his own use, we suppose that his punishment was just. But
this should be clear, for otherwise he may be as innocent as Antoneuj.
or Isabella Segunda. For how, in the name of all truth and
humanity, can anybody obtain a single penny of charity for Pope
Perugia,—except under false pretences P

THE DRAFT THAT CHEERS HIS HOLINESS.
The Rev. George Montgomery, a gentleman who lately went
over from Canterbury to Rome, has written to the Nation newspaper
a letter intended to remove a little doubt which appears to have
occurred to the delicate consciences of some of the more verdant of the
faithful natives of jolly green Erin. The gentle scruple is hereinunder
stated:—
"Sir,—There are, I have heard, many good Catholics who are of opinion that they
would not be aoting agreeably to the v. ish of the Pope if they were to make him an
ofloring.of money. I may be allowed to do something towards setting at reBt this
question—whether we ought or ougnt not to send money to tho Pope—by making
an extract from the letter which I have received from tho venerated ecclesiastic at
Rome to whose care I had committed the address to his Holiness, and tho little
offering made by tho people of this place."
Conceive the innocence which could entertain the question, whether
the Pope would object to an offering of money. Try him! Such
would be the exclamation of the least wide-awake mortal to whom any
uncertainty on that, ptjint was suggested. The experiment was per-
formed by the Rev. Mr. Montgomery, with the satisfactory result
thus described;—
111 duly received your osteemed letter, with the address and accompanying draft
for £10. the oblation of your good congregation to our Holy Father, Pius IX
Agreeably to your request, I Bhall have the address at once translated and'duly pre-
sented: but in the meantime (to gain time) I made out a summary of it in lUlian,
and at once presented it to the Cardinal Secretary of State, H. E. C. Antonelli,
with the enclosed amount, who at once laid it before his Holiness, who wax greatly
consoled by this act of filial devotion of his faithful children of the mission of
Wednesbtu-y."
No doubt his Holiness was greatly consoled by the receipt of £10,
accompanied by an address which probably tended to intimate that
there was more money where that came from. Such sterling conso-
lation under the inevitable afflictions of this life is acceptable to
almost anybody; by most people it is regarded as the only true solace
which can be administered to real distress. The Pope is very likely
hard up; but even if he were ever so flush, his Holiness, in common
with all mankind, would be safe to know what to do with a £10 note,
if sent to him. Whatever may be the result of Congress, or the policy
of Louis Napoleon, the Holy Father will doubtless continue open to
subscriptions to any amount, whilst the smallest contributions will be
sure to be thankfully received. Let not the bashful Irishman, there-
fore, be ashamed to offer his mite to the common Father of t he Faithful,
who will be very glad of it, and whom it will help to afford a more
respectable maintenance than tribute extorted from involuntary
subjects.
ALBERT SMITH'S "PIGEON."
Between the repulse at Peiho and the illness of Albert Smith,
Chinese affairs have nut been on a satisfactory footing of late. It is
therefore highly gratifying to know, that our French ally has actually
sent off his General to the East, and that our English entertainer has
re-appeared in Piccadilly. We hope t hat it is not uuaffectionate to say
so, but with certain Crimean recollections strong upon us, we are
rather inclined to believe that the new Chinese campaign will be
carried on with most loyalty by General Albekt. At all events we
are certain he will not bring it to a conclusion wit hout due considera-
tion for his allies, and that he will give them all due recognition of
their presence, and of their zeal in taking places—a trifling attention
to facts which is occasionally pretermit ted over the water. Seriatim,
as Viscount Williams says, we deplored, in company with the Queen,
and in common with the public, the affliction which interrupted Mr.
Albert Smith's entertainment, and are exceedingly happy to "depend"
upon a French General (on this occasion only) a congratulation to our
pleasant-faced, pleasant-tongued lecturer, upon his resuming his
Nights with the Pigtails. In the words of Confucius (whom we
never read, and have not. the least intention of readiug) "May our
Egyptian Fisher always have a good Haul."

SADDLING THE RIGHT HORSE.
WniLB the hunting Season lasts sub-editors of Country newspapers
lay their scissors eagerly on anecdotes of horseflesh, and snip out for
their readers as many equine tales as they have vacant corners for.
Here is one, for instance, which was copied lately in the Herefordshire
Timet, and which doubtless interested readers in that district much
more than the questions, Will there be a Congress? and if so, Who
will go to it?
"Eccentricity or rn» House.—In 1806, during the campaign of Auaterlltz, a
Piedmonteso officer possessed a beautiful and in other respects a most serviceable
mare, but which one peculiarity rendered at times exceedingly dangerous for the
saddle ; she had a decided aversion to paper, which she immediately recognised the
moment she saw it; and even in the dark, if one or two leaves wore rubbed together,
the effect produced by the sight or Bound of it was so prompt and so violent, that
in many cases see unhorsed her rider; and in one case, his foot being entangled in
the stirrup, she dragged him a considerable way over a stony road. In other
respects this mare had not the slightest fear of objects that would terrify most
horses. She regarded not the music of the band, the whistling of the balls, the
roaring of the canuon, the fire of the bivouacs, or the glittering of arms. The
confusion and noise of an engagement made no impression upon her; the sight of
no other white object affected her; no other sound was regarded; the view or the
rustling of paper alone roused her to madness. All possible means were employed
to cure her of this extraordinary aberration, but without success; and her master
was at length compelled to soil her, as his life was in continual danger."
Of course we no more doubt the truth of this narrative than we do
that of the tale about the horse of Baron Munchausen, which we are
told was cut in two by the fall of a portcullis, and was sewed up with
some laurel twigs, which grew into an arbour, under shade of which
the Baron could sit in pleasant coolness in the hottest of his fights.
To us the only doubt that hangs upon this horse-tale is whether or no
the story is not meant to be an allegory. From the statement that the
animal showed so "decided an aversion to paper" we can't help
fancying that the creature which is said to have been a horse must in
true reality, have been a printer's hack.
Succour for Scotchmen.
I? a Scotchman were between Scylla and Charybdis, and puzzled
as to which he should give the preference, would not his national
instinct prompt him at once to take the Siller? and, when once he had
f[ot his hand fairly upon it, we do not think he would very quickly
cave it again.
BEARS AND LYONS.
Mb. Punch has been very much excited by reading in a Lyons
journal that the authorities of that city have devised a new method of
allaying the impertinence of the Cabman. The city of weavers has
woven, for that enemy of mankind, and chiefly womankind, a net, from
whose meshes he cannot easily escape.
In London, as most people know, we have a cab-law, which works
pretty well for able-bodied and strong-nerved Fares who have plenty
of time on their hands. If you have complaint against a driver, and
you take his number, and find out the right Magistrate before whom to
bring him, and take out a summons, and attend on ever so many
adjournments, and bring your witnesses, and resist the abject impor-
tunities which the ruffian, driven to bay, makes for forgiveness, on
account of his wives and children, you may at last get him slightly
fined and mildly rebuked. But if you don t care about doing all this,
if your time is valuable, if you are an unprotected lady, or indeed any
lady without most admirable firmness, or if you fail on any of the
requisite points, the scoundrel has his triumph,—he extorts more than
his fare, and has the additional pleasure of insulting you. And on the
dozen chances in his favour the Cabman builds, and in eleven cases
out of twelve is the victor.
Moreover, there is a great deal that a Cabman can do that, though it
is particularly offensive to his Fare, does not bring him within the mild
embrace of the law. He may grumble hugely, though he knows he
has been overpaid. He may abstain from actual insolence, but keep
up a long remonstrance that is nearly as objectionable. He may say
that he would not have taken you had be known he was to have only
his bare fare, and that the servant who hailed him for you " said you
was good pay." He may enlarge upon the wetness of the night, or
the season of the year, or your being apparently out for a holiday, or a
dozen things that have nothing to do with the question, and which—
though when they are addressed to a resolute English citizen merely
produce a "Well, what then P" or the amplest permission to the
would-be extortioner to take the chance of getting the late Don
Giovanni as a fare—are pesterous to the quiet, and to women, and
usually produce the effect desired, namely, robbery. Yet no Magis-
trate will notice this, if the offender does not "demand" more thanliis
fare, or is not what is called "insolent"—that is. one who uses
language no decent person should hear. So, practically, we are in the
Cabman's power.
But at Lyons, it appears, French tact has encountered him with
another weapon. In every cab is placed a little letter-pocket. And
in every letter-pocket is a little printed form of letter. And the letter
is to this effect:—
"This Cab, number 1750, was hired on
day, the of , at o'clock,
By
Mrs. Blank, Blank, who resides at
(Residence in full)
And who makes the following complaint against the Driver
(State your Grievance.)
You art requested to fill up this form, \f there be rtason, and to drop it, unpaid,
into any letter-box."
It is addressed to the Superintendent of Police Traffic.
Thus, you observe, O Cabman, all the impediments on which
you rely are removed. Your power to annoy ceases as the door
closes on you, and the law's power to annoy begins. The letter is
examined by a competent person, and if he finds the complaint really
frivolous or unjust (and some complaints are so, even in England)
there is an end. But if not, orders are passed to the policeman on
duty in the complainant's street,, and he ascertains whether all is correct,
and the accuser be a respectable person. If so, there comes a little
inquiry after you, and perhaps you get a caution—perhaps, if an offence
be previously registered against you, a stern lecture—perhaps, too, a
little punishment, or a good deal. Anyhow, the knowledge that you
can be infallibly got at, at once, must have a marvellous effect in keep-
ing you in order—and Mr. Punch submits to Sir Richard Matne
whether some adaptation of the Lyons system might not be advan-
tageously introduced in rescue of the London Cabman's Victims.
Sweets to the Sweet.
"Pray, can you tell me, my dear Mr. Jenkins," asked with
admiring eyes a very pretty young lady, "How is sugar refined P"
"When a lady gives it to you, Madam," was the happy reply of the
great artist who grinds the fashionable organ every day.
Strange Inconsistency.—Those people, who rail because so many
foreigners fill high appointments in England, forget that they them-
selves are continually calling (hem over.

BUCHANAN ON HUMAN STOCK.

RESIDENT BUCHANAN
is a grave statesman.
Gravity is a quality
peculiarly American,
the most preposte-
rous anecdotes about
snakes and spirits are
related by citizens of
the United States with
a composure of face
that is more wonder-
ful than the anecdotes.
But, for profound se-
riousness of statement,
is there anything out-
rageous in even Ameri-
can romance to match
the subjoined para-
graph in the Presi-
dent's Message to
Congress ?—
striking proof
i» of justice
•' It in n atrik
of the
which is inherent In our
people that tiio property
in slaves has never been
d'Blurbed, to my know-
ledge, in uny of the terri-
tories. Kvun throughout
the bite troubles in Kansas
thero has not been any
attempt, as I am credibly
informed, to interfere, in a
single instance, with tho
right of the nvister. Had
any such attempt been
made, the judiciary would
doubtless tiavo afforded an*
ad« qu*to remedy Should
they fail to do this here-
after, it wid then be lime
enough to strengthen their
hands by further legislation. Had it been decided that either Congress or tho territorial Legislature possess
the power to annul or impair the right to property in slaves, tho evil would be intolerable."
Mb. Buchanan talks about property in slaves with the calm assurance of a moral philo-
sopher; just as if he had not the least idea that the title to such property had ever been
disputed. He speaks of the tight to that sort of property as coolly and confidently as if
he really believed that such right was something distinct from might. Yet, in a subsequent
part of his Message, he condemns the Slave Trade. What objection is there to the Slave
Trade, if it is possible to acquire a right of pro-
perty in slaves P If slaves are property, how do
they differ from buffaloes in a commercial sense,
and in what respect is the Slave Trade worse
than the buffalo trade?
That Americans are in a fix with respect to
Slavery—the evil legacy of ancestors—that im-
mediate abolition of that vicious institution is
impracticable, and that its present maintenance
is a deplorable necessity, are things that one
endowed with a real sense of justice may be con-
ceived capable of saying with a grave face. But
to talk of the right of property in Slaves, as
though under a solemn conviction of its moral
existence, is surely possible only to those who
are inspired with that peculiar sentiment which
Mr, Buchanan happily describes as "the sense
of justice which is inherent in our people."
Most Indecorous.
The very rudest thing we ever heard of, as
directed against a member of the respected aris-
tocracy, was launched by the titled chairman
at the Marjlebone Rifle Meeting last week, lie
said that, there ought to be no distinction on
account of the different social rank of the Volun-
teers." This was all right. But he went on
to say, that at the time of the Chartist disturb-
ances, "the Duke of Hamilton was between
a footman and a chimney-sweep." We believe
that his Grace has since abandoned both pro-
fessions.
What is Twaddle?
This question- was asked in a police case that
arose out of a stock-broker's squabble. The
person interrogated, though properly qualified to
answer, for lie was an Old Bailey barrister of
great experience, declined to give the informa-
tion demanded, but quietly continued his speech.
Perhaps it was the best definition that he could

THE RIGHT COLOUR TOR A RIFLE CORPS.
"Friend Punch, "Broadbrim Villa, Bromptoii.
"I do not often write unto the Newspapers, inasmuch as it
costs time (which, as thou know'st is money), to say nothing of the
paper, pens and postage-stamps one ependeth on it. But I feel inclined
to say a few words at this present, on the subject of the colours to be
chosen for our Riflemen: and I say them unto thee rather than unto
the Star (which paper I, till lately, have paid my daily penny for),
inasmuch as thou art truly the organ of the movement, and anything
1 hou printest on the subject of our Rifle Corps will assuredly be read
by all who are enrolled in them.
"Much debating there hath been, in print as well as out of it, as to
what colour is fittest for the dress of Volunteers, and anent the whys
and wherefores such should be adopted. I will not weary thec by
tedious recital of the argnments.nor mention how each corps, with
that independent spirit for which Britons are so famed, hath elected to
abide by its own choice of its own colours, without paying any heed to
what its neighbours wear or think. Nor need I remind thee how the
Government hath, with its usual alacrity, stepped in when just too
late with its advice upon the subject; and now that almost all the
uniforms are ordered, hath decided of what cloth they ought to have
been cut. All I wish to do is to bid all those who own themselves
disgusted with their uniform (and I am told their name is nearer
Legion than thou'd'st guess) instead of giving up their drill, as they
are threatening to do, because forsooth green doesn't, quite suit their
complexion, or they fancy that their figure isn't well set off by grey,
to bid all these, disgusted ones enrol themselves at once in a corps
whieh I am raising, wherein the colour of the uniform shall be uni-
formly drab. Drab verily, I think, is the best colour for our Riflemen;
inasmuch as if it be not 'flashy' or 'flare up'(I use the terms which
Slang maketh current in our language, that I may make my meaning
clearer to the youths whom I address), it at least hath the advantage
of being inconspicuous, and of presenting a bad mark to any enemy
who aims at it. Moreover, it may truly be regarded as symbolical,
when worn by Riflemen who arm as ours do, not in menace but in
simple self-defence. A Rifle Club so formed is a tiuly Friends'
Society, formed for keeping friends with all who fear it as a foe; and
by adopting for its dress the colour which the Friends' Society hath
chosen, it shows its mission plainly as the noses on its front.
"Of course it would be easy to enlarge on these advantages, and
t.liow that drab not merely wears well, but is cheaply to be cleaned by
simply sending it to the wash; but, I have said enough, 1 think, to
n commend it, and I now confidently look for an influx of recruits.
Meanwhile, I would exhort thee to continue ever zealous in the cause
thou hast supported, and for all the baleful light the Star may strive
to shed on it, we shall see the movement flourish, and the country safe
at peace.
"In which belief, believe me to remain, your constant reader,
"Boanerges Broadbrim."
"P.S. Hath our friend Bright joined a Volunteer Corps yet? He
hath shown himself well skilled as a political sharpshooter, and he
hath a strangely bellicose propensity for one who claiineth to be writ
of as a man of peace."

A WELCOME TO WINTER.
BY A TOET WHO BELONGS TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.
Hail, Winter! Hail, and snow, and rain!
Send forth thy storms o'er eartli again:
Come frost and fog! Come slush and sleet!
That he who walks may get wet feet.
Blow, wintry winds! Blow cold and keen,
And let no warming; sun be seen;
So that, despite their thickest coats,
Whoe'er go out may get sore throats.
Inclement time! the chills prepare
To which weak human flesh is heir:
Let muggy mist, and noxious damp,
Breed ague, asthma, cough, and cramp.
Rude Boreas, cease not to blow,
And lay the halest mortals low:
Bite 'em, and spite 'em, pinch 'em, friz 'em,
And rack their limbs with rheumatism!
Bronchitis, thy dread darts prepare,
And Influenza fill the air:
An evil wind still bloweth good,
For fevers are to doctors food.
Sciatica, tic-doloureux,
With jour worst terrors man pursue;
Long sickness lengtheneth our bills,
We live by what our neighbours kills.
So, Winter, hail! and snow! and freeze!
And by foul weather swell our fees:
The heavy head, the light catarrh,
To doctors meat and raiment are.
THE POPE IN A FIX.
matrimony by imposing upon celibacy a duty which they, doubtless,
would wish to be rendered prohibitive. Their proposal to create a
demand for wives by an artificial stimulant is not more absurd than
the mercantile protectionism of their countrymen.
How different, and how much more enlightened, is the conduct of
our own young women, and how much more happy are its results!
English girls, whose fathers arc the constant readers of a Press which
devotes itself to the advocacy of sound commercial doctrines, well
know that a demand, whether for goods and chattels or for hearts and
hands, can only be maintained by a satisfactory supply. They know
that if an article is unsaleable because it is inferior, no legislative inter-
ference will avail to promote its purchase. Accordingly they devote
all their energies to that self-cultivation which enables them to offer an
attractive commodity. Their davs are devoted, partly to storing their
minds with useful knowledge, anil acquiring domestic arts and pleasing
accomplishments; partly to bodily exercise, with a view to the im-
provement of their figures, and the enrichment of their cheeks with a
healthy roseate bloom.
Not only do the young women of England, high and low, excel those
of France in the knowledge and practice of that species of economy
which is called political, but. also in personal frugality and thrift. So
that their moderation, in attire especially, is known to all men; and
the consequence is, that they are eagerly inquired for, and experience
no difficulty whatever in disposing of themselves to the best advantage.
Whilst the French sorts are flit, they are buoyant; whereas the foreign
descriptious are heavy, natives are brisk and lively; and when, in
Paris, blondes and brunettes arc alike depressed, in London they are
both looking up. Thus the catching daughters of England are enabled
to provide for themselves off their own hooks, and are not driven to
stoop to the clumsy and humiliating expedient of begging Parliament
to procure them unwilling husbands by the imposition of a bachelor-
tax.
The question What arc we to do with him? is a query which
suggests itself to all reflecting minds when they begin to think of the
posiiion of the Pope. His Holiness just now is somewhat in the place
of the dog upon the race-course. Everybody hoots at him as being in
the way, and nobody will stretch a hand to help him out of it. And so
he runs along with his tail between bis legs, and gets considerably
more kicks than kind wishes in his progress.
Notwithstanding the assertion made by Hanover Square Meeting-
men, that the Pore is most "discreet, religious, and humane," and
that "his great fault in the eyes of English Protestants is, that he in
fact has no fault at all," the world at large apparently does not seem
to see it. Faultless though he be in the eyes of spouting fanatics,
those with better eyesight are blind to his good points, and he is in
their view by no means quite infallible. Distance lends proverbially
enchantment to the view, and what to fools in England has the look of
being faultless, to persons nearer Rome appears something very dif-1
ferent. The Roinagnese have small affection for the Papal rule, and
the people of Perugia have bitter cause to hate it. In fact, the closer
the inspection, the more spots are discoverable in the Pap.il Sun: and
the nearer people live to him the more they wish |to see the Holy
Father farther.
Meanwhile, the question still remains, What is to be done with him?
Excepting the few fools and fanatics aforesaid, everybody feels con-
vinced that the Pope is in the way, and that soon or late he must be
shoved aside or shelved, or somehow else got rid of. Between the two
stools of his temporal and spiritual authority, it seems to be decided
that he must come to the ground. It may be difficult to run so old a
fox to earth, but ere long we fancy the feat will be accomplished.

FRENCH AND ENGLISH MARRIAGE-MARKET, j
Lovely woman appears to be a drug in the Parisian marriage-
market. Young lions nave been for some time shy of taking lionesses
to wife; and according to the Salut Public—
"A petition Addressed to the Senate is now being signed by the female operatives
in this city, in which tho petitioners pray that all men who attain the age of forty
without marrying may be compelled to pay a tax as unproductive mombers of
•ociety."
The female operatives of Paris can hardly be expected to have the
least idea of political economy; for, if they had any, they would be con-
siderably wiser, not only than the males of their class, but than the
vast majority of Frenchmen; French statesmen inclusive. It is, there-
fore, natural that they should request the legislature to encourage
AN IRISH ANGEL.
At Dr. Cullbn's late Dublin meeting in aid of despotism in Central
Italy, Mb. Alderman Reynolds, who had been hissed and hooted
for uttering some expressions of loyalty to the Queen, said, in depre-
cation of the traitorous ire which he had provoked,—
"They were all detcrminod to go as far as they legitimately could to sustain tho
authority of the Pope, and they would not allow a feather of his wing to be touched."
What sort of bird is the Pope ?—was the question that arose on the
perusal of the foregoing declaration. It remained unsolved until the
appearance of the Holy Father's allocution to General Goyon,
wherein his Holiness winds up a benediction by the undignified vitu-
peration of a pamphlet. As soon as that came out everybody saw that
the Pope is a goose.

CRINOLINE FOR CRIMINALS.
Among the million objections to the nse of the wide petticoats not
I lie least well-founded is the fact, that they are used for purposes of
shoplifting. This has many times been proved at the bar of the police
courts, and we wonder that more notice has not been attracted to it.
For ourselves, the fact is so impressed upon our mind, that when we
ever come in contact with a Crinoline which seems more than usually
wide, we immediately put down the wearer as a pickpocket, and prepare
ourselves at once to see her taken up. Viewing Crinoline, indeed, as
an incentive to bad conduct, we forbid our wife and daughters to wear
it when out shopping, for fear that it may tempt them to commit some
act of theft. A wide petticoat is so convenient a hiding-place for
slowing away almost any amount of stolen goods, that we cannot be
surprised at finding it so used, and for the mere sake of keeping them
from roguery, the fewer women have it at their fingers' ends theoetter.
Some ladies have a monomania for thievery, and when they go on a
day's shopping can hardly keep their hands off what does not belong to
them. Having a commodious receptacle in reach, wherein they may
deposit whatever they may sack, they are naturally tempted to indulge
in their propensity, by the chances being lessened that they will be
found out.
As an instance of how largely the large petticoats are used in acts of
petty larceny, we may mention a small fact which has come within our
knowledge, and which it may be to the interest of shopkeepers to know.
Concealed oeneath the skirts of a fashionably dressed female were, the
other day, discovered by a vigilant detective the following choice proofs
of her propensity to plunder; vit., twenty-three shawls, eleven dozen
handkerchiefs, sixteen pairs of boots (fifteen of them made up with
the military heel), a case of eau-de-Cologne, a ditto of black hair-dye,
thirty pairs of stays, twenty-six chemises, five dozen cambric hand-
kerchiefs, and eleven ditto silk, nineteen muslin collars and four-and-
forty crochet ones, a dressing-case, five hair brushes (three of them
made with tortoiseshell and two with ivory gilt backs), a pairof curling
irons, eight bonnets without trimmings and nine-and-twenty with them,
a hundred rolls of ribbon, half a hundred weight of worsted, ten dozen
white kid-gloves and twenty dozen coloured ones, forty bails of cotton,
nine-and-ninety skeins of silk, a gridiron, two coal-scuttles, three
packets of ham sandwiches, twenty-five mince-pies, half a leg of
mutton, six boxes of French plums, ten ditto of bonbons, nine pith de
foie prat, a dozen cakes of chocolate and nine of portable hare soup,
a warming-pan, five bracelets, a brace of large brass birdcages, sixteen
bowls of gold fish, half a score of lapdogs, fourteen dozen lever
wa'clies, and an eight-dav kitchen clock.
After this discovery, who will venture to deny that Crinoline with
shoplifters is comparable to charity, inasmuch as it may cover a
multitude of sins.
What Sparkle!
Mr, Punch surpasses himself—like Mrs. Oldfield, "outdoes
former outdoings" this week. A poetic friend of his, remarking that
he wished to grow a beard, but found that it came up rather grey, was
asked by Mr. P. "Did you never read Manfred?" The poet looked
indignant at the implied doubt. "Then what does Btron say is the
whole moral and purpose of that poem f" The poet did not remember
(poets never remember anything except castigations which they have
justly received), and Mr. Punch finished him off:
"Old man, 'tis not so difficult to dye."
Phrenology Right for Once.
A Phrenologist has been examining the Queen's head, and says
that he finds the bump of adhesiveness was sadly deficient, if it existed
there at all. In justice, however, to this gentleman, we must state,
that the Queen's head under examination was a Postage-Stamp.

MARK, WOODCOCK!
Just as our friend CraCkshot gets into the very thickest of At shooting, he hears a cry
of " Cock/" and his excited fancy flit the air icith "Long beaks."
A PILL FOE THE POPE.
Doctor Louis Napoleon has prescribed a bitter pill
for his Holiness the Pope. Saith the Doctor: "Your
Holiness has been for a long period in a very disturbed
state. Your constitution has in fact been thoroughly upset.
Something you have taken has plainly disagreed with you,
and irritation and uneasiness have been naturally produced.
Your symptoms show an absence of quiet and repose, with-
out which we can none of us expect to be in health. I do
not wish to frighten you, but there is no doubt that your
system has been shaken, and you are altogether in a very
weakened state. Clearly something must be done for
your relief and restoration, or there is no saying what
your Holiness may suffer.
"Far be it from me to make your Holiness feel nervous,
but unless something be done Involution must ensue, ana
ere long Dissolution will stare you in the face. However,
there is time as yet to save your Holiness, if your Holiness
will act on the advice which I will give you. I have
devoted much disinterested attention to your case, and am
thoroughly acquainted with its diagnosis. Let me then
prescribe for you, free gratis and for nothing: there is no
other state physician so well qualified to do so. What
your Holiness requires is a state of more repose, and to
ensure yourself tranquillity, your Holiness has clearly but
one course to pursue. This simply is, to take the mild form
of emetic which I venture to prescribe, and to throw up
the things which so long have been disturbing you; I
mean, to speak more plainly, your now revolted provinces.
The course may be a painful one, but it is flobson's
choice. In point of fact, I really see no other left for you.
That it will do you good, I entertain no doubt, indeed I
quite believe that it will set you ou your legs again."
This is certainly a somewhat bitter pill to take; but
make wry faces as he may, his Holiness will clearly have
to gulp it down.
Materials for History.
The report that Ma. Cox, whose accuracy was put
to the test in the little matter of Wat Tyler, was to com-
plete Lord Macaulay's History of England, is at least
premature, though it certainly is a fact; that is to say, like
all the facts of that honourable gentleman in
with historical matters, it is a pure fiction.
POLITICS AND PETTICOATS.
"My Dear Mb. Punch, "Cato Cottage, Clapham.
"You so very often ridicule us poor weak women, and more
especially the stronger-minded of the sex, that I declare I'm half
afraid of writing to you seriously, for fear you '11 print my letter for
the sake of making fun of me, and set some of your young men to cut
it up and sneer at it, althougn of course you know that it's written to
you privately, and never was intended for a printed composition. How-
ever, I must write, whatever mean advantage you may take of my so
doing. I can't let that dear duck and darling of an Empress be
laughed at by you men for her Crinoline absurdities, as you are pleased
to term them, without calling your attention to a most convincing
proof that she devotes herself to far more serious pursuits, and is a
great stalesieoman as well as a good dresser. If you doubt me, read
this passage from the Illustrated News, where it recently appeared
with the account of a new bonnet, ana other highly interesting and
most important French intelligence;—
"The Express Euobnie has assisted fur the last few days at the Council of Minis-
ters presided over by the Emperob."
"There now, Mr. Punch, what say you to that, Sir! Only think,
that sweet Eugenie assisting at a Council, not of milliners ana
bonnet-makers, but of veritable councillors and ministers of state.
'Assisting,' you observe, Sir! It was not merely her presence, but
assistance that they wanted. Although the Emperor presided, these
great statesmen could not possibly get on without the Empress.
Sages as they were, they found themselves in need of her superior
sagacity. Even her husband, you perceive, Sir, ranked in their eyes of
less consequence. He simply was their president, and for form's sake
I dare say. took the first seat at their table. But by rights. I think
that Eugenie ought clearly to have sat there, for it is plainly stated
that she was of assistance to them, whereas nothing of the kind is even
hinted of the Emperor, and for all that one is told, I believe they
would have got on just as well without him.
"At any rate, T trust, Sir, that with this convincing proof of how
that dear delightful duck of an Empress spends her time, you will in
future give her credit for doing something more than trying on new
dresses, and deciding what dimensions shall be considered fashionable.
Now that you have heard of her 'assisting' at State Councils, you
will call her something more than Empress of the Fashions, and
believe that she has something else to occupy her mind than decreeing
what costumes are to be worn at Court, and whether the new suits
which visitors must bring with them are to be one dozen or six dozen
per diem.
"I would not encroach, Sir, on your valuable space, but I cannot
help just saying, that it would in my opinion be a good thing for the
country, if our Ministers would take example by the French, and
summon in a woman to assist them in the Council-Chamber. Her
Majesty I know is occasionally present, and when they've made a
bungle (which of course they're always doing), she most graciously
and kindly lends her aid to nelp them out of it. But I consider it
would be of great advantage to the Government if the better halves of
Ministers were regularly present, and assisted at all sittings of their
lesser moieties. You men fancy that we women have minds only fit to
think about composing a new dress, or ordering a dinner; but if you
only knew us better, you would find we've souls far, far above mere
Crinoline and cookery, and could come out as extensively in politics
as petticoats.
At least so thinks one whose name until, to aid him in his councils,
some stupid husband changes it, is
"Xantippe Bose Sophia Sophonisba Smith."
"P.S. That darling, Mr. Boebuck, I remember, once confessed
that he felt perfectly convinced that if Woman had her rights she ought
to have a Vote. If I were either of the Ladies Palmerston or
Punch, I would not let my husband rest till he had promised he would
get a law made that should give her one.
"P.P.S. Do you know—I ask in confidence: is Mr. Boebuck mar-
ried P If not, will you tell me; has he got red hair f and would you call
his nose a classically chiselled one P"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

VOLUNTEERS AND VETERANS.
K,—1 say, Punch,
my boy, I wish
you *d just pitch
into the old pipe-
clay chaps a bit for
the way in which
they talk and write
about us Riflemen.
They seem to fancy
all we mean is just
to play at being
soldiers, and that
when the _ work
comes we intend
to cut it. Their
minds are so jog-
trotty, they can t
keep pace with the
Times, and the rifle
movement clearly
is something quite
ahead of them. I
believe they think
the thing a sort of
amateur theatri-
cals, and imagine
that we drill for
the mere sake of
the dress. They've
a notion that we
like to come out
spiffy In our uni-
forms, and think
that our bull prac-
tice is just for
fancy-ball work.
And then they drop
out hints that even
if it's proved that we've the mind to fight, it will certainly turn out
that we have not the muscles for it. How can your young fellows
who never have camped out, or had anything to harden them, be fit
to go a-field, and rough it like your 'regulars P' By Jove, Sir!
Why they'd catch their deaths of cold in the first drizzle, and be
sent home invalided if they marched a mile, by Jove, Sir! without
their umbrellas!
"Now I say, Punch, it isn't fair to talk of us in this way. Even
were it true, I don't quite see the fun of saying it; for the movement
is well meant, if it be nothing else, and it's not the time just now to
try and throw cold water on it. But my belief is really, that there's not
a word of truth in what these old chaps say of us. I don't believe the
'regulars' are tougher men than we are, or more able to fight against
exposure or fatigue. I believe our constitutions are just as good as
theirs: if anything, indeed, I'd rather back them to be better. As
for being trained to bear hunger and privation, to my mind that's all
gammon, and against all human nature. You could no more train a
soldier to put up with half rations than you could train a horse to work
wit hout your feeding him, and to live on miser's diet of a straw and
half per diem. If you wan't a long day's hunting, it won't quite pay
to give short, commons in your stable; and the more you practise men
or horses to bear hunger, the more you will reduce their power to put
up with it.
"But when old fogies say that we know nothing of exposure, and
that half-nn-hour's rain would be enough to make us mizzle, they seem
quite to forget that we have, most of us, a pretty fair acquaintance with
field sports, which, in the way of standing weather, give us pretty fair
field practice. We volunteers of England, who sit at home at ease,
and (they say) daren't venture out if it should rain, or blow, or freeze,
get with tolerable frequency wet jackets in our sports, and yet no
amount of drenching one atom damps our ardour for them. Who can
say that we can't rough it, and are untrained to bear foul weather,
when he sees in black and white a sporting bit like this. I cut it from
the Illustrated Netoi the other day, and it just serves to show people
that raining cats and dogs won't save the life of foxes:—
"The sport with the Quorn bos been remarkably good. A correspondent writes
us as follows:—Thursday, Deo. 29. Tho first day's hunting after the frost; raining
In torrents: wo had a capital day's sport. Tho meet, Switheland Stone Pits; fifty-
four minutes and scarcely a check with our first fox, killing him in the open:
twonty minutes to ground in a drain witjiout a check with the second: and forty
minutes as hard as hounds could raeo with our third fox. . . Friday, Dec. 80.
Found a good fox at Thorpe Trusaolls in the afternoon, and had a cap'ttal thirty-
five minutes, running him to ground close to Prestwold House, in one of the moet
trcmondous hurricanes and thunderstorms ever known at this time of year in the
county. The lightning was most vivid. . . Tuesday, Jan. 3. Staunton Harold.
Had one of the fastest eighteen minutes ever known in the country, with the first
fox: the hounds coursing him for tho last quarter of a mile, and killing him. A
very good hunting run of forty-five minutes with a second fox: when, the afternoon
becoming so stormy, and the rain so heavy, the hounds were taken homo."
"Well—if we are not experienced as yet in standing fire, we have
had some training anyhow of late in standing water. And, mind you,
all these duckings were incurred for sport's sake merely. There was
no compulsion or need to have the nuisance of them. It was in pur-
suit of pleasure that the risk of them was run, and they who ran it, I
dare wager, were not a whit the worse for it. Rheumatism is less rife
with us than with the 'regulars;' yet who shall say we haven't just
i good a chance of catching it?
Besides, haven't we in somi
some way been in training from our boy
hood, and exposed to roughish usage as well as rcughish weather.
Life is not all smoothness at the best of public schools; there are sure
to be tome thorns mixed among the roses. Fagging out at cricket is
tough work for young muscles, and a 'shinning' bout at football is really
no bad practice for the sharper give and take of a regular pitched
battle. At all events such exercise fits for active service and
strengthens those who take to it, in lung as well as limb. Thanks to
boating, bathing, and to hunting in the holidays, an Eton boy grows up
as hard in sinew as a clodhopper, and is just as much accustomed to
exposure to the weather.
Why he should not therefore make just as good a Rifleman, is a
problem which I leave for the old pipeolay chaps to work at, and
they'll astonish my weak mind if they oan bring it to a negative.
Meanwhile, thanking you for all you've been and gone and done to
help us,

NIGHTINGALE'S NOTES.
It is not often that one hears a nightingale in winter-time, but a
Nightingale has lately been bringing forth her A'otes for us, and in
the name of the nation, Punch thanks her for the novelty. The
Nightingale is the same whose sweet voice soothed so many a sick
ear in the war-time, and whose notes may well be listened to in time
also of peace. The theme on which she sings has less of music than oi
melancholy in it, but her notes in their sweet charity, are to our ear
most melodious. She sings of the sick room and how to lessen its sad
sufferings, and give help and comfort to those who have to bear them.
The world knows how our Nightingale has sung this song before,
and how our countrymen have blessed her shadow while she sang it.
She now repeats the theme with copious additions, but without a
variation from the tone of its kind spirit.
But it is not for this alone that Punch cries "Listen to our Night-
ingale!" It is not only for the sweetness which is breathed into her
Notct that Punch would bid his readers to hear them and to profit by
them. For the most practical of purposes her song, like herself, is
"as good as gold." Every note she utters has the value of a Bank
one. Ears deafened by disease may hear it, and be bettered by it:
and ears which have been sharpened by acuteness of affliction, may be
soothed and set at rest if our Nightingale be listened to. Hear, ye
Nurses, how she speaks of needless noise in a sick room, and hold your
chattering tongues a= experience bids her bid you:— |
"Unnecessary noise is the most cruel absence of care which oan be inflicted
cither on sick or well. (For in all these remarks the sick are only mentioued as
suffering in a greater proportion than the well from precisely the same causes.)
Unnecessary, although slight, noise injures a sick person much more thAu neoessary
noise of a much greater amount."
Who, hearing this, shall say how many sick friends have been tor-
tured by their Nurses holding covert consultation with the cook, as to
the quantity of kidneys they can stuff down for their supper, and how
many goes of gin they wish to swill by way of opiate F Who shall say
how many patients have been worried by great doctors, advising this
and that in a loud voice on the landing, or giving their suggestions in
a trumpet-tongued stage whisper, before their creaking boots have
borne them from the room P Who shall say how many sick ears have
been grievously tormented by friends rattling up in cabs to leave their
cards and kind inquiries, or, if they be more bosom ones, stumping
their way up-stairs to see "some one of the family," because they can't
be satisfied with "what those servants say " P And who shall say how
many sufferers are day-and-nightly racked and harassed by those worst
of needless noises, noises in the street P Who shall count the head-
aches caused by cries of "sprats" and "hareskins," "creeses" and
"old clo':"—or say what days of anguish street-music has occasioned,
and what nights of agony have been inflicted by the Waits P Think of
this, ye Magistrates, when next your "mercy" is appealed to in
behalf of a poor organ-grinder." Think how many death-beds he
has probably embittered, and let him have that mercy which in justice
is his due.
But these are not the only noises which cause suffering to the sick,
and which our thoughtful Nightingale notes down as being nuisances.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
New clothes she denounces just, as much as "old clo'," and shows
how Nurses ought to dress for the part they have to act:—
"A Nurse who rustles Is the horror of a patient, though perhaps he does not
know why. The fidget of silk and of crinoline, the rattling of keys, the creaking
ofatayaandof ahoea, will do a patient more harm than all the medicine in the
world will do him good- Cut the noiseless step of woman, the noiseless drapery of
woman, are mere figures of speech in this day. Her skirts (and woll if they do not
throw down some article of furniture) will at least brush against ovcry article in the
room as ahe moves."
Keep your tongues from chattering, and your limbs from stays and
crinoline, and silks and other finery: these are main points in a Nurse's
duty to her neighbour, and when we next fall ill we hope that some-
body will put all our attendants through their catechism, and ascertain
that they both know, and are prepared to do, their duty to us. We
have no wish for our bedchamber to be turned into a chamber of
"horror" of our nurse, and our weak nerves to be fidgeted and fretted
by her finery. A Nurse in stays and crinoline, who can't move without
creaking, must be as great a nuisance in a sick room as a barrel-organ;
and if we ever have the misfortune to be plagued with one, and are
driven to distraction, and to death perhaps, in consequence, we hope
our relatives will issue a commission of inquiry, and our Nurse be taken
up for having maddened, if not murdered us.
But our Nightingale pours forth another Note or two on this
point, and inasmuch as they are highly complimentary to us men, we
trust that women generally will have the gallantry at least, if not the
good sense, to give ear to them:—
"It Is, I think, alarming, peculiarly at this time, when the female ink-bottles
are perpetually impressing U)K>n us * Woman's particular worth and general
missionarineas,' to see that the dress of women is daily more and more unfitting
them for any * mission,' or usefulness at all. It is equally unfitted for all poetio
and domestic purposes. A man is now a more handy and far less objectionable
being in a sick room than a woman. Compelled by her dress, overy woman now
either shuffles or waddles: only a man con cross a sick room without shaking it.
What is become of woman's light step? the firm, light, quick step we have been
asking for" [iustcad of the Salrey-Gampiah slow and ponderously noisy one].
Listen to this, ladies. This is not what Punch, the ribald pester,
says of you. It is not Punch who brings this charge of crinoline
against, you, and accuses you of sheer domestic suicide by dress. You
are self-arraigned, convicted, and condemned. It is a woman who
denounces woman's folly and her uselessness. It is a woman who
condemns you for following the fashion, even though the fashion lead
to sacrifice of service, and to duties being stifled by absurdities of
dress. Swaddled in her finery a woman cannot move except with
fashionable slowness, and is as useless as a mummy while she is so
swathed up.
Such, then, are a few of the Notes which have been lately brought
forth by our Nightingale; and as, clearly, the more widely such notes
are heard the better, Punch is glad to give them echo in his world-
pervading print. Every father of a family should change his silver for
these Notes (their price is fixed so moderately he need not change his
gold for them), and every member of a family should both hear and try
to profit by them. It is not too much to say, that no domestic library
can be complete without them; and considering the doctor's bills they
probably will save him, any Paterfamilias who stupidly neglects to get
these Notes will deserve to get a stress laid on his last Latin syllable.

with two porcelain vases, as a memorial of his stay at Home last year.
The souvenir is appropriate in every respect. What could be more
fitting the position of both giver and receiver than a present as easily
cracked as the wits of the King of Prussia, and almost as liable to
an utter smash as the temporal power of the Pope.

QRAVESEND'S CASE STATED.
he papers say that a de-
Eutation from Gravescnd
as waited upon the
Government, and de-
manded that in the new
Reform Bill provision
should be made for
giving a member of Par-
liament to that odori-
ferous borough. The
Government rather
snubbed the deputation,
which reception Mr.
Punch thinks was rude,
and he has therefore
resolved to aid the op-
pressed, and assert the
claims of Gravesend to
a share in the repre-
sentation. He has re-
quested the Mayor and
Corporation to give him
a list of the reasons why
Gravesend considers it
should have a member
in t lie people's House,
and he has pleasure in
publishing the grounds
on which the demand
is based. They are
these:
1st. Because the aristocratic element predominates far too largely
in Gravesend, it having no fewer than three Piers.
2nd. Because half its population lets apartments, and would therefore
expect its member to spare no panes in setting a Bill in a proper light.
3rd. Because the other half of its population boils shrimps, and is
therefore not likely to be deceived by political Feelers.
4th. Because it is quite opposite Tilbury Fort, and therefore likely
to resist profligate military expenditure.
5th. Because it is celebrated for its water-cresses, and is therefore
likely to enforce official reform in the way of Small Salary.
6th. Because its lodging-letters rob their lodgers' brandy bottles,
and therefore must understand the spirit of the age.
7th. Because, being burned down about once a year, there is no kind
of Policy with which it is not familiar.
8th. Because there is a popular demand for a Digest of laws, and a
person accustomed to Gravesend cookery can digest anything.
9th. Because it is next Milton, and therefore as good as Suakspeare,
who is always being represented.
10th. Because genteel people now go on to Margate, and compen-
sation to Gravesend, in the way of election expenditure, would be
highly acceptable.
11th. Because it is aggravating to see so many returning officers
going over to Tilbury, and not to have one Returning Officer for
Gravesend.
THE PAPAL POSITION.
Save me from my friends! must be just now the aspiration of his
Holiness the Pope. His Holiness's friends seem bent on button-
holing him whenever they've the chance, and telling him what they
would do if they were in his shoes. Of course the doses they prescribe
are most unpleasant ones to take, and every one advises him to do
what he don t like. The most general opinion, however, seems to be
the one that friend Napoleon avows himself inclined to; namely, that
his Holiness should give up earthly territory, and content himself with
exercising spiritual sway. The more the Holy Father's temporalities
are lessened, the more will his authority in spirit be increased. Such
is at least the view these friends of his have taken, but strange to say,
his Holiness does not quite seem to see it.
The Pope's, in fact, is the position of the ifalade Imaginaire, whom
Toinette can't convince that if he will but have one eye out, he 'll see
better with the other, and that lopping off his right arm will invigorate
his left. His Holiness is not to be persuaded by his friends that ampu-
tation of his provinces will increase his Papal power: and however
strongly his friends mav recommend it, his Wariness will doubtless
abstain, until he's forced to it, from making the experiment.

THE EREE-TRADE SCHOOLMISTRESS AND HER
FRENCH SCHOLAR.
There was a boy in Pa-ris; his name was Lou-is Na-po-le-on.
He was a great big boy. and he made all the lit-tle boys do what he
pleased. Now all the lit-tle boys want-ed to buy all their things in
France, when they might have sent to Eng-land for many of those
things, and bought them there twice as cheap. Was not this fool-ish
of them P They said, "If we spend all our mo-ney at home, a-mongst
our-selves, then none of it will go a-way to Eng-land." But they for-
got that if they bought cheap Eng-lish things, the Eng-lish would buy
cheap French things, and so their mo-ney would eome back a-gain.
Lou-is Na-po-le-on was a cle-ver boy as well as a big boy, and he
thought the lit-tle boys were in the wrong. But he had been fond of
play-ing at sol diers, with ri-fles and can-nons, and knew more a-bout
such things than he did a-bout buy-ing and sel ling.
Just af-ter he had fin-ish-ed a game of sol-diers, which he won, and
when he was sit-ting down to rest him-self, there came to the town of
Pa-ris, where he lived in the Tui-leries, a nice old la-dy. Her name
was Cob-den. She did not like play-ing sol-diers at all, but loved to
see lit-tle boys, and big boys as well, play at com-merce in-stead.
When they would let her, she was glad to teach them those gen-tle
games. Lou-is Na-po-le-on said to him-self, "I would like to take
some les-sons in com-merce of Mis-tress Cob-den, so as to be a-blc
to teach the un-der boys." So he went to her house, and asked her
to come to him and tell him all a-bout it; and Mis-tress Cob-den
went and told him, and ex-plain-ed ev-e-ry thing to him that he
wish-ed to know.
It was fun-ny to hear her make him spell,—F, r, dou-ble e, Free:
T, r, a, d, e, Trade,—Free Trade; and I, m, p, o, r, t,—Im-port, ana
E, x. p. o, r, t—Ex-port; and also Ta-riff and Du-ty, and so on; and
teach nim the mean-ing of all those hard words of one, two, and
more syl-la-bles. At last, when he was per-fect in his les-son, he went
and re-peat-ed it to the lit-tle boys, to try and make them learn it.
And then he told them they must now be-gin to let one a-no-ther go
and buy things wher-e-ver those things were to be sold, and not cry
and make a piece of work if French boys dealt with o-ther boys.
Now French boys are to deal with Eng lish boys, and buy cof-fee
and su-gar, and knives and scis-sors, per haps they will not be so
rea-dy as they were to quar-rel and fight. And if they take what we
have to sell, we must take what they liave to sell. We must let their
wine in at a low du-ty. It is good wine; some of it is call ed Cla-ret.
Let us pour out a glass of nice Cla-ret to drink the health of Dame
Cob-den, and suc-cess to her pu-pil Lou-is Na-po-le-on in his new
game of Com-merce and Free Trade.
INTERESTING TO PERVERTS.
We learn from the Timet correspondent that, in consequence of the
Alps hemming in foreign trade, and the Apennines interrupting inter-
nal traffic," Italy has been about the last country in Europe to
have roads." Then, let us ask of the old proverb what, in the
name of the Holy Poker, it means by telling us that "every road
leads to Rome P" It is clear that the assertion must be thoroughly
froundless, when we are told that there are scarcely any roads in
taly at all; and there being no roads, how is it that Rome is to be
approached in all directions, no matter whether a person takes St.
Paul's, or St. Barnabas, or St. George's-in-the-East, or Oxford, as
his starting-point? We suppose that every one who has made up
his weak mind to go in that direction generally finds a way of his
own. In the meantime, if we Protestants are all to be carried over
to Rome some day. as the Wisemen of that hopeful sect are always
telling us, we only nope that they will take good care to pave the way
for us. The journey may as well be made comfortable, with as little
injury to our soles as possible.

VERBUM SAPIENTI.
, Governor Wise, an American pro-
slavery spouter, has been good enough
to refer to a Cartoon which Mr. Punch
issued 'during the Italian War, and
in which two Eagles are represented
as fighting, watched by the British
Lion. The respected Governor, in a
speech also containing much other ridi-
culous matter, declared that the Eagles
meant the North and South in the
Union,—the Free and the Slave states,
—and that Britain was watching their
Slavery quarrel in order to pounce on
America. It is no news, either to Mr. Punch's English or American
friends, that Governor Wise is an Awful Ass; but he might have
given Mr. Punch credit for more ornithological accuracy. Had that
gentleman intended to typify the South and its foul means of sub-
sistence, lie would not brfve drawn an Eagle, but a Carrion-Crow. He
respectfully hopes Governor Wise will accept this explanation.

OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
No. L
"Mr Dear Mr. Punch,
"When my laundress, Mrs. Kinahan, presented herself at
my chambers on the 24th of last month, while 1 was discussing my
breakfast, to inquire whether I intended going 'hout of Town, please
Sir, this Christmas,' I was happy to answer that worthy woman in the
affirmative. Christmas Day in chambers may be likened to an exas-
perated bull in a narrow lane—I mean, that you pass both with a
certain feeling of discomfort, and therefore when that accomplished
whip, Mb- Cabman, Seven-hundred-and-two, drove me away towards
London Bridge Station in his patent chariot, I cheerfully resigned
myself to fate, nor regretted that 1 had left behind me a key which
would give Mrs. K. free access to my Cognac. It is true that the
bottle which I had opened the night before my departure, only con-
tained three teaspoonfuls on my return, but, after all, what is a pint
or so of pale brandy compared with the comfort of a fellow-creature F
If man is but mortal, sure laundresses are not immaculate. Christmas,
as the philosopher has observed (and my Tailor inclines to the same
opinion), Christmas comes but once a year. Let us hope the old lady
enjoyed her grog, and forgot her cares and her chilblains and dust-pan
under its genial influence.
"Arriving at the terminus, after stumbling over hampers, knocking
my shins against oyster-barrels, and getting entangled in groves of
mistletoe, I managed to take my seat in the train. A young gentle-
man with a military deportment and unexceptionable whiskers entered
the carriage soon after, who from the delicate hue of his gloves, the
cursory—not to say maledictory—observations which fell from him
concerning "The Service" and his contempt for the Volunteer Rifle
movement, I rightly judged had but lately entered his profession. It
soon appeared that he was also bound for Hollygate, where I was
going, and indeed it was my lot subsequently to meet the youthful
warrior at dinner, where he appeared in great state, did ample justice
to our host's claret, and kindly entertained us with some choice anec-
dotes—doubtless gleaned at his mess, and chiefly remarkable for their
antiquity.
"Hollygate is a charming village on the banks of the Ripplemere.
My uncle's cottage, where I had been invited, stands in about a dozen
acres of land, about a mile from the Station. _ It is not a large house,
but is noted for containing three of the prettiest girls in the neighbour-
hood and a cellar of excellent wine. Their ages vary from seventeen
to three-and-twenty—the girls I mean—the wine dates from a more
remote period.
"Don't you think, under the circumstances, that I was justified in
'running down' there for a week?
"My cousins, though I say it, are moreover, remarkably agreeable
'parties,' and but for an unfortunate prejudice concerning the subject
of affinity, I am by no means sure that I should not—however, I won't
enter on that subject now. These three young ladies differ somewhat,
as sisters generally do, in character. Laura, the youngest, confesses
to a weakness for the Army. The sight of a red coat or the jingle of
spurs will mi Hire to set the poor child's heart in a flutter, and a
partner clad in those habiliments is sure of her hand in a ball-room,
though the first is confessedly an awkward garment to waltz in, and
the latter invariably tear holes in her dress.
"Agnes, on the other hand, inclines with more favour towards the
clerical profession. Now, Ecclesiastical sentiment may be shown in
various ways, and there is as much fashion in its manifestation as there
is in the cut of Mr. Buckmaster's coats, or in the shape of my lady's
bonnet. You, my dear Punch, will remember, when Evangelical prin-
ciples were in vogue, that if a young lady wished to show her respect
for a pet parson, she would purchase a yard of Bishop's lawn, and
forthwith make him a set of 'bands.' Occasionally slippers were
worked by the faithful. Sometimes his Reverence received a silver
tea-pot.
"Times are altered now. Bands are no longer orthodox, copes are
coming in. Slippers have given place to 'M. B. waistcoats.' lea-pots
are out of date.
"Our fair devotees now employ their leisure hours in working altar-
cloths or copying texts, so beautifully illuminated that you can hardly
read them. Miss Agnes, who is skilled in the latter accomplishment,
employs my ultramarine and rose madder with great effect on vellum,
and, as she never uses more than nine cakes of colour per week, I am
delighted to direct her efforts. 'Do, my dear Jack,' cried the enthu-
siastic girl one morning, 'Do please make me a design for an ante-
pendium. Our Curate wants me to embroider one for'
"' What on earth is an antependium F' said I, snatching up Mr.
Riddles' famous dictionary.
"'You won't liud it there,' said Lieutenant Wagsbt, with a grin.
'In plain English it's a hang before; and I suppose, Mr. Easel, haw,
haw 1 you '11 see the reverend gentleman hanged before you do it!"
"\V ithout paying any attention to Wagsby's coarse and rather flat,
joke. I set to work, as soon as I understood what was wanted, and
produced a sketch for the art icle, which 1 am proud to say gave satis-
faction, not only to Miss Agnes, but to the Curate himself (the Rev.
Minton Tilib), who, being remarkable for his mediaeval tendencies,
is an excellent judge in such matters. He has made heel-ball rubbings
of every 'brass' in the United Kingdom, and wears a stripe down his
trousers as an emblem, he says, of the Church militant.
"Rose, who is the pet of the family, laughs at both her sisters, and,
to do her justice, confines her smiles to neither red nor black coats.
Why should she F We all admire her by turns, and, in due rotation,
she jilts every one of us. She will talk 'pipeclay' to Wagsbt, discuss
field matters with the Squire, and 'high art' with your humble servant.
It was but the other morning I caught her osling the Curate, and
begging him to buy her a rosary. A rosary, indeed! If lie had been
an Archbishop, and she bad asked him fur York Minster, I don't think
he could have refused her. She is irresistible. Just as certain great
generals arise only to triumph and come off victorious in every engage-
ment, so some women are born, I think, to conquer and carry captive
before them all whom they encounter. With what ease they begin thi
assault, and how perfect are the tactics of coquetry! A judicious
sigh, a well-timed glance, a lock of hair escaping, or a pretty foot
displayed, may throw some of the bravest of us off our guard, and
make us prisoners before we have time to think about it, or cry for
quarter. A few members of this fair Rifle Corps are always practising,
and care little whom they wound so long as their shots take effect.
Who can say he is proof against such warfare F To-day a valiant
Ensign falls a victim, to-morrow an honest tar. It may be young
Daubnet in his studio, or Mr. Parson in canonicals. It is the great
heir going out to shoot, or poor John coming in with the tea-tray.
No matter—a look—a word—a laugh has done the mischief, and down
we all go, priest, soldier, painter, plump upon our knees, and become
her slaves for life. No—not for life. There comes a time when the
most skilful manoeuvring will not avail, and all the charming strategy
of our generalissima is lost upon us. Wit, beauty, pride are fair
burnished weapons, which may rust with age, and cannot last for ever.
Beware, ye flirts, in time lest

Miss Rose, who had been watching my grave face as I wrote.
"' Yes, my dear' I said (for in truth it is tolerably prosy).

said she, dropping me a saucy curtsey.

Missionary Economy.
Accordiug to the Times, the Church Missionary Society expends
annually on the maintenance of missionaries and their families, Ou
"deputations," publication, and other little sundries, £38,000, or
nearly the fourth of its whole income at home, "before one native is
converted, or even sees a missionary." It would be interesting to
know how many natives the Society converts yearly with the rest of
the cash. The charity of the Church Missionary Society begins at
home, indeed, and remains there in a very considerable measure. To
what extent does it go farther F if to any, what number of converts

HUMOURS OF THE HOLY SEE.

Bt the account of the
Roman correspondent of
the Morning Post, the
paternal heart which has
been represented as op-
£rcsscd with so much
eaviness, is, on the con-
trary, particularly light and
jolly. We are informed
that—
"On the 2nd inatant a dcpu
tation of Jews waited uponnU
Holiness for the purposo of
congratulating him upon the
Now Year. His Holiness Is
stated to havo been peculiarly
jocular with the member* of
the deputation, inquiring after
the health of Siqnor "Mom-
molo," the father of Mortara,
and asking the aato\inded
Israelites whether they thougtit
thoCongroas would obligo him,
the Pope, to give up the boy."
"Mommolo" is plainly
an Italian diminutive of
Moses; the same playful
species of appellation as
our English Mo," or as
the familiar and affection-
Mortara is, as evidently, one of
aUocution respecting Signoh "Mommolo's" health, and
tneir opinion of the probable action of Congress in that
sufferer s behalf. One thing no doubt led to another; we
can conceive that gibes were respectively exchanged about
baturaay and Sunday, or that raillery was bandied in like
relation to celibacy and abstinence from black-puddings;
the Ho y lather finally dismissing his visitors by poking
fun at them with the corner of his mantle folded into the
shape of a pig's ear.
ate name of Ikey, substituted for Isaacs. Mortara is, as evidently, one of
those euphemisms for Moses which correspond to Moss and Morris. It is incre-
dible that the Pope, who is personally a decent kind of man, should have
spontaneously and impertinently bantered the Jews who came to pay their
respects to him on such a subject as that of the bereavement which he has con-
sidered it his duty to inflict on Mr. Mortara. Gentlemen of the Hebrew
persuasion are generally rather prone, in conversation, to adopt a style of facetious
personality, with small regard to the dignity of the personage to whom their obser-
vations are addressed. If his Holiness said anything about "Mommolo," the
probability, is that it was only a retort, provoked by the Jews in offering the
Sovereign Pontiff some of their chaff. "What will you take for your temporal
crown?" or "Want any clo' for your foreign troops?" or some other such
pleasant colloquial inquiry on their part, may be presumed to have elicited the
THE DEATH OF THE CAT.
Than ks mainly to Punch !—readers who doubt this
should look back some thirty volumes, and see how Punch
attacked and has continued to attack her—thanks mainly
to Punch, the cat is on her last legs both in Army and in
Navy, and Punch will take good care that no one lifts a
hand to save her. Slowly, but with sureness, she is passing
from among us, and we need not' fear we ever more shall
look upon her like. The cat has no relations to endow
with her bad properties: and although her lives may be
as many as her tails, no long time can pass before we see
the end of them. Moritura vos saluto is now a fitting
phrase for her, wherewith to introduce herself to those
who wish her further; and as she visibly grows weaker
on every fresh appearance, there seems very little ques-
tion but that we shall soon lose sight of her. Reduced to
her last legs, and being as she is upon the very worst of
footing, there is no doubt she must shortly disappear in
toe-toe. If an inquest be demanded to decide what were the
causes which induced her dissolution, it will not be found
difficult to find a verdict in the case, "Died from the
attacks of Punch and Popular Opinion" of course would
be at once the finding of the Jury, and no Coroner could
hesitate one moment in confirming it. That the death has
been a lingering one is not the fault of the assailants:
but the cat, be it remembered, is an "ancient institution,
and, like old annuitants, "Ancient Institutions " are always
slow to die.

CLERICAL COSMETICS.
A Tradesman of Ratcliff Highway, named Daniel Stocker, was
brought, on Tuesday last week, before Mr. Yakdley, at the Thames
Police Court, in consequence of having, the evening before, shouted
after the Rev. Bryan King and his lot, on their departure from St.
George's in the East, after the performance of their "Evensong,"
"There goes those Puseyites!" In the course of a dialogue with the
Magistrate, the defendant said, that he knew that the reverend gent
and his associates were Puseyites "by the cut of their clothes."
Whereupon inquired—
11 Mr. Yardley. Then they bocomo Puseyites by the art of tailoring?
"The Prisoner. Very much like it; I have seen chaps of the same sort, with their
palo Jesuitical faces, in Devonshire, where I came from."
The pallor of the sacerdotal complexion is very peculiar, and may
well have attracted the attention of an ordinary observer, such Mr.
Stocker may be conceived to be. How do the priests acquire it?
By singularity of diet—"making so many fish meals that they fall into
a male green-sickness" P Mere fasting will not produce the effect;
or paupers would resemble Papist and Puseyite parsons; moreover
these white-faced gentry are some of them fat. Do they use any
wash in order to blanch their cheeks P We see no cosmetics for such
a purpose advertised in the lay papers; but. for ought we know, there
may be Ecclesiastical journals with a strictly professional circulation,
containing puffs of various preparations of the kind in question; such
as Liguori's Bleaching Balsam, Xaveer's Exsanguinatory, and
Loyola's Anti-Bloom.

A TOBACCO CONGRESS.
(From our Foreign Intettigenier.)
easuees have already been in-
stituted for the due accommo-
dation of the Plenipotentiaries
who are to attend the proposed
Congress, in case that great
assembly is destined to come
off.
The ultimate object of these
arrangements is to facilitate
the despatch of the important
business which the representa-
tives of the Great Powers will
be commissioned to transact.
The principle on which the
preparations in question are
based is suggested by the cir-
cumstances under which their
Imperial Majesties the Eh-
FEROR8 OF FRANCE and AUS-
TRIA, meeting, discussed and
came to an agreement on the
preliminaries of the Treaty of
Villafranca. Their Imperial Majesties, on that memorable occasion, met, and talked over
the politics of Italy, and were enabled to settle the affairs of many millions of men, with
cigars in their mouths.
It is this consideration which has generated the idea, that the questions to be brought
under the consideration of Congress shall be debated whilst smoking. Ilence has arisen the
necessity for the arrangements above intimated.
These provisions, summarily stated, are liquor and tobacco, with their accessories. In
detail, they include, besides wines, spirits, and cigars of all the higher qualities. Bristol
Bird's Eye, Turkey, Latakia, Cut Cavendish, C'Naster, and Common Shag, together with
an adequate proportion of pipes and beer. The latter will comprise all varieties of malt
liquor from stingo to swipes, which may be preferred by some of the illustrious diplomatists,

who, nevertheless, think no small beer of them-
selves. The former will embrace every species
of meerschaum, hookah, cutty-pipe, narghi 16, and
churchwarden.
Spittoons of a rich and chaste construction, in
gold, will be provided for the use of the high
contracting parties. The manufacture of these
utensils has been entrusted to the eminent jewel-
lers Messes. Bkeyl. The Plenipotentiaries will
be empowered to carry away their gold spittoons
together with the customary allotment of dia-
mond snuff-boxes.
The thought which has presided over the crea-
tion of these conditions for the session of Con-
gress is, that of converting this European
convention into a veritable Divan; in wnich
grave questions, pondered by diplomacy behind
a pipe, will receive a sober consideration from
those who well know how not to take too much
brandy-and-water.
Nevertheless, it will be in the power of this
grand modern council of Amphictyon, to imi-
tate, if it pleases, the wisdom of the ancient
Scythians, and discuss all matters submitted to
its consideration twice; the first time during a
state of intoxication, and, secondly, when so-
briety shall have resumed her sway; so that its
determinations may not, on the one hand, want
vigour, nor, on the other discretion.
It is not too much to hope that the Sachems
of the smoking Congress will conclude their
labours by passing round the pipe of peace.
The only possible obstacle to this desirable result
will be, the deplorable obstinacy of a sovereign
who persists in obsolete pretensions, and who, if
he will not accept the cigarette which will be
offered him, will be recommended to put nothing
whatever in his pipe, and smoke it.
THE RIGHTS 0' MAN.
(A Souther* Venion of them, in black and white.)
In the Rights o' Man I du believe, with Washington and Jefferson;
But from them ondying patriots a pint or two I deffers on:
In their noble declaration they ougliter set out fuller,
That black and white stands opperw'fe, in rights as well as colour.
They'd no pesky abolitionists, a hatchin' revolootions
To upset our Southern chivalry's domestic institootions;
If they'd a* know'd such varmint as in Gbeblt's Tribuni figgers,
They d a' had two declarations—one for whites, and one for niggers.
To supply this 'ere omission is what I du propose to,
And this ere's the sum and substance, pretty much, o' what I goes tu;
White rights is all whites likes to take; and as for blacks—(I'm sick
o' them)—
Waal, I guess their rights, is jest what's left, when the whites has
had their pick o' them.
Or, stoopin' to perticlars (though it 'a what I kinder scorn tu)
I conclude that chains and cowhides both whites and blacks was
born tu.
With this slight difference, that whites was for their active use meant,
Blacks, for snff'rin on 'em passive, for white profit or amusement.
The corner-stone of all white rights,—and there ain't nowheres a
bigger—
Is the innate right of every white to wop his private nigger.
And all I doubts is whether the right's bounded to his private one,
And don't reach to niggers gin'rally, whene'er you can let drive at c
In course I hold there's dooties that correspond to rights, Sir,
(The first belongs to niggers, and the second all to whites, Sir:)
So, if the white exerts his right to cowhide, and don't spare it,
The correlative black dooty is fur to grin and bear it.
The white man's right to freedom's wide as universal natur;
i one.

The white he has a heaven-born right to make the black his chattel.
And chattels can't be citizens (see Puffendoef and Vattel):
Bnt in our magnanimity the exclusion we relaxes,
And gives blacks the right o'citizens, as fur as payin taxes.
This makes the critters sarcy, till from inch to ell extendin,
On the priv'lege of tax-paying they would hook that of tax-tpendin:
And the next thing '11 be askin place on the electral rolls, Sir,
Till at last I shouldn't wonder if they set up claims to souls, Sir.
By way o' mild corrective to such doctrines undenninin,
This declaration I submit for gin'ral nigger signin;
With gradooated punishments for those who fail or falter—
To begin with tar and feathers, and to wind up with a halter.
"I, Blank—a nigger born and bred—hereby make declaration,
I havn't no rights to nuthin—name, church, vote, home, nor nation;
For the bless ins of my slavish state I'm grateful to my master,
Who feeds and clothes and flogs me fust, and then pays for the plaster.
"Should 1 be so onlucky as fur to sink to freedom,
And be druv to cast my chains aside, however much I need 'em,
I declare I won't stay in this state, to cut that frightful figger,
That it stands to reason must be cut, by a mis'rable free nigger.
"For New-England or the Canadies I straightway will absquatulate,
That on one free nigger more them States themselves they may congra-
tulate;
So to pay for their free-negroism the abolition varmint,
Who backed up old Osawatomie, and said there warn't no harm in't.
"If cotched at liberty, myself illused I du consider
If I ain't took up and sold right out unto the highest bidder:
And cheerfully I will go back to chains, cowhide, and collar.
So help me Gin'eal Washington, and 'The Almightt Dollar !'"
The Maine-iac's Advice.
"Friend! Imitate the example of the railway-engine. He is the
greatest teetotaller running—can keep up for hours at the rate of forty,
and even si xty, miles an hour—and whistles over his work all the while;
and yet he never takes anything but water when he wants to wet his
whistle I"
Old Beaux of Brown
probably some old
Beta.
There are probably some old martinets who still retain their
admiration of old Brown Bess as she was when she wore powder in her
prime; and who contend that she was preferable at that early period
to what she became when, before discarded for her Enfield rival, slit,
took to wearing caps.

WHAT REFORMATORIES HAVE DONE.
There has been a Meeting, not of theoretical, but practical,
Reformers, at Birmingham, in favour of the Reformatory movement.
As usual at such meetings, Mn. M. D. Hill, the energetic .Recorder,
took a prominent lead. He proved, hy the strong force of figures, how
much belter it was to send young criminals to school, where they were
instructed, instead of locking them up in gaols, where they only got.
corrupted. To them the gaol was as good as a College of Crime, and
the juvenile Jack Shepherds confined there were perfect Under-
graduates of Vice,—with this simple exception, that the young rascals
paid more attention to their studies than Undergraduates generally
do. The difference of the two plans of treatment is so largely in
favour of the former, that the only wonder is, that it was never put in
force years ago. By the Reformatory, young siuners, whose sins are
more the fault of their parents than t hemselves, are reclaimed, and the
ranks of good citizens strengthened; and by the prison, a sacrifice is
consummated of a poor miserable young creature to ignorance, "to be
returned again into society as a double vengeance and as a redoubled
punishment upon society which had so ill-treated him."
The wrong thus committed by society falls with a two-fold severity
upon itself. Mr. Hill fixed the number of our felon population at
160,000, and he stated that the amount of property annually stolen by
them was no less than £13,000,000 sterling.
Mr. Kynnersley, another philanthropic labourer in the same good
cause, remarked that the general diminution of crime in the whole
kingdom, since 1856, was, according to the report of Mr. Sydney
Turner, 26 per cent.—a clear gain of rather more than one-fourth.
"How was a fact so incredible to be accounted for P" inquired the
honourable gentleman. "In a great measure (is his reply) to the
Keformatory movement, that puts it in the power of Magistrates to
send young criminals to these institutions for reformation for a
lengthened period."
Since these Reformatories have had the effect of diminishing crime
to the extent of one-fourth, it is but fair to conclude, that that sum of
£13,000,000, stated to be annually stolen, would have been one-fourth
larger supposing that these schools of redemption had not been in
existence; and since this diminution has been in operation ever since
the year 1856, the gain resulting to the country by their establishment
during those three years has been a sum of not less than £12,000,000,
representing a saving of a clear four millions every year. To this sum
must also be added the cost of maintaining the children constantly in
prison, supposing the old method of allowing them to ripen in gaol
into adult criminals had been persevered in. This, however, is only
the ledger view of the question, and that is a very small consideration
when compared with the large practical utility, and the great human-
ising charity, which are the principal moral features of this movement,
whose beneficial effects will be felt by succeeding generations even to
a greater extent than by ourselves. As schools are better than prisons,
—as it must be more agreeable to teach than to punish,—as prevention
has usually been considered a more rational course of treatment than
cure,-—we are astonished that the Government does not interest itself
a little more warmly in t he establishment and increase of these valuable
institutions, that have aided most materially the cause of civilisation by
preventing so many young pupils of crime growing up under able
tuition into so many trained professors.
one thing they manage BETTER IN FRANCE.
They wash better; for it must be confessed that a French washer-
woman with her linen beats an English washerwoman all to rags.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

1MB—Tuesday, 2ilh January, 1860. Scene—The
Palace of Westminster. On the rising of the
curtain is discovered the interior of the House of
Lords, crowded teith spectators. In the C. the
Throne, on tehich is seated Queen Victoria,
superbly robed in silver tissue with a train of
crimson velvet lined with ermine, a magnificent
stomacher of diamonds completely concealing the
front of the dress, and on her head a massive demi-
crown of brilliants. Prince Albert in F. M.
costume and leaning on his sword, L. Princesses
Alice and Helena on woolsack, C. with their
Royal backs to the spectator. Foreign Ambas-
sadors in masquerade costumes, L. Peeresses splen-
didly dressed, but without crinoline, all down the
EL side of the House; distinguished lady spectators,
similarly attired, all down the L. A thin margin
of Peers, in robes, in front of the laaies Speaker
of the Commons, with several Ministers and a crowd
of Members at the bar. facing the Throne. Near
the Throne, and on each side, Great Officers of State
with the Crown, the Cap of Maintenance, the
Sword of State, the Grand Marshal's baton, and
the Great Seal (the latter in mourning for the
demise of its namesake the Talking Fish), soldiers,
trumpeters, bouffeltiers, pages, heralds, and the
Duke of Cambridge.
The Queen.
Great Peers of England, pillars of the Slate,
And you, whom I may also call its piers
(Excuse the jest), because you do support it,
Right, glad am I to meet you once airain,
And ask for your assistance and advice,
Not being in the slightest need of either.
With all Ten Tea-Pots ('tis an anagram
Culled from the Boy's Own Book, and, analysed,
Makes Potentates) I'm on the happiest terms—
"Footing" I see is writ, but that is Walker,
And if my Ministers had studied Walker,
Or sturdy Johnson, or fastidious Murray,
Or even the Yankee lexicographer,
Noah Webster, such research perchance had taught
A better style, to set before their Queen.
Their grammar's like the scrambling messages
By telegraphs—I call it Telegrammar.
In August last 1 told you I'd been asked
To send my envoy to the general Congress
That was to settle the Italian questions
More formally I've been invited since,
And I have said I'd send, provided always,
(And mind, upon this one condition only)
That no external force should be employed
Upon the Italians. They have burst their chains,
Italian irons are gone out of fashion.
The Pope has sold his mangle, and henceforth
Freedom shall wash her Happy Shirts at home.
There is a hitch about the Congress now,
But if it meets, my sentiments are known.
1 've made a Treaty with the Emperor
For letting in French wines and other things
At a diminished duty—better far
To tap the Frenchman's claret in that way,
Than oellicosely, and as Mr. Sayers
In April means to try Benicia's tap.
Spain (urged by France) has blundered into war,
And now is blundering through it, and I trust,
One of these days will blunder out again.
What better things can any country hope,
Whose Sovereign, when she sends her troops to war,
Makes fine new petticoats for holy dolls.
And begs their blessings on her cannon-balls.
Not sol mean to teach John Chinaman,
Who at the Peiho forts repulsed my ships,
That folks had better play no tricks with me.
Our expedition's getting ready now
(In concert with the French), and it will cook
The Chinese goose right expeditiously.
Touching that stupid question of San Juan,
We might have got into an awkward row,
With Brother Jonathan, had not my men
Behaved with all forbearance.—I believe
That squabble will be pleasantly arranged.
Lord Clyde has trodden out the mutiny
That might have lost me India; and Lord Canning
Walks all about, and with a liberal hand
Showers gold, estates, and honours on the chiefs
Who had the brains to see that we must wiu.
All is serene in India. With Japan
And Guatemala compacts I have made,
Which, I dare say, will be enormous boons,
But leave it to yourselves to fiud oat why.
'Tis meet to say that no economy
Dictates, this year, the coming Estimates,
Except that best economy of all,
That spares not pennies when the pounds are stakes.
These islands must be guarded, 0 my Lords,
So, O my Commons, tumble out the tin.
There's no excuse for shilly-shally, Sirs,
The revenue is satisfactory.
Lord Melville, the Scotch Baron, is a Tump,
To talk the trash he did about the Rifles.
I, on the contrary, receive with pride
And gratitude the aid they volunteer.
It adds an element to our defences.
So do not heed that Scottish Pump, Lord Melville;
He is a gallant soldier—but you know
A soldier's not, toujours, a Solomon.
And now, my Lords and Gentlemen, perpend!
You will be shortly asked to give your best
Attention to a measure of Reform.
Amendment and extension are your cues,
I pray you tackle to the task in earnest,
And let's be quit of that same botheration.
There are some law reforms tha need your care—
Bankruptcy and Conveyancing the chief,—
And if, by any wise amalgamation,
You can infuse into the bread called law
Some little leaven that's called Equity,
It would be very well. Now, I have done.
The nation's tranquil, crime's diminishing,
And so is poverty; and everywhere
Loyalty, order, and contentment reign,
For which all thanks unto a Higher Power
Than mine. Be your deliberations blessed!

Lord Truro (seconding the Address). Mumble, mumble, mumble,

Lord Grey. Some of the Address is all very well, but the Commercial
Treaty with France is a mistake. Why should we take off the duties
on French products, unless to do ourselves good? All stuff. If
France chooses to be so idiotic as to stick to prohibitions, let her
suffer and be laughed at, until she takes them off without a bribe from
us. And we are all wrong about China, and might serve trade better
without war. I move an amendment to that effect.
Duke of Newcastle. You know nothing about the Treaty, and you
don't understand the Chinese question. The honour of this country
is not to be made subservient to the interest of the tea-trade.
Lord Normanby. I—a—am very old, uncommon old, I assure your
Lordships—and—and I am myself assured that I was never very wise
when I was young, and wrote silver-fork novels, sneering at every-
body that dian't live—a—in £elgravia. But I hope you won't do
anything to encourage that firebrand, Mr. Garibaldi; for I do assure
you, my Lords, that the Dukes and Princes of Italy are the dearest
fellows on earth—most gentlemanly, I assure your Lordships—most
attentive to myself—uncommon attentive, yes.
Lord Brougham. Let the Italians do their own work. Let us arm.
Lord Derby (pleasantly). I couldn't hear a single word that those
two fellows said in moving and seconding the Address, but I've no
doubt they made deucedly fine speeches, and I beg to congratulate
them. But I don't congratulate anybody on the Commercial Treaty,
and I don't at all see my way in the China business, and though I
don't in the least understand what position Ministers have taken up
on the China business, I condemn them just as much as if I perfectly
•iomprehended it.
Lord Granville. As you talk only for the sake of talking, I shall
say very little in reply, except that we have done everything for the
best, and that a great loss has been sustained by the House and the
country, in the death of Lord Macaulat. (General assent.)
Lord Grey. I shan't withdraw my amendment; but as those Tories
are afraid to support me, though they would like, 1 shan't divide.

The Speaker. Order! Order! (Seads the Queen's Speech.)
Mr. St. Aubyn (in Rifle Costume). I move the Address.
Lord Henley (in Deputy-Lieutenants costume). I second the Address.
Mr. Disraeli. You read so unusually ill to-day, my dear Denison,
lliat I could hardly hear you. What have you been doing with your-
self, to lose your elocutionary powers. However, I suppose that all is
right. But I want to know why the mention of Reform comes so late
in the Speech. I want to know why we have not got the Commercial
Treaty before us. I want to know what Ministers have been doing
with Continental questions since August. I want to know whether
Palmerston really means to produce the papers he promises. And I
specially want to know how Lord John Russell dared to mix him-
self up m the Italian question, and undertake to settle Italy.
Lord John Russell. How do you know I did P
Mr. Disraeli. Why, I read it in telegrams.
Lord John Russell. Telegrams! Anonymous messages! A nice kind
of party you are, to bring charges on such grounds.
Mr. Disraeli. All very fine, but I should like to know the truth;
because it is a most solemn and important question. I invite a reply.
R.S.V.P.
Lord Palmerston. I accept the invitation, and beg to inform you, my
dear Mr. Disraeli, that the whole story is bosh. My valued young
friend, Lord John Russell, never entered into any compact at all;
and I fear that you must add this to your already extensive, celebrated,
and highly interesting collection of mare's-nests. We mean to leave
Italy to settle her own affairs. If she loves her Princes, let her call
t hem back. If she adores her Pope, let her keep him. But she shall
do as she likes. I do mean to produce the papers; and when you have
read them, you will see that we have done everything in the most
superior manner.
(Address voted — Curtain Falls.)
Wednesday. Mr. Cardwell distinguished himself by an epigram.
On the report on the Address, somebody complained that the Queen
had said nothing about Ireland. Mr. Cardwell replied, that "the
absence of mention of Ireland in a Queen's Speech was in itself a
matter of congratulation." If the Hon. Member can write as well as
talk in that style, he may hear of something to his advantage by calling
at 85, Fleet Street. After some miscellaneous talk on things in general,
the Address was agreed to.
Thursday. Lord Brougham stated, that all the territories of Sar-
dinia were in Italy, and Lord Normanby declared that they were not.
We believe that a bet was made, and that the question is referred to
the editor of the Family Herald. There was nothing else, except the
introduction of a little Chancery Bill for making some tiny improve-
ments in practice,—prescribing that India-rubber bands shall be as
lawful for fastening up papers as red tape, or some such national
boon.
In the Commons the first fight of the Session took place. Mr.
Bouverie, who partakes, a good deal, of the character of the official
Prig, and thinks that nothing can be properly done except "in the
Department," is scandalised at Private Members taking up the time of
the House on Fridays with questions that raise discussions and delay
the progress of work. But the zealous Prig got a good deal snubbed,
and nis proposal for silencing people was rejected by 166 to 48. Mr.
Bright then came out with a proposal which showed the mild cha-
racter of democratic rule. There has been bribery in Gloucester; so
the friend of justice and freedom proposed to withhold the right of
voting from everybody, innocent or guilty, in Gloucester, for Ten
Years, that during this penal servitude everybody might point at the
place as a blot and blotch on our system. The proposal has not yet
been carried. Mr. Gladstone then commenced his wonderful financial
manipulations, to the utter bewilderment of the House, which, after a
few of his explanations, despairingly told him he must do as he
pleased.
Friday. Viscount Ddngannon's interference in Church matters is
usually extremely undesirable: but to-night he was exceptional, and
made a proper protest against certain zealous but unwise Clergymen,
who commit "the foolishness of preaching " on the boards of Theatres.
Mr, Edwin James demanded a Court of Appeal in criminal cases; and
the Home Secretart had to defend himself for not having hanged
Dr. Smethurst, Sir George's excuse being that it was quite possible
that Smethurst might not have been guilty. Cardinal Wiseman's
Cross-Bearer, Mr. Bowter, attacked the Divorce Court. Is it not
curious that the Romish priests everywhere oppose the granting relief
to unhappy married persons F On the Continent one can understand
this; for there the teachings of Rome have so demoralised Catholic
society, especially female society, that if men with bad wives had a
way of escape the scandal to the Church would be awful. But as
most Catholic women in England are as good as most Protestant
women here, the Priests and their tools might as well let the subject
alone. The Attorney-General promised his Bankruptcy Bill imme-
diately: and so ended the first week of the last session of a Parliament
pledged to Suicide. Mr. Punch will be classically ready to cast his
three handfuls of earth, and in the mean time proposes to himself the
pleasure of throwing a few stones on account.
ST. STEPHEN'S AND ST. GEORGE'S-IN-THE-EAST.
Mr. Danby Seymour having inquired, whether the Government
intended to take any steps for the relief of parishioners from Roman-
ising incumbents, Sir G. C. Lewis is reported to have said—
"I am not aware that it would bo possible to lay down by law any such definition
as the hon. gentleman points to, and tho Government arc not prepared to introduce
any Bill such as he has described. (Hear, hear.) if ho himself should wish to pro-
duce a bill ou the subjoct, 1 shall bo extremely delighted to find that his ingenuity
has been able to frame such a measure as will draw a lino between the extremely
obscure limits he has pointed out (A laugh.)"
No doubt the Home Secretary is quite right; and theological dis-
cussion in Parliament is to be deprecated. The House of Commons,
open to all sects, should be influenced by none. St. Stephen's cannot
consistently legislate for St. George's-in-the-East. That being so,
what are the parishioners of St. George's-in- the-EasttodoP If they
cannot be enabled to dispense with the services of a Tractarian fanatic,
and do not choose to grin and bear them, they have no resource except
to hiss them. If Parliament cannot help people, it is not wonderful
that they should help themselves, although by means which are
popular and ungenteel. It may be irreverent to express disappro-
bation of an officiating clergyman; but the desecration is initiated by
the parson who turns his Church into a theatre. The Rev. Bryan
King should leave off playing at Mass, and then his flock should
cease to hoot their pastor.
HOW TO PREVENT BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION.
Repeal the Corrupt Practices Bill, and legalise Bribery. All the
rogues will then combine in bribing and being bribed, and all the
honest men will unite in maintaining purity of election. Petty political
distinctions will be annulled; there will exist only two great parties,
or rather, let us hope, a great party and a smaller one; the honest men
and the rogues. The latter, though constituting a minority, are suffi-
ciently numerous to warrant the belief, that, by adopting the above
suggestion, the Legislature will succeed in placing Government by'
Party, both on the right side and the left side, or the right side and
the wrong side, upon a broad and substantial basis.

with triumphs, in the fashionable struggles of the fairer sex. It will
be seen that the dear creatures, whom in gallantry and justice we
account as our chief blessings, have in expenditure of pin-money been
not without alloy. It will be seen how, on the earlier simplicities of
clothing, fashions fruitful of marvels have been gradually established.
It will be seen that, being cursed by the domination of the dressmakers.
Lovely Woman has been blighted and distorted in her beauty, and
pointed at reproachfully by critics, satirists, and cynics: that in an
evil time she learned to deform herself with stays, and has been made
consumptive by small bonnets and thin boots; that for years she
tottered out beneath a head-dress so gigantic that, compared with it,
the Pyramids sank into insignificance; and that by other means she
has grown monstrous in men's eyes, and still disfigures her fair form
with the wide, street-sweeping petticoat, which is descended, crino-
lineally, from the ancient hoop.
As to the course which we intend to pursue with former writers, we
shall use them or not use them precisely as we please, and quote them
or misquote them exactly as we like. We shall, when so disposed,
take down the ablest of historians, and get up as much or little of their
books as we think proper. But while consulting, when we choose, the
learnedest opinions, we shall stick at all times to that which is our
own; and as we don't feel bound to believe the best authorities, we
shall, where we think fit, give credence to the worst.
But instead of wearying the reader with detailing what we mean to
do, our better plan perhaps will be to go to work and do it. Beginning,
then, at the beginning, or as near to it as history enables us to get,
we commence with the costume of those old ancestors of ours, to
whom not without irreverence, we moderns have applied the name of
"Ancient Britons." Now, where the Ancient Britons came from, and
at what period they came from it, is a point on which historians seem
rather in the dark, and even Punch himself cannot say much to
enlighten them. But since it is not probable that they were born
of rainbows, or were dropped out of a water-spout like a reporter's
shower of frogs, we may reasonably conjecture, that they must have
come from somewhere; * and it is scarcely more presumptuous, in a
gifted mind like ours, to suppose that when they came they brought
their wardrobes with them. It is probable, however, that their clothes'
bags did not form a very bulky baggage; for when Julius Gssak
landed he found the natives, as he says, in puris naturalilnis," which
an elegant translator renders, "being dressed in bare skin." To tell
the naked truth, in fact, they showed the Roman Wellington their
figures in the nude, except so far as they were covered by a bit or two
of hide, which as that ass Assbr saith, "dyddc notte saue y* fromme
a hydyngge."
Both CjEsar and Herodian say the Britons were tattooed, and the
former talks about their "caruleum colorem" which he says they wore
to make themselves look fearful frights in fighting (" horribiliori sunt
in pvgnd adspeetu.") Ovid, however, writes of them as "viridet
Brxtanni;" so that from the pictures of our ancestors, which these

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
old word-painters have left us, a doubt seems to arise if they were
painted green or blue." We think, had we to arbitrate, we should
give judgment in the matter, in the sage manner adopted in the case of
the chameleon; there being colourable grounds tor thinking both
colours were worn, and believing that at times green was as fashionable
as blue. We have little doubt the natives wore the bluest of blue looks
when C.t'.s ah came and saw and conquered them; and when, after he
had peppered them, he found how strong they mustered, there is no
question he regarded them as being precious green.
Be this point as it may, there is plainly no disputing that our an-
cestors wore paint; and barbarians though they were (in this matter
especially), they set a fashion which their feminine posterity have fol-
lowed, however much their masculine descendants may have blushed
at it. To the inquiring mind, indeed, it seems as clear as mud, that an
Ancient Briton's dressing-case consisted of a paint-pot: and doubtless
the sole care that he took about his toilette was, as a Celtic bard
informs us—
"Co lagt gttt onnr. sot thorite
Chattt somt mott surtlot stgrkc"
* Not to interrupt ourselves, it may be noted in a note, that these colour* were
adopted by the poets and the priests. Of the latter, some, who doubtless were the
Puseyites of the poriod, "wore vestment* of bright green," like their descendants
in St George's, who certainly are "green," although they may not be thought
"bright;" while tho bards, Cynddelw Informs us, were partial to "sky blue.*

IRISH NATIONAL HUMOUR.
he truly well-informed Liberal
well knows that the penal
laws which our bigoted fore-
fathers enacted against the
Roman Catholics, were
wholly uncalled for and
unjustifiable; particularly
with regard to the Roman
Catholics of Ireland. The
Nation newspaper places
the needlessness and in-
justice of those laws in a
very amusing light by cer-
tain statements which it
pretends to put forward in
reply to the Tablet; that
journal having ascribed to
the Irish people profound
attachment to Her Ma-
jesty's throne, and to
British institutions. His-
torical facts are gravely
adduced by the Nation, to
show that the Irish never
were, and never can be,
loyal; but every unpre-
judiced person will see, that
those citations are meant to
prove quite the contrary to the point which a Protestant ass would
think them intended to demonstrate. For instance, after alluding to
the conduct of "St. Lawrence O'Toole" Archbishop of Dublin, with
respect to Henry the Second, Mr. Mitcukl's playful organ puts
the following question:—
"In later times did not certain Popes grant indulgences to all who fought against
the English Government in Ireland? Is not (he following an extract from a Bull
of Pope Gregory the Thirteenth, addressed to the Archbishops, Btshoje, and
othor Prelates, as also the Catholic Princes, Earls, Barons, Clergy, Nobles, and
People of Ireland—' A few years ago, wo admonished you through our letters when
you took up arms to defend your ubertios and rights, under the leadership of James
Geraldine, of happy momory, that wo would ever bo ready to assist you against
those English heretics who havo deserted tho Holy Church of Rome. Praiseworthy
throughout all time must his exertions bo hi thus endeavouring to cast off the hard
yoke which tho English have imposed on you.' These, as we learn, are the words
of a Pope written in the yoar 1580, and called forth by the circumstances of tho
time Again we learn that tho same holy Pope rendered material
assistance to the fitting out of a warlike expedition destined for the shores of
Ireland, not, as it would appear to us, with tho object of, enforcing submission to
British authority."
Of course everybody who is at all acquainted with the history of the
period to which the above quotation refers, must know that Gregory
was joking. So is the Nation; and none but dull men will understand
in any but a jocular sense either the foregoing or the further specimen
of grave banter:—
"Wo also learn from Irish history that another Pontiff sent his benediction to a
certain Prince Huoh O'Neill, who was by no moans remarkable for meekness and
obedience to the English monarch of his day, and sent also liberal indulgences

to all who should fight—actually fight—under his standard, agalust tho rule and
authority in Ireland of the said English monarch. That was done by his Holiness
Pufe Clement the Biohth."
It is useless to point out to the average Protestant intelligence, that
the preceding passages are burlesques of the preposterous tales which
popular writers are accustomed to relate in order to inflame the stupid
public against what they vulgarly term Popery. Even the following
audacious fudge will be impalpable to the dense masses :—
"Again Pope Urban the Eighth sent money and blessings to Ireland, to people
who were engaged in proceedings which cannot well be called demonstrations of
attachment to the British Throne. Subsequently Pope Innocent the Tenth sent
his Nuncio Rinuccini to Ireland, with large powers and authority, with money and
arms, not for the purpose of inculcating obedience to English law. The Nuncio
brought with him 2,000 muskets—for what purpose? 2,000 plke-hosds— in the name
of common sense for what purpose T 400 brace of pistols—what to do with them?
with match
20,000 pounds of powder,
i match, shot, Ac.—to be used in what manner?"
The irony of the Nation is exquisite, but too subtle. No doubt the
penal laws are defensible only on the supposition that the Popes were
the enemies of England,' and that the i rish, if not all the Homan
Catholics, were a faction of traitors, subservient to the Pope. But
just as footmen and housemaids read Swift's Directions to Servants for
instruction, so will the swinish multitude take the Nation's extrava-
gant fictions about those hostile Popes and traitorous Papists for
realities of history. Entertaining that ridiculous supposition, they
will only wonder why all the Boman Catholics in Ireland, if not in
England-also, were not exterminated like vermin; just as they think
that Drs. Cullen and Dixon, whom they really believe to have
uttered the ravings ascribed to them, ought to be shut up, and that
the Editor of the Nation ought to be hanged. Our facetious Irish
contemporary should not cast those pearls of his before the British
Public. There are old women amongst us who not only believe that
Popes and Papists have in times past burned Protestants alive, but
that even now the Pope keeps in his clutches, and refuses to surrender,
a little Jew whom he stole from his parents. Many of these anile
simpletons are possessed, too, with an idea that "Popery" is some-
thing more than a pure, mild, and reasonable religion, and regard it as
involving allegiance to an alien rule, opposed not only to the established
creed, but also to the established government. A journal which pre-
tends to superior intelligence, and appeals to genteel sympathies, must
ever, studiously and systematically, deride those ignorant snobs.
A WORD IN THE SWELL VOCABULARY.
A Young gentleman in an office at Somerset House, was highly
delighted by reading in the letter of the Alexandrian correspondent of
the Morning Post, the statement, that the Suez canal, as contemplated
by its projectors, would have to be excavated "by the labour of the
fellahs of Egypt," and that—
"Indeed it would be difficult for a foreigner to form an adequate idea of the dis-
astrous and ruinous consequonces to this country, it as originally proposed, and
insisted on as indispensable for the success of the undertaking, by M. Lesseps, this
Pharaonic work had to be executed by the labour of the Egyptian fellahs."
"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "that fellah in the Morning Post is a
deuced cleva fellah! Knows how to spell fellah. Those other fellahs
deuced clever fellahs too—those phonetic fellahs—spell fellah same
way. Shall always spell it so myself in fuchaw. Wish all the wawk
a have to do to-day had to be executed by the labaw of those Egyptian
fellahs."
Mr. Justice Punch on Consolidation of the Law.
Mr. Sleigh announces another "Handy-book" of Law. called
Personal Wrongs and Legal Remedies. The Law seems gradually being
bottled off out of the old-fashioned treatise-cask into these little handy-
book-quarts and pints, first introduced by Lord St. Leonards. But
we will help Mr, Sleigh to a still further condensation of his
subject:—
"Personal wrongs"—bad enough.
"Legal remedies "—still worse.
The Oat on its Last Legs.
There is an old saying which says that "Care killed the Cat." Now,
whether this can be proved true in the case of the decease of any
common cat of nine lives, there may be very possibly a reasonable
doubt. But with regard to the now dying cat-o'-nine-tails, there is
not the slightest question that the proverb has been verified. It can-
not be denied that, in our Army ana in our Navy, a proper care for the
well-being of .the men has killed the Cat.

A STOPPER FOR A BOTTLE-STOPPER..
The hot wrath of Dean Close lately smoked against tobaoeo; and
j now we find the fumes of wine have an ill savour in his nostrils. The
I Dean was terribly whole-hoggish in his intolerance of pigtail; and as
an advocate of temperance, ne is as terribly intemperate. When he
appeared as a tobacco-stopper, he not merely clapped his veto upon
i smoking in excess, but denounced the "filthy weerf as being the root
1 of every evil; and when now his Very Reverence comes before us as a
bottle-stopper, he not merely would impede the over-circulation of the
claret-jug or beer-pot, but would stop the make of these and other
stimulating beverages, on the ground that drink which cheereth must
certainly inebriate.
Whether water-drinkers suffer much from water on the brain, is a
point which we throw out for the doctors to determine. But their
orations are, in general, very watery and weak, and their flow of words
not seldom becomes the merest dribble. The late outpouring of Dean
Close to the Members of the Carlisle (so-called) Temperance Society,
forms clearly no exception to this aquatic rule. Here, for instance, is
i a sample of the wishy-washy stuff which, no doubt, passed for " true
Pierian" with those who sat and drank in the Dean's dean-unciation:—
"Bis Christian friends bad no Idea of the extent and ramifications of the misery
occasioned in this couutry, not by drunkenness, but by drink,—by the thing itself,
by that which intoxicates. He did not care what they catlod it, or what the Bible
might call it. but it was the somothing that made people drunk, whatever that
might be, only it was not water."
"Only it was not water." Beaders will please note the importance
of these words. Something makes people drunk: the Dean don't care
what it's called; only it is not water. How surprisingly Close-
reasoning a brain the Dean must have, to arrive at the conclusion that
a something makes men drunk, and that this something is not water!
Further on we get another sprinkling of wish-wash, such as no one
but a water-spouter could have managed to pump up:—
"Whatever made men drunk—he would not say, reduced them to the levol of the
beast, for beasts never got drunk,—but whatever reduced them to the state of
madmen, robbed them of tbelr mental power, so that they could not distinguish
right from wrong; this was the evil that jiercolatod through society."
Here is set a fresh proof of the Dean being a Close thinker.
Having informed his hearers that beasts do not get drunk, whatever
the unlearned in zoology may say of them, the Dean proceeds to argue
that, whatever makes men mad deprives them of their mental power;
and hence it is, he reasons, that they are unable to distinguish right
from wrong. This is a conclusion that we cannot get away from, and
we congratulate the Dean on so convincing a remark.
In what follows this, however, the Dean is not so happy, and, with
however great a diffidence, we must own we disagree with him. In
the course of our experience, which is not a slight one, we have so
much more frequently seen our friends made jolly than made miserable
by wine-drinking, that we cannot coincide in defining wine to be
—" sn artificial drink, which God never Intended man to take, and which man
only drank to his own misery."
As Dean Close reads the Bible without "caring what it calls"
things, one cannot be surprised at finding him misreading it. Perhaps
the Dean will at his leisure add a footnote to his text, and quote the
sacred passages which prove to him that wine was not "intended" to
be drunk. It is the fashion with some preachers to boast of being
taken, as it were, behind the scenes, and having further insight into
millstones than mere laymen. But to our ears it assuredly smacks
of profanity to make profession of acquaintance with heavenly
requirements,!and of knowing what Divinity "intended" to be done.
His Very Reverence the Bottle Stopper next proceeds to tell us
that—
"He had often thought people appeared stupid, and when ho came to ask the
cause, the answer was Drink.
Drink? Yes, very possihly'; but of what sort, please your Deanship?
Do you mean us to inter that only wine-driukers seem stupid? If so,
we must beg tee-totally to differ from you. We don't bflieve that
water is a good thing for the wits. Mental faculties get low when
kept ou a Veau diet. Claret, while it clarifies, invijgorates the brain,
while water but dilutes, and consequently weakens it. Indeed, if you
doubt the fact, your Deanship, of waterbibbers being stupid, one need
not seek much further than your Deanship's speech to prove it.

BOOK-KEEPING BY THE FRENCH METHOD.
The Annual Report on French finance, presented by the Minister of that department, M.
Magne, to the Emperor, this time contains some remarks whicli are important, if true. For
example, take these:—
"Tho excellence of our financial system principally reposes on two valuable guarantees—control and publicity;
control, which prevents the smallest sum tliat leaves the hands of the tax-payer from entering into the public
treasury, or from passing from ono office to another and thence Into the hands of the creditor of the State, without
tlie legality of its receipt, the regularity of its mov, ments, and the legitimate employment made of it being
proved by responsible agents, verified judicially and on documents by fixed magistrates, and definitively sanctioned
in the legislative accottuts; and publicity, which evory year places before the eyes of the great bodies of the State
and tho public the periodical table of the receipts of the taxes, the special accounts of the Ministers, the labour
of the commissions of control, tho declarations of tho Court of Accounts, and the general statement of tho
Finance Department."
the most
obser-
Of this general statement of the Finance Department, which, though general, goes into th
minute particulars of expenditure and fiscal economy, M. Magna speaks in the following
vable terms:—
"Thanks to that Important document—the indispensablo manual for all those who wish to obtain a practical
knowledge of our finances, and which I every year endeavour to render more and more clear and complete—it
may be said, with all truth, that in France the management of the public money takes place in the brood light of
day, and tbat its rosults have a character of cortainty which canuot give rise to the slightest dispute."
Can the public money be one of those things which they manage better in France? is the
question which one is incited to ask by the above information. I wonder, one says to oneself,
whether the control and publicity on which the financial system of that country reposes have
anything to do with the maintenance of half a million soldiers, and a navy nearly as big as our
own, at a rate so much less expensive as it is than that of British armaments P What becomes
of all the money P is the demand which we are continually hearing on every side. Suppose
the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to answer it after the French fashion, might he not
soon begin to see a faint prospect of abolishing the penal Income-Tax at some period between
this and the Millennium P i
What delightful results might be produced by the adoption of the French method of "control"
in the dockyards and arsenals, and at the Horse Guards and the Admiralty, if it would only
work! But there's the rub; that is to say, perhaps our official wheels would get clogged by
friction. The only control of military and naval extravagance that we have ever attempted has
been exerted by means of a checkstring of red-tape, always getting into a harl, tying itself
into knots, and entangling everybody. This celebrated texture is one of those products of our
administrative industry on which Louis Napoleon would, of course, retain a prohibitive duty, if
there existed among his subjects any demand whatever for sucb an inferior article. It is manu-
factured entirely for home consumption, like British wine; and we can only wish that is was
ns likely, as that fluid humbug is, to be superseded by the importation of a better thing from
Kranse. ■
INSPECTOR-GENERAL DE.
RUSSELL.
William Russell, LL.D., who told Eng-
land how the authorities managed her Army,
and who thereby did even a better thing for
the Army than in immortalising its deeds in
his noble narratives of our wars, has taken
up his pen in behalf of the Service in Red,
and the Service in Blue. He directs a news-
paper for himself, and will, it appears to
Mr. Punch, materially assist that gentleman
in his efforts for the good of our Combative
Institutions. It would appear that even the
terrible exposures made during the Crimean
War, and the indignation that followed, and
the promise of reforms that followed that,
have not quite cured officials of neglect or
jobbery. Mr. Kussell discovered, and an-
nounced in his Army and Navy Gazette, the
fact that some of the woodwork of the car-
riages for the Armstrong guns that were put
on board the Himalaya was rotten. Those
splendid engines, of which we have lately
read so much, would therefore be useless
when wanted to be used. Mr. Russell
called the at tention of the Authorities to the
fact. As usual, when any shortcoming is
pointed out by a civilian, the first thing is
to give him the lie. Out comes the duly
instructed Morning Post with a- bullying
reply, thus—
"A statement appeared in tho Army and Sary
Qazrtte, to tho effect that the carriages manufactured
at tho Royal Arsenal for the Armstrong guns, on
being hoisted on board the Himalaya steam-ship,
were found to be rotten, Ac. This assertion is (we
aro informed on good authority) entirely incorrect.
The carriages in questiou were constructed from
timber most carofully selected, and as regards ma-
terials and workmanship, they were considered by
practical men in the carriage department to bo per-
fect specimens."
This is the true official style—not only is
the thing not bad, but it is the very best
thing in the whole world. But. Mr. Russell
has had some experience of official veracity,
and is not exactly the man to be very much
impressed by such an answer. He institutes
a new examination into the case, and favours
the Authorities with the following rejoinder:
"If the 'good authority' were present on the
occasion of hoisting the guns on board, wo would
request him to favour us with an interview, for the
purpose of discussing a matter of fact. As he could
not have been on board, or his contradiction would
not have assumed such a positive form as 'entirely
incorrect.' we beg to reiterate our statement on
bttter authority than hi* 01m, and to repeat, on that
authority, it was found, on hoisting some carriages
of tho Armstrong guns on board, that portions of the
woodwork were unsound, i.e. 'rotten.'—EniTOR."
That is an awkward wunner. Perhaps the
Authorities will recollect themselves, and
William Russell also; and consider
whether, in the future cases of neglect or
jobbery that he will assuredly have to point
out to them, it will be of any use to try to
put down the Pen of the War by falsehood
and impertinence, and whether it will not be
better to amend the error and thank the critic.
Proceed, Editor. The name is fortunate,
for you " exhibit" not only our fighting men,
but the folks who make their fighting a
crueller task than it need be. And we
rejoice to see you do it like a true Roman
Editor, per libeUum publici afiixum, and called
the Army and Navy Gazette.
Quite Enough Too.
There is a new paper called The Dial,
which, in its great moderation, tells us it is
published only "once a week for the pre-
sent." We suppose when it becomes a
daily as well as a weekly paper, that it will
change its name then to the Seven Dials?

TWO SWELLS BOW TO LADIES; OLD CLOTBESMAN ACKNOWLEDGES THE SALUTE, MUCH TO SWELLS' ANNOYANCE.
SCOTCHING THE BANKRUPTCY SNAKE.
The Scotch enjoy the reputation of being a long-headed people, but
in the article of conscience they seem singularly short. With the
"Scotch system" of bunking, as exemplified not long since in the
broken Western Bank, our commercial readers doubtlessly are pret ty
well familiar; and we are willing to believe that their familiarity, with
a not less doubtlessness, has been productive of contempt. It now
appears that the "Scotch system" which has been appbed to bank-
ruptcy is fully as contemptible as that applied to banks. Defaulting
English tradesmen make use of this Scotch system as a means of
getting comfortably free of all their creditors, and taking quiet sights
at those who wish to see them safe in quod. As soon as business
blackguards find our soil too hot to hold them, they coolly start away
to Scotland for a change of air, and find the Northern climate most,
refreshing to their pockets. Directly I hey begin to feel shaky in their
credit, they pack up their portmanteaus for a journeying due Nort h,
and don't think of coming back till they are quite set on their legs
again.
With reference to this system, the Times last week informed us
that—
"The trade of the Scotch lawyers in getting English bankrupts quietly out of all
their difficulties ia still raid to be increasing, the decision of the judges at Edinburgh
a few montlia back, which virtually dispensed with the necessity for the parties to
be so designated as to insure their identification by their distant creditors, having
greatly smoothed all such operations. Co long as the system is tolerated, it will
scarcely be necessary for the Government to trouble themselves by proposing any
measure of bankruptcy reform in this country."
The writer of this makes a most judicious choice of words when he
speaks of the Scotch "trade" of getting scoundrels out of difficulties.
A lawyer's business usually is spoken or as his " profession," but when
he does things unprofessional another term should be applied to it. As
in the law's eye the assistant in a crime must share the penalty, so an
attorney who assists in a dishonourable system for the purpose of
assisting swindlers out of punishment, ought in justice to be viewed as
a dishonest trader.
As Scotchmen always stick together, especially in trade, of course
we cannot hope that the Edinburgh judges will alter their decision,
while the Edinburgh lawyers daily fatten on its faults. It remains,
therefore, we think, for the English judges now at once to lay their
wigs together, and devise some means of checking the move of their
Scotch brethren, which is moving all our bankrupts to take tickets for
the North. If this " Scotch system " continue, Scotland will be looked
on as a refuge for our rascals, and a sanctuary or safety-place for those
who swindle us in trade. In fact Edinburgh now is the Gretna Green
of commerce, and is repaired to by all our runaways in debt.
If an English law be passed to check "the trade of Scotch lawyers"
of which the Timet, and every honest tradesman, so complains, we
suppose we shall hear talk about "Another Scottish Grievance," and
be threatened with (at least) Annihilation in revenge. Sandiemon
McLbvi will tear his blue bag into bits, and make oath that for each
shred he'll have a pound of English gold, by way of compensation for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A COOKE'S HEAD ON A CHARGER.
ur excellent friend Me.
William Cooke, the
much respected lessee
of Astley's, announces
his farewell season.
His own benefit, on
the 30th of January,
was, of course, a bum-
per,—ominous as was
the choice of a day
which gives one asso-
ciations with calves'
heads — instead of
Cookes — on chargers.
There is at least one
Cooke who has de-
served well of the pub-
lic. The French talk
of " des ohevaux dresses
pour le manege" but
there is no Cook who
has "dressed" so
much horse-flesh in
this way as the Cooke
in question. Has he
not dished up for us
"Manige horses hot, ma-
ntgt horses cold,
Mantye horses (cream and
■pot) no end of seasons
old!"
Has he not sauced
Shakspearb for us,
like roast beef, with
a spicy sprinkling of
horse- radish, — tossed
up opera a la pas de
Galoppe,—and served
solid pieces de resistance of contemporary military history with a flourish of horse-music,
such as beseems the rough throat of Mars? In short,—though we are not of the Hippo-
phagous school of M. de St.-Hilaire,—may we not say, that Mister Cooke has proved
himself a Master Cook in the composition of his bills of fare at Astley's, of which horse-
flesh has always formed the standing dish? Never were there so many Cookes associated
in any culinary enterprise before, without spoiling the broth. William has been Head
Cooke: but he can boast a numerous train of CooKE-bovs and CooKE-maids: Gallant,
graceful, and agile John Henry- lithe young Alfred, and elastic young Harry; brown-
eyed, round-limbed, and graceful Kate, prettiest of tlaute-fcole icuyires, now lost to the ring
of Astley's, alas! by her suit and service to the ring of Hymen; and Alice, Kate's vounger
sister, as brown-haired, as brown-eyed, and as pretty, but not. quite such a Hippodamia,—
not so consummate a tameress of horses; modest and maidenly Clarissa; and last, not least,
fair, slender, and statuesque Emily, a Hebe on horseback, or an Iris, under the floating arch
of her rainbow scarf!—and even then our catalogue is incomplete. But only think of so
many Cookes, male and female, and not a Plain Cook among them!
It is difficult to conceive an equestrian artist in retirement. Does he always. I wonder,
wear the blue single-breasted coat, white tights, and riding-boots, which are his nearest
approach to the vulgar attire, while in his enchanted state of a slave of the ring? When he
gives an entertainment, is it a "drawing-room one," a la Risi.ey? When he rides to
hounds, does he bound along by the side of his horse, vault over five-barred gates, by aid
of the pummel of the saddle, with a "houp la!" in the manner of the well-known British
Toxhunter of the arena? How does he bring up h:s children? In a series of round turns,
like the professors whom we see tying their infaut progeny in knots round their own necks,
or at. the end of a long pole, like the acrobatic parent, of the side-street pitch? Can he
forbear breaking out, from time to time, in the airy splendour of trunks, alike spanelcd and
scanty, and the statuesque simplicity of fleshings? Does he never take a turn on his lawn,
on summer mornings, as The Grecian Statues t
When brother Cookes encounter, are their greetings like those of common men, or like
those of the "bounding Olympian," or "Athenian" brothers of the Circus—consisting in a
rapid smiting of the chest, a rigid striking of an attitude, a sudden fall of one brother into
the Dying Gladiator pose, and a rearing of the other over him, in the manner of the
Destroying Hercules? But—whatever be the occupations, pleasures, pursuits, of Mr.
Cooke's retirement,— Mr. Punch wishes him wealth, health, long life, and happiness to enjoy
it. He has always—Mr. Punch is pleased to know—maintained the character, which his
family have upheld for generations of equestrian managership. He is a kindly, honest, and
industrious man; a good trainer, a good rider, and has been, in his time, a daring athlete of
the arena; and, crown of all, he is the most affectionate of sons, husbands, fathers, brothers,
and uncles.
Long may his pot boil, while generations of Cookes gather round it—helping to fill,
helping to empty.
A Happy Name.—We notice in the list of the pantomimic company at Drury Lane, the
name of Signor Gratzany. This is as it should be; except that G, r, a, t, is not the way
to spell great.
A. PANEGYRIC ON PARLIAMENT.
The Papers daily I peruse,
Because I wish to learn the news,
That up to last night I may be
Informed in current History.
The Parliamentary Debates
Are quite a feast, which never sales;
As tea and toast or morning roll
Refresh my frame, so they my soul.
As full as any egg of meat,
I find the intellectual treat
Which every omtor affords,
Both in the Commons and the Lords
The speakers, each one, so condense
Their flow of lucid eloquence,
That when I skim it o'er, 1 seem
As though I were enjoying cream.
How many thoughts in words how few,
How many phrases, neat and new,
Which render high conceptions plain,
Their speeches brief and terse contain!
Their logic, too, is oh, how sound!
At once perspicuous and profound,
Close to the point they always keep,
Intelligible when most deep.
No crotchets any men display
In either House; what sense Earl Ghev,
Benowned for colonies improved,
Talked, the Amendment when he moved.
D'Israeli, too, both just and wise,
How fairly does he crit icise
The other party's acts and deeds,
And business ne'er with talk impedes.
The gentlemen from Erin's Isle,
The Powers that be who ne'er revile,
The public weal alone in view,
Contend but for the Good and True.
In every fresh debate I find,
Still something to improve my mind:
The only fault of that good stuff.
Is that I never have enough.
One runs it through a deal too soon,
Sometimes before the afternoon;
All night if members talked away,
The papers we could read all day.
But if they say their say too fast,
The more good measures thence are passed,
Well, therefore, may we be content
With our sententious Parliament.
Simply Idiotic.
Has the beau-temps anything to do with (he
bell-wether?
We decline answering the above question,
because, in our opinion, it is simply idiot ic. We
trust the reader has the good sense to agree
with us.
ONE WORD TO ENGLISHMEN.
A Grand Ship—the grandest the world has
ever heard of—has for some years been ap-
proaching completion. The ship is, and rightly,
a subject of pride to England. A brave man—
held to be the best man that could be found—
has been drowned in the discharge of his duty to
the vessel. He has not died rich, and he has
left a family. Will any one who has stood upon
the deck of the Great Eastern, and considered
what kind of man he should be who could be
entrusted with such a care, willingly omit to aid
l he household that has given—and lost—such a
man? A Harrison Testimonial Fund is opened.
Punch.

A LITTLE TOUR IN FRANCE.
'* Mr. Punch, Sir,
"I am obliged to you for your invitation to me to give you a full and
graphic account of the visit,* which at your request, I have just made to the domi-
nions of the Emperor Louis Napoleon. I am the more obliged because I shall
be enabled to confound certain spiteful parties (this it a very spiteful world,
Mr. Punch) who I find have hinted that my temporary absence from England was
caused by what a recent writer on finance prettily called 'the distuibance of the
desirable equilibrium between receipts ana expenditure.' I paid my laundress
to the last shilling before leaving (including eightpencc for the mending one of
my shoes'), and yet had another with which to guerdon a postman whose Christmas
box I had forgotten. These details may seem trifling, Mr. Punch, but a great man
has said that the Booner a lie is trampled out the better.
"You desired me to go to France and adjust with the Emperor and M. Fould
various points in the Commercial Treaty which were too intricate to be settled by
Mr. Cobden. Had 1 not gone, the Treaty, as you arc aware, would never have
been signed.t
"It may not be necessary for mc to describe minutely my journey to the station
near London Bridge, or my progress by rail to the point of embarkation. Suffice
it to say, that the South Eastern Line performed its engagements with its usual
punctuality, and that I am able to speak in favourable terms of a Bath-bun pur-
chased for me by the obliging guard, at Ashford. The whole of the females who
embarked at, Folkestone had made up their minds to be ill (though the sea was as
calm as your mind, Mr. Punch) and woman, as usual, did what she had determined
to do. Under the circumstances, and believing that you would wish me to escape
observation as far as possible, (though it is difficult for a distinguished-looking man
of thirty-nine % to avoid it,) I felt myself justified in abstaining from offering any
assistance to any of my fellow-passengers, and in enveloping myself in a cloud of
smoke raised by myself in a comfortable corner under the bridge.} The way some

of the foolish persons in the cabin groaned and moaned

a volunteered voyage without making such helpless idiots
of themselves had better stay at home, or seek inland
recreation.
"Moored alongside Boulogne, and the gangway ascended
(ladies with indifferent ancles complain of its steepness), I
passed into the Douane. My ears are keen, and I detected
an affected sternness in the demand of the gendarme who
inquired whether I had a passport. A glance at his face
showed me that my telegram had been received. It was
t he Count de M t, sent on by his imperial patron to
see that no difficulty was thrown in my way. Needless to
say that in another minute I was passed out at the other
door, and amid a chorus of touters recommending the
thousand and one hotels of Boulogne to my patronage, I
caught a well-known voice, that suggested "Hotel du
Nord." Of course he would recommend anything Du
Nord—that Walewski—no admirer of despotism like
vour converted patriot. However, as I knew that he had
been ordered to give me the hint, I took it, the rather
that I have loved Muhlberque's ever since the evening
when at the table d'hote 1 induced the sparkling yet
affectionate Anna Matilda * * * * to own that of

you. I went to the Hotel du Nord, in Five Bob Street,
Boulogne.
"1 shall have occasion hereafter to allude to what I ate
and drank, and therefore will only remark, that my duty
to my country dictated my denying myself nothing that
could tend to make me comfortable and fit for the duty
which you had imposed upon me. But shortly before
eight o'clock I threw over me a noble Inverness cape
(would I could have 'thrown in' some noble Inverness
whiskey, not that the Marasquin was bad, but 'tis woman's
drink, Mr. Punch *), and lighting a cigarette, I proceeded
to the end of the eastern pier. It was deserted. Moonlight
played upon the lapping and plashing billows, and shone
out on the big letters all along the roof of the Imperial
Hotel. The pier lighthouse had been.newly whitewashed,
not without a purpose.
"Lightly humming to myself the favourite French
chanson which I have so often heard on the pier amid
crowds of perfumed and crinolined matrons, Comment
Madame—er, n'avez-vous pas un mart?' I lighted a second
cigarette. The signal was noticed, and in another instant
Three Men stood at the end of that pier, far out in the
waters. The first was your Correspondent. The Second
was M. Fould, who had for some reason disguised himself
as a Jew witli beard and gaberdine. The Third was the
Elected of the Millions! We saluted, and the next
moment M. Fould signed to a sentinel, whom I had not
previously seen, to prevent our being intruded upon. The
order was not in vain, for during our emphatic colloquy
which followed I heard footsteps approaching—some one
was ordered back, and was contumacious. I heard the
bayonet clash, and the intruder splash heavily into the
harbour—but we were engaged on too important a business
to notice trifles.t
"What passed between those Three Men must be
known only by the Treaty. How its provisions were then
discussed and re-discussed will never be known at all.
We drew out our pencils (a gold one handed to me by
the Emperor I shall retain, though I do not approve of
every act of his life }), and the lighthouse, newly while-
teas hed, was covered, as high as the hand could reach, with
our chiffres—our calculations. It was whitewashed again
before the public were admitted in the morning, and as
the whitewashers might have revealed sccrets.they were,
at the conclusion of their job, deported to Cayenne, for

'The Treaty was completed. How the trio spent the

went to the Cathedral, knocked up the Bishop and Chapter, and
made them bring out their richest wines for the Eldest Son of the
Church and his particular friends,—Fould the Jew sneering at the
Church whenever the Emperor wasn't lookiug. All this concerns
nut the public even in an age when Bohemia records whether a public
man takes lemon-juice or lobster-sauce with his salmon. Let me only
say that the Alliance is stronger by the events of that night, and that
M. Fould has solemnly promised me to read Paley's Evidences.
"Which way I returned to my native country matters not. I did
return, and wishing for a quiet day to make up my despatches and
memoranda of what, had occurred, 1 remained at. an English hotel. I
think it was called the Quiutilian. 1 know that it was very com-
fortable, and that though there was only one bell in my bed-room there,
though there were four bells in my bed room in France, that one had
an advantage possessed by none of the four, namely, that it rang.
I know that there was an excellent table d'hote, at which the landlord
of the hotel, a foreign gentleman, took his seat among the guests, and
was the loudest and freest spoken anong that congregation of Swells,
arguing, confuting, and rallying as if he were one of Us. Nay, I was
di lighted to see how the Swells (and there were grand ones) abated
their Anglican haughtiness, and permitted M. Dorenavant to sit
among them in the smoke room, match his experiences with theirs,
travel more miles, catch larger fish, and be cured of more awlul com-
plaints than any of them. They looked surprised, certainly, but tole-
raut, and even permitted themselves to be occasionally amused. Truly
comfortable, also, was the British bed, on which you laid down in
confidence, assured that a battery of springs would not repel you, wit h
a jerk, out of window or into the fireplace. I slept the sleep of the
good.
"I have but one more revelation—a double one—to make, and it is
of a financial character. I went to the French Hotel on a Monday,
and I left it on the following Friday. I Trent to the English Hotel on
a Friday, and left it on the following Saturday. I sought to lire
exactly m the same manner at each place—that is, I had a bed-room,
and took my breakfast and dinner at the puhlic table. 1 was Eighty-
Six Hours at the Frt-nch Hotel, I was Twenty-Six Hours at the
English Hotel. My bill in France for the long term was only twice
my bill in Eugland for the short term. For all I had in three complete
and two incomplete days I was charged no more in France than I was
charged in England for my twenty-six hours. I was perfectly com-
fortable at both places, and I am not complaining in the least, espe-
cially as you, Mr. Punch, have generously paid my expenses.* But the
narrative of a diplomatic mission regarding a commercial treaty may
properly terminate with a financial statement.

Louis Napoleon's Master Stroke.
France, say the French, is Paris: and Paris is, to them, the world: and the

The English may dispute this proposition as they please; but they cannot deny,
that Louis, by a recent act, has shown himself the master of the Winters.
A Fact for Mr. Bowyer.—If there be any truth in the Shakspearian saying
that "uneasy lies the head that wears a crown," we can easily imagine that the
head of the Pore must at present be trebly uneasy, since he wears three crowns.

he lived iu the Portland Road instead of not having the
faintest idea where it is, he would certainly buy his greens

Tue most intimate friend of Garibaldi in this country
was lately observed to look very sad, and to sigh heavily,
at the mention of the General's name.
"Why do you sigh F" he was asked.
"Poor Garibaldi!" he said, and sighed again.
"Poor Garibaldi? Why 'Poor Garibaldi P' Because
he was forced to resign the command iu Central Italy P"
"Worse than that."

"Worse than that."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HOMAGE TO THE PU8LIC SERVICE.
R. Punch is nol, in the
habit of frequently admit-
ting that he is in the wrong.
If he were, he would be in
the habit, of frequently tell-
ing a falsehood. But he
has been sometimes led
into error. Any person can
"sell" an unsuspecting
gentleman, because m good
society frankness and
straightforwardness are
considered proper, and per-
sons do not lie in wait to
snap up one another, where-
as a smart bagman or
shrewd attorney's-clerk is
perfectly unsaleable, and
always wide-awake. Hence
Mr. Punch has once or
twice formed an erroneous
judgment, which he has
freely confessed. There
may nave been half-a-dozen
grains of common sand in
the millions of grains of the
purest gold dust with which
lie has been filling the hour glass of Time for the last eighteen years.
He is now going to own that there is one more sand-grain to account
for. He has been undervaluing the intellectual accomplishments of
members of the public service.
There may be some excuse for him. Certainly, as a general rule,
talkiug to our Public Servants does not impress you with awful respect
for their brains. If you discuss matters with one of those elegant
young public servants from the West, you will be charmed with his
collar, and delighted with his anecdotes of the "Je'tuites de la robe
courte"—usually known as the ballet. If you converse with one of
those smart young public servants from the East, you will be enchanted
with his powers of slang, and instructed by his researches in the
casinoes. If you engage in friendly confabulation with an exciseman,
j ou will be put up to some curious dodges practised in the world he
persecutes, and hear much abuse of his superior officers, and if you
talk to a postman—which you ought not to do when he is on his
rounds—you will hear, with indignation, that he is extremely hard
worked and ill paid. But there is not much in the conversation of
these Public Servants to impress you with a notion of what they must
have learned—of their marvellous knowledge.
Examinations have been heard of, no doubt, and Mr. Punch himself
has given some specimens thereof, in the way of parable and illustra-
tion. But does anybody know the real examination—what its terrors
are—what its tremendous demands P Mr. Punch owns to having under-
valued its awfulness. But happening to take up a book by Mb. John
Boulger, called A Matter Key to Public Offices, in which the author
explains to every ambitious young man in England what he may
get from Government, from Premiership to Postmanship—and how,
Mr.Punch turned to the Specimens of Examination Papers. The real
questions, mind, the real rocks against which Hope has been dashed to
pieces. Among them were some which Mr. Boulger is good enough
to call "easy," but the phrase is a mockery. Look here, fathers—
but you have flinty hearts, and will say. he ought to be able to
answer, after what I've spent on his schools;" no, look here, mothers
of England, and see the questions on which the souls of your darlings
in peg-tops are grated like nutmegs.
To get into the Custom House, a lot of geographical queries are
put, which the victim has "from 24 to 3 hours" to answer. Here is
an easy" one:—
"Which are the highest mountains of Europe P Give approxi-
mately [what's that P] the height of some of them, and of any
of the Scotch or English mountains."
Why a clerk in the Custom-House should have to gaupe mountains,
unless he ascends them in search of smuggled mountain dew, is one
thing; whether Mr. Punch himself could answer the question in any
satisfactory exact way, is another. Yet he has been up Snowdon, and
Mont Blanc, and Etna, and Hecla, and Mount Pleasant. But here is
another:—
"State the greatest length of England,'Ireland, and Scotland
the number of square miles, and the population in each [milep]
according to the last census."
Why, the demand is perfectly insulting. How many fishes are there
in the seaP But now try the Inland Revenue, which means Taxes.
"Name the Independent Sovereigns belonging to the Germanic
Confederation."
If this is to teach the young tax-gatherers to look sharp after sove-
reigns generally, we can understand it. But what's this for ?—
"On a rough outline map of India mark the positions of Agra,
Lahore, Cape Cormorin, the Kistnah, the Godavery, Assam,
and the Run of Cutch."
The Run of Cutch, indeed! The run of kegs might be more to Hie
purpose, t hough t hat should be asked of the Customs-candidate. Who,
of Mr. Punch's readers reading the above, can comply wit h the demand r
Upou honour, now, what's the Kistnah, Viscount Williams? Yet
you have obtained a gaudy coronet.
Let us pass to History. The fourth demand is,—
"Give an account of the Star Chamber, the Constitutions of
Clarendon, the Petition of Right, the Habeas Corpus Act."
Would the examiners be merciless if a poor bewildered lad, after
looking at them tearfully, should write—
The Star Chamber was a celebrated Observatory, Lord Claren-
don has a very good constitution, I see in the paper yesterday as the
Petition of Right was wrong, and going to be knocked up in Parlia
ment, and the Habeas Corpus Act is a blessed invention P"
Would he be plucked, or would they try him again with—
"State, distinctly, the claims asserted by Edward the Fourth
and his rivals, respectively, to the throne of England" P
Or would they give him one more chance ?—
"Give an account of the political and social state of England
(1) at the Accession of Hknrv the Eighth, (2) at the date
of the Restoration."
But that is nothing. Talk to a War-Office Clerk, next time you
meet him at Paddy Green's, and ask him this. He has answered it,
so must be able to do it again.
"Who were the contending parties in the following battles :—
Marathon, Cannes, Uerda, Granicus, Chteronea, Pavia, Vitto-
ria, Marengo, Borodino, Megiddo. Describe minutely the
circumstances and results of any three, and in all cases give
the dates."
If the War-Office Clerk answers you except by a libation of Mr
Green's excellent stout in your face, you ought to stand him poached
eggs, or any other delicacy he may put, a name to. And then when he
is in a very good humour, ask him what he answered to this:—
"Sketch the history of the Pelopounesian War, mentioning the
States concerned in it, the chief men who took part iu it, and
its results."
And then, perhaps, you had better change the subject, and remark
upon the excellence of the beer.
But suppose a candidate wants to get into Somerset House, he
must be prepared for this:—
"I buy wine of A. for £50, and sell it to B. for £55. B. gives me
a bill for £25 and cash for £30. and I pay A. on account.
Give the journal entries A. and B. would make for these
transactions."
We sadly fear the "journal" would run this way. "Told A. I'd
give him £50 for his wine, hut it was such fishy stuff I offered it to B.
for £55. He forked out £30, and gave me a bill for £25, and as he '11
find out the bad swizzle before that's due, 1 shall never get a shilling of
that, so I gave his bill to A. and spent the tin, and that matter's off
my mind."
But, finally and lastly, what do you, young friends, say to this P—
"Take three hours, and write a comparison between the English na-
tional character, and that of any other people, ancient or modern."
You can't do it in three hours. But perhaps the Examiners would
let you do it in three minutes, from some nursery reminiscences:—
"Two skinny Frenchmen and one Portmruee,
One jolly Englishman will lick 'cm all three."
"Write an account of any part of Great Britain or Ireland with
which you are acquainted with special reference to the agri-
culture or commerce there carried on, and the social state
and manners of the population."
The following is the specimen of a reply to this inquiry, and the
candidate was instantly recommended to office:—
"Well, I don't know. There's Squashford where I was raised. As

haven't got it, but it's coming next week if you please. The population
are not social at all but quite the reverse, and as for manners, my eye.
an educated bear beats 7em to fits. 1 don't know the latitude and
longitude, but it'son the South-Northern line, and a precious dirty
walk from the station."
But has not Mr. Punch made out his proposition that men who have
taken such honours ought to be held in honour P Henceforth, he takes
off his hat whenever he sees a Public Servant.

MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT.
Ye who rfjoice in beer and pipes,
You ought not to repine.
But be right glad if British swipes
Compete with light French wine;
Because the contest will be, which
Potation shall prevail.
And small beer then will grow more rio'i,
And men brew better ale.
Brew better ale, I will repeat,
Not bitter, understand,
Beyond the flavour, counted meet,
Of old, in English land;
The taste of sound and wholesome hops;
And we shall fill our jugs
With nappy ale, instead of slops
Imbued with foreign drugs.
Big Brewers will, by cheap Bordeaux,
To look alive be made,
For fear that they should little jrrow,
Through falling off of trade;
And publicans will take some care
To sell their porter pure,
When people will no longer bear
The stuff they now endure.
Good Beaune will better bad brown Muuf,
Light Macon when we get
At lower price, it will, no doubt,
Improve our heavy wet.
The stingo of our sires of old,
That made their noses shine,
Again in England will be sold,
Along with cheap French wine.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
he Chancellor {Monday.
January 30) introduced
some Bills for consolidating
and assimilating (nice long
words, are they not P) the
criminal law of England and
Ireland. It is characteristic
of lawyers that they must
actually make some bills,
instead of one, even for the
act of consolidation. The
omen is notpropitious. The
only point Lord Campbell
explained was, that, by one
of these bills, conspiracy to
murder in Ireland is to be
made a lighter offence than
at present, which alteration
seems hardly necessary, con-
sidering that a shot from
behind a hedge at an un-
armed man is already re-
garded as a legitimate over-
ture for a re-adjustment of
terms with a landlord. The
Bishop of London referred
to the means by which it is
sought to restore the purity
of Protestant worship in
St. George's in the East; namely, the tearing up seats, destroying
railings and lamps, and sending Bibles and Prayer-books flying about
i he church, amid the shouts and yells of ticket-of-leave Luthers and
Calvins from the House of Correction, and his Lordship wished to
know whether the Government had anv intention of dealing with this
Revival. Lord Granville thought the demonstrations objectionable,
but could not say what would be done, and a similarly satisfactory
answer was obtained in the other House from the Home Secretary.
Guatemala is in Central America, and adjoins the British Honduras.
It is an independent republic of the Human Catholic persuasion.
Lord Malmesbury thought, very properly, that it would be an
extremely good thing to define the boundaries between ourselves and

the Guatemalakites, for there is no knowing in these days when a
squabble may arise. So not only do we pay the expenses of the survey,
but those of the survev for a road entirely in our neighbour's territory.
However, it is a small matter, and one in which a great neighbour,
like England, can well afford to assist a small one. Lord John
Russell explained this, but he did not say, possibly because he was
not asked, why the Guatemala cigars are not better than they are. It
is impossible to smoke above a dozen or so of them in the evening
without getting a headache.
Mr. Edwin James asked Lord Palmerston why a new Chief
Commissioner of Works was not appointed. The Premier said he
intended to appoint one directly, meantime the ex officio Commissioners
were competent to do anything necessary. In that case, what was
the use of filling up the office P Lord Palmerston has ordered back
the shrubs and flowers in the Park which were grubbed up last year
in a way that nearly produced a revolution, and has made his step-son,
Mr. Cowper, the Chief Commissioner.
The Home Secretary introduced the meekest of all conceivable
bills for reforming the City of London Corporation. It does not touch
a single point that people care about, the coal duties, the metage dues,
or the other civic extortions, and simply deals with the constitution of
the corporation, as if any reasonable person knew or cared whether a
Sword-Dearer elected an Alderman, or a Remembrancer elected a
Beadle, or Gog elected Magog, or the reverse. The whole Corporation
is a Sham. Where were the bloated Fathers of the City when they
allowed the Gas Companies to consolidate, and get it into their power,
if they took offence, to turn out all our lights, like a sulky waiter in a
billiard-room, or to send us like naughty boys to bed in the dark. If
the wretched Aldermen had stood forward, and tried to protect London
against such a clique, they might have done some good. As it is, wc
earnestly hope that the gas may all be turned off in the Mansion
House some night, with an awful smell, just as they are getting into
their second help of turtle. The House scoffed at the Bill, let it come
in, and then applied itself with more gusto to a personal row about the
last election jobbing connected with the mail-packet service. A com-
mittee on the subject had been appointed last year, and Sir H. Wil-
loughby, one of the members, bore testimony to the fact, that it had
paid attention to the squabbles only, and not the least to the public
interests.
Tuesday. The Shipping Interest bewailed and bemoaned itself,
through Mr. Lindsay and some others, and demanded a Committee
to inquire into its afflictions. Milner Gibson, for Government, did
not see that ft had much to howl about, but granted the reouest. if

there was a Committee to inquire into the grievances of emigrants
and others who go out in the ships of the Shipping Interest, and who
are exposed to insult from the officers, outrages from the sailors,
neglect by drunken or ignorant surgeons, and bad and insufficient food
from the cooks, there would be a pleasant story to tell of a good many
of the vessels whereby these bleating shipowners make their fortunes.
Ms. Mellob brought in a bill for trying what the criminal law would
do upon bribers and bribed. The , House laughed, but had not the
indecorum to refuse to admit the measure.
Wednesday. Mb. M'Mahon moved the second reading of a Bill for
giving an Appeal in Criminal Cases. The Home Secretary, who is
the Appeal, opposed the measure, as unnecessary, as objected to by the
highest .legal authority, as calculated to diminish a juror's feeling of
responsibility, and as interfering with the execution of justice. He
was supported by several speakers competent to give an opinion, and
the Bill was rejected. It is noteworthy that, at these Wednesday
sittings, when Members assemble in the daylight, and talk before din-
ner, the most rational and thoughtful speeches are made, and the
House becomes really a deliberative council.
Thursday>. Lord St. Leonards, in a confidential whisper, explained
U> Lords Brougham and Campbell the provisions of a Real Property
Bill, and they declared themselves delighted. When the secret of the
character of the Bill is revealed, Lord Punch will be happy to add his
opinion to that of his two noble and learned brethren.
Mb. Disraeli demanded of Loud John Bussell what was going
on about Savoy. Lord John stated that Lord Cowley had told the
French Government that we should disapprove Savoy's being grabbed
by our friend L. N. Mb. Wise then made a very impertinent motion.
He asked for a Committee that should be a sort of Audit Office (only
not useless as a check, like the Audit Office opposite the Edinburgh
Castle), and see, annually, how the Government had really applied the
money they had taken on account of the Miscellaneous Estimates.
Naturally, the Government resented this; but the House did not think
the proposal by any means an absurd one, and voted the Committee
by 121 to 93. Evidently the age is losing all its good manners. To
think of asking Lords and Honourable Gentlemen whether they have
xpplicd the people's money for the purposes for which it was given!
We wonder some of the eminent Swells did not resign, rather than
take salary from such vulgarians as their paymasters.
Beverley is so abominably corrupt a place, that the gentleman who
was defeated there last week declared he was afraid to petition against
his victorious Conservative antagonist, for fear that the town should be
disfranchised. Therefore the prosecuting two unlucky Liberals, fur
bribing for their man at the preceding election, does not seem likely to
do much in the way of purification, but it can do no particular harm,
and was directed this evening.
Mr. Hubbard introduced so reasonable a Bill on the subject of
Church Rates, that it would be unreasonable to expect it to pass.
Any person signing a declaration that he is not a Member of the
Church is to be exempt from church-rates, and church affairs are of
course to be managed only by those who pay. And a committee was
appointed to inquire into the mode of making anchors and chain cables
for the Merchant Service; a very right thing; for it seems that Com-
merce supplies our ships with bad metal, andthen when the storm and
stress come, miserable catastrophes occur, all that Commerce may
carry extra profit to her account. To Sir James Elp'hinstone belongs
the credit of demanding this investigation, and having been a sea-
captain he knew what he was talking about.
Friday. Who says that the Peers of England are not affable? They
condescended to receive a petition from a law-stationer in Chancery
Lane, who complains that the Holborn end of that evil thoroughfare is
so narrow that traffic is impeded, and cabmen are quarrelling there all
day. As Lawyer Laue is W.C. (remember it by Wicked Cheats) we
suppose the City Corporation have nothing to do with it, or we might
have recommended that some of the plunder the greedy Fathers of the
City collar, by letting St. Paul's be blocked up by new warehouses,
should be applied to doing away with so much of the nuisance of
Chancery Lane as is of an inorganic kind. However, we do not see
very much in the grievance, because any impediment to the usual run of
professional business in Chancery Lane must be a benefit to society
generally.
Lord Palmebston made a pleasant little joke when explaining all
about the Great Shrub and Flower in the Park Question. He said it
had been alleged that the despoiled part was to be made a nursery.
In one sense it was true, "for a nursery was a place full of children."
The mammas in the Lady's Cage laughed out delightfully at such wit,
nod as Punch is notoriously the only printed reading for which Lord
P. has time, the latter will perceive with gratitude that his friend and
Mentor has embalmed the epigram. Lord John Russell answered
Serjeant EOthen that he had no call to be alarmed at French military
or naval preparations, and Sir G. C. Lewis stated that the laws of
Jersey were being inquired iuto, with a view to the civilisation of that
island at some future time. If anybody wants to know what a Petition
of Right is, Mr. Punch apprises him that inasmuch as the Queen is
our Sovereign Lady and Mistress and Supreme Head and Governess,
if wrong has been done to any of us in her name, we do not sue her
as if she were our equal, but by a more respectful process, in short by
asking her leave to have the matter inquired into. The Queen replies,
"Let Right, and not my subject, be Done." Mb. Bovill is passing
a meritorious Bill for simplifying the proceedings. Mr. Bottvebie
growled at the number of speeches that had been made that evening,
and the Viscount op Lambeth growled at Mr. E. Bouvebie. Sib
Ricuabd Bethell was unfortunately ill, so the Bankruptcy Reform
was postponed. And now for the Budget and Reform, unless Ministers
break up on the question of the Emferob Napoleon's European policy,
on which it is said they arc quarrelling like fun, four against ten, but
then three of those four (L. N.'s friends), the three best men in the
Cabinet, P n, R ll, and G E. Qui vitra verra, but it is a
great bore to have changes just as one has got a nice new Dod.
ALLOCUTION ON THE UNIFERS.
Pius Punch, P. P.
The suppression of the Unicers caused our paternal heart severe
affliction, but we derived an equal amount of consolation from the
subjoined telegram :—
"Bmuetg, Jan. 27.
*' The Univert, which has just beea suppressed by the French Government, will
be continued here."
We are wonderfully reassured in mind by this comfortable intelli-
gence. When first we heard of the tyrannical decree which imposed
silence on the organ of our beloved priesthood, we almost began to
despair of the continued edification which, in common with all our
faithful subscribers, we have so often derived from accounts of appa-
ritions such as that of La Salette, and miracles of the nature of the
winking image of Rimini. We feared that we should never more be
agreeably astonished by those wonderful shots with the long bow. or
amused with those more subtle and profound inventions, with which
we had been accustomed to be entertained by our excellent Veuillot.
We were very much afraid that we should cease to be charmed with
that eloquent vituperation of which he is endowed with so singular a
talent. But now we are enabled to indulge tho pleasing hope that,
with a change only of place, his pious zeal will continue to supply us
with the customary recreation which has so often occasioned our bosom
to expand, and our sides to be convulsed with merriment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EIGHTEEN PENN'ORTH OF SNUFF.
The following advertisement lately appeared in the Halesicorth
Times:—
PROFITABLE EMPLOYMENT.—Persons in search of employment,
either as a source of income or to fill up their leisure hours, may hear of such,
by which means £2 to Mi a week may be realised in town or country by either sex,
fetation in life immaterial, by applying to Mr. H. Harvey, 35, Upper lielgravo Place.
Pirolico, London, enclosing eighteen postage stamps, with a stamped directed
cnTclopo for reply."
This notification was given to the reporters hy the Magistrate of
the Westminster Police Court, Mb. Paynter, to whom it had been
sent by a gentleman who had tried the experiment of writing to Mr
Harvey and enclosing a feeof eighteen postage stamps.to see what would
come of it. Nothing came; no reply to the first letter, nor any to t wo
others afterwards written. Mr. Superintendent Gums, B, sent by
Mr. Paynter to look after Mr. Harvey, of course discovered that
"no such person as Mr. Harvey resided at 35, Upper Belgrave
Place, Pimlico." The Superintendent was, however, informed that
letters addressed to that gentleman "were regularly fetched away by
a man well known as one of a gang of persons who had for a length of
time been carrying on a system" described as "of thisBort;" which
may perhaps be supposed to mean a system of obtaining money under
false pretences.
Mr. Harvey, of somewhere else than 35, Upper Belgrave Place,
Pimlico, and rejoicing peradventure in an alias as well as an alibi,
must not be indistinctly pronounced a rogue. He differs, at any
rate, from a common rogue, and though he may be deemed an
uncommon rogue, there is some doubt whether he is exactly a rogue
in law. Those who send him eighteen postage stamps, and receive no
reply are answered by his silence. By saying nothing, he tells them
t hat he has got the stamps: which would have been returned by the
Post Office, if he had not received them. They are thus instructed
that, if they are seeking a source of income, they may find it in
postage stamps, and that, if they wish to fill up their leisure hours,
they may follow his example, and employ all or part of the time at
their disposal in putting advertisements such as his own in the pro-
vincial papers. Are the pretences on which money is thus obtained
false? We must recollect the lesson inculcated on our youthful minds
by the copy-books, and "Condemn not hastily."
feeling fettered by their clothing, our fathers, like their children, often
stripped to fight; and hence C.ssar, when he landed, thought the
I natives all lived naked. This however, as it proved, was as preposterous
a notion as it would be now to fancy that Tom Sayers hath no toggery,
should one see him stripped for fighting the Benicia Be-hoy. Like
the Cyclops, nudus membra, when he turned out for a scrimmage, the
Ancient Briton when at home received his callers with his clothes on;
and there is very little doubt that the P. R. of the period indulged in
"fancy" dresses, which were gaudy if not neat.
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER II.—THE ANCIENT BRITISH PERIOD—(Continued).
S we have said, the Ancient
Britons were fond of wear-
ing paint; in which respect
they have been followed by
some few (say a dozen) of
their feminine descendants.
Whether the ladies then
made use of it. to "give
themselves a colour," and
thought that by so doing
they added to their charms,
is a matter for conjecture
to those who choose to
think about it. If the fact
were really so, and the
gentlemen approved of it,
the paint is doubtless no-
ticed in the love-songs of
the period. For such a
phrase, for instance, as
She's all my fancy
Painted her!" there would then have been a somewhat colourable
pretext •. and seeing that sky-blue was the colour most in fashion, a
sentimental songster might have written of his mistress :—
Marked you her cheek of heavenly blue,
Her nose-tip of cerulean hue,
Her chin of that same colour too?"
As this blue paint, we are told, was made from a plant called
"woad," we cannot wonder that the wearers got the epithet of
"woaden-headed:" and to quote, with fit disgust, another vile pun of
the period, their public singers, it is said, washed their faces Wore
singing, lest wags among the audience should bid them not to "holler"
till they had got clear of the "woad."
But it must not be imagined that the clothing of our ancestors con-
sisted only in their colouring, and that their dress-coats were merely
coats of paint. The Romans, it is true, at first inclined to this idea;
but, like some one or two of the Idee* of Napoleon, their idea, as it
turned out, was utterly unfounded. The fact was simply this, that,


ANCIENT BRITON IN COMPLETE ARMOUR.
While the lower orders dressed in little else than paint and bear
!>kin (the latter bearing proof that bears abounded then in England;
though, except upon Stock Exchange, there are none left living now),
the gents and upper classes came out much more extensively, and
were clothed from top to toe in a variety of vestments, which with the
help of the old writers we may venture to describe.
Commencant par le fin, we incline to think their "fins," like their
faces, were left naked, inasmuch as we can find no mention made of
gloves, and may guess that, like umbrellas, they had not been yet dreamt
of. Nor can we say much about the boots of the Old Bricks,* seeing
that it is doubtful if they'd any boots at all: aud for want of our
Balmorals, for ought we know, the dandies may have sported blacked-
up bare feet. Some of the swells, however, wore a kind of shoe, which
being made of neat skin, made their feet perhaps look neat: but
whether their possessors used to put their shoes for "Boots" to
clean, outside their bedroom doors, is a point which Diodo(o)rus has

said nothing to clear up. That, they wore bracc<e, or breeches, is placed
(of course) beyond dispute by the fact that Mr. Martial mentions
that they did; but he quite omits to tell us, whether or no the gentle-

men monopolised the use of them, or if the privilege of wearing them
was extended to the ladies. That they wore a tunic also is equally
indisputable, inasmuch as it is mentioned both by Pliny and
Herodian: and over this the swells threw &sagum or short cloak,
which in the Celtic was called taic—a word which seems to throw
some light upon the nature of the garment, as it corresponds exactly
to our gentisn "sack." Posterity, however, is completely in the dark
as to whether the old Britons used braces for their braccee, or whether
they suspended them by buttons to the tunic, in the fashion of the
modern "roley-poley" suit.
Perhaps, however, the most curious part of their costume was the
article of clothing which they used by way of head-cover. This was
called a cappan, from the Ancient British cab, a word which meant,
however, not a hansom, but a hat. It was called so, we are told,
because its shape was conical, and bore resemblance to a roof; and
this explains the ancient jokes by which the modern gent now calls his
hat a tile," or, still more reconditely, alludes to it as "thatch."
We believe the Ancient Britons wore their hair in the old way;
that is to say, not having hair-cutters they never had it cut. It was
turned back, we are told, upon the crown of the head, and fell behind
in bushy curls which "oftte dydde tangle inne y' bushes." We are
not quite so well up in our Cesar as we might be, although we had
his writings literally "at our fingers ends" at school, and our fingers'
ends long tingled with the raps his volumes gave us. But we believe
that writer says there's nothing new beneath the Sun, and if he
doesn't he has certainly recorded that which proves it. By what we
learn from him we
find that our recent
Moustache Move-
ment has been only
a revival, and has
restored to us a
fashion which we
fondly thought was
new. The Mous-
tache Mover in fact
is nothing hut a
plagiarist. Tell it not
in Regent Street!
the Ancient British
Swells did precisely
as the moderns do;
that is to Bay, they
shaved the chin, but
wore immensely long
moustaches. Strabo
describes those of
the dwellers in the
Scilly Isles as ac-
tually "hanging
down upon their
breasts like wings;"
in which respect
—with all regard for
Regent Street we
say it—we think
these Scilly fellows
were quite worthy
of their name.
As to the dress
worn by the women very little can be said, inasmuch as, it is feared,
there was but very little of it. Books of fashion were not written
so profusely then as now: and even Cesar, though he penned
a volume De Bell. Gall., had scarce the gallantry to mention a sinele
belle or gal in it. Perhaps it may have been his modesty which
caused his silence on the subject: for, so far as we can learn, the
costume which was mostly worn by Ancient Britonesses was cut much
in (he same fashion as the dress of that young lady, of whom the poet
tells us that—
"A single pin at night undid
Tho robo that veiled her beauty :"
Or, as pins were probably not known in that blest age, a thorn may
be assumed to have been used by way of fastening. Of course there
were however some exceptions to this rule (for when were women,
except sisters, ever known to dress alike f) and compared to the mere
commonalty, and maids-of-all-work of the period, the swellesses, we
find, were really splendidly got up, considering, that is, the early time
of their up-getting. Dion Cassius informs us that Queen Boadicea
came out, like Miss Dinah, in most "gorgeous array," for she wore a
torque of gold, and a many-coloured tunic, and over it a robe of coarse
stuff, fastened by a brooch.
At this mention of a brooch we may fitly broach the question as to
what were the chief ornaments which were used by our great, great—
we really can't enumerate how many times great—grandmothers: and
if it be no fib, we find that besides fibula, they wore necklaces and

armlets, both having been discovered in the early British barrows,
which for purposes of digging resemble the Welsh wheals. Whether,
although their wardrobes were but scantily supplied, dress much occu-
pied the thoughts and conversation of our ancestresses, is a point which
being moot, we shall ourselves be mute upon. But as women then
tcere women, one might fancy that it did; and one might make a fancy-
sketch of a tea-party of the period, whereat these ancient ladies met to
talk about their torques.
A SCHOOLMISTRESS ABROAD.
The fact is scarcely worth our notice, but now we think of it per-
haps we may as well just mention it. that one very often finds the very
funniest advertisements are those which are quite clearly meant to be
most serious. Here, for instance, is a specimen of the strict scholastic
sort, which {uomiite mutato) lately edified the readers of a rural weekly
print:—
fTHE Duties of Mrs. Stuitem's Establishment for Young Ladies will
-1 bo RESUMED D V. J.xuaby 19th. 1860.
The patronage which has Iwcn bestowal, and the success which lias attended
Mrs SruFFEM'a system of Tuition, form for the i'arcnu a guarantee for the im-
provement and happiness of their children.
The course of education comprises music, singing, drawing, the modern languages,
every branch of useful study, plain and ornamental needlework
Terms, moderate, forwarded on application ; also references if desired to the
parents of pupils in Great Britain and tlio Colonies.
At the request of numerous friends, Africans of Colour are not admitted.
This composition is remarkable not less for its omissions than it is
for its redundancies. Of the latter, the "D.V." is a conspicuous
example, inasmuch as nothing cm be done without God's will, and to
refer to it thus specially is needless and profane. Equally redundant
is the mention of the plain and ornamental needlework," which of
course must be regarded as extremely "useful study," and would
clfarly be included if "every branch" thereof were taught.
Coming now to the omissions, we have to ask Mas. Stufkm, for a
key to her fourth sentence; which, if taken as a sample of her English
composition, does not say much for the way in which "the modern
languages" are taught at her establishment. Her Grammar in fact
seems to be as "moderate" as her terms, and it bewilders us to guess
whether the "parents" or the "pupils are "iu Great Britain and
the Colonies;" and whether it be to them, or whom, that she will for-
ward references should they be desired. We are, however, still more
puzzled by the words which Mrs. Stuffem uses for a climax, and
which point out au omission we should like her to supply. In saying
that "at the request of numerous friends" [of whom f] she has uo
admittance for Africans of Colour," she darkly hints at the existence
of Africans not coloured, to whom there is no bar to entrance at her
school. Where on earth uucoloured Africans are to be found, she does
not tell us, and we are driven to our wits' end to guess about their
whereabouts. We have heard of an attempt to scrub the black out of
a blackamoor, and if the trial had succeeded we might think uucoloured
Africans were some of its results. The experiment, however, as JLsop
tells us, failed; nor so far as we can learn, has it ever been repeated.
We are therefore in the dark about uncoloured Africans, and it would
much relieve our mind if Mrs. Stwffem would enlighten us. Were
she to tell where they are visible, we would go and take a sight at
them; indeed, we would endeavour, on some colourable grounds, to
bring the whitest of them over to imke at once a public exhibition of
himself. In a country where while blackbirds are thought great
curiosities, mints of money might be made by showing a blanched
blackamoor, which we fancy that an African without colour would be.
Election Colours.
"It appears to nie," quoth Lord Paljierston, in the debate on
Mk. Mellor's Bribery at Electious Bill, "that in several places
i he Electors—especially those of the lower class—do not look upon the
receipt of a bribe as an offence of that moral dye which we consider it
to be." We should much like to know the colour of the " moral dye"
w;hich—to the eye of the House of Commons—invests bribery at
Elections. We should be inclined to think it something like an
"invisible green."
Ask the Clerk of the Weather.
A Meteorological article discourses eloquently on the "mean
quantity of rain" that fell during the month of January. Our rheu-
matic recollections prompt us in justice to remark, that the quantity of
rain that fell during that aquatic month was far too copious and liberal
to deserve such an ignominious epithet as "mean."

FISCAL FUN AND FROLIC.
*' Mb. Punch,
"Cheap wine is a very desirable thing; for my
own part there is no commodity that I am more anxious
to procure at a low price. I like wine; and the fact is,
that I enjoy a very comfortable income, which consists
partly of the interest of a large sum in the 3 per cent.
Consols, partly of the rent of many acres of arable land
and pasture. Therefore I shall not at all care how much
t he Income-Tax is raised in order that the duty on Claret
may be lowered to a proportionate degree. I am only
sorry that any duty on wine whatever is to be retained ac
all, for the purpose of revenue, because the direct taxation
of income would answer that, at least as far as I am con-
cerned, with my income alone taxed aud my capital escaping.
"Raising the Income-Tax in order to cheapen luxuries
just suits my convenience, and I also look upon it as a good
practical joke at the expense of those who earn every far-
thing which they receive; for, in taxing their whole uncer-
tain means at the same rate as that which is imposed upon
only a part of my secure and handsome independence, the
Legislature takes away money which they ou^ht to lay by,
whilst, on the other hand, by offering them wine and other
good things at a reduced cost, it proposes, as compensation
for its seizure of their savings, encouragement to spend
the remainder of their income.
"I am, &c. &c,
'JUSTITIA."
Volunteer (he or THE 'Tastet' Uniform). "And it's so comfortable and easy,
that J shall most decidedly 'shoot' in it next Season."
A New Sensation at the Haymarket.
The Stranger has been revived at the Haymarket, amid
sympathetic cries of " Welcome Little Stranger!" Miss
Amy Sedgwick has been playing Mrs. Halter with great
success. "Excelsior!" should, however, be the maxim
observed in theatricals, as in most other affairs. What
a capital play the Stranger would be, if Mr. Buckstone
himself would but perform the principal male character!
The Silent City.—We read that in Rome all cries, no
matter of what kind, are prohibited. We certainly envy
the Holy City in that one respect. We only wish that no
cries were allowed in the streets of London.
THE CEITIC; OR, A TRAGEDY HEARSED.
Lawyers should teach justice, and Priests should teach kindness.
Yet to be between the two (we are going to speak of our contemporary
the Critic, who is ajjfchi between the Late Times and the Clerical Journal,
at a big bouse in the Strand) does not always induce either justice or
charity. Theatrical "notices" are often curious things, comprehen-
sible only by those who know tchy one author is "let down easy," and
another fustigated: why a long piece at one theatre is briefly dis-
missed, and a short one at another treated at vast and complimentary
length; and ichy a failure occurring at one house is plainly told, and
delicately left to inference if occurring at another. Human nature
solves those problems, if one has the key. But why a piece that has
not been produced should be stated to have come out, and been a
failure, we do not know. Nevertheless, such was the statement of the
Critic in regard to the Lyceum version of the Tale of Two Cities,
The work was not produced until Monday, the 30th, but on the
preceding Saturday the Critic recorded its production, and failure.
This curious circumstance we cannot explain. Nor is much more
light thrown upon it by the statement of a gentleman who was the
theatrical critic to the Critic. He says that he wrote to the Office of
the journal that" the Tale of Ttco Cities had failed him," (meaning
that it had not come out) "and therefore he had nothing to write
about." But the Editor, it seems, preferred to write what appeared.
Would it be taking too great a libert y to ask his reasons? We make
the request for them as respectfully as Sancho's—" Why did your
ladyship come by land from the place, seeing that it is an island P"
Why did your Editorship say that the piece bad come out and failed,
when it had not even come out P May we hear?
WISE BETIMES.
It will generally be remarked, that in moving for an annual Select
Committee to inquire into the Miscellaneous Civil Service Expenditure
of the year preceding, Mr. Wise acted with suitable wisdom. The
fact that the motion was carried is truly cheering; for an ever
increasing outlay, accompanied by a constantly re-imposed Income-
Tax, frightful in amount, and outrageously unjust, has plunged the
mind of everybody but the careless millionaire into an abyss of
despondency. The present House of Commons is not a year old; but
it is beginning to take notice. If its existence were to be prolonged,
it would perhaps proceed farther in the path of an inquiring mind. It
would want to know something, also, about the details of our Military
and Naval Expenditure, which is so vast compared with the moderate
strength of our National Defences which we have to show for it. But
when this House shall have been dissolved, Reform will furnish us
with another, which, we trust, will prove even yet sharper in its
infancy than its juvenile predecessors, and constitute a real addition to
our political happiness.
The Successor of the Fisherman's Billingsgate.
M. Grandquillot, in the Constitutionnel, quotes Bossuet to prove
that the Pope has no power "over things temporal and civil." The
language in which his Holiness has lately been indulging more than
confirms the position of the Bishop of Meaux; for it shows that the
mccessor of St. Peter cannot even keep a civil tongue in his head.
Deux Rues Incomprises.
There is a street in Paris called Rue Lord Byron (Colonel Waugh
lives there in luxury and defiance of his creditors, but that's not the
matter now) and Frenchmen point to that Rue, and take credit to
themselves for paying proper homage to the name of a great poet,
though of another nation. Furthermore, they remark that London
pays no such compliment to a bard of France. Mr. Punch, in the
interest of literature and alliance, begs to deny this latter proposition
entirely. Cornhill is simply the Anglican pronunciation of Corneille,
and you can scarcely hear a person in London directing another with-
out hearing " that is the Way Hugo."
Large Designs.—Louis Napoleon, having failed in setting the
Thames on fire, has been obliged to content himself with crushing
"the Universe."

THE SOLDIER'S LIFE PRESERVER.
One of the most efficient weapons of the British soldier
is his belt. It is a heavy leather strap, armed with a
massive buckle, and, when wielded by the strong: arm of
a grenadier, will cut an enemy's head open, and inflict upon
him other dreadful injuries. Its efficiency is most remark-
able in a melie, wherein it enables a powerful man to pros-
trate surrounding adversaries right and left, mutilating and
maiming them with the severest lacerated wounds. At the
Middlesex Sessions, the other day, two privates in the
Guards, George Hales and Ciiari.es Humphreys, were
convicted of demonstrating the effects of these weapons
on the persons of certain policemen and others, and have,
consequently, obtained twelve months' release from mili-
tary duty and the same period of employment in hard
labour. The gallant fellows mistook surrounding circum-
stances for those of the field of battle, or the storming of
a town, whilst in a state of intoxication. Had they hap-
pened to be wearing their bayonets, they would no doubt
have used them instead of their belts, and it would have
been as well if they had, because a bayonet inflicts a wound
much less nasty than a strap and a brass buckle, and is of
the two the preferable instrument of offence for a soldier
to exercise on his fellow citizens. If, therefore, the belts
are to be worn any longer by our private heroes about
the streets, the bayonets likewise had better be added;
because the belt without the bayonet looks absurd:
whereas, in the hands of a drunken ruffian, it is equally
formidable.

THE INCOME-TAX FOR EVER.
You struggling traders who subsist on small uncertain gain.
And you who live from hand to mouth by art, or toil of brain,
Prepare for more extortion; for the pressure of the screw
Of Income-Tax untempered, to be put again on you.
Yon wretches, who for feeble age a pittance fain would save,
To ease your downward passage, as you totter to the grave,
Prepare to have your earnings wrung from year to year away,
Whilst merely on the fruit of wealth the rich not more will pay.
Prepare from this or that mischance, to see your pittance stop;
Prom broken health, or brain o'erworked, or failure of the shop;
Then hey for workhouse or for gaol! since now the means are gone,
Whereby, if saved, through time of need you might have struggled on.
The Income-Tax will take them; will prevent the little hoard
Which should against the evil day in health and strength be stored;
And you will thirst and hunger, of your pay and work nereft,
Because the State has taxed your all, and you have nothing left.
But then your jolly neighbour there will eat and drink his fill;
He'll not have lost his income: no, he'll live in clover still.
No need had he for saving aught—a man of land and rents.
His name is written in the Bank—the Book of Three-per-Cents.
He pays the tax that you do now; as much; no more nor less;
Ana he will be in comfort then, whilst yon are in distress:
And then your consolation will—as fiscal sages say—
Be, now that you are ruined, you '11 have no more tax to pay.
Meanwhile at such a prospect lest'your heart, perchance, should sink,
To give you consolation you'll have cheap Bordeaux to drink,
And with that acid draught you may wash down your bitter pill,
And so spend all the Income-Tax will spare you, if you will.
Now are not these good tidings, far too pleasant'to be told
In the harsh, croaking, raven's voice of one who has a cold?
And was it not worth while to wait until, in accents clear,
A sweet financial singer could discourse them to the ear?
They whom the Gods do love die young—by them of old 'twas said;
Than outlive health and strength, they thought, 'twas better to be
dead;
Heaven for an early tomb you now have greater cause to thank;
The Income-Tax will let you put no money in the bank.
Thus left without provision since you'll be in Life's decline,
Come, let us fill the bowl, and quaff a draught of cheap French wine,
Hurrah for short and merry lives; hurrah for Schedule D!
And when we 're in the Union, oh how happy we shall be!
THE GENEROSITY OF GREEN ERIN.
Hibernia has cast her mite into the Pope's treasury. The faithful
Irish have subscribed for their common Father the sum of £207. Of
this amount, £100 has been contributed by Dr. Cuiaen himself.
Heretical Churchmen have been accused of putting sovereigns into
charity-plates to serve the purpose merely of decoy-ducks; but let
Dr. Cullen have the credit of offering his Holiness the genuine
sacrifice of £100. We cannot but respect the devotion which expresses
itself in forking out. Dr. Ctjllen cares at least £100 for the Pope;
how much the faithful Irish at large care for him, we shall perhaps
know by-and-by; at present, the figure seems to be a fraction of a
farthing a head. In the mean time, they should bear in mind that
they cannot possibly do anything so certain to please the Holy Father
as sending him a lot of money,—that nothing could more highly gratify
his paternal heart than the receipt of any given sum, except the receipt
of a greater sum; and they may be quite sure, in spite of any doubts
that some weak brethren may suggest to the contrary, that, wtiilst the
largest donations will be those most acceptable at the Vatican, the
smallest contributions will be thankfully received.
THE MINT OF MODENA.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [February 18, 1860.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ondat, February 6. Demos-
thenes (who was the son
of a cabinet-maker of the
same name, by his wife, nee
Cleobule Gylon, whose
papa was an objectionable
kind of Governor, insomuch
as he sold the colony he
ought to have governed to
the Scythians, and made a
Scythian lady the grand-
mamma of the said Demos-
thenes) was once going to
deliver a very important
speech. But a party against
whose interest that speech
was to be directed, sent our
eloquent friend a golden
gift. Whereby, when the
oration should have been
made, Demosthenes ap-
peared with his throat
wrapped up in no end of
woollens and comforters,
and intimated that he had
no voice. Mr. Punch at the
time made a Greek joke,
which is wholly untranslate-
able into British. He is re-
minded of the circumstance
by the fact that to-night an
orator quite as eloquent as
Demosthenes, and in every
way a superior character,
was to have delivered a grand Financial Harangue; but, having lost
his voice, was unable to do so, the accident causing great detriment to
the country. In other respects, there is not the slightest parallel
between the cases, but a Scholar and a Gentleman is not to be pre-
vented from displaying his classical erudition by a trifle of that kind,
and Mr. Punch is quite sure that his accomplished friend, the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer will agree with him, and if he does not,
Mr. Punch doesn't care in the slightest degree.
Disappointed of the Budget, and of the particulars of the Cobden
Treaty, which however His Majesty the Elected sent to a Belgic paper,
and its principal points were published to the world this very evening,
Parliament sat for a couple of hours only. By the Constitution of
England, measures are discussed,
"Up-stairs, Downstairs, and in My Lady's Chamber,"
a line hitherto mystical, but now explained by Mr. Punch to be a dark
allusion to Lords, Commons, and Her Majesty. Up-stairs, to-night,
or rather, before dinner, nothing was done, but Lord Brovobam ex-
pressed his hopes that the jurisdiction of the County Courts will be
increased to cognisance of claims of all sizes. Really, this proposal
requires consideration. The County Courts answer their present
purpose very well, that is to say a tradesman has only to bring an
action against a person not in trade, and the judge instantly orders the
latter to pay; or if he is foolish enough to demand a jury, the jurors,
also traders, immediately and indignantly return a verdict for their
fellow-craftsmen, usually appending a recommendation that the defend-
ant, as soon as he has paid, shall be hanged, for having dared to dis-
pute a bill. But this would scarcely do in some cases. Suppose the
Earl or Shrewsbury, for instance, who has recently recovered his
splendid estates, should be attacked by some new claimant, say Mr.
Punch (not that he proposes that course) and be sued for £200,000 of
rents, in a County Court. The judge's Now then, Talbot, how do
you want to pay this? Half to-morrow, and the rest on Tuesday week,
eh P Or will you be locked up F " would sound a little peremptory
under the circumstances. Earl de Grey and Ripon, Sidney Her-
bert's sub., paid a high compliment to the Volunteers, but declined
a further payment rather sillily asked by Lord Vivian, namely,
that of their tailor's bills. Lord Donoughmore wanted to know
whether the Belgian account of the Treaty was correct, to which Lord
Granville made the inconceivably absurd answer, that not being a
subscriber to the IndSpendance Beige he could not say. As if every-
body had not read the translation in the English evening papers. The
Lords were so disgusted with his flippancy that they left the House at
a quarter to six o'clock.*
* We have received a note from our friond the Lord Chancellor, apologising for
not baring expressed himself more plainly on bringing in the Criminal Consolida-
tion Bills. Ho made Mr. Punch believe that the law of Conspiracy to Murder was
to be made as light for Ireland as it is for England. John Campbell says that on the
contrary, it Is to be made as hoavy for England as it is for Ireland. We are glad
to hear it, and ontirely forgivo him for our having misunderstood him, and drink
Down stairs, Lord Palmerston announced Mr. Gladstone's
illness, and postponed the Budget till Friday. Mr. Disraeli ex-
pressed his sorrow, and wanted the Treaty d'avance. Lord Palmer-
ston wished he might get it. Mr. Byno complained of the outrages
in St. George's-in-the-Yeast; and Sir G. C. Lewis complained that such
trifling theological protests as breaking altar-rails, shooting peas, and
shying Prayer-books, should be called outrages, said he had done all he
meant to do in the matter, and blew up the Reverend Bryan King,
Incumbent. Both parties deserve a severe whacking,—the rioters from
the batons of the Police, and the Reverend Bryan from t he hard end of
the crozier of Bishop Tait. As the Archbishop of Dublin says—
"Bryan O'Kino has no business to wear
Ridiculous garments in preaching or prayer:
What's pro he should raid, an l what's verse he should sing,
But he's Popish at bottom, is Bryan O'Kino."
Tuesday. Up-stairs, this same subject was brought up by Lord
Derby, who pitched manfully into the Puseyites, but protested
against a mob being left to enforce Church Discipline. Lord Gran-
ville hoped that the Puseyites would take warning from the great
Church-Cnampion, Lord Derby, and added that the Police had orders
to do their best. Lord Brougham said he had no "right to say that
his Brother was wrong, who thought it right to make certain changes
of posture at certain periods,"—which was fair, as his Lordship
changes his about eleven hundred and thirty-three times in five-and-
twenty minutes,—but he called on the Bishop to shut up the Church.
The Bishop thought that the rioting might be stopped by Police con-
victions, and that he could then settle the differences between the
parties who have theological convictions. That effete old party, the
Marquis of Normanby, then went into the Savoy and Nice Annexa-
tion question, and Lord Granville stated that lie was assured that
Sardinia had no intention of handing either over to France. Lord
Grey thought (with Lord Punch) that the conduct of the Elected on
the subject was highly unsatisfactory • and Lord Shaftesbury came
out with a straightforward and spirited protest against the annexation.
The Earl's language was so earnest that it quite frightened the poor
Duke of Newcastle, who bleated piteously against such a tone,—it
was all very well for an Earl, wit h convictions of right and wrong, to
be fervid about children's destitution, or education, or over-work, or
any other trifling matter in which over-zeal could do no mischief, but
that really was not the way to talk when diplomatic considerations
came up. Lord Brougham did not seem to share this feeling, for he
said that the proposed annexation, if not the voluntary act of the
people, would oe "atrocious;" and Lord Derby spoke eloquently,
and at our friend Electus, upon the extreme propriety of his trying
to establish a character for honesty and pacific intentions. The
Constantinople Pet, who has so often floored a Gallic Champion,—
need we name Lord Stratford de Therapia,—added his voice on the
same side: and. in fact, Up-stairs did its duty by a Debate of Protest,
—a very desirable sermon to the Victor of Sardinia and the Victor of
Solferino upon the Hebrew text, "Cursed is he that removcth his
neighbour's land-mark."
Down-stairs, Lord John Russell made an important statement.
He had been making proposals for the final settlement of the Italian
question. Dramatised, and with the replies, they went thus:—
Lord John. Louis and Francis, you shall neither of you interfere
by force, without leave from the five other Powers.
Louis. Very well.
Francis. I am the Lord's Anointed, and I shall not demean myself
by any engagement of non-interference.
Lord John. You, Louis, take your soldiers out of Rome and
Lombardy.
Louis. With pleasure—when quite convenient to me.
Lord John. Nobody at all shall interfere with you, Francis, about
Venetia.
Louis. Very right, too.
Francis. You are highly obliging, but I am quite competent to
defend myself there.
Lord John. Victor Emmanuel is not to send any troops into
Central Italy until she has decided on her own future; but if she
decides to be annexed to Sardinia, she may, and then he can do as
he likes.
Louis. I must speak privately to you, Francis, about this. (They
converse apart.)
Francis. I repeat that I shall make no promise, and I will see Victor
blowed before I recognise his doings, but 1 have no intention of sending
any soldiers outside my own property.
Louis. I hope that we shall settle everything charmingly, mes amis.
Lord John. I'm sure I hope so.
Francis. Humph!
Then Lord John Manners endeavoured to introduce a Bill for
closing the doors of the Divorce Court against audiences, and the
House of Commons closed its own doors against his Bill by 26S to S3.
The proposal was eminently spooney. Denial of the right of the Press

to publish reports of the proceedings in any lav court is ont of the
question, and therefore the merely shutting out the handful of dis-
reputable people who crowd into the little den to listen to what does
not concern them would be foolish. At the same time it behoves the
Press to publish only what is necessary to the comprehension of a divorce
case and of the principle on which it is decided. With which dictum
Mr. Punch gladly dismisses an unsavoury subject.
The Quakers are dying out, and desire to form alliance with the
world that turns down its coat-collars. They ask for legalisation of
Quaker marriages where one victim is not a Quaker. We presume
that in such unions compromises will be made on the subject of
grammar, and when Reuben asks Rosa-Matilda, "Art thee going
out P" the fair worldling will reply, "Yes, I air."
Wednesday. The Church of England was utterly and finally destroyed,
Sir John Trelawney's Bill for the abolition of the forcible collection
of about a quarter of a million nf her income being carried by the
(diminished) majority of 263 to 234. To be sure she has a million and
a half of voluntarily subscribed income beside, and may have almost as
much as she likes for the mere asking civilly, but what's the pleasure in
money one has given to one—one likes to grab money as matter of right.
Thursday. Up-stairs, another blow was dealt at the persecuted Churchi
by the second reading of a Bill for enabling Dissenters to send their
children to Endowed Schools, and for legally qualifying those dreadful
schismatics to be Trustees thereof. The Bishops made no resistance.
We have fallen upon evil times. Perhaps the Dissenters will put
down Virgil and Horace, and insist on sixth forms being up in
"Can you tell me, child," &c. And what will become of Plautus and
Terence, writers of vile stage-plays f What are the Bishops about f
Down-stairs, Sib, F. Kelly introduced a thunderingly terrible and
utterly useless Bribery Bill. The only sensible thing that was said
was the condemnation by Mb. Malins of attorneys for taking retainers,
that is bribes, in elections. He might go a little further. Every
attorney is a sworn official of one of the Queen's Law Courts, and
every solicitor is a sworn official of the Court of Chancery, and it is
most unconstitutional as well as indecent for these persons to interfere
in elections. If good were intended, Kelly would introduce a clause
making any attorney or solicitor who should take part in an election
liable ipso facto to be struck off the Rolls. But the attorney-power in
the House is far too strong for any such salutary measure to pass.
Tom Buncombe then proposed to let the ballot be tried in the next
elections for Gloucester and Wakefield, but this was refused by the
(small) majority of 149 to 118.
Friday. Up-stairs, the Lords made short work of it, being eager to
come Down-stairs and hear the Budget. A brief Conversazione, as Mr.
Disraeli elegantly calls the Friday evening questioning, having taken
place, and the English Demosthenes having also taken his, amid loud
cheers from all aides of the House, the latter went into Committee,
and received
THE BUDGET OF 1860.
Out spoke the gallant Chancellor, the Chancellor of X,
While all the listening Swells outstretched their senatorial necks:
"At present, Mr. Massey,—and I say it from my soul,—
We 'ie all, financially at least, in what I call a Hole.
'Twixt taxes dead, and duties off, and awful outlays loo,
We must really scratch our heads, boys, and consider what to do.
There's China, whose misconduct will compel us to disburse,
And France, to whom we've wed ourselves for better or for worse:
Each has her pull, though, luckily, there comes a little gaiu,
Whence none would have expected it,—a debt is paid by Spain.
But, on the whole account, I find, I clear myself, about,
Though turning ignominiously my pockets inside out;
And to intelligence like yours, of course, it's very clear,
That we must make, ana instantly, provision for the year.
"Well, now, the country's very rich, and richer every day,
There's money to be got at, but. the question is, the Way.
Yes, Ways and Means are now the point, but 'twill be also seen
That Parliament must choose a Way the People won't call Mean.
We 're all exceeding prosperous, as Income Papers t ell,
And even 'Mr. Farmer' owns he's doing pretty well;
But, bless my soul, my A Sables, if you go on to pitch
• Your money right and left, you know, you never will be rich.
Within the last six years your wealth has taken to increase
Above Sixteen per Cent.,—but then we haven't kept the peace;
And how d'ye think Expenditure's expanded for that date?
The figure of per-centage, Blessed Friends, is Fifty-Eight!
It's almost needless to remark that this will never do,
'Aud for economical reforms the people look to you.
Well, we must fill the gap up, and a real statesman scorns'
To shilly-shally, and he takes the bull by both his horns
(That is a dig for Dizzy, whose financial end and aim
Was the making things agreeable by postponing every claim);
So put. your shoulders to the wheel, and let us shove along:
This Eighteen Sixty is a year for doing something strong.
Reforms, commercial ones I mean, to which you should aspire,
Will make John Bull more willing to fork out what we require—
He really likes the Income-Tax, although upon his tongue
There's grumble,and one person wrote that 'Gladston e suould be hung!'
"Now, on we go to Turkey, and d'abord, it seems to me
That I shan't touch the duties on sugar and on tea;
One would have liked to take them off, but as I've often said,
Tbe real way to help the poor 'a by stimulating trade.
"Then comes the Treaty. Inter alia, France will soon let in
(At p. c. 30) sugar, crystal, iron, coal, and skin,
Brass wire, and dyewoods, china, glass, cotton and cloth, and soap,
Hosiery, steel, and carriages, machinery, brandy, rope,
And a long list of other things to hammer, drink, or munch,
I very much regret to add, she will not let in Punch.
We on the other hand propose to let in. duty free,
Sulphuric acid, agates, arms, corks, and embroidery,
Clocks, gloves, hats, canes, quinine, brocade, raw fruits, and China ware,
Oils, and pianos, perfumes, grapes, and all things made of hair.
Then, as to wine, we'll let it in at duties much brought down,
Three bob a gallon for the best that can be bought iu town,
Brandy at eight and tuppence to the British shore shall come,
And the same duty fall on French as on Colonial rum.
There is the Treaty, meant to bind two nations very tight,
I hope our project will have luck, I 'in certain it is right:
Of course each separate interest will attack me for the plan,
But that's all beestly Selfishness, a vice innate in man.
For such objectors I must say profound contempt 1 feel,
Let's cut up private fatted calves, and help the Common-Weal.
Good wholesome wines of France let's bring to everybody's door,
Let him who never drank it drink, who drinks drink all the more.
Let's swamp the nasty African, not African at all,
And be the British wines henceforth doomed to the servants' hall.
Good wine is medicine—then how hard upon the labouring poor,
When ill to drink the public-house decoction, so impure—
The wine our poor sick sailors get's as grimy as Old Nick,
Upon my honour, gentlemen, it nearly made me sick.
I'm sure I touch you to the heart, I '11 only add that, soon
Trade will find out our Treaty is a most enormous Boon.
"And now to knock some duties off, a process that must please:
Henceforth be Butter free, and Tallow, Nuts, and Eggs, and Cheese,
The Orange and the Lemon, mark, the Nutmeg and the Date
Shall cease in future to bring in revenue to the State,
With Foreign Paper, Liquorice, and many a thing that sounds
A trifle, yet the whole bring near Four Hundred Thousand Pounds.
That same amount, too, I release,—I always said I should,—
By knocking off the Timber Duty. Hear that, Chabxey Wood P
Then, on some other articles of great and daily use
i The duty wo will not take off, but largely will reduce*
Currants and Raisins, Figs and Hops: 1 think that I may say,
About a Million is the total sum I throw away.
"How to make up for all these boons. A plan as good as any,—
: Charges on every Package shipped, or brought to shore, one penny;
It is a trifle, which I call a Registration Fee,—
Three Hundred Thousand Pounds, my Coves, that trifle brings to me.
The system that's called Warehousing—it's very full of ' jargon,'
But I've a plan for taxing it—you'll find I've got a bargain.
Sonic chicory duty, and some stamps will bring me in some aid,
And then I've got a plan will rile the Witlers, I'm afraid,
I mean to let Confectioners, likewise the Slap-Bang Line,
Take out a licence to supply their guests with beer and wine;
And little game certificates I'll sell to Cockney shots
Who shoot but for a week or two—I'm told that there are lots.
And when I've added that I '11 stamp a cheque, though drawn by Self,
I've told you all my Little Games for pocketing the pelf,
So now I '11 burst upon you like a roaring boar or Aper,
I mean, my boys. Abolishing the Duty upon Paper.
There goes a Million—never mind—let's act like honest men—
The Pen does justice to us all, do justice to the Pen.
"One way or other we shall lose Two Millions, rather more.
How shall we get that money back—that mighty sum restore?
I '11 tell you. Take the credits up which Malt and Hops enjoy,
Screw up John Barleycorn, he's been too much indulged a boy.
Nearly a million and a half by this means we obtain—
Then, the beloved old Income-Tax must go on once again,
It is as nice as Ninepence, but we '11 raise it to the rank
Of such a pretty coin of France—we '11 make the Tax a Franc.
There is at once a mine from which our losses we '11 supply—
And such a graceful compliment to our adored Ally.
"So there's my scheme. I've often read that Queens in times of uld
Among their subjects scattered showers of silver and of gold,
That was a goodly sight, no doubt, but 'tis a goodlier sight
To see this Council of our Queen assembled here to-night.
Enabled by Heaven's Providence to fling, with liberal hand.
Such boons as I suggest you scatter broadcast o'er tbe land."
Thus amid all those orators, of whom he's Lord and ltex,
Outspake our gallant Chancellor, the Chancbllob or X.

A COOL QUESTION AND A COURTEOUS ANSWER.
Mr. Pencil lately received the following polite communication from
the indefatigable assessor of Income-Tax for the district in which Mr.
Punch carries on his labours for the benefit of his species :—
"2, Falcon Court, Floot Stroot, February 3rd.
"You will ploaao fill up tho enclosed Form with the names and addresses of those
Gentlemen who Writ* for Punch, in order that they may be duly assessed to the
Income-Tax. Flease return it to my office within Sjvon days."
This letter took Mr. P. by surprise. He had not been accustomed
to consider that his distinguished, though anonymous, correspondents,
were "persons in his service or employ —as specified in the beading
of the Form enclosed by the assessor. Satisfied, however, that no
assessor of Income-Tax could possibly have over-stepped the limits of
law, still more, that such an official could have asked any question he
had no right to ask, and thus have been guilty of an impertinence.
Mr. Punch loses no time in satisfying the curiosity of that official, ana
at the same time takes the opportunity of indulging the natural eager-
ness of the public for information as to the sources of the wit and
wisdom that weekly irradiate his pages, by filling up the return as
follows:—

FACTS FOR FOREIGNERS.
Some people may have smiled at the following announcement, which
was inserted in the Timet of not many days ago. More thinking minds,
however, will probably agree with us, that the statement should elicit
commendation more than laughter, as it tends to show how England is
made much of on the Continent, and how foreign writers try to magnify
her might:—
"Thosf. English !— Somo of the Gorman journals announce seriously that a
Company of English capitalists have made an application to tho Kino or Naples
for a concession for the extinction of Vesuvius. The principal seat of the fire of
that volcano is situated several thousand feet below the level of the sea. By cutting
a canal which would carry the water into the crater, the fire would be completely
extinguished, and the operation, which would only cost 2,000,000f., would restore
to cultivation land of ten times that value."
As a pendant to this story we are authorised to state, that there are
several new Companies now forming in this country, by which our
surplus money will be usefully employed, and highly profitable work-
be found for those who want it. Among the projects now in prospect
we may mention the few following, which will instance what grand
schemes have of late been started in the city, for the purpose of em-
ploying our few millions of spare cash:—
The first that may be noticed is a Company established to set the
Thames on fire, and by this means to deodorise and render it salubrious.
A second purpose of this project is, by means of the caloric which thus
will be engendered, to keep up a supply of hot air in cold weather,
whereby the streets of London will oe always kept well warmed, ana
those who walk in them will save tbe cost of wearing a great coat.
Another Company is now in progress of formation for the purpose of
importing the summit of Mont Blanc; which, after being carried round
the country as a peepshow, will be put up in Hyde Park as a practice-
ground for tourists.
A third project has been started to employ our idle capital in bringing
all the gold-fields bodily to England, so as to save the cost of working
them so far away from home. By avoiding the expense of the export
of machinery, and the higher price for labour which is paid abroad than
here, it is reckoned that, at quite a moderate calculation, the profits of
their project will be fully cent, per cent.
The next scheme to be noticed is a plan by which the Sun will be
, induced to shine at night; so that the public will be able to dispense
l with burning gas, and need no longer make complaints about monopo-
'lising companies, who supply it of low quality at rather a high price.
Besides a plan just set on foot for making champagne out of cucum-
bers, a scheme has been devised for procuring the extraction of pea-
soup from London fog. When the foreigner remembers that our fogs
are now so frequent that the clear blue sky in England is never clearly
seen, he may form a faint conception of the work which is cut out for
this new Company of Soup-makers. The fog will daily furnish a lot
of raw material, which English ingenuity will soon cook into soup.
Another paying speculation is that which has been started for im-
porting the Great Pyramid, for which purpose (it is known) we have
been building our Big Ship. It is stated that the stones of which the
pyramid is made will fetch ten millions sterling as ballast for our fleets,
tor which pacific purpose all the paving-stones in England have been
long ago grubbed up. The myriads of mummies which the pyramid
contains will of course fetch a high price among our farmers for manure:
while the mummy-wheat alone will pay the whole cost of importing,
for every one has heard how prolific it has proved, and there cannot be
a grain less than a million billion bushels of it to be unearthed.
Our foreign friends moreover should know, that some half-dozen of
our great West-end capitalists have subscribed among themselves
eleven millions of loose cash, for excavating bodily the biggest of the
glaciers, and placing it en maese in Me. Gunter's ice-house. How
many sherry-coblers will be made from its contents, we leave the
schoolmasters abroad, if they live long enough, to calculate.
We may state too for a fact, that shares are now in course of issue
for a Company whose work will be to dig up some few square miles of
the Sandwich Islands, and to import for home consumption the richest
of their strata, which are composed of bread and butter with alternate
ham and beef. By way too of providing liquefaction for these viands,
another project has been thought of for digging up and shipping some
few dozen of the Geysers, which when mixed with British nrandy will
afford the best of grog.
But perhaps the most surprising proof of English enterprise is the
fact that application has been made to the Americans for concession of
Niagara for sake of importation. The torrent when brought over will
be made a "water privilege," and its vast power will be used to work
the printing-press for Punch!
To these examples of our energy and speculative spirit we could, if
we had space, add many dozens more. We have said enough, however,
to convince the German journalists that the scheme which they assign
to us falls far short of the truth -. and as they have already been
stretching their credulity, if they swallow their own stories, they may
easily bolt ours. It is not wise to underrate the power of an enemy,
and we think our foreign friends will be the less apt to attack us, the
more they are convinced of our gigantic strength.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [February 18, 1860.
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.

CHAPTER III.—THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD.
ot because this is leap year,
we may make a leap here
over the Anglo-Roman
period, but because there
is but little change of cos-
tume to record in it. The
only noticeable novelty
winch Tacitus relates was,
(hat the better classes
mostly "threw away their
bracca:," and wore the
lloman tunic, which de-
scended to the knee. Scot ch
writers have however dis-
credited this statement, as
it tends to bring discredit
on the prudence of their
ancestors. It seems indeed
incredible that any fore-
father of Scotchmen could
have ever been so waste-
ful as to throw away his
breeches, and we think it
far more likely that the
better classes either gave
away their cast-off clothing,
or else let their servants sell
it for them to the Jews.
Even in our present extravagance of dress, it is seldom that one
hears of swells throwing away their trousers; and we imagine when
t he braces: first went out of fashion there were many ways of turning
them to profitable account. Poor relations were, no doubt, very
t hankful to get hold of them; and we can fancy the delight of a
Roman-British matron at finding an old pair of braccse in a closet,
and exchanging them forthwith to some Roman-British costermonger,
for a " hornament to her fire-stove " or a "bowl of 'andsome gold-fish."
We proceed now to a period of which the costumes have been much
more frequently depicted, and we have not to draw so largely on our
fancy to describe them. When the reader bears in mind that it was in
the Anglo-Saxon time that Harold lived and died, we need surely say
uo more to convince him on this point. Every student of High Art
has dressed up a lay figure to represent how Harold lay upon the field,
and from the various costumes in which his body has been found, we
may arrive at something possibly approaching to the truth.
Hasty critics might imagine that the Battle of Hastings would not
afford much notion of the fashions of the period, any more than in a
picture of the Battle of Waterloo one would expect to see the panta-
loons and pumps then worn at A knack's. But of the Saxons we are
told that nearly all of them were soldiers, and they were therefore
much more military than civil in their habits. The great guns of
historians cite the Canons of King Edgar, which enjoined, as a great
penance, that men Bhould go unarmed; and from this we may infer
that the male part of the people went about in mail, and used their
spear or sword by way of walking-stick or switch. The addition of a
shield to their ordinary clothing would make them just as ready for the
fray as for the feast; and as the latter very often ended in the former,
we can fancy that they sometimes armed themselves with dish-covers,
which now bear a close resemblance to the Saxon shield.
It would indeed seem from the dresses of these ancestors of ours,
that their organs of Destructiveness were most prodigiously developed,
or else their Dumps of Cautiousness were most unusually big. "Every
man his own policeman" was apparently their motto, and one would
think the Danger-signal always stared them in the face. As a proof of
their pugnacity we learn, that they preferred to wear a shortened tunic,
"because in it they could most freely wield their weapons;" and they
added to this vestment a metal rim or collar, which at times when they
grew mettlesome, served by way of breast-piece. This pectoral was no
doubt a great protection to the chest, and shielded it from cold as well
as from a sword-cut. Besides being a breast-plate, it acted, we do not
doubt, as a sort of poor man's plaister, and saved the wearers from
bronchitis not less than from a blow.
To protect themselves still further, both from cutting winds and
weapons, the Saxons wore a kind of ringed tunic, or byme: so called,
perhaps, because it was exceedingly warm clothing, and very likely
made the wearers burning hot. The imaginative reader may form
some faint conception of the nature of this byme, by reading an enigma
which was made by Bishop Adhelm, and which, as being a fair
specimen of the riddles of the period, it may not be out of place to copy
into Punch.
"I was produced "—says the bishop, speaking as the byme—
"I was produced in the cold bowels of the dewy earth, and not made from the
rough fleeces of wool: no woofs drew me, nor at my birth did the tremulous
threads resound; the yellow down of Bilkworms formed me not; I passed not
through the shuttle, neither was I stricken with tho wool-comb; yet, strange to
say, in common discourse I am called a garment. I fear not the darts taken from
the long quivers."
Serious people may be shocked at finding that a Bishop has stooped
to make a riddle, but this episcopal enigma may serve to shut their
mouths, when they protest that riddle-making is a frivolous employ-
ment, which no one but a punster or a pickpocket would take to. It
cannot be denied that the enigma is far-fetched, considering the long
distant date from which we fetch it. Still, for such an early effort, it
is really not so bad, and we think none the worse of the good bishop
for making it.
Whether or no the Scalds were the inventors of the byme, is a
question far more easy to be asked than to be answered. It seems
however not unreasonable to fancy that they were, for the byme was
just the thing for fiery people like the Scalds, who were so continually
getting into hot water. Being, as we learn, extremely difficult t o pierce,
it was doubtless of great use in what the Yankees call a "difficulty."
At the time of which we write the thoughtful reader may remember
that revolvers were not known: and, as duels then were fought with
daggers, spears, and swords, the byme, there is no question, often
saved the skins of those who came up to the scratch.
The Anglo-Saxon shields were oval and convex, with an iron boss,
or umbo, projecting from the centre like the handle of a dish-cover; to
which, as we have said, the
shields bore somewhat of re-
semblance. But though they
looked like dishcovers, their
chief use was as head-
covers: and we have no
doubt they were useful in
peace as well as war-time,
and could ward not only
weapons but water from the
brain. Their projecting umbo
gave them quite the look of
umbo-rellas, and they were
doubtless of good service in
a shower or a scrimmage,
and could protect the head
from anything, whether wet
or blows, which happened to
be rained on it.
These dish-covers, how-
ever, were not their only
brain-covers; for, as the
sapient observer has possibly
remarked, men don't wear
an umbrella with a view to
keep their heads warm. So
besides their shields the
Saxons wore by day a sort
of night-cap, which a modern writer tells us was "borrowed from
the Phrygians." We think though, that this writer writes wrongly
on this head; for we can't believe our ancestors were so hard up for
hats, that they were forced to go bo far as Phrygia to borrow them.
The old illuminations throw some light upon this cap, which seems in
shape to have been a cross between a nightcap and a foolscap. In
material, however, it differed from them both, being made of leather,
which was sometimes edged with metal: so that, at least in one
material respect, this queer cap bore resemblance to the Erench
chapeau dc cuir.
NOTES ON NAPLES.
TnE Court Circular, the other day, contained a statement that the
band of the 1st Life Guards was in attendance during Her Majesty's
dinner, and played, amongst other pieces of music, a "Melange" by
Binder, named "Souvenir de Naples."
Mr. Binder's medley we may suppose to have been one of a des-
criptive character; such as the celebrated Battle of Prague. In the
latter composition, our grandmothers used to hear the "groans of the
wounded;" in the former the Royal dinner party probably distinguished
the groans of the tortured, and the rattling of the prisoners' chains.
Such sounds "most musical, most melancholy," would necessarily
constitute the strongest effects in the performance of any accurate
harmonic recollection of Maples.

THE FREEWOMEN OF VENICE.

enice is asserting her-
self. According to a
letter from that fair
city,—
11 Not many days sin 20
the weird was given by the
ithe"
ladies through tl
provincos that, in order to
bo distinguished from the
female companions of their
oppression, one and all
should renounce wearing
Ciinoline."
The Venetian ladies
have done admirably in
signifying their hatred
of an abominable de-
spotism by the renun-
ciation of an odious
fashion. In thus act-
ing, they have vindi-
cated the dignity of
their sex; for the gre-
garious and sheepish
submission to the bur-
den of hoops and whale-
bone, on the part of
the softer sex, had ren-
dered it questionable
whether woman, how-
ever stubborn and obstinate she may sometimes be, really possesses any intelligent will of
her own. The Venetian ladies, however, by bursting the bonds and casting away the cords of
Crinoline have proved themselves endowed with sense, reason, and the power of free agency;
faculties which, therefore, we may regard as only paralysed in the case of the rest of the
females, who persist in wearing clothes which are inconvenient and ridiculous, as if they were
unable to help themselves. As the ladies of Venice have rejected the yoke of the Lady
Bellaston dynasty revived, so may they, by the help of men who are worthy of them, very
soon be enabled to get rid of the atrocious tyranny of the Imperial dastard who suffers his
execrable hangmen to whip them.
TRUE AND FALSE PROPHETS. .
The Irish Revival is not by any means ap-
proved of by the priesthood over which Da.
Cullen presides. From the following state-
ment made by a Dublin journal in reference to
the present state of King's County, it appears
that some of those reverend gentlemen pretend
to prophetic gifts of their own:—
"The priests openly proclaim the banishment of all
rrntesUnts from the district, and prophesy that before
winter is onded many of them will make clay In the
churchyard."
What do Dr. Cullen and his episcopal coad-
jutors say to these predictions f They may, it
they please, contrast the prophecies of (heir
own clergy with those of the Revivalists, and
argue that the latter, being unfulfilled, are
evidently the utterances of mere enthusiasm,
whereas the former must be regarded as attes-
tations of true faith, because they are verified:
for if Irish priests predict that Irish Protestants
will make clay in the churchyard, their words
are pretty sure to come true.
A Nominal Duty.
A Correspondent of the Post, signing him-
self Hopeful, proposes to avoid any addition
to the Income-Tax oy the expedient of imposing
"a tax of 5*. on every name but one a child of
Her Majesty's subjects receives at its baptism
or registering." The aristocracy are requested
to observe, that the adoption of this proposal
would involve the impost of five Bob for every
extra Reginald, Hubert, Bertram, or other
proper name of a noble boy.
Arguing in a Circle.—The Pope's Ency.
clical Letter.
A GO AT THE GAS-ROBBERS.
Correspondents keep complaining of the badness of their gas, and
of the insufficient quantity with which the streets are lit, and as they
don't quite seem to know on whom to fix the blame, they as usual
make appeal to the omniscience of Punch. This they do as usual with
their stereotyped facetiousness, saying they are rather "in the dark"
about, the matter, and begging Punch to "throw a light upon the
subject," and to "blaze away" at somebody for sake of a "flare-up."
One writer makes remark, that from the bad gas in the theatres the
audience looks " ghaa-tly;" and another says, that gas is now of no use
for "gas-tronomy," inasmuch as one can't cook by it, and can hardly
see to eat. They most of them agree too, that the gas is "no light
matter," and seeing that its badness is a constant heavy loss,' to
them, they disclaim the least intention or endeavour to " make light"
of it.
Now, Punch, once for all, must state, that he cannot any longer be a
martyr to these witticisms, and he trusts the manufacture of them may
at once be stopped. If there be just cause for a serious complaint
about the gas, let the charge be made in seriousness, without making
a bad joke of it, and Punch will "seriously incline" himself forthwith
to hear and see to it. If it be true that, as one writer sentimentally
observes,—
The gas of other days Is faded,
And half its glory gono:
The lamps of Regent Street arc Bhaded,
Their cocks but half turned on,"—
Punch, who has a hatred of doing things by halves, will fire away
unceasingly at those who are in fault, until the missing moiety of gas-
light be restored to us. With his literary powder always kept dry for
emergencies, Punch with pleasure Till blow up any gas-making mono-
polists, who are proved guilty of giving scanty measure through their
meters, and of sending out. bad gas although they get in a good price
for it. Ever at his post—although it be but a street lamp post—Punch
will keep his eyes unwinkingly upon our gas suppliers, and bring his
baton down on any who may give a short supply. Turn on, Old
Cock, to th' full thy gas!" will be his warning adjuration to any
London lamplighter, who may be paid to keep his burners nightly at
half-cock. To rob the streets of gas is a sort of highway robbery,
which Punch, personifying Justice, never will abet; and he will not
?tay his pen from passing condemnation until the gang of gaseous
Turpins be tamed off—like their lamps.
A DREADFUL BLOW AND GREAT DISCOURAGEMENT.
Monsieur Burat is a French Protectionist. He is so enraged at
the attempt of the EiirEEOR in favour of Free Trade, that he has
actually registered a vow before Heaven that he will rather hence-
forward—
"Blow his nose on his fingers thau use a pocket handkerchief of English make."
Spoken like a true mouchard, who docs not mind lending his hand to
anything 1 Mons. Burat has strange tastes, and it will be rather
awkward for him if he is in the habit, of taking snuff. He has regis-
tered a vow that is certainly more curious than nice, and we only hope
that he may come clean out, of it. He pulls his own nose, and then
fancies he is tweaking Free Trade's. We suppose he would not mind
cutting his nose right off, if he thought by so doing he could damage
the face of any Free-Trader. Clearly, Mons. Burat is one of those
short-sighted Protectionists who can see no farther than his nose: the
bridge of it must be a regular Pons asinorum.
British and Foreign Exchange.
There is a way for the pacification of Italy which might perhaps be
adopted with success. Suppose the Pore and Queen Victoria were
to change subjects as far, ou the Queen's part, as Ireland is concerned,
Protestants excepted. Her Majesty could perhaps take the inha-
bitants of the Duchies too, and give an equivalent in certain Britons
who also had rather be slaves. Constitutional Sovereign and Despots
would then be accommodated with contented peoples, and the Legis-
lature would enjoy a good riddance of bad rubbish.
"WHAT CAN'T BE CURED MUST BE ENDURED."
"They say that smoking cures hams, and herrings, and haddocks,
and many other things—but, all I know is, that I have tried it on my
wife's temper for the last dozen years, and it hasn't had the smallest
effect in curing that."—A Persevering Husband.
EXTRAORDINARY VEGETABLE.
Louis Napoleon, having proved so successful with bis "plants,"
has turned his attention to vegetables, and is at present engaged in
forcing a gigantic specimen of Savoy cabbage.

LITERATURE LOOKING UP.
What was it that Mr. Milton pocketed for his Paradise Lost t
(We have a horribly bad memory, ana have mislaid our Commonplace
book, or we should never dream of asking so commonplace a question.)
Was it Ten Thousand Pounds, think you? Certainly not more, you
say. Well, then, we can tell you, there is extant now a poem, whose
estimated value equals that of Mr. Milton's, and yet, actually, no
offer has, it seems, Deen made to publish it!
This we learn from a perusal of the following advertisement, which
was copied from the Hull Advertiser, the other day, into the Times:—
WANTED to borrow £500 on a manuscript poem, the eBtimated value
ot which is £10,000.
The Times calh this, in irony, "A Modest Request." But what the
Times intends for sarcasm, we prefer to take as truth. To ask for such
a paltry sum as only Five Hundred Founds to be advanced on what is
estimated to be worth Ten Thousand, appears to our mind a request
that could never cause a blush. As for raising brutal doubts it the
security be really of the value it is judged at, it is enough to point to
poems which have recently been printed, and which, according to the
statements of reliable authorities (of whom "Our Ix>ndon Correspondent"
stands conspicuously first), have been paid for at the most exorbitant
of rates. When it is known that sums of one, three, five, nay, even
twenty, fifty, and a hundred pounds per line have just been handed
across counters for poetic compositions, one surely can't feel wonder
that a poem should be valued at a mere Ten Thousand Pounds, nor
that the Milton who has written it, instead of keeping " mute," should
open wide his mouth.
No! Prosaic as we call ourselves, Poetry is looking up. Poets are
no longer out at elbow and of credit, whatever they may possibly have
been in days of yore. They can afford to put their Pegasus in harness
as a carriage-horse, and are not driven to use him as a half-fed printer's
hack. Every line they write is, now-a-days, a golden line: every verse
they scan for us is worth a guinea a foot. Their manuscripts are all
of them negotiable paper; money-lenders will advance on them to an
uncountable amount. Rampant idiots who doubt this, and who
question if a poem now would fetch Ten Thousand Pounds (whatever,
iu its writer's estimation, be the value of it), may be silenced in a jiffy
by propounding just one problem: How many Hundred Millions is the
"estimated value" of the poetry of Punch f
REVEREND HISTRIONICS.
The Rev. Frederick George Lee has written a letter to the
Times, the conclusion whereof is remarkable. Repeating what he had
told his congregation from the pulpit, he says,—
"And, moreover, I observed that, as Mr. Kino ,and his Curates had not trans-
gressed any law, either of the Church or State—as they pay their taxes, and havo
not been outlawed—they deserve that protection in the performance of their duty
which, in a country professing religious liberty, is so justly awarded to the Mor-
monite and Unitarian, and which Sir Richard Mayne even kindly bestows upon
those clerical gentlemen who have recently taken to the stage."
A very pretty sneer, Mr. Lee, is that with which you refer to the
clergymen who have been preaching at various theatres. But, reverend
and sarcastic Sir, which clerical gentlemen are the more culpable,
those who use theatres for churches, or those who turn a church inlo
a theatre?
The Beginning of the End.
There can no longer be any doubt entertained as to the imminence
of Austria's downfal in Venetia. Punch has been put down in the
streets of Venice! A rising of the people is momentarily expected.
NEW BULLS AND BEARS.

every private soldier admission to the Stock-Exchange, by enabliug
him to change his black choker for a convenient tie.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, Feb. 13. Lord Chelmsford's Bill for doing away with the
Grand Jury Nuisance within the metropolitan police district was read
a second time, with the approval of Lords Campbell and Brougham.
Lord Wensletdale, who was put into the Lords simply and solely
because it was thought he must have picked up a good deal of legal
knowledge which might be useful when Law Bills were discussed, and
who therefore takes every opportunity of protesting against any law
reform, made his usual grumble. He is Wensi.eydale of Walton,
but it ought to have been Walton-on-the-Nays. However, his
ohjection was very properly unheeded, and the Secret Tribunal, as
Lord Chelmsford called it, will one of these days be as extinct as
the Feomt Gtricht.
The vestry and inhabitants of St. George's-in-the-Yeast petitioned
against the doings of the Rev. Bryan O'King. The Bisnor of
Lxeter said that O'King had done many objectionable things, but
nothing contrary to law, and that a mob ought not to be allowed to
interfere. So said Lord Brougham, who mentioned that he had been
accused of turning Romanist, because he refused to condemn another
person for worshipping after his own fashion. Punch would as soon
accuse his old friend of having a Roman nose. The Bishop of
London said, that the presence of sixty policemen in the church had
kept the rioters in awe the last Sunday. Lord Granville said, they
had made as much row as they dared. A highly creditable state of
t hiDgs altogether. If the police would clear out the mob, and the
bishop would clear out the parson, a new clergyman might come in
with advantage, though as was said in old time, " What can the man
do that cometh after the King."
Mr, Fitzjurld will no longer wield wild arrums and employ
minacious terrums as an Irish patriot. Judge Perrin retires, and
the Attorney-General for Ireland takes a place on the viuerable
binch of secret Thaymis. Mr. Serjeant Deasy is made easy by
being shoved up to Fitzjurld's place; and Mr. O'Hagan, the
Pagan, takes Deasy's. So that thrifle of justice to Leland is adjusted;
but of course there is a row—somebody has been overlooked or
neglected, as always happens in Ireland.
The Commons had a Chinese Debt So, which came to nothing, except
that Charley Napier asked for the Victoria Cross for the gallant old
Admiral Hope; and Charley is hereby clapped sonorously on the
back for that piece of good taste and good feeling. After which, Lord
Clarence Paget moved the Navy Estimates, and got votes for 85,000
men and boys, and about Five Millions of Sovereigns to pay and feed
them.
Tuesday. Lord Normanby, who has all the spiteful pertinacity of a
not very wise old man, abused our charge d'affaires at Florence for
at tending the official reception of Signor Buoncompagni, the Governor-
General under the new order of things. There was talk on the subject
for about three hours, and it was, of course, made perfectly clear t hat
our charge had acted quite properly, and that Lord Normanby was
only carping at what was distasteful to his friends the ex-tyrants.
This being Valentine's Day, Mr. Punch sent the old goose the
following lines:—
"When young you were a smartish Mbble,
But now your talk 'b the merest dribble:
Pon't kick up such a feeble Shine,
My Pantaloon and Valentino."
Lord John Russell stated, that the Spaniards had actually forked
out £493,885, which they owed us. We all know how one hates a
creditor who has asked one for a just debt, and the bitterness of the
Spanish press against England just now may be easily understood. If
Spain were more in the habit of paying her debts, she would not
perhaps find it so very disagreeable. Mr. Spooner brought on the
Mavnooth question, and Mr. Patrick O'Brien reminded the House
of O'Connell's saying, that the worst enemy to religion was a pious
fool. Mr. Newdegate flared up; but Mr. O'Brien explained that
he had not meant to be personal, only playful, and apologised like a
gentleman. The Spooner motion was rejected by 186 to 128 pious
fools, we suppose. The evening ended with some talk about certain
alleged inconveniences to Dissenters at Cambridge, but Lord Stanley
said that all was right,—so of course it is.
Wednesday. Mr. MelloiI's Bill for inflicting terrible punishment on
people who were guilty of bribery was squashed. Mr. Punch rushed
down to the House hearing that something was up about the character
of Mr. Balfe. Thinking it was about his friend Michael, who writes
the elegant operas, Mr. Punch instantly rose and delivered a splendid
vol. xxxviii.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

eulogy on the Rose of Castille, with introduced compliments to the
admirable vocalism of Miss Louisa Fyne and Me. Harbison, at the
end of which the Speaker smilingly informed Mr. P. that it was not
the composer who was being talked of, but some Irish magistrate named
Balfe, who had been oppressed, but that the House was only too
happy to hear Mr. Punch on any subject whatever. Mr. Punch was
not in the slightest degree abashed, told the Speaker that he, Mr. P.,
knew quite well what ne was about, and delicately worked round the
subject from the Royal Italian Opera House, and Mr. Wallace's new
opera, to the Floral Hall, and so to the Volunteers' Ball, and thence to
the volunteer Movement, and to the state of the country generally,
until the House, instructed and delighted, rose.
Thursday. Caligula made his horse Incilatus a Roman Consul (in
imitation of which feat a good many British and Foreign Consuls are
made out of asses) and it is a pity that we have not an Hereditary
Legislator out of the Incitatus stock. His lordship would have been
useful to-night, when another Hereditary Legislator, Lord Redesdale,
actually thought proper to invite all the other Hereditary Legislators
to consider whether it would not be well for them to give their official
attention to racing matters. He pathetically deplored the evil practice
of putting "ridiculously light weights" upon racers, inasmuch as the
practice encouraged gambling, and like a practical Hereditary Legis-
lator, he was provided with a proposition to remedy so terrible an evil.
He suggested that no horse should, after this year, be allowed to run
with less than Seven Stone on him. It is due to his hearers to add,
that they not only gave their best ears to the subject, but showed their
acquaintance with it; for when Lord Redesdale inadvertently said
"pounds" instead of "stone," he was instantly corrected by a dozen
Hereditary Legislators. The question, he said, was too important
to be disposed of hastily, as if it were a mere Church Rates Bill or
Reform Bill, and therefore he would fix the second reading of his
measure at a distant date, in order that the Hereditary Legislature
might have.ample time to meditate on the proposed alteration. Perhaps
witnesses had better be examined, in which case Mr. Punch would like
to hear the sentiments of certain Crimean Hereditary Legislators, who
should know something of horses, having introduced a new mode of
feeding cavalry chargers, namely, by leaving them to devour one
another's tails.
Lord Ebuhy wanted a document (upon the subject of a revision of
the Burial Service) which was in the private library of the Archbishop
op Canterbury, and was severely abused by the Chancellor and
Lord Brougham for making so ungentlemanly a demand. Lord
Brougham, indeed, who visited the House of Commons on the night
of Mr. Gladstone's budget speech, and had never been there in the
interim between that night and his own elevation to the Woolsack, did
not seem to have been greatly conciliated by anything he saw or heard
Down-stairs, for he pitched into the Commons uncommonly, for having
made the same demand as Lord Ebury. The Earl op Airlie
assailed the Coal proposals of the Budget, and was told that he did
not understand the question, which was probable enough, though the
Ministerial reply could scarcely be considered civil.
Down-stairs, Lord John Russell gave notice that he should bring
in his Reform Bill on Thursday, the First of March. He had pre-
viously mentioned, in a Cocky sort of manner, that this would be an
auspicious day for the purpose, meaning that it was on a First of
March, twenty-nine years ago, that he Drought in his first Reform
Bill. We don t know what he meant by auspicious, but that Bill was
read by a majority of one only, and smashed on the first hostile amend-
ment. Is that sort of thing what our courageous young friend is
looking tof
He, our courageous young friend, then explained that the Americans
had shown their usual smartness in interpreting a treaty between
themselves and us. When we repealed the navigation laws, Jonathan
promised to be equally liberal, and in fulfilment of his promise has
excluded us from the whole trade between New York and California,
pretending that Washington and Franklin provided for such exclu-
sion. Lord John was so struck by an appeal to the American Lord
Sohers and Lord Grenville, that he could not find it in his heart
to say we were owdaciously cheated, as no doubt we are.
It was then announced, by bits, that our ally the Elected was en-
forcing his demand for Savoy and Nice by withholding his consent to
the union of the liberated provinces of Italy. He pretends to be afraid
lest his frontier should be endangered by a powerful Sardinian kingdom.
Lord John had to be put on the rack a little to get the fact out of
him, but he finally confessed. Mr. Punch would not wonder if the
Opposition made a valuable handle of this pleasant announcement,
before the Budget debates are over. Mr. Disraeli may, by a stress
of imagination, oe conceived "reposing the most illimitable confidence
in a sagacious Sovereign, our valued friend and ally, but a diminished
and attenuated confidence in the ministerial wisdom that could resign
invaluable revenue as a propitiatory sacrifice to an Imperialist idea."
Lord John further stated, that the King op Naples is so awfully
afraid of plots, that an English officer, who bought a cake in Naples as
a present to a lady, got into trouble because there was a little three-
coloured flag on it. Neither the Poet Pdnch nor the Poet Cowper
will be accused of anti-mouarchism, but really some lines of one ol
those great and pious bards force themselves into the memory of the
other:
"Quevkdo. as ho tells his sober tale,
Askod, when in bell, to see the royal gaol:
Approved their dealings in all other things.
But where, good Sir, do you confine your Kings?
'There,' said his guide, 'the group is full in view ;'
'Indeed,' roplled the Don, 1 there are but few :'
His black interpreter the charge disdained—
'Few, fellow T There are all that ever reigned I'"
Then came a debate on Manning our Navy, and a debate on one of the
causes which prevent its being Manned. On the first some useful
things were—said. By the second a useful thing was done, for our
friend the Viscount of Lambeth, who now and then performs a wise
act (or wouldn't he catch it harder for his chronic unwisdom), carried
a motion for a return of the number of floggings in the Army and Navy
for 1859. The object was, mainly, to have a new brand of condemna-
tion marked upon the system. The only professional answer was,
What other punishment avails with "riff-raff." To which the tri-
umphant rejoinder was, Make your Services what they should be, and
you will enlist honest and good men, instead of riff-raff. Government
were then going to be beaten on a motion of Ma. Hennessy, for
inquiry into the manner in which candidates are nominated and
examined for the Civil Service, but Lord Palmerston prudently gave
way. A committee was appointed to consider, whether something
could not be done to promote the recreation of the people. Mr. Punch,
who it need not be said, has done more towards that object than any
person who ever lived has done, or any person who ever will live can
do, heartily applauds the proposal, and Sir John Trelawny, the
proposer.
Friday. Further confirmation of the Savoy and Nice business—our
Government is now formally apprised that if Sardinia is to be increased,
France will demand part of Savoy—but not against the wishes of the
inhabitants. Mr. Punch proposes a compromise. Louis Napoleon
must not have any of the land of Savoy, but Mr. Punch offers to hand
over to him every Savoyard, organ, monkey, and white mouse in
England.
The Dissenters again trespassed on the Lords, and the Schools Bill
.was a good deal mangled in Committee.
The Conservatives mean to fight the Budget, and Mr. Ducane gave
notice of an amendment. The Derbyite cry is to be, "Don't destroy
Revenue, don't increase Income-Tax." So there will be a regular
Mill. Pah demands that there be no stopping, and that the fight go
on day by day till one party is floored.
After the Conversazione {Punch thanks thee, Ben, for teaching him
that word), Mr. Sidney Herbert moved the Army Estimates, and
got a vote for 143,362 men, which number does not include our Indian
Army of upwards of 90,000 soldiers. Sir Robert Peel fired off some
rather amusing buffoonery at the Volunteers, especially at "fat
lawyers." Bobby is not a dull Bobby, but is sadly misplaced in the
House of Commons. Why does not Paddy Green engage him to
take the Chair at the Harmonic Rabbits P
THE PROSPECTS OF PAPER.
The Times, in an interesting article on the subject of paper-manu-
facture, adverts to the fact, that for some time past there has existed in
this country a great dearth of rags, because their exportation has been
prohibited by the majority of foreign states. The demand for those
materials, however, will very soon be supplied by the operation of an
ever-increasing Income-Tax, imposed upon the insecure earnings of
industry, which will reduce multitudes of professional and mercantile
men, with their wives and families, to beggary and starvation, or the
workhouse; in either of which cases their relinquished garments will
afford the paper makers abundance of rags.
The Pursuit of a Policeman.
Sir Richard Mayne, in one of his letters to Mr. Bryan Kino,
begins it by saying, "I consider it my duty." Most noble words,
considering the high position that Sir Richard occupies! We wish
that the entire police force would only follow the example of their
magnanimous chief, and never do more than what they considered
then: "duty." The Force, then, would be more of a Moral, and less
of a Physical, Force.
"SOMETHING ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF DENMARK."

LEFT HIS PLACE-A GOOD ENGLISH COOKE.
mm
^ he Westminster Road is in
'tears! Without in any way
retiring from the management
of the horse, Ma. William
Cooke has thought fit to
retire from the management of
Astley's. Having lived so long
by pleasing other people, he
of course has fairly earned the
right to please himself; but
although he can afford, it
seems, to part with the public,
the public can't so easily
afford to part with him. Lon-
don without "Hashley's"
would be, in holiday time
especially, a place not worth
the staying in; and its late
manager has shown himself so
capital a Cooke, that in his
maniffe-ment of "Hashley's"
he has never made a hash of it.
Whatever has been promised
there has always been per-
formed; and excuses, else-
where stereotyped, never have
been printed there. The horses
never have had colds, nor been
"indisposed" (to act); nor have the human actors ever been too hoarse to show themselves.
Mb, Cooke, like a good cook, has always had some "stock" (piece) by him, ready for
emergencies, and in all his years of Cooke-ry has never dished the public. The pieces he has
served have been always nice and delicate, and however hotly they may have been spiced with
gunpowder, there has never been a soupfon of the flavour of gros set in them. A hippodrama
certainly is somewhat a coarse diet: seeing that its principal performer is a courser: but Mr.
Cooke is a top-SoYER in serving up his horseflesh, and has caused it to be relished by the
most refined of palates.
Ms. Cooke, it is well known, is blest with many children; but however they may spoil the
look of his polage, we think there cannot well be "too many" of them like him. A thoroughly

good cook is a rarity in England, and we cannot
wish too strongly for the breed to be perpetuated.
We therefore trust that Ma. Cooke in his period
of management has managed to lay up something
handsome for his larder, and that he and his may
keep their pots a-boiling, without coming to the
need of cooking their account-books.
A GEM OF AMERICAN CRITICISM.
It was quite by accident that we stumbled
against the following gem, which we picked up
in 1 he pages of the Mobile Register. In describing
a play, called Cloud and Sunshine, it Bays—
"The curiosity of the audience is kept upon the rack
of expectation until the very omega of the drama."
We wonder who would be donkey enough to
go to the theatre to be kept on the rack all the
evening? We don't know what the 'rack of
expectation* may ho, unless it is one that a
hungry steed is looking up to impatiently for
his customary allowance of hay, that has been
abstracted by a dishonest ostler. It sounds like
some instrument of torture, worthy of the days
of the Inquisition. Perhaps the rack is brought
in purposely to keep the attention of the
audience on the stretch throughout the play,
and so to increase its painful interest P The whole
thing is a cruel mystery to us, down to the
"very omega of the drama." If the Mobile
Register is generally full of such gems, we
should like to subscribe to it.
A Policeman's Signature.—We suppose
that, when a Policeman writes to Sir Richard
Mayne, that he always signs himself "Your
dutyful Servant."
EAILWAY LINES OF POLITICS.
"Mb. Pouch, Honoured Sir,
"As a British Elector, I should just like to know your opinion
about the fuller in obserwations as was made by Mr. Tite tot her day
at the meetin of the South-Western Railway shareholders:—
"They were placed in a false position, not by the acts of the Directors, but by
tbo rivalry of other companies, and the support which Parliament gave to that
rivalry. . . . Take another instance which they would have to fight that
session, and which involved the running of a broad gauge line into Southampton.
Whether that line was withdrawn or not, the going to Southampton on the broad
gauge was on the cards, and they must oppose somehow or other such a project
as that. There was a disposition to encourage rivalry in railways, and Directors
wore driven to measures which were beyond their control."
"What do you say now to these here remarks of Mr. Tite's as ex-
ibitin his notion of the duties of a Member of Parliament? What I
said when fust I read em was, Blow me, Tite! Here's Mr. Tite, a
wery respectabel gentleman no doubt calls his self M.P. for Bath; but
is Bath the constitchency repersented by that hon. legislator P Is he
Member for Bath, or Member for the South-Western Railway? I
don't know what may be the Bath voters' notion of the bisnis of their
repersentative, but what I should like mine to do would be to fight
the battles of the people in the House of Commons, instead of fightin
rival railway companies. That's how the work of the nation's neg-
lected, for the sake of forcin* up dividends, by means too of indenn
competition, so as to enable directors to charge the public whatever
fares they choose. It strikes me there's a good deal too much of this
here sort of thing, and these here M.P.s for Railways in that there
Assembly, which may be all rite and Tite for such as it may consent,
but is wery like to be the cause of a good deal of loose legislation by
which the people suffers in warious ways, besides bein' overcharged
for travelin, thanks to the Railway Members as goes there to fight for
privilidge and monopoly agin Free Trade. I has the homier to scribe
myself,

A DREAM OF THE GREAT UNPAID.
The Express, the other evening, contained a letter relating the
subjoined curious dream :—
"While staying at St. Alton's early last month I strayed into the Town Hall,
where the Quarter Sessions were being held, on Thursday the 8th. I then and
thero heard a poor agricultural labourer, out of work, for stealing a few sticks from
a fagot-stack during the inclement weather, sentenced by the Kami, or Verulau
(ChairmanX with the concurrence of the Bench, to three years' penal servitude.
The poor fellow had a family of four young children, and his wife (whose distress
in Court it was heartrending to see) was daily expecting a fifth. It was stated that
the man had been before convictod—for stealing rabbits, I understood,—and that
this was the causo of the ferocity (for so I must call it) of the sentence."
The Earl op Vertjlam has the character of a benevolent nobleman,
and cannot possibly have dispensed a specimen of justice like the above
—as outrageous as any sentence that was ever pronounced by a bashaw
on the county Bench-, even if a reverend one. The correspondent of
the Express must have dreamt of the cruelty with which he charges
the worthy Peer. Perhaps he is fond of poetry; and on the morning of
the day on which the foregoing day-dream happened to him, had been
reading Wordsworth's story of Ooody Blake and Harry Gill. Lord
Verulam has, no doubt, also read that story, which the poet declared
to be a true one; and surely the fear of the perpetual shivers would
have effectually deterred him, if any determent were needful, from
giving a poor fellow three years' penal servitude for taking a little fuel
to keep himself from congelation.

The Cheltenham Examiner makes the following statement, which
reflects great credit on a worthy nobleman:—
"It may not be generally known that one of tbe best, if not, par excellence, the
beet rifle shot in tbe neighbourhood, ia our respected Lord Lieutenant, Earl Ducik.
His lordship very recently shot, at his seat, Tortworth Court, against one of tho
most practised officers from Hythc, and was victor by many shots."
This paragraph must gratify all rightly constituted minds, rejoicing
to hear of anything that redounds to the honour of the British Peerage.
At the same time it will be the occasion of some annoyance to many
innocent persons, who, in consequence of the reputation which it will
have conferred on Lord Ducie, will be sure to be accused of attempt-
ing to make a joke, whenever they happen to speak of anybody as a
DuciE-d good shot.

Oju- irfuf- Catches it again this Winter in the Hirjldands.
THE CAT IN THE CUPBOARD.
In speaking on the motion of our friend Mr. Williams for returns of the
numbers of British soldiers and sailors who, in the year of Christianity 1859,
had suffered torture by flogging, Colonel Norte is reported to have made the
following remark:—
* If the honourablo Member for Lflmbcib, or any other of the civilian! who were always crying
out against flogging, would only duvlse some other punishment wMch, while sovoro, would
keep the soldier but a short timo from his duty, he would earn the gratitude of the wbolo Army?"
Before attempting to earn the gratitude of Colonel North, and the whole of
that army in which he is a commanding officer, Mr. Punch would fain expostulate
with the gallant Colonel, on a certain form of words occurring in the above-
quoted passage. What does Colonel North mean in talking of "the civilians
who were always crying out against flogging?" The late Charles Mathews,
in one of his entertainments, used to create much laughter by exclaiming, on a
particular occasion, " Confound that boy,—he's always tying his shoe!" The force
of this exclamation lies in the word "always;" which implies a complaint of
weariness and consequent irritation. These are, perhaps, the feelings which
Colonel North means to express when he describes certain civilians as "always
crying o»t against flogging." Everybody who is at all concerned with a class of
gentlemen whose highest moral quality is their self-respect, is familiar with this
use of the teim "always." It is predicated of the kind of being styled by those
same gentlemen as a bore; or, as many of them are accustomed to pronounce that
appellation, a baw.
Bores, however, or baws, Colonel, are useful things in their way. To bore is
the property of a gimlet; and the bore, otherwise called baw, often succeeds in
ultimately penetrating the very heart of a wrong. The Press is one of those
baws, or bores, that have been always crying out against flogging. It incurred
the disdain of the supercilious gentry by so doing, on the occurrence of the last
)ss case in point. You heard Mb. Sidney Herbert, the other night, state
: result. According to report, he said :—
"As to the case that recently occurred, and excited some discussion, the Commikder-in-Cbief
was not in England at the time: he arrived two days afterwards. I immediately called his
to it. The Dukk or Cambridge ordered an inquiry into the case; and the residt was,
severely reprimanded. Another result of the
i been bofor
gross
the re
1 order that has 1
l before referred to."
Inquiry was, the issuing of
If the Press had not cried out against flogging in this instance, would the
have attracted any notice, and would the general order mentioned by Mr. Herbert
ever have been issued to limit torture by the lash P Yet how boldly the Press was
accused of exaggeration and hollow sentimentality; and how contemptuously it
was informed, that stripes would of course draw blood, and that blood would
naturally trickle down to the ground, and form a puddle there!
Will Mr. Punch be rewarded with the gratitude of the whole Army for the sug-
gestion, that perhaps a good substitute for flogging might be found in the long-
continued stoppage of an offender's pay P What punishment could be more severe
—if that is what you want?' Think of the suffering which is inflicted by the
Income-Tax! To the stoppage of pay might be added reduction of rations, and the
stoppage of them also in the event, and during the continuance, of refusal to do duty.
And ought not Mr. Punch, by this suggestion, to earn the
gratitude of the Navy as well as the Army r Pay is the
main consideration which mans the Navy; would not the
privation of it be a sufficiently formidable punishment P
According to Lord Clarence Paget, out of the whole
Channel Fleet only three per cent, of the men have been
placed in the class liable to corporal punishment. British
sailors therefore do not seem to include a very large pro-
portion of blackguards; and if the cat were altogether
thrown overboard, would it be missed ? J
The whole merchant marine ought long ago to have
gone to the deuce, if tough old commodores are right, and
flogging is essential to discipline in the Royal Navy, and
the Royal Navy is like a certain place which is not to be
mentioned by Mr. Punch and in which the crew can be
kept under control only by terrific punishment. If this
were the case—which surely it is not—we might reason-
ably be told to go to that place if we want to man our
Navy.
WHAT NEXT?
OR LIGHT WINDOWS AND LIGHT WEIGHTS.
Here's a Bill of old Charles Burrell's,
For punishing by law,
Maids of all work, sharp as squirrels
(But not quite so sure of claw)—
Who their lives and limbs go risking
To clean our window-sashes,
And in payment of such frisking,
Oft come to awful smashes.
Against such legislation,
An objection raised t'a limine's,
That in this favoured nation,
"Lex non curat de minimis."
But none should raise objection,
(Sir Charles at length maintains)
To making a connection
Between "penalties " and "panes."
One more reason we may summon,
(Though Sir Charles for it should scold one,)
That laws to guard young women,
May be best left to an old one.
But encouraged by example,
Of this Burrellesque law-making,
Comes Lord Hedesdale next, his ample
Committee-work forsaking,
And would have it straight forbidden
(By a Bdl last week made known),
That a race-horse should be ridden
By a jock below seven stone.
Now, if sharpers must be shackled,
And too weak the legal lock is—
There are light-weights to be tackled
In loaves as well as jockeys.
Thoroughbreds deserve affection;
But let Kedesdale if he's able,
Give us thorough bread protection,
In the bakehouse, not the stable.
Lest the turfites all unwilling
To submit to legal fetters.
Bid him mind his private billing,
And leave public to his betters.
Personally Speaking.
England is Free, but in America one is not only ire,
but apt very frequently to be a great deal too Free; in
fact, more Free than welcome. To put it concisely :—
England is the Land of Liberty,
America is the Land of Liberties.

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.

CHAPTER IV.—THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD—(Continued).
roceeding with the mili-
tary costume of the
Saxons, and having shown
in our last chapter what
) they wore to shield their
heads, we may now de-
scribe the weapons which
were used to break them.
Of these, one of the most
striking was the double-
edged long broad-sword,
an arm which was gene-
rally wielded with Doth
hands, and which, from
the great muscular ex-
ertion it required, gave
rise to the expression of
"More power to your
elbow!" It was with
this weapon, we read,
t hat at the Battle of Caer-
bardon, Kino Arthur
killed above four hundred
men with his own hand;
but we doubt if any arm
would have sufficed for
such a feat, and though
perhaps Kino Arthur
may nave said he drew
his long sword, we rather
think it was his long
anolo-saxon warrior, krom the best AUTiio- bow which he really drew
RITirs. BEINa EXTREMELY RUDE IN THE ORIOINAL, there.*
the navnx mas bees put LSTo corbect DRAwisa. Another formidable wea-
pon which was wielded by
the Saxons was an axe with a long handle, which they called a bill.
This bill was somewhat like a lawyer's in its length, and was thereby
well adapted to make short work of an enemy. Bob Wace, the
Norman poet, says—
"fHg contrntmrn Dnne J^astgnge's Jtygl,
Witxt gortlnt cuttc up bgc gc 13bI:"
—though Bill, the Conqueror, he adds, got the better of his name-
sake. Although the weapon was unwieldy, the Saxons were expert in
wielding it; and whether through their superior muscular development,
or whether they nad less Opposition to contend with, there is no doubt
they succeeded in carrying their bills far more easily than Ministers
nowadays do theirs.
For the still further comfort and enjoyment of their enemies, the
Saxons armed themselves with daggers, javelins and spears; of which
latter some were barbed and others broad and leaf-shaped. Of the
barbed ones Asser saith, that their use was "trulye barb-arous;" but
the others may have possibly been used with some politeness. We
can imagine civil Saxons saying, "By jour leaf!" when they parried
the home-thrust of the spear of an assailant.
Although, as every schoolboy knows, the Saxons owed their name
to the Scytnic tribe, Sacassani, called otherwise Saxones, stupid people
have persisted in deriving it from Seax, a word meaning a curved
dagger, which tradition says they wore. To support this foolish
notion, these ninnies turn to Nennius, or as we rather should call
him, Ninnius; and quote from him a speech, which he reports to have
been made by the chairman at a certain public dinner at Stonehenge,
which there is reason to believe was an apocryphal repast. Ninnius
says this dinner was turned into a tea-fight by the chairman, Mr. Hex-
gist, jumping on the tabic, and shouting "Take your Seaxes!" as a
signal to the Saxons; who, having hid those weapons in the pockets of
their braccse, drew them forth forthwith, and bagged about three
hundred of their Ancient British guests. Of course, if this story were
proved true, it might be cited as a proof that the Saxons used the
seax; but, as the proof wants proving, we don't believe they did, for
any donkey knows better than to pin his faith upon the tale of
NENNIA8S.
Another name for the Seax was, we learn, the Sica; and the Vene-
rable Bede has told another story of it, which, for aught we know,
may be as mythical as that which lias been told. According to the
* The sword which is here mentioned may perhaps have been the one which, the
poets say. Kino Arthur christened his "Excalibar:" and with such a name as
this, there really is no saying what a blade might not accomplish. We have, how-
ever, looked to the latest of authorities, ana as the Idyllt of the King contain no
mention of the feat, we incline to think the tale has not a leg to stand upon.
Venerable, King Edwin, of Northnmbria, was attacked by an assassin
sent by CwicnELM (pronounced Switch'em) who had been made, or
else had made himself, the King op Wessex. The assassin gained an
audience on pretence of having a message to deliver to King Edwin,
and when that monarch graciously asked what he had to say, the
ruffian made a poke at him with a poisoned sica, exclaiming with a bad
pun as he did so. "I'll mak' sicca/"* An attendant "thegn" named

Lilla. seeing the king's danger, would have used his shield to save
him; but unluckily his shield had gone that morning to be mended,
and all Lilla could do was to (ling himself between his monarch and
the murderer, and nobly throw away his life to save that of his king.
Persons who sing songs may perhaps nave heard it stated that "Lilla i
a lady" but in the Anglo-Saxon time Lilla was a man; and whatever
were the rank or station of a "thegn," this story goes to prove that
Lilla was a noble man.
We come now to the costume of the civil Anglo-Saxons, having done
with the uncivil ones, called otherwise the military. And here the
reader will no doubt be somewhat startled when we tell him, that
having carefully got up some mountains of MSS., and waded through
whole oceans of books upon the subject, we are driven to conclude that
for nearly four whole centuries but little change, or none, was noticed
in the fashions! A fact so extraordinary of course needs the strongest
proof, but there is evidence collateral, besides direct, to cite for it.
According to Monvaucon, the Franks kept to one fashion during just
as long a period, and springing like the Saxons from an oriental source,
they too showed an oriental liking for old raiment. For the sake
though of the cleanly reputation of our ancestors, we trust they did
not further prove their oriental origin by adopting in their persons the
practice of the Persians. We are told, these Eastern people not
merely handed down their fashions to their children, but they left their
wardrobes as heirlooms to them also; so that sons not only stood in
their fathers' shoes, but wore the gaiters of their grandfathers, and
their great-great-grandfathers' great coats. Babies, when they grew
big enough, put on their parents' pinafores; and the identical same
garments descended to descendants, and were handed down as long as
they would hang together. It is therefore not unlikely that the raiment
of a Persian, in its ultimate threadbariness, bore somewhat of resem-
blance to the garment of the Irishman, which was not made of cloth,
sure, but of holes just stitched together.
But, however long deferred, changes, like 1-teform Bills, must be
made at last; and accordingly, we find, the Saxons when they alteied
their religion, changed their raiment, and when they conformed to
Christian doctrines they put on Christian dress.
One of the chief novelties in the dress worn by civilians from the
Eighth to the Tenth century was, that for the first time then our
ancestors wore shirfs. We learn from Edingartus that they were
made of linen; but whether they were starched or not he quite omits
to tell us, nor does he say if they were mostly worn with buttons or
with studs. Conjecturing the former, we would ask the feeling reader
to drop the tear of pity to the memory of him, who was the first to feel
the agony of finding that his dress shirt had been sent home with a
* The Venerable Beds omits to mention this remark, which the reader of Scotch
history may doubtless recollect is therein said to have been used at a somewhat
later period. But of course this is no proof that the words were not made use of at
the time of which we write, and, for aught we know, the Scotchman may havo
been a plagiarist

button off!—a discovery which somehow is quite certain to be made at
a time when one is dressing to dine with punctual people, who regard
one as a murderer if one comes
two minutes late.
Over this was worn a tunic,
made of woollen stuff or linen,
according to the season, and open
at the neck so as to put on like
the shirt. It descended, as that
Ass-er tells us, "kneearly toe
y* knee:" and was confined by a
belt or girdle round the waist.
We find its Saxon name was roc;
so if Sinbad was a Saxon, he might
have fitly worn this garment when
he visited the roc's nest. Its chief
peculiarity was however in the
sleeve, which was made quite long
enough to cover up the hand, and
was worn in rolls or wrinkles from
the elbow to the wrist. The use
of having sleeves so long perhaps
may be conjectured, on the ground
that very possibly they served by
way of gloves, of which there is
no mention so early in our history;
and in this respect their wrinkles
might put our daughters up to
one, and teach them how to keep
their hands warm, without dipping
them so deeply as they now do in ou" pockets, where they look to find
the wherewithal to fit them weekly with new kids.
A short cloak called a mentQ was worn over the tunic, and fastened
on the breast or on the shoulder with a brooch. This mentil, or mantle
as we now-a-days should call it, could be thrown off or assumed by
merely slipping the head through: as is brought to light quite plainly
by an old illumination, in which a Saxon gent is pictured fighting witn
a lion. A mantle is here seen lying by the lion, much the same as Mr.
Pl/ramus's in the well-known tragic farce; and as the mantle is left
fastened at the throat, one infers that it was taken off without the
gent's undoing it. Judges say this picture is in fact a Scripture piece,
and that the Saxon gent we speak of is intended for no less a person
than King David. Whether this be really so, we, who are no judge,
are not called on to determine, and we shall therefore show our judg-
ment by not trying to decide.

PHONETIC SPELLING.
A Woolwich Correspondent of the Post informs us that—
11 About 300 girla are employed at a building in tho laboratory deportment of tho
Royal Asonal for the purpoee of making cartridges."
It may be questioned whether the word "Asenal" in the above is a
misprint, or a true indication of the writer's spelling and pronunciation
of Arsenal." There are grounds for suspecting it to be a specimen
of military orthography and manner of speech; but on the other hand
we find the word cartridges correctly spelt: and the young officer who
would write "Asenal" for Arsenal would, instead of cartridge,"
probably put "catridge."
Q. Why is Mrs. Howard Paul like a twenty-pound note P
A. Because she is the double of a Tenor (P.S. In allusion to her
life-like imitation of Ms. Sims Reeves).
INCOME-TAX WORKHOUSES.
We are in for an everlasting Income-Tax. We must lay aside all
hope. Foreigners who hate and envy us, and who want to involve us
all in their own slavery and misery, will go on maintaining armaments
intended for our invasion and subjugation, for ever. We must, there-
fore, provide national defences, superior to their hostile preparations,
and continue eternally increasing them. It will consequently never be
possible to obtain relief from the Income-Tax. Moreover, the Income-
Tax'which we are condemned to suffer will be not only interminable
but everlastingly unfair. Its equitable adjustment is as hopeless as its
cessation. The House of Commons, which mainly consists of capi-
talists and landed proprietors, will naturally for ever refuse to tax
uncertain earnings at a lower rate than certain rents and dividends.
In this denial of justice they will be backed by the labouring masses,
who pay no Income-Tax at all. They will also be supported by the
reckless trading classes, who will pay any premium for unbounded
liberty of speculation; and by grasping and sumptuous persons of the
Robson and Redpath school, greedy of other people s wealth and
lavish of their own, who love a financial system which at once encou-
rages avarice to acquire and luxury to consume, urging the former
passion to get as much money as possible, and the latter to spend it on
a multitude of cheap enjoyments.
Under these circumstances, a certain weak minority will go to the
wall—to the deuce—to the dogs. These are the moderate steady
tradesmen and the professional classes; doctors, lawyers, authors,
artists, and all other people who get their living by their own exertions,
which are liable at any time to be paralysed, or to fail. Then the most
part of them, having none to help them, and having been deprived by
the Income-Tax of the money which they ought to have saved, will of
course have to go to the workhouse—the worst of places on this side
of the grave.
The above premises having been duly considered by those whom
they concern, it will be manifest to such persons that there has arisen
a great necessity of petitioning for the establishment of a better sort of
workhouse; for the comfortable entertainment of decayed respectable
persons, who have for a certain number of years been paying Income-
Tax on the profits of trades and professions, on which they were solely
dependent for their subsistence.
The ordinary Union Workhouse is a place of punishment for impro-
vidence, in which common people are justly afflicted, insulted, and
outraged for having neglected to take sufficient thought for the morrow;
and it seems unjust to consign to the same abode of misery those who
would have provided for their sickness, or old age, or loss of employ-
ment, if they could, but have been prevented from doing so by the
Income-Tax which has confiscated their earnings.
It is possible that the Legislature will listen to the prayer for the
institution of Income-Tax Workhouses, because that concession will
encourage all Drovident persons in danger of destitution to submit to,
instead of trying to evade, the exaction of Schedule D.

A Practical Poem.
The Times invokes Mr. Cowper, the new President of the Board
of Works, to set resolutely to work at cleaning the Serpentine, and
exhorts him honourably to connect his name with the improvement
which would thereby be effected. If Mr. Cowper will take this good
advice, future competitive candidates for Government situations, will,
in answer to the question of their examiners, assuredly declare him to
have been the author of Cowper's Task.

The planet Mercury is rather out of the way of
modern doctors, who prescribe physic irrespec
tively of the influence of the stars. The
mineral so called, however, is quite in their line,

composition of the pill which has been discovered
by Dr. Lescarbault. Sol, in the nomenclature
of the elder chemists, was the scientific term for

discoverer of a new remedy deserves a good
dinner at least as well as the discoverer of a new

profession, which still has to seek a cure for
cancer, hydrophobia, and some other diseases,

THE PLICATURA NEW
FRISETTES for Dressing
Ladies' Hair in the New Style,
designed and made only by
Oxford 8

May I ask, Dear Madam,
what you say to the Plica-
tura New Frisettes, and to
the new style of dressing
ladies' hair by means of
those instruments P Do
you not consider them very
elegantly named? Would
you like to have your own
hair arranged by means of
them, or have you no notion
of such things, or if you
have any, are you not dis-
posed to class them amongst
the kind of appurtenances
of the toilet which you term fandangos? Perhaps your notice has not as
yet been attracted by these interesting novelties; but very likely you
will soon have your maidservants appearing in answer to your bell with
their hair disposed in what you may call a new-fangled style, and will
find, on inquiry, that the arrangement has been made by help of the
.Plicatura New Frisettes. And what will be your remarks on making
that discovery, Mrs. Grundy? I am afraid, Madam, that you will
denominate those young women hussies, and desire them to get out.
.M cili inks, too, that I hear you, in perusing this communication, exclaim:
"Drat the Plicatura New Frisettes, give me the good old paper and
curling-tongs." It may occur to you that you would like to take the
inventor of the former instrument and pinch him with the latter by the
nose. You may feel disposed to serve him as St. Dunstan served a
personage whom you would describe as another rebel. Accept, dear
Madam, the assurance of my profound respect.
I have the honour to be, your ever constant adorer,
IRISH PLAYFULNESS.
On the occasion of the Maynooth Grant being brought forward (for
the last time, we hope), Mr. P. O'Brien is reported to have said:—
"Hooonfeased he never heard this motion broughton without recalling O'Connell's
s;iyii»f_r, 'that the most dangerous enemy to religion that ever existed was a pioua
fool.'
Mr. Spooner looked upon this as applicable to himself, and resented
it accordingly. He did not like being called "a pious fool." How-
ever, his resentment took the following gentlemanly form :—
11 In reference to the remarks of the honourable Member, he said, that if on
reflection tho honourable gentleman could obtain bis own forgiveness, ho had his
most cordially. {CharM.y
We feel inclined, at this disarming retort, to cry out, "Bravo,
Spooner!" It had the effect of calling Mr. O'Brien upon his legs
to apologise, when that gentleman
"-Explained, that when ho had used the playful expression complained of, it was
very far from his intention to be personally offensive to," &c.
When an elephantine horse kicks out vehemently, as though he
would knock the Great Pyramid down, the timid bystander is fre-
quently told "not to be alarmed,—it's only his play, Sir." Mr. P.
O'Brien kicks, and fancies he is "playful." We would much rather
keep out of the reach of his playfulness. Poor sensitive Spooner,
how he must have shrunk back, with electric nervousness, when he
saw that great Irish hoof flying up in his face in that way! However,
there is one great comfort,—the Maynooth Grant is over for this year,
at least.

Then Gascoione Cecil, of Salisbury, called his friends together in
his house, and they accoutred the young Du Cane for the battle;
Derby giving him the shield of prudence, and Disraeli the helmet of
sincerity; Pakington adding the spurs of modesty, and Henley
throwing on him the mantle of suavity. And the battle day was set.
And Gladstone looked upon his terrible lance, and smiled grimly, as
thinking how speedily he should sheathe its point in his adversary's
internals.
But on the third night before the battle should have raged, the
crafty Disraeli espied some three or four traitors in the camp of
Gladstone. And he said, Du Cane is a boy; but if I take this
battle on me, those men will revolt against their leader, and shoot him
boldly in the back. And suddenly, and late in the night, and to the
astonishment of all who heard him, Disraeli defied his enemy to com-
bat on the day that had been set for the battle with Du Cane. And
the hearers said, Aba! And Gladstone said nothing, but looked on
his terrible lance. Now, Harp, go it!
The Monday came, and the Armies were drawn up in stern array.
Du Cane, of the county of calves, had been warned that he must not
thrust himself into the melee, and the signal for charging was given.
Proclamation to Gladstone made Disraeli that his Budget might be
good or bad, but that it should certaiuly not be considered until the
Council of Sages had first considered the compact made with the Lord
of the Tuileries, ELECTUSof France. And, invoking the manes of Pitt,
he defied the terrible Gladstone.
Answered the terrible Gladstone, in language of scorn and con-
tumely, that the words of Disraeli were Puerile words, and that for
practical purposes that Compact was fully before the Sages. And he
also invoked the manei of Pitt, and bid Disraeli defiance. Now or
never, Harp. Do it like a bird!
They charged. Well and fairly Disraeli drove his glittering lance
at the Homeric breast of his foe, but upon that etherial armour the
lance shivered into fragments, and the immeasurable spear of Glad-
stone the next instant went into the vitals of his antagonist, who lay
stretched before the armies. Yet he died bravely, and like Memnon
under the death-stroke of Achilles, who slew him between the hosts.
Then Sir Hugh, of Belfast, no mean soldier, rushed upon the adroit
Sir Richard of Wolverhampton, and sought to pin him to the earth,
but that facile warrior with a calm smile of scorn put aside the stroke,
and clove his enemy from the brain to the teeth. Among the Cairns
let one be raised for him," said the still smiling conqueror, wiping his
gory weapon. Next, four champions rushed out, three from the ranks
of Opposition, and one, a traitor from the Gladstonian camp, and his
name was Ayrton. Would ye know the names of the others F There
was Kelly of the Shiny Head, Newdegate the Wild Protestant, and
Malins, the long-winded, and they made a united charge towards
Gladstone. When came a voice like a trumpet-call," Burlibroadbrim
to the rescue!" and the thundering Bright was upon them. The
next moment the Shiny Head was low; the Protestant on the earth
protested with his last breath against free trade; the ling-winded
Malins was slivered like a carrot,; and the traitor Ayrton, in the
grip of Bright, dropped strangled in the dust. "Truly and of a
verity I have been and done it," said the victor, lighting his cigar.
Seymour Fitzgerald drew his sword, and might have done execu-
tion, but that the fiery Russell, who had held himself in with dif-
ficulty, now mingled in the fray, and crossed blades with the gallant
Knight of Horsham. "Enviable fate," said the haughty John, as be
turned from the slain, "to die by the hand of Russell.—tell it with
glory to thy fellow ghosts." That instant, mad with ambition and
vanity, the doomed Horsman was seen in full career, and the battle
paused, as all saw, with a shudder, that he was rushing upon his fate.
Breath was held, hearts heat high, as Horsman, in heedless disregard
of all warning, held on his mad way—he levelled his lance at the broad
breast of the gigantic Palmerston. Not long hung his fate in doubt,
not long had Atropos to pause ere she closed her shears, for with a
laugh of jovial derision the giant heaved his steel mace in air, and
as Bruce shattered the head of De Bohun at Bannockburn, did
Palmeiiston shatter the head of Horsman at a quarter past twelve.
That tearful blow ended the battle—the armies drew off. and counted
their numbers. The Gladstone host, had 293, the vanquished Di»raelites
had hut. 230, and the shouts of victory ascended into the cnlm, cold
air of the wintry morning. Harp, thou hast done well. So well, O
Harp, that thou shalt hang upon the hook henceforth. Harp,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Tuesday. There was a new moon, and the Opposition went into a new
lunacy. To-night Mr. Du Cane's motion, postponed by his Leader,
who thought he saw victory iu another direction, was brought on, and
was battled for three nights. Du Cane, duly instructed at Lord
Salisbury's, moved that much additional money was wanted, but that
it was not the thing to reduce revenue or to increase Income-Tax.
Mr. Punch is not going to immortalise everybody who contributed his
dulness to the debate. On this Tuesday night nobody spoke whom
Mr. Punch cared to leave the Members' Smoking Room to go in and
hear. On the Thursday Mr. Hubbard went to the cupboard of the
Bank of England for arguments against the Budget, but when he got
there the cupboard was hare. Mr. Bkigut made a smart speech for
the Ministers, aud Mr. Whiteside rather an amusing and abusive one
on the other side. On the Friday the greater guns—not those of
greatest Bore—were let off. Gladstone, Disraeli, and Palmerston
finished the fight, and the week ended, as it began, by a tremeudous
beating for the Derbyites. The House of Commons approved of the
principle of the Budget, by 339 to 223—a goodly majority of 116.
Mr. Punch has put together the Budget story in order to save his
invaluable space. As for the proceedings Up-stairs, they have scarcely
demanded his august attention. Lord Derby took an opportunity of
cavilling at the Treaty, and was informed by Lord Granville that
the Treaty was a very good one. Lord Elgin made a speech in his
own honour, about his Chinese proceedings, and bore a warm tribute
to the merit of Captain Srerard Osborne, which Mr. Punch begs
heartily to endorse. Heaps of bills made progress, and there was one
rather interesting debate on the subject of preaching in theatres, which
practice Lord Shaftesbury (Lord Palmerston's bishop-maker)
defended as most beneficial to those who could be brought to listen
to sermons in no other way. The Puseyite Lord Dusgannun had
attacked the practice, hut did not get much support from the Bishops.
Dr. Tait incidentally gave a proof of his liberal and enlightened views,
lor in alluding to theatrical entertainments he deplored that there were
many things done and said on the stage which hindered persons of
religious principles from partaking of "a highly innocent aud improving
amusement." Perhaps the hint from a bishop may do good, both to
those who have a bijjot hatred for the theatre, and those who support
and applaud what is object ionable. The only other thing worth
meution is an announcement by Mr. Gladstone—
"The Licensed Witlers will be glad to hear—
He will not license the Slap-bang for Beer;
Therefore the folks who for elevenpence dine,'
Must still fork out the Browns—or take to Wine."
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.

CHAPTER V.—THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD—(Continued).
ontinuing our study of the
ancient books of fashion, we
find that though the Anglo-
Saxons had no trousers,
they wore drawers, as may
be seen by the drawings of
them which are still left,
extant. These drawers did
not descend, however, lower
than the knee, and so the
modest Saxons mostly wore
a sock of cow's hide to cover
up their calves; which, so
far as we can judge from the
artists of the period, appear
to have been generally turned
out to grass. This leather
sock or buskin was called by
them "scin hose," but as
Edingart informs us it was
sometimes made of linen, it
is probable the Saxons had
then another name for it,
though what that other name
was we must let the reader
guess. For anght we know
or care, they may have called
it "shin nose," from its
covering the shin, or they
may have named it " thin hose," because it was not thick.
Over this sock, hose, or stocking, they wore fillets, bands, or strips
of cloth or wool, or leather, rolled, wound, or twisted round them from
just above the ancle to just below the knee. From this exact descrip-
tion, which an eminent attorney has helped us to draw up, the reader
doubtless will derive a very accurate idea of the nature of the garment
which we wish him to conceive. We may, however, further assist him
in conception of it, by telling him it looked like the hay-bauds of an
ostler, excepting in so far as it looked somewhat different. We own
that clolh, linen or leather does not look much like hay, though nowa-
days in rifle-suits the first is much the colour of it. But the Saxons'
strips of stuff were wound round like our ostlers' hay-bands, unless
indeed the rolls were made to cross each other sandalwise, when they
looked more like the buskius which are worn by our stage brigands,
and which in youthful memories are coupled with bass voices ana
ferociously black looks.
The Saxon shoe (which, by the way, they now and then spelt "scoh"
and now aud then spelt "sceo;" but they had no Lord Malmesbury
to look to their orthography) had an opening down the instep, and
was fastened with a thong. In the illuminated manuscripts it is
mostly painted black, but whether it was worn so in reality we know
not. It is true that Day had not yet dawned in that dark age, nor
could the Saxons' shoes have shone with the lustrous light of Martin.
But it is possible the dandies may have somehow blacked their
shoes, though how that somehow was we have no means now of deter-
mining. The common labourers, it seems, went generally barelegged,
but not often with bare feet; in which respects, we think, if they were
FROM A CHOICE MS. KINDLY LENT BY MR. JOKES.
living now, it is probable that they would do exactly the reverse. It
seems though, like good Christians, the princes and church dignitaries
did their utmost to make up for the bareleggedness of their brethren;
for we find their shoes and buskins represented as of gold, but as all's
not gold that glitters, they most probably were gilt.
These articles composed the civil costume of all classes; those who
call themselves "superior" being distinguished by the fineness, not
the form, of their apparel, and by the jewellery and ornaments with
which they overlaid it. These apparently they wore in great profusion
and variety; and hesides such tilings as brooches, rings, aud chains
and crosses, the swells had golden bells, jewelled in no end of holes;
and still more, made themselves conspicuous by wearing golden brace-
lets, which in our time are a part of solely feminine costume. These
bracelets, we are told, King Alfred used by way of thief-baits; and
had them hung up along the borders of the highways, to test the virtue
of his people, and the vigilauce of his police. But. this fact is, of
course, in the remembrance of the reader, and he will doubtless feel
insulted if we venture to
remind him that King
Alfred was the first to in-
troduce " the Force." We
doubt though if the reader
have an accurate idea of how
our first policemen looked,
when they were out on duty;
and as words would fail us
to convey a fair description,
we subjoin a full-length
portrait of a Peeler of the
period, which has been
transmitted from a most
authentic source.
The clergy iu their dress
were not distinguished from
the laity, excepting when
engaged in doing duty at
the altar. The robes worn
by the bishops consisted of
the alh aud stole, dalmatic
and chasuble, with which
our friends the Pusejiies
have made us well familiar,
and which we think it. t here-
fore is quite needless to
describe. When out of
Church it seems they had a
proneness to the pomps and
vanities they preached against; for an order was put forth ad 785, forbid-
ding them to wear "the tinctured colours of India," colours which were
doubtless looked upon as "fast." It appears too, that, they likewise
did their best to look like laymen, by letting their back hair grow so
as to cover up their tonsure: for a Canon was especially aimed against
this piaclice, and fired oil' as is reported, just nine hundred years ago.
But though forced to shave their heads, the clergy (at least some of them)
were allowed, as a great luxury, to let the hair grow on their chins. By
a Council which was held A D. 1031, it was provided that a priest might
wear a beard or not, precisely as he pleased: au indulgence which had
long been extended to the bishops, but tiil then the lower clergy
had not been indulged with it.
If we believe Tacitus, and we don't sec why we shouldn't, the
Teutonic tribes were generally lovers of lung hair; and by the Franks

it was regarded as a mark of rank, an express law being made that only
the first nobles should be suffered to grow ringlets. Whether the
heirs of noble families, whose hair would not curl naturally, were suf-
fered to use curling-tongs and curl papers or not, we do not find it
mentioned: but as ringlets were the mark of men's being of high birth,
we should think they spared no pains in their capillary cultivation.
Among t he Anglo-Saxons long hair was quite as fashionable as it was
among the Franks: although they suffered more free trade in it, and
passed no protective laws to limit its producers. The clergy preached
for centuries against, the sinfulness of wearing it; but it seems their
preaching acted less like scissors than like bear's grease, and their long
sermons on long hair just made the hair grow all the longer.
Before we leave this head, it should be mentioned that civilians at
this period wore no hats, but went about bare-pated like our Bluecoat
boys and butchers. What their reasons were for doing so, it were a
waste of time to guess. It is probable, however, that being proud of
their long hair, they did not like to hide it, and so declined to wear the
hide caps of the period, with which as we have shown, the soldiers
were disfigured. Although not ornamental, these caps were certainly
a cap-ital protection to the head, and shielded it from blows as well of
weapons as of wind. It is on this account we wonder the civilians did
not use them, for as they wote their hair so long the slightest breath
must surely have blown it in their eyes, unless they had a hat or cap to
keep it out. For instance, when they marched out on a windy day in
March, we can fancy how the air would "play in the ringlets of their
hair, until it made them look as mud as a March hare or a hatter:
though why these creatures should be singled out as samples of
insanity, no creature in his senses could undertake to say.

ANGLO-SAXON GENTS TAKING A HAIRING.
AN ANECDOTE CORRECTED.
A Story from Italy—we have had some good stories from Italy in
the old days, and hope for even better in the new ones—tells us that
the Pope, walking out lately, met a peasant, and suddenly demanded
of him whether he were a Christian. The man replying Yes, the Pope,
in test of his Christianity, put him at the Mosaic Commandments.
The tale proceeds that the man at once broke down, and that the Pope
went off triumphantly, saying that it would be well if men learned the
Commandments before they asked for independence.
Mr. Punch does not mind agreeing with the Pope that a man who
does not. know the Commandments is—unless he happens to obey them
without knowing the exact words—not the person likely to be a very
Sood citizen. Why the swarm of priests, of every dirtiness, around
Lome, have not saturated the minds of the peasantry with religious
teaching, is a question for his Holiness rather than for Mr. Punch. But,
being desirous to verify the above interesting story, Mr. Punch sent to
Home to ascertain what was the truth. It appears that the anecdote
has been wrongly told. The Pope demanded the Commandments.
The peasant ran them over glibly enough until he had finished the
Fourth. Then (according to the Catholic arrangement of the decalogue)
came the Murder law. The peasant had the word on his tongue when
he remembered to whom he was speaking, and he remembered Perugia.

THE WRONG RING FOR LADIES.
"Mr dear Mr. Punch,
"This morning I found such an extraordinary newspaper
which Frederick.—I mean my brother—had left lying about, and in it
such a dreadful account of a shocking exhibition, under the title of
"Great Fight between Joe Nolan, of Birmingham, and John Hicks,
of London, for £60 aside." I had no patience to read it through, as
it was full of stupid words which I could not understand; but at the
end of it I noticed these shameful remarks:—

"Well, then I say it was very wrong, and they ought to have been—
the horrid wretches; knocking and mauling—as they call it—one
another about. They deserve to have been very severely punished for
mauling one another so, according to what it goes on to say :—
"Nolak, In fact, has but little the matter with his upper works, although about
the body he was heavily mauled."
*' Mauled, indeed! They ought to have been both taken up, and put
into prison, and done—I don't know what to! Well worked, at any
rate, both upper works and under works too. And I think gentlemen
ought to be ashamed of themselves to encourage such savages to bruise
and hurt one another. Talk of cruel sports, I am quite sure that
boxing beats cock-fighting.

OPERATIC FINANCE.
The eloquence with which Mr. Gladstone delivered his Budget appears to
have rendered a statement of dry details and disagreeable things extremely
pleasant, indeed absolutely enchanting to those who listened to it. A long speech,
one would think, would be only an aggravation of a recital of hard facts and an
announcement of harder taxation. Yet Mr. Gladstone discoursed financial music
on themes which included an Income-Tax of tenpence in the pound, for the space
of four hours, to the delight of his hearers. He did well to stay till his cold was
gone before attempting to charm their ears wilh the melody of Ways and Means.
Just so would Signor Mario postpone his appearance in a new character in case
he had the misfortune of being attacked with diphtheria. This consideration suggests
an improvement on the present plan of revealing the proposed financial measures
of Government to the House of Commons. Instead of being merely declaimed,
let the Budget in future be sung. By a judicious mixture of air and recitative,
it would not only be rendered additionally agreeable to the ear, but the pleasure of
hearing it would be prolonged considerably beyond the short term of four hours.
The sweet sounds announcing increased taxation would be as sugar to a bitter
pill. In future, therefore, let statesmen who desire to qualify themselves for the
Chancellorship of the Exchequer, study tuneful numbers as well as common arith-
metic; and let that important office be filled, if possible, by a gifted tenor.
WONDERS OF MACHINERY.
One of the advantages which England owes to a free Press may be said to be
sn unlimited power of calico-printing. On this branch of typography, as influenced
by science, a lecture was delivered the other evening at the Koyal Institution by
Professor F. Crace Calvert, concluding with the subjoined statement:—
"The extent to which calico-printing in this country is already curried, may be conceired from
the fact that in 1858, the number of yards of printed calico exported would reach twice round the
Globe."

MR. BULL ENLARGING HIS BUSINESS.
Mr. John Bull having lately been obliged to incur an enormous outlay in consequence
of the necessity of making the vast repairs and alterations requisite for the defence, and
security of his Extensive Premises, is sensible that bis ohjrct of reimbursing himself will
be most speedily and certainly effected by an unlimited expansion of his gigantic Business,
in all its numerous and important, branches. He has accordingly come to the deter-
mination of devoting his whole energies to the prosecution of Trade, in defiauce of all
obstacles, and irrespectively of every other consideration. For the thorough accomplishment,
of ibis grand design, he is fully resolved to make the most tremendous sacrifices, at an
immediate loss, which would he ruinous under ordinary circumstances. Accordingly it is his
intention to adopt a system which will virtually be one of
ENTIRELY FREE IMPORTS,
He has also made up his miud to run every risk which may be
Unlimited Exportation of Coal
and everything else, in pursuance of an agreement, into'which he has entered with bis
regardless of reciprocity,
involved in allowing the
Majesty the
ok the French, which will also involve the unrestricted
ADMISSION OF FOREIGN WINE,
subject, only to a slight duty for purposes of revenue, which will most likely be ultimately
altogether rppealed. By the same arrangement all French manufactures, Silks, Gloves,
Works of Ornament and Luxury, will be taken on the same advantageous terms. To
provide for the temporary deficiency which may be apprehended as the immediate consequence
of a bold Commercial Policy, Mr. Bull is fully prepared to submit to pay the awful penalty
of a galling, oppressive, and inquisitorial Income-Tax amounting to the amazing, awful,
and portentous figure of
TENPENCE IN THE POUND!
By the proof which he has thus afforded of his decided resolution to do Business on the
largest and most liberal scale, Mr. Bull hopes to secure the immensely increased custom of
his European Patrons, and all Consumers in the other quarters of the Globe.
J B. begs to state, that he has now nearly completed the Insurance of bis Premises, which,
beside 1 lie regular Police, are guarded by a numerous and effective force, consisting of his
Young Men, by whose assistance he trusts to be enabled to repel attack as well as to defy
competition.

A New Feature that will Shortly be Seen.
So numerous are the Divorces and Judicial Separations now becoming, that we should not be
surprised to see them regularly inserted in the Papers every day amongst the Births, Deaths,
ana Marriages, taking up their place, with becoming modesty, after the Utter. W e throw out
the notion for the benefit of any cheap paper that is anxious to bid largely for notoriety.
What a fearful column, too, they would make every week iu the Observer; and we have not
the least doubt it would prove, especially to the friends and acquaintances of the parties
"ive one. Borrowing the title of the Colonne, that stands with
I Place de la Bastille, it might be called The Column of Liberty.
"CHAPLAIN, BUTLER, BRATS AND
ALL."
Is there no mistake about the following
advertisement, which appeared a day or two ago
in the Times:—

Christian need apply. Address A.B., 5, Suho Square, by

Surely there is Borne misprint. The Soho
Square personage is made to ask for a Butler,
but surely he means Chaplain. What is the con-
nection between decided Evangelical views and
the duties of the butler's pantry? Can only a
Calvinist detect a corked bottle, and is an Armi-
nian's nose dead to the aroma of Burgundy?
Must one despise good works before one cau
appreciate good port, and is a belief that nine-
tenths of one's acquaintances will be eternally
unhappy necessary to keeping the cellar-book
straight and airing the claret before dinner?
Evidently there must be some mistake. A. B.
cannot be such a fool as the advertisement would
make him. We are the more inclined to think
that he wants, or at least needs, a chaplain, to
teach him a little of what is fitting, inasmuch as
real Christians do not usually speak of Heaven's
gift of lit t le children as an " encumbrance." They
remember something of a Book where children
are mentioned in another way. Evidently A. B.
has a right to have his advertisement corrected.
By the way, what does he mean by saying he
will have "no Nominal Christianr" Is the
chaplain or butler, or whatever he may be, to
represent himself as something else than a
Christian? It may be so, for his proposed master
A. B. certainly does the same in his advertise-
ment. We don't know what sort, of a cellar of
wine A. B. may keep, but it strikes us that as
Mr. Compton said in a play, "his bottle of
bruins has suddenly come to the thicks."
ASTROLOGY IN QUEER STREET.
Tit E other day, in a report of the proceedings in
the Insolvent Debtors' Court, there appeared a
case under the alarming designation-
"In re Francis Moore."
What! everybody must have exclaimed on
meeting the above name in such a position, is
this the pass that things have cntne to with our
old friend, Francis Moore, PhysicianF On
further perusal, however, it appeared, to the
relief of the reader, that—
"Mr. Saroooo applied to vacate proceeding*, on tho
satisfactory plea that the debts were paid and satisfied."
Rejoicing, therefore, to find that Francis
Moore has surmounted bis difficulties, we sup-
Sose that Saturn has got out of conjunction wit h
lars, or some other equally malefic planet.;
and accordingly that Francis Mooke, Physician,
if he is the Physician, has got out of his scrape.

PAROCHIAL ANTHOLOGY.
In the clerical House of Commons, or Lower House of
Convocation, at its last sitting, a reverend member brought
forward a proposal which would be deserving of encou-
ragement, if there were any hope that it could be satis-
factorily accomplished. According to the Report of the
proceedings of that venerable body:—
"Abchdeacoh SxNnroRD, with the permission of the House, read
a notice which he had placed upon the paper. It was to the effect,
that hia Grace the President be respectfully requested to appoint a
committee of the Upper House to act with a committee of the
Lower House for the preparation of a draft-book of hymns and a
selection of psalms, which, if approved by Convocation, ahould be
submitted to Her Majesty, with a view to its adoption in all
churches and chapels that might be willing to receive it.
Lord Byron once invoked a forty-parson power to
enable him to sing on a certain subject. A committee of
the Upper House of Convocation, and a committee of the
Lower House of Convocation combined, would constitute
a quantity of parson-power considerably above that which
was desired by the noble bard. It is unlikely, however,
that even the united parson-powers of the bishops ana
clergy will be sufficient for the preparation of a draft-book
of hymns fit to be sung. Parson-power is one thing and
poet-power is another thing. Hymns which are not poetry
are doggerel. Hitherto the latter article has been almost
the sole product of parson-power applied to versification.
Parson-power may indeed succeed in making a selection of
psalms from the Psalter, because that is a collection of
poems in which a bad choice is impossible, the choice being
supposed to be limited to the text pure and simple, uncor-
rupted and unturned into jingling rhymes by audacious
dunces. It is to be hoped that in choosing psalms and
hymns, parson-power will confine itself to the sphere ol
safety, and not appoint to be. sung in churches a volume ol
inelegant extracts in bad verse, uninspired even by the
Muse.
What's in a Name?
The London Irish Volunteer Corps have been adver-
tising for a target ground. Since then, we read that Mb.
ls.wt Butt has been offering his services to the corps.
In the absence of a target, they are foolish if they do not
put up with a Butt.
Good Title foe a Cotton Lord.—Lord Cottenham.
SHALL WE SMOKE ON KAILWAYS?
Menaced, Mr. Punch is Boreas; entreated, he is Zephyr. When
he reads in railway stations and carriages insclent qffichei, commanding
him not to Smoke (he delights in the weed), threatening him with
fines and imprisonments, and holding up to him instances in which the
Company has been down upon a smoker, he naturally lights up the
largest cigar in bis possession, blows a cloud into the face of the ticket
clerk, sends the guard to buy mm fuseet, stalks up and down the plat-
form in a cloud of fume, and on entering the carriage, hands round bis
cigar-case to every fellow-passenger. And in this course he intends to
persevere wherever the Directors of a Railway presume to be imper-
tinent. But when he found, on a recent journey on the Brighton and
South Coast Line, such an appeal as this, he, like the pious .Knkas,—
"Rolled his eyes, and every moment felt
Hia manly soul with more compassion melt."
Thus gently plead the Brighton Directors—
"Tn consequonce of the numerous and increasing Complaints of Smoking in the
Carriages ou the line, tho Directors have resolved to appeal to their Passengers on
the subject."
Very right, indeed. The passengers, and not any whimsical or arbi-
trary officials, are the proper tribunal of appeal in such a matter. This
is trulv constitutional, and in the spirit of Magna Charta, and Lord
John Russell himself would approve the course. Such an introduction
prepossesses the reader in favour of the appeal. Let us proceed—
"The Directors feel assured that if those who thus disregard tht R'gulatio*» of
this and every other Railway, framed in thla rospect to secure the general conve-
nience, were aware of the discomfort and annoyance they inflict on the great
ninJ'Ttty of Passengers, not only while Tobacco is smoked, but from the Carriages
being rendered offeni-ive to those who travel in thorn at other tiniec, tbey would
refrain from ooing so during tbe short period occupied by the journeys on this line."
• Mr. Punch begs to assure the courteous Directors that he is quite
aware of the discomfort and annoyance the anti-smoking Regulations
of that and every other railway inflict on the great majority of pas-
sengers; as truly stated by the grammatical construction of the above
lines. He is also aware that this is not what the Directors mean, but
the reverse thereof. They mean to say that most people do not like
smoking, and that the carriages in which smoking has taken place
smell disagreeably. Now, he takes leave to contest the first propo-
sition, and will do so on statistical grounds. Referring to an abstract
of a Blue Book before him, and turning to the Customs accounts for
one year (Mr. Charles Knight is responsible for the figures, and
lie is never wrong), he finds that the very largest item of all that go to
make up the Twenty odd millions of income is the duty on imported
Tobacco. Even miserable Tea—that contemptible mess which duchesses
take before dinner, and other women whenever they can get it with
chatter—produces less than the noble Tobacco — nay, here are the
figures:—
Tobacco, stemmed . . . £2,246,465
Unstemmed . ... 2.888.490
Manufactured, and Snuff . 119,338
£5,254,293
Upwards of Five Millions of Pounds paid upon the article which
"most, persons" do not like. Five Millions of Pounds, and this for
duty only, mind, to which we must add the rest of the price of tbe
article, if we would know what the Smoker pays. But let us leave it
at Five Millions of Sovereigns. Now, how many people travel on
Railroads in Fngland F Mr. Punch refers to another Parliamentary
abstract. Taking the first and second classes for the year—he omits
the third, because, notoriously, the unfortunate third class would all
smoke if they might, to comfort themselves in their pens—the numbers
are: —
First 6,771,060
8eC0ud . . 16,>.35,S0S
£23,706,363

journey is counted, and a commercial traveller may be 100 in the above
number, while Mb. Tennyson's clerk that went out of town, and
dreamed, may be 2. Well, knock off about half for women, whose
opinion is not wanted on a tobacco question, or any other. There are
twelve millions of passengers. Knock off a million of the Five sove-
reigns for people who take tobacco but don't travel, and you have four
millions of sovereigns paid for tobacco by railway travellers. Now,
Mr. Punch requests the Directors' attention. They assume that most
passengers don't like baccy F Do they mean to say that a lesser number
than Six millions of passengers contribute the enormous sum of four
millions for their weeds? Bosh, bother, bah, bo, bee! Are we mad—
is the world mad? It figures mean anything, they prove, in an extra-
Gladstonun and irrefragable manner, that at least 8 out of every
10 railway travellers hunger and thirst for the Weed. As for the
smell that is left in carriages where people have smoked, he does not
deny that it is disagreeable for the moment, but if the Directors had
the carriages properly aired, and a few pastiles or some of Piesse and
Lubin's fumigating ribbon burned in them every morning, the incon-
venience would be scarcely perceptible. So we go on again:—
*' The Directors invito tho co-operation of Fassengors, in discountenancing
Smoking in the Carriages, and they trust that any who have without due consider-
ation fur others, evaded the Regulations of the Company, will abstain from a
practice which interferon with the general comfort, and thus relieve the Directors
from the necoasltyof protecting the travelling Public from inconvenience, by resort-
ing to any other course than this appeal to the good feeling and sense of propriety
of those to whom it is addressed."
As regards the Short Time plea in the penultimate paragraph, the
Brighton line has certainly more right to make it than any other Com-
pany, for the time is short, and the travelling is exceedingly rapid and
creditably regular. Bat even the flying express makes an hour of it,
and who can go without a cigar for a whole hour? If the Directors
of one of the very best lines in the world find it impossible to prevent
passengers from resorting to the Nicotian Consoler, is not the case
very strong against the prohibitory movement P If one cannot do
without a weed while the Brighton engine is tearing away with one
like a fiery drairon mad with terror at Being threatened with having
Proverbial PhilosophyxeaA to him. how can one exist without the baccy,
while the Eastern Counties is drawling away into the fens, or the
Great Western is taking about three hours, on Sundays, to do about
thirty miles. Therefore the courteous Directors need not hiut at
"any other course" than courtesy. They might as well attempt to
put down sneezing, by a bye-law, as smoking. Especially will not
English people be dictated to in a matter which should be one of free
will, and the more it is sought to prevent smoking, the more will the
carriages be found unpleasantly odorous.
Therefore, recognising the extreme politeness and good taste of the
Brighton Directors' Appeal, and admitting that it does credit to a
Board of Gentlemen, who look on the public as their friends to be con-
veyed, not as their victims to be fleecedi Mr. Punch is compelled to say
that even this meritorious attempt to please low-church parsons, old
fogies, and women, will not do. The real remedy is
A SMOKING SALOON.
When this is established, Mr. Punch himself will be the first to spy
out, inform on, and if need, collar and kick anybody who even mentions
tobacco in an ordinary carriage. Till then, Fumut, Gloria Mundi,
wherever a fellow-passenger raises no objection.
LEGAL STREET-SHOWS.
ENTIMENTALIRTS who
sigh for the departed
"good old times,"
and grieve that Eng-
land is not now the
"merry England"
that it used to be,
may derive some con-
solation from perusal
of the following,
which describes a
scene at Appleby
on the morning of
Shrove Tuesday:—
"The ordinary routine
and parade which accom-
pany the judges as part
of the high sheriff's office
and duty in providing
javelin men as escort and
to koep order in Court,
and trumpeters to an-
nounce the coming of
the judges, were here
enlivened by the high
sheriff, Mr. Matthew
Bespon Harrison, hav-
ing dressed his javelin
men and trumpeters in
the costume of Charles
the First. The men
appeared dressed in
leathern doublets with
blue velvet slooves
slashed with white silk,
blue velvet breeches.high
buff buckskin turnover
boots, sombrero hats buttoned up at one side, and ornamented each with a long blue and white feather, and
crossnolts with large buckles suspending old fashioned large-handled swords; a red sash round the waist com-
pleted their costume. The trumpeters wore grey hats looped up; in other respects the same dress. The
javelins also were very formidable, antique-looking weapons. Most of the men were handsome, tall young
fellows: and so decked out, as t hoy marched before the judges down the old-faabioned street of the town on a
bright frosty morning, the tops of their javelins glittering in the sunshine, and the gay long feathers in their
hats waving In the wind, they carried back the mind to tho days of the cavaliers, and certainly formed a very
picturesque and, in these days of unadorned utility in dross, a very uuusual sight.14
The inhabitants of Appleby (and those in petticoats especially) ought certainly to pass a
vote of thanks to their high sheriff for giving them this glimpse into the ancient books of
fashion, and allowing them the privilege of seeing, gratis, such a show. Decked out as they
were, the "handsome tall young fellows" must have found especial favour in the female eyes
which gazed on them, and their quaint and antique dresses must have formed a pleasing
contrast to the "unadorned utility of modern masculine apparel. The turnover buff boots
doubtless quite took the shine out of the blacked hightow called "Balmoral:" and the
sombrero hats with feathers must have made all the bystanders who wore the chimney-pot
chapeau groan with mingled agonies of jealousy and grief.
Judging from the taste which Mb. Matthew Benson Harbison displayed in the selection
of the costumes of his corps, we can't help thinking him related to his operatic namesake, from
whose wardrobe the dresses may have come. But be this so or not, we think that his costumerie

reflects the greatest credit on him, and we
very much applaud him for that which he has
done. Street-shows are in general most melan-
choly failures, but that at Appleby was certainly
a very marked success; and the High Sheriff is
deserving of the highest commendation for the
way in which he catered to entertain the public.
Any one who anyhow does anything to dissipate
the dulness of a country town has a claim to be
esteemed a benefactor to his species, and if the
town of Appleby do not erect a statue to him.
we shall consider Mb. Harbison has been bilked
of his deserts.
A Grand Transformation Scene.
At Christmas time, every Theatre has its
Grand Transformation Scene. This year they
have been grander, more beautiful, than usual.
But, without exception, the most startling, if
not precisely the grandest, Transformat ion Scene
this year has been that of turning the theatres
into churches and chapels! The Beadle's Staff
has achieved a greater wonder than Harlequin's
Wand.
Colouring the Truth.
We are told on one hand, that Truth lies at
the bottom of a well. On the other hand, the
Latin proverb informs us, that there is "In
Vino Veritas." Probably the contradiction may
be reconciled, by supposing that the Wine
when there is Truth in it, has been largely
mixed with water drawn from the Well that is
the fixed abode of Veritat. We should not
mind if wine merchants never put anything
worse into their wine. We only wish that all
adulteration were as harmless.
XX-Chequers.
The Chancellor op the Exchequer has
yielded to the pressure of the Great Brewers as
represented by the London publicans, and with-
drawn the licenses to Eating-house keepers.
Surely the vendor of "One o" mutton thoroughly
done is more of a Victualler I han the retailer
of Thick and Slab's Entire?
Why should any one afflicted with defective
legs turn clergyman?
Because he would cease to be a layman (lane

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
i
A GOOD OLD COMIC CLOWN WANTED.

"Mr. Punch, Sir,
"I want to say a word or two upon what seems to me a matter of great national importance,
and as the nation reads your paper more than any other, it is naturally to you that I am tempted to
address myself. Sir, the subject I allude to, is the marked decline of Pantomime, and the gradual
extinction of the good old Comic Clown, and if this be not a matter of importance to the nation, 1
shall be obliged to it to tell me one that is.
"In my young days a pantomime, Sir, strictly was a pantomime: a tale, that is, 'exhibited in gesture
and in dumb snow;' it is thus great Doctor Johnson in his wisdom has defiued it, and there then
was no departure from the meaning of the word. The tale which was presented was always one of
Love, and showing how the course of it never doth run smooth. A good and evil fairy used their
influence through the Opening, and at the end of it the good one transformed the faithful lovers into
harlequin and columbiue, and sent them dancing happily towards the Bowers of Bliss: while to worry
them by the way, clown and pantaloon were summoned by the crutch of the bad fairy, and respectively
emerged from the clothes of the Cruel Father, and of the Rich and Ugly Suitor who had had his ears
boxed. To save him from these persecutors, the good fairy then gave harlequin his magic cap and
wand, the former making him invisible, while the latter gave him power to perform his fairy tricks,
whereby he was enabled to punish his pursuers, and keep himself and columbine safe out of their
clutch.
"Well, Sir, I need not say how we have changed all this, nor how much, to my thinking, we have
changed it for the worse. What story there is now-a-days is no longer told in dumb show; I
suppose our pantomimists are not clever enough for that. Conversation is no longer carried on by
gesture, or in cases of extreme emergency by scrolls. Instead of this, burlesque writers are paid to
5ut bad puns in very much worse verse, and with this mixture are the public nightly dosed, without,
think, tneir being very much the better for it. Moreover, Sir, the fairies are of far less account now
than they were, and their influence on the love-tale is not half so well defined. Indeed, our children's
faith in them must oft be sadly shaken, by seeing the good fairy do the bad one's work, and having
helped the lovers to their happy change of life, change their persecutors also to continue to torment
them. Then, on the principle of quantity making up for quality, pantomimists now-a-days appear in
'double companies;' so that besides a brace of harlequins and columbines, we get a pair of pantaloons
and a couple of bad clowns. Novel nondescripts called 'sprites,' too, come bounding on unbidden, and
twist and twirl about until one's brain whirls at the sight of them: while, to put a climax on these
modem improprieties, there sometimes comes a creature called a Harlequina, whose ears, if I were
Columbine, I certainly should box!
"But to my mind, Sir, by far the worst part of the business is that the Hot Poker is now virtually
abolished, and the good old Comic Clown has ceased almost to exist. It is true that the hot poker
still lingers on some stages, but alas! in modern hands it is a dull and pointless instrument. No
longer is it heated in the fire of ancient wit, no longer is it used to poke a joke with any point in it.
But ah! your good old Comic Clown, Sir, could wield it to some purpose. In his hands it was
always safe to Bring the house down. Every time he used it he was sure to get a roar. When he
tickled pantaloon with it, I have split my sides with laughing, and have nearly died to see him take it
up by the hot end and try to put it in his pocket. What fun there was moreover in the way in which
he walked; his hands in his wide pockets (like our young swells with their 'pegtops'), and his
toes so much turned in that one fancied he was born so, ana that an act of surgery would be required
to turn them out. How comically clever too he always was in thieving, and in making his excuse
when detected in the act! Your modern clown steals things as though they really were his own. or at
least as if he had a perfect right to take them. He does his highway robberies with brutal force
and clumsiness, and thinks all the fun consists in the amount of cuffs he gives people.
"But not so did Grimaldi. and those good old-fashioned clowns who studied in his school. When
they picked apocket they did it like a pick-pocket, and showed plainly that they feared the law was at
their neels. They preached too quite a sermon on the silliness of thieving, in the tortures which they
suffered through possession of their plunder, and their ineffective struggles to conceal it. Many a
budding thief, I think, must have been deterred from blossoming, by seeing how Grimaldi was
worried with the warming-pan he had contrived to steal, but couldn't make away with: how in despair
he'd try to bide it in his all-pouching pocket, and what an utter fool he looked when, having left the
handle out, he was dragged away to prison by it.
"But, alas! Poor Joey Yorick! thy shade no longer visits us. Thy mantle hath long since
been torn to bits by rival clowns,
and scarcely a square inch of it on
any of them (if we except, perhaps,
Mr. Leclerq at the Haymarket)
is visible. Almost the last shred
I have seen was on the shoulders of
Tom Matthews; but Tom is now
Old Tom, and cannot play the fool
with such spirit as he could. I saw
him t' other day (another new-fangled
idea! they play pantomimes by day,
now !) in Jack and the Beanstalk, but
he was only man enough to take the
part of an old woman, and I fear lie
won't again appear in his clown's
petticoats. He sang "Hot Codlins"
in a way, though, that made me
mindful of the past, and his efforts to
amuse me were vastly more successful
than those of Mr. Flexmore, who
later in the piece did his best (or
worst) to imitate him. Mr. F., I
fancy, is a student in the French
school, which as a Briton I, of course,
put far below the British. To my
thinking, French clowuism partakes
less of the comic than the acrobatic
element: and as I like to go to the-
atres not to wonder but to laugh, I
confess that 1 prefer our good old
English style ot fooling. Clowns like
Mr. Flexmore are agile and can
dance; but to my mind a mere pos-
turerisnot apantomimist, and dancing
hornpipes is no more the business of a
clown than sinking nigger-songs is the
vocation of a bishop.
"No, no, Mr. Punch. Our good
old Comic Clown is a British insti-
tution, and Monsieur Pierrot must not
be permitted to supplant him. If we
allow this innovation, we Bhall next
find that our pantomimes are 'taken
from the French,' and that, Sir, to
my thinking, would eternally disgrace
us. A pantomime at Christ mas is a
good old English dish, and ought to
be served up in the good old English
fashion. The clown should do his
antics after the antique, and not at-
tempt to flavour them with any modern
French sauce.l' ,1 have no wish to see
bouilli take the place of our roast beef,
and would as soon employ a foreigner
to get me up a pantomime, as I would
hire a French cook to make me a
plum pudding. Your Pierrot can gri-
mace and kick his legs about, I grant;
but my palate has been trained to
relish good substantial English jokes,
and 1 own I have no liking for
Pierrofs foreign kick-shaws. Give
me, I say, the fine old Joe Grimaldi
style of clowning, and let me still en-
joy my butter slide and my hot poker.
Gorgeous transformation scenes will
never, to my taste, supply the want
of tricks; nor will a scanty diet ol
what should be fun and frolic be made
up for by a glut of what is now bad
gas and glitter.
"I remain, Sir, yours,
"An Englishman, and One oi
the Old Sort."
A Jewel that should be Univer-
sally Worn.
Temperance, like a diamond of the
first water, shines more brilliantly the
better it is cut. With a man the
I reverse holds good: he ceases to shine
I the moment he gets "cut."

eus! Ouk worst fears have
been realised. Her enemies
have triumphed, and England,
erstwhile merry," sitteth
groaning in despair. Aris-
tocratic Nonchalance, in
league with classic Imbecility
hath, as we predicted, turned
traitor in the camp, and
thrown open the gates to let
in the invader. The dotard
Palmerston, in concert with
the dull and drivelling Glad-
stone, hath done the dastard's
deed for which Posterity will
damn him, and e'en Antiquity
would, if it had but known it,
joined the curse!
Alas! Yes, it is too true.
Government have carried
their reduction of the wine dut ies, and the trade in British beer and British
brandy therefore dies. tVhile we write, the French invasion of cheap
wines has begun. Their light clarets are trooping to supplant our " heavy
wet." Thin Bordeaux is coming to knock down our.bottled stout, and
rot-gut Roussillon will wave the spigot over prostrate Bass. Allsopp's
ale will fall ne'er more to rise again fin price). Reid will soon be
shaken by the ill wind of adversity. Whitbread & Co.'s Entire will
be entirely swept away, and not a drop remain unspilt of Truman's
half and half. Barclay will take refuge in the Courts of Basinghall
Street, and over head and ears in trouble will be Charringtok and
Head. Meux's double X will be X-tinguished by Mexloc, while the
frenzied friends of Free Trade will in bad French cry. "tant Meux!"
And is this—let us gravely ask our readers—is this nothing? Do
you call it nothing to destroy the British nation P—by depriving it of
health and wealth, nay, everything but name P For that the budget
will be nationally the death of us, who doubts P Rob a Briton of his
beer, and you rob him of his life. You take away his stamina, if you
take away his stout. To substitute sour claret for sweet wholesome
malt and hops, would be, at a blow, to break, his staff of life, and sap
the very bulwarks of the British constitution!
Yet this is what the enemies of England have been doing; and fools,
to quote the poet—
"Havo werry much applauded them,
For what they've been and done."
Little think they of the consequences of this rash, this awful act!
Little think they that they've mined the deep foundations of the
State, and dealt Britannia a home-thrust which she for ages hence
must stagger under. Little reck they that our soldiers will lose their
pith and pluck, and our sailors get as watery and weak as their French
drinks; that our navies will ere long become as nerveless as our
navvies, and our armies be deprived of e'en the strength to use their
legs. Thinned by thin sour wine, our forces soon will be our weak-
nesses. True Britons, it is well known, subsist mainly upon beer; and
if they cannot keep their pecker up, goodbye to their pluck.
As we are addressing a moneyed class of men, we consider less their
pleasures than we do their pockets. Else might we dilate on the de-
liciousness of Beer, and the delights which it bestows upon the minds
which truly relish it. Dulee est desippere. Sweet it is to sip, and yet
more delectable is it to drink deeply of. Nor is its nutrition of less
note than its niceness. As Plato well remarks in the second of his
Georgia, "Siney Burro friget Venus, which, we need not tell our
readers, means that malt and hops invigorate the body, Baccus being,
as all know, the classic synonym for Beer.
And alas! this mind-improving, muscle-fortifying beverage are we
going to exchange for some few hogsheads of vile hog-swill! Well,
What must be, must," as Shakspeare's Hamlet hath it. But the
game of the French Emperor may be seen with half an eye by any one,
like us, who is not blinded, ay, and hoodwinked, by the spectacles of
Office. When his clarets have invaded us, his cavalry will follow them,
and in our beerless and brainless state an easy conquest will be pos-
sible. After giving us his bottles, be will come and give us battle,
and then woe betide the dupes and dotards who have trusted him!
The Sun of England will set, and her fair daughters be left brotherless.
The flaunting flag of Liberty, of Britons long the boast, no more will
nutter o'er the sea that girts our native coast! The Gallic Cock will
crow on this side of the Channel, while 'neath the paw of the French
poodle will the British lion crouch, and whine pulingly for mercy with
his tail between his legs, however much the "tizer may try to get his
monkey up.

EIGHTS OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
We hear a great deal about the Rights of Women; and it seems to
be taken for granted, that there are certain rights which women in
general agree in claiming for themselves. Some difference, however,
as to what are and are not the rights of women, appears to prevail
among the ladies of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. In the House of
Lords we find, on the one hand, that—
'Lord Bcngannon presented a petition, signed by S00 women of Aylesbury and
its immediate neighbourhood, against any measure for legalising marriage with a
deceased wife's sister. He assured their lordships that the strongest repugnance
prevailed among the women of England to any change in the law; and the present
petition was only one out of many hundreds with which their table would before
long be inundated. He trusted that any measure which might be introduced into
their lordships' House for effecting a change in the law would meet with the same
fate as its predecessors."
Whereupon, on the other hand,
"Lord Wodihouse presented a petition from 428 women of Aylesbury and 145
women of Cheltenham, in favour of the legalisation of marriage with a deceased
wife's sister. He was confident that the majority of the women in the country
were anxious that the law should be altered, and he trusted that any measure
which would be introduced for that purpose would be carried."
The ladies of Aylesbury appear to be as completely at variance
touching the Rights of Women in one particular, as their respective
champions, Lobds Dungannon and Wodeiiouse are about those of
men in the corresponding respect. The ladies, on the one side, demand
the right of being allowed to marry their deceased sisters' husbands.
Those on the other demand the right of continuing not to be allowed
to marry the husbands of their deceased sisters. In like manner the
lords are divided as to the Rights of Men; one noble lord requiring
for them the right to marry a deceased wife's sister, the other the
right of being kept under restraint from doing any such thing. It may
almost be imagined that two parties of divines, who differ as to a point
of Christian morality, have been severally illustrating that edifying fact
by getting up an agitation in Aylesbury amongst the ladies on the
subject of their dissension, and have so far, happily, succeeded as to
divide them into two sects represented, respectively, by Lord Dun-
gannon and Earl Wodehouse.
Does it not occur to Lord Dungannon and the ladies whose cause
he espouses, that the marriage of a lady with her deceased sister's
husband, and that of a widower with his deceased wife's sister are not
ceremonies which it is proposed to make obligatory on widowers and
surviving sisters P The noble lord and his clients have the right of
refusing to contract such marriages if they please: cannot they be
content with that, and with minding their own business P

three views of a fine lady, in the elegant and simple costume of the period, exhibiting the
use and application of an invention named "L'Impdratrice," by reason that it is said to be
worn by the Empress op the Erench, otherwise and in the vulgar tongue called a Dress-
Holder. It has the appearance of a small rake—the handle of which is held, or hooks on
to the waist: the teeth, or whatever answers their purpose, being hitched in the skirts.
Next to making dresses of a convenient length, this is perhaps the most commodious
contrivance for keeping them up out of the dirt.
If, however, appearance were consulted without regard to a lit tie additional expense, the
office of the Dress-Holder might be more splendidly accomplished by means of a small winch
or windlass attached to a girdle or waist-ribbon, and carrying a silk line with a weight and
a hook at the end of it, by means whereof the dress might be hoisted up or let down at

that—
"The duty of apples was one of considerable import-

However, to Members who partake of Mr.
Bentinck's crabbed factiousness, we should
have thought that the duty of throwing apples
of discord, whenever their party fancied they
could gain anything by the move, was a much
more important one. To Mr. Disraeli, for
instance, we should think that such a duty
would be as dear as the apple of his eye.

brought before the Lords the case of the
Monday. Lord Brougitam, always true to his humane instincts,
_rought before the Lords the case of the young children employed in
Bleach Works. It is a cruel one. Infants of seven and eight years
j . t J...
old are at work for eighteen hours, and are sometimes four nights
without sleep. The brutalities by which the poor little children are
kept sufficiently awake for the purposes of their task-masters are
shocking. Years ago, when the cruelties of the climhingboy trade
were exposed in the Lord?, a noble lord told a good story, made their
lordships laugh, and by getting the Bill thrown over for a year, left a
new batch of children to the mercies of the Sweep. There was nothing
of this kind to night, and Loud Granville promised information. He
will be good enough to remember that Lord Brougham has tendered
information, which proves that our friend Mammon is, as usual, doing
the work of Moloch.
Three Hundred Aylesbury women petitioned against the Wife's

The Lion-hearted King is to be set up in Trafalgar Square as soon

latier's turn to be served.
The Commons got upon the Budget, and the Wine was passed.
Some of the Members made wry faces. Mr. Milnes kindly trjing to
give what may be called a "baekhander" to those who have already
bottles in their bunds, failed in his generous endeavour for the Vinum
penerosnm. There was a great dispute as to how wine was to be
tested, and the only wonder was, that. Mr. Newdkgate did not lake
the opportunity of pleasing Exeter Hall by moving, that for the pur-
pose of testing the Body in wine, we should restore the Test and
Corporation Acts.
Tuesday. Lord Clanhtcarde thinks the Irish Police much too
handsome and soldierly to be good Constables. This is matter of
opinion. But when his Lordship tried to strengthen his case by
stating that crime had increased in Ireland, it was civilly explained to
him by the Duke or Somerset that he was stating what was ridicu-
lously untrue, as the Irish were breaking themselves very rapidly and
meritoriously of the habit of murder, and were contenting themselves
with assaults, batteries, and other milder amusements.
Mr, Pope Hennessy, M.P., who had been ordered to serve on a
Railway Committee, bolted to Ireland, at the orders of the Priests, to
assist in the opposition to the election of the new Irish Attorney-
General, in every respect an excellent Catholic gentleman, but who is
hateful to the Ultramontanists, because he belongs to a Cabinet that is
hateful to the Pope. So the Priests of Cork county set up a helpless
Lord called Campden, and have been working like mad to get him in.
Mr. Hennessy was commanded off to help, and what could he do P
His absence from the Railway Committee cost "the parties" £400;
but what of that, when Father O'Horsewhip is bellowing for a
spachemaker? We are sorry for the parties, but not that the Priests'
Tool Sjslem should be exposed. This is a natural place to note that
the Papists were extraordinarily well thrashed by the Catholics, aided
by the Protestants, and that Mr. Deasy beat the silly Lord by a very
large majority. Archbishop Whateley sends Mr. I'unch this:—
"Wo know nought of Pope Hexnemy's

Sir Robert Peel has been making desperate efforts to efface the
memory of his mountebank speech agaiust the Volunteers, and has

Switzerland for four years. To-night he made one of these speeches, in
support of Mr. Kingi.akk, and in protest against the views of Louis
Nathleon. Lord John made a mjstifiing kind of answer, knowing
quite well that in forty-eight, hours t he Emperor was going to declare in
his Speech to the Chambers that he meant lo have the Slope of the Alps.

for the first lime, one half opened, in honour of the event of the
evening, the Reform Bill. Precisely at five minutes before five, Lord
John Russell advanced to the tabic, was cheered, and sang as
follows:—
THE NICE LITTLE BILL.
Mr. Denison, Sir, I'm oblceged by those cheers,
And 1 beg that the House will accord me its ears,
While 1 try to set out to the best, of my skill,
The Reforms I propose by my Nice Little Bill.
A new constitution's not what I design,
I consider the old one remarkably line,
Nor could I its place advantageously fill
By aught I might give in my Nice Little Bill.
I do not admit that a failure I view,
In the Bill which 1 passed in the year XXXII.
Ah contraire, 'tis because it succeeded, 1 will
Amend its few faults by my Nice Little Bill.
That the Nation is rich and is happy, are facts—
No need in these days for Loan Castleheagii's Acts:
We're conservative, loyal, progressive, and nil
Is wauled on earth but my Nice Little Bill.
Well, now for the franchise—some folks say francheeze,—
And lirst to the Counties we'll go, if you please:
All pledges to them 1 iulend to fulfil
By a £10 francheeze, in my Nice Little Bill.
Occupation shall give it,—but then understand.
Though we don't value dwellings when coupled with land,
Ou houses not dwellings—for instance, a noil—
There's demanded £5 by my Nice Little Bill.
I'd interpolate here a legitimate word:
I hold I hat the doctrine's immensely absurd,
That because agitation is absent, 'tis ill
To concede the Reforms of my Nice Little Bill.
I propose, my dear Sir, to repudiate, quite,
Each franchise termed " fancy" (your joke, Mr. Bright; {
No doubt they have recommendations, but still
I shall leave them all out of my Nice Little Bill.

For rotes in the boroughs, I mean, Sir, to fix
The pounds in the rent at the figure of 6;
Thus two hundred thousand one twist of my quill
To the Register adds, by my Nice Little BUI.
That addition increases one-third, or about,
The roll of Electors at preseut drawn out;
I trust I don't offer too bitter a pill
To Conservative friends by my Nice Little Bill.
As regards, Sir, the Working Class, surely the best
"Will be put on the list by the rate I suggest,
And I think they've a right to remonstrate, until
They 're admitted to vote by my Nice Little Bill.
Then, as for disfranchisements, so much, you know,
Was done by my Bill twenty-nine years ago,
That there's no extinct borough, mound, ruin, or hill,
To be scheduled in A, by my Nice Little Bill.
But we must preserve Boroughs—I think with you, Ben,
Small places are famed for electing great men;
Look at Burke, and Macaulay. I'm blessed if I '11 kill
One nice little burgh by my Nice Little Bill.
Besides, if I tried it, they'd kick up a row,
And parties are balanced so nicely just now,
That a junction of Tories and grumblers would spill
The Palmerston drag, and my Nice Little Bill.
But for less than 7000 inhabitants, two

So we 'II take away one, where there are not sept mille
In the census return, by my Nice Little Bill.
Sing Marlborough, Thetford, and Harwich so base,
Sing Totness, and Honiton, famous for lace;
Sing Evesham, Wells, Tewkesbury (there don't they swill P)
All lose an M.P. by my Nice Little Bill.
So Lymington, Leominster, and Ludlow I sell,
And Knaresborough, known by its strange Dropping Well—
And Andover, Maldon, and Richmond so chill,
(Not the one where I live) by my Nice Little Bill.
And so fares Devizes, Sir, where, by the bye,
Old women fall dead when they utter a lie.
And Cirencester, Ripon, and Bodmin we'll grill
On the same pan of coals, by my Nice Little Bill.
With Hertford and Huntingdon (bold Robin Hood),
And Marlow, where fishing s uncommonly good,
And DoiChester, Chippenham, and Guildford must drill
In the corps I create by my Nice Little Bill.
Here are Twenty.Five seats, you perceive I have got:
Fifteen to big Counties I mean to allot,
And on cities that spread like great turbots or brill,
Four seats I confer by my Nice Little BUI.
Then Birkenhead, Staleybridge, Burnley, I name:
One Member each place may undoubtedly claim;
Let Cbelsea-cum-Kensington stick out its frill,
I bestow on it Two, by my nice Little BUI.
Both Oxford and Cambridge will cheer what I do
In giving one seat to our own London TJ.
They are fountains of learning, but Gower Street 'a a rill
Should be honoured, and shall, by my Nice Little BUI.
That's all, Mr. Denisox—no, I should say
The Poor-Rate, alone, every voter must pay;
No need for the taxes to open his till,
Before giving his vote by my Nice Little BUI.
My measure is simple, but hear my belief;
A plan more ornate might come headlong to grief—
So fell Master Jackt, preceding Miss Jill,
I want no such fate for my Nice Little Bill.
The words of Mercury were not particularly harsh after the song of
Apollo, but Viscount Williams,—calling attention to the fact that the
Metropolitan constituencies returned such first class men, such won-
ders of the world, as himself, Cox, late of Finsbury, and others,—com-
plained grievously that more Members were not given to the Metro-
polis, that there might be a few more such shining lights stuck in the
political firmament. Mr. TOM Dun combe, of course, said a smart thing
or two against the BUI; and the House, with a unanimous yawn, said,
"O, law, yes, bring it in if you like." Irish and Scotch Reform Bills
were then brought in—they are very much like the English one, but
the only point on which Mr. Punch cares to praise either, is a clause in
the Hibernian Act, for allowing Irish Peers to represent Irish con-
stituencies. It is an English grievance that Lord Galway, Lord
Fekmot, and Lord Palmerston, are considered good enough to be
English Members, but cannot be elected for places in the province.
Besides, the opening the Irish hustings to these peers may^nduce the
occasional selection of men of a better class than the Pope's Brass
Band.
Friday. To-day, of course, Lord John Russell had to refer to the
Emperor's speech, and to express his own opinion that there was
really a good deal to be said for the proposed Annexation, hut that he
had no doubt that Electus would do everything in an orderly and
diplomatic manner. Mr. Bright came out with a declaration that
Savoy wished to be annexed to France, because the value of Savoyard
land and produce would be immensely increased; and he hinted that if
English territorial landed proprietors had a similar chance, he would
not give much for their loyalty to their Queen. This not unnaturally
brougtit up Lord John Manners, in a rage, and be protested on
behalf of the Dukery that English noblemen and gentlemen had no
such mean notions.
More Budget. Sir Joseph Paxton contended, with much vigour
and ability, for the claims of the SUkmakers, but the Juggernaut Car
went over their necks.
The nation will be permitted by Lord Palmerston to do something
for the gallant Sir L. M'Clintock, and the noble fellows who went
with him to the Sea of Ice. Finally, the world will be excited to hear
that three Election Committees arrived this week at decisions. This
was the report:—
"Young Lawson, and Bra Jakes R. Graham,

PARLIAMENTARY PATENT MEDICINE.
Db, John Russell, Registered M.P., P.C., and Graduate of the
University of Edinburgh, original co-patentee of that celebrated
Remedy, Grey and Co.'s Specific, begs to introduce and recommend
to the patronage of the British Parliament and Public, his wonderful,
universal, and infallible Medicine, the new
PURIFYING REFORM PILL,
the discovery and composition of which have been the fruit ot more
than forty years'experience. The virtues of this excellent preparation
are tonic, stimulant, deobstruent, and slightly emunclory, constituting,
in their totality,
A MILD CONSTITUTIONAL ALTERATIVE
calculated to repair and invigorate, whilst it exonerates, without
depressing, the s>ystem. The ingredients of this invaluable panacea
have been carefully selected from the safest, most certain, and oldest
established articles of the Materia Medico, exclusive of all fanciful
new-fangled introductions of the Modern School. Its remedial ope-
ration is gentle and insensible; unattended by those violent convul-
sions, and dreadful shocks of the constitution which would be the
inevitable effect of the extreme and desperate measures recommended
by some impiudent or inexperienced Practitioners. _ Effectual as
agreeable in its action, this Pill must not be considered inert, as it has
been untruly represented to be by ignorant or interested Parties. The
freedom of its agency from the least possible inconvenience, results
from the innocuous nature of its components: in consequence of which
its use involves no confinement, or change of diet and regimen. Dr.
Russell earnestly cautions all who value their health, not to allow
themselves to be deluded by the artifices of those Unprincipled Quacks
and Pretenders over the way, who insert their puffing advertisements
and paragraphs in ceitain papers subservient to their base designs, and
whose Nostrums, if the Public could be duped into taking those per-
nicious compounds, would undermine and destroy that Constitution
of which they are impudently and insidiously represented as Conserva-
tive ; an epithet which is exclusively applicable to the New Purifying
Reform Pill, discovered and composed by Dr. John Russell.
.Observe the Label marked Palmerston, Russell and Co.; and
also the Government Stamp, to counterfeit which is foolery. Drs.
P. R. & Co. may be consulted as heretofore, at Downing Street, on
the usual Terms.
Progress of Artillery.
We understand that, when a trial of the Whitworth 80-pounder can
be had under sufficiently favourable circumstances, that piece of

BITTER BEER AND SOUR WINE.
In an article on the vinous element of the Treaty with France, our
titempoiary the Morning Post, makes the following remarks with
raiMwta t0 bitter beer:—
"None of the English brewers ot Paris—and we need scarcely ear none of the
native brewers—have hitherto succeeded in producing anything faintly resem-
bling this excellent bovcrage, and we look forward, and not distantly, to the day
when 'Bass' and 1 Alsopp' will be much more extensively consumed in Paris aud
the beer-drinking departments of Prance than any native beverage. These depart-
ments chiefly are the Seine, Aisne, Nord, Pas do Calais, and Somme. We need not
say, that every one of these departments may be reached by water communication."
It is very possible that none of the English brewers of Paris, and
very likely that none of the native French brewers, have succeeded in
producing anything faintly resembling bitter beer. The former would
be obliged, and the latter would be naturally disposed, to endeavour
to make t heir beer by brewing. This is not the way to produce bitter
ale, such bitter ale as is commonlv retailed. No doubt M. le Pharmacien
would encounter none of the difficulty in preparing the so-called fluid
which Mesirs. les Brasseurs experience in attempting to brew it. The
French apothecaries are not less skilful than our own, and any
respectable British chemist and druggist, could, out of his materia
medica, easily compose a draught possessing the bitterness, the smell,
and the stupefactive power, which constitute the sole recommendations
of that beverage. Ot course there is no disputing about tastes; every
man to his quassia, or gentian, or chamomile, wlio prefers physic to
malt liquor; but a mash-tub is not the proper vessel to mix medicines
in; nor are the combinations of pharmacy to be obtained by the
process of fermentation.
A bitter infusion, which will keep, is preferred by most people, and
by all publicans, to beer that very soon turns sour and nasty. Few
publicans and beer-sellers keep any other than that bad sort of beer, if
they keep any beer at all; but not a few keep only the bitter infusion
which usurps its place and name. Hence at many hotels there is
nothing else to be bad. Any port in a storm; any port also rather
than no wine; any apology for beer rather than no beer whatever.
Tiltk>.. — >'
Bitter beer is the consumer's only resource, and therefore it is popular.
Stingo is almost obsolete: good swipes are to be had nowhere.
Hobson's choice is called universal suffrage.
If the French will take our bitter beer, and give us their sour wine
in return, the exchange will certainly be no robbery to us. The
Budget will doubtless benefit us there. Good ale will have to be
brewed once again, to compete with claret, which is at least better than
the common run of ale. If our neighbours are equally satisfied with
their bargain, well and good; but if those departments of France
which, as the Post says, may be reached by water communication,
themselves, ».>u ■■■■ g,- Hwawn wnu uuuuuwg tue money ova very

make the tax as agreeable as possible. I would propose—you know what
women, especially mothers, are—to strike a tiny sifver coin, of no value,
but bearing a playful inscription, to be given to the child by the
Collectors, as a receipt for the Tax. Mothers would be proud to put
a bit of blue or red ribbon through it, and tie it round the ridiculous
layer of fat called a baby's neck. It would be a certificate of the
respectability of the parents. An Uncertificated Baby should be
treated as an Uncertificated Bankrupt.
"Baby should pay the tax for one year only. If a new baby came
to town before the expiration of that year, 1 would, I think, allow a
drawback.
"I also suggest that something might be done in the Licensing way.
I myself hate to see single girls carrying about babies, and being fond
of them. But if this foolish amusement is to be permitted, why not
make it profitable to the State? As a licence was necessary to a man
before he might carry a gun, make it necessary to a girl before she may
carry a baby. At five shillings a year you would collect a great deal
out of the baby-fancying girls of England.
"The Baby-fax would not fall, as too many imposts do, unjustly on
the poor, because the poor have no right to have any children at all.
Indeed 1 am not certain that anybody has that right, but here you
may not concur with me, and I am not anxious for discussion for the
reason hinted at in my first paragraph.

Desert and Deserters.
Sir William Napier never was an advocate for brutal punishments.
Talking of deserters, and the cruel way in which they are "lettered"

BEGINNING TO "TAKE NOTICE.'
Bubbles devoutly withes that he had Taken Notice a little earlier.
SOMETHING POWERFUL IN THE CHURCH.
Here is another elegant extract from the American Press:—
t
"The New York Correspondent of the Philadelphia' Prat says—' Religion and auctioneering
were actively combined at the annual reuting of pews In the Rev. Hknkv Ward Beecukr's
Church at Brooklyn. Twothousaud persona wero present. After a speech by Mr. Beecuer, the
auctioneer aasumed the hammer, and in two hours knocked down ncaWy all the ptvt and chain
in the church. The highest premium paid for a pew was 160 dollars, and the lowest twenty-five
cents.
That Yankee auctioneer must beat all the auctioneers in the world. No oilier
Hercules of the rostrum would have the strength to stand up against him. He
would knock down the Crystal Palace at. a single blow of the hammer, if he had a
chance. It is too bad, however, that he should make a display of his prowess
inside a church. He must belong to that new sect, so popular at present amongst
ihysical-force novelists, called "muscular Christianity." His muscular power will
* "knocking down" the church itself next. He may be a descendant of the great
John Knox himself, for what we know to (he contrary. However, he might
beneficially employ his mighty hand in knocking down church-rates; or if he could
succeed in removing a few of the divisions that interrupt the progress of the
service at St. George's in the East, we should look upon him as being as strong
a man as any connected with the Church; fur the man who knocks down pews
and chairs so easily, would not take long in clearing out the congregation also,
supposing it happened to be unruly. In fact, this auctioneer is a great Abolitionist
in his way. Many Dissenters have been striving in vain for years to get rid of the
pew system, and here is a "muscular Christian," who knocks them all down in a
minute. We see from the above quotation of prices, that the lowest sum given
was "twenty-five cents." We must say that, in the words of the Italian song,
it was " No* tanlipiu"—not much for a Pew.

The Witlers, it appears, are rather savage with Lord
Pai.mekston tor having backed up Mr. Gladstone in his
onslaught on their beer-barrels j for they consider (though
we don't) the introduclion-of French wines will lessen the
consumption of English malt aud hops. They seem to
fancy that by giving this new drink to the public his
Lordship's government must do a damage to the publics,
siuce no one in his senses will put up with doctored beer
when he can slake his thirst witti what is pure and whole-
some drink. 1 n this view of the case we thoroughly agree:
but when the Witlers call his lordship an "injudicious
bottle-holder," the stress they lay on the first syllable
makes us feel inclined to slightly vary the orthography,
and say his Lordship has in this matter been quite au Inn-
judicious one.

CHAPTER VI.-
THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD—(Concluded).
S Lords of the Creation,
politeness of course tells
us we must not forget
the ladies: and having
thoroughly described the
mail armour of the period,
we have now the pleasing
labour of picturing the
female. When we say this,
we however do not mean it
to be thought that the
Anglo-Saxon women were
really clothed in armour:
for crinoline was not in use
in that blest age, and the
softer sex were not env-
ironed with hard steel, as in
our own more savage time,
they have been driven to
defend themselves. But
clothing may be fairly viewed
as armour against weather,
and when a woman puts it
on it may be said to (w)arm
her. Besides, we wished to
make a play upon the two
words " mail" and " female,"
and we are not to be pre-
vented from making a bad pun by any paltry doubt about the fitness
of a synonym, which we may find it needful for the joke's sake to
bring forward.

Without, however, condescending to this careful explanation, we
might have not unfitly used the word we did; for one of the chief
articles of Saxon ladies' dress was a garment which was called in their
uncouth tongue a gunna; a term which certainly to our ears smacks
much less of millinery than it seems to do of armoury. Antiquarians
have made a lot of shots about this gunna, and as they cannot make
their minds up as to what it really was, they have long kept up a fire
of critical remarks on it. There are some who like to liken it to the
Romau-Rritish gum, a word which, if spelt properly, would obviously be
gown. This garment Varro speaks of by its Latin name gaunacum,
and describes as a short tunic reaching half-way down the thigh, and
furnished with loose sleeves extending only to the elbow. It is pre-
sumable, however, that no decent Anglo-Saxoness would have ever
dreamt of dressing in so scanty an apparel: and we incline therefore
to think, with other eminent authorities, that the gunna was along robe
reaching to the feet, which iudeed in the old drawings it frequently
conceals. Still, that short gunnas were worn, there is extant good
episcopal evidence to prove: for in searching the old chronicles we find
a copy of a letter from a Saxon Bishop of Winchester, who gives some
one "a short gunna made in our manner." Who this Some one could
have been we dare not stop now to conjecture, nor can we at present
spare the space for guessing whether bishops then employed their
leisure time in needlework, as the phrase made in our manner"
might lead one to suppose.
From the conflict of opinions expressed upon the subject, gentlemen
of the leng-robe might spend some days in arguing as to whether the
said gunna was a long robe or a short One. But the long and the short
of it is, we think, it sometimes was a long robe, and sometimes was a
short one, and we hope onr readers will be satisfiedwith this solution
of the point. Underneath the gunna, the Anglo-Saxonesscs wore a
kirtle and a tunic, whereof the latter had long sleeves like the tunics of
the men, and wrinkled up in rolls from the elbow to the wrist. From
their fitting with such tightness and closeness to the arm, these rolls
must have in temperature been hot rolls to the wearer, who, in the
summer-time, must frequently have felt herself half baked in them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [March 10, i860.
What the kirtle was, we shrink from questioning too narrowly, for in
the will of one WynfLjEda. we find that it is mentioned with "other
linen webb," and described as being white. It seems therefore not
improbable that the kirtle, though spelt differently, was in fact a sort
of shirt; but as shirts, we are aware, are never worn by women, we
guess the kirtle must have been that sort of she-shirt or che-mise,
which inquiring-minded monsters have perhaps heard called a "shift."
The mantle was a garment worn likewise at this period, and which
bore a strong resemblance to the ancient priestly chasuble, so far as
the illuminators suffer one to judge. Being fastened at the throat, it
was made so as to hang loosely down the back and down in front; and
except when looped up by the lifted arms, it covered the whole figure
like a domino or cloak.
If we venture now to handle so delicate a subject as the Saxon ladies'
leg^s, it is only for the sake of silencing a writer who darkly hints that
it is possible that they were left unclothed. This appalling fancy he
deduces from the fact, that stockings are not seen in the pictures of
the period, wherein the female figure is most carefully portrayed. But
a sufficient cause to our mind why the stockings are not seen is, that
the legs which wore them were kept purposely invisible: for the
Anglo-Saxon artists were extremely modest men, and never, it would
seem, were students of the nude, as is the case with their more modern,
and perchance less modest, brethren. For ourselves, we blush to think
that any foremothers of ours should ever have gone barelegged; and
we cannot bear to dwell upon a point so barely possible. Our own
impression is, that the Anglo-Saxon ladies not only had stockings, but
actually wore them: in which respect they would have differed from
some of their descendants; for many a Scotch lassie who likes to show
her legs, will carry in her pocket the wherewithal to cover them.
The Saxon ladies' shoes were in shape much like their lords': so far
as one can guess from the small portion of them visible. _ In the manu-
scripts they mostly are half hidden by the gunna, and it is therefore
difficult to say precisely how they looked. From their being coloured
black we may presume that they were worn so; but whether they had
heels "hath not yette come un-toe our knowledge," to quote the
words of one who was once esteemed a wit.
It is doubtful whether gloves were worn by either Saxon sex until
just before or after the close of the tenth century. As a proof of their
great rarity, we find it mentioned that five pairs of them formed a chief
part of the duty paid to Ethelred the Second, by a guild of German
merchants for protection of their trade: a fact which serves to show
that the earliest of protectionists found it rjay to bribe our Government
to go hand in glove with them. In a miniature of a lady, supposed to
have been done about the year 1001, the left hand is depicted ra a sort
of glove or muffler, having the thumb separate, but the fingers all
together. Whether the ladv was possessed of a right-hand glove as
well, and if so, why she did not wear it when she sat to nave her
portrait taken, are questions we despair of ever hearing answered. It
is possible, however, that as gloves were doubtless dear when they first
were introduced, ladies wore them singly if their pin-money ran short:
and so contrived to make a pair last them twice the time they would
have done if both were worn together.
From the hand to the head is an easy transition, except with persons
born in Cockneydom who can't pronounce their n's; so directing our
attention to the Anglo-Saxon head-d ress. we find that women of all classes
wore a piece of silk or linen wrapped ana folded over and about the head
and neck, so t hat it looked a combination of a comforter and cap. Their
name for it was leaflet, from the verb vxtfan, to coyer j but they also called
it hrfodts ragel, which means literally head-rail. As depicted in the
manuscripts, the garment looks as uncouth nearly as its name; and
from its bandage-like bemufflement gives the wearer the appearance of
having a bad head-ache, a sore throat and swelled face.
This head-gear was, however, seldom worn withindoors, for the
women, like the men, were sadly proud of their long hair, and wasted
their time terribly in combing it and curling it, and generally seeing to
its proper cultivation. Bishop Adhblm writing De Virginitate (a
queer theme for a bishop's pen, some readers may think, but it is not
long since a prelate * wrote against the polka) makes mention of a
lady in the hands of her attendants, and having her locks delicately
twisted by the frizzling tongs. But the bishop does not mention if
her hair was brown or blue, and strange as it may seem, there are
colourable grounds for thinking it may have been either. _ This we say
on the authority of mountains of MSS.. in which the hair and beard
are mostly painted blue; and hosts of learned commentators coincide
in guessing that the Saxons used some dye or powder for their hair,
which imparted to their heads the ceruleum eolorem, of which we learn
from Cesar, the old Britons were so fond. Now, as ladies often
imitate the arts of their admirers, and follow in their fashions as far as
it is practicable, we have very little doubt that the Anglo-Saxonesses
likewise liked to make themselves look frights by using hair-dye; and
that, when in love especially, they coloured their heads so as just to
match with their "adorers." Or this we partly have a proof in a
painting of the period, wherein the flowing locks of Eve are depicted
a bright blue: and further evidence is furnished by a fragment of a
* AncnnsHor Cnu.iv.
love-song, which is commonly believed to have been written by King
Vortigern, who was _inveigled into marriage with the daughter of
old Hengist. The original MS. of this is now in our possession, and
the lines in question run, or rather hobble, thus:—
"fcoforna is trig Iabgr4obr,
$tt robe itte is a gunna:
Sfjtt iurars blrinc fjairc hrr rats abobf,
© is sijtt nottt a stunna!"
Critics disagree as to the meaning of the word "stunna," but we
incline, ourselves, to think it was a bit of Saxon slang, and from the
context we imagine it was used by way of compliment. About the fact
of the "blewe haire," however, there is no mistake, albeit a Civil
Service Clerk might quarrel with the spelling. And the fact that it
was worn thus being thoroughly established, we may fancy that young
ladies of the Anglo-Saxon period spent a good deal of their leisure in
colouring their hair, more especially perhaps when they were asked to
spare a lock of it. "My Mother bids me dye my hair to a cerulean hue."
doubtless was a ditty much in vogue about this period, and match-
making Mammas no doubt insisted on their bidding being put into
effect, if they thought blue hair increased their girls capillary attrac-
tions. There were, however, some exceptions to the rule of admiration
of it, as will be seen by the perusal of a sentimental couplet, which we
presume to have been written by a poet of the period, though, who the
poet was, posterity must guess. In this couplet the blue hair is coupled
with black nails and other personal disfigurements; clearly showing
that the writer was himself no great admirer of it. The couplet is
however neat, and nicely turned, and besides confirming the fact which
we have stated, may be quoted for its polish, if not for its point:—
"goutt nost is xtVtt, gout haire is blrfa,
goutt nafirs are hlackr, gtgl E loabe grin!
2nob gif gourt $)a togl stanbe g< shint,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
N Monday, March 5, commenced a
week of East Wind and Much Ado
About Nothing, both highly irritat-
ing to Mr. Punch and all other
thin ■ skinned and right - minded
persons.
Lord Shaftesbury, eager, we
hope, to make amends for having
delivered a foolish speech in praise
and honour of Cabmen (as if they
had left off cheating women and
other helpless persons upon every
possible occasion), brought forward
the case of the females and children
engaged in Lace Factories. The
demoniacal conduct of some of the
"employers of these unfortunates,
entitles their factories to be classi-
cally called Lace-demonia, and Mr.
Punch hopes to see the Factory
Act applied to them with more than
Spartan rigour. Lord Campbell
took the second reading of a Bill
for punishing a Poisoner, as a felon,
whether you can or cannot prove
that he intended actual murder. In
addition to the advantage of this
Bill, as regards the Poisoner pur
tang, who knows but that some scoundrelly Adulterator may be hit under
its provisions f Anyhow, if it passes, Publicans and other sinners had
better look out.
At. length a victim was sacrificed to the invisible deity called Purity
of Election. Mr. Goif, returned for Roscommon, fell. As in the old
witch trials, a brief marginal note in the record ticked off the unhappy
hag, " Convicla et combusta "—so does Mr. Punch score out the evicted
from his Dod. "Out: Treating" Mr. Gofp had not, perhaps, paid
due heed to the maxim of his borough's namesake—
"Election treats admit of no defence,
For want of stinginess is want of sense."
Bags and Lampblack govern the world, and those who expend the
latter in printing on the former will be glad to hear that the French
Bag-bag is to be sent over here free from French export duties. Less
glad will everybody be to know that the Treaty does not apply to the
colonies of France, except Algeria. This is another little "pull"
which our beloved Electcs retains, but he will have to let it go.
Kino Thwaites's Palace, adjoining his contemporary Sovereign
Queen Victoria's Park, is to cost £16,CO0, besides a huge rent. This,
dear Mr. Bull, is the house in which the haughty Court of Scavengers is
to meet. Do you not think that your sewers ought to run rose-water P
Xnow too, that your King owes no allegiance to your Queen, and that
this information had to be humbly sued for by Her Majesty's Minister,
Mr. Cow i k u who took care to explain that it was given him as matter
of grace and favour by Thwaites, Rex, F. D., or Flusher of Drains.
Then came the grand Ado. In compliance with very proper forms,
Parliament must Address the Queen on the subject of any Treaty.
So Lord Palmerston proposed to vote the Commons' Address
to-night. The opponents of the Budget flared up, and insisted on
more time, and after an angry debate (in the course whereof Mr.
Roebuck pitched into the Emperor uncommonly strong about the
Slopes of the Alps, and said that he would soon be taking Rhenish
Prussia and Belgium), the Ministers had to give way, and fix Thursday
for the consideration of the Address. The Conservatives contended
that while the Budget and Treaty were designed to conciliate
Electus, he was showing how worthy he was to be conciliated by
grabbing Savoy. Well, this was at all events a fair and tangible
ground of opposition; but lo! when Thursday came (which, in cqm-
{iliance with its usual custom, it did after Wednesday), the Opposition
lad taken counsel of discretion, and it was settled that though the
subject was to be debated—and so it was, and very dully—there was
to be no real hostility to the Treaty. Thursday night was given up to
a solemn talk, and so was Friday, and the end of all was, that the
Address was voted, and it might just as well have been voted early in the
week. It is hoped that the formality will greatly comfort the various
parties who are weeping and wailing over the Budget, for as Cowfer
says:—
11 The tear that is wiped with a little Address
May be followed, perhaps, by a smilo."
Mr. Gladstone's Savings' Bank Bill was read a second time; but as
it has nothing whatever to do with the management of these Banks, or
the security of depositors, and only concerns the mode in which the
Government, when it borrows the money, is to keep accounts, and so
forth, nobody will care to know much more about it. It is as if a Bill
were demanded (which it is, and loudly) for putting down street
organists, and the legislature passed a measure for regulating the
application of the halfpence carried by the brown nuisances to their
rascal employers.
And then, hear it everybody, another attempt was made by-the
hardened Heathbreaker, Tommy Wilson, to break into Hampstead,
but those vigilant Metropolitan constables, Fermoy and Edwin James,
from information they had received, were on the watch, and collared
the offender, who had previously had seven or eight convictions
recorded against him. An attempt at rescue was made by an Irishman
called Whiteside, who was very abusive, and by a notorious Prig
called Bouverie, who appealed to the bystanders not to let Wilson
be nabbed, but the feeling of the spectators was aroused in favour of
the officers, and two to one took part with them. There is a curious
monomania about Wilson. He is descended from a baronet who dis-
tinguished himself by his gallantry in the cause of Kino Charles
the First, and he wants to balance the loss of Marston Moor by the
gain of Hampstead Heath. We may tolerate the sentiment, but
cannot indulge the sentimentalist.
Tuesday. Much satisfaction was manifested at the announcement of
Lord Chelmsford, that he rose to move the second reading of a Bill
for the Elevation of Attorneys. A great Drop, of the kind not wanted,
was perceived, when his Lordship explained that instead of the elevation
which it had been fondly hoped was intended, the attorneys were not only
to be permitted to exist, but new facilities were to be given for entrance
into the calling. A University Degree to admit after three years' service,
the usual term of five years to be four, and clerks, not articled, who
had worked for ten years might also be let in. How this scheme is to
elevate the profession. Punch knows not, unless the prospect of having
its plunder subdivided may drive it to drown its despair in bibations.
The Commons had a spirited debate on the Sale of Commissions in
the Army, in the course of which Captain Vernon, true to his
motto, Ver non semper viret, was green enough to adduce as argument
for the purchase system that the Duke of Wellington, who
purchased, beat Napoleon Bonaparte, who didn't. Sir De Lacy
Evans moved for the extinction of the system, and was supported by
Mr. Rich, who is observed to be looking much happier than during
the lifetime of Mr. Henry Drummond, whose designation of him as
"the pig that squeaked because there was no teat for him," amused
the House to excess, and is unforgotten. Sundry officers having talked
—like officers, Mr. Sidney Herbert intimated that he had a scheme
for the partial abolition of the purchase system. The General forced
a battle, and was beaten, retiring at the head of 59 men to his
enemy's 213.
Lord Raynham has introduced two meritorious Bills for the
further protection of Women, Children, and other Dumb Animals.
Wednesday. This was St. Volunteer's Day,—the levee, the banquet,
and the ball. The Commons did not do much besides smashing a Bill
for improving the mode of paying coroners. Sir G. Lewis was
facetious on the measure, and said that its seconder, Mr. Edwin
James, was guilty of infanticide, and the Bill must be "sat on,"—a
cheerful strain of humour, highly to be applauded.
Thursday. Nothing remarkable TJp-stairs, except that upon a dis-
cussion respecting private communications that had passed between
Lord John Russell and Lord Cowley on the Savoy business, the
Duke of Newcastle observed with naivete', that there had been no
desire to conceal anything from Parliament: for if there had been, he
should not have told Parliament that there had been any private corre-
spondence at all.
The Dover Election Committee declared Admiral Leeke and Mr.
Nicol duly seated. Humph. A quotation from Woodstock seems
apposite. "Thou art in a mighty merciful humour, this morning,"
said Cromwell-Punch—"not entirely satisfied."
Friday. The sapient Normanby delivered himself of another burst
of spleen against the Tuscans for having got rid of his friend the
"twice-perjured Leopold," and his attendant lot of Court parasites,
with whom old Normanby loved to exchange pinches of snuff, twaddle,
and scandal. To-night he had a special grievance, inasmuch as the
Tuscan Government nad proceeded against the husband of some lady
known in "good society here; and the shocking atrocity of causing
inconvenience to such a person, even for public purposes, was quite
revolting to the feelings of the antiquated courtier. Lord Wode-
house, in reply, shook the bran out of him and tossed him away.
Tuscany is about to decide for herself between Autonomy (ha ! ha!
Viscount,—no, it doesn't mean Automatons; but that is rather a good
shot for you) and Sardinia, and her decision is to be final.
Country cousins, and others who may be desirous of seeing the New
Houses of Parliament, had better make haste about it; for that won-
derful mixture of carbonates of lime and magnesia, of which the place
is built, and which science, after no end of investigation, declared
would outlast the world, ana even Punch, is coming to pieces as fast
as possible. Mr. Cowper admitted the fact to-night, and said that
the river front was being gummed over, or smeared over with some-
thing that might keep it together, but he could not say. The whole

place will be down shortly; and architects had better be getting their
drawing-boards and set-squares in order for the next competition.
The Home Secretary, in answer to Cardinal Wiseman's Cross-
bearer, Mr. Bowyer, referred to a case in which a Catholic priest had
been committed to prison for refusing to say where he got a stolen
watch, and pleading the Confessional. Sir George, confirmed by Sir
Fitzroy Kelly, distinctly declared that Confession communications
were not privileged by law. The Priests had better note this, and not
receive stolen goods in future, even, as this gentleman did, for the
sake of making restitution. Sam Slick then made a violent onslaught
upon Mr. Gladstone for being "sneering, and supercilious, and
taunting, and contemptuous," about the Timber Duties and the
Canadians,—charges which Mr. Gladstone denied. As Mr. Punch
writes for all time, it may be well to note, that the Chancellor of
the Exchequer does sometimes, permit the contempt which a very
able and honest man entertains for a blockhead to be more manifest
than is perfectly expedient or charitable. In closing the Treaty Debate
to-night, he introduced the remark, that an adversary's statements had
not been worthy the high standard of legislative debate he ought to
desire to attain; and that many foolish things had been said in the
discussion, adding, as &placebo, that all the same foolish things, and
many others, had been said in 1787. All which was true, but fools do
not like to be told that they are fools; and Mr. Gladstone should
remember something about suffering fools "gladly" (which means
civilly) knowing that we ourselves are wise.
The Baid Treaty Debate was resumed by Mr. Horsman. All amend-
ments having been withdrawn, Horsman setup a little one of his own,
directed against the coal article in the compact. He contended that
the Emperor and the French people were opposing interests, and that
we were pleasing the first by injuring the second. Mr. Vivian stated
to those who were afraid our Coals would be exhausted by the ex-
pected importations to France, that he would undertake to supply,
from South Wales only, all the coal we should want for the next 500
years, and that there was enough in England for the next 5000 years.
We think the Hon. Member had better enter into contract to fulfil his
promise, Mr. Punch promising posterity to keep him to it. Mr. Ben-
tinck said he would prefer a war to the Treaty, and Sir Robert Peel
supported it, but denounced the Savoy business. He ended with a
huge eulogium on Mr. Gladstone, quite deserved, and, of course,
doubly valuable on the laudari laudato principle. Mr. Disraeli then
solemnly attacked the Treaty on three heads—financial, diplomatic,
and political. What could have reminded Mr. Punch of the wonderful
prformance of the three Arab brothers, Mulbt, Ali, and Hassan P
Muley, with a lighted torch, will jump down his brother Ali's
throat. Ali, with a lighted torch, will jump down his brother
Hassan's throat, and then Hassan, with a lighted torch, and encumbered
with the weight of his two brothers, will jump down his own throat,
and suddenly leave the company in total darkness—walk up, ladies
and gentlemen!" Not that the speech was not a very clever one, but
it was a feat whereof cui bono may be said by those who understand
enough Latin for the purpose. By the way, Mr. Punch emits a pro-
phecy as easily as he eats a shrimp, and thinks nothing of such a trifle,
so he makes no fuss of having predicted three weeks back, that Mr.
Disraeli would praise the Emperor and pitch into the Ministers.
To-night he declared that the conduct of the Emperor about Savoy
had been perfectly frank from the beginning, but as for the Ministers
who had advocated an Italian policy which they knew must lead tu the
annexation, they filled him, Mr. D., with distrust. The Chancellor
op the Exchequer wound up the debate with a dashing speech,
mangled Mr. Horsman. charged some people with being ignorant
and the rest with being fools, and brought the business brilliantly to
an end. Horsman could get but 66 to 282. Post Equitem tedet atra
cura, but who the blacklooking Cure is that sits behind Horsman we
don't know, and we don't care, having introduced the quotation
only because equitem means horseman, and to show that we know
Horace.
DINNER NOTES AND QUERIES.
Announcing to the world the important piece of news that the
Duke of Wellington has asked the Prince of Orange to dine
with him, a fashionable newspaper proceeds to state the fact that—
"Her Grace tho Duchess has Invited a large circlo to meet the illustrious Prince
aftor dinner."
From this interesting but somewhat bewildering intelligence, there
arise in our mind the following few queries:—
L What was the "large circle P" Was it Astley's Circus? or one
of the paddle-wheels of the Great Eastern Steamship P
2. Why was the "large circle" not asked to come to dinner P Was
there not room for it at table? or was it considered that the
"illustrious Prince" was only worth meeting after pudding, not
before it P
3. Why cannot our noblemen invite their private friends to dine
with them without our newsmen drawing public notice to the fact P
THE POLITICAL EVIL.
An interesting movement is now proceeding in most of our principal
boroughs with a view to the suppression, if possible, of that system of
bribery and corruption which has been denominated the Great Political
EviL The Town Hall is, by permission of the Mayor, opened on
certain evenings to the degraded portion of the constituency, invited
by the zealous pastors and other philanthropists who have devoted
themselves to the good work, to attend and partake of beer and pipes;
it being felt that persons of that class would be insensible to the
attractions of tea and muffins. Cards of invitation are left at all the
low public-houses. The corrupt voters are received at the place of
meeting by the benevolent preachers and ministers who are endeavour-
ing to reclaim the sold, and who, in the character of missionaries,
appear appropriately attired in reverend black, with white ties. These
messengers of purity address the multitude of depraved beings who
have bartered their privileges as Britons for a few shillings and a quan-
tity of ale, as creatures who, however deeply sunken in infamy, may,
nevertheless, still emerge, and by genuine amendment retrieve their
lost character. They also take individual voters apart, and talk
with each beery and brandy-and-watery sot, reason and remonstrate
with him, and endeavour to point out the iniquity of his path, awaken
his almost extinct sense of shame, and beat some notion of responsi-
bility into his head. Some few manifest signs of emotion, scratch
their heads, and mutter resolutions of amendment; and one or two
occasionally clasp the hand of their instructor, and, with a voice
tremulous and eyes suffused with drink, declare that they will vote the
next time according to their consciences, confirming the promise gene-
rally with an imprecation. The majority, however, listen to what is
saia to them with stolid indifference, sit smoking ana swigging, and at
the conclusion of the proceedings withdraw winking and grinning,
rather the worse for the liquor which they have had, and nothing at all
the better for the exhortations which have been addressed to them.

their efficiency would be improved by the addition of haberdashers.

CHAPTER VII.—THE ANGLO-DANISH PERIOD.
he Costnme of the Danes,
who for a short period were
settlers in England, and
may therefore fairly claim
the honour of our notice,
was more nautical in fashion
than the costume of the
Saxons, over whom they
briefly triumphed, and
ousted from the throne.
This we say without much
citable authority to prove
it, for the old illuminations
throw but dim light on the
subject, and the writers
whom they illustrated keep
profoundly dark on it. It
must be borne in mind,
however, that the Danes
were mostly sailors,whereas
the Saxons, there is reason
to believe, were chiefly
soldiers: and this would in
itself be a sufficient ground
for guessing that their
dresses were dissimilar, had
we not a whit of better
evidence to back us. Jack

themselves in tight stocks
and jack boots, nor is it likely that the Danes were dressed like
soldiers when at sea, for we question if a crew could work a ship well

in mail armour. Still less can we conceive of sailors dancing horn-
pipes, if attired in heavy military fashion, like the Saxons; and that
the Danes danced hornpipes nobody can doubt, after seeing a most
singular MS. in our possession, in which a Danish sailor is depicted in
the act.*
Not content, however, with thus guessing at the truth, we have
exercised that industry which always has distinguished us; and not-
withstanding our engagements at rifle balls and banquets, and other
terrible time-slaughterings into which, to serve our country, we have
recently been dragged, we have managed to consult vast numbers of
authorities on the interesting subject of the dresses of the Danes: on
which, next to our own uniform, our thoughts just now are chiefly
bent. We need not occupy our space by detailing with preciseness all
the volumes we have read, or t he still greater quantity which we have
vainly tried to read. Nor need we excite the envy of the reader by de-
scribing our now recognised importance in Great llusseli Street; where
no sooner are we seen than the courteous sub-librarians rush instantly
to smother us directly we sit down, with the dustiest and fustiest and
mustiest old manuscripts, which awaiting our arrival they have kindly
hunted up for us. Without indulging, like some writers, in such page-
filling discursiveness, it is enough for us to state that Mr. Arnold, of
Lubeck, distinctly backs us in asserting that the Danes were much
more sador-like in costume than the Saxons. According to his testimony
they "wore the garments of sea-farers, befitting men who lived by
piracy and inhabited the sea:" a phrase which almost might incline
one to picture them as Mermen, or else "inhabiting the sea," all sea-
renely like the divers, in a goggle-eyed brass helmet and waterproof
great coat.
It would appear from the Welsh chronicles (which we don't pretend
ourselves to have deciphered, and still less are ambitious of attempting
to pronounce) that the colour of the ancient Danish dress was mostly
black. Caradoc, of Llancarvan, often calls them "the black Danes,"
* From the words "Ouro Saylorro Prince " being writ beneath thia figure, it has
by some been thought a portrait of no less renowned a personage than Hamlet,
I'rince of Denmark/ In support of thiB assumption, we have Shakspearr's evidence
that Hamlet went to pea; but whether ho diiucid hornpipes is a matter which wo
leave the critics to dispute.

at least so we find the phrase translated for our benefit, for the words
in the original are too jaw-cracking to quote. He also gives their army
the title of "the black army," and without intending insult calls their
guards "the black guards." Why they wore the colour, is a question
which the reader may put to us if he pleases, but we regret that he
will have to whistle for an answer to it. As their standard was a
raven, perhaps they plumed themselves on being "of a feather" with
that bird, for in piracy and plunder the Danes were truly raven-ous.
However, we at least may undertake to say that the colour had no
meaning in the eyes of undertakers. *' Strabo of the Baltic" (of course
every baby knows we mean Adam of Bremen) distinctly mentions
that the Danes never mourned the loss of even their dearest kinsmen,
and let their richest uncles die without making the least change in
their demeanour or their dress.* Black had therefore no connection

with mourning in their eyes, though there is some proof that their
forefathers regarded it with sadness. The Danes, it is acknowledged,
were of Scythic extraction; and Herodotus makes note of a nation
near to Scythia, whom, as they always dressed in black, he names
the "Melanchloenians, a word which very obviously is meant for
"Melancholy 'uns."
That fashions are, however, liable to change, is a truth which few
debaters would venture to dispute. Accordingly we find that though
the Pagan Danes were dressed in "raymentte blacke as.nightte," yet
when Christianised they "cast their 'nighted colour off," and their
sons outshone the Saxons in their gorgeous ar-ray. One writer tells
us they came out in scarlet, purple, and fine linen: while another
somewhat sneers at them for wearing dresses which he calls "effemi-
nately gave." As a proof of their effeminacy, John Wallingford
remarks that they "didde often change their cloathes:" and to show
their marked devotion to the duties of the toilette, he mentions that
they actually "didde combe their hayre once in y" daie," and were
"soe exceeding cleanlye in their habbits y' they didde even washe them-
selves as moche as once a weekke!" By these means he observes they
pleased the eyes of the women, and behaved as gay Lotharios to the
wives of the nobility, and thus found work for the Sir Cresswell
Cresswell of the time. ^ t
Some notion of the fineness of their garments may be formed from a
picture of Canute as he appeared on Ilamsgate sands, on the memo-
rable occasion when he rebuked his courtiers. From this and the
court journalist's description of his dress, t we may see that Kino

Dtnmark has invariably been dressed in a black suit; whence tho coarse-minded
have jested about his being tho Prince of Darkness, and the ignorant have fancied
that he must be the Black Prince. It seems clear that HamUt't sables should be
viewed as being donned not in mourning for his fathor,' but simply as the usual
clothing of his father's son.

Canute was a "heavy ocean swell," as being by birth a pirate, we
may not unfitly call him. His courtiers too were clearly swells of the;
first water; though from the way they hold their clothes up in the
picture we refer to, one might think that on dry land they felt far more
in their element.
However dingily and dowdily they dressed, then, while at home, the
Danes clearly came out gorgeously when they were out visiting; and
while staying with the Saxons they inclined to Saxon pomps and vani-
ties of dress. It may be guessed how rich and rare were the gems
their nobles wore, when we mention that the rank and fashion of the
period, male as well as female, were bedecked with golden bracelets;
which, to show they could afford it, were invariably buried with them.
By the Pagan Danes the bracelet was esteemed a sacred ornament, and
one was kept upon their altar or worn by their high priests, to serve
as the cement for their most binding adjurations. Their ordinary oaths
were "by the edge of my sword!" or, by the shoulder of my horse!"
But, when they wished to be believed, they swore "by the Holy Brace-
let!" which doubtless was as binding as our "by the Holy Poker!"
Whether or no the Danes, like the Saxons, wore blue hair, we can
no more say than whether their eyes were green, or whether, as a rule,
they were distinguished for red noses. One swallow, it is well-
known, does not make a summer; neither does one statement suffice
to prove a fact. Else were it enough to show the greenness of tbeir
eyes, if we cited the first stanza of an ancient Saxon love-song, which
begins—
"fSg prtttge Qanr, mg oearrst Sanr,
Sh oinna loolu soe sftgt!
33uttt mtetu nut in g* ttornningt,

For the blueness of their hair, however, we have not such proof as this
even to quote: and we incline to think their hair was rather nut-
colour than blue, inasmuch as it is clear that they were evidently nuts
on it. Toelsus tells us of a gentleman, one Mr. Harold Harpagre,
otherwise called Fairlocks: whose hair flowed down his back in
ringlets to his girdle, and who made avow by-moonlight to his mistress,
to neglect his crop of curls and not manure them with Macassar until
he had completely conquered Norway for her sake. Moreover, we are
told that a young warrior, going to be beheaded, axed the axeman to
be good enough to keep his hair unstained, and not to let a slave pro-
fane it with nis touch. This we state upon the evidence of Joms-
wikinga Saga, a name which sounds so formidable that we must
put faith in it.

THE POPE SITTING ON THORNS.
An Irish writer, with a natural confusedness of metaphor, observes
that "the Pope's chair is not a bed of roses." Now, although this
observation is not strictly accurate, it is in some degree appropriate,
and has a certain smack of truth. If the Pope is not on roses, he is
certainly on thorns, and roses bear to thorns the closest of connection.
The Pope's chair is supported by the bayonets of the French, and
bayonets to thorns have points clearly of resemblance, as anybody will
find who happens to sit down on them* So, in saying that the Pope's
chair is not a bed of roses, the writer makes fit use of a flowery expres-
sion, and delicately hints that the Pope now sits on thorns.
Fatalists pretend that they can look into futurity: and, doubtless,
the French Emperor has amused himself with sketching out the des-
tiny of the Pope. We, who make pretence of no such power of fore-
sight, would, however, dare to venture what would be the Pope's
position, were the thorns—that is, the bayonets—removed from him
behind. Take away his props, and his Infallibility infallibly must fall,
and come to grief infallibly in coming to the ground. Perhaps his
Humpty-Dumptiness will take some thought of this, before he thinks
of trying to dispense with his French props. Quieta Hon movere is
clearly the best maxim for sitters upon thorns, for the more they try to
move the more painfully they feel it. If the Pope be a philosopher, he
knows "what must be, mustand musty as the saying is, he had
better make the best of it. To quarrel with the thorns won't bring
him to the roses, and so we recommend him not to make a trial of it.
Sitting upon thorns is not the plcasantest position, but the Pope must
do his Dest to $rin benignantly and bear it, for it will surely not relieve
him much to kick against the pricks.
Mr. John Bull acknowledges the first half of Westminster Bridge,
but begs to state that the second half has not yet come to hand. This
statement is made in the hope that Mr. Cowpeb, or Mb. Page, will
look to it at their earliest convenience.

THE DUDLEY MYSTERY.
Punch is very much vexed—nay, displeased—with the gentlemen
who report for the Birmingham Daily Post and the Wolverhampton
Chronicle, and, with his usual frankness, he begs to signify the same to
them. In a similar spirit, and in conformity with his constitutional
principles, he at once makes known to them the nature of their
offence.
There was a curious personage known about town as Lord Ward, a
descendant of one Humble Ward, who was made a Lord for marrying
a titled lady. Lately, this Lord Ward has been made Earl of
Dudley; and the Times says that the reason was, that he saved Kidder-
minster to the Ministers at the last Election. Mr. Dod, in his
Electoral Facts, speaking of Kidderminster, says, "Lord Ward has
some of the old influence of the Foleys of Whitley Court "—meaning,
influence upon an election; but inasmuch as Peers are forbidden by
the Constitution to interfere in Elections, and as Peers never do any-
thing wrong,—and, if they did, the Queen's Ministers would surely
not reward them for so doing,—Mr. Punch thinks the Times must have
fallen into error. This error is excusable only because the Times was,
doubtless, unable to discover in the relatives or antecedents of Lord
Ward,—in his wisdom, eloquence, or political importance,—the
slightest other reason for making him an Earl, while such a man as
Henry Brougham, for instance, is only a Baron. Mr. Punch never
touches on matters not legitimately before the public; and all he
knows of Lord Ward is derived from paragraphs in the papers, which
show that he has plenty of money; that he lent a lot to Mr. Lumley
to keep up the Opera, and sued him for some of it; and that he cannot
make a speech without talking very foolishly. But the Liberals have
made him an Earl. Now, gentlemen-reporters.
Mr. Punch reads this paragraph in divers mid-land county papers:—
"On Tuesday woek, the now Earl of Di.'DLkt was entertained at a banquet got
up by a committee of Dudley tradesmen, in celebration of His Lordship's recent
elevation to the earldom. Lord Ward, and other nobles, were invited guests. The
committee decided tl at one reporter should have his dinner doum-stairt, and be
admitted to tho room when the speeches commenced! But afterwards it was inti-
mated that tho accommodation should extend to six. Some gentlemen of tho
Press arrived. They represented tho Birmingham Daily Post and the Wolverhamp-
ton Chronicle, and indignantly protested against such an insult, ordered their own
dinners at tho hotel, and were quietly discussing their coffee, when, as the eloquence
of the assembly began to be unbottU-d over 1 the customary loyal and patriotic
toasts,' without the presence of a single reporter, the committee became alarmed,
and deputations came in rapid succession to inquire of the roporters 'if they were
not ooming up, accommodation having now been provided for them.' Tho gentle-
They, h'-wevor, were Impervious ; they had resolved not to report a single line of
the banquet speeches, and dosircd that tho tradesmen of Dudley, if they wore U"t
beforo aware of it, might now understand that reporters were unaccustomed Ut
accept the honours usually accorded only to flunkoys and cabmen. The reportci s
had previously telegraphed their decision to the proprietors of the papers upon
which they were engaged, and the banquet was unreported, and the speeches arc
as completely lost as Livr's lost books."
Now, on the abstract merits of the case, the reporters deserve the
credit of acting as became gentlemen who were insulted by a pack of
Snobs, eager that their sycophant addresses to their patron should be
recorded for the disgrace of their posterity. The selfrespect manifested
by the representatives of the Press would have, under ordinary cir-
cumstances, been treated by Mr. Punch as matter of course. But
there are times for all things, and there are occasions when to "do a
great right" casuists hold that we uiay "do a little wrong." When a
revelation was about to be made for which all England is looking with
curiosity, it was no time to be thinking about the vulgar snobbery of
Dudley tradesmen, but to rush in open-eared and open-booked, through
doors, windows, or down chimneys, whichever way was the readiest.
Lord Ward—just made Earl oe Dudley, was going to speak, and
who knows but that he was going to reveal the mystery why he was
made Earl? Nobody else in England seems to know it, and now t he
knowledge is likely to be lost to us for ever. We are, we repeat, not
pleased with these gentlemen of the press. In two views of the case
they did good t hings, they asserted the respect due to their profession,
and they squashed the probably servile utterances of the Dudley trades-
men, and the certainly silly utterance of their master. But inasmuch
as from the latter flood of washiness there might have been the grain
of gold—the truth—about the Earldom, Mr. Punch cannot forgive
those who perhaps allowed it to be carried away and lost with the rest
of the rubbish.
"Taken from the Trench."
A Frenchman was boldly laying down the law that the English had
no literature of their own—that they borrowed, or stole, everything from
the French. Upon being challenged for his proof, he said quite brag-
gadociously, as Frenchmen sometimes will say things: "Parcegue, vous
voyez, your two most populaire works are the Corneille* Magazine
and the Racine t Calendar."
* The French, we suppose, for CornkilL
t Tho Ditto, we guess, for Racing. The explanations aro indispensably necessary
to appreciate the depreciation.

THE PAPAL TRIBUTE.
"To-morrow Is to be a

A piece of tho true cross,
sent specially from Rome
for tho purpose, is to bo

_A very Rood expe-

the above paragraph.
There was a certain
Holy Coat of Treves
that did wonders in
this way. Still there
may be many of the
faithful in general
whose faith is not
quite wide mouthed
enough to swallow a
piece of wood or cloth
called holy, as un-
doubtedly genuine.
On such minds the
exposition of such relics would have no profitable effect. Could not Dfl, Cullkn have tried
a better trick, by getting the Pope to get the Neapolitan clergy to lend him the blood of
St. Januarius, and teach him how to liquefy it; and then by performing that miracle on the
all ar of Marlborough Street Cathedral P Plenty of people would have paid to witness that
exhibition, on condition of having their money returned in the event of its failure. More-
over, if the marvel were satisfactorily performed in the presence of a committee of chemists,
and under conditions prescribed by those men of science, a large addition would be made to
those of Her Majesty's subjects who are prepared to kiss the Pope's toe.

A Medical student, in allusion to the above

of 'the two paths' to follow in his profession—

THE ITALIAN QUESTION.
Louis Napoleon proposes that Tuscany

SEATS IN PARLIAMENT BY PURCHASE.
Mr. Speaker, Sir,
As there is evidently no serious desire in your House, and
none at all in another place, to prevent bribery and corruption, how
much time that is wasted in talking about their prevention might be
spared if the idea of preventing them were fairly abandoned, and a
much better plan adopted instead!
That plan I will do myself the honour to propose. What can't be
cured, says the proverb, must be endured. Sir, i move an amendment
on that adage. Make the best of a bad matter. The evil which you
cannot abolish, regulate. This maxim goes very deep, Sir. Regulate
bribery and corruption. In order to regulate them, legalise them.
Recollect, Sir, that by legalising my acceptance of a bribe, you do
not oblige me to accept it. I need not sell myself unless I choose. If
I please to be sordid, unfeeling, reprobate, degraded, spiritless,—a self-
sold slave, the voluntary bondsman of a bloated aristocracy, or equally
bloated commercial! interest,—let me be what I please. Am I a free
elector? Then suffer me to do as I like with my own; and freedom is
not mine unless I may sell it. Besides, if I have no conscience and no
convictions, what does it signify whether I vote bought or unbought?
You absolutely refuse to abolish the purchasersystem in the Army.
If it works well enough there, it will surely work well enough in your
House; the floor of which is a ground whereon incompetency is less
mischievous than it is in the field of battle. Legalise, therefore, the
purchase of votes. Then the Carlton and Reform Clubs will become
offices, at which gentlemen of opposite parties may inquire what
boroughs or counties are in the market, or, in any given borough or
county, how many of the free and independent electors there may be
for sale, and on what terms.
Now, Sir, what are the objections to this arrangement P The only
one worth notice is, that it would tend to the great increase of cor-
ruption and bribery. Sir, this is an advantage and not an objection.
It would enable you to restore the old constitutional method of Govern-
ment by Party. Constituencies would be divided into honest men and
rogues. Their representatives would form corresponding divisions in
your honourable House, and the humbugs would be all on one side uf
it, instead of sitting some of them on the Treasury Benches, others
opposite, or elsewhere.
1 need not add, that you would preclude all the useless trouble of
Election Committees, which never convict of bribery those who are
the principals in nearly every case of the sale and purchase of votes,
and never will convict them whilst bribery is treated by honourable
gentlemen as a joke—at the worst as an offence much less serious than
poaching. Legalise bribery, and, although a large portion of your
House will then represent unmitigated rogues, you will have the other
side consisting almost entirely of purely honest men; for the com-
bination of the former will oblige the latter to unite in their own
defence; and let us hope, for the honour of human nature, that virtue
would find herself in a parliamentary majority.
I have the honour to be, Sir, with a profound bow,
Your most Obedient Humble Servant,
P.S. When the original Crystal Palace was opened, for the Great
Exhibition, the police, at the inauguration of that World's Fair,
walked all the members of the swell mob who attended into one
division of seats, where they all sat together. Precisely the same
convenient separation between Members of Parliament would be the
result of the legalisation of bribery and corruption.

TOO CURIOUS BY HALF.
According to Sik Walter Scott, curiosity is the
busiest passion of the idle; and in giving them employ-
ment, there is therefore Bome small good in it. But
curiosity sometimes may be carried to absurdity, as the
following advertisement in the Times shows:—
THE £205 16». 6d, RECEIVED. Should like to know
whonce and why. Measey.
Now, really, with all deference, we think that this is
being too inquisitive by half. The quality of gratitude
in Mersey must be somewhat strained, if ne cannot take
the good things wherewith people may provide him without
asking them the why and wherefore they have done so.
He surely might rest satisfied with pocketing the money,
and leave to fate the finding out of the quarter whence it
came to him. Bank-notes are not so plentiful with by
far the greater number of us, that they drop into our
letter-boxes unasked for and in secret: and we think that
when they do so we might take them as they 're meant,
and not attempt to tear the veil from the face of the
transmitter. It clearly should content one to get hold of
the cash, without one's bothering the sender to tell one
why he sent it. Had he intended one to know it, of course
he would have written, and one need not be too nice
about pocketing such compliments, nor inquiring what the
motive was that prompted their preferment. Upon their
own merits, of course, modest men are dumb: but such
silence need not hinder one from having thought of one's
deserts, and feeling placid satisfaction when they chance
to be done justice to. For ourselves we are quite sure
that were any one, or any dozen, of our millions of
admirers to send us some such trifle as a couple of hundred
pounds, we should never dream of asking "whence and
why" it came to us, supposing that the present should
be made to us anonymously. However curious we might
be, we should never be so rude as to go stating in the
Times that such a douceur had been given us, and directing
public notice to what clearly was intended as a purely
private matter. Do you doubt us, gentle reader P Only

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PHYSICIANS AND FOOLS.
The subjoined advertisement, which lately appeared in
the Times, expresses a want that is perhaps rather
uncommon:—
rrO the PARENTS and GUARDIANS of IMBECILES
J- or IDIOTS.—A married surgeon, with every advautairo which
situation can command, wishes to meet with a Patiekt of the above
description, who would receive every care aud kindness.
A surgeon who wishes to meet with an idiotic or imbe-
cile patient, must be one of very strange sympathies or of
very unusual practice. Every medical man who has had
much experience of the treatment of disease will declare
that the most grievous difficulty encountered in dealing
with patients is that of making them understand the
necessity of conforming to the diet and regimen prescribed
in compliance with the natural laws. The majority of
ailing persons imagine that their complaints are all to be
relieved by means of drugs, and cannot be convinced that
exercise and regulated eating and drinking are requisite to
a cure. Surgeons and physicians in general will sorrow-
fully protest that, in their professional capacity, they
meet with only too great a uumber of idiots and imbeciles.
A TRAP TO CATCH LANDLADIES.
Landlady. I beg to tell you, Sir, that you are out of
gin (produce! empty bottle).
Tenant. Impossible: but stop, I'll see. (Goet into bed-
room, and returns with a full bottle.) I thought you were
wrong. I must tell you that I got these two bottles at
the same time. The bottle you hold in your hand I put in
the cupboard for your special consumption—the bottle 1
have here I kept under lock and key in the other room for
my own private use. The truth is, you drink much faster
than I do. Where your bottle is empty, you see that
mine is scarcely touched. You must excuse me, it is not
/ that am out of gin, but rather yourself.
[The Landlady is most virtuously indignant, but
evidently guilty.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PAKLIAMENT.
March 12. Monday. Something must be done with that intolerable
old party, Lord Normanby. He was up again to-day, pottering about
Italian affairs, of course in the interest of his friends the ex-tyrants.
The only extenuation for his speaking was that lie abused Lord Clan-
ricakde. The two squabbled for half an hour and more, when Lord
Gbanville desired them to shut up.
Some unpleasant jangling in the Commons about Savoy, the Oppo-
sition intimating that Ministers were as much to blame in the matter
as the Kmperor, and the Cabinet, of course, being unable to see the
thing in that light. Then came the discussion of one of the grand
features in the Budget, the Abolition of the Duty on Paper. There
was a good fight over the question, Sir William Miles contending
that the extra Income-Tax was too much to pay for free paper. A
good deal of nonsense was talked on both sides, or how could there
have been a debate: but in the end, after Mr. Horsman had fired off
an uncommon lot of hot shot at Mr. Gladstone (in revenge for being
laughed at last week), the Chancellor of the Exchequer appealed
to the Spirit of Hie Policy of Peel, which policy he said the measure
tended to promote, ami t ne second reading was carried by 245 to 192.
So died the Paper Duty, and Mr. Punch instantly doubled the already
enormous salaries paid to his young men.
Tuesday. Lord Chelmsford introduced a Bill, the object of which
was, he said, to put down Sunday t railing as much as possible, in order
to prevent persons from being robbed of their one day of rest. He
advocated the early paying of wages, and also the early closing move-
ment, and has evidently gained much by a careful and conscientious
study of his Punch.
in the Commons there was a field-night. Foreign affairs were
brought up by Lord John Russell, who declared that the Govern-
ment had done their very best for the Italians, and that he was very
proud of having aided in the re-establishment of Italy. Mr. White-
side considered that the Government were accomplices in the robbery
of Savoy. Mr. Milnes thought the world might be a gainer on the
whole transaction. Mr. Baillie Cochrane thought—but what on
earth docs it matter what Mr, Baillie Cochrane thought? Mr.
Strange Corn.—Forty odd pounds!
Horsman was only too happy to have another opportunity of attacking
Ministers. Lord Palmerston said that the annexation was objection-
able, but would do England no harm, and therefore we were not. going
to fight about it. He hoped, however, that the Emperor might be
induced to change his mind. Mr. Disraeli pitched into Lord John
Russell, who, he declared, had been for months aware of what was
intended, though he pretended not to believe in it. Mr. Kinglake
thought Lord Palmerston's speech "very gratifying," which meant
that Mr. Kinglake did not attach the slightest value to the Premier's
hopes, and there was some more talk on the subject, which then
dropped. Colonel Stkes next rose to ask for information on a matter
of no less importance than the re-organisation of the Indian Army, and,
of course, the House was Counted Out. However, as this week the
telegraph has been laid from Alexandria to Kurrachee (Western India,
Wiscount, near the mouths of the Indus, and you are quite right to
ask when you don't know), and we can now hear from India in six
days, the House of Commons will be rather rudely electrified out of its
indifference to the affairs of what was, and is not, a distant country.
Wednesday. Mr. Locke King moved the second reading of a Bill for
enabling the clergy of the Church of England to perform its rites
wherever they might please, without the leave of bishops, incumbents, or
anybody else. This proposition was a good deal at variance with received
notions of clerical discipline, and inasmuch as at present people rather
look to the bishops to keep impetuous or eccentric parsons in order,
the emancipating the latter from all control did not appear to be a very
good measure of police. Mr. Walpole opposed the Bill, as did the
Government, and it was rejected by 168 to 131. In the course of the
debate Lord Robert Cecil took a mild shy at the Four Jews in the
House, intimating that they must consider as an insult to them the
raising any discussion on a question of Christian education. To him
responded the clever Hebrew of the four, Sir F. Goldsmid, who
assured him that the Jews were very desirous that Christians should
be instructed in their own faith. This complaisance is delightful, and
really Mr. Punch wonders that, with such extreme liberality of views,
it is worth the while of the Jews to be Jews at all. He hereby invites
them to come over. Also in the course of the debate young Lord
Ashley, son of the Eakl op Shaftesbury, uttered a little bit ol
vol. xxxvin.

sailor! v fun about a clergyman preaching from the stage, with a garden
scene behind him, and perhaps forbidden fruit." It is to be supposed
that his stern parient had been clown upon him in the interval between
the appearance of the report and the next publication of the Timet, for
Ashley hastened to explain in a letter, that he didn't mean anything
against preaching in theatres, which process indeed he heartily approved.
To adapt the Rev. IngoldsbyLegend, "the Earl had a rod which he

Thursday. The Lords had their say on the Savoy business. Lord
Taunton (the fluent Labouchere of other days) moved agreement in
Address on the Treaty, and the Earl of Cork, who had been selected
as a compliment to the victimised Cork-cutters, seconded T. Earl
Grey fired into the Treaty and into the Budget, and considered our
honour stained by the belief abroad that England had agreed to the
annexation of Savoy to promote her own mercantile interests. Poor
England, she is made answerable for everything; and indeed the
Dresden Journal solemnly avers that the Savoy business is entirely
England's fault. We shall no doubt be made responsible for the next
eruption of Vesuvius, and told that if we had not laughed at St.
Januarius, the volcano would not have burst out. Lord Woodhouse,
selected in compliment to the Timber trade (he does not spell his name
so, but what does that signify P) defended the Budget, and Lord
Malmesburt strongly condemned Government, and was very sorry to
see Electds going to the bad. Some small men followed, and then
Lord Derby assailed the Treaty, and in the calmest manner appro-
priated (and spoiled) the idea of one of Mr. Punch's Immortal Cartoons.
Lord Derby described the Treaty as "a sop thrown to England
by France." Now, really we have a liking for Lord Derby,
who has many good points about him, and whenever he sends
us a fourpenny telegram by the London District Telegraph Company's
wire, asking us for a few ideas, he will not deny that we send him a
hat-full with the greatest readiness. But our Cartoons are solemn and
sacred things, and we cannot have them played with. Lord Derby
ought to have known better. The Duke of Newcastle, selected in
compliment to the Coal interest, defended the Government, and Lord
Grey took a division. There had been no Conservative whip, and
there was no intention of doing anything real. The Contents were 68,
and the professed non-Contents were 38. Mr. Punch cleverly replied
to Lord Campbell, who said to him, that the majority was an index of
the feeling of the country, that bis Lordship talked unwisely, as
Contents and Index were very different.
In the Commons came the best bit of business of the Session. Sir
Richard Bethell brought in his Bill for Reforming the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency System. Under the present swindling arrangement,
Thirty-three per Cent, of a bankrupt's property is swallowed up by the
expenses of collection. SrR Richard sweeps away the whole abomi-
nable edifice; appoints a Bankruptcy Judge, who is to be as big a wig
as any of the other Judges, and a set of Registrars to do the small work.
He abolishes the absurd distinction between Bankrupts and Insolvents,
gives any person the right to come before the Court on his own petition,
and does a great deal towards getting rid of imprisonment for debt.
Our learned friend spoke capitally (his slash at the Bankruptcy Com-
missioners, who "indecorously" read newspapers on the bench, did
not escape us), and his Bill is an exceedingly good Bill. Mr. Punch
quotes Pope, exactly, in his learned friend's honour:—
"Thus Bethel spoke, who always speaks his thought.
And always thiuka the very thing he ought.■—B. I. Sat. II.
More Budget, and the Hops were dealt with. The car of Juggernaut
went on, as somebody said to the Wiscount, who instantly aud wittily
replied, that a Jug o' nought was not so good as a Jug of Beer.
Friday. Naples is in a very alarming state, the King, in his frenzy
of terror, persecuting all respectable persons in the most brutal manner.
There are several English ships in the lovely bay, and noble lords
wanted to know what were the instructions of the commanders. The
very sensible answer was. that the commanders were to use their own
discretion, and noble lords perfectly well understood what, under the
circumstances, this meant. Government made a red-tape answer on
the question of dividing the diocese of Rochester, and creating a new
see. of which St. Albans' Abbey should be the Cathedral, but the thing
will be done one of these days.
Mr. Bright took Mr. Newdegate to task for having spoken of
Mr. Cobden as an admirer of French institutions and of the French
Emperor, and Mr. Newdegate made a spirited answer, complimenting
Mr. Bright for his friendly chivalry, Dut asserting himself to be
justified in all that he had said. The Conversazione then set in with
extreme severity, and Mr. Bouverie got in such a rage that he
likened the proceedings on Friday night, to Mr. Albert Smith's
Qalignani song. For this we suggest that the Entertainer owes
Bouverie one, which we should pay somewhat in the following
fashion:—
"And how a most wonderful kind of discoovery
Was made by a Scotch representative, Bouverie,
Who says that the varied discussion which he'd a
Desire to put down's like my ollapodrida:
I think the comparison's one I must scorn,
The Treasury gets Chaff where my treasury gets corn."
A Chinese debate, originated by Sir De Lacy Evans, occupied tho
latter part of the evening. Divers Members thought that we had no
business to chastise China, and others that we ought not to take
Blectus as our colleague in the business. Mr. Baillie Cochrane
signalised himself in the discussion, by foolishly accusing Lord
Palmerston of making a joke on a grave subject, and caught some-
thing which even Cochrane must have understood. The merry old
Premier said, indignantly, that he had done nothing of the kind, and
that no man of common feeling who respected himself, would unjustly
impute such a thing to another. If Cocky has not asked for the
Chiltern Hundreds be is a pachydermatous Cocky. Nothing came of
the debate, but Government proceeded to ask for £850,000 on account of
the Chinese expedition, anil it was instantly voted. News for the
"Straight Street of Benevolence and Joy."
TEMPESTUOUS DICTION.
One of the greatest advantages enjoyed by the superior classes is
that of a superior education. Another, equally great, is that of the
intelligent and cultivated society in which members of the aristocracy
especially converse, and thus learn to express themselves, as well in
speech as in writing, with a singular propriety; whereof a shining
example is afforded in the following composition, addressed—
"To the Editor of the 'Morning Pott'
"Sir,—I did not plead guilty of inconsistency in voting for the budget, while I at
the same time voted for the budget, as your article of to-day alleges; on the con-
ttary, I justified that course, aud snail be at auy time prepared to do so.
"I consider, if the results expected to accrue from the budget to England and
France ore real, and in accordance with the wishes of both peoples, they can be
carried out by a commercial arrangement—call it convention, or what you wilt; but
I protest against the approval of the House of Commons being asked, under cover
of financial arrangements, to a sham treaty of peace, which, according to appear-
ances, might easily be nut in jeopardy; and that the people of England should, by
their representatives, indirectly affirm, as it is considered in Europe they will do,
their acquiescence iu the French Emperor's views of aggrandisement, by tho con-
sent of the House of Commons to the address of the Crown on the treaty Her
Majesty has been advised to ratify.

Pausing only now and then to admire the perspicuity of the above
epistle, it is possible to read as for as the word jeopardy; but there the
structure of the letter becomes so luminous as to compel the dazzled
reader to stop short. The noble writer protests against the approval
of the House of Commons being asked to" a sham treaty of peace,
and he seems also to protest that the people of England should indi-
rectly affirm their acquiescence in the French Emperor's views of
aggrandisement. Is this what he means to say tbey ought to dof

GOOD AND BAD BITTER BEER
"Cornet O'Flagon presents his compliments to Mr. Punch, and,
on behalf of Her Majesty's whole Indian Army, desires to declare his
unbounded confidence in the genuineness of Messrs. Bass and Messrs.
ALLSorp's Pale Ale, and to apprise any fellah who may entertain a
contrary opinion, that he (the Cornet) is to be heard of at the Blue
Posts."
Mr. Punch would be very loth to differ from Cornet O'Flagon on
any subject, and quite agrees with him as to the genuineness of the
beer which is supplied by Messrs. Allsopp and Messrs. Bass. The
bitter ale which Mr. Punch hates and despises, and which he denounced
in a recent number, is the nauseous mess manufactured by incompetent
brewers, and retailed by dishonest publicans as a counterfeit of the
"barley bree'" brewed at Burton. It is All-slop and Base, and not
Allsopp and Bass, that Mr. P. detests.

CHAPTER VIII.—PERIOD—FROM THE EXIT OF THE DANES
TO THE ENTRY OF THE NORMANS.
E said in our sixth chapter,
that we thought it rather
doubtful if the Saxon gents
wore glores, and there seems
equal reason for our doubting
if the Danes did. As some
what of a proof that the
Saxon ladies wore them, the
careful reader will remember
we made mention of a minia-
ture, in which the sitter is
depicted with her left hand
in a glove. We then won-
dered if the lady had a right
hand glove as well, ana if
she had, we wondered why
she did not wear it. Our
bepuzzlement, however, lias
been cleared up on these
points, and humanity inclines
us to clear away the cloud of
doubt in which we left our
readers. A manuscript which
lies before us while we write,
aud which we may claim to
be the first to bring to light,
states gravely, that the per-
son in the miniature referred
to was the herdsman's wife who gave King Alfred a black eve,
because lie did not look well to the browning of her cakes. The
fact of the black eye is disputed by some writers. Asserius says
simply that "shee didde boxe hys eares." a phrase which might imply
that the gloves she wore were boxing-gloves. But whether this be so
or not, it is stated in our manuscript that .King Alfred cribbed and
kept her right glove as a keepsake, and this plainly was the cause why
she was painted only in that which Alfred left her, and which was
her left. In his comments on the story, which the best of our histo-
rians think is too good to be true, Asserius says, "y* blowe dyd gette
uppe quite a breeze," and though "ye kinge'a leftte eare was hyt," he
adds, "yette itte dyd serve hym rightte. This, however, we must
construe as said meiely for a joke; for in writing thus Asserius must
be an ass if he be serious.
So far as we can learn, the Danish arms and armour were not unlike
the Saxon, excepting in those points in which they were dissimilar.
Volunteers with them were
not so common as pressed
men, at .'<east if we may judge
so from the laws of Gula, said
to have been established by
King Hacon the Good. By
these it was enacted, that
men who were possessed of
such a fortune as six marks
should be required to arm
themselves with a red shield
of two boards' thickness, and
for weapons were to carry a
spear and axe or sword. In
addition to these articles,
possessors of twelve marks
were to wear a steel cap, and
men of greater mark, who _ _^
owned as much as eighteen TV Qf\ I [\
marks, were obliged to buy a *XV ^ «>— U
helmet and a coat of mail
besides. 80 that the armour
of the people was propor-
tioned to their pockets; for
in their savage barbarism
(how unlike our own en-
lightenment !) the lives and
limbs of paupers were es-
teemed of far less consequence than those of millionaires.
Why the Danish shields were red, we cannot undertake to say; but
as the Danes were mostly pirates, it seems likely that they liked to
look something like Red Rovers. The spear, the sword, the bow, and
the double-bladed axe were the weapons with which they used to make
themselves offensive: and in the use of the two latter, they were
thoroughly expert. To their swords in fun they sometimes gave the

playful name of "guern-bit," which rendered into English means
simply "millstone-biter." It was with one of these, if we believe the
chronicles, that King Canute fought his famous single combat with
old Ironside, as the Saxon monarch Edmund was familiarly termed.
The fight came off at Athelney, as everybody knows; and was one of
the most famous broadsword battles ever witnessed. By the account
in the Medulla Eutorwe Anglicante, which may be regarded as the
Bell't L\fe of the period, the honour of "first blood" was claimed for
old Ned Ironside; and when, after administering a slogging upper
cut, he was held entitled to claim "first knock-down blow," the Dane
threw np the sponge to the disgust of all his backers, and "thynkinge
of hys bettere halfe didde cry oute lustilye for quartere."

APPROPRIATE AIRS. •
The Anniversary Festival of one of the most charitable institutions
in the world, the Asylum for Idiots, was celebrated on Friday last
week at the London Tavern by what the reporter of the celebration
calls a very elegant dinner. It is known that dinners are tastefully as
well as savourily provided at the London Tavern; but heartiness,
rather than elegance, on the whole, might perhaps be expected to
characterise a banquet which took place in the City of London, and
whereat the Chairman was, as we are informed, "supported by Mr.
Alderman and Sheriff Phillits, Mr. Sheriff Gabriel, Alder-
man Abbiss, Alderman Lawrence, Mr. Under-Sheriff Eagle-
ton," and other guests of less note. However, on this occasion, the
scene of festivity was not one of gross animal indulgence—of mere
eating and drinking. The refined pleasures of song were adjoined to
the gratification of the palate. Certain musical arrangements were
made for affording, as it were, an accompaniment to turtle aud other
food things. After "Prosperity and Perpetuity to the Asylum for
diots" had been proposed by the Duke of Cambridge, who occupied
the chair, in a good practical speech—
"The toast having beon druuk with loud applause, was followed by a four part
song, 'Tht Idiot Born,' a solo in which was beautifully rendered by Miss Susanna
Cole."
Some composers have been called inspired idiots, and it was perhaps
a genius of this order who conceived the idea of such a composition as
that above named. Associations apart, one might imagine The Idiot
Born" to have been some such a gem of the "Little Warbler" as
"Such a Beauty I did Grow ;" but, the occasion considered, it could
hardly have been a comic song. Strange things, however, are some-
times done in the City; and after hearing that "Tie Idiot Born" was
sung at the banquet on behalf of the Asylum for unfortunate persons
of that description, we should not be surprised to learn that at a civic
hospital dinner the! company had been diverted by a funny vocalist,
who, in pleasing connection with the subject of surgery, sang them
"The Cork Leg."
Very Evident.
A Discerning friend of ours told us, a short time back, that in Ids
opinion "there was nothing like humbug in this world." This may or
may not be the case. One thing, however, is pretty certain: if there
is nothing like it, there is, at any rate, a great dial of the original
article itself.

THE NEW EUSSELL SIX-POUNDEE.
We live in days of wonders, both social and mechanical,
Of fabulous projectiles, of forces quite Titanical:
Of Lancaster & Armstrong guns, & Wbit worth's next, out-topping them;
Till soon, it seems, our shots will fly so far there '11 be no stopping them.
Inspired by the ambition to rival these inventors,
Lo, next on the arena, my Lord John Russell enters!
And ancient limitations discarding as conjectural,
Brings forward his six-pounder—the new long-range electoral.
As Lancaster on earlier inventors made improvement.
And Armstrong far past Lancaster has urged projectile movement:
While Whitworth with his short-pitched screw, true-plane, and hair's-
breadth gauges,
To throw a shot two miles for one of Armstrong's now engages—
So in our franchise-canons we have witnessed the extension
Of range, from time to time, since Grey's first effort of invention,
When Lord John, then powder-monkey, being small and made some
fun of
By way of compensation was allowed to let the gun off.
But since the day that he fired off Lord Grey's Reform ten-pounder,
Lord John of his own trumpet has been unwearied sounder—
And from having/rerf the gun— (which he did, but half repented it)—
Has talked on all occasions as if he had invented it.
Till now, determined to out-do all that's been since projected,—
From that five-barrelled gun, of which the Chartists much expected,
(And the terror of whose bursting made forty-eight so nervous)
Down to Locke Kino's ten-pounder, devised for County service,
And that very ill-planned weapon. Dizzy's late ten-pound brass cannon,
Which the verdict of the nation has placed decisive ban on
Whose recoil, upon first firing, not only broke the limbers,
''lut floored the firing-party, and shivered Dizzy's timbers-
Determined to out-do all these, and make himself immort al.
Lord John at length wheels his new gun through Pembroke Lodge's
portal,
It isn't more imposing in dimensions than its maker,
And looks harmless as the wooden gun, which Jack-tars call a 'quaker.'
But "Frond nulla fides" is as true of guns as persons;
And reasons may be given (and tolerably terse 'uns),
Why Russell's new six-pounder—though its power appears so trifling—
May go farther than we dream of, 'tis so well devised for rifling.
The propelling power's enormous, though the charge is but a light one,
Not a grain of force is wasted, the projectile's such a tight one;
As for the cost of practice, that Lord John declares he '11 not mind;
But it isn't those who fire it first who '11 have to pay the shot, mind.
Perhaps the new six-pounder, upon its present trial,
Mayn't go the lengths some say it will, in teeth of all denial;
But use it a few years, and (unless, in use it crack'd is),
I'm very much mistaken if it don't make startling practice!
Then we may see it sending its bolt beyond the landmarks
That now bound England's practice-ground, but will then be rased like
sandmarks,
Till far past e'en the far-off post inscribed with " Household Suffrage,"
The shot still on and onwards speeds its ricochetting rough rage,
To where upon a dreary tract, rude as a backwood clearing,
The "Universal Suffrage" Pole its rough-hewn arms is rearing;
And there the shot may spend its force, and, ere itself it bury.
May work its last of mischief in what whalers call its "flurry."
We may never see such practice from this little gun which Russell
Has at last got in position, by dint of tug and tussle.
But others treading in his track—though Lords,they've nought to say
to—
Will find a gun to reach the goal that his gun goes half-way to.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TOTAL ABSTINENCE OF THE TIPSY.
ur friends of the United
Kingdom Alliance are in-
vited to ponder the sub-
joined passage in the
examination of a gentle-
man who gave evidence I
before the Dover Election
Committee. The name
of this gentleman was
Edward Allen; the
profession described as
that of boot and shoe-
maker, but perhaps, in
reality, that of repairer
of boots and shoes. Mr.
Allen deposed that he
had taken a bribe of 25».
to vote for Leeke and
Nicoll. His place of
residence at the time of
the election was Canter-
bury, which city he left
for Dover, there to exer-
cise the privileges of a
free and independent
elector, having gone
thither on Friday after-
noon, and returned at
the same time on Monday.
Question and answer
follow:—
'' Whero did you eat ?—I did not have any food, btit I bad plenty to drink.
"Wbat I did you not have anything to eat from Friday till Monday afternoon ?—I ate nothing
all that time. I don't want anything to eat when I am drinking. He was with bis frionds ana
drank at his own expense, except when at Suarp'r, who kept a public-houso, and there he did
not pay anything for what he bad. Tbe reason he stayed at Dover till Monday was to get his
halfpence. It did not pay him for his three days' loss of time, but ho was satisfied, as he saw bis
old friends and had a drop of drink.4
From the above interesting account given of himself by Mr. Allen, we are
enabled to infer that there are certain times and seasous
of some continuance, during which he is accustomed to
devote himself with peculiar industry and application to
drinking. These phases of his existence he significantly
characterised by the expression "when I am drinking,"
which may be regarded as a euphemism, the plain un-
varnished sense of which is, when I am in a state of beer
amounting to chronic intoxication.
The liquor under the influence of which Mr. Allen is
wont to remain some days together without eating, may, to
be sure, be brandy or brandy-and-water, gin or gin-and-
water, rum or rum-and-water; but beer is the more likely,
as that beverage comprehends both food and drink. The
supposition that this fine specimen of a British Elector is
a mender rather than a maker of boots and shoes, is sug-
gested by his acknowledgment of being subject to
periodical accessions of dipsomania. This is singularly
characteristic of those disciples of St. Crispin who are
entrusted with the cure of soles, and who are addicted not
only to the worship of St. Crispin, but also to that of
St. Monday; which is one of the worst of the errors of
Romanism, and of Protestantism to boot. The Alliance
is respectfully recommended to consider whether Mr.
Gladstone's new Tariff, by cheapening wine, may not, in
some instances, have the nappy effect of refining, if not
of reforming, the habits of such a gentleman as Mr. Allen,
in at least converting the beery operative of the awl into
a sherry-cobbler.
Bark v. Bite.
The Romagnoles are threatened with excommunication
for their desire to get out of the "Bark of St. Peter."
They declare they have no objection to the bark of St.
Peter. What they object to is the bite of St. Peter's repre-
sentative.
The Undefended One.—Sir De Lact Evans has
been chivalrously defending Lord Lucan. Will no one
come forward now, and say a kind word in favour of the
Earl of Cardigan P
THE POPE SELLING OFF.
Synchronously with the rumour of the Hapsburg sale (or sell F)
there has reached us a report that the PorE has made his mind up to
retire at once from business, and is about to send to auction all his
stock in trade of relics, his peepshows, and his miracles, and other
valuable effects. The sale, which is expected to extend over some
weeks, will comprise, we are informed, all the juggling apparatus of
the holy Romish Church. Among the tricks will be observed the
Winking Picture of Rimini, the Blood of Januarius, and the Vision of
La Salette. All these will be warranted in good working condition,
and with each lot will be furnished a table of instructions, showing
how to do the trick. His Holiness, moreover, will by his sale condi-
tions be bound to give a lesson in the art of holy juggling, to any of
the purchasers who call on him to do so: and to attend in person the
first working of a miracle, to see that all goes smoothly, and that the
dodge be kept quite dark. For instance, when the Blood of good St.
Januarius is intended to be liquefied to gullify the faithful, his Holiness
in person will attend the few first melting-days, and will superintend
the sanguinary dripping, as chief cook.
The holy relics to be sold amount to many hundreds, and are ex-
pected to realise a very large amount. No matter how great their
antiquity may be, they will all of them be found in capital condition,
care having been from time to time taken to renew them, whenever
they showed symptoms of decay or wearing out. The hair-shirt of St.
Filthius has been recently fresh sleeved, and the odour of sanctity will
be perceived to cling to it, although for fear of some infection it not
long ago was washed. Moreover, still attached to it is the sacred
piece of thread, which was miraculously sent to the relief of the good
Saint, on the morning when he found the garment with a button off.
St. Peter's coat is also in first-rate preservation, notwithstanding the
long period through which it has existed, and the wear and tear to
which, in pious exhibition, it has daily been exposed.
The waistcoat of St. Timothy will likewise be disposed of, the rumour
that the moth was in it being quite unfounded, as. it was only some six
months since that, although warranted "original," the vestment was
re-made. Particular attention will, moreover, be invited to the trousers
of St. Titus, which having just been seated, will last for some years
longer, before the owners will be put to the expense of fresh repairs.
But still more durable perhaps have been the slippers of St. Vitus,
which, having been new-topped, new-sided, and new soled, will be
discovered even yet in good salutable condition, notwithstanding all
the centuries through which they have been kissed.
It should be observed that, for the comfort of the faithful, with each
relic which is offered will be issued a certificate, to prove its perfect
genuineness, and to verify its truth. This is the more needful, inas-
much as unbelievers have been known to raise a doubt of the reality of
relics, and thereby have not only cast an insult on the Church, but,
what is more important, have jeopardised a source of income to her
priests. For instance, they have said that no coat of mortal make
could have ever lasted so long as has St. Peter's, considering how often
the garment has changed hands, and being made a peep-show of, how
much it has been pulled about. They moreover have affirmed that far
more hair of holy St. Hirsutus has been sold, than any score of skulls
could ever have produced; and that if good St. Dentatus had possessed
a hundred mouths, his jaws would not have held above one half of the
false teeth, which have been sown broadcast abroad, and publicly pro-
claimed as his. The certificates, however, tp which we have referred
will, it is hoped, suffice to silence these malignants, or at any rate will
serve to satisfy the faithful, and so long as they are satisfied, the Church
will re.it content. By the appended declaration of his Holiness the Pope,
or by other equally convincing legal evidence, it will be proved to
demonstration that the linen shirt of St. Filthius is the identical same
garment which was worn by the good saint; and a voucher will be
given with the bunion of St. Limpa and the toe-nails of St. Splaypes,
attested by the signatures or crosses of the faithful, by whom those
sacred relics have oeen severally cut.
So far as we can learn, it has not yet been settled who will be en-
trusted with the business of the sale. But a rumour is afloat that
Cardinal Wiseman will be honoured with the post of auctioneer,
for which his Eminence, we think, is very eminently fitted. Whether
the mantle of George Robins will be found to have descended on him,
is more than we at present can undertake to say; but we know that he
is not unaccustomed to the pulpit, and we have no doubt he will prove
himself well able to hold forth from it, with his usual glib utterance,
and oiliness of speech. Not having had much practice in the wielding
of the hammer, it may be questioned if his Eminence would feel himself
at home with it; and we ourselves incline to fancy it would somewhat
be more suitable, if the holy lots were knocked down with the Holy
Poker.

A SUNNY AFTERNOON IN VENICE.
To the student of Geography, there is no place like Burford's Panorama.
It is always full of maps, and every map has the advantage of being beautifully
coloured. Atlas supported the world on his back. Mr. Burfobd does more than
that: he carries the entire globe on the point of his paint-brush. Ask for any city
you like; and, with two or three effective touches, in less time than you can com-
pose a salad, he will produce it, to the satisfaction of your taste, and most
harmoniously mixed, before you. If anything, the oil will perhaps preponderate,
but that cannot be considered a fault, either in a salad or in one of Mr. Burford's
pictures. The latest-gathered one out of his extensive pictorial garden is Venice.
Austria might dispute his right to take it; but, never mind, he has taken it,—and
we doubt if Francis-Joseph even could quarrel with the admirable way in which
it has been carried off, atmosphere, water, and all, without spilling a drop out of
the one hundred and forty-six canals, which, like the veins in the body of a water-
drinker, intersect it. And all this has been done with a gorgeousness of colour
that Etty might have envied, and with such a firmness of hand as Canalettt him-
self must have approved. We doubt if a single thing has been damaged in the
removal. Not a feather even of the numerous pigeons, that, fearless of Austrian
pies and Austrian police, fly, thick as flakes in a snow-storm, over the many-
steepled head of the sunny city, has been ruffled by being carried body and bones
off to Leicester Square. They seem as happy in that small garret, up ten flights
of stairs (which are almost as high as the Campanile itself, only ten times more
difficult to mount), as though they were waltzing themselves into a state of almost
white heat under their hot Italian sky, or were dipping down below into the
Adriatic to cool themselves afterwards,—like unto white-muslined ladies we know
at home, who, after dancing themselves quite limp all the evening, dive down-stairs
to moisten their rosy little feverish beaks with something refreshing to drink!
"Beautiful Venice," as Mr. Knight calls it in his Henry-Russellite song, sits
upon the waters as gracefully as a swan,—only so gaudy is its plumage that, like a
peacock, would be nearer the mark (the St. Mark we were about to say), but then
peacocks do not sit upon the water. It is a mermaid of a city, with half its body
under the waves, and with the Lagune by way of mirror, in which it can always be
contemplating; its mosaics and the numerous other antique
charms that it has hanging from its elegant waist. The
water is as clear as any Venetian glass. The sun is so
glaring that we almost require a Venetian blind to guard
our eyes against it. That large square, with its lava
pavement, looks so hot that the laziarone, who is crossing
it with bare feet, will certainly be able to break his fast
to-day with a pair of fried soles. The only shady arbour
of refuge is under one of the porches of the Cathedral,
which is as richly chased, as elaborately carved, as any
curious weapon by Cellini. You can wipe your streaming
forehead under a triumphal arch of saints, festooned closely
together, so that if one dropped, you imagine all the others
would drop, like the beads of a rosary, when the string has
been broken. Or you can dissipate your caloric and melan-
choly by sauntering, by the side of the Cathedral, under
the rich colonnade of two hundred and ninety-two columns
of marble, that is much handsomer than the Cafe de Mille
Colonnes at Paris, and with not the angry clash of dominoes
to be heard in it. If you want the dominoes, you must go
into the square of St. Mark, where the Carnival is going on
with all the decorous solemnity of an English masquerade.
By the bye, this Place of St. Mark reminds one somewhat
of the Palais Boyal, with its framework of many-storeyed,
many-windowed houses, and close lines of pillars standing
all in a row, as though they were going to be reviewed at
the same time as the light regiment of gas-lamps, to say
nothing of the warren of shops that are burrowing under-
neath the arcade, and the bustling cafes, that push them-
selves forward, like the Cafe" de. la Kotonde, to meet the
customer half-way. It is very like the Palais Ttoval, and
we only miss the "Diners a 32 sous," and the celebrated
cannon, which reaches the meridian of its glory when it
happens, with the punctuality of a minute-gun, to bang off
accurately at noon. We never hear that favourite explosion
without involuntarily exclaiming, "There goes the Gun of
a Sun!"
The most peculiar feature about Venice is the absence
of omnibuses and vehicles of all kinds. We did not even
see a perambulator. It reminded us of London on the
morning of the strike of the cabmen, when there was not
a cab to be had for love or money. The Hansoms here are
gondolas; and as for the busses, they are all replaced by
small smacks. The only animal you see is the winged lion
of St. Mark. No fear of hydrophobia, for not a dog is to
be seen, unless you meet with an Autrichien. A case of
glanders, also, has never been known within the memory of
the oldest Venetian Boy. Every saddler and spurmaker
died of starvation long ago. Veterinary surgeons would
have nothing to do, unless they were called in to operate
on one of the four bronze horses that stand over the
portico of St. Mark's, as though they were going to pull
down the large stained window that is behind them.
There is not a hoof-print visible about the place, excepting
such as the Austnans have left behind them in riding
roughshod over the town. With the above exceptions, no
animals have been seen on the Bialto for centuries. We
fancy Wombwell's menagerie would make its fortune
here in a season, only perhaps the Venetians might be dis-
gusted at finding it contained no winged lion.
More might be said about this water-queen of cities, if
one had more time in which to say it. If she is anything
like her portrait, she has no reason to be dissatisfied with
her painter. Moreover, Mr. Buskin has given a written
testimonial deposing to the lithographic likeness of all and
each of the " Stones of Venice with which, like a proud
beauty going to a grand ball, she has arrayed herself: St.
Mark's is a small Hunt & Boskell's of precious jewels by
itself. Messrs. Prout, Cooke, Stanfield, and a whole
host of other admirers, have also left their cards to renew
their acquaintance with one, in whose lovely presence
they have spent so many happy and profitable hours.

AN EGGSHELLENT REASON FOB KEEPING FRIENDS WITH FRANCE.
miably conversing with
our cheesemonger last
week (for true greatness
can never be demeaned
by affability), we asked
him, what he thought of
our friends across the
Channel, and whether he
considered that their cab-
baging Savoy ought, as
Mb. Horsman thinks,
to lead us to a rupture
with them. "Rupture!
law, Sir I" he re-
sponded, looking fright-
fully alarmed; "why
you don't mean to say,
Sir, as you've fears
there '11 be a split!
Well, all as I can say is,
I hope it won't come
true; for if the peace
were broke, Sir, my busi-
ness would be smashed.
I'd just leave you to tell
me, Sir, where am I to
go for my 'Best Dorset
Fresh,' when our 'friends
across tbe Channel* as
you calls 'em, shuts up
shop to us? And then,
what am I to do, Sir, for
my 'Warranted New
Laid Eggs,' when we
come to have a rupture
with our friends across
the Channel, who, I'll
be bound to say, have
always got a six months'
stock of'em in pickle for
us? No, no, Sir. Let
our friends just cabbage
their Savoy, and don't
let us be green enough to go and interfere with 'em. That 'ere scrap o' land, Sir, ain't of no account
to us. It's our friends across the Channel as we keeps our account with, which their bills for
'newlaids' and for'freshes' is most 'eavy. We don't get nothing from Savoy, Sir, exceptin' of
them organ-grinders, which Mr. Punch is right in kicking of 'em 'ome again. But our friends

the Channel, Sir, are always seuding
us nice things, and when they gets to
Nice, Sir, perhaps they'll send us nicer.
My belief is, that our friends have a
strong wish to keep friendly, and the
more we deal with 'em the stronger
they will wish it. I've no mind to
flatter 'em, and nobody shall say that
I want to give 'em this," emphatically
slapping a firkin as he spoke, "but
though they have their faults (such as
short credit and short weight), the
French. Sir, on the whole, are a most
egg-sellin' people."
"METHINKS I SEE MY FATHER I"
Wb always thought that there was
some mystery about the Editor of the
Morning Advertiser. We felt that in
some way he was a great man, though
we did not exactly know how. But, the
other day, he suddenly cleared up the
mystery, and revealed his parentage.
He claims haughty descent from the
Minister who perished by the hand of
Bellinghah. Appended to a letter
from a correspondent of the Advertiser,
he says, "Although dissenting from
the views of Mr. Perceval, st ill, as a
son of a late Prime Minister of England,
We insert his letter—Ed." Well, as
Mr. Tennyson says in the Idylls,
"A holy man was Perceval and pure,"
and we cordially congratulate our
contemporary on the disclosure of his
illustrious pedigree.

CONFISCATION FOR CLERKS AND OTHERS.
To the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone.
Mr dear Sir,
Did you really utter the subjoined words, which are put into
jour mouth, or rather made to issue from it, by a parliamentary re-
porter? They relate to the impost for the expiration of which in the
present year you made such ingenious arrangements, but which,
instead, you are going to re-impose and aggravate:—
11 It is Impossible to deny that it is a grievous tax, as it affects persona of small
incomes, and especially of small fixed incomes."
I hope that one particular word in the above extract from one of
your eloquent orations on finance has been misreported. For "fixed"
I trust that we ought to read "precarious." But then the mistake
will prove an unfortunate one; because there are some admirers of
your great genius who, receiving implicitly all that you say, will echo,
as your expression, a misprint which is just the reverse of it.
To those undiscerning disciples of yours, not of course, Sir, to so
profound a thinker as yourself, I would put two cases in point:—
A. has £150 a year income derived from 3 per Cent. Consols, or from

cantile firm in whose service he is a clerk. His employers may any
day fail, and go to the dogs, leaving him to follow them. His health
may fail him, and he may go to the dogs by himself. Here are two
persons each of small incomes affected by the Income-Tax, and paying
equal amounts thereof. To which of them is the Income-lax especially
grievous; to the one who lives in daily danger of losing his little all,
which is all taxed, or to the other who, however severely the mere
produce of his estate may be taxed, is still sure of some constant
annual income in addition to his permanent capital which he will
possess for bis life-time, and may leave behind him at Lis death.

which of them you would be if you were unhappily reduced to a choice
between them, I cannot doubt. I feel pretty confident that you would
rather experience the pressure of the Income-Tax in the person of the
sufferer with the small fixed income than in that of tbe victim with the
small uncertain one. It is very true that you do not know what it is
to feel that you are dependent for your living upon resources which
are at any moment in imminent danger of destruction. Had you ever
enjoyed this experience, perhaps you would feel even more keenly than
you do, with what especial seventy the Income-Tax presses on small
precarious incomes, as you said that it does if you were misreported,

THE BABY BOMBA, A CHIP OF THE OLD BLOCK-HEAD.
A WELL-MERITED PUNISHMENT.
A Just penalty has fallen upon us. The indiscreet
insertion in our last week's publication, of "whether
Por-terre was on any ground related to J/bMeY-Earth P"
has brought down upon our guilty heads the following,
from a vindictive correspondent, who maliciously inquires
"Whether the Bois {Boy) de Boulogne is the ligneal
descendant of the Pas de Calais?" The first we pro-
nounce boldly, and with a keen sense of shame, to be
weak enough; but the second we fearlessly declare, and,
without any flattery, to be. if possible, even weaker.
However, it serves us perfectly right. We promise to be
more careful for the future.

The Califomian market has been flooded by an influx
of bad "Eagles"—the outside of which, we are told, is of

These false eagles are suspected to be of Chinese manu-
facture. We should rather presume them to be French.
The French Eagles, it is certain, are very apt to carry
lead in their insides—in the shape of bullets.

ment had been made that "Tea is ready."
GOOD NEWS FROM NAPLES.
Francis the Second of Naples, by a slight variation of the words
which Shakspeare puts into the mouth of Henry V. of England, might
very nearly express the precise relation in which, as compared with his
late father, he stands towards the people who rejoice under his
paternal government. If he were to say that
"Amunith an Amuratb succeeds
And Bom ha Bohba,"
he would state almost the exact truth. Almost, not quite; for it is
rather less than the truth to say that, in point of wisdom, benevolence,
and justice, the present sovereign of Naples is on a par with his prede-
cessor,—Francis to Ferdinand bearing the ratio of Bomba to
Bomba. The son somewhat excels the sire in the moral qualities, and
exceeds him in the kind of conduct which procured the latter a
European reputation. For example, see the Steele, which says,—
"Wo have received letters from Naples which paint the situation in very gloomy
colours. M. Zir, so well known to travellers as the landlord of tho Hotel della
Victoria, and Mr. Gatti, an eminent Orientalist, have been taken into custody.
The police supposed some hieroglyphics which the latter possessed, to be seditious
emblems!"
Here we see how much sharper the instruments of the sublunary
assolulo padrone of the Neapolitans are than those that were used by
the one who was recently translated" to the skies. If the tools are the
same, they have at all events become much more acute in the hands of
their new master. We often hear of the wonderfully discerning senses
of certain Indians. The profound suspicion that Oriental hieroglyphics
were suspicious emblems, is remarkably like the .idea entertained by
some unsophisticated children of the wild, that the sketch which an
artist is making of their interesting persons is a device of magic. The
King of the Anthropophagi is probably waited on by guards and
attendants who, in respect of sagacity, are just upon a level with the
Police employed by the King of Naples. Like men, like masters:
Bomba and Hokey-Pokey-Wankey-Fum very much like one another,
especially Bomba.
The Steele proceeds:—
"A greongrooer of the Place Baracca has likewise been arrested, for having
,xhibitcd in his window, radishes, turnips, and lettuces, together, the colours of
which are those of the Italian flag,"
This intelligence, by leave of the Siecle, does not paint the situation
in very gloomy colours. The colours of the vegetables, for the combi-
nation of which in a costennonger's shop-window the Neapolitan Police
took the costermonger up, were a vivid red, a bright white, and a
brilliant green; all the most lively colours, and, constituting the
Italian tricolour, and exhibited where they were, strongly suggestive
to English apprehensions at least, of progress, as expressed in the
exclamation, Get on with your barrow!"
The next piece of news is still more cheering :—
*' The letters add, that a royal ordinance had been issued, directing that all civil
and military functionaries shall, in the course of the present mouth, be subjected
to some days' stoppages of pay, and that tho amount obtained thereby, shall be sent
to the Pope."
This is just as it should be. Whilst the Pope's subjects are shaking
the Pope's yoke off, and, with all the rest of Central Italy, voting them-
selves subjects to the King of Sardinia, the best thing that the
second and more amazing Bomba can possibly do is to mulct, not only
his civil servants, but also his soldiers, in order to subsidise the Roman
Pontiff. As Byron sings,—
11 Kill a man's family ond he may brook it,
But keep your hands out of his breeches pocket."
Just so, banish a man's relatives, imprison them, flog and torture
them, inflict upon them the most filthy and shameful indignities, and he
may tolerate, nay, if you fee, and natter, and pamper, himself per-
sonally, and he is a beast, he may even applaud your proceedings.
But rob your flunkey of his money, or stop his wages, in addition to
bastinadoing his father and mother and racking and thumbscrewing
his brothers and sisters, and he will kneel at your feet and lick them
only so long as he is afraid to rise. Then look out for an assault.
Especially is exasperation likely to be created by stoppage of hire in
the mind of the menial who wears that species of livery called uniform.
The King of Naples could not at this moment pursue any line of
policy more auspicious of the freedom and union of Italy, and more
hopeful for humanity, than that of disgusting and disobliging the Army
whose aid alone enables him to stay where he is, instead of coming to
reside in Leicester Square.

PUNCH, Oil THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A SHILLINGSWORTH OF CHARITY.
The loss of poor Mons. Jullien, the Mons who had for many
years so often been in labour for us, is a loss which we can none of us
expect to see replaced, and therefore none of us can be likely to forget.
M. Jullien was one of the few public entertainers of whom it could
be said that he was really entertaining. In whatever he attempted he
did his best to please, and in doing so, he was but seldom unsuccessful.
If we have ever laughed at him we ever have admired him, for the
reason that so many of his qualities were admirable. He was not
one of those who "keep the word of promise to the ear and break it to
the hope." His promises were always fulfilled in his performances,
and in whatever he might pledge himself he never broke faith with the
public. He never let his singers be "indisposed" to sing, nor did his
instrumentalists ever fail in keeping time"—in their appearance in
the orchestra.
As a composer, M. Jullien was well and widely known, and in his
peculiar walk not better known than trusted to. I)ance music was his
forte, and there are few piano-players who have not his music literally
at their fingers' ends. We should like to know the number of agree-
able flirtations to which his British Army Quadrilles have given birth;
while the marriages effected through his lovely Olga Waltz must have
occasioned a considerable effect upon the Census.
As caterer of concerts M. Jullien was unsparing both of person
and of purse, being as lavish of exertion as he was also of expense.
Indeed we think it may be said without untruth, that he mainly lost
his life through bis efforts as conductor, and his strong reluctance to
disappoint the public. Over-work and over-anxiousness to recover
his lost credit (a loss occasioned far more by misfortune than by fault)
brought on an affliction from which he never rallied: and his brain
first, then his body, gave way beneath the stroke.
By his death "his widow and family are left totally unprovided for."
This we state on the authority of men who know the fact, and who,
knowing it, have given it the attestation of their signatures, each
appended to a document called legally a cheque. They moreover have
put forth in the Times and other Papers:—
"An Appeal to the generosity of the British Public, to whose amusement*
MoNstccR Jullien has diligently and faithfully administered for upwards of twenty
yean."
And that this Appeal may universally, be read, we call the world's
attention to it in our world-pervading print. We moreover would
invite all those who can afford it to put their names down on the list
which is affixed to the Appeal, and hand their cheques and guineas to
the Treasurers of the fund.
But without stopping the charity of the guinea-paying public, may
we not appeal, too, to the shilling-paying public P M. Jullien has
done much for the shilling-paying public. M. Jullien has done more
vol. xxxvm.
THE "ENTENTE CORDIALE.'
We do not know whether this
celebrated Anglo-French "Cor-
diale" is likely to be affected much
by the remission of the duties on
French wines and spirits. That
measure being so extremely liberal,
we should think that the con-
sumption was likely to become
considerably greater. From the
quotations we have seen in the
French and English papers, there
seems to be a great improvement,
also, in the strength and purity of
this "Cordiale." Not only is it
stronger in spirit, but it is like-
wise freer from that slight tendency
to acidity, which, at the smallest
turn of politics, was apt to vitiate
all its good qualities, and to render
that which was intended to be sweet
and comforting to the taste of both
countries, extremely disagreeable,
and oftentimes offensive, to those,
no matter whether Englishmen or
Frenchmen, who happened to have
the "Cordiale" for the moment on
their lips. The exchange and inter-
change being now so much freer,
it is to be hoped that the "Entente
Cordiale" will not linger only
on the lips, but will soon reach
the hearts of both England and
France.
to popularise good music than any other popular purveyor of sweet
sounds. Until M. Jullien came to them, the shilling-paying public
had never heard good music; or at least, if they had heard it, they had
never rightly listened to it. A symphony was seldom played to them
"twenty years ago;" and. if played, was seldom heard without its
being hissed. But the public are not now such geese as they were
then. Thanks mainly to their Jullien, their hearing has improved,
and they can listen to good music without finding their ears bored by it.
We repeat, then, what we said. M. Jullien has done much for the
shilling-paying public. In return, will not that public do a little
for the family M. Jullien has left? A Shilling Subscription
List is opened, to swell in a small way the Jullien Fund for
their relief. Those who can't give more, need never be ashamed
of putting down their shilling; and the sum would in this instance
be most suitably appropriate. As pleaser of the public, it was to the ,
Shillingit.es that Jullien most appealed; and we may therefore for bis
family appeal fitly to the Shillingites. If every one in England to
whom "the Mons" has given a good shillingsworth of music were
now, in return to give a shilling to his memory, the Jullien Relief
Fund would be sensibly increased. And as the Shillingites in general
like to get their moneysworth, let every one who does so bear this fact
in mind, that a shillingsworth of charity is in truth a "Splendid
Shilling''a-vorth. I
An 111 Wind.
The breeze which has arisen in St. George's in the East is one of
those ill winds which blow no one any good. It arose from certain
persons giving themselves airs, and, as might have been supposed,
these airs soon led to blows. People make complaints about a Nor'-
Nor*-Easter as being the most aggravating wind that ever blows; but
in future, when we wish to speak of an ill wind, we shall say that it's
as bad as a St. George's-in-tne-Easter.

CHAPTER IX.—THE EARLY NORMAN PERIOD.
the brief interval between
the out-kicking of the
Danes and the incoming
of the Normans, the cos-
tume of the English, of
course, underwent some
change; for when was
fashion ever for a single
year immutable? Coming
events often throw their
shadows out before them;
and before the Normans
landed their shadows had
preceded them, and the
English in their habits had
aped them to a shade.

must be confessed that in

there was as much reason
for a similar complaint. Be-
fore the Frenchmen came

had invaded us, and we
were slaves to them in
fashion, although not yet
so in fact For this we
have the evidence of William op Malmesbury, who, contemptuous
of orthography, as is his lordly namesake, observes:—
"Inne Edwarde's rune y« Englifchcdyd Fronchlfyo ymselvos both inne mannoroa
and costumes, aud made ymHclvcs redickulouso bye tbeir phantaatick foshiones,
whiche they dyd wear a shortere tunick and eke a shavenuo cbyn, and dyd clippe
their hairo allsoe aa they dyd clippo their spcache."
That men should "make themselves ridiculous" by wearing shaven
chins, is an idea to which our beard-movers have lately given counte-
nance, albeit Englishmen in general have long set their face against it.
The early Normans were, however, great users of the razor; and
besides shaving their chins, and upper lips, and cheeks, they actually
shaved the back part of their heads; a fashion which they borrowed
from the swells of Aquitaine.
This we learn not only from
the Bayeux tapestry,* but
from an incident which hap-
pened on the landing of the
Normans, and which autho-
rities concur in thinking
proves the fact. It is said
that when King Harold
heard the cry "The French
are coming!" he prudently
remained at home, and sent
his spies to see if there were
truth in the report. As they
dared not face the enemy,
the spies crept crawlingly
along until they got behind
his back; and from this
rearward point of view they
took their observations, with
out themselves becoming the
objects of remark. They
then played among them-
selves a friendly game of
Hie, spy, hie! and, as Wal-
likgford informs us, "dyd
putte their bestte legges
foremoste, and dyd take un-1 oe their heeles." On coming to the king,
who was as breathless to heir the news as they were all to tell it, they
said they had seen no soldieis, but an army of priests: and on Harold
asking sternly, " What the [two of dice] they meant?" they told him

wife, Matilda, who was called from her great industry in working it, the Con-
queress, the enemy she triumphed over being truly worsted. How long she was
doing it, we must let our lady readers havo the privilege to guess. Although the
iact is not so stated, one might really almost think sho had the help of Briarous in
accomplishing her task; for one had need have the assistance of a hundred hauds,
to work so great a quantity as above two hundred foot.

of the way in which the Normans wore their hair, whereat his Majesty
impatiently exclaimed, "There, yon may cut it I"
In telling us this anecdote. Bob Wace, the Norman poet, uses the
expression "tout ret et tondu, which may be literally rendered by the
words "all shaven and shorn:" a phrase that, every baby knows,
occurs in one of the most ancient of our descriptive ballads. The
words, our readers may remember, are applied there to a priest; and
their usage may be taken as confirmatory evidence that the Normans
in their tonsure had a priestly cut about them. How far they resembled
the old ecclesiastic, who performed the marriage service in the ballad
we have mentioned, is a point which we suggest to men of strong
imaginations, as being a fit problem to exercise their thoughts. For
their assistance in the matter we refer them to the figures pictured in
the Bayeux tapestry, and to the portrait of the priest as he appears in
our edition; wherein the artist has depicted him in a dress which is a
cross between a beadle's and a bishop's. In this engraving (which we
fancy must be really very rare, for it appears to bear the thumb-marks
of several generations) y" maydenne all forlorne" is most lugubrious
in look, and seems to have been taken to what cockneys call the
"halter" as reluctantly as though she had been taken to be hung.
With an attention to the delails which smacks of the Dutch school,
the maid is represented with her milk-pail in her hand; while slightly
in the background is a portrait of her cow, whose horn is "crumpled
with a power which a Pra:-RaiTaclite might envy, and a Ruskin write
a page about in notes of admiration of its "conscientious handling"
and its "gigantic strength of truth."

THIS TRULY ISTF.HKST1NO PICTURE IS A VALUABLE ILLUSTRATION OP THE KCCLF.
SIA3TICAL AND CIVIL COSTUME OP THE MIDOLB OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY, on
The civil costume of the Normans (whom silly sticklers for good
grammar have called otherwise the Normen) consisted of a cloak, a
shirt, and a pair of drawers; together with a tunic which they wore
rather short, and a pair of stockings, which they wore rather long
One writer calls these stockings "panntaloons with feet to them;" and
we may guess from his so doing, that the nobles chiefly wore them, for
pantaloons have never been in favour much with clowns. Their
Norman name was "chausses," and we are not aware of their having
any other: although seeing that the English took afterwards to
wearing them, it is naturally likely that they Anglicised the name.
But whether, with true British contempt for foreign accents, they
called the chaussds "chosses," or "chawsers" or chowses," witii
all our wisdom we must own ourselves unable to decide.
To keep their heads warm, which considering how they shaved them,
was much needed, the civilians wore a flat round cap resembling n
Scotch bonnet. This, however, was not their invariable head-dress,
for they sometimes wore a hood, or coif, to serve as their coiffure.
Combined with their bald-patedness, these monks-hoods must have
given them a clerical appearance, and the way they aped the priests
was really moukish, if not monkeyish.
For their chaussure they wore shoes, over their chausxSs. But some-
times their long stockings were stuck into short boots, which for aught
we know, resembled our plebeian highlow. These short boots have
been long familiar to our memory, from the fact that we remember
reading when at school (having recently refreshed our remembrance
on the matter) that Robert, Duke of Normandy, the Conqueror's
eldest son, was nicknamed Gambaron, or "Shortshanks," aud Court-
hose, which meant "Short-boots." His namesake, Robert Wace,
says, "he hadde shorte legges and large bones, hence was he booteddo
with shorte hosen and hadde shorte boottes to bootte." To our mind

there is nothing very funny in these nicknames; but we mention them
to show that our ancestors at times were just as rude as their des-
cendants, in their remarks
on people's personal disfi-
gurements and dress.
The phrase "Loot I cd with
shorte hosen" might lead
one to suppose that the Nor-
mans wore no stockings un-
derneath their chaussea, and
that they thrust their ten
toes naked into their boots.
This, however, we are not at
liberty to guess; for stock-
ings, we have seen, were in
use among the Saxons, and
the Normans, who were more
refined, must certainly have
wom them. Indeed several
quotations might easily be
made which would serve to
satisfy the reader of the fact;
but reading much bad spelling
is a thing to be avoided, as it
may lead to imitation, per-
chance, of its defects.
Taking it for granted, then,
that they wore stockings,
there remain to be considered
two most momentous ques-
tions; namely, whether or no
they commonly wore garters
with their stockings, and
whether, if they did, they gartered under or above the knee. Antiqua-
rians have been long in the dark upon these points; but we rejoice
that our exhaust less industry and patience at length enable us to
throw a flood of light upon the subject, and to dissipate the clouds of
doubt which have obscured it.
By our almost superhuman labour of research, we have brought to
view a MS., which, so far as we can see, has never before been even
heard of, and which must excite the wonder and delight of the sarunts.
Since we are never prone to keep our good things to ourselves, as is
proved by the weekly publication of our jokes, we have now the
greatest willingness in parting with our property, and putting before
the public that which has been hitherto a quite private possession.
The manuscript appears to have been written by a lawyer, at least we
Ige so, partly from its being writ in rhyme (for all our poets nearly

! begun by being lawyers), and partly from the almost"undecipher-
able penmanship, which is a failing common to most men in that pro-
fession. Our conjecture too is strengthened by the MS. being written
in bad Anglo-Norman French, in which our ancient legal documents
were commonly composed. But not to keep our readers longer from
their treat, be it known to all men that, so far as our compositor is
able to make out, he holds himself in readiness to make an affidavit
that what is here subjoined, is a true copy of the lines :—•
"©uanS jt quittais la jftarmamlir,
3t more mart garttre sur man hnrt:
Et quant) jt Englismans became,
3t mis contrntt a fairt It samt."
WHITE MICE AT THE TQILERIES.
Foe the annexation of Savoy to France, the best reason that can be
assigned is, that the language of the Savoyards is, in a great measure,
French. If the Savoyard deputies, who waited the other day on the
Emperor, to implore him to eat them and the other roast pigs, their
fellow-citizens, represent the latter in their way of squeaking, the
people of Savoy certainly do talk like thorough Frenchmen.
For example:—
"Sire,—So many natural bonds, so many glorious reminiscences unite Savoy to
France, that she trembled with happiness when the auguBt word of your Majesty
gave the hope to our country that she was about to be called to make part of the
great French family with the assent of its legitimate Sovereign."
Trembled with happiness !—how false! how bombastic! how
fulsome! Can there be a doubt that creatures who are capable of
this slaver are unfit to remain subjects of Victor Emmanuel, and
that they tend to servitude by a natural impulse.
Their address to the Empress affords still stronger proof of their
essentially French disposition. What can exceed the peculiar polite-
i of the following specimen of adulation:—
We cannot conceive anybody worthy to be called an Englishman
voluntarily renouncing his Queen, and offering himself to become the
subject of any other sovereign. But some Englishmen are unworthy
of their name; an English traitor is a conceivable monster. Yet even
the basest and most degraded Briton would never, in throwing himself
at the feet of another lady than Her Majesty, have the face to say,
"England is an affectionate land, Madame; it loves its Princes." The
idea of being spurned by the foot that he was licking, would deter him
from the utterance of such a piece of impudent servility. He would
be conscious of the self-irony of his language. That is just what the
Savoyard deputies were unconscious of; and such unconsciousness is
eminently French. Therefore, they unblushingly tell Eugenie that
"Savoy loves its Princes ;" and then they proceed:—
"How could it fail not dearly to love you, endowed with so much graco and
virtuo?"
How did these gentlemen fail to love the Kino of Sardinia P Oh!
they have not failed to love him; they only forsake him. So they will
never fail to love their new mistress; and they tell her—how prettily
and affectionately!—
"Savoy hopes that you will also love it and that you will soon give a precious
proof thereof by showing yourself amoug us.'
These people were clearly born to kiss hands. Stooping, no doubt,
with appropriate action, they now thus address the infant Prince
Imperial:—
41 And you, Monseigneur, you who are destined to continue so much greatness*
our children will be as devoted to you as we are to the Emperor, your glorious
father. As soon as we return to our mountains we will mr'
shout ol ' Vive I'Smperevr :' ' Vive le Prince Imperial t'
make them ring with the
Dishonoured mountains! The insensibility of these men to the
absurdity of the above pompous apostrophe to a small boy is also
perfectly national; that is perfectly consonant with French ideas. The
grossness of their cringing to the Imperial great man is paralleled by
the ridiculousness of their fawning on the Imperial little man. We
are familiar with this style of demeanour as exhibited, in begging, by
dirty fellows in high-crowned hats, with white mice and a hurdy-gurdy.
Some of these truly crawling creatures appear to have taken their mice
and music to the ."

* Madame,—Will your Majesty allow those who will soon be your new subjects
to express to you, on this day, so momentous for them, all the sentiments that
a t Savoy is an affectionate land, Madame; It lores its Princes."
A Bun for the Reform Bill,
Lord John Russell, the other evening, ran into the House of
Commons, with a train of supporters at his heels, just in time to seoure
the discussion of his Reform Bill by saving the House from being
counted out. The noble Lord on that occasion may consider himself
to have had a run of good luck.

With unwearied hand propelling
Thy perambulator still,
With paternal raptures swelling—
Poor little Bill!
Through each danger he will steer thee,
Deaf to prophecies of ill.

Poor little Bill!
Let them dwell upon thy weakness.
Damn with praises faint and chill,

Poor little BUI!
From all critics ask suggestion,
Strength into thee to instil:
Bare thy meagre frame to question—
Poor little Bill!
Cut thee, carve thee, stuff or starve thee;
Lop thee, crop thee—all but kill;
Like a corpus vile sarve thee—
Poor little Bill!
So he '11 carry through his darling,
Spite of all that threatens ill,
Scorn of friends and foemen's snarling—
Poor little BUI!
HIGH WATER AND LOW WIT.
Our readers are aware, if they have read the papers, that there was
a remarkably high tide in the Thames the other day. Among the
damages it did, it occasioned some small injury to the Royal property,
that is to say, it caused sad havoc to be made with the Queen s
English. A wit in Lambeth said that there was quite a run upon the
banks, and avowed his expectation that one of them would break;
whereat a byestander remarked, that if such should prove the case, he
should wish great Father Thames were a little farther off, or he for one
might not be able to keep his head above water. A wag at Chelsea
took a simUar advantage of the circumstance by observing that his
Highness (meaning Father Thames) was not half so high then as he
would be in the summer-time; and this remark was capped by another
funny fellow, who, clapping his right forefinger against his nasal organ,
exclaimed, with exquisite facetiousness, "Ah! that's true encugh,
I nose it!" A climax to the comicality was, however, put by a pun-
ster, who was waiting on the steam-boat pier at Westminster, and who
observed that Father Thames, who was usually so untidy, was cutting
quite a swell, for the high tide made the river look quite tidy to the
eye, in fact, he might remark that Father Thames looked quite eye-tidy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.

THE FROLICS OF FASHION.
T all accounts the ladies
are growing very flori-
cultural. Lovely woman
has often been compared
to roses, and tulips, and
violets,and other flowery
emblems, not omitting
"the pink of perfec-
tion;" but we little
suspected that she would
become so closely asso-
ciated with the beautiful
objects that adorn the
plate-glass shops in
Oovent Garden Market,
that it would be a matter
of impossibility to say
where the flowers began,
or the woman ended.
The object of the pre-
sent fashion seems to
be to identify the one
with the other in inse-
parable harmony toge-
ther, so that the two
shall form but one large
fleur animee, as graceful
as any that ever blossomed into life under Granville's poetic pencil. Here is a
specimen of this new animated flower, that we have culled from one of the
numerous fashion-books that idly urofess to teach womeD the difficult art of making
themselves more beautiful:—
"One dress we will describe. It was composed of white tulle bouilUmnie. At the lover part of
the skirt it had three skirts of double tulle, each caught up by ribbons of white taffeta*, embrolderod
with bouquet* of flowers, producing a freah aud charming effect. Hint bouquet* of flowera wero
placed at the end of these ribbons, no two alike. The body was in the tame style a* the tkirt. Upon
each shoulder a bouquet of flowers formed an fpaulette."
An epaulette of flowers is a sweet notion! Was the sash, pray, of the same
material? But what a walking bouquet, the lady attired as above, must have
been. Her dress must have been a kind of Floral Hall, of which she herself was
the centre ornament and grand illumination. The only parallel we know to it is
the Jack-in-the-Green on the three glorious days of May; but he is a companion
too dark to be placed by the side of such a cluster of bright colours and fragrant
associations. Four skirts and eleven bouquet) of flowers, at least (for in this cal-
culation the lower tier of bouquets is not included) are not bad for one dress. We
doubt if the goddess Flora herself would have had more, when she went in state to
ODe of her grand flower-shows. Why, each waltz must have been a shower of
roses!
But the ladies are growing horticultural, also. Their dress is so attractively
arranged as to appeal to every sense. Here is another description, that quite
brings the water into one's mouth:—
"Anothor was also made of white tuUe, with eleven small flounces, bordered with a purple
ribbon, embroidered with gold. At each breadth the flounces were put on in festoons. Over this
was placed a white crapo skirt. Wide purple ribbon, embroidered ha flowers of gold, twisted
like a scarf, and held at the hip* by a bouquet of pomegranate*. The wreath for the hair was formed
of pomegranates and rings of gold."
With cherries on her lips, a peach on each cheek, and pomegranates round her
hair, such a fruitful combination is enough to make a vegetarian even pay his
devoirs to one so tempting!
But a lady does not draw all her brightness from the earth—she can be celestial
as welL We put before the non-credulous reader a glittering proof of it :—
"Another of these elegant dresses was made of azure tulle—all bouillannie—with stars of gold
worked on the tuUe, These were not all of one size, but varied, like thoee of the planetary system."
Thus, a lady is alike floricultural, horticultural, and astronomical. Both heaven
and earth send their choicest contributions to adorn her. What the joint effect
could be, we should be afraid to contemplate. We lean ungallantly to the vulgar
belief, that probably we should admire ner more with a smaller quantity of flowers
and fruits and stars about her. We should like a little more of Nature and con-
siderably less of Art. Fearless of competition, why does not Lovely Woman trust
to her own charms?
We shall leave off with the above compliment, for fear of saying anything rude
that might spoil the effect of it. Otherwise, we were about to notice in the
above descriptions the singular absence of jewellery, only we reflected in time,
that no lady ever thinks now-a-days of wearing jewellery, unless it is occasionally
two or three hundred diamonds, with the view of imitating the effect of "the
planetary system." Who is to blame her, unless it be some one who does not

LOUIS NAPOLEON CONSULTS THE GREAT
POWERS.
What! France take Savoy P
To Europe's annoy,
And in open detianoe of treaties,
Not to say protestations
In last year s proclamations—
(One's own words most unpleasant to eat 'tis.)
I should cry "culpa mea,"
If such an idea
Had e'er to my mind found an entry:
Though 'tis perfectly true,
My dear Powers, that for you,
I feel on the Alps I stand sentry.
So with your approbation,
And consent of the nation,
Perhaps you will make no objection,
Should Savoy and Nice
(To keep Europe at peace)
Flaoe themselves 'neath our Eagles' protection P
N. B. I may mention,
Should it be your intention,
To raise any hitch in the matter,
That Kino Victor and I
Made it all cut and dry—
May or June last—(I think 'twas the latter).
If you'll do me the favour
To approve my behaviour,
I shall highly respect your opinions;
If you won't, I n most sorry:
But for this territory,
It's now part of th' Imperial dominions.
A DISAGREEABLE WIPE.
Mr. Whitworth's three-pounder cleaus itself out. One of the many objec-
tions to Lord John's six-pounder is, that it is very likely to lead to the use of
the sponge.
MODERN FRENCH SLIPSLOP.
French diplomatic slang is becoming a great nuisance.
Who can read the subjoined specimen of this modern slip-
slop without irritation P It comes in the shape of a tele-
gram from Paris, referring to an article by M. Grand-
guillot in the Constitutionnel, on "Universal Suffrage and
Public Order in Europe." VVe are told that—
"M. Orandoqillot thinks it necessary to oxplaln the limits of the
doctrine or national sovereignty now invoked against the imperial
policy to the advantage of curtAtn combinations whiuh his Majosty
cannot protest against, although prepared without his inspirations."
What M. Grandguillot thinks it necessary to explain,
he states with a degree of perspicuity which correspond^
exactly to the clearness of mud. What sense is to be made
of "the doctrine of national sovereignty," or any other
doctrine, "invoked against the imperial policy to the
advantage of certain combinations P Is not this jumble
of abstract expressions worse than any metaphysics, even
than such metaphysics as philosophers talk when they are
drunk? And then what is meant by combinations pre-
pared" without the inspirations of Louis Napoleon P
By his "inspirations" we suppose we are to understand
his suggestions, or his hints; but why use the word inspi-
rations instead of the plainer termP The Emperor op
the French is said to patronise spiritual manifestations,
but he is not a spirit himself; at the best he could possibly
be no better than a medium, and cannot, with any propriety,
be said to inspire people in preparing combinations.
There is also a vile French word which has come into
common use—the word prestige. In its proper and original
sense, it is a legitimate word enough; the meaning which
it has acquired is what renders it base and offensive. Em-
ployed to signify magical illusion or jugglery, it is a correct
expression, but it is a most unhappy one when substituted,
as it now is, for credit or renown. Attributed, lor instance,
to a nation, an army, or an individual, it means imposing
reputation; a charaoter for good fortune, power, invincibi-
lity, greatness, knowledge, or wisdom, magnified by people's
imagination; a celebrity in which there is something of
humbug. The French, if they please, may describe the
influence which they exercise in any respect as prestige;
but let us not borrow from them a term which is most cor-
rectly applicable to the impostures of a charlatan, to denote
the greatness of England, li they like to impute prestige
to their Emperor let them; but let the British public,
sticking to propriety, purity, and honest nomenclature,
ascribe reputation to Punch.

THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE BOAT RACE.
The approaching contest on the river between the two
Universities is creating a great amount of interest, not
alone on the tapis of Belgravia, but also at the taps of
the waterside public-houses. We hope that the Cambridge
men will be more fortunate than they were upon the last
occasion. It must be exceedingly unpleasant to bid "fare-
well to one's trim-built wherry," by so summary (or rather
wintry) an ejectment, and to go to the bed of the river
with such a dip. We trust that the gallant Commanders
of the vessels of the Thames Steam Navy will keep a
respectful distauce, and not disturb the gallant competitors
by the intrusion of heavy swells. The Derby at Epsom has
been called the " Blue Ribbon of the Turf," but when we
consider the colours of our Universities, may we not call
the prize of honour, on this occasion, the Blue Ribbon of
the Iliver P At all events, whatever be the issue of the
race, we hope that the Cantabs may not again

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
March 19. Monday. Lord Lyndhurst, unceasing in his desire to
improve as much as possible the Court of Probates and Reprobates, so
ably presided over by Sir Chesswell Cresswell, proposed to give
that learned Judge power to decide single-banded. He urged, that if
one. Judge was permitted to tie the judicial noose, one Judge might be
trusted to untie the matrimonial knot. Lord Campbell promised to
introduce a Bill for thus facilitating business. He did so on the
Friday, like a faithful Brick. Lord Teynham then moved a resolution
in favour of the Ballot. He could hardly have astonished or amused
their Lordships more if he had proposed that Mr. Saters and Mr.
Heenan should fight their battle on the floor of the House of Lords,
with a Primate apiece as bottle-holder. The Duke op Newcastle
expressed the disgust of their Lordships; and on division, there were
going to be 5 for the Ballot to 39 against it, but Lord Derby tried to
take away three of the five votes by noticing that certain Peers were
not actually in the House when the resolution was put. However, he
only wiped off one, and Lord Teynham mustered his four—namely,
Lord Benjamin Hall Llanover, Lord Strutt Belper, Lord
Strappord (whose head was cut off for his being too aristocratic some
years ago; and it is well to see that he has profited by the hint), and
himself.
Lord John Russell pleaded, that it would embarrass him very much
if he were pressed with questions about Savoy, which, all things con-
sidered, the House thought probable, so went on with the Second
Reading of the Reform Bill. Mr. Disraeli objected very strongly to
adding 200,000 electors, all of one class, and that not an educated class,
to the present 440,000; and he contended that the late Strike was
evidence that the class in question was formidable at once from igno-
rance and from organisation. A sort of sandwich debate followed,
with alternate slices of Liberal bread and Conservative meat, and a
slight dash of Radical mustard; but there was nothing to immortalise
until Mr. Bright rose to defend the Bill as the fulfilment of a pledge.
He thought that the lower classes ought to be enfranchised in far
larger numbers, but took the measure as an instalment. The Debate
was adjourned till Thursday. General Peel then made a speech to
show that Government had not asked for nearly enough money for the
Chinese expedition; and Mr. Sidney Herbert made a speech to show
that they had asked for exact ly the right amount. Then Sir Michael
Seymour apprised that House that Mr. Ward, the American Envoy
to China, was aggrieved at the statements that the Chinese had shut
him up in a box, and Mr. Ward reported that he had been treated
very satisfactorily. Mr. Punch has no reason to doubt it. He himself
has considered his treatment in the highest degree satisfactory when
he has been shut up in a box,—the idol of his affections aud the star of
his soul being also there, reposing her ivory arm upon the velvet, and
alternately listening, enraptured, to Mario's vocalism and to Mr. P.'i
adoration.
Tuesday. Lord Derby's demand when he was to have his Easter
holidays, to which schoolboyish inquiry he very properly got no
reply, was the only thing worth notice Up-stairs. Down-stairs, Mb,
Henry Berkeley, encouraged by Lord Teynham's brilliant exploit,
asked leave to bring in a Bill for establishing the Ballot. He let off
his usual fun, but on one point—the working of the system in Australia
—he caught what his brother, now blundering in America, would call
a punch on the head. Mr. Marsh, late from Australia (wherever
that is), asserted that the ballot produced great evils there. Mr.
Chichester Fortescue announced that he had been for the ballot,
but had meditated on the subject and changed his mind. Mere round
balls are not now arguments, as in the idiotic times when a man would
go out after Ranelagh, or Vauxhall, and expiate a folly by a crime, as
our friend Electus, whose Empire is Peace, permits people to do in
his country. Lord Palmerston, apologising to the House for keep-
ing Members from their dinners, made some fun of Mr. Berkeley, and
hoped that when he died a Ballot-Box would be erected in his honour,
and on division the Bristol Pet was floored by 254 to 147; the latter,
being a much smaller following of backers than has been usual with
this Boxer.
Wednesday. Mr. Dillwyn, not satisfied with the way the House of
Lords is redressing the grievances of Dissenters in reference to
Endowed Schools, moved the second reading of a very sweeping Bill
on the subject. He was demolished by Mr. Lowe, who pulled the

135
Bill to pieces, and shoved that it was ingeniously and happily contrived
to damage at once both Dissenters and Churchmen. The House
affirmed the Lowe Church view by 190 to 120. We are happy to add
that a Bill for relieving the unhappy children who are slowly tortured
in the Bleaching Works, was carried by an enormous majority, though
resisted by Mr. Turner of Manchester, a favourer of "progressive
improvements" and "religious liberty" (vide Dod). An impulsive
speech by Mr. Roebuck aided the promoters of the Bill, and the cause
of oppressed children is surely one in which impulsiveness may be per-
mitted, however unsenatorial.
"Hearts are not flint, and flints are rent;
Hearts are not steel, and steel is bent."
Thursday. Lord Tbtnham made another campaign, with even more
signal failure. He took charge of a Bill which had passed the Com-
mons, and which was to complete the relief given to Dissenters by the
Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. Mr. Punch regrets that the
measure was not in stronger hands, for it was assailed by a couple of
leading Tories and a Bishop, and smashed by 44 to 23. Mr. Punch
yields to no charity-boy behind pewter in abject reverence for the
smallest button belonging to even a beadle of the Church, but he never
could see that Swearing was a protection to anything except a cat's
dinner. He agrees with Lord Campbell, that he should like to see
all oaths forbidden, except the oath of allegiance, and perhaps, the oath
of impatience when the vast crowd in Fleet Street on Mr. Punch's
publish ing day (Wednesday), prevents an ardent Edwin from getting
hold of the new Number in time to save the train that should take
him, Punch in hand, to his expectant Angelina.
The Reform Debate was adjourned, and the Bill had the very
narrowest of squeaks for dear life. Sir John Pakington had
attacked it. and called it a " miserable" Bill. He strongly complained
(Mr. Punch concurring) that lodgers were excluded from the fraochise.
Sir George Gret had defended it, and urged that what were called
fancy franchises were liable to collusion and fraud. So are the Queen's
coins, and fraud very often forges imitations of them, which collusion
passes, but is that any reason for shutting up the Mint? But then Mr,
Adderlet got up, and the House went away, and at a certain moment
there were only about twenty Members, and somebody dashed at a
Count. Lord John Russell himself had to hurry back to his place
and be counted, and if he and some others had not done so, the Reform
Bill would have been like a piece of paper sometimes picked up in the
hall of a theatre, namely, a Dropped Order. "That, said the indig-
nant Adderlet, "shows how the country is represented." However
the catastrophe was averted, and Mr. Adderlet scolded Mr. Bright
a good deal. The only other very noticeable speech was that of the
fiery Whiteside, who devoted himself to arguments to show that the
Bill would let in such organisation as that of the Strike to damage all
the interests of the nation. The Opposition, however, did not venture
to move an amendment on the second reading. The debate again
stood over until the next Monday.
Friday. There was a short debate Up-stairs about the intentions of
Government as to modifying the Promotion by Purchase System. They
seem to have frightened Lord Panmure, but the most remarkable
speech was made by the remarkable Ltjcan, who implored Government
not to 50 reforming the Army; for though foreign officers might be
more scientific than ours, no officers were more brave and loyal tlian
those of England. Why, who denies either proposition f Our officers,
generally speaking, are gloriously brave and loyal, and we are certain
that the foolish Lucan himself would dash himself and his men against
any wall of stone or steel in the world, if ordered to do so by his
Commander. But it is precisely the scientific fellows, and not the
Lucans, that we want, as our officers and men are much too precious
articles to be wasted in obedience to the orders of unscientific parties.
Lord Cardigan did not rise to castigate his brother-in-law, and
probably they agreed upon Ldcan's view of the case, as that view was a
blunder. The Duke of Somerset had the pleasure of slashing at Lord
Panmure, and did it with gusto. Earl Gret took the cranky line,
as usual. The Duke op Cambridge said, frankly enough, thnt the
Lords knew his opinions, but that he would try with all his might to
carry out, for the benefit of the Army, whatever system might be
decided on. By the way, the world must really be at an end. Our
Commander-in-Chief has been going and dining with Baron Lionel
de Kothschild. What are Spooner and Newdegate about, and
where is the motion for an address to deprive George of his command?
Are we all asleep P Echo answers in the affirmative.
After a squabble whether the Norwich writ should or should not be
issued, and a decision that it should, Colonel Stkes protested against
Mr. James Wilson's plan for reducing our Indian expenses by putting
down our native Indian army. Then came another squabble about
Savoy, on which Ministers are horribly unwilling that there should be
much discussion. And then, the payers of Income-Tax will be happy to
learn that their turn came. The extra Penny was debated. Among other
wise speeches, Mr. Slanet, who is so sentimentally eager to lighten
some folks' burdens that he brings before Parliament the question
whether ledges and rests should not be stuck up in the streets for the
comfort of porters, described the Income-Tax as most "fair, politic,
and just." (Who is that saying that Slaney rhymes to Zany ?) There
was a debate, but Mr. Gladstone was triumphant, and 187 to 132
affirmed the principle of a Ten-Penny Iucome-Tax.
"We 're lucky Old Engiandors, bless us,
We hadn't enough to distress us.
But Ten-Fenny Tacks
Must run into our backs.
And stick, like the shirt of old Nessus."
ODIOUS COMPARISONS.

he Correspondence of Alex-
ander von Humboldt
lately published, contains
in a letter from Prince
Albert acknowledging the
receipt of Humboldt's
Koxmos the following bene-
diction :—
"May Heaven, 'whose circling
seas of light and star-terraces'
you so nobly describe, preserve
you still for many years, to your
country, the world, and the Kos-
mos itself, in undisturbed fresh-
ness both of body and soul. This
is the sincere wish of your entirely
devoted, Albert."
On this passage, which
includes the intimated
quotation of a bit of fine
writing from the Koimot,
Humboldt, bilious appa-
rently, thus comments in an
epistle to his friend Varn-
hagen. The
complains:—
Prince, he
"Makes me speak of 'circling
seas of light and star-terraces'—
a Co burg variation from my text, and quite Snglith from Windsor, where there are nothing but Terraca."
The expression which Humboldt had really used in the Komot was "star-carpet," and
he was vexed with the Prince Consort for altering it into "star-terraces." Surely, the
philosopher was rather unreasonably offended with the princely variation of his poetry. If
any comparison of an earthly object to the sky can be meaner than that of a terrace, it is that
of a carpet. Both metaphors are of the same order as the word "livery" used for foliage.
The two are much of a muchness, and had the
authors of each simile respectively offered them
in competition for a pastoral prize, the decision
of discerning Arcadian umpires might have
been—
"An oaken staff each merits for his pains.''
We must, however, stand up for our Prince;
and we will say that, in that case, we think the
handsomer and lighter stick of the two should
have been given to his Royal Highness.
A Triple Hatful of Money.
His Holiness the Pope appears to be making
a good thing out of the tribulation with which
his paternal heart has been afflicted. In a letter
writ ten to Mr. Cullen, the titular Archbishop
of Dublin, the Holy Father says, " It is our wish
that you should return in our name, and in the
warmest terms, our sincere thanks to your
faithful clergy and people for the third sum of
£1,000 which they nave offered to me through
you." The successor of St. Peter may lose
Peter's patrimony; but the loss appears likely
to be more than made up to him in Peter's
pence.

You, of lives that should be saviour, think to fight another gent!
Trigger for your hand to pull it 'gainst your fellow ne'er was made;

To a brace of pistols lying on the table pointed he,

A GOOD GOTH WANTED.
What queer people there aTe in life! This is not a new reflection; but, plaguing
although it be, when one takes the Times up, one can hardly avoid making it.
Who are the odd people who advertise their wants, and who the odder people are
by whom those wants are ministered, are questions we despair of ever seeing

of what strange requirements are announced, and what curious people are, invited

Rooms, 154, Leadenhall Street.
We thought we had heard long since of the Last of the Goths, but it seems we
were mistaken. There are some of them still extant. Whether this advertise-
ment will bring them from their hiding-places, and what tests will be tried to
prove they are first-rate," are points on which our readers, if they please, may
speculate; but we, who never speculate, cannot lend them any help. We only
hope that the "designs" for which a Goth's aid is required are not designs on
John Bull's pocket for some temporary trumpery, which, like the Monster Statue,
is sure to become permanent. We are inclined to frame this hope from the
knowledge of what Goths our public architects have been, and the fear lest some
new pepper-box calamity befal us.

supposed good conduct of their friend L. N., Mr. P. will
not trouble Mrs. B. to send him over the Postscript which
he knows that, on becoming acquainted with the truth, she
must be composing. He has done it himself, for her, and
hastens to publish it.

Stop! Ho! I bar!
I've been going a little too fast,
I thought the Imperial Star
Was blazing too brightly to last,
And now it goes out With a smell.
What, does that Sworder of Edom
Come driving a piece of trade,
And selling Italian freedom
By the yard instead of the blade?
Hanging at France's waist
The sun-red tops of my Alps,
As a savage's girdle is graced
By a row of his crimson scalps.
Ah me! Well, well!
Must I then rank him, perforce, a cur,
Him I had deemed a brave hound;
And in the rich blood of Corsica
Still must the puddle be found?
Marching his soldiers come. Such is
Terrible end of my hopes,
After enfranchising Duchies,
Scaring the Last of the Popes,
Now he goes stealing the Slopes.

Ay! I beg to retract
All I've said in his vaunt,
I wasn't aware of the fact
With which the Governments taunt
The Nephew of Him of the Rock.
And I own I did not remember,
Mid Italy's joy and halloo,
That second grim day of December,
Stamping him eminent Do.
Nor the oaths that he trampled through:
Trampled with feet that grew redder
With Mars's murderous sign,
Like the foot of the vintage t reader
When grapes are bleeding to wine.
I retract it, every line.

Ye have right, I affirm, to be scowling,

That mystic and Sphynxlike talker,
He ought to be jolly well hided
For his vows that have turned out Walker.

You '11 see half a million of bayonets:

The old French cry of "II n'y a plus de Pyrenies" was
true only for a short time. Louis Napoleon might by
his present occupation of Savoy, cry out with almost equal
justice, "// n'y a plus d"Alpes," but how long will the
cry last f As the Pyrenees are still in existence, let us
hope that the Alps will soon rise to a sense of their present
degraded position, and regain the proud eminence they
have hitherto maintained in Europe.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
of yelp and bray. Afraid to speak in the terms which
they felt most befitting the subject, were the anonymous
maligners who composed that stupid abuse of a judicious
prelate? Afraid to speak their mind, were they, lest they
should appear to "overstep the bounds of proprietyP"
On which side of the bounds of propriety do they imagine
themselves to stand, in accusing the Bishop of London of
authorising an act of desecration? What do they call
such language as that? A respectable jury would call it
libellous. The Bishop op London would have a good
round of action against his virulent detractors if he could
iscover their names—those which are appended to the
document are of course fictitious. He might not, to be
sure, get a verdict, because the jury might not be respect-
able, and twelve fools in a box, though they might, award
a dirty quack, or a puffing humbug, heavy damages for the
exposure inflicted on him by an honest journalist, would
very probably refuse justice to an exemplary bishop,
defamed by scurrilous fellows. As they would be actuated
by sympathy with the quack and the puffer, so they would
be influenced by antipathy to the prelate, he being a gentle-
man. Moreover, the jury might contain some papists,
who would really consider desecration involved in any act
implying negation of the sacrosanctity of the symbols,
wooden or textile, which are adored or venerated by
themselves and their apes of St. George's-in-the-East.
LIBEL ON THE BISHOP OF LONDON.
he other day, which, it
may. be necessary to
state, was the 30th
of March, because
perhaps some people
will suppose it to have
been the 1st of April,
there appeared in a
daily contemporary a
paragraph headed, The
Durham Clergy and the
Bishop of London, and
comprising a declara-
tion to which those
reverend gentlemen are
alleged to have busied
themselves in obtaining
clerical signatures; the
manifesto, which re-
lates to the riots at St.
George's - in - the - East,
concluding with the
following piece of im-
pertinence :—
"Of a more recent act
of aggression purporting to
be perpetrated with tho
express sanction of the bishop (but this we can scarcely credit) we dare not speak in the terms
which we feet most befitting the subject, lest we should appear to overstep the bounds of pro-
priety. We are most anxious to uphold and maintain the respect and reverence due to the office
of a spiritual father, but we cannot forbear the expression of our unfeigned regret and surprise
that. In the exercise of his orBoe, the Bishop of London should have authorised an act of dese-
cration in removing from the church, in deference to a godloss clamour, such ecclesiastical
ornameuts and symbols as are sanctioned as well by the canons ol the Church as by tho
decisions of the highest courts of law."
Represented as emanating from the Durham clergy, this insolent and officious
censure of the Bishop op London must be a hoax. Those reverend men are
neither curs nor jackasses, and the foregoing vituperation is, as it were, a mixture

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PAKLIAMENT.
March 26, Monday. It is not impossible that the very important
i debate of this day (already a day memorable to the universe for all
time to come, being the birthday of the Duke op Cambridge) may be
referred to hereafter, when the relations between certain Powers are
not so sweetly amicable as at present. Lord John Russell, Foreign
Secretary, had, hitherto, as Mr. Punch hath recorded, rather objected
to being talked to on the subject of Savoy. But as the esteemed
Classics remark, Be quibus certus es, loauere opportune, and Lord John,
being now perfectly certain as to the intentions of our friend Electus,
did speak out with manful utterance touching that potentate. Replying
to Mr. Hoksman, who delivered a fierce Philippic (fillip, as the
Wiscount pronounces it) against Louis Napoleon, and denounced
him as a Deceiver, Insolent, and Perfidious (Horsman's constituents
have been sitting upon him and resolving that he is not representing
them) Lord John Russell declined to adopt that sort of language.
{ but used some of his own, which, coming from a gentleman of habitual
I moderation and self-respect, and from a Minister of England's and
i Mr. Punch's Queen, descended like a thunderbolt upon the Spoiler of
the Slopes. Lord John said, that in July and in January, he had
warned the Emperor op the French, that if he began with one act
of aggression, his subjects, who were of a "warlike" character, would
call on him to commit other unrighteous acts, and that now that the
Savoy business had been perpetrated, it was impossible to regard
Electus in the way we had endeavoured to do. We must keep on
good terms with other strong nations, and be prepared "if future
occasion should arise — and it might arise"— to unite with those
nations, and declare that the settlement and peace of Europe should
not be disturbed. So spoke John Russell, and the cheers that
rang loud from the Liberal benches were as loudly echoed by the Con-
servatives, for utterance had at last been given to the sentiments of
England and of Mr. Punch.
Lord John Manners said, that the Foreign Minister's words would
vibrate from one end of England to the other. Mr. Bright, of course,
protested against them, called Savoy politically worthless, and thought
that we had nothing to do with the question. He introduced a pleasant
reference to the Morning Advertiser, which has been writing strongly
against L. N., and said that the paper hi question was notorious for
an unequalled mixture of piety and ruffianism. (The editor's just fury,
next day, foamed over like a pot of porter with a splendid head to it.)
Lord Claude Hamilton expressed Tory pleasure that we were likely
to become better friends with the despotic powers. Mr. King lake

described Mr. Bright as a "man" who believed in nobody but him-
self, and had no good grounds for that faith. And then the discussion
ended; but its echoes are rolling over Europe. Touching the present
views of the other powers, it may be convenient to remark that, I
according to Lord John, they may be said to be eminently Sulky.
Austria will not stir, and says that the annexing Savoy to France is
no worse than the annexing Tuscany to Sardinia. Russia takes the
high Anointed tone, and says that a King has a perfect right to give
away, and another King to accept, a province; but both at Berlin and
Vienna there seems a feeling that Switzerland is being placed in a false
position. There is a small piece of land, bounded on one side by
France, and on the other by Holland and Prussia; and we get a great
many rabbits from it. One of these days we may have to consider
whether the rabbits would not be just as good if they were French
subjects. If we decide that we do not care whose rabbits they are, so
that they are cheap and tender, a policy worthy of Clare-market will
restore a master to Claremont.
An Income-Tax Debate followed. The fiery Gladstone defended
his calculations. Non sine Diz animosus infant, as our friend Q- H. F.
says; and the brave boy was sternly pitched into by Mr. Disraeli,
who charged him with laying down abominable principles of I
taxation, and being party to a Reform Bill which was to enable the
masses to carry such principles out. In discussion on the duty on
Contract Notes, Mr. Bentinck abused the Stock Exchange as Pande-
monium, and objected to the legalisation of its time-bargains, which
tempted people to gamble. Mr. Gladstone said that there were very
respectable Stockbrokers, that there was nothing wrong in stockjobbing,
and that if fools chose to ruin themselves it was not the business of
the House of Commons. Then, on the Wine Licences, the indefatigable
Gladstone had to make another long speech, and in the course of it
expressed very plainly his contempt for the present licensing system,
as administered by the Magistrates (a contempt in which most persons
who understand the subject share); and he pronounced his hostility to
the monopolies that grew out of "vested rights" in licences. The
Witlers have much influence in the House, owing to their familiarity
with masses of the lower class of electors, and, being aided by the
Brewers, the Bungs made a good fight.
The Reform Bill was to have been discussed, but was once more thrown
over, till the Friday, and much scorn and derision of it was expressed
by Mr. Disraeli and others, the Leader of Opposition hoping that
the Ministers were not going to insult the country by again bringing
such a measure before the House. The Lords had a good talk about.

those recesses, upon which we have laid out large sums, as Ship-traps
and Wreck-pools, which it is Tery pleasant to hear, whether one is a
tax-payer on land or a voyager by sea.
Tuesday. The Spaniards have had enough of fighting with the Moors,
and a telegram announcing a peace had arrived, out Government knew
nothing more than the newspapers. They seldom know as much, as
was signally exemplified in the case of Mr. Wilson, and the all-important
Indian budget, which the Times had got when the Ministry had not.
The Fourth Estate is better served than the Second.
Tne Commons amused themselves with one of those debates in which
duty to one's country is made pleasant by a flavour of personal scandal.
The affair lasted all night, but Mr. Punch has a juster notion of what
is due to the world and to The Ages than to waste proportionate space
upon the squabble. Mr. Churchward, mail-packet owner, had
served the late Government, by corruption, at an election, so the
present Government refuse to ratify a mail contract thought to have
been given him on account of such service. After an acrimonious
debate, 162 to 117 decided in favour of Government.
Wednesday. Trelawney on Church Rates. His Bill for their
total abolition made some further progress in the House of Commons
towards its doom in the House of Lords. There was a row in the
Conservative camp, and Mr. Newdegate, to the wrath of less uncom-
promising friends, made what he thought was a fight for the Church,
and found himself in a splendid minority of 49 to 222, whereat he blew
up uncommon.
Thursday. Lord Ellenborough did not approve either of Mr.
Wilson's Indian Army Abolition scheme, or of his Taxation scheme.
The Duke or Argyll iusisted on the absolute necessity and wisdom
of both, and something of the same sort took place in the Commons,
and in both Houses the papers were refused. Lord Palmerston said
that the affair was an Imperial question, which was probably his
reason for an Imperious answer. Pr&bet odoratat discolor India messes,
remarked Mr. Punch to the Wiscount, to which the latter promptly
responded, "Yes, indeed, India is always in messes of one kind or
another." In the course of the debate Colonel North termed some-
thing said by Mr. Bright as " wilfully erroneous "—in (scarcely) other
words charged him with a deliberate lie. Now, the gallant Colonel is
one of the Swell Soldiers of the House, who are always awfully
bumptious when a civilian ventures an opinion on the conduct of any
of the people whom we pay to fight for us, and of whom we seem to;
have a sort of right to expect that they shall earn their money in a
roper manner. Now we own that when a man or a gamecock is in I
igh fighting condition, he is apt to be a little owdacious, and we1
should be sorry to damp the spirits of Valour. But wc think, and
j Lord Palmerston (who reproved North) thought, that charging a
gentleman with telling a wilful lie \t unpen trap fort. Colonel North
signs himself D.C.L.—we should be sorry to write in our Dod that
this means Dealer in Coarse Language. Mr. Lindsay carried an
address to ask the Queen to ask Electus to ask his shipowners to
agree to the abolition of all discriminating duties upon vessels and
cargoes of either nation in the ports of the other. Mr. Milner
Gibson gravely promised to try to obtain this object, at a proper
time.
8ome Bills for improving Ireland in some way or other were then
discussed, as was a Pawnbroker Bill. It seems that our Uncles don't
find it pay to advance very small loans, because they get nothing for
the Duplicate, and warehousing is expensive, so they send away the
poor to unlicensed Mounts of Piety, where the pious mountaineers charge
the unfortunate creatures about 800 per cent, in their need and famish.
So Uncle is to be tempted to advance, by leave to charge a Halfpenny
on his tickets for smalt amounts. Mr. Edwin James spoke up for the
unlicensed mountaineers, but could get only 32 supporters against 178.
The debate was very brief, Members being rather in a hurry to get
away from conversation on the subject of the redemption of pledges.
Friday. A Chinese debate in the Lords, begun by Earl Grey, who
has strong convictions that we are going the wrong way to work with
the I'ig-Tails. The Duke or Somerset, as Minister, denied this, and
declared that we were bound to avenge insults. Lord Malmesbury
thought it absurd to be one day treating a Chinaman as a savage and
the next as a civilised party. Lord Elgin took a sort of leave of his
aristocratic friends, and said that he was going off to do his best in
China, and rather hoped to be able to obtain terms without fighting.
He was determined, however, that we should have an Ambassador in
Pekin, and Mr. Punch inclines to suggest that when the Benician
has been polished off by Sir Thomas De Saters (if the police do
not grab them), these two gentlemen had better be established in Pekin,
as the most effective representatives of America and England. Lord
Ellenborougii laid all the blame of China troubles to Mammon, as
personified by our merchants and traders, and said that he had not,
when Governor-General of India, dared to publish the accounts he had
received of the sufferings of the Chinese by our war of 1842. Lord
i Grey then took the opportunity of blushing for the conduct of
Englishmen in Japan, and the matter ended. The Lords rose after
hearing that Mr. Whitworth's awful gun was to have the fullest
and fairest trials by the Government, who had been duly impressed
"By that huge cannon's earthquake about."
The Commoas discussed Most Things—but not one thing. The ,
unfortunate Reform Bill was once more postponed, and Government ,
would not at first even say on what day after Easter they intended to I
bring it forth to the House, but finally named the 20th April. Whereat
there was much jeering. As for the Conversazione, there was a
squabble about the appointment of an Irish Lord-Lieutenant, a Mr.
Ltle (a descendant of Annot Lyle for aught we know, or care) and
Lord Fermoy announced that Ireland was disaffected, and might
soon like to be transferred to somebody else than Queen Victoria,
after the fashion of an Italian state. Do the Irish want to take
another leaf out of a Cabbage Garden f We hope they will not drive
Mr. Punch into sending over half a dozen of the above-bridge Thames
steamers to keep them in order. After some equally unimportant
matter, Sir Robert Peel,—upon whom Mr. Punch's paternal casti-
gation has worked in the happiest manner,—delivered a very dashing
speech, decidedly not in honour of Electus. It was full of good hits,
and among them was his likening the behaviour of L. N., in re Savoy,
to that of Ahab, in re Nabotbts vineyard. He might have added,
that, though the gentle and beautiful wife of Electus is entirely "out
of the cast," as actors say, there is an abominable Jezebel who "stirs
up" French rulers to crime, and that painted fiend is the greedy, pro-
fane, and cruel Traviata whom the French call La Gloire. There is
no window so high that Civilisation would not like to see her thrown
down from, to her own war-hounds. i
A spirited Budget Debate ended the week, a formal Saturday
sitting excepted. Our Wiscount tried to exempt incomes under
£150 from taxation. Very right in itself; but we do not want
little bits of injustice corrected while the grand injustice remains,
and the more this is felt the better. Therefore, and therefore only,
Mr. Punch is glad that the W. was defeated by 174 to 24. Mr.
Disraeli gave Mr. Gladstone a severe lecture on his Immorality, in
enforcing a tax he had himself bitterly abused; and the time-bargains
business coming up again, Mr. Gladstone saw fit to withdraw his
clause, but threatened a Bill for the same purpose. What in the
world did the Lord Advocate mean by introducing a Bill "to amend
the relationship of Scotch husbands and wives P" Mr. Punch was so
astounded, that he rushed from the House to drown his perplexity in a
glass of whuskey.

Increase your hosts, your trade restrain,
And beggar those o'er whom you reign.

Will overthrow your government;
Of subjects when your ragged rout

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE BRITISH ITALIAN QUESTION.!
{From our own Twaddler!)
auLT happy are we to be
able to state officiously,
though not officially, that
the complications which
threatened to menace the
British Italian Question
with an unsatisfactory solu-
tion, are likely to be disen-
tangled to the advantage of
all concerned. It has been
decided that instead of a
single Italian dynasty, there
shall be two, but that the
boundary-line of the respec-
tive governments shall be an
ideal one. and that no ex-
clusive allegiance shall be
owed to either Sovereign,
and adherents of either
shall be at full liberty to
settle for a prescribed term,
and upon certain easy pecu-
niary terms, in the domi-
nions of the other. The
Kino Fbbdebico, under
whose active, but benevo-
lent sway, his subjects have
so greatly prospered, retains
of course his magnificent
new Palace in Eastern Italy, where a series of the most sumptuous
nocturnal entertainments will be given during the summer months. His
ministry is one in which the public has every confidence. Count Mario
will be its chief, and assistance will be lent by the veteran Grisi, among
whose colleagues will be found the energetic Miolan-Carvalho, the
distinguished Tamberlik, the persuasive Gardoni, the accomplished
Ronconi, and the promising Csillag, whose estimation by the Court
of Vienna will tend to promote the best relations with Austria. The
devotion which Kino Frederico has always shown to the welfare of
his subjects, and the fidelity with which he has adhered to every
engagement, need no comment, and are the surest guarantee for the
prosperity of his reign. The ancient Palace of the Lumlini is being
repaired and beautified by and for the Grand-Duke Etesmitho, who
has vacated the humbler throne he recently occupied, and ascends
that of West Italy, and though it is one thing to receive the plaudits
of uncivilised subjects, and another to secure the suffrages of a highly
refined and fastidious race, like the West Italians, there is good reason
to believe that the new Grand-Duke is aware of his position, that he
will obtrude himself as little as possible into prominence, and govern
by the aid of the admirable Ministry he has been enabled to select.
Foremost among these is M. Alboni, whose name and person are
towers of strength, and among the administration are the high-born
Piccolomini, who will conciliate the aristocratic sections, the ardent
Titizns, the loyal Borghi-Mamo, and the acceptable Giuolini. We
have reason to believe that the utmost harmony will prevail, and that
each Sovereign will vie with the other in bringing forward a programme
of a popular character. A large issue of notes is certain, and these
will be well received by the public. The utmost freedom of discussion
will prevail, and the press will be entirely unfettered, save by those
influences well understood by constitutional administrations. No vexa-
tious police restrictions will be thought of, but the rigid enforcement
of the Sumptuary laws in both districts is felt to be essential to the
dignity of the States. The tariffs have been revised, and the consump-
tion of articles of food and drink, of a light and elegant character, is
expected to be promoted by the new arrangements. There will be no
subservience to any old Italian families, but though looking at the
commodious Piazza of the Western Sovereign, and the beautiful front
of the palazzo of his Eastern contemporary, we may regard both as
attached to the Culonna, we are glad to believe that each will have as
little as possible to do with the Hoabse-ini, and
[No. Patience has its limits. We have borne with our contributor's
idiotic circumbendibuses up to this point, but here we stop. All we
ordered the demented blockhead to state was, that Mr. Gye opens the
Royal Italian Opera, and Mr. Smith Her Majesty's theatre, this
season, and that eaoh manager announces some good names. The
wretched donkey's excuse for the above drivel we shall be curious to
hear when he applies (fruitlessly) for liis salary.]

THE MAN AND THE SNAKE,
a JTable.
{Respectfully Dedicated to the Swiss Confederation.)
Once on a time, as JEso? tells,
A hind, in winter's iron weather,
Found on the bare and wind-swept fells,
A snake, its coils frost-bound together.
He raised the creature from the ground,
And was about to fling it by,
When lo. Borne spark of life he found
Still glowing in its evil eye.
The clown, whose large compassion ranged
E'en to that, reptile most unblest,
Sudden his idle purpose changed.
And placed the serpent in his breast.
Under his kindly bosom's glow,
Slowly the stiffened coils out-drew;
The thickening blood resumed its flow,
The snaky instincts waked anew.
The man was glad to feel awake,
The crawling life within his vest:
For to have harboured e'en a snake
Is pleasure in a gen'rous breast.
Sudden he stops—with shriek and start;
Then falls a corpse all swoll'n and black!
The snake's fell tooth had pierced the heart,
Whose warmth to life had brought it back.
Well, simple Switzers, had it been,
Had you of this old fable thought,
When, tracked by justice, close and keen,

This sudden affection of Savoy for France is most strange. It has
even puzzled Bernal Osborne. He cannot understand by what
political relations this attachment of the Nice of Savoy for, and to,
the Nephew of the Emperor can be justified.

and we never even now can look upon our treasure, without feeling a

However, smothering our emotions as well as we are able, we
proceed to the discharge of our aforesaid public duty, in furnishing
instruction on the subject of costume. To speak first of the head-piece,
which our artist has depicted as a headpiece to this chapter, it will be
seen the Normans valued the possession of their heads, by the extra-
ordinary pains which they took for their protection. In drawing the
attention of the student to the drawing, we would especially invite him
to observe the funny nose-cover, with which the soldiers' helmets were
in general supplied. Whether the Norman noses were peculiarly
shaped, or peculiarly tender in their osseous formation, are matters we
must own ourselves unable to sniff out. But it is certain they were
shielded with no ordinary care, and one would fancy that their owners
fought as shy of broken noses as they did of broken heads. One would,
however, think that if the noses of the Normans were peculiarly
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER X.—THE EARLY NORMAN PERIOD—(Continued).
nd now, having described
the civil dresses of this
period, it becomes our pain-
ful duty to instruct the
British public on the sub-
ject of the military costume
of the Normans, who ac-
companied the Conqueror
to give the English king
a beating, and then, instead
of going abroad again, here
made themselves at home.
We say the duty is a pain-
ful one, because the subject
of inquiry cannot but
awaken painful recollec-
tions; inasmuch as it re-
minds us of the melan-
choly fact that Englishmen
have had to own them-
selves defeated, a confes-
sion which it humbles their
descendants to admit. The
thrashing of the Saxons
must be always a sore point
with us; and Britons who
are blest with a keen imagi-
nation, must still wince
beneath the blows which
their forefathers received.
Weak as it may seem in
him, the man of feeling
cannot but regard with strong emotion the weapons with which his
ancestors were whopped; and in viewing now the arms wherewith
the Normans vanquished us, we feel a sort of impulse to betake us to
our legs. While "speering" on their spears (to use a Scotch expres-
sion) we seem, in thought at least, to feel them sticking in our ribs;
and we get a mental headache when we look upon their battle-axes, in
thinking of the awful "bonneters" they gave. In short, we arc
afflicted with much the same sensations as when one looks upon the
rod with which one has been birched. The first time we submitted to

prominent, so as to render their protection peculiarly needful, one
would find that their descendants were more nasally developed than,
so far as one can see, is really now the case. We know no end of
people who keep boasting that their family "came over with the
Conqueror," but we have never noticed anything eccentric in their
noses; and we incline therefore to fancy that the ancient Norman nose
had nothing singular about it, or if it had, its singularity has now
become extinct.
But whatever may have been the reasons for their wearing it, there
is no doubt that the Normans found their nose-piece highly useful,
though it may not have been highly ornamental to their looks. Not
only did it serve to save their noses from a blow (a blow, we don't
mean with a handkerchief, but with something rather harder), but it
doubtless also saved them from becoming snubbed or blobby, by the
laws of gravitation and its own incumbent weight. For aught we
know, moreover, the nose-guard may have exercised a bearing on the
character, as well as on the countenance, and there are reasons why
our officers might wish to see it used, though they might not wish
themselves to thrust their finely-chiselled noses to it. If perfectly
adjusted, the nose-piece would infallibly prevent a raw recruit from
any tendency to turn his nose up at the service: and it might also be
the means of checking insult to superiors, by its hindrance to the
taking of that sort of observation, called vulgarly a "sight."
Being not less careful of their limbs than of their noses, the Normans
for their body guard were clad in a ringed tunic which they called a
"hauberk;" a word derived from "halsberg," which meant, as we all
know, a protection for the throat. The garment differed little from
the Anglo-Saxon tunic, except that it was made with a capuchon,
cowl, or neckpiece, to which addition it is likely that it owed its
change of name. By stupidly confounding "Capuchon" with "Capu-
chin," some writers have imagined that this cowl was like a monk's:
while others have as stupidly endeavoured to persuade us that its
wearers were remarkable for a menacing expression, observing that a
Norman was known always by his (s)oowl. With as pitiable senseless-
ness, other punsters have connected the word cowl with our word
"chimney-pot:" and from this association of ideas have argued that
the cowl had a connection with the helmet, which filled the place then

of the "chimney-pot" of our more modem use. This supposition,
though made merely for the play upon the words, might possibly be
worked out into something like a truth: for the illuminations show us
that the collar of the hauberk was sometimes drawn up over the chin
and fastened to the nasal, or nose-piece, of the helmet. By this means
the old soldier wisely spared himself the cost of a visit to his dentist,
in consequence of having his wisdom teeth knooked out: and no doubt
often saved himself from getting a sore throat, either from the cutting
winds or weapons of his enemies.
The hauberk was slit at bottom both in front and behind, for con-
venience in riding and in other crural exercise, such for instance as
that mentioned in the old black letter ballad, which describes how—

From the rude way in which the garment is depicted by even the most
polished artists of the period, it appears as though it ended in short
"continuations," if what are but continuations can be said to have an
end. It seems clear enough, however, such could not have been the
case: for a garment bo constructed could not possibly be worn, simply
for the reason that nobody could get into it. The sceptic who doubts
this may be easily converted by just stitching 11 is dress shirt to the

PILLQRINDERS FOR PAUPERS.
England expects every man to do his duty; but. it. is not every man
that answers the expectations of England. Favourable notice is,
therefore, due to those who distinguish themselves by performing
their obligations to their country. Accordingly, the Poor-Law
Guardians, generally, throughout the kingdom, deserve to be highly
commended. They, at least, are doing tbeir duty in a most exemplary
manner. The nature of the office discharged by these gentlemen is
commonly misunderstood. They are supposed to be guardians of the
poor. This is not so. They are no more the guardians of the poor
than the Police are guardians of the pickpockets. The Poor-Law
Guardians are the guardians of the pockets of the rate-payers against
the poor, and their business is to make the poor cost the rate-payers
as little as possible. They manage this admirably in every respect,
but particularly in their economical dealing with Medical Officers.
The Medical Officer is a fellow who, in the expressive language of
our ancestors, was called a Leech. This appellation was conferred on
the practitioners of the healing art because of the rapacity for which
they have always been infamous, and the greedy suction whereby they
have ever been accustomed to drain the pecuniary vitals of their
patients. They are now showing how well they deserve this name, by
raising a general cry of "Give, give!" addressed to the gentlemen
who regulate workhouse expenditure, and who, with praiseworthy
resolution, refuse to give as much as these greedy rogues require.
Twopence a case for medicine and attendance throughout an illness
of twenty-eight days' duration, is the reasonable figure to which many
zealous and efficient Poor-Law Guardians have succeeded in reducing
the remuneration of the Medical Officers. The average amounts to
is. Id., which seems too much, for it is more than a penny farthing
a day; but when we consider that a physician's fee, for five minuter
advice, which cannot do more than save a patient's life, runs up to the
enormous sum of one guinea, we shall appreciate the diminution of
medical charges to even the highest figures whereunto the Poor-Law
Guardians have cut them down.
It is quite a mistake to suppose that there is nothing interesting in
figures,—for, indeed, what interest is greater than that of three per
cent., except interest of a higher sum P—and the subjoined statistical
table will doubtless amuse many of our readers. All those who are in
the medical profession will chuckle over it immensely, because it
affords examples of the large salaries which Poor-Law Doctors are
still enabled to command, in spite of the just disinclination of the
Guardians to pay them anything whatever:—

Jack Ketch asks ten guineas for killing a man, a job which does
not take him five minutes; therefore, the sums of five, ten, and fifteen
pounds for similar work, lasting a month in each case and performed
in hundreds of cases, though ample, are not extravagant hire to give a
Medical Officer; for his office, properly considered, is like that of the
Finisher of the Law: he is supposed to be the Finisher of the Poor-
Law, and is to help paupers out of existence. This may he done in
a perfectly legal way by sending the patients no medicine, and not
going near them,—service for which any pay is a gratuity.
If, indeed, Medical Officers choose to forget themselves, and their
own interests, and those of the rate-payers, and go trying to cure
instead of despatching the paupers, of whom it is their business to rid
the Union, they must, of course, take that eccentric line at their
own cost. Their business is to cure, not paupers, but pauperism. Their
salaries will not pay them, and were never meant to pay them; on the
contrary, they will be, ana ought to be, out of pocket. No attention,
therefore, but that of ridicule, ought to be paid to the clamour which
they are now making for increased wages.

NATURAL IMPATIENCE.
THE SPEAE OF ACHILLES.
The Spear of Pelides alone could heal the wounds it had made.
Jtust from the steel was a potent cure of the slab. We had thought
the weapon had vanished, like the Troy it menaced; but, happily, it U
in Rome.
On Monday, March the 19tb, in the year of Grace 1860 (the record
is worth pasting into jour Newgate Calendar) his Holiness, Pore
Pius the Ninth, exasperated, beyond priestly endurance, with his
Human children, and their children, at length let loose his dogs. The
long-suffering martyr had borne a jjreat deal, and in cursing Revolution
had foamed himself into several epileptic fits, without calling for blood;
but there was a limit to the vexation of his righteous soul. So he
resolved to chastise his children.
The Corso, in Rome, was crowded with them. It was evening.
The Papal Gendarmes, on foot and on horseback, issued forth from
Mount Citorio, to execute the vengeance of the Holy father. They
charged the unarmed multitude, hewing furiously right and left. (We
take the words of the Timet' correspondent, an eye-witness, and him-
self nearly murdered by the Holy Father's soldiers.) The people fled
in wild terror. Men were cut down on all hands, but there was a cry
to "spare the women." It was answered by the same yell that was
raised in other days by a priest of Rome, when soldiers hesitated to
destroy the innocent with the guilty. 'Kill them all!" And the
Pope's hounds seem to have done their work well. Here is the
detailed report of the Holy Father's dealings with his children on
Monday, March 19th :—
"Many of tbe wounded were conveyed to the hospitals: some to the apothe-
caries' shops. There were coochfuls of wounded, bruised, bleeding, and swooning
women. I saw one picked up in a doorway, with an ugly gash in ber left breast;
not far from it a child with a deep cut in the neck, to ail appearance almost lifeless.
One If azzotti was left on the ground with two sabre-cuts ;.a student (Cerapia)
had received two broadsword cuU and a stab in the left arm. Another student
(Zaccalkoni) was fallen upon in tbe Vicolo delio Bdrucciolo, and knocked down by
three blowa with a loaded bludgeon ; a priest, near the Cafe 8an Carlo, reoeived a
thrust of a sabre, and was felled to the ground with the butt-end of a horse-pistol.
One De Anoelis was pierced by three sword-thrusts ; Rossi, s merchant, had a
severe sabre-cut in the neck. The American Vice-Consul is laid down with a aevere
atab in the side; a German Artist with a deep dagger-wound in the arm ; a nurse
and baby were both struck with the same weapon in the carriage where they aat;
another sword-cut struck both the legs of a lady edited in another carriage, wound-
ing them severely; another lady who had fainted, and in that state was being
carried inside the entrance to the Bernini Palace, was struck in the breast with a
Oendarme'a broadsword."
Why, indeed, should the women be spared? Are they not the wives
and mothers of the wicked Romans P And why should the babies be
spared P Are they not imps of sin against Pope Pius P Let us hear
a little more.
"The foreman of the grocer Gufo, in Canestrari, received threo sword-strokes on
the head, and a thruat in the body ; he is dying. A studont from Perugia is dead,
in consequence of two cuts and two thrusts; dead, also, is the fruitseller near San
Carlo, of three sabre-cuts, which he received as he was descending tho steps of the
Church of 8an Carlo, wbere he had been attending the afternoon service. Tbe
larophgbter of the Apollo Theatre, who bad taken shelter under the bench beforoa
wi'.e-ahop, was cut down dead on tbe spot; his body exhibited six deep cuts. A
child was killed in its mother's arma The son of a poultryman in the Via della
Croce was also murdered; and the same fate befell the son of a tiuman at St. Elena;
one Benedetto, the father of five children, was numbered among the dead. Two
of the servants of the Sacred Apostolic Palace*, both old mon. were playing at
draugbta in the ea/i near the Church of Jesu e Man*; a Gend irme rushed in, cut
down the two players to the ground, and then went on hewing with such blind
fury as to break into several pieces the marble chessboard th*y were playing at.
Two artists, who came from tho Borgheso Gallery, were both wounded in trie head.
QuiDA, a clerk in the Torlonia bank, was struck down in the Via Babuino, wounded
in t' s neck. Ghihelli, a man stroxgly attached to the Government, was wounded
near the Palazzo Muti, where he lives."
This was the work of the Spear of Achilles, wielded by the Pope,
on the Nineteenth of March. Ten days pass, and the healing comes.
On the Twenty-ninth of March we have this announcement:—
"To-day the act of major acommwiictuion pronounced against those who havo
cither promised to aid, or who have counselled rebellion, invasion, or usurpation in
the Romagna, has been published.
"The act has been posted up in several quarters of Rome.1*
Major Excommunication. All who desire Italian freedom,—all in
whose worldly and evil bosoms is rankling wrath against the Holy
Father for the deeds that have been told,—they are all cut off from the
Church of Rome. And what better thing could happen to them, than
to be at once and for ever—as it may be hoped tbey are—cut off from
a blasphemous Institution, wickedly miscalled a Church, whose Chief
strews the streets with the mangled bodies of women and children P
Out of a Church whose High Priest offers human sacrifices! Out let
them go, with deepest joy, being freed from the loathsome pollution
of suck a communion! Excommunicated men, women, and un- i
slaughtered children,—for once be thankful to the Holder of the Keys!

GEOLOGY AND ROMANCE.

In an abstract of a
lecture given by our
British Cuvier, at the
M u seum in Jermyn Street
t he other day, Professor
Owen is reported to have
said that:—
"One of the large English
deer which ia now extinct
was probably living on this
island at the time of Cesar's
invasion, for he describes a
romarkable kind of stag,
with a singlo horn growing
from the centre of the fore-
head. Among the fossil
remains of extinct deer,
there arc- specimens of such
a one, for the two horns cross
one another in front, and
would have the appearance
of a single horn. Among the
extinct camivora that waged
war with the abundant stocks
of ruminant creatures then
occupying this country, Pro-
ricssuR Oweh spoke of an
ancient real 'British lion,' of
a British bear and hyena, the
evidences of whose destruc-
tiveness are distinctly visible
in the bone-caves of this
country."
Thus Geology, as un-
folded by Professor
Owen, proves, beyond
controversy, that in for-
mer times the British
Lion did actually exist,
and that there really was
such an animal as the
British Unicorn. Now,
then, Geology will begin
to be regarded with in-
terest by many good
people who have hitherto
looked upon it as a melancholy material science, conducive to unbelieving conclusions. If it has
shown the British Lion to be no humbug, and the British Unicorn actually to have been at one
time comprised among the British fauna, it may lead to more discoveries demonstrative of the truths of
Heraldry. VVyverns and cockatrices, by the help of the geologist's pickaxe, will turn out to have
been genuine reptiles, and other griffins
than plain ladies will be found to have
once existed in this island. Already,
as everybody knows, the exhumed
remains of the pterodactyle confirm
the nursery tales that commemorate
the Dragon of Wantley and other
dragons; and doubtless, in good time,
the relics of a flying saurian, found
in obalk or oolite, with a spear-head
sticking in the ribs, will corroborate
the legends of the destruction of those
monsters by the champions of Christen-
dom. St. George will be established
as having been a genuine British
worthy instead of a Cappadocian
rogue, and the traditionary enemy,
which he transfixed and triumphed
over, will have been proved to be the
Pterodactylus Longimtrii, and not the
venerable St. Athanasius. Suffice it
us for the present to rest and joyfully
contemplate the geological revelation
of the reality of the Lion and the
Unicorn; and long may those formid-
able supporters of the Royal Anns
continue to sustain the shield of our
Sovereign Lady Victoria! Long
live the Queen, and Professor
Owen!
Alarming Accident to the Pope.

TWELVE SAGES OF HAMPSHIEE.
"Mr. Punch, Sir,
"Judging from certain remarks which you occasionally make
with respect—or rather with disrespect—to British Juries, I am afraid
that you entertain a not unmixed veneration for the institutions of
your country. I, therefore, with much pleasure, take the liberty of
acquainting you with a gratifying instance of sagacity and intelligence
on the part of twelve Englishmen in a box, which nas just occurred
here at the Sessions. A man and his wife (second spouse) were
indicted for cruelty and neglect, of which the victim was a child of the
former by his first marriage. It was a case of " injutta noverca," and
a very bad one. The child had been shamefully maltreated and starved,
and left to suffer the worst consequences of soap and water withheld
from skin and hair, insomuch that the latter got into a state which is
indescribable. The law, as laid down by the Recorder, made the hus-
band alone answerable for the neglect, which, however, was owing to
his poverty; for, although his wife possessed a hundred pounds in the
Savings' Bank, he was not aware that the money belonged to himself.
Under these circumstances, he was advised to put in a technical plea
of guilty, and bound to appear and receive judgment when called upon;
whilst the jury were instructed by the Recorder to acquit the woman
of the neglect, for which, as the servant of her husband, she was not
legally responsible, though solely so in fact.
"'But we vinas her guilty,' said the Hampshire jury. 'We
thinks 'twas she as was to blame vor't all.' I do not pretend to quote
these gentlemen's language precisely; but this wa3 its tenor and effect.
"'But, Gentlemen, you cannot convict the wife of the neglect by
law. The law, Gentlemen, does not allow you,' the Recorder told them.
"'But we thinks as how she w guilty,' replied the jury.
"'That may be, Gentlemen,' said the Recorder; but you are bound
to deliver your verdict according to law.'
"'But we zays as how the truth on't is as she was the guilty one o'
the two.'
"Again the Recorder endeavoured to explain to them the necessity of
subordinating their verdict to the rule of legality; and the above
dialogue, with slight modifications, went on during some minutes; the
jury persisting in declaring the woman guilty. At last the Recorder
said—' Well, Gentlemen, then I shall take your verdict as declaring
her guilty of the fact, and enter that as a verdict of not guilty.'
Whereupon the foreman of this acute and truly intellectual jury asked
the following pertinent, and really profound question—
"' Then, what's the use o' we?'
"Talk of Blachione't Commentaries! What,in all those observations
on the laws of England, is there equal in point of wisdom, to this
comment of a British and a Hampshire jury on itself?
"Ever yours,
"Southampton, Hot-Cross Bun Day, 1860." "Hosfes."
"P.8. For the satisfaction of your benevolent readers, I am happy
to be able to state, that the woman was convicted on another indictment
for an assault on the child, and got three months, whilst her husband
was informed of his right to her hoard in the Savings' Bank; on which
she cried."
A New Tap for the Masse*.
In evidence lately given before the Committee on the Public
Institutions of the Metropolis, Mr. Ruskin declared that—
"There was an Increasing thirst among the working clasaea for information and
improvement."
Hear that. Mr. Gouoir. The United Kingdom Alliance will surely
allow that the necessity for a Maine Law is superseded by the in-
creasing thirst of the working classes for information and improve-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[April 14, 18C0.

Buggins, with his Iron Walking-Stick, which he carries to
accustom his Muscles to the Rifle.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
April 2. Monday. It is of course impossible that anything connected
with Ireland should be done in a regular manner, and as the Irish
Reform Bill was not only not before the House of Lords, but had not
even been discussed by the House of Commons, Lord Clanricarde
naturally toot occasion to deliver a long speech upon it, analysing
its details, and suggesting amendments. But the Lords are very
courteous, and if one of their number began to discuss the propriety of
granting a constitution to the Georgium Sidus, he would never be rudely
requested to be practical. The Duke of Newcastle made a few
observations of an eminently general character in reply to Lord Clan-
ricarde, and Lord Monteagle objected to the only really good
feature in the Bill, the allowing Irish noblemen to stand as candidates
for places in Ireland (they may, and do for English places), and thus
give tlve constituents a chance of choosing from a better class than
that which supplies the Pope's Brass Band. Mr. Punch believes that
the proposed arrangement is opposed to the Act of Union, but so
is he.
Lord Eburt, the Prayer-Book Reformer, gave notice of his inten-
tion to be down upon that volume at an early date, and in the mean
time wanted to know what was to be done with old Smithfield. He
desired that it might be turned into a playground, and not sacrificed
"to the Covetousness of the City of London." The Duke of New-
castle said the City desired to make a dead meat market on the spot,
and Sir G. Lewis thought well of the scheme. A nice fate for the
place where Sir Punch de Fleet Street, clad in dazzling blue armour
studded with silver stars, broke his lance at the jousts given in honour
of Cressy, and made Kino Edward III. jealous by extra attention to
the lovely Alice Pierce. A pleasant ending for the spot where the
same gallant knight overthrew all the lords of Scotland at the glorious
tournament of 1393. A worthy sequel to the history of the scene
where Longbeard, and Wallace, and Wat Tyler were finally dis-
posed of, and where Sanguinary Polly burned most of the 277 persons
objected to by her Majesty on the ground of their Protestantism. But
such is the fate of famous sites—who knows but in the twenty-fifth
century, Mr. Punch having long removed his publishing office to
Buckingham Palace, the sacred ground on which No. 85 now stands
may be purchased at an awful price to build a vestry for Saint Bride's
thereupon?
The Stamp Duties Bill, under the Budget, passed at a hand-gallop,
and the Income-Tax Bill even faster; for the Duke of Newcastle
told their Lordships that he had no time to make them understand it
then, but if they would be good enough to pass it, he would perhaps
explain it to them on some other occasion. The Lords good-naturedly
assented.
In the Commons, Lord John Russell presented correspondence
about Italy, and expressed a hope that some arrangement would be
made respecting Savoy that would be satisfactory to Switzerland.
Those who live upon hope die fasting, says a proverb. A warm debate
arose on the desire of the Government to seize Thursdays, on the
round that time was precious, and that Fridays were very much cut up
y the Conversazione. Lord Palkerston took an opportunity of saying
that the Opposition had given fair treatment to all Government
measures except the Reform Bill. Sir John Pakington would not,
stand this exception, and declared that, Government were the cause of
any delay in discussing the Bill. The Ministers carried their Thurs-
days^; and Sir George Grey also carried another ("experimental")
arrangement regarding the Fridays, to the great wrath of the "Inde-
pendent Members." The Wine Licences Bill came on, and was
attacked by Mr. Crook, on the part of the Temperance Societies, who
wish to make it difficult for an>body to get any drink at all except
water." He was seconded by Mr. Digby Seymour, who attributed
five-sixths of the crimes of the lower orders to the "demoralising
influences of low public-houses and beer-shops," and, therefore, logi-
cally opposed the facilitating the sale of wines of a light and non-
intoxicating character. Mr. Ker Seymer delivered an excellent
speech in favour of the measure, and made some good fun of the trash
put forward by the Wirtuous Witlers, who pretend to think that in a
Pastrycook's snop. where decent persons are served with wholesome
refreshments in the light of day and sight of the public, there will be
less orderly conduct than in the dens where people slink in to drink
gin in dark corners. Mr. Punch respectfully invites attention to his
Dioramic Views upon the subject. Mr. Hardy made a long
and rather amusing address in the other direction, and urged that it
was already much too easy to get tipsy. Mr. Ayrton, on behalf of
the numberless Witlers of the Tower Hamlets, who are his chief
f>atrons, got the debate adjourned till after the holidays, that he might
et, off a speech in honour of Bungdom. Mr. Baillie Cochrane then
made a legislatorial effort at a topic within his comprehension, moving
to bring in a Trout Protection Bill, for Scotland. It seems that the
Scotch fish-poachers are very unconscionable scoundrels, and make
great havoc of trout, and other fish, with nets. Personally fond of trout
(Office, 85, Fleet Street; friends at a distance will please, &c), Mr.
Punch hopes that the thieves will be put down.
Tuesday. The Lords received petitions in favour of the Bill for
Preventing Sunday Trade and the howling of the peripatetic Sunday
trader, and rose for the Easter holidays.
In the Commons was made the most extraordinary disclosure which
has yet been heard of in connection with the Reform Bill. The
Government had pleaded guilty to an intention of adding a third to the
present number of voters, and as this third was to be mainly taken
Irom the uneducated classes, it was thought that assuredly Lord John
had gone far enough in the way of concession. But Mr. Edwin
James, who had been examining the returns on which the Ministerial
calculations were said to be based, announced to-night that it had been
ascertained that between 200,000 and 300,000 more votes than Lord
John had stated, would be added to the registry by the Poor Little
Bill. The House was aghast, and all that Sir G..Lewis could say was
that there was some mistake, in which Mr. Punch heartily agrees. A
certain lady said of a certain book that it abounded with typographical
errors, but the greatest typographical error was the printingit at all, and
a slight adaptation of the remark will make it apply to the P. L. B. "A
great deal of blotting out will not improve the work—una liturapotest',"
as our friend Martial (no, no, Wiscount, not Sir Chapman Marshall,
the poet is often a gross person and Sir C. is a grocer) obscrveth.
After some smaller talk, the Commons rose, until Monday, the 16th,
when people will be rather curious to hear whether Lord John, over-
come by Mr. Ebwin James's proof of the unfitness of the P. L. B. to
live, will be stern enough to play Lucius Junius Brutus.
A Fair Conclusion.
Sitting by her Edwin at breakfast the other morning, Angelina
read the following in the Illustrated Netcs:—
'* It is stated that a plan Is on foot for the establishment of paper-mills in the
metropolis ol breweries. Burton on Trent. 'Spent hops' are to be worked up and
supplied to tho market In the form of paper. Samples of the manufacture aro Dow
on view.'
"O me!" cried Angelina, who, in her excitement, was regardless
of her grammar, "Edwin, dear, you must buy me some of this hop
paper. You know, love, that you've promised to let me give & dance
next month, and hop paper will so nicely do to write the notes on!"

A CAUTION.
Old Gent (with Difficulty). "Now really—Oh/—this dit—graceful crowding—I'm—I'm positive my Gun mil Go Off I"
THE KOOKEES AND THE COOKIES.
A Correspondent of the Calcutta Englishman describes a recent
raid attended with violence by a tribe called the Kookees.
According to this story, which we believe to be no lie, the Kookees
who reside in India are even worse pests to society than the "Cookies"
here in England, who have long been fairly ranked among the Greatest
Plagues of Life. In both the tribes, however, there are strong points
of resemblance, which the weakest mental eyes may speedily spy out.
The Cookies have propensities and passions like the Kookies, and
were a phrenologist to take a head of each in hand, we fancy he would
find a similarity of bumps. The organ of Destructiveness is fully as
much developed in the Cookies as the Kookees, as our weekly list of
breakages is quite enough to prove; and were further instance needed,
it would be enough to note what rousing fires they make, and how
they vent their passion for destruction on our coals. Nor has the
bump of Cruelty less prominence with them than with their foreign
namesakes. Although our Cookies may not venture upon such a
sudden massacre as that above described, they keep killing us by
inches with their cruelly bad cookery, which we feel convinced will
sooner or later be the death of us. Every dinner we sit down to we
fancy we detect some fell design on our existence, and though the
poisoning may be slow, we cannot doubt it will be sure in its inevitable
result. The cruelties indeed which are practised by the Cookies are
more abominable than those we have narrated of the Kookees, inas-
much as they are more protracted in their torture, and are wrought at
the expense of those whom they afflict. We pay our Cookies well that
they may minister to our comforts, yet while they live upon our wages
they continually torment us, and tempt us to commit suicide, if they
don't kill us outright. The agonies we suffer from a diet of raw beef
and underdone potatoes very often make us wish that we were dead,
and in the madness of dyspepsia produced by a bad dinner, we almost
feel insane enough to jump into the Thames.
Moreover, in respect of their plundering propensities, it must be
owned the Cookies bear marked likeness to the Kookees. Where our
dripping goes to, is a question which the Black Doll, could it speak,
might answer; and at shops where "the best price is given for all
kitchen-stuff," wc might guess the destination of those pounds and
pounds of candles which we weekly have to pay for, but strongly doubt
if we consume. \Ve have never heard it hinted that our residence is
haunted, and who it is that walks off with our many legs of mutton,
we must confess that we have not the ghost of an idea; although,
from information we have recently received, we feel somewhat dis-
posed to couple their removal with the advent of a nightly apparition
in our area, bearing likeness to a member of our vigilant police.
Furt her proof, moreover, that the Cookies are as prone to plunder as
the Kookees may to any thoughtful mind be furnished by the fact that
the shadow of a soldier has, about the hour of supper, been seen upon
our kitchen blind, which was incautiously drawn down without the
shutters being closed. The posture then revealed, left no doubt that
his substance was then quartered on our larder, and that at our cost
he was making a by no means shadowy repast. Moreover, when the
warrior was observed to leave the premises, it was noticed that the
fine proportions of his figure in a great measure were spoilt by the pro-
jection of his pockets: whence the inference was drawn, that his visits
to our Cookie were rewarded by some few of what she calls her
"puck-visits."
Supererogatory.
Applications have been made to Lord Palmerston for a Division
of the See of Exeter. Bishop Punch had thought that, thanks to the
amiable exertions of his right reverend brother. Bishop Phillpotts,
the See in question was already as much divided as possible.

SPIRIT BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION.
ertain people who disbelieve
everything wonderful because
they are prejudiced against it by
vulgar incredulity, are accus-
tomed to ridicule those spiritual
manifestations which have been
patronised by the Emperor and
Empress op the French, and
by numbers of our own aris-
tocracy, male and female, besides
the aristocracy of talent, includ-
ing more than one distinguished
author and several literary ladies.
Constitutionally unbelieving per-
sons are also apt to declare that
the alleged phenomena of spiri-
tualism have all been exposed—
exploded; have turned out to be
mere humbug; and that the
pretence of their production or
occurrence is now given up. To
the utter confutation and con-
fusion of these unreasoning materialists, there appeared the other
day in a report of the Berwick-upon-Tweed Election Committee, the
following revelations, which may well, indeed, be called startling
disclosures:—
11 Michael Anderson was examined, and repeated substantially tbe statement
which he had mado on Saturday, in the case of tho objection to tho vote of Wm.
Boons. He said tbat when the threo sovereigns were put undor his glass, there
were no other persons in the room but himself. Brown, and Boove, but could not
say by whose hands the sovereigns wero placed in that position."
It is lucky that we are now writing these strange particulars instead
of speaking them, because, in the latter case, we should here experience
an unmannerly interruption. Our statement would be arrested by all
the vulgarly incredulous people present with cries of "Thimblerig!"
A s if we did not know that the facts above mentioned, standing alone,
are quite capable of being accounted for by the supposition of Thimble-
rig. As if, with common credit given to us for ordinary intelligence,
it were not to be expected that we should, if allowed to proceed, have
something more conclusive to say in continuation. Which is as
follows:—
"Cross-examined by Mr. Wordsworth : When he went to Howe's house, he had
polled, and said to Booue, * Perhaps 1 may.* Had received money from Hodobon's
agent to bring him to London, and had been living with the rest of the witnesses at
the King's Arms. Saw the hand that placed the money under the glass, but did
not see the body to which it belonged, (laughter.) Could not swear Brown did it,
but could not say who else did it. Saw two hands.
"Re-examined: One hand lifted up tho glass, and the other put the sovereigns
under it."
Mr. Michael Anderson swears that he "saw the hand that placed
the money under the glass, but did not see the body to which it
belonged." Mr. Anderson's namesake, the Wizard of the North,
gave some public imitations of spirit-rapping: but he never went so far
as to exhibit anything like spirit knuckles. The feat of showing spirit-
hands is one which can be performed only by such wizards as Mr.
Home, the American medium. But even that celebrated necromancer
never astonished beholders with such a show of hands as that attested
by the independent, if not exactly unbought, British Elector, Michael
Anderson. The hand of Dante is said to have appeared at the
summons of Mr. Home, or some other equally eminent magician; to
have picked an orange-blossom, and to have placed it on the head of a
great living poetess. The lady being already married, the ghost made
a mistake; unless our memory has misled us as to the name of the
flower. But there was no mistake about the three sovereigns which
Mr. Anderson saw placed under the glass, and which he afterwards
put into his own pocket. "One hand lifted up the glass, and the other
put the sovereigns under it." There were tbe sovereigns remaining
when the hands had disappeared; and doubtless, Mr. Anderson has
still got them; for who, that had been bribed at an Election by spirit-
hands, would not keep the money for a curiosity F
We know what objection will be raised by vulgar incredulity against
the reference of the above unquestionable facts to spiritual agency.
They will say that there are states of nervous system of which one of
[he symptoms is partial blindness; tbat one of these bodily conditions
is produced by certain physical agents, among others by fermented
liquors, which free and independent, but purchaseable, electors are
wont, when they exercise the privileges of British voters, to consume
at tbe expense of candidates in large quantity. They will contend
that Mr. Anderson saw the hand that put the sovereigns under the
glass without seeing the body, because he was, at the time, in that
state of nervous system which is called a state of beer, or a state of
brandy-and-water. We shall dispose very summarily of this shallow
objection. If Mr. Anderson had been, in plain English, drunk, he
would have seen everything that he did see double. He would there-
fore have seen four hands at work and six sovereigns, which he would
not have discovered to be only three until he had got sober. But he
saw the apparition of two hands and three sovereigns, and, when the
former had vanished, the latter remained, and he had the money to
show for the reality of the vision. We trust, then, that we shall not
be misunderstood in expressing the belief, that when he beheld the
hands which manipulated the sovereigns, he was under the influence
of spirits.
THE CAT ON HER LAST LEGS.
"My Dear Mr, Punch,
"Op course, as an old General, I always attentively read the
Military and Naval Intelligence in the Times. In so doing, I lately
met with the subjoined gratifying statement:—
"Since the disuse of corporal punishment, which has been unknown at Woolwich
for many months past, it Is stated that the crime of desertion is of less frequent
occurrence, as verifiod by the official returns from the corps of Royal Artillery end
Royal Marines, as well as tho other divisions of tho Army stationed at Woolwich.
This is to bo accounted for by tbe known fact of numbers of desertions having been
induced sololy by the terror of the lash, which, up to the present moment, when
corporal punishment was ordered to be held in abeyance, was resorted to, in some
wooks, every day, except Saturday and Sunday."
"During upwards of fifty years' service, at least ever since the
question about corporal punishment was first raised, I was always the
strenuous advocate, Sir, of flogging in the Army. _ I always said you
could never abolish it, Sir. I constantly and consistently maintained
that if ever you did abolish flogging in the Army, there would be an
end of all discipline, Sir. I confidently declared that you would go to
the devil. Sir. Well, Sir, and now I have the- pleasure to acknowledge
that in all these opinions I was altogether mistaken. The discipline of
the Army, as the above paragraph snows, has improved; and certainly,
I will admit, notwithstanding the Income-Tax, that we have not gone
to the devil. How pleasing, Mr. Punch, how delightful, Sir, it is, as
we grow older, to find ourselves dispossessed of our strongest preju-
dices by the inexorable logic of facts, which are such stubborn things
that they are not to be resisted by the deafest obstinacy. Flogging in
the Army had a staunch defender in me, Sir. It had an equally firm
opponent in you, Sir. You are right, Sir. I was wrong, Sir. You
did your best to convince me, Sir. Thank you, Sir. You see the
force of your observations and witticisms on the subject of the cat and
the lash; and I have the honour to be, Sir,
"Your much Obliged and Enlightened Obedient Humble Servant,
"Choke Oldstock, Major-General."
"Southed Common, April, 1860."
"P.S. Firm in opinions, but open to conviction. Now. Sir, I will
tell you what I say when I hear anybody mention military flogging. I
say, 'Our cat has nine lives, Sir: but the ninth is nearly over.'
COSI FAN TUTTI.
Sat the journals:—
"At a concert at the Palace of the Tullories, lately, Madame Alboni was per-
ceived by the Emperor to fan herself with a brace of programmes, which the gifted
artitte had twisted, with much Ingenuity, into tho form of that useful and coquet-
tish female appendage. With the gallantry for which the French Emperor is pro-
verbial, ho aeted the Pkincess Clotilde for her fan, and pretented it to Madams
Alboni."
Really, our friend Louis Napoleon's fondness for annexing is
becoming almost a foible. How charmingly "gallant," to take away
a lady's fan and appropriate it after one's own fancy. However,
Princess Clotilde could hardly complain of being treated exactly
as her father is treated; nor did she, but with feminine wit she now,
when asking for a fan, always says "Donnez-moi une Savoie."
Penny Toryism.
The Morning Herald ("thou art not dead, Harmodius, no,") has
been indulging in a gross and coarse attack upon the Empress op the
French. In old days Heralds and Ladies were held sacred, amid any
fight, but that a Herald should turn upon a Lady is an outrage on all
chivalry. It serves the Tories right, however, that their penny organ
should drag them in the dirt. They claim nearly half the House of
Commons, and more than half the House of Lords, and are too mean,
(or too ashamed of their doctrines) to support a decent daily paper
that should let us know what they think and what they mean. Penny
Toryism on thin paper, price four farthings. O William Pitt, lie still.
You wouldn't own em, William the Superb.

POLITICS FOR PETTICOATS.
he question whether or not
woman be a reader of the
newspapers is one on which
there may perhaps be dif-
ferent opinions, but there is
no doubt that the para-
graphs relating to the
fashions are generally at-
tractive to feminine perusal.
Hence, it would appear,
the notion has arisen that
b' the covert introduction
of political allusions, the
writers upon millinery, may
teach their female readers
what topics are from time
to time to male minds most
engrossing. An instance of
this practice we find in the
subjoined, which the other
day appeared in one of our
contemporaries:—
"To the excitement produced
by the diplomatic arrangements
for annexation or separation tin;
progress of the seasons and of
the modes turns a deaf oar. The
winds of March and the showers
of April blow and moisten just
the. same whether Savoy be French or Piedmontose, and an equal inattention to
political evt-nts characterises the march of the fashions from their winter to their
spring demonstrations. Their sole idea of annexation limits itself to the consider-
ation of the Crinoline frontier question, and as for separation, the term is only
recognised in its application to the abandonment of winter costume for that of
the more genUl season upon which we are just ontering. Thus it is that flowers
have already taken the place of velvet omamonts; not, it is true, Nature's flowers,
but such as imbate so closely the works of that ancient dame as to give her a Just
cause for jealousy, if it were possible for her to be animated by that unworthy
sentiment towards her younger sister Art."
Lovely woman, reading this, will be tempted to inquire (for curiosity
is somewhat of a passion with the sex) what the word "annexation
politically means: and after a marital explanation of the term, its con-
nection with Savoy will be most lucidly expounded to her. She will
thus gain information on a topic of the time, which, bat for this
allusion, she might never have investigated. So instructed, when she
has to do her duty at the dinner table, she will be the better able to
enjoy the conversation in which the male guests present will most pro-
bably indulge; while they, on their part, finding her so well-informed
a person, will be saved the pain and nuisance of talking that stale
nonsense which the presence of a petticoat naturally invokes. On
every ground we therefore wish the practice all success; which com-
mendation in our columns is quite certain to secure.

THE POT AND THE PUMP.
8 fable for the £en> Solo alliance.
Once on a time, in days of fable,
When all things to discourse were able,
From birds and beasts, to pots and pans,
And blacksmiths' files, ana milking cans,
A bright, big-bellied, Pewter Quart,
His cap of froth set all athwart,
And brandishing his put-out pipe,
hcarP
Give licences to deal in liquor
To pastry-cooks!—hie!—Where's the Vicar?
The Clergy—hie!—of all professions?
Where's the whole Bench of Quarter-Sessions,
Who at your annual brewster-sitting
License all houses where 'tis fitting
That, with permission of the Quorum,
Folks should get drunk—hie!—with decorum P
No harm, while men their brains but drench
In some man's beer who knows the Bench,—
Some large and long-established brewer,
(I'm only sorry there ain't fewer)
Who reckons his bought thralls by scores,
Bound for their beer to seek his doors.
No common publican and sinner,
But one who asks the Bench to dinner.
I say, protest against such doin's,
Nor see our tap-tubs sink to ruins!
"Shall each rogue that the bun-trade plies,
Each dealer in suspicious pies,
Each Leicester-Square retlauranl-feWtir,
Each blackguard shrimp and oyster-seller,
Vile eatables not only sell,
But viler drinkables as well?
What sort o' folks, d' ye think, are them as is
Likely to get drunk on such premises?
How shall intemperance—hie!—be reined,
And beastly drunkenness restrained,
If one's at liberty to buy
A glass o' sherry with one's pje P
If people must drink with their luncheons—
Turning themselves to liquor-puncheons—
Ain't there the licensed public handy,
With beer, and rum, and gin, and brandy P
Don't tell me of poor folks''convenience,'
It's all this Gladstone's wanton lenience
To wine, and wickedness, and vrice,
And that there Cobden's bad advice.
Though Lords and Commons both command it,
I tell you / don't mean to stand it!"
Ana here the Pewter, fiercely stirred,
Suited the action to the word,
And—was it malt or moral's strength P
Was all but measuring his length.
Seeking support, as round he swung,
Unto the neighbouring Pump he clung.
"Kind Sir. the favour of your handle—
Not that I m drunk—that's simply scandal—
I shake with virtuous indignation.
At thought of Gladstone s legislation;
Hie!—forcing down our injured throttles
The vile contents of yon green bottles—
The poisonous acid of the Rhine,
The rot-gut blood of Bordeaux's vine,
The growth of Afric's torrid plain,
The thin but fiery juice of Spain!
As one who values—hie!—sobriety,
And seeks the good of—hie I—society,
I did just now, feel rather shaken,
You might have thought me over-taken,
But, Mr. Pump, you may believe me,
I'm not the pot, Sir, to deceive ye,
When I assure you—and no fudge
That I'm as sober as a judge.
And "—here he reeled—" I now propose.
That Pot and Pump, no longer foes,
Go forth, in union fraternal,
'Gainst the green-bottle imp infernal.
Settle, in Gladstone's spite, his hash,
And bring him—hie!—stand up—to smash.
It's time we understood each other,
Ain't I a Pump—hie!—and a brother!"
Quoth solemn Pump: "My worthy Pewter,
This strife, methought, had found me neuter.
On Pot and Bottle, I'm afraid,
I looked as rivals of a trade;
But now I'm grateful to descry
No foe in you, but an ally;
I joyfully accept your proffer,
Clench the alliance that you offer.
Against the invading Bottle's harm,
Lo, Pump and Pot march arm in arm!"
So, with Pot staggering at his side,
Marched solemn Pump, in shallow pride;
Not dreaming, in his simple sort,
That Pot had sought him for support,
That—Bottle smashed with Pump's good aid—
Pot might monopolise the trade;
And drink to quench a thirsty soul,
Wash down a luncheon bun or roll,
Only at gin-shops might be found,
Or in the tap-room's licensed bound.

CHAPTER XL—THE EARLY NORMAN PERIOD—(Continued.)
xtreme accuracy ilbeing our chief
object in this history, to the de-
scription of the hauberk which
ended our last chapter, we must
add now, that the garment was
made generally of rings, like the
ringed tunic, or bvrnc, which was
in use among the Saxons. In some
instances, however, the hauberk
was composed of little plates of
steel, shaped like our jujube lo-
zenges; a kind of mail then known
by the name of "mascled" armour,
from the resemblance which it bore
to the meshes of a net. These
lozenges were also sometimes stuck
upon the pectoral, and doubtless
proved as efficacious for protection
of the chest as the lozenges called
pectoral, which are now-a-days in
use. They must, however, have
been pleasanter to wear outside
than in; and one can hardly envy
the sensations of Kino William,
when, as is stated, he put on his
coat of mail the wrong side out,
in the haste with which he armed himself before the battle of
Ilaste-ings. Lozenges of steel when externally applied, must be rather
a sharp stimulant to persons with thin skins; and although we have
been told that Kino William was not wounded, we cannot well
believe he left the field without a scratch.
For their further preservation the Normans carried shields, which, a
living writer tells us, "in shape somewhat resembled the modern
schoolboy's kite." The writer who sajs this, however, seems to have
forgotten that there are no such creatures as "schoolboys" extant
now; and flying kites is much too vulgar a pursuit for the "joung
gentlemen" who honour our "Academies" to patronise. Our older
readers may however recollect the pastime, ana to their minds the
compaiison requires no explanation. Whether shields like kites were
any help to soldiers in flying from the Held, is a point "that hath no

magnitude," as saith Euclid, in our eyes, and which we have little
wish at present to look into. Neither care we to inquire, why it was
the Normans used to copy the Chinese (whom we, however, doubt if
they had ever seen or heard of), in the fashion of bedaubing their
shields with fierce devices, representing dragons, griffins, and the like
"fabulous animals." That they did so is however shown by the old
tapestries (that at Bayeux is especially instructive on the point): and
if further proof were wanting, it might be supplied by the passage we
subjoin, which will be recognised by savants as a fragment of a war-
song, that until now has had existence only in MS.:—
"g« barbie flotntan's nose of gore

of the Normans, and we proceed to take in hand the description of

their arms. It is true that if we chose we might fairly shirk the
subject; for nrms can hardly be regarded a9 a portion of costume, any
more than walking-sticks are articles of dress. But the Normans were
of old so continually fighting (a habit which has, happily, died out
among their modern representatives, the French), that their weapons
may be said to have formed part of their apparel. Indeed a portrait of
» Norman swell without his sword and dagger would be as incomplete
as the picture of a British one, portrayed without his toothpick and
his thin umbrella, which however can be scarcely viewed as articles of
dress. Moreover, we have said, the weapons of the Normans possess
a more than ordinary interest in our eyes, inasmuch as it was with
them that the English were defeated; and it is but natural, when one
has had a thrashing, that one should look with some degree of vene-
ration on the stick.
Besides their swords and daggers (the former of which were like the
Saxons', straight and double-edged, with a square-cut hilt or cross
fiiece, like the lath-swords in our nurseries) the Normans carried
ances, clubs, and bows and arrows, and some of their light infantry
armed themselves with slings.
Their lances much resembled those
in use now with our lancers, having
a small flag or streamer at their
heads. The Norman name for them
was "Gonfanon," which sometimes
they spelt "Gonfalon," and doubt-
less pronounced "Golfalol" when
they had a cold. A modern writer
notes it as a fact somewhat remark-
able, that albeit eight centuries (all
but half-a-dozen years) have now
elapsed since the Conquest, the lance
is still existent as a military weapon,
and the little flag or streamer still
remains attached to it. But we all
know how conservative we are in
army matters, and how the wise
heads at the Horse Guards rather
stick to old ideas than give them-
selves the trouble of propitiating
new ones. Indeed so far from won-
dering that the lance is still in
favour, we rather feel astonished
that the sling should have gone out
of it; and it would not much sur-
prise us were an order to go forth
for furnishing our riflemen with the
old Norman bows and arrows.
The clubs of which we spoke as
being used about this period were
not such pleasant things as the clubs about Fall Mall, which are now
in use with many of our military men. It seems a little doubtful if the
common soldiers used them, or whether, like our Army Club, they
were in the hands exclusively of officers. Queen Matilda, or whoever
else composed the Bayenx Tapestry,* has stuck a club into King
William's hand, and likewise one into the fist of his half brother,
Bishop Odo; and this episcopal description is confirmed by Bobert
Wace, whose Roman d« Rou informs us that the prelate—
"Sur tin cheval tout blanc seott,
Toute ]« gent le congnotsaoit:
TJn button tenoit en son Doing."
One can't wonder the good Bishop was so known to "toute la gent"
or as we should now sty rathsr, "all the gents;" for we find he used
his "baston" for the basting of his friends, as well as of his enemies.
This we learn from the inscription in the Bayeux tapestry,
"mc odo xn. baculum tenexs confortat."
We need not say "confortat" properly means "comforteth," but as
one can't say that one gets much comfort from a cudgelling, the word
has been translated "encourageth the youths." Whether the "young
men" in Mr. Punch') service are "encouraged" in their labours by
the truncheon of that gentleman, is a point on which the public must
not ask us to enlighten it. Nor are we able to report whether the
Norman youths much relished the ligneous encouragement which their
holy father Odo so paternally administered. Unless, however,
shoulders were much tougher then than now, we doubt not that the
Norman youths when threatened with a thrashing, would, if they had
spoken English, have cried out, "Odo! 0 don't!"
* It seems doubtful if this Tapestry was worked by Queen Matilda, or by
captive Saxon ladies, who made it for her Majesty, and of course were robbed right
royally of all the credit of the work. Whether the words •Matilda fait' are
decipherable or not, we have no doubt in the least that they were written in the
corner; and that when tho public were allowed to see the Tapestry, their attention
was especially directed to tho autograph, as proving that the work was of her
Majesty's own doing. As the Tapestry is more than two hundred foot in length,
tho royal industry of course was most egregiously praised; in fact, the piece of
work that people made about the piece of work may (to quote a living writor) "be
m,iro oisily imagined than it can bo described."

MILITARY EQUTFMKXT OF THE INFANTRY.
FROM A SKETCH TAKEN IN OUR OWN
NURSERY.
The Norman bows were cross, as sometimes were their bearers;
who, being masters of their weapon, doubtless very rarely missed with
it. It was mainly with their bows, as everybody knows, that when
they came to blows the Normans thrashed their foes. Thus on Hastings
field they made the Saxons yield, when it was revealed that Harold's
fate was sealed. A random shaft shot high did hit him in the eye,*
and his men did turn and fly when they saw him die. This we learn
from several of the old black letter writers, who may have been tho
special correspondents of the times, and if so, were of course reliable
informants. Among them we may mention our old friend, Robert
Wace, who may fairly be esteemed the William Russell of the
period, inasmuch as his description of the battle is the best.f This at
least, if not the public estimation of it, was certainly the writer's own
private conviction; for he observes with all the modesty of authors of
that age:—
"Ef in gout boofes snmt ulunurrinjr, mors fall,
look to 33oh SElacr, ano nou '11 comet them all."
We have said that with their bows it was the Normans made the
English bow to them; and the fact should be remembered that when
England was invaded, it was through its inhabit ant.- not knowing how
to shoot. To show how weak Kino William thought the conquered
nation, be speaks of it as one "not even having arrows:" a taunt which
was equivalent to speaking in our day of men not having rifles, or not
knowing how to use them. When next our French friends favour us
with trying an invasion, let us hope they won't have cause to twit us
for not shooting them. Little disposition as we may have to laugh at
them, there is small doubt, if they come, a goodly number of our riflemen
will use them as their butts.

* Of this fact we believe that there were sevoral eye-witnesses; but of course
their stories vary as to what took place. According to one writer, when the King
was hit he put his hand up to his eye, and crying out "tfnwfpo/" fell flat upon
his face. Another witness states that his Majesty fell backward, without making
that remark; and in proof of this alleges the King's ignorance
which he says that there was then no royal road. This acccun
of Latin, to learning
account, however, is shaken
by a third, which states the King, when'wounded, cried out "0 mi hi l"tn oxcla-
mation which no scholar can deny is proper Latin, but that it bo proper English no

quite tho Old Parr of tho period, it Is not probable ha could havo been a witness
of the fight. His account, he says, was written as he heard it told bis father; and
he adds, "I well remember it, I was then a varlet." A "varlet," everybody
knows, meant anciently a footman: so Mr. Puvch'a poet "Jeamib" might pc
have traced relationship to Mr. Robert Wace, as the first poet of tho plush.
All of a Piece.
It has often puzzled us to understand what the Emperor or the
French means by his reiterated assertions of wishing to "secure the
Peace of Europe. After this recent annexation business, we have a
shrewd suspicion that it is not so much "apiece," as the whole, of
Europe, that the Emperor is anxious to secure.

ALL ON THE CARDS.
1S60. March 81. Tho Prett newspaper announces that tho Empebor o* the French

April 14. The Saturday Review refuses to believe that there is anything in the story,
because the Prest asserts it, but considers the Emperor capable of anything.
April 16. The Morning Advertiter rather hastily asserts, on the authority of the
postscript to an invoice of seme Bavarian beer, that tho Emperor has annexed
tho whole of Bavaria, which it describes as in Prussia.
April 23. Mr. Kinqlake asks the Foreign Secretary whether he has heard anything

April 24. Mr Kinolake repeats his question, and is told by Lord John Russell
that such questions ought not to be asked.
April 26. Mr. Kinolake renews his question, and is joked at by Lord Palmerbton,
who says he thinks it highly probable that tho Emperor has ordered a Landau to
be built for hfm in Long Aero.
April 30. The Timet' correspondent happens to have just visited Landau, and there
appears a graphic description of it, and of Vauban's celebrated fortress, with its
8 curtains, 7 bulwarks, 3 redoubts, 7 lunettes, 1 fort, 8 whole and 2 half bastions,
and broad moats. A sketch of its history is also given, and an account of its
manufactures of calico, woollens, fire-arms, copper, and vinegar. • The Advertiser't
notion that Landau is In Prussia is rectified by mention that it is in Rhenish
Bavaria.
May 1. Thus instructed, several Members of the House of Commons give notice of
questions on the subject.
May 3. Sir Robert Peel makes a speech against tho Emperor, and quotes a good

May 18. Mr. Disraeli, on the motion that the Houso on its rising do adjourn to
Monday, makes a speech setting forth his perfect conviction that Lord John
Russell is juggling and pottering with the subject, and intends to betray Bavaria.
He designates the Ministry as Cartographic Regenerators. Lord John, in reply,
* defends his entire foreign policy, and deprecates offensive language towards an
ally.
May 19. Tho Morning Advertiter announces that at tho Privy Council on the pre-
ceding day, Lord Palmerston had read a secret despatch, stating that the Kino
op Bavaria was going to abdicate in favour of the Count de Mornt.

May 26. The Spectator contends, that as Vauban was a French engineer, his works
belong of right to his own country.
May 28. Mr. Kinolake gives notice of motion, that it Is inexpedient that any
landmark of Europe bo further disturbed. Lord Palmerston makes an excellent
joke about Land mark and Zanct-au, and hopes the motion will not bo pressed.
Mr. Kinolake intimates that he will see about It.
May 20. Mr. Punch invents a masterly cartoon, setting out the whole question in
the spirit of the severest satire, mingled with the richest humour, but it is evi-
dently unfair to expect him to describe it here.—Office, 85. Fleet Street.
May 30. The French Correspondent of tho Timet gives a significant paragraph about
the Minister of War having complained to tho Emperor that the province of the
Bas Rhein is in perpetual danger of invasion on its northern frontier. Consols
drop from 94$ to wf.
June t. The Times states that the Emperor Intends a certain further annexation,
on the German side of France, and calls on the Ministers to remember they are

religious convictions, to talk about anything except the Opera, the day being
Sunday.
June 4. Lord Cowley calls again, and M. Thouvenel is out.
June 5. Lord Cowlst calls again, and M. Thouvenel is invisible, having got a bad
cold (rhume),
June 6. Lord Cowley calls again, and M. Thouvenel is gone to seo his little boy
at Ermouonville.
June 7. Lord Cowley calls again, and M. Thouvenel is gone to adjudge the prize
of virtue at Meaux.
June 8. Lord Cowley calls again, aud M. Thouvenel is particularly engaged with
a gentleman from Muuich.
June 9. Lord Cowley writes to Lord John Russell, that he thinks there is a
screw loose. Lord John instantly telegraphs to his Lordship to tighten it.
Juno 11. The Timet announces that Landau has been annexed to France.
June 11. To a dozen questions In the House, the Ministers reply, that they have had
no such information, and that newspapers are not to be depended upou.
Juno 12. The Moniteur announces that, by the felicitous annexation of Landau, the
last trace of Waterloo has been effaced from the map.
June 13. The Morning Advertiter likens the Emperor to tho wicked Grecian tyrant,
Calioula.
June 14. Lord John Russell roads to the House, amid loud cheers, a capital des-
patch which he sent through Lord Cowley on reading the Timet of the 80th, but
regrets to state that his remonstrances havo done no good, and ho nobly denounces
fraud and treachery, especially in Sovereigns.
June 15. The De'balt says that Lord John Russell's miserable insular instincts pre-
vent his appreciating tho grander conceptions of those who work in tho interest
of humanity.
June 16. The Charivari exceeds. If possible, its habitual stupidity, in a dialogue
between Sir Peel and Lord Glali stone.
June 18. (Anniversary of Waterloo.) Mr. Stanford and Mr. Wyld (M.P.) publish
maps in which Landau is once more part of Franco.
Latest from Italy.—The Pope having excommunicated Victor
Emmanuel, it is confidently stated that his Italian Majesty will take
the Bull by the horns.
WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING.
The attention of persons desirous of a safe and profitable investment
of their money is earnestly invited to the advantageous opportunity
which is announced in the subjoined telegram:—
"Vienna, March 23.—The new Austrian loan amounts to 200,000,000 florins,
tho current interest of which is fixed at 5 per cent. The bonds are of 500 florins
each, and are to be repaid within 67 years by lottery-drawings, to take place every
six months. The highest prize in the lottery will he 800,000 florins; the lowest 600
florins. The issuing price of the loan will be 100 florins. The bonds of tho national
loan will be accepted by the Government at par as payment of one-fifth of the
amount subscribed. Payment is to be made by ten instalments, the last of which
is fixed for the 10th of October, 1S61. The subscription list is to be kept open until
the 7th of April next."
According to the above promising prospectus, no subscriber to the
new Austrian loan will be m danger of losing all his money. He will
be safe at least for 600 florins. This is a consideration which may
weigh with those British capitalists whom the proposals of Mr. Bright
and the finance of Mr. Gladstone may have impressed with the fear
of confiscation. The objection to lending any money to Austria, and
thus contributing to the maintenance of the cruel Hapsburg despotism,
is sentimental, and not to be mentioned at a time when all morality
which is not legally imperative, is very generally exploded and scornea.
The Income-Tax is driving the public to invest their money in foreign
funds, and multitudes, rather than retain stock which is subject to the
deduction of that impost, will exchange the glorious certainty of the
three per cents, for what they may deem the more glorious uncertainty
of Austrian Bonds.
LETTER TO THE CARDINAL'S CROSS-BEARER.
Mr Dear Bowter, Fleet Street. Easter Eve.
Yon have written to the papers in order to take one rather
good joke out of the very funny document just promulgated by our
most holy master, Pius IX. You say that the signature "Apostolical
Curser" should be "Apostolical Cursor," and that Serafino is a kind
of seraphic bailiff. I think you might as well have left the correction
alone. Why spoil a laugh?
But there is one thing in the excommunication which I should like
you to explain if you can, beoause it seems to me that our most holy
master has been victimised by some of the Irish priests about him.
Look here, my dear Cross-bearer.
Our holy &c, says that the people he excommunicates, whom I take,
my dear Bowyer, to be about every rational person in Europe (except
yourself, of course), "cannot be released or absolved of these censures
by any one except ourselves or the Romish pontiff then reigning, except
at the moment of death, but not in the event of their recovery."
What does the holy old boy mean, my dear George f I need hardly i
point out, even to you, that people who have reached the moment of
death do not usually recover. It was in Ireland that the man "dropped
down dead and instantly expired," and I cannot help thinking that a
Hibernian bull has been fraternising with the bull of excommunication.
Has Infallibility been putting its foot into it, and writing deplorable
nonsense; or is it a joke, to keep up the spirits of the faithful P Write
to me, my Bowyer, and tell
Yours devotedly,
George Bowyer, Esq., M.P. Punch.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF POSSIBLE PARLIAMENT.
1863. April 13. Monday. The Lords sat for ten minutes only, and
merely as formal protest against the resolution, carried in the House
of Commons by Mr. Ernest Jones, to the effect that the House of
Lords was effete, and should be ignored ibfthe future. Lord Fitzedwtn
(late Mr. E. James), the new Lord Chancellor, took his seat on the
Woolsack. Dr. Spuroeon, Bishop of St. Albans, was sworn. He
was introduced by the Bishops of Oxford and Exeter.
In the Commons, in answer to Mr. Buckstone, Sir N. T. Hicks
said that the Government had no intention of subsidising the Operas.
They were amusements for the rich, and the rich might support them;
bnt. a Government Bill would be introduced for conferring pensions on
old, infirm, or retired Organ-Grinders. In reply to Mr. Cox, of Fins-
bury, Sir John Bright said that the Queen's Ministers were not to
be dictated to as to any Bills they might introduce: that the Convicts'
Enfranchisement Bill would be produced when they thought proper,
and not till then: and if the Honourable Member asked impertinent
questions, it might be for him (Sir John Bright) to consider whether
he would not impeach him. The Honourable Christy Minstrell
stated, in answer to Mr. Potter, that the medal to be given to all the
men who had been on Strike was nearly ready, and would have been
done long since, but that the artist whom the Association insisted on
the Government's employing had been so incessantly tipsy.
Mr. Cuffey then moved for leave to introduce his Bill for the Con-
fiscation of Heal Estates. He spoke very temperately, and said that
he had no vulgar hatred for the landed interest, many of whose mem-
bers were very amiable people; but he could not blind himself to the
fact that here was the Marquis of Westminster, with a rent-roll of
£300,000 a-year, while there were thousands of persons who had no
residence at all, and did not know any morning whether they should
sleep in a bed that night. This was manifestly unjust. He was not a
violent Reformer, ana did not wish to attempt any Utopian schemes,
and his Bill was of a very limited character. He had caused the
schedules to be prepared with great care; and he proposed that any
English estate producing more than £10.000 &-year should be sold, and
the money placed in the People's Laud Bank. The late proprietor, and
":jow, Bhould receive £6 per cent, of the interest of the purchase
for life; and the rest should be employed in building and
endowing model lodging-houses for the poor of the county in which
the estate was situate. Mr. Potter seconded the motion, but
regretted that the Honourable Member had fixed the amount so nigh;
and he reserved to himself the right to amend in Committee. Mr,
Disraeli said that he should not struggle against the principle of the
Bill; but he had glanced at the schedules, and saw that they omitted
many Liberal landowners' names which ought to have been inserted,
and it was evident that there had been some Esoteric Manipulation
practised. Lord John Russell denied that he had seen the schedules,
and urged that he had no interest in the matter, as the Bedford pro-
perty, originally derived from the Church, had been given by the House
to the Wesleyan Methodists, except that part which Parliament had
handed over to the British Museum. The Reverend Mr. Bellew
said that a provision ought to be made for a Church to be attached to
each set of model lodging-houses. The Reverend Mr, Punshon did
not know why provision should be made for a Church. Had they
taken away Cathedral and other Church property only to restore it by
a side-wind P The Reverend Mr. Bezaleel Gittins said that he
should oppose any such scheme unless it included a chapel for his own
sect, the Primitive Bedlamites. Mr, Roebuck said he had foreseen
this sort of row, when the Bill for admitting parsons of all sorts to
Parliament was before them; and he wished tne Clergy would hold
their tongues, and not keep such keen eyes upon worldly things. The
Reverend Mr. Newdegate said that the spiritual advice of such a
person as Mr. Roebuck was invaluable; but, for all that, he should
take his own course, and demand, in Committee, that Baptist chapels
should share the proposed endowment. Sir R Cobden opposed the
motion. He had always been an aristocrat, though people might not
have thought so, and he always would be one. This was robbery, and
the mover and seconder of the Bill ought to be hanged. He had
received a letter from the private secretary to the King of the United
States, in which the evils of a confiscatory policy were ably pointed
out. It had led to the Revolution in the Slates, which ended in the
establishment of the present despotism there. Mr. Bentinck said
that Sir R. Cobden was a fanatical alarmist; things were going on
very well in England; and when they had swept away all the feudal
rags of rank and tit le, and abolished primogeniture, we should be a
very great nation. After a few words of reply from Ms. Cuffey, leave
was given to bring in the Bill.
A Debate in Committee on the Bill for the Compulsory Sale of
Silver Plate and Purchase of Albata Substitutes, occupied the rest of
the evening, and an amendment moved by Sir Obadiah Elkingtos
for the substitution of Electro-plate for Albata was rejected by 196 to
53. The principle that no person had aright to keep silver for domestic
purposes when the State wanted it for coinage, was affirmed, and the
Bill passed through Committee.
Tuesday, The Lords did not sit. The Commons sat for a short
time only, when a great number of petitions were presented in favour
of the Bill for Abolishing the National Debt.
Wednesday. At the usual morning sitting, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr. Whitewash, who was received with cheers,
apologised for his absence from the House on the preceding evening.
He had been so much occupied in getting ready for his own hearing
before the Insolvent Court that he had had little time for the nation,
but now that he was discharged cured (laughter) be hoped to be able to
acquit himself creditably. The statement was very warmly cheered by
the House. The Chancellor of the Exchequer then stated that
he hoped to be able to manage without troubling the House with a
Budget this year, but a balance-sheet would be laid before them. The
sale of Gibraltar to the French {hear, hear), and the sum that had been
paid by America for the West Indian islands, had placed him in good
funds, and now that the army was disbanded, the reduction in the
estimates was very large. (Cheers.) As regarded the Abolition of the
National Debt, he went on to say that some difficulties had arisen, in
consequence of the Crown lawyers thinking that the holders of Ex-
chequer bills would perhaps be entitled to sue, if they were repudiated,
and his learned friend the Attorney-General (Sir Digby Seymour)
would therefore prepare a short. Indemnity Act, by which such actions
would be rendered penal. (Cheers.) He certainly thought that the
Bank clerks ought not to be pensioned, but that it would be hard not
to afford them the means of living when the Bank was closed, and he
was endeavouring to make an arrangement with the Central Board, for
giving them employment in the new sewers. (Hear, hear.) He was
not prepared to say, at present, what would be done with the Bank
itself, but Sir E. T. Smith had made an offer for it, in order to erect
a Citizens' Theatre, and he regretted not to see that Hon. Member in
the House at the moment, or he would tell him that he must come up a
peg or two with his bid. (Laughter.) He apologised for troubling

In the Commons, the Bill for providing that wages should be paid

In the Commons, in reply to Mb. Paul Bedford, Sir John Bright
stated that the Government, would be very happy to take tickets on

the approaching fight between the Brompton Brick and the Primrose

said that, the Ministry would certainly oppose any measure for com-
pelling the Speaker to give water only at nis Parliamentary dinners.
On the motion of Dr. Kahn, a Committee was appointed to inquire
into the present system of Spirit-Rapping, with a view to its being
rendered available for Diplomatic purposes; and another Committee
was, on the motion of Mr. Martin 1 upper, appointed, to consider
the petitions praying that Women may be declared capable of sitting
in Parliament, and to examine witnesses on the subject. The week
closed with a debate on the second reading of the Family Friend Bill,
which makes provision for payment, out of the money of the State, of
a £500 premium with any youth who desired to be bound apprentice to
any trade, and of a portion of £1,000 for any girl desiring to be
married.
BEADLEDOM IN BRUMMAGEM.
ccording to the Birmingham
Journal, a ridiculous dispute
between the Mayor and the
Magistrates of Birmingham,
concerning the precedence of
the former at meetings of the
Justices, has just been de-
cided by the law-officers of
the Crown. The opinion of
those high authorities de-
clares "that the mayor of
an incorporated borough
takes the chair as a matter
of right at all sessions, spe-
cial or petty, and that the
precedence is magisterial and
official, and not social." The
immensity of the fuss which
has been made about this
contemptible question, will
be hardly conceivable by
those readers who are un-
aware of the infinite little-
ness, and the boundless
vanity, which, in combina-
tion, characterise the greater
Dart of local corporations
and borough benches. Our
Birmingham contemporary says that "Mr. Lloyd went to the Home
Secretary, laid the whole subject before him, and showed how the ill-
feeling, local jealousies, and contention which had arisen in Birming-
ham would be likely to spread to other boroughs if the question of
precedence were allowed to remain in doubt." les, and the diminu-
tive point in question would be regarded by the parties to it as a
matter of vastly greater consequence than the annexation of Savoy and
Kice, or even than the attempted seizure of Belgium and the Rhine
provinces- Well aware of the truth of M«. Lloyd's anticipation of
the hubbub which the disputed precedence of Mayors would be sure to
excite in every little insignificant borough throughout the Kingdom,
"Sir George Lewis," we are further told, "at once took the
opinion of the law-officers of the Crown on the meaning and intention
of the clause in the Municipal Corporations Act, in which the prece-
dence of the Major is declared."
This great Constitutional question having been settled, the Corporation
of Birmingham perhaps ordered the church-bells to be rung, and flags

to be hoisted on the steeples, on the Town Hall, the Gaol, the Work-
house, and the other principal buildings. If they did set this example
of absurd pomp, no doubt it will be followed by all the rest of the
boroughs; and, moreover, perhaps some corporations will go in
solemn procession to church, preceded by the mace to hear an occa-
sional service, and a sermon on the obligation of rendering honour to
those to whom honour is due. The wise decision by the legal sages of
the foolish controversy now under derision, will doubtless be accept-
able to either side of the claimants of consequence and importance:
for whilst the Mayors on the one hand will rejoice in their official
superiority, their other worships, if richer, or in larger business, or
actually retired from the counter, will more than solace their petty
pride with the self-complacent idea of their own loftier social dignity.
The corporate noddies and the incorporate noodles will alike severally
exult on their own part; and the cackle of geese will respond to the
gobbling of turkey-cocks.
CATCHES FOR COMMONERS.
APROPOS OF THE REFORM BILL AND THE " EDUCATED LODGER" QUESTION.
1, Educated Lodger singeth:—
Fie, nay prithee, John!
Be more liberal, man!
Sure, you fairly can
Give me a vote.
I'm no rogue: from bribes I'm free:
My judgment's good, yet over me
A lower class of men you place,
Whose brains I doubt.
Never will I use foul word,
Nor "Charter! " cry: the thought's absurd:
Then say you will amend your Bill,
Or else I nope the House of Lords
Will throw it out!
2. Mr. Punch singeth:—
Jones said to John, when he stopped him t' other day,
"Pray, John, let me vote: you know what rent I pay:
Pray let me vote! depend on me you may.
"You've given Smith a vote, for he Six pounds a year can pay,
For my rent I pay Sixty pounds, yet my claim you gainsay:
And should your bill be law, Smith will over me hold sway."
Now will Lord John leave Jones in the lurch, who will say?
To give him what he asks were, sure, the wiser way:
'Tis so at least says Punch, and lords must Punch obey!
LIBERTY IN A TRIPLE CAP AND CIVILISATION IN
SCARLET.
Rather numerous cries of "Oh. oh!" and ironical cheers, would
salute Mr. Bowyer, if the Cardinal's Cross Bearer were to make the
following assertions in the House of Commons:—
"Catholic Christianity la the soul of civilisat ion. Europe is threatened by revo-
lution as it formerly was by lalamism. The cause of the Pora is that of civilisation
and liberty."
The author of these propositions, however, is not a performer in
that metallic orchestra which, on behalf of his Holiness, alleviates with
harmony the labours of the House of Common". The brass band in
which he plays is a foreign and a regular military one. The above
passages, so to Bpeak, on the key-bugle or the eornet-a-pittont, are
extracted from an order of the day just issued by General Lamori-
clere, who has put himself at the service of the Pope in the capacity
of Generalissimo of the Pontifical Army of bravos and bullies to be
Organised for the suppression, if possible, of Italian liberty. A par-
ticularly pretty tune in praise of the Sovereign Pontiff is that which
this French officer dares to trumpet immediately after the pitiful
exhibition of that sneaking bull "in the corner of the Field of Flora."
"Tell me, faithful, have you seen
My Flora pass tills way T"
are the first verses of a hymn which might now be sung in honour of
the Pope, Lamoriciere accompanying the voices on an ophecleide.
They who have seen many portraits of French Generals may have
remarked that those elder sons of Mars are mostly distinguished by
very extensive joles. This feature may be emblematic; size and intre-
pidity of face may go together; but if that is the rase, the cheek of
General Lamoriciere must be prodigious. He is, no doubt, suffi-
ciently cool in the moment of danger, but his coolness under fire is
greatly exceeded by the coolness with which he proclaims the cause
of the Pope to be the cause of civilisation and liberty.

AN EASTER OFFERING TO THE BOYAL ACADEMY.

he Athenerum expresses
its great joy that there
are not more than forty
Academicians, on ac-
count of the associ-
ations that are con-
nected with the number
forty, and it then in-
stances the "forty
thieves" and the "forty
centuries." We are at
a loss, we confess, to
see the great resem-
blance between the
Royal Academy and the
two institutions above
alluded to. If we were
a R. A, we do not
know which would
please us most, to be
associated (or even
A.R. Associated) with
"thieves," or to be put
on the same footing as
a common "century."
We fancy the compli-
ment must have escaped
our wide-awake contem-
porary, after he had
been indulgingin "forty
winks " after dinner. If
a complimentary allu-
sion were needed, why
not have pointed to les
Quarante Immortth of
the French Academy?
There is some little
connection between literature and art, and we fancy that Sir Charles Eastlake's literary
palate would have been better tickled to be compared to Thiers or Lamartlne than to
Ali Baba or the noblest "century" that ever dragged his slow length along. As it is, if
the Atheneeum will generously forgive our punning on a subject to which it has devoted more
than its customary seriousness, we must say that its compliment, though kindly intended no
doubt, smacks a great deal more of the "foriy-ter in re" than the "suaviter in modo."
AN IDEE NAPOLEONIENNE.
As Europe is all by the ears,
On the delicate question of i.^
And sad lack of material appears
To fill the chiffoniers' bags.
We, Napoleon the Third, would suggest
An excellent source of supply,
From which rags are e'en now in request,
And still more may be raised by-and-by, •
Though it mayn't show good fibre for wearing,
The paper material we mean,
Are the rags into which wb are tearing
The treaties of Eighteen-fifteen.
The supply—at the rate we are going—
Of rags from this source will be steady;
Though some may throw doubt on't by showing
These treaties waste-paper already.
Annexation of English Journalism.
Since the Spectator and Morning Chronicle
have been annexed to French interests (for
further particulars, the curious reader is requested
to refer to the Tuileries), it is the imperial inten-
tion to change their titles, so that they may be a
little more indicative of the principles they so
disinterestedly advocate, into the more con-
genial ones of Le Spectateur and he Chronigue du
Matin. We applaud this resolution; for it is
only fair, having no longer any claim to he con-
sidered as English papers, that they should make
good their French title. In fact, so far as the
number of their readers are concerned, we do
not see why the two papers could not be
printed in French altogether. They would save
a large sum every year m translation.

SOMETHING LIKE A GOVERNMENT.
Mr. Punch reads in the Military and Naval Intelligence in the
Times, that—
"The outer walls intended to form the new wings in course of construction at
tbe Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, have progressed rapidly. Yesterday an
order was received from the commanding Royal Engineer, that on account of the
walls being faced with red bricks, which waa pronounced objectionable, the work
must be removed and commenced anew. The bricklayers have been accordingly
dismissed until their services shall be again required, and the decision has been
obtained as to the appropriate colour of the facings, hitherto given universally in
favour of red bricks. The expense of the alteration is calculated at £1,000, which
will Le borne by Government.
Mr. Punch hastens to say with delight, that this is as it should be.
Usually, when officials have made a ridiculous blunder, from want of
roper attention to the matter in hand, the expense of rectifying that
lunder falls, and falls heavily, upon the people. The noble course
taken by Government in paying out of their own pockets for this piece
of stupidity at Woolwich deserves the highest praise. Mr. Punch is
authorised to state that Ministers have all sent in their cheques, the
amounts having been arranged among themselves (to which there can
be no objection), as follows:—

Mr. Punch is sure that the nation will agree with him, that we have
at last got the right kind of Government, one thai both preaches and
practises justice.
A Gratuitous Truth.—What Sheridan said of wine may be
applied to joking—the best to enjoy is that which you crack at another
person's expense.
MR. BRIGHT IN A BAD WAY.
It is to be feared that Mr. Bright has suffered a reverse of fortune
which has reduced him to a state of extreme indigence. In a summary
of his late Reform speech at Manchester, he is represented as having
thus spoken:—
"The Budget abolished several sources of indirect taxation, and had tied up the
Military expenditure by a tax from which hereafter there would be no escape.
Henceforth those two things would go together. If Parliament raised the Military
expenditure to twenty or thirty millions, thftt increase must bo defrayed by an
Income-Tax, or by an Income-Tax coupled with a Property-Tax. Ho (Mr. Bright)
thought it a most happy thing that this result should have been brought about."
If Mr. Bright does really think that which he calls a most happy
thing to be anything but a very alarming fact, he must surely be
exempt from any liability to pay Income-Tax. He can no longer be a
member of those privileged classes which monopolise the honour of
paying for the national defences. If he were, he would never rejoice
in the prospect of having, together with the rest of the commercial,
funded, and landed interests, to defray the expenses of those wars
which they will be involved in by the representatives of those whom
hostilities will cost nothing. Can anything have happened to the
honourable gentleman's mill? Is it possible that he has invested
money in American speculations? We know the cosmopolitan
patriotism which is characteristic of Manchester statesmen. Has he
been diddled in the matter of any loan by Austria, Russia, or the
Pope? If he has not lost all his money, talking as he does of the
happiness he feels in the anticipation of the eternity and partial
incidence of the Income-Tax, he must have lost his senses. There is
evidently either a slate loose in his upper storey, or a hole in his pocket.
The Pursuit of Funning under Difficulties.
A Young Stockbroker, who for years has been labouring under a

"THE IGNOBANT PRESENT."
There is advertised—everything is advertised now—an announce-
ment that some admirers of Mademoiselle Piccolomini propose to
present that lady with a Testimonial on her retiring from the stage!
If Mr. Punch were not aware that a Testimonial is simply a metallic
form of puff, he would, perhaps, ask why Mademoiselle was not per-
mitted to retire before the Testimonial was got up. But, setting this
aside, he would like to know why a Testimonial should be presented
to Mademoiselle Piccolomini at all P For the information of The
Ages, he would mention, that the lady is a pretty little personage, of
good family (whence much aristocratic patronage), who, by force of
bright eyes, intelligent acting, and a charming smile, pleased the public
into a belief that she was a Lyric Artist. After three or four seasons
of this kind of agreeable fun, the lady naturally marries (Mr. Punch
himself would have sought her hand but from considerations of duty
to Judy), and—for the present—retires. Then a Testimonial is to be
got up! Certainly Mr. Punch is not such a wretch as to grudge a
bride a bit of silver to set up housekeeping with: but, in the interest
of truth and music, he objects to its taking the form of a recognition
of a non-existing genius. If we were bent on worthy recognition,
where is the Testimonial to one Giulia Grisi, who has grandly held
up Lyric Tragedy for twenty years F But in Art, as in the British
Museum, we secure the butterflies with silver pins, but need take no
precautions to steady the diamonds.
A New Enterprise for Lamoriciere.
General Lamoriciere is reported to have remarked at Borne:—
"By tha blaming of Ood and our own exertions, we may soon call Into existence

The blessing of Heaven must, of course, wait on so pious and
humane an enterprise. If it succeed it will have at least the charm of
novelty, for it is the first time we ever heard of things at Borne being
done Zouaviter in mode."

I CHAPTER XII.—MORE ABOUT THE EARLY NORMANS, AND
ESPECIALLY THE LADIES.
adies who take pleasure in
reflecting on the circum-
stance that their family is
said to have "come over
with the Conqueror" (a
reflection they at times are
likely to make audibly, if
they find out that their
husbands cannot equally
indulge in it), may feel
naturally an interest in
inquiring what the fashions
of the Norman ladies were,
at the interesting period
when their male friends
came and conquered us.
Except in name, however,
their dress but slightly
differed from that which
was then worn by the
Anglo-Saxon women; the
chief differences being, that
they called their gown a
"robe," and their head-
cloth they called "couvre-
chef," whence, doubtless,
our word kerchief. We
are not surprised to learn
that they sometimes wore
long robes and sometimes they wore short ones, for the tastes of
lovely woman are continually varying, and the Norwoman no doubt
was no exception to her Bex. About the close of the eleventh
century and the beginning of the twelfth, the short robe went
however completely out of fashion: and the passion for the long
one was carried to such lengths that the wearers very often found
it difficult to walk in them. Women of strong minds, who like
the free use of their limbs, may very likely laugh at such absurdities
of dress, and may wonder that their foremothcrs were such fools as to
be plagued with them. The same surprise, however, must be felt at
modern follies as well as at these ancient ones: for notwithstanding
Punch, and other mental tonics, debilitated intellects are still unhappily
existent, and though gallantry forbids us to call a lady names, candour
forces us to own that people who wear petticoats preposterously wide
are little wiser than the wearers of preposterously long ones.
The gown, instead of beiDg loose, as in the Anglo-Saxon period, was
worn laced up the front, so as to fit the figure closely. It is therefore
at this period we must note the introduction of the practice of tight-
lacing, which so foully has disfigured so many a lair form. In a
curious illumination of the close of the eleventh century, the Prince of
Darkness is portrayed in feminine apparel, wearing a robe laced in the

COPIED FROM THE SCULPTURE ON THE WINCHESTER FONT IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
fashion of the time. This quaint design no doubt was intended to
point out that it was from the invention of the father of all evil, that
the evils of tight-lacing were paternally deduced: and the drawing
may be held to illustrate the proverb that "Heaven sent us Woman,
and the Devil stays."
But the chief peculiarity in the Norman ladies' dress was the funnily
fantastic way in which they shaped their sleeves. These were worn tight
to the arm so far as to the wrist; and then, widening abruptly, fell
pendent from the hand to the distance of some feet. A modern writer
speaks of them as hanging "like canoes," and this description is borne
out by one of the old balladists, we presently shall quote, who in like-
wise noticing their likeness to canoes, clearly may be said to have
rowed in the S9me boat. In the reign of William Ruftjs and that of
Hal the First, these cuffs were made so long that actually the ladies
had to tie them up in knots, so as to prevent themselves from treading
on their sleeves. Cuffs like these we think must have almost have
been found as fettering as handcuffs; and one might fancy that on this
account any one of any sense would be deterred from wearing them.
But ladies nave at all times been the slaves of fashion; and iince the
davs of Eve have never enjoyed anything like freedom in their dress.
Whether the Norman women were the first wearers of these sleeves,
is a point which to reflective minds appears a little doubtful; for are
we not informed that—
"In Arthur's days the Court began
To wear long hanging alee von :"
and what proof is there that these sleeves were not shaped just like
the Norman ones F * _
The veil or kerchief of this period was worn long like the sleeve, and
was similarly tied up to prevent its being trodden on. The same
delight in length too may be noticed in the hair, which was plaited in
long tails, after the manner of the Goths. In Borne cases we fiud the
plaits were cased in silk, or else bound round with riband, ending in a
bow. Whether this bow proved attractive to the beaux, is a point on
which we cannot fairly venture an opinion; but we can fancy if the
Norman ladies ever danced the deuxtemps, their back hair must have
been a rather formidable weapon, and when whirled round must have
served to keep men at a distance. Lovely as our Judy's hair is in our
sight, we should no more like a plait of it flung into our eyes, than we
should a plate of jugged hare to be similarly projected.
This way of dressing hair we have said was a la Goth, but more
clearly to describe it, we might call it a la Grecque; for the Gothic mode,
we find, was adopted by the Greeks, and it is by their name that it is
best known to us. In other respects also the early Norman fashions
were of quite a Grecian character; and we are therefore not surprised
to find that the old balladist, to whom we have referred, by poetic
licence calls his lady-love a "maid of Athens," although he owns that
her pomatum pot was the only thing about her which connected her
with Greece. As the ballad throws some light upon the costume of
the period, we copy the last stanza as it is written in our MS.:—
"Bge trig root rohich unconfintuut
IBragglrth in 5' Dirte btbinoUc:
J3oe tfjge cuffs shapes lghe canors,
©t ntgtrjtr ornamtntte nor use:
33ge trra haire its finer, glotnc,
Err. 5 '11 taBBt to Bath I '11 got!"
If we may note the customs as well as the costumes of this period (and
we really do not see who there is. to hinder us), in addition to our
remarks about the early Norman belies, we may observe that it was
during the reign of our first William, that the sounding of the
Curfew first was introduced. This bell was always tolled at eight
o'clock at night, and its tolling told the people to "quench their flaming
ministers," a command which bore no reference to the Lord Pauis of
the period, but simply was equivalent to saying "dowse your glims!"
Everybody knows that the word curfew is derived from the French
word couvrefeu; but everybody possibly is not so well aware that the
curfew at some period served the purpose of the muffin-bell, an instru-
ment which, everybody knows, is still in use. At what period this 1
so we cannot charge ourselves to state; but the fact is made quite
manifest by the well-known ancient passage which a modern poet has
both plagiarised and altered. The lines, as we have seen them, run,
or hobble, thus:—
"Gfht nirftnj tolls trjc fencll of parting Sap,
anS lo! rohrn htarS, tfjt muffin bog fee set,
EEII10, brhilt the p'liceman ploos his btrrg toag,
Unbitts ttjt mtu to toasting ano to tra."
It will not be forgotten (by those who have good memories) that it
was during the reign of the Conquering Hero, Will, that England
was first blessed with those valuable law officers, called with pleasant
irony "Justices" of the peace. Whether these distinguished digni-
taries wore for purpose «f distinction some distinctive legal robe, is
more than the old chronicles enable us to state. But if we cannot
fancy how they dressed themselves, we can imagine what a dressing
they gave unhappy poachers who happened to be brought before them:
and we doubt not that the justice which these justices administered
was as remote from real justice as that which in such cases is now-
a-days dealt out.
* We may note here that these sleeves, whoevor first adopted them, furnished
the design for the old heraldic "maunch," which, we learn, was first borno by the
family of De Hastlugs. Any baby knows that the word "maunch" means a
sleeve, and its being used for arms is therefore quite appropriate.

PUFF-PASTE.
Oun mordant ally the Saturday Review, in the
course of a just article on literary puffing, says:—
"We can tell our readers exactly what authors hare
adopted as their best engino of puffing. They print on
separate pieces of paper about a dozen short telling;
extracts from their work, taking care to put the full
title of the book at the tail of each extract."
These are sent with the volume, to the journal
and hence so many effective quotations, in the
daily press, from the periodicals and other lite-
rature of the day. Well, the system is not a
desirable one, but there is this to be said for it.
Reviewers are but men, and men have two vices.
They are lazy, and they are subservient to women.
An uncut book or periodical comes to a reviewer,
and, unless he has a very stern sense of duty,
he takes very little trouble to select extracts, but
if his paper-knife is just out of reach, he marks
some part that opens to him, or perhaps throws
the work aside, as "not presenting anything
quotable." The author is wronged. The sheet
of extracts just meets the case, and the critic
may be at once lazy and useful. But on the
other hand, if the work is a popular one, the
chances are that Mrs. Critic has ordered him
not to cut it up with those ridiculous scissors,
but to bring it home to her. Is the author to
suffer because the critic is uxorious and obedient f
Or is the conscientious critic expected to copy out
the extractable passages that he may do his duty
to the work and yet conciliate his wife F The
sheet of extract* just meets the case, the
work is puffed, and the woman is pleased. If

room without disturbing you.
Mrs. If. 1 counted all the hours, Henry, and I heard you come in,
and the frightful language you used to your boot because it would not
come off in a moment.
Mr. If. As I had my easy dress-shoes on, that shows your power of
invention.
Mrs. If. (repulsedfor a second, but charging again). A pretty state of
things when a married man, and the father of a family, is obliged to
have a bed in his dressing-room that he may creep home at all hours
like a good-for-nothing bachelor in chambers.
Mr. N. I should like my breakfast, Julia, when quite convenient.
Mrs. If. You can't have the coffee till the coffee's gone through, I
suppose. If you are in such a hurry to be out in the morning, you
should come home sooner at night.
Mr. If. I presume that I am the best judge of what hours to
keep.
Mrs. If. Oh, stay out till daylight if you like—indeed you generally
do—and it's no business of mine.
Mr. If. (weakly). I have not been out of the house after twelve
o'clock for a month, as you know, except when you have kept me out at
some inf—at some party or at the opera. If you have no respect for
me, you might have some for truth.
Mrs. If. Parties and operas indeed! It's very little I see of those
sort of things. [Servant brings various articles and retires.
Mr. If. Say that sort of things, and don't tell stories.
Mrs. If. You need not use coarse language, I think, and the servant
in the room.
Mr. If. She wasn't in the room.
Mrs. If. She was.
[Mr. N. makes another attempt to understand the WTiitteorth Gun.
Mrs. N. (pushing cup towards him). Now then, there's breakfast, if
you are in such a hurry for it.
[Mr. N. reads and eats, but makes no very remarkable progress with
either operation. Mrs. N. watches him.
Mrs. If. Don't push the bacon away in that absurd manner; because
it's beautiful. If people lived in a regular and wholesome way, they
would be able to enjoy their breakfasts. Dr. Shirker says that it's
the surest sign of good sense to keep the palate in order.
Mr. If. There's a surer sign of good sense, and that is, to discharge
Dr. Smirker; so be good enough to tell that humbug that his bill is
already quite long enough, and he needn't come twaddling here any
more.
Mrs. If. Heartless as you are, you can't have looked at the children's
faces and talk in that way. To be sure I don't wonder that you are
not anxious to see those innocent little things, and reflect what an
example you are setting them.
Mr.N. (surprised into an ironic laugh). Ha! ha! Example to four
girls, the eldest not ten.
Mrs. If. (with motherly dignity and foresight). Example, yes. Care-
less though you are, I suppose you would like those girls to marry better
persons than yourself, and that you don't wish them brought up to
think that habits of late hours and intoxication are the qualities of a
gentleman.
_ Mr. If. (savagely). Jolla, be kind enough to restrain your imagina-
tion. I was as collected when I came in last night as I am now, and
you have never in your life seen me otherwise, except the one night
when your brother arrived from China.
Mrs. If. Ah! don't speak of that. The recollection will haunt me
to my dying day.

Mr. N. Dying fiddlestick! We certainly were very joyful, and a
little screwed. But you never saw it before or afterwards.
Mr*. JV. Because you are artful enough either to keep out of the
house, when it happens, or to steal up to vour dressing-room like a
cat, and let nobody know. But it's no business of mine—ruin your
health your own way.
Mr. N. Nonsense. (Tries to read.) What a row those children are
making! Why are they not in the garden or the school-room P
Mr». y. That's right, hunt and drive 'em out of the house as if they
were hateful pests to you. If you felt rightly, you would be glad to
hear them in such spirits—when children make a noise it's a proof
they are as they ought to be.
Mr. y. Ah! Does Da. Smibker say that, too. Then listen to that
row and give him the sack.
Mrs. N. (rather driven in, but instantly assailing on the weak part of
the enemy's line). The sack! Is that vulgarity the way to tafk of a
professional man and a gentleman. But as Mamma says, when a
husband forgets what's o'clock, he forgets everything else.
Mr. N. (bitterly). The old lady knows what's o'clock as well as most
people. I had yesterday to pay for that wine that was sent her in by
mistake, and not returned by her for the same reason.
Mrs. N. Well, a dozen of cheap port does not eost much, such as
is quite good enough for women. If it had been the sort of wine you
drink at the club at a guinea a bottle, it would be something to make a
fuss about.
Mr. N. Another wicked story.
Mrs. N. Oh, you choose to say so j but Dr. Smibxeb told me that
that, was the price of wine they seep at the clubs.
Mr. y. But the mischief-making ass had no right to nay that I drink
it. I never drank wine at that price or anything like it, in all my
life.
Mrs. If.lt you must drink more than is good for you, I should
think it might be better to drink good wine than bad, which not only
makes you silly at night, but stupid in the morning.
Mr. N. People may be both silly and stupid without the help of any
wine at all, my dear.
[Proud of this last hit, Mr. N. gives elaborate attention to the paper;
Mrs. N. is going out of the room in a rage, but recollects that
Mr. N. has previously taken mean advantage of such demon-
strations to leave the house, but not a cheque.
Mrs. N. I wonder whether Walter Claridge ever used such
expressions as that to his wife.
Mr. N. It is matter of indifference to me what Mr. Claridge may
or may not do, but I am inclined to think that he does not reprove
Mrs. Claridge.
Mrs. N. No, because he remembers that he is a gentleman.
Mr. N. Or, because she is too much in the habit of being a lady to
need to remember that she is one.
Mrs. N. (almost at boiling point.) I dare say that if Walter
Claridge is ever so unfortunate as to have a headache from his own
misconduct, he does not revenge himself by insulting his wife at her
own table.
Mr. N. (calmly.) I have no idea where he insults her, my dear. You
had better ask her for any information you want, as you are always at
her house.
Mrs. N. It is untrue. I have not been in Phillimore Crescent for
ten days.
Mr. N. No, because she has been unwell, and you could only have
been useful to her, without being amused. Sweet are the uses of
feminine friendship.
Mrs. N. 1 dare say it is as good as the friendship that keeps men out
of their houses at a Club till three in the morning, and then sends them
home in a state they ought to be ashamed of. And I shall go to
Louisa's as often as I please.
Mr. N. Pray, do, my dear. I suppose when they are tired of you,
they will let you know, as they did the other day, when you were told
Not at Home, because Mrs. De Clamber was there, and Mrs.
Clartdge had no notion of your knowing her swell friends.
Mrs. N. It was a mistake of the servant's. And if it wasn't, how
mean of you, believing so, to go and dine at the Blue Posts with
Walter Claridge next day.
Mr. N. Perhaps it was to show my power of Christian forgiveness,
my dear; perhaps it was in gratitude to the Clabidges for keeping you
out of acquaintances''above your sphere.
Mrs. tf. (slowly.) Yes, you are right. They are above my sphere—
now. They would not have been if I had listened to my friends a few
years ago.
Mr. N. You are very good to say a few, dear. It shows that you
have not felt them to be a good many, though dates may say they are
—or 1 may.
Mrs. N. (breaking out strong.) You are capable of saying anything
that is rude and vulgar, and the next time you come home as you did
last night, be good enough to breakfast by yourself. [Rises.
Mr. N. As I came home last night, Julia, was, I repeat, as coUected
as I am now. The proof is, and as you are going up-stairs you will be
able to judge for yourself, that I came quietly into your room, and as
you were asleep, I put the Opera-box you asked me for under the
large green toilette-bottle to the right of the glass. The clock struck
one as I did it.
Mrs. N. (mollifying.) Oh, you story! But did you P
Mr. N. Go and see.
Mrs. N. And which Opera P
Mr. N. Covent Garden.
Mrs. N. And you know I wanted to hear Piccolomibi. However,
you can get that for Saturday night, can't you P
Mr. N. Humph!
Mrs. N. Ah, you are a sad bad boy! But, however, I suppose
that I must look over it. Let me give you some hot coffee, you have
been dawdling over that until it is cold, but if people will stay out till
four o'clock in the morning, Sec., &c, &c, &c.

POSTING THE POPE S BULL.
(From our Own Correspondent.)
Home, April 7.
I am just returned from the Corsoj where I have been smoking a
cigar, and thinking of the Popb's Major Excommunication, which, as
my ' weed" has done, seems likely to end in smoke. Yesterday 1
went to see it posted, according to the directions of his Holiness, by
the Apostolical Cursor and Bill Sticker, Aloys Serafina. This
sacred functionary proceeded from the Sistine Chapel, furnished with
a number of copies of the fulminating composition, of which the
material, being paper, is not likely to prove so explosive as gun-cotton.
He also carried a great brush and a paste-pot of pantomimic magni-
tude, the contents of which had just been solemnly blessed by the
Holy Father. Having arrived at the doors of the Laterau Church, he
dipped his brush into the adhesive and consecrated material contained
in the above-named vessel, and, taking up a quantity of it on the end
of the implement, was about to spread it on the Church portals, but, a
low Roman, who stood behind, "chaffing" him, he turned suddenly
round and thrust it into the fellow's face. He then addressed himself
to the performance of his task, which he accomplished without further
interruption than that of the ironical cheers of the by-standers, and the
orange-peel which was flung at him by the junior portion of the popu-
lace. The same operation, under similar circumstances, he repeated
at St. Peter's, at the Apostolic Chancery, at the General Curia, ou
most of the hoardings, dead walls, &c, and on some of the neighbouring
ruins of antiquity. Finally, with myself and a train of boys at his
heels, he repaired in pursuance to the pontifical injunction, to the
Field of Flora, and there stuck the Bull of his Holiuess in a corner,
fixiug it to the palings.
The reason why the posting of the letter of excommunication has
been limited to the corners and sheds of Rome, has been candidly con-
fessed by the Pufe to be the circumstance that it "cannot be safely
published everywhere." He has, however, decreed that its partial
publication shall be equivalent to its presentation, nominalim aud
\personaliter. That it has been served on all those against whom it is
levelled really and bodily, will, of course, therefore, be received by all
true believers as an article of faith.
FRANCIS-JOSEPH'S DREAM.
According to a Correspondent of the Times, the Emperor Francis
Joseph, having thrice lately dreamt a certain dream, is reported to
have consulted a witch for the interpretation thereof. The wise woman
had been recommended by his Majesty's equally wise Mamma, and—
"Introduced to the august presence, the crone domanded what visions of tho
night bad startled the Imperial slumbers. The Emperor informed her that he had
dreamed of three mice ; the first perfectly blind, tbe second so immensely bloated
and fat that it could hardly walk, aud tbe third weak, poor, and almost dying from
starvation. The beldame appeared alarmed, and at first professed tier iuabuiry to
afford any solution; but on being reassured and informed that under any circum-
stances she might rety not only on protection but reward, sho took heart, and,
much to the astonishment of her Imperial interrogators, replied, 'The blind mouse
is -your Majesty; the fat mouse your Ministers; and tbe worn out, starring, and
exhausted mouse, your people.'
The Times' Correspondent doubts the truth of this story. It seems,
however, probable enough, if we suppose premouitory dreams to be
improbable. A little mind might naturally enough see its own small
ideas projected from the brain during sleep in the form of mice.
Though the Majesty of Austria may be adequately represented by a
blind mouse, and a famished mouse may constitute a tolerable type of
the Austrian people, the Austrian ministry cannot by any means well
be conceived of under the semblance of a mouse. The governing
wisdom of Austria, so far from being correctly symbolised by a mouse,
finds its liveliest emblem in that notable enemy and destroyer of mice,
the Owl.

FUNNY FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
Recording certain festivities in progress at Ingestre, in Stafford-
shire, to celebrate the Earl Talbot's inheritance of the title and
estates of Shrewsbury, the Morning Post relates the subjoined par-
ticulars :—
"The Earl or Shrewsbury and Talbot is entertaining a large circle of private
friends at Ingestre, where the fine old family mansion is full to overflowing with a
brilliant circle of guests, who indeed are so numerous that extra accommodation
has to be sought in the neighbouring county institutions; and some of the party
are availing themselves of the ready offer made to his Lordship by Dr. Hewsox, of
Coton Hill Lunatic Asylum, and Major FnLLroRD, cf the County Gaol, and several
other neighbouring residents."
If misery makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows, enjoyment
has for once in the way, at least, introduced our aristocracy to strange
dormitories. The gaol and the madhouse are queer places for nobility
and gentry to sleep in. Perhaps, among tbe other institutions of
Staffordshire which have afforded accommodation to the fashionable
fuests of the Earl op Shrewsbury, the Union Workhouse might
ave been enumerated, if the mention of that place of punishment is
not too shocking for ears polite. Yet it must have been not without
delight that the Lords and Ladies, and honourable Captains and other
persons of honour and quality, reclined in their wards and cells, and
thought to themselves how jolly it was to be where they were, and to
be able to get out again; to be people of rank, fashion, and opulence,
and not paupers.
Even t he court of stern Themis was converted for the nonce into a
hall of dazzling light, that the Earl of Shrewsbury's company might
dance in it:—
11 On Tuesday the sbove-named visitors were the principal guests of the Earl
and Countess or Shrewsbury and Talbot, at a ball which was given by them
at Stafford, and to which tho chief county residents were invited. For this ball his
Lordship bad obtained from tho Magistrates at Quarter Sessions permission to uso
tho Shire-ball, comprising the Assixe Courts and the Judges' residence adjoining."
And so the gay and glittering throng tupped it on the light fan!aitic
toe around the judgment-seat. "May I have the pleasure of dancing
with you in the dock?" "Will you allow me to take you for a waltz
in the jury-box F" were doubtless among the gallant invitations ad-
dressed by aristocratic officers and others to elegant, beautiful, highly
dressed and decorated young persons of exalted position in Society.
"Wonda how many fellahs have been sentenced to be hanged heaw!"
was perhaps the exclamation of more than one reflective Swell, as he
thought how much jollier it was to be in his own patent, leathers than
it would be to stand in the highlows of a convict. The Swell no doubt
will often hereafter cite his recollections of Lord Shrewsbury's high
jinks in tbe Assize Court and hospitality in the gaol, beginning with
When a danced in the Quown Cawt and Nisi Pvrius at Staffawd," or
"When a slept in the condemned cell."
We may conclude these remarks by congratulating the Staffordshire
Bench that their gaol is so empty of its regular inmates as to be capable
of accommodating the Earl op Shrewsbury's surplus of the better
sort. True it is, however, that the Lent Assizes are but just over; so
that the aristocracy in the "jug" are occupying the quarters which
have been only recently vacated by the rogues and thieves.
"Molehill* to Giants are to Pigmies Alps."

"Volunteers, Sir!" said a patriotic country gentleman, the other
day; "if there was a notion of an invasion, everybody would arm—the
very Beggars along our roads would turn out and fight." "To be

THE EFFECTS OF EXCOMMUNICATION.
Whom has the Pope excommunicated? The Frenck
and Italian Clergy at least do not seem to know. Bos a-
tarte had the communion given him the other day; and
as for Victor Emmanuel, a telegram from Florence
informs us that—
"The King baa received the Archbishop and clergy of Florence."
Is it possible that the Clergy of Florence, with their
Archbishop at their head, should go and offer homage to
a sovereign whom they believed to be an excommunicated
usurper? If the bau of his Holiness was neither aimed at
the Kino or Italy nor the Emteror or the French, it
must have been intended for the head of some person or
persons unknown. The successor of Peter meant to
smite those, whoever they may be, to whom he owed the
loss of his dominions. If a Papal Bull, as Roman Catholics
affirm, never misses its mark, though that may be out of
sight, this apparently random shot of- Infallibility, like
Zamiel's seventh bullet, will unerringly hit its unapparent
victim or victims. They will turn up after a time, exhi-
biting, bodily, the withering effects of the Pontifical curse,
like the jackdaw in those edifying legends versified by the
late Kev. Mr. Baku am, which came in for the indefinite
anathema of the Saint. What if the damaged parties
should turn out to be evil counsellors? What if Cardinal
Antonelli should some fine morning astonish the Eternal
City by appearing with ragged robes, in a state of mange;
and if the Kino of Naples and the Emperor of Austria
should be suddenly attacked with ringworm, and flea-bitten,
or seized with convulsions, and afflicted with the mumps
and the stomach-ache?
Persecuted Holiness.
The Pope has long been talking of an intention to take
refuge in the Catacombs. At length we understand that
orders have been issued for the fitting up of those interest-
ing retreats of early Christianity for the reception of the
Holy Father, in a style of upholstery consonant with modern
ideas, and with that civilisation with which the cause of
the papacy, according to Lamoriciere, is identical.

A COCKNEY ON A FOX-HUNT.
The truth that "different men have different opinions" is one which
scholars know, was anciently asserted, and which is still continually
receiving confirmation. Here for instance is a paragraph from the
Daily Telegraph, which expresses an opinion on the noble sport of fox-
hunting, vastly different from that which one would find, say, in Bell's
Life.—
"We would not be understood as decrying or undervaluing the masculine sporta
and pursuits which tend to harden the bones and invigorate the siuews of English-
men. We may not deem it very heroic for fifty mounted gentlemen, preceded by
a pack of bloodthirsty dogs, to chase a miserable fox at fuU *peed for hours, until
the terrified animal has boen hunted off ita legs. We may not think it a glorioua
day'a work to shoot down forty braco of pheatunta in a preserve, where the creatures
have learned to come together at their keeper's voice. [With this we quite agree,
Punch ] We may not regret the good old days of cock-fighting and bull-baiting.
. . but our readers will bear us out when we tay, that legitimate and manly sporta
and purkuits find in us unreserved supporters."
This passage occurs in an article condemning the practice of prize-
fighting, which the writer calls "a compound of rascality and ruffianism,
unredeemed by a single softening or mitigating element." This des-
cription possibly some readers may applaud; but very few, we fancy,
will agree that the above words give a fair view of the fox-hunt, or
will endorse the writer's estimation of that sport. Most people view a
fox-hunt as a means of manly exercise; a pastime which not merely
invigorates the body, but imparts a healthy tone and cheerful temper
to the mind: a sport, moreover, which affords a place of meeting for
all classes, from the peasant to the peer, and promotes a kindly sym-
pathy and fellow feeling among men who might otherwise be tempted
to lose thought of their relationship.
In forming an opinion, much depends, however, on the influence of
position, ana the point of view from which the person looks. A
man who cannot spar, and has chanced to get his eye blacked, will not
unnaturally complain of the brutalities of boxing, and speak of every
bruiser as a ruffianly brute. So a cockney who can't ride, and
therefore can't enjoy the pleasure of a fox-hunt, is apt perchance to
call it a bloodthirsty amusement, and a way of spending time which is
at best a waste of it. How can a man appreciate the pleasures of the
field when his riding is confined to a trot up Rotten Row, or an Easter
Monday canter upon Hampstead Heath? A cockney clapped on
horseback has no power to look about him, and enjoy like better
horsemen the pleasures of the hunt. When in the saddle his chief
thought is how to keep his seat, and he cannot rightly relish the fresh
air of "the open," or spare reflection on the pleasantness of seeing
men enjoy themselves, or on the other kindly feelings engendered by
the sport. This, it may be said, is less his fault than his misfortune;
but he surely should abstain from disparaging a pastime, simply for
the reason that he can't himself enjoy it.
Something in Homoeopathy.
A Disciple of Hahnemann advertises a work entitled HomasopalAie
Treatment of Indigestion. Now here you have homoeopathy proposed
for application to a disease which it is really capable of curing. Like
will cure like in this disease at any rate, if like is administered in
infinitesimal quant ii ies. The minutest possible doses of mock-turtle, in
the case of an Alderman, for example, conjoined with a plain and
moderate diet, will doubtless, if taken with sufficient perseverance,
generally remove, or at least relieve indigestion.
Female Heroism.
It appears from the Army and Navy Gazette that the regular Anny is
disinclined to Salute the Volunteer Officers. Mr. Punch is authorised,
on the part of the Ladies of England to state that, in the interest of
their beloved country, they undertake, henceforth, to relieve the
regulars by performing the above ceremony at all fitting times and
seasons.

CHAPTER XIII—PERIOD, THE REIGNS OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
HENRY THE FIRST, AND STEPHEN.
ccordtno to the best authorities
(we need not name ourselves,
but with the names of Anna
COMNENA, ORDERICUS VlTALIS,
and Johannes de Jantja, the
reader may perhaps not be so
well familiar) a great attention
to costume was paid during this
period, and, among the men
especially, a more than usual
love of finery prevailed. What
the reason for this was, it would
be puzzling to guess. The
ancient chroniclers content
themselves wit h simply noticing
the fact, and modern writers
sensibly have followed their
example. One authority how-
ever has alleged in explanation,
that as the followers of the
Conqueror were " the flower of
the continent," they naturally
did their best, not to look seedy.
It is but fair to the fair sex
that, when the gentlemen outdo
them in absurdities of dress,
t he fact should be recorded in
the annals of the time; and
truth forces U3 to own, that the
men of the eleventh century
were even sillier than the women
in the matter of costume. The
feminine apparel we already
have described : • and careful
readers will remember that we
spoke of it as characterised by
amplitude of length. In this
respect, however.it was certainly
surpassed by the masculine
costume; and 'inasmuch as
lovely woman is an imitative
creature, we may assume that,
at this period the male sex set the fashion, and the female followed
it. The short tunic was worn longer than it had been before
(longer, that is, in dimension, and not in time of wearing it); and
the long one was so lengthened that it trailed upon the ground, as
did the interula, a linen vestment under it. The sleeves too were
extended in width as well as length; and besides being made as long
again as they were wanted, while fitting their arms closely, they were
widened at the cuff, so as to fall over the hand, and indeed completely
cover it. In some of the illuminations the sleeves are rolled up at, the
wrists, and this, especially at meal time, must have certaiuly been
needful, as even in our own day we have had cause to observe. The
wide cuffs which were worn a year or two ago were always dipping in
the sauces and sweeping off the spoons; and imagination shrinks from
picturing a banquet in the time of William Rufus, when the sleeves
seemed made expressly to dangle in the gravy and to draggle in the
soup.
This mania for long dresses was of course severely satirised by the
Punches of the period, if the old illuminators were worthy of the name.
It was remarked of men of fashion that, although they were not lawyers,
they were very obviously gent lemen of the long robe; and one sarcastic
writer speaks of them as looking like great babies, in consequence of
their still being seen ki long clothes. But the mania long prevailed,
in spite of all attempts to cure it; just as crinolinomania, we appre-
hend, still spreads, notwithstanding all the jokes which have been
made to check it.
The swells too came out as extensively in point of cloth as cut, and
not only wore Ion* dresses, but, paid a good long price for them. A
mantle given to King Henrt by Bob Blolt, Bishop of Lincoln, was
made of the finest cloth, and lined with black sables spotted with while
srots, and his lordship, we, find, had to pay a hundred pounds for it.

who mentions in his anecdotes De Jestiaf regum Anglice, that when

ANTIQUITIES.
These mantles lined with fur were worn with the long tunic, which
was only sported upon state occasions. With the shorter tunic a
shorter cloak was worn ; but this was also lined wit h t he most precic us
sort of furs, and from its costing so much rhino, perhaps, was called the
"rheno." Cloaks or mantles likewise then were made of common
cloth, for the use of common people. These had usually a cowl attached
to fir the head; and as this appendage answered the purpose of a cap,
the Normans were, we think, quite right to call it capa." For
further capital protection, the Phrygian shaped cap was still in use
among the commoners; and a hat appears in one illumination of this
date, shaped like the ancient Roman pctasus, or like the wide-awake in
use among our modern warbling waggoners.
Although the long sleeves of the tunics rendered gloves almost
unnecessary, we find they were in use among the better classes, and it
t herefore is tautology to say the clergy wore them. Ordericus Vi-
talis expressly tells us this, in his account of how a Bishop (we need
not say of Durham) made his escape from the Tower (which every
schoolboy knows was in the reign of Henry the First). According
to O. V., the prelate in his haste had "forgotten his gloves," and this
piece of forgetfulness he had long reason to remember, for in sliding
down the rope which he had hung out of his window, he "dyd scrape
ye skynne offe bothe hys handes untoe y* bone, y* whyche as he re-
markedde to hys selfe was, 'No bono.'
The same mania for length that we have noticed in the tunics
descended to the feet. Long peaked-toed boots were worn, which by
the old monkish historians were called ocreee rostrats, and which, as
the clergy were forbidden to indulge in them, of course naturally
excited their just wrath and contempt. To dissuade people from wear-
ing them, the most appalling stories were told about their origin; and
O. V. even goes so far as to hint that they were really an "invention
of the enemy," being clearly made for "Somebodye deformed as toe
hys feete." Shoes with peaks were also quite the go about this period,
having their toes sometimes twisted like a pig's tail, whence probably
it was that the monks called them pig-acue. At other times their toes
were made somewhat more like a scorpion's than a pig's tail ■ and the
resemblance we may fancy was felt to ne most striking, for they must
have stung tremendously when any one was kicked.
The chief study of the dandies bs ing personal adornment (a study
which, we hear, is pursued still at our colleges, and retains its hold on
students even more advanced in life), we are not surprised to learn
that they greatly gave their minds to the shaping of their soles, and
vied in get ting what they viewed as the most bootiful of boots. Es-
pecially they piqued themselves upon the making of their peaks; and
indeed so much was thought of this accomplishment, that the swells
were sometimes named from the successes they achieved, and had a
Peveril lived then, and invented a new toe. he would have been dis-
tinguished as a "Peveril of the Peak." This we may surmise from
the statement that a courtier, whose Christian name was Robert, got
the cognomen of "Cornadu; not because he had a corn, but because
he made a shoe which curled round like a horn. This feat he achieved
by cramming tow into the toe, and twisting it when rammed into the
shape of a ram's horn. The beauty of this fashion must, like that of a
Scotch terrier, have consisted in its ugliness i but we find that,
nevertheless, it was extensively adopted, ana we are told that
rectly, with a "G." But the book, which Is In fact the Joe Miller of the period,
contains so many jests that wo prefer to spell it "Jestis."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"alle y' swelles dyd turne th« handes toe rammin, justle for all y*
worlde as thoe they Ladde beene rammineurs."
People might imagine that
boots with such long toes must
certainly have much impeded
locomotion, if they did not
altogether put a stop to pedal
exercise. TJut that this was
not the case is shown by an
old ballad, supposed to have
been sung during "y* jump-
ynge of Jym Crowe," which
everybody knows was a pastime
of the period, requiring great
activity and suppleuess of foot.
As the ballad, although so old,
will be new to many of our
readers (the MS. having never
yet been out of our possession)
we may delight, the antiquarian
by printing the first stanza.
The mixed patois of the period
in which the ballad is composed
is a sufficient proof, we fancy, of
the writing being genuine, if any
of our readers are such sceptics
•as to doubt it:—

HER LADYSHIP'S AUNT SALLY.
An interesting legal question may perhaps be raised concerning a
transaction occasioned by the subjoined advertisement, which appeared
the other day in the Morning Post:—
T ADIES OF RANK can be ACCOMMODATED with immediate
Cash to any amount, repayable at their own convenience. Tho strictest privacy
niay be relied upon. Diamonds, plate, and miscellaneous property of every des-
cription purchased. All parcels and letters addressed to Madame 8. K L.. New
Oxford Street, will be answered with immediate cash. Ladies attended at their
own residences.
The meaning of this benevolent announcement may be misconceived
by some of the full-blown flowers of our British female aristocracy.
A few duchesses, marchionesses, countesses, and other married ladies
of rank may misunderstand it to be addressed to them. As dowagers
only can it be supposed to be meant to catch the eye of such ladies.
Its offer of pecuniary assistance, and purchase of plate and other
property, is evidently directed only to spinsters and widows of ths
superior classes. It is not a genteel equivalent of the Rag and Bone
Warehouse of the Slums. New Oxford Street is some yards from
Seven Dials. Madame S. K. L. is a good Samaritan of the softer sex,
and not an Israelitish female moneygrub. But even ladies of rank are
stupid or unprincipled in some instances. The Countess op Almacks
may be in want of money, owing to the stinginess of the Earl, her
husband, or even to her own unscrupulous extravagance. In Madame
S. K.L. she may apprehend an accommodating lady, who will befriend
ladies of quality in their hour of need, as Mr. Levi occasionally be-
friends lords. She is not disappointed—she obtains a loan—having for-
gotten to mention the Earl's name. The time for repayment arrives,
is deferred, and so on again and again: my lady is hopelessly insolvent.
The bill is presented to my Lord: who knows nothing about it, and
refuses to pay it. The amount is sued for; not in the County Court,
for it is considerably over £50, but in the Countess Court, so to
speak; the Court of Queen's Bench, or Common Pleas. The question
for that high tribunal to consider will be, whether or no his Lordship is
liable for the money?
Or my lady, keeping out of sight her wedding ring, may find in the
advertiser an Aunt in that degree of relationship wherein Mr. Balls,
of the sign of the Two-to-One, might be acknowledged as an Uncle by
her highborn husband, if that nobleman had accepted a loan at his
hands, depositing with him a valuable watch or two, or a quantity of
plate by way of security. Lady A. will, as persons of the lower classes
say, "unbeknown" to the Earl, perhaps have gone and "spouted,"
or sold a number of silver forks, spoons, tureens, and other utensils,
engraven with the Almacks crest and coronet. Hence also may arise
some litigation in the Courts abovenamed, and perhaps also in the
Probate and Divorce Court.
To secure the generous authoress of the foregoing announcement
from being imposed upon by peeresses and other ladies, who, having
their own lords to maintain them, can have no title to her munificence,
all dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons, and honourable gentle-
men, will do well to have a good look-out kept upon New Oxford
Street, and early information given of their ladies' carriages beheld
going in that direction. Addressing tlie watchers stationed to make
the necessary recognitions, the noble Earl op Almacks mav exercise
his fine voice in singing, up and down that questionable-looking
thoroughfare,
"Tell me, shepherds, tell me, have you seen
My Lady pass this way t
Unless the noble Earl does take some such precaul ion as that, he
may expect that his expensive Countess will, when in want of supplies,
have continual recourse to the beneficent Black Doll, the Aunt Sally
of the aristocracy, and there dispose of a good deal of the family plate,
if not dripping.
THE PARLIAMENT OF ART.
ccording to the word of
Mr. Benjamin Disraeli,
we nave each week to
report a Conversazione
which is held on Friday
evenings by the Parliament
of England; but we this
w eek have to notice a Con-
versazione which was held
on Wednesday evening by
l lie Parliament of Art. The
holding was not at St.
Stephen's, butat St. James's
Hall, a place of meeting
where the seats are quite as
soft as in the other place,
and (pecuniarily regarded)
far less hard to get into.
Representatives of nearly
all the arts attended: the
only marked exception
being that, although we
examined pretty closely, we
did not see a member of the
Art of Self-Defence. This noble art, however, formed a leading theme
of talk; and much interesting discussion took place upon the merits of
its champion professors, who had the day before contended for the
honour of first place.
But though the P.R, did not show, there was a goodly sprinkling of
the P.R.B.; and the absence of the great B.B., or Benicia Boy, was
atoned for by the presence of many smaller B.B.'s, or Brethren of the
Brush. Among them we observed the old hand that drew The Bottle,
and the young oue whose Black Brunsuicker will soon be brought to
public light. Members of the literary art were also present, among
whom might be noticed the Member for Mont Blanc, who had been
holding, as is his wont, a Conversazione of his own.
Further to distinguish it from Friday night assemblages, the meeting
was attended by some members of the music-stool, who we might say
much promoted the harmony of the evening, were we allowed to use so
novel and original a phrase. As these vocalists, however, were mainly
instrumental in getting up the gathering, we may just say by way of
compliment, that we thought them wort hy followers of the lead of Mr.
Benedict, who is not less benedictus with good temper than with good
taste.
We may moreover state, as a concluding commendation, that at the
St. James's Conversation, unlike those in St. Stephen's, the fair sex
were allowed a fair share in the chatter, an indulgence which they
really did not much abuse. Surely, then, we think the Parliament of
England might take a leaf out of the programme of the Parliament of
Art; and instead of cooping her behind the bars of a gilt birdcage,
might once a week let Lovely Woman, and her tongue, loose in'thc
House. How much pleasanter and more lively would the Friday
evenings be, if the great guns of the Commons let ladies share their
small talk: a privilege which, after our experience last Wednesday, we
really do incline to think might be conceded, without much fear and
trembling as to the result.

The Social Chronicle.
In consequence of the great and increasing amount of cases, the
decision of which daily devolves on the Court whose president is Sift
Ckesswell Cresswell, we understand that some of our contempo-
raries intend regidarly to publish, in addition to "Births, Deaths, aud
Marriages," a fourth column, under the head of "Divorces."

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ii e House met again
on Monday, April
10. When an ugly
ill-made, disagree-
able Baby whom no-
body really wanted
to see, is kept in
the drawing-room
by its absurdly par-
t lal Parent, and
makes a noise, to
the interruption of
profitable conversa-
tion, people say to
one another — or
look it, if they don't
Seak—"Why isn't that little Nuisance sent Up-StairsP" Now TJp-Stairs, in
ouse of Commons language, means a place where a Select Committee sits. The
House met to-night after the Easter and east-wind holidays (Mr. Punch shivers).
and Lord John's Poor Little Bill, which is aptly described abovr, was hinted
up-staira by Mr. Nf asset. This gentleman is a Liberal, and M. P. for Salford,
and Chairman of Ways and Means, and he gave notice that after the second reading
of the Bill he should move that it be referred to a Select Committee. What the
aggravated Parent thought of this proposition for getting rid of his objectionable
Pet, will be seen in Mr. Punch's record of what passed on Friday night in answer
to Mr. James. Nobody will say that the wretched little infant has not been
well physicked, for as will be observed, it has had James's powder in one place,
and a Grey powder in another.
Something very awful has been going on in the City, and the City correspondents
of the papers have been alluding to it most mysteriously, and with the immense
expenditure of circumbendibus which it seems the proper thiug to use when mone-
tary transactions are being mentioned. It would oe entirely beneath the dignity
of pecuniary history to say "Gcrney's, the discounting Quaker's, is offended
with the Bank of England, and has been collecting no end
of £1000 notes, and suddenly making the Bank fork out
uncommon," and we have had vast and portentous para-
graphs hinting and insinuating, and all that sort of thing.
Mammon's name is not to be lightly played with. What
the use of this mystification is, Mr. Punch is utterly igno-
rant. The City folks know all about the business without
being told, and if it be intended to inform other than City
folks, why not be explicit P To-night Mr. Alderman
Salomons gave notice that he should ask Mr. Gladstone
about it, and did so on Thursday, when the C. of the X.
said that he had been talking to the parties, and the Quaker
house considered that it had a perfect right to do as it
pleased. As it is Mr. Gladstone's business, he being
Government, to see that the interests of the public are
protected, and as he did not say that he had ordered the
Attorney-General to get Gcrney's executed on Tower
Hill, we presume that nothing wrong has been done,
though the object seems to have been to serve the Bank
out. The Times, however, recals a case in which somebody
else once did something of the kind, and came to remark-
able grief, at the hands of law, and if Commerce is at once
the delicate and important thing mercantile folks call it,
there may be a question how far Banks of England or Dis-
count Houses have a right, as good citizens, to cause
perturbation in the money market.
The whole of the night was taken up with discussions
connected with or arising upon the Navy Estimates. Sir
H. Leeke stated that the sailors did not wish to see the
Cat entirely done away with, and that they occasionally
requested Captains to flog the bad men among them.
Even if this be true, it is something new for legislative
swells to go to common sailors for advice as to the
management of the Navy; a remark which Mr. Punch
trusts will stop that Leak from letting in nonsense for the

future. Now, Ladies, if you please, attention. The Census is going
to be taken again, so make up your minds how old you mean to assert
yourselves to be. You had better, if possible, remember, or find out,
how old you called yourselves Ten years ago, and on the whole it may
be prudent, as a general rule, not to write yourselves down very much
younger now than you said you were in 1851. Recollect, the officials
will be able to refer to your former statements, and you will not look
exactly pleased, dear Angelina, when Edwin is called upon to explain
why, as Head of the Family, he has declared you to have been 35 in
1851 and 29 in 1861. Mr. Punch, ever woman's truest friend, is thus
early with his affectionate warning. Mb. Clive brought in the Census
Bill this evening.
Tuesday. Such of the Lords as were not too tired, after seeing the
Fight (which took place this morning near Farnborough, when Sir
Thomas De Sateks and the Count de Benicia bravely battled for
two hours and twenty minutes in presence of Dukes, Lords, Members
of Parliament, Officers, "Authors, Poets, Painters, Doctors, and Clergy-
men"), met and read, a second time, the Bill for improvinsr the Divorce
Court. The arrears are heavy, for out of 539 cases only 177 have been
disposed of. It is proposed to give Sir Cresswell power to do more of
the work single-handed. Lord Redesdale talked some bosh about the
new system having done much to diminish respect for the institution
of marriage, an allegation which he supported by stating that people
made jokes about divorce, and that comic allusions were made to it in
the theatres. Punch never argues with a Pump. But Lord Redes-
dale is a mighty hunter. Does he think that the British veneration
for the institution of fox-hunting is diminished because at the theatre
people roar at the feats of the basket-work horses P He can understand
that query, one would hope.
The Commons seem to have tired themselves with going to the
Fiitht, for t hey sat for little more than an hour. Mr. Hadfield inter-
pellated (a handsome long word that.) Sir G. C. Lewis about the
encounter, and was gravely told, that if the battle had been fought, of
which Sir George had no official knowledge, it must have taken place
beyond the jurisdiction of the metropolitan police, and he did not know
whether the county police had been present or not. Later, we presume,
Sir George bought a copy of the extra edition of Bell's life, and got
up the details in time to shine on the subject at dinner. For there has
seldom been so much fighting talk in fashionable circles as to-night,
probably never so much since the news came of another conflict,
whereof Tommy Moore wrote :—
*' O shade of the Cheesemonger, you who, alas.
Doubled up, by the dozen, those Mounseors in bras,
On that great day of milling, when blood lay in laker,
When Kings held the bottle, and Europe the stakes.*'
Wednesday. Mr. Collier's Bill for making it unlawful to convey
voters to the poll was debated, and the debate adjourned. Mr. Punch
has a notion that gentlemen of property do not like this interference
with making their long purses useful in a contest. They talk very
kindly and decorously, of course, about the hardship of disfranchising
the poorer voter who cannot afford to hire a conveyance. A new green
tint has just been discovered and is making a sensation, but Mr. Punch
is justified in stating that the discovery was not made in his eye. The
Bill for Elevating the lawyers was read a second time by 191 to 29,
numbers which show the influence the fraternity has in the House.
The Bill has some good points, especially educational provisions, but
some precious bad ones, for it will let in attorneys who have not been
articled, and will allow the profession to charge interest on their inf—
on their bills of costs. A Bill for letting Jews into Parliament in a
more brief and civil manner than now, was read a second time by 117
to 75; but if we know the titled descendants of Front de Bceuf
Jlamode and his contemporaries, they will retain this last little bit of
unpleasantness for the posterity of Isaac of York.
Thursday. The Descendants above mentioned held a Reform Bill
Debate. They have taken the Bull, or rather Bill, by the horns, and
mean, if possible, to make them the horns of a dilemna. Earl Grey
moved for a Select Committee to inquire what increase would be made
in the number of electors by reducing the franchise, and what sort of
folks, socially considered, would come in, and to investigate, generally,
Election matters, specially inquiring in what way the elections for
huge constituencies are managed, and by what kind of clique. He
made no secret of his wanting this information to enable him to deal
with the coming Reform Bill, as the present returns were good for
nothing, and at least twice as many new votes would be created as
Lord John Russell had supposed. Lord Grey declared himself
opposed to extension of the franchise, probably thinking that his father
had done enough in that line. The Ddke or Argyll defended the
returns, but would not oppose the motion provided that it did not
mean a shelving of the Reform Bill. He had the candour (and Mr.
Punch hereby pats the Golden-haired on his Ducal head) to bear testi-
mony to the merits of Mr. Disraeli's Reform Bill, which was
destroyed, not on those merits, but in a party fight. Lord Derby
came out strong, condemned a good deal of the Poor Little Bill, and
announced that, though he should regret to have to put it to death, he
should feel it his painful duty to try to do so, if it came up in its
present form. It was two Uns and a Nin,—that is to say, Unsatis-
factory, Unstatesmanlike, and Inconclusive. It was designed to givo
power to those whom it had been sought to persuade that the upper
classes were their enemies. Lord Granville undertook that the
Government returns should be defended in Committee. The Select
Committee was appointed.
In the Commons, Mr. Horsman delivered another pitch into the
Emperor of the French and Savoyards, and also into Lord John
Russell, and Mr. Doff abused Lord Cowley. Lord John rebuked
Horsman, and said that if Government were let alone they would
manage everything properly, and Lord Palmerston and his private
secretary flared «p for Cowley. Pam alwavs stands by his friends,
like a man. So does Mr. Punch, upon similar but infinitely grander
grounds, for to be the friend of Mr. Punch argues a person to oe pos-
sessed (like a Freemason) of every Social and Moral Virtue, and also
to have Genius, Elegance, and a taste for the best cigars. The rest of
the Navy Estimates were taken, and then came short debates, on
various subjects, each discussion ending in a row over the question
of adjournment, finally performed at two in the morning of
Friday. Lots of petitions against the Sunday peripatetic Bawlers
and Yelpers, and then a good little bit of fun. Lord Normanby had
given notice of a motion virtually censuring Lord Cowley about his
private correspondence with Lord John Russell on the Savoy
business. Lord Cowley, who had no notion of letting his reputation
be pawed and pulled about by the antiquated fribble, starts from Paris
to be ready to confront him, and Normanby states that his intended
victim is now at Calais." "Is he, by Jove !" says Lord Granville,
reading out a telegram from Dover, announcing that Cowley is there,
and coming on by the next train. So Lord Normanby has to post-
pone his motion until Lord Cowley's arrival, and meantime protests
that he really did not mean any particular censure. If, after taking
t he trouble to come all that way in this abominable weather to wop
Normanby, Cowley does not give it him hot and hot, he had better
have stopped in Paris, as the idea of its being necessary for him or any-
body else to defend himself from Normanby's ludicrous onslaught is
out of the question. He had, later in the sitting, to retract and
apologise for another of the heap of charges the cackling old party has
brought against Italian gentlemen.
In the Commons, among the usual mass of petitions, some were
amusing. Wretched Welsh villages, with unpronounceable names,
petitioned against the Wine Licences Bill—places where there has
probably never been a drop of wine drunk in sociality since the day
when the Welsh language was created, at the Confusion of Tongues,
by a trowel full of the Babel mortar falling into the upturned and open
mouth of a bricklayer, whose splutter of wrath and dismay became
t he Welsh as now spoken. Captain Gordon gave a notice that the
House had no sound information on which to go reforming. Mr.
Miller complained that boys were sent to prison for playing games in
the streets, and the Home Secretary, submitting that it was rather
a bore to have your valuable horse thrown down by an iron hoop, or
your valuable eye poked out by a tip-cat, wished he could whip the
boys instead of locking them up, but feared the law did not recognise
the birch. As for old Smithfield, there seems a muddled title to it,
and a compromise has been made; a portion of the site is to be a dead
meat market, but the portion belonging to the Crown is to be " dedicated
to the general purposes of the public."
More fun about the Fight.—Mr. Ewart admitted but deplored the
interest taken in the matter, and wanted to know what power the law
had to deal with such doings. Mr. Vincent Scully, under pretence
of denouncing the business, explained in the hoight of glory and joy,
that Sayers, Heenan, and Mr. Morrisey (who beat Heenan in
America) were all of Irish origin. The Home Secretary was evi-
dently much amused, but stated with extreme precision the grounds on
which some persons uphold the ring, remarked that he had no doubt
that a fight was unlawful, but that it was not the habit of Government
to prosecute such offenders, though it was open to the local authorities
to do so if they liked. Our classical Home Secretary clearly has no
malice against our Dares and Entellcs.
To Mr. James, demanding what Government meant to do in refer-
ence to Mr. Massey's motion, Lord John replied that ne should
oppose it, of course, considering it as intended to destroy the Reform
Bill.
The Queen's Proclamation, recommending her subjects to be Pious
and Virtuous, is to be revised, Mr. Punch presumes in accordance with
the necessities of the times, which make it difficult for anybody, except
himself, to be either. The Paper Duty Repeal went through Com-
mittee, as did part of the Customs Bill; and Mr. Sam Slick gave
Mr. Gladstone a great scolding for alleged ill-treatment of British
North America, where, he said, there were 3,000,000 of highly superior
people, whose representations were utterly despised by those who
desired to give votes to 'the unrepresented rabble of England."
Mb. Gladstone protested his innocence, and the rejection of an
amendment by the Clockmaker wound up the week.

thing but "parfait amour." In fact, he doubts
whether it is a cordial at all—of late it has been
nothing but a species of bitters.
INFALLIBLE ARGUMENTS.
eridbrs of thePopfc's
Bull, our contempo-
rary, the Tablet, is
very wroth with you.
Roman Catholics in
general are terribly
offended by any ridi-
cule of their persua-
sions. This is a pecu-
liarity which they
share with Mesme-
rists, Spirit-Rappers,
and Astrologers, and
not with philosophers
and men of science.
A chemist is not
angry with a shallow
; public for laughing
at any wonderful dis-
covery which he may
happen to publish.
The derisive incre-
dulity of ignorance
does not vex an
astronomer when the
marvels of the visible
heavens which he dis-
closes are received with smiles. Men who know that what they say is true can
afford to be laughed at. Men whose belief is mainly sentimental, if it is made fun
of, get into a rage.
Why do not such good Catholics as the writers in the Tablet weep for the poor
silly sinners who scoff at the Papal Excommunication P If such wretches are out
of the pale of 1 heir charity, why do they not treat them with contempt? Why
pour vials of idle wrath upon their devoted heads? Why not be content to
asperse them with holy water?
After abusing the scorners of Infallibility's anathema, the Tablet proceeds to
enumerate certain personages who incurred, it, and thus relates how they expe-
rienced its fulfilment:—
M The Emptro pwwd out of the House of Barbaro&sa, to tho family of Hapsbourg: Lor is or
Bavaria never obtained it.. Philip the Fair did not prosper, his family became extinct in less
than thirty .Tears, and the throne of France passed to tho Bouse of Valoia. Henry tiir Eiohth
had no legitimate grandchi d to succoed him, and the first Emperor left no successor in the
modern empire of the French. These men were all oxcommunicated by the Sovereign Pontiff,
and their memory is .n execration to this day."

As to Henry the Eighth, his memory is cherished by
numerous Englishmen, who fondly denominate him "Bluff
Kino Hal." Those Britous who do extcrate his memory
in general, revere precisely so much of it as regards his
defiance of the Pope. As to that eminent murderer, robber,
and liar, the first Napoleon, nobody execrates his memory
but a few thinking men: the greater part of the world
calls that monster of wickedness, Napoleon the Great,
and the French worship him for his crimes. What sort of
a heavenly vengeance is the passage of sovereign power
from one house to another—a calamity which oefel the
Stuarts, by the way, and is, by Protestant zealots, regarded
as Heaven's revenge against Popery. What divine punish-
ment is non-accession to a throne; and what is the extinction
of a line in thirty or in any number of years? The former
calamity has befallen no end of princes; and the latter has
just overtaken the Catholic Earls op Shrewsbury.
Victor Emmanuel and Louis Napoleon will doubtless
meet with reverses. If they had received the papal bene-
diction, any misfortune which might happen to them would
be represented by the Tablet as a divine favour. Now
they have been excommunicated, or are supposed to be, the
Tablet will set down all the troubles which they may
encounter, to divine displeasure. They will both die some
day; if soon, the Tablet will ascribe their death to the
Pope's curse; if at a good old age they depart this life,
our Catholic contemporary will asseverate that excommu-
nication has smitten them in the other. Thus it must be
manifest that no earthly contingency can ever confute the
Popb.
National Spirit of the Licensed Witlers.
Those disinterested gentlemen, whose patriotism is as
unadulterated as their porter, oppose the Wine Refresh-
ment Bill, on purely national grounds. They declare that
their opposition is entirely pro bono publico—and we believe
them,for it is exclusively "for the benefit of the Public;"
only it must be clearly understood that the Public in this
instance means the Public-house.
A DUMMY IDEA.
The question "What is a Boy P " which has been raised
by a preceptor, naturally suggests the corresponding inquiry,
"What is a Girl P" The answer is obvious. A girl is a
female framework supporting an extension of clothes.

THE FIGHT OF SAYEBJUS AND
HEENANUS.
A LAY OF ANCIENT LONDON.
{Supposed to be recounted to his Great-Orand-
ehildren, April 17th, a.d. 1920, by an Ancient
Gladiator.)
Close round my chair, my children,
And sat her at my knee,
The while your muther poureth
The Old Tom in my tea;
The while your father quaffeth
His meagre Bordeaux wine,—
'Twas not on such potations
Were reared these thews o' mine.
Such drinks came in the very year
—Methiuks I mind it well—
That the great fight of Heenanus
With Saterius befell.
These knuckles then were iron;
This biceps like a cord;
This fist shot from the shoulder
A bullock would have floored.
Crawluus his Novice,
They used to call me then,
In the Domus Savilliana,
Among the sporting men.
There, on benefit occasions,
The gloves I oft put on,
Walking round to show my muscles
When the set-to was done;
While ringing in the arena
The showered denarii fell.
That told Crawleius, Novice
Had used his mauleys well.
'Tis but some sixty years since
The times whereof I speak,
And yet the words I'm using
Will sound to you like Greek.
What know ye, race of milksops.
Untaught of the P. IL,
What stopping, lunging, countering,
Fibbing, or rallying are P
What, boots to use the lingo.
When you have not the thing?
How paint to you the glories
Of DE1.CHER, CR1BB, Or Sl-RING,—
To you, whose sire turns up his eyes
At mention of the Ring r
Yet, in despite of all the jaw
And gammon of the time.
That brands the art of self-defence
—Old England's art—as crime,
From off mine ancient memories
The rust of time I'll shake,
Your youthful bloods to quicken
And your British pluck to wake.
I know it only slumbers;
Let cant do what it will,
The British bull-dog will be
The British bull-dog still.
Then gather to your grandsire's knee,
The while his tale is told,
How Say tin us and Heenanus
Milled in the days of old.
The Beaks and Blues were watching,
Agog to stop the Mill,
As we gathered to the station
In the April morning chill.
By twos and threes, by fours and tens,
To London Bridge we drew;
For we had had the office,
That were good men and true;
And, saving such, the place of fight
Was ne'er a man that knew.
From east and west, from north and south,
The London Fancy poured,
Down to the sporting Cabman,
Up to the sporting Lord.
From the Horse-Sboe in Titchfield Street,
Sharp Owen Swift was there;
Old Peter left the Rising Sun,
All in the street of Air;
Langhah forsook his beer-taps,
With nobby Alec Reed;
And towering high above the crowd
Shone Ben Caunt's fragrant weed.
Nor only fighting covies,
But sporting swells besides,—
Dukes, Lords, M P.s, and Guardsmen,
With county beaks for guides;
And tongues that sway our Senators,
And hands the pen that wield,
Were cheering on the champions
Upon that morning's field.
At last the bell is ringing,
The engine puffs amain,
And through the dark towards Brighton
On shrieks the tearing train;
But turning off where iWgate
Unites her clustering lines,
By poultry-haunted Dorking
A devious course it twines;
By Wotton, Shier, and Guildford,
Across the winding Wey,
Till by heath-girded rarnborough
Our doubling course we stay,
Where Aldershott lay snoring
All in the morning grey,
Nor dreamed the Camp what combat
Should be fought here to-day!
The stakes are pitched, the ropes are tied,
The men have ta'en t heir stand;
Heenanus wins the toss for place,
And takes the eastward hand.
Cusiccius and Macdonaldus
Upon the Boy attend;
Sayerius owus Bruntonus,
And Jim Welsiiius for friend.
And each upon the other now
A curious eye may throw,
As from the seconds' final rub
In buff at. length they show,
And from their corners to the scratch
Move stalwartly and slow.
Then each his hand stretched forth to grasp,
His foemen's fives in friendly clasp;
Each felt his balance trim and true,—
Eicli up to square his mauleys threw;
Each tried his best to draw his man—
The feint, the dodge, the opening plan,
Till left, and right Sayekius tried;
Heenanus' grin proclaimed him wide;
He shook his nut, a lead essayed,
Nor reached Sayerius' watchful head.
At length each left, is sudden flung,
We heard the ponderous thud,
And from each tongue the news was rung,
Sayekius hath "Eirst blood!"
Adowu Heenanus* Roman nose
Freely the tell-tale claret flows,
While stem Sayerius' forehead shows
That, in the interchange of blows
Heenanus' aim was good!
Again each iron n.auley swung,
And loud i tie counier-hitting rung,
Till breathless all, and wild with blows,
Fiercely they grappled for a close;
A moment, in close hug they swing
Hither and tnither, round the ring,
Then from Heenanus' clinch of brass
Sayerius, smiling, slips to grass!
I trow mine ancient breath would fail
To follow through the fight,
Each gallant round's still changing tale,
Each feat of left and right.
How through two well-spent hours and more,
Through bruise, and blow, and blood,
Like sturdy bulldogs, as they were,
Those well-mat died heroes stood.
How nine times in that desperate Mill
Heenanus, in his strength,
Knocked stout Sayerius off his pins,
And laid him all at length;
But how in each succeeding round
Sayerius smiling came,
With head as cool, and wind as sound,
As his first moment on the ground,
Still confident, and game.
How from Heenanus' sledge-like fist,
Striving a smasher to resist,
Sayerius' stout right arm gave way,
Yet the maim'd hero still made play,
And when in-fighting threatened ill,
Was nimble in out-fighting still,
Did still his own maintain—
In mourning put 11 ken an us' glims;
Till blinded eyes and helpless Limbs,
The chances squared again.
How blind Heenanus in despite
Of bleeding mug and waning sight
So gallantly kept up the fight,
That not a man could say
Which of the two 'twere wise to back,
Or on which side some random crack
Might not decide the day:
And leave us—whoso won the prize,—
Victor and vanquished, in all eyes,
An equal meed to pay.
Two hours and more the fight had sped,
Near unto ten it drew,
But still opposed—one-armed to blind,—■
They stood, the dauntless two.
Ah, me, that I have lived to hear
Such men as ruffians scorned.
Such deeds of valour brutal called,
Canted, preached down, and mourned 1
Ah, that these old eyes ne'er again
A gallant. Mill shall see!
No more behold t he ropes and stakes,
With colours flying free!
But. I forget the combat—
How shall I fell the close,
That left the Champion's Belt in doubt
Between those well-matched foes?
Fain would I shroud the tale in night,—
The meddling Blues that thrust in sight,—
j The ring-keepers o'erthrown;—
The broken ring,—the cumbered fight,—
Heenanus' sudden, bliuded flight,—
Sayerius pausing, as he might,
Just when ten minutes used aright
Had made the fight his own!
Alas! e'en in those brighter days
We still had Beaks and Blues,—
Still, canting rogues, their mud to fling
On self-defence and on the Ring,
And fistic arts abuse!
And 'twas such varmint had the power
The Champion's fight to stay,
And leave unsettled to this hour
The honours of the day!
But, had those honours rested
Divided as was due,
Sayerius and Heenanus
Had cut the Belt in two.
And now my fists are feeble,
And my blood is thin and cold,
But. 'tis better than Old Tom to me
To recall those da>s of old.
And may you, my great-grandchildren,
'1 hat gather round my knee,
Ne'er see worse men or iller times
Than I and mine might be,
Though England then had prize-fighters—
Even reprobates like me.




A Blessing to Reporters.
A Deputation waited on Mr. Milner
Gibson to complain of the fraudulent system
of "short-lengths" as practised in the cotton
trade. We wish that Honourable Members,
when they are spinning long yarns in Par-
liament, would be equally guilty of "short-
lenglhs."

"Why not do as others do—send little puff paragraphs round the
country—have hints, and casual references of admiration, and allusions
in articles on other subjects—surely this bold-faced Puff, in Punch
itself, is somewhat audacious."—"No doubt. But inasmuch as it is
the very best advertisement in the whole universal world, Mr. Punch is
happy to accord it to Once a Week."—" No one but Mr. Punch would
be capable of so truly grand an act."—" Indeed you are right, my
friend, wherefore let us liquor."
FRENCH FASHIONS OF SPEECH.
Ever since Bonaparte, the other day, called Tuscany an "auto-
nomy," the Continental press has kept repeating that word, which is
now getting tiresome from its continual recurrence. Every beggarly
little district in Europe that manages its own affairs in any measure, is
dignified with the name of an "autonomy." We hope that we shall
not have our own native tongue infected with this affectation of French
Greek nomenclature. We trust that our glorious Marylebone Vestry
will persevere in terming the great, principle of their constitution,
which they are ready to die for, if necessary, local self-government,
and not exchange that orthodox parochialism for such an un-English
expression as "topical autonomy." #

at the same time blinding and darkening him, by bunging up and

Near, by computation, three hundred thousand pounds!

He was greatly trusted—better far than known;
How those men were dozing passes all belief,
Confidence reposing in so grand a thief.

Bow to your superior—kiss the ground he treads.
What are you before him, frisking tills and dies?
Grovel and adore him, prigs of smaller size.
Blush for your offences, burglars at the crank,
Thinking how immense his pillage of the Bank;
Shamed by his large plunder, convicts of the Road,
Trip the treadmill under guilt of lighter load.

Beat before the traitor; lo, he comes, he comes!

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
April 24, Monday. Cowley, from Paris, entered the ring at five
o'clock, to the immense disgust of Normanbt, who, however, was
obliged to fight, though there was so little confidence in him that he
could not even get a second. He advanced to Cowley, cackled foolishly,
and struck out feebly, never getting home once. Cowley let him go
on at this sort of thing for some time, and then went at him, drew
claret, followed him up, and, hitting out straight, completely floored
him, amid loud cheers. Granville interposed, chaffed poor Nor-
mansy a little upon his imbecile love of provoking stronger men than
himself, and there was an end to the affair. Malmesbury declared
that Cowley had shown himself one of the right sort, but abused
John Russell, who could not be there. Normanby picked himself
up, grumbling, and the assembly dispersed. Cowley was so little hurt
that he went off by special train the same night to Dover, and next
morning crossed to Boulogne in the new mail packet John Pcnn, "in a
fresh breeze and swell," in 97 minutes. Normanby's friends ought to
prevent him from making such exhibitions of himself.
In the Commons, Mr. Hassey said that as Lord John Russell
took the intended motion for a Select Committee on the Reform Bill
so much to heart, it should not be pressed. The debate on the Second
Reading was resumed by Mr. Edwin James, who, being a supporter
of Government, pitched into the Bill in every way, and insisted upon
his grand point, namely, that thousands on thousands of votes, in
addition to those calculated on by Lord John Russell, would be
created. Mr. Hardy pointed out the double-faced nature of the Bill,
which was alternately declared to be much too large and much too
small. Then up got Sir George Lewis, Home Secretary, to do his
best for the Bill, and he successfully established the following pro-
positions.
First. That Lord John Russell, at all events, knows nothing
about the numerical question, and had made a blunder (in Sir George's
judgment) to the extent of about 50,000 votes.
Secondly, that the Bill doubles the existing number of Voters, Sir
George himself stating the increase to be something under 400,000.
Thirdly, that Mr. Edwin Jakes has enraged the Ministry in the
most awful manner, and much improved his chances of receiving the
Solicitor-Generalship at their hands.
Lord Robert Montagu drew an ugly picture of the sort of
American assembly he believed the House would become if the Bill
passed, which vaticination was simply nonsense. Lord Robert
Cecil urged the more sensible objection, that it was dangerous lo
entrust the power of taxation to the uneducated, who would naturally
say, as women do: "Stuff and nonsense about direct and indirect; the
rich have plenty of money, and ought to pay for the poor who haven't."
Of the two Bob, therefore, Mr. Punch nails the first to the counter,
and passes the second. Mr. Monckton Milnes admitted that there
was no noise about Reform, and tfiat the beating of the people's own
hearts was all the sound we heard, but he thought those hearts were set
on an extension of the franchise. He condemned the exclusion of the
educational qualification. Mr. Peacocke spread out a handsome
tale about eminent men who distinguished themselves as members for
small boroughs, but became mere delegates when returned for large
places. Mr. Thomson had studied the Seasons for political change,
and thought this was one of them. Mr. Newdegate warned the
Lords against passing the Bill, unless more power were given to the
counties, which would be swamped by the boroughs.
There was an adjournment squabble, utterly beneath Mr. Punch's
notice, but for his having received the following telegrams:—
Torydom is ra Revolt against King Disraeli II.
Bentinck Pretends to the Throne.
The Quarterly Review has Pronounced against the King.
Fearful scenes are expected, and an indication of the rebellion (for
a straw—one of those of which Bentinck is made—will, if thrown up,
show the way of the wind) might have been noted to-night, when Mr.
Disraeli said, that those with whom be acted would not divide against
the Bill, and Mr. Bentinck, supposed to be one of "those," rose and
protested against any such compact, and said that he and his friends
were not going to be bound by any arrangement between the front
benches. The debate was adjourned. Mr. Punch recommends the
VOL. XXXVIII.

PUNCH'S ADDRESS TO HIS TORIES.
"Dull men, in the country bred,
Dolts, whom Diz has often led,
If you lose your daring Head,
Farewell victory.
Twice you've seen the day and hour,
When he dragged you into power;
That's a grape you 'II long find sour,
If unhelped by D.
Who's to lead you P Henley grave P
Classic Lytton, Whiteside brave P
Walpole, victim to the Shave P
Where's your man but B. P
Who creates the promptest raw,
Pam himself dares strongly jaw,
Gladstone's figures, Bethbll's law,
Treats contemptuously P
Lay such pumps as Bentinck low,
Close your ranks in sturdy row,
Will you lose your Chieftain P No.
Five Disraeli!"
At least, if they mean to, show any sport for the future, and not be a
mere grumbling, growling, protesting lot, hindering a little hut never
acting, the Party will think twice before yielding to the arrogant,
aristocratic asinine jealousy that always sets itself against a leader whose
name is not in the Peerage. However, it is their business, not Mr.
Punch's, who occasionally finds them worth licking while they have a
Head, but will have only to laugh at them in the absence of that
article.
Tuesday. The Lords read, a second time, Lord Campbell's Bill for
infusing a little Equity into Law. The old Equity men (you wouldn't
think that Mr. Punch means Chancery men, but such is the corruption
of language) do not like the change, so it may be inferred that it is for
the good of the public.
The Commons debate was an olla podrida. Mb. A. Smith (not he
of Mont Blanc) complained of the Queen going at low water between
the sea, which is hers, and private land, which is not, and claiming a
right over the intermediate space. Sir Richard Bethell flared up
for his Royal Mistress, and showed that, as usual, all that she had done
was in the interest of the public. If Smith wants to pick up sand
eels and crabs, there is no objection to his filling his hat with them,
but it is in the highest degree impertinent of him to interfere with his
Sovereign. His motion for a Committee on the subject was squashed.
A long Museum debate followed, everybody having views of his own
about the collection. Lord Palmerston said it was all a question of
money, and rather seemed to think that the best way would be to clear
out all the stuffed creatures and the rest of the Natural History, and
so leave room for articles of human manufacture. Mr. Punch does not
entirely concur. Statues, monumental tablets, classical friezes, vases,
and sarcophagi are less interesting to the masses than the study of
nat ural history. People who are blessed with a taste for the former
articles are usually also blessed with wheeled carriages, or at least
with threepence to ride on the top of an omnibus, a remark which by
no means applies to their humbler fellow citizens. Argal, keep the
popular collection within reach of the people, and let the antiquities be
sent elsewhere—stuck over Primrose Hill, or erected at Brompton, if
there is no better place. The London Corporation Bill was read a
second time, Mr. Ayrton delivering an awfully long speech, proving,
from the history of JSneas's brother, that the Tower Hamlets ought to
be part of the City of London. The Census Bill, Ladies, was also
read a second time, Mr. Baines complaining that it made it necessary
for a man to say what religion he professed. We dare say, dears, that
you think this a much smaller grievance than your owe
Wednesday. The Law of Property Bill was discussed in a debate of
great importance and extreme dryness. ,
Thursday. The Bishop op London came out strong with a Bill for
re-arranging benefices that are not beneficial to the people, and for
carrying away churches that are useless, and putting them in more
advantageous positions.
The Reform Debate was resumed in the Commons. Mr. Black, a
Liberal, abused it. Sir Edward Btjlwer Lytton delivered a set
oration, of great splendour, auainst it. Mr. Marsh, as a Reformer,
could not support it. Sir J. Ferguson also attacked it. At length a
speaker arose in its favour, Mr, Denman, who praised it, and then
proceeded to show its incompleteness. Sir J. Walsh attacked it as a
Household Suffrage Bill; and then Lord John Russell, in wrath,
rushed in to the rescue of his ill-used Pet. and declared it was a lovely
Bill. He said Mr. Edwin James's blunder was "ludicrous i"
defended his measure on the two grounds, that it would let in a mass
of the working classes, and that it wouldn't: misquoted Mr. Disraeli
and was set right amid the laughter of the House; and warned people
that if this Reform were not conceded we might see an Ugly Rush—
not him at Madame Tussaud's, but one predicted last year by
Mr. Henley. The rebel Bentinck. then moved the adjournment of
the Debate.
Friday. A neat little spar between the Puseyite Lord Dunoannon.
and the Bishop op Carlisle, (who as the Honourable and Reverend
Mr, Villi eus was the pet of the young ladies of Mid-London,) excited
some attention, though it was only about the spiritual necessities of
the diocese of Durham.
In the Commons, the Reform Bill returns were again discussed, and
most of the speakers (Lord Stanley an exception) declared them
inaccurate. Sir Charles Wood said, that instructions had been given
to find out the names of some vulgar snobs and snobbesses from England,
who lately misconducted themselves in a place of Mahometan worship
at Cairo, and Mr. Punch pledges himself, should the parties be dis-
covered, to make them remember their brutality. Lord John
Russell said that there was going to be a Conference of the Eight
Powers about Savoy, but its jurisdiction was infinitesimal.
Three crack speeches were delivered by Mr, Whiteside, Mr.
Bright, and Mr. Disraeli on the Trelawny Bill for abolishing
Church-Rates, and then, on division, the Second Rending was carried
by the tiny majority of 9—namely, 285 to 226. The Conservatives
actually shouted for more than five minutes at this dwindling down of
the usual majority, and they consider the Bill smashed, and rather
expect that a few Churches will be left standing in England for a few
years to come.

A LADY'S LETTER.

*' Dear! dear! you men! Wliat selfish things you are! Always
thinking of yourselves, and studying and scheming to promote your
creature comforts. I declare, Mr. Punch, it's quite shameful of you.
that it is. What with your Big Ships, and your breech-loaders, ana
your Armstrong guns and things, there's scarcely a day passes without
our hearing of your making new inventions for yourselves, and yon
never think of dreaming to invent us anything!
"Why there, this very morning I've just learnt of a new luxury
that you've invented for yourselves, and I can't help sitting down and
asking what you mean by it. You've been getting up. I see, a 'Dis-
trict Telegraph Company,' by which you mean to send your messages
1 to all parts of London,' at least to all parts that will be of any service
to yourselves. By the card which Mr. Smith brought home last night
in his pocket (he came home rather late, and so I looked at it while he
was snoring at half-past eight o'clock, a.m.!! but it really is disgraceful
how you idlers waste your time), I see you can send messages of ten
words each, for fourpence, and to get an answer back will only cost you
twopence more. But, cheap as is the price of it, of course you'll all
go spending mints of money in your messaging. For you know you're
just like children when you've some new plaything given you, and
can't keep your hands off it for ever such a while. I expect your men
of business, as you charitably call them, will go telegramming to each
other a dozen times a day, and saying how things go in the West-end
or the City, and whether 'Funds are firm,' or 'Ministers are shaky,'
and whether 'tallow's looking better,' or ' sugar's sinking fast.' Of
course, too, your men of fashion, who have nothing else to do but to
walk about in Wegent Sttceet, and stroke their tchiskatcs and mous-
taches, will be—aw—deuced glad of the—aw—Disttcict Telegicaphs, as
they will doubtless call them. Sending messages to fellahs will be a
way of killing time, and in addition to the news that money's 'getting
tight,' the message will be sent that men are going 'on the loose,' and
Jack or Tom or Harry will be telegrammed to meet them.
"No doubt you '11 say, the wires will be open to the ladies as well as
to the gentlemen, and that you don't mean to monopolise the use of
them. But this is the most mean and paltry of excuses. Just as if
we women ever wanted to send telegrams! Why, I declare at the
very sight of them one gets frightened into fits, and feels sure that
something dreadful must certainly have happened. Besides, you clearly
don't intend the District Telegraphs for us. You've been placing all
the Stations just where only men can get at them. There's not a single
one at the Soho Bazaar, or at any other point where women most do
congregate. What's the good of opening offices at your Deptfords
and your Docks, if you intend that ladies are to have the use of them.
todies don't go shopping in your Stock Exchange, and Lloyds, and your
Mark and Mincing Lanes, indeed, and places that one never even heard
the name of! To be of any service to us, stations should be made at
all the milliners' and bonnet-shops, so that one could order them to
alter one's new dress and things, without having the nuisance of going
to consult about it.
"I remain, Sir, Yours despairingly,

TRULY SPIRITED CAPITALISTS.
Amokg other interesting particulars of foreign intelligence, a con-
temporary, the other day, announced that:—
"The Duke or Modena has offered hia little army to tno Pope. Tbo Papal
Government is trying to contract a loan of 60,000,000 fr. The Rothschilds refuse
to negotiate it." •
The presentation of the Duke of Modena's little army to the Pope
is no doubt the best investment that his Royal Grace could make of it
under existing circumstances. The Messrs. Rothschild probably
could find a more profitable, or at least a more promising speculation
than that of a Papal loan. But shall we suppose that the idea of
lending his Holiness money was regarded by those princely capitalists
as a mere question of shekels? Can we imagine them to have con-
sidered it solely with reference to the amount per cent, offered by the
Pontifical Government, and the likelihood of getting it, or even of ever
seeing their capital again P No; the idea of assisting, with a loan of
50,000.000 francs, the kidnapper of the little Mortara, was doubtless
viewed by the great Rothschilds with an interest quite other and
higher than even cent, per cent. Could the Pope have offered tangible
security, however, there are certain considerations which might,
perhaps, have induced them to entertain his offer. A man in possession
at the Vatican would proclaim the House of Israel avenged.
Wood and Stone.
By proceedings which have been instituted in the ecclesiastical court
by Mr. Westbrton against the Hon. and Rev. R Liddrll, it appears
that, in contempt of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the
stone altar at St. Barnabas, Pimlico, is still retained, together with the
cross upon it. The Romanesque clergy and their parishioners seem
destined to remain at cross purposes.

A NEW IRONMONGERS' HALL.
Mr. Punch used occasionally to give his friend Mr. Panizzi a poke
or two, but since the erection of that unequalled reading-room, the
former has not had a word to say against the projector of such a boon.
Assuredly Mr. Punch is not going to complain of Mr. Panizzi for
doing something that has been made a grievance of. It seems that
some people wanted to compile an Ironmongers' Directory, and so,
instead of getting the other Directories, which may be had at any
coffee-house, they procure tickets for their clerks, and turn these
parties into the reading-room of the Museum, to copy out the names. Mr.
Panizzi good-naturedly allows this for some days, tmt as really there is
not more room than is wanted for real students, who come there for
books they cannot get elsewhere, he finally suggests that the clerks
might as well do their work at Peele's, or any similar place, as in a
national library. The literary ironmongers, or their employers, are in
a rage at this: but it appears to Mr. 1'uuch that this is one of the cases
in which the discretion of the trustees" is properly exercised for the
convenience of himself and the other great writers and students of the
day. Good gracious, suppose one of these ironmongery copyists had
taken the seat He usually occupies, which is Table number no,

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.

CHAPTER XIV.—PERIOD, THE REIGNS OF WILLIAM RUFUS,
HENRY THE FIRST, AND STEPHEN—(Continued).
iie love of novelty which marked
I he civil costume of this pe-
riod is likewise to be noticed
in the military habits, which
the pencil of our artist will now
help us to describe. "Avidus
novilatis est gent Anglicanus,"
writes one of the old monkish
historians of the time; and
what was said of the civilians
might be said too of the soldiers,
who, if not vain, were vane-like
in their constancy of change.
Their uniforms in fact were
anything but uniform, and
judging from their great va-
riety of armour, we should say
the army tailors had lots of
work cut out for them, and
like a travelling wild-beast-
show driver, drove a roaring
trade. We fancy hardly a day
passed without something new
in hauberks being shown in
some shop-window, and we
imagine what a rush there was
to see some novel nose-piece
which was said to be "on view"
in the Bond Street of the time.
How the three kings * whose names we use to head this chapter
armed themselves, we in a great measure may see from their great
seals. But as our readers very possibly have not (like us) had the
honour of receiving royal letters, perhaps they may not have inspected
many of the royal seals. Of the three which we now speak of we may
say, then, that the first represents Knio William Rufus in a suit of
armour, to which, without disparagement, we must apply the term of
"scaly." In lieu of the
nasal helmet, he wears one
somewhat like a Tartar's,
fitting closely to the head,
and sharply pointed at the
top. We find the Normans
called this a chapelle defer,
and hence we may in-fer
that it was made of iron;
although possibly, for
warmth, the lining of this
fer cap may have been made
of fur. The King carries a
fonfanon, or lance, and
iteshaped shield; and ex-
cepting that he sits on
horseback, his general ap-
pearance is much like that
of the small boy whom we
sketched from our own
nursery to show the cos-
tume of the infantry in our eleventh chapter.
Henry tiik First on his great seal is in a hauberk of fiat rings,
whereas Kino Stephen upon his is depicted in a hauberk of rings
which are set edgewise •, an improvement on the flat-ringed armour in
security, but a manifest impediment in point of added weight. This
extra heaviness however weighed but little on bis spirits, for the king,
as we shall see, was quite a "merry monarch," and heavy as was his
hauberk, we have no doubt he made light of it..
Another kind of mail in which about this period many male persons
indulged, may be seen upon the seal of Richard, Constable of Chester.
A mounted figure is here shown in what has been described as "tegu-
lated " armour, it being seemingly composed of small square plates of
steel, which overlap each other like tegula, or tiles. From underneath
the hauberk a long tunic is depicted, falling far below the feet, which
are thrust forward in the stirrups so as not to get entangled in it.
Whether this were so in life no one living can well say; but one's im-
pression from the seal is, that this long tunic must have been a needless
encumbrance to a horseman, hanging as it did, not unlike a lady's
riding habit, excepting that it did not even serve to hide the legs.

williau Bnrrs,
* The reader will, wo trust, not confound this regal trio with the famed "Threo
of Brentford;" though it might puzzle him more to point out who those three
were, than to mention who they wore not.

Besides these different sorts of armour several others were in use,
such as the "broigned" or "trelliced," the "rustred" and the
"banded:" names which
give so accurate a notion of
the fabrics that further to
describe them would be
clearly waste of time. Re-
ferring then the reader, if
need be, to his dictionary,
which will supply any de-
ficiency in fancy on his part,
we may notice that the col-
lar of the hauberk at this
period was drawn up over
the mouth, and being hook-
ed on to the nasal, gave the
joke-cracker a chance for
saying he had a hooked
nose. Whether this ar-
rangement interfered with
respiration we are without
sufficient evidence to state;
but the practice must at
any rate have been a hind-
rance in a sneezing-fit, and
snuff-takers must certainly have found it inconvenient. It is puzzling
to think too how men could blow their noses when their coat-collars
were hooked to them; and if the weather in King Stephen's reign
were as bad as has been lately, this want of nasal access must have
been a dreadful nuisance.
This custom of fastening the hauberk to the nasal being for these
reasons, or other such, discarded, a couple of steel cheekpieces were
added in the lieu of it. These were either fixed to and fell pendent
from the helmet, or else were independent of it, and were made as a
half-mask, having hooks to fasten them, and eyeholes for the eyes.
The Normans called them "ventailles," spelt otherwise "aventailles,"
a word which has led Cox, the learned Finsbury historian, to describe
them quite inaccurately as cheekguards "avin" tails."
Chins and cheeks and noses being thus protected, of all the face the
eyes were the only parts left visible, and although they might be shut,
were always open to attack. If ocular demonstration were needed to
prove this, it would be found in the description of the death of Hugh
the Proud, which, we need hardly tell our readers, happened on his
meeting with the King op Norway, who was called Magnus Bakb-
poot, perhaps from being a great bear. We learn from the Saga, Mag.
Burf. c. 11, (a writing which of course our readers must have read), that,
when this Monarch led his forces against England, near the Isle of
Anglesey he was met by two brave Earls, who being both named
Hugh, were nicknamed for distinction Hugh the Proud and Hugh
the Fat. The King, like the poet, "shot an arrow in the air," while
a follower of his shot one immediately following it; and as both of
them were aimed at the first of the two Hughs, while the one shaft
smashed his nosepiece, the other pierced his eye, and so, says an eye-
witness, "y* nobil Earle dyd die in y* twynklyng of an eye.
In weapons at this period there was but little novelty. Lances,
swords, and cross-bows still remained in use, it being found that they
killed men as fast as then was wanted. In our more civilised condition
we of course could not content ourselves with such small arms as
these, and must keep making Whitworth guns, and such great engines
of destruction. But it seems in Williau Rupus' reign, that spiffness
was thought of more account than soldiering, and the command which
men obeyed with the most promptness then was "Dress!" Of course
the satirists and chroniclers make sad complaint of this, and William
of Malmesburt upbraids the young men of the time for presenting
an unweaponed effeminate appearance:" a complaint which we may
trust will soon be no more echoable, now that all our youths are getting
rifles to their hands, and learning how to use them.
Before we leave this period, we should notice that the love of wear-
ing everything too long, extended with the dandies quite from top to
toe, and was carried to as great lengths on their heads as on their feet.
The peaked shoes then in fashion we described in our last chapter,
and have only need to add, that the soldiers sometimes wore them as
well as the civilians, though how they could "stand at ease" in them
it puzzles one to think. The like passion for length was shown too in
their hair; fashion as is usual jumping to extremes, and the short
crop of the Conqueror's time sprouting with the next reign into great
luxuriance. From shaving their back hair off, the dandies took to
growing it as long as they could get it; the King himself, Bill Red-
head, heading the new mode, and like the Daughter of the Ratcatcher
appearing with his hair all dangling down his back "like bunches of
carrots upon it."

IRISH MELODY AND PAPAL MARCH.
Among the Irish news in the Morning Post there lately
appeared the subjoined piece of characteristic intelligence:—
"Papal Demonstration at Athlone.—Tho Athlone Roman
Catholics have held a meeting and a banquet to sympathise with the
Pope and collect money to assist In equipping the army commanded
by General di Lauoriciere. The toast of 'That Saintly Pontiff.
Pitts the Ninth,' having been given before that of ' The Queen/ tho
band played a very inappropriate air, and the occurrence was much
remarked upon at the time. This air was none other than 'See the
Conquering Hero Comet.' The allusion to the Pope's position might
have passed for satire, and the company were mortally offended at
the accident."
It may, however, be said that "See (he Conquering Hero
Comes" was, under existing circumstances, an air by no
means altogether unsuited to the toast. If the tune was
a blunder, has not his Holiness just published a Bull?
His band of faithful Irish at Athlone naturally resr.
in a corresponding strain, which no doubt will be (
by their compatriots in the House of Commons.
"Union is Strength"—Is it?
People keep on wondering how the Union Bank frauds
(a "mere fteabite" Mr. Disraeli, not much above two
hundred and sixty thousand pounds; could have been done
under the very eyes of the Directors. The solution of this
mystery is obvious enough. Whatever be the views of other
Bank Directors with regard to the duties which they have
to discharge, those of the Union, it is clear, shut their eyes
to what went on, and must simply be regarded in the light
of sleeping partners.

THE LITTLE MAN AND THE LITTLE PLAN
OR, THE NEW REFORM COACH.
There was once a little man,
And he had a little plan,
For adding to his stature, as ex-Whig, Whig, Whig,
"It's true," said he, "I'm small;
But I still may pass for tall.
If I get upon a question that is big, big, big."
Quoth this active little man,
As his search he straight began
For the very biggest question he could find, find, find;
"1*11 a New Reform Bill broach!
Of old, Gret drove the coach,
And I was on the monkey-board behind, hind, hind.
"But now I've none to school,
And my own turn-out I '11 tool—
It was built for an advertising van, van, van;
But I '11 print up on the box,
'Fox Populi, Dei Vox,'
And start a New Reform Coach, spick and span, span, span."
'Twas in vain his friends advised,
His credit if he prized—
And of that he'd more already than his due, due, due-
He had best let well alone;
His own trumpet leave unblown,
Apropos of old Reform traps, or of new, new, new.
'Twas in vain they called him rash;
His driving styled "slap-dash;"
Re-called to him each earlier break-down, down, down,
While, still equal to her load,
The old Grey coach served the road,
Running regularly to, ■aotfrom, the Crown, Crown, Crown.
Nought would serve the little man,
But his private little plan,
Whereby he hoped much k08oi he should get, get, get;
"Let others drive for pelf,
I drive to please myself,
And I'll guarantee the coach against up-set, set, set."
Then out drove the little man,
In his advertising van,
With " Reform" in big brass letters all a blaze, blaze, blaze;
And from liis lofty perch,
Not fearing jolt or lurch,
Proud as Punch, craned to catch the public praise, praise, praise.
But, to his great surprise,
Instead of cheers and cries
Of "Bravo, Johnny Russell!" from the crowd, crowd, crowd.
All was scorn and sneer and scoff—
"Throw him over!" "Pull him off!"
And a chorus of contempt, low and loud, loud, loud!
Some exclaimed against the trap;
That it wasn't worth a rap •
Was too small—too heavy-weighted—and too slow, slow, slow.
Though these critics, free from pride,
Said they'd condescend to ride
In the vehicle, as far as it would go, go, go.
Others took a different tone,
And shook their fists at John,
And furiously their tongues at him did wag, wag, wag,
Demanding how he dared,
Start a coach quite unprepared,
With anything in shape of a drag, drag, drag.
They were sure that he'd break down,
Ere he'd driven a mile from town,
And his passengers deposit by the run, run, run;
In Democracy's black ditch,
Or in Despotism's—which,
Was uncertain; but most certainly in one, one, one.

ANNEXATION BY BALLET.
That celebrated organ of veracity, the Moniteur, gives a very in-
teresting account of the elegant and graceful manner in which the
Nizzards, the other day, annexed their native country, by vote, to
France. In the first place, according to the Imperial journal, that vote
was perfectly free and unbiassed, for—
"In the morning, in order to remove All idea of influence or pressure of any
kind, the posts of the town occupied by French troops were handed over to the
National Guard and the Royal Carbineers, with the exception of* the guard of
honour stationed at the residence of the Eupress Dowaoer of Russia. From the
same motive the battalion of the 63rd regiment of the line, which had arrived on
the previous day, was ordered on to Cannes, whilst that which followed it received
orders to bait at Honton."
All went voluntary and uncontrolled as a British election. True, a
certain military force remained at hand; but it was carefully kept out
of sight:—
11 As to the battalion which General Frossard was authorised to keep in reserve,
it was strictly confined to its barracks, so that not a single French uniform was to
be Been for the whole day in the quarter where the elections were to take place."
The Duke OF Wellington made precisely the same disposition of
troops on that memorable Tenth of April which was appointed for the
Chartist insurrection. The result was excellent. But let us not name
such dull coarse dogs as British Chartists in any connection with the
picturesque and lively people described by the Moniteur as renouncing
their nationality and liberty thus prettily :—
"It was at nine o'clock In the morning that the ballot was to open, but from
seven o'clock the electors of the rural oommunes, dressed in their holiday clothes,
wero seen advancing on all sides with drums beating and colours flying. In passing
before the French Consulate and before the hotel where M. Pietri resided, they
stopped and hailed with acclamation the representatives of the country to which
they were proud to give themselves: all of them bore on their hats the French
bulletin which they wero about to doposit in the urn. ... At three o'clock
there wore already oounted 5,000 openly announced ov.it against thirty or forty secret
votes. At half-past four the urns wore carried to the Hotel de ViUe, escorted by
the National Guard and by a body o more than 2,000 electors, who afterwards went
under the window of M. Pietri and of the French consul, and saluted them with
acclamations. During this memorable day every countenance beamed with delight,
mutual congratulations wore ovorywhero excuanged, and people asked themselves
whether, in presence of suoh facts, foroign pressure could bo again talked of."
There is one word in the foregoing description which some people
will perhaps suspect to be a mistake. "It was," says the Moniteur,
"at nine o'clock in the morning that the ballot was to open." It may
be supposed that ballot is a misprint for ballet. Did not the Nizzard
peasantry—the "electors of the rural communes" go, "dressed in
their holiday clothes," that is, in jackets and breeches trimmed with
ribbons, ribbed stockings, and round straw hats with coloured bands;
did not these festive villagers go thus decorated, and dance beneath
the windows of M. Pietri And the Frenoh consul P The whole affair
was at least as much of a bullet as a ballot; and the proportion of
5,000 affirmative voters to thirty or forty negative, clearly indicates the
former to have been supernumeraries, unless the latter were also en-
gaged, to represent the recusant party. Mr. Gte and Mr. E. T. Smith
will at all events now know where to go if they are in want of jubilant
rustics to make a lively demonstration in Fra Diavolo or the Bonnam-
bula. Those enterprising managers will find plenty of hands, or rather
feet, among the rural population of Nice, in which there are at least
5,000 persons who are evidently not worthy to tread their native soil,
but who would be just the right men in their right places, gesticulating
and capering at a wedding picnic on the boards of an opera-house.
These jocund swains went, with drums beating and colours flying,
and shouted acclamations before the French consulate—did they?
Suppose they had gone there and cried "Viva Verdi! Viva it lie
oalantuomo.'" "Viva VItalia unital" Would General Frossard's
battalion, in that case, have remained "strictly confined to its barracks."
Incredulity whispers—" Improbably."
A QUEERER FOR THE QUACKS.
As Censor of the Age. the
Public, and the Press,
Mr. Punch is being
daily by every post
appealed to by men
who, like himself, are
fathers of a family, and
who request him to
prevent the foully
growing practice of
putting quack adver-
tisements into public
print. Mr. Punch will
not defile his pages by
describing more par-
ticularly the verbal
filth which he alludes
to; nor will he under-
take the needless and
the nasty labour of
exposing the hum-
buggery by which
these advertisers live.
Among the other lies
they tell, many of
them say that they
are "qualified practi-
tioners," and with
further falsehood state
that they are really
medical men. To re-
fute these two asser-
tions, it is enough to
say that advertising is
forbidden by the rules
of the medical profession, and men therefore who resort to it are not to be regarded as
professional men. Nor in any proper sense can they lay claim to being medical; for the
word "medical" is properly synonymous with "healing," and to heal is what these Quacks
are quite incompetent to do. Fools who trust them may be duped for awhile into believing
they get better, but in the end they pay a dear price for going to these cheap Quacks, who in

what they say and sell are worse rogues than the
Cheap Jacks. Their measures to relieve suffering
tend surely but to lengthen it; and their patients
escape luckily if, having lost their money, they
do not also lose their life.
These statements are so stale that to educated
readers it is needless to repeat them. There
exist, however, persons who, if they have read,
have not quite put faith in them, having not
yet purchased the experience of their truth.
Mr. Punch will therefore not apologise for
plagiary, and will add, as further caution, that
the unenlightened classes are the chief prey of
the Quacks, and it is mainly to their ears that
the quack puffs are addressed. Especially to
rustics do these Doctor Dulcamaras go blowing
their own trumpets, and Mr. Punch's present
object is, if possible, to stop their blowing pub-
licly in print. To do this, Mr. Punch will not
pick up a quarrel with proprietors of newspapers,
who, regardless of the misery these Quacks' lies
may inflict, permit them to be published because,
simply, they get paid for it. Preaching avails
little where the pocket is concerned; and even
Mr. Punch's appeals may not be listened to, if
the chinking of a money-bag be used to drown
the sound of them. It is enough for him to hint
that if proprietors of newspapers have a deaf-
ness to propriety, the purchasers of newspapers
have a sure and speedy cure for it. If people
who object to seeing quack advertisements (and
where is any educated reader who does not?)
would just abstain from purchasing the papers
which insert them, it is probable that their
appearance would soon cease.
Correspondents keep complaining that the filth
is not confined to the Holywell Street Press,
but that Newspapers miscalled "the most
reputable" are open to it. But subscribers to
these prints have the cure in their own hands,
and need no longer trouble Mr. Punch with their
complaints.

A GAME-BUTCHER FROM BOW STREET
WANTED.
Certain men of business are known as "Jacks of all
trades," and certain actors are called men of "general
utility," and certainly a member of one of these two classes
must be required to answer the following advertisement,
which a correspondent sends us from the Yorkshire
Gazette:—
ANTED, a GAME-KEEPER; a young active Man who
kuowg hi* busineM in all its branches. Ho will be required
to havo a ltnowlodge of Joiners' Work as woll as Painting. Ho must
also be a Butcher. And a preference will be given to a Mao who has
been in the Police.—All letters (post j*id) to A. B., &c Ac.
According to this statement, the business of a game-
keeper must be rather an extensive one, much more so than
the word itself would lead one to suspect. The tree of know-
ledge of the business must be difficult to climb, and
the man who has to get it up "in all its brandies" will
find plenty of variety to test him in the task. To a
proficiency in painting he must join some skill in join-
ing; and besides being a butcher, he should have been
in the police. Jack of all trades, he must specially be up
to these two latter: and must know how to deal destruction
both to partridges and poachers, taking up the one with all
the ease and quickness that he knocks down the other.
Well, now we know that game-bagging is really made
a trade of rather than a sport, we are not surprised to
find that a game-but clier is wanted, to assist his master-
slaughterer in shooting for the shop. Our only wonder
is, that a man of such accomplishments as seem to be
required, should be imagined for a moment to be out of
place. Without troubling himself about answering adver-
tisements, he might make a splendid living by sett ing up a
show, and exhibiting himself as a phenomenon of nature.
A. man must have been born with a hundred hands at
least to discharge the various duties which are above
required of him; and there are people who would pay to
see a hundred-handed game-keeper, as to see a five-legged
cow, or a cat with thirteen tails, or any other "little
game," or more classically lusus, which Dame Nature may
e up to.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
April 30. Monday. Inasmuch as if the Irish Exodus goes on with its
present vigour, there will soon be no Irish in Ireland, Lord Clancarty
was naturally eager to make a row about the national system of
education in that province before the subject became, like Lord Nor-
man by, a thing of the past. He assailed the national schools. Lord
Cork bunged nim up with a declaration, supported by the Bishop of
Cashel. that the system was doing great good, and Lord Carlisle,
who had come over for the private view of the Academy, declared that
the Government intended to adhere to the schools. The Divorce
Court Amendment Bill passed. Lords Shaftesbury and Ebury very
properly abused the Government for consenting to surrender any part
of Smithfield to the greedy Corporation of London, when there is
really no place of recreation for the children in the City, except between
I lie legs of the horses and under the Juggernaut Cars of the Van-
Demons.
Somebody asked Beau Brummell for a halfpenny, and King Beau
replied, "Eellow, I don't know the coin." The same remark will in a
couple of months be an answer to any mendicant demand for "a copper,
yer nonour." New pennies and halfpennies will then be issued, and
they are made of bronze. The first elegant-minded beggar who says to I
Mr. Punch, "Give us a bronze, please, my Lord," shall have it—the |
second shall be annexed to a policeman for impudence and plagiarism.
The celebrated Metallurgist (shut up and sat upon, are you not,Viscount,
by that word P), Dr. Percy, has been analysing part of Big Ben( but
declines to infer of what other parts of him may be made, a decision
creditable alike to the learned philosopher's judgment in metals and in
men. The maker of the unfortunate bell will probably say, with
Horace—
'Percy-coa odl, puer, apparatus."
The other "Big Ben "—inscribed on the Parliamentary roll as Mr.
Bentinck, of Norfolk—resumed the debate on the Reform Bill, which
he attacked with some jocosity. Mr. Walter thought that a Reform
Bill must be passed, and that the business of the House was to see that
the measure was made safe, in Committee. Lord John Manners recited
a list of all the accidents and offences that had occurred since '32 to
r that a Reform Act did not necessarily bring in the Millennium,
speakers said their say. "Lethe is a brave river." Mr.
Baillie Cochrane, having on a previous evening done all he could,
physically, to hinder Members from coming into the House to prevent
a Count Out (bravo, Mr. Irish Attorney-Genera lDeaby! Mr. Punch
saw your gallant and successful charge, and likened you to Arnold
Von Winkleried), now opposed the Bill with much less substantial
arguments. Mr. Du Cane, the Conservative pride and joy, delivered
a temperate and clever speech against the measure, and was loudly
cheered by his backers; the Viscount wretchedly observing, "No
doubt that Cain's able." Mr. Clay pottered in favour of the Bill,
but took a good point—namely, that the commercial classes often
showed themselves quite as ignorant of true principles of economy as
the working classes. Mr. A. Mills would try to mend the Bill in
Committee, but if he failed, would certainly try to pitch it out on the
Third Reading; and Mr. John Locke invited the Opposition to intro-
duce fancy franchises in Committee. On the motion for adjournment,
Mr. Vincent Scully said that Members, instead of addressing them-
selves to the Bill, abused Mil. Bright, and that the Bill was the great
Social Evil of the day. The Midnight Meeting for dealing with it then
terminated.
Tuesday. Nestor, Baron Ltndhurst, upon whom, for his efforts
to-night, Mr. Punch has conferred immortality in a Cartoon which the
son of Copley will assuredly appreciate, addressed the Lords on the
state of the Navy, declaring that it was not nearly strong enough, and
that the people ought not to be satisfied with its present condition.
The Duke of Somerset thought that they ought, and that it would
not be found wanting on a Great Occasion,—a delicate euphuism for a
war with France.
The same subject was discussed in the Commons, at considerable
length, and Lord Clarence Paget took the same line as his chief.
A commission was ordered to inquire into the election corruptions of
Berwick-on-Tweed, and one of the witnesses before the late committee
OS the election for that place was ordered to be indicted for perjury.
There was a good deal of taunting talk exchanged, but there was a
general feeling that a Berwick freeman is a corrupt slave.
Wednesday. Lord Raynham carried, by 109 to 85, the second reading
of his Bill for the punishment of assaults on women and children. He
proposes to enable the Magistrates to inflict fifty lashes for a first
offence, and one hundred and fifty for a second, and twelve months im-
prisonment. Now, Mr. Punch has always contended that the Cat is
the proper avenger of that kind of outrage, and that a dog's punish-
ment befits a brute. But legislation to be useful must be compre-
hensive. Lord Raynham's Bill appoints no public Prosecutor who
should look after these cases, but leaves the law to be appealed to by
the victims of ruffianism, chiefly women. It is notorious that few
women, and none of the kind whom Lord Raynham would protect,
will ask to have their tyrants flogged. The poor creatures will rather
bear with brutality. Therefore, unless the business can be taken out
of their hands, a ruffian will be safer, on account of their forbearance,
than he is at present. This was urged in debate, and it was arranged
that the subject should be more fully considered in Committee. Mr,
Clay declared that since the law for punishing assaults on women,
many more of them got drunk and pawned their husbands' clothes, and
appears to think that the women of the working class require the edu-
cational checks of blacked eyes and kicks from hobnailed boots. "Punch
and Argilla do on this divide."
Thursday. The Sunday Trade and Howling Nuisance Bill was dis-
cussed in the Lords, and the motion to go into Committee carried by
51 to 25. There may be different notions about the compelling shops
in poor neighbourhoods to shut up on Sunday mornings; and while the
employers of labour refuse to pay wages at early hours on Saturday, it
is unjust to deny the poor the power of making their purchases next
day. But there cannot be two opinions about the permitting the
bawling and shrieking peripatetics to infest quiet streets and squares,
during the hours of Sunday. There is no excuse for persons in com-
fortable circumstances who do not buy on Saturdays, and they have no
right to encourage the Yelling Nuisances, and deprive their neighbours
of their one day of peace. Or, if tilings must be hawked on Sunday,
let them be hawked in silence. It is not too much to ask a lazy negli-
gent housekeeper to look out of window for what she has omitted to
provide.
Mr. Bright presented a complaint from a Society calling itself the
North London Political Union, protesting against members using con-
temptuous language towards the working classes, and especially object
ing to their being called clowns, boors, and scum. Mr. Punch cor-
dially concurs in the views of the petitioners, whoever they may be,
and begs to remind Honourable Mem tiers, that education deprives them
of the excuse that may be made for the ignorant, who talk of bloated
aristocrats, tyrants, and taxeaters. Mr. Punch the more insists upon
this, as it seems that it is a breach of privilege to petition in reference
to words used in debate, and as he is the grand represser of all wrong,
he begs to say that he, who fears the face of no created party, has no
idea of petitioning on any subject, but hereby commands the Legisla-
ture to keep a civil tongue in its head.
Sir Richard Beth ell announced that he had given orders that
Criminal Informations should be filed against the late Liberal Members

for Wakefield, Me. Cuarlesworth and Mr. Leatham (beaufrere of
Mr. Buigm) as the principals abetting and aiding in the corruption
at the last election there. Sovereigns, it is said, were carried about in
a basket, which was probably called the Wicker of WakeGeld.
The last night of the debate on the Second Reading of the Reform
Bill. Lord Palmerston had announced that he would have no more
adjournments, Mr. Brand had whipped, and there was a belief that
there would be a succession of fierce divisions. In Tom Thumb, a ladv
asks whether there are not ten thousand Giants drawn up in the back
garden, to which her faithful adviser diplomatically replies, "Madam,
shall I tell you what I am going to say? I do firmly believe that there
is not one." The Giants of Opposition to-night were equally non-
apparent, and there was not a single division. There was a debate, in
the course of which Mr. Gregory made a smart speech, showing up
the vices of American institutions, and the abandonment of politics
by the respectability of America, in consequence of the preponderance
given to the uneducated classes. Mr. Walpole thought that, bad as
the Bill was, the House was bound to go on with it, but he referred to
the allegation that Lord John Russell had drawn up the Bill with-
out consulting his colleagues, and Lord Joiin said he hadn't—the
truth probably being that Lord Palmerston had said to him, "Now,
mind, this is your Pigeon, Johnny, and don't let «« be bored with it."
Mr. Gladstone replied for the Government, defended the Bill, stated
that the returns were all right, and that it was proposed to add 200.C00
to the present borough constituency of 410,000, and 150,000 to the
present county constituency of 530,000, and that with the Universities,
England would have 1,345,000 electors. The figures are uncommonly
unlike those of his colleagues, but Mr. Punch supposes that they are
all right, as Mr. Glabstone says so, and hopes that the proposed
Swamping Process is now clear to everybody. Mr. Collins tried to
make a speech, but the House bad had enough of it, and Collins
awoke the Passions of his hearers, who incontinently shouted him
down, and the Second Reading was carried without a division. Lord
John then said, he should not bother the House again .on the
subject for a month, and fixed the attempt to go into Committee for
the 4th of June. In reply to an Irish Member, the Irish were told
that they must wait for their Reform Bill until their betters were
served.
Friday. The Earl of Lucan, of all people, called attention to
certain defects in our military system; but he was awfully snubbed by
Earl de Grey and the Duke of Cambridge, and told that his
motion was so vague that it could not be understood, but so far as it
was understood it seemed a ridiculous one to bring into the House. Lord
Cardigan, hearing how unkindly Lord Lucan was treated, burst into
a flood of tears. Lucan as a Military Reformer is not bad. We
suppose he will next ask for the vacant Archbishopric of York.
Lord John Russell, in reply to a lot of questions, which he had to
answer at once, said that notwithstanding everything was going on
well between us and Japan, the Brazilians were resisting our just
claims, and, therefore, that he should not produce despatches from
our diplomatic agents at Rome, because Mr. Cobden's expenses to
Paris were paid Mm, but no salary, although his Lordship entirely
disapproved of the conduct of the King of Naples, and had sent no
orders to stop the Chinese expedition. Like Falstatf, he took all their
points in his target,—thus.
Mr, Sheridan tried to get the Duty on Fire-insurance Policies
reduced from three Roberts to one, and failed. Sir Joseph Paxton
succeeded in getting a Committee to consider whether the awful
increase in the traffic of London could not be met by embanking the
Thames. H this is not done now it never will be, it seems, for the
railway plans will prevent it. He urged that it was not a mere London
question, but a national one. seeing t hat thirty millions of provincials
annually infest the Metropolis. Mr. Cowper mentioned, among other
pleasant things, that the new sewer, along the Strand and Ludgate
Hill, will most probably unsettle the foundations of Somerset House
and St. Paul's, and bring both down; so Lord Macaulay's New
Zealander had better begin taking his drawing lessons.
THE TIVERTON SOMNAMBULIST.
hy is Lord Palmer-
ston like a weasel?
Catch a weasel asleep!
is a saying which may
well be considered to
be generally applicable
to the noble Viscount
who presides over Her
Majesty's Ministers.
Yet Palmerston, like
the celebrated epic
poet of antiquity, may
occasionally be sur-
prised in an oblivion
of forty winks. The
usually vigilant Pre-
mier does not know,
perhaps, that he fell
on sleep the other
evening in the House
of Commons, and was
off for some minutes as
sound as a top. More-
over he talked in his
slumber, but probably
has not the least idea
of what he said, unless
he reads the reports of
his own speeches: for
nobody seems to have
pointed out to him the
ineptitude of the re-
marks which fell from
him on that occasion.
There is no need to
quote them; it is
enough to say, that
they expressed ap-
proval of Mr. Frederick Peel's address for a Commission of Inquiry into the alleged
existence of corrupt practices at Berwick during the last election. Now, this inquiry, as
everybody knows, will cost the country between one and two thousand pounds, for which
there will be nothing to show but a huge Blue Book, which will merely tell us over again,
with variations in detail, the tiresome old stories about Sovereign Alley and the Man-in-
the-Moon.
To this futile end the evidently dormant Pam saw no objection to spend all that public
money. No wonder. He could see nothing whatever. If his eyes were open, their sense
was shut. Had he been wide awake, or indeed awake at all, instead of fast asleep, he would

have recollected that, only a few days before, he
had declared the nation unable to afford £200,000
to avert such a disgrace as the disruption of the
British Museum, ana the banishment of the most
popular part of its contents to a barn at Brompton.
With that declaration in mind, he would have
rejected with horror the proposal to throw away
one shilling on a Board for the compilation of
another uninteresting and useless Blue Book;
but oftentimes ideas which, in our waking state,
would appear most monstrously absurd, do not
surprise us or seem the least unreasonable in a
dream. Palmerston dreamt, having been sent
to sleep by Frederick Peel.
The most singular fact, in connection with this
remarkable case of political somnambulism, is,
that the House of Commons, without hesitation,
accepted the oracle which was delivered by the
noble Lord, dozing on his legs. Mr. Frederick
Peel's motion was agreed to without a division.
Here is the existing House of Commons about
to destroy its own existence by passing a Reform
Bill. That act may be one of justifiable suicide;
but the vote which has ordained the Berwick
Bribery Commission indicates temporary derange-
ment. The present Parliament will soon be no
more. What will anunreformed Berwick of the
past signify to a reformed Parliament? What
will a new and reformed Berwick, with a six-
pounder constituency, have to do with an old
bygone Berwick of corruptionists and ten-
pounders? If the representation were going to
remain as it is, there might be a question whether
or not Berwick ought to be disfranchised; but
what have the innocent six-pounders of that
borough done that they should suffer for the
venality of the base ten? In voting for a super-
fluous and expensive commission at the mere nod
of the sleeping Premier, the House of Commons
has added one more instance to those curious
cases of gregarious sympathy, and subjection of
multitudes to the control of a single mind, of
which so many have been described by writers
on psychology.
a notorious character in the city.
Fleet Street is an old offender, continually
getting taken up.

CHAPTER XT.—INTRODUCES THE FIRST WIG, AND BRINGS
US TO THE BIRTHTIME OF THE SECOND HENRY.
S our readers of course care-
fully remember what we tell
tliem, and treasure up from
week to week the stores of
learning we distribute, we
have no need to remind them
that we ended our last chap-
ter with saying a few words
on the coiffure of William
Rupus, which formed a
rather noticeable part of his
costume. That the King re-
ceived the name of Rupus
from his hair, is a fact which
liis historians have not scru-
pled to expose. With the
viciousne9g of people who
take delight in mentioning
their friends' personal de-
fects, one of them describes
it as "inclining to be car-
rotty," while another tries
to pun about its "being a
little radish;" but they
omit to say, if it was through
some "vegetable hair-dye"
that Will Rupus gave this
vegetable colour tonis head.
Still, although he could not
boast of much capillary at-
tractiveness, the King al-

Stephen's time; and it was probably at this period that polite ears
were first shocked by the expression "Dash my wig!" lhat people
made no scruple about owning that they wore them, may readily be
seen by a small fragment of a ballad, which, to please the antiquarians,
we may find room to quote:—

As the King, says Will de Malmesbury, was "a man of great
facetiousness and was famed for the "familiar pleasantry of his
conversation," we are prepared to learn he often chaffed his courtiers
on this head, and poked fun
at tbeir wigs in a manner most
unmerciful.
One of the jokes told of him
in the volume of De Malhbs-

informs us that his Majesty,
when in a merry mood, used
to pluck his courtiers' wigs
off, and chuck them out of
window, singing as he did so,
"Aica, wigs, atca!" We learn
too when he wished to give a
minister an ear-wigging, the
King would shake him by the
ear until he shook his wig off,
and then, digging him in the
ribs, would cry, "Aha! old
boy, that 'air was not grown

IRISH CONSERVATIVE CREED.
Mb. Whiteside is reported to hare assigned,
the other night, in a speech of enormous length,
on the Church Rates Abolition Bill, this extra-
ordinary reason why Church Rates should be
maintained:—
"What State ever existed In power, greatness, and
flory that did not as a nation acknowledge an over-ruling
'rovidence? Look to the people of antiquity. Mot a
ceremony, procession, or triumph took place in ancient
Rome that was not consecrated by religion; and we now
look with delight at the remains of the temples which
they built to their gods; nay, more—so far is history from
proving that separation of religion from the State to be
the advancement of liberty and of morals, that we find a
great patriot, born in ancient Rome, saying, 'While your
forefathers were wise, free, and virtuous, they lived In
modost habitations, and spent their wealth in decorating
the temples of the gods. You now, belDg corrupt and
contemptible, live in luxury and riot, and you refuse to
sustain the edifices of religion.' (Chtere.)"
Ut sunt divorum, Mars, Bacchus, Apollo: as
were the temples of those divinities, so are parish-
churches. The former edifices were sacred as
well as the latter. There was a temple-rate and
there is a church-rate. Do they amount to the
same thing F is the question which is suggested
by the above argument of the right honourable
and learned Member for the University of
Dublin.
A Doubtful Compliment.
(A Harrier Pemtt.)
A Well-known "lover of the chace" assured
us, the other day, that it is all nonsense about
a certain distinguished person not being a bold
rider; and added, in proof of the assertion, that
when out with his harriers, he actually stops at

NESTOR'S REBUKE TO THE CHIEFS.
From the Iliad, Book II. A new Translation by Mr. Punch, M.A.
Then Nestor rose, and all the Grecian Peers,
Compelled to silence, bent their listening ears.
"le chiefs," he said, "my years are eighty-eight,
Therefore beseems ye let my words have weight.
Time was, I needed not such grace entreat;
I made men mind me on my legs or seat.
Oh, had I now the vigour once I owned
When fierce in arms 1 stood, though silver-toned,
And dauntless Melbourne's strongest battle tore,
And dropped O'Connell prostrate on the floor:
Or, earlier, on my charger laid the rein,
And galloped o'er the corpse of Pea-Green Hayne,
What time he dared resist the vengeful suit
That wreaked the wrongs of the deserted Foote—
Time was: but still mine intellect is clear,
And for my country's sake, I bid you hear."
"Thou fine old man," the generous PuNcnus said,
"Whoever interrupts, I break his head."
"Then listen, chieftains," aged Nestor cried,
"And weigh my counsel well ere you decide.
Behold yon ships, your Navy, there, behold.
And say, my friends, is Greece not overbold?
There stand, as erst, the frowning towers of Troy,
There stand the Trojans, eager to destroy.
Say, warriors, were the instant signal given
To close in strife (avert the omen, Heaven!),
Is yonder fleet so strong, so skilled its bands.
That fate should give the battle to your hands?
Has Troy been idle, or in peaceful hour
Has she amassed an overmastering power,
That, loosed upon you, on some dreadful day,
Shall sweep, O chiefs, your best defence away?
"lis peace, of course, or at the least a truce,
Who doubts its lasting nature gets abuse,
And huckster's doctrine, well I know, pretends
Exchange of goods must ever keep men friends:
But, Lords of Greece, your ships are still your guards,
And sudden warfare's always on the cards ,
Therefore I urge you, get your reckoning done,
Be sure of every man, and every gun,
Each new and old device of arms employ;
Repose no faith upon the faith of Troy.
This is the sentence from old Nestor's lips—
Chieftains, ice want more men, tee want more ships."
He spoke; Great Punchus' face with ardour glowed.
"If you 're not right, old man," he cried, "I'm blowed!"
THE FOOL'S FINGER IN THE ARMY.
Among the Parliamentary Notices in the House of Commons the
following, which appeared the other day, has perhaps occasioned some
amusement:—
"Sir De Lacy Evans.—To draw attention to a General Order recently promul-
gated, requiring officers of certain corps to discontinue the use of peaks to their
forage caps, and to substitute in future gold-lace stripes in lieu of the present cloth
stripos on their undress trousors."
Officers' caps and trousers are doubtless subjects ridiculously beneath
the dignity of the House of Commons; but the gallant General
Evans is quite justified in calling the attention of Collective Wisdom
to the freaks of Military Folly. For there is, and always has been, an
agency of foolishness mysteriously at work in the Army in all matters
which relate to dress. It is an agency quite other than that of the
Commander-in-Chief, and the results of it warrant the conclusion
that the minor details of regimental costume, disgusting to any sane
gentleman, constitute a department the control of which lias been
assigned to some snobbish idiot. The instances of this despicable im-
becility, specified in the notice of Sir De Lacy Evans, are exactly
cases in point. They are petty alterations, for which there is not the
least occasion, and which are simply productive of inconvenience. A
peak to a forage cap saves an officer's eyes, and a cloth stripe is cheaper
than a gold one: at any rate the necessity of changing the one for the
other will cost the officer a new pair of trousers. Who is this oaf
whose fingers are afflicted witli a chronic itch to play with officers'
caps and breeches? Apparently, some influential personage of weak
nund, labouring under a monomaniacal passion for army-tailoring. It
is very desirable that this unhappy lunatic should no longer be per-
mitted to render Her Majesty's Service ridiculous. If harmless, let
him be employed in cutting out and decorating proper caps for his own
head, or in gold-lacing and embroidering pantaloons for his other
extremity. If a licence to sport with military uniforms and accoutre-
ments is accorded to the poor maniac to occupy what mind he has, and
withhold him from playing other still more mischievous tricks, let him
speedily be placed in a strait tunic, with epaulettes behind, or some
other equally reasonable decoration.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROGUES OF ROULETTE.
ick of the absurdi
ties which consti-
tute the greater
part of our foreign
intelligence, I the
English mind is
refreshed by the
subjoined state-
ment, redounding
to the credit of a
continental pre-
late :—
"In tho sitting of
the States of Nassau
at Wiesbaden, three
days ago, Bishop
Wiliielm projxisod
the suppression of tho
gaming-houses, and,
after an animated dis-
cussion, the motion
was agrood to."
We are gratified
to find a German
Îirelate trying his
land with success
at practical and
sensible legisla-
tion. Our gratifi-
cation is very dis-
interested ; for the
gambling houses
at Wiesbaden will
be suppressed at.
our expense. Those dens of villany hare hitherto afforded places of
asylum to numerous British swindlers and British simpletons, whom
the suppression of them will probably induce to return home. So
much the worse for the payers of those county rates which will be
heightened by the increased expenses of our gaols.

THE COMING FRENCH INVASION.
Everybody knows, or, if not, when this Punch is published every-
body will know, that the French are coming to invade us in the latter
part of June, and having carried arms and rested legs in Leicestcrre
Squarr, will take by storm the Crystal Palace on the last Monday in
the month. Of their "three glorious days" at Sydenham, we shall
speak when the time comes. We have now only to note that, to direct
them in topography as well as in locution, care has thoughtfully been
taken to supply them with a guide : * and, thus assisted, it is confi-
dently hoped that they will triumph as well over our language as our
labyrinths of streets.
Our readers of course always remember what they read, and they
must therefore be aware that we seldom review books. In general,
moreover, as for our reviewing Guidebooks, we about as soon should
dream of passing Bradshaie in review, or of furnishing a criticism on
Dr. Johnson's Dictionary. But this Guide of the Orphéonistes is
such a special composition that we may fitly make it an exception to
our rule: and the facetiousness and fun which sparkle in its pages,
entitle it in fairness to a word of praise in Punch.
Wit h the modesty which so distinguishes the French, and so properly
attends the execution of great works, the preface says that this one,
which is "dédiée aux Orphéonistes," has been written and produced:—
"Spécialement pour eux, dans le seul but do leur faciliter les différents détails
de la vie, et de les guider au mUieu do la métropole britanuique. Ce but sera-t -il
atteint!—l'auteur 1 espère. 11 a choisi ses mots, combiné ses phrases, avec un soin
tout particulier, de manière & ce qu'elles puissent répondre a toutes les nécessités
de la vio matérielle."
Giving this flourish of trumpets, the guide of the Orphéonistes
marches with them into London; ana, after telling them that it extends
from Whitechapel to St. Paneras, proceeds to give them a description
of its "trois grands districts: le West-End, la Cité, et 1'East-End,"
the two latter of which are thus faithfully portrayed :—
"La Cité, ou le Vieux Londres, forme un losange qui commence a Temple-Bur,
et s'étend jusqu'au delà de Minoris, limité à droite par la rive opposée du neuve, a
gauche s'éteudant de Hotbornà Primerose-Spitar." [A French contract ion possibly for
Primrose Street, Hpital Square.] "Elle constitue 1a partie centrale do Londres et une
ville à part, ayant ses luis, ses usages, ses franchises, habitée par les commerçants
et les industriels, a l'exception des manufacturiers eu soio qui sont dans le voisinage
de Spilatnolds. L'East-Eod est un quartier commercial comme la Cité, mais il est
principalement occupé par les grandes fortunes coloniales. 11 est situé le long de
la Tamise, et coupé par les docks do White-Hall (1)"
• "VocabrOairo et Guide dos Orphéonistes Français à Londres." Par A. R. B.
Parts, lfOO.
To facilitate their progress "dans le labyrinthe.de rues" (in which
it is asserted, "les femmes se montrent peu," a truth which is in
Regent Street especially apparent), the Orphéonistes are next face-
tiously informed that :—
"La plus grando des voies parallèles a la Tamise entre dans Londres par
Bay's-Water-Itoad et slllonno toute la ville sous les noms d'Orford-Street,
Holbora, Skinner Street. Newgate Street, Cheapeide. Leadenhsll Street et Mile-
End-Road. L'autre ligne, parallèle au fleuvo, entre a l'ouest de Londres,
par Kensington, Hyde Parle et Piccadilly. La elle se bifurque ; unede ses branobes
va rejoindre Holborn on traversant la Tamise sous les noms de Coventry Street,
Long Acre, et Oroat Queen's Street: l'autre incline un peu à droite, et prend les
noms do Pall Mali, Saint-Martin's-Strand et Farrington Street, jusqu'à Islington.
Parmi les principles voies qui traversent Londres il faut citer celle de l'ouest, qui
emmonee à Edgeware Hoad, et, sous les noms de Park Lane, Urosvenor Place et
Wauxhall-Bridge-Road, borne la ville à l'ouest; celle de l'est, qui sous les noms
de Portland-Piaco, Regcnt-Streot, Waterloo Place, et Oxford Street, forme la plus
magnifique rue de Londres."
Having accurate descriptions such as these to help him, who can
possibly dispute the bold assertion of the Guide, that " malgré l'immense
développement de Londres, il n'est pas difficile de se retrouver dans ses
rues? With their minds, then, quite at ease as to the finding of their
way, the Orphéonistes may revel in the power to stare about them,
ana so the Guide proceeds to help them to see what they can see.
After caution that our public monuments and buildings "n'ont rien
de bien remarquable sous le rapport artistique" (a truth which to the
reader of his Punch sounds somewhat trite) the following historical
description is put forth :—
"En tetc des édifices oh siègent les grandes administrations publiques et parti-
culières, il faut placer le Royal Exchange [this wo need not say is a misprint for
'lo Punch Office ;' an error which we trust tho next edition will correct).—Cet
édifice, dans lequel se tient le Money Market, est situé au N. de Cornhill. Il a été
construit de 1630 à 1167, brûlé eu 1066, et rebâti l'année suivante."
Thus instructed where to see the Old Royal Exchange, (which every-
body knows was not burned down in a d. 1836,) the Orphéonistes are
guided to Ola London Bridge, which, everybody knows, is likewise
still existent. From this point, or pont, they perhaps may find it in-
teresting to go and see the Docks; of which, as they are told, the chief
are, "deux bassins à Limehouse," and the well-known "docks du
Commerce du Groenland, Surrey, et pays de l'Est." From the docks
their faithful Guide next conducts them to the markets, of which
especial notice is drawn to that of "Brooks." No mention being made
of that of Covent Garden, of course the inference is obvious that it does
not exist. A not more pardonable omission occurs too in the mention of
"le marché de Smithfield," which is described as being "destiné à la
vente des bestiaux," and actually not one syllable is said about its also
being destined "à la vente des femmes!"
Among the other London sights which the Orphéonistes will do well
to see (iï they can find them) especial note is made of "La colonne de
Fish-Street-Hill," "La colonne et statue de Nelson, dans Belgravce-
Square," and "enfin, la colonne de Waterloo."
Other "monuments publics," and quite as worthy to be seen,
are "Le Ministère de l'Intérieur" and "L'Hôtel de la Monnaie;"
while, if there be a wish to'view "le troisième palais royal," the simple
way to do so is to ask for "Somerset-House." A doubt may reasonably
be raised as to whether "les Chambres du Parlement" be really wortn
a visit; for the Guide says, "elles sont lourdes et de mauvais goût."
The theatre of "Atsley is, however, recommended; and as being
"les principaux bals de la ville en été," attention is directed not
alone to "Crémorne-Gardens," but also to le Wauxhall," which latter,
we thus learu, has not yet been shut up.
The directions of the Guide in the matter of locution are every whit
as accurate as those anent locality; but as we have "more than usual
demands upon our space" (this hint to correspondents we always keep
iu type), we must reserve our further criticism—as Punch comes out
on Wednesday—till the middle of next week.
"Heavy Exchanges and both down."
"ScWê " Report of a Fight (Pauim).
This voting of purses, and cheering of cheers,
In London and Liverpool nothing so strange is:
For well may Exchanges be fond of Tom Sayers,
; how fond Sayers is of exchanges.
"annexed! what next ?"—Coldcn Improved.
We read that the French troops have been regaling themselves at
Annecy, the capital of Northern Savoy. Since the spoliation by
France, the town, as a mark of its degrading allegiance, should change
its name to Annexé.

equally well qualified to represent them in Congress.

Youn honour, I prize not this bodily hulk,
We all must soon quit Life's brief scene;
No, bless you! don't think that 1 ever would skulk
From serving my country and Queen.
But there are some things in the Navy, you see,
To which I do strongly object;
To enter it, therefore, if you invite me,
I pause, as we say, to reflect.
The sailor, in fact, has advanced with the age,
Observes, notes, and reasons on facts,
And if in the service he sticks to engage,
He now-a-days thinks ere he acts.
A striking improvement you '11 own you discern,
1 think, in his language and air;
The quid in his cheek you no more see him turn,
And 1 'm sure that you don't hear him swear.
Well, now there's the cat—give the eat to the dog
In case of deserving the same:
But dear me, your honour, a sailor don't flog,
And call flogging felons a shame.
However, suppose we get over the lash,
And setting the cat on one side,
You wound a tar's feelings, his sentiments gash
Although you may not scratch his hide.
Why keep him in port when returned from his cruise,
Of shore in close sight—almost reach—
On board whilst imprisoned, afar off he views
The choice of his heart on the beach?
He sees his fond parents their handkerchiefs wave,
Beholds his betrothed in their care;
But vainly for leave to embrace them may crave.
And that's what a seaman can't bear.
His warm social feelings respect if you 're wise,
His tender affections regard;
But don't—benediction I beg on your eyes—
Don't hold him so tight and so hard.
Then soon will you make up your Naval Reserve,
Soon man all your ships—every one—
And, dear me, most willing should I be to serve,
And conquer or die at my gun.
P. R. B. CRITICISM.
"Dear Punch,
"I Have lately been admitted to the P. R B —
"Not the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, as the letters used to mean;
but the Prize Fung Brot herhood. I am hand in glove with the Camden
Town Pet, and Alio Keep has promised to sit to me, and set to
with me afterwards. It is an immense privilege to know these athletes;
to see bone and muscle in action, instead of the antique. As an artist,
I am charmed with the men and their manners! I li ml the B.B. (Benicia
Boy) most useful in working up the darks (of eyes), and. thanks to my
early use of the maul-stick, I am anything but a stick with my mauleys.
I hope soon to be able to draw my man whenever I please, and already
I flatter myself I don't make such a very bad fist of it. Then, too,
these men can open my eyes as well as close 'em. They are putting
me up to a great deal of the humbug of classical art. There's The
Fighting Gladiator for instance,—a deluge of praise has been poured
on him. I showed the cast to the Champion the other day, and I
thought he'd have died of laughing. I was rather annoyed, and told
Tom the statue was a very great work of art, and represented a mem-
ber of the Roman (S.) P. (Q.) R. 'Ah,' he replied, 'a regular rum
'un he must ha' been. Jest you look at the muff—why he has got his
right out a deal far'rer nor he can get it back agin, and then twig his
legs. There's the right pin about five feet behmd him. Right hand
out. and right leg back! Blest if he could stand a tap from a baby's
little finger in that 'ere form.' I have since tried the attitude myself,
and I find what Tom says is quite true. I fear Tom don't think much
of the Hercules. His remark upon this muscular divinity was: 'Too
much beef on his bones. I should say now that old chap might ha'
been a hard hitter afore he left the P. R. and took to the public line.
But there's too much o' the tap-tub about him now. Blest if he han't
a look o' Pbteb Ckawlet.'
"When I showed him the Dying Gladiator, he seemed to feel the
expression—'Poor beggar!' was his simple comment; 'Can't come to
time! He've got his bellyful.'
"H«

"He curtly dismissed the Apollo as ' too leggy: no bellows;
ie in the loins' (or, as he pronounced it,'lines'). But of the
no bellows; and too
Theseus
he said at once: 'Now that's a nice figger of a mill—whoever done it!
I'd think twice afore I stood up to him!'
"The Champion was all right, you see. No gammoning Toil. He
doesn't care for names, but he knows a thing or two about make and
muscles, and went straight to the truth—from the shoulder. It was a
very interesting moment for me. Here was Science (P. R. B. Science)
brought face to face with Sculpture. Here was the Champion of
England commenting on the Hero of Greece! It is not every day one
can listen to Saters upon Phidias. When I told him Theseus, too
was a fighting man—a Greek—he remarked, simply: 'Ah—somethin*
to Tom the Greek, I dessay. I knowed him.'
"I am in hopes that our fellows at the Hogarth Club may succeed
in getting Tom to stand (up) to them! What a model for a society of
young men
We have all of us been used to drawing from the round, you know;
but with Tom we shall draw from no end of rounds, and from the
square into the bargain.

MR. PUNCH AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
he London readers of
Mr. Punch (he takes
it for granted) who
had a few hours
and a few shillings
to spare on Friday,
spent them rationally
as he did in hearing
the Elijah, which at
Sydenham was per-
formed as it had never
been before. To pay
a crown to hear the
crowning work of
Mendelssohn is a
temptation which few
people in reason can
resist; and to hear
such a performance of
it as last Friday's, no
right-minded posses-
sor of five shillings
could refuse. Mr.
Punch therefore as-
sumes that all his
readers out of Bed-
lam, who had time
and money Bpareable,
were with him to take
part in the Mendels-
sohn Commemoration, which, whatever part they took—whether vocal or auricular; and if
the former, whether alto or soprano, bass or tenor—was one that they are not soon likely to
forget.
Taking this for granted, there is little need for him to tell his London readers in what a
brilliant manner the Festival went off, or what a blaze of triumph was the bonfire at the
end of it. But Mr. Punch writes for All England as well as for its capital, and writes too
for posterity as well as for those present. Mr. Punch may therefore fitly say a few words on
the subject; and seeing that he, happily, is not yet an M. P., there need be no fear that his
"few words" will be many ones.
As nothing can detract from his exalted reputation. Mr. Punch will not mind owning that
he went to Sydenham simply and solely to enjoy himself. His object was to hear, and not to
criticise and carp at: and he neither tried to count the more than million beauties, nor tired
his ears by straining them for possible defects. Leaving others to pick holes, if there were
any to be picked, it is enough for him to say he made his mind up to be pleased, and that he
discovered no fit reason to unmake it. All the musical arrangements were on such a major
scale, that the performance, as was promised, could not but be a great one. The chorus sang
with all the unanimity of one; and each one of the soloists sang with all the force and fervour
of a chorus. Each note issued by the choristers was a three-thousand-pounder, and when it—

Charming the hearers thero,
Well-drilled Three Thousand I
As Orpheus of old could make the woods to listen to him, Sims Orpheus so sang that
the most wooden of his hearers wagged their heads while hearing him; and Miss Poly-
hymnia Parefa, while she sang "with heart and voice," on the last of those four words
thrilled forth her high B flat so ckre as to make Mr. Punch think of his Clara. Indeed she
sang so high in what was her so-lo, that one might almost say she warbled like a lark, except
that, being somewhat of a larger growth, she could not be expected to sing quite out of eye-
sight. And then Miss Dolby * sang that air of airs of hers (which Mr. Punch will not insult
her by naming more particularly) with such sweetness, and such feeling, that, although he
hates encores, Mr. Punch found himself helping in the one which was accorded to her. In
fact, if Mr. Punch had been allowed to have his way (which, as he had his Judy with him, was
more than he could hope), he would have gladly lent a band to encore the whole performance:
nay, had he been Briareus, and had fifty pairs of hands, he would, to gain his object, have
sacrificed a pair of milk-white kids on each.
Unlike the Duke in Shaksfeare, Mr. Punch is always merry when he hears sweet music;
and it therefore was with feelings of more than usual pleasantness that when the Work was
over he went to see the Man, or his effigy at least, which Mr. Punch had to unveil. Remem-
bering that the statue of Beethoven at Bonn was unveiled in the presence of "some of the
crowned heads of Europe, who were almost lost in a crowd of 30,000 people," Mr. Punch of
course contrasted the gratifying fact, that the heads who gave their crowns to see Mendels-
sohn unveiled, amounted not to "some"but to some eighteen thousand, and therefore stood
no danger of being" almost lost." Being perfectly au fait at performing public ceremonies,
such as christening Drinking Fountains, and wheelbarrowing First Sods, it is quite needless
to remark that Mr. Punch did the unveiling with his usual graceful ease, and made the usual
short speech with his usual perfect taste. This over, there set in an "ugly rush" for the
refreshments, but as Mr. Punch felt no desire to get his pet corn trodden on, he prudently
reserved his appetite for supper, having taken the precaution, with his usual splendid
foresight, to lay in a hearty lunch. Forming a bright exception to the general rule observed,
* Everybody knows that now she's not a Miss, and that her married name's not Dolby. But Mr. Punch
no more can ieavo off calling her "Miss Dolby," than he cun ppcalc of Jenny Lind by any other name than
"JmCY."
by not smoking a cigar which was anything but
tobacco, Mr. Puma then came into the garden
with Maud, (don't be jealous, Judy,) and en-
joyed the first warm evening in a state of mind
which, like it, was totally serene. Being, how-
ever, still afflicted
"Where the East Wind's pinching fingers
Had laid the grip whence hoarseness lingers,":
Mr. Punch could give few specimens of his
usual moonlight talk; but after speaking of the
"gardels" as really "lookilg quite robaltio il
the boolshile," he gave up taikilg sedtimelt"
as being a bad job.
Of the Fackelzug which followed, Mr. Punch
need only say that it was worthy of His Presence,
and higher praise than this it would perplex hiiu
to conceive. One observer says the torches
"gleamed like fiery serpents;" but "Brobdiug-
nagian glow-worms" were a far more sparkling
simile, and would really have approached quite
as nearly to the truth. A fire of wit, of course,
was kindled by the blaze, and the torches weren't
the only brilliant things let drop. Several jokers
joked about "playing at pitch and toss," as they
tossed about their pitch-slicks to keep them well
in flame; and one unhappy punster who, in
doing this, had let some pitch pitch on his Au-
gers, was mad enough to talk about the pain
as being torch-ure! Another of the mad wags,
however, who was present (and who, if he don't
take care, may end in either going to Bedlam
or in writing a burlesque), carried his mad-
waggery to a still more piteous pitch; for at the
finish of the evening, when he struck his torch
out, he actually called the stroke a coup de
tar.
With the sound of the Elijah yet echoing in
his ears, the sight of the bright bonfire yet daz-
zling his eyes, and the savour of the torch-smoke
yet clinging to his nostrils, Mr. Punch then left
the Palace by his own private exit; and jumping
upon Pegasus, whom Toby had in waiting,
clapped Judy on the crupper, and straight rode
home to supper, and soon fell asleep while
glancing o'er the new Sonnets by Tuppbr.

LONDON OMNIBUS EXCURSIONS.
(Advertisement.)
The proprietors of the Omnibuses that crawl from the West of
London along the Strand, respectfully invite the attention of the
Public to the great advantages to be now derived from taking that
route. By order of the Lord Mayor, no carriages can now pass through
Fleet Street, and in consequence, a new, varied, and delightful excur-
sion to the North, and subsequently Eastward, is offered by the Pro-
prietors, with no addition of charge. To any person having a few
hours in the business part of the day to throw away, the present occa-
sion affords an opportunity which should not be lost. On arriving at
the street leading to the beautiful Bridge so highly eulogised by
Canova, and declared by the great sculptor to be worth coming from
Italy to see, the traveller suddenly turns to the left, and ascends a
stupendous hill, adorned on one side by the classic graces of the
Lyceum, and rendered grim on the other by the Avernian terrors of the
Exeter Arcade. He passes the office of that admirable journal, the Army
and Naty Gazette, and may be fortunate enough to obtain a view of the
historian of the Crimean War, smoking the cigar or calumet of Peace.
The traveller's journey is still marked by objects of the utmost interest,
and he has scarcely regaled his eyes with the glory of the new Lyric
Temple and its Floral appendage, when he comes upon the wild
grandeur of Long Acre, and has a vista gaze at the gloomy gorge
of Drury Lane, whose Bavage inhabitants must excite in the
least imaginative bosom emotions utterly unfavourable to Foreign
missionary enterprise. Pursuing his way through a stern and rugged
country, where the rich scent of the onion nevertheless speaks of simple
happiness, the traveller is finally launched into the magnificent scenery
of Holborn. In this noble region, already crowded to repletion with
its own commerce, to which are now added the gigantic contributions
of the South, he will probably be blocked for an hour or two, and will
have ample leisure to survey the wonders of Nature and Art with which
he is surrounded. He will not fail to note the Black-Gang Shine
(also known as Day and Martin's), the famous Baths of Venice, and
the Westonian Hall of Melody, among the numerous points of attrac-
tion. But a sterner interest awaits him, for in the course of three-
quarters of an hour or more, he finds nimself on the verge of that
terrible descent near which the Church of St. Andrew attests the perils
from which his grateful votaries have miraculously escaped. Here it is
usual to take the celebrated precaution called the Skid, and if the
officer appointed to annex it to the wheel happens to be in the way, it
will probably be fastened. But a traveller should be prepared for
anything. Thundering and rushing, the vehicle hurries down the
awful descent, and if all is well, as it very often is, the passenger,
thankful for his escape, re-commences to climb, and after a fierce
struggle, attains the Church of St. Sepulchre, and the rock-like wall of
the dreadful prison near it. A gentler sensation is awakened by the
sight of the graceful fountain that trickles from the churchyard, re-
minding us that though the clay within it may be moistened no more,
ours is still open to that process, and that we should improve our time.
At this point a traveller who has any business in Fleet Street, and
cannot afford to be carried many miles further out of his way, should
descend, and with the aid of a guide, pedestrianise through a pass
leading South, by which he will ultimately be brought to his object;
but those who have time to spare should not omit to traverse the dark
ravine of Newgate Street, wnich terminates at the Paste of the Great
Saint Martin. Thenceforth the old route is resumed, and the delighted
traveller has time to reflect upon the long and interesting journey to which
the paternal kindness of the Lord Mayor has so pleasantly compelled
him. He will naturally take a small hamper of refreshments, and to the
votary of Nicotia we would whisper that the summit of the vehicle
enables him to indulge his taste. No increase in prices inconsequence
of the enormous increase of the length of the route. The Proprietors
have much satisfaction in announcing, that although it was thought
that their own arrangements, and the eccentricities of the competitive
system of driving, had done all that was possible to protract a journey,
the kind aid of the Lord Mayor of London has enaoled them to state
that there is now no saying when an omnibus ride will be completed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ROYAL ACADEMY.

A SKETCH.-EARLY MORNING-TRAFALGAR SQUARE, MAY 7.
"My Dear Punch,
"Now that it is all over, and I know the worst, I begin to reconcile
myself to my fate. My pet picture, which cost me so many months of labour (and
over which I have smoked so many pipes), was —shall I confess it P—rejected at
the Royal Academy Exhibition. The Chariot which I intended to mount on the
Road to Fame, by a melancholy metamorphosis, became the Patent Hansom in
which I brought my chef d'ceuvre away. It was fated that J, and not my
picture, should be told.
"I was furious at first. I admit. Thoughts of instant and ample vengeance
filled my brain. I glared at the red-legged porter who showed me the fatal list,
and if he had not stood at least six feet two in his pumps I should assuredly have
doubled him up. I learned to 'spar' at Eastminster, but a difference of fourteen
inches in height makes formidable odds in a 'mill;' besides, / might have hurt him;
and after all, was it his fault P I thought better of it, and spared the gentleman in
plush. I took home my Queen of the Goth*, and hung her up, crown and all, over
my mantel-piece, to the admiration of Mas. Kinahan, who sweeps my room every
morning. Borewell, the great critic, came and cut it up (I speak metaphori-
cally) the next day, and I was resigned. Nay, had I not a ticket for the Private
ViewP I smothered my indignation, and went to see the works of my more
fortunate friends.
"A learned and ingenious philosopher of Athens, by the name of Plato, with
whose writings you are doubtless familiar, formerly observed that—
"Beauty alone has this characteristic, that It is at onco the most visible and the most pleasing
of qualities."
"This original and concise remark forms the motto which the R. A. Exhibition
Catalogue bears this year, in accordance with ancient precedent, on its first page.
My attention was first called to it by Scumbleton, who has attained such excel-
lence in the Classic School of Painting; that is to say, in the delineation of gods
and goddesses, and their favourite amusements and pursuits, so admirably described
by Dr. Lemprier'e in his famous Dictionary—* work which, as S. says, should be
wanting iu no studio.
"Well, Scumbleton was muttering in a corner at the
RA., and the following extraordinary sentence reached
my ear:—
"' Noonday Callows, mon! On to Tennis came Moiba.
And who's Egg, FannyP Stay Tony nigh K. 'Any
Smote it on.'
"Good gracious! I thought. Scumbleton is intox—
at least he must have swallowed some 'turpi' by mistake.
What does he mean ?' Noonday Callows!' The artist
of that name knows better than to choose such a time for
his effects. 'On to Tennis came Moiba!' Nonsense.
Mr. Moira is a portrait painter, and doesn't play fives.
'Who's Egg, FanntP' A good joke, indeed! Why an
A. R. A., to be sure! * Stay Tony nigh K.' What!' 'Arry
smote it on.' Who is 'Arry P Where did he smite what,
and why?
"A glance at the Catalogue explained it all. Scum-
bleton was trying to read the Greek text of the above-
mentioned apophthegm, which runs thus in the original:—
"Kuv Si xdWos ilAvov tovt^v £<tx* fio'pav, us fKtpavtaraTov
tivai Ka\ tpaffpuraTov?
"Elbowing my way through a crowd of llie elite, among
whom I noticed the Duke of A., the Marquis op B., t he
Earl and Countess op C, and so on through the illus-
trious alphabet, I reached the East Room. Seniorespriores.
Sir Edwin's Highland Flood swamps everything near it.
A grey and dismal horror pervades the scene. We feel
sadly convinced that yon poor struggling bull will not live
to be British beef; nor can drowning 'Nanny' be con-
verted into 'Alpine kid.' When sunburnt lassies tossed
that load of grass they little thought they were 'saving'
hay—so soon to lose it. Will not the very red herrings
which we see strung up return to their native element?
One might, indeed, believe it—cum gram salis! Well,
well; it is an ill wind that blows no one good; and if man
and beast suffer, at least it seems fine weather for ducks.
"If we had not had enough of water, we might stop to
admire the contrast between Stanfield's Outward Bound,
and Cooke's Bella Venezia—both wonderfully true to
nature; so true that, standing before them, I recall the
ethos of each scene, and must honestly admit that I would
rather be lying in that gondola, as it floats lazily over the
Lagoon, in the full enjoyment of my pipe, than experience
certain other sensations in Ma. Stanfield's fishing-smack
on the British Channel.
"No. 131 is described in the catalogue as The Terrace.
It certainly looks to me more like a lady with a fan, but I
may be wrong. Which is the architectural feature?
"What is the test of excellence in descriptive art P When
we go to the play, leave our cares in the cloak-room-
forget our toothache and 'that horrid bill,'—to take interest
in the little world behind the foot-lights. If, I say, we love
the heroine, feel anxious for the hero, laugh with his funny
friend, and rejoice at virtue triumphant, De sure there has
been good acting. Who can look at Mr. Elmore's pic-
ture without feeling present at the scene itself P The
shouts of the sansculottes ring in one's ears, and one feels
inclined to drag away the penitent girl (was ever peni-
tence so ably drawn P) from the s'de of that shrieking
beldam, and the rest of the horrid crew, before she for-
gets the sad sweet face of Marie Antoinette. Does
Mr. Elmore hint at a moral in that smouldering pipe P
Alas 1 how many pipes of good French clay were put out
for ever, in those days. The furniture is thrown pell-mell:
a chair is already upset. Courage I mes amis. The tables
will soon be turned.
"Look at Mb, Fritii's picture. We boast of the
improved manners and morals of the present age, but there
is one class of individuals which has lost caste in this cen-
tury. A highwayman now-a-days is a low vulgar wretch
with no sort of interest attached to him, save the anxiety
which we all feel that he should be transported. But
Mons. M. Claude Duval was a fine gentleman, and could
step a 'coranto,' I warrant you, as well as his Grace him-
self. Is it the old cavalier's daughter the rogue is dancing
with? Will he finish the minuet before that black lacquey
has signalled aid?
"' Dear, nice, picturesque old days; I wish I had lived
in them,' whispers Miss Frumpington, who is thirty-nine,
and who not only never danced a coranto with a 'cracks-
man' but finds it difficult even to procure a partner for a
quadrille. And so we pass on to another picture.
"If we congratulate Mr. Hook on being able to write
RA. after his name, let us also congratulate the illustrious
vol. xxxviit.

Let us stand a few minutes before Mr. Millais' Black Brunt-

"Where did Mr. Philip hide to witness the august ceremony

down a Duke, with that awful weapon of state hanging over one's head.
The sword of Damocles was a joke to it. For my part, I should have
been first frightened out of my wits, then have fallen into hopeless
love with at least four bridesmaids, and finally I should have stumbled
over Gold Stick in Waiting, who would, doubtless, have annihilated
me on the spot. On the other hand, Mr. Philip, you see, has gone to
work coolly and successfully, and out of this melange of Royalty,

of authority are made responsible for the general ruin which they occasion. On
Irish politics the views of the Pilot will be found equally original and solid, owing
to the application of new principles to current vicissitudes.

The above composition—which appeared the other day in the Irishman
newspaper—is the work of human beings. It is the work of Irishmen.
All Irishmen—even the creature who composed the above tissue of
bombast, bathos, fudge, falsehood, malevolence, and absurdity—are,
undoubtedly, human beings. Ireland has produced many of our
greatest men.
But, now, did ever any Nigger under the sun, even with his brajn
turned by a sun-stroke,—any delirious Nigger,—any black maniac in
the work!,—utter such belluine ravings as those which are reduced to
-=——— — j
writing in the notification foregoing P The faculty of reason is the
speciality of man. If you admit it in the case of all Irishmen, you
must recognise its existence in that of all Niggers, none of whom can
be lower than the low Irish who vent such rabid folly as that just
quoted. But as every Irishman is white (when he is washed), it is
obvious that, if the peculiar institution" of America is to be main-
tained, it at least ought no longer to be limited by considerations of
colour. It should extend to inferiority of moral and intellectual type,
and then it would assuredly include other people than Africans.
It is not to be denied that sparks of rationality are visible in the
Boston Pilott Irish advertisement. The author tells us that "in
every number articles are published which, in the present state of the
law, it would be dangerous or impossible to publish in Ireland," and
that a certain absurdity is accomplished "with a hand unpalsied by the
apprehension of British penalties." Here is at least evidence of the
power of perceiving and apprehending consequences. These passages
are remarkable, taken in connection with the circumstance that great
stress is laid upon the fact that the Pilot is an eminently Catholic
newspaper. His Holiness the Port, in his late edict of Excommuni-
cation, adverted, in a precisely similar strain, to the unfortunate
truth, that there were certain localities, and those the very places
in which the publication of that anathema was most desirable,
wherein it would be unsafe to post it. Thus there is some glimmering
of sense to be noted in the Pope's Bull, as well as amid the blunders
and balderdash of his peculiar people.
THE SEVEK1TY OF SMALL GERMANS.
Contemplating the various objects of interest accumulated in a
pork-shop window, we generally observe a number of little sausages,
labelled 'Small Germans." The sight of these cylindrical and savoury
articles universally reminds the British beholder of the petty sove-
reigns of Germany. The minor German sovereigns are, however, very
much smaller than the smallest of German sausages, and their small
Governments are despotisms in a small way, very apt to perpetrate
small acts of harsh and mean repression. The subjoined paragraph,
quoted from the Morning Post, instances a piece of small tyranny which
has just occurred in the diminutive domain of one of their Serene
Littlenesses:—
"Liberty or the Prebs in Baxe-Qotha.—On the 6th inst. the Editor of the
daily paper published in Gotba, M. Btollbero, was sentenced to threo weeks' Im-
prisonment for inserting an article in his Journal which was considered to be an
affront to a reigning German sovereign. The Emperor of Austria was the poten-
tate in question, and it was considered no palliation of tbe offence that the unfor-
tunate Editor had only copied the article from the London Times. A short time
ago another Qerman Editor was similarly sentenced for the same kind of offence."
De minimis non curat lex is a maxim on the reverse of which is
administered the exiguous absolutism of these small Germans. They
resent a trivial affront offered to themselves or their connections in
the spirit of a wretched pedagogue when the despicable old brute
cruelly whips a little boy tor having chalked up the rudiments of a
human figure, and written under it Old Fogy;" an appellation which
the aged savage supposes to have been meant for himself, or for Mr.
Squaretoes over the way. The act of silly severity above recorded is
even more paltry than that of the exasperated pedant. A scurrilous
attack upon a great German may be regarded as a sensible, if not a
reasonable, provocation of a small one; but the body of the offence for
which M. Stollbero has been sentenced to three weeks' imprison-
ment was an article copied from the Time*.
Temperate criticism is, by the small German mind, "considered to
be an affront to a reigning German sovereign," and such an one as
the Emperor or Austria. It is no less deplorable than remarkable
that the particular small German in whose Lilliputian territory the
liberty of the Press has been assailed with the pusillanimous resent-
ment evinced in the incarceration of M. Stollbero, should be no
other than the Dure of Saxe Cobukg and Gotha, who, with whatever
affection he may regard the Austrian Autocrat, should, one would
imagine, be linked by a stronger chain of sympathy with a Court <>f
which the Throne is a seat of constitutional Government supported by
representative institutions. The British, rather than the Austrian
Empire, appears to be the model which this small German Duke would
naturally have chosen to go by in ruling his miniature dukedom or
dwarfdom.
A Fine Source of Bevenue.
Mr. Doulton, a judicious member of the Metropolitan Board of
Works, is reported to have proposed a capital suggestion for obtaining
funds to defray the expenses of the embankment of the Thames, or any
other similar improvement. It is that of establishing an octroi duty on
all provisions entering London. He means, of course, merely the
City; and when the enormous quantity of provisions consumed at a
single Lord Mayor's dinner is considered, it will be obvious that a very
small tax on the civic larder would raise money enough to pay for any-
thing.

A BREWER IN SUPPORT OF THE BEER-IMPROVEMENT BILL.
HE Puritans were
wont formerly to do
their preaching upon
tubs, but there has
lately been a deal of
preaching upon beer-
barrels. In the House
the other evening the
Member for Brick
Lane poured out his
frothy periods till he
half stupefied his
hearers, who did their
best to bring him up,
by crying out "Di-
vide!/1 The Mow-
ing is a sample of
the pure and unadul-
terated word-stream
which gushed forth
from him:—
"Mr. Buxton denied altogether that the agitation against the BUI had been in any way got up
by the London Brewers. They did not care a farthing about the matter, and had entirely refused
to stir in it. Indeed, they would have been foolish to do so. French wine would never drive out
ale and porter. Their competition might, perhaps, check adulteration, but that would be all
and with respect to the li
public opinion would bo so
gether."
If Mr. Buxton had intended to support the Beer Improvement Bill, he could
hardly have adduced two stronger arguments than these for it. To say that it will
tend to check adulteration, and help to put an end to the licensing system, is to
bring to clearest light the merits of the measure, and render it quite needless to
say another word for it. Mr. Buxton, however, does say several more words for
it, although his aim in saying them was doubtless just the contrary:—
"Upon these and other grounds he should have preferred to support the Bill; and would have
done so if the division had taken place, after the first discussion; but subsequent close thought
upon the subject during the recess bad brought him reluctantly to the conclusion that he must
vute against the Bill, and that upon the ground which, coming from him must he knew, seem
an absurd, hypocritical pretence—that it would powerfully tend to promote intoxication. He
would make no attempt to defend himself from the ridicule this assertion might excite, but
would pass on to the question which deserved most anxious thought—whether the result of that
Bill would not lnovitably be a fearful increase of drunkenness. Of course, if tho Bill would
merely create a general consumption of light wines, every reasonable man would give it his hearty
stem, if tho Bill were thrown out through their means!
that there would be an end to the licensing system alto-
support; but the question was, whether its result would not prove
to be au almost universal sale, under the name and pretence of wine,
of ardent spirits. (Hear, hear.)"
If this great Brewer entertains such a pious hate of
drunkenness, he ought in all consistency to give up making
beer. But getting drunk on beer, and getting drunk upon
cheap claret, are doubtless in his eyes proceedings vastly
different. The one is a light matter, ana with Englishmen
a national and natural propensity; but the other is with
them a most unnatural offence,, and must be regarded as
a deed of blackest dye. So likewise the spirits which are
vended at a ginshop have, in brewers' sight, a far smaller
demoralising influence, than those which are, alas! to be
procured soon at the pastrycook's, where, besides the potent
brandy-ba'1 -nd fiercely ardent hot-spiced nut, there will
ere long be ■ i the terrible, and fiery Bordeaux.
But, as v< have said, by his last -quoted remarks, as well
as by his fhst, Mr, Buxton did good service to the Bill;
for their absurdity induced Sir Morton Peto to get up,
and he explained thus from experience how he thought the
Act would act:—
"Km S. M. Pbto intended to support tho second reading of the
Bill, believing that, however objectionable certain parts of the mea-
sure might bo, they could easily be amended in Committee, lie had

the wine countries tho labourers were far more sober than they were
elsewhere. (Hear, hear.) During four years he had been engaged in
the construction of the Mediterranean lines of railway, where some

Three thousand Piodmontcse were employed; those men during the

To persuade an English workman to give up English
beer, would be a feat even more difficult than to hear a
pious brewer lecture upon drunkenness without feeling a
temptation to smile at his remarks. Still we think, if
Mr. Buxton could somehow persuade our navvies that
"Bordeaux" was in fact but another name for "brandy,"
he might give some slight impulse to its importation;
although we should not much mind betting him a bottle
of it, that however much our countrymen might be
induced to take to the taking of French wine, they would
I not drink one drop the less of British beer.

A Ladt friend of ours, who having a small house of course likes to
give large parties, has found that, since the fashion of wide petticoats
came in, her rooms will hardly hold half the number that they used to
do. In order therefore to make space to accommodate more guests,
she has lately hit upon the notable expedient of putting a curt post-
script to her female invitations, requesting moderation in circumference
of dress. The postscript consists merely of the letters "P. C. L.,"
which being interpreted, mean simply: "Please Come Limp!"

The House of Commons is proceeding with the Bleaching and
Dyeing Works Act, designed to prevent the overworking of helpless

Works, it is to be hoped, will cease to be Killing Works.
DR. CUMMING'S LAST REVELATION.
Mr. Punch finds in a Liverpool journal the following, part of a
lecture which Dr. Cumminq has been delivering on Prophecy:—
"He hod been, he said, taunted in the columns of Punch with having, notwith-
standing his belief that the world was to come to an end in 1S67, recently renewed
tho lease of a cottage for 60 years. The accusation, he said, although not literally,
was genorolly true, but his answer to it was, that a belief in prophecy should not
override common sense. The doctor was frequently applauded throughout hia
eloquent lecture."
And by no person should he have been applauded more loudly than
by Mr. Punch, if that gentleman had had the good fortune to be in the
school-room at Claughton, where the lecture is reported to have been
delivered. The last quoted sentence is so admirably frank that Mr.
Punch cannot withhold his tribute of veneration. In other words,
although it is all very well, in the way of business, to work the old
Hebrew scrolls, which boil down into capital stock for the rather thin
yet spicy soup vended by our Doctor, he has no notion of eating his
own cookery. We wish we were as certain of our friend's orthography
as we are of his common sense, and would give a trifle (say the next
three hundred Tupperian sonnets) to know whether, in his private
ledger, he does not spell Prophets as worldly people spell the opposite
of Losses. But do not let him again use the word "taunt" in
reference to anything that is said about him by his profound admirer,

If prizes are given for the best designs of frescoes to adorn the
interiors of public buildings, and for other plans and devices of an

order to elicit useful inventions P London is about to be drained, and
all the drainage is to be cast into the sea. That, if not casting bread
upon the waters not to return, is casting upon the waters a quantity of
valuable material which might be made to return in the shape of bread.
Manure is but a segment of the circle of nutrition. It feeds the corn

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OP PARLIAMENT.
N comes Monday, May 7.
Tautology, Viscount Wil-
liams, means—but, suppose
you look it out in your
Richardtionary. Having ac-
quainted yourself with the
meaning of the word, state
whether there is any tautology
in the following sentence.
"Allusion was made to-day
to the recent ryot disturb-
ances in Bengal" Do not
be in a hurry, but be sure
you understand the word
ryot. The public will pardon
Mr. Punch't paternal atten-
tion to hisfavouritepupil, the
rather that in the first place
Mr. Punch does not care
whether he is pardoned or
not, and that in the second
there was nothing else of the
least interest in the proceed-
ings of the half-hour during
which the Lords sat.
In the Commons, Mr.
Sidney Herbert denied the
denial to the Volunteers of*
their military rank when they
go to Court: and moreover added, that they are at perfect liberty to
delight their Sovereign with the sight of their uniforms—state-
ments that will make happy the minds of a good many handsome
young patriots. Afterwards came on rather a curious business.
There is a pnpcr published in London, as some of our readers are

aware, called the Times. Among its proprietors is a gentleman
named Walter, who is also a Member of Parliament. Its Editor
is Mb. Delane. The Premier of England is Lord Palmerston,
who has a handsome house on the right hand side of Picca-
dilly, as you go westward. He and Lady Palmerston give very
pleasant parties there. Mr. Horsman is also a Member of Parliament
—at present. In the Times newspaper some mornings ago appeared
an article in which Mr, Horsman was mentioned in a way lie did
not like. Mr, Walter having expressed in the House a sentiment
in accordance with a portion of the article in I lie Times, Mr. Horsman
wrote to him announcing an intention of bringing the subject under
the notice of the House. Mr, Walter having waited for this
operation, and Mr, Horsman not performing it, the former gen-
tleman to-night brought up the matter himself, and correspondence
was read, and speeches were made. Mr. Horsman thinks that Lord
Palmerston influences the Times by inviting Mr. Delane to evening
parties, and Mr, Horsman attacked Mr. Walter, as a proprietor
of the paper, and also because, while himself a Member of the House,
he is supposed to sanction the rather strong censures occasionally
made upon it, and upon distinguished personages, by the newspaper in
question. Mr. Walter's complete reply is, that he is not the editor
of the paper, and has nothing to do with its management. The Hors-
man onslaught was so excessively ridiculous that its absurdity would
have been its only claim to Mr. Punch's tolerant notice, but that the
discussion brought up our friend the Premier, who came out in a mag-
nificent way. He utterly laughed to scorn the idea that Mr. Delane,
or any other gentleman of sense and character, could be influenced in
the discharge of his duty by invitations to evening parties; an idea that
one would think could have emanated only from the mind of a third
class lady of the " genteel" class, to whom a soiree at a Swell house is
a convertible term for Paradise. Lord Palmerston "only wished he
could exercise such an influence," but had no such good fortune. "He
was very proud when such persons as Mr. Delane did him the
honour of coming to see him, without undertaking any other engage-
ment than that which Mr, Delane performs so well—of always
making themselves very agreeable." He stated that Mb, Disraeli

sometimes came to see him on the same terms. And Oar Dear Old
Pah, and we call him old in sign of our familiarity and affection, for be
is not old, added, with reference to Mr. Horsman's remarks—
"He has said that the Contributors to the Press are me
Favourites and Ornaments of every society into which they
enter. He is perfectly right in that expression. They are
generally men of great information and great attainments,
and therefore they are men whose society must be agreeable."
Suffused with ingenuous blushes, yet conscious that the Premier's
words are the most unimpeachable truth, Mr. Punch, as the recognised
Head and Representative of the Press of England, makes Lord
Palmerston one of those bows, to behold which is beatitude, to
imitate which is despair. _
Mr. Punch would add, that his friend Mr. Disraeli bore testimony
to the utility of press strictures, and said that, provided they were
able, he did not—even when they were directed against himself—object
to "general malignity." This must have been meant for the Saturday
Review, which compares Vivian Grey to Louis Napoleon. Certainly
it had no application to Mr. Punch, who has never flung at Mr. Dis-
raeli anything more hurtful than a soft-boiled rosebud.
The great business of the evening being done, the adjourned debate
on the Wine Licences Bill was resumed, and after a great deal of
opposition, some of it foolish and the rest hypocritical, Mr. Gladstone
replied, and the Pothouse-raw-Pump Coalition was smashed up by a
majority of 267 to 193.
Tuesday. Lord Ebury on Prayer-Book Reform. He suggested a
great many alterations, of much theological importance, and wished
for a commission to prepare the same. The Archbishop of Canter-
bury said, that there was no possibility of theologians agreeing on any
subject, and therefore the subject had best be let alone. Thus spoke
the Evangelical Hierarch. The Bishop of London denied that there
was any real practical grievance. Thus spoke the Common-sense
Hierarch. The Bishop of Oxford believed that changing formularies
would lead to attempts at change of doctrines, and the proposal was
dangerous. Thns spoke the High-Church Hierarch. In spite, there-
fore, of Dr. Sumner, theologians can agree upon ocoasion, and as Mr.
Puff says in the Oritic, "when they do agree their unanimity is
wonderful." Three lay-lords charged on the same side as the
spirituals, and Lord Ebury, borne down by such an array of
championship, withdrew his motion, and probably by this time has
become a Highly Particular Baptist.
Lord John Russell stated that he bad ordered the appointment of
a salaried official to protect the graves of our heroes who died in the
Crimea.
Mr. Benttnck had a grievance. He knew a boy who wanted to be
a factory boy at Portsmouth; and this boy being plucked by the Civil
Service Examiners because he could not spell, Mr. Bentinck wanted
to see the Examination papers. He declared that the boy spelt as well
as a great many Members of Parliament. The proposal that Mr.
Bentinck should, in fact, examine the Examiners, was too prepos-
terous, and it was, of course, rejected. Mr. Bovill, who is a lawyer
of great eminence, disapproves of the Government plan for dealing
with Stock-Exchange transactions, and had introduced a Bill of his
own, legalising bona fide business, but not gambling; but his measure
was rejected, on the principle that business should be free, and people
should take care of themselves.
Then came the motion for the Third Reading of the Paper-Duty
Repeal Bill, on which there was a spirited debate, Sir Stafford
Northcote moving as an amendment that, in the present state of the
revenue, we ought not to throw away a Million and a Quarter of
Revenue. The old arguments were urged, as were some new ones:
but Mr. Gladstone said that opposition was too late—the House had
pledged itself to the remission, and had laid on new taxes to supply the
place of the Duty. To recoil would be to shock public faith in the
Legislature. Mr, Disraeli, in a slashing attack on the Chancellor
of the X, denied his position, derided his finance, and said that the
House ought to re-consider a premature and precipitate vote. And on
division, the Bill bad what is termed, we believe, a Squeak for it; for
the numbers were 219 to 209—whereat the Conservatives cheered
woundily. Nay, they actually got another vote, that of Mr, Herbert
Ingram, who has been labouring for years to get the Duty taken off,
and who, leading the van of his friends, as he thought, got into the
lobby with the Noes, and, despite himself, was made oy the Speaker
to record a vote against his favourite measure. Mr. Punch, however,
thus sets him right with-Boston and The Ages.
Wednesday. Chiefly remarkable for determined but unsuccessful
I attempts to overthrow the Bill for protecting the poor girls who work
in the Bleaching and Dyeing factories from being themselves Bleached
! by heat and hideous hours until they lie down to Die. Sir James
'Graham took an opportunity of declaring his belief that the women of
England were not deteriorating; and in proof that the men were not,
he adduced the recent display of valour by the British Lion, as repre
sented by Sir Thomas de Saters.
Thursday. Lord Derby sees a chance of doing mischief to the
Government, and is going in, he says, for a fight, with little Lord
Monteagle for a backer. Encouraged by the small majority on the
Paper Bill, their Lordships declare that they will not permit such a
throwing away of revenue, and mean to oppose the Second Reading in
the Lords. This is the first time Mr. Punch has heard that, by the
Constitution as now established, the Lords have anything to do, except
formally, with questions of Taxation, and he hopes that Derby and
Monteagle will not take it unkind if, in the event of their persisting
in the menaced course, he should feel it his duty to send a Fourpenny
Telegram from Chancery Lane to the Tower of London, instructing
the Constable to see that the Axe is comfortably Bharp, and to order
blocks for two.
In the Commons, a long and rather amusing discussion on the Wine
Licences Bill, in Committee, was every now and then agreeably and
satisfactorily broken by the Pothouse and Pump Party trying a struggle,
and getting a tremendous floorer.
Friday. The Central America question is, according to Lord Wodb-
house, in a satisfactory way to settlement; but be insisted on being
mysterious for the present. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe made a
really interesting speech on behalf of the Protestants in Turkey, who,
he says—and he knows more of the matter than anybody in the world
—are about the only honest and truth-telling subjects the Padishah
has. The Sultan himself likes them, but of course the scoundrels who
are in authority in Turkey do not, and they are exposed to persecution
and danger. He urged that they ought to be protected. Loud
Wodeiiouse agreed, but said that it was not so much the Turks, as
the Christians of other than Protestant views, who were malignant
against the latter. He hoped, however, to do something for the Pro-
testants. A Bill for dealing with Church "brawlers was read a
Second time. It will, if passed, bring the persons who yell, and throw
hassocks, and kick down altar-rails,—persons termed by Lord Chan -
worth "miscreants,"—under the speedy and unfavourable notice of a
Police Magistrate.
Charley Napier brought up the Gun-boat frauds, and insisted upon
having somebody hanged, in which Lord C. Paget promised to oblige
him, if possible. Lord John Russell made his usual multifarious
reply to the Catechism of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, but
the only point for notice was bis solemn asseveration that he does
mean to go on with the Reform Bill. There was a debate about
Sir Charles Trevelyan, the Governor of Madras, who so much
disapproves of Mr. Wilson's plan for taxing India, that he has
issued his own Protest against it, for which insubordination Loud
Palmehston, with much regret at losing so able a man, dismissed
him by the next post, and appointed in his place Sir Henry Ward,
Governor of Ceylon, who is favourably known for having so
sharply and speedily put down the rascals in the Ionian Islands, who
rebelled some few years ago. Sir Joseph Paxton appointed his Com-
mittee on the Thames Embankment, and it seems a very sensibly-selected
Committee, to whose recommendations men of business, and practical
statesmen, must lend respectful attention. Mr. Punch, however, will
occasionally look into the Committee-room and keep all straight.
The political atmosphere looks cloudy, and there seems a storm
coming up. Mr. Gladstone is particularly recommended to look out
his umbrella.
DEAR LORD GREY.
(SONG BY L—D Jf—N R— SS—L.)
He's all my fancy painted him; he's fractious, he's malign;
Though his party's not another's, it never will be mine.
He loved us not, he never meant what he professed to say:
Oh! the tie, the tie is broken between me and Dear Lord Grey.
His speeches are all taken down—they stand in black and white:
His envious eye now languishes, now flashes with despite.
His speech is spoken not for us, but quite the other way;
Oh! the tie, the tie is broken between me and Dear Lord GnEY.
Old stories he has hoarded up to cast them in my face;
I little thought that he could be so vengeful and so base.
The secrets of our camp how mean to publish and betray!
Oh! the tie, the tie is broken between me and Dear Lord Grey.
The struggle now will soon be o'er, the weary conflict cease,
My pledge at last will be redeemed, and I shall be at peace.
And when Reform is set at rest, the Whigs will haply say:
Oh! the tie, the tie is broken between us and Dear Loud Grey.
For the Opera Stalls.
"So Mario and Mongini take subscriptions for the Sicilian revo-
lutionists," observed Lord Palmerston to Mr. Punch the other
evening. "Just so," replied the latter nobleman, "and there's
Twenty Pounds to begin with." "Eh, how do you mean?" asked
Pam. "Why, my dear Lord, there are (wo tenners."

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XVI.—PKRIOD: THE REIGNS OF HENRY
SECOND, RICHARD THE FIRST, AND JOHN.
THE

E come now to a period
when a new source of intel-
ligence is opened to assist
us ; and truthful as our pre-
vious descriptions may have
been, we shall if possible
surpass them in fidelity to
fact. Our authorities have
hitherto been manuscripts
and books,in which a recent
bank fraud shows one can-
not place much confidence;
but we now can rest our
statements on a much more
solid basis than that which
pen-and-inkmanship is able
to supply. To the evidence
on paper we may now add
that on stone; and our most
graphic of descriptions will
for awhile be lithographic.
The monumental effigies on
view in our Cathedrals,
sculptured in the habits of
the persons as they lived,
afford the best of pictures
of the costumes of the age;
and as a pleasant time for
travelling is now, we hope,
at hand, we mean to make a circuit to all our ancient cities, for the
purpose of inspecting the old tombs which they contain. This jour-
neying of course will be repugnant to our feelings, as it must in some
measure cause us to be idle, and men are never truly happy excepting
when at work. But the interests of the public are paramount, of
course, to our comfort and convenience; and the knowledge of the
fact that we are writing for posterity, will sufficiently repay us for our
sacrifice of time.
Henry the Second, we are told, was the first of English sovereigns
for whom the sculptor's art exhausted the pomp of woe by graying a
stone effigy of him on his grave. But the writer who states this had
not the advantage of peru-
sing last month's Punch,
or he would have seen
that Henry the First
had his effigy engraved,
as our careful artist
sketched it to adorn our
thirteenth chapter. This
effigy, however, is ex-
tremely rudely executed,
and affords but little in-
sight in the matter of
costume; so that it is not
until the Second Henry's
period that we derive
much information from
this monumental source.
That the latter king
was buried in the Abbey
of Fontevraud, is a fact
with which the reader has
doubtless been acquainted,
although since he left
school he may have pos-
sibly forgotten it. The
monarch's effigy presents
him as he lay in state.
I "vested in his royal
habits," which, according tienry tub second in "ye maze at wodestoke."

were buried with him.
As the sculptors used to paint some portions of their work, the
colour of the king's robes is as patent as their cut; at least, patent
I to oDservers who have got good eyes, and can see with some distinct-
ness through the dust of ages. Hence are we informed1 that the
royal boots were green, and that the royal spurs were golden, and

of his effigy at Fontevraud, is a conclusive proof of the correctness of both authorities.

fastened with red leathers. The crown was also golden, shaped at top
like upright leaves; and the long tunic, or dalmatica, was crimson,
starred with gold.
According to his effigy, the king carried a small sceptre, and a
large ring on his right hand; and both his gloves were jewelled
in the middle of their backs, a mark of either royalty or high eccle-
siastic rank. His mantle, which was fastened by a brooch on the
right shoulder, was originally coloured of a reddish sort of chocolate:
but several coats of paint have been plastered on the garment, ana
may have been meant to hint that it was several times dyed. The.se
coats of many colours on the mantle of the sovereign have been le-
vealed by the sand-paper and the zeal of antiquarians, whose happy
diligence in scraping ancient effigies and statues has, on more than one
occasion, brought them into a sad scrape.


RICHARD THE FIRST AND JOH*. FROM THEIR EFFIGIES AT FONTEVRAUD
AND WORCESTER.
The effigy of Richard the First in the same Abbey, and that of
John which may be seen in Worcester Cathedral, are distinguished,
we are told, by "nearly the same features" as those of their dad's
effigy, which we have described; and inasmuch as both their noses
have been chipped, we may regard them fairly as chips of the old block.
The above description therefore bears some truth upon the face of it,
for so far at least as their chipped noses are concerned, the brothers
bear a marked resemblance to the Corsicans, inasmuch as it is puzzling
to distinguish which is which. There is, however, nothing remarkable
in this, since effigies have seldom their nose-tips left unbroken, and
their faces are in general very much alike. We may take then the
word "features" as applying to the costume rather than the counte-
nance, and as extending to the figure as well as to the face. Both the
sons are, like their father, represented in two tunics, of which the
upper had loose sleeves, and was known as a dalmatica. Over this they
both have a mantle on their shoulders, and both are girded round the
waist with a rich embroidered belt; while to further their resemblance,
each wears boots and spurs and gloves, which like their father Henry's
are jewelled on the back. John's dalmatica, however, is shorter than
his brother's, and his mantle falls behind, with no frout fastening, from
the shoulders, whereas Richard's is brought forward and fastened on
the breast. The two effigies are also slightly different in attitude; for
while RicnARS holds his hand as if he had the stomach ache, his
brother John holds his as though he had a bad stitch in his side.
Moreover, further to distinguish them, King John is represented as
standing on a creature which appears a kind'of cross between a lion
and a poodle, it being difficult to say which of the two it is least like.
We may find something further to say about these monsters when we
come to speak of the monumental brasses; and we need but add of this
one, that the tip of the king's sword is just entering its mouth, and
the creature looks as though about to swallow a steel draught.
As we wish that our descriptions should be true to a hair, we may
notice that Kino Henry's chin is closely shaven, and that his sons
have both of them a short beard and moustaches, which again came
into fashion towards the end of Richard's reign. In its early part a
Londoner who, we are told, was a "seditious" one, received the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

appellation of "William with the Beard," from his defying the old
Norman custom of chin-scraping, which it seems had in the time of
Henry the Second been
revived. We hear a good
deal now about the tyranm
of fashion, but to make ii
a seditious act to let one'.-
beard grow, really seems h
piece of despotism sucli
as even Mr. Bright, were
he in power, would hardly
dream of.
We have been thu3 care-
ful in describing these
three effigies, because they
show the royal robes which
were in fashion at this
period, and moreover serve
to acquaint us with the
habits of the nobles which,
we are told, were very
similar both in costliness
and cut. The decorations
of court dresses were like
those at certain theatres,
in respect of being got up
nuite regardless of expense.
Some notion of their cha-
racter and splendour may
be formed from the de-
hen. fcription of a mantle be-
TIC PORTRAIT. WHICH Vjtl EVIDENTLY TAKEN AT lodging tO KING rllCIIARD,
the uohent when in drowned Bis razors. which is said to have been
almost "wholly covered
with half moons and glittering orbs of solid silver, arranged in imita-
tion of the system of the stars." With such a robe as this the
wearer must have looked somewhat like a walking orrery, and Mr.
Adams might have lectured on him as he walked.
The fashion of indenting the borders of the tunics and the mantle
appears to have come in during the reign of Henry the Second, for
in the last year but one of it a statute was passed to prohibit certain
classes from the wearing of jagged garments. It seems that kings
took then as much thought about clothing as empresses do now; and
when they, or their tailors, had invented a new style, they tried to keep
it to themselves, and prevent its getting common. Among his other
royal and fashionable deeds, King Henry was distinguished by having
introduced a shorter kind of mantle than had been in courtly use before
his reign. Hence his grateful subjects nicknamed him "Court
Manteau," and he would have probably been likewise called "Port
Manteau," if his genius had first brought that article to light. This
custom of nicknaming people from their dress was not at all uncommon
in the early ages. In later times the custom has however been cor-
rected, and new vestments have been christened with the names of
noble persons, instead of noble persons being nicknamed from their
clothes. This "Blucjier" boots and "Wellingtons" sufficiently
exemplify, and a still more recent instance is afforded by the christening
of the far-famed Albert hat.
With regard to the crural clothing of this period, stockings and
ehausih were worn as theretofore; and as the Saxon word "hose"
and the Latin one "caligee" both occur in a wardrobe roll writ in
King JonN's time,.we may reasonably infer that those garments were
both worn, although it might perplex us somewhat to describe them.
Sandals of purple cloth, having their soles, or sotulares, fretted with
fine gold, are likewise catalogued as parts of the costume of that
sovereign; and by "sandals," we opine, are meant the old leg bandages
of which we have made mention as in use among the Saxons. These,
however, were now made of gold stuff or gilt leather, and moreover,
were no longer worn in bands or rolls, but crossed each other regularly
the whole way up the leg, beginning from the very tip of the torn toe.
Whether any sort of trousers were worn over them, is a point which
antiquarians have delighted to dispute. On the authority of Shak-
spkake, it is asserted that King Stephen was a wearer of knee-
breeches,* and hence it has been argued that King John most likely
sported them. Opinions, however, differ upon this as upon most
matters; and one old sceptic says, I trow, Sirs, y1 as toe y' Kyng's
trousers, y* writpr who put ts faythein y" hath not a legge to stand on."

Old England's unta'en Wooden Walls!
"Hearts of oak are our ships, jolly tars are our men,"
Our poets have said so again and again;
.Toiin Bull can match Johnny Crafaud—one to leu—
Singing, Oh, the Wood-Walls of Old England-
Old England's far-famed Wooden Walls!
Imposing and stately those walls may appear;
But strip off their planking, and what sight is here?
Dry-rot and decay, sap aud fungus,—Oh, dear!
Down go the Wood-Walls of Old England-
Old England's secure Wooden Walls!
If our ships' heart of oak be no better than this,
Who knows but. our men's may be just as amiss;
And then the French rod poor Britanrna may kiss,
For all the Wood-Walls of Old England-
Old England's unsound Wooden Walls!
No—thank our kind planets—the stuff of our crews
Isn't furnished by contracts with rascally Jews,
Or the heart of Britannia might sink in her shoes,
Beside the Wood-Walls of old England—
Old England's betrayed Wooden Walls!
Our ships' heart of oak has a worm at the core,
That deep in the breast of contractors can bore,
Till it lays up its eggs in ships' stuff and ships' store.
Eating down the Wood-Walls of Old England-
Old England's revered Wooden Walls!
The name of that burrowing worm it is 'Greed'—
At home and abroad—north and south—it finds feed;
Where on Lombardy's plains French and Austrian bleed—
Just as in the Wood-Walls of Old England-
Old England's decayed Wooden Walls!
Where our brave Arctic sailors were struggling for life,
Where our soldiers were braving Sebastopol's strife,
There in preserved meat-cans this worm was as rife,
As in the Wood- Walls of Old England-
Old England's ill-used Wooden Walls!
In a specification 'twill breed from a quirk;
In Manchester short-lengths is certain to lurk;
In cheap-tailors' cloth, and in slop-sellers' work,
As in the Wood-Walls of Old England-
Old England's bepuffed Wooden Walls!
What patent or process can Britain employ
To save her poor Oak from this fretting annoy,
Which threatens, e'er long, so much more to dest roy
Besides the Wood-Walls of Old England—
Old England's renowned Wooden Walls?
A Horrible Compound.
The Lord Chancellor has introduced into the House of Lords a
Bill for the fusion of Law and Equity. What a mixture! It seems
like a combination of Strychnine with Prussic Acid.
SCULPTURE IN THE CITY.
In proposing the health of the Lord Mayor and prosperity to the
City of London the other day at the Banquet of the Royal Academy,
the waggish President of that Institution paid t he Civic Monarch aud
his Government, for their patronage of the Fine Arts, a facetious
compliment, concluding with the subjoined jocular panegyric:—
11 Nor in sculpture overlooked by tho City authorities. The splendid hall of the
Mansion House has been partly decorated with marble statues, which do honour
aliko to the artists and to those who Jovised that means of employiog their talents.
(Chttri.)"
In thus pleasantly chaffing the Lord Mayor, however, Sir C. East-
lake made a remarkable omission. He mentioned the hall of the
Mansion House; but he said nothing of Guildhall. He alluded to
marble statues—of course with due emphasis on the word marble—but
he said uothing of Gog and Magog.
"Casting off the Painter."
The good Ship Royal Acatkmy has started on her voyage this year,
with a reef taken in in her cauvas all round. She is said to sail all
the better for this change of trim, as well as for having got rid of a
great deal of her top-hamper.

DEMORALISING INFLUENCE OF THE LATE FIGHT.
Tom, who is an enthusiast of the P.R., actually insists on initiating his Cousin Amy into its mysteries.

TOPPER'S THREE HUNDRED AND FIRST.
Mr. Punch has the pleasure to announce that in consequence of the
unexampled success of Mr. Martin F. Tupier's new volume, Three
Hundred Sonnets, the former has entered into an arrangement with the
latter for a new series of those delightful compositions. The slight
delay in completing the negotiation arose solely from the Poet's sup-
position that having written upon every conceivable place, thing, boy,
girl, baby, and other article in any way connected with himself, he
might fiud a lack of subject. But when a Punch calls to a Tupper
for song, the call wakes poesy from her inmost cell, and Jdr. P. Btates
with delight that the supply is again turned on, and will be continued
until further notice.
SONNET CCCI.
TO MT FIVE NEW KITTENS.
Soft little beasts, how pleasantly ye lie
Snuggling and snoozling by your purring sire,
Mother I mean (but sonnet-rhymes require
A shorter word, and boldly I defy
Those who would tie the bard by pedant rule)
O kittens, you're not thinking, I'll be bound,
How three of you had yesterday been drowned
But that my little boy came home from school,
And begged your lives, though Cook remonstrance made,
Declaring we were overrun with cats,
That licked her cream-dish and her butter-pats,
But childhood's pleadings won me, and I said—
"O Cook, we '11 keep the innocents alive;
They 're five, consider, and you've Augers five."
M.F.T.
THE ORACLE OF THE CITY OF LONDON.
Why is the judgment-seat of the Mansion House like the Tripod of
Apollo P Not because it has three legs, inasmuch as it is a quadruped,
as some of its occupants also have been irreverently denominated. No;
the Civic Chair resembles the three-legged oracular stool in the pecu-
liarity of inspiring its occupant, by a myst ic sufflatus, with extraordinary
utterances. These, in the case of the Pythoness, were prophetic; in
that of the Lord Mayor for the time being they consist of flights of
poetry and eloquence, and aphorisms of wisdom. The Sovereign of
the City may, in his natural state, usually deliver himself like a man
of the world, but no sooner is he seated on his throne than he is sure
to break out into the exalted language of metaphor, or the majestic
enunciation of moral truth. For example in point, take the following
extract from the report of honest Pullinger's examination:—
"The Lord Mayor. And I must express tho pleasure I feel at the eourso taken
by Pullinoer in completely exonerating Lytilkton from blame. It is a bright
oasis in the desert of his guilty <
Justin Time.—"What—not rccal Sir Charles Trevelyan!"
snid an old Indian Official. "One minute more, and India would have
been in revolt!"'
If you want to appreciate the splendour of these comparisons, try to
conceive a career in the form of the desert, and an act in the likeness of
an oasis. It would be satisfactory, by the way, to know how the Lord
Mayor articulated the word "oasis." Seated on the throne of civic
inspiration, lie ought to have pronounced it as a word of two syllables,
rhyming with " Moses." Elsewhere, no doubt, he is accustomed to
express his ideas in the simple phraseology of decently educated men;
but presiding in official state, t he Loud Mayor must be the Lord
Mayor, and behave as such. He cannot help himself: he is inflated
with an enthusiastic emanation, and soars like a balloon into the
pompous regions of poetry.
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
The Indigo districts arc up; but what quiet
Can be hoped, where each man in the country's a ryot?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
at 14. Monday. Aft.tr
some Normanby an-
U-Garibaldi cackle,
derided as usual, the
Dl/'KE OP SOMERSET
was compelled by
Lord Hardwicke
(who is a Vice-Admi-
ral on the reserved
list, but who to-night
broke through his re-
serve and made a sen-
sible speech) to make
a statement about,
the Gun Boats. His
chief defence of the
authorities was, that
the mass of the boats
were built under ex-
treme pressure, con-
sequent upon previous
disgraceful neglect of
duty by the Admi-
ralty, and though in
an ordinary house
of business such an
emergency would have
suggested extra-vigi-
lance by one of tie
partners, such pre-
caution was far too
vulgar for My Lords.
Moreover, the Duke
piteously urged that
"Hie snow was on the ground." but how the snow turned the copper bolts into
something else, his Grace did not explain. He thought that it might be well to
appo:nt "a practical man" to help the Comptroller of the Navy in looking after
such matters, said that exertions were being made to repair the rotten boats, and
that more care would be taken in future. A more unsatisfactory speech was never
made, even by a Lord of the Admiralty, and Lord Towssiiend, another reserved
admiral, very properly dwelt upon the wickedness of asking brave sailors to embark
in bad vessels. Mr. Punch suggests that the fire upon the Admiralty be kept up.
He is ready with Punch Crosses for the most distinguished assailants.
The Sunday Yelling and Howling Bill went through Committee, Lord Teynham,
who is for universal suffrage, opposing it on the ground that every man ought to
have a Voice; but he need not use it to the annoyance and detriment of his neigh-
bours. The Bishop op Carlisle stated that he had often had to send out of
church on Sundays to beg that his congregations might not be disturbed in their
religious duties by the peripatetic Howlers. A Bill making it easier to convict
persons committing assaults and similar offences was passed, Lord Westmeath
not considering it severe enough in regard to persons who drive over you in the
streets. Caveat ambulator is a good rule, but drivers of all kinds have yet to be
rid of an idea that everybody is bound to get out of the way of any and everything
that has a horse to it. In Russia, the rule is the reverse, and human life and limb
are treated as more important than the saving of five minutes by a Swell in a
Hansom, or a ruffianly Van Demon.
In the Commons, a Bill which was called the Newspapers Conveyance Bill because
it was a Bill for preventing the conveyance of newspapers, was abandoned by Mr.
Gladstone, amid ironical cheers. The English of t he matter is, that at the Post.
Office newspapers are disliked, and it is desired to take away their character of
Let ters, and the impressed stamp that enables a person to send a paper to his friend
without, extra charge. Sir Rowland Hill wishes newspapers to be looked at as
mere Printed Matter. But the terrible Gladstone has sometimes to be checked
in his fiery career, and it has been so strongly intimated to him that a newspaper
is something more than a bundle of proofs of Homeric Fancies, or an Essay on
the Church and State, that he has had to drop his measure. Mr. Punch was not
in the House at, the moment, but meeting the Wiscount. and asking what excuse
Giaddy had made, his lordship replied: Well, he said III was hill, and that eed
hinquire more fully into the fax of the case."
Some Irish fools are being entrapped into the service of the Pope, and are being
hired by General Lamoriciere to kill the Bomans in the event of their rising
against Pope Pius. In reply to a question, Mr. Cardwell said, that the pro-
ceeding was unlawful, and Government has issued a proclamation on the subject,
hut this seems a mistake. The more of such animals that can be cleared out of
Ireland the better—it is a following out of the mission of St. Patrick.
The Wine Licences Bill was taken through Committee, and there was a good
Jeal of smart talk, especially on Sabbatarian points, and—what seemed to interest
t he Committee more—on the probable adulteration of liquors by the lower class
of vendors. In the course ot the debate, Mr. Gladstone spoke of Gin as that
"detestable" liquid. The Duke op Punch is too true an Aristocrat, pur sang, to
be afraid of avowing his liking for anything—he leaves it to Genteel Polks to
abstain, vulgarly, from clay pipes, the tops of omnibuses, periwinkles, pits of
theatres, overing of posts in the street, or any other
relaxation, merely from stuck-up feelings; and he orgs to
state, in answer to Mr. Gladstone, that a glass of
good gin-and-water is a very good thing, at proper times,
and that a man who cannot afford to give good wine had
better stick the above before his friends than public-hou^e
port, advertised claret, and beestly Marsala, even though
paraded in the handsomest crystal decanters and jugs that
can be bought at the Crystal Palace. Besides, gin is a
favourite with all true Artists: —
"Bpiritus intua alit, totamquo lnfiua per Artui—*
The Nuisances Removal Bill followed, but should have
been discussed with the question about enlisting Irish
hirelings for the Pope.
Tuesday. Lord Redesdale having unfortunately fixed
his Light Weights in Racing Bill for the eve of the Derby,
postponed it. Statesmen should be more careful when
dealing with the vital interests of the nation. Lord Clan-
ricarde let off some Indigo Indignation, touching the way
the Indian planters of that blut stuff treat their labourers.
The Duke of Argyll said the planter was not so blue as
he was painted.
Lord Palmerston had his racing topic to dispose of.
He moved the adjournment of the House over Wednesday,
the 23rd, the day for holding our Ludi Circenses, as M k.
Edwin James classically remarked, havinir been looking
at Adam's Roman Antiquities, edition 1825, page 311,
right hand, nine lines from bottom. Considering that
Lord Palmerston has Mainstone in the race, and Lord
Derby has Cape Fly-away, and that a third horse is
actually called Lord Palmerston, the interest of our legis-
lative chiefs in such matters may be comprehended.
Lord Aberdeen's son, Lord Haddock, or some bucIi
name, made a supremely ridiculous speech upon the impro-
priety of allowing money to any school of Art in which the
undraped she-model was studied from. His father, who
was called Athenian Aberdeen, and has so earnest a love
for Greek Art that be actually favoured Russia because
she has a Greek church, ought to have cured his Haddock
of such nonsense. Poor old Mr. Spooner, naturally, took
the same really indelicate view of the case. Sir George
Lewis expressed his lofty contempt for the Haddock, and
Lord Palmerston kippered him in a speech full of good
fun. If it is impossible that the same country which con-
tains Macdowbll's Eve and Bailey's Eve at the Fountain
can hold Haddock and Spooner, Mr. Punch must avow
that he prefers keeping the diviner images, and somehow
getting rid of the coarser ones. Pam wanted to know
whether the latter would like to stick crinoline on the
models, or would be content with African garb. The other
Wiscount observed, with more truth perhaps than gushing
politeness, "Nude, indeed, 1 knew'd Addock was a
Nass."
Lord Lovatke (this is the fourth paragraph which Mr.
Punch has the happiness of beginning with "talk of
Lords ") called the South-Eastern Railway Company over
the coals on the subject, of the conveyance of people down
that line to see the Great Mill. He might have made
something of his case, this son of Beverley, if he had
known how to paint it as his father's namesake would
have done; but he made such a clumsy daub, that every-
body laughed. He talked of two or three thousand Ruffians
being taken down to the fight—a foolish way to talk, when
he knew that, whether they had any business there or not.
there were present at the battle persons distinguished in all
the vocations that confer social rank, as well as a great lot
nf the born aristocracy. This is just the sort of Muff that
Pam likes to turn inside out; and he performed that office
with so much gusto that Mr. Paull declared his Lord-
ship had been very fittingly called the Judicious Bottle-
holder by a Certain Facetious Publication—that being the
reverent periphrase with which Mr. Punch is always
alluded to by his inferiors. Lord Palmerston seemed
delighted with the double compliment—his being noticed
by Mr. Punch, and the recognition of that notice in the
House of Commons. He also declared that whether
Messrs. Sayers and Heenan were breaking the peace in
breaking one another's noses or not, the spectators were
doing nothing wrong, an argument which was just the
thing to adduce in answer to nonsense, being in itself
nonsense of the first order.
A Tenant-Right debate enabled Mr. Maguire to abuse
the Irish landlords in a slashing speech, which Mb.
Georgb stated would have converted him to the side

against which Mr. Maguire argued, if there had not been other
reasons for Mr. G.'s non-conversion. The Wiscount said that Mr. M.
was no great admirer of the Georgian Hearer.
Wednesday1! proceedings were so utterly uninteresting, that the only
excuse for them was their exceeding brevity.
Thursday. A Church Festival gave the Lords a holiday, and next
niglil. both Houses took one in honour of the birthday of the Head of
the Church and of the State. To-night, Mr. Gladstone, asked what
he would do if the Lords, next Monday, should throw out the Paper
Duty Bill, refused to anticipate the possibility of such a catastrophe.
There is an awful Being in the world who is known, and feared, as
the Bear. It is said that he has said—or rather not said, for he
never speaks, but has looked, that but mysteries must not be
profanely divulged. Let us see the result of the business in the
Lords. The stars are above us, and Ursa Major looks as if
Enough! More anon.
Then came a beautiful and lovely satire, worthy of Rabelais and the
Furred Law Cats. Garibaldi is helping the Sicilians to revolt
against their tyrant, Bomba fils and everybody in England desires to
help Garibaldi with money. The second law officer of the Crown was
asked whether subscriptions for that purpose were lawful, inasmuch as
Buuba is a foreign sovereign with whom our Queen lias no actual
quarrel. The Solicitor-General said that he did not see that there
was any objection to such subscription. The Pope's Members in the
House were enraged at this, and to-night the Government was again
assailed on the subject, and Sir William Atherton's doctiine was
vehemently impugned by Mr. Hennest. Atherton, Whiteside,
James, Beth ell, Cairns, Boyill, Malins.—there is a splendid array
of legal talent! Well, Mr. Punch having heard all their arguments,
and considered them with all the might of his inconceivable mind,
solemnly declares that he has not the slightest idea whether it is
lawful for him to send his friend Signor Mario a cheque for ten
thousand pounds in aid of Garibaldi, or not. All he can say is, that
though it is usual when there is a doubt to give a criminal the benefit
of it, he shall not do so in the present case, but shall Bend the Ten
Thousand towards the destruction of Bomba. And evidently that
course was the one really recommended by Lord John Russell, who
spoke seven times better than all the seven lawyers, and made it
pretty clear that the Government look on Bomba as a great rascal, and
would be very glad to see him kicked out of the land he oppresses so
brutally. There was some frightful rubbish talked in favour of the
Pope (at whom Edwin James had fired a shot), but it is a little too
late in the day to try to delude anybody into a favourable thought of
that imbecile Humbug.
The Wine Bill went clean through Committee, and the House rose.
Next night, walking about in the mud (what a vile day it was) to look
at the Illuminations, Viscount Punch met Wiscount Williams.
The latter said he had made an epigram. "Bother," said Loan
Punch, good-humouredty, "you make an epigram, you could as easily
make a comet." "But I have," persisted the Lambeth Peer. "Do
you mean a telegram P " asked his friend—"that you might manage."
I mean what I say," rejoined the Wiscount. Everybody should
do that," said Lord Punch. "Look here, said W. W., pointing up
at. a great gas V. R., "Suppose the Queen were to say, 'I wonder
whether my people are as attached to me as I am to them P'—that
illumination would be their answer to the speech." "How so?"
"Why it says-
"Ve Are."

York Herald:—
"The Britons, whose
love of fair play la uni-
versal, stopped the fight
in order to save their
nioney. They claim now
that it is a drawn game.
This will not answer. Bo
far as the money goes,
never mind. Lot Me. Bull, who seems to be growing old and shaky about his plus, keep his
five-pound notes—we are rich enough to do without them. We did not really want his money,
but simply desired to let him know that we could whip him in a matter of muscle as well as
in yachts, clipper ships, steamboats, india-rubber shoos and other things, city railways, sewing
machiuee, the electric telegraph, rending machines, pretty women, and unpickable bank looks."
"This here talk's a trifle tall, but it aint far from the truth. I guess we ;ist
du whip you, whenever we've the chance: and if we don't da it oftener, it's
because you're gettin'old, and we shouldn t like to hut yer. Our Mottoe's 'Go

we air no small snakes, ana we beat you ind on ind in any game you're up to,
from pitch and toss to pickin' locks, or any other Bkientific sort o' time-slaughter.
Our steamers air first-chop, although they sometimes du bust up, and in raisin'

_'m bound to say the critters du git sorter pale and yaller, as if they'd growed
too fast, like an overheated pumpkin. But then you know this here 's the natur
of the animal, and aint brought on as some is by the over workin' of it. No,
Sir-ree jours is A free country and ('cept niggers) there's no slaves in it. And
we don t turn

as that bacca's gro
Bpittin'. And equally A fact is this here assertion:—
"It will be quite idle for the English to deny now either of these propositions—nrst, that the
British Lion has been whipped, and that the American Eagle has a right to scream like half-a-
dozen locomotives; the poor old lion, the bully who has been roaming up and down the earth for
bj many years, roaring at everybody, may go away in some secluded corner and suck his bruised
paws, while all Continental Ku ope laughs at him, and is glad that the United Mates has done it
tie-cond, that they, the Knglish, nave made the fight an international matter. The champion of
England is a semi-official personage—one who is vencratod as the head of his peculiar pro-
fession. Here we have no organised prize-ring, and no champion. But the English accepted
H-cknan as the American champion, and put their beet man against him."
"Wal, and yar 'best man' got licked. Thar aint no flies about it. And what

members of Congress, and escorted to the City Hall, the bands

men of the Classic era, Mr. Heexan believes the post of honour to
be the private station; or that at the best, the only office worth
holding is a fat sinecure in the Custom Houso. If the spontaneous
admiration of a grateful people is of any value to the ohampion of
republican iustitutions, he can have any quantity of it."
"A sinecure aint bad, providin' it's A plump an: and
a snuff-box aint so dusty, supposin' it's A gold un. But

Britishers. It was your prowess at le boxe that kept
Eu-rope at peace with you. But neow your champion has
been whipped, your prestige is all whittled clean away as an
old walking-stick. I calc'late our next clipper will bring

TWO ROADS TO A RED RIBAND.
Bind the star upon the coat
That enfolds the dauntless breast:
Hang the riband o'er the head
That never vailed its crest.
Tell the gallant and the good,
"Thus England honours those,
Who in battle spent their blood,
And in leaguer braved her foes P"
Not in the toys themselves
Lies their ennobling power,
But for the tale they tell
Of many a glorious hour;
Of deeds in field or trench,
Of crumbling fortress held,
When the bravest heart might blench,
And the stoutest hope be quelled.
But lest our England deem
With narrow-minded view,
That but to deeds like these
Honours like these are due,
Between each war-worn soldier
Let a Carpet-Knight be seen—
Our Prince's Privy-purse,
The Equerry of our Queen!
True, they ne'er held a leaguer,
They never braved a foe,
But they've faced the Op'ra crushes,
And the rides of Kotten Bow.
They have stood for hours and hours,
Upon their wearied feet,
'Mid the ante-room's strong flowers,
And the Levee's Indian heat.
Think of the weary watches
In Drawing-rooms gone through:
The nights of hot waltz-practice,
Under ball and powder too!
Think of the long Court-dinners,
Through which they've had to ply
A respectful knife and fork
Beneath the lloyal eye!
Then grudge not to these heroes
The honours they have won—
There is far other weariness
Than battle's, 'neath the sun.
By an heroic Havelock,
At an Inglis'b right hand,
Let Phipps and Grey, with stars as gay,
And blushing ribands stand!
A PATTERN OF RICH PLUSH.
Tub subjoined announcement in the Times will be perused with
interest on many a footboard; in many a hall of liveried retainers
attached to the British aristocracy:—
"The Ch>ncsllob or the Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of the first halves
of Bank-notes, to the amount of £S5, on account of unpaid Income-Tax from 'James."*
Will the conscientiousness of James provoke the emulation, or incur
the derision of John Thomas? There is considerable reason at least
to apprehend that the example of the scrupulous domestic will be less
generally imitated than admired, and not admired very generally, among
his brethren of the gold-laced hat. But these are sentimental specu-
lations. The practical reflection suggested by the above-quoted case
of conscience-money concerns the largeness of the sum to which the
vails of footmen in high places may oe presumed to amount in the
course of the year. The wages of James are perhaps considerable.
Of course they are much in excess of the beggarly salary of a Curate
or a Poor Law Medical Officer. Tbey doubtless had been regularly
assessed, and had yielded their quota to the confiscation of Schedule D.
But the vails which Mb. James might have happened to receive were
altogether inscrutable, so loDg as that gentleman's gentleman was
pleased to retain their figure, under his embroidered waistcoat, in the
recesses of his own bosom.
We see that they are measured by an Income-Tax of £35, calculated
very likely on their annual value. This, therefore, must be very great,
insomuch as probably to enable James to invest ample capital in free-
hold property or the funds; or in foreign securities, if he contemplates
with apprehension the ultimate development of Messbs. Bright and
Gladstone's finance. It is evident, however, that he approves of the
Income-Tax, because he has paid more of it than he was obliged to pay,
and that out of earnings which, if large, must yet be precarious. The
cash thus surrendered is treated by him as the arrear of a just tribute,
whereof lie was bound to make restitution, and not as so much money
which had escaped an iniquitous exaction. Accordingly, although he
was liable to lose his place at a month's notice, and possibly sooner:
consequently to be almost immediately deprived of both vails and
wages; he voluntarily pays Income-Tax on the former as well as the
latter, with a generous oblivion of the good old saying—which finan-
ciers should remember as well asjfootmen—that "Service is no inhe-
ritance." But we may reasonably trust that the ample emoluments of
Mr. James's situatiou have enabled him to make all needful provision
against the loss of that revenue which yields at present so heavy a
per-centage to direct and partial taxation.
THE WASTE-PAPER DEPARTMENT.
Enormously as Mr. Punch, with his stupendous circulation, must
profit by the long-fought-for removal of the Paper Duty, bis readers
will yet do him the justice to allow that he seldom has obtruded the
subject to their notice. It having been repeatedly asserted by the
Government that the Exchequer could not bear the remission of the
tax, Mr. Punch has taken care not to embarrass their position by
echoing the common outcry for repeal With that spirit of self-
sacrifice which has always so distinguished him, he has abstained from
reclamation of his interest in the matter, from the noble fear that,
ad his secret been divulged, it might have biassed those in power to
hare acted for his benefit, and thereby to have imperilled the position
of the State.
But as the fate of the tax will be decided before this sheet is published.
Mr. Punch may say a few words on the matter, without being suspected
of speaking for his pocket. Quite admitting the full force of the argu-
ments employed as to the springs of knowledge being pressed on by the
tax, Mr. Punch conceives that had his lips been openable he could have
emitted a still stronger illustration of the way in which the interests of
the country have been damaged by it. When it is considered how careful
are our Governments of the money of the nation, and what a strict
economy they practise in expending it, of course it must be clear to any
reasoning intelligence that, while paper has been taxed, they have been
stinted in their use of it. That this restriction must have checked the
circumlocutionary practices which are so vitally essential to the busi-
ness of the nation, it needs but little effort of reflection to infer. The
five-and-twenty thousand needless letters written yearly might, but for
the duty, have amounted to some millions, and the welfare of the
country in proportion been increased. How far (should the tax be taken
off) this evil may be remedied, Mr. Punch will not pretend to conjecture
at present. But if he may.prophesy the future from the past, he will not
much endanger his prophetic reputation by predicting that whatever
be its national advantage, the Waste Paper Department will still
flourish and increase.

WHAT WILL THIS COST TO PRINT? is the heading of an adver-
tisement perpetually thrust under the public eye. The advertiser immediately
proceeds to cram together, into two lines, three of the "loudest lies v which are
often invented even in these days. He says that the above question "is a thought
ofteu occurring to Literary Minds, Public Characters, and" but to dispose first of
the preliminary falsehoods, "Literary Minds" is bad English for Literary Men,
The "thought never occurs to them, because what they write is at once and gladly
taken from them by another class whose business it is to know all about the cost,
with which Literary Minds would meddle only to make a mull of that business.

THE SOUTHERN RIGHTS OF MAN.
The American Declaration of Independence reappears in a new
i (lit ion, just published by the Charleston Convention, which met on the
26th of last month, and voted certain resolutions with respect to the
question of slavery. By the fundamental laws of the United States,
slavery, according to these determinations, is a permanent institution,
mid neither Congress nor any local legislature has power to abolish it.
The two propositions thus laid down by the Charleston patriots are
declared by those gentlemen to be "cardinal principles of the national
democracy of the United States on the subject of slavery." The next
lesolution affirms that no territorial Legislature in the Slates has
power "to prohibit the introduction of slaves therein, nor any power
10 destroy or impair the right of property in slaves by any legislation
whatever." These additions to the charter of the American constitution
imply a modification of the doctrine of equality on which that Maxima
Ckarta is founded.
All men are born free and equal except niggers, is the statement of
1 hat doctrine as amended to fit the resolutions of the Charleston Con-
ventionists. To this should be added the negation of certain opinions
which, if they were tenable, would justify a very decided opposition to
t lie extension, if not to the maintenance, of slavery. For example :—
There is no truth whatever in Christianity. The fundamental principle
t.f morality is not "Do as you would be done by," but "Do as you
like with your own." This is particularly the duty of slave-owners.
There is no just Providence that takes any care of black men. There
is uo future state but a happy one for citizens of the Southern States.
The will of the American democracy is the law of right and wrong; let
a resolution of the Charleston Convention stand instead of reason.
The voice of the lower classes of the United States is the voice of
Omnipotence; and it authorises every white to wallop bis nigger.

PERVERSION OF MR. SPOONER
It was stated some time ago that the Pope had caused certain
sculptures in the Vatican to be partially draped—just as the celebrated
American matron had trousers put on the legs of her piano. We
observe with alarm that the Member for North Warwickshire so far
coincides with the Roman Pontiff as to desire to prohibit the employ-
ment of the nude female figure as a model in schools of Art. We are
sadly afraid that the Hon. Gentleman is about to add another example
to the melancholy list of once zealous Protestants who have gone over
to the camp of the enemy. Sympathy with Popish prudery, however,
may soon be followed by adoption of the graver errors of Romauisin;
and we tremble lest we should soon see Mr. Spoonek telling his beads,
or hear that on some fine Friday he dined exclusively on rea herrings!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A CONCORDAT WANTED AT PIEDMONT.
nb Don Gurlino, a holy priest, is
stated to have been sentenced to
seven years' solitary confinement at
Turin, for a long course of such
indiscretion in the Confessional as
that of which Protestant heretics
irreligiously urge the possibility on
the part of confessors as an objec-
tion to the practice of auricular
confession by wives and daughters.
Poor Dos Gcrlino appears to have
pursued, at the churches of 8t.
Charles and the Carmelites, a little
game precisely similar to that repre-
sented in the great Opera now per-
forming at our two Italian theatres
as played by another Don, whose exploits are illustrated on the stage
by his valet in unfolding a certain catalogue as long as a tailor's
pattern-book. The trial of Don Giovanni Gurlino took place
before the Criminal Court at Turin. Ah! friends! what a happy
thing it would have been for the cause of truth if our Don's pecca-
dillos had been perpetrated in the dominions of the pious Francis-
Joseph, which are blessed with a Concordat, under which the Reve-
rend Don's case would have been dealt with by an Ecclesiastical
Tribunal, and not have been subject to the jurisdiction of a court of
common law, as such cases are in the dominions of the excom-
municated V ictou-Emmanuel. Then it would have been religiously
preserved from publication, to the prevention of a scandal which
may seem to confirm the reasonings of heretical depravity. Oh! at
all our public festivals, not, indeed, as the first toast, but before the
health of the Queen, let us evermore drink the Concordat and the
Confessional.
OFFICIOUSNESS OF POOR-LAW MEDICAL OFFICERS.
The following statement, which, with a voucher for its authenticity,
appears in a letter addressed to the Salisbury and Winchester Journal,
is quoted by the writer from one of the medical periodicals. The
Poor-Law Guardians throughout the country, who are so strenuously
opposing Mr. Pioott's 1M1 for the monstrous purpose of effecting
"t he better regulation of n edical relief to the poorer classes in England
and Wales," are doubtlessly able, out of their own experience, to relate
many cases of equally gross excess of duty on the part of medical
'' A workhouse, which contained during the last year an average of more than
25 patients on the sick list, was visited by the medical officer 212 times, and who
was knocked up twice a night- There must, thereforo, have beeu about 5406
personal visits made, the aggregate number of miles Dravelltni was about 105. Esti-
mating each patient to have taken two doses daily, 18,200 were takeu within the
\ oar. About 500 external applications were supplied, one broken arm and one out
of joint were treated; upwurds of 160 separate examinations of persons ou admission
were made, and 62 lung weekly reports were \critton out. Many slight cases, as
tooth-extracting, are not recorded. Many incidental duties are not mentioned.
Fur all this about sixteen guineas are paid 11"
The fallacy of the whole of the foregoing paragraph is comprised in
the last sentence—" For all this about sixteen guineas are paid."
Sixteen guineas, in such a case, are supplied for furnishing paupers
with proper medicine and attendance. The practitioner, whose
ridiculous assiduities are above described, thought proper to give his
workhouse patients the same amount of attendance and physic as he
would have afforded to respectable people. The consequence doubt-
less, was, that if his weekly reports were long, the Union obituary was
short; conditions which ought to be precisely reversed in any such
institution, the doctor of which is up to his business, which, at a salary
of sixteen guineas, obviously consists in making quick work of his
cases, and saying as little about them as possible. "Above all things
no zeal!" is a maxim that Poor Law Guardians desire to impress on
the mind of every medical officer in their employment, for his official
guidance. His private practice is another affair. He has no business
to bestow on a pauper the time, skill, and attention which he devotes
to a guardian, although, takiug one patient with the other, he may be
said to kill two birds with one stone.
A REAL GOOD BLAZING HUMBUG.
A Good deal of fine writing has been expended by the Rogues who
send invitations to ladies to come and buy trash, stating that it is to be
sold "at a sacrifice," which is the case—truth, and husbands' money
being alike sacrificed in any such negotiations. But of all the fine
writing which Rascaldom, scheming on female trustfulness, has ever
sent in large envelopes, inscribed "On the Queen's Service," "Tele-
graphic Dispatch," "Immediate and most Important," or otherwise
calculated to avert the instant pitch into the fireplace to which a
sensible person consigns such things, unread, the following seems to
Mr. Punch to be the best he has seen. He gives the extracts, not to
warn fools, for fools do not read Punch, but to show his readers how
fools are gulled. The document begins thus—
"Fashion, Novelty and Grandeur combined to the astonishment and
delight of Majesty itself, and the just but enthusiastic admiration of a
scrutinizing Public!"
Then comes the announcement of the place where the Sale in question
is to be held—Mr. Punch, of course, not having the slightest intention
of aiding knaves to their prey, gives no hint of the locality. But it is
stated that the place—
"Is devoted exclusively to the
"Appropriation of the most Grand, most Select, and most Costly associ-
ation of Merchandizes ever collected under one roof,
FOR MOST RECKLESS SALE!!!
at Sacrifices truly deplorable, at Losses fearful to contemplate, at a Dimu-
nltion (!) of Prices that would make the most sanguine heart quail beneath
its withering influence.*'
One of the authors of the penny fictions of the day has evidently
been engaged to devote his extra hours to the composition of these
puffs. Here he breaks out again:—
11 These objects are not relative to goods of yesterday, not articles whloh have
outlived their charms—But such as may be said to be NEW, FRESH, nay, almost
warm from THE Loous—possessing to a most meritorious degree beauty, elegance,
richness, splendour, and magnificence, upon which the Votaries of Fashion may
gaze with admiring wonder, till admiration is lost in rapturous ecstasy."
Such language, such ideas, such grammar, are worthy of tne theme—
worthy of the issuers and their intended customers. "You've given
me a bad shilling, Sir," said the hackney coachman to Sheridan.
"All right, old fellow," hiccupped the dramatist; "yours is a bad
coach." The praises of trash should thus be hymned to idiots.
But the fictionist knows better than to puff merely. There be
sentimental fools, who would like to have a tremendous advantage in
a bargain, and also to feel that they were "really doing good" in
cheating somebody. They are remembered as follows:—
"This event arises from the unexpected stoppage of Messrs. Diddlehore and Doo,
of Fetticoat Lane, a circumstance which conveys the mournful intelligence of ruin to
Thousands; As their Wahehooms uterally groaned under the weioht or
Merchandize ALAS I unpaid tor 1
"When it is asserted that ttiis appeal to the Nobility, Gentrt, Clerot and
Public of Great Britaiu has almost for its object the prevention of starvation to numerous
Families on the Continent, the response will be such as might be expected and can
always be relied upon from England's fair Nobility."
How the thief must have grinned as he penned the above passage,
and looked into bis ninepenny Johnson to see whether Nobility is spelt
with two b's or only one.
He concludes with a singular and mystic guarantee, the meaning of
which defies the penetration of anybody but Ms. Policeman Punch.
"The vast amalgamation—matchless in every respect as regards rich-
ness, purity, novelty, and true worth, and the wbole are offered under the
most solemn and guaranteed protest in no instance to exceed 0NE-THIBD
THEIR VALUE—a simple 'bonafide' truth."
"The whole are not to exceed one-third their value." Find out
what that means, beloved reader. You can't P Well, it means that
impudent rascals hope to entrap ignorant fools. But isn't the above
pretty reading P And there are idiots to be taken in by such things—
or they would not be printed.

STRAINING AT GNATS AND SWALLOWING
CAMELS.
"Sir,
(To Mr. Punch)
"I See from the papers that no less than four deputations of
Dissenters waited on Lord Palmerston last week to lay before his
Lordship the objections of the Dissenters to the questions about, people's
religious professsions included in the next Census. I should like t o know
what these precious Dissenters are afraid of? I dare say they know
that the poor dear Established Church, which they are always abusing,
will come out a great deal stronger than they choose that people should
know it is. They had the impudence to tell his Lordship that a good
many thoughtful and patriotic men would decline to answer the question
altogether. Thoughtful, indeed I and not know their own opinions in
religion! Every householder, it appears, is to state under a penalty the
religious profession of everyone sleeping in his house on the night of
Census Sunday. Well, and why not, I should like to know? The
Dissenting deputations say that householders, either from careless-
ness or partisanship, would give incorrect answers. I don't believe a
word of it. As if / didn't know the place of worship every one of my
lodgers goes to! There's that fat, selfish, canting creature Taixow-
bots, on the first-floor. I'm sure if I don't know that he expounds
his experiences weekly at the Particular Baptist Chape) in Little
Muggleton Street, Einsbury, I must be deaf; for isn't he always
inviting me and Mart Jane, the servant, to come there and
'partake of the privileges '—for that's what he calls listening to his
■muffling and talking through his nose for an hour and a half every
Sunday morning and evening. A mean wretch—that's always inviting
himself to take tea with me in the parlour, and doesn't dine at home
twice in a month! I should like you to see him over a plate of muffins,
and then see if you could doubt about his religious professions.
"Then there's the Mormonite journeyman cabinet-maker on the two-
pair-back. I'm sure he has preached his horrid polygamies and prophecies
and things to that poor silly Mart Jane, till 1 believe the girl's ready
to go off with him to Utica, or wherever it is, in California, where
those Mormons have set up for themselves—though she knows she's
only to be one of three wives which the wretch declares himself entitled
to! And there's the young broker's clerk in the two-pair-front, who
goes gallivanting off to Hampton Court, or Richmond, or Green-
wich, or Windsor, as regular as the Sunday comes round. As if
everybody mightn't see with half an eye that he belongs to the Esta-
blished Church. Ain't there his prayer-book, with his name in it, and
'from his affectionate mother.' Little enough he has looked into it,
Pm afraid, this many a year. And then there's the German sugar*
baker and the French confectioner's man in the attics. Of course
they 're Papists, poor benighted creatures, not that / ever heard eit her of
them say a word about religion—good, bad, or indifferent. No, no;
depend upon it, Mr. Punch, it's a very easy matter to give an account of
people's religious professions, if that was all, though it mightn't be so easy
to speak for t heir religious practice. 1 do believe with that Tallowbots
its all mouthing and muffins. But, in course, every landlady who respects
herself will feel it her duty to find out whether her lodgers go to
church or chapel, and the sort of man they sit under. You see it
makes such a difference in people. I always prefer church-folks.
They 're pleasanter in their ways, and don't look so sharp after things,
and understand that in this world it should be live and let live with all
of us. Chapel-people is generally very mean, and close, and disagree-
able, and underbred mostly, and their preachers are dreadful—especially
if you once let them set foot under your tea-table, as I know to my
cost—carneying, canting humbugs! Didn't that Tallowbots—But
I won't bemean myself to talk about the wretch. Besides, it's you
that answers for 'em: and if people is ashamed of their religions,
why they haven't to blush before the Census man.
"But what I do object to is inquiries about age. It's all very well

and perhaps belongs to. Possibly the party who used .t, will be happy
to retract the word, and say that he meant precisely the reverse—
dregs. Everybody, almost, is familiar with "Voltaire's comparison
between the British nation and the national beverage; and there is
a part of the population, which, represented in a barrel of beer, cor-
responds to the sediment. It consists not, indeed, of the men who
wear fustian, but of those who talk it and applaud it.
Aristocrats, according to Mr. Lucraft, would not dare to call
labourers hours if they were not protected by the bayonets of the
military. That is to say, they would be restrained from calling labourers
boors by the fear of consequences from which they are now protected
by bayonets. What consequences P The unpleasantness of being torn
in pieces by the working-classes? It is surely as bad to make the
working-classes out to be ruffians, childish but ferocious ruffians, as it
is to call them boors. Here, perhaps, may occur to some of our
readers the remark, that whoever may or may not be boors, a ranting
demagogue is a bore of the first magnitude; with which we will now
drop the subject of these observations.

AN ORATOR BRIGHTER THAN MR. BRIGHT.
N Thursday evening, last
week, ameeting took place at
St. Martin's Hall, convened
by some gentlemen by means
of hand-bills and placards
inviting the working classes
"to protest against the
recent parliamentary insults
to the unrepresented, and
to support the Reform Bill
as an instalment of the
. people's rights." Among
• ot her speakers, the reporter
1 of this demonstration in-
; forms us that a certain
"Mr. B. Lucraft, in second-
ing the resolution, said be had
come to that Meetiug, which par-
took of the character of an indig-
nation meeting, because ho felt
that the work ing-clusses had
been trampled upon, and that
if they submitted to the abuse
that had been showered upon
ibein by members of the Legis-
lature, they would have to sub-
mit to more. Lot the word
■ Bcum' bo their rallying word, and let them like scum, come to tho surfico, and
swim upon the top. He alluded to the speech of Su E. B. Lyttoh in which he
talked of the English labourer as a boor who could not be safely trusted with the
franchise, to which he applied very strong terms, and declared that the aristocracy
would not dare to use such language to the working-classes if they were not pro-
tected by the bayonets of the military. Mr. Lucraft'b indignation, expressed in
no very moderate language, was received with vociferous cheers."
Judicious advocates of extension of the franchise will be glad to hear
that Mr. Lucraft's audience was, though noisy, not large. The
vociferous cheers of that orator's eloquence express, no doubt, the
sentiments of a small minority of the numerous class which it is pro-
posed to intrust with the elective franchise. Those who applaud
violent nonsense, would be likely to vote for an outrageous blockhead.
The working-classes are exempt from direct taxation. They have
no political hardship to complain of, except the inability to determine1
the price of their own labour, which is not peculiar to themselves.
Their present want of a vote may be a grievance for them, and a
calamity for the nation; but for them it is merely a sentimental
grievance, although for the nation it may be a real calamity. But to
say that they, thus circumstanced, are trampled upon, is to make a
rematk which any intelligent workman would receive, not with
vociferous cheers, but with cries of " Walker!"
What did Mr. Lucraft mean by telling his hearers that abuse
had been showered upon them by members of the Legislature? The
only foundation for this inexact statement was the fact that one or
two Members of Parliament had applied contemptuous expressions
to uneducated persons. If they submitted to that abuse, said Mr.
Lucraft, they would have to submit to more. And why not? Can't
Ihey retort P Suppose noble lords and honourable gentlemen term
I hem ignorant and unthinking, cannot they return the compliment if
they please, by calling those lords and gentlemen bloated aristocrats,
and other names still stronger and more opprobrious P If anybody
were to call Mr. Lucraft himself an ass, could not Mr. Lucraft be
content to reply, "You're another"P Or would he rather demon-
strate his title to the appellation by physically resenting it, and
kiiking P
Mr. Lucraft seems very indignant at the application, by somebody
or other, of the word "scum" to the class which he sympathises with,

All England is Filibustero.
INSTRUCTION IN PARLIAMENT
At a meeting of Old Westminsters which was held the other day, to
consider the suggested removal of the school, Sir James Graham
made this somewhat startling observation:—
"There were undoubted Advantages attending the pressnt Bite, the chief of which
perhaps was the privilege, possessed by no other public school, of attending debates
in Parliament, than which nothing could be conceived more instructive."
That Westminster is a good school, and has made many a good
scholar, nobody who knows it would venture to dispute. But that its
teaching is enhanced by its propinquity to Parliament, is an assertion
which some people may see some reason to doubt. If all the speakers
in the House were as instructive as Sir James, there might certainly
be grounds for endorsing his opinion. But this, unhappily, at present
cannot be held to be the fact; and we can hardly see much good in
letting boys attend debates, unless we wish to teach their young ideas
how to spout. In one respect, however, we must own that the debates
are, in some degree, instructive; for they not merely serve to exerciso
the patience of their hearers, but give them lessons likewise in bearing
disappointment: as for instance, when they hope to hear a Gladstone
on the Beer Bill, or a Palmerston on Prize-fighting, and have instead
to listen to a Williams on Retrenchment, or a Spooner on Mayuooth.
Circumstances alter Cases.—To class Italian attempts in Sicily
with American enterprises in Nicaragua, is emphatically, in Mr. Punch's
opinion, "Walker !r'

CHAPTER XVII.—PERIOD, THE REIGNS OF HENRY THE
SECOND, RICHARD THE FIRST, AND JOHN.
epore we speak of the military
costume of this period, we
should add to our remarks
about the civil people of it,
that the Phrygian-shaped cap
was still the cqmmou head-
cover, for as it served to
keep their heads warm, com-
mon folks cared not to change
it. Some however used the
hood, or capuchon, of the
cloak, as a means whereby
to keep the East wind from
their brain-pans; a practice
which is still adopted at the
opera, by ladies who are not
aware perhaps whom they are
imitating. Whether the swells
wore caps or cowls in Hen-
Rt's reign and RicnARD's, is
a matt er which we leave those
who like it to debate; but
we find that in King John's
time they wore neither of the
two, and left their heads with
nothing but their hair to
cover them. The fact was,
that the dandies were so
"nuts" upon their "nuts,"* that they did not like to hide their fair
(or dark) proportions; and as they took great pains in doing their back
hair, curling it with crisping irons, and binding it with ribbons, after
the fashion of street acrobats, or "happy peasants" in a ballet, they
loved to let their love-locks be open to all sight.


TOtnia 0IHT8. TEMP. JOHN. rHOM THE MOST RELIABLE AUTHORITIES.
A writer who is generally right in what he Bays, observes that "beards
and moustaches were either worn or not as the fancy directed." This
assertion we confess sounds rather startling in our ears; and we
cannot help imagining the terror of our swells, whose only aim in life
appears to be to grow big " whiskaws," were they to be told that their
facial decoration must be guided as Tom Sayers and "the Fancy"
might direct.
During the reign of Henry the Second but little change took place
in the military fashions. One novelty, however, we ought perhaps to
chronicle, although the matter is of the smallest, and it is well known
that "de minimis non curat Magnus Punch." Our readers know that
Henry the Second was the first of the Plantagenets,t and that he
owed his name to wearing a broom-twig in his helmet, the broom-plant
being called by the Normans "plante de Genet." That this custom
was copied by the swell knights of his day, we could quote a volume of
black-letterpress to prove; but we content ourselves with citing the
* Slang is now so fashionable In feminine society that we hardly need apologise
for using these expressions; nor, so much as tbey have heard of prize-fighting of
late, need we fear that many ladies will not "twig" quite what we mean. But if
there be any pretty innocent who does not understand us, lot her (if she be pretty)
appoint a private meeting with us at our office, and our smallest child will quickly
crack the meaning of these "nuts" for her.
t His father, Gkoftret Martel. really was the first of them, for he first set the
fashion whence the nickname was derived But O. M. was not a king, and his son
Henry was; and so historians (who never stoop to flattering a sovereign) have
always called the son the father of the race.
remark of one old writer that "jr* knyghtes did make f broome a
mark or sygnal in a brushe."
For further illustration of the armour of this reign, we need instance
but the well-known painting by
Maclise, which represents the
marriage of Strongbow, Earl
of Pembroke, and Eva, daugh-
ter of Dermot, who was then
the King op Leinster,* This
picture we should like much
1.0 transfer to our gallery, for
it would just now vastly in-
terest us as students of cos-
tume, t Besides, the subject is
one on which our Irish friends
especially would much delight
to ponder: for it would recall
to them the time when there
were kings in Ireland, and
would pleasurably remind them
of their own royal descent.
In sooth we doubt not that
nine-tenths of them, while gaz-
ing at King Dermot, would
instantly detect their own re-
semblance to that monarch, and
would give vent to expressions
of cousinish. if not indeed of
filial regard. To an Irish
mind moreover the picture is
suggestive of other mournful
thoughts than those of family
bereavement; for it was just
after this marriage that King Henry undertook his filibustering expe-
dition, and carried out his project of annexing Ireland; when, to
jumble up the poet's words with those of the historian, the island which
is still "the brightest jewel of the sea"—that is, in other phrase, a
gem of the first water—" became an appendage to the British crown."

TOON, BY UK. PUNCH'S YOUNGEST LITTLE BOT.
MODERATION IN CRINOLINE.
A Lady who styles herself Artiste en Corsets, Fournisseur de sa
Majeste la Heine Victoria, advertises a "Jupon Medium." The thing
called "Jupon" has for a long time presented a shocking exception to
the rule which declares that there is a medium in everything. There
has, of late years, been no medium in the dimensions of that article of
female apparel, which have indeed exceeded ail bounds. Henceforth, how-
ever, a man may hope to be enabled to sit at dinner between two ladies
without being obliged to share their clothes, which now generally
spread out on each side so as to meet in front of him, and, superadded
to the garments proper to his knees, are uncomfortably warm in summer.
In wiping his mouth after eating asparagus, no gentleman in future,
thanks to the Jupon Medium, will ever, perhaps, be entrapped into the
mistake of using the flounces of one of his fair neighbours instead of
his table-napkin. If the Jupon Medium is a pattern of the golden
mean, success to it. May it be patronised by the aristocracy, and
then, like a fashionable spirit-rapper, it will be what you may call an
example of the happy medium.
Political Virtue Rewarded.

THE POTHOUSE PROTECTIONIST.
BIEND Atrton, the liberal and
enlightened Member for the
Tower Hamlets, has greatly
distinguished himself in the
House of Commons by the
persevering opposition which
he has offered to the Refresh-
ment Houses and Wine Lioences
Bill. It would be very improper
to ascribe the honourable gen-
tleman's endeavours to defeat
that wholesome measure to
personal motives. There can
be .no doubt whatever that, in
labouring for the prevention of
the sale of cheap liquor at
respectable shops, he has acted
entirely in the interest of the
Public.

A Hint to Helvetia.
Considering the part that
the " Gallant Swiss boy" plays
in the armies of Pope Pius and
Kino Bomb a lino, we should
recommend to that respectable and ancient mountain republic the
example of another aged mountaineer—Norval senior—of whom his
ton remarks—
"On the Grampian Hills
My father feeds his flocks—« humble swain.
Whose only care was to increase his store,
(Quite a la Suisse)
And keep his youthful son, myself, st
THE ROYAL ACADEMY.
"Mi dear Punch,
"In correctly classifying the great and important Snob tribe,
there is one variety of the species which should not be overlooked. I
mean the 'Plebeius Censnrius,' or Exhibition Snob.
"Walk through the Royal Academy rooms any afternoon in May,
and you shall see a score of these worthies, and learn from their own
mouths how severe, how funny, how hypercritical,—in a word, how
rude they can be. I often wonder what can be the feelings of poor
Tom Bokax and Elake White when, standing at, a modest distance
from their beloved canvas, they listen to the remarks of the passing
crowd. 'Tea-boardy,' I find, is a convenient and expressive epithet
applied by not a few of the satirical public. 'What a daub!' is another
favourite and oft-repeated ejaculation. Those who have picked up a
few conventional bits of artistic slang, deliver themselves of their
censure with vast importance. On the whole, perhaps, t he amateurs
are the most severe. Miss Chai.keh. who copies the 'etudes aux deux
crayons' so indifferently, passes cool judgment on Hunt and Millais;
and Madder Brown, who slops down on paper what he calls natural
effects, is monstrous knowing in the Landscape schooL 'That bit of
rock is not, in keeping,' says he. 'What the sky wants is tone' * So-
and.So never feels his middle distance,' &c. &c. Sometimes these
gentlemen volunteer their counsel. 'Remember, my dear Sir, if you
want to get harmony, you must fetch up your flesh, and subdue your
still life;' or, 'Take my advice, now—I like to be candid, you know—
and paint out your principal figure.'
"Confound their candour, I say. Believe me, my dear Punch, the
men who best understand Our Art say least about it.
"I remember once standing before a modern picture of acknow-
ledged merit, a picture on which a world of love, and care, and time,
and money had been spent—and while the best among us wondered
and admired, up came two grinning dandies in ma*t>«coloured gloves,
and, surveying the painting through their eye-glasses, abused it roundly.
Composition, colour, form, chiaroscuro, perspective—what not—these
gents discussed with great ease and in a tolerably high tone of voice,
and I venlv believe they were about as competent to give an opinion
on the subject, as I am to explain the Binomial Theorem.
"Fur my uwn part, being naturally of an easy disposition, and not.
given to cavil if I can avoid it, I like to stroll amiably through the
Exhibit inn rooms—just looking at what pleases me best, and so leave
all the fault-finding for (lie learned critics. Thus, for instance, wheu
Mr. Danbt tells us that—
"Phoebus Tiring from the Sea, by (he lustre <tf hit firtt vivifying rays,
through the drifting loam of a rolling wave, calls into wort fly existence
the Queen of Beauty—when Mr. D. thus euphoniously describes the
birth of Aphrodite, am I going to quarrel with him because Scun-
bleton says that Apollo was not present on the occasion? What, do
/care P If Mr. Danbt prefers this version of the Anadyomene— and
it suits his Sunrise, we will still admire his picture and leave Venus
to settle her own parentage.
"Mr. Luct has gone in for the grand historical line (which by the
way, is fast losing its old representatives). 229, J-orrf Saye and Sele
arraigned before Jack Cade and his Mob, a d. 1451.—Jack Cade,
looks what he was—a jolly cad. The door-post of the inn is chequered,
I suppose to symbolise the unhappy Earl's fate. I wonder, as his
Lordship built a paper Mill, whether he also founded the great Cir-
cumlocution Office, where modern functionaries are still taught to say
and seal.
"Mr. Dobson exhibits The Plough, a picture in which a young
gentleman is, for the first time, entrusted with that implement by a
friend who is supposed to have already attained proficiency iu its use.
Koth have just taken off their shoes and stockings for the occasion.
The moral inculcated is, that a child should be trained in the way he
should grj—but if our young friend is to follow the plough, would it
not be as well that he should look where he is going P
"Over Mr. Cooke's wonderful and interesting Arctic picture hangs
the portrait of an Arctic hero (242), Captain Sir F. M'Clintock.
The dress and background are characteristic of the icy regions which
he lately explored—and if, while there, the gallant captain was not
quite so well shaved as he is here represented, and did not, as a rule,
appear with his head uncovered in the snow,—surely a little poetical
licence may be granted to Mr. Pearce.
"247 is a full-length portrait of Maurice—not the celebrated
divine and scholar of that name—but a St. Bernard Dog, the property
of Her Majestt. See what good company a Royal Favourite may
command. An Arctic hero on one side, and a baronet on the other—
Lucky, Lucky dog!
"The Taming of the Shrew has afforded Mr. Ego a lively scene for
illustration. 'My eye—what a shindy!' remarked Dr. C—mm—no to
me as we examined the picture. Petruchio clutches the joint as though
it were his wife's jointure. Everything will be smashed or crashed,
except the doublets, which are slashed.
"Bravissinto! Mr. Goodall. A wilderness cannot be such an un-
pleasant place, after all. To watch the Sun rise on those rosy hills—to
mount that patient camel's back, rich in gorgeous trappings, and send
fort h clouds of Latakia into the morning air—some of us in merry
England are born to worse lots than that. I never saw an Arab Sheikh,
but am sure that old chief is a speaking (as well as a preaching) like-
ness. The Sheikh is admirable in himself, but the chique of the whole
picture is marvellous. *
"I don't pretend to be a good judge of babies, which to my bachelor
prejudices appear classed under two great heads: viz., brown, and
pink, with more or less propensity to squall; but I defy the most con-
firmed misnpoedist (may Lid dell, and Scott forgive me if there be no
such word) to look without interest at Mrs. Ward's First Step in
Life, at that little tiny tottering thing just learning to feel its legs. My
first impulse was to say kitsey kitsey, which I am given to understand
is the correct form for baby salutation, and I don't know how long I
might have looked at it. but for the exclamation of an enthusiastic
foung lady close behind me. 'Oh, Mamma! Look here; what a
ittle duck!' The associations connected with that expression (I
have, in all, twenty-three nephews and nieces of a tender age) were too
painful, and 1 rushed precipitately from the spot.
"Mr. Hardt's unpretending, but clever little picture, A Crash,
gives rise to much speculation among the youthful visitors at the It. A.
Who upset the table? that is the question. One might suppose it to
have been done by one of the little urchins hiding behind the door, as
if to escape from another sort of hiding at the hands of Granny, who is
coming down-stairs. But pussy is scampering off in a guilty hurry,
which looks suspicious. There has evideutly been a cat-astrophe.
"Mr. Paton gives the title of Hesperus to a painting which repre-
sents a mediaeval young lady and gentleman making love under the
influences of that planet. But for the English character of the scene
the picture might have been called Am-iugcn. The lover is kneeling
somewhat uncomfortably to be sure; but, bless my heart, I would
kneel on nutmeg-graters in such a cause.
"The tender passion again affords subject for illustration in The
Duenna's Return, by Mr. Hohslet. How lucky for that ardent youth,
who is just leaving his sweetheart, that the Duenna did not return a
minute or two ago. I fancy the old lady's crutch would have de-
scended on his head faster than he is now descending from the window.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PLUCKY YOUNG FELLOW.

Young Gentleman, who ap-
pears to have unsuccessfully
attempted to pass a Mili-
tary Examination, has writ-
ten, under the signature of
"Another Injured Can-
didate," a letter to the
Honing Pott, wherein, hav-
ing premised that he has
himself " gone through the
literary nonsense and tor
ture of a Chelsea examina-
tion," he makes the reflec-
tion subjoined:—
"It ia exceedingly hard and
unfair, when we are put to auuh
enormous expeneea in preparing
for tfaeae examinations, to find,
on presenting ourselves, that we
are expected to answer such
questions aa thoao which y.-u
have just given publicity to;
and even here it does not end,
for the English and Mathema-
tical Papers were quite aa diffl-
- cult, and much better adapted
for a Cambridge or Oxford exa-
mination than to puxsle youtha
? of seventeen or eighteen who
havo just left
Is it possible to conceive
any "English papers"
which would not probably
be too difficult for the author of the foregoing extract? His mathematical attainments may
be sufficient to carry him over the Pons Asinorvtn, but it may be doubted if his knowledge of
his native tongue is great enough to enable him to accomplish a nearly so arduous passage in
of literature. We wonder what he means by the "':
1 literary nonsense and torture
attending the ordeal to which he alludes was
the walks of literature. We wonder what he
of a Chelsea examination." The "torture" _
doubtless his own, but whose was the "literary nonsenseP" The above-quoted passage
may suggest an answer to this question. It is, no doubt, exceedingly hard and unfair
to set young men catch-questions; Dut it is unfair and hard of the examiners alone. There
is nothing hard or unfair on the part of the young men involved in finding that they are
expected to answer such questions.
If the English and Mathematical Papers, alluded to by our victim to literary nonsense and
torture were at all adapted for a Cambridge or Oxford examination, they must, one would
think, have been at least as well adapted to puzzle youths of seventeen or eighteen. The
youth who represents them as having been fitter to try competitors for degrees thau to puzzle
boys who have but just left school, can hardly, if he has been plucked for his military little
go, be considered entitled to add himself to the list of candidates who have any right to call
themselves injured. At the same time, let the authorities consider that blockheads are
often brave, and always all the braver for being blockheads; and ask themselves whether it
is wise and judicious to exclude from the British army a sort of fellows who are in every
way so remarkable for pluck. At least it may be advisable to retain some regiments of
"Heavies," for which the qualifications shall be rather muscular than mental, and shall not
include the mysteries of spelling and grammar.
NUDITY AND NONSENSE.
W« understand that Lord Haddo is about to move for leave to introduce a Bill to
prohibit the exposure of naked dolls on race-courses, as being calculated to corrupt the morals
of the people. His Lordship's late crusade against the study of the nude must, as we
mentioned it, be fresh in the remembrance of our readers; and the Bill which he proposes
now to introduce will be a further step in the same laudable direction. With that extreme
feeling of delicacy for which his Lordship is so famous. Lord Haddo will provide that the
dolls be henceforth draped; and his measure will contain the most precise directions as to
the amplitude of clothing which is to be enforced. Thus the eyes of prudish people will,
he hopes, be no more shocked by the exposure of the naked little figures which are suffered
to be thrust into our faces on the Derby Day, without a trouser or a petticoat to veil their
ligneous legs.
A Brief for the Charter.
The report of the proceedings at the Middlesex Sessions, the other day, concluded with
the following announcement:—
"Mr. Ernest Josra has joined the bar practising at this Court"
Success to Mr. Ernest Jones in his forensic capacity. Everybody will rejoice to know
that Mr. Jones is practising as an advocate at the bar, instead of advocating extreme
political doctrines with an eloquence which is calculated to procure the orator a position
in the dock. It is gratifying to consider that declamation in Jones has become pleading
in Ernest.
Protectionist Hosts.—Protection was supposed to have been dead and buried; but
Free Trade in liquor is still vehemently opposed by the great body of the Landlords who
keep public-houses and their Representatives in the House of Commons.
THE SORROWS OF "THE STAR."
In vain I spend my eloquence,
My arguments let fly,
To teach the people how to be
Dissatisfied, and why.
I poke the British Lion up—
In his dull ear I scream;
I stir the fire, I blow the coals,
But can't get up the steam!
There's flogging in the Army;
There's jobbing in the Fleet;
Corruption in the Treasury;
Intrigue in Downing Street!
That horrid Volunteering—
For sarcasm what a theme!
But vain my skill, do what I will.
I can't get up the steam!
Vain, morning after morning,
My preaching up Reform;
The more I beat the iron
The more it won't get warm:
On indirect Taxation
My attacks would fill a ream,
Yet none will buy or back my cry,—
I can't get up the steam!
At all the age's vices
I've gone in left and right;
I've written down Tom Sayers—
I've written up John Bright;
'Gainst cakes and ale in general
I've turned my vitriol stream j
But cakes and ale do still prevail;
I can't get up the steam!
It's awful to contemplate
A nation like our own,
Going headlong to perdition
(As the Star has often shown).
They tread the flowery pathway,
Wrapped in their fatal dream,
And turn deaf ears to all my fears,—
-1 can't get up the steam!
When, our Commons' rights invading,
The Peers' presumptuous vote
Keeps up the excise on paper,
In vain I swell my throat,—
Vain an "out raged constitution"
And a " down-trod people" seem,
E'en a " bloated aristocracy"
Will not get up the steam!
In short, the country's apathy
To limes, Peers, Church, and Crown;
Must sicken one who fain would see
All things turned upside down;
Who'd make the Star its country's guide,
For the Times' delusive beam—
But the more I preach the fewer I reach—
And I can't get up the steam!
Oh, what this England yet might be,
If Bright were at the helm,
With a graduated Iucome-Tax
All taxes to o'erwhelm—
And Universal Suffrage—
But hence too pleasing dream,
For that, bright page—that Golden Age—
I can't gel up the steam!
Old Fort and Old Fogies.
The cause of greyness in the hair, in many
instances, may be traced to a too copious in-
dulgence in port wine. When we consider t he
composition of the mixture ordinarily sold
under that name, we may easily understand
how the practice of imbibing it is calculated to
give one who is not old the appearance of an
elder\j gentleman.

under the lining of his hat, he could find only 14 proxies; so that the
Paper Bill was floored by 193 to 104; majority 89. Mr. Punch was
therefore about right when he advised bis friend Gladstone to look
out for squalls!
Down-stairs the very important Bankruptcy Bill went through Com-
mittee. Mr. Bouverie tried to cut down the proposed salaries of the
District Judges from £1800 to £1500; but the House knows that
cheap judges make dear law, and ought to have rejected the proposal
by a larger majority than one (69 to 68), though a Miss is as good as a
mile, especially if you measure round her crinoline.
Tuesday. The Lords had a discussion about the riots in St. George's-
in-the-Hast, and stress was laid upon the remarkable forbearance
shown by the police to the rioters, Lord Wicklow observing, that if
the authorities were in earnest in desiring to suppress the ruffianism,
it could easily be abated. Mr. Punch, utterly as he despises and
detests priestcraft (having himself done more to put down Puseyism
than the whole of the episcopal bench together), does not think that
a mob ought to be recoguised as Convocation. The Bishop of Lon-
don continues to maintain that he could set matters straight, if parties
would submit to his absolute jurisdiction. His Lordship should go
down some Sunday with the honourable and medical Member lor
Leitrim, and see what they could do—if Brady and Tate will not lull
a congregation, what will}
Lord Palmerston had, of course, to do something in reference to
last night's vote in the Lords. So he gave notice that he should on
Thursday ask for a Committee, who were to look into the Lords'
Journals, and discover what I he Peers had been doing on Monday;
after which he should ask for another Committee to look into the
Hittory of England, and discover what the Peers had ever done about
the Paper Duty. He then suggested that meantime—
"They should at once throw every care away,
In the enjoyment of the Derby Day."
A few Members, who had perhaps drawn bad horses in the sweeps
at their Clubs, were sulky, and wanted something done at once, hut
were cut very short by the Premier and Sir George Lewis. The
House was in no humour to be bothered with business within eighteen
hours of the bell ringing to clear the course, and was counted out
about half-past seven, while a Member was moving for a Committee on
such a trumpery matter as the ruin of our Gun-Boat Fleet.

Mr. Punch, as usual (sec another column in his present number), having
prophesied the winner, though the press of matter last week prevented
his inserting that prediction. The prize, snd some trifle of £70,000 or
30, fell to Ma. Merry, M.P. for the Falkirk Burghs; a Scottish party
of such incalculable wealth that all the coal-scuttles in his house are
filled with sovereigns, and any tradesman daring to offer chanire to a
servant is at once discharged. The Americans are savage with Umpire's
trainer, of course, as if that free and republican horse had been pro-
perly treated he must have beaten to fits all the produce of the
wretched, worn-out, effete, aristocratic stables of the old country.

Lunch was carried on upon the most amicable terms, and witticisms
were freely exchanged from the carriages. A pie, from which some-
body else had extracted the meat, being handed to Baron Roths-

Because it's got no inside." Viscount Williams tried to reply with
an epigram about a Stake in the Country, but was put down by
clamour. Mr. Bright was asked if he did not think Sution a fine
animal, and he replied, "Suttonly." Sir Joseph Hawlet was
peatly chuffed about Largesse, and was wittily advised to call him
"Small S" in future. Nobody knew why the Baron's horse was

Sir Richard Bethell being asked, what were the chances of High

lu fact wit. flew about with every champagne cork, and nobody was
unhappy except Lord Haddo, whose sense of propriety was shocked
every quarter of a iuinute by the sight of the penny dolls, whose
Undraped figures were, in every hat. He stood up on the hill, snd
gave uniice that he should move that at the next Derby all the dulls
should be dressed, at the expense of the country; but his papa, Lokd

fule's tongue and just tak' his liquor like a gentleman, he'd get him

Viscount Williams declared, that there had never been such a
glorious Derby Day for eighty years, and everybody was much too
jolly to dispute the fact or ask how the Viscount knew.
Thursday. There was the usual reaction after a day entirely devoted
to fresh air, a hot sun, champagne, cigars, and chaff; but the Bishops
felt it was rather the thing to show that they were all right, so they
discussed in Committee the Bill for pulling down useless churches and
putting them up somewhere else. In the Commons, Lord Palmer-
ston appointed the first of his Committees, and made the House laugh
by going away, pretending to discover the Paper Bill entry in the
Lords' journal, and then bringing it up, and giving notice for his other
Committee.
Sometimes, after a day's pleasure, people get cross and even spiteful.
To-night there was an example of this; the Opposition making a
malevolent attempt to withhold some money, really wanted by the
Executive, unless the discussion of the items for which it was required
were fixed for the time set apart for the Reform Bill Debate. How-
ever, after a good deal of snapping and snarling, the attempt was
defeated by 135 to 107. It was also settled that the people who make
for sale the messes called British wines, and people who sell more than
two gallons thereof, should be obliged to take out licences at five
guineas. Sir John Barnard's Anti-Stock Exchange Gambling Aot,
after 150 years of life, was sentenced to death.
Friday. Their Lordships sat down, but got up very soon, Agreed to
meet next on the fourth day of June.
The Queen has permitted Convocation to consider the Canon which
forbids a parent from being godfather to his own child. It is true that
few priests except Tractanan prigs, proud of a little authority, take
uotice of the antiquated rule; but it stands on the books, and it is
awkward for a christening party to be sent back because a foolish
clergyman declines to entrust a solemn duty to the only person in the
world who is likely to discharge it efficiently.
Lord Palmerston appointed his Second Committee, but not until
after a long debate as to the Crisis, and the relative position of the
Lords and Commons on the Paper Duty Question. Tom Duncombe
wanted to circumvent the Lords, and insist that they had passed the
Bill for "that day six months" (you were told to mind the vote) but
that proposal was thought rather skittish. Mr. Bright, of course,
was for vigorous action against the Lords. Lord John Russell was
all for solemnity and precedent, and finally the Government, supported
by the Opposition, had its own way.
Now, you see, there can be no doubt that the House of Commons is
most eager to put down Bribery. Nothing can be more noble and
virtuous than the speeches which are made against it. Nay, a law,
which is to a certain extent efficacious, has been made on the subject.
And Mr. Punch hopes, that the people of England will not be induced
to doubt the sincerity of the House from the incidents of to-night.
Certain Gentlemen, mind, not publicans, or snobs, or any of the people
who ought to be ashamed of themselves, have been shown to be so
guilty of corruption, that the Attorney-General, as bound by
law, has decided that they be indicted. Mr. Charlesworth and
Mr, Leatham are the parties. It is true, to-night, Members on all
sides begged the Attorney-General not to persevere in this cruel
course; that men of all parties, themselves above all suspicion, urged
that it was persecution; that Sir Richard himself was moved, and only
wished he could be released from such a duty; that Mr. Bright
pleaded in behalf of his relative, Mr. Leatham, and that the House
generally felt that it was not the thing to go to extremities with
Gentlemen. Still the country must not, we repeat, suppose that the
House is not in earnest, and Mr. Punch begs that judgment may be
suspended. Only let some nasty low fellow, wno goes about corrupting
voters, get into the law's clutches, and see how much he will be helped
out of the scrape. If a gentleman appears to err, it is but due to him
to suppose, that being an educated man, and aware of what he is
doing, he has his own reasons.
"Gmsab doth never wrong, but with just cause."
Another display of hatred to Garibaldi and Italian freedom was made
by some of the Papists in the House, but Mr. Patrick O'Brien, to
his honour, declared, that though a Cat holio, he could not restrain his
abhorrence of the barbarity of the Neapolitan authorities. Mr. Hen-
nessy gave a splendid proof of what a priest's tool is permitted to say
in majorem Dei gloriam. He declared, in his place, that one of the
Neapolitan victims, the Baron Poerio, "never had chains on him
at all."
"Mr. Gladstone. Oh! oh! Why, 1 saw them myself."
Loud cheering followed, and testified to the iusliucts of English-
men. But there is something louder just now speaking to the
Neapolitan miscreants, and that is the roar of Garibaldi's cannon.
May it be kept up till King and Priest are swept out of the Two
Sicilies.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HOW TO 'SPIKE THE ENGLISH."
everely faithful to
our promise (for pray
when has Punch been
known to disappoint
his readers?) we
resume now our re-
view of the Guide of
the Orpheonistes* and
shall show that its
directions towards
the speaking of our
language are quite as
much to be relied on
as its guidance to our
streets. The best of
it is, too, that the
Guide is so composed
as to require the least
possible study and
attention, and to be
almost automatonic
in imparting the in-
struction wherewith
its pages teem. This
excelling feature re-
ceives the special
mention that it merits
in the Preface, which,
as we have said, is
Eeculiarly French in
otb its modesty and
truth:—
"II est probable que
lea Orpheonistea, occupea
en ce moment, et jus-
qu'au jour du depart,
pnr les etudes musicalea
que va domander le Fes-
tival de Londrea [i e.
their Tbrec Concerts at the Crystal Palacel auront peu de temps a con*acrer a eelle de ce petit livre. Mais
B'ila ne pcuvent pas donncr a la prononciation dee mots et dea phraaea qu'il coutiont une attention et un
u mps sufhaants, il n'on sera paa moina pour eux d'une ties grande utility. Toutes les foia, en effet, qu'un
Orpbeoniste, possesBeur de cette brochure, aura une question a addresser a un Anglais, il n'aura qu'a la
cbercher dans le Manuel de Con vernation. Puia il l'indiquera du dolfft a son interlocuteur dans la culouno
anglaiae. La roponse lui sera faito naturellement, par le memo procede, a 1'aide de la colonne francaiso."
This, it may be thought, is a rather bold assertion: for even granting it were possible to
cram into^a Manual all the questions that a foreigner might ever want or wish to put, one does
not see quite clearly how the answers could be given, and be made both comprehensible and
strictly to the truth. Suppose the question to be given "Bote are you off for Soap!"' (a
query quite as serviceable as nine-tenths of tbe questions that most manuals contain,) how
could all the possible responses be supplied, and what a picture of bepuzzlement the querist
would present were he bidden in reply to "Ask my shaving•-dish.'"
Before, however, we proceed to take the Manual in hand, we must notice some few of the
rules for speaking English, which are furnished "specialement" for the guidance of OrpbtS-
onistes. To begin at the beginning, by way of overture, the writer teaches them our alphabet,
and thus commences telling them how we pronounce our letters:—
"A. Va bo prononee comma en francais devant toutes lea consonnea doubles. Exemple: All, abbey,
attendant; prononcea oil, abbe", alt ... .*
The truth that we give "a" the French pronunciation "ah" when it precedes a double
consonant, is one that possibly our West End readers may admit, but ordinary Englishmen
will feel a little startled at it. The same distinction, too, may be predicted as to—
"0. L'o a generalement le son denotreo. Cependant il a quelquefola celui de Va. Exemple: However;
prononcez ha."
"Hah-ever" is a word which we in vulgar Fleet Street seldom have the treat of hearing,
for the ultra Swells who use it, rarely trust their precious "peg-tops" to the East of Temple
Bar. The loungers in Hyde Park hah-ever" are more fortunate, and in the season, the
plebeian who ventures near "Pahl Mahl" or "Wegent Stweet" may likewise be refreshed
by hearing some one say "hah-ever."
Thus far into the vowels of our language having marched on without impediment, the
Orpbeoniste is next guided by the Guide among our consonants, and, that he may learn to
pronounce them with propriety, the following are samples of the rules to be observed:—
11 Le b, le c. le p, et le t, plsces devant une i, ont une prononciation touto partlcnliere. Elle conaiate ■

la langue entre lea denta, et de preaaer legerement avec les inciaivea superieurea et infe'rioures. En proaaant
trop fort, on arriverait a un son trop dur; en ne preaaant paa'aaaez, le aon aortirait sons la forme d'une «. II

Le double v ou v a une prononciation aasez connue; elie reaaemble au hurlement du loup: uou I uou 1 (11)"
Thus directed how to give a proper accent to our alphabet, the Orpbeoniste is next
guided through the mazes of our grammar, in a way that for its novelty and boldness of
* "Vocabulaire et Guide des Orpheonistea Francais a Londres. Tar A. R. B. Paris, 1860."
conception throws old Lindley Murray com-
pletely in the shade. Without wearying the
student by taking him a steady walk through
all our rules, and explaining in rotation their
various exceptions, the Guide hops and skips
about among our "parties du discours," scatter-
ing at each jump its pearls of information, as
profusely as the fairy girl let fall her precious
words, which as they dropped from her were
turned to precious stones. Some faint notion
may be formed of the value of these jewels, if
we find space in our columns to exhibit this one
specimen:—
11 La trnisieme personne him s'emploie lorsqu'elle se
rapporte a un substantif maaculin. Exemple : Je regardo
cet homme, je le trouvo grand. I look that man. I find
Aim tall. Him ae rapporte a man, Bubstantif masculin."
Jumbled with these pearls of grammatical
instruction, are rules as to pronunciation which
are of equally great price. Here for instance
are three pronouns, which are declined and
spelt for French pronunciation, thus:—
On.
Geuitif. Ouze.
Datif. Tou oum.
Accusatif. Oum.
Ablatit Ov oum. (I)"
This suppression of the aspirate in "be" and
"his" and "who." might fairly lead one to ima-
gine that the author of the Guide was in reality
a Cockney; a supposition which is further
strengthened by our finding that the word
"house" is directed to be spoken "aousse,"
while in answer to the question "Iz masteur
[English for Monsieur] B. et aume?" there is
given the reply that "I [he] az djeust gonn
aout." A smack of German flavour also is
imparted to our language by directing the word
"second" to be roughened into "segunnd;"
and surely no one but a Russian learning English
of Lord Mai.mesbury, could have written
"tcheurtch" for "church," and "tchesheur
tchize " for "Cheshire cheese."
We cull these flowers of speech from a part of
the Guide written for pupils most advanced, and
called a "Petit manuel Anglais de conversation
usuelle." This extremely useful chapter is
perhaps the most facetious portion of the work:
but as we must not give our readers too much of
a good thing, we shall reserve a fuller notice of
it for another occasion.

"I Say, Punch, old boy. wish you'd drop a line to our friend Sir
Rowland Hill, and ask him if it be true that it's no use putting
district initials on one's letters, because the sorting clerks, it seems,
don't pay the least attention to them. This assertion has been made
in large print in the Timet, but no official notice has as yet been taken
of it: and the other day that journal allowed a correspondent to put
point blank the question which I have asked above, and even this has
failed to elicit a reply. So you see one is compelled to call in your
assistance, for the authorities appear to be as deaf quite as the post,
and till you rap them on the knuckles they will pay no heed to one.

statement:

The Royal Institution will do well to send out for some bottles of the

ingenioixs artist an order.

"This letter, Sir, arrived during my absence on the Derby Day,
when I was called into the country upon most important business.
It is dirt-c.eil to me plain enough, as anyone may see—at least, anyoue
who is acquainted with my excellent friend Jollybot, and has li-arnt
how to decipher his splodgy, sprawling scrawl. Now, Sir, I ask you
as a gentleman, does this letter look as if it were intended for a lad.v?
Yet, Sir, it has been opened by a person (to speak plainly) who calls
hertelf a lad v, and more than this, it has been read. Sir, actually read,
from the 'Dear Jack' to the 'Jollybot,' before the wretched
woman, as she pretends to tell me, discovered what she milt persist ia
calling her 'mistake!' Sir, I blush for a rela but no, I won't
say a relation; rather let me call her a conned ion by marriage,
on my wife's side. Her 'mistake,' she says, arose from her m s-
taking the S. W.. the letters of our district, as intended to initialise
her own name—Sahah Wells. She says, she therefore fell, quite
justified in opening the letter; but though she vows she shut it up
again the very instant her eye 'lighted on the first, two words—Dear
Fhank '—I have sufficient grounds for saying that I don't a bit believe
her. The letter bore allusion to a supper at Creinorue, which Jolly
BOY fwho is a bachelor) alleged as an excuse for not coming to dine
with me; and as I chanced that evening to be kept, late at my office, my
wife unnaturally accused me of having supped with Jollyboy, a suspicion
which was obviously suggested by 'S. W.'—I mean by Sakaii W ells.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Critical position of Smudgby't rich Uncle, who incautioutly entered his Nephew's Studio at he was mating Studies for hit " Balaclava Change.''
A GOOD SCHOOL FOR BAD TEMPERS.
Why is Mr. Raret like the hero Hector? is a question which
the student of Homer may reply to, but which to other minds may
cause some shadow of perplexity. The answer is, that Hector was a
horse-tamer, and so is Mr. Itakkt: and were the praises of the latter
to be sung in Greek hexameters, he would be quite as much entitled
to the word "hippodamoio," which is so frequently applied by the
poet to the hero, perhaps because it makes so good an ending to the
fine.
To show our scholarly attainments, we may put the further query:
Why is Mr. Rahet not like Ricbard Cosur dk Lion f The reply is,
that the Saracens, when their horses shied or started, used to ask them
if they saw King Richard in the path; implying thereby that the
King was a cause for apprehension, and that horses might be reason-
ably supposed to be afraid of him. Now this is a conjecture which
clearly could not truthfully be held of Mr. Raret. If the horse be
the intelligent creature he is thought to be, he can hardly be suspected
of fearing his new trainer: whose "system" is to substitute horse-
laming for horse-breaking, and to educate his pupils by kindness, not
by kicks. Would jou train the tender creature, kindly, gently, mildly
treat it: and never frighten it, or fret it by rough handling or ill use.
This is the advice which Mr. Raret gives us, and if equine lips could
speak, they certainly should thank him for it. Whips and spurs would
soon be obsolete, were what he says attended to, and be classed with
racks and thumbscrews, and other bygone tortures.
Mr. Rarkt's course of treatment is in fact directed not less to the
groom than to the horse; the former being in intelligence the inferior
animal, and in very many instances by far the greater brute. What
Mr. Karet aims at teaching is, that horses have quick instincts and
highly nervous temperaments; and if we would train them to be
tractable and docile, we must train ourselves to treat them with
suitable respect.
Rightly to command them, we must command ourselves; for if we
lose our temper we but teach them to lose theirs. Our chief intent
should be to keep on terms of friendship with them, and get them to
obey us from fondness, not from fear.
Mr. Raret's system therefore is improving to the man as well as
to the beast, and many a human "savage" might be permanently
bettered by it. Persons of bad temper should present themselves as
subjects, and be operated upon until their tempers grow more tract-
able, and can more easily be checked. Were a school for man- and
woman-taming now to be established, it might really be productive of
great national advantage, and Mr. Raret certainly would do the State
some service if he would, at starting, consent to take the reins.
An XXXellent Choice.

To win immortal glory,

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Mat 31. Thuriday. Whitsuntide Holidays over, the Lower Class
Form returned to resume its studies at Westminster School, but the
Upper Class Form had an extension of leave until the following
Monday.
In Committee of Supply on the Army Estimates, General Peel
complained that we have not soldiers enough. He paid a very high
compliment to the Volunteers, who would, he believed, be a patriotic
and invaluable force, but they must be used as Auxiliaries only.
Hereupon Mr. Punch heartily concurs with the Ex-War-Minister, the
material of which the Household Guard is composed being much too
valuable to be used in any sort of fighting except pro aris et foeis: or,
as the Wiscount translates it, for our own areas and our own folks.
After some words from Deedes in favour of the Yeomanry, who have
always done what Hamlet calls "Yeoman's service," and ought not to
be neglected, an Irish party named Conolly attacked Mr. Sidney
Herbert, and called him a Monster Poacher, justifying that pleasing
epithet by alleging that as Secretary for War he interfered with certain
Irish fisheries, by hu>ing land for the public and building defences
thereon. The Monster, in reply, said that the public paid—and very
highly—for any land that was required by the Executive, and ought to
have the same rights over their purchased property as any other buyer.
The Committee thought Mr. Conolly's case a fishy one, and that
Mars had a perfect right to enter Pisces, without leave from Taurus,
the Irish Bull.
Then did Db Lact Evans take to task the Monster for having
recently conferred the Colonelcy of a Regiment upon General Grey.
This lucky officer is the Private Secretary to Field- Marshal the
Prince Consort, and it is universally admitted that he serves his gal-
lant Commander in the most, unimpeachable way. Gret writes a toler-
able hand, with facility, aud with the aid of a little Diamond Dictionary
of the English Language, presented to him by Princess Alice on one
New Year's Day, as a small token of respect and esteem, be manages
to avoid any very flagrant errors in spelling. He folds a note with
neatness, always minds that there is adhesive stuff on the flap of the
envelope, or if there is none, he secures it with gum of his own dis-
solving, and he is singularly careful in putting the proper Post Office
initial in the right hand lower corner of the direction. He has always
postage stamps in his desk, or in a very pretty little silver-gilt fusee-
Box, presented to him by Princess Beatrice on his wedding-day, as
a small token of respect and esteem. And he is very particular in
posting the letters, and when at Buckingham Palace often runs over
with them himself to the pillar-box near the Duchy of Cornwall office,
for as he justly remarks, servants are so careless about letters. The
early copy of Punch, which is regularly sent to the Palace on Tuesday
morning, he always Bews, and cuts it very nicely with a pretty ivory
paper-knife, which was presented to him by the three Princesses on
his birthday, as a small token of respect and esteem, and which has the
names Alice, Louisa, and Beatrice, engraved on the handle. The
Field-Marshal, if parting with him at any time, would, Mr. Punch
happens to know, kindly give Ghey this character, and would add a
testimonial to his industry, his intelligence, and (although he is brother
to Earl Grey) his civility. Well, it may be supposed that, the Duke
of Cambhidgb, in bis frequent visits to his Royal Cousin, must have
noticed Grey, and very likely may have said to the Prince that he
seemed to have got. a very decent kind of fellow there, and Sidney.
Herbert, who, as War-Minister, must often have had to ask advice
from H.R. H. the Field-Marshal, may also have formed a favourable idea
of the Secretary. Now it so happens that in early life Grey went into
the Army, and having stopped in it ever since has gradually attained to
the rank of General. We need hardly say that he never did anything
particular, though he happens to have been in Canada when other
people were doing a good deal, and though he is said to have seen ser-
vice, the Service he has seen most of is the second best China service
which Her Majesty has out on days when there is no particular
company to dinner. However, Cambridge and Herbert having the
Colonelcy of a Regiment to give away the other day, good-naturedly,
but really very improperly, gave it to Grey, whereas such a reward
should have been conferred on a soldier! There was a jolly row about
the affair to-night, and the Monster was taunted with passing over old
vol. xxxvm.

officers, who were covered with wounds and glory, and giving such a
good thing to a private secretary. The Monster made the best, case he
could, and magnified Grey's merits with that, patent oxy-hydrogen
microscope called Puffing; but perhaps Mr. Disraeli (who is uncom-
monly civil to the Court just now) volunteered the most plausible
excuse for the act, saying that as Princes always keep military
attendants, it was better that they should be men of a good sort, and
nut parasites, and that, if jou excluded soldier-courtiers from military
rewards, you would have a shy lot about your .Royalties. It was
neat, hut flimsy: are there no other rewards for secretaries, without
despoiling valiant old bricks, like General Bell, for instance?
Havelock writes, that he in his time had iwo sols and three fools
put, over his head; and the sjstem of being unjust to real soldiers is
not the way to make Havelocks. Mr. Punch has nothing to say
against Grey, and, indeed, likes him, and always gives him a cigar
out of Mr. P.'t own case when they stroll with the F. M. on Windsor
Slopes, but would like to see him rewarded in a becoming manner.
Captain Pen must not wrong Captain Sword.
Military matters occupied the greater part of the two nights the
Bouse sat this week. Of course the Government got all the men and
money they asked for, and might have had more, which fact will be
recollected by Mr. Punch and olhers, if at any time it should appear
that England is insufficiently protected.
Friday. Lord Fermoy demanded of Mr. Gladstone whether, as
the Lords insist on keeping on the Paper-Tax, he will remit any other.
Mr. A. Sieuart invited him to repeal the duty on tea and sugar. The
Chancellor op the X. declined to say that he had any feelings or
any intentions on any subject, until the report, of the Committee that
is Searching, should be presented. Mr. Bright of course abused the
Lords, and will labour with all his might to work the Common* Bull-
dog up into a rage, and make him fly at the Lordly Mastiff. At
present, the former seems in no humour to be set on his aristocratic
friend by his revolutionary Friend.
Lord John Russell had a heap of questions to answer, the most
interesting one being upon the suhject of the atropines of the Nea-
politan police in Sicily. The Foreign Minister of England stated t hat
our Consuls had reported to his office that the most diabolical cruelties
were practised upon the unfortunate Sicilians by the agents of the
Anointed, who is just, now showing his ample right to his name of
Bohba by keeping land and sea batteries in play, not upon his armed
enemies, but upon the unfortunate women and children of Palermo,
into which Mr. Punch is happy to state, Garibaldi has dashed at the
head of his volunteers. Bomba's Palace is now ashes—the best apology
for that act of destruction would be the excuse of the chieftain of old
time, who deeply regretted having burned down an Abbey, and would
certainly not nave dune so but for an idea that the Archbishop was
inside it.
Sir George Lewis was questioned upon the subject of the new
Strike into which Messrs, Potter and Company seem about to lure the
husbands and fathers engaged on our Metropolitan improvements ; but
the Home Secretary, while condemning Strikes as blunders that lead
to miseries, could only express his regret and announce his neutrality.
RUMOURED SACRILEGIOUS PROJECT.
E hear.with horror, indignation,
rage, and fury, that it is in-
tended to transfer the annual
festival of the Charity Chil-
dren of London this year
from St. Paul's to the Crystal
Palace. We do hope that
there is some mistake in the
information which we have
received to that effect. The
yearly chorus of the little
girls and hoys under the great
dome of St. Paul's is an in-
stitution of the country, as
well as one of the finest of
t he established phenomena of
London. We are old enough
to rememher the Coronation
of Her Majesty, aud we
feel now what, we should have
felt then if the Crystal
Palace had been in existence,
and a set of insensate in-
novators had proposed to
shunt the Royal solemnity
to that place of amusement
from Westminster Abbey.
Transfer the children's fes-
tival to the Crystal Palaoe!
Remove the Lord Mayor's
bhow to Astley's. Banish
the Rotten Row cavalcade
to Victoria Park. Have the Derby run onWormholt Scrubbs. Let the House of Lords
adjourn to t he Coal-Hole!
Who could have the heart, that is the want of heart, to think of destroying a tradition
so venerable P We should say that John Bright was at the bottom of the subversive
proposal, had we not reason to believe that John has music in his soul, notwithstanding
that, he sometimes talks like one that has none. Such an one was the author of the abomi-
nable scheme on which we are now invoking public execration; and we should like to
punish him and all his abettors by compelling him to hear Handel's Hallelujah Chorut
executed on the grandest scale in St. Paul's Cathedral every day for six mouths. The Crystal
Palace is a very proper place to take the children to for a holiday. By all means let them be
taken thither after Church, for a treat, which, by considerable amendment in the victualling
department, they may have there. Or give them two festivals, and let them repeat at. the
P..l*ce what they sang in the Cathedral. But spoil not a spectacle and a concert, which,
even to the veriest Cockneys, imparls a delight which they seem to share in fellowship with
angels. The minimi assembly and si ng of the innocents in St. Paul's was a fact that we
learned together with the fiction that London was paved with gold. Anoiher place, is paved
with i he best iiii mi ions of the dolls who design to remove that hallowed celebration to
the Crystal Palace.

Moral on a Recent Revelation.—Priers never see any good of themselves.
THAT 'ERE 'OSS.
A Dialogue I lately heard,
Beneath a sheltering shed,
Between two cads, as they conferred
About a quadruped.
The thread thereof was hard to find,
But that is little loss;
Each speech of either stable mind
Wound up with "That 'ere 'oss."
"Bill says to me, he says, says he,
('Twas thus the parley ran:)
So there, he says, was J i m and me,
And that 'ere other man.
The 'tother party named ten pound:
You never come across
A cove more dowdier, 1 '11 be bound.
But you knows that 'ere 'oss."
"Well, now if you '11 believe my word,
Aud which I need not say,
I met them parties, with a third,
Up yonder 'tother day:
What, is't to be, says they; a pot?
W hich we perposed to toss;
Now mind, says 1, 1 tell you what,
Look arter that 'ere 'oss!"
"I don't believe it, wur a sprain;
'Tis all that, party's stuff:
And if the owner hogs his mane,
He '11 be a precious muff;
His knees is very near got well;
His coat's all over gloss:
Nobody couldn't nothink tell,
To look at that 'ere 'oss."
"Of course we knows there's some as shies;
And likewise them as jibs
But wot's the use o' telliu lies?
You only feel his ribs!
No eyes can't see like them that's blind;
The young 'un's green as moss;
But Bill, for all his charf, you 'iI find,
He's sweet on that 'ere 'oss."
Thus they pursued their mutual ch.it
Most likely halt the day;
But. 1 had heard enough of that,
Aud so I went away.
How oft you hear such fellows hold
Such converse, chiefly dross,
Containing not one point of gold;
But full of "That 'ere 'oss."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH A SPIRIT-RAPPER.
Mr. Punch bests to announce
that he has been converted
to the Spirit Rapping Per-
suasion. And when He goes
in for a faith he goes the
entire believer, and not like
one of your half- hearted
Spiritualists, who very much
want to deceive themselves,
but are painfully conscious
that the experiments they
have witnessed are not only
not supernatural processes,
but are; exceedingly clumsy
juggling. He has given him-
self up entirely to Spirit
Rappery, and from the mo-
ment of his conversion set to
work calling up no end of
ghosts, until his indignant
neighbours sent in to kuow
whether he was holding a
meeting of the aggrieved
Metropolitan Postmen. And
he has been converted, totally and entirely, all for the small charge of
Sixpence. The Spiritual Magazine has done it all, and as that work
states that people are "bound to testify" what they think on the sub-
ject of Rappery, here goes for the particulars of Mr. Punch's apostacy
fiom common sense.
He published, the other day, and during his unconverted condition,
a picture illustrating the story of the Spirit Hand which was stated to
have appeared to the Emperor Louis Napoleon. In that pict ure—
alas, that he should have tried to make tun of a miracle—the Hand
was assisting the Imperial Nose to form that derisive combination
of the n»sal and the digital organizations which is vulgarly called
Taking a Sight. He did not know at that time how sensitive are the
Rappists to anything like ridicule, and that though they have no objec-
tion to be called blasphemous, or audacious, or wicked, they cannot
bear to be laughed at. Ridicule has been called the test of truth, but
it is a test which Rappery declines to undergo. Mr. Punch deeply
deplores that an unguarded sketch should have done so much mischief.
Now that he is himself a Medium, with lots of spirits waiting on every
landing in his house, and plenty more in the back garden, he compre-
hends that laughing at a ghost, is excessively improper. The Spiritual
Magazine has awakened hiui to a sense of better things.
That remarkable work has devoted its first article for the present
month—about seven pages—to remonstrances with Mr. Punch upon
the picture which has been mentioned, and upon his habi'ual incre-
dulity upon the subject of Spiritualism. The writer of the article
resolved to bring Mr. Punch over to the faith, and effected it as follows.
It happened that a gentleman, a relative of a member of t he firm from
whose establishment issues the sheet which embodies the spirit of
Punch, was lately invited to dine with another gentleman who lives in
Russell Square. Others were present, and after dinner certain things
alleged by the executant to be spiritual manifestations, took place.
Subsequently, Mr. Punch's picture of Taking a Spiritual Sight
appeared.
In the article in the Spiritual Magazine, the name of the gentleman
above alluded to as an invited guest, is mentioned, and in connection
with his visit reference is made to the picture in Punch. Here, of course,
comes in the miracle.
It is hardly necessary to say, that no gentleman could possibly so far
forget the usages of his order, the rights of hospitality, or the decencies
of life, as to make public use of any incidents of a private dinner-party.
It is perfectly certain that the gentleman above alluded to as connected
with Mr. Punch's publishers has not the remotest connection with the
production of Mr. Punch's paper, and equally certain that he never held
the slightest communication with the contributors to that publication
upon the subject of the performances in Russell Square. And it must
be equally clear that no ot her person who was present upon the occasion
in question could have been guilty of such an outrage upon the propriet ies
of life as to furnish to the editor of the Spiritual Magazine any particulars
of what took place in the privacy of a gentleman's chamber.
Therefore, by an exhaustive process, Mr. Punch has been brought to
the belief that, inasmuch as the editor of the Spiritual Magazine could
not have obtained his information from a Gentleman, he must have had
it from a Ghost. Now, one miracle is as convincing as a thousand, and
Mr Punch, completely converted, throws up bis best cocked hat for
Spiritualism, and goes in for ghosts. He believes everything now,
believes all that is in the Spiritual Magazine, believes that, as stated in
the number before him (p. 243):—
"A hand did appear before the Empebor, the Empress, the Duchess ot Mokte-
bkllo, and Mb. Hons, and did take up a pen and write the word Napoleon
and is firmly persuaded, as also stated in the article (same page), that—
'Autographs and other writings were obtained through the mediumship of the
Barok Qoldexstubbe, consisting of a aeries of the names of kings, queens, and
princes of the royal houses of France, and other eminent persons. These vert ob-
tained bjf placing blank piece* of paper on their tombe or etatvM."
Nay, he is ready to swear with a correspondent of the Spiritual Maga-
zine (p. 286) that—
"'A large band grasped his little boy round the thigh,' and that 'another spirit
pinched the toe of a friend/ and that another cooiplalued of his, the correspondent's,
keeping a skull that had belonged to the spirit when on earth,"
and is ready to fight anybody (barring Tom Sat eks and J. C. Heenan)
for the truth of the statement (p. 2S8) that,—
"Mr. Colchester, who had been communicating with a niece of his in the spirit
world, spoke of a peculiar sensation of the skin of his i-hest, when on opening his
shirt bosom, the word 8arah, the niece's name, was found uiion the Bkin in raised
letters, and occupied nine inches of space from right to lert across the chest"
Hooray for the Ghosts! Mr. Punch means to have them for contri-
butors to his paper, aud in short, as aforesaid, to give himself up
entirely to Spirit Rapping. He has set several young Ghosts upou cuts
for his next. Number, and has in type a most capital paper from a Fat
Spectre. More anon. Nor is he iu the least afraid of being charged
with wickedness. He might, iu his unconverted state, have had some
foolish notions that tampering with solemn matters, for the sake of
folly or gain, might be objectionable, but the miracle above-mentioned
has convinced him that there is no fear of the Spirits of the Spiritual
Magazine being emissaries from the wrong world. For, the .Spiritual
Editor's Ghosts did—for a laudable purpose doubtless—a blackguard
action; they betrayed private confidence, whereas "The Prince of
Darkness is a Gentleman." But, perhaps, the action may be excused,
considering that the Spirit-business is an American invention, and so
is the habit of making public use of private confidences. No tune
brings up a Ghost so easily as Yankee Doodle.
LINES IN A SEASON OF SICKNESS*
BY A GOOD LIVER.
My stomach's ever craving fur enjoyment
And I supply it.
Because, from diet,
I do derive unspeakable enjoyment.
But then there comes the melancholy question,
Why do I suffer,

So much from gout, and bde, and indigestion?
Some people gorge their brains with erudition,
Learning and thinking:
Eating and drinking
So I've o'erworked my organs of nutrition.
AN OPERA OF TIIE FUTURE.
The events now proceeding in Sicily are serious enough; and it
seems a shame to regard the slightest circumstance relative to the
Sicilian struggle for liberty in a comic point of view; yet it is not easy
to help smiling on the perusal of the subjoined proclamation, which,
according to Foreign Intelligence, has been posted on the walls of
Palermo by the Royal Military Committee. Previously to quoting
that document, however, it ia requisite to state, according to the same
authority, that—
"Demonstrations continually take placo in Palermo, the mob shouting ' Viva
tItalia I' ' Viva fittore Bmmanuete I' 'Pita Oaribaldi /'"
The chorus of revolutionary outcries serves as an introduction to the
Royal notice, which follows in the obvious form of a recitative :—
"L* citla. dl Palermo e suo distrctto sono da questo momento iu pol posti in
iatato d'aoscdio."
The fact that the city of Palermo and neighbourhood are placed in a
state of siege is no laughing matter, but the foregoing declarat ion to
that effect cannot be read by any frequenter of Her Majesty's theatre
or the rival establishment in Covent Garden without suggesting to his
mind's eye and car the idea of i's delivery on the stage by some llalian
vocalist in the character of a podesta, or his subordinate beadle. We
hope we shall one of these days have the pleasure of hearing Signor
Mario, or Signor Ronconi, or Signor Vialetti sing the very
passage in an opera founded on the present Sicilian insurrection, to be
called Garibaldi, and to prove as successful as the celebrated hippo-
dramatic entertainment of that name. In strict agreement with his-
torical fact, this piece, we trust, will terminate with a blaze ot triumph,
in the midst of which Garibaldi, the conquering hero, will proclaim
Sicily annexed to the Italian kingdom, the blaze of triumph being, for
the satisfaction of poetical justice, combined with an eruption of Mount
Etna, down whose crater a legion of hobgoblins will lly away with
Bombalino.

THE ACTRESSES' FANCY FAIR AT MAYBURY,
Friday, June 1,1860.
Mb. Punch had a vision of rapture Elysian,
As calm on the Maybury heather he lay,
When the Pbince was invoking the lieges to Woking,
Our Thespian College foundation to lay.
I dreamed that his levee was graced by a bevy
Of Graces and Muses, a wreath on each brow;
But Muses and Graces displayed their sweet faces
In triple the force Lempriebe would allow.
Half-a-dozen Thalias at once from its bias
My adamant bosom distractingly drew;
In the guise of stage ladies, whose dangerous trade is
To turn young men's heads with their charms ever new.
Amy Sedgwick the gracious, and Woolgab vivacious,
And Wyndham, in graceful luxuriance, was there;
While Swanb'bough the stately swam round me sedately,
And whisper'd, "You're welcome to our Fanoy Fair."
Half-sighing, half-smiling, my senses beguiling
Now to tears, now to smiles, Muse of pathos and fun,
Came bright Fanny Stibllno, two banners unfurling—
Thalia's, Melpomene's, wreathed into one.
Terpsich'res a trio, con fuoco, con brio,
Came whirling and waltzing, in muslins so light,
And my throne archly dipt to, now crouching, now tip-toe,
As Leclekq, Lydia Thompson, and brave Rosy Weight.
And then I was ware of the bright golden hair
Of Erato thrillingly sweeping my brow,
1 snatched, and with rapture embracing my capture,
Cried "Muse of Love-poesy, say, is it thouP"
She struggled, untwining those ringlets gold-shining,
And exclaimed, "Mr. Punch, at my stall please apply."
And from my grasp whipping her locks perfume-dripping,
The lithe form of Hebbebt swept fleetingly by.
Clio, grasping her roll, was at hand to console,—
Under Heath's tender glances I knew the chaste Muse;
"There's fancy and fable, dear Punch, at my table;
I shall please you, I'm sure; though I know you hate blues."
I had followed chaste Clio—/3<«Stis like Io—
When at once three Polymnias down on me bear,
As arch Marie Wilton, her wreath'd lips a lilt on,
And Oliver piquant?, and Con e kill fail.
My pockets assailing, alternate prevailing,
Now this way, now that way, poor Punch they incline;
Till their sweet eyes to drink at, he buys toy and trinket,
As if his poor purse were a Ballarat mine-
So half charmed, half confounded, by Muses surrounded,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SECOND TYRANT OF SICILY.
E respectfully invite the atten-

Neapolitan Ambassador to
the following extract from
that amusing and instructive
work likMP&lfcu'a Classical

question may possess an in-
terest for his august master,
to one of whose Rojal pre-
decessors it, relates, namely,
to DlODTSins tub Second,

"Dionybii'8 wss as cruel as his

Mr Punch's compliments, the

toBombathe Second, whom
it concerns as much, and to whom it may convey a useful warning, if

him to mend.

MR. PUNCH AND 8HAKSPEARE.
Is describing his lare visit to the Crystal Palace,—or, to speak with
greater accuracy, one of his late visits (for, indeed, were the frequency
| of his attendance to be known, it might be advertised as one. of the
attractions of the place),—Mr. Punch was pleased to say that, "unlike
the Duke in Shakspeake," he is generally merry when he hears sweet
music. Mr. Punch made this remark as a test of the Shakspearian
erudition of his readers; and this laudable intention, as is usually the
Case with him, has been productive of some good One of his ten
million or so daily correspondents writes to ask, Who is the Duke to
whom the reference is madeP adding, that it 18 iu the mouth of pretty
Jessica that Shakspeake puts the line:—
"I am never merry when I hear sweet music."
Now they who own the literary omniscience of Punch are aware, of
course, that he was couscious of this fact; and they who know that
Punch, the Literary King, can do no wrong, must admit that he did
right iu writing as he did. A meaner mind might shrink from drawing
notice to what might he ignorantly viewed as a mistake, but. Mr. Punch
can well afford to risk such misconception; and if his writing has
sufficed to induce a Shakspeare reading, there surely is no reason
why he should repent it.
THE OPERA. AT SYDENHAM.
TjNTHrNKiso people may, perhaps, be startled by this heading,
and may imagine that "Her Majesty s" has been transplanted near
to Norwood, after the manner of the flying Palace of,Aladdin.
Rut the removal of an Opera is possible without the removal of a
Theatre, and so Rossini and Mozakt may migrate weekly down to
Sydenham without, having, like snails, to carry their house with
them. // Trovaiore and Otetto may start off arm-in-arm with Lucrezia
and Fidelio, and their music may be heard where the orange trees
of Paxru.N by no means waste their sweetness on the seldom desert
air.
In plainer words, the Opera Concerts at the Crystal Palace are a
means of giving vocalists a pleasant change of air, and of let ting
people hear the pleasant airs they bring with them. It is no new
thing to hear an opera in a hot house; for thoroughly well ventilated
as theatres may be, the way is not devised yet to prevent the gas
from heating them. But. an opera in a green house is a form of enter-
taimneut which, until the Crystal Palace came, we never had been
treated to. Instead of dingy wails and a close aud dusty atmosphere,
we have there c<h>1 air to breathe and sweet flowers to smell and look
at. Eyes and nose have equally a profit in the change; nor indeed
are ears iu any measure losers by it. The latk-uotes.of Album gush
forth all the more joyously for being in fresh air, and Mo.ngim sings
the clearer when the fog aud the smoke of Londou are no louger in
his throat. Nor can we much regret the absence of stage-scenery,
surrounded as we are by such delicious greenery: while, if we miss
the acting, we have our minds more left at liberty to give heed to the
singing, and so we easily may master our sorrow for the absence of the
creations of Grieve and Telbin.
To fathers of a family, the Opera at Sydenham offers great advan-
tages; for it enables them to take their wives and daughters to a
concert, without losing a good appetite by having to dine early, or
else deranging their digestions by jumping up from table and Jolting
in a carriage, instead of sitting quietly over their dessert. Pater-
familias, when he hears the inevitable question, "My dear, when are
you going to take the girls and me to hear AlboniP" will do well to
reply "My love, I think we'll go next Friday." On which a chorus
will arise from those well-informed young ladies, "Friday! Why,
Papa dear, Friday's not an Opera night!" Whereto, in his wisdom,
the Pater may rejoin, "No, my loves, but Friday is an Opera after-
noon; and as young persons are advised to keep out of the night air,
you would not wish Minima or me to risk our precious health by
exposing ourselves to it."
Opera-goers who dislike to turn out after dinner, should therefore
pay a visit and a crown to the C. P., and they will have occasion to
repent of neither payment. Good music is there to be heard in good
society, and what more could the Haymarket habitue desire P It is
said that, it is possihle to have too much of a good thing; but. good
music is a thing that, we can hardly have too much of. Even if one
could, there is very little fear of being surfeited at Sydenham; for the
Crystal Palace Concerts are confined to such a length, that even
people with short patienoe must often long for more of them.

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XVIII.—SHOWS WHAT THE KNIGHTS WORE IN
THE DAYS OF RICHARD THE FIRST AND JOHN.
V E are told that in the reigns
of the first Richard and
John "some striking no-
velties occurred in the
military habits;" but
whether the writer means
that the soldiers of the
period had a new habit
of striking, is a point on
which inquiry would re-
sult in little good. In
one respect there cer-
tainly seems ground for
that conjecture, for it was
during the first Richard's
time that the arbaleste,
or cross bow, first was
introduced ; * a weapon
which, unlike the cross-
bow used for rook-shoot-
ing, was apparently con-
structed for discharging
from the breast: so that,
by this new way of strik-
ing, archers, when they
shot true, hit straight
from the chest, instead
of hitting from the shoul-
der, like Heenan the
Hittite. Still we think, on reading farther, the context makes it clear that
the habit thus referred to was an active not a passive one; and that the
phrase bore an allusion to armour, not to arms. For the next sentence
informs us, in language quite as intricate as the dress which it des-
cribes, that over the coat of mail or hauberk, under which was the long
tunic, there now came into use a surcoat, called otherwise a surcote,
which was always made of silk excepting when it wasn't, and then if

not made of cloth of silver was composed of cloth of gold. To give us
a still clearer conception of the garment, we are told too, that this
* This statement slightly differs from that in our Eleventh Chapter, where, on the
authority of one of the authorities, we moutioned that the Norman bows were cross,
as sometimes were their wearers. That assertion we m-de chiefly for the pun
which it involved, and wo conceive that *vo were quite at liberty to make it: for we
found nothing said to show that the Norman bows were not cross, and If we had,
the fact would not havo stopjiod our observation, for the pun was a fcuffiulent proof
that what we said was said in joke.
surcoat, otherwise called surcote (the old writers, like some modern
ones, were not particular in spelling), sometimes was embroidered, but
more commonly was not, and although it sometimes was of variegated
colours, yet as forming a conspicuous part of a man's uniform, it was
made more frequently uniform in tint. To this interesting description,
we may add the information, that the surcoat is not shown upon the
great seal of King Richard, but it appears quite clearly on the great
seal of King John; and our impression from these seals is, that the
garment was first worn in the time of the Crusaders, both for distin-
guishing the various champions of the Cross, and for veiling their mail
armour from the scorching Eastern Sun.* This lat ter supposition seems
indeed extremely probable; for being shut up in steel armour when
half melted in the sun, would be almost as bad a torture as being shut
up by King Phalaris in his burning brazen bull.
In addition to the surcoat there were other martial vestments intro-
duced during this period, such as the gambeson or wambeys and the
haqueton or acketon. These were both of them a kind of wadded
and quilted tunic, the one being made of leather stuffed with wool, and
the other made of buckskin with a cotton stuffing. They were worn
for defence in the place of the mailed hauberk, by men who, though of
mettle, had not the tin to buy steel mail. But Knights who could
afford it wore them either over or underneath their hauberk, or some-
times in the lieu of it, just "according to the taste and fancy" of the
wearer, as Mr. Samuel Weller in his evidence remarked. In the
latter case these tunics were rendered ornamental as well as being
useful, by being Btitched with either silk or golden thread. From this
stitching of the gambeson it seems that the word "garuboised" was
afterwards derived, and applied to quilted saddles and other padded
articles. It seems too, that the stitching work was done on most parts
of the garment, so really it is not much out of reason to infer that the
wearers of it sometimes had some stitches in their sides.
Another military novelty at the end of the twelfth century was the
plate or under-breastpiece, called plastron de fer. This, as its name
indicates, was a sort of a steel plaster, worn both for preventing the
pressure of the hauberk, and also for affording more protection to the
chest. In later times the plastron was called sometimes the gorget,
and sometimes the haubergeon, a word which stupid people have con-
founded with the hauberk, not having sense or sight enough to see
that it is a diminutive and differently spelt. Like other diminutives,
as well persons as things, these chest plasters, though small, proved
sometimes of great use When for instance CffiUR de Lion, who was
t hen the Earl of Poitou, fought his famous single combat with the
Knight who was called W illiam, or more often Bill de Barris, the
horsemen charged each other with such fury and such force, that their
lances pierced clean through their shields, their hauberks and their
gambesons, and but for their plastrons would have come out at their
backs. Had this occurred it might remind us of the story of the por-
cupine, which, according to the showman, when hunted has been known
to "dart his squills up at the riders, and to skiver 'em as they rides."

FROM A MS, IN THE CELEBRATED "JONES COLLECTION." VXTER BEFORE ENGRAVED.
Had we not thought proper to reserve till now the statement, we
might, have said that in the time of King Henrt the Second the
helmet assumed almost the shape of a sugar-loaf; so when the ar-
mourers used to advertise "a sweet thing in helmets," there really
seemed some reason in t heir sugary remark. During Richard's reign,
however, it lost its lofty cone, and suddenly subsided into a flat-topped
cap of steel, fastened under the chin by a metal hoop or band. A
mention of this hoop, which was made usually of hoop iron, occurs in
one of those rare ballads of the period, which ant iquarians have to

1, 2, 3. HELMETS. TEMP. RICHARD TH1 FIRST AND JOHN.
4, 5, 6. TUB SAMS IV
To protect the face, the helmet was furnished with a grating, secured
on one side with a hinge and on the other with a pin, so that it could
be opened when the wearer blew his nose, or wanted anything to drink.
Little slits were cut in it for eyes and nose and mouth, and as the
helmet was cylindrical, and lilted closely round the back part of the
head it bore somewhat of resemblance to the nightshade of antiquity,
which was used when we were children, before the lights of Child.
There was a difference, however, between the nightshade and the
article which we may call the Knight-shade, for the slits in the latter
were horizontal apertures, and not like the round holes which let the
light out of our nightshade, and cast such well-remembered reflections
on the walls. The frontal door or grating was called the ventail or
atenlaille, as the earlier kind of cheek covers, we have said, were called
before it. In King Itichard's second seal the ventail is seen as
plainly as the nose upon his face, indeed a good deal more so, for the
nose is scarcely visible; but his first seal represents him as wearing
the coned helmet, which was used before the ventail had been intro-
duced. Somewhere in his writings, we forget precisely where, the
learned William de Malmesbury calls this face-cover a "breathynge
trappe;" and hence the not a whit less learned William Cox de
Finsbury has asserted that it was from the old Norman word "ventail"
that the English "ventil ator" was originally derived.
The flat top of the helmet somet imes was left plain, and was at other
times adorned with the crest of the wearer. The Knight of the
Leopard in the Talisman is described as being a follower of the former
knightly fashion, and an instance of the latter may be seen in the
costume of the doughty Earl of Salisbury, whose portrait, showing
a griffin covenant on his helmet, beautifies the pages of Pinnock's
Goldsmith's History, a work which we at school had not less at our
fingers' ends than at our ear-tips, whereto it was applied to knock
some knowledge of it into us. In Kino Richard's second seal his
helmet is surmounted by a curious fanlike crest, in front of which
appears the figure of a lion. This ornament is somewhat rudely repre-
sented, for engravers then were not so skilled as they are now, and the
meaning of their seals is often a sealed book to us. But undignified
although the confession may appear, we must own our first impression
from King Richard's second seal is that the King has seen a ghost,
or some other startling sight, and that the Royal hair is standing up on
end, and having piciced clean through his helmet, is spreading like the
quills upon the fretful porcupine, if a great King like Cojur dk Lion
may be in any way compared to so extremely insignificant a beast.
* The meaning nf these last words Is somewhat of a puzzle to us, and we are not
too proud to make avowal of the fact Dt ta French for "of," and doo or dhu, we
know, is Gaelic for " black." Poodfn doo mny formerly j ei hups have meant*" black

PERSECUTION IN IRELAND.
(An Article for the "Nation.")
With reference to a persecuted Saint, the Dublin Evening Mail
makes the following observations:—
"Miss Maroaret Aylward has been more than seven days engaged 1 from
morn to noon from noon to dewy eve* in not giving to tho officer of the Court of
Quoen's Bench the information which Is required about tho whereabout of the
kidnappe-1 child. Marv Mathews. The skilled reticence exhibited in such a pro-
tracted probation is almost unprecedented. What a famous reverend mother such
a lady would be over a sisterhood of female Trappists, supposing an order of that
nature possible,"
It is persecution Like that inflicted on the blessed Margaret
Aylward, Confessor and Virgin, which causes the Exodus of Irish
Saints, and impels them to enlist under the banner of the Keys, with a
view to crush the impious efforts of the Holy Father's subjects for the
rejection of the light and easy Papal yoke, and the attainment of const i-
tut ional government. The faithful Irish are restrained by cruel penalties
from every effort of pious zeal which may displease the despicable
feelings of odious Protestants. St. Margaret Aylward is baited,
under the Earl of Carlisle, with dogs of heretical attorneys,
barristers, and bailiffs, just as the early Christians were exposed to be
torn in pieces by wild beasts in the reign of Nero. It is lawful to
take an adder from its nest, remove its fangs, extract its venom,
domesticate it, and teach it to eat potatoes and butter-milk, but a
wretched infant is not to be snatched from out of a brood of heretics.
Of course there is no possibility of executing judgment against the
insolent blasphemers of the sacred Pope.
Go, then, ye suffering exiles of Erin, and either seek Paradise in the
Papal service, or peace in the Far West. They burned a man, the other
day, in Texas; you will find the edifying story in the New York
Tribune. He was not a Negro as to skin; his complexion was white,
but his soul was black with heresy. This blackguard was travelling in
the Buchanan district in the iufamous capacity of a colporteur. He
had some filthy Abolitionist tracts in his foul pockets. On suspicion
of having encouraged the Negroes to rebel, the enthusiastic crowd,
dispensing with the empty ceremony of trying such a vagabond,
soused him head over ears in a barrel of tar, and hung him up by a
limb over a tarred faggot-pile, and in that way burned him alive, as
Mary did Latimer. But what would the tyrannical English law do
if the religious multitude in this oppressed country were to make the
same example of a rascally Souper? Seek, therefore, the land where
slavery is an institution, and Irishmen are free—free to wallop their
Niggers like John Mitch el, and to roast the miserable objects of
their magnanimous resentment. Or go to Rome, and fight for the
blessed Pope, who is reviled for rescuing little miscreants from their
like St. Margaret Aylward.
'WHAT'S IN A NAMEf"
The new Dramatic College, we perceive, is situate at Maybury, in
the neighbourhood of Woking Cemetery. There is great consideration
shown in the selection of such a site for the convenient fulfilment
of the last duties to the old sons and daughters of Thespis, Thalia, and
Melpomene, which we trust they will duly appreciate. Let us hope we
may bury them in the long run; but not till they have long enjoyed the
repose of the College, llie name has suggested the following lines:—
May-bury? The name's apropos
To an exit from stage-life mercurial
To the grave if old actors must go,
By all means let them have a May-burial.
'Tis only applying to them, on their dying,
What in life they all loved—it is certain—
When the play played has been, May burial must mean,
Lots of flowers on the fall of the curtaiu.
Statistics of Domestic Happiness.
Among the Court Papers for Trinity Term 1800, appeared, the other
day, a list of suits to come on in the Full Court for Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes at Westminster. The cases in question amounted
to 153. Sir Cresswell Cresswell's Court is growing full indeed—
full usque ad nauseam.
a change of school.
There is a book which narrates the particulars of a journey from
Oxford to Rome. It was at one time feared that Mr Gladstone
might make that, pilgrimage; but the Chancellor of the Exchequer
has only travelled from Oxford to Manchester.

Mr. Bright the other evening obliged the House of Commons with

"The whole income of thane working-classes I believe to be understated at
£812,000.000 a year, while th„ whole income represented by all the Income-Tax
Schedules in April, 1867, amounted to £313,000,000."
Thc^e are very important figures, but should Mr. Bright have been
the man to cite them? He estimated the income of the 500.000
persons proposed to be enfranchised under the Reform Bill, the richest
of the unrepresented classes, at £80 a year each. At that rate the
represented differ from the unrepresented classes chiefly in paying no
Income-Tax. The only pecuniary advantage which they could derive
from representation would be that of paying no taxes whatever. This
may be a consideration which Mr. Henlet might very appropriately
advance on his side of the House and of the question; and it is one
which Mr. Bright also might urge to some purpose at a public
meeting composed of non-electors of £80 per annum. But what effect
did Mr. Bright expect his arithmetic to produce upon the House of
Commons P The effect, it would seem, of persuading Income-Tax payers,
and the representatives of Income-Tax payers, to vote for a change
which would probably result in throwing the whole weight of taxation
on their own shoulders. Mr. Bright should have raid nothing about
the vast mass of unrepresented income that pays no Income-Tax. He
has been very unjustly charged with animosity to the upper -'
it is quite clear that he entertains a very high idea of their
restedness and capability of self-sacrifice.

THE DAYS OF RICHARD THE FIRST AND JOHN.

harmless creatures; and although such things as "hurts" are not
unknown in heraldry, it was not from the lions that their bearers ever
got them. In some cases these "hurts," we learn were "blazoned
blue," a term which serves to throw some light upon the common
phrase of pugilists, to fight "till all is blue," or to go it like blue
blazes." Of a similar significance is the singular word golp," which
in heraldry is applied to a peculiar tint of purple, described as being
"the colour of an old black eye." We scarcely need to add that
striking specimens of "golp" are afforded by the arms (and fists) of
the P. R, upon occasions such as that when Jack Heenan the Hittite
fought his famous battle with Tom Saters the Sloggerite.

o complete our description of the armour of this
period, we should mention that the men of arms
were wont to clothe their legs in flexible chain mail,
anil case their hands in plated gauntlets and their
feet in plated shoes. These latter were made some-
what sharply pointed at the toe, and their weight
must have served painfully to emphasise a kick.
Indeed we cannot wish to realise the feelings of
Prince Leopold, the Austrian arch-duke, who is said to have received
a kick from Cojor de Lion, which sent him sprawling ignominiously
clean out of his tent." In his novel of the Talisman (the interests of our
readers have obliged us to resort to reading novels lately). Sir Walter
Scott does not recount this stirring incident. He however calls
attention to what may be regarded as confirmatory evidence, for he
describes the Duke as having "an awkwardness in his gait," which
was very probably occasioned by the kick.
(We may state in a parenthesis, so as not to interrupt the subject of
our Book, that it was very likely the remembrance of this insult which
tempted Leopold to clap Kino Richard into prison, on his return
from the crusades through the Austrian dominions. How the monarch
was discovered by the "poor French minstrel" Blond el, who played
a tune upon his harp which was echoed by Kino Richard, every
student of history ot course is well aware. But it may be news to
some people t hat the harper of romance was in reality an organ-grinder,
and that the tune he played was that of which the venerable vaccine
creature had expired.)
During these two reigns, we find that shields decreased in length;
and being less arched at the top, they gradually assumed the triangular
form, which from its resemblance to a flat iron was afterwards called
heater-shaped. They, however, were not flat, but were made semi-
cylindrical; for which a writer less refined would use the commoner
term, half round. "This was the age," says Golbsmitii, "when
chivalry most flourished, and when most attention was paid to the
heraldic devices of the knights;" and accordingly we learn that it was
at this period that shields were first aaorned with the bearings of their
bearers. John's early seal exhibits two lions passant regardant, a
position assumed sometimes by two "lions" at a soirie, who en passant
very often glare at one another as though they had a longing to be
lions combatant. John's second seal, however, as well as that of
Richakd (it was the fashion then for sovereigns to sport a brace of
seals, although as they were anything but "constant correspondents,"
one would surely have sufficed for all t he letters that they wrote) was
blazoned with three lions, as quartered ever since in the Royal Arms
of England.
To people unacquainted with the terms of heraldry it may sound a
little startling to be told that one has lions quartered in one's arms; a
tale which even seems more terrible than if one heard it said that they
were quartered on one's larder. But the old heraldic lions were very

CATHEDRAL (IMPROVED).
Quite in keeping with the cumbrous armour of this period were the
spears and swords and ot her weapons which were worn with it. Indeed
the small arms which were used were anything but small, and required
no little strength, and practice too, in wielding them. The long two-
handed sword was of such length that it reached from the shoulder to
the ancle, and we can readily give credence to the statement of a writer
that "y" longe sworde offtene servedde to make shorte worke of an
ennemie." It was with this weapon, according to Sir Walter, that
Kino Richard at one blow severed a steel mace-handle of two inches
in thickness; a feat of strength which so astonished the weak minds of
the Saracens, that they fell to making jokes of the most imbecile
description :—one of them remarking, that the weapon like its wearer
was a good-tempered blade, while another said that Richard, although
he called himself a Christian, was clearly a good Muscle-man.
Of the arbaleste, or arblast, we already have made mention, as being
introduced in the time of Cgsur de Lion. This weapon, we have said,
was a kind of crossbow made for discharging from the breast; and
besides being extremely clumsy in itself, it was furnished with appen-
dages which were hardly less so. The windlace was an instrument to
pull the string up to the trigger, and every arblast shooter therefore
had to carry it; and besides, to load his bow he had to load himself
with bolts, which being somewhat weighty were bars to his quick
progress. The bolt we should observe, was likewise termed the
quarrel; and we are told that it was called so because it had a square
or diamond-s-haped head, though this seems hardly to explain the
meaning of the word. A far better derivation, we think, would be to
say that archers picked their bolts out when they picked their quarrels,
and so in course of time the terms became synonymous.* Of course
our readers will remember that it was with the arblast that King
Richard was shot, as he rode round Chalus Castle, which he was then
besieging. Nor need we to remind them that when the man was asked
why he had shot the King, he replied, "Because the King, with his
own royal hand, killed my father and my two brothers, and though my
death may be en suite, to me revenge is sweeter." On this his Majesty
retorted, "Ah, our jester is an arch man, but you are certainly an
archer;" whereupon, to quote the poet (we are our own poet when
we have no quotation handy)—
"Pleased with his joke, the King his pardon gave,
But savago Marcade fiayed alive the knave."
• We may note thatwliilo tho arrows for tho arblast were called "bolts," the
arrows which wero shot with the long bow were termed "shafts;" and hence
aroso the proverb. "I will mako a shaft or a bolt of it," a phrase equivalent to
"doing It by hook or by crook," mcanii-g that if the thing could not be done in
one way, it should be in another. The saying was however somotimes used in ohaff,
as for instance, when an archer missed his aim and ran away, his friends took care
to Bay that If he hadn't made a shaft, ho had clearly made a bolt of It I

(To Mr. Punch.)
Sir,— According to a
newspaper announce-
ment, a conversazione
is fixed to take place
on Thursday evening,
June 21, at the South
Kensington Museum,
for the purpose of
helping to build an
edifice for an edu-
cational institution,

what do you think?
—the Female School
of Art and Design!
It is a fact, Sir. As

among the principal1
appliances of Female
Art and Design. I suppose there will be also a display of cosmetics and perfumes. 'Kalydqr'
\ Creme de I'lmperaince' (which must be a physiological curiosity), 'Fleur de VAge' which
is translated in the advertisements 'Bloom of Youth,' a preparation possibly intended to
make aged faces look youthful, will be probably contained in the exhibition of articles which
are commonly employed by Females with artful and designing views. To these insidious
inventions will also doubtless be added' Rondeletia,' 'Fairy Bouquet,' * Eaude Bully,' 'Wood
Violets'and 'Jockey Club Perfume,'and most of the other scents which are recommended
for the boudoir, inclusive of' Kiss-me-Quick.' The collection will, perhaps, comprise 'teeth
of pearly whiteness,' composed of porcelain. There will be no end of bonnets and hats of
the Bort that fashionable writers call 'coquettish* on view, I dare say; and I wonder if
there will be sn exposition of the various contrivances whereby Female Art and Design,
inspired with Taste, have sought, in modern times, to improve a lady's figure by expanding
its apparent proportions from those of the Medicean Venus to those of the Hottentot. At
least 1 question whether the Bhow of attractive apparatus and machinery will include hoops
and crinoline, in which ridiculous incumbrances those incrementitious adjuncts to natural
grace and Bymmetry have culminated. I should almost think not. I suspect that the majority
of women hate and detest those ridiculous and troublesome superfluities as much as men
do, and only wear them because they are worn by their superiors, whose example they are
obliged to follow by an irresistible instinct. The ends of Female Art and Design would not.
be promoted by submitting the deplorable absurdities of Fashion to the inspection of
mankind.
"It may be as well to mention, for the information of any young men who are sufficiently
confident of their own strength of mind to have no fear of being captivated by bewitching
wiles, and who may be curious to see and examine the Bundry decorative objects which are
the appurtenances and [productions of Female Art and Design, that admission to the con-
versazione at which they will be exhibited is to be had by tickets only, procurable from Mr.
Philip Ctjnliffe Owen, at the South Kensington Museum; from any member of the
Committee of the School for the cultivation of feminine cunning; or at 37, Gower Street,
from Miss Gann. Superintendent of that dangerous institution. All of those parties will be
ready to receive donations from anybody who is of opinion that Female Art and Female Design
ought to be encouraged. It may be that those old gentlemen who are blessed with grown-up
daughters will be of that opinion; for my own part, Sir, I am glad to Bay my blessedness is
single.

FINANCIAL JUSTICE.
A Writer on "Income-Tax Prospects," in
the Saturday Review, makes the following
observation:—
"Our Chahckllor or the Exchequer may be safoty
trusted to see that, when the State chaiyea its subjects
with the annual cost of government and of insurance
against foreign aggression, it is no more under a duty
to take account of tho varieties in the sources of their
income than is the butcher who debits the Duke or
Sutherland, and Johh Smith, the greengrocer, with the
price of the mutton he has supplied for their respective
dinuers."
Of course, John Smith, the Greengrocer, is
obliged to consume as much mutton as the Duke
of Sutherland. John Smith has no power
of meeting hard times by abstinence from mut-
ton, and can never be reduced to dining off his
owu cabbage and potatoes. John Smith, who
has no life interest in the market-garden which
produces his vegetables, whose whole property
consists of bis stock-in-trade, and who, should
he fail in business, must go to the Workhouse,
can afford to pay an Income-Tax just as well as
the Dijkb of Sutherland can. The maker of
the smallest income can afford the deduction of
so much per cent, from it, equally well with
the receiver of the largest; or, if he cannot
afford it, his inability to afford it is nothing to
the purpose, and ought to be altogether ignored.
In that view of the case, the Income-Tax is much
too indulgent to John Smith as compared with
the Duke of Sutherland. The Greengrocer
ought to be made to pay not only proportionally,
but absolutely, as much Income-Tax as the Duke
pays; and should the amount demanded of hint
exceed his income, he ought to be sold up, and
the proceeds of his stock and his sticks be applied
to satisfy, as far as they will go, the just demands
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Jack the Giant-Killer Bedivivus.
To think of finding the old nursery wardrobe in full wear in Sicily! The Neapolitan
Police-torturers in that island have for some time, it seems, been using the "cap of dark-
ness." Garibaldi has now come down upon them with the "sword of sharpness;" and
the ibirri of B«mbalino have found the " shoes of swiftness" to run away with.

The Sea Serpent, according to the 'Northern

Captain William Tatlor, master of the British
Banner, whom our canny contemporary describes
as "a native of South Ronaldahay, and a gentle-
man of unimpeachable veracity and great intel-
ligence." It may be sufficient to state that
Captain William Tatlor declares that the
monster bit off the bowsprit, jib-boom, sails,
and rigging of his vessel, and then swallowed
the foretopmast, the staysail, the jib, and flying-
jib, with the greatest apparent ease. This beats
spiritualism. Want of space compels us to

THE LIVERPOOL BOMBAS.
Disitjtin g with a cabman is not a very pleasant or ennobling occu-
pation, and when, by any chance, the cabman happens to be right, the
dispute somewhat partakes of a humiliating tendency. Now a squabhle,
we are told, has been going on in Liverpool between the cabmen
and the Town Council of that important port: and we incline rather
to think that the latter have not raised themselves in public estima-
tion by their acts, either in starting or conducting the dispute. A
letter we last week inserted on the subject will have informed our
readers of the matter in contention; which is, whether cabmen, while
waiting for a fare, are to be permitted to seek solace in a pipe. This
momentous question has been argued by the Council with (no doubt)
some strength of argument, while the cabmen have discussed it in
language doubtless stronger. It seems an old bye-law exists prohi-
biting the practice; and although it has been long considered a dead
letter, the Council have determined to bring it into life again. Were
our opinion asked, we should say that such a bye-law is clearly a
gone-bye law, being quite at variance with the spirit of the age. So
long as he abstains from making it a nuisance, a cabman, being a free
subject, surely has a right to smoke. If he makes himself offensive,
of course he will be told of it, and the public, by not hiring him, will
soon put out his pipe. The remedy may surely, then, be trusted to
their hands; and there is really no occasion to make Liverpool like
Naples, by taking a tobacco leaf from Bomba's book, and issuing
proclamations against smoking in the streets.
But this is not the only point of likeness which is traceable; for we
learn that the Town Council have taken yet another leaf from the same
book, and are subjecting a number of her Majesty's free subjects to a
treatment as tyrannical as that which has been practised by King
Bohba's own police. The Liverpool Mercury informs us that—
"Tbo promoters of the Cardrivers' Memorial to the Town Council for the repeal
of tbo bye-law which prohibits them from smoking, wished to place sheets for
Fignatnre in the street*, so ss to ebcit a demonstration of tbo feeling of the nubile;
but wo learn, to our astonishment, that the pollco interfered to prerent this not
unusual course of procedure. We always thought that the right of petitiou was oue
of the peculiar and inalienable privileges of Englishmen; but in municipal matters,
at all events, the police seem determined to extinguish tho right. Not only do (hoy
prohibit smoking in the streets, but writing .11 the streets. Not only do they refuse
to let a Cabdriver indulge in tbo luxui y of a pipe, but they will not allow him to
to iudulg
petition the Town Council for permission t
dulge in it."
Whether a Town Council is invested with a right to put a cabman's
pipe out, is a point which we may leave to lawyers to determine; for
sometimes common law is one thing and common sense another. But
we cannot well believe that there exists an Act of Parliament which
prohibits one from signing a petition in a street. If there be, the
sooner it is blotted out the oetter; for England will soon cease to be
viewed as a free country, if men are not at liberty to write their names
down publicly, without having their shoulders tapped by the police.
FEMALE ORPHAN ASYLUM.
A Young widower, endowed with a handsome face, a graceful and
elegant figure, an amiable disposition, immense property, first-rate
education, brilliant abilities, refined taste, especially in dress, peculiarly
fascinating manners, and a great many other advantages too numerous
to mention, would be happy to enter into a matrimonial engagement
with any young lady of sound principles, good sense, good temper, fair
education, and moderate personal beauty, whose face may constitute
her sole fortune. To these recommendations there must be added one
condition, wbich is indispensable. Having already had an experience
of that state which, when not embittered by discord and dissension, is
truly described as domestic happiness, he has come to the conclusion
that the partner of his lot, if it is to be an agreeable one, must have
no relatives whose interference and importunities will be likely to
create variance between himself and his wife. Immediate atten
tion will be paid, with the strictest secresy, to any communication,
addressed to Punch') Office, by any fatherless and motherless young
lady, and a decided preference would be given to a Friendless.

THE ORPHfiONISTES' INVASION.
(Respectfully Dedicated to Sir Edmund Head.)
BY A BRITISH ALARMIST.
The Orpbe'onistes are coming! They are three thousand strong,
And every one's a Frenchman, with imperial fierce and long;
They're gathering to Sydenham, to the Crystal Palace fair,
On pretence of making music—but we don't believe that 'ere.
There's baseness in French trombones; there's sharpness in French
horns;
There's a sting in every serpent whose coil that band adorns;
Those seeming harmless violas are strung for violation
Of every blessed liberty of this moat favoured nation.
Their sharps will turn out bayonets, their flats invading boats;
Their scores will grow to thousands, with hands upon our throats:
You may think the gamut harmless, but, under it, I see
Allusion clear to Joan or Arc—the maid of "Do r6-mi."
The key they hope to sing in, is the key that opens wide
Our doors to an invader from the Chaunel's further side:
With a Berceuse from Ciiopin, they'd the British Lion lull;
Orpheus of old charmed brutes—why not the Orpbeouiates John Bull?
i
j Their pianos, once admitted, will soon to fortes turn;
| Zouaviter in modo, they '11 pillage, kill, and burn.
Let those who will laugh down alarms; in spite of sneers, I tell 'em,
That Syd'nham's organ-bellows, French-blown, will bellow helium.
I've faith in national enmities; th' entente cordiale I scout,
I see no good in nations going gadding all about;
Betwixt the French and English no harmony can be;
Their overtures for overtures of peace won't pass with me.
And even if they come to sing, their time and pains they lose;
I hate French taste, just as I bate French frogs and wooden shoes;
They hold Partant pour la Syrie than tbe National Anthem finer,
And would fain have Rule Britannia transposed, and in C minor.
Then bar the door against these masked and musical invaders:
"Peace and good will" 's all very well, for a toast among freetraders j
But I'm a staunch Protectionist, and bold old-fashioned views—
That for work or play one Briton is worth three Parleyvoos.
Or if, in spite of warning, these Orpheonistes must come,
At least let's get some good from their Tweedle-dee and dum.
As Amphion, that first Orpheonist, raised Thebe's walls by song,
So let these modern Orpheonistes make our defences strong.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
June Uh. Monday. By far the most important Parliamentary state-
ment of the week is that Big Ben being irretrievably cracked, and
London being melancholy at not hearing a Voice from the Golden
Tower, the hours are to be struck on the largest quarter-bell, which is
about as big as that which the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's make
such a good thing by showing.
Hypocrisy has, however, had a good go in this week. On Monday, the
Reform farce came on again; and on its being moved that the House
should go into Committee thereupon, a heap of amendments were pre-
i seated, most of which the Speaker declared to be utterly foolish and
inadmissible. Mr. Bentinck was very bumptious, and had to be
spoken to with considerable severity. A lot of preliminary rubbish
having been cleared away, Lord John Russell solemnly moved that
the Speaker should leave tbe Chair, and, after a good deal of rather
heavy defence of the Bill and the conduct of Ministers, intimated that
he had no objection to submit to alterations which might be made in
! the Bill in Committee,—at which humility there were derisive taunts.
He threw over the Irish and Scotch Reform Bills, as quite impossible
j to be processed with this Session; so that, if the English Bill should
pass, the country will be able to say to Lord John, with the wicked
Count Cenci in Shelley's Play :—
"And yon give out that you have half reformed me."
I But Lord John could not sit down without perpetrating some
mischief, so he ended S/ citing foolisldy offensive expressions, which
j some of the Tory speakers had used in reference to tbe humbler classes,
and he intimated that such words ought to sink into the hearts of the
people. In the course of his speech he had alluded to an " obscure
writer" in the Quarterly Review, who had abused him, and, hi Mr.
Punch mentioned with horror some time back, had declared for the
deposition of Mr, Disraeli. His Lordship wanted to know who was
the leader of Opposition.
Mr. Disraeli rose and declared that he was, and intended to remain
so, and act ing up to his notion of his position, he fired a good deal of hot
shot into Lord John, arguing that the alteration of the Constitution
was too important a matter to be dealt with in the fast and loose
manner adopted by that remarkable young nobleman. He, of course,
resisted the going into Committee. After some more talk, the debate
was adjourned until tbe Thursday.
It is convenient to Mr. Punch, and be hopes that it will be equally
so to the world, and whether it is or not he does not in the least care,
that the remainder of the Reform Story should be told. The debate
was resumed on Thursday, when Lord John, being asked whether
there would be a dissolution, if the English Reform Bill passed, said
that if there were a dissolution Parliament would be dissolved, and
he could not be got to make any further revelation. Sir James
Ferguson moved that the English Bill should not go into Committee
till the Irish and Scotch Bills had beeu read a second time, as he
had no notion of different Constitutions for the three Kingdoms.
Then came on a long and affectedly earnest debate, in which Mr.
Bright supported his friends the Ministers, and hinted at "disaster"
in the event of the Bill being rejected,—the Hon. Quaker being sup-
posed to mean a row. Lord Palherston pretended to abuse those
who had made long speeches against the Bill, and rather profanely,
considering the season, jeered at them as having the "gift of tongues,
but licence may be permitted to a Minister who appoints only Evan-
gelical Bishops, at the direction of Lord Shaftesbury. He " hoped"
that the Bill would be carried. At length the Conservatives took a
division, and were beaten on Sir J. Ferguson's motion by S69 to
2-iS, and then on a motion for adjournment by 267 to 222, when the
debate was adjourned till the Monday.
Tuesday. The Sunday Trade and Howling Bill was passed in the
Lords, and the Wine Licences Bill was read a Second Time, and on
the Friday it went through Committee, despite a good deal of growling.
In tbe Commons, the only interesting feature of the night was a dis-
play of extreme absurdity hy Bentinck and Baili.ie Cochrane about
the Civil Service Examinations, those accomplished geut.lemen thinking
it a hideous and horrible thing that anybody should be bound to under-
stand history or geography. Sir G.Lewis turned the laugh of tbe
House upon Bentinck, who did not know that Darwin was an
English writer.
Wednesday. A Bill for handing over a good deal more of the property
of the Church to tbe Ecclesiastical Commissioners was debated with
considerable rancour. But the manners of the House must be very
good, and its sense of propriety rather fastidious, for a Member saying
that the Bill was calculated to create "nomination boroughs under the
clergy" was vehemently called to order, and felt it necessary to
apologise for .that terrifically irreverent expression. The debate was
adjourned.
Thursday. Lord Teynhak made a ludicrous motion in favour of a
Reform of his own, which greatly amused tbe House, and which Lord
Granville opposed as gravely as he could. When the Peers had done
laughiug at Teynham, his proposal was promptly extruded.
Friday. In the Upper House Lord Brougham, with repeated
expressions of utter incredulity as to the reported bombardment of
Palermo, earnestly implored Lord Granville to declare it a hoax;
calling it, conditionally, an unexampled atrocity, inasmuch as the
burning of Rome by Nero was not so bad; and provisionally de-
nouncing Bomba the Second as the author of au atrocious offence,
and a tyrant more execrable than the most execrable of ancient tyrants,
whose name had become proverbial for tyranny. Non-intervention
was a sacred rule; but there were exceptional cases: and if the
answer he should receive was not in the negative, the Tyrant of Naples
ought to be sent to Jericho. Lord Granville was sorry to crush
the fond hopes of the noble and learned lord by informing him that
the bombardment of Palermo was au accomplished crime.
The Duke op Somerset, in answer to Viscount Dungannon,
admitted that Government had given from 400 to 500 dockyard work-
men at Portsmouth the sack, having unfortunately engaged a greater
number of hands than they wanted. The report that the men had been
employed at French dockyards was bosh. The truth was more t'other:
as 400 shipwrights had been dismissed from Cherbourg. A Polioe
report, however, shows that the Duke was rather in a hurry to deny
the story.
In the Commons, the most important business consisted in the
motion of adjournment till Monday, on which no less than thirty-two
questions concerning things in general were put and answered, for the
most part, with exemplary brevity. Mr. H. Baillie then complained
of the too sweeping disarmsment of the mild Hindoo. His complaint
was backed by Colonel Sykes, and elicited an inaudible defence of
that precaution from Sir C. Wood, and a needless justification of it
from Mr. Vansittart. Leave having been given to Outsiders for the

THE CONVEYANCER'S PUPIL'S LAMENT.
Whew hands with writing deeds are shaking.
And fevered brains with abstracts aching,
And hearts for lack of fees are breaking;
When tangled titles bring despair,
And blackest drafts of wills are there,
From niany a sharp Attorney's den;
There is a throb of rapture still,
One gleam breaks through the clouds of ill,
One thought buoys up the sinking will;
It is the hope of evening drill,
And breathing once fresh air again.
The time draws on to'ards half past four j
But still fresh work remains in store;
A gloomy draftsman still dictates,
And warns we must obey the fates.
I hear the trumpet's blast alarming,
In every stair-case men are arming,
As gentle evening falls:
The Temples send a goodly train,
And Lincoln's Inn and Chancery Lane,
And Gray's monastic halls.
The briefless here, a sturdy band,
Both practice and respect command,
While grim Q C.'s inactive stand,
And miss the Court's applause.
Lord Campbell's eyes with joy would shine,
Could Law and Equity combine,
As here they form one stalwart line,
To aid their country's cause.
One law inspires, one badge each cap bedfeks,
'Tis salus populi suprema lex.
But ah! no bugle's sound that frays
The owlets on the bench of Gray's,
No Brewster's voice may raise my mettle,
Or help me this vile draft to settle.
Alas! the hour has passed away;
Too late to join my squad to-day!
One voice still interrupts my lines,
'Tis Erors admbrs 8f assigns.
THE ROYAL ACADEMY.
"Mr dear Punch,
"When Scumbleton prates to me about the Limner's Art,
and the eternal truth of its principles, I lose my patience. If Art has
any principles at all, they are of an elastic nature, and we may adapt them
at our pleasure to the exigences of a generous public. Of the Nine
Ladies who, in classic days, kindly presided over the Arts and Sciences,
I don't find one who devoted herself to the patronage of painters.
Depend on it, that duty was undertaken by the Goddess who is usually
represented with a wheel, and prepared to take the chief part in blind-
man's-buff at the shortest notice, les, it is the fair virgin, Fortuna,
whom we cultivate in Soho, and you shall study all the Authors who
have written on our profession—from Pliny to Mr. Rtjskin—without
arriving at any certain conclusion on the subject. The truth is, t here is
a fashion which guides our pencils and distributes our paint. Fallacia
alia aliam trudit. The other day the Grand School was in vogue, and
now there is a Pras-Raphaelite furore. Has it not been so in all ages:
Did not Giotto put Sionor Cimabue's Florentine nose out of joint P
and was not the former interesting youth himself surpassed in later
ages by one Raphael, who in his turn, altered his style after seeing
the great Buonarotti P
"Good old Sir Joshua, shifting his trumpet and quoting Quin-
tillian, would not, 1 suspect, have many listeners among the bearded
wide-awaken'd students of the Royal Academy a.d. 1860; and if Sir
George Howland Beaumont, Bart., could but revisit this sphere,
what would his feelings be at the present state of the Landscape
I School—to find that Mr, Hook will paint grass green, and that Mr.
Naish does not think it beneath his dignity to represent a rock—as
he sees it!
"What a change we have seen in our own time. When I ambi-
tiously- competed for (and signally failed to obtain) the R. A. gold
medal for the best oil-painting, the subject given to the candidates
was, as well as I can recollect,' Curias Dentalus, showing his hollow tooth
to the Sanitates, descants on the vanity of human ambition,' and a very
fine Classical picture my friend Borax made of this truly Classical
subject, But, peace to the ashes of the Grand School! Tempora
mutantur! and if tempera, as Wiscount W. justly remarked, why
not oil-painting, tooP Who cares now for the Classic School? The
earth has closed finally over Marcus Curtius, and we no longer see
depicted his daring act of horsemanship. Aristides is banished—
never to return. Where are our old friends the Parcse? Alas, we
no longer sympathise with Sisyphus, and Orpheus fiddles to us in vain.
The woes of the gentle but unfortunate Hecuba, the wanderings of
the youthful and pious jEneas, have ceased to afford subjects for the
modern brush, and I think few of us regret the change. To my mind
(naturally prosaic, I admit) there are incidents in the nineteenth century
quite as well worth recording on canvas as the events which occurred
in Olympus; and, to say the truth, I would rather possess an honestly
painted picture of modern life than acres of canvas 'after' the glo-
rious antique. But, revenons a nos moutons. Mr. Cooper's Sheep are
well grouped, and vigorously painted, and so faithful seems the wintry
aspect of his picture, that if ever I go down to East Cumberland, I'll
take very good care not to cross 'Neicbiggin Muir in a Snow-drift.'
"Mr. Thomas, in his 'Dimanche,' has well characterised the little
French corporal and his charmer with the pink parasol, as they stroll
in the Tuileries. This is as it should be. It is better for the Mar-
quis d'un Sou to bestow his hand upon his faithful Adeline than to
carrv his arms ioperfide Albion.
"Mr. S. Solomon deserves great praise for a novel and admirable
treatment of an old subject. It required no ordinary skill to give
those stern Egyptian faces the tender womanly expression which they
wear. The 'Moses' (346) is a good specimen of the rising school—
well studied—purely coloured—finely drawn.
"'Aw!—feflar chopping sticks—Ah!' was the brilliant observation
of a swell who stood before Mr. Brett's 'Bedger.' Tfes, a fellar
chopping sticks, good Sir, while his little daughter trips along with
his homely meal—there, that will do for you—the subject, is not quite
in your line. Pass on to the portraits of your illustrious friends,
and leave me to the full enjoyment of this charming bit of sylvan
shade, for a little while, before I, too, move on to be pushed and
hustled in front of the 'General Post Office, 1 Minute to 6.' I say
this advisedly, for the crush represented in Mr. Hicks's picture gives
only a faint idea of the crowd around it. The glimpses which you
catch of it, between hats, over shoulders, and under arms, increase the
reality of the scene. There is a charming little 'party,' in a plaid
shawl, hurrying to post her letter to him evidently. The envelope
bears a blue stamp, and doubtless contains two-pennyworth of the

1
usual tows, and sighs, and poetical quotations, underlined everywhere
but in the right place. (We all know them: one love-letter is much
like another—from the tender epistle of Heloise down to poor
Betty's Valentine). A porter who has had a hard run for it wipes
his forehead in a great heat, on the right hand, while an old gen-
tleman is exhibiting great coolness on the left. Letters fly in all
directions—papers arrive in thoals. How could my Lord Derby
after seeing this picture—but—bat why should 1 add to his remorse?
'"The Governess' (40">) tells its story very well—perhaps a little
too loudly. We ridicule the old Mediaeval plan of writing the name
and title against each object in a picture. If we were to read such
inscriptions as:—
CTfjis is s poote ®ofarrnrs3f,
Ctjia is an irate aiSrrmanne hns Wiitt,
J^trt. are g' rhrrftg dijdtrrn,
&c. &c., on E. Osborn's canvas, risum teneatis amici? Yet, virtually,
the thing is done here, by what a German might call exaggerative-
moral-delineation. A Governess may look injured, and patient, with-
out seeming quite a St. Catharine of a martyr: it is possible to
represent an Alderman's Wife as haughty and vulgar, without remind-
ing one of Billingsgate; and though, I must say, ill-bred children are
great plagues, I think if only one of these little ones had been seen
clinging fondly to her teacher, the picture would have lost none of its
effect, and perhaps have seemed a little more true to nature.
"426 is, in my humble opinion, one of the best landscapes in the
room, and Mb, MacCallum may feel very certain to which of Mr.
Buskin's 'Two paths' his 'Rustic Path' belongs. I think it is a
•with which must one day join the road to Fame. His partner (Mr.
Iicks) has succeeded no less admirably in the figures, and all who
examine them may exclaim, in the language of a Surrey audience—
'Brayvo Hicks!' Mr. Linnell's more ambitious painting (451),
leads us 'Atop of the Hill,' where the horizon is cerulean enough to
give any ordinary observer the blues. With that masterly skill, how-
ever, which characterises this artist, he has made light of the middle
distance, though parts of the foreground, are it must be confessed,
rather shady.
"In these days, when every eighteen inches square of painted canvas
is expected to ' point a moral or adorn a tale it is carious to come
upon a picture which does neither. I have looked again and again at
Mr. Clark's ' Chest-Players' without being able to arrive at the
motive. That the window is open, I openly admit. That the old gen-
tleman is going to sneeze is also a self-evident fact. April? I don't
know. Perhaps they will shut down the sash.
"If Mr. Heapht's 'First Pie' had not such an unwholesome look-
ing crust, one might congratulate the smiling pretty novice on her
first initiation to the mysteries of the culinary art. As it is, my diges-
tive functions forbid the compliment.
"The 'Return of the Missing Crete,' by Mr. Barwell, is a good
homely English subject, skilfully painted, and contains more real
poetry than a dozen High Art achievements, full of glaring morals
and sham sentiment.
"A little harmless 'Mischief' now and then is very good fun, and
Mr. R< issuer's picture of that, title is clever and amusing. We may
see in the flirtation at the door which of the three divinities has been
preferred by the judgment of this modern Paris. Her sister, evidently
annoyed that she did not receive the apple, is about to make a Rib-
stone pippin the instrument of her vengeance. Let us hope the rosy
apple will not disturb the blushing pair.
Can I leave the West Boom without thanking Mr. Opns for his
* Peasant Girl' (348) and his 'Quiet Afternoon' (221) P They wear an
air of simple modesty, which no one can help admiring. As I look at
them, and think of the great Cornishman who died some fifty years
ago, I am glad to find the name of Opie still associated with our
English fields and homesteads.
"Faithfully yours," Jack Easel."
MRS. JOAN ARKER'S OPINIONS ON DRILL.
Friends, as well as foes, may say what they think proper, but I still
contend that Bifie Volunteers are to be admired, from every point of
view. Ruth Dove, an intelligent and pretty young Quakeress, was
conversing with me for two hours yesterday, in her mild and sensible
way, and endeavouring to prove that we should strive to disarm our
enemies by kindness, and pour not vinegar, but oil, on their minds.
I see no objection to others using the flask, if I may retain the castor;
but there is one condiment whose tranquillising properties admit of no
argument, I allude to pepper, and 1 sincerely nope that Britannia's
cruet-stand will never be wanting in that.
Then again my amiable young friend delicately hints that onr opposite
neighbour is much too polite and tender-hearted ever to dream of
throwing missiles over our Wall. I hope he is, but according to all
accounts, he has not had a very good example set him at home, and 1
have heard that he has boasted of tearing leaves out of his Uncle's

Now this military movement is not only a national, it is a domestic
blessing. Mr. Arker is constitutionally a fidgety man. For months
past he had been nervous and out of sorts; a fluctuation in the funds
had always been followed by a fluctuation in his spirits. He had in-
variably complained of a sinking, whenever there was a fall of the
reduced. A slight tightness of the money-market has given him a
severe pain at the chest. Unfortuuately being of a speculative turn,
he has gone very deep into Mines, and was constantly getting into a
bloomy vein. Whenever there was a thunder storm be announced that
t he Church was in danger, and would shake his head mysteriously at
the weather-cock, and prophesy the downfall of Ministers.
How altered is his aspect now! Since he obeyed his country's sum-
mons and took proper steps for her protection, his countenance, instead
of keeping pace^vilh the barometer, has brightened permanently into
set fair, whde his nerves have become as firm as fidalestrings. With
what manly pride he first donned his accoutrements! I buttoned his
kuickerbockers and fastened his belt. He then glanced at himself in
the glass, and gave me such a sly smile, just as he did when we walked
arm-in-arm out of Beckenham Church thirty years ago. He now talks
hopefully of an approaching era, when all who are interested in Bail-
ways will feel that their lines have fallen in pleasant places, when the
Income-Tux will only be remembered as a financial night-mare, and
when bribery and corruption will be shuddered at as a frightful dream.
When Woman, no longer cooped up by vulgar prejudice, will find an
open field fur her exertions, and Man, basking in her smiles, will no
longer vainly yearn to mitigate her sighs.
I used often to scold him for his untidy habits. Now his new dress-
coat fits him like a glove, and his breast is prominent and pigeonly.
He would also frequently keep dinner waiting, now no man is more
remarkable for promptness and punctuality. His watch is regulated
daily by the Horse-Guards, and all his invitations are marked, ".SB.
Military-time." To the Ladies he is particularly attentive, shawling
them, and buzzing about them like a bee, rifling sweets from every
flower. He still talks unconsciously when taking a nap in an easy
chair, pfter actively skirmishing with his corps over the Surrey Hills;
but instead of being painful, it is quite pleasant to hear him " Shoulder-
arms—ground-arms—right-about-face—make ready—present—fire I"
are some of the stirring and warlike ejaculations which denote how
completely his heart is in his arms.
In conclusion, we must look at these martial exercises with respect
to their influence on Temperance and Love. 1 cannot believe that
those who have legitimate targets to aim at, will be easily tempted to
make butts of themselves, ana is it feasible that smart young Riflemen,
who are prepared to "pop" at anything, will overlook what is uni-
versally allowed to be the most important object of all?
GENUINE PAPAL INDULGENCES.

nu must know that a letter
from Rome in the Monde,
giving an account of a visit
which the Pope lately made
to Ostia, relates the follow-
ing remarkable fact:—
"After having gone over the
differeut parts of the ancient
town, hia Holiness went to the
Casino of the Company of the
Salt Work a, where refreshments
were preeentod (o him. The
Tope called to him the children
of Madame de Lamoriciike and
tuo Countess Appovw, and,
after asking them aevtrU qucs-
tiona, sent them away laden
with aweetmeata and sugar-
plums."
The picture of the Holy
Father distributing sweet-
meats to children is a pleas-
ing one. It represents him
as being, what personally
he no doubt is, a good-
natured old gentleman.
Ultra - Protestant bigotry
alone would suppose that toffee, hard-bake, almond-rock, sugar-candy,
peppermint-drops, caraway-comfits, Spanish liquorice, and elecampane
were rendered unwholesome by receiving the Papal benediction. Let
his Holiness continue the dispensation of sweetstuff, for there can be
no objection to this kind of indulgences, granted in moderation to
children. Instead of issuing Bulls of Excommunication, he will do
well, henceforth, to content himself with dealing out bulls'-eyes.

THE FUTUEE OF THE FASHIONS.
There was a time when girls wore hoops of steel,
Aud with grey powder used to drug their hair,
Bedaubed their cheeks with rouge: white lead, or meal,
Adding, to simulate complexions fair:
Whereof by contrast to enhance the grace,
Specks of court-plaister decked the female face.
That fashion passed away, and then were worn
Dresses whose skirts came scarce below the knee,
With waists girt round the shoulder-blades, and Scorn
Now pointed at the prior finery,
When here and there some antiquated dame
Still wore it, to afford her juniors game.
Short waists departed; Taste awhile prevailed;
Till ugly Folly's reign returned once more,
And ladies then again went draggle-tailed;
And now they wear hoops abo, as before.
Paint, powder, patches, nasty and absurd,
They'd wear as well, if France but spoke the word.
Young bucks and beauties, ye who now deride
The reasonable dress of other days;
When Time your forms shall have puffed out or dried,
Then on your present portraits youth will gaze,
And say what dowdies, frights, and guys you were,
With their more specious figures to compare.
Think, if you live till you are lean or fat,
Your features blurred, your eyes bedimmed with age.
Your limbs have stiffened; feet grown broad and flat:
You may see other garments all the rage,
Preposterous as even that attire
Which you in full-length mirrors now admire.
A GOOD MAN, NO DOUBT, BUT A BAD SPEAKER.
That our Rifle Volunteers are a gallant set of fellows, nobody who
knows them will veuture to dispute; and that their poetry is some-
times as conspicuous as their gallantry, the reader of this passage
(which we take from a provincial paper, only altering one word in it)
can hardly fail to grant:—
"Mb. Homer Milton Siiakspkare was loudly called upon to respond, and he
auswered to the call with some alacrity. He leturned thanks in a speech containing
many sentiments of gallantry, and concluded by trusting that—
The merry maids and matrons dear
Would quake no more for war.
But look with trust and confidence
Upon the Rifle Corps."
A nervous man, if not a quaker, might quako "for fear of" war, but
to "quake for war" is quite a new expression to us, and it sounds a
little shaky, not to call it. quaky. Perhaps the gallant speaker wished
to Bhow his bravery, that he spoke iu such defiance of the laws of
Lindley Murray; or he doubtless thought to prove himself a mili-
tary man, by venturing on such English as civilians would shrink from.
However this may be, we "look with trust and confidence" that
Volunteers in future will abstain from such queer terms as may expose
them to the charge of having used bad language.

MB. PUNCH AT THE FLORAL HALL.
Everybody knows that the Floral Hall last Tuesday was first used
for floral purposes, in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen and
Mr. Punch; but everybody possibly is not so well aware that on
Thursday Mr. Punch revisited the hall, that, as his friend the Wisconnt
hinted, he might say hall about it when his next number came hout.
Having on the first night an engagement in the ballet (being honoured
with a command to dance attendance on his Sovereign), Mr. Punch
was scarcely able to enjoy the floral banquet which had so daintily
been spread for the Royal eyes to feast upon. A second visit therefore
seemed a national necessity, for whenever a new sight is opened to the
nation, of course the nation wants to hear what its Punch may have to
say of it. Udile, then, ruttici, and give ear too, ye cockneys, and Punch
will tell you how he feasted in the fairy-land of Bow Street, while
Puck and Ariel were playing hide-and-seek among the flower-pots, or
dancing on the slack ropes of roses 'neath the roof.
A flower-show by daylight is a common thing enough, and in these
dismal drenching days when half the visitors arrive in damp spirits and
goloshes, a flower-show or shower-flow is not a merry meeting. But a
flower-show by gaslieht, where the visitors are all in opera costume, is
quite a novel kind of floral feast in England, and Mr. Punch thinks it
quite pardonable to own he felt a glutton at it. He could hardly fail
however to satisfy his appetite; for the pieces de resistance were
pyramids of geraniums twenty feet in height, and these were flanked
with solid entries of hydrangeas and azaleas, on which the greediest eye
might feast until it was quite satiated. But the plat which chiefly
tickled Mr. Punch's visual palate was a sort of a raised pie made of the
choicest of bouquets, whose white papers formed the lightest and the
flakiest of crust. Mr. Punch was so bewitched by this enchanting
structure, that he felt his hump of burglary alarmingly developed, and
having just seen Fra Diavolo, and admired the clever way in which one
Tagliafico Bfppo stole tin: landlord's spoons, it was as much as he
could do to keep from pocketing the pie, which, as it measured ten
yards round, and Mr. Punch had bia dress-coat on, would have been no
easy feat. Mr. Punch, however, would in charity suggest, that when
Mb. Gye again invites the public to a floral feast, he should insist
upon his guests having their nands all tied behind them, and thus help
them to remember a part of the Church Catechism, which Mr. Punch
for once felt tempted to forget.
But for this temptation (which exposed him to the risk of passing
the whole night in Bow Street—not at Mr. Gie's, but at the house
over the way) Mr. Punch might with great confidence advise his
readers—that is, everybody — to get catds for these flower-feasts.
With due precautions to prevent one (to speak in vulgar metaphor)
from pocketing the spoons, such banquets are in every way deliciuusly
enjoyable and delightful to each one of the five senses which are
ravished by them. Taste is thoroughly attended to, as well as smell
and sight: and there is the feeling, too, of pleasure in taking Lovely
I Woman to a place she looks so pretty in. Nor is the sense of hearing
at all less well consulted, although (to throw a sprinkle of cold water
on the Colda'ream) a hand which is so good might play something
better than Uoopdedooien r/oc, which to ears polite, must sound a
little savage after Auber and Rossini.
Husbands who wish, then, to give their dear ones a cheap treat,
cannot well do better than take them to the Floral "Hall of dazzliw
light," when next the Covent Gardeners have it lighted up. IT
summer comes this year (it may, perhaps, by Christmas), a rose-feast
will of course be given in the Hall, and a rose-spread is the best of
flowery blows-out. With the treats that are in store for them, Mr.
Punch then may congratulate his friends, the ladies, generally, that his
friend, Mr. Gte, is now possessed of a good Hall, and he hopes that
Mr. Gte may make many a good haul by it.
The Crank and Oakum Cure.
Pkophet Prince, the Superior of the Agapemone, who gives out
that the Christian dispensation is completed in his person, may be fond
of such exercise as that of playing at hockey, but appears to be averse
to hard labour. There can, however, be very little doubt that six
months of it would be a very good thing fur him.

ANOTHER STORM IN A LIVERPUDDLE.
E understand that the
Four Liverpool Mer-
chants, who made
some sensation last
year by their applica-
tion to the Empehor
op the French for
a revelation of his
real intentions in
regard lo the invasion
of England, have felt
it their duty, in
consequence of the
encouragement they
then received, to make
another inquiry of
his Imperial Majesty.
The incessant decla-
rations of the Spirit
Rappers that they
caused the hand of the
late lamented Napo-
leon to appear to his
Nephew, have excited
so much sensation
that the Four Mer-
chants determined to
ascertain from the
Emperor whether
there were any foun-
dation for the story.
The following is the
letter which they
addressed to his
Majesty from which
it will be seen that
Liverpool gentlemen
were falsely accused
of not understanding French), and appended is the Imperial reply:—

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
I Monday. June 11,1860. The floor of the House of Commons should
to-night have been covered with that dark green carpet which, in the
days when there were Tragedies (and Tragedians to act them), the
composed and sedate play-goer loved to behold. For to-night there
was a stern business in hand. To-night the Lord John Russell,
third and youngest son of the sixth Duke op Bedford by his first
wife, the second daughter of the fourth Viscount Torrikgton, did
immolate his third and youngest Reform Bill upon the altar of Popular
Indifference. To-night did Lord Saturn-Agamemnon-Virginius-
Jephtha-Brutus-Azo-Punch-Russellexecute his own offspring with a
calm stoicism highly to his honour. Lord Punch himself could not have
tossed his baby out of window with a more off-hand readiness. Lord
S.-A.-V-J.-B.-A..-P.-R. stated, first, that he was not going to postpone
his Bill till the Census should have been taken; secondly, that as 250
Members had announced, by division, that they thought the Bill ought
I to be thrown over, Government were bound to consider their views;
thirdly, that there could be no dealing in reasonable time with the
sixty or seventy amendments on the paper; fourthly, that as a Chinese
| war was now certain, the money question must be considered; fifthly,
that the Fortifications business must be taken up; sixthly, that an
extraordinary session, for Reform purposes, did not seem called for by
j the country; and, seventhly, that he should, on all those grounds,
I abstain from proceeding with the Bill. But he added, that at the
earliest opportunity he should introduce another Bill for reducing the
franchise.
1 The crowd did not exactly, as in Parinna,
"In a speechless circle gather
To see the Child tail by the doom of the Father,"
inasmuch as several speeches were made over the body. Mr. Mac-
Kinnon, the Census proposal party, as Member for Rye, appropriately
congratulated Lord John on having again sown his Wild Oats, and
Mr. Disraeli announced his opinion that Ministers had taken a wise
and not an undignified course. He utterly denied that opposition of
any kind had been the death of the Bill, and graciously suggested that
its fate was due to the great mass of public business, of an important
character, which encumbered the Government. He protested, in the
interest of the future, against the coarse and vulgar expedient of
degrading the franchise. And he promised that the Government
should have every aid from the Conservatives in forwarding the really
urgent public business. This was all very elegant and amiable, but
Mr. Bhight could not be expected to stand it. and he begged to
remind Mr. Disraeli that, his own Reform Bill degraded the suffrage
by the addition of 500,000 votes, and the Member for Birmingham
made considerable sport of the statement that the Opposition had not
hindered the Bill. However, he avowed his conviction that in the
present state of feeling in the House nobody could pass a Reform Bill,
and then he fired off a salute of a hundred and one guns in honour of
the Budget and the Treaty. Anybody, who wishes to know what Mr.
Newdegate, Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Griffith, and Lord Fermoy
said, is at perfect liberty to refer to the morning papers of Tuesday.
Mr. BernalOsborne scoffed at Mr. Mackinnon for thinking that
he was the man " who had killed Cock Robin," and was otherwise as
diverting as people often grow upon such occasions. Gondolas are
black, says Lord Byron,

Mr. Horshan was effective, specially pitched into the Whigs, as
really opposed to democratic measures, and fustigated Mr. Bright,
whom he described as all for the master-classes and capitalists, except
in talk. A few other members, of small calibre, followed, amid the
yawns of the House, and if, as the Saturday Review says, the Commons
witnessed the scene of the night like Roman Augurs, some of them
were at once Augurs and Bores. Finally, the Speaker made Proclama-
tion: "The amendment is withdrawn, the motion is withdrawn, and

the Bill is withdrawn," and "a laugh" told Mr. Punch, who was
smoking on the Terrace, and admiring Ma. Page's new bridge, that all
was over. Woeem adyti dignam templo.
Lord Derby, in Another Place, poked some fun at Lord Campbell,
for not attending to the Great Clock at Westminster, and wanted to
know where one of the hands was. He elicited from Lord Camp-
bell the brilliant and soul-stirring epigram that the attempt which
had been made to reform the Clock had succeeded as ill as Reform
in Parliament. Earl Grey protested against the Big Bell being
revived. The subject was renewed in the Commons on Friday, when
Mb. Cowpeb said, that dirt bad got into the Clock, and that he
had taken counsel with the Astronomer-Royal about it., we suppose,
because the Clock is in an Airy situation. Href, the horologe is to
be made all right, and, it may be remarked, apropos of this discussion
in Parliament, that idle people are always making the most fuss
and bother about time. The Wine Houses Bill passed its last stage,
thirty-six Lords voting for it, and two (Dknman and Donoughmore)
against it, so the victory over the Pot-bouse and Pump faction is
complete. Some progress was made in the Commons with Criminal
Law Consolidation, and some other useful matters, and an Irish farce
brought a tragic evening to a pleasant termination. It was .called

Tuesday. An Ossy night in the Lords. The great question now
agitating all stable minds is, whether the system of running horses
with infinitesimal weights, in the shape of young, or stunted jockeys
upon tbem, does not tend to discourage that merit in the breed of
horses, to obtain which is, as everybody knows, the only object of
racing: and to promote which, and for that purpose only, Mr. Punch
and others sacrifice their comfort by attending at Epsom, Ascot, and
Newmarket, eating many lobsters, and drinking much champagne.
The Lords debated the matter with much skill, and Lord Redesdalb,
who was for increasing the weights, was successfully opposed by the
Duke or Beaufort, Lord Winchelsea, and Lord Derby. The
Government were also in favour of light weights, notwithstanding that a
celebrated Light Weight Jockey, from the Bedford training stables, had
just been found unable to ride the famous horse Reform. There were
above 150 Peers present during the racing discussion, but there were
only 31 left to divide, after a subsequent debate on the Benefices Bill,
which vitally concerns the interests of the Church. This remark is
not meant as a reproach; on the contrary, people should meddle only
with what they understand.
In the Commons, Lord Palmerston delivered himself of the
strongest censure upon the King o? Naples, his Government, and the
atrocities of the Royal forces in Sicily, and declared that inasmuch as the
Governments of Rome and Naples were the real and original authors
of the revolts in those countries, to grant the prayers of the tyrants to
remove such authors would be to clear away the Sovereigns themselves.
Mr. Punch immediately sprang to his feet, gave three cheers for Lord
Palmerston, and about seventeen hundred for Garibaldi, and was
carried into the refreshment room slightly exhausted. Sir George
Lewis, on the Census question, said, with a certain sarcasm, that dis-
senting parties had no call to be aggrieved, there would be no penalty
for not stating their religion, and that he did not ask what were people's
religious "opinions," but only their religious "professions." The hit
told, and there was a laugh. A debate, showing up the general debility
of the Admiralty, was followed by a long and really good speech from
Sir Charles Wood, in support of a Bill for enabling the Indian
Secretary to fuse the Indian Army iuto that of the Queen.
Wednesday. The Commons debated a valuable Bill for the regulation
of mines. It is sought to give the children who are employed in mines
a chance of Recreation and Education, but some of the Members in the
mining interest appeared not to think these Necessaries to which
Minors are entitled.
Thursday. Not much in the Lords, except a statement by the Duke
op Newcastle that the settlers ana the natives have come to quarrel
in New Zealand, and that the regular troops and the volunteers having
imitated the example, things might have gone ill but for a gallant sea-
captain called Cracropt, and his men, who made short work with the
tattooed parties.
_ A Navy Reserve Debate in the Commons brought out the declara-
tion from Lord Clarence Paget that, if the country would "wait
patiently," we should find the Navy on a satisfactory footing. Why,
of course ice can wait, if Somebody Else will. Meantime the Articles
of War are to be boiled a little ana made soft,—changed from tobacco-
pipes to maccaroni,—so that they may be the more easily swallowed
by seamen. Lord Clarence also explained a plan for providing for
such old naval officers as were past work. He pathetically remarked
that he could not kill them, and indeed should be sony to do so. but
that the brave old creatures were dreadfully in the way. Sir John
Pakington had another plan, which of course he thought better than
Lord Clarence's. Something must be done, for all the service-rules
in the world will not save a Secretary-at-War from the Tower and the
Block, if he sends an English fleet into battle under an incapable
Admiral. The Dukb op Somerset will be kind enough to make a
memorandum of this fact, and stick it over his looking-glass, so that he
may read it every morning while he is shaving. It may save that shaver
from the National Razor.
Friday. That remarkable Solon, Lord Westmeath, wanted to pass
a Bill for inflicting awful penalties upon people who drive too fast.
As his Lordship is 75, we dare say be finds the crossings awkward,
but any one of those excellent and decorated Commissioners would
put him across for a very small consideration, and this would be abetter
arrangement than legislation in favour of the toes of an Irish peer of
advanced age. The Chancellor, of course, squashed the proposition.
The Speaker's Miscellany for Friday comprised, inter alia, the fol-
lowing interesting articles:—
Shall Irish Paupers be harshly Removed?
Mr. E. Barrt and his late father's Plans, with explanations how he
is to complete them.

Jockeys. After a long and animated discussion, a resolution was
agreed upon for the presentation of a petition to the representative
branch of the Legislature, praying that, as the Lords had given their
consideration to the aristocratic interests of horse-racing, the Commons
would be pleased to direct their attention to the inquiry whether
anything could be done for the improvement of donkey-races.

HOW TO REFORM YOUR MILLINERS' BILLS.
Under the heading of "Crinoline in Church," a correspondent of the Timet expresses,
with much neatness of diction, a desire to "ventilate" a grievance under whicn he is
half-smothered every Sunday. He then mentions the notorious and troublesome circum-
stance that—
•' Ladles will persist In Attending Divine worship in crinoline. Pews hired out to accommodate four persona
will, therefore, now barely contain two."
The abatement of this nuisance might be imagined to be feasible by the simple expedient,
of sitting on the ladies' skirts and making cushions of their exuberant haberdashery. The
continuation of the complainant's statement, however, will show the difficulties which
oppose that process:—
"I myself rent a conplo of seats in our parish church, which I attend regularly with my little daughtor.
The other two are rented hy somo neighbours of mine,—handsomo, wed-dressed, good-natured women,
agniost whom I have nothing to say, save that they attire their persons from the waist downwards in a
sort of steel-ribbed apparatus, like a carriage umbrella inverted, over which acres of silks, and muslins, and
ribbons sre festooned If they arrive before us tbey quite nil the pew, and my girl aud myself are obliged
humbly to ctcep in under their petticoats; it being as much as wc can do to keep our heads abovo crlnoune
during the servico."
The petticoats of mail, which are worn by females, protect them like real armour, and
serve not only for defence, but also for an offensive purpose: inasmuch as, besides annoy-
ing the eye, they are calculated to hurt anybody who may come in contact with them. If
you were to attempt to sit down upon them, the probability is that the steel springs which
they are made of would break and run into you; beware of a steel-clad lady as you would
of a hedgehog, or a porcupine. Moreover, if you are a little man, as the writer in the Times
appears to be, you would not be able to sit down upon the mass of hooped muslin which pushes
us from our stools; you would be on the contrary, like himself and his child, "obliged humbly
to creep in under the petticoats" of. your overdressed neighbours. Nor is it of auy use
to be beforehand with these inconvenient pew-fellowa. Our little friend proceeds to say :—
"If we happen to come beforo them to church they sit down
swaggering and hoisting about their gig umbrellas."
way,
This is very close work; a state of things certainly very much in need of ventilation.
Ladies ought, in pity to victims whom they stifle in this manner, to complete the resem-
blance of their crinolines to diving-bells, by having them furnished with air-pipes, by means
of which the respiration of persons casually overwhelmed by them, might, be Bupporled.
The sufferer who describes himself iu the leading journal as semi-asphyxiated every Sunday
by extensive belief, wishes that they should be charged for their church-accommodation hy
the cubic foot.. That, would only ruin their fathers aud husbands, instead of causing them
to retrench their apparel. He also wants the Clergy to preach against crinolines. The Clergy
will do nothing of the sort. If the fashion which coops a girl up in a great cage, and
gives the lower part of her frame the look and
dimensions of half a balloon, were pretty and
captivating, then, perhaps, the cloth might set
itself against the muslin, but as long as vanity
is repulsive they will let it, alone. There is no-
thing dangerous about, that style of dress hut
the liability to catch fire, and to be caught up
by machinery, and the likelihood of breakage of
the springs inside of it, to the damage of the
wearer and her neighbours. The best cure for
: this inveterate eyesore of excessive pe'ticoats is
one that might he applied hy Magistrates and
Boards of Guardians in rendering crinoline an
element in female convict and workhouse uni-
form. This might bring it into a degree of dis-
credit which it has not as yet contraoted from
the quality of a class of iis wearers who are
more numerous than respectable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"SHALL OUR POOE LITTLE BILL HAVE A STATUE?"
A Proposal is under consideration for the erection of a Monument
to the late lamented Bill of Lord John Russell, which expired at
Westminster, on Monday, the 11th of June, after a lingering and
tedious illness.
The following Noblemen and Gentlemen have kindly consented to
act on the Committee, for considering the design and inscription of the
Monument;—
Lord John Russell, M.P.
Lord Palmerston, M.P.
Lord Derby.
Mr. MacKinnon, M.P.
Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., M.P.
The Hon. Chas. Villiers, M.P
Mr. Horsman, M.P.
Mr. Disraeli, M.P.
Mr. John Bright, M.P.
Mr. Gladstone, M.P.
Sir J. Ferguson, M.P.
Sir E. L. Bulwir Lyttox, M.P.
Mr. Bentinck, M.P.
Mr. Bernal Osborne, M.P.
"VVe have received several suggestions for in memoriam inscriptions,
to be placed over the remains of this ill-starred scion of the House of
Russell. We have pleasure in putting the following at the service of
the Committee:—
"Amendments sore long time I bore;
Parental love was vain*;
Till by degrees the House did please
To put me out of pain."
This strikes us as terse, but slightly deficient in originality. It
reminds us, in fact, of something we have heard before. The same
criticism applies to the composition which follows, intended apparently
to suggest consolation to the afflicted parent:—
"Weep not for me, my parent dear,
You 11 have another Bill next year:
Above my grave write R. 1. P.:
There's room for more small Bills by me."
The following, on the Classical model, should, it is suggested, be
inscribed on a Tablet, to be fixed, like the Italian "Stones of Infamy,"
in the wall of the Lobby of the House of Commons :—
IN FERPETUAM INFAMIjE MEMORIAM
JUXTA HOC MAJtMOR

IN REMPUBL1CAM GRASSATUS

PROJECTUS
S. P. Q. B. LUD1BR1UM
INPAUSTUS INFLERILIS
M0HT1M MER1TAM OBIIT
JUNII III ANTE. ID.
Another Correspondent suggests that the only epitaph applicable to
the poor little deceased is the brief but pregnant one inscribed on the
nameless and dateless tombstone in Worcester Cathedral—
"MISERRIMUS."
The following is not ill-conceived, but the word "flop" is, we fear,
inadmissible on a tombstone:—
"Some told my Pa he went too far,
Some bade him to go further:
'Twixt two stools,-flop, he let me drop,
The fall it was my murther."
Finally, one Tennysonian Correspondent flows over in a whole quire
of short poems, on the In Memoriam model, purporting to be written
in the character of the bereavi d parent of our poor little Bill. We
subjoin a sample from this quiver of poetic shafts, winged, we are
b ound to admit, with the Laureate's pen-feathers :—
"IN MEMORIAM.
I.
"As one, that lacking coin, is fain
To shirk his tradesmen's frequent calls,
And cry along his guarded halls,
'Here is that butcher come again,'
"Or, 1 here that baker, threatening il\ .
With mutterings of the County Court,'
And knows not whither to resort
Tor thinking of each 'Little BilL'
"So I, whom thought of little Bills,
Protested all, with no effects,
Still hanging o'er my bead, dejects,
Sit sad, where Thames its gas distils,
"And wonder, will they yet rise up,
With all their pledges on each head,
To upbraid their father from the dead;
Or, drinking deep from Lethe's cup,
"Forget what in them wakened feud:
The fancy franchises they knew,
The six-pound rental, pleasing few,
And all their clauses rash and rude.
"Oh if, as I still fondly hope.
Next year the 'Little Bill' renew.
Which this year's judgment overthrew,
May it with friends be strong to cope,
"Nor, like the Bill that here doth lie,
After a Session run to waste,
Be in the category placed
Of things that, by amendment, die.
"Last night I sat in Chesham Place;
The rain fell fast, usurping June,
As though the year were out of tune,
And Summer scowled with Winter's face.
"I brooded o'er my discontents,
Saying—'The Notice-paper thins:
Now that with early June begins
The Massacre of Innocents.'
"I had an Innocent—mine own—
Life's flame within my little Bill
Burnt low; I fanned and fed it still,
By June's keen blast to be out blown.
"For this do I rejoice to mark
Each wild vagary of the year:
Rude winds make music to my ear;
Damp and cold water seem a lark.
"A ruder wind was that blew out
My little Bill-y's flickering lamp;
Colder than this June rain the damp
That on him chilling tongues did spout."
"Then on the bell-pull hands I laid,
With thought of hanging, but, in doubt,
I rang and ordered 'Cold without;1
And Hope perched on the glass, and said—
*"If Winter Summer's seat doth fill,
Summer will sit for Winter hoar:
Will bring me new-jear swallows o'er,
And unto thee a second Bill.'"
ONE NATION'S MEAT ANOTHER'S POISON.
The following statement occurs in the Curiosities of Science
familiarly explained in a recent work of great merit, by John Timbs,
F.S.A.:-
"Dr. Daubsny, of Oxford, says: 'Judging from the present state of our know-
lodge, it would rather seem as if poisonous fungi may act as ferments when intro-
duced into the system, and thus set up a series of changes in the vital fluids which
are incompatible with life. This will explain the cii cumstance, otherwise incom-
prehensible, viiy the fame fttngui which operate* a* a poison upon one person does nul
affect another. and why certain nations, as the Russians, either from national want
of susceptibility or from habit, ubo as articles of food several kinds of mushrooms
which are rejected by us as poisonous.'"
People who value their lives should observe that all fungi whatever
in a state of fermentation, that is of putrefaction, themselves, are very
likely to act, as ferments when introduced into the system. Moreover,
common mushrooms will operate as poisons on some people, whilst
they agree perfectly well with others. This property is not peculiar
to mushrooms or any other sort of fungi. Liberty agrees with Britons,
for instance, as well as toadstools do with Russians and other
foreigners that might be named, but it operates as a poison upon those
people whose natural constitution is too inflammable to bear it.

NOTES ON DRESS.
It is astonishing how much an old hat may be improved by rain. It, is a fact that one
which had been nearly three years in wear, having been thoroughly washed in a thunder-
shower, and then carefully wiped, presented, when dry, such a smooth and glossy appearance,
that it was mistaken for new by a little boy.
A black coat which is so old and threadbare that the slovenliest philosopher would
rather not go about, in it by day, will, if only ironed smooth, pass muster with wonderful
success by candle-light in the crowd of an evening party. A dress-coat will last a careful
man through several fashions.
Trousers should be black or blue, or of some other colour as easily matched; for they are
too apt to wear out in the bifurcation, and repeatedly require to be re-established on a new
basis.
Old clothes had better be kept laid up in lavender, of which a few bunches will last many
years.
Waistcoats should always button high. Shirts wear out with washing.
Boots and shoes are, of all articles of attire, the most temporary and fugitive. All holes in
them not only attract the animadversion of beholders, but also sensibly inconvenience the
Wearer. There is a point beyond which their mending cannot be carried consistently with
ease. Patches gall; and upper leathers, although otherwise fit to be soled, often get uncom-
fortably trodden all on one side. You hardly economise in Bluchers by wearing slippers
in-doors; you must walk for the sake of your health; and besides, riding is more expensive
than shoe-leather.
Gloves need be worn only in cold weather. They should be dark.
A sign that a suit of clothes has lasted nearly as long as possible is the circumstance that
when the wearer applies to take his place at a railway-office, the clerk gives him a third-class
ticket.
When beggars cease to importune you, it is time to begin to think about purchasing new

A Reminiscence.
One of Mr. Bright's organs plays to the tune that "the Reform Bill has been destroyed
by the Articles in the Timet." The real fact, of course, is, that Mr. Punch put the unfortu-
nate Bill to death. But were it otherwise, he would be happy to quote from a celebrated
meio-drama, the Babes in the Wood. "Kill him again, Walter. Such a creature can never

Lend, fair Mnemosyne, thy wing,
And waft me back to childhood's days,
So shall thy humble servant sing
The humblest of all nurs'ry lays.

The lot for better or for worse—

From greater dangers I've been saved,

Upon the sofa where I lay.
Shall I recount how Mary Ann
Eloped with her red-coated spark;
Leaving, a prey to every swan,
Her darling charge in James's Tai k P
Or shall I nurse's blunders note,
My precious health which helped to spoil;
When pouring lotions down my throat,
She bathed my limbs in castor-oil?
Nay, let me rather sing of days
When love of letters first took root;
And those who taught, in various ways,
My young ideas how to shoot.
They taught me how the Busy Bee
Delighted much to bark and bite;
And gathering honey all the day,
Consumed it jovially at night.
I learned that bread was made from corn;
How sand and ashes turned to glass i
When kings expired.where queens were born;
Why Magna Charta came to pass.
I learnt the cause of snow and rain,
That bricks were formed of hard-baked clay;
That of six apples four remain,
If two you chance to take away.
And other themes of divers kind,
Of which I don't remember half;
But which the curious may find
In Man gnall's Questions (12mo calf).
Then Fairy.Tales my mind supplied;
I read Tom Thumb, the shocking ruse
riayed on poor Ridinghood, or cried

owakds the close of the
twelfth century the clothes
worn by the clergy were ex-
tremely rich and costly; in-
deed we learn they were as
sumptuous as their wearers
were presumptuous. When
the famous Thomas a Becket
was travelling to Paris, the
"princely splendour of his
habits" so astonished the
French peasants that they
stared at himl as now they
would at our Lord Mayor.
We are told, indeed (although
we don't a bit believe it), that
t hey walked about exclaiming:
"W hat a wonderful personage
the King of England must be,
if his Chancellor is able to
travel in such state!" How
much luggage he took with
him, and what a lot of trunks
and carpet-bags, mitre-boxes,
and portmanteaus were piled
upon his carriage, and hung
behind and underneath it., the

packed up in those receptacles,
for we regret we cannot,say much to instruct him on the point.
All that we can learn is, that the prelate while at Paris was exten-
sively got up; but the accounts of his magnificence are really so
extraordinary, that Lord JLyttleton declares he thinks them quite
incredible; and in a book which is so scrupulously truthful as our own,
it cannot be expected that we should give them place. Some notion
may however be formed of his apparel, when one remembers the old
story of how Kikg Henry had a tussle with him in the open public

crew of lazy, cowardly knights whom I maintain, that will rid mo of this turbulent
priest, wbo Ciime to Court t'othor day on a lame horse, with nothing but his wallet
behind him?" Whether thiB lame horse was tho one that had its tail cutoff, for
which oflcnce A Becket excommunicated somobody, is a question we suggest to
the Government examiners as being quite as civilly serviceable as many they have
best, or worst, to represent it. But only one that we have seen has
ventured to portray the beggar as a crossing-sweeper, and to present
him with the drapery and face of a Hindoo, oecause the tale expressly
speaks of him as influenced by Shiva.
Without attempting further to enter into details, we may state then,
that, towards the end of the twelfth century, the secular, or every-
day, garments of the clergy, were quite as rich and rare as the gems
they often wore. Indeed, not only were they prone to all the pomps
and vanities of dress, but to indulge in them the more, they were often
up to dodges to conceal their cloth. Thus we learn of Prior Aymer, the
swell Cistercian Priest in Ivan/toe, that he had his fingers covered with
rings, and his shoulders with a curiously embroidered cope, and that
"his shaven crown was hidden with a tcurlet cap." While particular,
however, to the fineness of their clothing, they did not pay much heed
to altering the fashion of it. Neither, as we find, did their sacred
vestments vary much from those worn by the priests of the last period
we described; the chief novelty consisting, as a modern writer tells
us, in "the approach of the mitre to the form we are familiar with."
Now, the approach of the Mitre, our readers are aware as well as we
are, is in Fleet Street; and that which people are familiar with we
need not further to describe. For the benefit, of tourists we may,
however, hint, that if they chance to go to Sens, they might see
a Becket's mitre, which is there laid up in lavender, or otherwise
preserved.
It is no great jump to take from clergymen to ladies, for where
the former are the latter are invariably sure to be. Accordingly, refer-
ring, as our wont is, to the very best authorities, we are informed,
that during the last half of the twelfth century the female costume,
like the clerical, was but very little altered from that of the first half.
The chiefly noticeable improvement was that the robe was made with
tight sleeves, terminating at the wrist, and was worn no longer with
those foolishly long cuffs which, we have little doubt, at soiries used
to dip into the tea cups and dangle in the milk. A rich girdle was
worn loosely encircling the waist, and a small reticule, or pouch, was
sometimes worn depending from it, as one may see, on being presented
at the Crystal Palace Court, where the fair Queen Berengaria, like
Patience on her monument, smiles
the stoniest of smiles at those who
go and stare at her. This porte-
monnaie, or pouch, the girls called
an aulmoniere: and they, doubtless,
sometimes rattled it, to make be-
lieve they had all money 'ere, when,
perhaps, its chief contents were a
thimble and a card-case, with, pos-
sibly, some lollipops ana fragments
of Bath-buns.
As a description of a Queen of
Beauty of the period cannot, we
think, fail to interest our readers,
we append a full-length portrait
from a book we have referred to,
which in story and in language is
quite a book of beauties. Accord-
ing to her chronicler, this is how
Roteena, the fair heiress and fair
hairess, was dressed when she came
down to dine with Prior Aymer and
Sir Brian de Bois Ovilberi;—
"Her profuse hair, of a colour between
brown aud flaxen, was arranged in a
fanciful and graceful manner in numerous
ringlets, to form which art hod probably
aided nature. These locks were braided
with gems, and beiug worn at full leogtli,
intimated the noble birth aDd free-born
condition of the maiden. A goldou chaiu,
to which was attached a small roliquary queen berenoaria. from her effiot
of the same metal, hung round her nock. 1N the crystal palace.
She wore bracelets ou her arms, which
were bare. Hor dross was an undergown and kirtle of pale sea green silk, over
which hung a long loose robe which reached to the ground, having very wide
sleeves, which came dowu, however, very little below the elbow. This robe was
crimson, and manufactured out of the very finest wool. A voil of silk interwoven
with goid was attached to the upper part of it, which could be, at the wearer's
pleasure, either drawn over the tiice and bosom, after the Spanish fashion, or
disposed as a sort of drapery round the shoulders."
The lady Botcena very clearly did not dress quite a la mode, or she
would not have worn wide sleeves which, we have said, had then gone
out. But before we blame her for this terrible neglect, we should
remember that she lived in an out-of-the-way place; and as she
enjoyed but Little feminine society, she could rarely have the pleasure
of talking of her toilette, which to many a fine lady is the height of
earthly bliss.

THE SOLDIERS OF SUPERSTITION.
The Roman correspondent of the Morning Post supplies us with the
pleasing intelligence which follows:—
"The Irish Brigado is beginning to be an object of Borne anxiety to the Govern-
ment. ... X have not as yet been able to ascertain the exact strength of the
Irish Brigade at Macerata, but I understand that it will soon amount to 1,000 men.
The anxiety of the Government arises from the discontented spirit already displayed
by these men. It appears that thoy had been given to understand that they were
coming to save the Pope himself and his devoted clergy from sacrilegious persecution
and barbarous martyrdom—a supposition soon dispelled by the thriving appearance
and handsome equipage of the ecclesiastical dignitaries whom tbey hive hitherto
seen at Ancona, Tolentino, aud Macerata. There are also poiuta regarding their
individual comfort which are not at all to the men's satisfaction, Buch as having to
sleep on straw, and to trust to an Incomo of i W a day for the acquisition of such
luxuries as form the solace of a soldier iu garrison."
The first impression of every friend of liberty on hearing that a band
of Irish fanatics had gone to uphold the Papal despotism by the
slaughter of Italian patriots, was a hope that those who did not get
shot or bayonetted would be hanged as murderers and traitors. If
the above account, however, be true, it suggests compassion for the
deluded dupes of sacerdotal deceivers, and a wish that some of them,
at least, will come back again. In that case they will do much good
by telling their friends how regularly they have been sold by their
Priests; and the useful information thus diffused will abate the
mischievous influence of those reverend humbugs.
LETTER FROM LORD MALMESBURY.
Lord Malmesbury's compliments to Mr. Punch, and Lopes he will
let him use his valuable columns to correct his speech which he did not
make, at least the report is wrong, as he did not say that Garibaldi had
bombarded Genoa, but that Genoa was invaded, or at least bombarded,
hv the same man, that is to say that Lord Malmesbury means that
he was in the service of the King of Sardinia, Garibaldi was, (not
that the King and Garibaldi are the same man), and he regrets that
the wrong report should have got into circulation about Garibaldi,
and what he said in the House of Lords was quite different to the
newspapers.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
June 18. Monday, and the rest of the week. Field-Mahshal
thb Honourable Mr. Punch wants to be off to the Volunteer
Review, and cannot spare the time to pick out the very small needles
which may possibly lurk in the Parliamentary Bottle of Hay for the
week.
The House of Lords has thrown out the Bill for the Abolition of
Church Rates, and lays the entire fault upon the House of Commons,
which so completely changed its mind upon the subject as to reduce
its majorities from 70 to 9. So that matter happily stands over to be
a bone of contention for new Sessions. Lord Ray mum's Bill, for
enabling Magistrates to flog Brutes who beat women, has been thrown
out,—after passing a Second Reading,—practical men saying that the
women would not be really benefited by the proposed legislation. The
Police Magistrates think that the "Sixer" is a very effective preventive,
and at all events ought to be tried for a considerable time longer.
Divers Estimates have been proceeded with; and a Bill has been read
a Second Time in the Lords for enabling Prisoners in dock to plead
something else than " Not Guilty," which they do not understand to
be as much a form as " Not at Home," and merely to mean "I want
to be tried, and to take my chance of the fellows in wigs finding me a
loophole." That is about all F.M. Punch has time to write, for his
Carriage is at the door, or else he might perhaps have added some
remarks upon Lord John Russell's mystifications about the Swiss and
Savoy question, upon which that Noble Lord has been taken to severe
task by Sir Robert Peel. But politics will keep, and Reviews will
not; and so no more of Parliament at present from the world's
affectionate friend and obedient Master,

A LUCID EXPLANATION.
In the account of Her Majesty's Levee on the 20th, persons
ignorant of Court customs must have been puzzled by the notice
that—
"Tho day, being the Anniversary of Heb Majesty's Accession, was observed aa

We can fancy Mb. Hodoe in the tap-room of the Chequers opening
his eyes on spelling through this passage, and asking Mr. Hobnail to
explain to him the meaning of it. Whereto Mr. Hobnail, after taking
sundry whiffs to assist his meditation, might be imagined to make
answer, "Why, dang it, Maester Hodoe, I'll tell 'ee what's the

PHONOGRAPHY FOR FRENCHMEN.
We believe that many people have for many ."ears imagined that
English is a language vastly difficult to learn, and that London is a
city vastly hard to get about. How absurd are these impressions, we
have lately in some measure been able to point out: being aided in so
doing by the Guide of the Orphionuiet* a small but greatly useful and
instructive publication, which a talented French author has recently
produced. "Cette petite brochure" has been written "sp6cialement"
for the Three Thousand Orpheonistes who this week have invaded
us; and that it infallibly must prove of vital service to them, the
slightest glance at its contents will amply serve to show. A Guide
whicli teaches that in London there is a place existing called
"Priinerose Spitar;" that Piccadilly "se bifurque, et va rejoindre
Holborn en traversaut la Tamise sous les nonis de Coventry-Street,
Long Acre et Great Queen Street;" that "L'East End est situd
le long de la Tamise et coupe1 par les docks de White Hall;" that
the Old Koyal Exchange, erected after the Great Fire, may be still
seen after crossing over Old London Bridge; that at the Tower "on
y montre encore la chambre de 1'infortune' Chakles lv" who, if
imprisoned there, was probably beheaded at Blackwall, for which the
word "Whitehall" is a misprint in our histories; that among the sights
worth seeing are "le Wauxhall" (still unsold), "la colonne de Water-
loo" (whose site is not described), and "la colonne de Nelson, dans
Belgravee-Square:" a guide-book so instructive, and written by a
Frenchman, tends more to refute the popular delusion that Frenchmen,
as a rule, have perfect ignorance of England, than anything which well
could be devised for that effect.
Of value quite as marked are its directions for attaining a right
knowledge of our language, and for learning how to "spike the Inglis"
like a native, with an ease which has been hitherto to Frenchmen quite
impossible, and an accent which they vainly have endeavoured to
attain. To this end they are furnished with a manual of small talk, in
which the English words are phonographed, or written as they sound,
being spelt with the French letters that their right pronunciation may
be studied by the French. That we may make clear to our readers in
how masterly a manner this new notion is pursued, we think it will
suffice to cite the following few phrases, from the "Manuel Auglais de
• " Vocubulaire ot Guido des Orrbeonistes Francis a Loudrcs, Par A. B. B.

conversation usuelle." As samples of the kind of familiar conversation
which everybody knows is usual among us, their usefulness to foreigners
is too obvious to note:—

These phrases are headed "Prononciation Figuree," but what
sort of a figure the Orpheonistes will cut if they venture to depend on
this "prononciation figuree," we will not be so cruel as to frighten
them by guessing. Our vivid fancy shrinks from picturing the fate
of a believer in the Guide, who, on arriving at "thi Lonndonn-
Briddge railou6 &te»heunn" should say "ids seur," when some friend
asks him, "shel oui teke 6 kebP" and after crying "cotchmenn!
tot eus daoun tou Haide-park," should on reaching Obeun 111" be
somehow made to " unudeurolennd" that his "lodginngs are quouaite
nier;" and thereupon, after inquiring "aou meutch thi dralveP"
should be driven to ask the "draiveur, ouil iou tchennddge mi Mis
benuknot?" The chances are, we fear, that the "frenntch dgenntlll-
menn" would "faiud" himself "som cilveur" short, and would
have to pay not less than "e haf-soverenn" for his "leuggu6dge,"
more especially supposing that he chanced to put the question, "If iou
pliz, seur, ouitch iz thi valiou of Met coinn?"
It will sufficiently he seen from the extracts we have made that the
book we are reviewing is no ordinary work. But many as are its merits,
and much as we have said of them, we have still left uncommended
what is claimed to be their chief. As the Orpheonistes have come to
charm us with their music, in imitation of the deity from whom their
name has been derived, they of course have thought it needful to sing
"God Save the Queen," it being known that there is nothing which so
delights an Englishman as to hear "God Save the Queen" sung to him
by a foreigner. This is evidently felt by the author of the Guxde, who
has taken the utmost pains to smooth away the obstacles which beset the
path of Frenchmen, in singing what he calls the "chant national
anglais;" and having triumphed over them with marvellous success,
he in his preface makes this modest allusion to the fact:—
11 Mais c'est surtout pour la pronunciation du 1 Qod Save the Queen' que la brochure
sera indispcusablo aux Orpheonistes. Les indications preciBes qu'elle contient, lea
exemples de pronunciation qu'elle donne, permettront a tous lea chanteurs de dire,
avec la meme accentuation, l'hymno national de l'Angleterre."
It is not every writer who has sufficient courage to give himself such
praise, however conscious he may be that he thoroughly deserves it.
But as a pi oof of how well merited the praise is in this case, we really
must find room to print the "hymn" in its entirety, and give the first
of the "Conseils relatifs a la pronunciation" which are appended to
explain the proper accent of each word:—
1 God * neve aoueur gresheuss Con inn I
Lonng live aoueur ndbculli Couinn t

* " L'o se prononco comme dans ode, long."
To see our national anthem thus distorted into what looks really
like an extract from the defunct Fonetic Nuz, is a sight which any
Englishman must certainly take pleasure in, and we therefore are
rejoiced that we can spare space to exhibit it. If the singing he one
half as funny as the spelling, it will go far to make "God te've thi
Couinn" a comic song; and as comicalities are rather in our line, we
shall certainly be careful not to miss the chance of hearing it.

STABAT-MATER, SEDEBAT-PATER.
"Sib,
"I was at Mr. Benedict's Concert, at Her Majesty's
Theatre, and an admirable Concert it was,—rich to excess with every
soil of musical attraction that could justify a man in giving up four
hours in the day to having his ears pleased; but that's not the
question now.
"The question is, Mr. Punch, whether you think that, because a
woman comes late to a place of the kind, she has a right to expect a
man who has come early to give up his seat to her? and whether she
is justified in standing near him, like a standing reproach, and every
now and then looking at him as if he were a brute, because he does
not eet up and resign his place P
"Because that is the way many women behave. They, having
nothing to do, can just as well be punctual as not, and if they were
they would get a place; but they come in late, and with a sort of
insolent notion that room is to be made for them, let them come when
they like.
Several women behaved in that way at Mr. Benedict's Concert:
and as I happened to have an end seat, near the Stalls (did I say 1
went into the Pit, and never bestowed Seven- Shillings better?), I was
the butt for a good deal of this sort of thing. Sir, I stood upon prin-
ciple, and sat upon my seat. I would not move, and regarded^ the
singers with fixed attention, turning: adders' ears to mutterings
behind and beside me about 'no notion of Gentlemen permitting
Ladies to stand.' And in the intervals I smiled very blandly (I have
a bland smile, my friends say) upon the insolent and disappointed
females. The Stabat-Mater was excellently sung by Alboni and
Titiens, and I enjoyed myself much.
"Was I not right, Sir? Has a woman a right to use moral force to
turn me out of a place which I paid for and came early to secure P
Unless you say she has. I shall pursue the same line of conduct, and
"I am, Sir, yours obediently,

"P.8. And it's so mean to attack us men. The women'dared not
attack other women. They knew better. There was really plenty of
room for everybody, for Mi. B. issued no more tickets than the place
would hold; but the Crinolines were immoveably obstinate, and con-
temptuously rejected the slightest suggestion to move ever so little
closer. Upon my honour, Mr. Punch, I think women are awfully
selfish."
THE THBEE WISHES.
That variety is charming is proverbially asserted, and must have
been borne in mind by the writer when he penned this curious adver-
tisement, which a Correspondent sends us from a Dublin print:—
WANTED in HARCODRT STREET, by a Barrister who resides in
tbe suburbs, an Unfurnished Drawing-room as an Office. Liberal terms. Also
to Lend, on Mortgage, £13,000, at 4J, or a less sum at 4i, per cent.; to bo firbt
charges on fee-simple estates of ample value. To Sell, a Half-bred Bay Mara, rising
six years old, warranted sound, quiot, and safe. Price moderate. Addross, Ac.
There is somewhat of a tangle in this string of wants, and we may
doubt if many readers will be able to unravel it. That a barrister
should want to make an office of a drawing-room, is possibly in Ireland
a common thing enough; but that a gentleman with £13,000 to lend
should want to get rid of a mare with all the virtues named above
appears, to ordinary minds at least, no ordinary case. Indeed one
can't help fancying, from the "moderate price" asked, that besides
her many virtues, the mare must have some vice. In fact, without,
casting the slightest imputation on the animal, we may be suffered of
this mare to guess that thereby hangs a tale."
FOREIGN FREEDOM FOR IRELAND.
French Pamphleteers are urging the British Government, sympa-
thising as it does with the Sicilians struggling for liberty, to emancipate
Ireland. Let us first, however, be permitted to try the effect ofgiving
Ireland that constitutional licence which the leading nation of Europe
enjoys. Suppose the Lord Lieutenant to be constituted an autocrat,
the Irish Parliamentary representation reduced to a cipher, the Nation
newspaper warned, suspended, and finally suppressed, together with all
the other Irish journals which dare in the remotest manner to censure
the policy of Government, their contumacious editors being all trans-
ported; suppose Dr. Cullen's pastorals prohibited, and the Priests
forbidden to preach political sermons; suppose the whole of the
Emerald Isle subjected to a conscription; fancy, in short, the Irish
tongue, press, and pulpit all well gagged, and the whole Irish people
thoroughly dragooned. Ireland having thus far had her political con-
dition assimilated to that of the Model Empire, is it not possible that
she would be so supremely happy that she would not wish to attain to
any more complete degree of independence of tyrannical England?
DREARY SONG FOR DREARY SUMMER.
Mr. Punch sings with accompaniment of a Pipe and Tobacco.
Well, don't cry, my little tiny boy.
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
Amuse yourself, and break some toy,
For the rain it raineth every day.
Alas, for the grass on papa's estate.
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
He'll have to buy hay at an awful rate,
For the rain it raineth every day.
Mamma, she can't, go out for a drive,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
How cross she gets about four or five,
For the rain it raineth every day.
If T were you, I'd be off to bed,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
Or t he damp will give you a cold in the heail,
For the rain it raineth every day.
A great while ago this song was done,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
And I, for one, cannot, see its fun,
But the Dyces and the Colliers can—they say.

A SENSIBLE STRIKE.
The Times tells us that the town of Sheffield has been'placarded
with a request that the inhabitants generally will "discontinue tbe
consumption of meat until it is reduced to a reasonable price," and
that the workmen of several firms, to the number of 3,000, have pub-
lished their determination to "abstain from the use of butchers' meat
until there is a reasonable reduction in the price of it." This is a
strike to which there can be no objection, but which on the contrary is
highly laudable. It evinces proper ideas of the relation of demand to
supply, and of domestic no less than of political economy. The men
on strike against the butchers will doubtless content themselves with
that legitimate demonstration, and not ruin a good cause by trying to
bully and intimidate their unwise workfellows who are fools enough to
accept imposition and eat extravagant mutton.
Great Success of a New Periodical.
Nothing of the periodical character that has come out in our time
can pretend to a success equal to that which attended the new work
which appeared last, Saturday, entitled "The Volunteer Review." Its
first issue reached close upon 30,000.
An Ornithological Metamorphosis.—If the German Grand Duct
allow themselves to be humbugged by the Emperor or the French,
they will prove th«mselves "grand geese."

ONE OF THE RIGHT SORT.
Grandmamma. "What can you wast, Arthur, to go back to School so particularly on Monday for? I thought you
WERE GOING TO STAY WITH US TILL THE END OP THE WEEK.!"
Arthur. "Why you see, Gban'ma—we are going to elect Officers por our Rifle Corps on Monday, and I don't
LIKE TO BE OUT OP IT!"
CROPPED HEADS FOR CROWNED CRIMINALS.
The following statement relative to the bombardment of Palermo is
official, but it occurs not in a Neapolitan telegram, but in the report of
Kear-Admiral Mundt to the Secretary of the Admiralty. It may
therefore be presumed to be not utterly false but strictly true:—
"The scone Is reported as most horrible. A whole district, 1,000 yards fEngliah)
In length, by 100 wide, is in ashes; families have been burnt alive with tho
buildings; whilst the atrocities of the Royal troops have been frightfuL la other
pnrts, convents, churches, and isolated edifices have been crushed by tho shells,
1,100 of which were thrown into the city from the citadel, and about 200 from tho
ships of war, besides grape, canister, and round shot."
Surely the author of all this murder and arson ought—let us not say
to be hanged, but—to be punished at least as severely as an unhappy
Rush or a poor Palmer. Could not the monarchs of Europe, with
the consent of their subjects, execute justice on offenders of their own
order f A Congress of Sovereigns might hold an assize on a criminal
fellow, who would in that case, so to speak, be tried by his Peers.
The sentence of such a tribunal might sever a crowned head from its
shoulders, if capital punishment were not too barbarous in any case to
be possible. The high Court of Kings could at least consign an atro-
cious tyrant, with his head simply cropped, to a reformatory, where he
might be subjected to the discipline of love and kindness, have tracts
to read, and be visited daily by a clergyman. His head might be
taken; but only in plaster of Paris, for the use of phrenologists, who
would place it in the same class as Green-acre's.
A Priesthood with a Hook.
The Roman Catholic Priests of Ireland boast themselves to be
Fishers of Men. Not content, however, with catching fish, they also
crimp them.
YORK, YOU'RE VERY MUCH WANTED.
Mr. Punch finds the following announcement in a Sheffield paper:—
WANTED, a SUBSTITUTE for the FIRST WEST YORK RIFLES.
A Premium will be given.—Apply at the Printer's.
What does this mean? Are the gallant First West Yorks tired of
volunteering already F We are sorry to hear this. From an account
we had of the appearance of the body, from a friend whom we sent iuto
the North to buy us some real York hams, we have reason to think
there can be no satisfactory Substitute for so fine a set of men. We
don't like their idea of disbanding, and hope they will pocket their
proposed Premium and alter their proposed Policy.
Cure for Bribery and Corruption.
Legalise open bribery. Punish secret bribery with fine and im-
prisonment. Every case of bribery and corruption being a public
transaction, the number of rogues in any constituency will be notorious.
When the rogues become too many for practical purposes, disfranchise
the constituency.
II Millione Fucili.
It is very easy to talk in honour of " Garibaldi and Liberty," but
Mr. Punch taket the Garibaldi and liberty of informing people that their
devotion to the good cause is now to be tried. It is moreover to be tried
by Jewry namely, the Old Jewry, to Number Six wherein, and to the care
of a well-known and excellent Treasurer, Mr. W. H. Ashurst, appointed
by Garibaldi himself, they may send proof pecuniary that they mean
miching mallecho, that is to say mischief, to Bomba. Out with the Browns
if you want to out with the Bourbon.—PUNCH.

THE GREAT REFORMER CONFUCIUS AND THE GREATER REFORMER, MR. PUNCH,
MEET IN THE CATHEDRAL OF PEKIN.

IJNCH. Hail, most illustrious, preposterous, and antibilious philosopher! I forget your honourable and
distinguished Chinese name.
Confucius. My ignoble and contemptible appellation in the vulgar language of this unworthy country
is spelt Koong-foo-tsee, oh, nine times to be venerated and idolised Punch! The intolerable Jesuits converted
it (I entreat your pardon for speaking again on so miserable a matter) into the ridiculous Latin word by which I
am ticketed in literature.
Punch. Odoriferous and beatific Koong-foo-tsee, I trust that your adorable wife and your unap
proachable son are well.
Confucius. Elaborated and interminable Punch, it is fitting that the microscopic details of my insignifi-
cant history should escape your lordly recollection, and that you should not accord in the golden amber of your
celestial mind a place for such undignified flies as my objectionable old woman and my unappreciable brat. Else
you might remember that I turned them both out of my abominable doors, in order that I might be undisturbed
iu my philosophic meditations for the good of China.
Punch. Ah! so you did, most philanthropic, and thereby you transcended myself, who only beat my
wife and threw my baby out of window. But still we are brothers, and I am ecstatic at meeting you in this
place. I hope that the hymns of the West, once more chanted in the Cathedral of Pekin, have not been
offensive to you, Koong-foo-tsee.
Confucius. Nay, most considerate, I rejoice that a war which began in smuggling ends in psalmody.
Punch. None of your scoff's, most analytic. Do you not see that it is to your own teaching that the
Chinese owe any little inconvenience or humiliation they may have sustained?
Confucius. Telescopic and retrospective Punch, may I be eviscerated if I see anything of the kind.
Punch. Thou wert monops inter cacos, K oong-foo-tsee, but I may now remark, that there thou goest
with thine eye out.
Confucius. My object is truth, O Punch, and I would humbly request elucidation of thy proposition.
Punch. Thou didst write a heap of books, Koong-foo-tsee, and thou didst preach a heap of sermons, and
thou didst make some seventy thousand disciples, of whom seventy-two were Stunners and ten were Out-and-Outers.

PREFACE.
[December 29, 1860.
Confucius. My contemptible public history, O Punch, seems at the ends of thy aristocratic fingers.
Punch. No, Sir, I have nothing there but eight Chesterfieldian nails, which I flatter myself are neatly
cut by the affectionate scissors of the partner of my expenses and heart. But I have perused your Life. You
founded a system on which became based the morals and manners of China.
Confucius. All is serene.
Punch. No, Sir, all is not Serene, and what serenity has endured for so many centuries has not been the
repose of virtue, but the stagnation of impotence. You taught passive obedience, the divine right of Kings, and
an outward and artificial morality, which, in combination with your theocratic doctrines, made the Chinaman an
automaton. So he has become vicious and helpless, and we have been obliged to invent Armstrong guns in
order to rectify the defects of your system. Now, you are shut up. Or do you want to argufy?
Confucius. 0, concise and irresistible! I am convincedp I knock my head—theoretically—ninety-nine
times on this pavement, and own myself duller than its thickest stone.
Punch. Enough, Koong-foo*tsee, when a gentleman apologises, no more must be said. And how do
you think we have put together the Chinese Puzzle?
Confucius. Well, O Punch, the war is over, the Chinese will have to pay some -five millions of pounds
sterling, and trade will be thrown open, But I confess that a great deal more is wanting, before it can be said
that the West has done its work for the regeneration of the East.
Punch. Proceed, apostle of the Blue Firmament, which, as you ought to have known, is not blue at all.
Confucius, Can we all be Punches? Let me say that China wants a Teacher,
Punch {colouring deeply), It may be so.
Confucius. A Teacher who can do what I failed in effecting. One who, from the elevated platform of
a magnificent intellect, can survey mankind from the spot on which we stand to Peru, wherever that is—•
Punch. It is in South America, and is situated between 3° 30' and 21° 88' south latitude, 68° 20' and
81° 20' west longitude, you ignorant old bloater.
Confucius. I don't care. A Teacher, I say, who combines the sternest justice with the kindest affection;
Custom, and Faith, and Power who spurneth, from guilt and fear whose heart is free, ardent and pure as day
who burnetii, for cold and dark mortality—
Punch. If you are going to spout Shelley all the afternoon, I shall light a cigar. I always take smoke
with my poetry.
Confucius. You know whom I was endeavouring to describe.
Punch (modestly). Acting up to the precept Gnothi Seauton, I do.
Confucius. Then, do your duty, O Magnanimous, and be the Guide, Philosopher, and Friend of China.
Punch (covered with blushes). My dear Koong-foo-tsee, I will. I am just sending out to the world in
general, and Pekin in particular, my

T17E continue from the preceding volume our summary of
'the Italian strugglo and of other events of the year.
Ferdinand the Second, despite the remonstrance of his
uncle, the Count of Syracuse, resolved to cling to sove-
reignty to the last, but his Ministry resigned, and sought
shelter on board a British man-of-war: his troops deserted him,
shouting" Viva Garibaldi!" In the bitterness of his soul he
exclaimed, " Then I am abandoned by all!" and he determined
to leave his capital, which Garibaldi wa3 rapidly approaching.
He issued a proclamation, in which he declared that he had
not entertained a single thought that was not devoted to the
happiness and good of his subjects, and on the morning of the
6th of September embarked on board a steamer, and sailed to
Gaeta, a strong fortress on the coast, which, with that of
Capua, was all that now remained to him of his dominions.
Two days afterwards Garibaldi entered Naples with a
few of his staff, having reaohed it from Salerno by the railway
train! He came, not at the head of victorious legions with all
the pomp and circumstance of war, but as a first-class pas-
senger in a railway carriage! He had dethroned the Bourbon
dynasty, and marched from Melito to Naples, with hardly the
loss of a single man since the moment when he first set foot on
the Calabrian shore.
Meantime in the Papal States insurrectionary movements
were taking place everywhere. At Tesaro, in the Marches,
and at Montefeltro, Urbino, and other towns, the inhabitants
rose in revolt, and proclaimed Victor-Emmanuel as their
Eing. This happened at the beginning of September.
The Papal Government had made every effort to increase its
army, and recruiting agents had been sent into different
SUMMARY.
countries to prooure volunteers. In Ireland a considerable
number of men were colleoted, who left the island on pretenoe
of being employed as " navvies" or railway labourers, but
the object of their departure was perfectly well known.
General Lamoriciere was appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Pontifical army.
General Lamoriciere met with great difficulties. Want
of money.—£20,000 sent by the Pope to Ancona disappeared
nobody seemed to know how—scarcely any bread could be
obtained for his troops, owing to the oppressive toll which had
been levied by the Government upon the mills. After several
adverse engagements, all more or less important, and in which
the Irish mercenaries were the first to fly, Lamoriciere was
so signally defeated that he abandoned the field accompanied
only by a few horsemen, and succeeded in reaching Anoona,
whilst the remains of his beaten army retired upon Loretto,
where next day they laid down their arms. Ancona was then
compelled to surrender, and with it there fell into the hands
of the conquerors 154 pieces of artillery, among whioh were
two field batteries, with all their equipment of chariots, &c,
and ammunition, 180 horses, 100 oxen, 250,000 nanograms
of flour, 25,000 rations of forage, provisions of all kinds, two
steamers, two trabaccoli (coasting vessels), coal stores, clothing,
arms, and 4,125,000 f.
"Tho fall of Ancona terminated this short campaign," writes General
Fanti, *' but no less glorious for your Majesty's army. In 18 days wo won
tho places of Pesaro, Urbino, Porugia, Spoloto, San Leo, and Ancona. There
fell into our hands 28 field-pieces, 100 pioces of wall-artillery, 20,000 muskets,
more than 500 horses, and from 17,000 to 18,000 prisoners, with all the enemy's
generals."

INTRODUCTION.
factory, and tumults had to be repressed and popular feeling
controlled—not always with the best discretion on the part of
the Diotator. Garibaldi, however, had performed wonders
in the field before the entry of the Piedmontese army into the
Neapolitan territory. On the 1st of October was fought the
Battle of Volturno, when the Royalist troops were commanded
by the King in person. The Volunteers were at first worsted,
but succeeded ultimately, after fighting many hours, in de-
feating the Royalist troops, who retired behind the Volturno,
and into the fortress of Capua. It was computed that the
Royalist force consisted of 30,000 men, while the Volunteers
under Garibaldi did not exceed half that number.
In a few days afterwards the Piedmontese army crossed the
frontier into the Abruzzi, and took the direction of Capua.
The leading columns, under General Cialdini, were attacked
by the Royalist forces on the heights of Macerone, near
Isernia, on the 21st of October; but in less than half an hour
the oontest was decided, and the Neapolitans were completely
defeated, leaving many prisoners in the hands of tho Pied-
montese.
This success of the Sardinian troops was announced by
Garibaldi to the Neapolitans in a proclamation, in whioh he
said:—
"Tho amy of Lamoriciiri has boon defeated by thoeo valiant men. AU
tho provinces, slaves of tho Pope, aro froo. Ancona is ours. Tho valiant
soldiers of the army of the north have passed tho frontier, and aro on the
Neapolitan soil. Shortly we shall havo tho fortune to grasp tho right hands
of the brave."
Garibaldi himself soon afterwards advanced with a body
of Volunteers to meet the Kino, who was marching at the
head of his army upon the line of the Volturno. Their first
interview took place between Teano and Speranzano on tho
26th of October, and a picturesque account of it appeared in
the Journal des Debate, whioh is worth quoting :—
"Seeing tho red shirts, the Kino took a glass, and having recognised
Garibaldi, gave his horso a touch of the spur and galloped to meet him.
At ten pacos distant the officers of tho Kino and those of Garibaldi shouted,
* Viva Victor-Emmaiiud 1' Garibaldi mado another stop In advance, raised
bis cap, and added, in a voico which trembled with emotion, 1 King of Italy 1'
Victor* Emmanuel raisod his hand to his cap, and then stretched out his
hand to Garibaldi, and with equal emotion replied,'I thank you.'"
The liberators, commanded by Victor-Emmanuel in person,
gained another victory at Capua, and the defeated Royalists
retreated in haste to Gaeta, excepting a portion who crossed
the frontier close to Terracina, into the Papal territory. Gaeta
would have soon followed had it been attacked by sea, but
this the Sardinians were not allowed to do, as the Emi>eeor
of the French interfered to allow, he said, the King of
Naples a chance of escape, or to mako an honourable capitu-
lation, and so save his Majesty from becoming the prisoner of
the King of Sardinia, the consequence being that Gaeta
was only invested on the land side, and a tedious siege com-
menced, whioh lasted to the end of the year, causing much
useless bloodshed. Within a certain radius of the Eternal
City the Piedmontese were compelled to halt, and General
Guton was restored to his command of the Frenoh troops in
Rome.
'At the beginning of November the people elected Victor-
Emmanuel as their constitutional King. The votes being
1,302,064 in the affirmative and 10,312 in the negative.
On the 7th Victor-Emmanuel made his entry into Naples,
and immediately issued a proclamation, in which he said:—
"The results of tho voto by universal suffrago give me the sovereign power
ovor those noblo provinces. I accent this now award of the national will,
moved not by any monarchic ambition, but by conscientious feelings as an
r.\cz
Italian. Tho duties of all Italians aro augmented. Sincore concord and
constant self-denial are more than ever necessary. All parties must bow
beforo the majesty of the Italian nation, which God uplifts. Wo must here
inaugurate a Government which may give security of free existence to the
peoplo and of severe roctitudo to public opinion. . . . ."
He immediately visited the Cathedral; and the multitude
had the satisfaction of finding that their patron saint, St.
Januarius, was not displeased at recent events, for his blood
liquefied in the usual orthodox manner.
Garibaldi did not remain in the territory which he had
added to the Crown of Sardinia. Ho quitted Naples for the
Island of Caprera on tho 9th of November, two days after
Victor-Emmanuel entered it. The exact cause of this
abrupt departure is not yet known. The King, however, was
lavish in his offer of honours and emoluments to the horo, to
whom he owed so much; but Garibaldi was inflexible in his
refusal to accept them; and he withdrew to Caprera, after
distributing medals to his soldiers and issuing a last proclama-
tion, addressed to his former comrades, in whioh he said :—
"Providence has given Victor-Emmanuel to Italy. Every Italian should
bind himself to him. All should gather close around him. By the side of
tho 'Re galantuomn' every strife should disappear, every rancour be dissi-
pated. Once again I repeat my cry to you—To arms, all t all I If the month
of March, 1661, does not find a million of Italians under arms, alas fur liberty 1
alas fur Italian existence 1 Oh, no 1 away with a thought which I loathe as
poison. March, 1861, and February, if necessary, will find us all at our
post Italians of Calatafimi, of Palermo, of the Volturno, of Ancona, of
Castelfidardo, and of Iscraia, and with us every man of this land who la
neither servllo nor a coward—all, ono and all—gathered closely round tho
hero of Palostro, we will glvo the last shock, the last blow to the crumbling
tyranny."
The record of the after career of the noble, unselfish patriot
must be reserved for its place in future volumes.
The affairs of Italy were continually under disoussion in
Parliament during the Session of 1860. M. Persiont had
positively denied any intention on the part of the Emperor of
the French to annex Savoy and Nice, but the demand was
made early in the year as a compensation to France for per-
mitting Central Italy to be united to Piedmont, and the
pretext made use of by Franoe to justify suoh an arrangement
will bo found expressed in the following extract from a des-
patch addressed to II. Thouvenel, the French Minister for
Foreign Affairs, to Baron de Talleyrand, the French Am-
bassador at Turin, on the 24th of February this year:—
"Historical traditions, which it is needless to recall, havo accredited the
idea that the formation of a moro powerful state at the foot of the Alps
would be unfavourable to our interests, and although, in the arrangement
developed in this despatch, the annexation of all the States of Central Italy
to Sardinia should not be complete, it is certain that In the point of view of
external relations it would be equivalent in reality to an analogous result.
The same provisions, however distinct they may be, claim tho same guaran-
tees; and tho possession of Savoy and of tho county of Nice, excepting the
interests of Switzerland, which wo always desiro to tako into account, also
prosonts itself to us in that hypothesis as a geographical necessity for the
safety of our frontiers."
This was evidently a demand of the strong upon the weak,
and Europe felt indignant at having been duped by the pro-
fessed disinterestedness of the French Emperor, who had
declared again and again that he had made war for "an
idea." Mr. Punch never believed the assertion. Frenoh
emissaries were sent into Savoy and Nice, who contrived to
"make safe" an appeal to universal suffrago for the transfer
of the allegiance of tho population to France. Count Cavour
wrote to M. Thouvenel thus :—
«' Wo foci too deeply what Italy owes to tho Emperor not to pay the most
serious attention to a demand basod on tho principle of respect for the
wishes of tho inhabitants. His Majesty's Government would never consent,
with even the greatest prospective advantages, to cede or exchange any one
of tho parts of tho territory which has formed for so many ages tho glorious
inheritance of the House of Savoy. But tho King's Government cannot
rofuso taking into consideration tho changes which passing ovonts in Italy

INTRODUCTION.
[July to December, 1800.
may have Introduced Into the situation of the inhabitants of Savoy and Nice.
At the moment when we are loudly demanding for tho inhabitants of Cen-
tral Italy tho right of disposing of their destiny, we cannot, without incur-
ring the charge of inconsistency and injustice, refuse to tho King's subjects
dwelling on the other side of tho Alps tho right of freely manifesting their
will However poignant the regret we should feel If the provinces, once the
glorious cradle of the monarchy, could decide on demanding their separa-
tion from the rest of the King's dominions, in order to join other destinies,
we should not rofuse to acknowledge tho validity of this manifestation,
declared legally and conformably with the prescriptions of Parliament."
The Swiss Government strongly opposed the annexation of
Savoy, but forgetful or unmindful of the interests of the
country which had sheltered him in exile, the Emperor of
tub French persevered in his scheme of aggrandisement,
and the appeal to universal suffrage took place, tho result in
Savoy being 130,533 votes given in favour of annexation to
Franco against 253, and in Nice 25,743 for annexation
ogainst 160.
On the 25th of July the French Emperor, conscious of
the uneasiness felt in England on account of the policy and
conduct of France, addressed a remarkable letter to Count
Pxrsignt, the Frenoh Ambassador in this country, which is
of sufficient interest to be quoted in extenso, "Whether the
explanations given were satisfactory or not, it is impossible
not to be struck with the air of frankness and sincerity which
pervades it; and such a familiar epistle from a crowned head,
in defenoe of his Government, has, at least, the merit of
novelty.
"8t. Cloud, 25th July, 1860.
"My dear Pirsiony,—Affairs appear to me to be so complicated—thanks
to the mistrust excited- everywhere since tho war in Italy—that I write to
you, In the hope that a conversation, in perfect frankness, with Lord
Paucek&ton, will remedy the existing evil. Loud Falmerston knows me;
and when I affirm a thing he will beliove me. Well, you can tell him from
me, in the most explicit manner, that since the peace of Yillafranca, I have
bad but one thought, one object—to inaugurate a new era of peace, and to
live on the best terms with all my neighbours, and especially with England
I had renounced Savoy and Nice; the extraordinary additions to Piedmont
alone caused me to resume the desire to see i e-united to France provinces
essentially French. But it will be objected, 1 You wish for peace, and you
increase immoderately tho military forces of France*' I deny the fact in
every sense. My army and my fleet have in them nothing of a threatening
character. My steam navy is even far from being adequate to our require-
ments, and the number df steamers does not nearly equal that of sailing
ships deemed necessary in the time of Kino Louis Philippe. I have 400,000
men under arms; but deduct from this amount 60,000 in Algeria, 6,000 at
Borne, 8,000 in China, 20,000 gendarmes, the sick, and tho new conscripts,
and you will see—what is the truth—that my regiments are of smaller
effective strength than during the preceding reign. The only addition to the
Army List has been made by the creation of the Imperial Guard. Moreover,
while wishing for peace, I desire also to organise tho forces of the country
on the best possible footing; for, if foreigners have only seen the bright side
of the last war, I myself, close at hand, have witnessed the defects, and I
wish to remedy them. Having said thus much, I have, since Yillafranca,
neither done, nor even thought, anything which could alarm any one. When
Lavalxtte started for Constantinople, the instructions which I gave him
were confined to this—' Use every effort to maintain tho ttatut quo; the
interest of France is that Turkey should livo as long as possible.'
"Now, then, occur the massacres in Syria; and it is asserted, that I am
vory glad to find a new occasion of making a little war, or of playing a new
part. Really, people givo mo credit for very littlo common sense. If I
instantly proposed an expedition, it was because my feelings were those of
tho pcoplo which has put me at its head, and the intelligence from Syria
transported mo with Indignation. My first thought, nevertheless, was to
come to an understanding with England. What other interest fhan that of
humanity could induce me to soud troops into that country? Could it bo
that the possession of it would increase my strength? Can I conceal from
myself that Algeria, notwithstanding its future advantages, is a source of
weakness to France, which for thirty years has devoted to it tho purest el
Its blood and its gold? I said it in 1852 at Bordeaux, and my opinion is still
the same—I have great conquests to make, but only in France. Hor interior
organisation, her moral development, the increase of her resources, have
still immense progress to make. There a field exists vast enough for my
ambition, and sufficient to satisfy it.
"It was difficult for me to come to an understanding with England on the
subject of Central Italy, becauso I was bound by tho peace of Villafi;mca.
As to Southern Italy, I am free from engagements, and I ask no better than
a concert with England on this point, as on others; but, in Heaven's name,
let tho eminent men who aro placed at the head of tho English Government
lay aside potty jealousies and unjust mistrusts.
"Let us understand one another in good faith, like honest men as wo are,

11 To sum up, this is my innermost thought I desire that Italy should
obtain pc.ice, no matter how, but without foreign Intervention, and that my
troops should be able to quit Rome without compromising the security of tho
Pope. I could very much wish not to be obliged to undertake tho Syrian
expedition, and, in any case, not to undertake it alone ; firstly, because it
will bo a great expense ; and secondly, because I fear that this intervention
may involve the Eastern question; but, on the other hand, I do not seo how
to resist public opinlou in my country, which will never understand that wo
can leave unpunished, not only the massacre of Christians, but the burning
of our consulates, tho insult to our flag, and tho pillage of the monastciics
which wero under our protection.

Before the closo of the year tho Chinese difficulties were
at an end, though not until great barbarities had been
inflicted on our countrymen, twenty-six British subjects
having been seized and thirteen only restored alive, all of
whom bore on their persons evidence of the indignities and
ill-treatment which they had suffered. Thirteen of our people
had been barbarously murdored, amongst whom were Messrs.
De Norman and Bowlby (the Times correspondent). Cap-
tain Brabazon, Lieutenant Anderson, and an English
dragoon were treated with such cruelty that they perished;
and Mr. Parkks, the Government interpreter, and Mr. Loch
(Lord Elgin's secretary) were subjected to imprisonment,
torture, and indignity, but fortunately escaped with their
lives. Lord Elgin refused to negotiate until tho prisoners
were restored; and, as tho Chinese authorities hesitated to
comply with his demand, the Allied Army marched upon
Pekin, and the Summer Palace of the Emperor of China was
taken and demolished. A convention was signed immediately
afterwards, on the 24th of October; and a sum of 300,000 taels
was especially appropriated for those who had suffered, and for
the families of the murdered men.

4 The Volunteer Review.—On June 23, 1860, the great
Volunteer Review took place in Hyde Park before Her
Majesty. This impressive speotaele passed off without the
least disaster or confusion, although over 20,000 volunteers
were under arms, and the conoourse of spectators was immense.
A brief statement of the programme will give the names of
tho superior officers to whom so muoh of the completeness
and order of the review are due. The Volunteer army was
arranged in two divisions, eaoh of four brigades, each brigade
comprising four battalions. The first division was under the
command of Lieut.-Gen. Sir F. Love, K.C.B. The few
mounted rifle corps and the artillery were ranged in this
division. The Artillery Brigade was commanded by Colonel
Tulloch; the First Brigade by His Grace the Duke of
Wellington; the Second Brigade by Lieut.-Col. Hrcss;
the Third Brigade by Lord Ranelaoh; the Fourth Brigade
by Lord Elcho. The Second Division was under the oom-
mand of Major-Gen, Lord Rokedv,. K.C.B.; the First
Brigade was commanded by Col. Thokold; the Second Bri-
gade by Col. the Madquis of Donegal, G.C.H.; the Third
Brigade by Brig.-Gen. Russell, C.B.; tho Fourth Brigade

ously assembled, and entirely at their own charges, about
15,000 belonged to metropolitan corps and 6,000 to the pro-
vinces. Some of the corps mustered very strong. Woolwich
sent no fewer than 1,800 men; Manchester, near 2,000; tho
City of London, 1,800. The special corps of tho barristers
(The Inns of Court, or 23rd Middlesex) mustered 450 strong.

39 Effects of the Eclipse.—The Eclipse of the Sun occurred
at lh. 38m. 34s. p.m., on tho 18th of July, 1860, and con-
tinued until about half-past three; and throughout the whole
adumbration the diso of the sun could be gazed on without

followed suit, December 16, I860, but in favour of Englishmen
only. M. Persigny's circular to the French Prefets is worthy
preservation in these pages:—

Eugenie had suffered so much from sorrow for the death of
her sister, the Duchess of Alba, that some total relaxation
from Court state and complete change of scene were recom-
mended. Her Majesty, with the promptitude that distin-
guished her earlier days, decided on a visit, of the most
unceremonious character, to England and Scotland. Her
Majesty therefore crossed the Channel on tho 21st, in the
ordinary packet-boat, attended by the Marquess of La
Grange and two ladies in waiting, and took first-olass tickets
for London. Arrived at London Bridge, the party engaged
tho ordinary street-cabs, and drove to Clarxdge's hotel,
where they were fortunate enough to find apartments disen-
gaged. So privately had the whole journey been managed,
that Her Majesty had been some time at the hotel before her
rank -was known. The Empress, on the following day, paid
a visit to the Crystal Palace, and then went by railway to
Edinburgh. After a rapid tour through Scotland on the 4th
of December, tho Empress was received by Her Majesty at
Windsor Castle, and arrived in London on the same day.
The Empress returned to Paris on the 13th, greatly improved
in health.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE
"NOVEMBER—no, June (at least the Almanack says so) the 25th,
Monday. Lord Stratheden, the son of the Lord Chancellor,
made his maiden display as a Peer, and with success, filially beating the
Government of which his Governor is a member. There is a place on
the east coast of Africa called Mozambique. There is a place on the
south-west of Europe called Portugal. The former is a station belong-
ing to the latter. The Slave-trade is largely favoured, despite profes-
sions to the contrary, by Portugal. Lord Stratheden thinks that if
England keeps a Consul at Mozambique, he could keep an eye on the
slavemongers, and in some sort shame the Portuguese into pretending
i to be a little more earnest in repressing the traffic. ■ The young Lord
wisely brought down two big guns to fire upon the Government, and
Dr. Wilbereorce and Lord Brougham both blazed away with great
effect, the latter taking the opportunity of laying into the Americans
for their treatment of the Negro. Somerset snapped and Granville
grumbled, but Stratheden was stubborn, and on division Her
, Majesty's Government were defeated by 11 to 6, and an address for
a Consul was decreed. "Weel done, my bairnie," murmured the
, Chancellor. "I '11 say ye 're nae just sic a Sumph as the unrighteous
bae ca'd ye."
In the Commons there was a Scene. The Bankruptcy Bill, the
great measure of the year, was placed in imminent peril, and [Mr. Punch
must say) unwisely, oy a sudden fit of imaginary justice with which
divers Members were seized. The bankruptcy system has always been
j a blunder, and the last legislation for amending it made it horribly
worse, so much so that the Mercantile World contemns and neglects
the Court. Sir Richard Bethell, laudably desirous to cleanse the
Augean stable, proposes to turn a stream of some six hundred clauses
of new law into it, and among the arrangements of our legal Hercules,
there is a provision for relieving the fund contributed by the
estates of unfortunate bankrupts from certain compensations, rendered
necessary by the absurdities of former legislation. It certainly seems
hard that the country should throw on the suitors the costs of mistakes
made by the country's own representatives. And considering that the
sum itself is but about £20,000, and is yearly diminished, it was not
much to make a fuss about. But Sir Henry Willoughbt and some
others made fight, and with some claptraps about the hardship of
taxing the people for a Court they do not use (what do the Conser-
vatives say when the same argument is employed about the Church of
England in Ireland ?) they managed on division to reject this part of
vol. xxxix.
OF PARLIAMENT.
the plan by 111 to 98. Ma. Malin*, a leading Conservative, told his
friends they had been voting in perfect ignorance of the subject; a
polite remark seconded by Ma. Bright wit h the intimation that they
did so upon many other occasions. Sir Hercules Bethell then
declared that he would not go on with a scheme that had been thus
mutilated. This made a great sensation, and finally he was prevailed
upon to say that he would give the House another chance. The
debate was to have been resumed at the end of the week, but the
beestly weather has produced the same effect upon the Attornet-
General as upon most other people, and he is ill. The Solicitor-
General, however, stated on Friday, that the measure is to be
proceeded with.
A Game Certificate measure was agreed to, on the distinct under-
standing that it was to afford no new protection to Rabbits, against
which class of our fellow-creatures several Members spoke very
bitterly. The Church Property Bill had been much opposed, but on
Lord John Russell (whose family is an authority on the question of
Church Property) explaining that it was not at all confiscatory, it was
read a Second time.
Tuesday. The new and able Archbishop of York, Da. Longlet,
came out in the House of Peers in his elevated capacity, but on a
subject connected with his old diocese, and the application of eccle-
siastical tin to local purposes. Many Lords talked, and the Archbishop
carried the Second Reading of his Bill, which is a just one.
Ireland had the Pull in the Commons to-day. the morning sitting
being chiefly occupied with an Irish Landlord ana Tenant Bill, and the
evening opening with a much more interesting affair—namely, a per-
sonal debate. Mr. Conollt, Conservative, delivered a great Philippic
against Lord Carlisle, Lord Lieutenant, declaring that he was a very
bad Viceroy, and made very objectionable appointments. One great
crime of Lord Carlisle's, in the estimation of his enemies, is his
having made a Ma. Ltle Lord Lieutenant of Londonderry. Ma.
Ltle is a Master in Chancery, and in every way a suitable man for the
appointment; but he was so obnoxious to the vulgar Irish Squires,'
that, when he presented himself as the representative of the Queen,
none of the Grand Jury rose to receive him. The idea of paying any j
attention to the opinion of men who knew no better than to msult
their Sovereign, through her officer, is too preposteious to occur to I
anybody but an Irish partisan. There was a good deal of scoffing at |
Lord Carlisle by other speakers, and Colonel French abused him

for "inaugurating a Turkish bath, entertaining at dinner a troop of
theatrical performers, and a horse-tamer at breakfast, and attending the
opening a shop in Grafton Street, where he drank a glass of cham-
pagne and made a speech to the assembled shopkeepers and astonished
cabmen." Mr. Gregory made a spirited and convincing defence of
the Lyle appointment'., and Lord Palmerston' and Mr. Hoksman
spoke up warmly for their friend Lord Carlisle. Of the legions of
incidental matters dragged into such a debate Mr. Punch would despair
to treat, unless he published a double supplement and an appendix:
but on the whole Lord Carlisle came off very well. A case of local
distress in Ireland next came on, but Mr. Pops Hbnnessy could not
show that there was any reason for Imperial interference.
The Monster, Mr. Sidney Herbert, then introduced a valuable
Bill for Improving the Militia Laws. The Militia are not to be
seduced into the regular Army, and the object is to make them a
separate and reserve force, to be embodied only in case of emergency.
The Monster made an admirable speech, and his proposals were
received with merited applause.
Wednesday. The Bill for relieving the poor creatures engaged in
Bleaching and Dyeing Works was considered in Committee, and very
much hindered by those who, as Mr. Edwin James told them, thought
that children were sent into the world for nothing else but to be used
up in manufactures. But very large majorities were ranged on the
side of humanity.
Thursday. A singular act of homage was paid to the House of
Lords. Their Lordships were sitting in the morning in Appeal, when
some poor Indian, whose untutored mind was utterly overpowered by
the spectacle of so much wisdom and gravity, set up a yell, and, pul-
ling out a knife, proceeded to offer himself up as a sacrifice to the
Idols of the Nation. However, the operation was prevented, and the
votary, being removed to a neighbouring hospital, was found to have
done himself no particular harm by his preliminary to a Happy Dis-
patch. In the evening their Lordships talked about Breakwaters, and
decided that nobody kuew anything at all upon the subject.
The Commons were occupied all the evening with a debate upon the
important Indian Army Fusion Bill. Among the statements that were
made was an astounding one to the effect that the Officers of the Line
and of the Local Service being called as witnesses on the question of
fusion, the former all testified one way, and the latter the other. Here-
upon Mr. Punch would like to tell a little true story. There was a
collision case to be heard before the Court which sits in London to
settle when ships are justified in running down one another. A certain
sailor's evidence was wanted. He was at Dover, so it was resolved to
send down an affidavit, which Jack could make there. The London
official who had to prepare the affidavit was not sure as to which side
Jack's evidence was to favour, and therefore to save time and trouble
he prepared and sent Two forms of affidavit, directing that the sailor
should be sworn to the one which he believed consistent with truth.
Of course they were in direct contradiction, one saying that the wind
was S.S.W. and the smashed vessel going in one direction, and the
other that it was N.N.E., and that she was steering in the other. The
affidavits were duly returned by the Dover agent, who wrote, "You
did not make it clear which you wanted, so I have sworn him to both,
and you can use which you like." It is a very sad thing that
sailors should be so heedless, but of course the story has no other
application. The debate was adjourned, after a vain struggle by Lord
Palmerston to prevent that, course, so Pam said it would be a shame
to keep the Speaker up while they squabbled.
Friday. In the Lords there was another exposure of the conduct of
the Admiralty. Somebody said in society the other day, "Don't he
uncharitable. Everybody has got something good about him, except
my brother Bob." The country will soon learn to say that every
Body has something good about it except the Board of Admiralty.
Its behaviour in re Trotman's Anchor was the charge to-night, and
Lord Hardwicke put himself in a very proper rage with the
Government.
In the Commons, Mr. Walpole brought up the Report of the
Select Committee, appointed as Buffer to prevent collision between
the Lords and Commons ou the Paper Duty question. It was ordered
to be piinted for consideration. Of course Parliament has to wait for
its typography, but the newspapers have the thing at once, and Mr.
Punch is able to state that the Report mentions a variety of cases that
have no bearing on the present difficulty, and a few that have some
affinity with it. It recommends nothing, and there will be a good
debate on the subject, especially as Lord John Russell and Mr.
Gladstone join Mr. Bright in his view that the Bull-dog ought to be
set upon the Mastiff.
Sir G. C. Lewis made a lame apology for the conduct of the police
in not chastising the ruffians who hunt the choristers and other
tools of the Puseyite fouls at St. George's-in-the-East. There was
another Irish debate about an alleged act of Lord Leitriu, who is
said to have seized a Roman Catholic chapel on his estate in that
county, and thereby provoked a riot. A good deal of very liberal
and proper sentiment was expressed about the duty of landlords, of
any oreed, to afford tenants, of any creed, the means of performing
worship in their own way. But Ireland is a curious place. A Catholic
and a Protestant gentleman, over their Lafitte at the Club, will, of
course, express themselves most tolerantly and affably as to the above
duty; and if a Mohammedan gentleman happened to draw up his chair
to theirs, while he took his iced sherbet, the three gentlemen would be
all agreed upon the propriety of perfect liberality. The Mohammedan
gentleman might probably carry out his view, he not being so far
advanced in civilisation as to let his priests and his women dictate to
him. But when the other two got back to Ireland, and proceeded to
act up to their professions, and the Catholic talked of giving a site for
a Protestant church, and the Protestant mentioned that he should
build a Catholic chapel, what a Burst there would be from Priests,
Women, and Families! Those only who do not know what are the
sentiments and powers of dogged Popish pastors and perspiring Evan-
gelical pastors in Ireland, will be disposed to abuse the poor tolerant
gentlemen for not fulfilling the vows made over the libation of
Lafitte. So saith Mr. Punch, Tolerator yet Legislator-General to the
Universe.

The boys of Palermo are naturally amusing themselves by disfiguring
and demolishing the statues of t he Bourbon Kings. According to the
Special Correspondent of the Times;—
"One. bolder than the others, climbed up with a provision of charcoal and
blockenod the faces, exciting no small hilarity among the idlers and proinenadera."
This was a satirical young wag. In giving the marble visages of the
Bourbons the semblance of ebony, he evidently meant to signify the
perjury by which those tyrants have rendered themselves infamous iu
breaking faith with their subjects, and to express their characteristic
readiness, in taking an oath, for instance, to maintain a constitution,
to swear till they are black in the face.

Mr. Irwin, who brought the successful action against the Member

the latter to Swells, announces his own belief that his education in
mechanics must have been sadly neglected. He thought he was going
to use a Lever, but found he had got bold of a Screw. The remark is
an impolite one, and though Mr. Punch professes no violent admira-
tion for an M.P. who (according to Dod), "will support any Ministry
that will make Galway a Packet Station," Mr. P. will not be sorry
should Mk. Irwin's theory of motive power be modiGed after a motion
for a new trial. We don't like the Touting System, especially when
applied to public objects—as the Wiscount says "Tout le contraire."

THE FEMALE ORPHAN'S FRIEND AND ADVISER.
rn Adonis Cr<esus
Crichton begs to inform
friendless orphans of the
softer sex that he is no
longer open to receive
t heir matrimonial tenders.
Out of about a thousand
applicants who answered
his advertisement as soon
as it appeared, he has
thrown the handkerchief
to the most beautiful and
most worthy. He sin-
cerely hopes that all the
fair competitors for the
possessiouof his hand and
t he partnership of his opu-
lence, may find husbands
as rich as himself, and
almost equally handsome,
intelligent, virtuous, and
kind, who will make them
as happy as he makes
Lady C. That fortunate
lady, who had lately no
relations whatever, has
now the equivalent of any
number centered in him-
self. Sir A. C. C. would
advise his interesting cor-
respondents to advertise
their peculiar recom-
mendation to the notice of judicious marrying men. Delicacy need not be in the least
compromised, because the advertisement may ostensibly describe the candidate as wanting
any ordinary situation or employment. All that is necessary is an opportunity of announcing
that there exists a certain marriageable young person who will not entail a mother-in-law
upon the gentleman who »ay espouse her, or bring him any immediate addition to the
members of his family.

AN ANSWER TO IMPERTINENCE.
That Clause in the Census Bill which provides
for a return of religious professions has called
forth a good deal of opposition. The system of
asking impertinent questions has been already
carried by Government to an insufferable extent,
and must be checked. "How much have you
got a yearf" seems the height of impertinence,
but "What's your religiou?" is a higher flight
still. It exceeds the audacity of any clown in
the most outrageous pantomime. We are crying
out upon Puseyism and Popery, whilst a Con-
fessional and an Inquisition are growing up in
our midst. Walker will probably be the de-
nomination under which persons who like to
keep their doctrinal opinions in their own
breasts will for the most part be disposed to
return themselves. They may, however, do
better than that. Let everybody who desires to
resist the attempt which ignorant fanatics are
making to destroy the Christian liberty of the
subject by compelling him to observe a pseudo-
Jewish Sabbath, return himself as an Excur-
sionist, in order to signify that he is at any rate
not a Sabbatarian.
France and Naples.
M. Prevost Paradol is fined and im-
prisoned for writing an abstract political pam-
phlet reflecting on tyranny. Sicilian political
offenders are crucified. The French have some
reason to be content under an absolute govern-
ment; they might be worse off.
A Planetary Pervert.—In consequence of
the long-continued cloudy sky, which hides all
the stars, a report has got about that Venus has
actually taken the veil.
A FABLE FOR SMALL GERMANS.
My lit-tle dears, there was once a French Wolf—very grey, and
greedy, and lean, and sly. Near the wood in which he lived grazed a
large flock of sheep, in the charge of a great many small dogs, who were
al-ways snarl-ing and bit-ing, and quar-rel-ling a-mong them-selves.
The old Wolf knew that he was more than a match for any of the
dogs sin-gly, but he was a-fraid if he Yen-tur-ed to at-tack one of them,
the o-thers might for-get their snarl-ing to join in a league of de-fence
a-gainst him. There was one large dog in par-ti-cu-lar, cal-Ied "Prince,"
who had long war-ned the rest of the pack of the com-mon dan-ger to
all from the old Wolf, and had done his best to make them a-gree
bet-ter; "for so sure," said he, "as the Wolf snc-ceeds in keep-ing us
at log-ger-heads, he will take us, one by one, with out dif-fi-cul-ty, and
when he has eat-en us up, he will have his own way with the sheep."
But they would not mind his words, and some of them growl-ed at
him, and said he was a trai-tor, pnd on-ly wan-ted to get the sheep to
him-self, and that the Wolf was an hon est beast, and loved the small
dogs, and would do the sheep no harm.
The Wolf, knowing that if he could only suc-ceed in gain-ing over
the big dog Prince he might eas-i-ly mas-ter the small curs one by one,
was always verypo-lite to Prince, and used to send him civil mess-ages,
in-vi-ting him to take coun-cil with him, for the ben-e-fit of the o-ther
dogs, and the sheep. For a long time the big dog on-ly grow-led and
trot-ted the other way when-e-ver he saw the Wolf ma-king to-wards
him.
But at last, find-ing the Wolf would take no de-nial of his in-vi-ta-
tions, he sent him a let-ter, pro-mi-sing to meet him.
The Wolf was de-light-ed and saia to his cubs, "Now I have the
big dog at last." And off he trot-ted to the place of meet-ing. Jt
was in a thick wood on a hill, with an old cas-tle built at the top.
The big dog was at the gate of the cas-tle, and when the Wolf came
up, with a grin that show-ed his long, sharp teeth, he said—" Walk in,
my dear Wolf; I am so glad to Bee you." Then the Wolf put his paw
on his heart, and said, "Dear Prince, I have been wait-ing so long for
this hap-py meet-ing. I do feel so fond of all you dogs, and of those
dear sheep you watch so well, you can't think. I have apian, by which
the small dogs will be a-ble to do their work, so plea-sant-ly and so
ea-si-ly. What a shame it is, that the poor lit-tle beasts should be so
hard work-ed, and kept out in all wca-thers, guard-ing their sheep from
the wick-ed wolves that sur-round them. Now you are a great dog,
and ve-ry strong. Sup-pose you took the work of the small dogs off
their hands, and kept all the sheep your-self. They might sleep in the
sun, and you and I would take care they had plen-ty of nice bones and
paunches; and mean-while we would guard the sheep to-ge-ther."
Then the big dog laugh-ed and said, "A nice plan, in-deed! How
ve-ry kind you are! Here are all the small dogs just in-side the gate.
Per-haps you will be kind e-nough to tell them the nice lit-tle planyou
have just told me, and see how they will like it." Then the Wolf
be-gan to feel very awk-ward and un-com-fort-a-ble, and felt that the
big dog had led him in-to a trap; and he curl-ed up his mouth in-to
what he meant for a ve-ry sweet smile, and said, "No, thank you, dear
Prince. I think I will not say any-thing to them to-day. I have not
got my speech quite rea-dy." Then all the small dogs, who had heard
all from in-side the old cas-tle, be-gan to yelp and to laugh, and to
wag their tails, and to set up a cry of, " How ve-ry kind you are, dear
Wolf, to think of ta-king the charge of our sheep off our hands 1
So the Wolf, see-ing his plot was de-tect-ed, sneak-ed off with his tail
be-tween his legs, and from that time the small dogs knew that Prince
was their true friend, and were jea-lous of him no long-er, and made up
their own quar-rels, and the Wolf was fain to keep his de-signs a-gainst
the sheep in the dark, till he could find a bet-ter time for put-ting
them in ex-e-cu-tion.

THE VOLUNTEER REVIEW.
Policeman {who, toe are bound to say, is extremely civil). "White Ticket, Ma'am? Letter H!—Yes, Ma'am. Quite right. Over
the Hurdles, if you please!"
VICTORIA'S MID-DAY REVIEW.
They tell us a tale that we dare not ignore;
That deep in a glade we have hunted before
A Tiger'is waiting to spring,
And so we come up to our Queen, as of yore
Our fathers came up to their King.
The beast that is lurking is fiercer, they say,
Than the Tiger our fathers brought grimly to hay,
And rolled in his blood at their feet,
And therefore we come to our Lady to-day,
The vow of our sires to repeat.
We come, but it is not in plaint or in fear—
Which, which did the Queen, proudly marking us, hear
In the voice of that thunder-toned shout f
We come but to show her what Hunters are neat
For the hour when her bugles ring out.
We come with firm footstep, as Hunters should tread,
With the glaive by the side, with the plume on the head,
With the heart where a Hunter's should be;
And each with the weapon of weapons most dread,
Most dread in the hands of the Free.
Nor idly we come in a holiday pride,
With arms unaccustomed, with sinews untried,
To deal with a savage so fell;
We know from our sires, when a savage hath died,
His Hunters have quit them right well.
And we come that the Lady of Kingdoms may know,
In the day, should it chance, that her bugles shall blow
She shall find Hunter-Soldiers astir ,
And the men whom her signal shall launch on the foe
Shall be worthy of dying for Her.
From the Loom, from the Mine, from t he Forge, from the Mart,
From the cells of stern Science, the halls of fair Art,
From the homes of calm Learning, we come;
Who grudges his brother a brotherly part
In our work—let him hence, and lie dumb!
Some say the War-Tiger is scared from the fight;
And some that his courage hath quailed to a blight
From the scent of our fresh-flowing sea;
And some that he is but a monster to fright
The folks near his home. It may be:
But our fields they lie open, our gardens are rare.
And those we love better than life wander there.
And our babies are crawling about;
And none of us all is so brave as to dare
To leave certain questions in doubt.
So we come in our thousands, from cot and from ha..,
And from thousands again who are ready at call,
Should once the War-Tiger be seen,
And this is the errand on which, one and all,
We come up, to-day, to the Queen.
Did they daunt the brave Hunters in years have gone by,
That foam on his fangs and that fire in his eye.
As he rushed in his rage on the spear F
No, thus, ever thus, the War-Tiger should die:
Come, Tiger, the Hunters are here.
The blood-thirsty growl and the roar are in vain;
If the savage attack us, the savage again
Shall writhe in a merited doom;
There's the steel for his flank, and the ball for his brain,
Come, Tiger, and spring on thy tomb.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A SCHOOLMASTER SLIGHTLY ABROAD.
onslderate as Mr. Punch is at
all t imes, be would not think of
troubling a Schoolmaster with
any work in addition to that of
his school, until the holidays bad
Hit. in. But now that our Young
Friends are at home, Mr. P.
ventures to ask Ma. H. E.
Janson, of Brighton, what is
the exact meaning of the follow-
ing note, which he inserted in
the Times t—
"To the SdUor of the " lima."
"Sir.—I beg very distinctly to
contradict a statement In Mr.
Clkby's letter to tbe Timet, that I
have ever threatened to cane y»>ung
Vansittart, or that I have ever held
a stick over him. My practice is
very different to this, as I may confi-
dently appeal to all my pupils.
"I remain, Sir.
Your Obedient Servant,
"H. E. Janson."
11 106, Lamdovne Place, Brighton."
"My practice is very different to this," says Mr. Janson, in ques-
tionable English. Then what it Ma. Janson's practice P Mr. Punch
hopes, and believes, that Mr. Janson (whose haste to deny brutality
does him credit) means that he does not wop his hoys. But from his
letter it might be inferred that he does not "threaten," or "hold a
stick over a culprit, but lets into him at once, like one o'clock. Or
is it the stick which is repudiated, and is the "different practice" the
use of a trifle from the tree Betula, vel betulla, not nearly so pleasant a
refresher as one at Birch's, in Cornhill. Not pausing for a reply,
Mr. Punch proceeds to the last part of the letter. "At I may confi-
dently Appeal to all my pupils." If any pupil of Mr. Janson's Drought
him such a sentence as this, it is possible that the youth might make a
vain Appeal against orders to " stay in" all the afternoon, and consider
Linoley Murray on Prosody. Suppose, all the boys having gone
borne, Mr. Janson should beguile his leisure by improving his compo-
sition. Mr. Punch'* zeal in favour of education will be regarded by
Mr. Janson as ample excuse for troubling that gentleman with the
hint,
ME. PUNCH AIMD THE FRENCH ORPHEONISTS.
Last week Mr. Punch, as representative of England, fraternised
with the French Orphans, as by some English literati the Orpheonists
were called. As the Romans to Mare. Antony, he first "lent them
his ears," and them gave them his hands, clapped in thundering
applause. Their performance far exceeded all that bad been promised
of them, and in the thunder of Punch Tonans their triumph was
complete.
On tbe merits of their singing Mr. Punch need not dilate, for he
could scarcely print a word of praise without committing plagiary, so
amply has the subject been recently discussed. Enough to say that
these French singers sang with such distinctness that, to English ears,
their French was perfectly intelligible; and as near three thousand
tongues were wagged for each one word, it may be fancied with what
practice and precision they were drilled. Not being used of late to
bear tbe French sing small, Mr. Punch was struck especially with the
piano passages; and, without meaning a pun, he came to the con-
clusion that, in the singing of the Orpheonists, their piano is their
forte. Mr. Punch has long been used to consider the Cologne Choir
unapproachable in this; but had he now to give the prize, ne rather
thinks that he would have to halve his golden pippin, and award one
aureous moiety to his new friends from France. The faultless manner,
too, in which they kept up the true pitch was, as a musical wag
remarked, the true pitch of perfection. And not less to be praised
was the finish of their Swells, which were as exquisite as those of
"Wegent Stweet" or " Wotten Wow." In short, as
"Orpheus with his lute made trees,
Aiid the mountain tops that freeze.
Bow themselves when he did sing,"
so did the French Orpheonists with the sweet music they discoursed
make Mr. Puwh, and some few tens of thousands of his countrymen,
nod their heads in pleasant approbation of their efforts. (Parentheti-
cally, too. Mr. Punch must give one word of commendation to the
Guides; for he felt that, with such guides to accompany a chorus, the
march to vocal victory was easy of accomplishment.
By way of a finale to each of the four concerts, there was such cheer-
ing and such bandclapping, and such waving of hats, handkerchiefs,
Earasols, and programmes, that experienced Mr. Punch had both to rub
is eyes and twitch his ears before he could believe that he was not
deceived by them. A scene of such excitement is so rarely seen in
England (before dinner at least) that Mr. Punch could scarcely bring
his senses to put credence in it. With a sort of friendly rivalry the
audience cheered the singers and the singers cheered the audieuce;
and the oldest and the coldest morning concert-goers present gave vent
to their enthusiasm without feeling they lost caste by it. Indeed they
so warmed up that the fire of wit was kindled, and some brilliant
things popped out of it. For instance when French gallantry sent
forth a shout of " Five la Peine.'" a British wit at once flashed forth
the sparking sally, "Ah, we've la Rain, indeed! You may well say
that, my boys, seeing that we've scarcely had a dry half hour these
six months!"
And these—Mr Punch could not help seriously reflecting, while his
heart, big with fraternity, bumped against his waistcoat—these are
the Allies who by this time had been enemies, if statescraftsmen and
soldiers had been allowed to have their way. These are the two nations,
the one deriving some of its old blood from the other, who are said to
be in nature like as dog and cat, and to have only the feeling of vin-
dictiveness in common. Surely nations would keep friends if they
were left more to themselves, and surely statescraftsmen and soldiers
who would hound ou the French poodle to attack the British bulldog,
should be hissed off the stage as the bad genii of the peace.
But if there be one thing more likely than another to foster kindly
feeling between Englishmen and French, it is by letting them compete
in friendly rivalry of art, instead of stirring them to deadly rivalry in
arms. Were Festivals of Music internationally appointed, nations
would live more in harmony together, and " Discord, dire sister," would
be swept from off the earth.
Wherefore Mr. Punch, in the name of all the peacemakers, tenders
thanks to all concerned in the Ornheonist invasion, which he regards
as the in-bringing of a new era of peace. It will be no fault of Old
England if "La Nouvelle Alliance" does not take root in her soil, and
"France! France!" if left alone will surely strive to foster it. By
instituting this first of Anglo-French peace festivals the Sacred
Harmonic Society has shown itself a Peace Society; and indefatigable
Mr. Bowley, the prime mover in the matter, should have a statue
large as life for bringing it to pass. How much Income-Tax might be
saved, were musical invasions to supersede the chance of martial ones,
Mr. Punch will leave to Mr. Gladstone to determine; and he will
likewise leave that gentleman to introduce into his Beer Bill a clause
allowing our pale ale, for the use of all French singers, to be sold
them free of duty upon either hops or malt. With which last thought
for their welfare, Mr. Punch again shakes hands with his French
friends Les Orpheonistes, and, as usual, speaking as the mouthpiece
of All England, he bids them not adieu—but, in no long time, au revoir.
NEWLY-DISCOVERED WOEK BY MR. MACAULAY.
"The following curious advertisement lately appeared in the Bristol Mirror :—
'If the gentleman who borrowed the fourth volume of Macaglat's History of
England far a Fortnight, some two years since, is determined not to return it, bo had
better apply to J. R. T.t Mirror Office, for the three remaining volumes, which will
render his set complete.'"
On the contrary, he had better send the volume he possesses to
Messrs. Longman, who are probably unaware of the existence of the
work in question, and might like to include it in the new edition of
Mr. Macaulay's productions. Mr. Punch also would like to see it,
being curious to know what Fortnight in the History Lord Macatjlay
selected as the theme for his brilliant illustration. Perhaps it was the
immortal fortnight in 1811 that beheld the birth of Punch. Anyhow,
the Bristol gentleman should let the world know something of this
History of England for a Fortnight.
Compensation for All or None.
The House of Commons has discountenanced the proposal of the
Attorney-General to afford compensation to the officials who will
be superseded by the enactment of his Bankruptcy Bill. Why, indeed,
should those gentlemen be compensated for their prospective loss any
more than the Publicans whose gains may be diminished by the Wine
Licences Act? Honourable Gentlemen, perhaps, are disposed to
refuse compensation to anybody whatever, on the twofold principle
t hat what is sauce for goose is sauce for gander, and thatjw enlightened
financiers hold, the cessation of liability under Schedule D is a sufficient
set off against the ruin entailed by loss of income.

HEART AND HEAD IN THE CORPORATION
OF LONDON.
At the Common Hall of the Livery of the City of
London, Mr. Alderman A muss and Mr. Lush having
been, with the usual formalities and row, elected Sheriffs,
the latter gentleman made the following neat and appro-
priate speech on the occasion :—
"Mr. Lush admitted that he had no claim to the office upon the
sco'e of any great ability. It was not. he said, possible for all men
to be Peels or Grkvs, Gladstonss or Grahams; but it was possiblo
> for all to be houi-st men, and he promisod to act honestly In the
discharge of his public duties, ana to use bis utmost exertions to
sustain tho honour and dignity of the office."
It has been said that when an office is conferred upon a
man, he is usually also inspired with the abilities necessary
to discharge it. Worthy Mr. Lush need not fear that his
talents will be inadequate to the requirements of the office
of Sheriff of London and Middlesex. These have been
usually considered to be amply insured by the proof of
intelligence competent to the numeration of hobnails, and
mechanical faculty sufficient to chop sticks. The duties
which the Sheriff is called upon to peiform are not such as
to render a competitive examination a very necessary con-
dition to eligibility to the Shrievalty. If anything of the
kind were requisite, it would perhaps be a trial, on the
part of candidates, of their comparative proficiency in the
use of the knife and fork. The successful competitor might
be the one who showed himself the best man "to carve a
capon and eat it." If it were possible for Mr. Lush to
be a Peel, a Gladstone, or a Graham, it might not be
desirable, at least for the Corporation of London. Some
of those statesmen might be too strongly disposed to
trouble their fellow-citizens with projects for municipal
reform. We wish Mr. Lush every success in the attempt
to display, as an honest man, his moral splendour, which, in
a civic dignitary, will amply compensate for almost any
deficiency of intellectual brightness.

A PLEA FOE SAGGED PLAY-GEOTJNDS.
The maxim that "nullum tempus occurrit Regi Punchio" is quite
enough of an excuse, if any at all be needed, for King Punch now
to signify his Royal approbation of a speech made by Lord Shaftes-
bury some short time ago at a meeting of the patrons of the Field
Lane Ragged Schools. After speaking of the progress and success of
that establishment, his Lordship turned from ragged schools to talk
of ragged play-grounds, a subject which has more than once engaged
the Royal pen and pencil of Kino Punch; and while discoursing on
this theme, his Lordship laudibly let fall the following observations,
which King Punch will for posterity preserve in the embalming
amber of his type :—
"It was stated in the House of Commons tho other night, that In our metropo-
litan prisons thore were forty-two children, under thirteen years of age, who were
confined there for playing at marbles, or at driving hoops, or at a game called * tip-
cat.' No doubt it was quite necessary that these games should be prohibited in the
streets, where they were dangerous, and horses might be frightened, or the pas-
sengers' oyes might be injured by them. But when we had an opportunity of
opening as play-grounds large places In London, where poor children might enjoy
their sports without any danger, was that advantage to be taken from them, and
wore we to go on imprisoning the children because they indulged in a natural and
proper propensity where they could. (Chtert)."
Tip-cat, hoops, and marbles, are nuisances, no doubt, to adults who
never play at them, and Kino Punch has more than once severely
suffered from these pastimes. Indeed, he rarely shows himself at any
of the Courts (he means those of St. Giles's rather than St. James's)
without having his Royal eve half knocked out by a tip-cat, or being
tripped up by a hoop trundled between his Royal legs. But whatever
may be done by crusty old curmudgeons, King Punch would never
dream of prosecuting his small torturers. Though what is sport to
them not seldom proves almost the death of him. His Royal breast is
moved by no vindictive feeling; on the contrary. King Punch main-
tains that children must have play, however be may suffer by it.
Playing is a natural necessity of life to them, and play they must and
will, pass what laws we may to punish and prohibit them. If we
deny them proper play-grounds tney will play upon the pavements,
and no one but a Bomba would imprison them for playing, there.
But are there no spare places where poor children might play,
without annoyance to the public? Why should not vaoant Smithfield
be made a ragged play-ground, instead of being turned into a noxious
dead-meat market? Lord Shaftesbury for one will not see its site
so desecrated, and King Punch for another will take care to defend
it. This is how the children's champion throws his gauutlet bravely
down, and boldly souuds his challenge against all civic comers:—
11 He did not know whother in that room there was present any worthy citizen
or member of the Corporation of London; but if so, he (Lord ShaftesbukyJ now
gave him due notice that ho would contest this point tooth and nail, and step by
step, so long as be had any breath in him : he would resist any attempt to give up
one square inch of the site ol SniithGeld Market for any other purpose than for tho
health and happiness, the security and recreation of tho population of Loudon."
Bravo! good Lord Shaftesbury! You speak up like a man on
behalf of London children, and on behalf of them King Punch now
thanks you for your speech. In carrying out your promise to defend
the Bite of Smithfield, your Lordship may rely on the assistance of
King Punch. By King Punch's pen the pens of Smithfield were
demolished, and with the same steel weapon King Punch will now
defend its site against the butchers' steel. Having cleared away the
beasts that used to make day hideous with their bellowings and Heat-
ings. King Punch has little wish to see their place of meeting haunted
by their ghosts; and this he fears might be the case were a market to
be opened there, for the barter of the carcases of their defunct des-
cendants. Far rather would King Punch see the site of Smithfield
market stocked with living children than with cartloads of dead meat;
and he therefore boldly echoes the defiance of Lord Shaftesbury,
and proclaims War to the Knife! against those greedy citizens who
would make Smithfield a catering-place for the civic knife and fork.

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.

CHAPTER XXI.— MORE ABOUT THE LADIES OF THE
TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES.
Although the ladies of this period were doubtless censured by
their husbands for extravagance in dress, we really think them far
more moderate than some of their descendants. We could, for in-
stance, cite a register to show that sixty shillings only was the cost
of a new robe; and we could also quote a warrant which was issued
by Kino John, ordering the purchase of two robes for the Queen,
whereof each was to consist of five ells only of cloth. When one
reflects that in these days of unconscionable crinoline as much as
twenty yards is far too little for a dress, one can't help wishing one
could take a leaf out of King John's book, and limit one's Jemima
to the six yards and a quarter with which a Queen in the twelfth
century was, doubtless, well content.
The robe, as we have said, was an undergown with sleeves, and it
appears that, during Joun's reigngreen was generally considered the
most fashionable colour for it. Hence we may remark, that pretty
girls who wore it might have been asked why they resembled the fields
in the Creation; the answer, of course, being, that they were " With
Verdure Clad" and, no doubt, "de-
lightful to the ravished sense" of
their admirers. Express mention of
this colour is made in both the war-
rant and the register referred to, and
we likewise find allusion to it in the
accounts given of the flight of Wil-
liam Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, who
was Regent during Richard's ab-
sence in the East. We learn from
Matthew Paris that the Bishop ran
away * "disguised in a green woman's
tunio;" but who was the "green wo-
man," whose robe he ran away in, the
writer of this passage does not pro-
ceed to say.
Over their robes on swell occasions
the ladies wore a mantle, which was
splendidly embroidered, that of Queen
from the portrait of sisHor LONo- Eleanor being sprinkled with a lot
chakp, ix a »lack letter oorr of 0f golden crescents. Under this, or
""UI A(veryR"ar« r08" DATS" on ordinary days perhaps in lieu of it,
they wore a closely-fitting garment,
which being richly furred, was called pelisson, or pelisse; a name said
to be derived from pelletier, a furrier. King John orders a grey one,
with nine bars of fur, to be made up for his Queen: t and we learn,
from an old jest book, that when she tried it on the King made some
mild joke about her being in the pelisse.
A garment called a bliaus (whence, doubtless, the'modern blouse), is
also mentioned at this period as being worn over the robe; but it
appears that the word bliaus was only another name for the surcoat
or supertunic. For winter use, we learn, the bliaus was lined with fur;
but we cannot say if it was waterproofed for summer, as, were it now
in wearing, it certainly would need to be.
_ The wimple, of which mention is first made during King John's
time, was an under-veil or kerchief wrapped round the head and chin,
and at times completely enveloping the neck. For the nuns and
poorer classes it was made of linen, and fastened on the forehead with
a plain fillet to match: but the swellesses all wore it of gold tissue or
rich silk, and had their fillets jewelled with gems which, Cox remarks,
some jew 'eld not unfrequently in pawn for tliem.
The pepium, or veil, was worn over the wimple; and above them
both was often placed a diadem or garland, or else a small round hat
or cap. Isabel, the sister of King Henrt the Third, is described
by Matthew Paris as taking off her hat and veil, so as to let the
people see her face, which, if she was pretty, was a vastly proper
action in her. We find too, from the famous Roman de la Rose (a
poem we shall have more fully to refer to), that at times a floral
chaplet was worn besides the diadem or coronal of gold, as bears
witness the couplet:—
"Ung ch«ppel de rose* tout frais
Eut dessus le ehappel d'Orfrays."
* We surely need not caution our enlightened readers against believing the
surmise of Cox, the Finsbury Historian, that it was from his creditors the Bishop
ran away; nor need we refute the furthor supposition, that it was at Kunnymcde
that Lonochamp set off running, in company, as Cox conjectures, with John Lack-
land, whose Estates bad just boon confiscated for bis helping Titus Oates to get
up the Rye Houf>e Plot
t "It appears from this, and from the warrant above quoted, that husbands in
there days used to order their wives' dresses. Were this custom of the 'good old
times' to be revived, what mints of money might be saved, and what preposterous
absurdities of crinoliuo be spared us!"—Punch, "And what friyhts you stingy
creatures would bo sure to make of us I"—Judy.
This fact is also mentioned in another ancient poem, with which some
antiquarians may perhaps be less familiar:—
"Shtc wore a fnrtathc of rosea
J5t amgijte tohm finrte shtt mrr..
9 golor garlanDt tht fjauDt shrr on,
Co maw ijrr «piffitn gelt."
We regret to have to add (but Truth must not be sacrificed, though
gallantry might wish it so), that the ladies of this period were by no
means so attentive to their hands as to their heads, for though they
took great care to dress and decorate the former, they were actually
so vulgar as to leave the latter naked! By the old illuminations the
clearest light is thrown on this appalling fact, and we have read in
black and white abundant other proof of it. Thus, when King Henrt,
in the well-known ballad of "JFagre ftosatnonti," mentions as his
reason for going down to Woodstock, that he merely wished to get
some gloves made for his wife, ">• furious queene" throws instantly
discredit on the statement; and knowing that those articles of dress
were not in fashion, with a woman's quick sagacity she jumps to the
conclusion that:—
"©if hrt bunt thit for (Elobf.maftnng
Itt bias toitfjoutt ge (Si I"
For further illustration of this love-story or glove-story, we may

QUEEN ELEANOR AND FAIR ROSAMOND. FROH AN OLD ILLUMINATION.
(IMPROVED.)
DONNYBROOK IN THE PAPAL STATES.
Some of the Irish papers state that Dr. Cullen has thought it
necessary to endeavour to stay the rather overflowing tide of emigra-
tion to Rome. This is not unlikely. Cullen is probably well enough
acquainted with his countrymen to perceive that his master the Pope
may find too much of an Irish contingent too much of a good thing.
Pugnacity is well known to be a very prominent feature of the Hiber-
nian character: and if Lamoriciere cannot immediately find his
Emerald Islanders a foe, they may very possibly take it into their
heads to choose antagonists for themselves. Generosity, however
capable of perversion, being another of Paddy's principal qualities,
it may happen that when the Irish auxiliaries of His Holiness dis-
cover that they have been humbugged by their priests, and crimped
by those fraudulent ecclesiastics for the support of a shameful des-
?otism, the enemy whom they will select will not be United Italy,
t may, indeed, be expected, that the slogan of Erin Co Bragh! wi
ultimately be raised under the banner of Garibaldi.
Puseyism in the Police Office.
TnE riots at St. George's-in-the-East have not been stopped by
having frequently been brought before the Thames Police Court.
While the Rector of that parish persists in the puerility of playing at
Popery, it is not likely that those disgraceful proceedings would ter-
minate even if his Church were situated in the district of Worship
Street.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Costermonqeb. "Now then, you—vert arc you a-driving tot"
'Bus Drives. ' Wliy, can't you set t To Paddington—I'm sure it's writ up big cnuffl"
GENEROUS BEING.
"A Sheet or Tissce PxriR
Four Miles Long.—A sheet of
tissuo paper bos been exhibiting
at Colston, Devonshire. It mea-
sures in length four miles, being
21,000 feet long, and is in breadth
6 feet 3 inches. The weight of it
is but 190 lbs. It was manufac-
tured in twelve hours."
This is not a tissue of
lies, but is entirely true.
The paper was made by
order of Mr. Punch, and is
now cut into squares for
wrappiug up the gold
watcbes.rings, studs, chains,
and other ornaments which
he is always bestowing upon
his Young Men in acknow-
ledgment of brilliant lite-
rary or artistic efforts.
Such are his generosity and
their genius that the paper
will not last him above six
mouths.
Rubrical Costume.
Mb. Punch presents his
compliments to the Rev.
Bryan King, and recom-
mends him to buy a quire
of foolscap wherewith to
make caps for his choris-
ters, and also a suitable
covering for any other head
hich lie may feel it to
fit.
THE UMBRELLA RIFLE.
Mr. Punch begs to call the attention of Volunteers in general to
his newly-invented weapon, the Umbrella Rifle, which has been
introduced by him expressly to meet the requirements of the present
rainy season. With that modesty which ever is attendant on true
genius, Mr. Punch will frankly own that his invention was suggested
by a well-known apparatus, which combines those useful implements
the parasol and whip. By cleverly adapting this ingenious idea,
Mr. Punch has introduced au instrument for Riflemen which will prove
at once protective and destructive, and will shield them from a soaking
while it provides them with the means of opening a hot fire. The
umbrella Deing fixed near to the muzzle of the rifle, the ribs, when not
distended, will lie flat along the barrel, and will be covered in fine
weather with the usual oilslin case. No impediment will thus occur
in taking aim, nor will the handling of the rifle in the least be interfered
with. As soon, however, as a shower comes (as on marching or parade
days it is almost sure to do), the order can be given to "Uncover
Umbrellas," and the men may stand at ease and defy the threatened
ducking.
Mr. Punch need not dilate upon the benefits and comforts his inven-
tion will confer on Volunteers who wisely use it; but as economy is
(said to be) the order of the day, he may just point out how vastly his
new instrument will help towards it. It has been calculated by a
most eminent military mathematician, that every time a Rifleman gets
soaked through to the skin (which happens on an average three times
out of four that he ventures on parade) five shillingsworth of injury
is done to a new uniform, and as much as three and sixpence worth
of damage to an old one. Whenever he gets "washed, just washed
in a shower," not less than one and ninepence worth of gloss is wetted
off him: while, since it is proverbial that
41 London rain
Leaves a stain ,n
as few as half-a-dozen drops of it will take out of him at least a
shillingsworth of shine.
When to this account is added the saving of expense in cabbing
home from wet parades, and of doctors' bills for curing cramps and
coughs and colds, and the hundred other ills that humid flesh is heir
to, Mr. Punch feels proudly sure that his Umbrella Rifle will prove
to be the cheapest and most comfortable weapon that has been ever
introduced to the notice of the nation, and no Volunteer's equipment
will be thought complete without it.
A drawing showing the invention as it appears in use will be shown
for a few days in the window of the Punch Office, when as well as
afterward, copies may be had, price threepence, at the counter, or four-
pence if impressed with the Governmental stamp.
N.B. Mackintoshed Percussion-Caps for the Wimbledon Meeting
should be immediately applied for. Also ask for Mr. Punch's Imper-
vious Short-Pipe Cover and Waterproof Cigars, which have been
expressly manufactured for bad weather, and are essential to damp
Riflemen when "marching easy" in the wet.
A PROFESSOR IN THE "HUE AND CRY."
Under the head of "Extensive Robberies of Cash, Plate, and
Jewels" the Morning Post, the other day, enumerating a glut of crimes,
of which information had been received the day before by the Police,
states that the Authorities of Scotland Yard had been apprised—
"Thattho Kev. W. 8. Chalkley, a Wesleyan preacher, had gone off with £5,000,
which he obtained by fraud and lorgery as 8ecrotary to tho Lancashire Mutual
Loan Society. The discovery of Chalkley's delinquency has created much scandal
among the Reformed Wesleyans, of which body he was a member."
There must be some mistake in this announcement. The idea of
any Wesleyan preacher bolting with money with which lie had been
entrusted, is absurd enough; but the conception of a preacher who is
not merely a Wesleyan, but even a reformed one, committing such an
offence, is too ridiculous. It is incredible that an ordinary methodist
parson should be a rogue, and quite out of the question that extra-
sanctified methodism should be consistent with double-dyed rascality.
We cannot believe that Brother Chalkley walked his chalks with
the funds of the brethren. At least, let us hope that if there is any
truth in the report that Mr. Chalkley has "gone off with £5,000,'
the fact simply is, that the Rev. Gentleman, being a bachelor, and
having been successful in the pulpit, has eloped with an heiress of that
amount, who is now Mrs. Chalkley, and rejoices in the congratula-
tions of all the other reformed young methodist ladies who are
privileged to sit under her husband.
The Practical Housewife.—" Sir," said, speaking of his wife,
the husband of a lady whose mind was exclusively devoted to domestic
affairs—" Sir. she would have made a dumpling of the apple which
revealed the law of gravitation to Newton."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

DIVERSIONS OF DRILL.
Come Mam of the Company (in a stentorian whisper). '' Eyes left I There's a Ballo on I"
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 2. Monday. Mr. Punch, not now speaking in lightness, but
on the contrary, as the Wiscount says, seriatim, observes that this has
been a remarkable Parliamentary week, and that mention of what took
place on its penultimate and antepenultimate days will he made in the
Constitutional Histories that will be read when Punch himself shall
be the only surviving representative of the Victorian Age. Lord
Macaulay's New Zealander—no, let us give the eternal and unborn
heal hen a little peace—but this is a week to be remembered, and there-
fore Mr. Punch erects to it a memorial, are perennius, and though now
purchasable for a ludicrously small amount of that metal, will one day
be worth the weight, in gold, of the three largest George the Third
pennies that were ever shied at a mudlark at Greenwich.
On the Monday the noticeable incident in the Lords was the extra-
ordinary obstinacy of the Duke op Marlborough. When small men
deal with great subjects they usually display an arrogance proportioned
to their incapacity. TheDuKE of Marlborough conceives that he has
a mission to direct England as to the mode in which she shall educate
India. Wise men have thought that during the present state of the
minds of the natives of India it is better that we should gradually pre-
Eare those minds for the reception of Christian teaching, than at once
egin with the Bible. The Duke thinks differently, and insisted
to-night on bringing forward a motion on the subject. The leading
Representative Men in the Lords begged him not to do bo. Lord
Shaftesbury, for Evangelicalism and Missionary Societies, Lord
Ellenborough, for Indian Governments. Lord Granville, for the
Queen's Government, Lord Derby, for the Queen's Opposition, and
Lord Brougham, for Common Sense and Experience, all urged this
request, but in vain. The Duke was stubborn, and made a long
speech, and his motion. The severest rebuke which can be read to a
gentleman was then administered. No answer was made him, but
Lord Brougham without a needless word moved the Previous
Question, which means {tide your Dod) that a formal method was
taken of getting rid of a subject which a meeting has no intention of
discussing. The Duke was dropped as flat as his own speech.
In the Commons, the first move was made in the Important Game
to which Mr. Punch has adverted, Lord Palmerston giving notice
that he should on the Thursday call attention to the Report of the
Committee on the interference of the Lotds with Tax Bills, and should
propose certain Resolutions.
The debate on the Indian Army Fusion Bill was resumed and con-
tinued by Mr. Rich (the late Mr. Henry Drummond's Little Pig
that squeaked because lacteal nourishment was not attainable by it),
Sir De Lacy Evans, who stood up for the loyalty of the English
soldiers in India, and urged that they had been treated unfairly and
ungraciously in the arrangements of the transfer of the Army to the
Queen, Mr. Monckton Milnes, who protested against our Lust of
Centralisation, and divers other military and lay figures, and the second
reading of the Bill was finally carried by 282 to 53. There was a
nursery rhyme of Mr. Punch's demigodlike infancy, a rhyme descended
from the time of the Civil Wars, but which he never has been able to
connect with the history of the period:—
"High diddle diddle and high diddle ding,
The Parliament soldiers are going to the King."
Infants of the present generation may have this transfer and fusion
business stamped upon their butter-like memories by a variation upon
the above beautiful couplet:—
"High diddle, diddle the soldier so green,
The Company's Soldiers are sold to the Queen."
Tuesday. The Bill for providing means for settling disputes between
Masters and Operatives (this does not mean Maestri and Opera-singers,
Wiscount) was read a second time in the Lords, but declared very
unsatisfactory. A Bill for creating a Native Council in New Zealand,
for settling Land disputes, was read a second time, on the Govern-
ment's motion. It is to be hoped that it provides for civil and polite
conduct on the part of the Members towards each other. We shall
perhaps read of references to "the Honourable Member with the Blue
Tattoo," and that "the Speaker then retired and eat his grandmother;
after which the Council resumed."
After some military debates in the Commons, they got themselves

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 14, 1860.
| Counted Out. Some Gas Bill dodge was said to hare something to do
with the affair.
i Wednesday. Good Mr. Hubbard,
He went to his cupboard,
And put in his neat little Bill
(On the Text Church Kate question)
At civil suggestion
That the measure amounted to nil.
A very good Bill for taking the mismanagement of country roads out
of the hands of slow, stupid, and stingy boors, and transferring the
duty to a responsible Board that could be made to understand a
subject, and to feel a kicking for neglecting it, was read a second
time by 203 to 120, Mr. Henley, as usual, growling and grumbling
against any change in any existing system. For a man of real sense,
Henlet is the best type of an Obstructive that is presented in the
, House of Commons. He knows enough to do very great mischief,
and, as somebody told him more truly than civilly, he worries Bills like
a great ferret with a rat. It was very fit that such a Stick-in-the-mud
i should oppose a measure for making roads passable, and this senti-
mental excuse is the only one that Mr. Punch can invent for him.
Then came another thing considerably to be regretted. Does anybody
know what a Marine Store Dealer is? He or she, for the women are
worse than the men, keeps a filthy little den, usually covered with
vulgar, flaunting placards, tempting servant girls ana the like with
visions of fine clothes in exchange for "odds and ends," and with
doggerel verses such as:—
"If you want a bit of luck
Come to Mother Habakkuk,
Bring old bottles, bones, and rags,
And she 'will fill your money-bags."
But this is merely a blind. The real business of the rogue is to buy,
for as little of course as will be taken, anything that a servant, a child,
or an apprentice, can bring. The Marine-Store keeper is, in fact, a
receiver of stolen goods, and half the juvenile crime of our cities is
attributable to these wretches, who not only receive the produce of
thefts, but hint to their customers what thefts are easiest and most
profitable. The Police Magistrates would have the utmost pleasure in
seeing them all transported, but unluckily they are themselves in
no peril of such an exit, though they annually send hundreds and
thousands to our gaols and convict-ships. Various attempts have been
made to give the police some hold over the rascals, but the means have
not been very effective, and the fearful demoralisation business goes on.
A Bill has been introduced this session for dealing with them, but in
the natural desire of the framers to make it as stringent as possible,
they have so devised it as to make it operate against honest trades-
people. Sin G. C. Lewis remarked that it was true that "Marine
Store Dealers were to a great extent dealers in stolen goods," but he
did not promise his aid in amending and carrying so needful a measure.
He did promise, however, to consult with the Magistrates.
Thursday. That poor old creature. Lord Normanby, did a little
cackling against Garibaldi and the Italians; but the aged goose only
succeeded in eliciting from Beveral Peers a warm tribute to the
humanity, as well as to the bravery, of the Dictator of Sicily. Nor-
manby on Garibaldi is like an old black beetle crawling on a lion's
mane.
In the Commons, Lord John Russell mentioned that President
Buchanan had recalled General Harney from San Juan. This
Harney has been trying to get up a collision between the English
and the Americans at San Juan. He is so fond of bloodshedding that
he once flogged a woman to death. The President has very wisely
removed this man, and all seems likely to be serene until the question
of ownership shall be decided between the Governments. Lord John
also stated that our Commander, off Naples, knows exactly what to do
in the event of an insurrection.
Then began the discussion upon the Resolutions moved by Lord
Palmerston, in assertion of the Rights and Privileges of the House
of Commons. As Mr. Punch's Parliamentary History is about the only
one which anybody now reads, and will be quite the only one which
will be read by Posterity, he deems it fit, in the exercise of his
Absolute Wisdom, to insert those Resolutions in this place. They are
these:—
"1. That the right of granting aids and supplies to the Crown is in the Commons
alone, as an essential part of their constitution; and the limitation of all such
slants, as to the matter, manner, measure, and time, is only in them.
"2. That although the Lords have exercised the power of rejecting Bills of several
descriptions relating to taxation by negativing the whole, yet the exercise of that
power by them has not been frequent, and is justly regarded by this House with
peculiar jealousy, as afTecting tbe right of the Commons to grant the supplies and
to provide the ways snd means for the service of the year.
"3. That, to guard for the future against an undue exerciso of that power by the
Lords, and to secure to the Commons their rightful control over taxation and
supply, this House has In its own hands the power so to impose and remit taxes,
and to frame Bills of supply, that the right of the Commons as to the matter,
manner, measure, and time, may be maintained inviolate."
The debate which followed, and which lasted through Thursday and
Friday night, was remarkable in itself, on account of the attitude into
which the House, by addressing itself to such a subject, put itself in
regard to the House of Lords, and also on account of the fact that
while Lord Palmerston, the Premier, virtually defended the conduct
of the Lords, and stated himself content with the proposed protest,
Mr. Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord John
Russell, the Foreign Secretary, took an opposite course, Mr. Glad-
stone desiring "Action," and Lord John reserving a right" to do
as he might see fit. It is not improbable that such a Split, on such a
question, may lead to a solution of continuity in a certain Cabinet, but
we shall see. There is no doubt about the fact, for the ultra-Liberals
are pouring their fiercest abuse upon Lord Palmerston, as a Faithless
Chief, a Traitor, and all sorts of sad things, and lauding Mr. Glad-
stone and Lord John as something a little better than any Patriots
of past ages who have died for their country.
Lord Palmerston moved the Resolutions in a speech of much
tact, dexterity, and good sense. He was vehemently cheered—by the
Opposition.
Mr. Collier, learnedly and lengthily, censured the Lords, and
warned the House to be on guard.
Mr. Coningham was not content with merely recording resolutions,
and was for forcing the Peers to give way.
Mr. Scully thought that passing the Resolutions was all that could
be done.
Mr. Leatham was contemptuous about precedents, denounced the
Lords, and had something to say about Charles the First's head.
Mr. Bernal Osborne made fun of the grammar of the Resolutions,
and declared them intended to patch up a Treasury quarrel.
Mr. Edwin James called the Resolutions lame and impotent, and
the act of the Lords a usurpation.
Mr. Gladstone taunted the Opposition for not speaking, called the
Resolutions mild and temperate, but thought that the House would do
well to vindicate its rights by action. He spoke vehemently, and was
vehemently cheered by a portion of the Liberals.
Mr. Whiteside, roused, fired off one of his ready salvoes of good
slashing sarcasm, and demanded whether it was desired to subvert the
Constitution.
After some speeches of no particular mark, and a smart one, against
the Lords, by Mr. Stansfeld.
Mr. Disraeli complimented the Premier, and approved the Reso-
lutions, but defended the Lords, and poured a quantity of ridicule on
Mr. Gladstone, and upon the Split in the Liberal party.
Lord John Russell thought that the Lords had used their power
in an unprecedented manner, and declared his no-confidence in Lord
Derby's leading. The debate was adjourned, and. resumed next
night by
Mr. Dioby Seymour, who was not satisfied with the Resolutions.
'Mr. Horsman delivered a spirited defence of the Lords, and
castigated Mr. Gladstone for playing tricks with finance.
Mr. Bright abused Mr. Horsman, made a very effective speech in
favour of the Budget and the French Treaty, and said that the House
was about to abase itself before the hereditary chamber.
Excitement followed, two divisions on adjournment were taken, and
the motions for it were defeated by 433 to 36, and 369 to 52, and then
The House oj Commons agreed to Lord Palmerston's Reso-
lutions.
RESOLUTION v. ACTION.
Says Pam, with his smile, friends or foes to beguile,
And his jaunty elocution,—
"You may trust all to roe, my dear Gladstone, you see,
I'm a man of resolution''
Says Gladstone, with gloom in his eyes of doom—
And a smile—not of satisfaction:
"Resolution, dear Pam P—That's all S. H. A. M.
I am a man of action!"
Says Pam, "Say you so P Then 'tis well you should know
That the Lords your mistake to correct meant;
And the action I'll take, if a rumpus you make,
Is an action of ejectment."
Action of Damagesl; England v. China.
The estimate of the sum we shall have to pay towards defraying the
expenses of the Chinese War, amounts to £3,800,000. That is all the
damage that has yet been done by our naval and military operations in
China. It is much to be feared that all the future damage which may
be caused by those proceedings will affect only ourselves. We may
pursue the Chinese; but are too likely to catch only the Tartar portion
of the population.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN AMERICAN GENTLEMAN. TO MR. PUNCH
IR,—The Morning Star
publishes a most extra-
ordinary correspond-
ence between Mr.
Commissioner Hill,
Recorder of Birming-
ham, and the Rev.
Edwin Chapman, on
the one part, and a per-
sonage oddly denomi-
nated Sir Samuel
Cunard on the other.
From these premises
it appears that an
American lady, Mrs.
C. E. Putnam, with
her son, Mr. Edmund
T. Putnam, and party,
consisting of a lady
and gentleman, respec-
tively named Smith
and Casset, having
taken first class pas-
senger tickets for
England on board the
steamer Europa, Cap-
tain Leich, were, a
few days before the
steamer sailed, served
with the following
notice:—
•■ Brituh and Aorta American Royal Mail Steam-pacM Company. Qfflct. 99, State Strut, Botton, Oct. 27, 1859.
"For your information, we desire to inform you that a separate table will be provided for yourself and
party on board the Aiiropn, henco to Liverpool, whero everything will be furnishod you that first cabin
passengers are entitled to; the person who applied for your tickets did not state the fact that the party
wero coloured, otherwise we should have informed you.

1 Should this ini

"Mrs. E Putnam and party, Salem."
please apply at this office at
Respectfully,
"(Signed)
and we will refund the
E. C. and J. Q. Bates.
"The arrangement above indicated, Mrs. Putnam states, was enforced during the voyage.
She says, in a letter to an English gentleman:—
u During the whole voyage we were not allowed a heat at the table. . . . And during the last few days
of our voyage we were obliged to sit in the ladies' cabin by ourselves, and servants bring us food as if we wero
criminals, when we had conducted ourselves with the strictest propriety. The captain committed a great
wrong in submitting to the dictation of an American agent. Yours, &C.,
"(Signed) C. E. Putkaji."
"Now the above particulars, and more to the same purpose, were communicated by Mr.
M. D. Hill and Mr. Chapman to the party mysteriously entitled Sir Samuel Cunard,
together with the respectful expression of a hope that, as the chief proprietor of the American
he would prevent the repetition by his agents of the
conduct of which they were guiUy towards Mrs.
Putnam and her friends. To this communica-
tion no answer was returned. A second appeal
obtained the following reply:—
"Buth-hiU-Haute Edmonton, June M, 1860.
"8ir, I have recolvcd your letters of tho 8th and S8th
Inst.
"I do not see that any advantage would result from
discussing the subject matter of those letters, therefore I
niutt decline entering into any correspondence on the
subject. "I am. Sir, your obedient servant,
'* 8. Cntfarc."
"The Rev. E. Chapman, Durdham Down, Bristol."
"Surely the writer of the above letter, signing
himself S. Cunaud, is plain Samuel. It is
impossible that he can be "Sir" Samtjbl. To
he in case to bear the title of Sir, be must needs
he a British subject; whereas it is manifest that
S. Cunard is a regular Yankee. No Englishman
could possibly be capable of such subserviency to
the wicked and absurd antipathies of theAmerican
populace, as to permit, on board any vessel under
his control, the continued perpetration of the
infamous insolence which Mrs. Putnam declares
to have been practised on herself and her friends
by the authorities of the Europa. Any Sir
Samuel Cunabd would have written at once to
Mr. Chapman, apologising for the base brutality
of his servants, and promising to take care that
no ship of his should ever again be disgraced by
such atrocious truckling to the prejudices of
American snobs. The author of the foregoing
refusal to entertain the question of putting a
stop to a system of outrages upon justice,
humanity, freedom, and English civilisation,
can only be one simply Mr. Samuel Cunard;
Samuel unadorned; Samuel, without a handle
to his name; Samuel, the genuine nephew and
countryman of Uncle Sam.
"Yours, &c.,
"Star and Garter."
A riy-Blow.
Butcher's meat is high, and accordingly the
working classes have very reasonably resolved to
abstain from it. If, however, in consequence of
this resolution, the butchers are prevented from
selling their beef and mutton off their hands, and
this hot weather continues, butchers' meat will
soon get still higher.
OUR FACETIOUS FRIENDS.
Punch has sometimes been found fault with both by ignorant and
timid persons, for venturing to poke his fun at our near and dear
allies (who might be held still dearer if they were not so expensive
to us). Stupid people say the French don't understand a jest, while
timid ones declare they are so thin skinned and so sensitive that they
cannot take good humonredly a harmless laugh at their expense; and,
as an element of enmity, one might as well propose to crack a rifle as a
joke at them. How far away from truth are these absurd Britannic
notions, may be shown by this brief extract from one of the few dozens
of French pamphlets lately published, which by their friendly tone and
truthfulness have by no means less astonished than they have delighted
us:—
"It is absolutely esacntlal to the existence of the British Empire that the entire
class of peasants of Ireland should be maintained In a condition which renders
them perfectly docile and easy to decimate when they grow too numerous, or not
disposed to bring recruits to the army. They who are of opinion that the English
is the barest and most horrible tyranny which over scandalised the earth will
probably form the wish that her indispensable support, Ireland, shall be taken from
her."
The statement that "the English is the basest and most horrible
tyranny which ever scandalised the earth" is really, to our thinking,
so exquisitely ludicrous that one might fancy that the force of funning
could no further go, were it not for the still funnier remark directly
following it. But that Ireland should be viewed as really being
England » "indispensable support" is an idea which is so flattering as
well as so facetious, that we should almost feel inclined to give the
writer an engagement did not the interests of our readers prohibit such
a course.
THE STOOL THAT "WAS NOT MEANT TO BE STOOD
UPON.
Our Premier he made a Precedents' stool,
With three legs, as neat as could be,
Out of old Hatsell wood, the workmanship good,
And the turning masterlie.
Then up came Gladstone, full of wrath,
Brimming o'er with a speech so fine,
"Let me mount this stool, the House to school,
And deliver this soul of mine."
"Now nay—now nay," quoth the Premier gay,
"Thy speech thou may'st speak anon;
But this stool, my friend, thou mayst not ascend,
'Tis not meant for standing on."
Then up and spake grim Gladstone,
And he smote the board till it rang—
"A stool with three legs, and none of 'em pegs
Whereon a speech to hang!
"I leave yon to sink—I leave you to swim,
As pleases Disraeli,
But the place where such cabinet-work is done,
Is no longer the Place for me."
Then up he rose, and shook bis clothes,
And clapped the chamber-door—
Which as Ministere to that sely Peer
He never entered more!

You cats and dogs, which, till July,

The weather's turned to fine.
Dark clouds consales the Zun no more,

Zo now we zells our hay in store,
And cuts our crops of grass.
The sky is butcher's blue agen; the showers have sased to fall,
We farmers bain't a gwaian to be rhuan'd arter all.
'Twas bad for cattle and for ship,

But then bastes' valley rose;
And fodder was as high as mate;
Sitch times was never know'd.
Here zum on us was zellun whate
At fifteen pound a load!
Hut things must now come down, because the showers have sased

Yet still I hopes as how we shan't be rhuan'd arter all.
There's them as thirst o' gain betrays,

But happy is the man, I says,
As doan't hold on too long.
I zold my stock at famine-rates;
Here's plenty now in view!
I hopes as I med say, my mates,
It is the same wi' you.
The crops is all fast thrivun now the showers have sased to full;
YVe shan't, at laste not all on us, be rhuan'd arter all.
When harvest, feared for all the spring,
A good un proves to be,
That there I calls the sart o' thing,
That's just the time for we I
Then in the pockets there's the gold,
The grain is in the barn;
There's last year's proddus all well sold,
In hand there's this un's cam:
And if we rapes abundance now the showers have sased to fall;
This time I spose we fellers shan't be rhuan'd arter all.
So now as wet gives place to dry,
And dark makes way for shine,
"Success to Farmun! is the cry
We '11 drink in chape French wine.
The twoast is what in strong old ale
We used to drink afore,
But now new-fangled slops prevail,
They brews good beer no more.
But push about the clarut, since the showers have sased to fall,
And sing, the jolly farmers wun't be rhuan'd arter all.
A PROFESSIONAL PROTEUS WANTED.
The advertisers daily grow more queer in their requirements, and
by no means the least strange are those connected with the theatres,
where novelty of any kind is always in request. We take the following,
for instance, from the columns of the Era, which are constantly sup-
plying something funny of this sort:—
WANTED, for an ENTERTAINMENT, a Professional Gentleman of
Versatile Powers, to play with a Lady. A good figure mid i>crBonal appearance
indispensable. Age not over Thirty. Characters to be sustained :—A Young, and
an Elderly Gentleman, a Modern Fop. a Frenchman, and a Drunken Character in
Low Life. A fixed salary weekly.—Address, &c.
A gentleman must need have "powers" something more than
"versatile" to make him able to comply with all these various require-
ments. Were nothiug said about his "personal appearance," the
task might indeed be much more easy of accomplishment. But although
it may be proper for him to be possessed of a good figure" to enable
him successfully to "play with a lady," it seems to us that this would
not be an advantage to him when appearing as a "drunken character
in low life," and he must indeed be a most skilful pantomimist to
undertake the transformation scenes which seem to be required of him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW SONG TO THE OLDEST TUNE AS IS.
(See Mr. Chatfeu/S History of Early Bnr/litK Music.)
Summer is yeomen in—
Rather late, it's true—
Groweth grain, and ceaseth rain,
And gioweth toilet new.
Salad groweth for cold lamb;
Volunteers are not wet through:
Flannel droppeth, great-coat stoppeth,
And Goloshes too!
Months two overdue,
The Summer's here!
THE ROYAL ACADEMY.
"My dear Punch,
"Threading my way through the mazes of flounce and
crinoline which fill the R. A. Exhibition, I found myself one morning
in the North Room.
"Poor Mr. Wilxins, the Architect, to whose taste and skill we are
indebted for the design of these halls, has been much abused for his
pains, but I forgive him his feeble facade and his dreary little dome,
his pepper-boxes and his pseudo-Greek portico — in short, all his
mistakes—for inventing the North Room, that cool retreat from the
crowd and bustle of the Exhibition where one can, at 9 a.m., look
at a picture in comfort, and without prejudice—to corns.
"Nor are the works exhibited in this little Sanctuary to be over-
looked or despised as an insignificant part of the show. Let gentle-
men console themselves who are condemned to be hung (I allude, of
course, to their paintings) in the North Room. Here their friends
can examine their canvas at leisure; and as for dignity, are not Hunt,
Pickersgill, and Richmond, good company for any of usP The
fact is, that crowds rush through the larger rooms to see A.'s famous
Allegory, and B.'s grand Battle-piece, or struggle to get a peep at the
exquisite portraits by Daubnbt. Suppose this or that picture is
praised,—let us say in The Connoisseur, or the Propylamm, well—
it naturally becomes popular, and the British Public elbows its way
up to it in admiration. It is the correct thing to do. I don't say
this out of spite, though my Coronation of Amalasuntha was rejected.
—I,hope I'm above envy—but such is the case. When, on the other
hand, I see any one in the North Room straining his neck here or
there, and anxiously turning over the leaves of his catalogue, I feel
pretty sure he is looking for a friend's picture, or is guided by his
own eesthetical instinct. And surely there is a sufficient variety in this
room to suit all tastes, from the simple truth and grace expressed
in Mr. Morris's Voices from the Sea, to the dismal text of Mr.
Stirling's Revival Sermon. The former (537) is an English coast
scene. A young wife and mother listens to her husband s farewell
shout as his boat scuds out to sea. Her ruddy children play beside
her, and one young rascal has run knee-deep into the water to catch
the last sound of his father's voice. It is a pretty, unaffected subject,
to which the painter has done justice; and—Oh, if Mr. Stirling
had but chosen euch a one, instead of depicting the horrors of a
'Revival,' we should not have had to look at—
"A pastor anathematising his flock,
While Stiggins stands by in a dirty white stock,
And rears a placard. Sitting under is seen
A flunkey; his coat is of emerald green,
And crimson his breeches. Significant leers
This worthy bestows on a damsel in tears,
With a polychromatic and Brummagem shawl.
While a juvenile version of Samuel Hall
Attacks (most unjustly, it must be confest,)
His companion, attired in a bright yellow vest.
A reporter, 'got up' in low comedy style,
Is dotting down notes. An eccentric old file.
Sits watching the preacher. Observe in the rear
How the 'fruits' of the sermon begin to appear.
There's a girl in hysterics, with terror dismayed,
While an anxious M.D. makes a rush to her aid.
Thus fanatical froth, flirting, fighting, and fainting,
Form the subject of this—most remarkable painting.*
"The title of Ivory and Ebony is given by Mr. Ercole to (4S3)
a picture representing a fair damsel in an unexceptionable brocaded
dress, attended by a nigger, who carries a plate of fruit. The contrast
* An ingenious friend of mine, the author of several very clevor (and eminently
unsuccessful) poems, has. at my request, just dashed off these lines to show you what
night be done in the way of metrical critiques. Artists will be pleased to remem-
ber, that his terms are moderate, and inclusive of boer. Pra>Raphaelito notices
executed in Mediaeval type, and Royal Academicians waited upon at their own
residences. Address, Scriblkrus, care of Mr. Catnach, Ac.
is pretty, and the idea of 'Ebony' bearing apples has, at least, the
merit of novelty.
"Mr. Ertvood's First Place deserves a better one on the Exhi-
bition walls. It is exquisitely finished, down to the very dust-pan
which the poor housemaid has laid aside for a few tearful moments
before she begins her day's work.
"Love Knouts no Sleep (531), by Mr. W. Williams, represents a
flirtation between a young lady at an open window who is slipping a
letter into the hand of her lover as he leans through the casement.
If Love knows no sleep, the fair creature in question appears well
aware that, at least, her Mamma is dozing. As for the gent, in the
Balmoral bonnet, there is no doubt that he is tolerably wide awake.
"(541), The Outrage upon Sir John Coventry, affords Mr. Magdire
a capital bit of melodramatic incident for illustration. Poor Sir
John appears hard pressed in the Sa sa encounter. He placed
himself against the wall (so runs the story), and thus, though foes
attacked him in front, he had bricks to back him. Two heavy villains
are already disarmed, and Sir J. is laying about him bravely. It is
a curious fact, that though Coventry was least likely of all to show
the white feather, he is the-only cavalier in the picture who wears one.
"To criticise The Critics would be hardly fair, nor, if Mr.
Emmerson chooses to paint from such models as are represented
on his canvas (559), has any one a right to interfere. It would be
violating the liberty of the subject, which in this instance, though a
singularly ugly one, is treated with skill. Artists will not fail to
appreciate the 'accidental repeat' of the puppy behind the chair in
the spaniel on the carpet.
"Guilty or not Guilty? asks Ma. Hayllar. . apropos of his picture
(565), in which a fat little boy is seen standing by a Fortnum-and-
Masonic looking jar. Guilty, I. suppose, of poaching on the home
preserves.
"Mr. G. D. Leslie contributes two works, Matelda (578), and
Meditation (588). The latter represents a young lady in a brown
study and pink dress lying by a green pond. She has chosen a some-
what damp spot for her reflections. It is melancholy to think that
such a close inspection of water lilies might be attended by—lum-
bago. The other picture {Matelda), is more interesting, and has
its admirers, among whom ij your humble servant.
"Let artists take warning by the incident which forms the subject
of Mr. Hughes's picture (568), and keep their studios locked up.
Young Hopeful is here earnestly engaged in laying 'high lights'
on the nose of a lay figure, while his papa peeps round the corner,
apparently pleased with the experiment. Well—there is nothing like
encouraging youthful genius, even when manifested through the
medium of Roman white.
"One would have expected Mr. Whistler's talents to have been
developed on the flute rather than At the Piano (598). Neverthe-
less, the painting of that title shows genius. The tone which he has
produced from his piano is admirable, and he has struck on it a chord
of colour which will I hope find an echo in his future works.
"The South Room is, as you know, chiefly devoted to the exhibition
of Architectural designs, the critique on which I have no doubt has
been so ably conducted by my eminent friend, Mr. T. Squarer, else-
where, that further comment would be superfluous. There are, how-
ever, some portraits here to which I would willingly allude. It would
be a pleasure to linger before the miniatures of Messrs. Wells and
Moiba, and note the grace and artistic skill in the water-colour
portraits by Mr. Moore, but it is time to close my letter.
"As I descended from the R. A. Rooms, after looking at the thou-
sand and ninety-sixth Work of Art there exhibited, I passed through
the Condemned Cell—I mean the room devoted to rejected contri-
butions. Alas! for the vanity of human hopes! There lay dear
Smith's grand compositions, and the produce of poor Brown's brains
and paint-pot; and the heartless porter grinned as he looked down
upon the debris. Old Massicot had just dropped in to fetch away
his portraits, and indulging in some rather forcible and—and cursory
remarks on the Establishment in Trafalgar Square, I regret to say,
disparaged even the divine Art itself as an unprofitable occupation.
I wonder is it better that men should find their own level in
this great struggle of life, or keep buoyed up to the last in the com-
fortable but delusive hope of ultimate success P What becomes of the
thousands who are thrown down in the crowd, or the thousands who,
seeing the blows, and buffets, and vexation, turn, and walk quietly
away P
"Is there no sanctuary—no refuge for these t unfortunates—the
Great Disappointed?
"I think if 1 had ten, twenty, or say thirty thousand a-year, I
would endow such an asylum. I would welcome them all. The
briefless barrister: the painter who has no patron; the parson to
whom no one will give a living; the doctor in search of practice;
the author whose tragedy no manager will accept; captains who
want promotion; governesses without a place—what a pleasant little
society we might nave, and—and how soon we should get tired of
each other! „ PaithfuUy TOUrs>

CHAPTER XXII. —PERIOD —THE REIGN OF HENRY THE
THIRD.
ut little change of costume
occurred in this long reign,
and we may therefore make
short work of what we have
to say about it. This in-
deed we are the more at,
liberty to do, having, with
our usual gallantry, ac-
corded place aux dames,
and described in our last
Chapter the dresses of the
ladies. To come now to
their lesser halves (who
through crinoline are now-
a-days dwindling down to
less than quarters), we leave
our artist to depict a Por-
trait of a Gentleman, as he
would doubtless have ap-
peared at the It. A. Exhibi-
tion, had the Academy been
opened in the thirteenth
century.
The reader will perceive
from this artistic work, at
least if his perception be
aided by our pen, that the
chiefly novel points about
the male dress of this period
were, that the robe was
somewhat fancifully slit, or
slashed, or slittered,* and
that the boots were fretted, again worn with long toes. The robe was
called a "quintis," or "cointise," from this slashing, the
in French meaning fanciful or freak-
ish: epithets which almost seem
too mild to be applied to men who
had their coats cut all to bits before
they'd wear them. Such dandies
might have fitly worn strait-waist-
coats with their robes, and hare
been vested with the right to sit in
the "Mad Parliament."
Another point to which we may
direct attention is, that drawers
were worn in this reign, so as to
be visible; the tunic being open
as high up as the waist, that the
right leg might be left more free
to be put forward. This fashion
must have specially found favour
with the youug, for they must have
found it difficult to "over" posts,
or fly the garter, when their tunics,
like old Jones's coat, were "all
buttoned down before."
A garment called a "cyclas" is
first mentioned in this reign: the
city swells who were invited to
King Henry's Coronation wear-
ing, we are told, "cyclades worked
with gold over vestments of ricli
silk." The cyclas, it would seem,
was a sort of upper tunic, and de-
rived its name from the stuff which
it was made of. This was called
"cyclas," from being manufactured
chiefly in the Cyclades, and not be-
cause, as has been fancied, it was
first made for sick ladies.
Another new material was a rich silk woven with gold, which was
known as cloth of Baldekins, from its being made at Baldeck, as
Babylon was then called. In fact the tailors of this period appear to
have done more in introducing new materials than in altering the
fashions, and their poverty of invention was atoned for in some

measure by the richness of their stuffs. The effigy of the King on
his monument at Westminster (on view for a few coppers to the Dean
and Chapter), represents him, as is usual, in his royal robes; consist-
ing simply of a tunic, made rather long and full, and a mantle which
is fastened by a brooch on the
right shoulder. The most splen-
did things about him are certainly
liis boots, which are, like a surly
miser, fretted with gold; each
square of the fret having the
ure of a lion in it, with its tail
put out of joint and twisted level
with its back.
Mantles and cloaks were only
used on state occasions and in
travelling; for which latter use a
kind of over-all was worn, called
:i nuper-totus, in the Latin of the
monks. This was an improve-
ment on the capa, or Norman
cloak, not only being bigger, but
having sleeves as well as hood.
It was likewise called balandraiia. by monks, who liked fine names;
and under this title (derived from the French balandran, a foul-weather
cloak), monks of the or-
der of St. Benedict were
ordered not to wear it.
Why they were so is a
question which is open to
our guessing, and we
may fancy if we like,
for there is nobody to
hinder us, that, perhaps,
the Benedictines were
chary of lavation, and so
a ducking now and then
was thought conducive to
their health.
With regard to the ca-
pillary fashions of this
reign we find that men
in general were tolerably
close shavers, but that
they mostly wore thtir
hair in flowing curls, at
least if tbey could any
how prevail on it to grow
so. Cowls or hoods were
used for head-cover, and
so were small round caps
and hats, the latter not
unlike the old "beaver "of our youth, but which must not be con-
founded with that mentioned in the passage: —
"I saw young Harry with his boavor on."
A white coif tied under the chin was, however, worn most commonly
by men out hunting and on horseback, who, as shown in the old draw-
ings, bear some likeness to the cockneys we have seen uuhorsed at
Epping, with their handkerchiefs tied round their heads to take the
place of their lost hats.
The historian Matthew Paris, the Monk of St. Alban's, favours
us with some descriptions of the fashions of this period, and proclaims
himself disgusted with the fopperies he witnessed. It seems, how-
ever, somewhat questionable if the clergy were in general of this
austere opinion: for their garments for the most part were so fop-
pishly enibroidered, that Pope Innocent the Fourth is said to
have exclaimed: "0 England! thou garden of delights, thou art truly
an inexhaustible fountain of riches! From thy abundance much may
be exacted!" What reporter there was present when he made tiiis
observation the chronicles do not enable us to say; and indeed we
rather question if Pope Innocent was such an innocent as to talk
about exactions, however much inclined he might be, possibly, to make
them. That he was rather so disposed we find from certain bulls
which he despatched to several English prelates, enjoining them to
send him a quantity of vestments, for the use (at least he says so) of
the priests who were at Rome. Many of these habits are described
as being " covered with gold and precious stones," whde others were
"embroidered with the figures of animals and flowers;" so that the
English priests who were deprived of these "beautiful vestments"
might have lamented them as did the priest of our St. George's-in-the-
East.
We may note here that the red hat Punch so often has poked fun at
was, as it appears, a bright invention of this Innocent: and was
presented by His Innocence (what a rare name for a Pope I) to the
Cardinals who came to the Council of Lyons, held, as everybody

knows, in the year 1245. According to De Curbio, they wore it for
the first time in the twelvemonth following, at an interview between
His Innocence and Kino Louis
the Ninth. The hat when first
invented was not made witli a flat
brim, as it is at present, but was
moulded to the fashion of the
mouth of a French horn, and
looked like an old wide-awake
knocked rather out of shape.
During Henry's reign it was
that the Dominicans, or preaching
friars, and the Franciscans, or
friars minor, were established in
Hi Is country. From their black
cloak and capuchon the first were
called Black Friars (Cox de Fins-
hurt is wrong in saying they were
called so because they made their
hands black in frying their parched
peas): while the Franciscans had
the title of Grey Friars applied to
them, because, like many of our
Riflemen, they preferred to dress
in grey. Calumny has hinted that
these reverend old fathers were
somewhat prone to the enjoyment
of mundane creature comforts, albeit they affected to hold them in
contempt; and this suspicion, we must own, is supported by the
passage:—
Ett bag a JFrnat of ortttrrs (Grapr,"

THE LADIES' OWN RIFLE CORPS.
"Honeysuckle House, ITampstead,
am sure, my dear Mr. Punch, that
you who so zealously keep watch
over our national defences, and
have been so warm a friend to our
gallant Volunteers, will be glad
to hear that steps are being taken
by which a great accession will be
soon made to their ranks, and the
security of England be perfectly
ensured. With a view to this
result it is intended to get up a
Rifle Corps for Ladies, and arrange-
ments are on foot by which the
petticoats may everywhere be
pressed into the service, and
some thousands of good feminine
effectives be enrolled.
"I dare say you may smile at
the notion of weak women volun-
teering to defend themselves, and
boasting that they mean to come
out thousands strong. But you
know one doesn't want much
strength to pull a trigger, and as
for skill, I'm sure we women very
often get the better of you men.
If ladies can shoot pheasants, as
the papers say they do, they surely
might soon learn to aim at larger animals and be as deadly in a battle
as they are in a battue. And I'm sure they can't do better than take
pattern by Her Majestt, who hit the middle of the bull's eye at four
hundred miles range (wasn't it P) and showed herself undoubtedly the
first shot of the day. Moreover, if they be not so destructive with
their rifles as the shooters who belong to the coarser-sinewed sex. they
have other weapons always at command, which would do good exe-
cution upon any hostile ranks. Their ocular artillery is ever ready
primed, and when it is well served what foe could hope to face it P I
should like to see the Frenchman who would dare to keep his ground
when the ladies' corps were ordered to put on their killing looks, and
to set their rifle caps at him!
"Besides, Sir, there are sanitary reasons to allure us, and good
health you know is needful to the keeping of good looks. I'm sure
the exercise of drill is doing wonders for you men, and I can't see
why we women should not also take advantage of it. You do look so
much better now that you've been taught to hold your backs straight

and your heads up, and to keep your legs free from that sluggish sort
of slouch, and your hands from that eternal fumble in those hateful
prgtop pockets. I declare young Mr. Moneybags (whom Mamma
Kuuld make me dance with, don't you know, at Lady Squaubleton's)
whs positively hideous until he took to drill, and now he's grown so
handsome that really when he called the other day I hardly knew him!
11 was very rude of Ma to compliment him as she did on the improve-
<.;< xt in his looks, but I'm sure that he deserved it, and really his
moustache is getting on quite visibly, and if rifle practice gives one
such a healthy, clear complexion, I'm sure that many girls I know
would be the better for it. Laura Pertly would for one, and as a
friend I should advise her to try a dose of drilling before she throws
bar sheep's eyes any more at Ma. M., who (I've heard him say) can't
bear those tallowy, flabby faces, which look as though one could make
dokes in them, as children do in putty.
"So we ladies, Mr. Punch, intend to go to drill as you do, aud
although we may be awkwardish at first, you must bear in mind, Sir,
what you were yourself,* and must not laugh at us for treading in
>our goose steps. The drill will be a healthy exercise for girls, and
i here's no reason why it should not be as fashionable as dancing. Aud
s", say I, let ladies put their best foot foremost, and for the mere sake
of the exercise join the Kille Movement. Let them get up Rifle
Meetings in the lieu of Archery, and take to burning powder instead
of midnight ball lamps. You old grumblers keep on growling that
we women want employment. Now, if we started Rifle Corps, you'd
have to hold your tongues, I think; for judging by the time you spend,
or rather that you say you spend, on marches and parades, and club
meetings, and drills, I'm sure that if we ladies only do as you do,
there 'II be very little seen of us at home, Sir, and you'll have no cause
for twitting us with want of occupation.
"And so, Sir, hoping next year to compete for the Ladies' Prize at
Wimbledon, believe me to remain,
"Your constant reader and admirer,
"Angelina Smith."
"P.S. Don't you think that mauve would look nice for our uniform,
with rose-colour cuffs and facings, and pheasant's feathers in our
caps P I rather fancy, though, that some of us would like all scarlet
better, for the last thing women wish for is to make themselves
invisible."
• Dou't bo personal, young lady, and consult your dictionary. Thoro is no such
word as " awkwardish' existing iu tho language, and if there were, it is impossible
that We should over be doscribed by it,—Punch.
MURDER ON THE PLATFORM.
Mr. Bright's Organ played the following pleasing little air last
Saturday:—
"On Thursday evening Count Rudio (so well-known as being connoctcd with the
late attempt to assassinato the Emperor of the French) gave a looture at tho
Assembly Rooms, Nottingham. Mr. Clark presided. Tho Count gave a detailed
history of the conspiracy iu which he had been engaged. . . Ho (the Count) had
attempted tyrannicide for tho benefit of his fellow-creatures and tho punishra ent « f
a great crime. As his hearers well knew, the attompt was defeated, .and his bravo
friond. Oksini, iwrishcd on tho scaffold. The modem hero spared him (the speaker)
as a cat spared a mouse—only to torturo it. No tongue could describe the.sufferings
he underwent, and how ho survived he could not tell. The lecturer concluded by
giving a narrative of his cscai>e from the penal settlement to which he had been
condemned, and his journey to England. He then rebuked uia seat amid loud
cheers."
All things considered, Mr. Punch is not exactly delighted with the
above information. His own admiration for the Emperor of the
French is known to be excessive, and this may make Mr. Punch unduly
sensitive. But he cannot help thinking that " the Orsini attempt"
was an abominable and dastardly crime, by which the destruction of
innocent persons might have been accomplished, and that Count
Rudio's brave friend" was a cowardly assassin, who well deserved
to lose his head. Count Rudio is lucky to have escaped, and would
show himself more worthy of his good luck did he abstain from
exhibiting himself to Englishmen as a murderer in intention. Mr.
Punch suspects the "loud cheers" to have been an invention of
the penny-a-liner, but if Rudio were really cheered, the Notting-
ham audience must have permitted their compassion for a foreigner
and an exile to triumph over their sense of decency. Mr. Bright's
paper publishes the statement without a word of reprobation or
regret, but this Mr. Punch takes to be merely an instance of the
habitually careless editing of the penny press, and not an indication
that Rudio is regarded as a hero by Mr. Bright's editor. Mr. Punch,
however, on behalf of his country, at once signifies to Europe, that
English detestation of the Dagger-School almost equals English
detestation of the systems of tyranny that provoke ill-regulated minds
to Murder, and that we have a different platform from that of an
assembly-room for the benefit of those who break the Sixth Com-
mandment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WOKK FOR "WOMAN.
Wiut arc we to do with our young women? is a question which is
now beginning to be seriously asked by the benevolent, and by Pater-
familias. Thanks to the prevalent taste for a profusion of finery,
combined with a rising Income-Tax, girls are getting too dear, that is
to ?ay too expensive, creatures, to find husbands. Under these cir-
cumstances there has been formed a Society for the Employment of
Women. It met, the other evening at 19, Langham Place, the E.uu,
or Shaftesbury in the Chair. Among various recommendations
and suggestions for the accomplishment of its gallant and generous
object,—
"Mr. Cooksow urged law-engrossing as a suitable occupation for women,
described tho office established by the Society, which 1b at present supported by
Bc-vcral solicitors, and gave an interesting account of che work done there.'
This is a very good notion. Young ladies are generally fond of
writing. Employed in lawyers' offices they will turn to profitable
account a propensity which now merely wastes ink and paper. The
female copying clerk, who supports herself by her quill, will no longer
pen a billet, when she should engross. Some caution must be exercised
by the solicitor's official handmaiden lest she should, at first starling,
spoil some quantity of sheepskin. She should beware of underlining
not only words and sentences which are by no means emphatic, but
also of underscoring any words whatever, and if she has a long deed to
draw up, she must mind not to cross it. These and a few other caveats
being observed, legal engrossing may doubtless suit a young lady as
well as the at least equally engrossing care of a family.
The in xt. notion is sufficiently reasonable :—
M Mr. Hastings spoke of printing as peculiarly well adapted for women, and read
a paper contributed by Misa Emily Faithfqll, on the introduction of women into
the printing trades."
There is more pie capable of affording employment to ladies' fingers
than that which is usually associated with pudding. Milliners are
accustomed to the making up of caps and bonnets, but there are caps,
if not bonnets, in a printing-office, which the fair sex might set up as
well us those that they are accustomed to construct of lace and artificial
(lowers; they might compose both small caps and large caps in books,
if not in book-muslin. Authors will generally be in favour of a change
which will occasionally afford them visits from the printer's angel—
angelic visits not too few and far between.
A gentleman instrumentally indicated a void in female education,
which might be advantageously filled :—
"Mr. Mackenzie read a paper by Miss J. Boucherett on book-keeping, stating
that a want of knowledgo of accounts was one great reason of tho disinclination to
employ women in shops, showiug bow they might bo fitted for tho offices of cashiers
ana bookkeepers, and announcing that a school to supply those deficiencies bad
been opened by the 8ociety."
Marble and chalk being essentially the same substance, except that
the former excels the latter in density, there is every reason to hope
that due education would soon convert the marble brow of Beauty into
a good "chalk head." A little of that attention to arithmetic which
girls are accustomed to devote to their figures, would soon qualify
them for a seat on the highest stool, or a position behind the counter of
a first-rate banking establishment whence on returning home the fair
cashier, if musical, might sit down to her piano and sing, "1 Know a
Bank" to the no small comfort of her family.
We see also that—
*' Vice-chancellor Wood spoke of other occupations for women, and recom-
mended that they should be employed as clerks in post-offices, and as managers of

Very good. The occupation of hair-dresser in particular is one
peculiarly suitable to young persons of the gentler sex. Their fingers
are much better adapted to the scissors than those of the male fisL and
especially to scissors in relation to the gentleman's real head of hair
or peruke, whether visible or invisible. There are cases, however, in
which the customer might be disposed to practise retaliation to the
extent of a curl, on the head of a ministering Belinda, or rather,
perhaps, we may say Barbara, by the leave of Joe Miller. If young
ladies very generally take to the hair-dressing line, it may be appre-
hended that the Swells and Nobs, and the Nobs of Swells, will

Sharp-Shooting Extraordinary.
It is remarkable that, at the late grand Rifle Shooting Match very
great numbers of ties were shot off. These will perhaps be conjectured
to be the ties of civilians; as the Rifle Volunteers all wear stocks.

or some other great maritime nation.
Unfounded Report.—There is no truth in the rumour

Contest, which last week came off at the Crystal Palace.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 9. Monday. "Answer a Normanby according to his Norman-
byism," is a Solomonionism whereof Lord Brougham lost sight
to-night, for he took the trouble to make a wise and earnest reply to
some ridiculous cackle of the old N, directed against Garibaldi.
Brougham certainly expressed marvellous contempt, both for the
sources of Normanby's information and the argument he set tottering
upon it; but some elegant little colloquialism like " Shut up" would
have been the more fitting response to twaddle.
Lord Palmerston bad recently informed a deputation of Con-
servatives, who came to him on the Census Bill, that be should
certainly adhere to the proposed inquiry as to a person's Religious
Profession. Nobody was therefore surprised, in the present delightful
state of unanimity in the Cabinet, to bear to-night that two days later
Government would state their intentions on that subject. It should
be mentioned that the Dissenters, being excessively averse to this
return, bad been bringing all their influence to bear upon Members in
order to get the provision expunged. Mb. Cowper said that he had
no "present intention" of making a road through Kensington Gardens
to join Tyburnia and Belgravia, as desired by the Swells, to whom,
they having horses and carriages, it is of no earthly consequence
whether they have to make a detour or not, whereas it is of great
consequence to pedestrians that one of the few beautiful walks they
have should not be cut up by a noisy dusty road. Mr. Punch has a
present intention of inflicting a future whack upon Mr. Cowper's
Nob, if he listens to the Nobs on this point. The other alteration, the
giving a better ride to hard-worked gentlemen who take their consti-
tutional gallop in Rotten Row, will be so agreeable to Mr. Punch
himself, that he approves it at once, and Mr. Cowper need not bother
himself about Mr. Edwin James's reclamations on that subject.
The Attorney-General having magnanimously forgiven the House
for its foolish meddling with his Bankruptcy Bill, proposed to proceed
therewith, with alterations made necessary by the Anti-transfer-of.com-
pensation-from-the-suitors-to-the-consolidated-fund-Vote. But he pro-
tested against the way in which his Liberal friends snapped at and
impeded the Bill, and declared that unless confidence were reposed in
him, and he was credited with knowing something about the merits and
operation of a measure to which he had devoted his best energies, there
would be no chance of passing the Bill. After this very reasonable
and temperate remonstrance the Committee went to work, and got on
fairly, though Mb. Bouverie, "the Prig," emitted petulance, and
caught a good slash from the ready whip of Palmerston, which did
Bouverie temporary good. Late in the night the Committee stopped
at about the eightieth clause, a heap of Bills were shoved ahead, and
Mr. Hennesst, taking a division on an Irish question, found himself
in a minority of one to seventeen. But we should do that modest
gentleman an injustice if we left it to be supposed that he considered
that a minority in wisdom, authority, influence, or any other Parlia-
mentary attribute.
Tuesday. In both Houses Ministers stated that orders had been sent
to our naval commanders to interfere for the prevention of further
atrocities in Syria. News arrived, during the week, that they had done
so promptly, at Beyrout. The hostilities of the savage inhabitants of
the country are not, mainly, based on religious hatred, but on enmities
of races, and are fomented by the agents of other nations whose rulers
desire the embarrassment and dismemberment of Turkey.
Lord Raynham appealed to Sib G. C. Lewis to remit a whipping
to which some Hertfordshire criminal had been sentenced, but Sir
George, having inquired into the facts, said that the flagellation had
been particularly well deserved. Doctob Brady wanted a Committee
to inquire into an alleged grievance committed against a Doctob
Macloughun forty years ago, and was duly squashed by the Monster,
Mb. Sidney Herbert. There is a Bill before the House for making
the Gas Companies behave with some sort of fairness and honesty, at
which those Companies being naturally indignant, obtained the advo-
cacy of Mb. Staniland, who, as Viscount Williams novelly and
beautifully said, tried to throw a little less light upon the subject than
we had before. Mr. Staniland, in a long speech, did his work so
exceedingly well, that when the public perceives that such capital
management can make no more of the case, the Gas Tyrants will find
their pipes put out. All the lact in the world will never make people
believe that Companies ought to charge high for bad gas, and then
because they have a monopoly of the supply, ought to insult customers
who remonstrate. A good deal of uncharitableness having been
shown on the Roman Catholic Churches Bill, the Commons rose, after
sitting thirteen hours.
Wednesday. A day of victory to the Dissenters. The Home Secre-
tary, on the fourt h clause of the Census Bill, made a speech in which
he showed that in all civilised states it was held desirable to know the
respective proportions of religious sects, that such returns were
obtained in nearly every European country, in some of our colonies,
VOL. ZXJUX.

and in Ireland, that there was no intention of favouring the Church of
England by untruthfully swelling her numbers, and that the intended
Census would be damaged and left imperfect by the proposed aban-
donment of the inquiry as to religious profession. But as Mb,
Bainis and the opponents of the inquiry commanded a great many
votes, "were the Masters of Twenty Legions" was the classical
Home Secretary's classical phrase, he should withdraw the penalty on
the non-return. In order to make things perfectly pleasant, Sir
George added, that the Mahommedans in India, who had formerly
disapproved of a Census, because it involved inquiries into domestic
arrangements, had become enlightened enough to waive that objection,
and to make the return, which showed that "sentimental objections"
might be overcome, and he hoped that some of these days the Dissenters
would be as sensible as the Mahommedans, with which placebo he gave
up the point to which Lord Palmerston had pledged himself to stick.
His sarcasms, of course, told, especially on those eminent religionists,
Mr. Bernal Osborne and Mr. Kim is James, and some other leading
Dissenters, who considered the philosophical Whig's cynical remarks as
extremely ungracious. Mr. Henley was, and took care to show him-
self, a good deal amused at the Mohammedan hit, and Lord Robert
Cecil mentioned, that the Dissenters, on occasion of the last. Census,
made false returns, Zoar lending its morning congregation to Ebenezer
for the afternoon, and Ebenezer and Zoar both joining Ichabod in the
evening, so as to make a good show in the returns, and moreover that
all three stated their habitual congregations at much larger numbers
than could be got into those pleasantly named chapels. A suspicion of
such practice would now, Lord Robert amicably added, attach to the
whole Dissenting body. Mr, Whiteside, of course, said that the
Dissenters were afraid of the results of the Census, and Lord Palmer-
ston, having assured the malcontents that Sir George had not meant
to be uncivil, said for himself, that he yielded out of deference to the
Dissenters' feelings, though he could not assent to their arguments.
So there is rejoicing in Zoar, and in Ebenezer, and in Ichabod, and
in neither, let Mr. Punch add, does he believe that any of the imputed
falsification was or will be resorted to. Himself an eminent Dissenter,
and one who
"Hates moat people, and dislikes the rest,"
he can afford to be perfectly impartial. He wishes his beloved
brethren of all sects were more charitable, as it gives him great
trouble to be always banging their heads and bringing them into a
proper and kindly frame of mind.
Thursday. The House of Commons having protested, in the Reso-
lutions of last week, upon the subject of the Lords' Rejection of the
Paper-Duty Bill, Lord Brougham took upon himself to set up a
counter-protest, and stated that the House of Lords had a perfect
right to do what it had done. He introduced this, apropos of a little
Jew Bill, for further smoothing the Mosaic pavement of the way into
the House of Commons.
Admiral Walcott, complaining of the unfinished state of the
Nelson Column, was told by Mr. Cowper that Sir Edwin Landseer
was engaged on the Lions, and that his attachment to animals and to
the Constitution would doubtless induce him to make first-rate British
Lions Talking of statuary, when are the railings round Charles
Primds coming away, as promised f Are the directions being reserved
to he given in Cowper's Jointer Morning Walk?
There was a long aud curious Foreign Debate, in the course of which
Mr. Kinglakb (who is remarkably well informed on foreign matters,
and somehow gets news in advance uf the Government) stated that the
Emperor of thb French bad offered the Emperor of Austria to
give him back Lombardy, if he would assent to France's claiming the
Rhenish Provinces. To which the younger Emperor indignantly
replied, "1 in i German Prince," and moreover told the Regent
or Prussia of the offer. Mr. Kinglakb further said that Louis
Napoleon kept, up an agitation in every country of Europe, ready to
be blown into flame when he wanted a row. Having mentioned the
topic of such agitation in several countries, the speaker came to
Eugland, aud after a significant pause, and somebody's cry of "Ire-
land," he said that the Emperor's hopes, in regard to Ireland, were
partly based upon what could be done by a Member of that House, not
then present. It was made clear that the Party who was to deliver
over England to the Emperor, was Mr. John Bright. We are
happy to add that Mr. Bright, who was just lighting a remarkably
full-flavoured cigar in the smoking-room, was instantly arrested, and
being taken off to the Westminster Sessions House, was at once tried
by a jury composed one-half of Quakers and the other of officers in
the Guards, and being found guilty, was allowed a quarter-of-an-hour
to repent and finish his tobacco, and having done both, and declared
that lie died in the principles of the Church of Rome, was forthwith
executed upon that remarkable erection which stands before the Broad
Stucluary Chambers, and reminds one of the last scene in the Dead
Heart. His remaius were given to Mr Bowter, except his hat, winch
has been set upon the Town Hall in Birmingham. So the Emperor
op the French Iihs been delea'ed on the Khine and on the Thames,
and so perish all Queen Victoria's enemies!
The Monster asked for a vote of £3,800,000 for the Chinese War,
but the House was in that cranky humour which one sometimes sees
in crusty benefactors, who will give you a £100 note and refuse you a
penny that you wanted to take off the chimney-piece to save getting
change in buying a Queen's-head. Mr, Herbert could get only
£3,356,104, after a debate. But, in the same crankified crustifiea
spirit, the House gave him the balance, £443,896 the very next evening,
after another debate, in which divers persons, not in a very dignified
manner, sought to throw upon one another the responsibility of the
Chinese war, and others, not in a very patriotic manner, protested
against it altogether. Very late in the night, or shall we say early next
day, Lord Palmerston made a capital fight with some Irishry, who
moved repeated adjournments; but he held out, laughed at them, told
them to go to bed," told them, when reduced to 7. to show that there
were Seven Wise Men in the country, and finally beat them, and
carried the point he wanted. This was at four o'clock in the morning.
Friday. All the Commons'morning was given to Ireland. In the
evening there was the usual miscellany. An Irish Member declared
life and property to be unsafe in the county of Tyrone, because a
window in a chapel at Cookstown had been broken; but the Govern-
ment declined to send cavalry, infantry, or artillery, and seemed to
think a glazier might deal with the crisis. Notwithstanding that the
House had been saturated with Irish matters, some of the Members
complained that Ireland was neglected, for which ungrateful untruth
the Palmerstonian whip descended like the Flail of Talus. Punch
gives the Wiscount of Lambeth till next week to find out what that
allusion means.
BULL IN THE CHINA-SHOP, AND THE BILL TO PAY
FOR IT.
If Bulls will rush into China-shops,
And with their jars get entangled,
They should feel no dismay when they're called on to pay
For the crockery they have mangled.
In St. James's lake 'mongst the fowl that take
Their sport, are some Mandarin Geese,
And some stray ones, I fear, in Downing Street near.
Must have hatched and made increase.
The Mandarin Geese in St. James's Park,
With their quacks the babes dismay;
But the Mandarin Geese in Downing Street
At quacking can carry the day.
The House of Commons, the House of Lords,
Their ceaseless cackle fills;
And the terrible noise one the less enjoys,
That these geese have such very long Bills!
A SCOTTISH CHIEF AT WIMBLEDON.
Another feather embellishes the cap of Scotland. At the distribu-
tion of the prizes of the Rifle Association it is recorded by the Times
that Lord Elcho had the pleasure of handing the Queen's Prize of
£250 to a gentleman named Ross. Having announced that Her
Majesty meant to make the prize of which ,Mr. Ross had been the
winner an annual object of competition—
"Ho explained also that though Mr. Roks was put down In the official list as
belonging to the 7th North York, and the President had flattered himself that the
grand prize had been won by a YorkshfremaD, the winner was really much 'further
north' than Yorkshire—he was a Scotchman."
The blue bonnet of Scotland is now so full of plumes that there is
hardly room in it for another cocktail or eagle's quill. Scotchmen
will doubtless go on winning fresh honours—which they must put in
their pockets. That is easily done with £250. Lord Elcho observed
that—
"If the English Volunteers next year allowed a Scotchman to take the gold
medal, it would be a disgrace to them."
His Lordship, of course, was joking when he made the remark fore-
going. It can be no disgrace to anybody to be excelled in any branch
of human proficiency by a chiel who is one of the most highly gifted
children of Adam—a Mac Adam, properly called. If a gold medal is
to be won, a Scotchman will cert.aiuly do all that he can to win it, and
what is there which cannot be done by a canny ScotP
Mr. Ross is a Scotchman not only horn but bred. Lord Elcito
distinctly stated that "the youthful Ross had been trained by his
father, the deer-stalker, considerably north of the Tweed." There is
no doubt on that point: but if Mr. Ross had been born south of the
Thames, there is as lit tle quest ion t hat our Scot tish friends would
have claimed him for their countryman. The winner of the Quebn's
gold medal, for noble maiksmanship, will always be a Scotchman..

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A REVIVER FOR THE RIVER.
It is proverbially an ill wind
that Mows no one any good,
and the same remark applies
to ill weather in general. The
wet time we have had has
sadly tried the temper of our
grumbling friends the far-
mers, and market gardeners
too have had their spirits
somewhat damped by it.
Umbrella makers must how-
ever have been benefited,
and the venders of goloshes,
waterproofs, and clogs must,
figuratively speaking, have
made a lot of hay while the
sun has not been shining.
But nowhere has the bad
weather been productive of
more good than in the river,
which last year was in such
an ill condition. Father
Thames looks all the better
for the absence of the sun,
and Mr. Punch begs to con-
gratulate him on his marked
improvement. His face is so
much cleaner for the washing
it has had, that his most
intimate acquaintances now really hardly know him. Nor is he any longer in bad odour with
the public, for the sharpest nose can now detect no reason to turn up at him. People do
not fear infection when they chance to catch a sniff of the Bouquet de la Tamue, and even
at low water there is nothing high about him. Such a change for the better appears
almost incredible, and scarcely lives within the memory of the very oldest mudlark.
It seems the fish too have discovered how the river is revived, and have revisited the

watering places whence they have long been
banished. Carpe diem being the maxim of the
carp, they have come as far as Cbiswick and
found nothing to carp at; while dace are so
audacious as to swim close up to Chelsea. Eie
long one may expect to see boys perching upon
London Bridge to fish for perch, and to fiud
that the mud-frontage of the Temple Gardens
has been laid down with ground bait for the
benefit of the benchers. In fact, it would not
much surprise one if M.P.s took to fly-fishing
during the debates, or bobbed for eels while
smoking their cigars upon the Terrace.
To prove indeed bow wondrously the river is
improved, Mr. Punch last week went two days
following down to Greenwich, and felt all the
better for bis evenings' fishing. Speaking from
experience, .)//'. Punch may recommend a trip
to Greenwich, as being the best fishing excursion
that he knows of; and civic Izaac Waltons,
who have a relish for his namesake, may be
advised to make it the scene of their aquatic fetes.
Superfluous.
The Emferor is said to be about to esta-
blish a National Kith: Association. Considering
the case of Nice and Savoy, the Empire itself
seems something like a National Rifle Associ-
ation already—composed of Louis Napoleon,
Cavour & Company.
The New Wine Measure.—The Licensed
Wittlers describe the measure as the Wine
Licentious BilL They have good reason to
apprehend that it will prove extremely damaging
to their prophets.
TWO YOUNG MEN'S TALES.
Ever anxious to improve the public mind, Mr. Punch begs to set
before the world a couple of little stories, as told by the parties prin-
cipally interested. He finds them both in the same number 01 the
Morning Star, a fact which he mentions, inasmuch as the letter con-
taining the Pleasing Picture is the exclusive property of that journal,
and was called out by a foolish epistle from a maundering banker's-
clerk, who having married on £120 a-year, and having children, cannot
enjoy himself very expensively, and therefore thinks that his employer
ought to raise his salary. But in accordance with Mr. Punch'i incon-
ceivable veneration for the aristocracy, the Painful Picture shall have
the pa*.
In the Cambridge Insolvent Court, a few days ago,—
"Loud William Oodolpuin Osborne, son of the Duke or Leeds, applied for his
discharge. The total of his debts were stated at £1.066 6*. lid*., of wblch he stated
£352 to be without consideration. The list of creditors included tailors, tobacco-
nists, a Jew for money lent and interest, a 11 very stablo keeper, and a college tutor.
The insolvent, iu examination, stated that he was twenty-five years of age, that
until he came of age hi - fatber, the Duke, allowed him only £12 a-year, but since
he bad come of age, advanced it to £100 a-year. Bis chief debt* were I > the Jew,
contracted whilst he was at the Duke's residence at Qogniagog, near Cambridge,
In 1865 and 1856. Be had married in August, 1859, and since then had contracted
no debts. Bod no marriage settlement with his wife, and his fatber refused to
Increase his allowance.'*
Mr. Punch knows nothing of the circumstances of this unpleasant
story except from the published accounts, nor why His Grace of
Leeds has come to the conclusion that it is more to the credit of his
family that Lord Godolphin Osborne should go through incarce-
ration and the Insolvent Court for suoh a sum as £1000 than to pay
the young Lord's debts and give him a chance in married life. If
the matter were not one of public legal record, Mr. Punch, of course,
would never have alluded to it, and the "Own Correspondent" of
provincial and American papers need fear no intrusion (except from
Spiritualists) upon the monopoly of impertinent revelation of private
matters. Mr. Punch completes the story, from the published evidence,
by saying that two witnesses, a tailor and the Jew, were called, who
swore to misrepresentations by the insolvent as to his income, and
as to what he had received from them; and the Jew, as reported, says
that he was promised a hamper of plate, but that Lord Godolfhin
Osborne excused himself from getting it on a particular day "as the
butler was in the way." Unless this is a typographical error, and the
word "not" is omitted by mistake, one would like to know what
Egyptians our Hebrew thought were to have been spoiled for his
benefit. We take the report, however, as we fiud it in the Star.
After one Laxton had testified that the said butler bad stated that
such plate was non-existent, and also that Lord Godolfhin Osborne
had "sumptious" breakfasts, which were explained to mean beef-
steaks. The Judge, believing the tailor and the Jew,
"Condemned the conduct of the insolvent, knowinghe had but £100 a-year to
indulge in the luxuries mentioned, not to say vices. The insolvent had been con -
tradicted on oath by two witnesses, and he must deal with him as he would with
other persous, and under the peual clause of the Act he directed that bo should
be imprisoned for six calendar months from the date of the i
So much for the young Lord. Now let us hear a gentleman who
writes to the Star in comment upon the discontented oauker's-clerk.
We must condense his narrative a good deal, but here are the points.
He writes from the Temple, and signs himself an LL.D.:—
"At the age of twenty I took a degree in my University, and intended going to
the bar. I bad a very good property, but the extravagance and improvidence of
college lifo, and subsequently a law-suit, reduced it to £40 a-year. 1 felt 1 must
change my habits. I married and came to London, weak and delicate—1 might say
a boy. My young wife, who descended from a su{>erior rank to share the misfor-
tunes of a student, shared his resolution, too. After a few months' anxious searching
I obtained two literary engagements, which brought me.in £110 a year—one to bo
attended in the morning, the other in the evening. Bix miles of London pavement
lay hetweeu them. I took a house, as near as I could guess, in tho centre of my field
of operations, and for three years, through rain and snow and scorching sun, I
walked twelve miles a day (except Sunday} and studied forty hours a week besides."
He then describes his tiny but comfortable house at £15 a year, and
proceeds:—
"My wife, who had her waiting-maid to the hour of her clandestine marriage,
would not hear of a servant, fcshe never charred, except secretly perhaps (it was
the only causo of dispute between us), but sho washed, and smoothed, and dustod.
and marketed, and cooked to perfection. A short time elapsed, and I became a
student in the Temple. I never expended more than £10 a-year iu clothing myself,
and yet I appeared amongst gentlemen at commons rather respectably."
He did not. want the doctor, happily, thanks to exercise and early
rising, but "always fed well, on the best meat—the toiling mind
requires it." Quite true—he should see Mr. Punch't bills for venison
and turtle.
"In the second year, I had purchased sufficient choice furniture for a parlour and
bedroom ; and, above all, a select library. Tbo third yoar came, and the third
story. I was barrisrer-at-law. My seclusion ended, and so shall my chapter; only
you are authorised to tell ' G. A. P.* (the maundering clerk), that in this arduous
struggle I never received a farthing gratuity from friend or relative, and always
had a pound to spend when the accidents of my position rendered a little harmless
amusement necessary."
There is the companion picture, and Mr. Punch, whose incessant,
aim is at once to debght and to instruct, presents the two illustrations
of a young English gentleman's life, for the study of mankind in
general. He would add that if Mrs. L. L. D. (to whom he presents
his heartiest and most admiring compliments) has any sisters, several
of his best Young Men would feel profoundly obliged by an invitation
to tea.

Our sages in weather lore knowing,
Look blank at the chance of the crops,
And declare this wet summer is going
To ruin our wheat, hay, and hops.
Nor alone on our tight little island
Has Phoebus forgotten to shine,
In all climes. North or South, low or higli laud,
This year he seems out of his line.
But while anxious Europe is dreading
Short harvests, high prices, and dearth,
There's one crop, at least, that seems growing
Just where you'd least look for its birth.
That's the delicate annual, with which
Tyrants try to plant out revolution,
And to fence black Democracy's Ditch,—
By state-gardeners called Constitution."
Of all soils, it must be admitted,
That the soil of infallible Rome
Seems about the most strangely ill-fitted
For such plants to take up their home:
Yet now Pio Nono, 'tis rumoured,
Has a dwarf Constitution in hand,
In hopes Rome will grow better-humoured
In the shade where its branches expand.

And young Bombalino a-swearing

Rome, Naples, and Austria, before
Saw the plant tried in sad forty-eight.
Remembering the fruit that it bore,
Can we wonder they mutter "too late!"
What hope that the plant can grow fair,
When the roots that should nourish its seed
Are struck in a tyrant's despair,
Whose tools fail his hand at its need?
From so poisoned and festered a root,
What but poison and fester can grow?
Such a seedling will ne'er come to fruit,
Though too likely to come to a blow.
A Hint for Hippodramatists.
A Rumour is afloat, but we cannot say what grounds there are for
the report, that Mr. Horsman is engaged in composing a new opera,
illustrative of the Rarey system of horse-taming. In reference to the
instrument by which the taming is achieved, it will be called 11 Strappo

fittingly adapted from Le Cheval de Bronze, and " The Horse and his

that the report is rather a lame story, and has not a leg to stand on,
but we have not had Mr. Horsman's instructions to say Neigh to it.
CAN TOADS LIVE WITHOUT AIRP
Tnisproblem is now occupying the scientific. Mr. Punch contri-
butes his share of observation by remarking, that a party of officials,
"highly placed at the Tuileries," travelled by rail last week from
Boulogne to Paris, smoked, and kept the windows shut the whole
way. Whence it is clear that, whether toads can or can not live with-
out air, those who eat them can.

ring, the cannons
roar!
And they who never saw a Prince before,
Oh, won't they feast him and caress him!
Waylay him, and address him,
His Royal Highness—bless him!—
Their demonstrations possibly may bore.
They'll make, no doubt, a greater fuss
Than what is usually made by us
In some of our remoter parts,
Where country Corporations see,

For the first time, Her Majesty—
(May she be destined long to reign!)
When by her Parliament set free,
She travels by a stopping train,
Britannia's trump, the Queen op Hbatcts.
But still more pressing ceremony waits
The Prince in the U nited States;
What mobs will his hotel beset
A sight of him in hopes to get!
What multitudes demand
To shake him by the hand!
Hosts of reporters will his footsteps dog,
(As Baron Renprew though he goes incog.)
Take down his every word,
Describe his mouth and nose,
And eyes, and hair, and clothes,
With a minuteness quite absurd.
Ye free and easy citizens, be not rude,
Disturb not our young Prince's rest;
Upon his morning toilet don't intrude:
Wait till he *s drest.
Uh! will that Yankee not be blest
To whom the son of England's Queen shall sav
"Out of the wayP"
And, oh—to touch a tender theme—
How will the fair around him throng,
And try( forgetting all their shyness,
To salute his Royal Highness,
The realisation of a happy dream!
The force of loveliness is strong.
A spark's a 9park, and tinder tinder,
And certain thiDgs in Heaven are written;
And is there any cause to hinder
The Prince op Wales from being smitten P
Transcendent charms drive even monarchs frantic,
A German Princess must he marry P
And who can say he may not carry
One of Columbia's fascinating daughters
O'er the Atlantic?
Truth many a one might force to own,
Hopes that to her the kerchief may be flung,
To the ultimate exaltation of a young
American lady to the British throne.
PUNOH'S ESSENCE OT CONGRESS.
1860. June 4, Monday. In the Senate, the Bill for the Admission
of Kansas as a Free State, came on for discussion. The Honourable
Charles Sumner, who aboiit four years ago was brutally assaulted
by a ruffianly slave-owner named Brooks (since dead), addressed the
House for the first time since that outrage. He applied himself to
a long and elaborate argument to show the Barbarism of Slavery, and
proposed to knock out the "black marble block" which the South
declares to be the key stone of the arch of the American Constitution.
He showed, successively and successfully, that the " Domestic Insti-
tution" makes brutes of the slaves, and worse brutes of the masters
—that it checks edupation, industry, prosperity, and population—that
it generates violence, foul vice, cruelty, duelling, and ruflknism
generally—that its advocates in and out of Congress are the worst
citizens and the worst men in America—that it has been condemned
by Washington, Jepperson, and Franklin, and by all States-
men and Moralists of eminence—and that its poisonous influence is
actively working towards the destruction of the noble Republic. Mr.
Sumner's speech was chiefly characterised by its closeness of argu-
ment and lucidity of diction, but he occasionally introduced a passage
of highly wrought eloquence, or an image of singular vividness; and
in Eugland, however the orator's sentiments might have been objected
to by a political antagonist, Mr- Sumner would have received the
compliments of gentlemen on both sides, upon so remarkable an exhi-
bition of sustained power and intellectual skill.
Mr. Chestnut, of South Carolina (Slave-owner), rose, and after
abusing Mr. Sumner for "ranging over Europe, crawling through
the buck doors to whine at the feet of British aristocracy, craving
pity and reaping contempt," called him the "incarnation of malice,
mendacity, and cowardice," and declined, on the part of Slave-
ownerism, to make any reply, because he was not inclined "to send
forth the recipient of Punishment howling through the world, yelping
fresh cries of slander and malice." The punishment in question alludes
to the brutal assault with a bludgeon, committed by the now defunct
Brooks upon an unarmed and unsuspecting gentleman. The " Slave-
masters in the Senate then surrounded Mr. Chestnut, and approved
his speech." The question was postponed.
Mr. Punch begs to offer his respectful congratulations to Mr.
Sumner upon his magnificent speech, and, even more earnestly, upon
the ample and perfect, testimony that was instantly given, by the
besotted Slave-owners, to the truth of his assertion of the Barbarism
of Slavery. It is not often that an orator's enemies are in such a
desperate hurry to prove his case for him. But here he was scarcely
down when the Slave-party rushed together to proclaim themselves
the ruffians he had painted them, and in the published copy of the
oration, Mr. Sumner has given at once the calmest and the deadliest
blow to the system he denounces—for he prints Mr. Chestnut's
speech. All the bludgeons in the hands of all the "chivalry of the
South" cannot beat that demonstration of Mr. Sumner's case out of
the heads of the public in and out of the States. The speech should
be reprinted in England, and circulated in thousands. What is the

FORGETFULNESS CURED BY SMELLING.
A Perfumer advertises a scent under the name of "Hungary
Water," as possessing the peculiar property of improving the memory.
That an odoriferous compound may serve to correct corporeal exha-
lations is conceivable, but there is some difficulty in understanding
how it can possiblv effect the improvement of an intellectual faculty.
A pinch of snuff, however, will stimulate the power of recollection;
and those who are up to snuff may not unreasonably hope to refresh
their memories as well as their nostrils by sniffing Hungary Water.
This fluid, if it really possesses the mnemonic virtue ascribed to it, may
be recommended to laundresses, who, by sprinkling therewith the
linen which they send home to fashionable ladies, may, perhaps, induce
some of their forgetful customers to remember the poor washerwoman
—that is, her bill. A bottle of Hungary Water may be a suitable
offering for presentation to an eblivious lover, and would convey an
intimation more delicate than the broad hint expressed by a bunch of
forget-me-nots.
Gentlemen who are apt to forget small commissions or necessary
purchases might do better to scent their pocket handkerchiefs with
Hungary Water than to tie knots in them. If the House of Commons
were purified with Hungary Water, members might recollect their
pledges. Candidates for situations in the Civil Service, under com-
petitive examination, might, by smelling hard at a flask of Hungary
Water, manage to recollect the cram which they had forgotten, and
thus be enabled to spell some words in the orthography of which
t hey are now so apt to break down, and consequently to be plucked
like roses.
sometimes tied round the head in lieu of helmets; and skullcaps called
chapels de fer, with nasals and without, were used by archers and
esquires and common men at arms, who although perhaps they thought
no small beer of themselves were too poor to come out in barrel-helmets,
or in casques.
Whether the knights were in these days more thin-skinned than they
had been is a point which we must leave to antiquarians to settle. But
it appears that padded armour came much more into use, and this
seems to us to argue a tenderness of cuticle. Quiltings of cloth and
silk, of buckram and of leather are spoken of as coming into fashion at
this period, and the peculiar pointed work with which they were em-
broidered obtained for them the names of "counterpoint" and "pour-
point." A complete suit, consisting of a sleeved tunic and chaussls
(a kind of Norman cross between a legging and a stocking) was
worn not infrequently underneath the surcoat, which was considerably
lengthened in the reign of Henry the Third, and was first emblazoned
with the arms of the wearer. We suppose that this emblazonment was
either done for decoration, or else to mark the garment when going to
the wash; in which latter case we fancy that the farce of How to Settle
Accounts with your Laundress must have now and then occasioned some
ludicrous mistakes. We can imagine the disgust of the doughty Earl
or Gooseburie at finding Lord de Lackshyrte's surcoat sent him
for his own: his washerwoman possibly attempting to excuse herself
on the ground that, the three geese portrayed on the Earl's shield
had been "mistuk" for the three griffins which adorned the other
garment.
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXIII.-ALL ABOUT ARMS AND ARMOUR.
O much fighting occurred
throughout the thirteenth
century, that the army tailors
must have had a roaring time
of it, like the man who has
to superintend the feeding of
wild beasts. We are told
indeed that changes were
continually taking place in
the military equipment, an
assertion which appears to us
quite easy of belief, seeing it
might nowadays be echoed
with great truth. Perhaps
of all the armour the helmet
was the part which under-
went most variation. During
John's time it was made cy-
lindric and flat-topped, and
covered up the head no lower
than the ears, the face being
protected by the aventaille,
or grating. In the next reign,
however, it enveloped the
whole head, and rested on the
shoulders; and seeing that it
bulged out like a barrel at
the sides, there seems to
have been fair reason for
calling it a casque. This
great helmet was made still more cumbrous and conspicuous by
being commonly surmounted with the wearer's knightly crest; which,
although intended to be a decoration, proved, nine times out of ten, to be
rather a disfigurement. Indeed the only reasonable reason we can think
of why these (so thought) ornaments should have been adopted is that
they seem to have made the helmet look still more like a barrel, by
adding a projection like a spigot or a tap. People who complain that
their hats give them a headache may thank their lucky stars that they
were born in the nineteenth, and not the thirteenth century; for we
read that these big headpieces were sometimes twisted round so by a
lance-stroke in a tournament that their unhappy wearers had to gasp
out to their squires to come and lend a hand to twist their turned
heads back again.
In the reign of Edward the First the barrel-shaped helmet con-
tinued still in use, although some slight attempts were made to knock
it on the head, and substitute a somewhat lighter kind of skull-cover.
Helmets inclining to a cone at the top are visible in some of the illu-
minated manuscripts; surmounted in some cases with a small round
knob, and, when seen in profile, showing an angular beaked front.
Simple plates of steel, convex and cut with breathing holes, were worn


TEHP. 1IF.NRY THE THIRD.
FROM THE PRONTJ8PIFCE TO THE OLD MKTRlCAt. ROUAKOE OF " T» SABLE AND
T» washerwoman's daughter." date a.d. 1260.
The old flat-ringed form of armour having gone quite out of fashion,
that made of rings worn edge-wavs was worn mostly at this period.
A new species, however, was introduced from Asia in the reign of
Henry the Third, and as avidus novitatis est gent militaris we find
that this uew sort was very generally sought after. Not being made
of chain, it was, doubtless, called chain-mail, from the same cause that
the Incus is so termed a non lucendo. Consisting of four rings linked
together by a fifth, it might not inaptly have been named link-mail,
but that its wearers might have possibly been chaffed for being link-
men. The rings were riveted together so as to form a perfect garment
of themselves, without requiring, like the scale-mail, a leathern lining
or foundation. The chain-mail generally was worn in the shape of a
loose shirt, between the gambeson and. surcoat; and in one respect
it clearly must have been superior in comfort to our shirts, for it cer-
tainly could never have been sent home with a button off.
Small plates of steel were worn upon the shoulders and the knees,
and likewise on the elbows, to protect them from t hose nasty knocks
upon the funny-bone which make recipients laugh upon the wrong
side of their mouth. On the shoulders, too, were worn a curious
kind of ornament called ailettes, or little wings, which came first into
fashion in the last years of the reign of King Edward the First.
As far as we can judge from the drawings of them extant, these
ailettes could have been of neither use nor beauty; and as their name
indicates a tendency to fly, they must have been misplaced upon the
shoulders of our soldiers.
The lance lost its gonfanon, or streamer, in this reign; and the
pennon was adopted as a military ensign, being charged with the
crest, or badge, or warcry of its knightly owner. The pennon, like
the gonfanon, was swallow-tailed in shape, but in breadth as well as
length it was made much bigger. In addition, the swell knights had
their banners borne before them, parallelograms in form and embla-
zoned with their arms, as were their cyclas and their quint is, and other
night-gown looking overcoats. They swaddled up their steeds, too,
in horsecloths similarly beautified, or else adorned with quaint ana
fanciful devices; so that their nags looked like the hobby-horses used

by clowns in pantomimes, and wanted crinoline to keep their legs free
from their petticoats.
Every schoolboy knows that onr first Edward was called "Long-
sha.iks ' from his long and slender legs, which he attenuated and
stretched by constant chevying of his ene-
mies.* Equally well known, of course, is
the story of his being stabbed when a
Crusader, and of how Queen Eleanor,
coming to his succour, sucked the poison
from his wound. His warrings with the
Welsh cannot less be in remembrance, as
we are all now thinking of our Prince of
Wales; and it was by Edward's sword
that the title was first gained for us. Nor
can his battles with brave William Wal-
lace be forgotten by those who have had
the Tales of My Grandfather retailed to
them, or have learnt of Dr. Goldsmith
from the fear of Dr. Birch. To readers,
then, with all these recollections fresh
before them, we need not say that this was
a most pugnacious period; nor shall we
much surprise them if we state, that not
less various than the armour were the arms
of it. The shield in some cases was flat,
and triangular, or heater-shaped, and in
others pear-shaped, and in surface more
cylindric: while to the weapons of offence
there were added now the falchion, a sword
with a broad blade, the estoc, a sword
much smaller, chiefly used for stabbing,
the coutel or cultelas, whence our modern
"cutlass," and the anelace, or anelas, a
broad dagger which tapered down to a fine
point, and "not to put too fine a point on
it," would do for any lad or any lass whom
it was dabbed into. Besides these imple-
ments of manslaughter there was a sort of
a small pickaxe called martel-de-fer, which
was used to break the links and plates of
mail, and make way for a sword-cut, or a
lance;thrust or a dagger-poke. The mace
lso appears first in the drawings of this period, though it was
doubtless introduced in the earlier crusades, as it is quite clearly of
oriental origin. This opinion is borne out by the MS. of the Talis-
man, in which Saladin is described as being knocked off his horse by
Sir Kenneth's weighty mace: and another less known writer, in
his account of how the English were mustered by Kino Richard for
the assault of Ascalon, speaks of somebody or other " giving pepper
with his mace," a description which we must allow is rather spicy.
* As Kino Edward was regarded aa the father of his people, the statement has
been made that he was nicknamed "Daddy Long Legs," but wo fear that this
assertion is without a proper footing.

THE BERKELEY PEERAGE CASE.
BT OUR SPECIAL REPORTER.
Scene—The House of Lords last week. Present the Chancellor,
Lords Redesdale, Brougham, Kinosdown, Mb, Fleming, the
Attorney-General, and other great lawyers.
Lord Brougham. Well, now, Mr. Fleming, you want us to declare that
Admiral Sir Maurice Berkeley is a Baron. But you make him
out. such a rum kind of Baron. I don't see our way.
Lord Kingsdoum. You might as well call him a Baron of Beef.
Mr. Fleming. Well, my Lord, there was a Baron Front de Boeuf.
The Attorney General. I must remind my learned friend that Front
de Bceuf was only a hero of fiction.
Lord Redesdale. You say Sir Maurice is entitled, because he has
got. Berkeley Castle. That seems a barren claim to a barony.
Mr Fleming. My Lord, it's in the most fertile part of Gloucester.
The Chancellor. Nevertheless, the claim's not the cheese.
Mr. Fleming. One of our kings was murdered in that Castle, my
Lords, and
Lord Kingsdown. We are not throwing Edward the Second into
your respectable client's face, Mr. Fleming. We acquit him of all
share iu that transaction. But, on the other hand, we do not think that
it gives him a claim to a peerage.
Mr. Fleming. The Castle was taken by Oliver Cromwell
Lord Redesdale. That is important. Was it taken on a lease or an
agreement P
The Attorney-General. Taken, I apprehend my learned friend to mean,
as a castle is taken at chess, that is to say, captured, if I make myself
intelligible to my Lord Redesdale.
Lord Rsdesdale. Oh! Ah!
Lord Brougham. But if the Admiral means to say he helped in that
affair, he may tell that to his Marines. I am sure the Attorney-
General will not admit that what was done on the 21st of September,
1615, could have been performed, in part or in whole, by an elderly,
irascible, and naufrageous gentleman, extant in the year of grace 1860.
The Attorney-General. I form no opinion on the point, one way or the
other, mv Lord. Let my learned friend prove his case.
Lord Brougham. Why, the old boy would be 275 years old, if he
joined Cromwell at 20.
The Attorney-General. Nor can I undertake to assert whether your
Lordship's estimate approximates to accuracy. Let my learned friend
prove his case.
Mr. Fleming. I mean to. See here. It is perfectly ridiculous to
talk of a Castle being without a Barou. I never heard such nonsense.
You might as well talk of a Castle without a Donjon, or a Partisan, or
a Keep, or a Portfolio.
Lord Kingsdoum. Do you mean a Portcullis P
The Attorney-General. I must protest against your Lordships helping
my learned friend with his curious assemblage of architectural embel-
lishments.
Lord Brougham. Have there been machicollations at the Castle, Ma.
Fleming?
Mr. Fleming. My Lord, I am not precisely informed; but the
Berkeleys have been always the souls of hospitality, and 1 make no
doubt that there have been all possible kinds of collations.
The Chancellor. So far so good. Now, Mr. Fleming, be kind
enough to state, as shortly as is consistent with biographical candour,
the personal history of all the Berkeleys who have lived since the
building of the Castle by Henry the First in the year 1108.
Lord Brougham. I am not quite satisfied with that direction. Why
did Henry the First build the Castle in 1108?
The Attorney-General. That in 1860 my learned friend might take
his stand upon it.
Mr. Fleming. You have no right to say so. I never stood on a
Castle in my life. I don't like heights; they make me giddy, espe-
cially if I feel bilious. I always get a queer feeliug that I should like
to jump off.
Lord Kingsdoum. I have felt that. It is very odd.
Lord Brougham. So have I.
Lord Redrr.dale. You should hunt more, you fellows, and then you
wouldn't be bilious. By the way, talking of hunting, Sir Richard,
that's a capital nag of yours. I saw him in Palace Yard. If you
think of parting with him at any time, give us the refusal.
Lord Campbell. He's just the thing for an Attorney-General, but
he has too much go in him for a Chancellor.
The Attorney-General. Your Lordship {smiling) has felicitously indi-
cated the circumstances under which I shall be happy to recall this
pleasant conversation to my Lord Redesdale's recollection.
Mr. Fleming. The founder of the House of Berkeley—
Lord Brougham. He must have been a brass founder, to judge by
the cheekiuess of his descendants.
The Attorney-General. I am not admitting any descent, mind, my
Lords. Let my learned friend prove his case.
The Chancellor. Another time, Mr. Fleming, please. We have
made very good progress to-day, and we must not hurry. Admiral
Berkeley nas lived for sixty years, and more, without a peerage, so
he can wait a little longer, and we can't.
The case was then adjourned.
EUPHEMISM UNCOMMON.
A Foreign Correspondent of a contemporary begins his letter as
follows:—
"The plot thickens at Naples. Wo shall soon too, probably, hear ofa sanguinary
outburst."
Good phrases are, and ever were, commendable, as Justice Shallow
remarks. "A sanguinary outburst" is one of those phrases. "Out-
burst," that is to say, in popular phraseology, row. That is the
expression which a costermonger would have used in the above con-
nection. The itinerant vegetable-merchant certainly would not have
employed the substantive "outburst," and the adjective which he
would have adjoined to it would have been more Saxon than
sanguinary.
Quite 'Tother.
Jules Gerard, the Algerine Lion-hunter, is to be President of the
Tir National about to be established by Louis Napoleon. We would
i'ust remind Gerard that the African Lion is one thing—the British
jion another.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 10. Monday. It is an unwise thing to give offence to a clever
man. One of these days you are sure to feel the evil consequences of
j our imprudence. Especially if he be not only a clever but a good
man, and a professed philanthropist. For though, of course, so far as
he is personally concerned, he freely and fully forgives you, we being
all bound to forgive one another, he is much too conscientious to let
his own amiable feelings render him negligent of the duly he owes to
society. To have wronged a worthv person argues that, you are an
unworthy person, and therefore Mr. 'Worthy, who finds the power of
chastising you entrusted to him, doubtless for a good purpose, dares
not. let you escape uncastigated. And then a good man and a profound
philanthropist has such a strong impression made upon his mind by
your naughtiness, from its being so startlingly unlike his own conduct,
that your misdeeds are never out of his memory. You are sure to
catch it, one day or other, perhaps when yon have quite succeeded in
forgiving yourself, and forgetting the whole business. Mr. Punch
repeats it,—never give offence to a good and clever man.
The Publicans and Spirit-dealers should have thought of this maxim
when they were so offensively rude to Mr. Glalstone about the Wine
Licences Bill, and when they exerted themselves to the utmost of their
ability to embarrass the Cabinet during the Budget debates. They
were very brutal, but Mr. Worthy bore their onslaughts with so sweet
a smile, and pleaded with them so elaborately and persuasively, that
though he beat them thoroughly, the Bungs could not suppose he
preserved resentment. He carried his Wine Licences system, and
every cabman now takes his La Rose and Lafitte, and swears furiously
if the bouquet be wanting in the wine. And the Chancellor op the
Exchequer put away his wrong on the shelf to cool, quite sure that
he could warm it up again at the shortest notice. The chance came, as
it always will come if we wait for it, and watch; and it so happened
that England wanted a little more than a Million of money to help to
make up the small amount needed for the Chinese War. Bless me,"
says Mr. Gladstone, "a million? Dear, dear, that is a considerable
sum. But it must be raised, and we must try to make the business as
easy as possible for the people. Nay, we must endeavour to make it a
boon to them. What a bad habit it is, that of drinking Spirits.
Suppose we discourage it as far as possible. Do you know that if a
couple of shillings a gallon were suddenly clapped on, in addition to

enough to raise One Million and Thirty Thousand Pounds P Suppose
we say One and Elevenpence a gallon P" "Very well," says the
House of Commons, not inclined to make any more fuss about any-
thing. And down comes the blow, and Bungdomia writhes in
impotent rage.
"And the grim Lord of IL &. D.,
Has turned him from the ground,
And laughed, in secret, that his blade
The Willer's thrust so well repaid."
There was, however, another trifle or so to make up the sum of
£2,336,000, which was wanting to make up about Six Millions for the
Missionary Expedition to China. The process is something like that
which used to go on at a certain theatrical hostel called the Harp, and
well known, olim, to the errant. A stranger taking his seat there
would receive a little note sent by a shabby-genteel looking man in the
corner, and brought by the waiter, and requesting that "t he gentleman,
with whose name the writer had not the honour of being acquainted,
would kindly advance elevenpence to make up a shilling to enable the
writer to obtain a glass of brandy-and-water." Mr. Gladstone is a
statesman of resources, and he nz the amount with singular ease.
Part he borrowed from the balances in the Exchequer, stating that on
the whole it was really an advantageous thing that they should be so
employed—and whence, do you think, he got the restP Why, from
the Paper Duty, which he had proposed to take off, and which the
Lords insisted on his keeping on. Thus do great chemists extract
medicines from poisonous herbs. Thus does Mr. Gladstone, like the
old Admiral in the song, put his Pigtails in Paper. Thus does
the British Press become (a trifle indirectly) the means of sending
Civilisation through China.
"Its voice is heard through rolling drums
That beat for fight where Elgin stands,
Its force comes down in Armstrong bombs,
And gives the battle to his hands."
The business thus described was the principal work of Monday, but
among smaller matters of note were an intimation that we are not to
have the Bronze Pennies till the end of September—a stern protest
against the Chinese War by Mr. Roebuck, and a rather neat justifica-
tion of it by Mr. Gladstone, who had himself sternly protested against
it a short time ago, but who now urged that however objectionable the
original war might be, we had a right to fight for a ratification of the
treaty of peace—and an endeavour by Mr. Newdegate to get the
debates closed at one o'clock at night. This attempt was warmly
opposed by Lord Palmebbton, who quoted Tom Moore's allegation,
VOL. 3TXX1X.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
|July 28, 1860.
that the best of all ways to lengthen our days is to steal a few hours
from the night, my dear, and who is as gay and full of work at four in
the morning as at eight in the evening. The Premier is one of the
men described by Mr. Disraeli in Tancredl who contemn the vul-
garian that begins to yawn for his plebeian night-cap at eleven
o'clock. They used in the old days, "to finish a debate, when once in
it, like Gentlemen, who had been accustomed to be up all night, and
then go and sup at Watier's." Newdegate's notion was knocked
on the nob.
Tuet&ay. Lord Brougham displayed an amount of ignorance with
which Mr. Punch did not credit him. Complaining of the time wasted
in debate in the House of Commons, he said that it had remembered
its original etymology, and become a House of Talk, a Parliamentum.
The Lords laughed as ignorantly as the speaker spoke. They may be
forgiven, Mr. Punch is never hard upon the uneducated classes, washed
or unwashed, but he knows that Brougham reads his Punch, and there-
fore the latter wonders how the former can have forgotten the real
derivation of the word Parliament. Does he not know that it is from
two French verbs, parler and mentirf
The Commons were more active in an anti-educational demonstration.
There was a Bill for making it compulsory on the employers of the
labour of children under twelve years old, to have a certificate that the
child was learning to read and write, and had twenty hours of teaching
per month—nothing like an hour a day. But so monstrous an Innova-
tion frightened the House. Mr. Henley was pious, and said that
people were not to eat unless they worked, but were not commanded to
lead and write; Mr. Buxton was humane, and said there were
thousands of children too idle, wicked, or stupid to learn, and their
vested rights were not to be interfered with; Mr. Hardt took the old
Tory view, and said that the children of the poor were taught quite
enough to enable them to do the duties they were intended for; and Mr.
Baines, as a Dissenter, declared the Bill to be needless, and that the
work of education was going on admirably. Yielding to these irre-
sistible arguments, the Bill was thrown out, a majority of 122 to 51
deciding that the children of the English poor want no assistance in
the battle with the World, the Flesh, and the First Whig. In a second
educational debate, more sense was exhibited, the House refusing to
disturb the system of national teaching in Ireland, as demanded by
certain ultra-Protestants, who wish to force the Bible into the schools,
whereby the Catholic children would be forced out. Mr. Lefroy gave
the highest praise to the present system, in saying that it was not satis-
factory to the clergy of Ireland. If it did please the "perspiring
Sarsons" who do the firebrand business, it would certainly not please
ft. Punch.
Lord Ferhot then tried to get up another Shindy on the Paper
Duty question, but whether he did it to please the lower class of his
Marylebone constituents, or, as we hope and believe, only from a high-
mettled Irishman's noble love of combat, did not exactly appear. Lord
Palmerston said that the question was settled, and be would have no
such nonsense, and Mr. Gladstone, prayed to help in the fray,
declined being party to any new demonstration. There was a little
smart firing on both sides, and Mr. Disraeli wanted Lord Palmer-
ston to take a vote directly hostile to the other Irish nobleman. Pam
would not do this, but carried the Previous Question by 177 to 138.
Wednesday. The Moon moved and carried a Resolution that the Sun
was unworthy of the confidence of the Earth, and followed up her
motion by moving herself into a place directly between the latter
parties. People threw up their eyes a good deal at the Moon's motion,
and things were beginning to look rather dark, when the Moon thought
better of it, and slunk out of the way. Many observations were made,
but a* it is understood that such a thing is not likely to occur again in
a hurry, it is not necessary to be harsh in comment upon what really
seemed an act of Lunacy. It naturally set the House of Commons
thinking of Gas, and the Bill for dealing with the Gas-Tyrants went
through Committee, much hindered, but finally successful.
Thursday. Lord Dersy made a long speech in which he pointed out
that the House of Lords was really of no use for legislative purposes.
This was the fault of the House of Commons, which wasted such
oceans of time in gabble that there was no getting Bills up to the Lords
in any decent time. He thought that the best way would be. not as at
present to make every Bill die with the Session, but to let tne Lords,
on re-assembling after prorogation, take up any Bills to whose principles
they had assented. Lord Kedksdalk thought that the fewer Bills
that were passed the better, but this rather off-hand way of treating the
subject was not admired, and the question is to be considered.
In the Commons a melancholy proof was given of the truth of Lord
Derby's accusation against the Commons. The only valuable measure
of the Session, the Bankruptcy Bill, so vehemently demanded by
the mercantile world, that is to say England, was thrown up by
the Attorney-General, in despair of being able to force it through the
forest of gabble that stood between it and the Lords. Mr. Punch
tenders to the learned parent of the deceased measure his warmest
acknowledgments of the labour aud skill that produced the Bill, and
the energy with which he fought it, and hopes that he (Mr. Punch)
may next year have the pleasure of exhibiting an immortal Cartoon, of
a classical and allegorical character, and with this title: "The hero.
Bethell, having delivered Fair Commerce from the Monster, Old
Bankruptcy, confides her to the keeping of the twin tutelary deities,
Equity ana Economy."
An Indian Debate, which, singularly, though personal was unin-
teresting, was followed by a long drawn and on some points just
grumble by Charley Napier about defects in the management of
Greenwich Hospital. A good deal in the improving way might be
done, but when Charley states that the Government make the Sea-
men at Greenwich as miserable as they can, Mr. Punch must say that,
judging by observations made by himself (while getting up his appetite
for the benefit of one Q, or one H) on the demeanour of the old Salts,
the allegation, if true, proclaims the Government to be singularly
unsuccessful.
Friday. Lord Lucan, of Crimean Blunder celebrity, took an oppor-
tunity of informing the Lords that he had "a very good memory. So
have the public and the army, and Lord Lucan's memory is better
than his judgment, or he would not willingly intrude upon the world
bis noble name, associated as it is with the recollections of disaster
caused by aristocratic imbecility.
The Government had the pleasure of receiving another defeat. Mr.
Gladstone's Savings Banks Bill was opposed, and its principal clause
was rejected by 116 to 78, whereupon the Chancellor of the X
withdrew the measure. "Third smash of the week," said the Premier,
laughing, ,
"TrU Bunt, vert, quas mo faciunt flure."
Lord John Russell stated that we should at present interfere in i
Syria only to the extent of placing ships on the coast, but that France
was proposing more vigorous action, and the subject was under con-;
sideration. The Queen's Printer is to retain his patent for printing
the Bible. There was a renewal of the personal Indian debate of the 1
previous night, Sir C. Wood, Mr. Horsman, and Lord Palmerston I
being the speakers, and another proof was afforded of the great advan- j
tage which is afforded to a person who has gone wrong should his censor I
forget his manners, or lose his temper. With an angry opponent
and a judicious friend one only wants a little tact to shift the whole
ground, and actually hand the party with a grievance into the dock,
instead of the party originally accused. This was very neatly done by
Sir C. Wood and Lord Palmerston. and Mr. Horsman. who had
really a case about some juggling with documents, was terribly scolded,
and made to appear to the House as anything but a generous personage.
But Jupiter Punch, who sits "high throned all height above," sees
through all the dodgery, and hereby hits Charles Wood a rap on the
head.
Then came a diverting speech from Edwin James about the diversion
of the ride in Kensington Gardens. The fact is that such crowds
come to gaze delightedly on Mr. Punch, as he rides in the How, that
Mr. Cowper thought more accommodation was required. But Mr.
Punch, although he is happy to exhibit himself to his fellow citizens,
and finds the alteration a great accommodation to himself, has no idea
of frightening away the ladies from the Gardens by the tremendous
cavalcade that gallops after him (like the Thousand Knights at Ivry ,
behind the Snowwhite Crest,) the moment he shows himself, and there- (
fore, on the whole, he proposes to Cowper to put the affair in statu
quo.
If all the Irish gentlemen resembled Mr. Cogan, who made, I
to-night, a most temperate and proper appeal on the subject of Orange
Processions, Ireland would give Mr. Punch much less trouble. He
was, of course, and as is de rigueur in Irish debates, answered with a
tu quoque by the Orange party, but his speech produced an excellent ,
effect on the House. The introduction of a Bill for continuing the
Corrupt Practices Act finished the week. A sort of Committee on the
same subject had been sitting at York, and at the termination of its
work, Mr. Leaiham, recently elected for and ejected from Wakefield,
was declared to be Guilty of Bribery—the occasion for such declaration
being York Assizes. Va victis! .
AN ANGLO-AMERICAN CONGRESS.
Noble old Brougham, at one of the late meetings of the Congress
which has been held at Somerset House, expressed a fear that lie had
given offence to Mr. Dallas and the United States by calling "the
attention of the American Ambassador to the fact—and he thought it f
was a very interesting fact—that a highly respectable coloured gentle-
man, Mr. Delany, from Canada, was one of the assembled members
of the International Statistical Congress." The noble and learned
philanthropist entertained a groundless apprehension. Mr. Dallas
was too glad to be reminded of a fact which he could quote for the
instruction of the barbarous part of his countrymen, and they no more
care about being twitted ou the subject of slavery than Thugs would
mind being "chaffed" about murder.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH AMONG THE ROSES.
ithout doubt the
handsomest. blush
rose exhibited last
week at Mr. Gye's
delightful Rose Show
was the blush that
rose to Mr. Punch's
manly brow the while
lie walked among the
flowers, himself being
(if lie may use two
vastly novel phrases)
the cynosure of en-
vying eyes" and the
"observed of all ob-
servers." As a sym-
bol of meek modesty
combined with con-
scious worth and ex-
cellence, the Punch
Blush took t he pu t of
all the other roses,
and had it been ex-
hibited before the
judges made their
award, there is very
little doubt they
would have given the
first prize to it. As
it, was, they showed
their judgment, Mr.
Punch will frankly
own, in allowing
Messieurs Paul to
take away that
honour; for, joking
quite apart, their
roses were so big as
to be almost appalling. Mr. Punch indeed half fancied that some fairy had transported him
to the land of Broodmgnagia, so gigantic were the specimens these gentlemen exhibited; and
his surmise was somewhat strengthened by the roses that were shown and gained a prize for
Mr Hedge, which were the very largest Hedge-roses that Mr Punch hid. ever had the
happiness of sniffing at. Besides the rows of roses, there were heaps of ferns and heaths,

and hosts of hothouse plants, which though they
all had gone to pot, looked not a whit the worse
for it. In fact, as the poet might have said if be
had seen them,—
"Flora gave her fairest flowers,
None mere rare in all her treasure:
Which being placed in Floral bowers,
Punth was pleased beyond all measure."
Several of these plants had remarkably fine
names, and looked quite fine enough to justify
them. Their rich colours were however some-
what thrown into the shade, being washed out
by the flood of rose-light which was shed on
them. Indeed, Punch might have passed
them without notice, had not his attention been
attracted by a Wretch, who tried to pun about
two cacti being like an exotic fruit, because it
was quite patent that they were a prickly pair.
Blest as he is with affluence and with every
blissful comfort that can make home happy, Mr.
Punch's disposition is not naturally covetous.
But there certainly are times when a sensation
takes possession of him, which makes him feel
that there is something wanting to his happiness,
and which something, if secured, would yield him
perfect bliss. This feeling Mr. Punch felt at the
Floral Hall, when he looked at the Great Bed of
roses in the centre, which in its vasiness bore
resemblance to the Great Bed of Ware. The
instant that his eye first rested on this bed,
.)//. Punch felt a longing to rest his head and
shoulders on it: and only the reflection that he
was close to Bow Street prevented him from
jumping slap into the bed, and calling out to
somebody to come and tuck him up! Mr.
Punch, of course, had often seen a rose-bed
before, but he had never seen a rose-bed which
so tempted one to sleep upon it, secure from
molestation even by its thorns, lo lie on such
a rose-bed, to sip a sherry-cobler, and be squirted
at with rosewater, the while Mario and Grisi
sweetly sang one off to sleep: such bliss a man
would pay a double Income-Tax to dream of, and
Mr. Punch felt sadly tempted to envy Mr. Gib,
who had it in .his power, if he pleased so, to
en-Gye it.
THE VOLUNTEER OF JULY 14th.
THE SEQUEL.
It you 're waking call me early—though I feel so very queer,
That with all the calling in the world I shan't get up, 1 fear;
I ought to clean my rifle, and a precious job 'twill be—
For the next sham-fight at Chiselhurst I don't think they '11 catch me.
Grant's cooking-waggon on the ground they told us we should find,
And so [ left, unluckily, my sandwiches behind.
We marched and fought and conquered, but nothing could be seen
Of Grant's waggon on the hill-top, where Grant's waggon should
have been.
By the time the flag of truce proclaimed the finish of the fray,
Our throats were all a-dust with the labours of the day,
With the march across the hay-fields, and the skirmish in the copse,
And every flask had long been drained down to its latest drops.
Yet not a grumbler in the corps, a laggard in the train,
As hopefully we marched towards the longed-for cooking-wain;
The bivouac upon the plan stood plain to every eye;
We longed for pots of oeer so—we were so very dry!
We came to "Bivouac No. L" and nothing could we see,
But a tent set, bare of victuals and drink, beneath a tree:
We thought at "Bivouac No. 8," to find the tap we craved.
But "Number 2," like "Number 1" repulsively behaved!
Upon those'porter-barrels, and those pork-pies of ours,
The spectators had descended as keen as locust-showers;
They had cleared off every remnant of victuals from the hill,
And entirely floored our liquors while we were fighting still.
And there we stood, half-starved, a-thirst, beneath the waning light.
And we knew the publics would be closed e'er we reached town that
night,
And from the heights of Chiselhurst the night-wind set in cool,
And our feelings tow'rds Lord Ranelagk weren't pleasant, as a
rule.
But the best of a bad bargain was all that could be made;
So to our hungry bellies we the flattering unction laid,
That some kind tap might chance to lie on in the way that we should
pass,
To the Southborough-Road Station, but that hope was vain, alas!
We had been calm and patient; but we grew desp'rate now;
And we got back to the station with a cloud upon each brow;
And it really was enough to make a fellow rather riled,
Of bub and grub in this way to find himself beguiled!
We waited for a train, for hours; and in such piteous case,
That to get a glass of water one had quite a row to lace;
And when at last the carriages got with us under weigh,
We were kept at sidings, shunted, in the most provoking way!
Good night—good night; but leave the key of the cellar in the door,
You've drawn a jug of beer I see, but I shall want some more;
And if of this cold mutton, in the morning, nought is seen,
Tell Cook she need not be surprised—my appetite's so keen.
You'll find my muddy gaiters upon the passage floor;
With my pouch—but mind the candle—there's ten rounds in it or
more;
Tell (he maid to dry my boots—in a ditch I got them wet;
I tried to leap across it, but into it chanced to get.
Good night; you'll see well-brushed the coat and trousers 1 have
worn;
And take care and get them mended, where I hitched upon a thorn;
I'll be sure and put the lights out, when I've had my meat and
beer;
And, on second thoughts, don't call me in the morning—there 'a a
1 dear.

The new equestrian ride, which cuts

GILES SCROQGINS'S JOURNAL.
Y some persons the following state-
ment in the Spiritual Magazine for
July may be thought to require
confirmation:—
'' A few evenings ago, during the month
or June, some remarkable spirit mani-
festations took place at the mansion of
the French Ambassador, Albert Gate.
Amongst a large number of influential
persons who witnessed them were the Due
and Dughessb de Malakopp, Count Pcr-
siohy, and Lord Ward, who all expressed
their great satisfaction and duligbt to
Madahb Louise Besson, who was the
medium present."
The same number of the same
periodical ajso contains the sub-
joined announcement:—
"Spirit Medium and Clairvoyant*.—
Ma dame Louise Bssson, King Street, Soho
Square, has ttancfi daily, and is open to
private engagement*,''
Some ladies have doubles,—if we may credit Spiritualism,—like the
>ounir person mentioned by Robert Dale Owen in his Footfalls on
the Boundaries of Another World, the Livonian Governess, who lost
nineteen situations by her extraordinary duplicity. Madame Louise
Bessox may also possess, or be possessed with, a duplicate; and,
whilst she was astonishing the natives and foreigners at the French
Ambassador's, her counterpart, or counterfeit, may have been prac-
tising professional necromancy at King Street, Soho Square. If
the medium of Albert Gate and the advertising seeress are one and the
same person, then, albeit she may be describable as a " wise woman,"
the less that is said the better about the wisdom of Count Persigny,
the Duke and Duchess op Malakoff, Lord Ward, and a large
number of influential persons—or else about the accuracy of the
Spiritual Magazine. The veracity of our credulous contemporary is
not in question. Bat when the above-named personages complimented
Madame Besson on her "spirit manifestations," did they congratulate
her as a witch or an artist?
If Madame Besson is really in a position to accept engagements as
a " Spirit Medium and Clairvoyante,"—just as she might hire herself
out as a corn-cutter,—she must be able to command spiritual mani-
festations nearly whenever she pleases. _ Old Sam Wesley told the
rapping spirit of £pworth to come into his study if it had anything to
say to him. Couldn't Madam e Besson come to Punch's Office, and
get a spirit to rap out a spirited communication for this periodical on
the counter?
Perhaps not. Like Lord Mamsberrt, Punch is not particular
about spelling, because that is corrigible; but erroneous orthography
and baa composition are apt to be conjoined. Of bad writing, in com-
bination with bad grammar, an instance may be quoted from this same
number of \ he Spiritual Magazine, in the following message represented
as having been transmitted by a departed spirit through the hand of a
medium, in a backward scrawl:—
"Ye are sorrowing as one without hope."
The spirit substitutes Ye are for Thou art. If we are to believe the
supernatural origin of the foregoing sentence, we may suppose it to have
emanated from an illiterate Methodist parson. The passage in question
will remind most of our readers of a very similar piece of spiritual
English, occurring in a familiar metrical legend:—
"When, standing all by the bed-post,
A figure tall her sight engrossed.
And it cried, 'I ben Oilbs Scroooins'b ghost;
Bl tol de riddle lol de my!"
Exactly so. Hi tol de riddle lol de ray! What else is there to be
said in either case f Nothing but that some spirits, like most rogues,
write, and probably read, imperfectly, and might be classified, as the
rogues are, under the head of "It. & W. Imp." Punch is credibly
informed—credibly, because spirit-writing bears the information out,
that, at a recent necromantic seance the spirits were summoned by an
old female party with the invocation, "Is there any tperrits present f"
On the same occasion Punch's informant says that he put his hand
under the table to be grasped by any other that might dare to take
hold of it, fully prepared to drag that other up to the light. The
experiment proved unsuccessful.
Mr. Punch recommends his spiritual contemporary to remember that
the ridicule of truth should be regarded with serene contempt and
refuted by demonstration: that experiments which cannot be performed
except under certain conditions which are among those of jugglery are
inconclusive, and that it is the peculiarity of all quacks and enthusiasts,
whether religious or scientific, to resent derision of their impostures
cr delusions. "Let those laugh who win," is the maxim of the sure
philosopher. Lords Ltndhurst and Brougham are believers in
spiritualism, are they P Brougham and Ltndhurst also among the
spirit-rappers! So the Spiritual Magazine asserts; but Incredulity
whispers Walker!" What, are the odds that any alleged spiritual
manifestation is genuine P Who will bet on the head of Madame
Besson; who will back her to obtain one rap on a table f There is an
oracle that may settle this question; a point on which we would advise
our spiritual to consult our sporting contemporary. Bell's life is at
least as likely as any other human medium to give a correct answer to
any inquiry touching the life beyond the grave.
QOLDSMID'S DESERTED VILLAGE.
"Mr. White, a Radical, has been returned for Brighton, beating Mr. Moore, a
Tory, and Mr. Golds*id, a Jew."— Wttkly Paptr.
To the above concise narrative Mr. Punch would have had nothing
to add, but that from reports of the election, and from correspondeuc>\
it would appear that Mr. Moore may complain of being bracketed
with Mr. Goldsmid, as beaten. Mr. Moore teas beaten—Brighton
polled 1565 Whites and 1239 Moores, and the Tory went down in fair
fight. But Mr. Goldsmid retired in the middle of the contest, after
polling only 477 votes. And he retired, because he had no chance of
winuing. And he had no chance of winning, because he, or his agents,
had endeavoured to bring to bear upon Mr. White a Jew Screw
which is not generally approved by English mechanics. Mr. Whits
stated upon the hustings that the Hebrew's agent had called upon the
Radical's agent, and told him that something which happened in con-
nection with the pecuniary affairs of Mr. White, twenty-three years
ago, had come to Mr. Goldsmid's knowledge, and that, if Mr.
White did not retire, t hose particulars should be made known to every
elector of Brighton. The threat was carried out, and the fact that
Mr. White had been unsuccessful in business at Plymouth nearly a
quarter of a century back, and had not cleared away all his debts, was
promulgated by handbills throughout Brighton. The answer of
Brighton was to vote for the Tory and the Radical, and the Jew had
to retire with a splendid minority of 477 votes, which most be con-
siderably under the number of Mosaic jewellers and cigar-shopkeepers
at Brighton, who would naturally support their fellow-believer.
Mr. Punch fought the cause of the Jews for years and years, and
finally brought them into Parliament. He has also supported the
honourable and amiable, if not very brilliant, representatives whom
Israel has sent to the House. Bat he begs to warn Jewry generally not
to fall into the mistake of imitating such Christians as work the money
screw, either in the way of bribery or of intimidation, and sometimes get
convicted by Yorkshire juries. It would be a bad day for the British
Jew should Mr. Punch withdraw his countenance from that party—in
fact the sooner he took, in such an emergency, a non-return ticket for
Palestine the better. Mr. Punch believes that the majority of his
Hebrew friends would disapprove as heartily as he and Brighton have
done of the mean attempt to damage Mr. White; but it is just as well
to let Jewry kuow that what Mr. Punch would denounce in a Christian
he is not disposed to pardon in a Jew. Equality of privileges implies
an equal standard of what is just and gentlemanly.
QUOD ERA.T DEMONSTRANDUM.
IN RE BROADSTAIRS BOATMEN.
The atrocious working of our still abominable law of imprisonment
for debt is cruelly exemplified by the case of the ten gallant Broad-
stairs Boatmen now lying in Maidstone Gaol for the amount of a bill
of costs incurred through an unsuccessful action to recover salvage for
having helped to rescue from destruction a vessel nearly wrecked on
the Goodwin Sands. This exploit was performed at the imminent
peril of their lives. Their lugger, appropriately called the Dreadnought,
t heir only property, which had cost £900, they had the misfortune to
lose simultaneously with their lawsuit. The attorney to whom, or to
whose employers, they stand indebted, claps them in quod. Neither
Capias nor his clients are to be condemned for screwing out of people
who owe them money every farthing they can get. But they can't get
blood out of a post, and the Broadstairs Boatmen, being utterly desti-
tute, are to Capias and their other detaining creditors as posts to
horseleeches.
What object, then, can be gained by the incarceration of these poor
brave fellows P That of wringing, not their empty pockets, but the
purses of a public who compassionate their sufferings, and commiserate
their unworthy treatment. Surely the privilege of applying pressure

to this extent is rather too jolly for exacting creditors. So great an
amount, of torsion power is a liltle too great rightly to remain in the
hands of a solicitor. Yet, under existing circumstances, it is necessary
to announce to the benevolent, that their charitable contributions are
earnestly solicited for the Solicitor who has shut up the Broadstairs
Boatmen in prison; and that any addition over the sum of that gen-
tleman's bill which they may please to subscribe, so as to compensate
the wrongs of those meritorious prisoners, will be thankfully received.
What the men have done to deserve thus much we know; but we do
not know why Capias and his clieuts should be empowered to enforce
their demands upon insolvents by squeezing liquidation out of the
public heart. The perlormauce of this operation or experiment, either
upon sympathisers or friends and relations, is the only purpose which
detentiou for debt, when it is not penal, can possibly serve, and it is
one so undesirable that perhaps Parliament will, some Session or other,
when the House of Commons can contrive to do any business, abolish
imprisonment for all debtors but rogues.
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXIV.—THE REIGNS OF EDWARD THE FIRST
AND EDWARD THE SECOND.
. E described in our Jast chapter the
armour which was worn in the first
of these two reigns, and that used in
the second did but very little differ
from it. To the weapons of offence
there were added a sort of poleaxe,
known as a godendac, and a scimi-
tar, which is said to have been
"borrowed from the Turks," but
which is not recorded as having
been returned to them.* Perhaps
the scimitar was used by the semi-
tars and semi-soldiers who engaged
at sea; but for these marine man-
slaughterers the falcastrum, a kind
of long bill (like a lawyer's), was
highly recommended by the fighting
faculty. The falcastrum is described
as a sort of scythe fixed firmly at
the end of a long spear; and the
wielders of it doubtless, like the
lawyers with their bills, must have
made themselves unpleasant by
"sticking it into" people.
As these new weapons of offence
rendered enemies of course more
offensive than they had been, the
armour was made stronger and more
cut-aud-thrust-and-poke-proof. A
greater quantity of plate was worn
mixed with the chain; by which we
do not mean that knights carried
more forks and spoons about them,
for the plate in ancient armour was
made of steel and iron, and bore no
resemblance to the plate in modern
plate-ba:>kets. Wrought iron almost
covered the hauberk and chauss^s: greaves of one plate shielded the
forepart of the leg: and plates known as mamelieres were worn upon
the breast; while the arm, we learn, was armed with vant-braces,
and brassarts, not named from brass the metal, but from bras the
arm. As a further alteration, the beer-barrel shaped helmet assumed,
we are told, a "sugar-loaf or egglike form:" which seems as if its
wearers had it. in their heads to indicate a preference for sweet
wort or egg flip. The common meu at. arms however, still wore
the ancient skull-cap, which, though called chapeau de fer, must
not he confounded with the modern fur cap. But we should
notice that they wore it. now without a nose-piece, which appears to
have been cut. off in the reign of Edward the First. What occa-
sioned this removal the reader is at perfect, liberty to guess; for we
fiud nothing authentically stated on the point. The best conjecture
we can make is, that as the nasal stuck out like the handle of a sauce-
pan, it must have been a tempting thing to clutch at and lay hold of,
and men were doubtless taken prisoners by being taken by the nose-
piece, which was about as ignominious as being taken by the nose.
Edward the First was much more of a soldier than a swell, and
his successor was much more of a swell than of a soldier; but in neither

of their reigns was there much change in the dresses worn by civil
persons, if we make a not uncivil exception of the ladies. To prove

how little our first Edward cared for finery and fashion, it is enough
to say his common dress was like that of a commoner. He always
wore blue looks when he ever had to wear his royal robes of purple,
and we learn that, after the coronation ceremony, he showed his sense
by never again putting on his crown. Had Shakspeare then been
extant, the King might have quoted, in defence of what he did, the
line which says,
11 Uneasy lios the head tout woara a crown,"
—although he must have owned there is some sense in the suggestion
that—
"If a king lies uneasy in his crown,
He'd better take it off when he lies down."
As a reason for his singular simplicity of dress, Edward is said to
have observed, that "Members of the feathered tribe are not made
fiue minded by the fineness of their plumage," and to have added to
this strikingly original remark the declaration, that although his
Christian name was Edward, still he was not such a Neddy as
to fancy kings were more esteemed in costly clothes than coarse
ones.
To readers so intelligent as those must be who study Punch, it is
needless to relate that, under such a sovereign, fiuery and foppery
went rather out of fashion, and dowdy dressers doubtless found chief
favour at his Court. When the Prince of Wales however was invested
with the military belt of knighthood, purple robes, fine linen and gold-
embroidered mantles were liberally distributed to his young knight
companions,* who, we fear, were up to sad games in (he Temple
Gardens, for we find it stated that "y* flowere of ye nobilitye did playe
sad havock with y' floweres." Had Mr. Broome, the present Temple
Gardener, been there, he would probably have had a brush with these
young rakes, and perhaps have used the birch to sweep them from the
place.
Fops came more into favour in the reign of Edward the Second, t
and the most finicking and fine of them were probably his favourites.
Piers Gaveston set the example by out-dressing his peers, and fol-
lowing his lead, "the esquire endeavoured to outshine the knight, the
knight the baron, the baron the earl, the earl the king himself, in the
richness of his apparel." In fact everybody tried to cut a greater
shine than everybody else, and how splendidly they flared up may be
seen by looking at the old illuminations. Swell vied with swell in
the absurdest manner possible, and as, doubtless, a good many of them
• When our Prince Edward comes from Canada, we may probably expect to see
this ceremony repeated: and the Oovornment may save themselves fn.m searching
for a precedent by bearing in their minds the present chapter of our Book As . of
the young knight (and d»y) companions of the Prince, Mr. Punch may just remind
them that he likes bis linen marked plainly with a P., aud that as embroidery haa
now gone out of fashion, he wt.uld prefer to have the gold simply put in his pockot;
or, as be does not wear a mantle, if it be laid upon his mantel-piece he will be quite
as well content.
t OoiDg with a pack of favourite puppies down to Greenwich, and dining at tho
hostelry yclept y* Crowne ande Scepter, appears to havo been one of this weak
prince's little weaknesses. Every child of course remombers Dibdin's llnea -

came lo grief through their extravagance, their rivalry reminds as of
the swell frog in the fable, who, as
we remember, fell a sacrifice to
swelling.
But great as was their dandyism,
we need say but little of it, for the
fashions were but very little varied
in this reign, and the costume of
both nobs and snobs was like that
of their grandfathers. The only
novelty worth note was that the
cloak-hood or capuchon which had
been worn a la cowl, was often fan-
cifully twisted and worn a la toque.
In some cases, however, it was
simply folded and balanced on the
brain-pan, as the women of the Pays
de Basque bask in it in summer-
time even to this day. From the
head dress to the head being no
frreat step, we may add here, that the
lair was curled with monstrous
care, and that beards were only
worn by old fogies and knights
templars, and great officers of state.
That the king wore one we think
we scarcely need to state, for
doubtless everybody knows how
lie was bearded on his way to the
Castle of Caernarvon; when they
who had the charge of him pulled
up by the roadside and shaved his
cherished beard, with dirty water and no soap.

EFFECTS OF THE ECLIPSE.
Our position being settled as that of the first scientific journal of
the day, of course we felt desirous, for our own interest as well as that
of all our readers, to obtain the fullest, truest, and the most particular
account of the Eclipse; and we therefore called together our sharpest-
eyed contributors, and enjoined them to spare no expense in railway-
tickets and smoked glass, and if they wished to go to Spain we said
that we would "stand the Spanish," for the purpose of observing the
most noteworthy effects. A day or two elapsed without our hearing
anything from any single one of them, or even auy of the married ones;
but on inquiring at our bankers' we discovered that they had given
proof of their existence by cashing the blank cheques which we had
given them permission, if needful, to fill up. The amounts might have
staggered any ordinary capitalist, but the sole emotion they produced
on our part was that of pleasure in the thought that the money was
well spent, inasmuch as it bad furthered scientific observation, and
would enable as no doubt to eclipse all other journals in describing the
Eclipse. But we regret that we must say our joy was a short-lived
one; for on returning with our pass-book to enter up the items, our
peace of mind was broken by a seedy-looking person. Approaching
us with somewhat of a corkserewy gyration, he solemnly deposited a
packet on our writing-desk, and whispered confidentially in a liquid
tone of voice, "Allsh'rene olecock! Sheclipsh-hic-weutotrabstbunuin!"
The delivery of this oracular remark was followed by a scarcely more
intelligible request for "a borreloshodawawr-hic if youshhic-gorritandy:"
and the remedy somewhat removing his impediment of speech, our
visitor then informed us that he and some scientific co-labourers had
been staying down at Greenwich to witness the Eclipse, aud that
the packet he bad brought contained their several reports. We must
own that we find nothing in the notes that have been handed us which
might not have been written without stirring out of London. How-
ever, as nothing has come to hand from our own staff, we shall print
from them the following selections, adding in each instance the names
of the observers, as a proof of the great confidence we place in their
reports. These will serve at all events to show the future Mkhschel
that among the queer phenomena attending the Eclipse, there were
many strange effects observed, of which no mention has been made in
any other journal, and which were scarcely less worth seeing than
those which our astronomers went all the way to Spain to Bee:—
"The effects of the Eclipso were plainly visible in Parliament. Members all
scorned in V o dark aa to what waa to he done about the China War; and how
Mr Gladstone1 a Spirit-Tax could be reconciled with the opinions expressed in hia
great speech on bringing in hia Budget."—Smith.
"Mr Flytber of the bankrupt firm of Flythxr and M'Hookit, had prepared to
take advantage of the darkness that was looked for at the time of the Eclipse, to
get the best of hia effects on board a steam-boat for Boulogne. The obsourity, how-
ever, proving less than had been counted on, an observation oould be taken of Mr.
Flytukr'b movements, and the venue of hia occultation waa altered before night-
fall from Boulogne to Bow Street."—Brown.
"Miss Furtinotcn had hoped to make guod uao of the Eclipse by managing a
teie-a-itlc with Lord free-Walter C'r<e»cs, who had unwarily arranged to Jotn her
family at Richmond. In their progress to the Park she skilfully contrived to
secure him as her escort, and bad the obscuration been as great as she expected,
perhaps the hooking of hia fortune might have been ono of its effects. There was,
however, so provjking a continuance of Light, that hie lordship, with his naked eye,
could see that she was fishing for him ; and not even at the moment of the greatest
occultation did the darkness hide sufficiently the plainness of the bait."—Jones.
"A marked magnetic variation took place during the Eclipse at the house of the
reputedly rich Mrs. Blunts, at Bayawater. The deviation was occasioned by an
observation being taken of the wilt of her late husband, wnicli has just been
exhibited at Doctors' Commons. It was discovered by this instrument that the
daughter, not the willow, of Mr. Bldntk, was his chief huiress. In consequence
of this, s voral single gentlemen who called on Mrs Blunts, on the day of the
Eclipse, showed a marked deviation from their former course; the magnet that
attracted them being, it was clear, no longer the hand of the old lady, but the
young one."—Tittle.
"Mr. Swizzler being urg-.il by a scientific friend to make a note of what 1 pre-
cipitation of moisture' accompanied the Eclipse, observed that he that day pre-
cipitated precisely twelve pints and a half of moisture down hia throat betweon tho
periods of his first and last contact with the pewter. Mr Swizzler did not make
an observation with a glass, but Ins exiwnence at onco apprisod him of the fact
that the wet waa of tho kind which by the lovotu is called 'heavy.' "—Walker.

Which, as usual, had spoiled our parade:

With our uniforms havoc had played.
My belts were all sodden, my shako so wet,

As if mere papiermdeki 'twould prove, and forget
For a hat it had duty to do.
I hastily seized it, unfit as it was—
Poor shako—a slinking to stand!
And swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas!
The peak came off, limp, in my hand!
"And such," I exclaimed, "was the Don's * foolish act

DONKEY.PASTUB.ES IN RICHMOND PARK.
During the last few years Richmond Park has been undergoing a
frradual system of subsoil drainage: sets of tile-pipes progressively
aid down in sections of the ground, piece by piece, and each piece,
consisting of several acres, consequently deformed, spoiled, and, for
more than twelve mouths,—till the clods of turf, which are dug up and
piled in ridges along the courses of the drains, have had time to sub-
side,—rendered nearly impassable. It is a remarkable fact, that the
reward of these costly operations, appropriately remunerative of the
taste which ordained them, should be, in almost every spot whereon
they have been expended, the development of a plentiful crop of—
thistles!
"The Keating of our Own Heart."
Mr, Justice Keating the other day thought proper, in speaking
from the Bench about two foolish persons who baa attempted suicide,
to say, "He supposed these people bad been reading novels." Mr,
Justice Punch would like to know the basis of his learned brother's
obiter dictum. Do novels inculcate suicide, or does novel-reading drive
people to that absurdity P He might, as reasonably have said he sup-
posed these people had been taking Keatino's Cough Lozenges, and
Mr. Punch presents the learned judge with this advertisement of those
excellent compositions, in compensation for having pointed out that he
occasionally talks nonsense.

YE CANTERBURY PILGRIMS OF 1860.
To Canterbury's festival from South werk's Tabard poured,
No widow of three husbands, no miller, friar, or lord,
No Knight of Alexandria, no clerk of Oxenforde.
Still hundreds of staunch pilgrims are journeying towards the shrine,
Not on jennet, mule, or palfrey, but along the Kentish line;
And their talk is not of martyrs, but of fleece, and flitch, and chine.
From deep green valleys on the Wharfe, from Devon's quiet lanes,
From the breeiy wolds of Brocklesby, and Wiltshire's chalky plains,—
Men of eagle-eye and delicate touch, and calm far-seeing brains.
Ye Colonel Towneley is there—who taught the Warlaby Knight to
yield,
In the days of his Windsor and Bridesmaid might,—with Culshaw
to bear his shield:
His arms two butterflies quartered, with gules on an azure field.
In vain 'gainst his Royal Butterfly four Princes in conclave met,
Fortune has smiled on the roan once more; and his buxom bride
Rosette .
Has battled the spells of the fair Queen Mab, and beat Lady Fiqot's pet.
Hard by her "the Nestor of Shorthorns" sits (on a tub or a truss) at
ease.
And countless disciples around him flock, to hear how he likes the
decrees,
Ne'er lived a rarer judge of a beast on the banks of the stately Tees.
Grundy from Rochdale has come with his Faith, determined no
fight to shirk;
Wood Rose is there to boast for herself of descent from the famed
Grand Turk;
Ay! little did Captain Gunter wot of the thorns in a rose which
lurk.
But first and second the Captain stood, with his beautiful Duckets
twins,
Liverpool judges indorsed the white, but orthodox roan now wins;
And Bedfordshire was a capital third with Claret from Clifton bins.
See near them the mottle-faced beef machines, from Hereford
pastures sent,
Shorthorns may boast of their pedigree;—" these gentlemen pay the
rent:"
But where, oh! where are the champion beasts of slow, self-satisfied
Kent?
Here too are the plums of "the juicy red line," from Turner and
Quartley'8 store j
Lancashire rules supreme with its white, and Suffolk with its black
boar;
And chesnuts from Cretingham Rookery go, as in olden time, to the
fore.
As pure in descent as a Booth or a Bates, stood Sanday's Leicester
array;
Shropshire is proud of its Patentee; and eighteen strong to the fray
Marched Jonas Webb with his Southdown tups, and Richmond can't
bid him Nay.
And the lesson these Royal pilgrims teach, is "Put some life in your
shire,
As batsmen and hoppers, you've scored right well,—but Romney
Marsh should aspire;
Just hew up for faggots your turn-wrest ploughs, and brighten your

THE POPE'S IRISH RAGAMUFFINS.
{To George Bowyeh, Esq., M.P.)
Chivalrous Sir,
As the Pope's Knight-errant, I wonder you have not come forward to
break a lance with those unworthy Irishmen—those bad Catholics—who, having
apostatised from the Papal Brigade and sneaked home, go about complaining of the
usage which they experienced in the service of his Holiness. It seems that I
must do the Holy Father's business for you.
The Irish volunteers in the service of our Lord the Pope were naturally supposed,
by bis Holiness and Lamoricieke, to be devout Catholics. As such they were
treated with the greatest possible attention. They were afforded every facility for
fasting. The means of doing penance were freely afforded them. What better fare
could a Saint wish for than an insufficiency of black bread and sour wine, wh*t
better couch could he desire than the floor of a stable? Circumstanced as the
recruits were, thev no doubt, swarmed with vermin and reeked with filth, and, if
they had expired in that blessed state, would have died in the odour of sanctity.
They complain that some of their number were shot for breach of discipline.
If so, had they not the friars of San Giovanni Decollate to confess them; and did
they not therefore go to Paradise P They even murmur because some of them
were flogged. Their grievance was a privilege. How many holy men are con-
tinually whipping one another; how many are obliged to whip themselves, not
having anybody whom they can trust to perform that pious office for them! The
ungrateful grumblers ought to have kissed the cat-of-nine-tails which "whipped
the offending Adam out of them." Excuse me for quoting a heretical poet.
What could these pilgrims expect at Macerata but being thoroughly macerated P
Had they understood their own faith—if there was auy in them—they would
have known that mortification necessarily awaited them in an army of confessors
and martyrs, and whilst they would of course have been mortified by the indignities,
privations, and punishments, to which they were subjected, they would by no
means have been disappointed, but on the contrary, perfectly well satisfied, with
the chastisement which they had to endure.
Hoping that the foregoing apology for the sacred commissariat and the holy
discipline of the Pontifical army may encourage many true Catholic devotees to
enlist in its ranks, I have the honour to remain, chivalrous
Sir, your Knighthood's humble Servant, Substitute, and
Esquiie,
P.S. It does not appear that the Holy See provided its
Irish crusaders with hair-shirts. But what then P It did
t he next best thing in not finding them any shirts at all.
And for suitable stuff to wear next the skin, they might
have found stinging-nettles enough, instead of linen in every
hedge.
THE MASSACRE OP THE INNOCENTS.
FYTTE FIRST— FEBRUARY.
It was a score of blithesome Bills—
Merrily came they in—
And fair without, looked the gamesome rout,
And neat as a new-made pin;
Each would-be law, without a flaw,
Or erasure-line within.
'Twas a sight to behold these Bills so bold,
So blithe and debontutire,
As each took his place on the paper,
Where room was still to spare,
With the Mimber that was in charge of him,
So proud of his nursling fair.
Sir Bethell le Bland, in either hand,
Led innocents many a one;
The first he was strong, and lusty and long—
With Bankruptcy writ thereon:
And a train of Law Bills followed him.
Whose godfather was "Plain John."
And proud was the mien of Gladstone, I w ei u,
As his masterful way he bote,
With Bills enow most fathers to cow,
A gambolling before:
Wines, Spirits, and Paper, and Savings Bank-',
And Hansard he knows what more!
Tho' cool of blood, and fishy of mood,
Even Lkwis was stirred with pride,
As with conscious face he took his place,
With two old Bills at his side—
One yclept City Corporation Reform—
One Highways—often-tried.
And Sir Charles de Wood, bewildered he stood,
And you scarce his head might see,
For the crowd of Bdls the space that tills
Where Sir Charles his head should be—
All Indian Bills, with porcupine quills,
A-bristling angrily.
More blithe M.P.s I trow than these,
St. Stephens did ne'er espy:
Never blither Bills, ignored the ills
That no Bill may defy!
Woe, woe, to see their Februrarie,
And to think of their July!
FYTTE SECOND—JULY.
The spring is past, the year flies fast,
The Session draggeth sore:
Till the summer tliat is no summer
E'en now is well nigh o'er?
And each bored M.P. doth sigh to be free,
And will brook to be bored no more.
Then it's up and spake Lord Palmerston,
And a cruel smile smiled he,—
"Now bring your Bills, your little Bills,
My Minis)ores, to me;
That I may choose what Bills, and whose,
Are fittest y-slain to be."
Then up and spake the Bankruptcy Bill,
That at Beth ell's knee did stand—
"Now, father dear, ye '11 save me here,
For all this Lord's command;"
But with rueful look, he the innocent took,
And stabbed with his own right hand1

(MR.) PUNCH A QUAKER.
Quakerism was said, nay shown, to be dying out. But a new phase
of the drab faith has just been manifested, and we should not wonder
if there were a Revival. A person, proclaiming himself a Quaker,
enters the meeting-house of his and the Friends, near Gracechurch
Street (in pious conversation they call it Grace-steeple-house Street),
and proceeds loudly to animadvert, in the most personal manner, upon
divers members of the Society there present. One he explained to be
a Wolf, another an Owl, and the third a Deceiver, adding other illus-
trations of character. And his justification was, he said, that it was a
Quaker doctrine, that you should always speak your mind. It occurs
to Friend Punch, that Friend Bright is the founder of this new
sect of Quakers. Their practice is very much in his style. Does he
want, a good-looking convert who delights to speak his mind? If so,
verily let him apply at No. 85, near the steeple-house carnally called
Bride's or Bridget's.
A Disinterested Opponent.
Mr. Horsmax has lately taken to make long speeches calculated
only to embarrass the Government and impede public business. The
Honourable Gentleman may feel justly aggrieved at having been ex-
cluded from the Cahinet; but then he must admit that his observations
are very much out of place.
PROCEEDINGS (P) IN BANKRUPTCY.
Before Mr. Commissioner Pouch.
There seems to be afloat a pretty general opinion, that our Basing-
liall Street Courts are not so perfect as they might be, and that, even
had they been compelled to sit till Christmas, the Government should
not have let. this wasted Sessiou go without passing in some shape
the "little Bill" they introduced for Bankruptcy Reform. To prove
how utterly erroneous are these absurd impressions, Mr. Punch begs
to report a day's proceedings in his presence—if he may apply the
term "proceedings" where there seems but little progress. Instead
of copying, however, the curt style of the reporters, Mr. Punch will
give his notes a somewhat more dramatic form: feeling justified in
doing so by a remark he overheard made by a lawyer in his presence,
that the Court work which he witnessed was as good as any play:—
Scene—A Court in Basinghall Street, tchich would be seen more clearly
tcere the windows ever washed Time—Eleven o'clock, am,, and
though it is so early, the Court is crammed with people doing the tcork
of other Courts, tchich are already far too full to hold them. The
Commissioner, as usual, has not }t arrived; hut the business of the
day commenced at ten o'clock as usual, by the Usher challenging the

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 23. Monday. The Lords were informed that the Metropolis
requires extensive Poultry and other Provision Markets, and the
Sum Midi! Bill was presented to them as the means for supplying the
want. Mr. Punch has said his say upon civic (freed, and has elicited
the explanation that only 550 square yards of Smithfield are to be con-
verted into poultry-yards, and about five times as much is to be let
alone, for the present. He does not expect the City to make Ducks
and Drakes of its money; but to convert into a Poultry-shop any of the
limited space which might have been a recreation ground for the people,
is a Foul project, and worthy of Cox (Finsbury). However, the site is
near St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and he hopes all concerned in the
plunder will catch the Chicken-pox from some out-door patient. If he
could mark his contempt for t he City by making any worse jokes on the
subject, he would do so. The Bill was read a Second time. A Bill
for relieving the Press from certain liabilities was opposed by Lobd
Chelmsford, as calculated to hinder the punishment of libellers, and
was rejected.
Lobd Palmebston announced to the House that we really must
Fortify. He meant no disrespect, to Anybody anywhere, and Nobody
had any "call" to be offended; but it would not do for England to
owe her safety to Anybody's forbearance, and she must be as strong as
Anybody else. Therefore it was proposed to lay out. about Nine
Millions of money in the way recommended by the Fortification Com-
mission. There is to be no attempt to defend London, Palmebston
considering that Mr. Punch's residence in the E. C. (or Early Closing)
District is sufficient guarantee for the impregnability of the City,
which, moreover, Pam said would have to be saved by a Battle—and
one Battle he thought would be sufficient for the purpose. But we
are to make our military and naval storehouses so safe that, happen
what may, we shall always have ample means of warfare at our com-
mand. The dockyards and arsenals generally are to be fortified.
Abont Two Millions of money are wanted at once. Palmebston made
a spirited speech, which offended Mb. Bbigut, who declared that,
come what might, the money should not be granted off-hand, and who
afterwards gave notice of a resolution against fortifying ourselves any
more. Mb. Lindsay, a ship-builder, also, of course, sees no sense in
stone walls, and means to oppose Pam.
The Monster Hebbebt then made an interesting speech on the
details of the propostd works. The places that are to be fortified are
Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Pembroke; and inasmuch as the Thames
does not smell this year, and is therefore useless as an offensive force,
about £180,000 is to be spent thereon. On the Medway, and at
Chatham, there are to be works. Dover is to be made strong, as is
Portland, and there is to be a good deal done at Cork. That is the
Government proposal for defending the kingdom against Anybody, and
it was arranged that it should he considered that day week.
On the Civil Service Estimates, our Wiscount came out. He wants
the grounds of Hampton Court used for the training of Biflemen and
as Shooting-Grounds for them. Mr Punch thinks that visitors
might like to be heard upon that subject, and that it should be a
matter of inquiry how far it would be agreeable to a couple of lovers
spooneyfying beside the fat gold-fishes, to have their sentimental con-
versation interrupted by a howl from Edwin to the effect that a conical
ball had just gone t hrough theamsangwitches in his coat-tail pocket, or
a squeal from Angelina setting forth that a similar stray missile had
knocked the steel of her Crinoline hind part before. The Wiscount
made several other suggestions, which were also treated with the most
perfect contempt. There was an idea for building a new house for the
big Car which was the only ridiculous thing at, the funeral of the Doke
of Wellington. This the Prince of Wales is of course not going to
have choking up the court-yard of his house in Pall Mall, and Mb. Cow-
plB does not seem to know what to do with it. Considerable sarcasm
was launched at. the Car, and Mr. Cowper finally withdrew the vote,
piteously declaring, however, that he must have some place to put it in.
Why on earth, if it is to be preserved at all, is it not put into the Hall of
Chelsea Hospital, where the old Land-Crabs might pick up an occasional
sixpence by showing it, and lying about their own achievements under
the Duke, just as the old Sea-Crabs do at Greenwich about Nelson P
Tuesday. The Lords got through a good deal of business, and
Ellekbobough made a little speech which deserves to be remembered.

Whether its grace is materially increased by the fact that the speaker's
father was a Taw lord, is a matter for anybody who cares about it:—
"The Earl or Ejxenborotth said, he always felt a difficulty in understanding
the state of the case when he had heard three or four law lords discuss it, especially
if they spoke at any length. {Laughter.)"
The Commons had a fight on the Poor-Law Board Continuance Bill,
which went through Committee, though not until the Government had
been defeated on the question, whether the Board, like Pompey in the
play, was to "continue " for five years or three, the latter alternative
being carried by 147 to 92.
Loed John Russell had the pleasure of announcing to the House
that the Kino or the Two Sicilies was. by his own act, the Kin? of
One Sicily only, he having been obliged to order that the island be
evacuated by his troops. It is stated that this announcement is pre-
mature. It is also said that the King of Sardinia sent to Garibaldi
to beg he would not think of attacking the mainland; but Garibaldi,
curiously, happening to be out of the way, of course the King's
message could not reach him.
Mr. O'Brien wanted the Government to make it a condition on
board the mail-packets they subsidised, that there shall be none of that
system of insulting coloured ladies and gentlemen of which we have
lately heard so much. Mr. Laing replied, that all the colourable
interest of Government in these ships' concerns is the safe conveyance
of what is down in Black and White in the letters. A long debate
on the present absurd system of Promotion and Retirement in the
Navy followed, Sir John Pakington demanding an inquiry into the
subject, which demand was successfully resisted by the Ministers.
Wednesday. Sir G. C. Lewis drew a whole row of the teeth of the
Ecclesiastical Commission Bill, by withdrawing all the clauses on
which serious fight was offered, and the measure being thus rendered
almost useless, the House discussed it, in Committee, with much
affability.
Thurtday. In the Felony Bill it was enacted by the Lords that counsel
for the prisoner shall have the right of reply only when the Judge
thinks it necessary. Mr. Punch is rather inclined to agree with Lord
Ellenborough, that this is rather unfair upon the Judge, who will
very likely permit many a needless harangue rather than be charged
with shutting up the advocate's mouth. As regards the interests of
justice, there does not seem to be any harm in the arrangement, or
that a criminal will be much more likely to get off because his man has
the last word. Mr. Justice Punch woulcl feel it his duty to be par-
ticularly clear in his summing up after such an address, and would
certainly not be, as the Judge in old time, was called, Counsel for the
prisoner.
The Bill with (or rather without) the Drawn Teeth went through
Committee. The Chancellor op the X. informed Mr. Bright
that the one and elevenpenny Rap just inflicted on Spirits was to be
permanent spirit-rapping. Lord John Russell stated, that the King
op Naples had begged the Government of England to insist on
Garibaldi's accepting an armistice, aud that the Government of
England had informed the King op Naples that they would see him
in Acheron first, and then they wouldn't, whereat the House cheered.
Mr. Laing stated, that the Post Office Report was under consideration.
Mr. Punch's private Spirits have informed him of ont thing in it which,
when disclosed, he proposes to make a precious row about. Lord
Palmerston then, after a good deal of grumbling and growling from
the Opposition and others, took away another large piece of the little
time now left to independent Members. The Gas Tyrants Correction
Bill was passed, on the motion of Sir John Shelley, who deserves
the title of the Gas Garibaldi.
After a sentimental little motion of Mr. Hennesst had been squashed
by 73 to 15, the important Bill about the Indian Army came on again,
and after some debating, a motion for adjournment was made, to which
Loud Palmerston assented, saying.—
"It is the duty of Hen Majesty's Ministers to ait here and listen to any length of
speeches that Honourable Gentlemen may choose to make, and to any length of
extracts that they may tender us. (A laugh and cluert.) Of course, whon an
'Honourable Member is at a loss for other a'gumeuts, it is very natural that he
should make out bis speech by reading. (' Htar.' and a lawuh.) Her Majkkty's
! Government attach great importance to this Bill. Our patience is inexhaustible,
unci we are quite prepared to tit here until ChrUtmae in order to pass it. (//far,
hear.)"
This did not exactly tend to sweeten the tempers of some of the
opponents of the Bill, which Colonel Sires declared would greatly
rile the 49S0 British officers in the local service, besides ruining the
Indian Empire. This debate was acrimoniously resumed next night,
and again adjourned till the Monday, so that it might delightfully
interfere with the Fortifications discussion.
A Bill for interfering with Theatres and Public-Houses had been
introduced, but in consequence of the publication of a letter on the
subject from the Christy Minstrels, who would be affected by its action,
it was withdrawn, and the poetical person who writes the gibberish
chanted by these begrimed parties received orders to prepare a song of
jubilee. He sent an early copy to Mr. Punch, who is much pleased
with it, and considers it quite up to the mark of the Christy poetry.
The first of the fifty-three verses goes thus:—
"Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Yaw, yaw, yaw.
Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Him shan't be law.
Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Yap, yap, yap.
Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Dat's a good chap.
Take away, &c, &c, &c, &c."
Friday. The British Coroner savours a good deal of the British
Beadle. He is usually either a spoutiag Doctor or a pushing Attorney,
and he gets his place by a desperate canvass, with placards aud all the
vulgar machinery of a parochial struggle. When in office, his business
is to hold as many inquests as he possibly can, because he is paid out
of fees on separate cases. It is therefore to his interest that as many
persons should make away with themselves or be made away with as
possible. A Bill for making him a little less obnoxious to the public
was this evening read a Second time. The Coronets avowed considerable
contempt for the Coroners.
The Session and Season are now telling upon everybody. People
get weary, cross, and careless; and even Mr. Punch himself is conscious
of occasionally emitting an epigram whose excellent wit is not quite
polished up to his habitually preternatural effulgence. He sometimes
fives gold—the purest, doubtless, but only gold—instead of diamonds,
he fact is, that it is time to leave town, and bathe the soul in shady
woods. Any person who is up to his ordinary mark during the last part
of the Season is a Snob, and not Elegant aud Sought After. Any journal
that is as well written in September as in May is written by Snobs.
These remarks are not made in any Aristocratic spirit of Swell-dom—
Mr. Punch conceived them while eating a cold sausage and leaning at
the door of a country public-house—but to apologise for the House of
Commons, which is just now dawdling, twaddling, and every now aud
then having a violent scold. Palmbrston to-night rebuked the Oppo-
sition for hindering aud talking, aud advised Members to avail them-
selves of every opportunity of holding their tongues, whereat Disraeli
blazed up, and said that all the loss of time and good measures arose
from the Government-Coalition having, merely for factious purposes,
and to keep their places, wasted the Session on an Illusory Treaty and
a Moonshine Reform Bill. Even big Bentinck, of Norfolk, has grown
nervous, and thinks all the foreigners in London are going to rise aud
pull up the telegraph-posts and tear up the railways. We must all get
out of town.
THE PAPAL BRIGADIER'S RETURN.
The Irish Boy is come back from Rome,
In a seedy suit you'll find him:
He brings large holes in his breeches borne,
And his coat slit up behind him.
"Land of bosh!" cried the downy card,
"Though Priests may howl, be aisy:
Some lads have cut the Papal g lard—
Some greenhorns, duped, not crazy."
The Boy was done, but the Papal chain
Could not keep his shrewd soul under;
The swag he expected, he didn't gain;
So he fouud he'd made a blunder.
And said, "No Pope shall humbug me;
My soul abhors base knavery.
I '11 never fight, gratis, against the Free,
For Popery and for Slavery!"
WE OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL.
In Forbes Winslow's new book, among some very singular accounts
of the beneficial results of accidents to persons of feeble lutelleet, is a
statement that a supposed Idiot, having received a violent blow on the
head, became a practising Barrister. Mr. Punch, ever since reading
this anecdote, has beeu puzzling over the Law List to try to find out
who the party is. He has his suspicions on the subject, but it is
premature to disclose them. Meantime he has resolved to be very
careful for the future how he indulges his own favourite practice of
giving idiots a rap on the head, lest lie should be unwarily creating
mure Barristers than at preseut afflict creation.
OUR SANGUINE PRIEND.
The Honourable Member for Birmingham opposes the loan for the
fortification of our dockyards. He evidently takes too Bright a view
of the armaments of our neighbours.

CHAPTER XXV.—LOVELY WOMAN IN THE REIGNS
EDWARD THE FIRST AND SECOND.
T is painful to reflect that
in spite of all the boasted
gallantry of man, ladies'
dresses have at all times
more or less been jeered at,
or been sneered at by the
gentlemen: perhaps because
1 he latter think that, as they
have to pay for it, they may
as well from their wives'
finery get all the fun they
can. The time of the First
Edward certainly formed
no exception to this rule,
mid its long dresses ana
large gorgets were pretty
nearly as much ridiculed as
the wide dresses and small
bonnets have been in our
own day. For the credit of
our countrymen, it should
however be observed, that
the French writers were
certainly the cruelest of the
critics: the famous Roman
de la Rose being specially
distinguished by the sharp-
ness of its satire, which,
unlike the shafts of ridicule
from Mr. Punch's armoury,
was sometimes shot beyond the boundaries of decency and truth. As
it took a whole half-century to write this single poem,* there was
plenty of time of course to correct it for the press, and we cannot
excuse its authors for neglecting to have done so. Had their birth-
time been postponed until this more polished period, they would have
known that coarse expressions admit, of no defence, inasmuch as want
of decency, it is allowed, is want of sense.
The Roman was written in France and treated of French fashions:
but of course these soon became adopted in this country, for we
always take our fashions, like our farces, from the French. This im-
portation was moreover much assisted at this period by a royal double
marriage in the year 1298; when Edward the First espoused the
sister of Philip the Fourth of France, whose daughter was united
to Ned's son, the Prince of Wales. This Philip was distinguished
by the nickname of "Le Bel," and as no doubt he "wery much
applauded " his two sons-in-law for coming in to take a couple of women
off his hands, there seems to be some cause to suppose he supplied each
with a ring. How many clergymen assisted at this royal double marriage,
we have not patience to search through the registers to learn: but we
think were such a ceremony gone through in our day, we should
expect at least a score of parsons to take part in it. Now that Mr.
Smith can't get spliced to Miss Jones without the help of some half-
doien reverend assistants, we may assume that for a brace of royal
happy couples, the hymeneal halter would hardly be thought binding,
unless the knot were tied by twenty-parson power.
Leaving our lady readers to debate this knotty point, we proceed
now to describe the costume of their ancestresses, who lived during
the reigns of the First and Second Edward, in the sixty years, less
five (we loye to be particular), between the year 1272 and 1327.
Their dress, we find, consisted of the robe or gown (which now was
also called a kirtle) made with long tight sleeves and fastened high
up in the neck, much as it was worn during the reign of Henrt the
Second, and, with but trifling variation, had indeed been ever since.
A train was, however, now added to the garment, and this train appears
to have fired the mines of satire of the cynical, and caused several
explosions of wrath at its great length. One male wTetch says: "Ye
maydens doe moche resemble maggpyes, seeing both of ym have tajles
which doe draggle in j* dirtc;" and another monster hints that pos-
sibly long trains were worn to hide large feet, a sneer which is indulged
in by a third insulting creature, a fiend in poet's form, who tells us :—
"5 knotoe a tnaptirnt faprt to m.
Hake cart! take tart!
Jtyrr robe is loner—as hit feete mag be:
i3cbja«arc! 13etoa»art!
311 pe inho toolSr hie suitors be,
STruste not to more than pc can set!"
• William Dt Louis, who began It, diod in the year 1260, and John de Mecn
it circa 1304.
The sleeveless cyclas or supertunic was still worn over the robe, and,
we are told, was made so long that ladies were obliged to hold it up
with one hand to prevent their treading on it. The mantle too was
worn pendent down behind as it had been before: being fastened on
the shoulders by silken cords and tassels, and bordered with a rich
embroidery of gold. The ladies, we learn, used it "on state occasions
only;" but whether formal morning-calls or stiff and stately tea-fights
were included in this phrase, we have now no means of knowing.
Among the habits of the leaders of the fashion at this period, we must
not omit to notice their bad habit of tight-lacing; which sad and silly
practice, we have shown, was in existence in the reign of William
Rufus, but since that time had very wisely been discarded. In "y Laye
of Syr Launfal," written about the year 1300, we find the Ladt
Triamore described i
11 Clad in purple paU,
With gentyll body and middle email;"
and the same poem thus speaks of a couple of "fayre damosels " whom
Syr Launfal meets "by accident" (?) in the middle of a forest (!)—

COSTUME OF THE ARISTOCRACY. TEMP. EDWARD THE SECOND. (rKOM A BEAVTiri'L
ILLUMINATION IN "Y» LATE Or STR LAUNrAL.

Y-laced ematL jolyf, and woU,
There mote none gayer go:

Y-bordered with gold right well y-setto,
Y-pollured with gris and gros;
Their heads were dight well withal,
Bverich had on a jofyf coronal.
With sixty joms and mo."
What these two young ladies were up to in the forest in such gor-
geous array, is a point on which the scandal-monger if he likes may
speculate. Our impression is, that they had been invited to a pic-nic,
and fearing lest that dear Syr Launfal might absent himself, they
enticed him into promising to meet them in the forest, where he might
indulge in an innocent flirtation, under the plea of walking with them
to protect them from the frogs.
A very ugly species of wimple called a gorget came somewhat into
fashion in the first of these two reigns, and was worn occasionally also
in the second. John de Mkun describes it as a piece of linen
wrapped some two or three times round the neck, and then, being
fastened with a dreadful lot of pins, raised on either side the face as
high up as the ears. "Pardieu!" he exclaims, "I have often thought
in my heart, when I have seen a lady so closely tied up, that her neck-
cloth was either nailed unto her chin, or that she had the pins hooked
into her flesh." In further chaff he calls the gorget "la towelle," a
name which seems to hint that ladies had been known to use it for a
towel, first taking the precaution to take out all the pins. He also
makes a not very delicate remark in stating that the horn like pro-
jections of the gorget were stuck out, at a little distance from the face,
so that,—
"Entro la temple et les comes pourroit passer un rat,
Ou la groigneur moustelee qui eoit jusques Arras."
Inde sondel" may mean either Indian silk, or light blue silk; for "Iudo"
ten used to designate that colour.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
We omitted to record that in the reign of Henry the Third the
mode of wearing the hair was changed, and that instead of being
plaited in long tails as it was in the twelfth century, it was simply
turned up behind, and confined in a gold net. This fashion continued
in the following two reigns, and indeed remained in vogue throughout
the fourteenth century. By some writers we find the net or fret is
called a "canl," but since our dictionary deflnes this as the "network
of a wig," our gallantry forbids us from applying such a term to the
head-dress of a lady. Girls doubtless used these nets to assist them in
the work of fishing for a husband, and seeing that the fashion has been
recently revived, we may presume it has been found productive of net
profit.
Viewed in the light of the old illuminations, the ladies of this period
were either sadly shamefaced, or painfully susceptible to toothache and
sore throat. A kerchief and a veil were often worn besides the gorget,
and fair necks and faces really were so swathed and swaddled up that
there were scarcely three square inches of their surface left saint able.
Whence this anti-kiss-me-quick sort of mania could have sprung from,
the learnedest of writers (we mean, of course, ourselves) are unable to
determine; but the fashion appears certainly of oriental origin, and for
some cause the Crusaders may have possiblyamported it. A husband
must be a great Turk, or else clearly a great muff, to muffle his wife's
cheeks up so that scarce an inch is kissable; and had the Cruelty-
Prevention Society been extant, it might fitly have prohibited so
barbarous a practice. To the sensitive in mind it is afflicting to reflect
what dreadful deprivations the ladies must have suffered from it; for
one would as soon nave thought of taking a mummy under the mistletoe,
as a girl choked in the head-gear of the fourteenth century.
SICE OF THE SEASON, AND SICE OF THE SESSION.
A BUCOLIC FROM THE BACK BENCHES.
Who will take me out of London? Who will set me by the sea P
Who will plant my foot on heather, where the grouse rise strong and
free?
Who will rid me of the dinners—Heav'n be thanked, more rare they
grow—
Their ^pergnes and flowers and flambeaux—vapid gossip, fuss and
show?
Who will save me from these stuffy, sweltering, stupid routs and
drums,
Where the belles look limp and languid, as the wished-for August
comes P
Who will free me from this tread-mill, with its weary, weary, grind,
Club and Commons, ride and crush-room, wasting body, wearing
mind P
Who will find me air for breathing, innocent of London smoke P
Take the set mask from the features P Take the staleness from the
jokeP
Who the Morning Post will banish from my daily tea and toast P
Who will give me better music than the Opera can boast P
Titiens is a fine soprano, and Rose Csillao pipeth well;
And Alboni's a great creature—in her song and shape as well.
But I'm sick of foreign squallers—sick of Tweedles, dee. and dum,
Sick to wishing all brass sdent, and all cat-gut stricken dumb.
And with more than common sickness, I am sick of Commons' prate,
Of the Morning sittings early, and the Evening sittings late.
Sick of strangling all the good Bills, which some interest offend;
Sick of passing ail the bad Bills, which there's no time to amend.
Sick, oh sick of Mr. Horsman's "taking up" and setting down;
Sick of voting supplemental millions, under Mr. Gladstone's frown.
Sick of being whipped up, at all hours, to divide, or make a house,
With the knowledge that the Session won't respect the "sacred
grouse."
Wherefore was I born to greatness, wherefore did I seek a seat?
I, whose tastes were stock and shooting, growing roots and fattening
meat P
Hide, oli hide me, mother Nature, in thy glad and glorious green;
Take me back into the country, while a corn-field's to be seen.
Let me breathe the purple fallows—watch the waving of the grain,
Feel my Shorthorn's ribs and shoulders underneath my hand again!
But I wander in my fancies—there's that vile division bell,
To all hopes of calm and country tinkling an enforced farewell.
I am knit unto my party. I must sit at their command,
While Disraeli can find dodges, and Big Ben has words on hand.
I must sit, and barred from all that to my being pleasure yields,
Thus unto the blinding Bude-lights sadly babble of green fields.

"The auctioneer feels relieved from a prolixity of details while introducing this
fascinating property to public attention: yet so completely is ho beset by objects of
the most lively interest, no less to those in search of the materialism of a judicious
investment of capital, than to minds soaring above the philosophy of the ledger,
that for a moment the solid, the substantial, the positive, the real elements of
wealth may be lost Bight of in the contemplation of a scenery so associated with the
past, and where memorials through the mist of ages offer a chapter upon the history
of Chipchase Castle, grand in attitude, within too bosom of ancestral woods, and

Into active form, and proclaiming in the midst of a primitive people the immortal
glories of the genius of George Stephenson.—Ma. Kobson will show the estate"
The words of Mercury would be harsh after the songs of Apollo—or
Ceres aforesaid, and Mr. Punch permits himself no comment. But he
must congratulate Mr. Donk-in on having secured the services of
Mr. Robson to show the property—we presume when the Olympic
season is over. Nothing could be more proper. Mr. Robson's own
health will be promoted on the banks of the most pellucid of rivers,"
while, in reading aloud the above particulars, with which Mr. D. will
supply him for the instruction of visitors, the great comedian will feel
thoroughly at home, inasmuch as he will imagine himself reciting one
of his own burlesques. He may even introduce, appropriately to the
Castle, the song of Ben Barter, with the burden—

Mr. Robson's kind consent to show the estate does him great credit,
and Mr. Punch trusts that Mr. R. will derive as much amusement
from his novel occupation as Mr. P. has done from the above delightful
announcement. The single part of it which he does not quite appre-
ciate is the reference to the Heraldry of the herons, and he can
explain it only by supposing that in the advertisement there is some-
thing herroneous.

Note, what a good-for-nothing spiteful Oirl that Jemima must have been, when her kind Mistress (who could not put up with her goings-on any
longer) gave her a Month's Warning, to serve her so with til* Palmer's Candle, pretending the Spring slipped accidentally.
ACCIDENTS AND OFFENCES.
At Lewes Assizes, the other day, a poor young man was indicted for
the manslaughter of his mother. He had!—having received a medical
education—been in the habit of administering to her hydrocyanic acid
for the relief of sickness. She died, after having taken what was con-
1'ectured to be an overdose, poured out by the merest accident. For
laving been supposed to have had the misfortune to kill his mother—
whom he fondly loved—in the earnest endeavour to prolong her life,
this good son was by some justice, justices, or coroner's jury, no
matter which—sent to take his trial as a felon! There was not the
slightest proof that he had given an excessive dose; and he was of
course acquitted. But even if he had made a fatal blunder, it would
have been not only unintentional, but most pitiably the reverse of
intentional. Who but a fool would presume culpable negligence in
such a case? Who with a particle of benevolence, with a grain of
sense, would have sent such a case for trial? Aggravate the unspeak-
able misery of that dutiful unfortunate son by placing him in a felon's
dock! What dense stupidity, and what monstrous cruelty!
Melancholy as this case was, the evidence for the prosecution can
hardly well be conceived to have afforded occasion for merriment. A
particular point in it, however, seems to have wonderfully diverted the
hearers, who may have known the reason why. The fun. however, in
the following question put to a surgeon about the strengtii of prussio
acid, will be generally considered inscrutable:—
"Tbe Lord Chief Justice. What do you say is the difference between a 1 minim'
and a 'drop?' (A laugh.)"
Where's the wit P Again—we quote the Post:—
"Serjeant Ballantine, to tbe witness. If yon were told to aire a patient go
many minims, should you give him so many 1 drops?' (A laugh.)
"Witness. Certainly not (Renewed laughter.)"
What joke is there in the question as to the difference between a
minim and a drop P A minim is a drop of nniform size measured by a
graduated glass, a drop is a variable quantity dropped out of a bottle.
There is no quibble or equivocation m the words, and nothing loath-
some in the ideas. What did the gentle dulnesa of Lewes see to
laugh at P
But even if Mb. MERRYMAif, in Merryman's motley, had stood in
the witness-box. grinning from ear to ear, the piteousness of the case
might have hindered his grimaces from setting on barren spectators to
laugh too. Sorrow and indignation would possess any honest heart at
the sight of a son standing his trial for felony, because he met with a
mischance in practising the Fifth Commandment. No doubt there
are those who would insist on enforcing responsibility in all cases of
accidental homicide, with a view to public safety, and an especial eye
to their own. "Prevent mistakes irrespectively of right or wrong.
Never mind abstract justice—mercy, consideration, compassion be
blanked! Punish a blunder as you would a crime. Treat an unfor-
tunate man as a guilty one for the protection of the community in
general, and particularly of myself." This is the language of these
gentlemen; and it is the language of immoral selfishness. Trust
nobody who talks it, unless in trusting him you can rely on his pride,
vanity, covetousness, or other low motives. Such language is also tbe
language of folly. It is calculated to deprive its utterer of medioal
attendance in any case of danger. Surgeons are not likely to risk a
bold remedy, or venture a hazardous operation with the fear, in case of
unforeseen misadventure, of an indiotment for manslaughter before
their eyes.
10 BACCHE!
Tub Empebob op the Fbbnch has been fixing the price of cigars
in France. This is to vary from five centimes to fifty—say from a half-
penny to fivepence. It may be held, therefore, that for fivepence a
French gentleman may procure the very best cigar he need smoke.
Then why, in the name of all that is Detestable, can't Mr. Punch get
first-class weeds at the same price P Why has he to pay Ninepence, if
he wants the real thing that does him goodP Of course there are
Penny Pickwicks and trash of that kind, but he smokes for enjoyment,
health, and soothing. Mb. Bright is a smoker, and ought to have
provided for this in the Treaty. Mr. Punch cannot trust himself to speak
freely on so outrageous a state of things. Why are there no good cheap
cigars in London P he asks once more: and Echo answers that there is
a want of system" somewhere, though not of a system of imposition.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 30. Monday. Lord Clyde, introduced by Lord Punch,
took the oaths and his seat in the House of Lords, so that the saviour
of India, though far inferior in rank to Cardigan, or Liu an, or
Norm an by, or Westminster, is now as good a man as most of the
bishops, as Jones Loyd, or as Vernon Smith. But Lord Punch
begs to say that he has no notion of leaving things where they are, and
that he recommends those who have the means of setting the Fountain
of Honour in play, to send a very handsome shower-bath of honour in
the direction of Lord Clyde, or Lord PuNcn may turn the stream of
his own indignation in the direction of (the negligent parties, fancy a
Lucan having precedence over a Colin Campbell!
Lord John Russell has sent out Lord Dufperin as our Commis-
sioner for settling the affairs of Syria. This nobleman is a very good
yachtsman, and a man who is good at yachting is generally good at
most other things. He is not—
"A slave,
Whose Tory soul would sicken at the wave,"
but usually a manly, wide-awake, intelligent, self-reliant fellow. One
of this class of Englishmen saved Tyre the other day, by putting his
vessel and his guns in such a position that the savage Druses were
afraid to attack. We make no aoubt that Dufferin will manage very
well. After this appointment had been announced, there was a row
originating with Mr. Horsman, who has got the combative element
strong upon him, and who insisted on speaking, and blew up the
Speaker himself for trying to put him down. Mr. Punch is far from
regarding Mr. Horsman with any red-tapey dislike, and on the con-
trary, holds that it is very desirable that upon occasion Members
should speak out their minds, and not let any bureaucratic swagger
and self-conceit be too strong for them. But there is reason in roasting
of eggs, and also in roasting of Ministers, and Mr. Horsman should
be temperate. At present the Wild Horsman is about as terrible an
apparition to an English Minister as the Wild Huntsman to a German
peasant; but the chief end and object of a British Senator is not the
scaring one of the Queen's servants into a fit.
Talking about the Fortifications, the Monster missed the opportunity
of making a good and vulgar joke. Sir Charles Napier objected to
the proposed defences at a certain place called Browndown, and the
Monster Herbert replied, admitting the difficulty of getting there.
If he had chasen to be at once low and irrelevant, he might have said,
that the interruptions to the vote for the Fortifications money made
the real difficulty in getting a Brown down; but we are very glad that
he was not so coarse and objectionable. The Indian Army Fusion Bill
Debate was resumed, and new objections were raised to the scheme,
and a division took place, which Mr. Punch records, in order to show
how many Members thought it worth while to stay and discuss the
gravest business now before Parliament. Sir J. Fergusson's motion,
in opposition to a plan which Lord Palmerston declared to be so
important that he would sit till Christmas to carry it, was rejected by
88 to 50. Had there been a personal squabble, or some trumpery
matter into which personality could be imported, the division would
have been a couple of hundred on each side. The struggle on the Bill
was protracted; but Palmerston saying that as long as health and
strength permitted, he would resist a factious opposition, the House
went into Committee, and the Bill passed through it. Sir Charles
Wood promised that all pledges given to any of the Indian soldiers,
or in connection with the local army, should be faithfully redeemed.
Tuesday. Lord Lyttleton opposed the New Zealand Bill; but the
Government think it rather important that the Land question should
be set at rest, as a system of conveyancing which is illustrated by the
occasional killing the tenant for life, and eating the cross remainders
over, is rather in arrear of the age. So the Bill was passed.
Lord John Russell was asked, whether the Emperor of the
French had not sent an uncommonly affectionate letter to this
country, as stated by the Morning Post. Lord John said that, such
was the fact, but that, as the letter was strictly private, he could not
produce it. The following day, of course, the letter was in all the
newspapers. Mr. Punch avows himself greatly touched by his Imperial
Brother's missive, especially by the piquant bit: "Eh bien. Lord
Palmerston knows me; and when I say a thing, he will believe it."
Mr. Punch is rejoiced that the Emperor means nothing but peace,

liberty, conquest in France, and cordial co-operation with England;
and in order that England may be worthy of such affection, she—just
as a loving wife educates herself np to be worthy of her husband—will
fortify herself with every increase of strength that may tend to place
her on an equality with her adorer. Then, to pursue the conjugal
metaphor, they will converse delightfully, because they will thoroughly
understand one another.
Colonel French had been reading the Rejected Addresses, and had
been evidently inspired by the imitation of Tom Moore :—
"For dear is the Emerald Isle of the Ocean.
Whose daughters are fair as the foam of the wave,
Whose sons, unaccustomed to rebel commotion,
Though joyous, are sober—though peaceful, are brave.
The Shamrock their Olive, sworn foe to a quarrel,
Protects from the thunder and lightning of rows,
Their sprig of shillelah is nothing but laurel,
That flourishes rapidly over their brows."
With these convictions strong upon him, the gallant Colonel de-
manded that the Irish should be allowed to form Volunteer Corps.
Mr. Cardwell, for Government, said that we did not distrust Irish
loyalty, but really . Up sprang Ma. Maguire, and testified to
the extreme advantage of arming Ireland, by stating that if the
French invaders came, they would not be received by the Irish as foes.
Lord Palmerston is not the man to let such a speech go unimproved,
and on division, 86 to 30 voted against Colonel French, or rather,
the French Colonel. Mr. Ewart made an attempt to get Members to
confine their discussion of the Principle of a Bill to certain stages
thereof, instead of mixing up big and little matters in the present
feminine fashion. But beyond a grumbling admission that things were
badly managed, nothing came of Mr. Ewart** proposals. It occurs,
also, to Mr. Punch, that an arbitrary rule might be difficult of observ-
ance. The extinct Reform Bill had no principle for people to speak
on, and therefore, on Mr. Ewart's plan, must have been destroyed in
solemn silence. The House treated itself to a Count Out, materially
promoted by some oratory from Mr. Hennesst.
Wednesday. There was a fight over the Metropolis Local Manage-
ment Bill Mr. Brady, Member for Leitrim, and Licentiate of the
Apothecaries Society, led the attack; but what this Hibernian JSscu-
lapius has to do with the London parishes, it is not very clear. .How-
ever, the Licentiate had only 13 votes, what he would call "a dirthy
thirteener." Various clauses moved by private Members were rejected,
and the dynasty of the Board of Works was confirmed in all its irre-
sponsible tyranny. The despots, however, had better beware—there is
yet existing the window in Whitehall which let in a new light upon
the duties of sovereigns.
Thursday. The Lords merely shoved on business at a capital speed,
as became sportsmen who had but nine days between them and St.
Grouse.
In the Commons, Sir George Bowter (copy the address, in order
to remember that our friend the Cardinal's Cross-Bearer and the Pope's
apologist is now a Baronet) tried to get up a story against Garibaldi,
and Lord John's tone, as he replied that he had no information on the
subject, was more supercilious than usual, and we can hardly blame his
manifestation of contempt. Bowter must be put into a curricle with
Normanby, and then, if Mr. Punch holds the whip, he flatters himself
that he will *' make the raw material fly."
The debate on the Fortifications followed. Mr. Lindsay, the ship-
builder, opposed them, and was perfectly happified by the Emperor's
letter. Henry Berkeley thought we ought to defend ourselves with
our own good right arms, a bit of idiotcy that was very properly
derided. The Monster had every confidence in the Emperor s inten-
tions, but "circumstances were sometimes stronger than men." Mb.
Bright joined Mb. Lindsay, and described those who had advocated
the fortifications as a Set of Lunatics, for which Mb. Horsman, casti-
fator-general to the House of Commons, laid into Mb. Bright pretty
eartily. There was a long debate, and after Lord Palmerston had
declared that the best way to maintain peace was to be in a position to
defend ourselves against insult, a division was taken, and there were
for Fortifying 268, against it 39.
Friday. For reasons of his own, which anybody may ascertain by
sending a directed and stamped envelope ana a £10 note, Mr. Punch

enclosing a delicate mesh, or net-work of very fine magnetic steel
wire. The immense superiority of this elegant contrivance is obvious
from the consideration that the hair of the person who sleeps in the
magnetic nightcap is exposed all night to the action of the magnetic
fluid, a fluid much more efficacious than any other capillary fluid
for beautifying the hair, which it affects by a peculiar capillary
attraction.
During the day, the magnetic nightcap is folded up and enclosed in
a neat iron casket, or it may be kept in an old saucepan or teakettle.
The object of these precautions is to prevent its magnetism from
escaping, which happens whensoever a magnet is not in action. The
iron armature of the magnetic brush answers the same purpose; but
unscientific ladies often forget to remove it when they use the brush,
of which, in that case, it monopolises the virtue; whereas no such
mistake can possibly be made with the magnetic nightcap.
Neuralgia, rheumatism, stiff joints, and &c, are much more effec-
tually cured by the magnetic nightcap than they can possibly be by
instruments which, subjecting the head for a few minutes only to the
influence of magnetism, can extract but little iron from it at a time.
Worn on the night after the most copious indulgence at the festive
board, the magnetic nightcap will be found a never failing prophylactic
against a headache the next morning. It is therefore invaluable to the
gourmand and votary of Bacchus.
The magnetio nightcap may be had beautifully embroidered and
adorned with a splendid tassel. All those gentlemen and ladies whom
the cap will fit are recommended to wear it.
Archery and Rifle Practice.
The Rifle in the hands of Englishmen will soon be a weapon sup-
plying the place of the ancient long-bow. It will be necessary to make
a corresponding change in a popular idiom—to call, for example, our
wonderful spirit-storytellers, long rifle-shots.

opinion, that the sooner the Druses are scotch'd the better.

The Honourable Member for Stroud has acquired considerable

RESTORATIVE IN SLUMBER.
mono the most wonderful of
the inventions of the present
day are the patent magnetic
brushes and combs, in which
an advertising philosopher,
to quote his own words, has
most beautifully developed
the mysterious power of the
magnet. This power, as de-
veloped by that philosopher
in his brushes, is indeed truly
mysterious. It is exerted by
a magnet enclosed within the
back of the brush; and acts
as a remedy for grey hair,
and also for weak or falling
hair, and besides, for neural-
gia, nervous headache, rheu-
matism, stiff joints, &c. The
magnet is supposed to ope-
rate, in curing greyness, by
its attraction for iron. Per-
fect hair contains iron. Grey
hair does not contain iron.
The magnet attracts the iron
which the grey hair does not
contain. According to this
theory, therefore, the magnet
raises the oxide of iron out of the blood, and draws it up into the
interior of each hair. How easily this is to be effected any fool may
convince himself by taking the blackest hair and the strongest magnet
he can get, and trying how much of the hair the magnet will lift. Or
he may chop the hair in minute pieces, and see if they will not stick
to the magnet like iron filings. Of course neuralgia, nervous headache,
rheumatism, stiff joints, and the numerous diseases comprehended
under the head of, &c, are caused by an excess of iron, which the
magnet eliminates from the blood.
As oxide of iron is rust, it might naturally be feared that the use of
magnetic brushes would turn the hair rusty; but experience has
proved that there is no ground for this apprehension.
The success which has been obtained by the magnetic brush has
a much more eligible invention for the same
induced Punch to devise _
purpose. This is a magnetic nightcap, which consists of soft cotton,

SOLDIERING AND SHOPPING.
Your attention, if yon please, ladies, to the following short paragraph
which we take for your perusal from a morning contemporary, whose
columns being devoted more to politics and commerce may not be so
well familiar to you as are those of Punch:—
*' A considerable number of the principal tradesmen of the West End have met
and agreed to close their establishments early on Saturday afternoon, so as to give
tho young persons in their employ tho benefit of a fair evening's holiday. This is
a gracious and considerate resolution, and one that the public, which has helped on
the Early Closing Movomont by its warm approval, will not fail to sanction and
support. It is proposed to close tho shops on Saturdays at four in the winter and
at five in the summer months. These hours are not too early, if the young people
are to get out for a breath of air in the fields, or for a couple of hours' Volunteer
drill. A great deal might be said in favour of two o'clock all the year round; but
the measure is an innovation in the retail trade of London, and it is wise not to
attempt too much. Of course it would be hopeless to attempt to carry out a
measure of this kind against the wishes of the fair patrons of trade. But the is
the less reason to suppose that this will be withheld, inasmuch as the proposed
arrangement is to some extent an act of deference to their wishes. Tho Rifle Corps
of the Metropolis, as we all know, are to a large extent constituted of young men
employed in houses of business, and overy one must wish that they may have in
weekly drill opportunities of healthful active exercise while they qualify themselves
to become, in case of need, defenders of tboir country. If then the ladles generally
will kindly countenance a change which bos been aotively promoted by some who.
are the ornaments of their sex, the transition to new and better arrangements will
be easily accomplished, and here, as so often happens with seeming difficulties, U
n'y a que It premier pat qui couU."
Gallantry forbids, ladies, that we should think that any one of you
can be otherwise than sensible; and we hold therefore it cannot be
"against your wishes" that they who would, if need be, fight in your
defence should be well qualified to do so. Now counter-jumping may
be labour, but it is not manly exercise; and although in some degree
the muscles may be strengthened by it, no one can regard it as fit
practice for a soldier. Unless therefore young shopmen hare oppor-
tunities of drill, it is impossible that they can be relied upon as Rifle-
men. Volunteers they may be, but they cannot be effectives; and if
the army were recruited from their ranks, our forces might be called
more fittingly our weaknesses. With their eyesight dulled and dimmed
by long confinement in close shops, "judging distances" can be by
no means easy work to them; and blunted as their faculties must be by
overwork, they cannot without practice be trained to act as sharp-
shooters.
It rests with you then, ladies, to assist the Volunteer, and the Early
Closing movements by desisting from your shopping after two o'clock
on Saturdays, and after five, as far as feasible, on other evenings of the
week. Let every mother of a family who has a wish to see her family
defended from invasion, not only rigidly abstain .from shopping late
herself, but take care to teach her daughters, as they grow, to do as
she does. "Shop Sarin" should be one of the first texts in a girl's copy-
book, and no paim should be spared in impregnating her mind with it.
Every "bargain" which is bought after two o'clock on Saturdays
deprives a Rifleman, or would-be one, of practice at his drill, and
diminishes thereby the defences of the country.
On the score too of humanity, late shopping should be stopped, and
the Cruelty Prevention Society should see to it. To imprison fine
young men upon fine summer afternoons cannot be regarded as other-
wise than torture to them, and no one but a fiomba in Crinoline would
perpetrate it. The fair sex will deserve to be considered the unfair
sex, if they do not let our shopmen have the liberty they ought to
have. Indeed the woman who would lay her hands upon a shopman,
and forcibly detain him from proceeding to his drill, must in very truth
be regarded as a Creature, whom it were gross flattery to call a Selfish
Wretch.
THE SPIRITUAL "HUME"-BUG.
Giles Scroggins's Journal, or the Spiritual Magazine, keeps
harping on the assertion, that Mr. Punch has been assured by several
gentlemen with whom he is concerned or connected, of their belief in
the reality of some alleged spiritual manifestations, witnessed by them
in the presence of certain mediums. This assertion is altogether
untrue. On the contrary, the gentlemen impertinently named by our
indelicate and credulous, if not fallacious, contemporary unite in
assuring Mr. Punch of their conviction, that the phenomena exhibited
to them as spiritual were all humbug. Mr. Punch is sorry to inform
the Spiritual Magazine, that one of the mediums whose turners his
friends have attended has been described to Mr. Punch, by a compe-
tent judge of deportment, as "a low American." Of two mediums of
the other sex, the old party who asks for "sperrits," and her con-
federate the young female, an excellent physiognomist, who tested their
pretensions, speaks with the utmost contempt and scorn. This gen-
tleman reports, that their performances are transparent fudge, and that
they themselves are a couple of rank impostors. The Spiritual Maga-
zine directly accuses Mr. Punch of impugning what he knows to be the
truth. Mr. Punch must reply, "You 're another!" Regarding him-
self and his friends, the Spiritual Magazine, at any rate, asserts what
it does not know to be true. Giles Scroggins's Journal, however,
may, to be sure, believe whatsoever it imagines. It may believe that
Mr. Punch believes in the spiritual manifestations which he gainsays.
It may believe that it believes in them itself when it really only wishes
to believe them, and is vexed by the incredulity at which its own faith
stumbles. It may be weak without being mendacious; but, wilfully or
foolishly, it belies Mr. Punch. Certainly Spiritualists may claim credit
for the innocence of imbecility. They do not seem to know what
scientific demonstration is. If they knew, they would not expect their
miracles to be believed by any but the most ignorant of the vulgar,
bigh and low, until performed before competent observers, and sub-
jected, in the presence of those judges, to the test of crucial experi-
ment. When next Mr. Punch's contributors happen to be all assem-
bled together, will any spirit, or "sperrit," at the request of any
medium, or off its own hook, come and rebuke our incredulity by
pulling all our noses P

FORWARD CHITS.
"Amo.no the Bills to come before the House of Lords the other day,
I notice an Infants' Marriage Act Amendment Bill. Well, I'm sure,
what next! What can the poor little things want to marry for, except
wedding-cake, which would be far too rich for them, and make them
ill? They had much better be kept to their tops and bottoms. The
women of Andover and the neighbourhood, I am happy to see, have
petitioned against any alteration in the law of marriage, Very much
to their ere dlt. Of course the alteration they object to is that which
is to allow infants to marry. People ought to be ashamed of them-
selves for putting such things into children's heads. Talk of old
women, indeed! Parliament would never dream of letting infants
marry one another, if all the Members were of the age and sex of
"Your humble Servant,
"Martha Grundy."
A Bap at the Rappers.
We hear that several of the Spirit-rappers have written to Mr.
Gladstone, complaining of the damage he is doing to their trade by
his recent imposition of a higher tax on spirits. The tax is now so
heavy that the rappers say the spirits are most terribly depressed by it,
so much so, that the efforts which are made to raise them are daily
more and more becoming unsuccessful.

Jones (who is rather giddy and nervous). "Eh !—Ah !—BiGnT!—To be sure!—ITes!—I—1—I—I'm coming—as fast—as—Oh!
DEAR—AS POSSIBLE!"
THE IMPERIAL BILLET-DOUX AND THE ANSWER.
The EMrEROB to John Bull (care of Count Persigny).
My dear Mr. Bull,—Let me first beg to say,
That my letter is solely intended for you:
But as crowned heads must act in a round-about, way,
I transmit through Count Peksigny this billet-doux.
I've been pained to the heart at your lending your ear
To "Old Parties" who charge me with all sorts of crimes:
But my genuine feelings I hope to set clear
In this letter which really is meant for the Times.
Don't think in your eyes that I mean to throw dust,
But pray give full credit to all I aver:
There's I'almerston knows I am worthy df trust,
And to him I am kindly allowed to refer.
'Pon my honour—a thing, which you know I hold dear,—
Since I signed at Villefrauche—with my back to the wall—
I have wished but for peace and for friendship sincere
With my excellent neighbours, and you above all.
Bless you, / never meant to take Nice and Savoy,
Till to lengths so alarming Sardinia would go,
Annexation I really was driven to employ—
(After all, they 're essentially French slopes, you know).
With my soldiers and ships, you say, Europe I frighten;
Europe ought to know better, and you too, mon cher;
Cherbourg's nothing, in fact, but a sort of French Brighton:
As for soldiers—1 haven't one man I can spare.
Of invasion by Louis Philippe did you dream?
Yet Napoleon of peace as he was—just like me—
He 'd more ships under sail than I have under steam—
And of troops, when all's weighed, I have no more than he.
Iudeed to speak plain, as a plain Emp'ror suits,
I 'ye not nearly the force—land or sea—that I want;
What, with China, Algiers, Rome, Gendarmes, sick, recruits,
Of bayonets I find myself frightfully scant.
Besides, you can't blame me for wishing to make
The best of the handful of men that 1 've got:
Less flatt'ring than yours is the view 1 must take.
You see what our troops are, / see what they 're not.
Then as to the East—'Pon my honour again—
The only instruction I gave Thouvenel
Was, "Don't put the sick gentleman out of his pain—"
He's free to stay sick—so he doesn't get well.
In Syria again—where such sad things, alas, occur;—
You blame me for the mischief I Betk to repair:
Mr. Bull, I've a heart, and it burned at the massacre
Of my dfear Christian brethren, now suH'ring there-
Till I wasn't exactly myself, and my feelings
Perhaps may have hurried me rat her too far.
Did I say "twenty thousand?" But Christian appealiugs
Are things I could never resist—so they are.
'Twas humanity urged the proposed expedition:
What profit from Syria could I expect P
My troops would have gone on their peace-making mission,
If you hadn't stept in, and the enterprise checked.
*
No—I say the same thing I said eight years ago,-—
('Twas very soon after the second Decemner)—
"L'Empire e'est la paix" was my text, at Bordeaux,
And how I've lived up to that text just remember.

[you,
I have conquests to make—but mon cher, they re in France:
She's not yet nearly conquered, I'm sorry to say,
Though material interests have had every chance.
And "L'Empire," on the Bourse, has been really la page.
In Romagna and Tuscany, much to my sorrow,
I had ties which prevented my acting with you;
But for Naples and Rome—say the word, and to-morrow,
I'm your man: make your game: and I '11 back you, true blue.
Do let us, at last, act like brother to brother:
And each pin his faith on what either may swear:
Not like rogues on the watch each to trip up the other,
And bone all the swag they, in honour, should share!
There—I've told you my thoughts, without bunkum or blarney;
From a heart I nave spoken of friendship chock full:
There are tome men can stoop to soft-sawder and carney,
But 1 'm not one of that sort—believe me, cher Bull.
John Bull's Answer.
Dear Empbror, here's my reply to your letter.
To a ream of soft words I prefer one hard fact.
And if you mean all that you say, why you'd better
Lose no time in putting your talk into act.
As to listening to what some "Old parties" have said or you,
I don't know at all what "Old parties" you mean.
My opinions I've formed, not from what I have read of;
But—I'm sorry to Bay it—from what I have seen.
As a witness to character Pam you'd have summoned:
I'm afraid, if you called him, he might make denial;
And such witnesses often, when well cross-examined,
Only make matters worse for their friend who's on trial.
And don't swear by "your honour;" the weight of a straw,
'Gainst that oath would be heavy, as facts passed away show;
And "De non apparentibus"—so says our law—
"Et non existentibus, cad' est ratio."
As for Nice and Savoy, p'rhaps 'twas nothing but proper,
To annex 'em—I whisper no word of duresse:
The encroachment was nothing, but wherefore the whopper?
Why the positive "No," which I found to mean "Yes P"
And as for your armies, and Cherbourg, and steamers;
We needn't waste time in discussing their figure:
Bat please don't set me and my lads down as dreamers,
If ours should grow big, as yours keep growing bigger.
Volunteers and Defences vou think quite disgusting,
As implying mistrust ol your word—All my eye!
I '11 trust you as far as I see you; so trusting,
You '11 excuse me for keeping my cartridges dry.
I have heard of oaths lightly sworn, lightly broken
Professions that ne'er to performances came;
Of vows cancelled almost before they were spoken,
Intentions now paving a place I '11 not name:
But in one thing at least all are safe in confiding—
And that's a man's self, to himself that is true;
One promise at least gives assurance abiding—
That's where heart says to hand, "You back me, I'll buck you.'"
And such is the trust that I sooner would lean on,
Than the oiliest words Mocquard's pen can contrive;
Try your flumm'ry on others; but, please offer me none,
On diet more solid my friendship must thrive.
I have watched both your games, Sire, at home, making slaves;
Abroad—as you said and we've seen—making free:
While you corened the fools and bought over the knaves—
Under which of these heads do you classify me?
What has been may recur. Should a Brummagem Cesar
Try a dash at John Bull, after conqu'ring the Gauls:
I intend he shall find the achievement a teaser
What with Armstrongs, long Enfields, and stout WoodenlWalls.
AETER-DINNER ARGUMENT.
Ma. Punch presents his compliments to the Earl or Hardwicke,
and requests his Lordship's notice to the following observations, which
are reported to have fallen lately from his Lordship's lips :—
"Application had been made to him as Lord LieuteQant of Cambridgeshire, to
allow an organisation of the humbler classes of society, but he had peremptorily
refused; and he should continue to do so, because he held that that most Intelligent,
useful, respectable and important body of men had duties of another kind to perform.
If they wished to carry a musket, or enter any military volunteer force, the mQitia
regiments of the country were short of something like 50,000 men, and wore ready
to receive these most worthy candidates for military service. He also thought there
was a great difference between arming men of property and men of none. He Bald
not one single word against tho character of the working classes, on the contrary
he held it iu the highest veneration; but If a weapon were given to a man who had
no property, whether it were a civil weapon or a military one, his natural tendency
would be to acquire a property which he had not got."
These remarks are said to have been delivered after dinner, and
Mr. Punch can see no reason to disbelieve that statement. But for it,
indeed, Mr. Punch would find it difficult to credit that Lord Hard-
wicke could so far have lost his senses as to say what is reported of
him. The enemy that steals away the brains of those who put it in
their mouths must clearly have abstracted those belonging to his
Lordship before he could have uttered such unreasonable nonsense.
To say one has the "highest veneration" for a class of men whom one
believes to have a "natural tendency" to robbery, surely is to show
that one is not in one's right mind, and has for the time at least said
goodbye to one's senses. To imagine too that persons of importance
and intelligence, and who are useful and respectable members of society,
are not fit to be trusted with possession of a rifle, this clearly is an
insult which applies to all the Volunteers who have enrolled themselves,
and who hardly can lay claim to better qualities than these. It is no
excuse to say, that poor men if they please may enter the militia. The
militia is a paid service, and the Volunteer is not; and humble as they
be, there are many of the "humbler classes " who are much too proud
to enter it.
Commenting on Lord Hardwicke's after-dinner speech, the Daily
News observes:—
"We will not do the late Government or tho Tory party as a body the injustice of
supposing that Loan Hardwicke represented them iu his speech; but that a man
in his position should have ventured on such language shows the sontlmeuts which
many of them really entertain towards the working classes, whom they affect to
patronise but conspire to crush. After dinner and over their wine the ruck of tho
Tory party still think and speak, as in their provincial circles they still act, a? thuy
thought and spoke and acted half a century ago."
"In vino Veritas" is an ancient axiom, and is as true now as it was
a hundred years ago. But would it not be well if Tories like Lord
Hardwicke were to take the pledge of total abstinence from public
speaking, seeing that perhaps the weakness of their reasoning seems
somewhat to betray their imbibition of strong drink.
NO BULWARKS FOR EVER!
There is something in the subjoined argument, advanced the other
evening by Mr. Bright against the expediency of fortifying our
dock-yards. Speaking of Mr. Whitworth, the Hon. Member for
Birmingham is reported to have said:—
I "He told me lart njght, that he would undertake to throw a 70 lb. shell, filled
with molten iron, six miles. I see a gentleman opposite who seems startled at that
assertion. Ma Whitworth said ho believed he could reach seven miles, but would
guarantee six. The whole system of warfare is about to undergo a change as grc.it
probably, as that which took plaoo when gunpowder was first used, (Hear.) And
yet you have your Government in its fussy activity (a laugh), not having tho courago
to tell the people the truth upon theso matters, rushing day after day into all kinds
of expenses, not knowing in tho least thnt all they are now doing will twelvo
ind to be of
months hence be found t
f no avail, and will have to be done over again."

» j—v: .™.r.v.uiiraiion8:
And so I remain, yours, etcetera, John Bull.
Don't fortify your arsenals this year with defences which some new
shell may explode the next. This advice is not devoid of reason. But
what if the new shell should not happen to be invented, and an enemy
should bombard our ill-defended Portsmouth and Plymouth with the
shells now in vogue in the meanwhile P Suppose the new shell should
happen to be invented, would Portsmouth and Plymouth, with their
existing fortifications, be less liable to bombardment than they are
now? If we cannot effectually fortify Portsmouth and Plymouth, we
had better dismantle them. Why run up a tailor's bill, when you may
as well go naked? It may be all very well for a Member of the Society
of Friends to stick to his costume, but when the question is about
covering our military and naval magazines and repositories, we may as
well be out of the world as out of the fashion. Don't wash your hands
now, because they will be dirty again by-and-by. Don't wash them
by-and-by, because they will be as dirty as ever to-morrow morning.
If Friend Bright acts personally on this principle, his best friends
must surely refuse to shake hands with him. He ought to receive a
compulsory order of the Bath, and in case of his perseverance in the
neglect of ablution, to be indicted for a nuisance.

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.

BLOATED ARISTOCRAT. TEJiT. EDWARD THE
TIITRD.
CHAPTER XXVI.—TCTE REION OF EDWARD THE THIRD.
he long reign of this sove-
reign, on whom such showers
of eulogium have been poured
by the historians, forms a
most important era in the
history of costume, and may
therefore claim to occupy a
few leaves of our Book.
From the changes which are
noticeable not less in the
civil than the military habits,
t he effigies of this period are
more markedly discernible
than those, perhaps, of any
other, from the days of
William the Conqueror
to the knights of Good
Queen Bess. In lieu of
the long tunics and robes of
the last reigns, a closely
fitting body garment but-
toned down the front like
the jacket of our " Buttons,"
and extending as far as the
middle of the thigh, was
adopted as the usual dress of
the nobility. Being made of
soft materials it was called a
cote hardie, and its rich
'embroidery was set off and
enhanced by the splendid
belt of knighthood, which
was commonly worn over it
loosely girt across the hips.
The sleeves of this new gar-
ment were fastened with a row of buttons between the wrist and
elbow, whence depended a long slip of cloth, usually of white colour,
which was called a tippet. Cotes with short sleeves were, however,
often worn, the fore part of the arm beinp covered with an under-
garment buttoned with a row of buttons like the cote. A long mantle
was occasionally worn over this dress, fastened on the right shoulder
by four or five large buttons, so that, when suffered to hang loose, it
covered the bearer completely to the feet. In general, however, the
front part was thrown back over the left shoulder, and hung in folds
behind in the manner of a cope. _ Very frequently the mantle was
indented at the edges in the form of leaves, but the reason why it was
so history leaves us now to guess.
Mr. Strutt, who on the subject of costume is (next to Punch)
the cock of the literary walk, observes that to their frequent tourna-
ments and pageants the English chiefly owed the quick succession of
new fashions, which especially distinguished the reign of this old King.
The knights who attended came from all parts of the Continent, and
endeavoured to cut out each other in their clothes as much as to cut
into one another in the lists. In a wardrobe roll, still legible by those
who have good eyes, and have a knowledge of black letter, an order is
given for a jupon of blue tartan, "powdered," that is, embroidered
thickly, "with blue gaiters, and decorated with buckles and pendents
of silver gilt;" also for a linen doublet, "bordered round the skirts
and sleeves with long green cloth, embroidered with clouds and vine
branches of gold" (rather a queer mixture), and with the motto, "It
is as it is," which is said to have been of Kino Edward's own dic-
tating, and is a clear proof of his Majesty's great literary attainments.
Upon another garment made for Royal use this interesting distich is
commanded to be stitched—
"Hay I hay I the whytbe Bwan,
By Qodo's Boul I am the mail."
What the wearer was the man for, is left to be conjectured: indeed
the meaning of the couplet is so doubtfully perceptible, that we think,
were the word "goose" put as a substitute for man," the introduc-
tion of the "swan" would, on the score of its antithesis, perhaps be
more excusable.
Of course these continental fashions found but little favour in the eyes
of the old gentlemen, who used to talk to one another about the good
old times, Sir, when Englishmen were Englishmen, and knew better
i' fackins than to ape those foreign monkeys. The clergy too were
censurers of what they doubtless termed the "backsliding" rf their
flocks, and indeed they went so far as to beliken them to devils, for
their devilish conceite. Says Dowglas, Monk of Glastonbury, speaking
of the weathercocky ways of the beau monde .—
"The Englishmen haunted eo much unto the foly of strangers that every year

they changed them In divers shapes and disguisings of clothingge, now long, now
large, now wide, now strait, and
evtrich day clothingges new and
destitute and devest from all
honeatye (1) of old arrayo or good
usage ; and another time to short

full sleeves and tippetea of sur-
coats, and hodes, over long and

knib on every side, and all so
shattered and alsoe buttoned [a
griovous sin this [] that 1 with
truth shall sayo they seem moro
like to tormentors or devils (I) in
their clothingge, and alsoe in their
shoeing, and other arraye, than
they seemed to be like men."
These "knib "or "nagged"
garments perhaps may nave
included the jagged or ragged
quintis, of which we have
made mention in the time of
Henri the Third. But we
find no special record of it in
this reign, and we prefer
therefore to assume, that it
had been abandoned, being
deservedly considered the
quintis-sence of absurdity.
Such' indeed was the ex-
travagance of fashion at this
period, that in 1363 the House
of Commons made a formal
complaint about the matter,
and actually an Act of Parliament was passed to prohibit the excessive
usage of rich clothing, which it was apprehended would impoverish
the nation. Among the sumptuary rules which our Collective Wisdom
thought proper to propose, we learn that—
11 Furs of ermine and lettlce,# and embellishments of pearls, excepting for a
head-dross, wore forbiddon to any but the royal family and nobles who had upwards
of £1000 a year. Cloths of gold and silver, and habits embroidered with jewellery,
lined with pure miniver and other costly furs, were permitted only to knights and
ladies whose incomes exceeded 400 marks per annum. Knights whose income
exceeded 2u0 marks, and squires possessing £200 in lands or tonements, were per-
mitted to wear cloths of silver or of wool of not more than the value of six marks
the whole piece; but all persons under tho rank of knighthood, or of less property
than tho last mentioned, were confined to using cloth worth not more tnau four
marks, and wore prohibited from wearing embroldory and silks, or any kind*of
ornaments of Bllver, gold, or jewellery. Rings, buckles, ouches, girdles, and
ribands, were all forbidden decorations; and the penalty annexed to the iDfringo-
ment of this statute was the forfeiture of the dress or ornament so worn."
This Act. it would seem, was directed not so much against the ladies
as the gentlemen, although the former, we are told, "dyd far outstrip
j* men in all mannere of arraies and curious apparell." Perhaps the
House, however, was afraid to risk the chance of a female revolution,
if they ventured much to interfere with ladies' dresses. We tremble
to consider what a fearful reign of terror would infallibly result from
such a daring venture now, and what a number of our members would
be sure to get their ears boxed if they made it (say) illegal to wear
military heels, or lessened by one inch the miles of crinoline now
staggered under.
The Scots, who seldom have committed great excesses in expense,
and who too well know the worth of siller to be so silly as to waste it
in extravagance of dress, had a rhyme about this period which ran (or
halted) thus :—
"Long beirds hertiless.t
Feynted 1 hoods witless,
Qa'y cotes graceless,
Haketh Englonde thriftless."
From this and other evidence, it appears that beards were generally
worn both long and pointed, and that capuchons with long peaks or
tails were made to match. Whether these pointed cloak-hoods were
ever brought in front to protect a cherished beard from dirt, or dust,
or wet, is a point which a debating club would do well to dilate upon.
Our own idea inclines to think they sometimes were, and we recom-
mend the dodge to the notice of the swells who seem to spend their
life now in growing long cat's-whiskers, which on Derby days or driz-
zling ones, might be saved much hirsute injury by being bottled up in
beard-bags.
* Disciples of Lord Mamsberry who are heedless of orthography, maybe Informed
that the word "lettlce" when written with an "I* does not mean the pleasant
vegetable, but an unpleasant little auimal, described by Cotorave as "a beast of a
whitish groy colour.
t 8ome writers read "shirtless," but wo are not so "hertiless," or heartless, as
to copy them.
I "Peyntod" may mean either pointed or painted : it boing considered quite
the thing to paint or decorate tho hood, as well as the cote hardie, with flowers and
quaint mottoes, as we have above described. Whether the word "dunce" was ever
painted on the hood, wo are unable to determine, but the epithet of "witless"
almost makes us think it may have boon.

THE RAGGED CLERGY.
ookihg before and after, the
mind of man (the mind of
woman is nearsighted and
regards only the present)
at Midsummer, naturally
both reverts and adverts to
Christmas. Whilst we are
consuming ice, and refrige-
rating our interiors with
shandygaff or champagne
cup — supposing ourselves
to be blest with a modest
competence—we are think-
ing of roast beef, and plnm-
pudding, and hot spiced
elder-wine and ale. The
coal merchant sends round
his circular to say that bis
goods are getting as cheap
as they can be, and in the
midst of the dog-days—the
cat-and-dog-days being now
at last over—we lay in our
winter's stock. As we kick
off sheet and counterpane
in composing ourselves to
slumber, we remember what
a load of bed-clothes we
required during the frost,
and wonder if we shall want as much this time six months. Coals
and Blankets being thus brought within the scope of our considera-
tion, suggest the subscriptions which the benevolent are called upon
to disburse in order that their destitute fellow creatures may be
provided with fuel and bedding. Ideas of soup-kitchens also
present themselves, and, in connection with them, the unhappy
people who want them, that they may not starve, and who must be
supplied with firing and flannel, lest they should freeze to death.
The present warm and sunshiny portion of the year is that which
especially obtrudes on the thought of reflecting persons the fact
that large multitudes of our fellow creatures are hungry and naked, and
will therefore, also, in half-a-year's time or sooner, be wretchedly cold.
Heated as it were thus by the solar rays. Imagination beholds a vast
crowd of lean, wan, sallow, sunken-cheeked, hollow-eyed, shivering,
groaning, paralysed, convulsed, contorted, shrunken, tumid, and alto-
gether miserable men, women and children, who are not only fellow
creatures but fellow Christians most of them. Working people out of
employ, with their families, constitute the reality which thus fore-
shadows itself in a Midsummer Night's Dream. Working people—
but not all underpaid journeymen tailors, or distressed needlewomen, or
even well-paid bricklayers' labourers on strike. These same working-
people out of employ, or in employment at starvation prices, include a
very considerable number of those labourers whose work lies in what
is called the vineyard. It is a fact that many of them are working
clergymen. These fellow Christians of ours comprise a very large
number of Christian pastors—who may feed their flocks indeed with
spiritual nutriment, but themselves actually want bread. Numerous
fellow clergymen may be contemplated among these scarecrows by the
bloated or the beneficent pluralist.
The above statements will be found to be warranted by the contents
of a little blue book which has lately been written by the Rev. W. G.
Jervis, M.A., and published under the title of Startling Fact). Mr.
Jervis is Secretary to the Poor Clergy Relief Society, which advertises
for cast-off apparel wherewithal to clothe naked Priests and Deacons.
The demand for such aid may well be presumed from the fact, pro-
claimed in this work, that there are more than 5,000 Curates ministering
in the Church of England whose incomes do not average above £80
per annum, and as many as the same number of beneficed Clergymen
whose clerical incomes are under £150 a year. Poor angels I This is
something like apostolic poverty—isn't it F
The following are specimens of the entreaties and supplications of
various poor clergy for alms, as cited by the Rev. Mr. Jervis :—
"Within the last three months I have been wearing a coat in rags, and Bhoes
which, from inability to get them mended, let in water every time 1 put them on;
and for weeks together we have not been ablo to havo a dinner from"
Bunday, but have been compelled to allow ourselves but two meals a day, and those
two composed of tea without sugar and bread without butter." "I solemnly assure
you, that I have not food f- r more than to-day, and that I have not the means of
procuring it till Friday next" "They" (an Incumbent's twelve children) "cannot
attend divine service on the Sabbath-day for want of clothes and shoes."—" I ask to
be supplied gratuitously with a donation of clothing."—" Wo never can afford
animal food more than once a week."—" Frequently" (this was a clergyman whoso
wife was starved to death) "wo have not bad a nioutl fill of butcher's meat for
months together, and have felt really thankful that wo had a pntatoe."—** I have a
wife and seven childrov dependent on an income of £52 per annum, which I find
Inadequate for the maintenance of my largo family; and I am in great distress."
Bishop, have you got a copper to relieve a poor clergyman ?—a poor
clergyman, bishop, who has not tasted food all this blessed day.
That is the style of solicitation to which scholars and gentlemen are
nearly reduced by clerical poverty. We shall have ministers of the
wealthy Church of England lying about on the pavement, and illus-
trating the Gospel, which it is their vocation to preach, in coloured
chalk, and writing under the picture thug delineated "I am starving."
Or, perhaps they will perambulate Cathedral closes in tom surplices,
singing psalms, m hopes to get a sixpence tossed to them out of the
dean's window.
Statesmen object, that if the Church revenues were divided equally
amongst the clergy of all ranks, there would be only £240 a-year for
each parson; so that if there were no "blanks" in the Establishment,
there would be no " prizes." But what necessity is there for prizes r
What harm would be done if the clergy were levelled down to £240
a-year a-piece? Is it credible that one soul the less would be saved
in consequence of that pecuniary arrangement? Rich bishops and
deans are great ornaments to society, but they might be as useful as
St. Paul on £240 per annum, as far as their utility depends upon their
incomes. In the meantime, could not dignitaries, who generally leave
large fortunes behind them, afford to endow a few ragged churches, to
be served by ragged clergymen, provided by Mr. Jervis's society with
old clothesP "Startling Facts" is a book which ought to lie on every
prelate's library table.
THE BLOCKADE OF THE SESSION.
TriE Obstructives have been having a rare time of it in Parliament.
Not content with having put a stopper on Reform, they have impeded
every useful measure of the Session, and the car of legislation has
been brought quite to a stand-still through the quantity of spokes—or,
more correctly, speeches—they have put into its wheels. The Savings
Banks Bill easily they knocked upon the head; and though the Bank-
ruptcy Bill loudly was called for by the country, the Obstructives inter-
posed, and would not let it pass. Quite early in the Session they stopped
the measure for reforming the London Corporation; and now the same
fate seems to threaten the Bill proposed for strengthening our forces
in India. There is little doubt, indeed, they would have ended it long
since, had not the Premier somewhat awed them by his dreadful
threat that the House should sit till Christmas rather than not
carry it.
Chief of the Obstructives is the clever Mr. Horsman, whose powers
of obstruction are really quite remarkable. If there be any truth in
the science of phrenology, we think were Mr. Horsman's bumps to
be examined, he would be found to have a wondrous organ of obstruc-
tiveness. "Mr. Horsman's speech stops the way," may be taken as
a BUinmary of all the late debates, when anything important has been
ripe to be discussed. What bis constituents may think of him is a
point which "hath no magnitude" fas saith Euclid) in his eyes, and
which apparently he keeps out. of sight as much as possible. Certainly
were justice done to Mb, Horsman, it would be only fair to charge
him with having done more to prevent the course of legislation than
any other Honourable Member of the House: and the damage he has
caused to the interests of the country might be laid before him in the
shape of a small Bill, which should enumerate as items the Bills lost
through his means. Mr. Horsman might be credited with the speeches
he has made (some of which, in point of eloquence, have been really to his
credit), and per contra might be debited with all the valuable time which
he has taken up in talk, and the many useful measures be has thus
obstructed. The account we think should then be shown to his consti-
tuents, that they may see exactly what it is he owes to them. We
think were voters saddled with the legislative debts which their Mem-
bers owe the country, most probably when next he asked them for a
seat there would be some talk of unhorsing the Horsman.
The Diggings of Suez.
At a late meeting of the Suez Canal Company, on the production (if
its accounts 1,000,000 fr. were found to have been spent in the costs
of direction. Of this sum 500,000 fr. had gone for the journeys of
M. Lesseps. To this was added a further sum for furnishing that
gentleman's rooms at Paris; and, withal 400,000 fr. for the salaries oi
the members of the direction, namely, of M. Lesseps and one or two
associates. If M. Lesseps does not make a canal out of the Suez
excavation, he will have found it a mine.
A Spiritual Calling.
A Mr. Hume professes to have the power of calling spirits from the
vasty deep, and shallow-minded persons put belief in his profession.
As profession is not always accompanied by practice, it would be well
if they would look a little deeper in the matter, for it may possibly
turn out that they are being Hume-bugged.

60 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI [August 11, I860.

Things have come to a pretty pass indeed, when a Drawing-room Table jumps cr, and after Plating a Tune on its
Accordion; offers its hand to the Housemaid!
(Now, without ant of the gammon of putting lights out, and darkening the room, this really did happen in broad
DAYLIGHT—TOU NEEDN'T BELIEVE IT, OF COURSE, UNLESS YOU LIKE.)
A DUCK. (0' DIAMONDS) OP A BONNET!
Among other highly interesting feminine intelligence, a fashionable
contemporary, the other day, informed us that—
"Bonnets are just now less protentious in their decoration ; fewer flowers are
worn, and those somewhat negligently; there is above all, a diminution in the
amount of the gilt ornaments to which we havo frequently alluded, and they seem
likely to givo way to another mode just coming into fashion: we mean Imitations
of precious stones, which will afford a wider range for the display of tasto, and have
a somewhat less appearance of tinsel. Wo may therefore expect shortly to have U;
describe the imitations of some of the most celebrated diamonds, opals, rubies,
ljearls, Ac, which, if well executed, will throw much light around the heads of the
ladies; but will, we are afraid, add materially to tho weight and cost of their
chapeaux. We really think that Benedict & Co. ought to make a demonstration
against theso continuous efforts to assault their purses, and try to convince their
better halves that imitated precious stones will only injuro the naturally much
superior effect produced by themselves, who are the real jewels of the creation,"
"Rich and rare were the gem she wore" is a bit of an old song with
which our lady readers may probably be conversant, but which, if this
new fashion become popular, will hardly be found applicable to those
who may be followers of it. All are not gems that glitter; and as we
hate shams, we certainly shall set our face against a fashion which
cannot be regarded as otherwise than sham-full. Our love for lovely
woman is very far too true for us to countenance a custom which puts
ought of false about her, and the light of Koh-i-Noors would find small
favour in our eyes if we fancied that those brilliants were of Brumma-
gem construction. Indeed even could we manage to view the gems as
fenuine, they would not much enhance to us the value of their wearers,
[olding as we do, that beauty unadorned is adorned the most, we really
should not more admire our wife in a new bonnet, which entitled her
in verity to be called a "duck o' diamonds." Nor do we think that
she herself would feel the happier for wearing it, for probably the
weight of it would soon give her a headache.
We trust the ladies then will show the wisdom of their sex by taking
the advice which is given them in Punch, and neither wearing bonnets
trimmed with false jewels nor real ones. To carry half a stone or so of
precious stones upon one's head cannot well be other than a precious nui-
sance; and as it may prove, perhaps, a sort of capital punishment, we hope
that the fair sex will not suffer themselves to suffer it. Jewels as they
are to us, let them rest quite satisfied that we prize them for their own
sake, and not for their fine fashions, and that it is their precious selves
and not their precious stones we value. Were the dear creatures to
wear a peck of Koh-i-Noors apiece, they could not be more dear, though
they might be more expensive to us: and in the business-sounding
name therefore of "Benedict & Co. (the Co. comprising fathers,
brothers, uncles, cousins, friends, and lovers of the sex) we protest
against our women wearing such rich things as may perhaps eventually
bring us to the poor-house.
THE SYSTEM OF KINDNESo.
The liberal Government of the future, in pursuance of the policy of
constitutional benevolence, will be open to receive tenders for the
following Articles of Comfort and Luxury:—
Venison for Workhouses.
Fommade for Prisons.
Smelling Salts for the Navy.
Eau-de-Cologne for Her Majesty's Land Forces.
Crinoline for Female Refuges.
Sugar Candy for Charity Schools.
Caviare for the Million.
The Government does not pledge itself to accept the lowest tender.
A Fair Attempt.
Several jokes were made at the Dramatio Fancy Fair, and not the
worst of them was made by a small wag in our hearing, who noticing
how happy the young actresses all looked in their booths, said the
place reminded him of Boothia Felix.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
August 6. Monday. On the day when Paterfamilias is going to take
his family out of town, it may have been remarked by those who watch
domestic interiors, that there is pretty sure to be something disagree-
able before starting. F. F. himself, perhaps, loses his keys; and after
he has raged for half an hour, and accused everybody of taking them,
he remembers that he left them in the pocket of the pair of trousers
which is at the very bottom of the big corded trunk. Or Materfamilias
has collected and paid all the bills, as she thinks, when a dirty boy
comes with a peremptory message from an impertinent newsvendor,
demanding one pound eighteen and threepence on the instant; and
Paterfamilias is furious at having to take the money out of what he
had put into his purse for the journey. Or the children seize the
opportunity—their legitimate guardians being all engaged in the last
preparations—to ramp about the house like wild cats, make unusual
and preternatural noises, pull about things they ordinarily dare not
touch, and finally, just at the moment when P. F. is struggling frantic-
ally with a huge strap, and is irritable at not being quite sure that he
has read Bradshaw rightly, they become so outrageous that Louisa is
suddenly ordered into the back drawing-room, and threatened with no
end of Aunt and Church, Robert is savagely shoved into a chair and
forbidden to speak or move, and Arthur retreats to the stairs
bowling from a sound box on the ear. Then Materfamilias turns irate
at these energetic police measures (though she has herself been
scolding the children incessantly for three hours), and making a short
answer to the next speech, receives a vindictive snub, and an order to
be kind enough to recollect who is the master of the house; and so.
when the time for starting arrives, the holiday begins in pouting and
sulks.
This is just'the sort of thing that has been going on in the House of
Commons. We had nearly got to the end of the Session, and were
preparing for a jolly holiday, when discomfort and a row break out.
there is a fight, and everybody is now thoroughly discontented, ana
everybody is blowing up everybody else. Nay, Parliament is worse off
than the private family; for P. F. with all his irritation, is a kind old
fellow, and will not disappoint the household by postponing the
journey, whereas Palmerston now declares that the Members shall
not go out of town for a month, perhaps not for six weeks. Heavily
are they being punished for the weeks consumed in gabble at the
beginning of the Session.
To-night the Lords did'mere machine-work, but the Commons had
a desperate fray. Mr. Disraeli bad ordered a whip on Mr. Glad-
stone's resolution for lowering the duty on the import of foreign paper.
So Mr. Brand and his colleague exerted themselves to gather
together the Opposition men, and the danger appeared so great that
Lord Palmerston called a meeting of Liberals in Downing Street,
and preached to them upon the necessity of sustaining the Government.
As he was good enough to add, that he should regard the votes of his
supporters as evidence of confidence in the Government and its policy,
he was immediately assured in return, especially by the Members
returned by the Irish priests, that the Government would be supported,
but that there was no confidence in them. However, Pam laughed,
and in the course of the meeting took the opportunity of further
pleasing the Irishry by mentioning that he had just heard that Gari-
baldians had landed in Naples, and that he was sure everybody wished
them success. How many Papist Members were driven away by this
declaration may be doubtful, but out of 76 Irish who voted that night,
57 voted against Lord Pah.
Well, the night came, and Mr. Gladstone made along and spirited
speech, and moved his resolution. His special point was, that we were
hound by the French Treaty to reduce the duty. Christopher
Puller, a Liberal ex-Chancery lawyer, opposed him, and pleaded for
the paper-makers, who expect to be hit hard, the manufacture duty
being kept on, and the impott duty being reduced so as to let in
foreign paper. Mr. Childers believed, on the contrary, that the
paper-makers would be gainers by the opening up wider fields of
operation. Mr. Crosslet, carpet-maker, crossly described Protection
as the robbing somebody else, and was glad that the makers were to
be unprotected. Mr. Maguirb, journalist, opposed the resolution,
and advised the House to wait, and do no more to please France until
we had a stronger and more determined Government, who would do
something to benefit England. Sir Hugh Cairns, lawyer, then
delivered the crack speech against Government, but Mr. Punch seldom
listens to these lawyers, and went into the smoking-room to chaff Mr,
Bright. Somebody came in and said that the Attorney-General
bad walked into Cairns, told him he evinced far too much assurance,
and also knew nothing of the subject. When Mr. Punch went back
to his place, Mr. Norris, paper-maker, was complaining on behalf of
his craft, and Mr. Henley, grumbler, followed with a big brief
grumble at Gladstone. Lord John Russell took a larger view of
the case, told the paper-makers that if they were like other English-
men they ought to be able to help themselves without protection, and
urged that on the grounds of treaty, wisdom, and policy, the resolution

: ■
was right, to which several allegations Mb. Disraeli demurred, and
argued that the treaty did not bind us to the reduction, and that we
ought not to be precipitate in a measure that would injure important
interests. Lord Palmerston cleverly said, that he was not surprised
that the lawyers could not understand the treaty, but that he was
surprised that honest and straightforward men, "who looked at
matters in a common sense light," could doubt about its meaning.
He said that the French Government had acted in a liberal and hand-
some manner, and had offered us time to make the reduction, but that
he thought that we ought at once to fulfil our engagements. We were
too far advanced in the paths of free-trade to retrace our steps.
Then did the Committee divide, and the Government had 266 votes,
and the Opposition 233, total 499, majority for Ministers 33. Puller
wanted to fight on a second resolution, but was ordered by Mr. Dis-
raeli to accept the situation, and so ended the great Battle of Papyrus.
Mr. Punch must not omit to mention, that Mr. Alderman Sidney
has been elected for Stafford. Mr. Punch congratulates the respeoted
Tea-party, and opes eel not find the orrible ours of the ouse ostile to

Tuesday. Lords at machine-work.. Commons passed the Indian
Army Fusion BUI. The Ministers have invented a capital way of
evading the questions which Members want to ask. They stay away
until it is past the hour at which questions may be put, and then come
in with a dear-me-have-I-been-wanted-you-don't-say-so smirk on their
faces, and smile blandly at the sold inquirer. We don't believe, how-
ever, that this sort of thing is prescribed in Magna Charta. Sir Fitz-
eoy Kelly, the signer of ridiculous addresses to Gough, the tee-
totalling spouter, whom the Morning Star brackets with Byron and
Haydon, but gives Gough superior praise^-you don't believe itf
Here is the passage from a leader of the 10th instant:—
11 Such change of treatment baa often before driven strong men to despair. It
drove Byron to debauchery, and Haydon to self-destruction; but, through the
power of living faith. Gouoh has risen on the wave intended to overwhelm him,
brighter in spirit and stronger in his intellectual manhood."
Now then. No, come, while we are about it, here is another—
"Those who most appreciate the graphic power of Dante and the musio of
Shelly (tic) increasingly admire the growing power of Ma. Gouoh."
Are you satisfied P—Well, Sir Fitzroy Kelly, who signs ridiculous
addresses to this compeer of Byron, Haydon, Dante, and Shelley,
consistently made a fight for the maltsters to-night, but was defeated
by 89 to 49. Seven valuable criminal Bills, which had passed the
Lords, were withdrawn by the Solicitor-General, on account of the
lateness of the Session. So much for cackle.
Wednesday. A Church Bill coming on in Committee in the Commons,
of course there was some good fun. It was the Bill for enabling the
Bishop and other authorities to deal with the City Churches which
■ have no congregations. There is to be power to remove these. But
Mr. Cavendish Bentinck (not the other one) insisted upon making
four of the most beautiful City Churches quite safe, by scheduling
! them as tabooed. He was a good deal attacked, but he was quite
right. "Who would pull down such Churches P" was asked. It
I might have been answered, "Why, miserable Vandals like those who
were going to pull down the Ladye Chapel, a very few years ago, if
| Loudo'n had not sent up a menacing yell of indignation." Moreover,
none of the Church spires and towers ought to be touched—they are
the ornaments of the City. Mr. Punch would like to see anybody lay
a hand on his neighbour, St. Bride. In half a minute from his getting
j down his rifle, the respeoted Sexton of the parish would have a job.
Mr. Punch applauds Mr. Bentinck, and does not applaud Mr. B.
Osborne for pirating a Latin joke out of Hood's Whims and Oddities,
and for making another joke of his own out of one of the most
touching parables in the Christian's portion of The Book. Nor is he
greatly delighted with Mr. Hubbard, for arguing that if a Church
ceased to belong to the Church, it mattered not whether it were made
a Dissenting chapel or a gin-shop.
Thursday. The Lords managed to get up a little steam over the Dean
of York question. This affair looked like a job,—a large increase of
salary suddenly given to a rich man,—but it is explained by the Bishop
of London to be the right arrangement, and intended to prevent the
appointment from becoming an appanage of aristocratic families. If
Bishop Tait says the thing is right, Bishop Punch will not ask
another question.
Captain Fowke, Royal Engineer, and of the South Kensington
Museum, has devised a very clever and economical plan for improving
the National Gallery. There are three reasons in that sentence why,
of course, the authorities set themselves against it. Two are in the
adjectives; the third is in the fact that the Captain is a practical
soldier, and not a petted architect, who would make a bad joo of the
affair, and spend twice the amount of the contract. If Captain
Fowke's plan receives fair play, its adoption will be called for by the
public. To-night, Mb. Cowper expressed his dissatisfaction with it.
The New Kensington Hide question came up, and was discussed with
much fire. Lord John Manners and Mr. Malik8 abused the ride;
Mr. Cowper defended it, and actually scoffed at The Vestries—and,
we believe, still lives. A fight was taken, and 71 supported the Hide
to 48 against it.
Lord John Russell explained to the House that Spain wanted to
be considered one of the Great Powers. She is bo proud of having
paid one of her debts, and of having been only baffled, not beaten, in
Africa, that she is ready to burst with glory. Lord John Russell
intimated that he had no notion of yielding to such folly, and that at
all events he should keep Spain in her place until next Session. Well
said, author of "Don Carlos." Mr. Edwin Jakes then opposed the
Fortifications Bill, and after a debate, and a smart speech from Pah, I
who laughed at everybody for declaring his own profession to bo the 1
one that was to save the country, the Bill was carried, on Second
reading, by 143 to 32, majority 111. Something about the Galway
Packet contract naturally sent Mr. Punch to sleep, but he was waked
by hearing Mr, Roebuck, evidently in a dreadful rage, declaring that
he laughed everybody to scorn.
Friday in the Lords was noteworthy, because Lord Clyde came
out in the character of a Maiden Speaker. The heroic maiden was not!
so fluent as Joan op Arc, but spoke much to the purpose, and heartily
approved the Indian Army Fusion Bill. Lord Ellenborough
opposed it, and incidentally rebuked the Anglo-Indian press for the
mischievous ribaldry it is always launching at the natives and their
religion and customs. Lord Derby had fears about the proposed
change, but as the Duke op Cambridge and a large majority in the
Commons approved it, he should not oppose it. So the Bill was read
a Second time. Speaking ou the elongation of the Session, Lord I
Redesdale strongly objected to being kept in town, and said that the;
Queen had set everybody a good example by taking her holiday, and
going off to Scotland. There was some sense in this speech.
In the Commons there was a very miscellaneous discussion. The
metropolitan Members abused Cowper for sneering at the Westries;!
Mr. Coningham abused Sir Charles Eastlake for being done, as |
was alleged, in a recent picture purchase; Mr. Bright abused every-
body on the Paper Question, and was himself blown up by Lord i
Palmekston for reviving old grievances and making puling lamenta- i
tions: the Irish Members abused the Government for letting coercion |
Bills be passed for Ireland, and Mr. Numb-Skully declared they were
more needed in England; and everybody abused Mr. Punch's patience,
and sent him out of the House in a rage, muttering; Quousgue tandem,
Dog-and-Cat-alina, abutere, Sfc,
ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE PRINCE OF WALES.
Our young friend the Prince op Wales is likely to see some
strange things, both in the country he enters as Viceroy and in that he
approaches as Visitor. We hope that H.R.H. will keep a diary, as it
promises to be a collection of cariosities. For instance, here is a little
anecdote which Mr. Punch extracts from an American paper:—j
"A Clerovuak* Fiohtino.—On Sunday last, the monotony of church-going was
unpleasantly disturbed by a street-fight between a WesleyAn Methodist preacher
named Bolton, and a pious man named Williams. The brethren had a fine fight
of it for a while, and would probably have ended with a visit to the hospital, had
not Mr. Williams thrown up the sponge at tbo request of the police, just as the
Rsvkrend Mr. Bolton was putting in some of his most scientific fibbers. This
desperate affair took placo in Toronto, Canada, and was witnessed by a large crowd
oi delighted citizens."
But this was a mere display cf odium theologicum, and its termi-
nation was milksoppy in the extreme, a complaint which cannot be
made in reference to the following little scene, also described in an
American journal:—
"Indictmbnt of A Critio for KrLLiNO an AoTOR.—We notice by late exchanges i
that Mr. Qeoroe W. Overall, the theatrical critio of tho New Orleans DtUa (we
believe) has been indicted by the Grand Jury of that city for manslaughter, he
having shot an actor named Harry Copkland. If we remember the particulars of
the encounter rightly, Copkland assailed Mr. Ovkrall in the street, in consequence
of some close criticism of his acting by the latter, wheu the critic ahot him in self-
defence. We are no advocates ot the pistol business so common in the South ; but
it seems to us that the assailant, in this case, only «ot his just deserts. When a
Journalist cannot express an honest opinion without incurring t ho rowdy Ish attacks
of the criticised, it is high timo that some oue should be taught a severe and useful
lesson."
The Republicans far surpass the Colonists in thoroughly doing what
they set about. If any national and characteristic scenes of these
kinds should be got up for the instruction and delight of the Prince,
Mr. Punch will feel that a delicate compliment has been paid to the
Royal Family of England.
Natural and Supernatural.
A "Thirsty Soul" of our acquaintance avows his entire belief in
Mr. Home's being lifted into the air by spiritual influences, as
described in the Cornhill Magazine for this mouth. He declares he
has more than once been elevated by spirits himself.

A PROTESTANT PANIC.
There is a Mr. Turnbull, a Roman Catholic, who has been ap-
pointed to the office of Calenderer of Foreign Papers in the State Paper
Office. This does not at first glance, seem to be a fact worth recording,
except in the Red Book, or some such esteemed work of reference.
But we must not judge by first glances. As the children say, "looky
ear: "—
"A deputation has had an interviow with Viscount Palmerston, to present a
memorial respecting the appointment. The deputation consisted of the Earl or
Shaftmbdrt, Lord Calthorpe, the Hon. A. Kinnaird. M.F., Sir W. Verner,
Bart., M,P., Ac. &c. The memorial presented by LORD Shaftksburt was signed
by 2,500 persons, of whom 10 were Peers, 18 Members of Parliament, 10 Baronets,
85 Magistrates, 518 Clergymen, 663 Dissenting Ministers, besides several generals,
admirals, and other officers in the army and navy, heads of colleges, literary and
other gentlemen. Mr. Kinkaird at the samo time presented a similar memorial
from bcotland, signed by 3,500 persons. The memorials were vory graciously
received by the Premier, who promised that the subject should receive the attention
it deserved. It appeared that Mr. Turnbull is distrusted even by the friends who
appointed him, two competent persons (Protestants) being ordered to 'revise' all
his abstracts."
This is the most astounding phenomenon Mr. Punch has witnessed
since Donati's comet. Six thousand persons in a state of agitation
about one poor man, who, under other circumstances, Mr. Punch would
have supposed to be a superior clerk, whose business it is to make a
pricU of a document, endorse it, and put it in a pigeon-hole, making a
proper entry in an index-book, so that it might be easily found again.
But the whole Evangelical world is up in arms against the party.
What is the crime which he is suspected of meditating, or can possibly
commit P Into the State Paper Office rush the Six Thousand, but who
is the enemy P Are they afraid that Mr. Turnbull will translate the
old documents wrongly, and forge evidence that this country really
belongs to the Kino op Naples or the Emperor op Austria? Or is
he suspected of intending to introduce passages into the love-letters of
Philip to Sanguinary Mart, which will show that England broke
faith with Spain in remaining Protestant P Or will Turnbull tum
Bulls from Rome into engines damaging to our national character.
If so, it is quite right to set two Protestant sentinels over him; but
why the Six Thousand to watch the sentinels P This is altogether a
most inexplicable case of Protestant Terror, and Mr. Punch would
much like to have it cleared up, Shaptesburt had better call at 85
some morning before 6.
Putting Louis Napoleon's Pipe Out.
The French Emperor complains bitterly of the English Govern-
ment's interpolation of a bar in his favourite air, Partant pour la Syrie.
He declares it quite spoils his latest arrangement of that favourite
melody, which he had intended to be in five flats. It seems the Five
Powers did not exactly like the Imperial time, or tune either.
PROPOSED CREATION IN THE SMARTEST NATION.
Who will bet Mr. Punch a red cent that in ten years time our
American cousins do not cTeate an American Peerage? The Upper Ten
are evidently awakening to a sense of the distinctions between people.
The Neic York Herald, the leading journal of the States, is perfectly
disgusted with the snobbishness of the Aldermen of that City. Now
that the Prince op Wales is to be the guest of the President, Queen
Victoria's "good friend" is affectionately urged to take care that the
young stranger is not approached by the "vulgar rowdies" who
belong to the Corporation. It is particularly desired that he should
not take to the old world such an impression of republicanism as he is
likely to derive from seeing and hearing these vulgar personages. The
Mayor of New York, whom Lord John Russell, blundering, called
Your Excellency, is not an unworthy person, it seems.
"That he will discharge in a fitting and dignified manner his duties as host, and
that he will convey to his guest an agreeable impression of the cultivation and
refinement of the community of which he is the head, we are fully persuaded.
Whatever Mayor Wood's failings may be, no one will accuse him of being wanting
in the manners and bearing of a gontleman, and there is not, perhaps, a man in this
city better qualified to play the part expected of him on this occasion."
But as for the Aldermen and such like, they are to keep off, and not
disgrace the Republic. If a banquet is to be got up, it
"Should be entrusted to the management of a committee of gentlemen in whom
the public have confidence; otherwise it might degenerate into another such sceno
of rowdyism and vulgarity as the Japanese ball presented."
As Mr. Punch knows everything, it is his duty to' add, in justice to
the Editor of the New York paper, that his opinion of the present
municipal authorities of the territory formerly the property and still
bearing the name of the Duke op York, is amply borne out by facts,
especially facts which are occasionally elicited before the Police Magis-
trates of that locality; and on the part of the English nation, Mr. Punch
begs to express his sense of the courtesy intended by the advocacy of
the exclusion of the "rowdies" from the hospitalities that await the
young Prince. On the whole, however, Mr. Punch strongly recom-
mends the construction of a Peerage to the consideration of his
American friends. When Mr. Punch himself next visits the States,
he trusts to be welcomed by the Earl of Lincoln and the Marquis
op Bennett, and is ready to bet his own Lincoln and Bennett
(quite right. Wiscount, to explain that he means a At) that Mr.
Douglas will look uncommonly well in a coronet, of which his Scottish
namesake, the Marquis op Queensburt will be very happy to send
him a pattern. The Duke op Breckenridge is a title that would
sound nobly, and as that nobleman is, according to Garrett Davis :—
"A gentleman of good Intents, fine manner*, easy and graceful elocution, while
his habits are indolent, and his manners and thoughts superficial,"
the Duke must be the exact counterpart of the major;!
titled Swells. Let America think of it, and open a
connection with the Office of the Herald.

A FACT.
Jeames. "Ir xou please, Ma'am, heke is Master Carlo! but 1 can't see Miss Floss nowheres!"
Ik Europe two sick men do dwell,
Of whom there 'a little hope;
The Sultan one: as far from well
The other is the Porn.
This wreck a triple crown, and that
A Royal turban wears:
Too weak the head in either hat
To manage its affairs.
The first has been a sufferer sad
For many a weary day;
And loads of physic he has had
To keep grim Death at bay.
The second 'gan to limp and reel
Some dozen years ago,
THE TWO SICK MEN.
When his French doctor threw in steel;
Maintained his system so.
Erupt ions, here and there, about
Each leper's surface rage;
And either is well nigh worn out
By frequent hemorrhage.
Yet their physician Btill declares
That both must more be bled,
And take more steel, by which he
swears,
Exhibited with lead.
The Pope cries, "Heathen friend, I see
You've got my doctor too;
He hasn't done much good to me,
May he do more to you!"
"My Giaour," the groaning Turk replies,
"We 're past physician's skill;
To cure us if your doctor tries
He '11 all the sooner kill."
Gone are both systems to decay.
Effete old Pope and Turk!
No Constitution left have they
Whereon the Leech might work.
Could they but break up quietly,
And leave the world in peace,
Blest would the dissolution be,
And happy the release.
MISS MERMAID.
Miss Martineau wrote admirably (which indeed is tautology) upon
the duty of teaching young ladies to swim. According to an adver-
tisement which has caught Mr. Punch's eye, a very young lady follows
in Miss Martineau's wake, and is setting the example. A little Miss
Beckwith, aged six years, has, it seems, attained great skill in
swimming, and disports herself, in the prettiest of costume, in the
great Lambeth bath. A little Duck. Except that the pedigree would
not be complimentary, Mr. Punch would suppose t he fair little baigneuse
to be a descendant of Macheath'i friend, Jenny Diver.
"Who taught tho little Nautilus to swim?"
is an improved quotation which occurs to Mr. Punch's well-regulated
memory, but only to be immediately rejected: because, in the first
Elace, she is not a naughty lass, but a very good lass, and in the second,
ecause the question is superfluous, as she is stated to have been taught
by her papa, a distinguished swimmer, to whom Mr. Punch tenders his
congratulations on having a child who will always be able to keep her
head above water.
CHEERING IF TRUE.
In these days of alarming and unpleasant rumours, the report men-
tioned in the following extract from the French correspondence of the
Times will be hailed, as a lively variation of the melancholy air which
has so long been resounding on the trumpet of common Fame:—
*' Afl a prelude. It is said, to the total abolition of passports for foreigners travel-
ling in France, tho Ehpekor has ordered that foreigners coming- to Paris to witness
the festivities on the 15th of August, the Emperor's Jitty shall not bo required to
show passports."
This tune goes nicely. Is it not too cheerful to be true? Is
Pandora's box not yet quite empty? Are peaceable people still in a
condition to entertain some little hope P Can we venture to give ear
to any announcement of aught but impending calamity—war, plagup,
pestilence, famine, deficit and increased taxation P The Emperor op
the French has written us a very promising letter. The abolition of
passports would indeed be a great step in the direction of performance.
Something like confidence would be created in Europe oy the spec-
tacle of such an Imperial stride accomplished in the Seven League
Napoleon Boots.

PUNCH, Oil THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GO AT THE GABBLERS.
H! What is to be
done with our talka-
tive M.P.sP This is
a question which is
yearly getting more
and more momentous.
Every session is more
taken up and wasted
by them than the last,
and the more they sit
and talk, the less the
country is advantaged
by it. Here we are in
August, and their
tongues are just'as
voluble as they were
in April; and nobody
except the grouse is
any whit the oetteroff
for the clatter they
keep up. As for any
cosiness being got
through in their pre-
sence, one might as
well expect to get an
epic poem written
within hearing of an
organ-grinder. Their
gabble is enough to
distract the strongest
mind, and divert from
what engages it the steadiest attention. Who can hope to see a Bill safe through the
House, when a hundred tongues are waiting ready primed to (ire away upon it? The
batteries, it is true, are mostly loaded with blank cartridge, but then they kick up such a
ceaseless row, that no one possibly can work in it.
Talk talk, talk,
Till the brain grows dizzy and dim:
And talk, talk, talk,
Till the cheerfulest face looks grim.
And it's oh! what a din they make.
In spite of the cries of " spoke!
And in spite of the fact that each bottled-up Act,
Will be turned to a bottle of smoke.
Now, what is to be done to bring these garrulous M.P.s beneath the wholesome influence
of the £ary Closing Movement, or, in language less circuitous, to make them "shut up"
sooner than they have done of late? Everybody grumbles at the way in which the country's
time is taken up, and nobody appears to know of any remedy to name for it. State physicians,
if appealed to, blandly shrug their shoulders, and say they fear the case is past all curing.
Hear, for instance, how the Times talks on the matter, and hints that a reform pill must in
i shape be prescribed for it:—

"No greater service could bo rendered to the efficient transaction of public affairs, and the maintenance of
the high character of public men, than a scheme by which the House should be enabled to protect IUelf
against ita unruly members, and to find time for all its business by economising that which it devotes to the
leastimportant part. * • * • The man who shall invent any means by which Parliament can dis-
charge efficiently the duties that it has undertaken, will be tbo author of a real Reform Bill, that will give a
stability to our institutions which at this moment they do not possess, and avert the most formidable danger
which can overtake an ancient constitution—that of being found unequal to cope with the circumstances of a
society into the midst of which it has descended."
Thus appealed to, Mr. Punch, whose talents are devoted to the service of his country,
has felt in duty bound to keep his brains upon the rack, until he could devise a scheme for
silencing the gabblers, and removing the obstructives to the business of the nation. With
this view he has nightly dosed himself with tea, and has supped off toasted cheese to keep
himself awake, and unnaturally stimulate his powers of invention. The result is, he at length
has hit upon a plan by which the workers in the House will be secured due peace and quiet,
without shortening by one syllable the prating* of the talkers. Mr. Punch suggests, that
henceforth the House should be divided, and that the talkers and the workers should be kept
distinct and separate. As no Member is influenced by what he hears in Parliament, there
can be but very small advantage in his bearing it. Totes, it is well known, are always cut
and dried beforehand, and not one in a million is biassed by the speeches. Gabblers get upon
their legs that they may use their tongues, merely, and never dream of getting workers to
waste their time in hearing them. It is clear then, that for all the good they do in the House,
the talkers might, in fact, be every whit as well kept out of it.
But Mr. Punch, who ever tempers justice with mercy, will not be so cruel as to hint that
this is requisite. A Bill for the Removal of these National Nuisances would no doubt
be vastly popular, and has much to recommend it. Nevertheless, Mr. Punch will not at
present call for it, but will content himself with simply severing the House, and separating
its productive from its unproductive Members. The former might still occupy the chamber
they now sit in, being secured from any chance of interruption oy the latter: to whom should
be allotted a chamber by themselves, where they might gabble as they pleased without
annoying anybody. Reporters might attend when they were specially engaged: and the
luxury of seeing one's pet speeches put in print might thus be graciously provided for all
who chose to pay for it.
By separating thus the really busy bees of Parliament from the idly buzzing drones by
whom the business is impeded, the great hive
of St. Stephens will be cleaned out quite suffi-
ciently, and room be found to lay up goodly
stores of useful Acts. When the drones can't
interrupt them, the working bees, no doubt, will
stick to work like wax; and will no more have
their time wasted by swarms of gabbling
?;ood-for-nothings, whose only point of dif-
erence from the family of drones is, that now
and then one finds that they are gifted with a
sting.
FAST YOUNG LADIES.
Hebe's a stunning set of us,
Fast young ladies;
Here's a flashy set of us,
Fast young ladies;
Nowise shy or timorous,
Up to all that men discuss,
Never mind how scandalous,
Fast young ladies.
Wide-awakea cur heads adorn,
Fast young ladies;
Feathers in our hats are worn,
Fast young ladies;
Skirts hitched up on spreading frame,
Petticoats as bright as flame,
Dandy high-heeled boots, proclaim
Fast young ladies.
Hiding habits are the go.
Fast young ladies,
When we prance in Rotten Row,
Fast young ladies;
Where we're never at a loss
On the theme of "that 'ere 'oss,"
Which, as yet, we do not cross,
Fast young ladies.
There we scan, as bold as brass,
Fast young ladies,
Other parties as they pass,
Fast young ladies;
Parties whom our parents slow,
Tell us we ought not to know;
Shouldn't we, indeed? Why so,
Fast young ladies?
On the Turf we show our face,
Fast young ladies;
Know the odds of every race,
Fast young ladies;
Talk, as sharp as any knife,
Betting slang—we read Bell's Life:
That's the ticket for a wife,
Fast young ladies!
We are not to be hooked in,
Fast young ladies;
I require a chap with tin,
Fast young ladies.
Love is humbug: cash the chief
Article in my belief:
All poor matches come to grief,
Fast young.ladies.
Not to marry is my plan,
Fast young ladies,
Any but a wealthy man,
Fast young ladies.
Bother that romance and stuff!
She who likes it is a muff;
We are better up to snuff,
Fast young ladies.
Give me but my quiet weed,
Fast young ladies,
Bitter ale and ample feed,
Fast young ladies;
Pay my bills, porte-monnaie store,
Wardrobe stock—I ask no more.
Sentiment we vote a bore,

FROM TUE INITIAL LETTER TO THE GRANT OF TUB DUCHT
OF AQl ITAINK.
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXVII.—THREE WORDS MORE ABOUT THE REIGN
OF KINO EDWARD THE THIRD.
owing now to the
military costume
of this period, we
would direct espe-
cial notice to the
beautiful initial
letter which our
artist has selected
to illuminate this
chapter, as throw-
ing a clear light
upon the armour
ot the time. The
letter we should
note is quite cor-
rectly copied from
one that any anti-
quary at a glance
will recognise: but
as some few of our
readers may not be
so well acquainted
with it, we may
append a word or
two by way of ex-
planation. Look-
ing to the left,
then, you will per-
ceive his Gracious
Majesty King Ed-
ward the Third a-sitting in his easy chair (please observe the cushion
on it) and a-holding in his left hand eit her a sceptre or a sword or else a
kitchen poker, it is really rather puzzling to decide precisely which.
With his dexter hand the monarch is handing what might possibly be
thought to be a newspaper, but which really is the grant of the Duchy
of Aquitaine. The figure to the right is Edward the Black Prince,
who is a-kneeling on his helmet to
receive the Royal gift. Some conjec-
ture that the reason why he chooses
that position is simply that his leg
armour was made a little tight, and if
he had knelt upon the ground he could
not have got up again. The spectator
will remark the pourpoint over the
thigh-pieces, a prevalent way of wearing
it in this and the next reign. It like-
wise should be noticed, that the Prince
is not so Black as history has painted
him, but for which there seems to have
been no colourable excuse. As shown
in this initial, his complexion is as
white as a Serenading Ethiop's who
has had his face washed.*
Plate armour came much more into
use during this reign, the body indeed
being almost wholly covered by it. The
chief cause of its adoption was, that it
was very much lighter than chain-mail,
which, with its appendages, was found
so hot and heavy that the knights were
sometimes suffocated, or sank beneath
its weight. A light steel back- and
breast-plate proved fully as protective
as the hauberk and the plastron, and
the plate was not so liable to be pushed
into a wound as were the links of the
chain-mail when broken by a lance-
poke. This improvement in our armour
was, it seems, of foreign origin. By the
Florentine annals the year 1315 is given
as the date of a new Horse-guards regu-
lation, whereby every mounted soldier
was ordered to have his helmet and his
breastplate, his cuisses, jambes, and gauntlets, all of iron plate: and as
the Italians were famous for the way in which they kept their irons
• That the Prince wu called "the Black" from tho colour of hia armour ia a
notion which Sir Samoel Meyrick has exploded: and it appears that the nickname
was in truth a nom de guerre, being derived from tho black lookn with which he
faced the foes whom he had put in his black books.

FROM THE EFFIOT OF WILLIAM OF
DATE 1300.
in the fire, we found it worth our while to steal a leaf out of their
books.
There may be doubts if many readers will remember such queer
names, but mention should be made that brassarts and demibrassarts,
and vant-braces or vambraces were separate bits of armour worn upon
the arms; cuissarts or cuisses were used to shield the thigh, and boots
of steel called greaves or jambes were worn upon the leg between the
ancle and the knee. We have no doubt that the jambes were found to
act well as preserves, but we think at times the shin must have been
sadly jammed in them. A similar objection too, we think, must have
applied to the manner of affording protection to the feet; for we learn
that they were cased in what were known as "sollerets" of overlap-
ping plates, which people who had corns found most corn-foundedly
unpleasant. Similar plates were worn upon the backs of the leathern
gauntlets, which upwards from the
wrists were mostly made of steel.
Knobs or spikes, called gadlings,
being fastened on the knuckles, the
gauntlets were occasionally used as
knuckle-dusters, if "jacket-dusters"
would not be a more appropriate
term. Thus in a trial by combat
between one John de Visconti and
Sir Thomas de la Marchb, fought
at Westminster before King Edward
in close lists, Sir Thomas gained
the day by dashing in his gadlings on
the mug of his antagonist, who went to grass minus three ivories, and
with his dexter peeper closed.*
Over the body-armour a garment called a jupon was much worn
during this period, being lighter and less cumbrous than the cyclas
or the surcoat, which had been in use with the wearers of chain-mail.
The jupon was girt loosely with the gorgeous belt of knighthood, and
was usually emblazoned with the arms of him who wore it, or else was
embroidered with grillius or green geese, or any other tasty and
fanciful device.
People well up in their history, as (of course) arc all our readers,
need not be told that there was plenty of lighting in this reign. Else
might we remind them of how King Edward, making war with
Philip the Tall, of France, landed with his army on the coast of
Flanders, after gaining a naval battle in which the enemy lost upwards
of two hundred and thirty ships and thirty thousand men; and how,
marching thence towards Paris.t he took the towns and villages which
lay upon his route, and. as one old writer tells us, "at Caen in especiall
he diode give y" Frenchmen peppere." The names of Poictiers, too,
and Cressy must alike be fresh in the remembrance of our readers;
who will doubtless recollect that it was at the latter battle that cannon
were first used, although they by no means as yet supplanted bows and
arrows. The first cannon indeed would now be thouglit mere popguns,

and, as arms, would be considered very weak compared with Arm-
strong's. We fancy, too, that what with their recoil and the chances
of their bursting, they often did more damage to their own side
than the enemy; while their range no doubt fell short of that attained
by the long-bowmen, who, unless they drew the long bow in more
senses than one, are believed to have killed their men at above four
hundred yards with it. Our victory at Cressy was won mainly by the
bow, our marksmen showing themselves markedly superior to the
foreigners, who had the disadvantage too of shooting with wet weapons,
* We may note hero, that the gauntlets of Edward titk Black Prince were made
of bras* or la ton, and the gadlings were fashioned in the shape of lions or leopards,
the reader, if he pleaaos, may himself determine which. Ho will find the gauntlets
hanging above the Prince's tomb in Canterbury Cathedral, together with his sur-
coat, shield, and tilting helmet* all of which are visible without increase of price';
and we think the Dean and Chapter may very fairly calculate that after this
announcement there will set in quite a rush of Canterbury pilgrims to see tho
interesting relics which are there on view.

which materially damped the ardour of their fire. This we learn from
various more or less authentic sources, and among them we may cite
one of those curious old ballads which we believe that we have been
the first to put in print. Herein it is stated that—
"Uhrir coins fjatiBt btm foasfjrt, just foasftrti in n srijofocrr,
3nD ge strings font so tottttD ant) franco,
Chat nc archers, fofjo foere of our foetnm ge flofotrc,
JFuU soone fotre our prisoners mane." •
It may be noticed here, that there has been much argument expended
as to whether it was at the Battle of Creasy (which, from the ram that
fell, has been by some folks called the Battle of Water-Cressy) that the
Black Prince first adopted the sign of the Three Feathers, which
has ever since continued the Prince of Wales his crest. Camden
states in his Remains (which Cox of Finsbury believes were written in
Camden Town)—
"The victorious Black Prince used sometimes one feather, sometimes three, in
I token as some saye of his speedye execution in all his services, as -y" posts in the
I Roman times wero callod pterophori. and wore feathers to signifie their flying: post
haste. But y« truth is y he wonne them at y battle ot Creasy, from Jons, King of
Bohemia, whome he there slew©."
What authority he had for calling this "the truth," the learned
Camden carefully neglects to let us know; and as contemporary his-
torians make no mention of the matter, we cannot pin our faith on
Mr. Camden's tale. The crest of John op Bohemia, as shown upon
his seal, was the pinion of an ostrich; and whether the Prince plucked
his feathers from John's wing is a matter of a pinion which we cannot
well decide.t For his bravery at Cressy, the Prince received no end
of praise from his father, who may have said his exploits were a feather
in his cap: and the Prince may then have stuck three feathers in his
cap to show how much he plumed himself on having pleased bis
parent. A single feather, we are told, was very often worn by civil
people at this period, but whether the Prince led the mode or merely
followed it, is a question upon which our means of knowledge are but
mode-rate.
* The English, with more forethought, had taken tbe precaution not to take their
bows out of their cases until they were wanted, it being then an excellent war
maxim to "keep your bowstrings dry."
t " Strauss," the German word for " ostrich," was used in ancient times to sig-
nify a combat, although it is now obsolete in that old-fashioned sense; and this may
have been a reason for the piuion of the bird being adopted by the Kino op
Bohemia as a crest. Another reason possibly was that the ostrich, being blest with
an extraordinary digestion, was used to typify a soldier's appetite for steel, which
he was continually at the risk of having to bite. In one of tho old descriptions of
the battle of Foictiers, we find tbe Homer of tho period saying "Many a hero,
like the ostrich, had to digest both iron and steel —without feeling much the
better, we should say, for the steel mixture.
"IT BODES HIM GOOD."

man, the Bason dk Bods, Is again to be brought before Parliament, and must

With just indignation one's fit to explode,

To whom this dishonest old country has owed
For years as much tin as you'd find in a lode.
His claim is undoubted, as oft hath been showed,
And proved by each treaty, each law, and each code;
Yet the twaddling Obstructive and Barnacle toad
Resists him in every conceivable mode,
And Circumlocution has jeeringly crowed
At every fresh obstacle thrown in his road.
Such treatment might almost to lunacy goad,
But that patience and courage the Baron has stowed
In his vessel, which one day will surely be towed
Into port, with a cargo of bullion to load,
While his foes look as blue as if painted with woad.
The seeds of success have been carefully sowed,
And one of these days shall the harvest be mowed.
Meantime Mr. Punch has indited this Ode
And bids the official Obstructives be blowed,
And pay up the claims of brave Baron de Bode.

THE EDINBURGH REVIEW.
(Tuesday, August 7As.)
There's an ancient periodical, in blue and yellow bound,
That appears on old Whig tables as quarter-day comes round,
And many a good old-fashioned Whig would make a sad ado,
Were a quarter-day to pass without his Edinburgh Review!
But not in old Whig uniform of blue and yellow pied
Was clad that Edinburgh Review which now wakes Punch's pride:
And not in issue quarterly, four numbers by the year,
Came out the Edinburgh Review which Punch would welcome here.
But in sober greys and russets, and in plaids of sombre sheen,
The latest Edinburgh Review was welcomed by our Qoeen:
And more than twenty thousand were the numbers it poured forth,
Where, Lion-like, grim Arthur's Seat looks down upon the Forth.
From the storm-swept head of Dunnet, to Solway's level sands—
From the sea-firths of Argyleshire to where Arbroath castle stands—
From Lowland heugh, and Highland strath, from mountain, moor
and fell,
Trooped forth those sturdy thousands—the loyal throng to swell.
The clansman with his claymore, his kilt and belted plaid.
The Lowlander in hodden grey, or darkling green arrayed;
The crofter from the loch-side, the gilly from the hill,
The farmer from the furrow, and the weaver from the mill.
Came gentle and came simple, came wealthy and came poor,
All moved by one intent, all bound by one tie, strong and sure;
By leal love of the Lady in whose soft sway we stand,
And love more leal, it such may be, for this their native land.
There have been times when North and South stood foot to foot for
fray,
But no blood-feud has summoned the gathering of to-day;
The sons of merry England with Scotland's sons are here,
Shoulder to shoulder marching—true step and tuneful cheer.
St. Andrew's Cross from Arthur's Seat salutes with stately show
St. George's banner waving on Holyrood below;
Two hundred thousand faces on the hill-sides hide the green,
Two hundred thousand voices ring out "God save the Queen!"
And before the Royal Standard and the Royal presence, lo!
Where twenty thousand Volunteers in martial order go;
With rifles trailed, and swinging stride, and port erect and free—
If such are Britain's citizens, what should her soldiers be P
An hour has gone, and still pours on that armed and ordered tide,
And well tbe Queenly face may flush and pale with sudden pride,
For such a body-guard as this had never Queen I trow—
From the days that Malcolm wore his tore of twisted gold, till now!
And never sent a country such a band of stalwart sons
To guard their hearths and household gods, their wives and little

A Vicarious Crack.
The new Report of the Lunacy Commission states, that out of every
600 persons, one is cracked. Now the House of Commons consists of
654 persons, and therefore must contain one person, and also the
twelfth part of one, incapable of managing affairs. A Committee
ought to be moved for, in order to ascertain who these parties are. Or,
shall we accept the largest compound of the two things that make a
senator, namely, Tin and Brass,*'as the representative of the House,
and regard the crack in Big Ben as the case of Parliamentary Lunacy.
THE HOUSE OP CHATTERBOXES.
The Long Parliament made a name for itself in history, and the

A PRINCE OF A YOUNG FELLOW.
"Oh, my deab Mb. Punch, "Verbena Villa, Friday.
"I am so delighted. That dear darling Pbince op Wales!
Isn't he a duck;' Only hear now how delightfully his charming Royal
Highness is getting on in Canada. This is what the New York Herald
tells us of the Ball which was given at the Colonial House, in the
parish of St. John's,* to him :—
*' The Princo arrived at about ten o'clock, ar.d was greeted with loud, enthusi-
astic, and prolonged cheers—tho bands playing 'Ood eave the Queen.' The Prince
was dressed in the full uniform of a British colonel. Ue was accompanied by tbe
Earl or St. Gkrmans, who was dressed in blue, with a badge, and the Dukk or
Newcastle, who wore his full uniform. The Prince danced six times during the
evening, and remained with the company until half-past two o'clock this morning.
Tho dancing, on the wholo, smong tho company was not very good. The Prince
very affably and good-naturedly corrected some of tho blundering dancers, and
every now and then called out the different figures of tbe dance. He Is himself a
very graceful and accomplished dancer, as he fully proved in the way he whirled
through waltzes, polkas, and quadrilles. While ho danced he was repeatedly
cheored, and he vory properly took a new partner whonevor ho stood up to dance.
The peoplo everywhere are greatly deiightod. The unpretending and genial dispo-
sition of the young Prince has gained him tho affection of many true and worthy
hearts."
"There! isn't that delicious! Only think now of our Pbince of
Wales having to turn dancing-master! Oh, how I should have loved to
have been ' whirled through a waltz' with him! I'm sure His High-
ness wouldn't have found me a 'blundering dancer.' Poor fellow! I
dare say that he was sadly vexed to find that the Canadians were so
clumsy in a ball-room. Really, I've no patience with such ungainly
creatures. My heart bleeds to think how terribly they trod npon his
toes, and wobbled in their waltzing. Clearly something should be done
to prevent such stupid things from troubling our Princes. Ob, if I'd
been there! Wouldn't I have put their noses out of joint just! I
should so like to show them how an English girl can dance, particularly
when she gets a Prince to be her partner!
"I don't quite understand though what the paper means by saying
that whenever the Prince danced he 'very properly took a new
partner.' I confess I can't see what there is so 'very proper' in this.
* St John's is not a parish, and is not In Canada. But never mind. Miss. Loyalty
ranks higher than Geography.—I'unch.
I know myself I like to keep more to one partner, than to have to dance
about with nobody knows whom, so that one never has the chance of a
bit of a flirtation, and still less of arriving at the interesting moment
when one may hear something serious. I'm sure that my Mamma
knows much better than a newspaper what is 'very proper' for one;
and I know that when the other night I danced six times with young
Lobd Cbcesus, Ma whispered me en passant to try and dance a seventh,
and told me when I had done so, that it was 'veryproper!'
"But variety, you know, isn't always charming, is it f at any rate,
in Canada it doesn't seem to be so. At least, although the paper says
that tbe Prince has 'gained the affection of many true and worthy
hearts,' I don't much think His Highness has lost his own at present.
And I hope he'll bring it back with him as whole as it was, doubtless,
when he took it out; though for that matter, perhaps, if it really is
the law that he musn't form a marriage with a nice good English girl,
I don't know, but I'd like him to bring home a born Yankee rather
than be forced for some ridiculous Stale reasons, to give his Royal
hand to one of those Small Germans, who are doubtless looking out
for it.
"I am, dear Mr. Punch, yours, and Oh! the Prince's, if he might
but have me!

But now the arrears of the work must be done,

This is no time for haggling, and shaping, and squaring;
A fig for each saved candle-end and cheeseparing!
Into items we'd rather you didn't look close,
Just give us the sums that we want, in the gross.
With your priv'lege of voting the cash be content,
And don't bother your heads about how it is spent—

A PKINCE IN A YANKEE PRINT.
An American journal has cut out our Court Circular. The special
reporter of the New York Herald, appointed to watch and record the
progress of the Prince op Wales, relates, with wonderful minuteness
the performance, by his Royal Highness, of actions of which the
importance is immense. For instance:—
"At tho Newfoundland ball he danced cloven of tho thirteen dances; but last
ntght ho was the hero of seven quadrilles, four waltzes, four gallops, and throe
polkas."
Put that grand fact down, Clio. Note this also, Muse of History:—
"This morning bo was out In plain dress, walking with his suite."
Book also the following memorable relations i—
"At eleven he appeared in uniform, and held a levee at the Government House,
which was attended by 30O persons. At half-past tweivo he stood, hat in hand,
with his suite, and was photographed in the private grounds of Government House.
At half-past two the Princo drove in an open carriage with Lord and Lady Mul-
orave. the Dcke or Newcastle, and Lord 8t Germans, to the dockyard, and
embarked amid the thunders of a Royal salute from the batteries and ships, and the
choers of a vast multitude, for the Nile, to lunch with the admiral, and witness the
regatta."
Of all the details in the foregoing narrative the most striking, per-
haps, is the specification of the solemn circumstance, that the Pbince
op Wales stood, hat in hand, with his suite, and was photographed
in the private grounds of Government House at half-past twelve.
It is much to be regretted that the republican chronicler of the
princely movements was not, also, photographed at the same time.
Standing, watch in hand for his part, to time every change and transi-
tion of occupation or attitude on the part of his Royal Highness, he
must himself have presented a picture of considerable grandeur and
dignity. Ah! if all historians had only paid equal regard to exactness
in taking notes of the acts and deeds of illustrious personages, there
would be much less controversy than there unhappily is about many
vital points in history, sacred and profane. But now for an ascent to
particulars, even exceeding in consequence the most tremendous things
contained in the preceding narrative :—
11 ne afterwards went on board tho Hero, and substituted for his uniform a pair
of drab trousers, a dark-blue buttoned walking .coat., with an outsido breast pocket
for the handkerchief, an ordinary block hat, and walking-stick."
Here is a specimen of glorious word-painting indeed! For to what
nobler purpose could words be applied than that of expressing the
colours of toe clot hes of a Prince, and informing a breathlessly atten-
tive world that his trousers were drab, that his walking-coat was blue,
and his bat black? The further information that our Prince's walking
coat was buttoned, and that it had on the outside of it a breast-pocket
for the handkerchief, will be perused with eager interest wherever the
English language is spoken, and will excite the enthusiasm of gene-
rations yet unborn, especially when it is recollected that this attire
was substituted for a uniform on board the Hero; because if that is not
an heroic act, what is P We can only lament that the foregoing im-
pressive inventory of his Royal Highness's costume contains no
account of his cravat, and not any mention of his boots; so that we do
not know whether the former was white, black, or coloured, and as to
the latter, although we may safely conjecture that they were of patent
leather, we are not enabled even to guess whether they were Welling-
tons or anklejacks with elastic side-springs. The reporter of the Neto
York Herald forgets also to tell us what gloves were worn by the
Prince op Wales, and if he wore two or only one; a question
naturally suggested by the consideration that he carried a walking-
stick, in which case he may have worn his left glove only, and held the
right in his left hand, or vice vend, or have had both hands gloved and
his stick in either one of them.
Those who are not magnanimous enough to care about the boots or
clothes in which the Prince op Wales is astonishing the American
mind, may yet rejoice to know that the wearer of those habiliments is
comporting himself in such a manner as to increase the great popularity
which he necessarily inherits.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
uoust 13. Monday. The
Festival or St. Grouse!
and here were Lords and
Commons blazing away in
Parliament instead of on
the Moors! As a warning
to posterity, Mr. Punch
would give due promi-
nence to this disgraceful
fact, and he therefore has
employed it as the base
of his Big Cut. Having
gabbled away their time
in the begiuning of the
Session, Members now are
kept in town to do the
work they have neglected;
like a lot of lazy school-
boys, who, having larked
in school-time, are stopped
from going out. Many a
sportsman, surely, as he
snoozes in the smoking-
room, or snores on the
back benches, must be
haunted by the ghosts of
the Keepers who are wait-
ing for him, and must
mistake the grumblings
and the groanings over
the Estimates for the
yelpings and the grow-
ings of his impatient dogs.
The result of the days
sport may be told in no great space. A large covey of Bills was
fut up by their Lordships, some of which were done for (being
loyally Assented to); while others, not so forward, were "advanced
a stage," with the intent of being bagged the next time they
were flushed. The Earl op Harrington got some sport out of
the Ireland Refreshment Houses, by saying that the Bishops who
opposed the Gin Bill were "Spiritual" Lords; and that the cheap
wines which Mr. Gladstone patronised were made from "grapestalks
mixed with water and trodden with dirty feet." These statements
both elicited the laughter of their Lordships; as did likewise the con-
fession that the Earl had "in his earl-icr days indulged in no illiberal
potations of wine, hut he had never yet discovered that they had a
sobering quality." Let the reader recollect this remarkable assertion!
The day's sport in the Commons was begun by Sir Charles Wood,
who fired away for some few hours upon the Indian Finances. All
this verbal ammunition may be shot off in one volley: India wants
Three Millions; will England let her borrow themP The interest
taken in our finding capital for India was strikingly evinced by the
aspect of our Parliament. When Sir Charles Wood opened fire
there was No House to attend to him, there being less than forty of
our Statesmen who were present; and the Debate, which ended in the
question being assented to, was conducted for the most part before
less t han thirty listeners.
Having thus resolved to fortify the Indian Finances, the thirty (or
forty) turned their tongues upon the EuglUh Fortifications, and made
their miuds up, that if forts were ordered we must pay for them; and,
therefore, that the Bill for Provision of Expenses could not well he
smashed. In the discussion which took place, the Monster (Mr.
Sidnky Herbert) made a good defence for Government for the plans
whereby it. meant to make a better defence for Portsmouth; adding, in
Mr. Punch's private ear, with liberty to print the joke, that with
regard to placing forts about our ports, fort-iter occupa porlum"
was the rule to be observed. Instead of going to bed by ten, as they
douhlless would have done had they been out upon the Moors, the
House sat up till half-past two; but nothing further worthy of record-
ing passed, with the exception of the Bill imposing New Duties on
Spirits, which Mr. Home and other Mediums would do well to
peruse.
Tuesday. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, who has some knowledge
of the Turks, wished to know if Government bad sent a ship of war to
Smyrna for the protection of the Christians; whereto Government
replied, through the medium of Lord Wodehouse, that no ship had
been sent to Smyrna quite direct, hut that a strong squadron had
orders to cruise along the Syrian coast, and if any row occurred they
would assuredly be down upon it. The chances were though, that
their presence would prevent such contingency; for no cur of a Druse
would ever dare to show his teeth while he was in reach of the bite of
British "bulldogs." On the Gas Bill being considered there was a
bit of a flare-up, several uuble lords opining that the measure was a
bad one, and Lord Llanover explaining that it would have been
much better had not the companies put such a pressure on the
Commons.
Among the latter Mr. James produced a slight sensation by asking
Mr, Cowper, First Commissioner of Works, if he had delivered a dis-
course last Sunday in Hyde Park, and had harangued the British people
on the subject of "Cowper's Folly," called otherwise his "Ride. In
reply, Mr. Cowper confessed that he had done a little Sunday spouting,
for the Ride was such a hobby of his, that he couldn't well help mounting
it whenever he had a chance. But he declared that what he said was
quite on his own hook, and did not in any manner compromise the
Government. Mr. Punch, however, cannot quite agree in this opinion,
for he doubts if it comports with the dignity of senators to get upon
their legs among al fresco meetings, and let off fireworks about them-
selves to amuse a London mob. Mr. Punch has little wish to see his
friend Lord Palmerston step down from the Forum which he so long
has graced, to address a Mr. Buggins on the subject of the Income-
Tax. or harangue a Mr. Huggins on the policy of Turkey or the posture
of the Pope. <
Having talked for a few minutes about Corporal Punishment (which
Mr. Annus and the Wiscount thought was very much too frequently
adopted in our gaols, and Mr. Punch, it is unnecessary to state, thinks
the reverse), the House inflicted a small dose of it upon itself, by
sitting on the Estimates until after two o'clock. During the discussion
Sir John Pakington endeavoured to get Members to Resolve that
ragged schools should be more aided by the Government; but Members
(who had mostly good coats on their backs) did not seem to see the
need of giving more help to the ragged, and so the motion, on division,
was lost by 41 to 25. Mr Punch mentions the numbers to show how
many there are in Parliament who really care about the Education of
the People, this being the evening when the grant for National Schools
was (through the people's representatives) nationally discussed.
Wednesday. The Commons in Committee were engaged in consider-
ing the Civil Service Estimates, which, strange' as it may seem, did not
include an estimate of the services of Mr. Punch. The discussion, like
the Estimates, was somewhat miscellaneous, embracing several subjects
quite foreign to the matter; such, for instance, as the recent f quabble
down at Guildford, between Mr. Justice Blackburn and Mr.
Sheriff Evelyn, about which Mr. Punch may have something else to
say. It should be noted, too, that though the Commons rose at Six
o'clock, the Wiscount had been on bis legs no less than twice six
times. But when was Williams ever known to forget his country's
interests P May the bump of his Economy never grow one atom less!
Thursday. The Lords had a rattling battue of little Bills; after
which, the Earl of Harrington made a sadly silly speech, attempt-
ing to pit himself against Sir Alexander Cockburn in determining
what evidence a Court of Justice should receive. The case was one
which Mr. Punch has recently adverted to, of a medical man at Lewes,
who was cruelly accused of murdering his mother; an accusation
which (except in the eyesight of Lord Harrington) there was not a
scrap or shred of evidence to prove. With proper sternness was his
Lordship rebuked by the Lord Chancellor, who said his Lordship's
motion was "utterly uncalled for," and that he ought to have known
better than to cast doubts on a trial which "had been fairly conducted
in the face of t he country."
The other House was occupied in shovelling out Supplies; where-
anent there was some talk about the British Museum, which Mr.
Atrton said (to use an American expression) was sartinly a-gitten
sorter bust up by the Bilers. The latter (known less commonly as
the Kensington Museum) were open in the evening, and therefore could
be visited, whereas the show in Bloomsbury was only visible by day-
light, when working-men had little opportunity to profit by it. A
question being raised as to whether Government knew that recruits
were being enlisted here to serve under Garibaldi, Lord Palmer-
ston said that Government had no knowledge of the fact, but when
they had he felt quite sure that they would "do their duty." As their
duty seems to be to put the Foreign Enlistment Act in operation,
Volunteers who talk of going to have a crack at Bomba had better
just read over the provisions of that Act. A resolutbn granting a sum
of near three hundred thousand pounds for education of the Irish was
the signal, not unnaturally, for a regular Irish row, more especially
as Mr. Gardwell, the mover for the vote, showed most clearly that
the money would be profitably spent. The vote being agreed to, after
much verbal shillelaghing, the House adjourned at soon after half-past
three a.m.
Friday. The Lords talked for two hours, but did not say two words
which Mr. Punch deems worth reporting.
Although up late t he night before, the Commons met at noon, when
Mr. Gladstone said he wanted a couple of millions raised by Exche-
quer Bonds or Bills (he didn't much care which), and having explained
that but for the wet weather he would only have wanted one, the House
consulted its barometer, and agreed to his request. Shovelling out
Supplies was then the order of the day, and in the evening this agree-
able occupation was resumed. Time was, however, founa for talk on
some few dozen other topics on the tapis, and among them Lord

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I'uuioY called attention to the fact that a 'black blackguard
named Badahung, who is at present king of Dahomey, is going
to butcher in cold blood a couple of thousand prisoners, as a
"grand custom" in honour of the death of the late king. In
regard to this, Lord Palmerston said, that endeavours had been
made to "persuade" the Royal miscreant to give up these little
luxuries: his Lordship adding, that wlule the Slave Trade lasted
there was little good in preaching to black blackguards about Cruelty:
and so long as there were white blackguards who spent money in the
Slave Trade, we could not well expect black blackguards to abandon it.
Saturday. At Two o'clock, a.m., the Parliamentary proceedings were
closed by Mr. Punch, who walked home arm-in-arm with the juvenes-
cent Premier; and having lately been engaged in brushing up his
Scottish (no, don't say "Scotch," please, Wiscount!) with the view
of holding converse with the keepers on his moor, gave vent to his
disgust at the dulness of the Session in the following sad strain:—
There is nae spoort about the House,
There is nae spoort at a*;
I wad I were amang the grouse,
Five hoonder' miles awa!
THE REV. ROBIN REDBREAST
The Redbreast has acquired a good name which he little deserves.
In point of fact he is a fierce and pugnacious little wretch, apt to kill
the other small birds in an aviary, and peck their eyes out. His intiu-
sive impudence, however, passes for affection towards mankind, and
Ids requiem-like song has gained for him a peculiar character for ten-
derness and compassion; insomuch that the old ballad-maker is gene-
rally felt to have conceived a natural idea in relating of the Children
in the Wood," the pathetic circumstance that—
"Robin Redbreast painfully
Did cover tbeni with leaves."
The truth is, that Robin Redbreast would never dream of doing
aught approaching to sexton's work, except in order, on his own per-
sonal account, to pick up worms. However, he has a reputation
for the piety which performs the last offices to humanity—has, as
aforesaid, acquired a good name; a name for performing the charity of
sepulture: and t hat good name may therefore be fitly transferred to the
Rev. Stephen Rosse Hughes, of Llanallgo, near Moelfre, Anglesey,
and also to his brother the Rev. Hugh Robert Hughes, of Penrhos-
lligwy, who, between them, interred about 230 bodies of persons lost
in the Royal Charter. This herculean as w'ell as Christian feat they
accomplished with the least possible assistance. A horse, a cart, a
sheet, and three or four men, formed all the appliances whereby the
former of the above-named truly reverend gentlemen managed to unite
the duties of the clergyman with those of the undertaker. At Llanallgo
there lay at one time the corpses of 40 men and women requiring to be
identified, and awaiting burial. They were both identified and ouried
by the Rev. Stephen Hughes, whose house in the meanwhile was
crowded with their inquiring and distracted relatives. He buried 145
bodies; had to exhume several for inspection by friends; kept a pitch
fire burning to disinfect the atmosphere, and a white surplice hanging
at hand on his door; and had to write 1,070 letters. His reverend
brother's labours may be pretty nearly expressed by the word ditto.
Their arduous, melancholy, and unpleasant but generous exertions
have cost them dear.
The foregoing facts having been considered, a subscription has been
started, with a view to present the Rev. Robin Redbreast, alias the
Rev. S. R. Hughes, and his brother, the Rev. H. R. Hughes, with a
purse. Surely the fuller that purse can be filled, the better, that it.
may rather more than reimburse them for their actual expenses; and
all those gentlemen and ladies who are of that opinion are at liberty to
express it by remitting a sum of money to Pbescott, Grote & Co,
Threadneedle Street; the Commercial Bank, Henrietta Street i or the
gentleman named in the Times advertisement whence the above
particulars are derived.
The erection of a monolith at Moelfre to the memory of those who
were drowned, is also proposed; and anybody can contribute to that
object also, who considers that a gravestone is an advantage to the
dead, a solace to the living, or an object of interest to posterity.
Carrying Coals to Newcastle.
A PABAGBAPn has lately been "going the round of the Press," in-
forming us that Puiiice Lucien Bonaparte has recently visited Nor-
folk, for the purpose of taking rubbings of some of the "brasses"
in that county. Has Prince Lucien exhausted his own family
resources in this respect? One would suppose that the Emperor and
SPIRIT CONJURING.
There are some people in the world who daringly declare, however
vulgarly unfashionable they make themselves by doing so, that the so-
called "manifestations" of Mr. Home and other Spirit-rappers are
manifestly merely the machinations of a conjurer. The trick of spiritual
elevation, or rising in the air, t hey say is done in a like way as the
aerial suspension by Robert Houdin of his son; while t he show of
spirit-hands, which is effected in the dark, they protest may be achieved
by just a bit of wax or wood, displayed by the mere aid of lazy-tongs
and phosphorus. In fact, they look upon a "Medium" as merely at
accomplice, and say that spirits may be raised by the wonder-working
magic of the Wizard of the North, or the almost supernatural diablerie
of Dobler. ,,
Now, disposed as Punch may be to coincide in their opinion. Punch
cannot quite allow that he thinks it is a fair one; in so far at least as it
tends to make comparison between a rapper and a conjurer. The
spirit tricksters always do their chief tricks in the dark, and only in
the presence of persons who believe in them. Sceptics like Mr. Punch
are carefully excluded, or if admit ted, obtain entrance upon such con-
ditions only as preclude their fairly testing the trickeries they witness.
In fact, knowing well what clumsy machinery they work with, the
rappers live in constant dread of its detection, and by working in the
dark they take precautions not to let the faintest ray of light upon it.
They confess themselves thereby far inferior to the Wizards of the
North, South, East, or West, and in no sense are they worthy to be
named in the same breath with a Houdin or a Doblbr, or a Wiljalba
Frikell. No -. Mr. Home may call himself a Rapper if he likes; but,
whatever else he be, he clearly is No Conjurer.

Unspeakable Atrocity.
Those horrid snobs who deprecate the nice new torse-ride which
Mr. Cowper has provided for the Superior Classes in Kensington
Gardens—wretches who are unable to pronounce the letter h in its
right place—have actually the bad taste and vulgarity to denominate
that fashionable hippodrome an 'o
nd vulgarity to denoniina

Then there's that Gladstone too—the man is one of my specific hates—
Must be going and reducing the charge for Game certificates!
I suppose there weren't already guns enough—past keeping count of
'em—
Blazing and banging at us, thai be doubles the amount of 'em.
One would think his iortfc-conjuring, with all its orop of quarrels.
Might have made him somewhat scrupulous of so increasing barrels.
Mrs. Grouse.
Such Glad-stones may do for pavement, side by side with good iutentions;
Of course you know they serve to pave a place one never mentions:
But one thing we do owe the man.
Mrs. Partridge.
Indeed? And pray what is it P
Mrs. Grouse.
Not one M. P. upon the 12th was free the Moors to visit.
Thanks to Mr. Gladstone's budget, and the way that it was gibbeted.
Mrs. Partridge.
And that cock-and-bull-Reform Bill—
Mrs. Grouse.
No doubt that, too, contributed—
Treas'ry Bench and Opposition, on the one ground or the other,
Instead of firing into us, have been firing at each other.
Spending their powder and their shot in squabbling, talk, and chatter,
As if time were so abundant that its waste could make no matter.
How John Bull stands that House, with all its blatancy and bubbles,
Amazes us up on the Moors—
Mrs. Partridge.
And us, down in the stubbles.
Thiuk if our old cocks sat crowing aud laying down the law,
When they should be picking grubs up for their ladies in the straw,
Or on the walch for keepers or beaters, or p'raps netters,
Not to speak of guns and pointers, retriever dogs and setters?
Mrs. Grouse.
Yes, indeed, dear Mrs. P.; and if tee in our vocation,
Behaved like representatives of this poor British nation,
What hosts of ill-starred squeakers to death we should see paddled,
What number of good eggs, by bad sitting, would be addled!
What scores of bad eggs brooded that could never come to chicks,
However sanguine the mamma, and free from gadding tricks.
In short, G. says, if tee did things "in Parliamenii modo."
Partridge and Grouse would shortly be as mythic as the Dodo!
Mrs. Partridge.
"'Tis an ill wind blows no one good," so the old proverb runs,
The more M.P.s fire off their talk, the less they '11 use their guns.
And when they do. it's well for us, though serious for their pots,
That, judging by their speeches, they 're uncommonly bad shots.

SINGULAR IF TRUE.
(An extract from the Vote-book of a Spiritual Enthusiast.)*
N the name of the
.Prophet,—Figs!"
was the oft re-
peated cry of the
truly pious Mus-
sulman; and a si-
milar ejaculation
may possibly be
uttered by unbe-
lieving Giaours
who read this
strange narration,
and instead of being
awed by it, incline
to laugh at my ex-
pense. The fear-
fully appalling facts
which I describe,
these sceptics will
regard as merely
optical delusions,
and of no moment
whatever, even
were they truths.
But disbelief is the
resource of unin-
quiriug intellects.
Sluggish minds de-
cline to jump to a
conclusion. They
find such mental eiercise very far too active for them. Scepticism is
indeed the common characteristic of the vulgar English people. Your
snub pleheian nose turns up at anything which is not stupidly conven-
tional. It is the sharp, thin, highborn nostril that sniffs out novel
wonders, and graciously inclines itself to persons who are elsewhere
held in doubtful odour. Sweet to it is the propinquity of savans and
Ehilosophers whom the common plebs regards as charlatans and quacks,
ecause it is too lazy to submit to be converted by them.
To begin at the beginning, it is needful I should state, that I tho-
roughly Believe in all the mysteries of spirit-rapping, and have often
turned my hand to the turning of a table, which science (so my friends
say) bas almost turned my head.- All my life indeed, or at least since
I have come to years of gin-discretion, I have had an almost daily
acquaintanceship with spirits, and have summoned them whenever I
have (gratis) got the chance. My last spiritual intercourse was, how-
ever, so extraordinary that I feel it is my duty to expand the notes I
made of it: a feeling which I need not say is somewhat strengthened
by the hope that my narration will be liberally paid for by the editor
who has the fortune to be favoured with it.
Having thus taken the reader into my confidence, I must now take
him, in spirit, to the parlour of a tavern, where the spiritual wonders
occurred which I relate. The time is morning; and the only persons
present are two gentlemen, one of whom, it must be needless to men-
tion, is myself. The other is a friend of mine, whom I have ever trusted
as far as I could see him, and if he gave me good security would even
trust him farther still. We are at breakfast, and two bloaters have
been placed before me, which I am requested by my friend to help.
In one hand I hold a knife which is rather the worse for wear, having
a split handle and a limp bent point; and in the other I have a fork
which is not over clean, and has been in its youth deprived of one of
its three prongs. Just as 1 am proceeding to obey my friend's behest,
and am in the act of t.ransfixal ion of the bloater which is next to me, I
see the fish give a decided wriggle with its tail, as though it were
endeavouring to escape my thrust; and at the same time a soft gurgle
strikes upon my ear, apparently proceeding from the gullet of the fish.
Startled, yet not appalled, by what is very obviously a spiritual pheno-
menon, I prepare again to thrust my fork into the fish; but lo! again
there is a waggle of the spirit-moving tail, and again I hear a murmur
of soft music from the mouth. This convincing me, of course, that a
spirit must be present, I gain my friend's permission to use him as a
Medium, and go through the usual dodges to place him en rapport. To
the question, if the Bloater had anything to say why we should not
demolish it, the response was given audibly, "/ guess you'd better
not!" and then, in explanation of this spiritual warning, we were told
that it (the fish) had died a natural death, and it felt therefore pretty
* Mr. Punch need scarcely state that, though the writer of this narrative is perfectly
well-known to him, be does not put tbe slightest atom of belief in it, nor does he
expect that any of bis readers will. They are, however, welcome to do so if they
like, so long as they first buy, and do not meanly borrow, the number that contains
it. In the words of the immortal showman (slightly alteredX Mr. Punch would say:
"My dears, first pay me dewn your money, and then I will concede you leave to
Uke your choice.'1
sure that it would disagree with us. Being asked, what it could do to
show that we might trust it, the Bloater gradually raised itself, and
stood straight up on its tail; and then most reverentially bowed its
head to each of us, and placed at the same time its fin upon its heart.
The Bloater then informed us, that its parents were both dead, and
that the fish which lay beside it was its only brother; a cruel codling
having swallowed all the spawn their mother laid, with the exception of
the ova whence these two orphans sprang. On being further questioned
as to its relations, the Bloater said it was descended on the side of its
great grandmother from the singing fish inhabiting the waters of
Ceylon; and proudly added that this ancestress had assisted in the
chorus at the concert under water, which was given some few
years since at the bottom of Lake Chilka, in the presence of a most
distinguished auditory; among whom was the Governor, Sir Emerson
Tennent, who was good enough to publish a report of the performance
in his interesting book. This confession tempted me to ask the fish,
if the ancestral talent had descended to it, and, a modest gulp and
gurgle confessing that it had, I boldly asked the Bloater to oblige us
with a song. Whereat with a slight show of not unnatural reluctance,
the fish, in a faint treble, st ruck up this plaintive stave:—
"Some liko coffee. Borne like tea.
Some 'ike herrings just liko Mo I
I once was white: I now am red:
Just think of this wben you go to bed.
C'honu. Bitch a getting up-stairs, and a"
Here the singer was attacked with a violent fit of coughing, which it
explained by telling us that some of the salt it had been cured with
had got into its pills. Further conversation being thus precluded, our
interesting seance was perforce brought to an end. I ought to add,
however, that my friend, who as 1 have said had been acting as my
Medium, had been throughout the interview in a most excited state,
declaring every now and then that he believed I had gone mad. or else
—I can't help smiling at the ludicrous alternative—or else he said,
I had been dining out the night before, and had not yet managed to
get over my debauch. To convince him how preposterous was this
absurd impression, I asked him which of the lour bloaters he would
like first to be helped to, that I might show him that my hand and
head were every wnit as clear and steady as his own. On this he
burst into a coarse laugh, and protested that there were only two fish
in the dish; which of course was pure invention suggested by his
malice at finding me the one most spiritually favoured; for it was 1
who first found out that there were spirits present, and thus had proved
I was more influenced by them than himself.
THE SONG OF THE TALKATIVE MEMBER.
Air—" let tu all tptah our minds, if we die for it."
Punch tells me *t;s fit that M.P.s should submit
To be tongue-tied submissively, meekly:
That the nonsense we say for some eight, hours a day
Should be cut down to one hour weekly;
We are begged, just for peace, our prattle to cease,
As there's neither a wherefore nor why for it;
But I can't and I don't, and I shan't, and I won't—
No, I toUi make a speech, if I die for it!
Friends who owe one a grudge say one's talk is all fudge-
Mere bombast and bunkum, and so on:
But you'll surely allow we've a right to say how,
We consider that matters should go on.
The business indeed would far quicker proceed,
If we simply said " No" or said "Aye " to it:
But. we don't, and we can't, and we won't, and we shan't—
No, we will make a speech, if we die for it!
So all talkers, I hope, will take plenty of rope,
Nor care with what interests they trifle;
With ease, if we choose our tongues but to use,
We may all legislation quite stifle.
Let Pam. if he will, then bid us be still,
And silent, he '11 have to pay high for it;
For we can't and we don't, and we shan't, and we won't—
No, we '11 all of us speak, if we die for it!
The Pope's Own.
Pope's Essay on Man is a great work; but Pope's Essay on (Irish)
Kian seems likely to turn out an alarming failure. We perceive that
Major Laffan, the commander of these broths of boys,—broths that
boil up at once, and require no stirring at all, at all—appends to his
name the appropriate addition "of Knock Abbey," a name redolent
of the Church-militant. He must find his duty of keeping down the
Celtic exuberance of the Brigade anything but a Latfan matter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
M,
COMPOSITION BY AN ENGLISH MASTER.
ut of all the curiosities
of advertising litera-
ture few are much
more remarkable than
the subjoined adver-
tisement :—
ANSION HOUSE
SCHOOL, 8t. David s,
Exeter, will Re-opon on
Thursday. 20th July. Mr.
Hyphen has a few vacan-
cies to supply the places
of Pupils leaving school.
This 8chonl educates
Boys for the Civil Service,
Military, and Oxford and
Cambridge Local Exami-
nations.
The instruction of the
whole School is prepara-
tory for theso latter ex-
aminations, tho highest
class going in for tho
senior, and the next for
the junior branch of them.
At the Oxford Local Ex-
amination for 1859, Mr.
Hyphen passed more Can-
didates than any School in
England, and at the Cam-
bridge Examination for
the same year was second
only to the Livorpool Col-
legiate Institution.
Ma. Hyphen's school
educates boys for the
"Oxford and Cam-
bridge Local Examinations" as well as for "the Civil Service" and the "Military." That
is, perhaps, to say, that Mr. Hyphen does not educate them without assistance. If Mb.
Hyphen did "pass more candidates than any school in England" last year at the Oxford
Local Examination, and (in passing candidates) "was second only to the Liverpool Collegiate

Institution," it must be presumed that he did
not educate them in all the branches of learning
wherein he contrived to pass them. Indeed it
is difficult to conceive in what department of
education he could possibly have instructed
them. Mr. Hyphen appears to be what is
called an English master, and to merit that
appellation by inability to write English. What
does he mean by saving that he "has a few
vacancies to supply the places of pupils leaving
school?" Grammatically this is nonsense; but
the sense which he would express, if he could,
probably is simply that he has a few vacancies for
pupils. Unless he keeps a staff of competent
ushers, doesn't he wish ne may get them P
A Song about a Sheriff.
TnE penalty which Mr. Justice Blackburn
imposed the other day at Guildford on 'Squire
Eveltn, the respected High Sheriff of Surrey,
will long be remembered in that polite sphere
of society of which the affable and learned Judge
is so distinguished an ornament. In moments
of postpraudial conviviality, no doubt, Judge
Blackburn will often be called upon Jo ('"

English Gentleman!'
MAKING GAME OF THE SPEAKER.
An enthusiastic partridge-shooter, who has the
misfortune to be an M.P., and of course looks
forward with horror to the prolongation of the
Session into September, under the influence of his
partridge prepossessions, the other day addressed
I he august occupant of the Chair of the House as
"Mr. Sque
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
"My dear Punch,
"WnEN good Queen Bess, of pious memory, visited the
well-known College of Saint Ulric's, Eastminster, the youDg gentlemen
who were educated at that establishment used to pass in review before
her.
"Who has not heard the pretty jest (all jests were pretty in those
days) made by the scholar who, on one of these occasions was asked
by her Majesty, when he had last been flogged? Quoting a celebrated
Epic poet, as he dropped on one knee, the arch boy replied—
"Infandum, regina jubes, renovare dolorcm,"
and was immediately rewarded with a groat from the Privy Purse, or,
as some say, by a buss from the Boyal lips.
"The anecdote was related to me as 1 pored over my Virgil in the
fourth form at Eastminster, and I remember thinking the youth must
have been a prodigy of wit and satire. Eor such a sally to so great a
Bess, fourpence certainly seems an insignificant tip; but having my
roat, I don't think I should have cared for the otlier portion of the
"Grindley, whose fag I was at school, and who is now an under-
master at Eastminster, comes up to town for the holidays, and at
breakfast with me one morning, suggested the above-mentioned subject
for a picture.
"I don't think it would make a bad group. Fancy the maiden
Queen in her Royal robes and ruffles (carefully studied in the Post-
Peruginesque manner), Dr. Pedagogus, cap in hand, looking fat and
smiling (as every Head master ought to look in the presence of his
Sovereign) and the chubby honest school-boy pointing to a flogging-
stool 1 of the period.'
"Full of the idea, I went down last week to the scenes of my youth,
which 1 had not visited for many years. '0 Tempos edax rerum! what
has become of the Tantivy coach, "driven by Snapfler, ablest of whips,
by whose side I was so proud to sit, as the vehicle rolled up to the
College Arms? The journey which once occupied a day, is now accom-
plished in a couple of hours. The Tantivy has gone the way of all
wood and varnish, and Snapfler—perhaps he too has driven off into
Hades.
"There are moments in a man's life subject to sensations which it is
impossible to define. What were mine on revisiting these Classic
regions f Was the retrospect pleasurable or otherwise P I vow I
cannot say. A host of old associations rise up to plead on either side,
and make the verdict doubtful. When the author of The Anatomy of
Melancholy felt unhappy, he rushed to the river-side, and listened to
the bargemen's merry chaff. For my part I prefer a moral homoeopathy,
and earnestly recommend stinging-nettles for ill-humour. Was Burton
gloomy at sixteen P 1 trow not. Schools never grow old. Schoolboys
are always jolly—
"O fortunatos nimium sua si bona norint"
[you see I am quoting from the Latin Grammar, with which I was once
tolerably familiar: don't suppose, however, that / wish to set up for a
scholar, or can construe so much as a line of Ovid without a dictionary.J
"It is twelve o'clock, and the boys come rushing down from prayers,
which, in accordance with ancient precedent are always recited in the
heathen tongue. Two or three of the monitors in infinitesimal white
ties (in my day we exhibited a bow of gigantic proportions) stalk up,
and, with a sort of bashful impudence, characteristic of our British
youth—inquire my business. 'An old Oppidan, eh?' says one, 'what
name? EaselP O yes—it's up school in the fourth, along with
Jones and Tryagoen.' (We all had our names painted up on the
walls in medieval characters by a High Church plumber who held
hereditary office, and so only charged us a guinea a-piece for the job).
'I suppose you d like to go over the old shop—and I say—come and
dine with us in Hall,' added the Captain very graciously. 'Senior
table you know—let me see—mutton to-day—here! You feller. Brown!
run to Mother Hardbake's, and get me a pot of red-currant jelly,
and—hi, stop a minute! can't you—say the last was mildewy, and she a
better send it good this time—look sharp now, take it to Hall.' And
here Mr. Brown, Jun., who in the holidays has a powdered retainer,
six feet high, with tremendous calves, to do his bidding, set off on bis
errand without a murmur.
"Yes, Mrs. B., your son is undergoing his probationary term as a
fag, as many a good fellow has done before him. Very dreadful, is it
not P gentle youths treated as menials. Confess now, didn't you
expect that in a community of gentlemen, *&c. &c. &c.' Gentlemen!
Lord bless you, Madam, if I kept Burke's Peerage in my studio (I
mean to get a copy as soon as ever I can afford it—it looks so very
respectable)—I say if I had the Peerage or the Palace Register at
hand, I could point out a dozen titled personages who, in the capacity
of fags, have made coffee, brushed coats, and posted letters for Jack
Easel, Esq., and I, in my turn have done a hundred like kind offices
for Messrs. Bobtail and Tagge (the eminent button-manufacturers)
before those gentlemen assumed the toga virilis, or succeeded to their
Parent's business. And are we not all the better for the disciplineP

read with a Swiss pastor at Zuricb, or placed him at the Honourable
and .Reverend Meelet Mouther's Seminary for young gentlemen,
he might have escaped 'the horrid system;' but permit me to say, that
he would in all probability have grown up a milksop, and perhaps
encountered worse evils than having to fetch a pot of jam. At a
private school he might have been at the mercy of any tall dunce who
chose to bully him. As for foreign establishments—I own I am preju-
diced—but when I remember what an insufferable young puppy a
French 'e'colier' generally is, when I think of German 'burscnen'
ripping up each other's noses in honour of a yard of twopenny ribbon,
1 mast say I am thankful my Alma Mater lived on British' soil.
"As we enter the old building, Bon the porter looks hard at me
and touches bis hat. How many nights has Bob mounted guard at
the College gates—the old Cerberus! (he has but one head on his
shoulders, but it is a knowing one). Bob is stern and incorrupt. If
young gentlemen will stay out after lock-hours, is it his fault? Bob
has a son who is called young Bob, and is growing up the image of his
sire. By-and-by he will hold the keys of office and become old Bob
himself (the sobriquet is hereditary), 'and thus from hour to hoar we
ripe and ripe, and then—' pooh! the sentiment is an old one.
"A score of familiar objects present themselves, and set me a-thinking
or old times. At this desk sat Dick searching for 'synonyms1 in his
Gradus, and composing those wonderful stanzas which were sure to be
criticised so unmercifully the next morning. In those days it was the
fashion to translate Pore into Latin elegiacs (we were rather famous
for our verses at Eastminster), and I remember Dick's 'rendering'
'Lo, the poor Indian whose untutored, &c.' by
11 Indicus occo rudis eujun mtnt artibus oxpors,"
than which, perhaps you never read a more execrable hexameter. I
thought Dr. Dactyl, the second master, would have gone off in a lit of
apoplexy when he read the line, but his constitution survived the shock;
and I read in the Guardian the other day that he had been raised to
the See of Azov, in which episcopal and lucrative post he will doubtless
be able to turn his attention to 'quantities.' Here sat poor Dick, I
say, thumbing his Gradus or stammering over the woes of Hecuba—
yet why 'poor Dick?' if he made no use of his pen, he soon learned to
wield his sword. In the shout of battle he forgot the horrors of a
Greek chorus, and gained more laurels one morning in the Crimea than
he might have gathered all his life hobbling over Mount Parnassus.
"What has become of the rest of 'our set?' Where is the studious
Mugweix who read Hebrew better than the Doctor himself, and
whose highest ambition was to gain the Scholarship awarded to pro-
ficients in that profound language? Where are the laughter-loving
Jolliffe, and Trotman of the seedy highlows? Where is Swkllino-
ton, the beauty of whose waistcoats so raised our envy that we called
him, ironically, the 'Gorgeous Vest?' Some we have missed, and
some we know, and some it is expedient to forget. I saw Lord
Stoneiiouse cut Fred Stippler dead last year in Rome because the
honest painter had adopted the easy dress and manners of the Cafe
Hellenico, and yet I remember them together at the school-confec-
tioner's, vowing eternal friendship and pledging each other in goblets
of ginger beer. 'Tick me a puff, Motuer Hardbake!' I think I
hear his Lordship say. Good Heavens! what a lot of pastry we could
digest in those days!

A SWIMMING EXAMPLE.
We in general pay but small regard to penny-a-liner paragraphs, but
here is one deserving of exception from our rule :—
"Presence or Mind.—A son of Mr. T. of Windsor, between ten and cloven years
old, while fishing in the River Thames, fell into the water. Although unable to
swim, tho lit r to fellow, having aeen bis father indulgo in the amusement of floating'
down the stream, bad tho prusonco of mind to imituto him, by throwing himself
on his back, head straight* and his bands in bis trousor's pockcta. Ho thus floated
aomo disuince when Mr. A. of Windsor, who was rowing up tho river, hearing the
little fellow crying out 'God save me I' 'God help me I' immediately proceeded
to his roscuo."
"Death by drowning" is so frequent a heading in our newspapers
that a paragraph like this forms an agreeable relief, and we think that
the more widely it is read the better. We should like all "little fellows"
of ten or twelve years old, to get by heart this little anecdote of how
one of their own age saved himself from drowning although ho could
not swim. The story should be added to the Boy's own Book and girls
as well as boys should be made more self-reliant by it. Learn to
Float" should be an early lesson in a copy-book, and "Keep your

hands down" might be written as the one just nrxt preceding it.
Children of both sexes, until they have learned to swim (and the
sooner national swimming schools are thrown open the better), should
have their minds impressed with the easily proved fact, that their
bodies cannot sink, if they do but keep their hands down, and throw
their heads well back. Let them take example by brave little Master
T, who we hope as he grows up will go on swimmingly in life, and
always be as able as he has been in this instance to keep his head
above water.
LEGENDS NO LIES.
T the final meeting of the British
Archaeological Association the
Other day, there arose a discus-
sion, reported to have been one
of considerable int erest, relative
to the cause of the remarkable
deformity of several of the
skulls found at Wroxeter.
These skulls are twisted all
manner of ways—one side of
the face, for example, project-
ing very far in front of the
other, insomuch that, as in the
case of the youth described by
the late Charles Matuews,
both the eyes, at least their
sockets, may be seen in profile.
In a paper on the subject
of the crania thus queerly
shaped, written by Dr. 11 kniiy
Wright, their distortion was
attributed to posthumous
causes; moisture and subse-
quent frost. Mr. T. Wright, on the contrary, was inclined to think
that the heads had been deformed in infancy, they having belonged, not
to ancient Humans, but, to some of the barbarians who had destroyed the
city of Uriconium. In this opinion it is probable that Mr. T. W right
is not altogether wrong.
On the mind of whicn the early faith remains unperverted by modern
scientific theories, there can be no doubt that the misshapen skulls in
question are those of barbarians, whether bom with lop-sided logger-
heads on their shoulders, or having had their numskulls squeezed
awry in their cradles; of which suppositions the former is by far the
more probable. The universality with which Blunderbore and his
brethren, in Jack the Giant-Killer and all the like illuminated works
which antiquity has handed down for the instruction of youth, are
represented with monstrous heads, whilst the same conformation has
from time immemorial been given to similar characters in Christmas
Pantomimes, evidences a constant tradition of the existence of an
ancient race of savages whose heads were malformed and mispropor-
tioned, and who were also remarkable for prodigious noses and goggle
eyes. To this class belonged the ogres and giants about whom we
used to read, and who were no doubt all killed off by such heroes as
the Jack whose adventures are recounted in the chronicle above
quoted, and his celebrated namesake of the Beanstalk. The bulging
and contorted skulls dug up at Wroxeter are doubtless the remains of
some of the enormous louts who were destroyed either by one of
those two Champions, or by one of the Seven, or by some other
equally doughty deliverer. Perhaps it was Guy of Warwick who
extirpated all those other Guys. Geology has already proved the
literal correctness of those records of the nursery which allege the
former existence of dragons; authentic animals whose relics we behold
in the bones of the flying saurians. There is every season to suppose
that they belched smoke and fire. Archeology, hand in hand with the
sister science, demonstrates, in the amorphous skulls discovered at
Wroxeter, the kindred fact, that this island was once the abode of a
race of horribly absurd wretches at least closely allied to Cormoran,
Blunderbore, and their gigantic brotherhood, by their ugly mugs.
None but the obstinately incredulous can refuse to believe in the British
griffins of old. and the giants who, physiognomically, must have very
closely resembled the griffins.
List, List, Oh List!
Captain Styles should mind his eye. Enlisting Volunteers for
Garibaldi is a noble enterprise, but had better be carried out "upon
the shady side of the law." Otherwise John Styles may find himself
restored to his old relations with John Doe and Richard Roe.

Prince is hourly pestered witn inanimate annoyances, in the shape of
presents made to him by advertising tradesmen, whose aim is that
their names should be mentioned in the papers in connection with the
Prince. As a sample of this dodge, and not the least unpleasant one,
we find the following reported in the Daily News:—
"Prkbknts tor thk Peincr of Wales.—A Canadian paper Bays, otir friend
Rodinsow. the scissors grinder, has prepared a rustic chair for presentation; and
wo vnnturo to prodict that His Royal Highness will not boo anything in Canada with
which ho will be more astonished than ho will he with this same chair. It is orna-
mented with snakes and serpents, as well as woodcuts of Lohd Palhe&ston and
I^ihd John Russkll, who are suppotod to bo waiting for an audience with the
Prince. Mr. Robinson has abx> mado two walking-sticks for His Royal Higlincss,
one of which is painted black, and Is intended to be used at funerals only."
Of course the Falls of Niagara will fall into the shade incompaiison
with the chair which "our friend Robinson, the scissors-grinder," has
been preparing to "astonish" the mind of the young Prince. Jf the
prediction of the Canadian reporter be fulfilled, nothing iu the way of
nature or of art will come up to this wondrous piece of sedentary
location, with its fanciful adornment of snakes entwined with serpents
(will the writer by the next mail teach us to distinguish them P), wnere-
with our two first statesmen are appropriately placed. The walking-
sticks moreover were most suitably selected: for everybody knows
how much our nobles use them, and how no funeral equipment is
esteemed complete without them.
We could wish though Mr. Robinson, before he got his gifts in
readiness, had considered if His Royal Highness could receive them,
without sacrificing somewhat the dignity of England, and of Eugland's
Sovereign whom he represents. To make our Princes presents implies
that they have need of the articles presented, and this clearly is an
insult to the country of their birth. If Royalty wants rustic chairs
John Bull can afford to pay for them, and need not be beholden to
Colonial Ma. Robinsons to supply the Royal want. Mr. Bull did
not send his eldest son to Canada to be treated like a beggar by whom
the smallest contributions, walking-sticks included, would be thankfully
received. Mr. Robinson no doubt bad not the least intention of
insulting Mb, Bull. All that he intended was, just to get his name
put forward in the newspapers, as one of the 'cute traders who tried
to do a stroke of business by toadying the Prince. But Mr. Bull
will not allow his Royal boys in this way to be made commercial tra-
vellers, by being used when travelling for purposes of trade. And he
therefore gives this scissors-grinder a rap upon the knuckles with one
of his own walking-sticks, and assures him, that his absence from the
Royal precincts will always be esteemed more highly than his presents

Lokd Palmerston well
remarked, that it was
amusing to see the different
views which different Mem-
bers took of the subject of
fortifications, according to
their different lines of
thought. The plan of main-
taining an efficient fleet and
army, and, in addition, for-
tifying our chief dockyards
and arsenals with stone
walls and other defences
calculated to enable a few
men to hold them for seve-
ral weeks is, in Mr. Punch's
opinion, the best that could
be adopted—next to that of
applying to the defence of
the nation those lighter
works which are on Bale at

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
August 20. Monday. The Lords doing crank-work—grinding away
with almost profitless exertion at the nearly needless measures sent
them by the Commons. From this description of their labours must,
however, be excepted their Second Reading of the Bill for providing
Fortifications, which, with all due deference to Lord Palmerston's
French "friend," can neither be regarded as profitless nor needless.
On this point spake Lord Ellbnborough with his usual spirit, and
perhaps with something more than his usual common sense:—
"I vote for this measure most willingly, because I entertain that firm distrust of
the French Government which Lord John Rdbbell frankly told the French Govern-
ment months ago all tho world would entertain if that Government persevered in
its scheme for annexing Savoy and Nice. . . . And because when a man has
once so committed himself by his conduct as to give reason to suppose that ho does
not act from pure motives, those who believe him afterwards—Bay what ho may—
deserve any misfortune that may befall thorn."
If this should catch the eye of Our Foreign Correspondent it may
explain why his kind letter was not received so gushingly in England
as he hoped: for nine Englishmen in ten are of Lord Ellenborougii's
opinion, and the tenth would be so, too, if he did but read his
Punch.
The Commons met at half-past three, and before they got to business
had their usual go of gab. Among the hundred other interesting

wuuuoij uie f»cBbiuunter improvement ".one, bouses
are in ruins, and their inmates are in rags, and sites for building are so
filthy they are not fit to be seen. As a climax to the horrors of this
Carthage of a place, which deserves the word Delenda to mark it in
the map, Sir W. Gallwet said, that in a corner near the Abbey, the
Dean and Chapter had constructed a most hideous erection, which
"outside looked like a nunnery, and was inside, he understood, a den
of attorneys" (!). If Sir W. really wishes to improve our public
thoroughfares (which are many of tnem so foul that no fair one can
walk thorough them), there are other hideous nuisances for him, to try his
hand on: such, for instance, as the organ-fiends, the singing blacks, and
howling bellowers, who especially infest the "quiet" streets and
squares, where decent people who pay taxes have to live, and work,
and sleep—that is, if, having been born deaf, or being blest with nerves
of cast-iron, they can contrive to do so. Mr. Punch, he need not say,
will be "the man for Gallwzt," should that gentleman want help to
bring all these street nuisances beneath the operation of the Nuisances
Removal Act.
The Syrian question being opened, Lord Palmerston protested, in
reply to Mr. Monsell, that he thought it was of vital consequence to
Europe that one of the Two Sick Men should be kept, still alive, and
capable of kicking; for there undoubtedly would be a jolly row among
his neighbours if he even were dismembered, or, worse still, became
defunct. Then an Irish row of the first magnitude arose, in
reference to the Irish Party Emblems Bill, which Ma. Henhessy
protested was the "hoighth of insult;" while several other Members,
who by their language owned the sister-kingdom as their mother,
declared they felt the Bill a degradition to their counthree, and,
bedad, they meant to foight it to the last dhrop of their breath.
Tuesday. Lords still at the crank. Commons in the morning got
through a little business and a lot of talk. In the evening another of
the Innocents was Massacred; but as the innocent was nothing more
than a small Bill for doing something for the natives of New Zealand,
(which, since you ask the question. Viscount is a long way off), of course
the House was moved but little by the sacrifice, the only motion being
that it should be made.
A discussion then took place upon the Bill for Naval Discipline,
which Lord Charles Paget explained was to supersede an Act passed
in the reign of Ciiarles the Second, that had since then been the
text-book of our naval law. It was thought that as this old Act had
now seen service for two centuries, there might be some few holes in it
which required repairing; but on being overhauled it was found, like
the gunboats, in such a rotten state, that the Government resolved
that it should be put out of commission, and that a new one should be
launched, spick and span, to take its place. The Bill (which in the
main was approved by almost all the great naval authorities, including
Mr. Ayrton and Mr. Wiscotjnt Williams), will usefully facilitate the
holding of courts-martial, and will secure* them an extension of their
power to give punishment, by allowing them more liberty to sentence
men to less of it. Traitors, and only traitors, will, without alternative,
if found guilty, suffer death; but cowards and deserters, and all lesser

of any sort, will suffer it. As the Cat has been considered one of the
worst hindrances to the manning of our fleets, Mr. Punch would give
due prominence to the above-recorded facts. He would note too, that
Lord Paget "could show, by sure statistics, that this degrading
punishment is steadily decreasing, and is gradually but certainly dying
out of the service." So cheer up, my lads! Take heart, ye hearts of
oak! Your old enemy is clearly now on its last legs. Although the
Cat may have as many lives as tails, there is no 'doubt that common
sense will ere long be the death of it. "Jack Tar" is said to be
derived from jactari, to boast: and certainly our Jack Tars may boast
that by good conduct they are gradually driving the Cat out of the
service.
With the exception of a word or two about the Dean op Yobk, the
doubling of whose snug little salary Me. Bernal Osborne spoke of
as "the great job of the Session," the whole remainder of the evening
was occupied by what one can but call a Jolly Row, on the subject of
the Bill about the Boman Catholic Cliaiities, which was proposed to be
"amended" by striking out Clause L Mr. Hennesst declared that
so far from being viewed as a charitable act, the measure now must
rather be regarded as a penal one; and although his name, he owned,
was on its back, he wished the Bill to be dishonoured and returned
with "no effects." This wish was repeated by Cardinal Wiseman's
echo (need Punch mention Sir George Bowyer P), who indulged in
such a quantity of kind remarks about the Government, that the
Speaker had to tell him he was getting "unparliamentary, and Lord
Palmerston accused him of "not being a master of his own
language," which, as he talked the best of Billingsgate, was a rather
cruel cut.
Wednesday. In the Commons Mr. Cochrane wished to know if Mr.
Evelyn, "the fined old English gentleman," would, because of his
high character, be let off paying the £500 imposed for his late lark at
Guildford. Whereto SirCornewall Lewis replied, he had no doubt
of the High Sheriff's high character, but that was no apology for his
low behaviour. If he wanted to be let off, he should petition the
Home Secretary, and not bother the House; but his better plan would
be to make two notes in Evelyn's Diary: Mem. To fork out the Five
Hundred; and Mem. Don't insult a Judge again!
The Union of City Benefices Bill then came on for discussion, and
was eventually ordered to be reported, but actually not until no fewer
than fifty-nine short speeches had been made on it.
The House adjourned at 5'40, when the Government proceeded (by
a Citizen steamboat) to discuss by far the most important business of
the day:—viz., their annual Whitebait Peed at the Trafalgar Hotel,
Greenwich. Covers were laid for thirty; nearly all of whom remem-
bered that punctuality is the soul of dining; the only late arrival being
the Bight Hon. William Gladstone, who, it was supposed, had
been at work upon the Paper Duties, and who was greeted with a shout
of "0, Willie, we have missed you!" Mr. Punch was the only
favoured visitor invited, and occupied the post of honour at the right-
hand of the Chair. The dinner that was served was worthy of the
occasion, and so was Mr. Punch's appetite, which indeed but rarely
fails him when there is something good to eat. It was, however,
noticed that the bait were rather large; another penalty entailed by a
late Session on our senators, and which, it may be hoped, they will not
readily forget. The only toast worth recording was the health of Mr.
Punch; and this Lord Palmerston proposed in an elegant oration,
which Mr. Punch's modesty forbids him to report. Having gone into
Committee on the Provisional Expenses Bill, which was not laid upon
the table until rather a late hour, the Members of both Houses
adjourned to Mr. Punch's residence, where the sitting, like the Session,
had its end in smoke.
Thursday. Being up so late last night, both Houses adjourned early;
Lords knocking off at six, and Commons being actually Counted Out
at eight. But before they called their Hansoms, they passed the Bills
for Naval Discipline, and for Union of Benefices, and (in spite of Sir
G. Bowyer, who said that there was no morality in England now that
divorces had become as cheap a luxury as pine-apples) they read a
Second Time the Divorce Court Bill. Moreover, they found time for
lamenting with Lord Palmerston, that the Pasha of Egypt had been
sold by buying shares in the Suez Canal bubble; and they listened for
some minutes to Sir de Lacy Evans, who wants to see a biggish fort
or two stuck on Shooter's Hill, and if he gets them (as a tax-payer,
Punch wishes that he may!) will probably then ask to have the ditto
done for Primrose.
Friday. The Lord Chancellor brought in a Bill to repeal a heap
of-statutes which, although as old and obsolete as a Court of Justice
jokes, have by some slip only been "impliedly repealed." This Bill
he observed, would lop off a lot of useless limbs from the body of the
law, so that what is now so bulky will collapse into a moderate and
manageable size. His Lordship also called attention to the law
reforms which have been effected in the Session, and delivered an
affecting funeral oration upon such of his sixteen small legal children
as had died. Of these he specially lamented the fate of all his seven
little Criminal Innocents, who had been massacred most cruelly in the
other House.
At half-past six the Commons were again Counted Out, there being
only 3 and 20 Members present. This result was partly caused by some
curious remarks which were let fall by Sir George Bowyer, on the
subject of the doings of the hero Gabibaldi; whom, with singular
consistency he first of all denounced as an "unprincipled pirate," and
then fittingly belikened to that "patriotic" person, Tantia Topee!
Mr. Punch of course could not. stop to listen to such balderdash as
Bowyer's, and so shut up his note-book, and hailed the nearest
Hansom: an example which the Commons showed their Commons
sense by following.
SHOCKING LANGUAGE IN THE LORDS.
he House of Lords
may assert its pri-
vileges; but if it
wishes them to be
respected,! it must
maintain its state.
Bearing this maxim
in mind, let us exa-
mine the subjoined
remark, reported to
have been uttered
in the august assem-
bly above-named by
no less a person than
the President of
the Council. Is it
possible that Earl
Gbanville could
«•* have allowed the
common, popular,
mechanical, indeed I might almost say improper expression, contained va. these
words, to escape the enclosure of his Lordship's teeth P
"Tbe other Bouse had been stttlng for an unprecedented number of hours every day, and it
would not look very well for their Lordship to strike work five or six weeks before the end of the
Session (Oh, oh!)—well, at any rate, a good month."
"Well, indeed may the very ignoble idiom, employed by the noble Lord to
signify their Lordships' discontinuance of their legislative exertions, have excited,
in the superior House of Parliament, the unusual exclamation of 'Oh, oh!'
To speak of the cessation of labour as 'striking work' might not be astonishing
on the part of an individual of no rank or position in Society, addressing an
assembly of bricklayers; although indeed the adoption of the phrase would in that
case involve a peculiarly objectionable allusion. But are the functions of the

House of Peers to be degraded to a level with the manual
occupations of journeymen, by being characterised, and
that by a member of their own order, in language
borrowed from the workshop? In what stonemason's
yard did Lord Gbanville learn to represent the Peers
of the Realm as proposing to 'strike workP' His
phraseology was even less decorous than it would have
been if he had described them as intending to shut up
shop!
"Eabl Granville's mention of 'striking work' in
reference to noble Lords, was certainly calculated to elicit
ejaculations of remonstrance. But there is too much reason
to believe that the protest of 'Oh, oh!1 had a much less
lofty meaning, and was intended to express, not any dis-
approbation of the terms which the noble Earl condes-
cended to use, but, simply dissent from the statement
which those extremely vernacular terms served his Lord-
ship to convey. Where—as the late Mb. Liston might
have demanded—where is the dignity of recognising such
familiar forms of speech P Familiarity doth breed contempt,
and contempt will entail political extinction. What would
the great Lord Chatham have thought of speaking of
the House of Lords as ready to 'strike work P' He would
have probably fainted at the very idea, and thus have pre-
maturely afforded the subject which he furnished to the
pencil of Copley. At all events, before venturing to use
such an expression, he would undoubtedly have exchanged
the flowing and majestic wig of the statesman for the arti-
ficer's quadrangular and brown-paper cap. I have the
honour to be eternally yours,
"The Siibit of Sib Charles Grandison."
"P.S. Make allowance for the Medium through whom I
communicate, and correct my spelling."

A SPIRITED ATTACK.
BT A STBOKG MINDED ASSAILANT.
0 Mb. TuNCi!,—
"Accustomed as
you are to poke your
fun at the moat solemn
subjects (have you not
profanely cut your
jokes about the wide
dresses and weather,
and punned your very
worst upon a hundred
other matters, which
everybody else con-
siders anything but
laughing ones P) I am
not at all astonished at
the ribaldunbeliefwit h
which the mysteries
of Spirit-rapping have
been welcomed in
your columns. Scep-
ticism is so frequent a
resource of sluggish
minds, and to ridicule
is always so much
easier than to reason,
that nobody who knew
you expected you
would own yourself a
convert to a faith
which taxes to their
utmost our powers of
credulity. Instead of
volunteering to come and be convinced by the arguments which nightly are extracted from
our furniture, you hold yourself aloof in lazy disbelief, and refuse to let a Medium come
across your threshold.* You turn a deaf ear to the truths which are rapped out of our
tables, and when a spiritual enthusiast is lifted to the ceiling, you regard his elevation as
the height of imposition, and rank it among one of a conjurer's low tricks.
"I must, however, grant that you do not cram your scepticism down the public throat,
without adding now ana then a bit of sugar to the dose. You are not quite so one-sided as
are unbelievers generally, who when they choose to play Sir Oracle, allow no other dog to
bark. By admitting to your columns the interesting narrative of the! spirit-conversation of
the Bloater and the Rapper, you let your readers have some knowledge of the wonders which
are working, and gave them a fair chance of conversion to our faith. Although you
sceptically headed the narration 'Strange, if True,' you did not tamper with the facts that
were so lucidly described in it, but allowed them, in the majesty of all their grand momentous-
ness, to sink into the mind by the force of their own weight! For this you have my thanks,
Sir, and the thanks of every lover of justice and of truth. But as you seem to cast some
doubt upon the statement I refer to (every whit of which I need not say I thoroughly
believe), I should like to be the means of allaying yourjsuspicions, and convincing you that fish
can tali and sing as well as fly and swim. Of the first of these four facts I need cite no
further proof than the recent exhibition of the far-famed Talking Fish, whose premature
decease was almost nationally deplored. The second interesting truth is stated in these
words by Sir Emerson Tenner, to whom, as one of the distinguished patrons of its
grandmother, the Bloater in the narrative so feelingly referred:—
M I distinctly heard tho sounds in question. They camo up from tho water of Lako Chilka. in Ceylon,
like tho genlle thrills of a musical chord, or the fatut vibrations of a wineglass, when its rim is rubbed by a
wet fingtr. It was not one sustained note, but a multitude of tiny sounus, each clear and distinct in
itseli: tho swoetcst treble mingling with the lowest bass. On applying the ear to tho woodwork of tho boat,
the Tibration was greatly increased in volume by conduction. The sounds varied considerably at different
points, as we moved across the lake, as if tho nurubors of the animals from which they proceeded was greatest
in particular spots: and occasionally wo rowed out of hearing of thorn altogether, until on returning to tho
original locality tho sounds were at onco renewed.'*
• " Still further to prove the existence of these fish, which it appears are rot confined to the
waters of Ceylon, another eminent naturalist, Dr. Adams, tells us—
'* While in the brig Ariel, thon lying off the mouth oi tho river of Borneo, I had tho good fortuno «ear tho
solemn aquatic concert of tho far-famed organ-fish, or drum—a species of Pogonias. Theso singular fishes
produce a loud monotonous singing sound, which rises and falls and somotimoa dies away, or assumes a
very low drumming character: and the noiBes appeared to proceed mysteriously from the bottom of the
vessel. Tliis strange submarine chorus of fishes continued to amuse us for about a quarter of an hour, when
the music, if so it can be called, suddenly ceased, probably on tho dispersion of tho band of performers."
"Sir, the statements of these naturalists are, to my mind, quite as strange as the tales of
supernaturalists,nhic\i, instead of crediting, you hold in sad contempt. Dr. Adams says that
he has heard a singing fish, and you believe him. Your narrator says the same thing, and
you disbelieve him 1 In the name of common sense and common justice, why is this P
Why doubt that there are singing-fish existent here in England as well as in Ceylon?
Suaksteare speaks of calling spirits from the 'vasty deep,' and is not this, Sir, I would
ask, the clearest proof that he believed in their marine existence? and will you, Sir, dare to
pit your knowledge against his, and cast your grovelling doubts upon the grand truths he
* This Is not tho fact. Madam, Mr. Fuuch lias moro than once said that he should bo most happy lo see any
of those gentlemen (or ladles) at his official residence. lie will likewise bo delighted to sec tbcm go through
what ho still must persist to call their " tricks," on condition that ho really it aUcwcd to see them ; but, as
believed in? Sir, the story of the Singing
Bloater, as narrated in your columns, may have
possibly seemed 'Strange' to you, but there
cannot be a shadow of a doubt tuat it is 'True.'
And if, after all the pains I have taken to con-
vert, you, you still question if a herring can be
really heard to sing by a person who is under
the influence of spirits, come and take a cup of
tea with me, and let my Medium box your ears
for you, and I '11 wager that you '11 hear a most
decidedjsinging in them.

"AND SO SAY ALL OF US."
In the Lord Mayor's Court, a few days since,
an action peculiarly fit, to be adjudicated on by
that tribunal, was tried before the Recorder
and a Common Jury. It was brought by Mn.
William Sawyer, the landlord of the London,
at the corner of Chancery Lane, against M R.
Jervis, a barrister, and Treasurer of an Insti-
tution called the Social Club, to recover
£14 6s. llrf. for a supper had at the Loudon
in December, 1859. In the.report of the case it
is stated that—
"Thirty-throe sat down to supper, and they maftaged
to dis|>ose of no less than thiriy-eighf crown bowls of
punch, besides beer and wine and spirits, for which tliey
paid at the time. There were also items for pipes,
tobacco, aud broken glass, which were not disputed."
The Social Club is described as composed
of "members of the bar, military officers,
merchants, and gentlemen." They are
stated to have "proceeded with their merri-
ment and enjoyment until four o'clock in the
morning."
The item for broken glass in Mr. Sawveb's
account was probably very considerable. Thirty-
eight crown bowls of punch alone, imbibed by
thirty-three persons, might be expected to in-
volve a very large breakage of that fragile
article. Add to all that punch an indefinite
quantity of wine, beer, and spirits, and the result
will in any case probably be the comminution
of every vitreous aud fictile vessel on the table,
and indeed iu the room. On the occasion in
question the crown bowls most likely went, as
well as their contents, and it was a mercy if no
cracked crowns, as well as cracked bowls, were
the consequence. The charge for broken glass
was wisely not disputed—it was no doubt indis-
putable. It would be satisfactory to know that
glass vessels were the only tumblers that sus-
tained any damage on this festive occas

Piscator. "Oho! This is the'place -where the big Trout are, is it? Then this is the sokt or FLY, I think!"
THE WARNING OF THE WHiTEBAIT.
In th' Arabian Nighli Enteriainmentt,
Is a tale of a little fish talking,
And though such piscatorial attainments
May be nothing to tables a-walking,
And Mediums revealing themselves at the ceiling,
Pulled up, through unlicensed and grave spirit-dealing,
And arm-chairs up ottomans stalking—
And though he who wishes to hear vocal fishes—
If we credit Sib Emebson Tennent,
Needn't seek them in magic Egyptian dishes,
Nor beneath Mendez Pinto's broad pennant—
But in Chilka's fair lake may hear the fish make
A concert at dusk, which for rhyme's urgent sake,
May best be described as "turprenani."
Still one can't quite expect to be heard with respect,
When one states that on Ma. Habt's premises,
There've been cases of Whitebait—served up as the right bait,
To a party who'd just steamed down Thamesis—
Giving vent to discourse full of logic and force,
Though such tales we accept as mere matters of course
In the regions once ruled o'er by Rameses.
Yet this, I've heard tell, very lately befell,
In the course of that Cabinet dinner.
Which is held when the Session—with languid progression,
And House growing thinner and thinner,—
O'er Saharas of speeches, that Pisgah-point reaches,
Whence the green land of leisure tired statesmen beseeches,
To enter and take up possession.
For this feast, as all know, the Cabinet go
To Greenwich, and every dish is
(From the carp, souchd stewed in. to Cabinet pudding)
Emblematic of loaves and of fishes;
But flounders and plaice are forbidden, in case
Of their prompting a pun to some blunderer's face—
An omission that's highly judicious.
The initiate assure us that Cabinet jollity,
As displayed with discreetly-closed doors.
If you measure by quantity rather than quality,
Unofficial facetiousness floors.
And through key-holes and chinks oose out hints of high jinks,
When official reserve at wild rollicking winks,
And the soul red-tape's band over-soars.
'Twas just—in the dinner of Wednesday last,—
As the fun to this maximum drew—
When the mirth ministerial wax'd furious and fast,
And e'en Lewis was almost warm'd through;
While Pam slapp'd Gladstone's back, Lowe hailed Russell
as "Jack.,*'
And Argyll tickled Bethell in playful attack,
And Soherset courteous grew—
The Whitebait—course first—had gone round, and the burst
Of voracity drew to a pause,
When, an extra-sized fish from the half-emptied dish
Expanded its sore-battered jaws,
With a "List, list, oh, list! "—and in ev'ry fist
Knife and fork hung suspended, hairs slowly uprist,

"Broil ye not in your shame! shades of Ude and Cabeme!
With the pang that your spirits must own.
To see thus shovelled down wretched Whitebait done brown,
Of dimensions till this year unknown!

"In the House week by week, it was still speak, speak, speak;
Ev'ry ill had its measure, but talk;
And Bill after Bill, howe'er puff'd, turned out ill,—
What the House could not bungle, 't would baulk.
There sat Bunkum, enthroned in Reform a la Russell;
Ambition, in Gladstone-Finance; Bounce and Bustle
Incarnate in Bethell did stalk.

TIT-BITS FROM THE "TABLET"
ometimes a dig into the Tablet
Roman Catholic newspaper will
reward the humorous explorer
with many absurdities. Subjoined
are a few gems of precious quality
and various kind, derived, all of
them, from the mine formed by the
last number of that wonderful
journal. The first, to be sure,
occurs in a letter from Rome,
quoted from the Cork Examiner.
It relates to the "Pope's Own;"
the soldiers of the Irish Brigade
in Rome; of whom its author thus
reports:—
"I can say that one ia struck by their
religious attitude, not a nominal but a
genuine one fsono religiosi non di nome
ma di opera)."
These Irish arc, of course, en-
thusiastic papists. The religious
attitude of such devotees is very
peculiar. An idea of it may be
obtained by an inspection of the
pictures of saints exhibited in the
windows of Roman Catholic book-
shops. _ Many of the canonised
gentlemen and ladies are delineated praying with twisted necks or
dislocated limbs, in quite miraculous postures. One species of the
religious attitude displayed by those pious but grotesque personages
is that of ogling a skull, another that of making an obeisance to an
image precisely similar to the curtsey which ballet-dancers are accus-
tomed to drop before pachas and princes, apparently meaning, "See
how submissive I am, and at the same time how very interesting and
pretty I look." Considering this last variety of the religious atti-
tude in question, one might almost suppose that a joke was intended
by the statement that the Pope's Irish soldiers are religious "non di
nome ma di opera."
The next good thing lies in 'the simplicity with which the desire
quoted verbally in the following piece of foreign intelligence is treated
as something extraordinary:—
■
At one of the late public feasts in Hodena, the astonished population read the
inscribed by the scholars on a brilliant transparency:—" Vog-

following inscription
liamo la vera Religions senza Papa e
either Pope or Priesta."'
i Protl.'—' We wish true Religion without
As if this wish were a very unreasonable or very novel one.
Finally the Tablet treats us to the ensuing outbreak, in which a
remarkable strength of language will perhaps be considered to be
curiously blended with a corresponding weakness in every other respect
but that of bigotry :—
"Wo are not prepared to deny that there may be a diabolical cunning and an
infernal sagacity iu the policy pursued by which Natoleon the Third has been
outbidden and overreached, and by which the Italian revolution, unchained by him
for his own selfish purposes, has been converted into a danger and a difficulty lor
him from which it is hard to discover any means of escape."
Grant that the policy of wishing the deliverance of Italy from caps
of silence, noisome dungeons, bastinado, hot-bottomed chairs, and
Bourbonic and Austrian rule which rests on these appliances, together
with papal domination, which is allied with that of Bourbon and Haps-
burg, is diabolical and infernal. Admit that the policy is altogether
infernal and diabolical, still where is the cunning of it P Did England
ever make a secret of its desire to see the pontifical despotism and the
absolute monarchy of Naples abolished P Is it particularly cunning, at
least, to go about roaring "No Popery!" or chalking that popular
exclamation up openly on the walls? Infernal straightforwardness and
diabolical downrightness are the sins of which the Tablet should accuse
British policy. Our outrageous contemporary perhaps regards as a
master-stroke of diabolical cunning on the part of Loud Palmerston
and Lord John Russell the Government's connivance at the enlist-
ment of the poor Paddies who went out to fight the Pope's battles for
a consideration which proved to be "monkey's allowance," and who
have returned wiser and leaner men, and ragamuffias more squalid than
they were when they started. This result the Tablet may believe to
have been contrived by the Ministry with the diabolically cunning
and infernally sagacious view of destroying the confidence of the
faithful Irish in their priesthood, and thus as it were diminishing the
verdure of Erin, or opening the eyes of Hibernia and abating the green
in them.

A GEM FROM THE EMERALD ISLE.
Redundancies in writing are not considered elegant: and in
advertisements especially they are to be avoided, for unnecessary words
are not printed without cost. Had the writer of the following borne
this fact in mind, he would not have afforded us a laugh at his expense,
which luxury we enjoyed on Thursday the 9th ultimo :—
TNQUIRY.—D. A. S., late of Dublin, is earnestly requested, by his
-»- Irish correspondent in Paris, to WRITE (if living), regardless oi circumstances,
20th of June being long sinco passed.
There is something so Hibernian in requesting that a person will
please to write "if living," that the advertiser scarcely need have said
that he was " Irish," the fact being quite patent from the two words
introduced. Whether these two words cost the writer something
extra, we need not waste our space in endeavouring to guess: but if
they did, he will at least have this great consolation, that without them
what he wrote would not have gained a place in Punch.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[September 1, 18G0.

FROM OUR COCKNEY CORRESPONDENT.
"Fort, August, 20M.
0 my request to be kind enough
to allow me a holiday, dear
Mr. Punch, you obligingly re-
plied, 'Oh, be off;' and added
that in consideration of my long
and invaluable services, you
would gladly defray all the
expenses of my endeavours to
recruit the health wasted in
your service,* so I feel myself
bound to send you a few flying
notes of my journey.
"Having never been out of
London before in all my life
(except on occasion of a single
visit to Gravesend, when I
suffered so severely from sea-
sickness, that I resolved never
again to tempt the billowy
ocean) my letters may be the
more valuable to you, because
they will convey the fresh and
vivid impressions made upon a
young, enthusiastic, and intel-
ligent individual, who is not a
Blazey, as the French say. I do not affect to suppose that I shall cast
a new light upon the condition of England; no person but my gifted
friend the Editor of the Morning Advertiser can make himself thoroughly
acquainted with a country during a run across it in a railway carriage;
but I trust that the navetey of my sketches may atone for their
possible want of originality.
"At present, Sir, I am in York, which you are aware is an ancient
and celebrated city in Yorkshire, the see of an Archbishop, and the
Deanery of a DeaD, to whom, because he was already a very rich gen-
tleman, the Church authorities have given a wry large increase of
income. Into the history of York I do not know that it is necessary
for me to enter at any length, but I think it right to state that the
sanatory reformers have a good deal to do there—comparisons are
odorous, Shakspeare says, and I should think that there must be a
good many comparisons in York, although there is no comparison
between its Cathedral and anything in London or Gravesend.
"But, Sir, what has astonished me most, is the extreme inaccuracy
of the ideas which I—and I suppose thousands of other inhabitants of
the Metropolis—have been accustomed to entertain in respect of the
Yorkshire people and their habits. I have been accustomed to visit
the theatres a good deal, Mr. Punch, and we all know that the stage
holds the mirror up to Nature. Well, Sir, wishing to compare the
verities of Nature with the transcripts of Art, I took the earliest oppor-
tunity of placing myself upon a bridge which forms the principal
thoroughfare of York. Here, Sir, with a note-book in my hand, and a
pleasant smile on my face, I prepared to be amused, but in a kindly
way, with the sterling honesty and rough humour which so delights us
in the mimic scene. In order to give the Yorkshireman the oppor-
tunity of developing his nature, I accosted the first who seemed likely
to bo a good specimen of his race. He was a tall, stalwart, broadfaced,
powerful fellow.
"Your Corretpondent. This is indeed a noble city, my friend, inte-
resting in its archaeological features, which present so remarkable a
combination of Pagan and Catholic type; and favoured in its locality,
which enables it at once to invite agricultural and mercantile contri-
butions to its prosperity.
"Yorkshire Individual. Ay, it be a main foine place, but to my moind
the foinest thing about it loike be the honest hearts that beat beneath
the bosoms of its sons, and that lift 'em as high as yon Minster above
aught that is debasing and degrading, mun.
At least, Mr. Punch, that is what I expected him to say, with a
slap on his waistcoat. I regret to add, however, that what he said
"'* Thee be dom'd !»
"And that what he did was, to shove your correspondent into the
gutter, and walk on without the least allusion to the latter's being a
strauger, to whom it be our duty to show koindness like, if he bain't
too proud to accept the humble fare of the honest peasant, whose roof
may be lowly, but who would bend to no haughty lord that ever hid
his head in his spangled coronet.
"But we must not judge of a whole county by a single individual,
and having witnessed upon the stage the frank and hearty hospitality
of the Yorkshireman, and being moreover uncommonly thirsty, I
crossed the bridge, and observing through an open window a family
* It Li hardly necessary for us to say, that no such ridiculous recoiraition or pre
posturous prorako over escaped us. Our reply terminated at " be off."—Ed. Punch.
at their early dinner I approached, and putting my head in, said,
gaily :—
"' I am a stranger in these parts, and have travelled far, and am
hungry and thirsty. Need I say more f'
The Paterfamilias, a very respectable looking person, rose from the
table, and I expected to hear him exclaim,
"' Coom in, mun, what dost stood there talking for—eat and drink
first, and talk after if thee be so minded, but do not wrong the warm-
hearted Yorkshireman by utterin' a doubt like whether all he have be
not at the wayfarer's service. Dom it, Sarah, stick feyther's old
chair for the gentleman.'
"But I am sorry to say that instead of this, he approached the
window, and pointing across the road, said,
"' Yon will find excellent hotel accommodation at that house, Sir.'
"And he closed, the window so rapidly, that if I had not drawn back
my head with considerable speed, I should have been guillotined.
"Still, I resolved to make another attempt, and entertaining (as
you are aware that I do entertain) a very favourable opinion of the
female sex, I determined that I would next ascertain how far the stage
portraiture of the Yorkshire girl resembled the original. So I walked
up Micklegate to the Bar (where the heads of the Duke of York and
the young 1)okb of Rutland were placed; but I suppose they have
been removed, as I could see no traces of them), and meeting a pretty,
rosy-faced, dark-eyed girl (whose hat I must say was uncommonly
like any lady's bat in Oxford Street), I began, smilingly,—
"' I am a stranger in these parts, my pretty lass, but where such
bright eyes and such ruby lips are found, I am sure that gentleness
and kindness must reign supreme, and the stranger may dispel his
terrors.'
"The young lady looked at me for a moment, and did not seem to
know what to say. So I went on, as I have heard Mb, John Cooper
do in a score of comedies of English manners.
"' Doubtless, fair one, you were expecting a more welcome arrival—
nay, never let the blush of shame mantle on thy cheeks for an honest
attachment, and sure am I that no other could be inspired by those
dear eyes. Tell me, is it Hobin, or Lubin, for whom tby minutes lag
so heavily f'
"Well, Sir, why did she not say, as she ought to have said, taking
up the corner of her apron, and looking down,—
"Oh, Sir—I assure you—but will you not, if a stranger, come into
my mother's cottage, and rest in the old arm-chair—we have no dainties,
but if a dish of cream, and strawberries of my own gathering can
tempt you, they will be welcome as the flowers of May diamonded
with jew.'
"And at least, Sir, if she could not say that, she needed not to have
said to a great policeman, B. 54, an exact fac simile of a London
Bobby, only bigger—
"' This person is annoying me.'
"And why did that stupid and powerful owl walk me off, despite all
my clamour, to the police-station, whence I was not delivered until
late in the evening, and then through the good offices of the landlord
of my hotel, who got me out, civilly enough, but would not
in the least believe my story, and who, when he had taken my eager
orders for supper, went out of the room, saying, slily,—
"'This isn't London, you know, Sir.'
"Confound it, Mr. Punch, I knew it was not London, but neither
was it Yorkshire, so far as 1 had been taught. I begin to think these
play-writing people are humbugs.
Bain is falling—not so the esteem in which you are held by
"Your devoted servant, and
"Mr. Punch." "Cockney Correspondent."
SMITH O'BRIEN'S CONVICTION.
The Morning News, Irish paper, publishes a letter, addressed to
"Monsieur Marie Martin, Pans, thanking that Frenchman for
his pamphlet on La Question Irlandaise, and for the complimentary
language which accompanied the present thereof. In conclusion, the
writer assures M. Martin of "the existence of a disposition on the
part of the Irish people to appreciate his desire to champion then-
rights and to defend their character;" adding:—
"Such being my conviction, I venturo in their name to thank you for your past
labours in their cause. I have the honour to be yours, very faithfully,
*• William 8. O'Briek."
Mr. Smith O'Brien's conviction was a conviction for High Treason,
for which he was not hanged by a contemptuous mercy which appears
to have greatly affronted him. In corresponding with an enemy of the
United Kingdom, the captive of the cabbage-garden appears desirous
of showing what a mistake was made by the Queen's Government.

MS. SPURGEON'S TOUR ON THE CONTINENT.
Mr dear friends and hearers, who, constant appearers
In this Tabernaole, are purposed, I trust,
Me long to sit under, whenever I thunder,
Who to build up these walls have come down with the dust,
To edification my peregrination
Would tend, if related, you seem to Buppose,
I omitted to book it, ps easy I took it,
But some few rough sketches to give you—here goes!
For Antwerp from London, in health somewhat undone,
I started, attended by many a friend,
I say that I started, but we were soon parted.
Because my companions left me at Gravesend.
Of blessings a cargo—thereon no embargo—
Did freight the steam-packet that bore us away;
An Essex man Captain, rich anecdote apt in,
We kept telling tales to each other all day.
At Antwerp we landed, and when we commanded
A view of the noble Cathedral, behold,
Out came a procession—perhaps from confession—
Of peasants and priests holding candles—large mould.
The consumption of tallow intended to hallow
The festive occasion was truly immense;
Some lamps, too, were bearing; the sun meanwhile flaring,
But when folks burn daylight their darkness is dense
Now Antwerp's a city which we can but pity,
Though some for its wondrous religion extol,
Full of carved Virgin Maries; and each of them varies
From a Queen on her throne to a little black doll.
In each street and alley presides this Aunt Sally
Over shops; and a tar of the true British type
Declared, honest Jack, he bad purchased his 'backy
At a shop where the Virgin sat smoking her pipe!
Our vessel exported a gang, ill-assorted,
Of Irish, to serve in the Papal brigade,
And thanks to their sender, and skipper, I tender,
For such a lot out of the country conveyed.
Their luggage was lighter than e'er loaded fighter,
They had one pocket handkerchief—there the list stops—
The Captain well prized them—thus characterised them—
He said "they were not fit to out up for mops."
Such tatterdemalions to thrash the Italians,
Oh, doesn't the Pontiff just wish he may get?
His guards to be guarded will have, or discarded;
I never beheld such a beautiful set.
May Ireland's brave nation soon find occupation
More noble than propping a rotten old throne,
Which stands but to crumble; I pray it may tumble,
And brave Garibaldi o'erthrow the "Pope's Own."
Some things I can't mention repelled my attention,
Exposed in that Catholic Antwerp for sale;
But I found a strong feeling all Belgium revealing
'Gainst Louis Napoleon; a symptom I hail.
Our ties are more German: 1 heard a good sermon
At Brussels, all hough it was preached by a priest.
Men smoking, toil shirking, I saw women working:
If their husbands they whacked, they'd have my leave at least.
Cologne, so high is it, I '11 never revisit;
Such smells insupportable poison the air.
Than the eye more the nose is affected, with roses
By no means, but quite with another thing there.
Each yard still excelling the last in vile smelling,
As onward I travelled—1 don't know of what—
I had ne'er before smelt it, severely I felt it,
I cannot say whether't was Pop ry or not.
At experience aiming, I witnessed the gaming
At Baden; ne'er saw a more terrible sight.
At rouge-et-noir playing, their precious souls slaying.
Why even the women there sit up all night I
Oh! none of you gamble, for if, in the scramble,
You lose, serve you right, 'tis still worse if you've woa;
For in that case Old Harry the winnings will carry
Away with the winner, as sure as a gun.
THE FLIGHT OF THE EAGLE OP NAPLES.
No wonder Aqtjila flies to his brother Eagle at Paris. Society in
Paris, we hear, is rotten—and "where the carcase is," there we know
"The Eagles will be gathered together."
A HORSE-CARPET FOR KENSINGTON GARDENS
The petition against the new horse-ride in Kensington Gardens has
received the signatures of so many pedestrian snobs that it extends to
the length of half a mile. Horse Cowpee—as the originator of the
equestrian improvement in question deserves to be entitled for his
chivalry—should show the wretches whose plebeian names are affixed
to that mean parochial document at what a price he estimates them,
their opinions, and wishes, by causing it to be unrolled and laid down
along the tract of beautiful soft mud into which he is turning what
was formerly mere turf, between the Round Pond and the Palace.
The petition would be so nice for the horses' feet; and in trampling
thereupon, by an aot of graceful defiance, Mr. Cowter and the 'Ossy
party will, wit h a pardonable ostentation, indicate that they have got
the ridiculous admirers of "beauty and repose" under their hoofs.

THE GENTS OF THE PRESS.
Writers for the newspapers are called in common parlance the
Gentlemen of the Press. There are, however, some among them who,
if they had their rights, would more properly be known as the No
Gentlemen of the Press. These "parties " care but little for their duty
to their neighbour, and can no more keep their pens from lying and
from slandering, than they can keep their ears from eavesdropping and
their eyes from kej holes. They are no respecters of persons or mahog-
anies, and whenever they accept a private invitation, it is with the
intention to make public use of anything that happens to' occur. If
their memory should fail, they have recourse to their invention, and as
they have to please the palate of a morbid class of readers, who are
without a healthy appetite for wholesome literary food, they season
what they scribble with a spice of gross impertinence, and are
rather apt to flavour it with a sprinkling of scandal, and a aoupfon of
grot set.
To show the estimation in which the labours of these literary
"gents" are held, we cite the following extract from a letter by Mr.
Cobden, who has personally had reason to complain of what they
write:—
"The paragraph you enclosed, giving a conversation o mine, is one of those
rascally acta of caves-dropping for which Amorican newspaper writers are so noto-
rious. There is a good deaf of the paragraph which agrees with what I have
thought; but whether I expressed it in private conversation is more than I could
swear to, as no one expects to be made responsible for private gossip. There ought
to be tho punishment of the pillory or the stocks revived for those who publish in
newspapers the ungual dod remarks which fall from a man in private conversation,
when he frequently speaks morely to provoke a reply and keep people from going
to sleep over too serious an interchange of views."
If we remember rightly, Mr. Cobden used to stick up for the
Yankee press-wrights, and declare that their cheap papers were far
better than our dear ones. But Mr. Cobden has seen reason to alter
his opinion, and now acknowledges that cheapness is sometimes found
in union with that which is not nioeness. In this era of refinement
there is little hope of clapping scandalmongers in the stocks; but
Mr. Punch's public pillory will always be found open for any literary
blackguard who deserves to be exposed in it.

STARTLING INTELLIGENCE.
We have been for some weeks daily startled out of some of our five
senses by the sight of a small paragraph in big type in the Times, which
every morning occupies a most conspicuous position, and cannot fail to
catch the eye of constant readers like ourselves in glancing down the
page. The paragraph flits dodgily about the inner sheet; now appearing
just at the ena of the last leader, and anon being inserted at the close
of the Court Circular, or with the maniacal returns of conscience
money to the Exchequer, or as a tit-bit to wind up the very Latest
Intelligence. Our interest and excitement are thus artfully kept up,
for we cannot always at a glimpse recognise our old acquaintance, as
we might do were it always printed in one place. We therefore every
morning seize upon it witn avidity, expecting to discover a most
interesting announcement, such for instance, let us say, as any one of
these:—
We rejoice to slate the fact, that Garibaldi has stormed Naples,
and has taken Bomba prisoner. The Royal miscreant is now in one of
his own dungeons, and will be beheaded (it is hoped) on Monday next.
We are requested to announce that the Earl op Derby is now
staying with his old friend Mr. Bright, and that Lord Palmerston
will join them in the course of a few days. The meeting of these three
statesmen is a political arrangement, of which a new Reform Bill is
said to be the base.
It alarms us to have learned that the Emperor of the French has
completed his arrangements for invading England, and the ceremony
will come oif in the middle of next week. The troops will simulta-
neously effect an unmolested landing at Portsmouth, Dover, Plymouth,
Jobno Groat's House, and Sheemess; and after having devastated the
outlying districts, will at once proceed together to demolish Windsor
Castle, and then march on the Metropolis, which they intend to sack.
We believe that we may state, without much fear of contradiction,
that Viscount Williams is engaged in completing a big blue book,
showing how many cheeseparings he has this year saved the nation,
and what amount of loaves and fishes have been wasted by the Govern-
ment since they first came into place.
It charms us to announce that Mr. Cobden is preparing a new
Treaty of Commerce, whereby the Emperor will pledge himself to
general disarmament; provided ouly that, to show him our intentions
are pacific, we first disband our Army, sink our Navy, and disarm our
Volunteers.
We are requested to make known the highly interesting fact, that
Mr. Punch, who is about to complete his Thousandth Number, is making
splendid preparations for this national event. Without undue divulging
the secrets of the press, it may be confidently prophesied, that this
his Thousandth effort will far exceed in every estimable quality the
nine hundred and ninety and nine which have so happily preceded it.
Instead of some such startling pieces of intelligence, only just con-
ceive how disappointing it has been to discover only this:—
"Wo beg to inform our readers that The Times may now be purchased at all
railway stations in England and Wales where newspapers are sold at the prict of
fourpence per copy. Travellers who are unable to obtain Ihe Timet on demand will
oblige us by making immediate complaint to the publisher."
Without presuming in the least to dictate to our contemporary, or
interfering in the slightest with its business arrangements, may we not
just drop the bint, that however vastly interesting this statement may
nave been when it was first put forward, it has now rather lost its
freshness, and is becoming mere stale news P Moreover, now that we
have given it insertion in our columns, we have of course secured for
it a world-wide circulation, and there can therefore be no longer the
least need to repeat it.
Another Rap at the Rapiers.—One of those humbugs who are
called "Mediums" has been heard to express a fear that, in conse-
quence of the attacks which have been made on it by Punch, the
business of a Spirit-rapper will be soon not worth a rap.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

Tuesday. August 2S. At last the weary Session, which like a wounded snake,
had been dragging its slow lengtli along since January the Twenty-fourth,
was this day put an end to by Protector Punch, to whom the labour was
confided of proroguing the Long Parliament. The ceremony took place at a
little after two, in the presence of ten Ladies, three Bishops, and eight Lords,
flanked by a scant sprinkling of the ever faithful Commons. This enumeration
will serve to show what interest was taken in the proceedings, which were
fraught as usual with the most intense excitement.
Upon arriving at the House, Protector Punch was formally conducted
through the Commons, and observing there were actually forty Members
present, he elegantly complimented them upon their courage, in being seen in
London on the twenty-eighth of August Forties ereantur forlibus," said he.
as he good-humouredly shook hands with the juvenescent Premier, and
whispered something about Nestor looking like Narcissus.
Coming to the Woolsack, the Protector who had put on the big wig of
the Lord Chancellor (which Lady Judy said became him charmingly, and he
therefore felt quite proud in it; although, not being used to wear it, he found
the horsehair mould tickle his ears), in the U3ual manner signified the Royal
Assent to exactly fifty bills; counting them upon his fingers to make quite
sure they were all right, and that he Bad not by some accident dropped one in
his journey from Balmoral down to Fleet Street. Then amid the breathless
silence of the House, the Protector'Punch proceeded in his usual silver
accents, as Hbr Majesty's Commissioner, to spout this Gracious Speech:—
"My Lords, and you Gentlemen, too, of the Commons,
Pray lend me your ears; as to Mark did the Romans;
We come the misdeeds of the Session to bury,
To praise it, methinks, were preposterous, very.
'Twas a Session of fussing, of talking, not working,
Real business all shelving, and promises shirking;
And though I may speak on't as 'long and laborious,'
In such strenua inertia there's little that's glorious.
"To begin my stale news, I am happy to state
That my friends are all friendly, both small ones and great •
France, Russia, and Prussia, and Norway and Swede
(Of our runaway rascals, which latter is the den),
Holland, Austria, Turkey, and Belgium, and Spain
(Whose people, tho' free, still in bond age remain),
In fact all the Powers are peaceful I hope,
Excepting young Bomba, and p'raps that old Pope;
Little wonder that o'er them the battle-cloud lours,
For such weak silly fools can be hardly called Powers.
Far more worthy the name is the brave Gariball-i,
Who is dealing the death which all tyrannies shall die;
Right well he makes head, e'en his worst friends must own,
And the best tee can do is to 'let well alone.'
(Cross the Channel, I trust, will be wafted this hint
Though the 'Boot' may pinch Bomba, Nap's foot is not in't).
"I own I've scant love for those tatterdemalians,
Who send us our organ-fiends, Northern Italians;
But I must say it caused me a moment's vexation
To see through the trick of their late annexation.
Yet now the deed's done, the best course to pursue
Is to register simply that it was a doo.
"Of the Syrian slaughters 1 have heard with great grief,
And. with just indignation, have sent quick relief;
With Austria, and Prussia, and Russia, and France
I have joined, to the Sui.tan some troops to advance,
Whereby of the Christians the terrors to end,
And the dastardly Druses to Hades to send.
"Another small matter I have for regret,
Viz.:—My China account is not quite settled yet.
That the Chinese care little for music 'tis clear,
To my overtures lately they turned a deaf ear;
As in harmony, therefore, to live they refuse,
I must see whether discord will long suit their views.
With the French, a few instruments lately I've sent,
Which will make these rash Pigtails their deafness repent—
One or two eighty-pounders, from Armstrong's dark caves,
Will rather astonish the minds of the 'Braves;'
And I fancy ere long, as our force there increases,
If she don't sue for peace you'll find China in pieces.
"Coming now to home subjects,-1 say to your faces,
Your conduct in Parliament quite a disgrace is:
In a jiffy I'll count up the work that you've got done,
Rather longer 'twould take me to tell what you've not doue.
You have made a French Treaty; you've voted Supplies;
At legal abuses you've had some small shies:
And to show you're at peace now with all foreign nations,
You've passed a small Bill for some fortifications.
You've united my forces in India at length,
And I trust that the act will show ' Union is Strength:'
Irish landlord and tenant you've placed on fair footing,
So I hope we shall hear of no more landlord shooting;
You have smashed party Emblems: and after long trying,
You have saved little children when bleaching from dy(e)ingj
Relief you have granted to Catholic charity,
Which, tho' Sfooner thinks otherwise, is not a rarity;
You've amended the law touching banks for Small Savings,
(Still for further amendment I own I've great cravings);
Naval Discipline too you have taken in hand,
And made it more easy to get my ships manned:
The Cat's the chief hindrance, half an eye can see that;
But more 'care' for my men must ere long ' kill the Cat.'
"Thus in few words I've summed up the year's legislation,
And shown what odd jobs you have done for the nation;
But your strenuous idleness, as I've declared,
Has Dut kept you at work that you well might have spared.
Half the Session, and more than two weeks of the Grouse,
You have wasted in talk of Reforming the House;
While the wisest of measures, there can't be a doubt of it,
Were to turn all the talkative Members clean out of it!
For which sensible hint thank my friend with the hunch,
I need surely not name him—you know I mean Punch!
"Now for pleasanter themes. I am happy to say
That my boy is in Canada making a stay,
And there taking such steps (you have heard of his dancing)
As prove in the right path that he is advancing;
Indeed, such is his conduct, it must be allowed of him,
That his Mother has every right to feel proud of him.
"And not less deserving my high commendation
Is my Volunteer Army; whose organisation,
Both on leaders and men, hath great credit reflected,
For they've both done their duty, as England expected;
And have made so remote the bare chance of invasion
That no shade of alarm it need henceforth occasion.
"Now, good-bye; and go home to your children and wives,
And show them your taste for home comfort survives.
Give an eye to your farms, and your tenants, and neighbours,
And let care for the poor be not least of your labours.
You '11 not get much shooting;—the birds are all drowned;
But the means of time-slaughter may elsewhere be found:
There are schools to erect—there are horses to t

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 8, 18C0.
There are commons, and criminals, too, to reclaim;
There are oak-trees to plant; there are poachers to catch;
• There are poor lands to drain; there are poor roofs to thatch;
At law-framing moreover your hands you may try,
(Pick a wet day for that, as the work|s rather dry).
I'd say more, but I see you are wanting your lunch,
So to sum up—Mind weekly you study your Punch /
If you want good advice, that's the shop to afford it ye:
So my Lords, Vos Falete! I need not add, Plaudite!"
At the conclusion of The Speech, Protector Punch received the
thanks and gratulations of Both Houses on being happily released from
the labours of his Essence. After this affecting ceremony, the Pro-
tector flung his big wig at the head of the Lokd Chancellor, and
went to watch the Lower boys pack up for the holidays; where he
was mightily amused at seeing little Johnny Russell make a terribly
wry face, because Pam wouldn't let him take his old Reform Bill hobby-
horse to play with. When the last cab had departed, the Protector
locked the doors, and put the keys into his pocket; thereby showing
he had read History, and was not too proud to imitate his namesake.
Then after bonneting a small boy who happened to be staring at him,
he hailed a special Hansom, and flew away upon the wings of love—a
poetical expression for the fastest express train—to join the Grouse
and Judy.

FROM OUR COCKNEY CORRESPONDENT.
To Mr. Punch.
"Drumnadrochit Inn,
"Sir, *' Inverness-shire, Scotland.
"I addressed you last from the interesting, though misun-
derstood regions of Yorkshire. I now write to you from the Highlands.
The inn whence these lines are dated faces a scene which happily is not
too often to be observed in this planet. I say happily. Sir, because we
are all perfectly well aware that this world is a Vale of Tears, in which
it is our duty to mortify ourselves, and make everybodyelse as uncom-
fortable as possible. If there were many places like Drumnadrochit,
persons would be in fearful danger of forgetting that they ought to be
miserable. The most glorious scenery, Mr. Punch, here surrounds a
most delightful inn, and an inn, Sir, where not only are you made
thoroughly comfortable, but where (unlike the vast majority of Scottish
hotel-keepers) your kindhearted Landlady does not endeavour to
revenge Flodden upon us English by charges as tremendous as those
we made, upon that glorious day, on the army of King James the
Fourth. Your health, Sir, in a dram.
"From York, Sir, to Drumnadrochit, is a considerable distance, and
inasmuch as I have been receiving for the last week every kind of
Scotch hospitality, and also every kind of Scotch information, it is
possible that the notes I have been able to make may not convey very
precise notions to your mind. I own to being in a Paradisaical
muddle. Still, I have done my best, and have struggled up against the
influence both of the Tumbler and the Eke, to write down facts for
you, after retiring, (with slight assistance from my hosts) to my
sleeping chamber. I can but transcribe those notes for you, being far
too much occupied with fishing, theological discussion, and other
diversions, to attempt anything like style. Your health, Sir, in a dram.
"I say then, Sir, that the harvest is in better condition than the
English one, and the strawberries I got at Aberdeen, which is built ol
granite and celebrated for strawberries (also Dugald Dalgellie was
educated at the Marischal College) were very fine indeed. As to the
vexed question between the Highlanders and their landlords, and the
clearings away of the population, there seems to be a good deal to say
on both sides, only the fact is certain that the Highland population is
increasing, and not diminishing, and that if you eat the salmon at once
while it is firm and curdy it is perfectly delicious. Duncan was not
murdered by Macbeth in Cawdor Castle, and the latter reigned
seventeen years, and was killed at Lumphanan, in A berdeenshire, and
Duncan was killed at Elgin^where there is a tall column, like the
Duke of York's, to the late Duke op Gordon, the Duke op Rich-
mond's predecessor, which I saw from the railway. Macbeth very
likely had a castle at Inverness, at all events there is a high place
where anybody might have had a castle, but this is not the place where
Inverness Castle stands, quite different. In the latter is a very good
picture of Mr. Charles Grant, father of Lord Glenelo, but they
do not hear very well in the Assize Court. Inverness bridge fell down,
but there is another now, a suspension one, and you do not pay any-
thing to go over it. Your health. Sir, in a dram.
"Smeddum is a good Highland word, and means spirit and pluck,
and Gaelic is the language Highlanders talk, when they do not talk
English. There is great talk in Scotland now about the Volunteer
Review, which must have been a very splendid sight, because the
costumes of the North are picturesquer than ours, and the people
quite covered Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. This reminds me of
Holyrood, where I saw the room in which Mary was sitting with
Rizzio and some others, when Darnley and the lot came in and
finished off the arrogant fiddler. But as to that being the Italian's
blood on the ground, I don't believe a bit of it. Why, the Queen had
the audience apartment altered, that she might not see the place where
the party fell, and is it likely she wouldn't have the floor planed, or a
new bit of planking put in? However, I bought a glass copy of her
seal, the original Cardinal Wiseman has got, and I will change
with his Eminence if he likes. There is not much to see in Holyrood
Palace except Uie Chapel ruins, and they are not in it, but next door,
and very interesting. Kour health, Sir, in a dram.
"As I did not stop at Perth, I cannot say anything about it, and the
same remark applies to several towns. The sandwiches at Keith are
not good, nor is the coffee, and they charge threepence a-piece for
penny cheese cakes. All the railway officials are uncommonly civil,
and I consider that railways have been a great boon to Scotland. You
do not require passports to travel in this country, but your pass-book
will show pretty clearly when you have been here, and I cannot think
that the high charges at the hotels are wise. The Caledonian Canal
is a truly grand work, linking the lakes, which are extraordinarily deep,
at least Loch Ness is, being in some parts 150 fathoms, or 900 feet,
which is nearly five times as much as the Monument is in height, and
the Caledonian Canal may be considered a monument to Telford,
whose name was Telfer, nut he altered it. The drive along the side
of Loch Ness to this place is lovely, but there are awful precipices on
one side, and in many points not a bit of parapet, so that if the horses
are restive, your pleasure in contemplating the placid waters of the
lake is a little interfered with by your feeling at every kick that you
are extremely likely to descend into the said still waters by an exceed-
ingly short road. However, there would be no pleasure in travelling
without adventure. Your health, Sir, in a dram.
"I will now enter into a somewhat elaborate, but I hope lucid state-
ment of the theological differences in Scotland, and especially upon the
points of dispute between the Establishment and the Free Kirk. In
the first place you must understand that John Knox

REFORM YOUR MEMBERS' BILLS.
We think it might keep Members more up
to the mark, were they in some way made
responsible for their conduct when in Parlia-
ment; as well for what they do, as for what they
don't. Our public servants might in some
things be treated like our private ones, and as
we charge our maids-of-all-work with their
breakages of crockery, so might we charge our
M.P.s with their breakages of faith. At the
close of every Session a Bill might be made out,
showing all the promises broken by each Mem-
ber, and the Bill might in terrorem be held by his
constituents, who of course might claim ex-
emption from publicly supporting him until he
cleared it off. A Bill of the same sort might
be preferred against the Government, setting
forth the work which they were pledged to do,
but which through negligence and chattering
they had as usual failed to finish. The remanets.
or leavings, might therein be enumerated; and
each item might, if needful, be attended with
an estimate. shnu iug what amount of damage
the neglect had caused the country, and in what
manner the injury might be best repaired. This
Bill it would of course be the business of the
Opposition yearly to bring in; and to show they
had read history, and knew something of law,
we think that in distinction from the Bill of
Rights, it might with some propriety be called
the Bill of Lefts.
Kill-me-Quick.
At the shop of a celebrated Perfumer in
the Strand there is a card in the window
whereon is inscribed "Garibaldi Bouquet."
Of course, with all true Englishmen, the gal-
lant Garibaldi is in the very best of odour,
because his exploits are performed in the cause
of Liberty; although the only scent with
which we can connect his name is the smell of
gunpowder.
SMITH O'BRIEN SUB ROSA.
That honourable and useful gentleman, Mb. Smith O'Brien, has
just published a letter, inspired with the most grateful loyalty and the
sincerest patriotism, having for its object the suggestion of a device
whereby the insidious intention of the British Government to prevent
the Irish population from arming themselves and getting drilled under
the name of Volunteers may be frustrated, and the law which forbids
the unauthorised training of soldiers evaded. The following is the
ingenious and ingenuous proposition of estimable O'Bbien :—
"The existing law does not prevent individuals, except In proclaimed district*,
from learning the use of arms. The law prohibits regimental training, but it does
not impose a penalty on the practice by individuals of the art of rifle-shooting, and
I conceivo that any number of persona may moet to try their skill as markbmen.
Let the leading gentlemen of Ireland, without distinction of party, offer prices for
marksmanship in rifle-shooting; and in caso nf need the organisation of such marks-
men into military companies would be effected without difficulty in a few weeks,
perhaps in a few days."
In the meanwhile there stands on the Statute Book a certain Act, to
wit 1st George IV. c. L; which, no doubt, Mb. O'Brien has read,
and is quite satisfied that his brilliant scheme, for making riflemen of
his trustworthy compatriots in spite of the ruling powers, is not
threatened with the least discouragement by the following portion of
that enactment:—
•'All meetings and assemblies of persons for the j-vrpo-e of training and drilling
themtdver, or of being trained or drilled in the vse of arms, or for the purposo of prac-
ticing military exercise, movements, or evolutions without lawful authority, shall
be and are hereby prohibited aa dangerous to the pence and security of His
Majesty's liege subjects and his Government."
Imprisonment for two years, or transportation for seven, are the
penalties provided for disobedience to the foregoing prohibition.
People who assemble and meet together for the purpose of drilling and
training themselves in the use of arms are liable to those punishments,
which need not, however, Mb. O'Brien thinks, deter any number of
persons from meeting to try their skill as marksmen. If, in accordance
with Mb, O'Brien's advice, there should take place in Ireland any
assembly of would-be organised combatants, with the view of learning
to shoot, under the idea that training or drilling themselves in the use
of arms is one thing, and co-operation in rifle-practice another .thing,
let us hope that Mr. O'Brien will venture to test the correctness of
his opinion to that effect by constituting himself one of the party. Let
the experiment be tiied on Smith O'Brien. If it succeeds he will
rejoice—if it fails he will be transported. One expatriation has taught
him not again to.risk the consequences of being taken in arms against
the Crown among the cabbages. Another may teach him that a
pardoned traitor made a great mistake when he attempted to levy
rebellion under the rose.
THE THEATRICAL CENSUS OF EUROPE.
Accordino to a statistical work recently published on the Continent,
it appears that at this moment there are in Europe no less than 18.640
actors, 21,609 actresses, 1,773 managers, and 21 manageresses. It is
not staled whether England is included in the above enumeration.
We should doubt it, for it is well known that we have so many actors
in England that Mb. Babbage's calculating machine would certainly
he brought to a stand-still, as effectually as though an Italian organ-
boy was grinding away outside, if called upon to give an account of
them all. In fact, so numerous are they, that if we were asked to give
the name of a single actor at the present day, we should feel extremely
puzzled. The best plan would be, to ask the very first actor you met.
Be he high, or be he low; be he Charles Kean, or be he Hicks—he
would be sure to tell you that there was unquestionably one actor on
the English stage, and that one was himself.

GARIBALDI'S ASSES.
The sympathy with Garibaldi which Punch has always entertained
was so enthusiastic, that it seemed capable of no increment. The little
but interesting circumstance, mentioned in the following extract from
Ihe letter of the Timet correspondent on a voyage with the Italian
Liberator, has raised the enthusiasm of Mr. Punch on behalf of that
glorious fellow, to a heat which would be many degrees above boiling,
if Punch's enthusiasm could boil, which it cannot, because boiling
necessarily involves evaporation, and his sentiments with regard to
Garibaldi arc fixed and not to be volatilised. The Dictator of Sicily
is not only a hero, but a wag. At the illustrious General's own place
in the islet of Caprera, where he had landed with a select party, the
scenery and the crops having undergone inspection:—
"Presently some of the domestic friends of the solitary landlord came up—sheep,
goats, and pigs, which he know and recognised ono by one, four donkeys, one of
whom he hailed by the august name of Pio Nono, and the others by other names
equally illustrious in contemporary history which I shall not write down."
"Do," the King of Naples will doubtless say, when he reads the
words last foregoing. "Write me down one of the asses." "And me
another," the Emperor of Austria will as probably exclaim;
addressing the other young tyrant, let us hope, at Vienna. "Oh, that
hei" (theTimes correspondent) "were here to write me down an ass :"
cries the young Neapolitan Dogberry, and the wish is echoed by the
juvenile Verges of Austria.
Garibaldi, by thus playfully assigning the names of his enemies to
jackasses, indicates that he bears thein no malice, and that, in his
struggle to emancipate men from asinine despotisms, "nought is done
in hate but all in honour." And if those poor despotic creatures would
but accept their proper situation, and submit to their natural master,
they would no doubt receive at his hands the same kind and gentle
treatment as that which he is described as having extended to their
representatives on the above-mentioned occasion:—
"The harmless creatures camo forward to be pctUd by their kind master, and
rubbed their long-eared heads against his logs."
If Pio Nono would only imitate this sensible as well as amiable
conduct on the part of his quadruped namesake, instead of kicking
against the prickles, he would show considerably more wisdom than he
does in proposing his toes to the lips of the faithful. The other human
counterparts of Garibaldi's asses might also just as well submit as it
were to be patted by the benevolent conqueror, and rub their long-eared
heads against his legs.
But we have been confining our consideration all this time to three
asses, and Garibaldi has four. Who is the fourth Ass P What other
name illustrious in contemporary history is it likely that a good and
great man would confer on a jackass r Louis Napoleon is not an
ass—although he is ■said to believe in Spirit-rapping. Yet Garibaldi
has evidently ideas of greatness which might induce him to regard
many a personage great in the world's eye as merely a great donkey.
Perhaps the fourth of his Asses bears the name of Lamoriciere. Or
can it be that Garibaldi's fourth ass is Lord Normanby? If he has
a fifth ass, to do any equally meritorious gcntlemau the honour of
naming it after him, the Pope's Brass Band might bray for that
distinction, to be awarded to the utterer of the loudest "ee-haw!"

pamphlet called "La Question Irlandaise." Mr. O'Brien must have

not for Marie Martin, but for Betty.

CHAPTER XXVIII.—THE REIGN OF RICHARD THE SECOND.
ichard came to the
throne when not quite
twelve years old, but
little as he was, there
is reason to believe he
was a great fop even
then. A curious illu-
mination in the Argen-
tine Collection repre-
sents him in the act of
"overing" a playmate,
to whom the boyish
King is crying (in a
>croll) "Cutkt in pour
Cupptnnnc!" andnere
the lloyal pinafore is
shown to be embroi-
dered with the tastiest
devices, and short as
is his stature, the Royal
youth is got up in the
very height of fashion.
The boy being pro-
verbially the father of
the man, we find that
as the King grew up,
his love of finery grew
with him. One of his
coats was valued at thirty thousand marks, a fact which marks, we think,
the .Royal disposition. This high value arose chiefly from the quan-
tity of needlework expended on the garment, and the precious lot of
precious stones with which it was embroidered. Another of his robes,
and very probably a Sunday one, is depicted in the portrait of him
which is still on view, being preserved in Westminster Abbey, in
the Chamber called "Jerusalem." This robe is adorned with an
elegant embroidery of capital ll's and roses: it being quite the fashion
with the dandies of this period to have either their initials or a motto
on their dresses, perhaps, as we have hinted, to mark them for the
wash. Were the custom now revived, we can conceive what stupid
mottoes would be sported by the gentish, who always mock and maul
the fashions of their betters:—
"I inish ntp ©al to please:
©, ain't it just the Crjctst!"
would doubtless be a popular device for a new shirt-front: while a
couple of lines stating that—
"grs, fHoshesfj is a J5rirk:
Shis tost but ten ano n Rttk!"
might be fittingly embroidered on the back of a gent's paletot dis-
played upon the dum-
my of an advertising
slopshop.
Under a foppish
sovereign, foppery, ot
course, became the
order of the day.'and
the lowest orders
even became visibly
infected by it. One
writer hints, that ser-
vants dressed as finely
as their masters; but
accustomed as we are
to be dazzled by the
grandeur of our
Chawlises and our
Jeameses, there is
nothing very novei
or surprising in this
fact. Knighton says,
"Y* common people
everich one dyd
showe such vanitie
in dress, y' in good
sootli by their ap-
pearance, it is wetl-
nighe impossible for r„
to distinguish riche
fro poore, laitie fro clergy, high estate fro lowe." If this was then
can we attempt to do

TEMP. RICHARD THE SECOND.
ER.
what writers of the time confessed they shrank from trying? How-
ever, all the penmen of the period were not Knight ons. Some of
them were bright'uns, and saw clearer than the Knightons, and
were able to distinguish persons of distinction. Not being a Jesuit,
Knighton possibly had not the word distinguo in his dictionary.
But other writers had, we find; and scarcely need we say, that one
of these was Chaucer, who wrote his Canterbury Tales about the
close of this short reign, and dropped therein some interesting hints
about the clothes of it. On one point his opinion coincides with
that of Knighton, in so far that lie makes his ploughman chuff t he
clergy for riding on high horses glittering with gold, and being armed
with swords and bucklers like to men of war, so that it was not easy
to distinguish them from knights. To the latter charge the parsons
might have not inaptly answered, that as part of the Church Militant
they had a right to go well armed: and as for the offence of riding the
high horse, that has been in all ages a clerical amusement, and in some
parts of the country is said to be still extant.
In further illustration of the fashions of the clergy, Chaucer has
introduced a monk among his Canterbury Pilgrims, dressed plainly in
defiance of the clerical regulations, inasmuch as he was anything but
plainly dressed. The rich sleeves of his tunic were "edged with fur
de gris, )e finest in |* land :" he wore bells upon his bridle, and a pair
of "supple" boots; and under his chin his hood was fastened with a
golden pin, which, as a climax to his fopperies, was actually fashioned
"like a true lovere hys knotte!" Nor were the clerks, it seems, a
whit less foppish than the parsons; for in the description which is
given of one in the same poem, it is said (in other metre) that—
"JSJgs host inert rto, hps turtle hltfor,

Exceptions there were, doubtless, to the general clerical rule; for we
find preachers complaining of the vanities and pomps of dress in which
the laity indulged: and this they could not well have done if they had
been themselves attired in gorgeous array. Chaucer's parson lias
two charges to bring against the people: the one accusing them of
superfluity, and the other of unseemly scantiness of dress: for it
botli these fashions were in vogue at the same period.

Duke, of Lancaster, came back from the Continent, he made his entry
into London in a "courte jacques" of cloth of gold, cut "a la fachon
d'Almayne." As another proof, moreover, of its German derivation,
the "courte" or shortened coat is said to have been called "hanselein,"
from the German "Hans," or "Jack," whence the garment became
known in England as a "jack-et." The word "slop," as applied to an
article of dress, occurs for the first time in the passage we have quoted,
and is probably derivable from the German schleppe, which signifies a
something " trailing." Whether our cheap and n—not nice tailors, who
are commonly called "slop-Bellers," have any claim to be considered
of German derivation, is a question which debating clubs may argue if
they like, but which we have neither space nor inclination to discuss.
But we may hint, that there is certainly some ground for the hypothesis:
for the word "British" we know is synonymous with "brickish," and
as slopsellers are never known to act like bricks, they clearly cannot
claim that their origin is British.
Mention has been made in the last preceding extract of the fashion
now of wearing "hose departed of two colours," and we find that
parti-coloured robes were made to match—or rather, not to match
would be speaking more correctly. Very quaint and queer were these
Earti-coloured dresses, which must have looked as t hough their wearers
ad left half of themselves at home, and had somehow got a moiety of
some one else stuck on to them. The hose too being quite dissimilar,
could hardly with propriety have been called a pair; and must have made
men fancy that their right leg had by some mishap become a wrong
one. Our circus "fools" have frequently adopted this strange fashion,
without being aware perhaps that it had been devised by the wisdom
of their ancestors. Could the latter now be summoned by the aid of
Spirit-rapping, we can fancy with what horror they would see upon
what shoulders their mantles had descended. We cannot think though,
that our clowns are to be viewed in their stage-dress as greater fools than
were their forefathers, for the latter set t he fashion which is so ridiculous.
The parti-colours sometimes had political significance, and like those
worn at elections were really party colours. In an old illumination
representing John op Gaunt, who was the uncle of Richard the
Second, gravely sitting to decide the claims upon his nephew's coro-
nation, the gaunt one wears a funnily grotesque appearance, by wearing
a long robe divided down the middle, the one half being blue and the
other being white, which we all know were the colours of the House
of Lancaster. We think that great good might result were our M.P.s
to revive this curious old fashion, and to show by their costume what
party they belonged to. Were this hint to be acted on, not merely
would the House present a much gayer appearance, by the magpie
black and white in it being turned to peacock hues; but there would
be far less chance that Members would enter the wrong lobby, as in
the now expiring Session, has unluckily occurred. Unstable minds,
moreover, might indicate their waverings, by wearing rainbow pegtops
and coats of many colours; which with a variegated vest, and a tie of
neutral tint, would show they were in-vest-ed with the freedom of a
weathercock, and could veer round independently of any party tie.

Unless a quite unlooked-for change has taken place in the views of both Abd-

is above stated to have conferred on the former involves a curious amalgamation of
the Cross and the Crescent. -

You volunteering gentlemen
Who live at home in ease,
How little do you think of us,
In mud up to our knees—
While in the huts at Aldershott,
Or on the Curragh bare.
'Neath the canvas damp, we curse the camp—
It's lucky we 're free to swear 1
A campaign in the rain is a trifle,
When glory's to be got:
Who'd grudge to clean his rifle,
When a foe it has sent to pot?
But this marching out to flounder about,
And afterwards march in,
Till your arms show a crust of dirt and rust.
And your company's wet to the skin—
With all complaining " it's always raining,"—
Is really letting one in!
When first I joined as Ensign,
My heart it did aspire,
In the mouth of a gun, at the word, to run,
And stand no end of fire.
But I certainly never bargained
For water to this extent,
Any pluck 'twould damp to live in camp,
With a shower-bath for one's tent.
The Camp campaigning duties,
Would teach us, we were told.
So day and night we have waged a fight,
With General Catarrh and Cold.
The command that gives most trouble,
And is heard in every quarter—
Is "Tallow your noses—double!"
And, "By the right—feet in hot water."
It seems so inconsistent,
This pitch to which we've got—
Feet in cold water every day,
And every night in hot!
Though honours fall but rarely,
On Glory's laurelled path,
Of one order, at least, ice've had quite a feast—
The Order of the Bath!
So I sit, and my teeth they chatter,
And I mope like a half-drowned rat;
And the rain falls, patter, patter,
Through my tent on my Mackintosh mat.
And my damp clothes lie in a huddle,
Giving out a frowsy steam,
And my feet are in a puddle,
And my bed seems the bed of a stream,
Where I dream that I'm dry, and wake to sigh,
And find it is only a dream!
Prom my Swamp, The Curragh, Inland.

THE TERRORS OF TABLE-TURNING.
fit ally, if this Spirit-moving mania be carried on much further, it
will be necessary for persons who are about to marry to take steps to
secure themselves from buying haunted furniture, and from possessing
chairs and tables which are themselves "possessed." When we hear
of wardrobes "manifesting signs of the most lively emotion" on being
approached by the mistress of the house; of sofas undergoing throes
and swaying to and fro with "tumultuous energy" when invited by a
Medium to join in a seance-, of heavy easy chairs standing up on their
hind legs, and wheeling about and turning about like so many Jim
Crows, when informed through the same means, that there were
"sperrits" present; of tables rising unsupported some three feet in the
air, and then descending to the ground with such a "dreamy softness"
that it rendered their alighting "almost imperceptible;" of tables
"rearing themselves up at an angle of 45°," without letting the vases
and things placed upon them topple over; of tables clambering up
ot tomans and jumping into beds, and performing such " strange antics"
with such "violent vivacity" as clearly showed they were "infected
with a wild rollicking glee," and "inspired with the most riotous
animal spirits;" when we hear, we say, of furniture behaving itself in
this way, we cannot but consider that people should be careful how
they run the risk of contact with it, and that great pains should be
taken to avoid the chance of accidents resulting from its getting into
an excited state. After what has actually been seen by living witnesses
(at least if we believe their tongues, and they themselves believe their
eyes, without using their other senses, common sense included, to test
the truths " to which tbey testify), we should hardly think it safe to
let a table cross our threshold without having some knowledge of its
character and habits, and feeling guaranteed in some way that when
a spirit moved it we need fear no ill effects. Having a wife and a large
family of ten or twelve small children, from whom we daily are obliged
by business to absent ourselves, it would never do to leave them at the
mercy of strange furniture; which for aught we know might prove
addicted to an intercourse with spirits, and be liable to get elevated,
and suspended in the air, and alarm the household by the madness of
its freaks.
Obviously, therefore, some measures must be taken whereby the
peace of mind of parents may be thoroughly secured, on the point as
to how far their tables may be trusted, and their chairs and sofas left
without being strictly watched. Upholsterers must be eyed as jealously
as horse-dealers, and whatever article of furniture they sell will have to
be submitted to most scrutinising tests. When they turn out a new
table, they will have to guarantee it as being free from rapping, tipping, or
any other vicious tricks; and no father of a family will think it safe to
buy an old one without asking the shopkeeper what character he had
with it, and whether it had ever shown a restive disposition, or had
betrayed a tendency to back-jump, rear, or kick. Prudent persons will
require that their easy chairs and sofas should be similarly certified;
and unless they can be warranted as. sound and safe from spirits, of
course they will not be allowed to come into a drawing-room, where
ladies, not strong-minded, might be frightened into fits.
Nor, while the Spirit mania lasts, will such precautions be less
needful with regard to bed-room furniture, which must equally awaken
one's suspicion and alarm. After what has been detailed of tables
jumping upon beds, and chests of drawers being seen to undulate and
vibrate with emotion, and curtain-rods, for aught we know, to quiver
with excitement and rotate with remorse, surely nobody would dream
of purchasing a wardrobe without a proper warranty that it was all
serene; or of suffering one's upholder to send one home a dressing-
table, which, being addicted to snow spirits in the looking-glass, might
shake one so while shaving as to make one cut one's throat. In fact,
as spirits don't seem proud, but condescend to take possession of things
most insignificant, the smallest household articles will be objects of
suspicion, the while one fears there may be "sperrits present" in one's
house. For ourselves, we frankly own, that as we have by nature a
somewhat nervous temperament, we would never even purchase a
second-hand perambulator without having a full knowledge of its
parentage ana pedigree; nor could we with any comfort use so small a
piece of furniture even as a footstool, if we fancied that a spirit-hand
had (in the dark) been seen on it.
CAMPS AND DAMPS.
There are grievous complaints of the state of the cavalry horses in
the Curragh Camp. It seems as if some biped wanted a good curragh
combing, as well as these poor starved out quadrupeds. A "French
Soldier writes to the Times, declaring that the people most to blame
are the soldiers themselves, who have not the nous to drain their camp,
and pave sloped standing-places for their horses. Perhaps there may
be some truth in this; but are we sure that the soldiers have been
permitted—much more taught—to set about such works P Let us take
care, before we blame them, to be sure that we put the saddle on the
right horse—even though the saddle be a Cavalry one, and the horse a
Dragoon.
A PROFITABLE LINE OF BUSINESS.
We read that a certain Railway pays its Lawyers £30,000 a year.
This is very pleasant for the Lawyers doubtlessly, and must pay
them remarkably well to keep up a running account of such an
agreeable magnitude; but how about the poor Shareholders P We do
not allude to the preference, or the preference preference Shareholders
with their 6, 7, and 8 per cent, guaranteed interest, but to those who
originally invested in the speculation P It strikes us (we are talking
of Bradshaa generally, and not picking out any separate line) that
many of the Shareholders have to starve in order that one or two
favoured Lawyers may be fed. Of all Railway branches, and but few of
them pay, the Legal Branch is the most expensive, and yet Railways are
always running to law, and thousands have to be paid as the penalty of
the numerous Railway collisions that are continually taking place in
consequence in the Courts of Law.
To no professional class, not even excepting the Engineers, has the
establishment of Railways been so profitable as to the Lawyers. The
Engineer finishes his line, and there to a great extent his interest ends;
but you have never finished with your Lawyer. Once allow him to put
his iron fingers on your line, and with the well-known tenacity that iron
has for iron, he will not let go his clutch in a hurry. A mother-in-law
in a household is not more difficult to be got rid of than a Lawyer who
once gets his red-bag inside a Railway carriage. He is there, you may
be sure, for life, and he takes the line in any direction he pleases, and,
not only rides free of expenses but pockets every half-year the hand-
somest dividend that the Company pays. A cabman is not paid more
than sixpence a mile, but a Railway Lawyer's fare, we should say, was
cheap at the rate of a hundred a mile. The sooner the Shareholders
put down such legal conveyances, or else keep a tight cheque-string
on them, the better they will find it for their pockets. Our words for
it, these furious-driving legal Phaetons, if not pulled up in time, will
infallibly run away with all your money.
Of all the paces, there's none like the Lawyer's pace for killing. In
their time Lawyers have killed more than Railways. When the two
combine, poor men must lose their own. In the meantime, the Railway
axiom can safely be laid down, that Railways were established in this
country for the special emolument of Lawyers and Directors. They
take the first spoil; if anything is left (if), it is divided amongst the
Shareholders.
CHILDREN, GOODS AND CHATTELS.
At the Westminster Police Court we are informed by the Morning
Post that—
14 Alleh Fairrik Johnbtone and Sarah Elliott wore further examined charged
with stealing a valuable child."
A dear child we often hear of; but a valuable child is something
apparently new. The fact is, however, that Jane Smith, the valuable
little article which Mr. Johnstone and Miss Elliott were accused of
purloining, draws large audiences by singing at various concert-rooms.
She being only five years old, her value consists in the attraction which
she exerts on the more intelligent portion of the British public in the
character of musical prodigy or phenomenon and infant wonder. For
stealing a child of this value how would the indictment ruuP The
accused might perhaps be charged with having stolen, taken, and
carried away one chdd, value £1000, for instance. A singing baby is
at least as valuable as a singing mouse; but if it were as dear as it is
valuable, its friends would take care of it, and the way to do that is
not to let it go about singing at concerts at a time when it ought to
be playing at home, or lying fast asleep in bed. Valuable children who
are allowed to ruin their health by excitement and want of natural
rest are very apt to be lost, if they are not stolen.
Is the punishment for stealing a child, whether of little or great
value, as severe as that inflicted tor stealing a sheep P The answer is
not easy; for although numerous cases of kidnapping have occurred
lately, the offenders, and especially the arch-offender, who stole the
little Jew, appear all of them to have escaped justice.
The Bonapartist Claque at Naples
It seems that one can sing, as well dance, on a volcano. For in-
stance, the Imperial claqueurs, in the pay of the Bonapartes, are trying
to get at Naples a new song, entitled, 1 Mural pour laPatrie." They
sing it with a great deal of warmth, but can get very few of the natives
to join in the chorus. Apparently the Neapolitans do not think Murat
worth a song.

A PINCH OF CUItllAGH POWDER.
Correspondents from the Curragh Camp keep on painting their
position in the wateriest of water-colours, and write as though their
military ardour were quite damped by it. It seems, their tents are full
of water, while their hearts are full of fire, burning as they are with
the desire for drier quarters. As little, except sickness, can be gained
by three months' soaking, we think the venue of the trial they have had
might now be changed, and the heroes be allowed the chance of wear-
ing a dry shirt, winch is a luxury that lately they have not been
indulged with. At any rate we think that while the soldiers have to
soak, they ought to be supplied with an extra go of grog, which
perhaps might counteract the evil of wet feet, and save the troops from
catching influenza and sore throat. Could the old Duke of Norfolk
have been consulted in the matter, he would doubtless have prescribed
a pinch of Curragh powder, as a means of giving warmth, and warding
off the chills which even soldier's flesh is heir to. But a glass of grog
"hot with" would better serve to keep the cold out, and would
palatably raise the pecker of our troops. A soldier cares not for wet
feet if he can but wet his whistle; but we think his thirst for glory is
likely to be lessened, when the glory is presented to him as a doubtful
sort of negus, consisting of a mixture of bad Tent and water.

WHAT IT MUST HAVE COME TO, IF THE RAIN HAD CONTINUED MUCH LONGER!
"IS THEBE ANY SPEEEITS PRESENT?"
"Sir,
To the Editor of Punch.
"See what you have brought upon yourself by deriding and
denying the wonderful facts of Spiritualism! Read the subjoined
paragraph concerning you, extracted from the 'Notices to Corre-
spondents' in the Spiritual Magazine:—
"Inquirer.—1 A Word with Punch on the merit* of hie three Puppet*, Slefkhead,
Wrong/lead, and Tltv-khead,' is. we believe, out of priut. The exposures in it were
certainly very damaging, but they answered the purpose. Punch never attacked
Mr. Bunn afterwards; perhaps the quiet intimation on the cornor of the title-)>age,
1 To be continued if necessary,' made Punch discreet rather than valiant. You aro
right in supposing that 1 Thiclhaid' ia the present Editor of Punch."
"Besides deterringyoufrom sayinganything more against Spiritualism,
the foregoing reference to yourself ought to convince you of its truth.
Surely you must see that trie passage above quoted is a communication
from the spirit of the late Barnard Gregory, sometime Editor of the
Satirist. Expect more, and worse, from the same quarter, if you keep
on making jests of Mediums and talking tables. Your ridicule of
quackery will be met with personal abuse, the author of which you may
call a dirty blackguard, but you will disdain to answer him, and he will
go about boasting that he has shut you up.
"The ribaldry with which you assail Spiritualism is nothing new.
It is as old as Spiritualism itself. The Spiritualist and the Scoffer have
co-existed from the beginning. Let me call your attention to evidence
of this fact, contained in some lines of doggerel (much like the verses
of your own contributors), with which an insidious naturalism, from
time immemorial, has sought to poison and prejudice the mind of
infancy:—
"High diddle diddle.
The Cat and the Fiddle,
The Cow jumped over the Moon;
The Little Dog laughed to see suoh sport:
And the Diah ran away with the Spoon."
"Let us analyse these despicable nursery rhymes, in order to expose
their covert meaning. 'High diddle diddle.' This first line is com-
monly, but erroneously, supposed to be nonsense. It embodies a
general denunciation of Spiritualism as delusion. 'High' means
supreme; 'diddlev is a familiar synonym of imposture or humbug.
The repetition of the word 'diddle' is intended to intensify the force
of it, so that 'diddle diddle' is as much as to say 'humbug double-
distilled,' or 'transcendent humbug.' The whole line amounts to a
sweeping assertion that Spiritualism is regular out-and-out humbug.
"1 shall make this statement clear as we proceed. 'The Cat and
the Fiddle.' This is ribaldry. It is just the same sort of ribaldry as
that with which you attack the high and holy truths of Spiritualism.
The words are intended to insinuate deception in the case of a
spiritual performance on a violin. The fiddle was played by spirit-
agency; but the poetaster attempts to account for a phenomenon
which he cannot deny by suggesting that the sounds were produced by
a cat, that twitched the strings of the instrument with her claws under
the table.
"' The Cow jumped over the Moon.' More ribaldry. As much ai
to say, the alleged fact of spirit-fiddling is as improbable as the
legendary relation that a certain ruminant quadruped overleapt the
satellite of this planet.
"'The little Dog laughed to see such sport.' Ribaldry again. Of
course a dog could not laugh; though the so-called laughing hjiena is
a brute of the dog kind, and such puppies as your Toby may laugh at
humble women for inquiring, in the unaffected language of the lower
classes, whether there is any sptrrits present? By the sport mentioned
in this line are intended Spiritual manifestations; and the pretended
laughter of the little dog is an innuendo, signifying that they were so
monstrously absurd as even to excite the derisive merriment of an
animal of the canine species.
"We now come to the last of the five lines which compose this piece
of stupid scurrility. 'And the Dish ran away with the Spoon.' This
is the simple statement of an unquestionable Spiritual fact, which the
preceding buffoonery is calculated to discredit.
"You will live to believe in Spiritualism, if you live till you are a
day older—as Dr. Lardner lived to see the Atlantic crossed by
steamers. Spirits will, of course, immediately disclose the authors of
the Road and Stepney murders. You have put them on their mettle
by defying them to reveal anything whatever, and, though in eternity,
they will lose no time in rapping out the names of the murderers by
the alphabet.

PROPRIETIES OF PENNY-A-LINiNG.
N the report of a recent exe-
cution published by a con-
temporary, there occurs, im-
mediately after the description
of an attempt on the part of
the prisoner to commit suicide,
the following remark:—
"The prisoner appears to have
conducted himself exceedingly well
since bo bas been in Horsemonger
Lane Gaol."
The endeavour to destroy
himself seems not to have
appeared to the reporter an
exception to the prisoner's
good behaviour. In continua-
tion we are told that—
"He attended chapel every day,
and seemed to be very much please l
with the religious discourses of the
Rev. Mr. Jessopp, and paid great
attention to them."
In a previous part of the
narrative we find that Mr.
Jessopp " exhorted him to tell the truth, and not go out of the world with
a lie in his mouth." He, however, did go out of the world asserting
his innocence. If it was really the fact that he paid any attention
whatever to the religious discourses of the clergyman, that fact would
suggest a shocking doubt of his guilt. But, to our relief, we are
informed, not only that he paid great attention to those discourses, but
was also "very much pleased with them." A man about to be hanged
might be terrified or comforted by ghostly exhortations, but could
hardly be likely to be "pleased" with a religious discourse; like a
serious gentleman at large sitting under Mr. Spurgeon. We may
safely conclude that the attention paid by the convict to the discourses
of his spiritual adviser was about equal to the pleasure which he
derived from them.
What a wonder that, in penning the passage next subjoined, the
narrator did not think of instituting a comparison which it suggests to
anybody who is in the least acquainted with Lempriere^s Dictionary:—
"Ho conversed freoty with tho warders who had the charge of him, and up^n
ono oocaslon, in reference to tho punishment of death, he said he objected to it
1 upon principle,' and said he did not think the law was justified in taking lifo for
any crime."
This philosophical behaviour is really quite analogous to the conduct
of Socrates in his last moments.
We seem to have read the ensuing description, or something very
like it, more than once before; indeed, very often. Like nearly every
criminal, an account of whose execution for murder we have ever
perused, the condemned man, having taken leave of his friends,—
"Went to bed at the usual hour, and slept soundly till yesterday morning at
o'clock, when ho got up and dressed himself, and had his breakfast, which

the mournful cavalcade proceeded across tho yard to tho place of execution, which
is at some considerable distance."
Equestrian tragedies have been performed in a theatre; but even ou
the stage it is at least unusual for a prisoner to be led to execution in
a cavalcade.

consisted of cocoa and bread and butter. He ato the whole of the allowance given
to him apparently with great relish, and asked for an additional quantity, which
was supplied him, and he finished the whole of that also."
If the reports of executions in general can be believed, the la3t
breakfast of a murderer is almost invariably a good one, and he seldom
fails to ask for more; which is always "supplied him," in most cases
"promptly" or "immediately." The items of the meal also, as in the
present instance, are constantly specified. Somebody must be inte-
rested in this sort of detail, instead of being disgusted with it. We
wonder if the chronicler of such particulars would be sensible of
recording anything incongruous with the solemnity of the occasion
in stating, if an eccentric malefactor gave him occasion for doing so,
that the prisoner "expressed a wish for shrimps, which was instantly
gratified, or "requested a bloater, which was at once supplied him."
In the extract which shall conclude this anthology, however, there
is one word, which, if not absolutely novel in the composition of such
a narrative as that in which it occurs, may nevertheless suggest a new
idea to thinking minds:—
"The chaplain thon commonced roading tho Imposing service for the dead, and

Mr. Herman Lang (the name reads like the German for Long-
fellow) writes to the Times to state that a Volunteer Band, if good
for anything, cannot be kept up for less than £1,000 a year. (Bosh!)
We venture to say that the Pope's Brass Band, proficient as they are in
blowing their own trumpets as well as those of their harmonious
master, manage to keep themselves up for a much less sum than the
above. We doubt if the poor fellows draw much beyond their own
breath. The reward is certainly not great, tending to empty the
chest rather than fill it, but then the Pope, who has not kept an old
rag-shop so many years for nothing, says it is the Best Price that can
be Given for Old Brass.
Inhuman Attempt at the Floral Hall.
A Frenchman's love of the ridiculous exceeds even his love of the
truth. An apology was made the other evening for Mllb. Parepa's
absence:—"^ / il parait done que Mlle. Parbpa ne parait pas."
The Frenchman, who was the unnatural parent of the above absurdity,
was so proud of his misshapen distorted offspring, that he went about
introducing it to every one he met. How true it is, that parents love
their deformed children the best!
Poor Beasts !—It is decided that the Natural History of the British
Museum is not to go out of town this year.

STOP HER!
We read a short time ago, in a contemporary the following strange want :—
"RANTED, A SINGING CHAMBERMAID."
Now of all the nnisances in one's establishment, we should fancy a domestic who
could not hand one the Timet newspaper without bursting into a bravura song,
would be unexceptionably the most intolerable. Any one who goes singing about
the house is a bore. One instinctively longs to fling the brute over the bannisters;
but to have Mollt constantly humming about one's ears—to warm your bed the
last thing at night with "We're all Nodding" and to bring you a cup of tea at
daybreak with "Behold hoto brightly breaks (he Morning"—would have such an
effect upon our sensitive nerveB, that,, by St. Barnabas! we would as soon live under
the same roof with a party of Puseyite priests who were practising intoning all
day. We know we should very soon have to rush off to the nearest tailor's, who
had the private custom of the Lunacy Commissioners, and ask to be measured
without delay for the strailest of Btrait- waist coats. We should only want a
facetious butler, a dancing porter, a crockery-smashing footman, and an Irish valet,
who never spoke to you without slapping his thighs and saying, "Lord bliss yer
'oner!" to complete our mundane happiness.
Perhaps, however, the "Singing Chambermaid " was wanted for the stage, and
certainly the stage is welcome to her so long as she doesn't come near us. When
all our wives and daughters sing at the present day, we certainly don't want
chambermaids who can sing also, unless they were sure to charm our hearts and
ears like Miss Patti Oliver, or Miss Louise Keeley, as often as they play the
part of one.

THE SOLDIER OF THE HOLY SEE.
P'it this and that together. This is one of Reuter's telegrams :—
*' Perugia, Aug. 30.
■ General Lamoriciire, in an order of tbe day, has directed bta troopa to plunder any town
which, on tbe approach of the enemy, ahonld rise in insurrection.■
That, which follows, is a paragraph from the Times:—
"A Loretto Vow.—General Lamoriciise went on tho 15th of last month to the famous
chapel of Our Lady of Loretto, and having, like other pilgrims, offered his devotions ut tho shrine,
solemnly engaged to present there tx voto the sword which ho now braodinbes on tho Fore's
behalf, as aoon aa he shall have delivered tbe Pontifical throne from all its enimles."
Lamoriciere's order of the day, appropriately dated at Perugia, would, if it
stood alone, seem the proclamation of a miscreant. Taken, however, in connection
with the gross and monstrous act of fetichism which lie performed at Loretto, it
he may possibly be a madman.
SAVE ME EROM MY FRIENDS.
It is tho Emperor who has saved the Pope."—rertigny't Sptech at
Who raised up Italy (no matter why)—
The Austrian legions to defy?
Who spoke a speech fas under Milan's duomo
He rode with 77 Re Galantuomo)
That on the heart of Italy so wrought,
(No matter what he thought).
It fused a rush of units to a nation—
Furnished cement to annexation—
Gave Garibaldi room and verge to grow—
An avalanche from flakes of snow—
And fixed the point d'appui to twist the rope
That soon or late must hang the Pope F
Let us not stay to ask the "how" or "why,"
This man, for once, looked high,
And spoke, as one with faith in a good cause,
Who champions Heaven's laws:
But own (he hand that did what his has done,
Sure as light follows sun,
Sowed seeds of death in that old Papal power
Which France props at this hour.
Let Persigjjy employ his special pleading,
His priestly gulls misleading;
'Tis no less true the Church's eldest son
The deed of parricide has done;
That his sword undermined St. Peter's chair,
Which now his bayonets up-bear.
That Pio Nono's prayer, on bended knee,
Is, or at least should be,—
"'Gainst foes leave me alone to gain my ends,
But save—oh save me from my friend*!"
A COLOSSAL BORE.
We wonder that Mons. Ferdinand de Lesseps. with
his wonderful powers of boring, has not yet been able to
construct the canal across the Isthmus of Suez. With so
powerful a bore at the head of the works, the job should
have been of the easiest nature, and ought to have been
constructed at the very smallest expense. How tired we
are of this everlasting surging, up-heaving, Isthmus I If
it only had been worked half as well in reality aa it has
been on the press, French men-of-war might be sailing
across it at the present moment, on their way to take pos-
session of India. We can understand M. De Lessees
holding on to it with all his teeth, for it is a kind of ali-
mentary canal to him, so long as any subscriptions keep
pouring in; but we do wish that he would bore quietly like
a mole underground, and not disturb the peace of Europe
as though all the mountains in the world were in labour.
M. de L. has been hammering away again at poor Lord
Palmerston, who does not seem much hurt by the puny
blows he is perpetually receiving from this effervescing
little Frenchman. He has been sending his Lordship some
more "Observations" as striking as those he has dealt
him five thousand times at least before, but they do not
appear to have made any greater impression than their
feeble predecessors. Nettled at no notice being taken
either of them or himself, he sent to Cambridge House
under all possible forms and disguises, until his servant,
who seems to be as great a genius at boring as his master,
brought, back the following answer:—" Lord Palmer-
ston's final reply on the subject of M. De Lessep's canal
is simply—Cut it." Nothing could be more expressive,or
so laconic, or kinder, and yet we are told that M. De
Lesseps is in a greater rage than ever. There are i
men whom it is impossible to please.
Verbum Sap. Verbum Nap.
The Emperor Louis Napoleon is composing a Life of
Julius Ctssar. This is well; for he can hardly fail to over-
look the awful warning latent in the first line of the Com-
mentaries. If France snould attempt a new career of con-
quest, and Europe, indignant, should take her in hand,
who knows but that a future historian may have to record
that Omnis Oallia divisa est in, &c.

PARTRIDGE SHOOTING IN THE HIGHLANDS.

Bisons are kept. He says to Geordie the Keeper: "I trust, mt good Fellow, this is not the Season tou spoke op in
WHICH THESE CREATURES—TOU KNOW—EH—WHAT—A—A—ARE DANGEROUS!"
JOHN BULL'S BLUNDERS.
The City of Montreal, in Lower Canada, Las been thrown into an
uproar by a proposition brought before its Municipal Council for
changing the name of one of its squares from Commissioner Square to
Victoria Square, and by the circumstance that a monument to Lord
Nelson has been erected in another square named after JacquilS
Cartier, the original founder of Canada. It certainly does seem
wonderful that, considering how punctiliously the British Government
has respected and protected the institutions and laws of French
Canada, the people of Montreal should abase us like pickpockets for
proposing to name one of their squares after the British Sovereign,
and setting the image of a British hero up in the other. But this is
just the way we always do offend people after having done our utmost
to deserve their gratitude. We confer on them inestimable benefit?,
and then unwittingly inflict on them some petty slight, or exas-
perate them by some unintentional insult. We consult their interests,
out overlook their prejudices; do our best to promote their moral
and material prosperity, but tread by accident on their sentimental
corns. To pamper Sepoys and give them larded cartridges was a
regular British blunder; and it was a blunder still more regularly
and truly British to call a square in Montreal by the name of our
Queen, and to post an effigy of Nelson among the descendants of
Irench people in a place which would have been appropriately occupied
by that of a distinguished Frenchman.
How shall we make amends to the susceptibilities we have wounded P
Shall we implore the City Council of Montreal to call the square which
was to have borne the name of British Majesty, Bourbon Square?
Shall we invite them to remove Nelson from Cartier Square and put
Cartier on Nelson's pedestal P It would be as well perhaps if we
were to endeavour to disarm the animosity we have unawares provoked
among foreigners, and particularly our next neighbours, if we were, as
a set-off against our Waterloo Places and Trafalgar Squares, to call
several of our streets Bonaparte Street, and to name the new midge at
Westminster Austerlifz Bridge. It is true that we have Napoleon as
well as Wellington boots. The more general adoption of such nomen-
clature would show that we intend no affront to those who feel them-
selves aggrieved by the clumsy ineptitudes—gaucheries don't they call
them?—which they mistake for insolence. The fact is, that we, being
extremely deficient in pride and vanity, cannot conceive how others
can be irritated by trifles, of which we in their places should take no
notice except that of a smile. They Bhould pity our obi useness. As
to Nelson's statue, the French Colonels themselves might be content
to see it in the Place de la Concorde, on the condition that it should be
made by one of our own sculptors. They might admit Wellington's
on the same terms. Both Waterloo and Trafalgar would then be more
than avenged.
Tribulation dimming-.
The Reverend Dr. Cumming has published a new book and some
prophetic sermons, in an advertisement of which he styles himself
Author of The Great Tribulation Coming on the Earth." Dr. Cum-
ming, by his own account, would seem to be a very ill-natured person;
but let us hope that his machinations will be frustrated, and that his
malevolent hopes will be disappointed by the non-arrival of the cala-
mity which he appears to anticipate so confidently as to call himself
the author of it. At least, we may trust that he will inflict upon the
world no greater tribulation than a great bore.
Waste of Print.
"Lord Granville's orrand to Madrid is in connection with recent efforts to put
down slavery."
"The Kino or Naples has been offered an asylum by the Queen or Spain inth»
event of his being expelled from his dominions.
Except as regards the names, these paragraphs teem to Sir. Punch
to be tautology.

DE MORTUIS NIL NISI BONUM.

ome of the descend-
ants of Captain
Cook, the great cir-
cumnavigator, are
advertising for sub-
scriptions to a monu-
ment which it is pro-
posed to erect to that
distinguished man.
Cook, needs no monu-
ment beyond the Ar-
chipelago he opened
to civilisation. Every
missionary, every co-
lonist, every clothed
native man or wo-
man, every educated
native child, nay,
every pig in the
islands of the South
Seas, is a figure in
Cook's monument—
a nobler one than
ever was reared to
conqueror. Anything
the surviving Cooks
may do in the monu-
mental line must fall
far below this. Too
many Cooks, in fact,
in this, as in other
cases, are likely to
spoil the broth.
Floods of Talk.
In one of his pre-
faces, Coleridge
says: "There are such things as fountains in the mind." From the way in which M.P.s
give their minds to talking, we should say that every unappreciated Demosthenes in the
House must have a good-sized fountain concealed about him. It must be so, or else they
could not be so incessantly spouting.
THE TRAVELLING SEASON.
The King of Naples has decided upon
taking along journey. As Vesuvius was getting
too hot to hold him, he has been recommended
change of air by his physician, Dr. Garibaldi.
The atmosphere of Naples was found a great
deal too oppressive for one of his feeble con-
stitution. In this instance, the formality of a
passport was entirely dispensed with. It has
been kindly intimated to His Royal Highness,
who has been suffering a great deal lately, that
he need not hurry himself in the least about his
return: and the friendly advice has likewise
been given to him that, for fear of meeting with
any annoyance on his journey, he had Better
travel strictly incognito. Should it even be
suspected who he is, the public curiosity,
which, in cases of persons of illustrious birth
and renown, cannot always be repressed, might
seriously detract from his enjoyment. We wish
him joy of his trip.
The Houses of Idleness.
At the Prorogation of Parliament, it seems, as
eacli Clerk bows four times to each Bill, no less
than two hundred obeisances had to be given
before the work was got through. A deal of
bowing and scraping, and no advance made. A
porcelain mandarin on a mantel-piece couldn't
wag his empty head more unmeaningly. Heads
may well fall low when they have so little to be
so proud of. In one House, it is all idle cere-
mony; in the other, all idle talk. Our Lords
employ their learned pates in bowing, and our
Commons in bow-wow-ing.
Homebco oa Humebug.—The Spirit-rapping
mania may be a moral disease indeed; but it
has also a material aspect. May it not be con-
sidered as a species of impost hume f
DOUBLE MEMORY.
In the pages of Once a Week we read the particulars of the case of a
young lady who was afflicted with what is called " A Double Memory."
One day she was as ignorant as a Member of Parliament, and the next
she would be as accomplished as the object of your affections that you
have an appointment with at eleven o'clock to-morrow in front of the
"hymeneal altar," at St. George's, Hanover Square. On Monday her
fingers would be quite sore from not knowing how to handle her pot-
hooks and hangers; but on Tuesday she would write you a book
almost as clever as any written by Mrs. Gore. This two-fold state,
in which one was alternately a child and a young lady, must, however,
have possessed certain advantages. It is sometimes so convenient for
a young lady to forget to-morrow the beautiful things she has been
promising you to-day. Moreover, is the case so very wonderful after
all F Cannot every one recall to memory innumerable instances of old
ladies who have fancied themselves almost young children, and, under
that delusion, have acted most childishly P It was once our happy lot
to know a friend who owed us a certain sum of money (say £1000).
Not only for five long years did he recollect that he owed us the
money, but at last, when hope had almost grown into despair, he also,
by some miracle or other, recollected to pay it! It is true that the
second recollection was of very slow growth, but the two facts, taken
together, authorise us in saying, that we look upon the above pheno-
menon of our friend as the most wonderful illustration of "Double
Memory" we ever met with.
The Prince of Wales in Canada.
On Tuesday, the 21st nit., his Royal Highness drove out to see the
Palls of Montmorenci, near Quebec. Whilst he was contemplating the
cascade, a bystander remarked that the noise was deafening. "Ah,"
said another, "that is indeed extraordinary. Cataract is generally
blinding." The speaker was a Surgeon; and his observation was
rebuked with a universal cry of " Shop!"
Patron Goddess of the Skittle Ground.—Flora.
THE VOLUNTEER MOVEMENT.
Another admirable phase of the above movement was the won-
derful precision with which, to a minute, several of the leading establish-
ments in London closed their shops last Saturday week. When the
"close" order of "Put up Shutters" was given, not a man lagged
behind. It was another ebullition of the strong Volunteer spirit which
animates the entire country. If we are "a nation of shopkeepers," it
is bnt right that the shopkeepers themselves should do something to
defend it. If they cannot exactly give their bodies, they are right, by
thus closing early, to prove that they are perfectly willing to lend
their "hands." These closed shutters are an addition to the Wooden
Walls of England. If Louis Napoleon should ever beoome our cus.
t onier (and there is no doubt that in one sense he would be a very
"ugly customer" indeed), a notice might be written on each shop-
front that he would be "served," not behind the counter, but in the
open field, where all military orders would be executed on the shortest
notice. Should it ever come to a measurement of weapons, we are
positive that the English yard-measure would teach the French pretty
forcibly to mind their " aune."
The Two Extremes.
At some public meeting we read, that "the thanks of the Meeting
were given to the Press and Sir George Bowyer." This convinces
us more than ever, that there is only one step from the Sublime to the
Ridiculous. How strangely astonished Sir George must have been
to have found himself thrust into such intellectual company. The poor
fellow must have felt very uncomfortable!
"COMING EVENTS," ETC.
We have learned that apartments have been taken at the Clarendon
for one John Smith. Knowing how like one Bourbon is to another,
and recollecting how certain family traits run in that interesting
family, we should not be in the least surprised if the King op Naples
was already on his way to this country. We do not envy him his
welcome.

CHAPTER XXIX.—TWO WORDS MORE ABOUT THE REIGN
OF RICHARD THE SECOND.
nother eccentricity to be
noticed in the civil cos-
tume of this period was
the wearing of wide sleeves,
which were "shaped like a
bagpipe," and were known
in common parlance by the
name of "pokys." This they
probably obtained from the
fact that odds and ends were
now and then poked into
them; for the Monk of
Evesham tells us that they
were also known as the
"devil's receptacles," be-
cause of their convenience
for hiding stolen goods.
In spite of this, however,
servants were allowed to
wear them like their mas-
ters; and we have no doubt
their example was followed
by their "followers." The
sleeves were made so long
and wide that they reached
down to the knee, and
sometimes even to the feet;
and it is easy to imagine
that any snapper-up of un-
considered trifles could
make a decent living by
the perquisites he pouched. Another nuisance in these pokys was, that
they continually were dipping into dishes, for the Monk expressly tells
us that servants when engaged in bringing in the sauces, "dyd saucilie
contrive to lett their sleeves have y" first taste."
Fully as absurd as these foolishly wide sleeves were the sillily long
shoes introduced about this time, and which were known commonly by
the name of "crackowes." It is likely they were called thus from the
city of Cracow, whence there is some reason to believe they were
imported. Shoes with long points, we have seen, were worn in England
as early as the reign of William Rupus'; but from these the crack-
owes differed somewhat in their shape, and in having their points
fastened up with chains of gold or silver to the knees of those who
wore, but could not otherwise have walked in them. Mention of these
crackowes is made by an old writer in a work called the Evlogium
(probably because there is so very little praise in it), and as it likewise
throws some light on other fashions of this period, we are disposed to
let the passage have insertion in our Book :—
Abouto this time y» Commons [i. e. the people, not the House] were besotted in
exceedinge excess uf apparrell, some in wide surcoats reaching to their loins, some
in a garment reaching to their heeles, close before and struttiuge out on y» sides, so
yt at ya backo they mako men seeme like women, and this they doe call by y*
ridiculous name of govine. Their hoodes sro little, tied under y* chinne and eke
buttonedde like y* women's, but set with gold or silver and precious stones. Their
lirripipes or tipjiets do pass round y« neck, and hangiuge downe before reach to y*
heeles all jagged. Tbey have auothor weed of silk which they do call a paliock.*
Their hose are of two colours, or pied with more, which they tio to their paltocks
with white lachets called bcrlots, withouten any breeches (!). Their girdles are of
gold and silver, and some of them worth twenty markes. Their shoes and pattens
■Mre snouted and piked, more than a fingere long, crookyng upwards, which they do
call crackowes, resembling devil's clawes, and fastenedu to y« knees with chains of
guide and silvere."
For further information respecting the clothes worn by civilians at
this period, we may well refer the curious to the Canterbury Tales,
where Chaucer, who combined the penny-a-liner with the poet, has
described a lot of people of both high and low estate. They may learn
here how the Squire wore a short gown with long sleeves, and a robe
embroidered—
"As it were a mede
AUe fulle of freshe flowres white a rede:"
—how the Yeoman was "yclad in a cote and hoode of grene," had his
born slung in a green baldrick, wore a dagger on one side and sword
* This "weed" it would appear had sprung from Spanish soil, and had been
somewhat in use with the flower of the nobility in the time of Edward the Third.
The word paletoque is still extant in the Spanish dictionary, and is there said to be
"a kind of dress like a ecapulary," which instructive information leaves us little
wiser than we were before. Du Chesns describes a scipulary as a monk's frock
without sleeves; and as the word paletoquo is obviously compounded of palta a
cloak and toque a kind of head-dress, we are encouraged to conjecture that the
garment had a something like a monkish cowt attached to it. As paleto in Spanish
signifies a clown, it is likely that the paltoek wns first worn by common people:
and as the modern paletot is obviously descended from it, we think that advertising
tailors should advertise the fact.

and buckler on the other, bore in his hand "a mighty bow," and carried
a sheaf of arrows winged with peacock's feathers underneath his belt;
how the Franklin, or country
gentleman, is simply spoken
of as wearing an anelace, or
knife, and bearing at his
girdle a gipciere or purse of
silk, which, being "as white
as milk," for aught we know
may in reality have had the
colour of sky-blue; how the
Merchant is described as
being dressed in "motley,"
(a term which Chaucer
aptly gives to the parti-
coloured costume we have
previously described, and
which must have made a
man look vastly like a fool),
and as wearing a forked
beard and a Flaundrish bea-
ver hat, and boots which, we
are told, were "fayre and
fetously ) clasped ;" how the
Doctor was clothed "in san-
guin and in perse" (». «.,
purple and light blue), and
the Lawyer wore a medley
coat striped with different
colours * and y-girt with

Steward (who though called
a Reeve may really have been somewhat of a Rough) was adorned with
a long surcoat and a rusty sword, had a closely shaven beard, and hair
rounded at the ears and docked upon the crown in the manner of a
priest's; how the Ploughman wore a tabard and a hat and scrip and staff,
and the Shipman was attired in a gown of stuff called falding, falling to
the knee, and had a dagger under his arm Blung by a lace thrown round
the neck: how, for reasons of his
own which it is needless to inquire
into, the Miller wore a white coat.t

—a phrase which might induce one
to imagine them ancestrally related
to our flunkeys, and first founders of
the solemn Brotherhood of Plush.
In this reign, as in the last, the
hair was worn rather long and very
carefully curled, and the beard long
and forked, "like the tail of a
swallow," a fashion which can
hardly be considered inappropriate,
seeing that the swallow has con-
nection with the throat. Whether
the dandies had a habit of twiddling
their moustaches is more than we
can say; but they wore them long
and drooping upon each side of the
mouth, as one sees is not infrequently
done even to this day.
With regard to the military cos-
tume of this period, we find there
was but little noticeable change in
it. The gradual substitution of plate
armour for mail, which had been pro-
ceeding in the previous two reigns,
was continued and brought almost
to completion under Richard. Of the complete suit of ringed mail,
which had been in use at the beginning of the century, all that now
remained were the apron edge, the gussets which were made to shield
the joints, and the camail or chain neck-guard that was added to a

of Edward the Second. Milan was the place whence the best
armour was imported: Italian iron beiug perhaps considered the
most suitable for welding into suits. The preference thus given to
plate of foreign make may have been one of the grievances of Wat
Tiler the blacksmith, who having killed the tax-gatherer for trying
to tax his daughter * was knocked down by Lord Mayor Walworth,
"whose mace dyd give him peppere for hys murderous as-salt."
A curious kind of bassinet came into fashion at this period, having
its vizor sharply pointed and shaped like a bird's beak. The advantage
of this form it is difficult
to tell; and the sole cause
we can think of why it was
adopted is that, as it made
the wearers look like fighting
cocks, it may perhaps have
urged them to crow over
their enemies. The vizor,
ventaille, or baviere, as it
was variously called, was
perforated with small holes,
just big enough for breathing
through; but unless, which
is not likely, the wearers

exceeded ours. Just imagine our M.P.s "debating" in the dog days
in such attire as his! We are told too that his leggings, or, as they
were then oalled, jambs, were "made of cuir bouilli, a choice kind of
leather much in use during this period," which we think must have
increased the inconvenience of his dress. However "choice" it may
have been, we don't think we should choose to have our legs jammed

POUTER ON POLITICAL ATOMS.
The free and independent electors of the city of Exeter
met the other day at the London Inn, having been con-
vened by circulars "to hear a further exposition of the
political views of Whitwortk Porteb, esq , the Con-
servative candidate for the representation of the city, in
the room of Mb, Divett, who is about to retire." The
following is a specimen of the political views regarding
Reform exposed by Major Porter :—
"Ho observed upon those who wore endeavoured to be added to
the franchise by tho two statesmen alludod to. and said that he
thought tboeo who were mentioned in Mb. Disrakli's Bill were
better than opening the flood-gates and lotting in those which Lord
John Rcbsbll desired. The bill of that statesman was an atom of a
bill from an atom of a man. (Laugliter.)"
If Lord John's Reform Bill was an atom of a Bill, and
a measure of which the strength was proportionate to the
size, how could it have been powerful enough to open
flood-gates? Is Major Porter a disciple of Hahnemann,
rud does he imagine that atomic Bills possess the virtues
which Homoeopathists ascribe to infinitesimal Pills P
Major Pohter calls Lord John Russell an "atom
of a man." This is just the phrase in which a tall officer,
superior to the biggest blockhead in height and nothing
else, would be likely to express his contempt for a political
opponent of small stature. Is the gallant Major six feet

Exeter look down upon the Secretary for Foreign Affairs

Wiutworth Porter, Esq , in propounding the above
illustrations of his Conservative Atomic Theory, may
perhaps be considered not only to have delivered an expo-
sition of his political views, but also to have exposed him-
self. Do the electors of Exeter require him to afford them
auy further exposition of politics or self-exposure?

Off with your rain-clouds, evaporate! mizzle!
Wat'riest, weariest, wettest of saints;
O'er jour blue nose draw your night-cap of drizzle,
Hence, with your chorus of coughs and complaints!
Take your catarrhs, with their snufflings and sneezings;
Take your bronchitises, whistlings, and wheeziugs,
Take your congestions and pleurisies hence, as
Well as your agues and slow influenzas—
Go with a whoop, and go with a call—
Go with a murrain from each and from all!
Sorely the wheat on the uplands you threatened,
Sadly you rotted the hay in the dells;
The market for light summer muslins you flattened,
As the poor draper's stock-book too certainly tells;
Tou thinned the hotels, and you town-tied the tourists;
You made the Lake car-men perforce sinecurists;
E'en the Volunteer movement you aimed at restraining,
But it went on full gallop, in spite of your raining;
And the soldierly spirit, in Curragh and Camp,
Like John Bright, by your spouting you struggled to damp.
Our peaches you stonily hindered from swelling,
Washed out all the savour from pear and from pium,
Made our peas so insipid they scarce were worth shelling,
Persuaded the swallows that winter was come.
What lady adventured a daring new bonnet,
But you threw, unfeeling, cold water upon it?
Who tried garden-party or open-air/<ffe,
But you without orders, sent your heavy wet?
And all in these islands were singing one song:—
"Here's Down with Saint Swithiu— his rain is too long!"
Till we deemed in our blindness blue sky was abolished,
And summer transported to Botany Bay;
That the dogs, for some cause, had had their days demolished,
And Sirius been muzzled, or minced like Dog Tray.
And the world seemed a vista of weary wet Sundays,
And mankind's occupation to chant "de Profundi*;
And barometers stood as if fixed at "much rain;"
And we thought we should never see sunshine again;
And all of our blindness and bitterness, too,
Was owing, oh soppy St. Swithin, to you!
But the sun in the heavens was steadily shining
Behind the dark rain-clouds, for all who could see;
And the grain we deemed perished, the fruit we thought pining,
Kept their faith in the future more constant than we;
The rain-cloud must pass, and the growing things knew it,
And garnered each glance of the sun that pierced through it;
For now that St. Swithiu is chased from his hold,
They don feasting garments of green and of gold:
And waving glad welcome to sun and blue skies,
Bid even St. Swithin God speed, as he flies!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CHINESE CUSTOM.
To the Memtert of the Society of Friends.
ober Fkiends,—A letter
in a newspaper from
an English resident
at Chusan, contains
the passage follow-
ing :—
"I saw a washerman
tbia morning, and asked
him why he mado himself
peculiar in plaiting his
pigtail with drab-coloured
Mlk. Ho replied, 'I lose
my moder.'
The writer of this
remark was evidently
a gentleman of your
way of thinking, for
he represents the act
of the Chinaman in
plaiting his pigtail
with drab - coloured
Bilk on account of his
mother's death as
something absurd.
The habitual wearing
of drab, of course, he
does not consider
more ridiculous than
you do; but he deems
it folly to put on that,
or any other particular
colour on the death of
a relation—inanity for
a man to illustrate
a solemn grief by
changing the fashion
of bis clothes. He
would not himself,
willingly put a piece of crape round his hat if he lost a parent, or a brother, or a sister,
or a wife; much less would he attire himself in a suit of black cloth for a few months, as
though to display what there is no occasion for displaying—sorrow; and to show that Borrow

to be temporary. To be sure, if not quite one
of yourselves, he might, against his will, go
into what is called mourning" for the very
reason that made him laugh at the Chinese for
doing so. If, in this country, he were to lose a
relative, and did not, as it were, plait his own
pig tail in the mode prescribed by Society on
such occasions, he would "make himself pecu-
liar." He would also be considered to fail in
"showing respect," as the cant phrase is, to
the memory of the deceased, and would be
abused and shunned for an unfeeling brute.
Thus it is, Friends, that when poor people
have the sad misfortune to lose anybody who is
near and dear to tbem, the misery of their
situation is greatly aggravated by the necessity
of buying new clothes which they do not want,
in addition to incurring a monstrous bill run
up by a harpy of an undertaker for the supply
of a vast number of unnecessary articles, and
the performance of idle, unbecoming, and intrin-
sically ludicrous, pomp and ceremony. . This
fine is inflicted by custom on a poor man, the
father, perhaps of a family dependent upon his
industry for support, and who has nothing to
look forward to in his old age beyond what he
can save out of his hard and precarious earn-
ings, whereas every farthing which he ought to
lay by is run away with by the Income-Tax.
O Friends, of whom plain drab is supposed
to be the only wear, what a blessing it would
be if you could prevail on the British Public to
leave off demonstrating their woe by plaiting
their pig-tails, so to speak, with a material of
a particular colour, or at least to cease to
impose upon others the obligation of goiug to
the expense of so bedizening themselves on pain
of social excommunication! I am, friends,
yours verily, |3HJJ«Ti&.

But you see as ow our Govnor he ave got a wulgar mind,

We've been driven to our Wits end how the time to parse away.

As we oped to have been Honored by the Mejuni mister Ome:
"To tell you what ocurred, leastways has well as I am able.
You must no our small Teaparty all set round a small square Table:
Which, when we'd laid our anas on it, mysteerously did move,
Leestways, it might ave seemed mysteerius if I adn't give a shove!
A Mejum, who sat oppersite (which er looks weren't over plesent)
Then put the hawfle question, 'His theer any sperrits present ?*
Wheerupon beneath the table we immeejet heerd a rappin,
Which 1 don't mind tell in you it were my walking-stick a tappin.
On beink hast the question then the Sperrit did proclaim
That it were my Great Grandma, which it didn't no er name!
And when we terrogated as to wheerabouts she lived,
'I ain't a goin to tell you!' were the hanser as she gived.
This here famly hinfermation were so precious interesting
That i can't say as it tempted me to put a third kivesting;
But Jane she asked if er young man were livink in good eallh,
Which the Sperrit said as he were dead—not knowing twoz mytelth!
"Next Cook she ast the Sperrit if her love he were all right,
Which you know he is a Pleaceman, as she sups im hevry night:
And the sperrit ses, 0 yes he were, it knowed him very well,
He were ired now as a orsler at the Arrowgit otel!
Well, at this hi bust out larfink, and Cook she did the same.
So the Mejum ses she wouldn't stop, of her if we made game.

Which as she spoke, the table up—from her side on it—rose!
'There!' ses she, 'I told you so, you see they 're gettin in a rage;'
But a boy a-sittink by her, which he is my lady's page,
He told me the next mornink as the Mejum's Knees he ad

"Then the Mejum ses the sperrits they had given her commands

They'd like to have the lights out, and we weren't to make no nise!
Well, on this, as you may phansy, we jist had a bit of fun,

Hin course I caught Jane's and in mine, hand then her lips I kissed,
Which 1 said the Sperrits moved me, so she'd better not resist!
"I needn't say much more about our spiritmoviu game,

And I spex as Gals enjies it more than going to the Hopperer,

Considering the
value of our literary
labours (for how long
could Society survive
without its Punch.''),
it becomes a point of
— really national impor-
tance that we should
never in the least be
interrupted in our
work. As our nerves
are rather delicate (fine
minds are in general
attended with fine
nerves) the faintest aud
most distant squeaking of a hurdy-gurdy is sufficient, so to speak, to knock us off
our perch. The very instant that we hear it, the fear of coming horrors com-
pletely overpowers us; and throwing down our pen we make a frantic rush to
our remotest coal-cellar, where with cotton in our ears we tremblingly abide until
we think the danger past. From this our readers may imagine how street-music
in general tormentingly affects us, and we need not undergo the pang of giving
more particulars. Suffice it to add, that were a vagrant pair of bagpipes to strike
up, before we could escape from our study to our coal-hole, the chances are that
Bedlam would receive us the next morning; and it makes us ill to contemplate
the probable result, were a brass band on a sudden to bray beneath our window,
selecting Poor Dog Tray, or some such fiendish tune, to bring out the full effects
of four trombones and a cornopean, in which well-balanced combination about nine
out. of ten of our street orchestras consist.
Levity apart,—and street music is no joke to those who, like us, suffer from
it,—a headache is a luxury which men who live by brain-work seldom can afford
themselves, because indulgence in it totally unfits them for their business. It
is no wonder, then, that writers should complain about street music; for they
suffer in their pocket as well as in their patience from it. How many more good
books might have been given to the world, had German bands and barrel-organs
never been imported, is a point for the Statistical Society to argue, but which
we cannot spare our space at present to discuss.
To take but one example of the losses which are visibly occasioned through
this cause: a considerable proportion of the life of Mr. Bahbage has been
wasted in his sufferings at the hands of these street miscreants, and in his
laudable exertions to summon them to justice. This is no novel story, and
critics may accuse us of commenting on stale news. But in the latest case
reported of him there was a fresh grievance, to which the notice of the Magistrate
was specially directed, and which appears to claim the notice of Mr. Justice
Fokcii. It appeared from the evidence adduced in the Police Court, that certain
most unneighbourly neighbours of Mr. Babbagb took delight in hiring vaga-
bonds to play under his windows, and thus to interrupt the studies which they
had no brains themselves to value. On this disgraceful conduct, Mr. Secker
spoke as follows, with an amount of indignation which all right-minded readers
certainly must share :—
"The complainant was, no doubt, entttlod to tbo peaceful occupation of his home, and so far as
he (the Magistrate) was concerned, he Bhould have the protection he properly claimed and
required from annoyance while in the exercise of his calling. It was not to be endured that
neighbours should eontluue to encourage street musicians for tho solo purposo, as it scorned to
be, of preventing the complainant from studying in his own house; and if they persisted in
it, they would perhaps find that they were liable to an indictment for assisting and abetting
In the nuisance."
There is a childish little game which we remember to have played at, whereof
the fun consists in your obliging the player who sits next you to go through a
great number of corporeal contortions, which vou are gratified to think you have the
power to inflict. 'l>he game is called " Neighbour, Neighbour, I'm going to torment
you!" these words being uttered as a prelude to the mandate which throws your
neighbour's person into a contorted state. Now some such pleasant game as this
appears to have been indulged in by the neighbours of Mr, Babbaoe, who have
malignantly enjoyed the fiendish pleasure of tormenting him by hiring hurdygurdy-
grinders to disturb bim at his work. The only drawback to their pleasure must
have been their inability to witness the contortions which poor tortured Mb.
Babbaoe must have suffered through their means.
To have seen him in despair pacing round and round his
study, with his fingers in his ears, or else fruitlessly endea-
vouring to sit still at his desk and bear his torments like a
martyr, suffering a fresh twinge of pain as every new
squeak reached him, this would have been doubtless as
pleasant to his torturers, as were the shrieks which reached
King Phalaris from the victims he confined in his
burning brazen bull. A picture of Mb, Babbagb as the
Enraged Mathematician must no doubt have been con-
tinually present to their minds, and have afforded them
most probably great pleasure to contemplate. The thought
that what is play to them is death to his desk-labours,
doubtless adds an extra zest to their enjoyment of the fun.
Such persons pay no heed to their duty to their neighbour,
and by urging on t he organ-fiends to worry and torment him,
they rob him of his labour as they rob him of his peace.
To a man like Mr. Babbagb time of course is money, and
any one who robs him of it should be punished as a thief.
In dealing with the organ-men this should be borne in
mind, and culprits who abet them should, as criminis par-
ticipes, be made to suffer for their guilt. There is no
excuse to be made for such offenders, and no extenuating
circumstances to mitigate their punishment. Were Mr.
Justice Punch to be entrusted with the sentence, he
would condemn them to confinement in a solitary cell,
where the fiends they have invoked to torture Mr.
Babbagb should be the sole "companions of their soli-
tude" allowed them. Instead of the hard labour of
grinding at the Crank, they should be made to grind away
at the hand-organ or the hurdy-gurdy, until they were
made sensible of what torture could be caused by it. If
the turning of an organ-handle did not ere long turn their
brains, it would simplv be, we think, because their heads
were empty; and this, considering their conduct with
regard to Mr. Babbage, is a conjecture which there really
seems fair reason for our hazardiug.
SUDORIFIC POPERY.
A Blasphemous rogue of a Roman Catholic Priest
at Naples attempted to create a diversion in young
Bomba's favour at the last moment by getting up a
miracle, consisting in the perspiration of an image meant
for the Virgin. The hoax of the "sweating Virgin" was
exposed; as will, let us hope, be the humbug of the lique-
faction of the blood of St. Januarius. What was the object
of the priest in "sweating" the statue, beyond that of
creating vague terror and alarm among the Lazzaroni, it is
not easy to understand. Such a prodigy would most
naturally be interpreted into a hint to the Bourbon that
Naples was getting too hot to hold him, or else to consider
where he expected to go to, lest his ultimate destination
should be a place where such monsters of wickedness, as
the porter in Macbeth says, have to " sweat for it."
Practical Joke at the Expense of Public Creditors.
We have often poiuted out the absurdity of sending
money to the Chancellor or the Exchequer on
account of Income-Tax which has not been demanded.
Now you see the result of this injudicious practice. The
Government demands a double Income-Tax, the British
impost and the Indian too, on the interest of Indian stock.
The object of Mb, Gladstone probably is to render that
stock a: popular as he is making himself.
HOW TO GET A RIDE FOB NOTHING.
Purchase a penny paper. By jumping on the steps of
the various omnibuses, aud pretending to offer it for sale,
you can easily get a ride from the Bank to Hyde Park
Corner for nothing. If you wish to return, you have only
to take the same steps backwards.
TUB PLAT 8 THE THING.
"All work and no play, makes John a dull boy," as
Mr. Bull remarked to the languid Mourner over the
prosperity of the Drama.
Humane Aspiration.—Mat more blood be spilt in the
establishment of Italian liberty, but may it be only the
blood of S. Januarius!

THE SAINT AND THE HERO.
Ye holy knaves, to whom the crowd
In stupid adoration knelt,
To see, whilst abject heads they bowed,
The blood of Januarius melt:
A greater miracle behold
Than that of simulated gore,
Which melts when hot, congeals when cold,
But which your silly dupes adore.
Ye know how Italy has been,
Thank most yourselves, for weary years,
Of slavery a mournful scene—
A wretched land of blood and tears.
Her best blood ne'er had ceased to drip.
Her tears continued still to flow,
Beneath the rule of sword and whip,
Since Freedom perished long ago.
But now. as Gabibaldi speeds,
To Italy, from hills to shore,
Restoring Liberty, she bleeds
And weeps, except for joy, no more.
False jugglers, he outdoes ycur art;
His honest truth excels your lie:
His hand has healed her wounded heart;
Her blood is staunched; her tears are dry.
NEW IRISH EXODUS.
The Dublin Correspondent of a morning paper states
that :—
11 The English steamers sailing from Belfast, particularly those
trading to Fleetwood, convey weekly to the sister island upwards of
1000 young and lean geese."
His Holiness the Pope, therefore, does not get all the
Irish geese, and by far the greater number of those which
are good for anything at all are exported to England.
Moreover, the young and lean geese that go to England get
fat and fit for the table, whereas, of those which Ireland
sends to Rome, the greater part return leaner, and not
much older, than they went.
A Good Suggestion.
Let the Statues, which at present encumber the streets
of London, and the antiquities, which are lying perdus in
the cellars of the British Museum, change places. The
Metropolis would be sure to be the gainer. It would be
a sweeping bargain, that wonld have the singular merit of
resulting in a profit to both sides. The cellars could not
lose, and the streets must win. Our only regret would
be, that by this exchange we should lose our beautiful idol,
George the Fourth!
GEOMETRY OF THE FASHIONABLE "WORLD.
Among the fashionable announcements of the Post one day lately, the
peculiar properties of the circle in relation to the superior classes were
instanced in the cases of several members of the aristocracy. A right
honourable gentleman and lady, and a duke, were represented as about
to receive, respectively, "a select circle of friends." Another duke
was described as "surrounded by a select family circle." In reading
this last sort of notification, we are sorry to say we are always reminded
of an incident which occasionally occurs in that not very select circle
the ring at Astley's, when the Clown tries to slip a noop over the
Riding Master, but the Riding Master slips it back over the Clown,
before Mr. Merryman has time to stop himself from saying. "High
diddle diddle the fool in the middle." In this case the fool is sur-
rounded by a circle, and so is the duke in the other, only the Clown's
circle is that through which the horseriders jump, and the Duke's is
a select family one. Yet both circles may be said to be of the eques-
trian order. The Duke is the centre of a circle, so is the fool; they
are alike in that point which the centre of a circle is defined to be.
Now if a fool is the centre of a circle of spectators, the circumference
of that circle must consist of persons who are some degrees removed
from a fool, if they are not very wise; but this remoteness from the
fool is simply local, and they may be all as great fools as the fool
himself. But the circumference of which the Duke is the centre is a
circumference formed by persons of quality, and their quality ought to
be uniform, because every part of the circumference-of a perfect circle
is equidistant from the centre, and if a select circle is not a perfect-
circle, what is? Therefore, if they are not all Royal personages, so as
to be distant from the Duke by a degree of superiority, they ought to
be all Earls, so as to be one remove from his Grace interiorly, or else
all Marquesses, or Earls, and so on, and the lower their rank the larger
the circumference would be, because the farther distant from the
centre; which is absurd.
Why will fashionable neTvsmen persevere in the solecism of denomi-
nating the guests of individuals of the upper ranks circles P Divers of
the nobility and gentry might be properly said to represent a square in
which they are householders; but if this is the square of a circle, there
has been solved a problem which will soon be followed by the combus-
tion of the Thames. Why resolve high life exclusively into spheres P
Why not as well say that such a nobleman entertained a select oval,
or a distinguished ellipse? Would that be too eccentric P Why not
arrange the society entertained by a given aristocrat into oblongs
or rhombs P Perhaps because it is necessary to imply, that the great
creature around whom visitors revolve as it were in a circle or orbit
is a sun, the source of light and warmth to the planets which he
entertains.
NOTIFICATION TO THE FAITHFUL.
S. S. Alban and Legeb.—In consequence of the event of the 12th
instant, the Festivals of these saints will henceforth be celebrated on
the same day. N. Wiseman, his X mark.

LOGIC FOR LADIES.
BY ONE OF THEM.
-^§^^m ou will excuse any apology for my
"^P^BSgsSSB^i^ta, Preseu'; dissertation, ana I shall
JS^K^^^^^r assign only one particular reason
*or wr''''nB on B.e«son in general.
^MOESV ^BLItuS^t* Ladies ought to be fine logicians;
FUKraR W&rC*' *°r> "Aether they deal with Majors
lm7WjgF / JoN or Minors, they have, generally
^Jpk/^S fi«& speaking, a perfect mastery over the
^•fljft ^ Logic teaches us to train our
X^wm^"^ mental faculties, so that we may
jBffljT' firmly hold the thread of our dis-
JP^m course, and prevent it getting into a
fil H tangle. Under its guidance alone we
V\ Wr*l^^^ draw from sound premises a safe con-
* ^^-•/f'mZWr elusion. If people's premises are un-
f rf'^fli tenable, tliey must necessarily break
'• • . f'T% iBv^—down, just as if an Alderman and
^=jjjjr=^j^j| ■fl|t'_ his august consort were to dance a
^9Sa>^'rJ7.-'W^^^ pas de fascination in one of our
_^J-^^^^f^ -*^Jt\ modern compoed villas; assuming
(as we may) the premises to be un-
Bound, one can easily predicate with what a disaster such an imprudent
step must conclude.
Of mental operations there are these, three: simple apprehension,
judgment, and discourse or reasoning. Thus, if a lady's hoop should
entrap a gentleman's hat and carry it out of a church-pew, it is simple
apprehension; but it requires judgment to drop it gracefully at the
Eorch, and logical acumen to prove that such an abduction is sanctioned
y the law of licensed carriers.
A syllogism is reasoning expressed in propositions, and every argu-
ment brought on the tapis is reducible to that scholastic form:
You say, Cakrt, that at eleven o'clock
I ought not to commence another cigar;
But it is not eleven—it wants three minutes.
By your own showing, then, I ought to commence another cigar.
This is manifestly a reduciio ad absurdum, and if Caroline, under
such an insult to her reason, were to remain dumb, it would be still
more absurd. She rejoins, mildly of course, "You know, Charles,
my feelings as to cigars: the smoke enters the nursery, and makes
little Ellen cough!
Charles (loquitor). Oh! very well; if you object to cigars, I '11 put
up with my hookah.
What logicians call this mode of reasoning I cannot precisely say,
but, I strongly suspect it must be the argumentum 'baccolinum!
In every syllogism we find an antecedent and a consequence, which
sometimes lead to strange and contradictory results; for example:—
Wealth is an essential antecedent to consequence.
Dobbs's wealth is clear, though his antecedents are very obscure.
Dobbs's antecedents, therefore, are of no consequence.
Syllogisms are simple or compound. A dear friend at whose
suggestion I undertook this essay, has favoured me with some simple
syllogisms from her elegant pen—here is one:—
All men are heartless.
A Parrot is not a Man.
A Parrot, therefore, is not heartless.
Again:—
Bed whiskers are deceitful.
Lionel Ltnx's whiskers are tawny.
Lionel Lynx is very deceitful.
Therefore—Tawny whiskers are red.
This {par parenthise) I may observe is one of Sophy's sophisms.
One more:—
Young married people cannot live on less than six hundred a-year.
Edwin and Maria married on five.
Therefore—Edwin and Maria cannot live.
I must beg pardon for introducing my urbane reader to so dogmatic
an author as Dr. Samuel Johnson, whose works, let me note {en
passant), hold a lofty though not very prominent position in every modern
bookcase. I have heard that Dr. J. wrote a romantic drama called from
its biting humour bong, but, never having read it, I cannot say con-
fidently that, he did. To tbis sonorous Pundit, however, we are indebted
for a charming syllogism, which all lovers of real enjoyment will, I feel
certain, cheerfully endorse:—
Matrimony lias its cares.
But—Celibacy has no pleasures.
Those will embrace matrimony, therefore, who prefer pleasure to care.
I regret, from a humane feeling, that my kind printer cannot con-
veniently illuminate these glorious truisms with letters of gold.
Some compound syllogisms are very ridiculous. Here is one in
which absurdity and conceit are equally mixed:—
Fanny's pin-money, under her settlement, is so much a year.
Mamma thinks this too little.
I think with Mamma.
Papa thinks it too much.
Henry thinks with Papa.
Whatever, therefore, may be the value of my opinion and
Mamma's,
The opinion of Papa and Henry is not worth a pin. Q. E. D.
Bcasoning in a circle is very fashionable; for instance:—
Those who marry for rank alone, are certain to repent.
Miss Lofty married for rank alone.
Miss Lofty, then, is certain to repent.
But—Lord Toddy is very old.
Oh! then Lord Toddy, not Miss Lofty, is certain to repent.
This, I think, might more properly be called Tea-table logic, as I
have frequently met with it at Soirees, both in London and Bath.
The suppressio veri and the suggestio falsi next merit our attention.
When Lady Ogle tastefully trains her auburn ringlets over one eye,
so as to conceal a certain visual aberrat ion, I call this a suppressio peri;
but when Sir Nathaniel assures me he has no need of glasses, it is a
suggestio falsi, because I know that he has one, and a very good
imitation it is too.
Of dilemnas, properly so designated, I shall not treat; for, as little
RorERT, my nephew, would say, it's uo treat for any lady to handle
them—looking at their terrible horns. In lieu of a dilemua, however,
my gentle student will please to accept a tender perplexity.
A white hand shows a tender heart.
That should be loved which shows a tender heart.
A young Divine has a white hand.
A young Divine then—
But no; that young Divine a wealthy widow woos.
Therefore—A tender heart must not be loved.
In conclusion, let me add that, much as I admire Logic, I would
rather praise my Nieces for making mince-meat than for chopping it.
Woman has her mission, and it is better that her mind should be
absorbed in knitting than in gathering wool. Of course I do not
recommend either pursuit, as Woman's special province is making tics.
FATHER TOM'S HINT TO ST. JANUARIUS.
Oh, blessed St. Bridget, it's you that should fidget,
And for Holy Church look mighty solemn and sarious,
Now thim snakes in the Times are completin' their crimes,
By abusin' that darlin' ould Saint Januarius!
Deridin'—the vagabones!—each holy bag o' bones,
Relics of martyrs and Saints of antiquity;
They 're for puttin' his phial on chemical trial,
As if testiu' Saint's blood wasn't haythin iniquity!
On that holy King Francis the wicked advances,
Under black Garibaldi—the Church's worst ininiy—
But it's they 'll catch a Tartar, when that blessed martyr
Roises up in his shroine to arrest them in limine!
The 19th of September—it's well to remember—
Is the day that his blood undergoes liquefaction:
It's myself will go bail, it's been ne'er known to fail,
Since the Saint was a Saint, and the Church was in action.
But with heretics wroitin', and heretics foightin'.
To sweep down the Church and the King that s set o'er them,
Was I Saint Januarius, I'd sure be contharious,
And see them at blazes afore I'd melt for them.
Though all Naples was lyiu', a-roarin' and cryin',
"Holy Saint, be propitious, and melt as you used to do!"
I'd say, "Metro Saihana*' my blood shall remain as
The hard clot that's in it, in spite of your deuce to do."
For the miracle shown by the Church to its own,
Is that clot turuiu' liquid, widout foire to melt it;
But the miracle wanted to make sinners daunted,
Is the clot's keepin' hard, till their hard hearts have felt it.
Sure the heretic crew will cry out, it's a doo—
That it don't melt, because no priest's hand warms the phial;
But lave them to prache—sure the faithful 'twill tache,
That our Saints won't have heretics put 'em on thrial!
Musical Announcement.—The Court Circular informs all persons
enjoying an ear for sweet sounds, that "Prince Arthur went to the
Falls ot Quoich." This is a waterfall where one would expect to find
no end of ducks.

CAP-A-PIE.
"Oh, look here, Billy; here's a Swell with a Pork-Pic on his head I"
THE NON-PRODUCTIVE CLASSES.
BT A DOMESTIC ECONOMIST.
Where is that solitary Stoic who can contemplate witn-
out emotion those rusky mountains (with summits and
bases equal in breadth and digestibility) which are annually
consumed by our native infantile population P—or who can
look unmoved upon those Comos of caudle, and Mediter-
raneans of milk and honey, which serve to mollify so large
and tender a body of Vegetarians P Breathes there a man
with soul so dead in modem Babylon P If such there be,
go mark him well; and remind him, with a tender gravity,
now lambs offer their dewy fleeces that rosy feet may be
comfortably shod,—how pine forests make their best
boughs supply the mimic cuckoos, milkmaids, and arks by
which tranquillity is ofttimes not dearly bought,—while
ocean's darkest caverns resign without a murmur the coral
(sweetest of anodynes) which cools the fiery temper and
soot hes the irritable gum.
From official sources, we learn what vast additions are
continually being made to the large section of our Non-
productive Classes. Surely for all these tiny bands our
sagacious statesmen could devise some employment that
would come within their grasp. We have various light-
houses maintained at much trouble and cost. Suppose in
place of them we were to establish nurseries into which
t he Martello Towers on our Kentish coast might readily
be converted. I'll be bound that my Mary Anne (eetat.
seven months) if a hurricane were blowing in-land, would
warn off a vessel at the distance of a mile—her voice being
of such penetrating timbre, and her passion at bed-time
above all praise.
Another useful end might be attained by these Martello
nurseries. Not only migut a fleet be saved, but an enemy
frightened away. Those who were cradled on the land
would have little to fear from those who were cradled on
the deep. My Mary Anne alone, with her piercing treble,
could shield Folkstone from invasion, for Cssar himself
would pause ere he attempted to seize her. Nor let our
patriotic Riflemen despise these vocal Volunteers. Though
in point of discipline they may not quite come up to that
high standard which some stern old Generals demand, I
think with a little training this new body of infantry would
at all times be ready to present arms; and, ticklish as they
may be. I feel assured that no prudent parent will make
light of their charge.
LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS.
A Piquant Report has just reached us from that loquacious little
Bird of nursery fame who is so notoriously given to eaves-dropping.
It describes a conversation, at which our twittering reporter was
present, having promiscuously dropped in among the sprigs of floral
fashion, with whose diction young Bird, from his position, is conversant
in most of its branches. Their language, sqmewliat flowery, is cast in
a good garden mould, and would not discredit colloquists in any walk,
—gravel or grass; while their knowledge of political on dits might lead
one to surmise that they were mixed up more with Clubs than Spades.
We confess that the peep thus afforded us into the secrets of the
parterre has largely opened our literary eyes; for we never expected to
find so much genuine fun cropping out among the pinks of Wanical
society.

Lily. I suppose he expects to get something out of them.

leaf.

first wife.

Tulip. For my part, I'd rather not mix with individuals of such
humble extraction.
Rose. Nor I.

Lily. Certainly not j to taste whitebait is a duty partly official,
unless indeed you became Lord Chancellor.

Lily Oh! then you would have on your table a great seal.
Violet. How nice!
Lily. Chacun a son gout. I shouldn't mind being Lord Paramount
if they would give me that large House (fitted up to please my own
fancy) near Parliament Street.
Tulip. That house, I hear, is not a particularly clean one.
Lily. Indeed? It ought to be, considering how much rubbish has
,been thrown out of it.
Rose. I thought it was converted into a Reformatory for boys.
Lily. So it is, and many of them are very much corrupted.
Violet. Else I suppose they couldn't get in—how do they chiefly
occupy their time P
Lily. Oh! standing on forms and making speeches!
Tulip. Is that all?
Lily. Well, I believe they are employed occasionally in making out

From Tyrone rich raiment;

In regard of payment!
If the tax they flung off,
He but laid it on again,
And defaulters swung off
His gallows-tree in Monaghan.
Sore his hand was heavy,
And his Court uproarious;
Kings came to his levee,
And with him got glorious.
So in state and bounty

And to guard his valleys
From the mighty Brian,
Summoned Danish allies—

Many times the warriors
Drove each other's cattle,
Ere at Clontarf's barriers
They drew out to battle.
How produce an image
Of that great destruction P
How describe the scrimmage?
How portray the 'ruction?
Wid their battle-axes,
Fiercely both did strain 'em,—
One to fling off taxes,
T'other to maintain 'em.
Till Boroimbe's heart bursted,
He his foe did maul so,
But the Danes were worsted,
And Maelmora also.
Brian's corse was hurried
Unto Armagh's borough,
There the King they buried,
Likewise his son Mureough!
Royally they waked him,
Twelve days and twelve nights there,
The big rath * they staked him,
Still doth glad our sights there!
There the great King Brian
In his vestments royal,
To this day is lyin'—

To t he Bard's quick hearin'—
"On thou great descendant,
Of O'Brinb, O'Connor—

In the path of honour!

In my hist'ry's sequel.
Nothin ever stopp'tf bitn
On the way to plundther;
No lay flattery sopp'd him,

Over oath and o'er word,
Over constitutions,

Conscience no reprovins,
Policy no errors,
Pity no wake movins!
Silent, self-relyin',
Still his word is "thorough,"—
Such was I, King Brian,
Such was my son Murroogh!
Oaths it's we would kick at,
Plots—we would out-plot them;
Ends once fixed, we'd stick at
Nothing till we got them!
Such the chief, M'Mahon,
—If he's my. true scion,—
Well may help his way on,
Blessed by me, King Brian.
While the land 'tis laid on,
My Boroimhe still gathers,
To gird the chief a blade on
Worthy of his fathers!"
ELEGANT EXTRACT FROM AMERICAN LITERATURE.
The following choice bit is too good to be lost in a New York
journal, and we accordingly transplant it to our own flowery columns,
in order that the whole world may enjoy the rich bouquet of it:—
"Malf-Gossips.—A female gossip is bad enough in all conscience; but a malo
gossip is, by all odds, the more detestable of the two; spending his time in col-
lecting, from street-corners, saloons, and business places, all the parentheses of
small talk, to scatter broadcast wherever thore is a fiold to sow mischief. Tho
mnlo gossip is always a coward. * * * The toe of a boot is the best thing with
which 'to point the moral and adorn tho talo' of this venomous animal."
The above is signed "Fannt Fern." We always had our doubts as
to Fanny's sex, but after the above choice specimen, we are now
morally convinced that Fanny is decidedly no gentleman. The difficulty
then remains:—Being no gentleman, is she a lady P
Brighter than Venus.
The Star, according to the Sun. is to be incorporated with the Dial.
Accordingly the Dial, instead of being a Sun-Dial, will become a Star-
Dial. If it will enable anybody to tell the time of day, Bright's
particular Star will be wonderfully luminous.

1 CHACCN A SON TOUR.'
TnE papers are recording the progress of the Emperor
through the Provinces he has lately been annexing. As
the heading is no other than the "Imperial Tour," we infer
it must have a sly reference to the tour de force by which
the Emperor got possession of them, la the latter case
it must be, or ought to be, un bien vilain tour.
GOGS AND MAGOGS.
We see with great pleasure that the Government has refused an
application made by some well-meaning gentlemen for a quantity of
metal wherewith to make a statue to the memory of Sir John
Franklin. The monument which Franklin has made for himself is
more durable than brass, and his fame would derive neither extension
nor prolongation from a molten image erected in the market-place.
But even if it would, in case the image were well made, the proposal
to make one would remain objectionable, because we know that the
image would not be well made. There is not one modern statue about
Town that is not a disgrace and an insult, as far as it can be, to the
hero or statesman for whom it is meant. St. Paul's and Westminster
Abbey are full of statues of illustrious persons, nearly all of which
have no merit whatever but that of comicality, whilst many of them
are draped in the ludicrous dress of the last century; and it is fortu-
nate that they are Bituated in the naves and aisles, and transepts of
those churches, and not. in the choir, where service is performed, the
solemnity of which would be entirely destroyed by the sight of figures
apparelled like old gentlemen in a farce.
Even if our sculptors could make good statues of nude or elegantly
draped figures, they would be unable to make any but absurd dummies
out of the suits of clothes with a head at the top of them of which all
likenesses of personages of the present time must consist, represented
either in ungainly uniforms, or civil coats, vests, and pants marked by
imagination with Sydenham 17*. 6rf. It does not mend the matter to
put your hero into a toga. He only looks as if he were going to be
shaved. We can't look, and can't be made to look like ancient Greeks
and Komaus. The classic age was the age of sculpture. That was
the marble and brazen age. This is the wooden age. The propriety of
statues ceased when mankind began to Mister and Monsieur and
Signor, and llerr each other, and the world became comfortable and
ridiculous.
For Antinous, for JuriTER, for Hercules, statues are all very
well. Ut aunt Dtvorum, Mars, Bacchus, Apollo; civorum also, such
heroes as Conon and Lysander aud Alcibiades. But they won't do
for the British Grenadier or the British Sailor. Should Cromwell
have a statue F Perhaps. Cromwell, in his habit as he lived, was
picturesque—may even De looked upon as statuesque. Shall Franklin P
Not by any means, if Punch can help it. Sir John F'ranklin was a
gallant commander; but he was a stout middle-aged man, and, figured
as such, in a naval uniform, his statue would be neither useful nor
ornamental, but on the contrary, a grievous eyesore in any situation
wherein it could be placed, except upon the top of a column like
Nelson's, where its ugliness would be out of sight.
A Lamentable Case.
In the money article of some paper we were painfully struck with
the following distressing fact:—
"No Gold was taken to tho Bonk to-day."
Poor old Lady of Threadneedle Street I Doesn't the reader feel for
her! Fancy her going one entire day without any gold being taken to
her! How did she sleep that night after such an overwhelming blow
of destitution? Might we inquire if it possibly disturbed her "rest" P
A BALMORAL OBSERVATION.
The Court Circular says, that the Queen drove the other dav to tho
Colonel's Cave in Glen Eye. Is this the glen where the Falls of

expect to find a cataract, it is surely Glen Eye.

THE LAY OF THE LAST ARTIST.
Kept in Town, September, 1860.
Oh! how grimy the trees that, one everywhere sees,
As one's rounds in the Squares now one happens to fro;
Oli! how hot and how crabbed, and almost gone rabid,
Is the artist imprisoned in dingy Soho!
Law has quitted his Coke, and has "sported" his oak,
E'en Police Reports now are most wretchedly slow;
There's nought in the papers to drive off the vapours,
And gladden the artist in dismal Soho.
I make calls on old friends, but in sorrow that ends;
"Left town, Sir!"—alas! yes, I feared it was so;
Maulstickb is from home, and H'Guilp's gone to
Rome—
Ah! a Village Deserted is gloomy Soho!

Tonemdown,
And old Tomkins, whose " high-lights " are sadly so-so,

While I am imprisoned in dreary Soho.
Models all are at rest, and not one's in request,
From piquant Miss Poser to pretty Miss Snow;
And the Pugilist brawny, and Hindoo so tawny,
Lounge at large now in publics in vacant Soho.
I avoid the display in the windows so gay
Of Winsob and Newton, and Rowney also;
And I shun as the measles the portable easels,
And other art-nicknacks to tempt poor Soho.
My picture's not sold: bad luck to those old
Curmudgeons who placed it so horribly low;
To the Hanging Committee is due this sad ditty,
Of the artist imprisoned in stagnant Soho.
But for this, the nice girls, whose far-flowing curls
In the breezes of Brighton so pleasantly Wow,
Would (in spite of my wife) have been sketched to the life

BETTING ROGUES AND THEIR BETTERS.
At the Old Bailey, the other day, a Mb. Robebt Batten, aged 26,
a poulterer, having pleaded guilty to the charge of embezzling £75,
the money of Edwabd Weathebby, his master, received sentence of
eighteen months' seclusion, with the addition, we may presume, of
compulsory bodily exercise. Perhaps Mb. Batten would have had to
apply muscular power to the crank for a somewhat longer period if he
had not made restitution to the amount of £36. He attributed his
deviation from the path of rectitude to that of roguery to the practice,
which he had adopted, of betting on horse-races.
The example set by noblemen and gentlemen, patrons of the Turf,
is sometimes represented as the cause which induces shopboys, ware-
housemen, clerks and other persons in such a situation as that of Ma.
Batten, to turn first gamblers and t hen, by the most natural of tran-
sitions, thieves. This representation may be true, but if we did not
know that inferior snobs are prone to ape superior snobs, we should
think it was a mistake. A poor snob lies under a greater temptation
to gamble than a wealthy snob, just as he is subject to a greater
temptation to steal. Betting, as one form of gambling, might, like
theft, be expected to be the peculiar vice of the necessitous. It seems
reasonable to believe, that many a betting man, and many a thief, in
narrow circumstances, would have been a respectable member of
Society if he had been well off. The presumption is, that he bets or
steals, or first bets and theu steals, from the incentive of want. On
the other hand a Swell has no motive to induce him either to
steal or to bet except mere covetousness: so that if he steals it is
because he is naturally a thief. But then he would also be a natural
born fool to steal whilst surrounded with pleasure and plenty, and
risk reputation, liberty, luxury, and even comfort. Therefore he bets
instead of stealing, because by betting he hazards only money, which,
being of a sanguine temperament, he does not expect to lose. If you
can assign any more reasonable explanation of the fact, that gentlemen
of wealth and station do addict themselves to betting, like the poul-
terer's man who got eighteen months, candidly impart it, if not, adopt
the foregoing together with Mr. Punch.
A WISE COUNCILLOR.
"Nat, if thou art joking Deputy-Lieutenants,"—roars Sir Tunhelly
Clumsy, feeling that audacity can go no further. Mr. Punch regards
the art of joking Town Councillors as almost as atrocious, and in no
light spirit extracts the following from a letter read before the Council
of Rothesay, in Scotland. That awful body has some shooting to let,
and a gentleman named Combie was one of those who offered to take
the same. He wrote:—
"I make offer of two gulnoas a year for tbo shootings on the grounds belonging
to the burgh of Rothesay. I consider the above a fair rent for the first year, as Mr.
Ewiko has hardly left a loot or wing upon tbo ground, but as it is necessary for mo
to have some exercise and oxcitemunt to enable me to fulfil the duties of a coun-
cillor in a proper and becoming manner. Should there be a bona fid* offer, or "tiers,
higher than mine. I am willing to give a few shillings above the highest oner."
The construction of the most interesting sentence may be defective,
but Mr. Punch can see no reason for the "loud laughter" which is
reported to have followed the perusal of this letter. Mr. Punch, who is
the "Councillor" of the nation, feels that even He requires "exercise
and excitement" to enable him to fulfil his duties "in a proper and
becoming manner," and he heartily sympathises with Mb. Cohhie.
Moreover, he admires that gentleman's wide-awake-ishness, which led
him to suspect that the Rothesay Town Council would try the dodge
of pretending to receive higher offers, in order to "run him up." The
stipulations that he would advance on a bond fide proposal only is truly
charming. For their own reasons, however, the Council would not let
him have the shooting, and Mr. Punch hopes that the worthy Councillor
will find feet, wings, exercise, and excitement, elsewhere; for nobody
can work without holidays—the grandest discovery of modern soience.
The Support of Italy.
Tint Italians, desirous of having only One Italy, keep shouting
"Una! Una!" If Italy is alluded to as the Una, then Garibaldi
must be the faithful Lion that is to carry Una through, and protect
her from all danger.

[September 29, 1860.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE POLITICAL HARVEST.
iors are gettingsafely housed
throughout the country,
thanks to the fine weather,
and the harvest is a better
one than might have been
expected. Indeed we learn,
that on the whole, it will
turn out very little, if at all,
below the average; and the
croakers who predicted that
famine would ensue, will
now have to eat their words
in the shape of good sub-
stantial quartern loaves, or
cottage ones. We regret
to say, however, that no-
thing has occurred to cause
any amendment in the legis-
lative harvest, which, as our
readers are aware, has fallen
sadly short of the public ex-
pectations, and has severely
disappointed those who held
high hopes of it. The crop
of measures that was pro-
mised was unusually plenti-
ful, but several of them
were blighted very early in
the season; and of those
which have survived, but
very few we fancy will
prove to have been worth the cost and labour of their housing. Whether the
deficiency has been caused by the wet weather, which may have somewhat damped
the legislative ardour of our senators, is a point which we may leave to those
who like it to debate. It is quite certain, however, that mnch less corn than chaff
has been produced this year in Parliament, and until some steps be taken to check
this growing evil, we incline to fear that future legislative harvests will be scarcely
more prolific than that which is just past. Chaff is certainly at times a service-
able commodity, but we hardly think it right to waste a session in producing it;
and indeed there is no question that., like as in the corn-field, so in the field of
politics, a lot of chaff is found attended with a length of ear.

THE GUNNER'S RULE OF THUMB.
A Letter in the Times, signed William Kenrick,
8.F.V.G., contains a statement of the fact, that three
sailors in Her Majesty's Service have had their thumbs
blown off in firing salutes, through stopping the vents of
68-pounder cannon with those members instead of spikes
of brass, lignum vita?, or boxwood, covered with India-
rubber or gutta-percha; implements which would effectually
and safely render the vent air-tight. The writer wishes
that, if there is any better method of serving the vent of a
cannon than that which he proposes, some scientific
engineer should be invited to devise it. Certainly a
sailor's thumb is the most expensive of all possible vent-
stoppers for a cannon; to say nothing of the inconvenience
of losing his thumb to the sailor. Bereft of his thumb,
he ceases to be an able-bodied seaman; and the Naval
Service has not yet become so popular that it can well
afford to lose a hand, which it does lose when au able-
bodied seaman loses his thumb. Besides, when one able-
bodied seaman at the vent of a GS-pounder loses his
thumb, another at the muzzle runs a great risk of losing
his arm. So great is this risk, that any reflecting man
would strongly object to load a piece of ordnance which he
knew was perhaps only prevented from going off in the
process by the accurate pressure of another man's thumb
on the vent.
Sailors, now-a-days, are reflecting men, many of them,
insomuch as to be unwilling to expose themselves to quite
unnecessary mutilation. Intrepid as the British sailor is,
he is much more likely to hold a gutta percha stopper
steady on a cannon's vent, than a stopper consisting of his
thumb. The rule of thumb is generally objectionable, but
never can it be more so than when it is applied to stop the
vents of great guns, which, it is to be hoped, the Admi-
ralty will adopt some more scieutific. effectual and cheaper
method of stopping than that woieu frequently exposes the
sailor to the risk of having his thumb blown off. An
invitation to enter the Navy, addressed to a seafaring but
judicious youth, may otherwise very commonly be replied
to by an extension of his fingers from his thumb applied to
the tip of his nose.
A DULL OUTROARED.
To the Beyrout Correspondent of the Times the British Public is
indebted for the publication of an edifying pastoral, said to have been
issued by the Maronite Bishop of Tyre ana Sidon, and breathing the
most pious sentiments, of a species similar to those which are expressed
in the passage following:—
"Now there baa been a general meeting on the mountains of Lebanon of tho
Chiefs of the people of Zableh, Deir-el-Kammar, Keserawan, Jezztn, and of the
neighbouring places, that they will be as one hand agaiDst this nation (Druses),
■malt In numbers aud weak, in destroying them, in shedding their blood, and in
taking their goods and possessions, and in driving them from out of the land which
before was that of your forefathers, the orthodox nation."
...lical author of the above evangelical announcement goes
iform his flock—of sheep or wolves P—that
"There has come a letter from his Holiness our Lord the exalted Patriarch,
Inatructing us to aid the aforesaid people (Maronites of Rasbeya) as they may
determine; and for this purpose came the letter, that you may be every one of you
provided with the neceasary arms."
This holy exhortation bears the signature and seal of the "humble
Sefhbonius, Bishop of Tyre and Sidon;" the seal no doubt being one
of pantomimic magnitude. It is indeed a very good imitation of a
roaring papal bull. The affectation, bombast, and mock humility
which it is replete with, give it a close similarity to the "allocutions
and "encyclical letters," of which Europe is sick. The subjoined
brief extract reads, however, like an Irish Maynooth Priest'i interpo-
lation in a pontifical edict :—
"It la determined here that on Monday next there shall be fighting."
The writer here drops down from the flowery height of ecclesiastical
rhetoric to the expression of common ruffianism in the vulgar tongue.
He had probably assumed a character that he could not sustain. Pos-
sibly, then, his alleged episcopal epistle was the forgery of a clever
Druse, who wanted to get the origin of the late massacres in Syria
imputed to the Maronites. He describes himself as writing under
orders from his Holiness our Lord the exalted Patriarch. Now his
Holiness the Lord of the Maronite mongrel Christians happens to be
not the Patriarch of Constantinople, but on the contrary, his Holiness
the Pope op Home. A Druse would be likely enough to confound
those two hierarchs. We can hardly suppose that Pio Nono per-
sonally commanded Schmidt to sack Perugia, or has ordered Lamoki-
ciere to subject the towns of his insurgent subjects to pillage. As
little can we imagine him capable of issuing such instructions as the
above, declared to have been received by the humble Sefhronius.
And then the Sephronian imitation of the Papal balderdash is a little
too strong of savage Orientalism. Let us cherish, therefore, the cha-
ritable hope, that the self-styled "humble" Semronius was, in reality
the humbug Sephronius, or some other designing humbug of a
heathen who assumed that name. But, heathen or bishop, Sefhbonius
is evidently a humbug.
GARIBALDI PAINTED BY A YOUNG LADY.
A Young Lady, writing as enthusiastically as young ladies generally
do, portrays Gakibaldi as "a dear old weather-beaten angel." We
doubt if angels care much about the weather, considering they are
always living in the open air, and are not generally represented as
having much clothing about them, though, on the other hand, it is
agreeable to picture Garibaldi as an angel—an avenging angel for
the long-endured wrongs of Italy—the angel of deliverance for the
long-suffering martyrs of Naples. However, granting (and to a young
lady we are always ready to grant everything) that Garibaldi is "a
weather-beaten angel." it is a comfort to know that as yet he has never
been beaten by anything else.

FOREIGN LYRICS OF LOW LIFE.
"Sib,
"Being at an evening party lately, and having sustained a severe
infliction of young-lady singing, a thought came into my head. I said
to myself, "These British Ladies have been for the last two hours
chanting about the supposed characters, feelings and habits of conti-
nental parties of the inferior class. We have heard The Muleteer.
The Oondolier, 11 Pescatore, Le Postilion, The Boatman of the Darda-
nelles, The Sledge-Driver, The Tauridor, and a heap of other sentimental
portraitures of people who, if they were not foreigners, we should
never think of singing songs about. I wonder whether foreign ladies
and gentlemen pay our humble classes the same compliments, and do
so with the accuracy of detail with which our Lyric Bards describe the
folks our vocalists are so fond of F' And, Sir, prosecuting the subject,
I learned, on inquiry at foreign music-shops, that the same class of
subject is as popular abroad as at home. I have obtained a mass of
songs much chanted in Paris, Madrid, and St. Fetersburgh, in which
our cabmen, policemen, engine-drivers, beadles, watermen, and others,
receive the same elegant and accurate treatment for the continental
saloons, as the corresponding classes on the continent receive here.
In the hope of promoting good feeling among the nations by illustrating
this reciprocity, I have translated three or four of these .Foreign

Proud of lineage from the Ark F
Answer made the brave Beef-Eater,
Glancing sadly at Saint Paul's,
"Truer maid than Jane, or sweeter
Walks there not by London's walls.
But my office, gentle stranger,
Calls me from my lady sweet,
Of this Park the Irish Ranger
I must haste to join the Fleet."

"STEP IN. AND BE DONE, SIR!"
A PRETTY SAFE PROPHECY.
In the Memoir* of Bishop Hard, recently published, we meet with
the following prophecy. It is rarely that prophecies are so strictly
fulfilled, and this rarity is the cause of our alluding to this particular
one. Dr. Cumming must gnaw his fingers with envy:—
"Shortly after hia arrival at Hartlebury, she said to him one day, 1 How do you
think your pupil, hia Royal Hiqunesi the Prince of Wales will turn out?'—' My
dear Cousin,' the Bisbop replied, laying his peculiarly small white hand {enparen-
thisc. Is it not a great peculiarity with Bishops that they mostly all have peculiarly
small white hands ?) upon her arm, ' 1 can hardly tell; either the mott polished
aenileman, or the most accomplished blackguard in Europe,—possibly an admixture of
both.'"
And we all know how the Bishop's pupil, his Blessed Majesty
George the Fourth, did turn out. The prophecy was a pretty safe
one, it was sure to be true on one side or the other, and the result
proved it. Was he not universally acknowledged to be the most
polished gentleman in Europe F polished, as a boot is with blacking—
for his memory has received nothing else. It is true that Europe has
since reversed its own verdict, and rather leans now to the opinion
that, instead of being the most accomplished gentleman, the Prince
was rather the reverse. Thus, Bishop Htjrd was doubly right with
his double-barrelled prophecy—the Prince was "possibly an admixture
of both"—a kind of "Prince's Mixture," that contained a very large
proportion of "Blackguard." It is not often that Bishops can see bo
far; but then Bisbop Htjrd had such a brilliant pupil!
The Art of Correspondence.
With men, the great difficulty is in beginning a letter—with women,
the great difficulty is in leaving off. A woman's letter is best
expressed by the algebraical "x," for it's a letter that always denotes
an unknown quantity. Every postscript is a problem of itself.

Again the hills of Italy
Echo the din of war,
Again the eagles gather
To Rome, from near and far,
Again the seven-hilled city,
The conqueror's guerdon stands,
But not, as erst, with conquest's sword
Held in Barbarian hands I
When Home, an infant giant,
First crowned her seven-fold height.
The stalwart North its swarms poured forth
To crush the rising might.
There strode the swarthy Cymry,
The red Gaul at his side,
And tower and town went helpless down,
Before the sweeping tide.
But Heaven's high purpose needed
That rising Roman power,
And nerved the stately senators
To meet the awful hour.
In robes of white, on chairs of state,
They barred the invaders' way—
'Gainst Cymric fire and Gaulish ire,
A weaponless array!
BRENNUS AT THE SCALES.
How changed the men, how 'change J the parts
The scene alone the same.
Now Heav'n strikes with the invaders,
And works the invaded shame.

For senate stern and grave!
Still holdeth well the parallel—
Like in unlikeness all—
On what is done doth still look on,
A Brennus, chief of Gaul!
Not. frank and bold like him of old,
That led the Cymric horde,
But a masked brow—a muffled hand,
That grasps a doubtful sword!
Again the steel-yard is brought forth,
Again Rome's fate is weighed:
Though other weights are in the plates,
Than those of yore displayed.
Old Rome went free—her ransom-fee,
A thousand pounds of gold,
Now, Europe's hopes against a Pope's
Unequal balance hold 1
Strange, how despite the ill-matched freight
The scales uncertain play,
While still as death, with bated breath,
We watch them as they sway.
And well we know—be't weal or woe
That in the upshot lies—
The scale where Brennus flings his sword
Will be the scale to rise!
Were this a man our wit could scan,
The choice might easy seem;
Small doubt were there which scale would bear
To earth, which kick the beam.
With fear and lies, before our eyes,
'Gainst truth and valour hung,
Were his a hand at our command,
Long since the sword were flung 1
But what is truth and what is rutb,

So molelike, dark, and dim!

VALOTJB PROMPTLY BEWABDED.
An officer, under the signature of Hard Up, complains in the Tunes
that, although the third anniversary of the capture of Delhi has now
elapsed, the prize-money taken on that occasion has not yet been dis-
tributed. Can this be true? Many brave fellows to whom some of
this money was due are dead, and how long will those who are living
have to live to enjoy their share of it? If there is any one labourer
who is worthy of his hire, surely it is that one whose labour consists
in fighting, and who has especially earned a reward by helping to take
a city in his country's service. What difficulty can there be in the dis-
tribution of money in band P If there is none, or none which is in-
superable, in the present case, what words can express the height or
depth of the rascality on the part of those Jacks or Knaves in office
who are responsible for that infamous procrastination which has kept
the heroes who are entitled to the Delhi priie-money out of it so long?

SNOBBISM AND SPOETING.
"Cato Cottage, Peckham.
"Peat Mr. Punch, are you not fond of deer-stalking P I can't say I
am myself; but that's the fault of my physique, and is not to be
regarded as a mental blemish. People generally like best the sports
which they excel in: and nature, when she gave me a protuberance of
person, with a couple of short legs, and—I must add—wind to match,
very clearly did not intend me for a deer-stalker. My long-limbed
friends assure me that the sport is splendid fun, and are so good as to
invite me to their lodges to partake of it; but I don't quite see the
'fun' of scrambling over boulders; of panting up a mountain merely to
pant down again; of scampering over plains, and shambling over stones,
and floundering about in heather some three or four feet high (which
may be easy work, no doubt, to persons with long legs, but is terribly
hard labour to people who have stumpy ones); of sliding down a
precipice, or wading up a waterfall, or crawling along a stream as flat
as you can stoop, with your waistcoat in the water and your very
whiskers wet with it; of sitting in damp clothes upon rocks as hard as
adamant, and crouching behind corners until you get the cramp, and
waiting hours and hours for the chances of a shot, with the odds at
ninety-nine to one that you won't get it, and if you do the odds are
that your priming has got wet and that your rifle will miss fire, or that
you I
when the creature comes in sight that 3
blare away by accident while you are taking aim, and so almost get
imprisoned for having bagged a gillie, or knocked over a gamekeeper.
All this may be preciously good sport to those who like it, but it would
be certain death to a man of my physique; and I think I am quite
justified in restricting my enjoyment to the eating of the game, without
attempting to partake of the pleasure of pursuing it.
"Having a healthy appetite, it delights me nevertheless to hear of
slimmer persons indulging in the sport; not merely because I think it
is a manly, healthful exercise (for those, I mean to say, whom Nature
has adapted for it), but because there is the chance that I may profit
by their labours—venison sent gratuitously being at all seasons pleasant
to receive. Of course I own this last reflection cannot influence me in
hearing of H.R.H. Prince Albert, still, as a loyal British subject. I
am always charmed to hear of his successes as a deer-stalker; ana I
annually devour with an increasing relish the accounts which the
Court Circular affords us of his sport. The history, I must confess, is
somewhat bare and meagre, being limited in general to the statement
that' the Prince this morning went out deer-stalking,' without inform-
ing his admirers how many stags he mastered, or how many shots he
missed. Still, the stalest of stale crusts is better than no bread; and.
hungry as I am for whatever crumbs may fall to me from the Royal
table, the smallest contributions in the way of sport intelligence I
thankfully receive. Every now and then, though, I come across a
paragraph which I find grows yearly more and more perplexing to me,
and as you know everything, I am driven in despair to ask you to
explain it. The following is the passage to which I would refer,
extracted word for word from the Times of the 15th. Those who study
the Court Circular must be doubtless well familiar with it, for. with but
little variation, it annually recurs, and is repeated some naif-dozen
times in every shooting season :—
"Tbo Prince Consort, attended by the Got tie meuin-Waiting, drove to the
Abergeldio woods, which were drivca for deer."
"The driving of the Prince, and the driving of the woods, are things
which I am competent, I think, to comprehend. The only part which
puzzles me in this perplexing paragraph is the yearly introduction of
the Gentlemen-in-Waiting. For the life of me I can't conceive, Sir,
why the Gentlemen-in-Waiting are lugged into the account. As I
read it, the statement bears no sort of reference to any courtly cere-
mony, in which the presence of the Gentlemen-in-Waiting is needful.
When perusing it, I picture the Prince Consort as a sportsman not a
court's-man; and what have deerstalkers to do with Gcntlemen-in-
Waiting? is the question which quite naturally rises to my mind. Do
Gentlemen-in-Waiting attend His Royal Highness for the purpose of
officiating in the place of gamekeepers P Do they carry the Royal
powderflask, and load the Royal rifle, and instruct the Royal sportsman
where he ought to stand, and when he ought to fire, and what he ought
to do supposing he should missP Or do the Gentlemen-in-Waiting
perform tne part of waiters (as their name seems to imply), and
scamper about at lunch-time with napkins on their arms, handing the
Royal sandwich, to subdue the Royal appetite, or the Royal pocket-pistol
to wet the Royal whistle? To an inquiring mind like mine, and one
loyally inquisitive about the Royal movements, a hundred other
questions instantly suggest themselves, of fully equal interest with
those which I have named. But I confine myself to asking—Do you
think, Sir. as a deerstalker, that the Prince gets better sport by going
out attended by these Gentlemen-in-Waitingf And do you think, Sir,
as a subject, that your loyalty is heightened by having mention of such
escort yearly dinned into your ears?
"One of the charms of shooting, at least so far as I, a Cockney,
understand it, is the freedom it affords from the forms of courts and
cities, and the solacing relief of the hour or two of solitude which in
places like the Highlands it is certain to secure. Whether his Royal
Highness appreciates this pleasure, it is not for me to ask; but I am
certain if he does he cannot possibly get much of it, seeing that he
never can enjoy a day out deer-shooting without a pack of Gentlemen-
in-Waiting at his heels. ,
"Believe me, Mr. Punch, with the sincerest loyalty to the Prince
and to yourself,
"A thoroughly Good Subject, though I may be
"A Bad Sportsman."

and that he will do so the very next minute; and, furthermore, that he

BIB KOBEBT THE RASPER/' TEMP. tDWAKD
THE THIRD.
PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXX.—THE FASHIONS OF THE LADIES OF THE
FOURTEENTH CENTURY.
ovelt Woman in the reign of
King Edward the Third
showed as usual that in point
of finery and fashion she natu-
rally belonged to the weaker -
minded sex. Her habits at
this period are described as
being sadly sumptuous and
extravagant, "far passing ye
men in all mannere of arraies."
"Neat, not gaudy," was a
maxim that she paid but little
heed to: and she hardly gave
a thought to the cost of her
costume, so long as she could
manage to get somebody to
pay for it. It is by habits
such as these that Woman
makes herself so dear to all
who have to do with her, and
we have no doubt that the
dressmakers during the four-
teenth century were as terri-
ble to husbands as they are
in the nineteenth.
In Edward's time the
gown or kirtle was still made
with tight sleeves, much the
same as it had been in the
two preceding reigns; and
the mode remained un-
changed throughout the
reign of Richard the Second, which ended (ask the nearest charity
child) with the last year of the century of which we are now treating.
The sleeves sometimes reached the wrist, and sometimes stopped short
at the elbow, and in the latter case had pendent streamers, which were
called tippets, attached to them. We have noticed the same fashion in
the male dress of this period, and as lovely woman is an imitative creature,
we incline to think she did not set the mode, but followed it. "Perhaps
it may be interesting to some of our fair readers, if we specially make
mention, that the gown was now cut rather lower in the neck, and was
worn so long in front as well as in the train a- to require to be held up
when the attempt was made to walk in it. In-
deed the fashion of long trains was now carried
to such lengths, that actually a tract was written
by some dreadful old divine, entitled "Contra
caudai dominarum," in plain English, that is,
"Against the Tails of the ladies." Another
point moreover to notice in the gown was, that
instead of being worn all loose and flowing, it
now fitted closely to the waist, and a protube-
rance was added which we dare not more than
hint at, further than to say, in the smallest of small
type, that a reference is mado to it in a riddle of the
period, which belikens a fine lady to a careful house-
keeper, for 11 shoe maketh a groto hustle aboute a littel
waste." That horrible old fogy, Dowglas,
Monk of G las ton bur , says the women of his
time "dyd wear such straiten cloathes that
they had foxtailes(l) sewed within their gar-
ments for to bolde y™ forth;" but this surely
must have been a scandalous invention of the
holy father, who being a single man, of course
could have known nothing of the secrets of the
toilette.
Like the gentlemen, the ladies took to
wearing at this period the garment called a
cote-hardie, which we have previously described.
For the benefit, however, of readers with short A Trar KVDK DRAW"
memories, we may again state, that the cote ",<J 0T l^™"**™
was a somewhat graceful garment, not unlike
a long pea-jacket, fitting closely to the figure, and reaching about as
far as the middle of the thigh. It was fastened in the front with a
row of large-sized buttons,* nad sometimes streamers from the elbows,
* Buttons were at this time very generally used for whatever wanted fastening;
and indeed were often worn in such profusion that people must have wasted a great
part of their lives in buttoniDg their clothiog. Fairholt speaks of the cotehardie as
having nought extravagant about it, except buttons ; " and judging from the look
of them In some of the old drawings, it seems to have been tho cheese to have them
made as big as cheese-plates, if History repeats itself, so assuredly does Fashion,

and sometimes had a couple of small pockets in the front, in which
the fast girls stuck their hands, no doubt, and did their best, we dare
say, to swagger like the swells.
Another point of resemblance between the dresses of the gentlemen
and ladies at this period was, that the latter often came out in that parti-
coloured clothing to which the notice of the reader has already been
directed. It was no uncommon thing to see a beauty with one sleeve
of blue and the other sleeve of white; and if by any accident her
stockings became visible, it would have been found they were made
also not to match. Like their husbands too, the ladies often bore their
armorial bearings emblazoned on their gowns, which were rendered
thus as hideous as heraldry could make them, with all its curious
menagerie of blue griffins ana green geese.
A loose garment with long skirts, bordered and faced with fur. was
introduced about this period, and worn over the kirtle. The chiefly
curious point about it was that, generally speaking, it had neither
sleeves nor sides; the armholes being made so large, that the girdle of
the kirtle which was worn beneath it was visible at the hips. An
interesting specimen of this sideless sleeveless garment is shown in an
old drawing in the Argentine Collection, representing Queen Philippa
(who has let down her back hair) interceding for the lives of the six
burgesses of Calais; who with halters round their necks arc kneeling
to Kino Edward, with the piteous looks of aldermen when panting a
request for a third helping of turtle, or pleading that their venison has
been sent them with no fat.

EDWARD THE THIRD AND QUEEN FHlUTPA. FROM A SIS IS THE
AHOIXTINE OOLLXCTIOK.
Mr. Strutt, who as a writer on the subject of costume must clearly
be regarded as one of the first walk, quotes an interesting story from
a manuscript of this period, which shows that ladies were at times not
much more sensible in dress, in the reign of Edward the Third, than
in that of Queen Victoria. As the story, although French, has an
admirable moral, we may without imprudence transfer it to our print:—
11 The eldest of two sisters was promised by her father to a young and handsome
knight, who owned a very large estate. The day was appointed for the gentleman
to introduce himself, he not having as yet seen either of the ladies; and they were
duly informed beforehand of his coming, that thoy might bo properly prepared to
receive him. Tho affianced bride, who was the handsomest of the two, being
desirous to show her elegant shape and slender waist to the beat advantage, clothed
herself in a cote-bardie, which sat very strait and close upon her, without any
lining or facing of fur, although it was winter, and exceedingly cold. The conse-
quence was, tbat she appeared pale and miserable, like one perishing with tho
severity of t ho weather; while her sister who, regardless of her shape. Bad attired
herself rationally in thick garments lined with fur, looked warm and healthy, and
as ruddy as a rose. The young knight was fascinated by the girl who had tbe least
beauty and the most prudence, and having obtained her father's consent, proposed
to ber instead of marrying her sister, who was left in single blessedness to shiver in
her finery, and sigh at her sad fata."
This affecting anecdote is related by a Norman knight, named
Geoffroi de la Tour Landry, who recites it in a treatise on morals
and behaviour, which he composed expressly for the use of his
three daughters, and in which occur some curious details respecting
dress. It is not now the fashion for fathers to write books for the
instruction of their children (who would probably not dream of reading
anything so "slow "), but were any Paterfamilias to venture so to do,
we should advise him to insert the story we have cited, and to devote
a page or two to fit remarks upon the salutary moral t hat it points.
The anecdote we think might be most profitably repeated, if it only be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
to illustrate the evils of tight-lacing, which is still one of the weak-
nesses of the weaker sex. Indeed a stronger term than "weakness"
ought to stigmatise such folly, seeing that it sometimes amounts almost
to suicide, for it entails a certain sacrifice of health if not of life. A
"good figure" is no doubt an enviable possession, but its attainment is
too commonly attended with bad health; and husbands as a rule think
far less of fashion than they do of flesh and blood, and are less likely to
be caught by a pair of well-shaped stays than by a pair of rosy cheeks.
Girdles handsomely embroidered and embossed with gold and silver
were generally worn over the kirtle and cote hardie, and were girt
loosely on the hips, and not round the waist. A sort of pouch or
reticule, which was called a gypsire, was worn pendent from the girdle,
occupying much about the same position as the chatelaines which
lately were in fashionable use. As it was tastefully embroidered, no
doubt the gypsire was at times merely worn by way of ornament; and
we learn that a email dagger was occasionally stuck through it, which
doubtlessly was likewise only worn for decoration, or if ever it was
used, it surely must have been for some such peaceful purpose as
piercing a few button holes, or stabbing a plum cake.
The hair was still worn in a fret or caul of golden network, which
sometimes was surmounted by a coronet of jewels, and sometimes by a
wreath of flowers, or
else simply by a veil.
At tournaments,
however, and at pic-
nics (if there were
any) ladies mostly
wore short hoods,
and wrapped round
their heads like cords
the "lirripipes," or
"tippets," which
were the long
streamers depending
from the hoods.
Wimples still re-
mained in vogue for
the protection of the
t nrjat, although they
were not worn so
commonly as during
the last century;but
the ugly clumsy gor-
get, which, we have
seen, was introduced
in the reign of Ed-
ward the First,
appears to have been
kicked into the dust-
hole of oblivion, for
we find no mention
that it was still in use. Coverchiefs or kerchiefs were still worn by
way of head-dress among the middle classes, but by the swellesses it
seems they had mostly been discarded. Chaucer's Wife cf Bath, he
tells us, wore them once a week: and if she had any tendency to
headache, we can soarcely wonder that she did not wear them oftener,
for he expressly mentions that they were "full fine of ground" (what-
ever that may mean) and he adds:—
"I dur&te swere that they wolghed a pound.
That on the Sonday were upon hir hedde:
Hire hosen weren of fine Scarlett redde,
Ful streit yteyed, and shoon full moist and newe."

With the exception perhaps of the wimple and the spurs this des-
cription might have fairly been applied to the Miss Browns, Miss
Joneses and Miss Smiths, who a season or two since were wont to
amble about on donkeys by the sad sea-waves at Ramsgate: for the
round hats which they wore were every bit as broad as bucklers, and
really looked as though they ought to have been worn in a broad
farce.

ing nature, that it is not to be wondered at if he has gone into the

CLUBS AND CHARITIES.
To Mr. Punch.
"Sir, "Club, Pall-MaU, Friday.
"I am ashamed to put a more specific address, for it is a dis-
graceful thing to be in town at such a time as this, but an Irish friend's
having unaccountably forgotten to remit the money for a bill which I
accepted for him as 'the merest matter of forrum' has compelled me
to come up, and all my business friends having in the most unbusiness-
like manner taken themselves off to Southend. Switzerland, and similar
places, I am unhappily obliged to remain ana collect my funds viit et
modii. I am sure that you will sympathise in my humiliation, and be
content to forego the inclosure of a card, which I am aware you usually
insist upon. 1 am a gentleman, Sir, although in town at the end of
September.
Having much leisure, I read all the papers at my club, as much to
avoid the contemptuous looks of such of the servants as are not
grouse-shooting as for any interest I can take in literature at such a
time.
"I perceive that a Reverend Gentleman by the name of Kempe (which
reminds me of Kemp Town, which is bad enough, but better than
London in the autumn) has been publishing a complaint that the Clubs
of London occupy the best parts of the best parishes, but do not con-
tribute to parochial charities, except by sending out their broken meat
to the churchwardens, and such like. The Reverend Gentleman wants
the Clubs to come down handsomely with benefactions.
"Now, upon my life, Sir, one always knew that of all the unhesi-
tating mendicants the parsons are the most unblushing, and that out
of every dozen letters on a fellow's table there is sure to be one from a
Reverend, inclosing a statement that in the parish of St. Miasma,
or St. Fetida-cum-Drains, there is no Church accommodation for eleven
hundred heathens and a half, for whose benefit he sends you a
perforated card, into which you are to insert a shilling of your last
winnings at billiards or poker, and thus bless the residue and remainder.
But, really, when a Reverend Gentleman asks a Club to apply its
subscriptions in aid of the poor-rates, I can only say that he is a
cooler card than the perforated pasteboard.
"Why, Sir, does the Reverend K. know that at this very moment
half the Clubs in London want more billiard accommodation F Does
he know that port wine is getting dearer and dearer every day, and
that it is the bounden duty of every Committee to lay down every good
pipe they can hear of P Does he know, Sir, that we want more warm
baths built P Is he acquainted with the price of tobacco P or does be
need to be told that very few Club cigars are fit to smoke, in conse-
quence of the dearness of the article and the reluctance of men to give
more than eightpence or ninepence for a weed P Is he aware that our
libraries, especially the French novel departments, are far from com-
plete, and that from the absence of duplicate sets a man has often to
wait a couple of days for the last Paris story, especially if an English
dramatic author gets hold of it P Can he have been apprised that Club
servants are very expensive, and that, owing to the insufficient attend-
ance, a fellow has often to wait three minutes before his table can be
cleared and the wine bronght P I am not hostile to the Clergy, Sir,
far from it, and I willingly assume that the Reverend Gentleman is
uninformed of these facts, and that his preposterous proposition would
never have been made had he possessed ampler knowledge. But in
the face of this painful destitution, in the presence of these revolting
details, it is mockery to ask the Clubs to squander funds in charity.
"I do not insist, Sir, upon the impropriety of a Club's making a
public contribution, and proclaiming its almsgiving, though such a
thought might have occurred to a minister of the Establishment. But
charity should be a secret matter, of which the world should have no
knowledge. 'What I give is nothing to nobody' was the admirable
remark of one of the most distinguished Members of Parliament. The
ostentation which would be manifested by Club donations would be most
objectionable to the feelings of Club-men, who are celebrated for prac-
tising the truly Christian virtue of retiring modesty upon the subject
of any good deeds they may do, should they happen to do any.
"I will only add, Sir, that should the plausible but most improper
appeal of the Rev. Mr. Kempe produce any effect upon our Com-
mittee (not that I would wrong them by believing it possible), I, for
one, will leave no stone unturned to eject that Committee from office at
the earliest opportunity, and I have the honour to be, Sir,
"Your very obedient Servant,
"Thomas Antikjemfis."
"P.S. The poor, I am given to understand, have Clubs of their own.
Let them apply there for assistance, if they want it. We occasionally
send the hat round for a Swell—properly recommended by Swells—so

Our friend Maulsticke (38<A "Artists' ") devoUs himself to Strengthening his Left Arm, whicli

Rifle as a Maul-stick, to accustom his arm to the weight of it.
A Glass that will not bear the Morning's Reflection.
An American has patented a glass in which a man can see himself as plainly as others
see him. At present he has not sold a single specimen, for everybody who has looked into
the glass will not believe that the plain object before him could possibly be himself. Loud
and bitter and unmitigated has been the disgust and indignation of everybody, and the con-
sequence has been, that the poor American, believing in his innocence that the object of the
world was to arrive at the truth, has lost largely by his foolish speculation. He is now
trying his hand on a glass that flatters, and expects in a very short time to realise a con-
siderable fortune. To the ladies he intends charging double, for he knows well enough that,
let them be ever bo beautiful, they will never be able to do without it. He has not yet fixed
the price for girls who squint.
SERMONS AND SORE THROATS.
Under the signature of T. B., a correspondent
of the Inquirer discusses a peculiar complaint to
which preachers are liable, and which appears
to be known to those whom it concerns by the
name of "Minister's Sore Throat." T. B. ob-
serves that singers, who exert the vocal organs
much more powerfully than preachers do, are
not subject to this affection, and attributes their
exemption therefrom to the modulations of sound
wherein their performances consist, as con-
trasted with the usual monotony of sermons,
which he supposes to be the cause of the minis-
terial malady. It is possible that harping upon
one string, as it were, of the chorda tocales, may
produce a soreness of the part overstrained. It
is desirable to know whether the "Minister's
Sore Throat" is confined to Dissenting Ministers,
or whether it is an orthodox ailment.
There are certainly some divines other than
nonconformists, who in preaching are wont to
utter such uncouth tones as to grievously offend
the ears of the listener. In the effort of producing
such painful sounds they may also perhaps hurt
their own throats, and serve them right. But
who ever heard a parson of the old school com-
plain of any injury to the throat sustained through
preaching? Did the plump old pluralist with a
red nose ever suffer from "Minister's Sore
Throat" F Yet surely he was monotonous enough
in preaching. But it must never be forgotten
that this kind of clergyman was in the habit oi
keeping the immediate neighbourhood of that
mechanism which is liable to be deranged by
preaching well moistened with a fluid which is
an excellent gargle—port wine. It is very true
that he always drank his gargle. Perhaps also
he did not preach too long. How if the pastors
who suffer from "Minister's Sore Throat" were
supplied by the liberality of those who sit under
them with plenty of the parson's preservative
against that complaint, on condition of their
observance of the same moderation as that which,
on the parson's part, may be supposed to have
been a condition to the efficaoy of the remedy P
A FRIENDLY VENTURE.
"Might I tempt you to venture upon this
orangeP" "I should be happy to oblige you,
Madam," said Leigh Hunt, who was thus being
addressed by a lady, "but I'm afraid I should
fall off." The Prince or Wales, much in the
same way at Kingston and other places in Canada,
would not venture near the Oranges :for fear, not
of falling off, but of falling out. There might
have been a falling off of his popularity, had he
yielded to the insolence of these sour bigots, who
acted infinitely more like meddlers than oranges.
If we were asked to say, what were the Fruits
of Sedition, we should not hesitate for a moment
to reply— The Oranges in Upper Canada."
Another Prophecy Fulfilled!
O" There is but one Punch, and, when needful,
he turns Prophet.
Five years ago, on the Fifteenth of September,

predicted the extinction of the tyranny of Naples
—a prophecy which all who run may read has
been fulfilled. In the Big Cut of that Number
the King op Naples is depicted, with his Crown
toppling off as he makes his hurried exit, in the
midst of an eruption of cannon-balls and bayonets,
belched upon him from Vesuvius, which is blazing

OUR AUSTRIAN SYMPATHIES.
England must fraternise with Austria. Surprising as
this declaration may seem, its truth will be apparent from
the facts, that, for the last ten years the Austrian nation
has paid taxes to the amount of 800,000,000 florins more
than it. did in the ten preceding; that the national debt is
1,300,000,000 florins larger than it. was ten years ago; that
State property valued at 100,000,000 florius has had to be
sold; that the deficit expected in 1861 is 39,000,000 florins
even in case of peace; and that, the people are subject to a
"war-contribution" of 32,000,000 florins p*r annum.
These circumstances are stated in the report of a financial
committee; and what Englishman that reads then can
refrain from exclaiming to his Austrian fellow sufferer,
"Come to my arms, my brother in taxation! Let us
compare what our friend Disraeli calls fl«abites." We
are told that the war-contribution is so exceedingly onerous
that it cannot long be levied. How very like our own
Income-Tax! Perhaps, even as that impost, it is assessed
with the utmost injustice, and levied so as to inflict the
greatest possible inconvenience. Whilst, therefore, John
Bull hugs the Austrian subject of confiscation, Mr. Glad-
stone may embrace the Finance Minister of Austria!

DINNER AND THE LADY.
"Dear Mr. Punch,
"I Did hope that we were going to hear no more of Mr, G.
H. M., the gentleman who insulted us, the Matrons of England, by
saying that we did not know how to give dinners properly, and by
offering us all sorts of advice which was not required, and if it was,
was not going to be taken from such as him. But it seems that he
cannot keep his disgusting greedy pen quiet, and that not beine abje
to find anything good enough to eat in England, he must go to Russia
for a dinner, and he had better stop there. I am not going to demean
myself by going through his letter of two columns long, all about his
dinner, like a Pig, and indeed I scarcely read a quarter of the rubbish;
but I shall only say that the creatures he speaks of who want a flogging
before dinner to give them an appetite, should have a precious good
one, if I had the making the laws and the choosing the beadles. Lau-
restinas, indeed! Cat o' nine tails would be the properer thing. And
Bohemian Girls to sing to him after dinner. Very pretty, upon my
word. An English gentleman ought to be content to come up to the
drawing-room, and hear an English girl sing " / dreamt that I dwelt in
marble halls." That ought to be enough of Bohemian Girl for him. I
despise G. H. M., Mr. Punch, and that's the long and the short of
it, and it's no use saying it isn't, because it is.
"But what 1 meant to say to you was, that I do hope you will set
yourself against the fashion of these Russian dinners, dinners a la
Russe. If there is one thing in the world I like, it is to be able to say
to people, 'You see your dinner.' I am old-fashioned, I dare say, but
that I can't help, and what's more don't mean to. 1 don't choose to
set fruit, and cut glass, and flowers, and French-moss before my friends,
instead of dishes of food. A dinner-table was intended to be a dinner-
table, and not a Bond Street shop-window. I wonder what Mr. G. H.
M. will stick on the table next instead of wholesome things to eat.
Fountains, perhaps, and bird-cages, and Belfplaying accordions, and
Punch and Judy. He is like a great schoolboy, only if one of my boys
were to put his toys on the table to amuse himself while at his meals,
he'd precious soon have an introduction to Lady Gay Spanker, I can
tell him. I have no patience with such folly.
'Then as to politeness. We used to be told that this was learned
at the dinner-table better than anywhere else. You were instructed to
attend to your neighbours, particularly ladies, and if you sat near the
lady of the bouse you were to insist on carving for her. Where are
the young men of the piesent day to learn manners, I should like to
know F The table covered with flowers and figmareesses, a paper with
a list of the dishes by every guest, and all the dishes handed round one
by one. Why, Mr. Punch, nobody need speak to anybody else at. all,
and I believe that's what G. H. M. would like to come to. All sitting
like people in an omnibus, eat and drink, and go away. And this you
call having a dinner! I don't, if you do. I choose to talk about, my
dishes to my guests, not for them to look at a paper and mumble to
'my servants. What credit does the mistress of the house get for
things smuggled about like this f After all her trouble in getting up
the dinner, the people don't suppose that she knows a bit about it more
than they do. and fancy it all comes in from the pastrycook's round the
corner, which nothing ever did in my house, and never shall so long as
I am the chief of the family, and I should like to hear my husband
propose such a thing, only he knows better than to insult his wife.
The newspapers ought to be ashamed to publish such letters as
Mr. G. H. M.'s, and men ought to be ashamed to read them, which is
more. You ought to have other things to attend to, and the dinners
ought to be left to us to manage, as they used to be in the good old
times, when men were men, and did great thiogs, and did not want to
he flogged for an appetite, and mew about French-moss and flowers on
the table. Dinner is a Lady's business; and one of my boys tells me
that the word Lady is Saxon, and means the Divider of Bread, which
he says is a—something—I forget the word—elephant—equivocate—
equivalent—is that itP—equal to saying she manages the food of the
house. To be sure, old words have lost their meaning, and Spinster
does not now mean a good industrious girl that spins her wedding-
clothes, but only a goose that wants to be married, and meantime sews
eleven millions of eyelet-holes into useless scraps of calico. But
while I am a Lady I will be the Head of the Table, and Mr. G. H. M.
and everybody that is like him, if there are any, and I hope there are
not many, may go on scribbling and being flogged until they are tired.
No Russian dinners, Mr. Punch, for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PRINCE PROCEEDING TO AMERICA.
0 Brother Prince,
of the Agapemone, is
reported to have been
favoured with a reve-
lation intimating to
him the propriety of
going to America.
Some British colony
would seem a more
fitting destination for
him than the United
States, and his coun-
try ought to grant him
a free passage to his
transmarine abode.
Unfortunately, how-
ever, our colonists
very strongly object
to affording an asylum
to such gentlemen as
Mr. Prince, a gen-
tleman who has had
to refund some £7000,
and other sums which
he had obtained
chiefly from confiding
females, by preten-
sions of a superna-
tural character. He
lias been forced to
transfer certain stock
acquired in this way;
and there appears to
be good ground for
questioning whether
a more personal kind
of investment in the
stocks might, or not,
be the legal consequence of some of his pecuniary transactions. It has been suggested that
Brother Prince, when he goes to America, will fraternise with Hkioiiam Young; but the
proverbial indisposition to concord of two of a trade renders that suggestion unlikely. The
two prophets might enter .into partnership, if such an arrangement were likely to suit both

parties; but, unless Prince takes many rich
followers out with him, it may be conjectured
that he and Young will not agree to put their
asses together.
The exoteric doctrines of the Mormon Chief
and those of the Prince of the Agapemone
perhaps differ, but there is every reason for
supposing that their esoteric views are identical.
They have both of them, no doubt, genuine in-
ternal convictions, though neither of them has
yet been convicted of swindling; Brother
Prince having been compelled to make resti-
tution by a legal tribunal, which had not the
power to allot him likewise a term ot laborious
grinding at the crank. They both evidently
coincide in a belief in the main chance, as con-
tradistinguished from predestination and every-
thing else, except, perhaps, polygamy.
If there is balm in Gilead, there is tar in
America. There are also feathers. These con-
siderations may, if they fail to render Brother
Prince disobedient to the revelation which
orders him to the United States, at least induce
him to take good care in what portion of the
American territory he pitches his tabernacle,
and to make sure that it is one inhabited by the
greatest fools, and exempt from the jurisdiction
of Judge Ltnch.
Extremely Shell-fish.
We beg to present the reader with the two
following latest novelties in the way of autumnal
conundrums:—
1st. Why have lobsters no feeders P Because
they have antenna (haven't any).
2nd. Why is a supplementary plate of crabs
like the Alien Actf Because it contains an
extradition clause (an extra dith and claws).
If the too indulgent reader were to try for
a thousand years, he would never be able to
beat the above in badness.
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
"Mi dear Punch,
"It may seem anomalous that your Roving; Correspondent
should, at this season of all others in the year, be still in Town. Such,
however, is the fact. While others were looking after their passports,
getting them vised and inserted in charming little morocco cases, with
their names neatly printed in gold outside, or arming themselves with
those wonderful circular notes (which by the way are really rectangular
but still extremely useful), or investing in miraculous knapsacks,
which hold everything you don't want, from a portable shower-bath to
a patent shaving-brush: while, I say, tourists have been consulting,
JJradsiaw, haunting Railway Offices, and flurrying themselves generally,
your humble servant has been quietly occupied in his studio over his
canvas and cutty-pipe.
"Perhaps a continental tour has lost its charms for me. Perhaps I
am somewhat weary of trips down the Rhine, fortnights in Paris,
excursions to Switzerland, pic-nics in the Pyrenees (where |will our
indefatigable tourists next spend their autumn?) Perhaps out of
perversity I am determined not to do what every one is doing. Perhaps
the balance at my banker is not of sufficient preponderance to justify,
&c. &c.—what matters P Here I am on my native soil; neither
watching the sun rise upon the rosy Jungfrau, nor sink behind the
great dome of Buonarotti; but looking at the rain, drizzling, pattering,
pelting down on London pavement.
"Slow this sounds I admit; but in pleasant company whatfsituation
is not tolerable P I would not give a fig for the finest scenery in the
world if 1 should be condemned to wander through it alone. 1 think
I am a gregarious animal, and can't enjoy life without a companion.
Some of my friends who are of an equally sociable turn, are good
enough to drop in upon me occasionally to snare my cognac, or join me
in a pipe, and so we manage to get through an evening very pleasantly.
Sometimes Stippler holds forth on the divine art, and grows warm in
defence of Pre-Raphaelil.es, or old Massicot, sitting down at my
battered piano, trolls out a jolly ditty. And in truth I would rather
listen to him than to the strains of Miss Gushington, who warbles at
Lady Prism's soirees, for all her fine contralto voice. I fear there must
be some truth in the theory once prevalent in fashionable circles, that
we painters have low tastes, and instinctively incline to humble sources
of pleasure. For my own part I admit that there are occasions when
a churchwarden pipe and a wainscotted tap-room possess irresistible
attractions for me. Why should I be ashamed to own it P Has not
the greatest poet of modern times written an Ode to The Cock, that
famous chanticleer, under the Bbadow of whose wing how many wits,
authors, artists, have joked and eaten! Nay, had not the great Lexi-
cographer himself a weakness for tavern dinners P I have seen the
corner pointed out in which the author of Ratselas used to sit,
(Grablet the stockbroker takes his chop there daily), and I like to
imagine the old philosopher puffing and grunting over his humble fare.
There must be some charm about a neatly sanded floor, which we miss
in the produce of Kidderminster. I have been assured by a score of
exceedingly respectable persons that they prefer a pipe in an old
fashioned chimney-corner to sipping souchong in the genteelest boudoir
in Christendom. What do I but follow in the wake of my more dis-
tinguished brethren? A great modern author has said, that a painter
should be fit for the best society; and keep out of it. There are a few
of us who dance attendance on fat dowagers, and haunt the houses of
the great, but ninety-nine out of a hundred prefer ease and good
fellowship at home. Thank heaven, the flunkeydom of Art is past,
and if our pictures are engraved; there is no need to dedicate the proof
to my Lord Mecjsnas for the sake of his gracious patronage or
precious guineas.
"So my friends take kindly to my easy chair, and in a cloud of
fragrant Latakia forget to sneer at my humble Penates. Last week I
met an old German chum, Herr Von Stunningbr, who used to
study in the Munich Academy, until the death of his uncle, and his
consequent accession to the family thalers induced him to relinquish
the limner's art as a profession. I had asked him to drop in the other
evening, and after waiting some time had given him up, when a deci-
dedly dissyllabic knock, which was much too deliberately given for the
post, and with not sufficient slang about it for the beer, announced his
arrival at the door of my chambers. Signalling Mrs. Kinahan to
bring up the battered old would-be-plated-but-unquestionably-Britannia-
metal teapot in which she serves my Pekoe. I nulied to meet him; but
imagine, Sir, my feelings when I tell you that I found him putting on
pumps in the passage, and attired in a complete ball costume with a
gibus' under his arm. There is a rather coarse but familiar metaphor
by which a man under risible influenoe is represented as 'ready to

split,' bat the fact is, that Sttpfleb, -who had on my shooting jacket,
which is much too small for him, actually did lose several buttons in a
fit of laughter behind the Times, when he saw my foreign friend thus
gorgeously attired enter the apartment. For my part I felt sorry
for the Herr, who, to do him justice, is as good a fellow as ever swal-
lowed sauerkraut. He was evidently under an impression that he was
coming to a grand entertainment, and here were we smoking short
clays and imbibing beer like amateur coalheavers. What do I say P
smoking? beer-drinking? If the Stunninger had been of any other
nation than his own, I might have felt embarrassed. Bat when did a
Vaterlander ever refuse a weed and a glass of ale? Imploring him to
be seated (for the honest fellow was standing in the first position, and
bowing away to everyone, including Mrs. K., at the rate of ten miles
an hoar), I presently divested him of his dress-coat, and lent him a
dressing-gown, enveloped in which easy garment, and pulling away at
my best Meerschaum, he soon made himself at home, and recounted
his late adventures. He had been in Town but five days, and in that
short space of time had managed to visit more lions than I ever expect
to see during the term of my natural life.
"Of course he had been over the Tower—of which I have only once
caught a glimpse from a penny steamboat. He bad penetrated into
t he humid regions of the Thames Tunnel, and scaled the heights of the
Civic Monument. He had been introduced to Madame Tussatjd's
ceroplastic celebrities, and had watched with delight the gambols of
the hippopotamus in the Regent's Park. He had been wound up in the
ascending-room of the Coliseum, and lowered in the diving-bell at the
Polytechnic; visited the Law Courts, *vare I underwent,' said the
poor fellow, 'a brofuse transpiration,' the Metropolitan Prisons, the
Houses of Parliament, Guildhall—what not. He was good enough to
speak of all in terms of glowing admiration. One was 'sehr hiibsch,'
another 'wunderschon.' His only regret was, that he had had no
opportunity of seeing Shakspeare on the British stage. 'My frient,'
said he, 11 would have liked to see Hamled by Velps or Kran in
Bote you Please It.' He went to the Olympic, and came away shocked
at Mb. Robson's admirable impersonation of the Venetian Jew. He
looks upon burlesque as a sign of the decadence of the English Drama,
and censures the immortal Bard himself for his disregard of the
'unities.'
"As the evening wore away, I think it was Stipplek who proposed
that we should adjourn to Paddt Green's, and afford the Stonninger
an opportunity of seeing that famous Music Hall. We summoned a
eab, and it would have done your heart good to see the Herr taking off
his hat to the Peeler who shut the door for us. 'How amiable are
your constables!' he exclaimed, as we drove away, and I believe he
tipped X 4002 a shilling for his pains. At Greek s the Stunninger
made himself thoroughly at home, listening to 'The Tardy Horsman,'
'The Chaffing Crow,' 'Band the Life-moat', and other popular melodies
with the greatest enthusiasm and delight, and breaking a tumbler or
so at every round of applause. Mr. Green the well-known proprietor
tendered his snuff-box with his usual affability, and Herb Joel, at the
particular desire of a few kind friends (who have made the same
request of him any night these twenty years) favoured us with his
celebrated imitation of a male and female kingfisher, a trombone, a
hayrick, and other types of lower creation.
'As for refreshment, there were certainly four of us but as I
remember paying for five kidneys, three Welsh rarebits, and a chop, to
say nothing of bitter ale and gin sling, I suppose some of us must have
made a good supper.
"I saw the Herr home to his hotel: he grasped my hand as he
wished me good night, and entered upon a long and seriously involved
sentence, in which I could just distinguish the words 'Oastfreiheit;
• Effanses,' 'Deutschland,' 'bier-drinken,' 'Schiller' 'Velch-rarebid;
'Gesellschaft' 'prosit Gross Brittania,' and 'auf Wiedersehn.' Then
taking a candle from the night-porter, and collecting all his energies
into one profound bow, he went slowly up to bed.
"Faithfully yours,

THE CRYSTAL PALACE BABY COURT.
We hear it is the intention of the Crystal Palace Company, who are
always active in administering to the wants of the pleasure-seeking
public, to open a small Court for the reception of the Babies who in
such numbers daily honour the Palace with their presence. To ease
the minds of such Mammas as bring their Babies without nursemaids,
the Court will be supplied with suitable attendants; and every care
will be taken in the absence of their parents to provide the infant
occupants with recreation and refreshment. A quantity of pap will be
continually on sale, and Babies who—despite of stern George Gkdik-
shank.—are addicted to the Bottle, will be furnished with the means
to allay their inward cravings.
Corals will be kept for all the tiny teeth in need of them, and rattles
of the newest and the noisiest description will be constantly in readi-
ness for all the little hands which may be stretched and clapped in
eagerness to seize them. A lot of baby-jumperg will also be suspended
for infants who are fond of active sedentary exercise; while for Babies
of more dormant and retiring dispositions cradles, rocked by steam,
will be let out by the hour, each one warranted to send its inmate off'
to "bye-bye" within the limit of a brace of shakes, after tucking up
in it. In short, no pains will be spared to make the Court a pleasant
lounge and agreeable midday resting-place for all the "tiddy ittle
sings" whom their Mammas may wish to leave there, like parcels,
until called for.
The chief object of the Court is, however, not so much to please the
Babies as the public, who are now continually annoyed by squeals and
squallings, at times when such disturbance is most trying to the
nerves. It is an aggravating thing for a connoisseur of music to find
a pack of Babies in full cry in the concert room, when ho goes there to
enjoy a symphony of Beethoven or a melody of Mozart. The power
of disturbance by a Baby with good lungs is considerably greater than
the ignorant may think. Indeed an infant's throat, if its possessor be
in health, is one of the most powerful wind instruments we know.
A solo on the squall is quite enough to drown a solo on the flute; in
fact, the other day as we sat hearing the Creation, the grand crash of a
chorus was completely overwhelmed by the squeals of Mrs. Bibs's
baby just behind us.
By the opening of the Baby Court these interruptions will be stopped,
and the Crystal Palace Concerts may be heard without annoyance.
This consummation is the more devoutly to be wished, as the music
which is given there really is worth hearing, and it tries one's temper
sadly to listen without hearing it. By the arrangement now in prospect
this aural disappointment will in future be avoided; and in common
with all lovers of the Crystal Palace Concerts we shall most heartily
rejoice when we are able to announce that the project we have men-
tioned has been put in actual practice, and that daily during concert-
time every Baby in the building has to undergo the ceremony of
presentation at the Baby Court.

ROME ON THE SEINE.*
Th"B following article, which explains, on behalf of the French
Imperial Government, the relation of the Tuileries to the Vatican, may
be regarded as semi-officious:—
The Goyernment of the Emperor, ever having at heart the interests
of France and the Catholic world, which are inseparable, has known
how to conduct itself under existing complications.
When France kneels, Europe falls prostrate. When] France crosses
herself, Europe beats her breast.
Will the Sovereign Pontiff quit Rome? Will the Holy Father stay
where he is? Behold the two questions of which France is going to
propose a solution.
It is incontestable that Rome is the patrimony of St. Peter. But the
Pope is the father of 200,000,000 Catholics. Therefore, wherever the
Pope may be, he can bless the whole world from the roof of the nearest
house. It follows that the Pope is unable to quit the metropolis of
Catholicism; because Rome, so to speak, accompanies him wherever
he goes.
Nevertheless, unbounded freedom of action is necessary to the
polit ical independence of the Head of the Church.
It, is in this regard that France has resolved to astonish the world by
a self-devotion which will exemplify the inexorable logic of faith.
By this time the Catholic populations will have comprehended the
necessity of inviting the Holy Father to take up his residence at
Paris. Faris, equally with Rome, is the Eternal City. Consequently,
in going to Paris the Pope does not quit Rome; it is simply a change
of air; a transition to a mild atmosphere from one of which the tempe-
rature was excessive.
The treasures of Christian and Classical art which have been accu-
mulated by so many Pontiffs can accompany his Holiness.
France is profoundly Catholic. What is Government? It is, for
France, Catholicism applied in politics. What! is there one morality
for individuals and another for nations? Certainly not. The Imperial
Government will therefore constitute itself towards France, and thus
towards Europe, the Executive of the Catholic theocracy.
Nevertheless the Government of the Emperor will reserve to itself
the filial privilege of advising the Father of the Faithful, and tendering
to the Sovereign Pontiff those necessary counsels, which, when adopted,
must be universally accepted as the dictates of infallible wisdom, In
this manner France will reconcile a devout fidelity with the gravity of
the present situation, and will consult European objects which are also
those of the Church.
A TORTURER'S PLEA.
Oms Hoplet, a ruffian, usurping the sacred name of Teacher,
recently flogged a child to death, and is undergoing a righteous
sentence for his crime. For some reason, he is permitted to make a
plea in print against his punishment. His plea is as loathsome as his
crime. He has the effrontery to urge, that in beating Reginald
Cancellor to death, he, Hoplet, the Brute, was but following out a
System which has been strenuously maintained by religionists. And
he cites cases in which the most cruel chastisements have been per-
severed in by Christian parents, until exhausted and tortured children
have been compelled to beg mercy. His argument is that we, the
Wiser and Stronger, are entitled to use our strength against others
until they admit our wisdom.
We are content to accept the man's propositions, and we call for
the adoption of his system. Outraged English society says, in its
wisdom," It is wicked to torture children." Hoplet refuses to admit
this. Well, outraged English Society happens to be stronger than
Hoplet. Let his system be enforced. Is there a Cat and Nine Tails
in the gaol in which he is doing penance?
A Foot Look Out.
It would be rather awkward, when that new Zealander comes to
Waterloo Bridge to take his celebrated sketch, if he hasn't a half-
penny with him to pay the toll; for how, pray, is he to take his stand
on one of the middle arches, if the toll-keeper will not allow him to
pass? We leave the question to be decided by any one of the five
liundred authors of the existence of the New Zealander, whose
future prospects have been so frequently and so eloauently commented
upon.

A REAL WORKING MEN'S RIFLE CORPS.
Pekhaps they won't per-
so were!" was the reflection
of the footman when he
heard his bell rune vigo-
rously a second and third
time; and did not think it
worth his while to trouble
himself to answer it.
"Perhaps they won't per-
sewere!" may have like-
wise been the thought of
certain friends across the
Channel, when they heard
how energetically our Rifle
Movement was first started,
and what vigorous vitality
was evinced in its quick
progress. If this were so,
however, we apprehend that
our good friends have been
sadly disappointed. The
ardour of our Riflemen has
not been " too hot to hold,"
as the common saying goes;
and the wet which they
have marched through has
entirely failed to damp it.
Ardent spirits as they are,
the members of our Rifle
Corps will bear a lot of
water before they are much
weakened by it. Their
Eatriotic fire is not easy to
e quenched, and we may
now regard them as com-
pletely above proof, with
so many watery trials has
their strength been weekly
tested.
If patience is a virtue, so is perseverance; and of both of these good qualities
our Volunteers have clearly shown themselves possessed. Some Corps have
perhaps displayed them more than others: and a laudable example of what may
r =-Uties is afforded
be achieved in the pursuit of Rifle practice under no slight <

to posterity by the members of the Deptford Company,
of whose good work their captain,—Monigomerie by
name, has let us know this much:—
"Having roceived from ft friendly neighbour ground for bail practice,
end spoilt bricks enough for a wall, they set to work to erect their
own butt; and in seven evenings, working with a will, and every
member of every rank, the chaplain not excepted, taking his turn
at digging and wheeling, they erected a wall sixty-four feet long, ten
feet high, and six feet thick at the base, with an embankmont
behind It."
This Deptford Corps, we learn, was set on foot for
"working men." Assuredly its members, in erecting their
own butts, have not belied their name, and they have
thereby made it one which they may well feel proud of.
We think if other corps were to follow in their footsteps,
there would be small harm, and probably great benefit.
There is nothing infra dig. in handling a spade, and in
erecting their own butts there is nothing to cause Riflemen
to make butts of themselves for outsiders to laugh at.
However high may be their standing in society, they need
not fear that doing useful handiwork will lower it; and as
for any jokes that may be cracked at their expense, the
cracking of their rifles will be quite enough to drown I linn.
Indeed, seeing what expense their butt-making has saved
them, they can well afford to run the risk of being laughed at.
But there is little chance of ridicule for such good pluck
and perseverance as that by which the Deptford corps have
won our thanks and kudo*. We say our "thanks," for
every one who lends his aid to strengthen our national
defences, deserves the thanks of every one who wants to
be defended by them. As the father of a family, in their
name we therefore thank the Deptford Volunteers for the
practice ground which they so pluckily have made; and
we hope next year at Wimbledon they will show us that
their practice has made them pretty perfect.
The Head of his Race.
At the boat-races at Ottawa, before the Pbince of
Wales, the great race was won by an Indian, who shot
far a-head of all his competitors. This gives a flat con-
tradiction to the assertion, that the Indians as a race are
fast going out. However, in the present instance, it was no
great wonder that the Indian proved the winner, for as his
was made of birch, it was pretty sure to flog all others.
CRINOLINE AND CIVILISATION.
"Oh, Mr. Punch! I am to enchanted! What do you think that
darling Prince of Wales has discovered? At least it wasn't he
exactly, but the Times Correspondent; only of course you know if the
Prince hadn't gone there, the Correspondent would not either, and so
the discovery might never have been made, or at any rate not so toon,
and, if it had, perhaps the Times might not have had its Correspondent
there, and then of course the public would have heard nothing about
it. But I'm keeping you, poor man! from the account of the discovery.
Here it is then, word for word as it was printed in the paper, I got my
little sister Julia to copy it, for Miss Smith (she's our governess)
was gone to see her Aunt, at least the says it's her Aunt, but / say it's
her Cousin, because I know that he's at home now, and he's got Oh!
such nice hair, and such a lovely large moustache, at least so Miss
Smith tells me, and so you see I had to hear the children say their
lessons; and Julia, Oh! she was such a naughty child, she would insist
on saying 'cat' spelt'dog,' and in declaring that twice twelve was
a hundred Mid twenty-four! and in protesting that New York was a
lake in Mesopotamia! And so for punishment I made her copy out
this extract, and you needn't be afraid to print it from her writing,
because I read it over afterwards and made the spelling right, and put
the proper stops. You know the Correspondent is describing the
Royal tour through Upper Canada, and between two villages called
Almonte and Arapain—they have the queerest names for places in
America!—he says:—
"The track was partly through the forest, over what Is called a corduroy road a
Colonial synonyme for no road at all, a kind ol track where the natural inequalities
of the ground are developed to their utmost by a profuse intermixture of pine logs.
The route at this part lay through a perfectly wild country. Only a log cabin broke
the monotony of the forest here and there, with a group of raggod brown girls and
boys clustered on pine logs to cheer the Prince. The despotism of fashion, howc*«r,
has penetrated into the remotest recesses of those backwoods, for howover ragged
may be the female members of a Settler's family, I never saw any who did not wear
the moat monstrous wooden hoops under their petticoats."
"There, Mr. Punch\ Now. what do you say to that, Sir? Wide
petticoats are worn in the backtooodt of America! Isn't that an inte-
resting discovery to make! And how glad I am to think the Prince-
dear darling fellow, how I should like to waltz with him—should be
the man to make it! One feels really almost reconciled to losing him so
long, when one hears of what intelligence his absence is productive.
How charming it is to think that wherever women go, Crinoline goes
with them; and that no matter what a nuisance and a trouble it must
be to them, they will persist in wearing it despite of every obstacle.
Of course it must be a great bother to walk in a wide petticoat in
places like the backwoods, at least if they 're at all like what my fancy
paints them. Why, even in Kew Gardens there are walks which are
so narrow one can scarcely squeeze one's hoops through them, and I'm
sure in Richmond Park there are heaps and heaps of places where one
finds one's Crinoline immentely inconvenient. As for Burnham Beeches,
really there are walks there which are quite impassable if one goes in a
wide dress. The last picnic that I went to, I got so entangled, I do
believe indeed that I should never have got out if Cousin Charley, who
was with me, hadn't had a penknife, and so by main force extricated me.
He said I was as difficult to clear as the Great Eastern, and I'm sure
it took him such a time to cut me out, that Mamma grew really anxious
and would insist on sending off that horrid Ma. Quizzington to see
what had become of me!
"Well, if Crinoline is so inconvenient in England, what mutt it be
in places like the forests of America! and how brave it is in girls to
go through the bore of wearing it! Much as you hate Crinoline I'm
sure you must admire the heroism—or should 1 call it theroitm ?—of
those who make such martyrs of themselves by using it. And surely
you will cease, Sir, from your horrible attacks on it, now you are con-
vinced, as 1 'm sure you ought to be, that tbey are futile to arrest its
world-pervading course, and that wherever we may trace the advance
of civilisation, there will the march of Crinoline infallibly be manifest,
"I remain, Sir, in the fashion,
"Yours defiantly as ever,
"Amelia Angelica Angelina Agnes Anne."
"P.S. Does Judy wear Crinolinef I'll bet a pair of gloves she
doet!
"P.S. My size is six-and-a-quarter. Please leave them under cover,
at your office, and I'll call for them."

CHAPTER XXXI.—THE LADIES, BLESS THEM! AND THE
REIGNS OF HENRY THE FOURTH AND HENRY THE FIFTH.
ifore we leave the
Ladies of the four-
teenth century, of whom
in our last Chapter we
gave a full-length pic-
ture, we may just re-
mind the reader that in
the twenty-second year
of the reign of Edward
theThird was founded
the most noble Order of
the Garter. How the
order is by some people
supposed to have had
origin in the drop-
ping of a garter by a
Countess op Salis-
bury, and the handing
of it hack to her by the
King who picked it up,
with the memorable
saying, "Honi soit qui
mal y peine!" we
scarcely should have
taken the labour to re-
peat, were it not to
add, that the story is
one of those which are
raon a drawing in the ihnch collection. ^00. Sood to be true,
(rAc-euuLA.) and we must therefore
warn our readers not
to put their faith in it. Seeing that we have always believed the tale
ourselves (as we have the story about Romulus and Remus being
suckled by a wolf, and a hundred other anecdotes that history has
handed to us) it causes us a cruel pang to have to say there is no
truth in it; but as a living author tells us that "all writers of any
credit combine to reject the popu-
we cannot for our

L's sake do otherwise than
join them.
We noticed that wide hats were
worn about this period, and that
Chaucee's Wife of Bath, whose
hat was "as broad as a targe," in
this respect bore likeness to Miss
Jemima Jones, whom we saw two
seasons since (before the Spanish
hat came into vogue) ambling on
her donkey along the sands at
Broadstairs. To this we ought to
add that also showing a resem-
blance to certain recent fashions is
the description Chaucer gives us
of the Carpenter his Wife: who
among her other finery was adorned
with a broad silken fillet round her
head, and to fasten her low collar
wore a brooch which was as big as
the boss of a buckler (!) We learn
too that her shoes were laced high
up on her legs, a description that
just tallies with the modern "high-
lows," which now that they are
called by a less vulgar appellation,
may be daily seen on hundreds of
fashionable feet.
Gloves are shown in many of the
drawings of this period, but whether they were worn more upon
the hands than in them is a question which we leave to those who
like to guess at. In the old illuminations we see them just as fre-
quently in one way as the other, and so we may presume that ladies
who were too lazy (dare we say P) to put their glove3 on, liked to
show that they possessed them by carrying them in their hand.
Whether girls were wont then to bet gloves at the tournaments, which
they usually attended in gorgeous array,* is another of the problems
* In the reign of Richard the Second, Caxton speaks of twenty-four (Ffoissart
Says sixty) ladies riding from the Tower to the jousts in Smithneld, leading four
and tweuty knights in chaius of gold and silver; the knights, ladies and all other
attendants at the tournaments having their dresses, shields, and trappings decorated

second.
we must leave to be decided by those who have more time and inclina-
tion for the task. But if they did, we rather question if the fair sex
were more fair in this respect than they are now, and we have lately
learnt that gentlemen have even been discovered so far North as
Doncaster, who have failed in their attempts to make young ladies pay
their bets.
We come now to the threshold of the fifteenth century, and the
costume of the reign of Kino Henry the Fourth and that, of his sad
scapegrace son, the friend of old Jack FaUtqff, Kino Henry the
Fifth. We have not seen it ourselves; but from all that we read of
it, we think the effigy of Henry pere is one of the most splendid in
all our regal series; and we strongly advise readers who have nothing
else to do, and cannot enjoy a holiday unless they have some excuse for
it, to ascertain in what cathedral the tomb is to be seen, and to spend
a pleasant day or two in going to inspect it. In doing so we may
advise them to pay the most particular attention to the crown, which
is probably an imitation of the famous "Harry crown" that was
broken into pieces by King Henry the Fifth, and pawned in 1415
for wages to the Knights who served in the expedition against France.*
We cannot say for certainty if this were the same crown of which the
poet Shakspeare makes King Henry say:—
'* Heaven knows by what byepaths and crooked ways
I met this crown; and I myself know well
How troublesome it sat upon my head."
But judging from the look of it, we must say we incline to fancy that
it was. We know that for ourselves we should feel disposed to think
it something worse than "troublesome" to have to carry on our 1
such a structure as this
crown; and torture as we
think it to wear a modern
"chimney - pot," we can
hardly bear to think of
the excruciating headaches
which such a crown as this
would infallibly inflict on
us. No one but a lunatic
would ever dream of wear-
ing such a heavy head-cover;
and the " madcap" Prince
of Wales must indeed have
earned that epithet when he
put his father's crown on
just to see if he looked well
in it.
But little change occurred
in civil Costumes at this
period, nor were there many
military novelties to speak
of. Gowns both long and
short were worn as upper
garments both by high and
low; and were made with
sweeping sleeves, indented
at the edges in the form of
leaves, or else with sleeves
called pokys, which as we
have shown depended from
the wrist, not unlike the
bags of bagpipes, and which doubtless were found useful by police-
men of the period to conceal the legs of mutton which they
pouched upon their beats. Long tunics were likewise very gene-
rally worn, and the one seen on the effigy of King Henry the
Fourth has two pockets in the front, placed somewhat near the
sides, the slits whereof are perpendicular like those in modem
"pegtops." This long tunic we learn was known by a long name,
being called a houppelande; and as the word is derived from the
Spanish, it does not seem unlikely that the garment came from Spain.
We are told that at the Coronation of King Henry the Fourth the
lords wore scarlet houppelandes, covered with long mantles; while the
Knights and their Esquires were allowed to wear the houppelande, but
without the mantle. We likewise are informed that the day before the
ceremony, the King performed the feat of making six-and-thirty
knights; which we fancy must have been a rather expensive morning's
work, seeing that to each of them he gave a long green coat, with
straight sleeves furred with miniver, and having a large hood lined with
the same fur and fashioned like the hoods which were then worn by
the prelates. On the day when we are knighted (which we fully
with Richard's livery of the White Hart, with a crown of gold round its neck, and
a chain hanging thereto.
* According to Goldsmith, the crown was pawned to Cardinal Beaufort, the
uncle of the King; but from other good authorities we learn that fragments were
deposited with other so-called "uncles" of the reigning sovereign. A great flour
de l>s garnished with one great balys, oue ruby, three great sapphires, and ten
pearls was plcdged,as weare told, "unto Sir John Colvtl; and to John Pudbey, Esq.,
to Maurice Brunne, and to John Saundish, each, a pinnacle of the aforesaid
crown, furnished with two sapphires, one squaro balys, and six pearls."

expect will happen as soon as we have finished the Great Work we are
engaged upon), we trust this good old custom will be duly borne in
mind, and that a suit of the most fashionable clothing will be added to
the title with which we are rewarded, and by which a grateful nation
will indicate its thanks.
OMNIBUS REFORM.
Although for the present ousted from our Parliament, Reform is
very clearly the order of the day. Everyone seems bent upon reform-
ing everybody, and from tailors bills to juvenile delinquents there is
nooody and nothing that escapes without attack. The very oldest
nuisances are daringly assailed, nor is a little finger lifted by the public
to protect them. Smithfield has been swept out, and so has the
Palace Court, and there are men who hope to live to see the Income-
Tax reformed, and an end of Temple Bar, the toll-gates and the tax-
gatherers. Where the mania will end it is impossible to say, but 'bus-
cads have been threatened and cabmen may come next, and when these
are both reformed what new wonders may be looked for?
To show we are not wrong in our announcement of this threat, and
to apprise the British Public that the Wild Busmen of London are not
far oft extinction, we beg to call attention to a stringent code of rules
which the General Omnibus Company have recently been issuing, and
which if generally obeyed, will quite exterminate the savages who have
far too long been suffered to infest the public streets. These new
rules are intended for a new set of conductors whom the Company have
started on their Bank-to-Clapton route, where in future, we are told,
"intelligent lads of sixteen or eighteen, having a good character, ana
dressed in a neat uniform," will officiate in place of those beery shoot-
ing-coated and slouch-hatted individuals by whom the rider in an
omnibus has usually been served. The plan, it seems, is copied from
that which is adopted by the Telegraphic Companies; from whose
ranks of nimble Mercuries, as from time to time they grow too old for
that service, the footboards of the Omnibuses will in part be filled.
This we cannot but regard as a promising arrangement; for a lad who
has been trained to run about with telegrams will not be likely to like
crawling along at a snail's pace as 'bus-cads are in general prone to let
their drivers do.
Something more, however, than mere bodily activity is required for
the service. Aspirants must to some extent have cultivated minds,
and to render themselves eligible must have undergone such schooling
as will enable them to "perform any ordinary sums of addition, sub-
traction, and multiplication of money." This, we can't help thinking,
is a highly useful rule: for whenever hitherto we have been cheated in
our change, and have received but fivepence halfpenny as the difference
between the shilling which we tendered and the fare of fourpence
which we had to pay, we have often in our charity attributed the fraud
to an ignorance of mathematics on the part of the conductor, whose
defective education we have inwardly deplored.
Among other rules laid down for his guidance and protection, we
find that—
"A conductor most not enter si public-house during his hours of duty, under
pain of immediate dismissal and forfeiture of any wages that may be due to him."
This, although a highly salutary law, we fancy must admit of some
slight mitigation. Unless conductors are to eat their dinners upon
doorsteps, it is obvious the rule must daily be relaxed. We do not
think it would enhance the beauty of our 'buses to see conductors on
their footboards with a pork pie in their hands, or a hunch of bread
and cheese, or a slice of a polony, and taking surreptitious swigs from
a flat bottle. But as even a conductor to an omnibus must eat, to
some such steps as these will our 'bus-cads be reduced, if entrance to
a public-house for dinner be denied them. If, when serving as most
do at a distance from their homes, they are not to be allowed to enter
a refreshment place, they will have to be continually taking bits and
scraps, and doubtless will be. forced to answer questions with their
mouths full, and perhaps to wet their whistle when they want to
blow it.
But the mandates we have quoted are comparatively mild compared
with others which are issued, and whioh we here subjoin. During
each journey, each conductor is told on pain of death, or at any rate
dismissal, that—
"Ho must direct the driver where to go, and where to stop during the journey.
Ho must see that the omnibus works to its appointed time, and report to the road
Inspector the cause of any irregularity in that respect. While on the journey he
must stand on his footboard, with his back to the omnibus; but in letting passen-
gers In and out, he mustdescend and assist them. Ho must if possiblo set passengers
down at the kerb stone on either side of ttao road desired. If more passengers desire
to ride than he has room for, he who first hails tho omnibus must have the prece-
dence. Before giving tho signal for starting, he must see that passengers are
seated, or that they have firm hold of the upright bar la the interior. Ho must not
slam the door, strike the panel, or kick the footboard, as a signal to tho driver, but
must call or blow a whistle. He must prevent passengers getting in or out, on or
off, the omnibus while in motion. He must bo civil and obliging to passengers in
nil things. He must not leavo the omnibus while on his journey, except to assist a
passenger to or from the pavement. Ho must not ride insiuo the omnibus. He
must not smoko nor stop to drink during the journey. Persons In dirty dress or
otherwise fairly objectionable, or in a state of intoxication, most not be admitted
into tho omnibus. No person must ride on the step of the omnibus. Dogs must
not be admitted into tho omnibus, except small dogs carried in the hand, and thon
only with tho consent of all passengers. Packages of meat, or fish, or bulky or
offensive packages of any kind, must not be allowed inside the omnibus."
If conductors observe duly this their Duty to their Neighbour, we
shall hear no more of stoppages to "wash the osses' mouths out;" of
nervous persons being set down in the middle of the street; or of
unprotected females being carried off to Bayswater upon the plea that
it's within a "heasy walk" of Brixton. The word ^bus-cad will die
out, and the nicer term of 'bus-lad be allowed to take its place. Lads
who know how to conduct themselves, may wondrously reform the
conducting of the omnibuses. There will no more be slams of doors, or
shovelling in of feeble passengers, or starting off so suddenly that they
are thrown in others' laps, or have to lay hold of the nearest noses to
support themselves. Band-boxes and lap-dogs, and other feminine
encumbrances, will no longer be allowed to annoy the public's knees,
and the public's toes and corns will be most carefully respected. We
even live in hopes that the days of the admission of Crinoline are
numbered. So Eutopian, in fact, is the state of things in prospect,
that we thoroughly expect it will be possible ere long to get into an
omnibus without having to run for it, and without finding a baby or a
wet umbrella in it.
JANUAEITJS AND GAVAZZL
To Sib George BownB, M.P.
Mr Dear Bowyer,
Yotj will have seen that Father Gavazzi has been preaching
in the Cathedral at Naples. Fancy that! The sarcrosanct edifice did
not fall down upon him. Would you have thought it? Nay, Gavazzi
prophesied in the pulpit, and, what is more, his prediction was fulfilled.
He said that San Gennaro's blood would liquefy on the appointed day,
notwithstanding the presence of Garibaldi. The blood did liquefy so
punctually as nine o'clock in the morning, like butter on a hot roll at
breakfast, a natural phenomenon which no doubt occurred in many
instances about the same hour with the miracle. It is clear, therefore,
that Gennabo is no more a humbug than Gavazzi. If the former is a
true saint, the latter is also a veritable prophet; but what a testimony
the saint and the prophet combine in bearing to the cause of Garibaldi
and Yictor Emmanuel! How can the King and the Dictator be
supposed to have been excommunicated P _ Of course they have not
been. Infallibility could not err. His Holiness named no names in
the bull consigning to perdition some person or persons unknown,
which he caused to be stuck on the walls. The spiritual pretensions
of the Holy Father are thus triumphantly saved; but don't you think
now that he appears to be placed in a dilemma wherein he had better
draw in his temporal horns F Antonelli may say what he likes; but
you will doubtless agree with your condisciple in apple sauce. *
least of Michaelmas Goose, 1860.
CENTS AND NONSENSE.
The Elections in America are principally carried on by a process
called "stumping." Paid orators scour the country, and address the
multitude, who dearly love a speech, from the stump of a tree. Hence
the term, "stump orator." However, there is also another form of
stumping it. All the officials in the pay of the Government have been
called upon by the Democratic clubs to pay a subscription, the minimum
of which is to be not less than £10, towards the expenses of the election
of their Candidate. As their retention of office depends upon the
return of the Democrat candidate, the subscriptions must be paid, or
else the million and a half of employes (they are either more or else)
must politely walk out to allow another million and a half quietly to
walk in. The application is tantamount to a demand, " Your money
or your seat." This method of coming down with the stumpy is by
no means so popular as the first. Your stump orator attracts men far
and near to listen to him; but your stump tax-gatherer, who calls upon
the poor clerk to stump up, has the peculiar effect of making all those
he addresses himself to run in the opposite direction.
The Cup of Misery.
We read in the Italian correspondence the following distressing fact:—
"Thero has been an insurrection in Todi."
We suppose such an insurrection was stirred up with a spoon? We
should recommend that an Irishman or a Scotchman be sent over to
quell this insurrection, for they're the boys for putting down Todi
(Toddy).'

A DEVILISH BAD PRACTICE.
In mi article upon cotton, and the
need there is of growing it in India
and Australia, as well as in America,
a contemporary fitly calls attention to
the fact that—
"A deputation baa bad to go to America,
to see wbotber a atop cannot be put to the
adulteration of cotton bales, wbich are apt to
constat of sand and rubbiab to the extent of
thirty per cent.; to aay nothing of tbe
hideous fact that lucifer matches are some-
timea placed in the moat dangerous part of
tho bale."
With due respect to our contem-
porary, we really think this latter
fact (supposing that it is a fact) is
not one "to say nothing of." - To
adulterate with rubbish to the extent
of thirty per cent, is evil work enough;
but surely it is work fit only for the
Evil One to place in cotton-bales
combustibles, in parts where hideous
danger is most likely to be caused by
them. How many vessels have
escaped being set on fire, and how
many living men have annually been
threatened with a hideous destruc-
tion, through the handiwork of these
American incendiaries, it is not our
business nor our pleasure to conjec-
ture. But we cannot avoid saying,
that Lucifer matches are well named,
when they are found employed in so
devilish a purpose as that which they
appear in the above instance to
indicate.

A LAMENTATION AND A PROPHECY.
As if the fall of the year needed a climax to its sadness, there came
last week a mournful invitation from the Crystal Palace, to hear the
"Last Farewell" of the clear-toned Clara Novello. Obeying the
behest, Mr. Punch went, and heard, and—for the thousandth time—
was conquered. But so strong was she in voice that Mr. Punch could
not believe that he was hearing the last strains of his favourite swan-
like songstress. Mr. Punch could not help thinking, with doubtless
hundreds of her hearers.—Can she "retire" her notes, as people say in
Lombard Street? Will John Bull so prematurely submit to such a
loss? For even if Mr. Gladstone should next year double the
Income-Tax, the deed will tend but little to console us for our Clara.
How could she so composedly behold that sea of lovely bonnets, if she
had made her mind up never once more to confront them P While her
seraphic tones were floating, like the rustling of angel-wings, round
about her audience, could she bear to let them go home to their
mundane occupations without the hope of hearing such a heavenly
voice on earth again P
No! Forbid it, Benedict! No! Forbid it, Bowlet. Mr. Punch
is (by himself) now fully authorised to state, that Clara has not left
him. How could she exist, with all that gush of song, in the bosom of
retirement P It must well forth somewhere, that is clear as Cheapside
mud; and such a flood of liquid melody as Clara can pour forth
would be completely overwhelming in any private hearing-place.
Therefore, speaking for the greatest happiness of the greatest number,
Mr. Punch delights to state that the flood-gates are not closed yet.
finally and for ever. With his mantle of prophecy consolingly wrapped
round him, Mr. Punch, without much fear, will wager ten to one that
ere the Twentieth of November (who will bet the bet will not be
won on the Nineteenth P) the echoes of a concert-room within cab-range
of Fleet Street will once more be awakened by the clear voice of our
Clara. i
(NEWS FOR ACTORS AND ACTRESSES.
Mr. Punch is delighted to find that such of the Managers of
Country Theatres as protest against being prevented from using the
Works of Dramatic Authors without paying for such use, have come
to the noble determination of carrying out the principle which the
Managers consider involved in the question.
As regards the plays, the Managers say that the Author who pro-
duces his play in London is paid for it by the London Manager, and
therefore ought to have no further remuneration, and his work ought
to be free for the use and advantage of the Country Manager.
The Managers, being convinced of the justice of this view, intend to
apply it to the case of Actors and Actresses who have appeared in
London. Having been paid by the London theatre for their trouble in
acquiring their art, these performers ought to make no claim upon the
provincial Manager, but ought to be glad that "a mere intellectual
effort which has been adequately rewarded," should contribute to the
support of so noble an institution as the British Drama.
In future, therefore, Ladies and Gentlemen engaged by the Managers
alluded to will understand that they will be placed on the footing of
the Author, and will be paid only for "intellectual efforts" originally
designed for the theatres in question. Travelling expenses will,
however, be allowed. A List of these Managers may be had from the
Dramatic Authors' Society, or from their Solicitor.

revolting."

COALS OF FIRE.
Oub friend, the Weekly Dispatch,
is sow a highly respectable paper,
and recognises decency and Deity in
a way that would make its original
promoters (if still extant) stare
and swear. Mr. Punch has much
pleasure in habitually reading the
Dispatch. But there is such a thing
as being in too great a hurry to
forget one's antecedents. Last
week the journal in question found
fault with Mr. Punch (who is never
wrong upon any topic in or out of
the world) for a joke which repre-
sented a Barrister as having taken
a certain position in order to ad-
dress a jury. The Dispatch inti-
mated that the jury was not in the
place where the advocate was.
Come, come, this is a little too
good in a paper whose success was
made by an Old Bailey Lawyer.
To pretend not to know that a
Barrister does not stand in the
jury-box, but at a considerable
distance therefrom! Jerusalem!
Snakes! However, the Dispatch
is forgiven—the cavil was only
introduced as a puff for certain
maps, which are quite good enough
to need no putfs grounded on
affectation of ignorance, and to
which Mr. Punch, himself an Atlas

to lend his good word.

SPIRITUAL HAT-MOVING.
There are no good lies in the Spiritual Magazine of this month; for
the stories about the " Daveuport Boys" copied from a Yankee organ
of Spiritualism, called the Herald of Progress, are as silly as they are
false, and evince merely a stupid effrontery and an idiotic indifference
to truth. From the notices To Readers and Correspondents" the
subjoined extract shall enjoy all the advantage it can derive from quo-
tation in these columns. Hat-moving is a spiritual phenomenon as
well as table-moving, and as the hat of the Spiritual Magazine is going
round, we do not mind giving it a turn:—

viously acknowledged, £75 Os. t)d. Subscriptions for this object are earnestly
solicited, and may be sent to the Editor, as abovo."
We have no wish to impede the success of the Spiritual Magazine
considered as a commercial undertaking; nay, we will go so far as to
express the hope that we may not damage any pecuniary interests
which the Editor of that journal, or other parties connected with it,
may be suspected, from the tone of some of their replies to criticism,
to have in the credit of professional Mediums. If the publication of
the above appeal shall procure the Spiritual Magazine a lew additional
subscribers, we shall ODly have rendered a small service to struggling
writers of fiction. We have no desire that the Spiritual Magazine
should perish, though we expect that it will shortly have to give up
the ghost.
The Ladies' Fashionable Siphonia.
Tn consequence of the recent wet weather many sensible ladies have
taken to wearing their Crinoline outside of their walking dresses, in the
form of a framework of gutta-percha tubes, serving the same purpose
as the pipes which conduct the rain-water from the roofs of nouses.
The dress which is worn over Crinoline extends to such a circumference
than an umbrella affords it no adequate protection, saving nothing but
the bonnet, so that it can only be defended from the showers by a
system of drainage, which is managed by an arrangement of Crinoline
combining utility with elegancet
ADVENTURE WITH ECONOMY.!
"Ma, Pukch,
"As the taste for Alpine climbing is a very expensive
one, particularly to that parent of juvenile tourists who is ironically
called 'the Governor,' allow me to suggest a means whereby the same
amusement, essentially, may be practised in this Metropolis at the
small cost of 'id. Let the railing be removed from the spiral staircase
in the interior of the Monument, and let the cage also, which encloses
the top of it, be taken away. The wind is generally very high up
there, and what with that, and the chances of feet slipping, and people
jostling each other in their way up and down, the peril of ascending
the column would be nearly if not quite as great as any that could
attend an attempt to scale the Jungfrau,* or any other mountain, peak,
or horn in Europe. Moreover, the ascent of the Monument would be
practicable at Christmas, when the idea of climbing Mont Blauc is out
of the question, and might also be hazarded on a Saturday half-holiday
by adventurous young men who now, at no season of the year, can
afford an excursion to any mountainous district more dangerous than
that of Hampstead.
"If the Monument, the Duke of York's Column, and all such
structures were only rendered sufficiently unsafe, those youths would
be enabled to realise, to a much greater extent than they can now, the
advantages of the Early Closing Movement. I have, Mr. Punch, with
a dozen children and a narrow income, the honour to be,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FRENCH COOKS AND ENGLISH EATERS.

LAMORIClfcRE'S VOW, OR HE
WOULD BE AN ALVA.
He would be an Alva, vowed and aware
The red-hot, Lamoriclere;
Through him, the papacy restored
Should be, with waiting fire and sword.
The towns which spurned the Pontiff's sway
Should be his mercenaries' prey;
He'd turn his ruffians loose, to kill,
Burn, spoil, and work their bestial will.
But ere he went on this crusade,
The Frenchman sought celestial aid;
Thus, kueeling at Loretto's shrine,
Invoked the female form divine:
"0 spotless Queen! Celestial Rose!
Lend me thine aid to crush my foes;
Remembering that those foes are mine,
Because they are the Pope's and thine.
Adorable and most adored,
Behold this ornamental Sword;
Thine, if 1 conquer, it shall be:
Here will I hang it up to thee!"
Unheard was the Crusader's prayer,
Wholly by winds dispersed in air;
Because, there's too much ground to fear,
Though dolls have ears, they cannot hear.
Our Hero's doom was dire defeat,
A s expeditious as complete;
His army driven from the field,
And be himself obliged to yield
Fulfil, though thou hast lost the game,
Thy vow, Crusader, all the same;
Thy deity of wax, stone, wood,
Thy prayer had granted, if it could.
The will is equal to the deed,
And merits no inferior meed;
So let thy sword, in spite of scorn,
The angel-shifted house adorn.
For, now that weapon's work is o'er,
Thou should'st resign it evermore:
Drawn against Freedom—drawn in vain—
Oh! never wear that Sword again.
THE POPE AS A LOGICIAN.
The Pope seems in a muddle in his mind
as well as his material affairs. Here, for
instance, is a proof of his confusedness of
intellect, in an address he issued lately to a
regiment of French soldiers sent for his
piotection:—
"Mark well, my dear sons, that the Church stands
in noed of no man's help in support of her spiritual
sovereignty; for being therein directly protected and
enlightened by God. for from requiring the aid of the
powers of earth, it is she who upholds nations and
empires. But since it has pleased Uod, in the pre-
sent dispensation of his Providence, that for the free
exercise of her spiritual sovereignty she should also
possess temporal power, it is this latter power, my
very dear sous, that you are called to defend in its
integrity. Great and glorious mission 1"
To our thinking this is rather out-al -elbow
sort of reasoning, and is congruous in that
respect to what may be the temporal position
of the Pope. Indeed, it shows the Holy
Father is quite clearly on his last legs in the
point at least of intellect, however he may be
in more material possessions. If the Church,
as he affirms, be m her spiritual sovereignty,
"directly protected" by the Divine power,
this protection surely must extend as well to
her temporal possessions, which, His Holiness
alleges, it has pleased Heaven to bestow on
her to secure her the free exercise of her
spiritual sway. Clearly, then, the Church is
independent of man's help, not less in her
material than in her spiritual sovereignty;
and if His Silliness the Pope be true to his
own logic, he will at once ask the French
army to withdraw, and beg of Irish friends
to make no more subscriptions for the secular
Support of the pillars of their Church.
N Michaelmas Goose-day, dear Punch, happen-
ing to be in town (London, when quite 'empty,'
contains, lam informed, above two million people),
I dined with a City Company—I will not make
the others envious by specifying which. Being
of a reflective and a contemplative mind, I own
I found the dinner a most gratifying repast. I
shall not soon forget the gurgle of enjoyment
with which old Guttleton sucked down his
second plate of turtle; having, to secure the
possession of that luxury, it seemed to me made
somewhat of a gallop with the first. A younger
man, I own, I wished I had a similar digestive
apparatus, and no more apprehension of the
evils of good things. Judging from the way in
which old Guttleton gulped down as much of
them as he could get, he clearly did not need to
be flogged with laurestina leaves, which G. H. M.
assures us is provocat ive of appetite. Nor could
lie have apprehended any bodily embarrassment
from the culinary richesses which he made away
with. Whatever robur et as triplex were the
lining of his stomach, I feel convinced he stuffed
and swilled without the slightest fear of suffering
the next morning. Nobody I thiuk could gor-
mandise with such a gusto, and suck his lips with
such a smack of satisfaction, if he knew that all
the agonies of biliousness awaited him. What
Damocles could feast with such a smile upon
his lips, when he felt assured he had a headache
hanging over him; and knew too by experience,
how it would come down on him, and pierce his
brain with pangs as sharp as any sword could
doP ".
"But I did not take my pen up to talk to
you of Guttleton. It was the dinner, not the
diners, that I wished to say a word about. Of
course I need not tell you that although the day
was Gooseday, we ate something besides geese.
There was turtle I have said, and there were
turbot, eels, and cod, there were soles and there
were whitings, and though somewhat out of
season, there was not at all bad salmon. From
this account of the first course you may fancy
those which followed; although perhaps you
won't conceive that—albeit the day was the last
Saturday in September—we had Pheasants,
actual Pheasants, Sir, served up in the third
course: and what is more, they were not in the
slightest smuggled in, but, Sir, their name was
boldly printed in the carte, and not even the
chaste synonym of 'Owlets' was resorted to.
As a sportsman, I, of course refrained from eat-
ing of this dish; and I could not help reflecting
had a foreigner been present he might have
fairly gone away with the ridiculous conviction
that the Aldermen and other lords who form a
City Company are superior to the vulgar ope-
ration of the Game Laws; a supposition which
might justify his fancying that the Sovereign of
the City is superior to the Queen.
"But, Sir, what I most had to complain of
in this civic bill of fare was its foreign phrase-
ology and polyglot profundities. These disturbed
me even more than its plain outspoken English
—though I still think that the 'pheasants'
might have left a flavour less unpleasant on the
palate, if the cook had veiled their name in the
more decent obscurity of some dead or unknown
language. Unaccustomed, as I own I am, to
public dining, I am not acquainted with the
slang of the cuisine, and when I see such appel-
lations as 'Oratin de Coq de Bruyere' or
'Quenelles de Volatile aux Truffes,' I have not
the least conception what dishes—no, I should
say, plats—they represent. The faint remem-
brance I possess of the language of our neigh-
bours (I was at a Public School, Sir, aud of
course did not learn much of it.) I find avails
me little in clearing up the puzzlement in which
at every line I'm plunged. Supposing I remem-
ber that 'crevetle is a shrimp, and buisson' a
bush, that 'timbale' is a kettle-drum, and

'financiere' what it sounds. How can that remembrance explain such
mystic phrases as' Crevettes en Buissons' and ' Timbales a la Financiire,'
which perplexed me in the bill of fare of which I speak P Shrimps are
common diet, but can a man eat bushes? And who could feed on
kettle-drums, and expect to live? That 'homard' means a lobster
everybody knows; but 1 have looked into my dictionary, and the only
■word for ' Chartreuse' given there is 'Charterhouse.' Yet 'Chartreuse
d'Homard' 1 find confronts me in the carte. Shade of Soyer! Ami
then to eat the Charterhouse! I who spent six years beneath its
classic shades!
"Some dishes, it is true, may be such horrible concoctions that
nobody would dream of touching them if they were known by their
right names. Who would call for that 'Baioinid' which G. H. M.
informs us was served up for him at Moscow, if 'Chopped tea leaves
and salt cucumbers' were put down in the carte /*_ Or who would ask a
Russian servant for a 'Bitot,' if he saw before him a confession of the
fact that the dainty was composed of several chopped meats, mashed
into a mass with honey and stewed onions, vinegar and capers, and
surrounded with stoned olives, sliced lemons, and peas P Moreover,
now and then the converse might occur; and one might miss a dainty
because of its fine name. I myself, the other day, very nearly lost a
taste of that same 'Cog de Bruyere,' because of the word 'Oratin'
which was stupidly prefixed to it, and which, as I conceived, meant
'the burnt scrapings of a saucepan,' a conception which my dictionary
afterwards confirmed.
"I am a plain man, and like to call a spade a spade, and in talking
to an Englishman I can't quite see the good of calling it a beche. I
don't relish a cut let or a cucumber the more for being written 'cotelelte'
and 'concombre' by the cook. 'Capons farcis aux Champignons' may
sound all very fine, but I think 'Fowls stuffed with mushrooms' is
more.pleasant in my ears: and my laughter rather than my palate |s
excited by such polyglot absurdities as Chickens aux huitresr This
entry I observed in the carte the other day, and I suppose when next
a Civic Company invites me, I shall be asked to eat of 'Stewed biftek
aux oysters,' or recommended to take ' Vin sauce' with my 'pouding de
plum.'
"With our advancing sense (thanks to Punch) of what is ludicrous,
surely it is time to put a stop to all this gibberish. As good wine
needs no bush, so shrimps require no 'buissons' in the carte to make
them palatable. Let our cooks serve up French dishes, if they please;
but when they cook for Englishmen, let their bills of fare be English.
We mostly like plain names, although we may not like plain living;
and until our Aldermen habitually speak French (which, judging by
their progress, possibly may happen at the time of the Greek Kalends)
let them beg their cooks to condescend to write in English for them.
"Pray, Sir, lend your powerful aid in this direction, and oblige one
who is free to own he likes French cookery, although it is his fortune
to have been born « ^ Briton."
"THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS."
At Coleshill, in Warwickshire, Mr. Newdegate entertained the
agriculturists by saying that—
"Protection v.-as not dead; it was a principle of our nationality, and burned now
moro brightly than ever."
No, it is not burning. Mr. Newdegatb mistakes for a pure flame
what is merely the phosphorescence of a dead body. Poor Protection
has been buried now for years, and many a fruitful harvest has since
ripened over its grave. It was but right that Protection should give
hack to com what in its lifetime it took from it. Why does Mr.
Newdegate attempt to play the part of a resurrectionist? If Pro-
tection is still burning, it must look uncommonly like a gas-lamp that
we sometimes see accidentally flaring in the day-time, and, in charity,
the pale, flickering, and ghastly thing should be pat out. Nothing
could be more out of place in our day.
Momentous if True.
The appended statement, heterographic but thrilling, is contained in
a letter from Cologne, published by a contemporary :—
"Tho Prince Reoem accompanied the Queek as far as Ditrcn, whence ho pro-
ceeded to Juliors."
What an interesting if illiterate announcement! The Prince Re-
gent proceeded to his cousin Julia's, the writer of the above piece of
intelligence obviously meant to say. When he left Julier's did he go
on to Aunt Ahblier's? The Almanack de Cotha only knows!

SHAVING A SERIOUS THING.
The attention of Sabbatarians is earnestly called to the subjoined
copy of an advertisement :—

"the Gospel. By 0EOAOrO2. M. A. Cantab. London. Saukdeks «j Otlkt.
Messrs. Saunders & Otlet publish many novels, but the serious
world need hardly fear that the work above announced is a novel.
There is, indeed, novelty in the idea that Shaving is a Breach of the
Sabbath; because every morning is not Saturday, and many people
shave every morning. Neither is every morning Sunday, if that is the
day which we are to suppose to be meant by the word Sabbath. True
it is, however, that some old clothesmen never shave at all, for some
reason or other, which may possibly be the belief that Shaving, under
any circumstances, is a breach of the Jewish Sabbath. And certainly
there can be no doubt that shaving on a Sunday morning, or daring
any portion of Sunday, is a desecration of the Sabbath just as flagrant
as that of travelling by an excursion train; for it is by no means
necessary: and this is probably the truth which the author of the work
under consideration, but which, like many other reviewers, we have
never read, most probably wishes to impress on the serious public.

King Victor's a wretch and a horrible thief,
Blasphemer, church-robber, and slabber,
And I m happy to think he'll one day come to gtief
For being so greedy a grabber.
As touching the soldiers who died in my cause,
No fate could be better or sweeter;
I certify all have escaped from the jaws
Of Old N. and gone up to St. Peter.
Regarding the Kings that don't lend me a hand
To work out the Papacy's mission,

They're all on the road to perdition.
I especially hint to the Gollican Sphinx
That his acts are all futile and null, for
While he's making a capital book, as he thinks,
I've booked him for sojourn in sulphur.
So up to the aid of your father the Pope,
Who gives you these elegant wiggings,
Don't force him, as Yankees would call it, to slope,
And make tracks for unsanctified diggings.
Save the Chair of St. Peter from being defiled
By yon "Parricidal Pollution:"
Draw the Sword in my favour, and don't draw it mild,—
And this is your Pope's Allocution.
LORD DERBY S LAST.
Why is a man without any acquaintances in the Sporting world like

A MICHAELMAS GOOSE COOKED.
Our facetious contemporary, the Spiritual Magazine, among a host
of compliments in this month's number, pays us this :—
"Wo are well pleased to havo Punch as an enemy rather than as a friend, for he
is doing good to the cause by making it more extensively known, whilst he dare
not Introduce at all such a subject favourably into his columns."
The Spiritualist mind, we are informed, does not reason. What it
knows, it knows by intuition only. From the mundane power of
reasoning it is completely held aloof. Hence we cannot feel surprised
at the above absurd assertion. To any other intellect than that of a
Spiritualist it must be obvious at once that inasmuch as Punch has a
character (as well as a family) to support, of course he "dare not
speak" in favour of such humbugs as the Spiritualists; because if he
so belied himself and mis-stated the plain fact, his circulation and his
character would equally be injured. A truth so obvious as this it was
quite needless to state; but as a Spiritualist seldom has the chance to
tell a truth, we can hardly be astonished that the chance should be
laid hold of.
As for the assertion, that Punch has done good service to the
Spiritualist cause by making known the trickery T)y which it is sup-
ported, this statement, on the face of it, bears such likelihood of truth
that we hardly think it needful to question its veracity. All that we
can say is, that the Spiritualists are quite welcome to the lifts which
we have given them; though we rather apprehend that were they to
confess the truth, it would be found that they have pocketed more
kicks by us than halfpence.

Talk of French Politeness, the ConttiMionnel, in speaking of the

THE BATTLE OF THE BEGI8TRATI0H COUETS.
ekjawin Bupples, Esq.,the
Revising Barrister, for the
West-Eastern and South-
Northern Districts, yester-
day held his court at. the
Mastodon Hotel, Mega-
therium Road, for the pur-
pose of going through the
electoral lists for the pa-
rishes of Choakley, Ditch-
ington, Bodger Hamlets,
Blokebury, and Gnasham.
Mb. Jolliboy attended for
the Conservatives, and Ma.
Chaffers for the Liberals.
The Choakley list was
first taken.
The Revising Barrister asked what fool had made out such a list
as that.
Ma. Gapeseed, overseer of Choakley, stated that he was the party
inquired after by the learned barrister.
The Barrister asked him, whether he would like a presentation
to the Asylum for Idiots, as that was the best place for a man who
could lay such a document on the table of a court.
Ma. Gapeseed asked where he was to lay it.
The Barrister instaut.ly committed him for contempt of court, and
disfranchised the parish of Ctioakley.
Mr. Gruntbr, an elector of Choakley, submitted that it was
very hard that lie should lose his vote because the overseer was an ass.
The Barrister said it served the Choakley electors right for electing
asses as overseers, and ordered Mb, Grunter out of court.
Tlie Ditchiugton list came next.
Mb. Wibblk was objected to by the Liberals. He claimed in
respect of a freehold house and grounds which had been in his family
for sixty years. The objection taken was that he had described the
house as a mansion-house.
The Barritter. What do you call this a mansion-house for?
Mr. Ifibble. I suppose I may call my house anything I like. Mb.
Squeeks says a man may call his house an island if he pleases. There
is uo law against it.
The Barrister. Then I '11 make one. The Mansion-house is in tbe
City, and nowhere else. Do you mean to say you are the Lord
Mayor P
Mr. Wibble. Bless me, no, Sir.
The Barrister. How dare you swear in a court of justice, Sirf Leave
this place, Sir.
Name expunged.
Mr. Bunkebbt was objected to by the Conservatives. He claimed
in respect of a house and shop in Poppleton Street. The objection
was that, he did not live there.
The Barrister. Do you live there. Sir?
Mr. Bunkerby. Yes, Sir; and I dye there, also, Sir.
The Barrister. None of your ribaldry, Sir. What's your case, Mb.
Jolliboy P
Mr. Jolliboy said that Ma. Bunkerby did not sleep in the house,
and therefore it was not a residence.
The Barrister. You need not tell me that, Ma. Jolliboy. I suppose
I know that if a man does not sleep in a house he does not reside there.
What do you mean by not sleeping in this house, Ma. Bunkerby?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, as a respectable elderly man, for
not going home to bed. Where do you sleep—at the Mummums, or
under a dry arch of Ricketty Buildings?
Mr. Bunkerby. I sleep generally at my other house in St. Peter's
Wood.
The Barrister. Sleep generally, Ma. Jolliboy, what does he mean
by lhatP I've heard of sleeping soundly, and sleeping heavily, and
sleeping lightly, but I never heard of a man's sleeping generally. Do
you ever sleep particularly, Sir.
Mr. Bunkerby. Yes, Sir, I sleep particularly well when I have been
reading any of your honour's published works. (Laughter.)
The Barrister. Ha! ha! Not so bad. Well, Gbnebal Sleeper,
you may go to your military duties, as we shan't trouble you to come
to the hustings.
Name expunged.
The next objection was by the overseers, and was made to the rote
of Mr. Pindar Wakepield. It was alleged that the voter was dead.
Mr. Pindar Wakepield attended, and begged to state that he
was not dead.
The Barrister. You know I must have proof of that. What is the
use of an unsupported assertion P
Mr. Wakefield. VVould my punching the overseers' heads induce your
honour to give consideration to the question whether I am alive or not P
The Barritter. I cannot, Ma. Wakepield, deoide on a hypothetical
case; but if you were to do as you propose, I should be able to give you
an answer.
Mb. Wakefield, who was much excited at being described as dead,
here made a rush at the overseers, who fled out of Court, followed by
the avenging claimant of electoral rights.
Name retained.
The Bodger Hamlets list came next.
Ma. Jolliboy took a preliminary objection to its being received.
The Barrister. I know nothing of Conservative or Liberal, but I
suppose you have found that there is a preponderance of claimants
whom you don't like over those you do, and so you are ready to sacri-
fice your own men in order to damage the other side.
Mr. Chaffers. You've hit it, Sir, by Jove.
The Barrister. A.nd I 'II hit you, Sir, that is to say with the strong
arm of the Law. if you talk in that flippant manner. If you mean that
I have accurately indicated the animus of the objection, I know I have,
and need no information from you.
Mr. Jolliboy. Far, Sir, be such a paltry design from me, or from the
great, powerful, and respectable body I have the honour to act with.
But, Sir, the late Sir Robert Peel nobly said that the battle of the
Constitution was to be fought in the Registration Courts. In tbe
interest of that Constitution, Sir, the envy of surrounding nations, and
the pride and glory of our own, I am here to protest, as emphatically
as my humble ability will permit, against the reception of that dis-
graceful, despicable, and disgusting document. I ask you to look at
it, Sir, and I ask you if the British Constitution can be considered
safe in the hands of officials who—nay, Sir, look at it, and with your
own impartial eyes judge it—who have spelt Hamlets with two "t's."
That, Sir, is my case, aud I demand the rejection of the list.
The Barrister. It is so spelt, certainly. Look at it, Mr. Chaffers.
Mr. Chaffers (without looking at it). Indeed, Sir, you could not have
given me greater pleasure than by your assurance. I trust, indeed,
that it is so spelt. Had it been otherwise spelt, it would have been
my painful duty to ask you to reject the list. But the overseers of
this parish, Sir, however much they may be sneered at by the minions
of Toryism
Mr. Jolliboy. Withdraw minions, or where would you like this ink-
stand P (Snatches it up.)
Mr. Chaffers. A. Tory had better let ink alone—he always makes a
mess with it. But if the word annoys my friend, I will substitute
contemptible tools, and proceed to add that the overseers have stood
by tbe old spelling, that in use when Hampden died on the scaffold,
and Sydney on the field, for the liberties of England; and that the
list is made out in accordance with the Constitution, with tradition,
with prescription, and with precedent.
The Barrister. This is a very important and difficult question. Will
you have a case for the Court of Queen's Bench, or will you sky a
copper which way it shall go?
Mr. Jolliboy I'm agreeable to the copper.
Mr. Chaffers. Sudden death P
The Barrister (ikies the coin and places his hand on it). Go it—who '11
ory?
Mr. Jolliboy. Woman!
The Barrister. 'Tis. Women are always for bad spelling. I refuse
to receive the list, and the overseers of the parish will go to the
House of Correction for three months with hard labour. (Applause tn
Court.)
No case of interest arose subsequently, except that of Mr.
Lobkins, of Gnasham, who was objected to by both sides, and who
attended to support tiis claim.
The Barrister. You don't seem a favourite, Ma. Lobkins. What's
the objection of Mr. Jolliboy?
Mr. Jolliboy. I see that we have made a little mistake, and that Ma.
Lobkins is an excellent Conservative. I can only apologise to him
for the trouble we have given him. I hope that we have not incon-
venienced him much.
Mr. Lobkins (savagely). No; you've only brought me about six
hundred miles from the north of Scotland, where I was shooting. I
have just got out of the train.
Mr. Jolliboy. Really, though! Have we P I trust you had good
sport. How are the grouse?
Mr. Lobkins. Wild, as I am at being dragged to town iu October.
You '11 see about that, next election.
Mr. Chaffers. Will a Liberal candidate be favoured with your intelli-
gent support on that occasion, Mr. Lobkins?
Mr. Lobkins (emphatically). Yes, by George, he will, Sir! even if he
is as great a Pump as the sitting Member.
Mr. Chaffers. In that case I have much pleasure in withdrawing my
objection, as I know your vote to be perfectly good, aud I should be
very sorry to deprive you of a constitutional right.
Mr Jolliboy. Stop, though. I am not so sure, on looking at my
paper
The Barrister. You shut up. You withdrew, and can't speak again.
Mr. Jolliboy. I would not think of it, Sir. I meant my Times. I

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.

OOSTUMI OF A "VALET." Tl MP. HENRY THE
CHAPTER XXXII.—PERIOD-THE REIGNS OF HENRY THE
FOURTH AND FIFTH.
N an inventory taken at the
death of Henby the Finn
there is mention of a "peti
coat," manufactured of red
damask, and having open
sleeves. But for this adden-
dum, one might have almost
thought the garment was the
one which is exclusively
conGned to female use; did
not one remember that the
monarch was residing in
Paris when he died,* and
that the word "peti" was
doubtless put instead of
"petit," by the French
valet de chambre who no
doubt made out the list.
We may therefore think this
petticoat was simply a small
coat, being perhaps so called
in distinction from a great
one. It was however not
at all uncommon at this
V period to see small swells
"~ attempting to make great
girls of themselves by wear-
ing clothes which looked
much more as though they
had been made by a milliner
than a tailor. In many of the figures represented in old manuscripts
the sex is to be scarcely distinguished by the dress; and as the gentle-
men, we find, very commonly wore gowns, it is not at all impossible
that petticoats were also included in their wardrobes.
That men-servants dressed like women in the same way as their
masters, we have proof in some remarks made by the poet Occlevs,
which occur in one of the quaint poems he composed, concerning "y"
Pride and y* Waste-Clothing of hordes Men:"—
"What is a Lord without his men?
I put case, that his foes him assail
Suddenly in the street, what kelp sh:ul he
Whose sleeves encumbrous so side trail
Do to his lord : he may not him avail.
In such case he is but a woman;
He may not stand him in stead of a man;
His arms two have might enough to d",
And something more, his sleeves up to hold."
In the reign of Henby the Foubth a decoration first appears, the
origin of which is differently accounted for. This is the collar of Esses,
which Camden says was composed of a lot of letters S, that being the
initial of Sanctis Simo Simrucius, an eminent Roman lawyer, and
the collar he adds was chiefly worn by men of that profession. Other
writers say that the collar had its origin in the initial letter of the
motto "Souveraine," which Kino Henby the Foubth bore when he
was Earl of Debby, and which, as he afterwards ascended to the
throne, appeared to have been auspicious, and to have brought him
great good luck. But whatever were its origin, it is certain i hat the
Collar was worn during his reign: and one old writer tells us that so
many titled fools were in his time distinguished by it, that instead of
* We trust that wo may note without giving offence to our friends across the
Channel, that after the battle of Agincourt Kino Henry the Fifth caused himself
to be electod heir to the French crown: and that having espoused the Princess
Catherine, daughter «f Kino Charles, of France, he flxod his residence at Paris,
and lived ther e till he died. By the treaty it was provided that France and England
should, in future, for ever bo united under the samo King, but should still retain
their respective laws and privileges; including of course the privilege of pieking
quarrels with each other whenever anything, or nothing, might set them by the ears.
calling it the Collar of Esses, ">' common folke were wont to nick-
name it y" Collar of Asses." A specimen of this Collar may be seen
in an old drawing, which is in the Punch Collection, and which illus-
trates the anecdote of how the judge, Sib William Gascoigne, was
-truck in open Court by the madcap Pbincb of Walks, for having
fined Sib John Falstaff for wrenching off a door-knocker, and
having been found drunk and disorderly in the street.*
One of the chief features in the costume of the fourteenth and the
fifteenth centuries was the variety of fashion in the hoods which were
in use; as if, says Mb. Faibholt, "as if the ingenuity of fashionable
changes had been directed most to decorate the heads that had invented
them." In the illuminated MSS. which may be viewed as the Books
of Fashion of the period, we see all sorts, of hoods and caps and other
kinds of head-cover; some of the first enveloping the shoulders and
the neck, and of the latter some like nightcaps, and some like our
modern wideawakes. These latter were worn mostly slung around the
neck, for in fine weather the head was left in general uncovered, and the
luxury of an umbrella not having been invented, our forefathers when
it rained used first of all to throw their hoods over their heads, and
then for further shelter used to clap their caps a-top of them. One of
the oddest looking of all the hoods in use was made to cover the head
and shoulders, and to reach down to the elbow, having pointed ends
which peaked out from the head on either side. This hood is still on
view in a drawing in the Romance of .V/. Graal and Lancelot, which
any one may see in the British Museum, if they only take the trouble
to go there and apply for it. To save them this exertion our artist
has, however, made a copy of the picture, and they are at liberty to
test the faithfulness of his designs by comparing the original with the
sketch we here subjoin:—

This charming vroik of art, which was executed doubtless by one of
the most eminent domestic painters of the period, throws as much light
on the customs as the costumes then in vogue, and is therefore doubly
serviceable to the student of the time. For fear of misconception we
may as well just state, that it represents a countrywoman in the act of
churning, to whom a blind beggar is shown approaching to ask alms
carrying one of his (twelve) children in what looks something like a
chemist's mortar at his back. Besides the
curious hoods worn by the beggar and his
baby, the observer is requested to observe
the careful way in which the girl (or
?grandmother) has put her apron on to save
ler dress from splashes, and has tied her
kerchief round her head and neck to shield
her from bronchitis, toothache, or sore-
throat. Notice also should be taken of the
manner in which her gown is pinned up at
the bottom, to show off her dark petticoat,
which is left visible beneath it; and the
eye of the observer should likewise be
especially directed to the dog, who is
advancing towards her with the platter in
his mouth. This interesting creature
should command a close inspection, be-
cause it shows us the antiquity of this
mode of street-begging; and, indeed we
think the animal can hardly be regarded
without some sentimental feelings, for
when we view the tray or platter in his mouth we seem to see quite
clearly that the creature was an ancestor of our much lamented friend,
the famous Poor Dog Tray.
To show that swells were extant thenadays as much as they are
nowadays, we should note that in the fourth year of the reign of
Henby the Foubth it was thought needful to revive the sumptuary
laws which bad been previously enacted; but we scarcely need observe
that such enactments almost always proved to be dead letters, and that
* Of course every child remembers how the prince was committed to prison for
this offence; and how his father, when be hoard of it, is reported to have said,
turning up the whites of his eyes as he did so, *' Happy is the King that hath a
magistrate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon such an offender; ay,
and still more happy is he in having a son who is found willing to submit to such a
chastisement."

to revive them was in general a useless and unprofitable attempt.
Among other regulations it was now provided that nobody but ban-
nerets or men of high estate should wear cloth of gold, of crimson, or
of velvet, nor should they use the fur of ermine, of marten, or of
lettice,* nor wear long hanging sleeves, or gowns which touched the
ground. Four years afterwards it was ordained that no man, of what-
ever rauk or wealth, should wear a gown or other garment that was
cut or slashed in pieces in the form of leaves or letters, under the
penalty of forfeiting the same; and it was ordered that the tailors
employed by such offenders should in future be imprisoned "during
the king's pleasure" for abetting.the offence. Should any sumptuary
laws be enacted in our time, we trust that this wise hint will not be
lost upon our senators. We think too that the penance might with
profit, oe extended, so that female culprits might also be subjected to
it. Were our milliners made liable to get a month's hard labour for
sending out a dre9s of more than proper amplitude, we should soon
hear that wide petticoats were going out of fashion, and in proportion
as they lessened would the comfort of the masculine community
increase.
by this last sumptuary statute, "sergeants be!
(whether "at law" or "at arms," it is not
privileged to wear whatever
huods they pleased, "for
the honour of the King anil
the dignity of their station."
Moreover, the Majors of
London and of certain other
places were exempted from
any prohibition as to clothing,
and t herefore might come out
as great swells as they chose,
or as their Mayoresses would
let them. Whether Sir
Richard Wiiittington took
advantage of this privilege
is a question we must leave
t o antiquarians to settle; and
we fear it will not much
assist them in their labour,
if we bring before their notice
a curious old drawing, which
represents Sir Richard (who i
then was simply Master \
Dick) as he appeared when
sitting with crossed legs upon
a milestone, peeling a turnip
while he listened to the
pealing of Bow bells. The
picture is _ however worth
preserving in our Book, for it shows what sort of dress was worn in
boyhood at tliis period. Among other points of interest we may
especially point out the long points of the shoes: which remind us
of the formidable chaussure of the goblin who sat upon the tomb-
stone and kicked old Gabriel Grub.

AUTHENTIC PORTRAIT.
a heading as ' Whatever is, is Right' which Dr. Child has chosen for
the title of his book. Wc look upon it as a highly useful statement,
as it nicely lets the cat out of the Spiritualist bag, and by affirming
that a liar is a natural necessity, it shows us the professors of that
faith in their true light. If in the ethics of the Spiritualists a truth,
aud "what we call a lie," are in the great plan of existence alike
"lawful and right," of course no Spiritualist would shrink from
trickery and fraud in order to encourage a belief in his false faith.
But there arc far worse things than lying, which, according to this
Child, a person may at times be spirit-moved to do. Prefacing his
dictum by saying that "no commandment, either written or spoken,
ever yet had any influence upon the soul," and that "there is no such
thing as Spiritual culture coming from the teachings of another," the
Doctor next informs us that, in Spiritualist ethics, killing is no murder,
or rather that murder is no killing of the soul: thus flatly contradicting
the Scriptural assertion which tells us that "the soul which sinueth,
it shall die:"—
"Murdor has no influence upon trio soul: it la a thing of tho material world In its
influence. It haa no Influence upon apiritual existence, of vhick it is an effect. When
tho murderor kills hia brother, he strikoa a blow that will par.ilyso every love of hia
own earthly existence. Then tho affections of hia soul must cling to something;
and if hia love of earth becomes broken by the awful deed of murdor, and the con-
sequent punlshnn-nt that he moeta, apiritual things aro next grasped, and |>crhapa
sooner grasped for the commiaaion of tho deed. The murderer does his deeds in
darkneas: he does not commit the deed with a view to advanco tbo progress of hia
■ souL Ho is moved by an tmaeon and irresistible powor to commit what seems to
us tho 'evil' deed. Every murder that ovor was committal has bcou inevitable:
in tho bosom of naturo has existence the luvfut cause, of which murder hoi been the
effect."
We are informed that Dr. Child at present lives at Boston (in the
Shires, not in the Slates). For Boston his residence may ere long be
changed to Bedlam, if he goes on writing such insane stuff as this.
Were it, not in sooth for its obvious insanity, such a doctrine as the
Doctor's might entitle him quite fitly to a residence in Newgate, to
expiate his blasphemous contempt of God's commandments, and his
wickedness in framing an excuse, if not indeed an incentive, for a
crime.
The extracts we have given, and others we might give, had we not
more respect for our readers than the Doctor has, form part of what
he flippantly has termed his "All Right Doctrine." He has been
brought to a belief in it not by reason or by teaching, but by simple
intuition, and by spirit-revelation. Reason he regards as "an effect of
the soul that is allied to material philosophy, and with the material
things of earth will sometimes give place to the higher development of
intuition." Truth, he deigns to tell us, "is developed in the soul by
intuition always. The soul never did nor never can receive that which
to itself is a truth, from external teachings, from the school-house or
the meeting-house." And so we are informed that—
Evetyreal Spiritualist la a
evidence. Philosophy never
.itnalist alono from Intuition, not from
a Spiritualist, and never will."
* This lettice, Cotorave tells us, was a whitish greyish beast; but whother it be
counted now with the extinct animals we must leavo FRorxssoa Owen to decide.
THE A. B. C. OF SPIRITUALISM.
It is a pity that the Spiritualists (at least for their own sake it is)
are not more reserved in the statements which they publish. They
might have many more disciples—or shall we call them dupes?—if
they did not themselves take such pains to repel them. But a
Spiritualist seldom shows his hand on paper without making clearly
manifest his mental imbecility; and the natural result of this unlucky
manifestation is, that nobody but fools will condescend to listen
to him.
To show what simpletons have lately assumed the name of Spiritual-
ists, we beg to call attention to a little book which has been written by
a certain Dr. Child, for the instruct ion of the children of the Spiritual-
ist faith. This "A. B. Child, M.D," we learn, is one of the bright
stars whose radiance illumines the Banner of Light, a Yankee Spiritual-
ist paper which is said to have subscribers, aud we presume therefore
readers, in our own enlightened country. What a shining light is
Child, and how much good must be done to the Spiritualist cause by
the general diffusion of his literary beams, may perhaps be somewhat
judged from this brief extract from his book:—
"What is a Lie ?—A Lie is true to tho cause that produced it; so what we call
a lie is a truth that exists in nature, just as real as is what we call a truth. Tho
cause of a lie exists in nature, tho cause of a truth exists in nature, and tho effect of
oach causo is wrought out in nature. Naturo is always true in her work; so both a
truth and what we call a lie are lawful and ric:ht in tho great plan of existence. A
lie Is a truth intrinsically ; it holds n lawful place in creation; it is a necessity.
Really? Doctor! Well, we own you do astonish us. To think now
that phdosophy will never make a Spiritualist! Whoever would have
thought it! And conceive too what a bold asserter is the Doctor,
when he sweepingly affirms that a Spiritualist has never once been
found among the learned ranks of the philosophers, from Plato even
down to Punch I
As we began by saying, it is a pity (for themselves; for others we
incline to regard it as al>enefit) that the Spiritualist writers do not
take more pains to be a little less discordant in their theories, and a
little more discreet in revealing what their spirits (whether mixed or
neat) may move them to let out. A writer in the current number of
the Spiritual Magazine grandly talks of Spiritualism as "an all-powerful
influence, which possesses the power to raise man, body, mind and
soul, to a higher position even whilst on earth, than poet ever ccm-
ceived, or any but a prophet ever hinted at." How far this description
agrees with the "All Right Doctrine" which Dr. A B. Child puts
forth to us as being (if wc may make this use of his initials) tlie
A B. C. of the Spiritualist faith, we leave to readers not so childish as
the Doctor to decide. To our thinking the gallows is the only "high
position" that is likely to be reached by a believer in a doctrine which
excuses murder, justifies a lie, and would shut up as useless our
churches and our schools.

/ESOFS SELECT EABLES.
THE SEA-NYMPH AND THE OCEAN SWELL.
One morning, when there was a heavy Swell upon the sands, a gentle
Nymph walked forth, her blue eyes beaming with joy, her flowing
tresses crystallised with dew. The Swell, struck by her beauty, and
solicitous to win her admiration, paused, and proudly shook his own
long wavy curls. "Canst thou not spare, sweet Nymph," he said,
"from that tieasury of beauty one captive-making locki"'—"Where
would'st thou have a lock P" quoth she, "not on thy understanding,
that's confined enough already."—" Oh, cruel." cried the crest-fallen
Swell, "thou knowest I am thy slave."—" I know thou art a surf,"
she answered, "and a most wicked flatterer, for while thou art kissing
the pale sands, thou art running of them down."—" One lock of thine,"
returned the Swell, "would rivet my devotion, and banish all incon-
stancy." The arch Nymph shook her laughing face, and said, "Oh,
restless Swell! how canst thou dream one lock of mine would make
thee constant, when thou art moved by every sportive air P"
Moral. Put no trust in those who wildly fling themselves at beauty's,
feet, for what can be expected from such insane worshippers but
bubbles and foam.
THE SLOW COACH AND^THE LITTLE DUCK.
A Slow Coach had often observed in passing a little Duck, who with
her mother and sisters lived on a village green. "Some fine day,"
said the slow Coach, stopping and regarding the little Duck with a
dreary smile, "when I can get a licence, you shall go to market with
me."—" Thank you," returned the little Duck, proudly lifting up her
bill, "but if I wait till you find it convenient to get a licence, perhaps
I may wait till peas are out of season. I never encourage slow
Coaches: when I wish to go to market I shall travel express."
Moral. We here see the error of procrastination. Dawdlers are
always snubbed. The little Duck, though somewhat pert in her tone,
was quite right in her principle. A Coach that makes lumbering
excuses for not being able to carry one, should be put down as an
obstruction and a pest.
THE YOUNG MONKEY AND THE UGLY MUG.
A Young Monkey, in the uniform of a Middy, sat at the mess-table
(H. M. S. Dandelion) gazing admiringly at an ugly mug belonging to
the First Lieutenant. What are you thinking of, Mr. Slt P " demanded
the ugly Mug.—"Of my Sister, Sir," replied the young Monkey, wit.h
becoming humility.—" Your Sister I" returned the ugly Mug, grimly,
"is she pretty? —" She is considered so, Sir," replied the young
Monkey; "I had a letter from her this morning."—" Indeed, and
what does she say P" inquired the Mug, pushing a bottle of Cape
Madeira towards the young Monkey.— She says, Sir," rejoined the
latter, "that she would be exceedingly pleased if I would send her
your portrait to put in a brooch."—" Ha!" cried the ugly Mug, radiant
with vanity, "Fill your glass, Mr. Slt, and I think you wanted leave
of absence? you shall have it, Mr. Slt: fill your glass, Sir, your health
Mr. Sly."
Moral. A young Monkey who goes to sea should always have a
pretty sister: he may thereby obtain many little indulgences as sweet
to a young Monkey as cocoa-nuts, if he happens to meet with the ugly
mug of a First Lieutenant.

A CHANCE FOR JFAMES.

"Sir,
"You are always chaffing us poor servants. One week a six foot ladies'
flunkey with large calves and a foolish face is represented by you as giving warning,
because his master rides outside the omnibus; next week his feiiow servant is
caricatured because he objects to carry up coals to the nursery. To judge from
what you say of us, one would think tiiat there were no such things as good
servants or bad masters and mistresses. 1 know very well that this is only your
fun. I do not believe, Sir, that you really think so, and
1 feel sure that if you can do anything to improve and
raise our condition, you will do it. And if you will allow
me, I will show you how it can be done.
Let the butlers, footmen, coachmen, and grooms of
England enjoy a little 'early closing' too. Let our masters
ana mistresses do without us for a couple of evenings
every week; let us join the Volunteer movement, and let
us go to drill like other Hritons. Look here, Sir. There
are fifty houses in Belgrave Square. On an average, in-
cluding stable servants, there are eight men servants to
each of those houses. Tour men from each house could
easily be spared once a week; and with them, two strong
companies of the first Belgravian Grenadiers might at
once be constituted. We are all young straight-grown
well-fed active good-looking fellows, even you admit that;
we are all accustomed to wear uniform, and to keep it
clean, and to be silent and obedient, and we are English-
men. What more is want ed to make good soldiers P There
are about t hree hundred houses in Lowndes Square, Eaton
Square, Eaton Place, and Chesham Place; from each of
them let us have three men, and you will have at once out
of but five squares and streets of London a regiment above
a thousand strong, which will, I feel certain, be second
to none. We shall be very glad to be relieved now and
then from our domestic duties, and to blunt the shafts of
your ridicule by letting you see we are not such lazy
good-for-nothing dogs as you represent us to be; and, if
the movement is supported as it ought to be, in the course
of three months seven or eight thousand additional Volun-
teers may be added to the defence of London. It will not
be too much to require, in return for this, that the maid-
servants should attend to our door bells and fires, say, on
Wednesdays and Saturdays, after 2 o'clock, p.m.
"I am, Sir,
"Your humble Servant,

BKIORT ARMED FOR THE TOURNAMENT. TEMP.
I1ENUT TUB FIFTH. PADDINQTONIAN MUSEUM,
CHAPTER XXXIII.—IN WHICH WE BID GOOD BYE TO
HENRY IV. AND V., AND SAY HOWDEDO TO HENRY VI.
F the elegant costumps
which were worn hy the
civilians in the two first of
these reigns, we gave in our
last chapter an elegant de-
scription. It now remains
for us to say a word or two
about the armour and the
arms which were in use
about that period, although
in neither of them is there
much of noveltypresented
to our notice. We observe
however that the steel shoe,
or solleret, was sometimes
laid aside, and that its place
was supplied by footed stir-
rups. Moreover there is
certainly a marked increase
of splendour in the mili-
tary equipment. The swell
knights of the day wore
around their bascinet a rich
wreath or band; and the
border of their jupon was
ttil 1 elegantly cut into the
form of foliage, notwith-
standing the provisions of
the sumptuary statutes.
With regard to this quaint
fashion of cutting borders
into leaves, one of the old
writers (who never lost a
chance of playing upon
words) states that English
tailors "lirst did take
French leave to take it from the French :" but it is a matter of
some doubt to us, whether this remark was based on actual truth, or
was merely made for the small pun which it involved. Somewhat
questionable likewise to our mind seems the story of how when King
Henry the Fourth was asked, if his jupon should be bordered with
an oakleaf or an aslileaf, he replied, "1 had as lief to leave it to the
knave to indent which leaf he liketh; for if he trieth to make an oak-
leaf he is full sure to make a (h)ash of it!"
Since the time of Edward the Third civilians had not seldom worn
feathers in their caps; but, excepting as heraldic crests, plumes had
not been sported by knights until this period. In the reign of Henry
the Fiptii we first find them adopted as military ornaments; and they
either were stuck upright on the helmet or the bascinet (in which
event the plume was called, correctly, a "panache"), or, at a later
time, were worn at the side, or falling backward, when the proper term
to apply to them was "plume." We mention this distinction just to
show our readers how minutely accurate we can be if we choose; but
as these minute descriptions are generally dull, we cannot let them
often intrude upon our space.
The great crested helmet, called otherwise the heaume, was now
exclusively reserved for wearing at the tournament: as the bascinet
sufficed for ordinary purposes, shielding wearers from the blows of
weapons and of winds. This headpiece we described when it was
introduced (namely in the reigns of Edward the First and Second,
and of course our careful readers must remember our description. All
that we need add to it is, that at this period its shape was slightly
changed, being curved behind so as to De more closely fitting to the
head. In this respect it bore resemblance to the salade, a kind of
German headpiece introduced in the next reign. We must take care
not to mix t hi; salade with the bascinet, because the two, although so
much alike, were really different; and as the salade was first used as
an article for dressing in the time of Henry tub Sixth, it would be
premature to say at present much about it.
A fashion somewhat curious was that of wearing with the armour
large loose hanging sleeves, made of cloth or silk or even richer sub-
stances. These in general were part of a kind of cloak, or surcoat,
thrown over the whole suit; but sometimes they are shown as though
they were detached, and were worn without the surcoat, being fastened
to the shoulder, and falling to the wrist.
For further information respecting the knightly equipment of this
period the reader will do well to read up what is said about it by
Monstrelet, St. Remy, Elmuam, Bonnard, Froissart, Cotgrave,
Chaucer, Occleye, Shakspeare, Asumole, Meyrick, Mills, Fos-
brooke, Fatrholt, Planche, Strutt, and some few dozen other
writers on the subject, whom we have no time now more closely to
consult. All that we can add in the way of illustration of the military
costume, is a copy of an interesting picture we possess, representing
■Sir John Fahtaff as he appeared when he was sent to grass by fiery
Ilottpur, whom he fought so many hours with, as he said, "by Shrews-
bury clock." The original picture (in point, at least of measurement) is
one of the very greatest works of art we are acquainted with; for the
figure of Sir John Falttaff, being painted of life sire, occupies upon the
canvas about twenty-five square feet.

POttTBArr OP SIR JOUN FAL8TAFP WINNING THE BATTLE. MIUTART COSTUME:.
TEMP. HENRY TUX FOURTH.
We come now to the period of King Henry the Sixth, regarding
which a trustworthy authority observes:—
"If any proof were wanting of tho confusion and disorder of this unfortunate
monarch's reign, it might bo drawn from the apparel of his people, which appears to
have been a jumble of ail tho fashions of past ages with overytuing most ridiculous
and extravagant that could be disoovored at tho momout. It were a vain task to
attempt a minuto description or classification uf the drosses of this period."
As vanity forms no part of our mental composition, we shall not try
our hand at this unprofitable task; but shall content ourselves with
simply noticing a point or two which appear to our mind worthy of
attention.
Commencanl par U bout, or more correctly par U boot—whether the
game of footbull was in vogue about this time i3 a question which
debating clubs, if they like, may argue; and if they incline to a decision
that it was, it remains for them to settle as to how the players played
at it—any one who looks at the preposterous long toes, in which, says
Strutt, the dandies strutted in this reign, might with reason doubt if
active crural exercise were possible; and might think the art of kicking
became almost extinct.
So far as we can judge, too, the coverings for the head were quite as
queer and quaint-looking as those used for the feet. Of the horned
and heartshaped headdresses in fashion with the ladies, we shall speak
when we describe the feminine costume. But the men wore forms of
hendcover nearly as fantastic, and the variety seems endless in the
caps * worn by the chaps. Some wore them stuck erect., some bore
them cocked or slouched; and every size and shape appeared in vogue
at the same time, from the biggest of big bell-toppers, to the smallest
of small hats. We have hunted up some dozens of old drawings in
rare manuscripts, and in no two are the kinds of braincover alike.
Some hats are made peaked, as being thought perhaps piquant; and
while one dandy wears a high crown Ukea brigand's in a bullet, another
sports a structure not unlike a gothic pepper-castor, which pinnacle-
wise sticks up from the centre of the skull. In short, we shall not
much exaggerate in stating that the caps or hats or "bonnets" of the
time whereof we are treating were every whit as odd and ugly as those
of our own day. Nearly ever}' sort of wideawake in fashion now was
worn; except perhaps the species known as the "porkpie," which it
was reserved for modern taste to introduce.
As a good many of our readers are Kuights of the Garter, it may
interest them to know that the robes of this Most Noble Order were
* The word "cap" wo should notico, as well as that of " bonnot," is applied by
learned writers (other than ourselves) to various sorts of widen wakey-Looking
forms of headcovor, to which wo now more commonly should giv-o tho name of
"tut."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

YOVNO OENTH,
twice altered in tbis reign; the hood (or chaperon) and surcoat being
changed from white to scarlet in the thirteenth year, and then shortly
afterwards again being coloured white. When the order was first founded
we learn they both were blue, and at various after intervals we find
them spoken of as purple,
black, again blue, violet and
while; indeed, the colour of
their robes was so continually
changing that the Garter
Knights were chaffingly ad-
dressed as Knights Chame-
leon, instead of Knights Com-
panion. Not less' singular—
or rather plural—were the
numbers of garters which
were broidered on their vest-
ments; the allowance in this
reign being no less than a hun-
dred and twenty for a Duke,
and gradually decreasing down
to a Knight Bachelor, who
was permitted to wear sixty
on his hood and surcoat, or
as we perhaps might now say,
hat and overcoat. No re-
striction was placed upon the
robes of royalty; and on
Henry's hood and surcoat the
number that were broidered
was a hundred and seventy-
three. It seems rather odd to
us that he selected this odd
number, but we learn from
Ashmole that the fact was
even so. We should certainly
have fancied that a hundred broidered garters was quite enough for
any single man to wear; and although the King was married, we think
he might have done without the extra seventy-three.
Lawyers and Lord Mayors and other men in offices were gorgeously
arrayed in gowns made rather long and full, sometimes parti-coloured,
trimmed and lined with fur, and girdled round the waist. To keep
their learned heads warm, they wore hoods with a long tippet, or
streamer, hanging from them, whereby they were sometimes slung over
the shoulder. \V e read in an old chronicle, which is too badly spelt to
quote, that in the year 1432, when Henry came to England after being
crowned the reigning King of France (how his reigning there was
stopped and how he had to mizzle, the recollection of the reader will
not need us to relate) the Lord Mayor of London rode to meet him at
Eltham, being arrayed in crimson velvet, and a great furred velvet hat,
wearing about his middle a splendid girdle of gold, and having a golden
baldrics fastened round his neck, and trailing down his back. His
three henchmen, or pages, we are told, "were in one suit of red,
spangled with silver j" while to add to the effect, the aldermen wore
scarlet gowns with purple hoods, and all the city commonalty white
gowns and scarlet hoods, with divers cognisances embroidered on their
sleeves.
We think if Lord Mayor Cubitt, instead of having ballet girls and
men in brass from Astley's to dance and prance before him in proces-
sion to Guildhall, were simply to array himself in crimson and in gold,
and, to crown all, were to clap on a great furred velvet hat, and were
then to caper, with his aldermen and henchmen, through the usual
Guy Day route, he certainly would make an exhibition of himself that
would be vastly more attractive than any Lord Mayor's Show which it
has ever been our fortune, or our misery, to witness. By what means
he could possibly prevail on his three henchmen to appear like their
old aneestors in only "one red suit" between them, is a matter we
confess we are unable to determine, but which possibly a spirit-rapper,
or some other conjurer, might help him to decide.

A Musical Key Wanted.
TnE Athcnaum and the Musical World are always alluding to "The
Musical Pitch." We don't know what this may be, but should say it
was the very thing for a grand incantation scene, like that in Der
Freischiitz. Perhaps Dibdin composed all his celebrated Tar songs
with this same musical pitch f or is it a kind of wash that the
Ethiopian Serenaders are in the habit of using to black their faces
with? Of course it is never used for light music P
a well-seasoned armt.
It was with the greatest difficulty that Hannibal transported his
army.over the Alps oy means of vinegar—but you will see that Louis
Napoleon will carry his troops over with the greatest ease the
moment he gets them mustered.
MARRIED TO MUSIC.
An unusually comic "Marriage in High Life," on Saturday last
week, took place, according to the Morning Post, at another Temple of
Hymen than St. George's, Hanover Square. The superior classes are
now out of Town, and nothing is going^ on at the crack matrimonial
temple there but ordinary divine service. Edinburgh, not London,
comprised the site of the sacfed edifice wherein these nuptial rites were
celebrated. The exalted couple were an Honourable of the harder sex
and an Earl's daughter of the softer. The report of these aristocratic
hymenieals states that the bride "was conducted to the altar by her
guardian," a Duke, and that—
"As tho bride advanced to the altar, the organ played ILsndel's anthem, 'Sc-
ceedinff ffUut.'"
The bride ought to have been much obliged to the organ. Of course
I he anthem it played was performed chiefly with a devotional view,
and not for a purpose analogous to that of a polka. Still, in advancing
to an altar to be married before it, a young lady wants some support
rather stronger than a smelling-bottle and the arm of her guardian.
Common brides cry on these occasions, and sometimes faint. Nothing
can be better calculated to fortify the heart and sustain the spirits of
anybody in the immediate prospect of marriage than one of old
Handel's anthems—let it be even a funeral one; they are all so jolly.
Perhaps, however, "Happy We," from Acis and Galatea, would have
been even more seasonable and suitable than "Exceeding glad." Oh!
say not that it would have been inappropriate to the sanctity of the
edifice and the solemnity of the occasion. For read on, and you will
arrive at the statement following:—
'' Tho marriago ceremony was then performed by tho Very Rev. E. B. Ramsay,
Dean of Edinburgh; and as the marriage party left the chapel, MEKSKLsaonN'e
'' Wedding March was played on the organ.
St. John's Chapel, Edinburgh, is indeed a Temple of Hymen." Men-
delssohn's " Wedding March" is a movement in the secular direction
considerably a-head, we suppose, of anything in the way of musical
accompaniment to matrimony yet ventured on at St. George's, Hano-
ver Square. What would the Bishop say if he heard that a marriage
party had been played out of a London church with that jubilant compo-
sition—the gem of the music in the Midsummer flight's Dream? Per-
haps, that no tune in the world could have been more opportune; only
in the next similar case he would rather have it played just outside the
church door by a German band, or, with due respect to the high order
of the music and rank of the happy pair, by the orchestra of Her
Majesty's Theatre.
Should, however, the Bishop o? London not object to illustration
of the marriage 'service by dramatic music, the example set at St.
John's, Edinburgh, may be improved on at St. George's, Hanover
Square. If the bridesmaids do not advance to the altar, they may at
all events retire from it to the celebrated chorus and waltz assigned to
their representatives in Carl Maria von Weber's immortal opera.
Mozart, in Le Nozze di Figaro, might also be laid under contribution
to supply harmonious embellishments for marriage in high life. Then
Rossini and the rest of the Italian school could be unlimitedly drawn
upon. Meyerbeer could furnish selections from Bobert le Diable;
and there is no reason why Satanella should not be applied to the same
purpose, except that Satanella is an English opera. Could not the
whole matrimonial service be sung as well as said, responses and all;
a musical clerk officiating for a bridegroom without ear?
But the worst of all this will be that the lower orders, aping their
betters, and at the same time actuated by their own inferior tastes, will
also want to get married to music. Is there not a song called "Come
let us all haste to the Wedding?" This is the kind of thing you would
have at St. Giles's if at St. George's you permitted " Giovineitichefate."
Then one thing would lead to another, and you would have couples in
the costermongery line advancing to the altar whilst the organ played
"Drops of Brandy," and dancing out of church to the "Devil among
the Tailors."
St. John's Chapel, Edinburgh, is of course an episcopal chapel, and it
is to be feared that the matrimonial music performed there on the
auspicious occasion of a recent "Marriage in High Life," will not, if
it should come to the ears of the Scottish public, induce the national
mind of Scotland to renounce its definition of a church organ as a
"kist fu o' whistles."
Consolation for a Royal Culprit.
It has been rumoured that Mons. Victor Hugo is in Naples. It
might be an act of charity if the illustrious French author were to send
the King, who is kept a close prisoner at Gaeta, a copy of his well-
known wort, "Les Derniers Jours d'un Condamne."

Tourist {who has been refreshing himself with the Toddy of the Country.) "I bhay,
Ole Fler! Highlands seem to 'gree with you wonerfly—annomibhtake.
Why, you look DOUBLE the Man already!"
PAPAL CREDIBILITY.
The opening sentence of the Allocution lately pro-
nounced by the Pope contains one word which is very
remarkable. His Holiness thus commences:—
"Venerable Brethren,—It Is with incredible pain and profound
sorrow that wo are forced to deplore and condemn new attacks,
unheard of till these days, committed by the Piedmontose Govern-
ment against us, the Holy See and the Catholic Church."
Incredible is the epithet of all possible adjectives which
the Pontiff chooses to apply to the emotions which he
declares himself to feel. Does he, then, indeed not care,
and suppose that nobody can believe that he really cares,
a baioccno about being relieved of his temporal power?
If so. why does the Holy Father persist in making assertions
which he knows can deceive nobody? Popes will be
Popes; but even a Pope might be content with the assertion
of that which is untrue. It is, as the common people
say, cutting it rather too fat to affirm a thing with the
distinct avowal that it is incredible. But no. In the
present instance there can be no doubt that the Pope
means what he says. There is every reason to suppose
that he does really feel very acute pain and exceedingly
deep sorrow at the prospect of losing his temporal authority.
His Holiness may assure himself that the world will
readily believe that all the suffering which he professes to
endure on that account is genuine and unaffected. He
does himself injustice in describing the pain with which his
paternal heart is affected at the idea of resigning his earthly
kingdom as incredible. /
Historical Parallels.
Cuakles tub Tbnth, when he was bundled out of
Paris, amused himself by shooting sparrows along the road.
Francis the Second, being summarily kicked out of
Naples, has been amusing himself at Gaeta by firing off
protests and protocols. Both sports are equally harmless,
and we don't know which fall more dead, or which are more
worthless—the sparrows or the protocols?
TRUE IN THE END.
Homceopatus make this hoast—that the Allopaths dis-
pense medicine, and they dispense with it. This may be
partially true, owing to their losing their patients so very
quickly.
BEDCANDLE PHILOSOPHY.
Among other household comforts, we see advertised some bedcandles
which are made "to burn half an hour only," and which require "no
snuffing" and emit "no sparks." It is obvious, we think, to any
ordinary intellect, that these candles are expressly constructed for
young ladies, and in especial for young ladies of a sentimental turn,
who nightly take a long time in "doing" their back-hair, and in
heaving up a sigh or two while thinking of the locks which they—
how willingly !—could spare for Arthur or Augustus, if Arthur or
Augustus would but breathe a wish to have them. Instead of getting
into bed at once and going off to sleep, there are many girls who
thus stupidly dawdle at their dressing-table, and spend half the night
or more in silly suspirations in the lieu of useful sleep. To check this
senseless habit, these half-hour-lasting bedcandles appear to be well
fit ted, and no mother of a family of sentimental daughters ought to be
without them.
Another of their benefits is, that they are likewise eminently fitted to
put a stop to the dangerous and deleterious practice, so common
with young ladies, of reading trash in bed. The stuff and nonsense
which is annually emitted to the world through the economic medium
of the circulating libraries, we rather t hink is largely read between the
sheets, and keeps awake unhealthily the feeble minds whom it excites.
Girls who come down in the morning with dim eyes and pallid cheeks,
may safely be accused of being addicted to this practice; and to cure
them, we should recommend these half-hour-lasting candles, with one
of which they should be furnished every other night. In early life late
hours are extremely detrimental; and, being past that age ourselves,
we do not hesitate to say that children of eighteen or so. both mascu-
line and feminine, ought nightly to be sent to bed much "sooner than
they are. Nothing (except, perhaps, a bad night and a headache) can
be gained by sitting up to sigh about one's lovers, or by lying down to
read the life of Laura the Lone One, or drop a tear upon the death of
the Doomed Love of the hell! If a bad night and a headache were the
only ill effects, one would not care so much perhaps to check these
baneful practices. But late hours, as we have said, occasion pallid
cheeks: and as wife-requiring bachelors look out generally for rosy
ones, the habits we complain of may tend to make young ladies hang
upon their fathers' hands; and therefore, for their parents' welfare and
their own, these half-hour burning bed-candles should be rigidly served
out to them.
THE NEXT DANCE.
Yes, dance with him, Lady, and bright as they are,
Believe us he's worthy those sunshiny smiles,
Wave o'er him the flag of the Stripe and the Star,
And gladden the heart of the Queen of the Isles.
We thank you for all that has welcomed him—most
For the sign of true love that you bear the Old Land:
Proud Heiress of all that his ancestor lost,
You restore it, in giving that warm, loving hand.
And we '11 claim, too, the omen. Fate's looking askance,
And Fate, only, knows the next tune she will play,
But if John and his Cousin join hands for the Dance—
Bad luck to the parties who get in their way.
The Scarlet Scold.
"Unjust, cruel, impious, detestable, hypocritical, impudent, sacri
legious, insolent, atrocious," are specimens of the epithets applied
to Victor Emmanuel, his Government, and his acts, in the Papal
Allocution; which is full of abusive language. His Holiness the
Pope calls himself the successor of the Fisherman. His language,
however, smacks less of the Fisherman than of the Fishwife.

cussion of about an hour
upon the beautiful wedding
presents made to Lady
Emma Talbot, the elegance
of the left-hand figure in
the last plate in le Follet, the wretched weather which has nipped the
autumn flirtations so sadly, and the extreme stupidity of most of the new
novels, it was proposed that the Meeting should proceed to business.
The Chairwoman said that she wished somebody else had been put
into the Chair, for she had not the slightest idea of what was wanted
of her, and she had really onlv come in to please her friend Mrs. De
Crapaud, who had insisted on bringing her.
Amid cries of "O my dear" "You really must," "Her rank, you
know," &c., Mrs. Bland was induced to retain her seat.
Mrs. Bland. Well, my dear creatures, it's sadly unbusinesslike to
choose the very worst President you could find; but just as you please.
Now, Mrs. Nangles, will you kindly state what we are here for.
Fido, darling dog, do he down.
Mrs. If angles. At last justice is done us, so far as mere words go.
At last, Women, Man, from his hall of council, has'been compelled to
proclaim our superiority. Hitherto, as every married lady present can
testify, we have only had to open our lips upon any political, legal, or
social topic of the day, to be apprised that we could not understand it,
that we did not know its various bearings, and that we had better con-
fine ourselves to our own proper spheres. Do you not kale the words
Proper Spheres, Ladies? (Vehement applause.) But I am happy to
say that we are not likely to be again exposed to such tyrannical imper-
tinence. A speaker at the Glasgow Congress declared, and the brutes
—men, I mean—around him gave in their long withheld adhesion to
the sentiment, that Law cannot be reformed unless We "take it in
hand," and that "Ladies are the Best Law-Beformers." {Applause.)
Any admission being made, I need only ask you whether it would be
womanly not to take the fullest advantage of it? (Laughter and applause.)
I am answered; and I therefore propose that a Society be formed, to
be called the Ladies' Law-Reform Association, and that we proceed to
"take in hand " the question of the Reforms which we shall demand
of the authorities. This Meeting, of course, is only preliminary. We
have a wide field before us, and I hope that we shall not imitate the
timid, niggling, bit-bj'-bil policy of men, but do the thing all at
once and thoroughly, as you would make your servant clean out a
room.
Mrs. Brompton. I hope a law will be passed directly to make cabmen
more honest and civil. I and my sister caine on Thursday from
Apsley House to the Opera in the Haymarket, and the man wanted
eighteenpence.
Mrs. BotebeU. Is the new opera a nice one—Robin Ilood, I mean P
Mrs. Brompton. 0 delightful that is, for English music. You know
no Englishman can write any music like Verdi's. (General assent.)
However, it was a great success.
Mrs. Boabell. \Vhose music is it P
Mrs. Brompton. Upon my word I didn't look, but I know somebody
said it was an English opera.
Mrs. Bland. It is by Mr, Macfarren, an intensely clever man,
my dears, and a musician worth a dozen of Virdi. And I assure you
that it is not the thing, now, to pretend to know nothing about English
people. Excuse the hint.
Mrs. De Crapaud (in extacies). O.Mrs. Bland, my dear! Any
hint from you, I'm sure!
Mrs. Sallowby. There ought to be a law that when any of those
dreadful cases occur, like—(Cries of Yes, yes)—you know, and the
ridiculous policemen cannot find out who did it, everybody who is near
the place shall be cast into prison and kept on bread and water till they
confess. (Great applause.)
Mrs. Tufton. I really think that the present state of the law about
debts is very wrong. The other day a case occurred under my own
knowledge. Captain Swoshingham, some of you have seen him at
my house—well, I don't say that he is the wisest creature in the world,
but he is excessively handsome—he had an action brought against him
by a perfumer. Soldier-like, he tossed the papers in the fire, and did
not condescend to take the least notice of the matter.
Miss Gusher (enthusiastically). Brave creature! I like that.
Mrs. Tufton. The wretched perfumer went on, my dears, with tho
aid of his horrible attorney, and one day Captain Swoshingham,
while he was dressing himself, was actually dragged off to prison at the
instance of that contemptible perfumer.
Mrs. Bowker. But he had had the perfumes, I suppose P
Mrs. Tufton. Of course he had, and used them, or had given them
away, for he is the most generous creature breathing. There ought to
be a law to prevent such disgusting impertinence in tradesmen.
Miss St. Clair. I only wish I was the Judge, or Chancellor, or what-
ever you call it, and a paltry ugly mean-looking tradesman came before
me to annoy an officer and a gentleman.
Several voices. Ah!
Mrs. Meekham. I think there ought to be a law for preventing the
lower classes from smoking their pipes in the streets. Really the whiffs
of tobacco one gets in walking are perfectly dreadful. I would make
it transportation for any common person to smoke anywhere except iu
one of his own apartments.
Mrs. Tufton. I don't think that gentlemen would support the putting
down smoking in the streets. Officers are very fond of Weeds, as they
wittily call them, and—
Mrs. Meekham. My dear, I did not mean that for an instant. I
mean bricklayers, clerks in public offices, and that sort. Indeed, it
would be better (thoughtfully) in a philanthropic point of view, if such
persons were forbidden to smoke, because they could put the tobacco-
money into the savings banks for their families. (Applause.)
Mrs. Spoonbury. Well, now there's another thing. The beggars,
what a nuisance they are, and yet one don't like to be harsh with them,
poor things, especially when they have children (applause), but it is
quite wrong that they_ should torment you in the street, and keep the
poor little things out in the cold. 1 think we ought to have some sort
of law about that.
Mrs. Frackleton. I think that any lady who sees a beggar, should
give her a card, and this should be shown to a policeman, who should
immediately be obliged to see to the poor creature's being clothed and
fed, and sent home with a little money in her pocket.
Mrs. Spoonbury. And the expense P
Mrs. Frackleton. Of course lhave thought of that. It is a great shame
that such large salaries should be given to lawyers, and bishops, and
those kind of people, while the poor starve. So I would cut down all
those salaries, and use the money for the relief of the poor.
Mrs. Bland. My dear soul, I have not a word to say for the lawyers,
but perhaps as I accidentally happen to be a little more among the
bishops than some of you, I may assure you that the high payment is
perfectly essential. There are a thousand reasons why it is absolutely
necessary. I have had it explained to me fifty times, and—you must
omit the bishops from your plan.
Mrs. De Crapaud. Oh, my dear Mas. Bland! Why, you know
everything.
Mrs. Tufton. Why, it stands to reason that a bishop's business is
with the religion of the aristocracy, and what respect can a Duke or
Earl have for a two-penny curate r
Mrs. St. Rubric. I must be allowed to say that I do not think you
quite understand that subject. The two-penny curate, as you are
pleased to call him, is as much part of the Church
Mrs. Bland (laughing apologetically). May I say Order, Order? 1
think we had better confine ourselves to Law Reform. I'm afraid
that if we get into ecclesiastical matters we shall find differences
among us.
Mrs. Tufton. I don't want to sav anything. I was only supporting
your view of the matter, and remarking that you can't expect noblemen
and that kind of personages to be instructed by scrubby curates.
Mrs. St. Rubric. I won't have curates called scrubby.
Mrs. Tufton. I beg your pardon—you won't?
Mrs. St. Rubric. I won't. I suppose curates, who are educated
gentlemen, and have been to College, are as good as stupid officers
with their mouths full of smoke and slang.
Mrs. Tufton. An officer is
Mrs. Bland (interfering). Is my brother, and another of my brothers

you that they are both very good creatures in their way, but we did

"The Chancellor or the Exchequer also acknowledges the receipt of £12 5*. Gd., on account of
violations of the Game Laws, from 'Scotub.'"
"Scotus, I zed when I read out this here whilst we was partakun o' revresh-

Scotus a Scot, says young Miles, who's a bit of a

CHARITY IN SPORT AND EARNEST.
Mr. Joseph Bond has proposed to the Jockey Club,
that a sum of ten per cent, upon the Derby and Oaks
Stakes at Epsom should be annually divided among six of
the London Hospitals; promising that, if his proposal is
adopted next Spring, he will then meet the donation with
an equivalent out of his own pocket. The legislature of
the Turf should act on Mr. Bond's suggestion. The
'ossy character ascribed to the stable mind would get
considerably elevated in public opinion through association
with institutions which in stable-talk are commonly called
'ospitals. Moreover, those hospitals which are at present
dependent on voluntary support would thus acquire, in a
measure, the nature of stable institutions.

KISSING BY PROXY.
"Verbena Villa, Tuesday.
0 my dear punch,
"Dear Old Pet,
—I dare say you re-
member that I wrote
to you the other day
to say how glad I was
to find that our dear
darling Prince op
Wales was (retting
on so charmingly with
our cousins in Ame-
rica — though why
they 're called our
cousins, when we talk
of 'BrotherJonathan,'
and they talk of 'Uncle
Bull," I'm sure I
really cannot for the
life of me determine.
But while 1 said how
pleased I was to find
how well the Prince
got on and how proud
we all should be of
him, you know I had
to add a word of sad
regret that the girls he
had to dance with
were such clumsy
partners, for the pa-
pers, you know, told
us what great awkward things they were; and how they wobbled in their waltzing; and how
the Prince had to turn dancing-master, and teach them how to hold themselves; and how, to
show how bored he was, he never once danced twice with any single one of them! *
"Well, from an extract I've been reading in the Illustrated News, it seems at last the bad
behaviour of the girls has been enough to sour the sweet temper of the Prince; and I must
say I'm not surprised, and I don't feel very sorry for it. The way they trod upon his toes,
no doubt, was painful in the extreme, and I'm sure an angel (only angels have no corns)
could not have borne it better. But patience has its limits, and at last the Prince, poor
fellow! was so terribly imposed upon that he took on the offenders a most, terrible revenge. This
is what I read this morning to Papa, who now that Parliament is up will listen to the letters
of 'our own Correspondents,' and any other tittle-tattle that I happen to pick out for him:—
"At Guelph the Prince was sung to by twenty-nine young ladles, whom ho rewarded by proxy, kissing
the daughter of the Mayor for them all."
"There now, wasn't that a terrible revenge to take! Only just conceive how shamefully the
girls must have behaved, for the Prince so to ' reward' them, as in irony we're told he did.
The writer does not tell us what was their offence, whether they sang badly, or giggled, or
threw sheepseyes at his Royal Highness. But whatever their fault was, they were most
severely punished for it. Just conceive the degradation of being kissed by proxy! as if one
wasn't pretty enough to he personally kissed! I declare if I'd been one of the unhappy twenty-
eight, I don't think I could possibly have long survived the shame of it.
"Of course it must be charming to be kissed by royal lips, and I must own that I envy
much the daughter of the Mayor of Guelph, who will delight to tell her grandchildren the
honour that was done her. Of course she wili be viewed now as no ordinary match, and
may hold her hand up for the very highest bidders. A girl whose cheeks have been saluted
by a Prince, may expect to get a lord if not a marquis for her husband. To be sure, they
haven't lords and marquises in Canada, and Miss Mavor may wait a long while there before
she catches one. Still it must be a great pleasure to her to think how she was kissed in the
presence of the Court, and was singled out from such a number of competitors. Oh, how I
do wish I'd been she, and had that odious Julia Wriooleton to stand where she could see
me! She's got re— no, auburn hair, and watery sky-blue eyes, and such big feet and freckles,
that I'm quite sure and certain she'd have been one of the eight-and-twenty. I can't think
how cousin Charley can see any beauty in her; but I'm persuaded that the Prince would be
much too good a judge to do so.
"It was too bad, I declare, that his Lordship—or should I say his Grace?—the Duke
op Newcastle allowed his Royal Highness to make eight-and-twenty enemies, at a place too
which is clearly named after his own family. But still I must repeat, I do so wish I'd been
Miss Mayor (or whatever else her name may be) and had had Miss Julia to stand and see
me do it!
"Ever, Mr. Punch, your most attentive reader,
"Georgiana Gushingtok."
"P.S. I'm told that in Court circles they sometimes court by proxy. For the Prince op
Wales's sake I hope it isn't true. But if it is, one feels more reconciled to being born a
common person."
* This, Miss, was matter of Court etiquette, not liking. And the papers did wt say the girls wcro
"wobbling waltxers." It is your jealousy, young lady, which invents such cruel phrases.—Punch.

Assurance.
THE END OP THE SEA-SIDE
SEASON.
Our Ramsgate Correspondent writes to us
as follows:— If the ghost of Goldsmith were
to rise up at this time, with the wish to add a
line or two to his Deserted Village, he could not
well do better than take the train to Ramsgate,
and muse in 'mournful numbers' on its melan-
choly aspect. Everything and everybody soon
would clearly enough show him that the season
is all over. Even the poet Thomson, who wrote
four ibooks about the Seasons, could hardly find
materials to write two lines now about this.
The few visitors who linger sadly on the pier flit
noiselessly as though they were the ghosts of the
departed, and pass with downcast looks as
though ashamed of being seen there. They move
about with all the air of melancholy maniacs,
and if they stay much longer they will run the
risk of being carried off to private madhouses,
and clapped into strait waistcoats. The steam-
boats come in daily with nobody on board except
the crew and captain. The shilling-an-hour
boatmen have laid up their crafts in winter
quarters, and have rigged their better halves
in bran new gowns and bonnets. The bathing
machines are all drawn up so high and dry that
it seems to be a problem if they ever will be wet
again. Not a donkey brays defiance on the
beach: not a bath-chair now is visible, even
with a telescope. Not a wooden spade or sand-
heap is there by the sad sea waves; not an
organ, or a bagpipe, or a German band is audible.
AIT the minstrels with blacked faces have taken
themselves 'off to Charlestown,' or some other
locality; and the Tyrolean Tenor who sings so
sentimentally and sweetly out of tune, with one
eye closed in strong emotion and the other
looking out for coppers, has left us with his
wife and small harmonium - playing son, and
is probably; now singing to some al fresco
inland audience. More saddening fact still—
the vocal vender of crisp hardbake, delicate
drops, and tempting toffy, has at one fell swoop
deprived us of his sweet songs and his sweet
stuffs, and has left us lollipopless to lament his
absence.
"Paragon is a wilderness; grass is growing
in High Street, and hay, if there were sunshine,
might be made on half the pavements. The
shopkeepers have mostly put their chains and
shutters up, and are now engaged in counting
over their unholy gains and in sending con-
science money to the Income-Tax Collector.
The lodging-letters have emerged from their
coalcellars and dustbins, or whatever other holes
be in the summer-time their sleeping places. It
is believed that they would occupy the bed-rooms
which in summertime fetch five guineas a night,
but that they are haunted with the ghosts of
recent victims, who came, saw, and were fleeced,
and fleabitten into the bargain. The flys have
flown away, or else are hibernating in back
slums; the riding horses have returned to their
normal occupations, and are now drawing
bakers' carts, or working in a circus. The hotel-
keepers have vanished to visit their estates, or
confer with Baron Rothschild about buying
up the Bank, as a safe way of employing some
of their spare millions. In short, so dull is
Ramsgate, that the brigand's occupation is, like
Othello's, gone. A cat or two are now the only
beasts of prey left provable. Even the fleas, it
is affirmed, have this week hopped the twig.
Their flight has been described as the Retreat
of the Ten Thousand."

NOVELTY FOR NEWSPAPERS.
In the '* Births, Marriages, and Deaths" published in the papers,
why is it that the ages of the several persons named are specified
under the latter head alone f The Birt hs, of course, speak for them-
selves in this respect, but the Marriages by no means do; for we know
that an age long past the years of discretion is no necessary cause or
impediment why some persons should not join themselves together in
holy matrimony. The ages of deceased parties signify, for the most
part, nothing to anybody but their friends and relations, whereas the
time of life at which people marry is to other people in general a matter
of interest or amusement; of interest when the couple are both young:
of amusement when they are both old or one of them considerably
older than the other. In the case of the aristocracy our contemporaries
could get the requisite information out of the Peerage; and if the
journals, in announcing a Marriage in High Life, always regularly
published the time of that life arrived at by the bride and bridegroom,
the majority of newly-wedded pairs, in sending their names for inser-
tion, would take very good care to mention how old they were.
THE TIDE OF FASHION.
Tite Ornamental Water, which has been absent now for several
weeks, has returned to its Metropolitan residence in the enclosure in
St. James's Park. This is one of the first proofs that town is gradually
filling. We need not say that the Water is looking all the better for
its change. Not only is it much clearer in its complexion, but it seems
also to have increased in volume almost as much as it has gained in
beauty, and looks much healthier altogether. It bas been visited every
day by hundreds of nursery-maids and soldiers, who seem most de-
lighted to see it, back again. We need not state that the Ornamental
W ater is waited upon by its nsual retinue of ducks and other aquatic
birds, who are looking remarkably well just at present in their hand-
some winter liveries, particularly the swans, who are presenting, so to
speak, the very cleanest bills of health.
MANUFACTORY AND MYSTERY.
We are really very ignorant. Every time we take the Tines up we
see a something advertised which completely puzzles us. Here for
instance is a statement which so bothered us at Dreakfast, that we ate
our second egg without at all enjoying it:—
WANTED A PARTNER, of business habits, in a large bond fide
Manufacturing concern. Address, &c.
Now, pray, what's a "bond fide?" What's its usual size? and
how is it manufactured P We notice that this bona fide is expressly
called a "large" one, and our second query therefore instinctively
suggests itself. We are ourselves "of business habits," (only ask our
Printer's boy, who never has to wait above fi hour or two for " copy"
from us), and we might be tempted to en1', as a partner in this adver-
tised "concern." But until we know the aature of what is manufac-
tured in it, of course we should not dream of venturing to offer. Only
think if " bona fide" should turn out after all to be a slang trade name
for bone stuff which we should be "wanted" to manufacture into
bread stuff!
"Know Thyself."
Moralists are always dinning this precept into our ears. We
should hardly venture, however, to recommend it to the notice of Da.
Cullen; for supposing he succeeded, he would be forming a very low
acquaintance.

for instance among outdoor servants the stud groom, head gainekoeper-aud-park-
keepor, and huntsman. If a friend gtvos you a mount, the 'master of the horse'
of the stable expects a sovereign for ono with the foxhounds, and half for one with
the harriers, and yet his only troublo is to give the order and alter the stirrups a
hole or t«o, while the helper who has all the bard work to do receives not a
farthing; it is nearly tho samo with the bead keeper who employs an underling to
clean your guns, and thinks you a very shabby follow if you do not offer him
'golden opinioua' to prove the contrary ; the park-keeper too, if ordered to forward
half a buck, not only helps himself to a portion of it as his usual perquisite, but
anticipates a guinea for the trouble of killing tho deer."

MOST AWFUL.
rtjlt, since the day when
Ireland's hero, Mr,
Smith O'Brien, hid
himself among the other
crawling caterpillars in
the cabbage garden, we
have never had snch
dreadful news from Ire-
land as is contained in
the following extract
from the Kilkenny Jour-
nal:—
"Wo have learned from
a London Correspondent
that the Government has
cautioned the Times against
the insertion of such articles
as that which appeared
latelyin its columns against
the Irish Brigade; not* of
course, that such is not the
true English feeling towards
Ireland, but that it is in-
judicious and impolitic at
the present crisis 1 This
seems confirmed by an
article in the Morning
Chronicle of Thursday, glos-
sing the matter over, and
wondering that the Irish
should feel annoyed at the
abusive article of the Timet.
as their bravery on every
battlefield places them be-
yond the reach of criticism or the obarge of cowardice 1 All very fine. Mr. Chronicle, but Ireland
will never forget that ruffian attack, at a time when she was trembling with anxiety for the fate
of ber brave volunteers. No ' soft sawder ' will blot it out from the national memory, and, with
Heaven's help, thero will be a day of reckoning,"
Ah! These London Correspondents. They are the boys for making discoveries.
Did Lord Palmehston think that because he sneaked meanly out at the back-
door of Broadlands, and spoke to Mr, Sidney Herbert in the kitchen garden
among the clothes that were hanging out to dry, and told him what to do, and
because Mr, Herbert put on a footman's old livery, and went in a bock cab (no,
not a Hansom, British minions, but a close cab, No. 1167, driver Alphonso
Stumper, ha, slaves!), and stole into P. H. Square at one in the morning to give
the hint in question, the London Correspondent of a Kilkenny paper did not
detect every turn in the foul and snakelike career of the cowardly Saxons P Bah!
No, Ireland will never forget "that ruffian attack." Yes, ruffian attack. You
may affect to laugh at it, Saxon dogs, and say that it was a good bit of fun, and a

not ill-natured way of letting down fellows who would have
deserved to be treated as rogues if they had not been such
everlasting fools; but that is only adding insult to insult.
"A day of reckoning will come," and Irishmen, who always
pay their debts, will be ready for the dark hour of vengeance.
Tremble, caitiffs, for the spirit of the Kilkenny cats is not
laid, but bides its time. In the words of one of your own
execrable posts—
"Those who fought and ran away
May live to run another day."
And dire will be the "other day" when the heroes,
happily saved from the Sardinian fiends, shall receive the
mot d'ordre, "Printing House Square, E.C." Not all the
apothecaries' stuff from the neighbouring Apothecaries
Hall will in that day avail to medicine the foes of Ireland,
after her steel lozenges, ha! ha! shall have done their
work. In the burning words of our own bard:—
"We'll tread tho land that hates us.
That demeans and understates us.
We '11 uphold our maxims,
And pound the Saxons,
And we '11 smash the Timet that slates us.
Sword of Honour Extraordinary.
The British Papists are going to present Lamoriclere
with a sword. Perhaps they don't know that the one which
he had to surrender was returned to him again. How-
ever, if the Pope's defeated champion wants a sword, let
the friends of slavery present him with one by all means.
Tbe sort of sword most suitable for presentation to the
hero of Ancona would be one with a flexible blade; such a
weapon as that which Harlequin flourishes in our Christmas
pantomimes, and with which he does, as Lamoriciere in
bis last engagement did, wonders.
Cabmanism Amended.
(A Fact.)
Propriety of diction, as a point of general refinement,
is advancing amongst the drivers of our public vehicles.
A clergyman calling "Cab !" had the gratification of
receiving from a Hansom director the equally respectful
and correct reply, "Here I am, Sir!"

uestions are more easily
asked than answered,
but we should like some
information upon a
curiosity of literature,
which we copy from the
Paris Correspondence of
the Daily Telegraph:—
■* The Eiptnmce of Nantes
says that the director of
Covent Garden has ordered
eight luminous men of M.
Dkhamobot."
Now, pray what are
these luminous men?
We must confess that
we are rather in the dark
about them, and should
consider it extremely
kind if some one would
enlighten us. We have
heard men sometimes
spoken of as being shining
lights, but we have never
before heard them des-
cribed as being luminous.
Moreover, from the man-
ner in which they have
been "ordered" of him,
one would think M.Demangeot had the power to manufacture them;
and one must regard him as a sort of phosphorescent Frankenstein,
endowed with the ability not merely to make men, but to make them
luminous.
If it were not almost too great a liberty to take, we might suggest
that were Archbishop Ct/llbn to apply to fill the place of one of
these eight luminous individuals, the director of Covent Garden might
be tempted to accept him. As one of the bright lights of the Roman
Catholic Church, Da. Cullen might put in a claim to being viewed as
luminous; and seeing how he has lately blazed away for his Brigade,
and what a farce he has been playing to celebrate their obsequies, we
think the Doctor is just fit lor a theatrical engagement, and would
exactly fill a part where he is wanted to be luminous.

pupilage, to have done adulating and to have become khigs. * * " Without a

let out by the spectators, when the Prince fust come in sight of em:—
"His nose is Roman! He seems fagged. Ho looks pleasant! I thought his
hair was lighter. There 'a no harm in that lace, sure. He's regular Dutch 1*
"Wal, there ain't no smack o' the ancient 'age of rudeness' 'beout
sich compliments as them! It must haeve added a good heap to the
'comfort' of the Prince to hear heow we tuk notice of him. Ours is A
free country, and we air mostly sorter free-and-easy in our talk. We
ain't shy o' findin' fault neither, and I reckon as our writers can
criticise a 'coon as well as compliment him. At the Cincinnati Ball,
for example, we air told that'at times the Prince, apparently, was very
much embarrassed,' (Wal, I calc'late them air crinnjleans du
'embarrass' a chap kinder!),'and it was noticed that he made several
mistakes, not being au fait in American style; but he soon recovered
himself, and enjoyed himself in his usual style.' Y' see, our style ain't
like yourn, old hoss; there ain't no sliding over thai. And what may
be the 'usual' go for yer young Rijal Highnesses don't noways not
come up to our notions of what's proper. Guess you oughter send us
yer young Princes and Princesses, jist that we might polish up their
etiguette a trifle, and put a finishing stroke or two upon their ball-room

"Wal, the mornin' arter this, the Prince he went tu Chutch, and
you see such air our delicate attentions to his comfort that even there
be worn't allowed to pass uncriticised. The papers sent tharspecialest
reporters to obsarve him, and his 'movements' through the sarvice
were all minutely chronicled. By this here means we're famished
with most interestin' statistics of the number o' times he coughed, and
whether he ever shut his eyes, and had to blow his nose to keep him-
self awake, or not, which in course it is important fur historians to
know. 0/ his appearance, too. we learn that he was 'dressed as usual,'
and to this the Herald adds, by way of courteous compliment,' Some
people think he is looking seedy; but he is probably saving his best
clothes for his New York visit.' In course the delicate inference from
this here writer's statement is, that the Prince's 'usual dress' is
gitting seedy in the seams, and as he haeve on'y got one Sunday-going
suit, he's forced to save it up for special state occasions, sich as that ar

BRIGHTON JEWELS.
A SEA-SIDE STUDY.
BY A SENTIMENTAL STUDENT.
As I walked out at Margate,
It was but th' other day,
A Jew there sat in a "Porkpie" hat,
At a window that was bay.
I stood and gazed upon him,
To assure me of his race;
I knew not his name, but his birth was plain
As the nose upon his face!
Yet he sported a Forkpie hat!
And I couldn't help thinking that
'Twas a singular thing
For a poet to sing
Of a Jew iu a Forkpie hat!
'Twas extremely rude to stare so,
Of course I well knew that;
But it seemed to me so queer to see
A Jew in a Porkpie hat.
At the hat and the nose beneath it
I gaped and gazed amain,
And I haven't, a doubt, if the truth were out,
I should do the same again.
If still at the window sat
The Jew in the Forkpie hat!
For who could help staring
To see a Jew wearing

to see the pig weighed so handsome—and our two little lads was a
laughing like mad, for really the pig did squeak quite unnecessary
loud. So says the parson, says he, quite sharp like to my wife, 'I do
wonder, Mart, that you should be here at all. aud still more that you
should allow your boys to make diversion of a poor dumb animal's
sufferings. (Dumb hewarn't, no how, by the bye, but that's nought.)
Why can't you let Giles kill the pig by himself, and why don't you
give those two brats a couple of boxes on the ear for taking a pleasure
in seeing such sights F'
"Those were our parson's very words, Sir, and I do believe he were
right: so I told my wife to go indoors and mind her own business, and
then 1 took the stick to Jem and Billt, and sent 'em scampering like
afore I finished the pig, which died beautiful.
"A few days after, my wife she was a reading out to us after supper

SPIRIT-RAPPING TESTIMONIALS.
The Editor of the Spiritual Magazine, and Proprietor of the famous
Spirit-Rapping Ointment, begs respectfully to lay before his friends
and the public a few of the Testimonials with which he has been
I favoured by parties who have availed themselves of his Discovery.
They are but a handful out of thousands, but they fully exemplify the
eminently advantageous working of his system. He may, however,
hereafter submit further evidences of the efficacy of the Discovery in
; altering the present unnatural state of society.

"Sir,—It would be injustice to you, and false delicacy in me, if I
withheld my testimonial to the efficiency of your Spirit-Rapping Oint-
ment, which has wrought, Mussy be praised, the most extraordinary
cure in my own case. Sir, I had been for many years troubled with a
most obstinate complaint in my mind, and I found myself utterly unable
I to_ believe anything. In vain did I apply the strongest remedies, in
I vain did I seek to swallow the blood of St. Januariue, the Winking
I Picture, Mr. Bright's allegations against the upper classes, and other
things which I was told, by friends, if I could once get down, I should
be cured of my incredulity. At last, Sir, in a happy hour, somebody
mentioned your Ointment. I bought but one sixpenny packet, and
i applied it. Sir, I took it in faith, and instantly found that I could
I believe anything. Now, Sir, I am a changed man, and prepared to
! give credit to whatever may be stated to me. As a proof. Sir, I was
5 told yesterday, by an Irish friend, that the Pope's volunteers from
I Ireland had slaughtered thirty times their own number before they
were taken by the enemy, and I never thought of contradicting him.

; applied it, on Monday last, to a table in my possession, and sat down
to watch its effects. In about three minutes I began to laugh, then to
yawn, and my wife, entering the room an hour afterwards found me in
a sound slumber. I had not previously slept for several hours. I have
bought several packets, and am happy to add that the Ointment has
been equally efficacious with my children. Formerly there was no
getting them to go to bed, but I have now only to exhibit a packet of
your Ointment, and in a moment they are all up, and wishing me and
their Mamma good night. Publish this letter, it you think it will be
believed, and I remain,

"Mrs. Mephibosheth Barnes presents her compliments to the
Editor of the Spiritual Magazine, and begs to thank him for the great
utility of his Ointment. Her eldest son, a very promising lad of twelve
years old, and a pupil at the Buffington Proprietary School, was
devoting himself to his studies with an energy which, she, as a fond
mother feared would be prejudicial to his health. At length, alarmed at
his saying that he was determined to go in and win the Greek prize, she
procured some of the Spirit-Happing Ointment, and administered it to
Master Barnes. At first he revolted against it, but she having per-
severed in applying it under his eyes, he began to like it, and it has
entirely cured him of any over-zeal in his studies, as he now thinks of
nothing but the Ointment, and there is not the least chance of his
gaining the Greek or any other prize.

"Sir,—Permit a happy father to thank you with all the earnestness
of the paternal nature for having effected a singular cure in his house-
hold. I am the parent, Sir, of two charming daughters, aged respec-
tively 19 and 17, and they, being possessed of lively spirits, were a
Sreat trouble to me, who am a quiet widower. They were always
elighted at the idea of going to a ball, or an evening party of any
kind, and would frequently ask me to take them to one of the operas
or the theatre; or to invite young friends to see them at home. It
was a source of much disturbance to my evenings. By a lucky, or
i shall I say, a providential circumstance, your ointment came my know-
ledge. I resolved to administer it to my daughters, and they took to
it with the enthusiasm of their age. No more dances, operas, parties,
stage-plays for them now. They have become silent and thoughtful, and
neither will ever stir from the room without the other, especially after
dark. They are completely subdued, and I should hardly know
them again. Accept once more the thanks of a happy father, and
believe me
"Yours, obediently,

To show that he has no other object than the discovery of the
truth, and never seeks to "humbng" anybody, the Editor of the Spi-
ritual Magazine prints the following letter, although its contents do
not, at first sight present evidence of so favourable a result as in the
preceding cases. But truth is immortal, and can bear any casualties :—
v.
"Sir,—I should be much obliged by your advice under these cir-
cumstances. My husband was a clerk in the Bank of England, and a
very steady, economical, and affectionate man, who obeyed me in all
things except one. That, Sir, was the surreptitiously procuring and
constantly using your Spirit - Kipping Ointment. Several times have I
flung it out of window, and into the fire, but the determined victim
always possessed himself of more, and at last became so addicted to its
use that he neglected his business at the Bank, and ended by defying
the Governor and Company for rebuking htm, in consequence of which
he was turned out of his situation. He did not feel this much at first,
declaring that he was glad to be a martyr for Spiritualism, but he
gradually sank into a low way, and yesterday morning I was surprised
at seeing his two legs sticking out of the water-butt. Happily, the
day before had been washing day, so there was nothing in the butt but
mud, slime, and efts, and he escaped exceedingly dirty and with a lump
on his forehead the size of an orange, but the moral is the same, and 1
could wish that you would print with your Ointment directions as to
how much weak people ought to be allowed to take at a time. I have
him safe in bed now, and I think he is ashamed of himself, though the
maid says that he is constantly knocking his gruel-spoon against the
night-lamp, and asking whether there are any Spirits in the room.
"Yours, disconsolately,
"Judd Street, Oct. 22." "Margaret Snickle."

"Sir,—Precious indeed is your Ointment, and I only wish I had
known of it sooner. I had long discovered an incompatibility of temper
between myself and Mrs. Toddlekins, hut having no particular fault
with which to charge that person, I scarcely knew how to intimate
that I wished she would return to her friends. Happily, a friend
recommended your Ointment, and I have applied it with such success,
that Mrs. T., terrified out of her senses, took the initiative, and bolted,
and is giving out that I am a Dangerous Idiot. Female malice is
extraordinary, but I am your debtor for my happy release.

Catholic Cookery.
One of our contemporaries accuses Dr. Collen of "cooking the
accounts" of the battle of Spoleto. The phrase is not inaptly chosen;
but we fear if he continues his CuHenary courses, Dr. Cullen will in
time be mistaken for Dr. Kitchener. No doubt each member of his
Brigade—or shall we write it, brag-ade P—was a broth of a boy; but
this would hardly justify the Doctor in such an act of cookery as he
has been accused of.
THE LAND OF IRE.
The rabid invective which the Ultramontane Press of Ireland is
continually launching against England and Sardinia, confirms the con-
jecture that the word Erin is derived from Erinnys, which, some younp
ladies may require to be reminded, was the name of a Fury.

MILITARY COSTUME. TEMP. H-NRY THE SIXTH.
FROM A BEAUTIFUL BUJT WHICH IB NOT IN THE
TOWER AKMul'KV.
CHAPTER XXXIV.—THE TIME OF HENRY THE SIXTH.
>Unnilt fantastic as were
ther civil habits, the knight-
ly armour of this period we
learn was quite as fanciful.
One writer describes the
panoply of horsemen as
showing the "unbridled
caprices of the day;" but
we question if this phrase
may be accepted in its lite-
ralness, for we cannot think
that horsemen rode their
nngs unbridled, any more
than (with the exception
of at Astley's) t hey do now.
Surcoats and jupons went
somewhat out of fashion,
and it became "the thing"
to cover the breast-piece
and the placard with two
different coloured silks.
The placard, we should
note, was a plate, and not
a poster: as readers of the
bill-sticking persuasion
might imagine it. Breast-
fdates now consisted most-
y of two pieces, and the
lower one of these was
called properly the placard.
We find that back-plates
were occasionally worn
as well as breast - plates;
chiefly, we presume, by
knights who thought dis-
cretion was the better part
of Ynlour, and who were prone, when they were forced to fight, to
let their feelings run away with them. In lieu, however, sometimes
both of breast-pieces and back-plates, there was worn a kind of jacket
called a jazerant, or jazerine; a defence which was composed of little
overlapping iron plates, covered with rich velvet, and for men who
studied their personal appearance, fastened with gilt studs.
Aprons of chain mail still continued to be worn; but whether only
by Free Masons, we confess we cannot state. Over these are shown
in some of the old drawings plates called tuilcs, depending from the
front skirt of the body armour, and which it would appear were now
first introduced. Having so many plates about them, the knights must
certainly have found it difficult to cut away, and when trying to escape
one can t help thinking that the fat ones were occasionally dished. It
would thin the stoutest ranks to box them up in body-plates, and then
to start them at "the double;" aud however much their military
ardour might be cooled, there would be little need of plate-warmers fir
keeping up their vital heat.
That there were lightly armoured swells, as well as knightly
"heavies" is however clearly evidenced by Philip de Commines; who
tells us how the Dukes of Berri and Bretagnk "were at their ease
upon their hobbies" (which is more than can be said of some of our M.Ps.)
"armed only with gilt nails, sewn upon satin, that they might weigh
the less." This queer fashion of wearing gilt nails upon satin must
have given knights a rather coffiny appearance; and if there be any-
thing significant in names, one may fairly think that such a suit of
armour must have been exactly suited for the Duke si Berbi.
Another point to notice in the military equipment is that to the
bascinet, the helmet, and the old chapelde-fer (by the bye, we ought
to caution the weakminded of our readers that this ancient iron
"chapel" must in no way be confounded with the modern iron
rhurches, which we are now making for the settlers in Van Diemen's
Land and the natives of our mining districts, and of other heathen
parts)—to these old head-pieces we find was added now the "salade,"
to which we have alluded in our notice of the armour of the last pre-
ceding reign. The salade was a kind of bascinet or skull-cap, made to
fit the head, and to project behind it in the manner of a trough, so as
to keep both wet and weapons from dropping on the neck. We believe
it to have been of German introduction; for we own we put no cre-
dence in the story that the salade was originally introduced by Saladin.
We have spoken of a fur called "lettice" at this period, but whether
or no this lettice was in any way mixed up in the making of the salade,
we must leave the Antiquarian Society to judge.
A sort of steel cap called a casquetel was also used about this time,
and was furnished with oreillets, which were round or oval plates
covering the ears. A spike called a crenel, or by some writers a
charnel, was stuck atop of this new steel cap; and sometimes the
oreillets were themselves supplied with spikes, projecting from their
centres. One would fancy that this fashion must have found especial
favour with the school-boys of the period; for spiked oreillets must
have made the schoolmasters think twice before they dared to box the
ears of peccant pupils.
Whether or no horses were at this time more than usually tough
about the cuticle, we are unable with our present means of knowledge
to decide. But we find that spurs were made with terribly long shanks,
and the spikes of the rowels were of formidable dimensions. To give
them extra power, too, it seems that they were generally screwed into
steel shoes, an arrangement which the "screws," for w^n"> ■■
they were used, could hardly have approved of.

MILITARY SHOES AND SPURS OF TnE PERIOD. FOUND WHILST DIOOlNa
THE FOUNDATIONS FOR MM. PUNCH'S NEW COAL-CELLAR.
During the reign of the Sixth Hekrt the first token of an important
change in warfare, became visible and it clearly must not pass un-
noticed in our Book. According to the best authorities (including of
course ourselves) it was at this time that the hand-cannon or "gonne"
was introduced: a weapon which we ought to regard with no small
interest as being the first parent of our Mini6s and Enfields, and the
great great greatest grandmother of our exploded old Brown Bess.
Vastly different from the modern eight-or tcn-mile-killing rifle was its
first progenitor the hand-cannon or gonne. Such as they were, we
think the merits of the invention belong to the Italians, who seem first
to have been struck with the brilliant idea that small cannon might be
made as easily as large ones, and that if they were made portable, foot
soldiers could carry them. The first parent of our Mantons and our
Westley Itichardses was a simple iron tube (not unlike a little gas
pipe or a largish pea-shooter) made with trunnions at the sides and a
touchhole pierced atop. This was fixed in a piece of wood about a
couple of feet in length, which answered to the modern stock, and was
called the frame. It was soon found out, howeverrwhilc the touchhole
was atop that the priming got blown off before the match could be
applied; and so some genius or other made the touchhole at the side,
and put a small pan under it so as to hold the priming. It being then
as now a maxim to keep one's powder dr^, a cover for the pan was
added in due course, constructed with a pivot so as to turn off and on.
With these improvements it appears the gonne was used in England as
early as the year 1446; as the curious may learn by a purchase-roll so
dated, bearing reference to the Castle on Holy Island, Durham; a
document which readers of black letter may find interesting, but which
ordinary readers would not care to have us quote.
Of course we may surmise, without much fear of contradiction, that
the newly invented weapon was fit for other purposes than that of
human slaughter, and that sportsmen as well as soldiers in course ot
time made use of it. What sort of a figure was cut by cockney
shooters who went out a-birding with one of these new gonnes,' and
became almost gonne 'coons from the recoil of it. we leave to our own
artist with the help of his old manuscripts here clearly to depict.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CULLEN ON STRATEGY.
CCORDINO to Dr.
Cullen, in his
late requiem-ser-
mon, the Pore's
Irish Brigade got
conquered the
other day only
in consequence
of having been
caught at an un-
fair advantage by
the dirty "bands
of the excommu-
nicated Kino op
Sardinia," who
pitched into that
contingent of he-
roes at a time
when "it had no
reason to expect
such an attack."
Cullen knows
that it is a point
of honour with
great generals
never to take an
enemy by sur-
prise, but always
on the contrary,
to let him know of their approach a good while beforehand, so that whenever they
push forward a reconnoitring column, it is always preceded by drums and fifes,
or other military music, as in the case of Highland troops, when the bagpipes go
before the men, playing, for example, "The CumpbelU are Coming." Acting on
the same honourable principle, Marlborough, Frederick the Great, Napoleon,
and Wellington used all of them, in advancing ou an adversary in the day, to
send on outriders, in the capacity and costume of heralds, blowing trumpets, and
by night were accustomed to keep blue lights burning, and to send up sky-rockets
from time to time. Well aware of these facts, Cullen, very naturally invites all
generous minds to answer the following question:—

"Of what avail could military skill or undaunted courage be in
such a crisis, when the invading forces, acting like robbers or
assassins, had seized the strongest positions, and selected the
battle-ground most favourable to themselves; and, addiug perfidy
to overwhelming numbers, had commenced the struggle before they
gave any indication of their hostile intentions."
Of course regular troops, acting under judicious com-
manders, do not usually seize the strongest positions,
select the battle-ground most favourable to themselves,
and swoop down upon their antagonists when the latter
are uuprepared for them. No; as Dr. Cullen says, they
leave this low kind of strategy to robbers and assassins,
who, in order to carry out their murderous and predatory
designs, are well known to be in the habit of intrenching
themselves in fastnesses, securing a basis of operations,
and choosing their own field—that is to say, when they
mean to fignt and do not intend creeping up to their
victim and stabbing him in the back, or lying in wait for
him and shooting him from behind a hedge. This way of
committing murder is one which Dr. Cullen may have
heard of—though not perhaps in Ireland. But brave
soldiers, handled by magnanimous leaders, always punc-
tiliously take care to give the forces opposed to them due
intimation of their hostile intentions. A British general
officer, indeed, has always a Solicitor on his staff and usually
sends him on to serve a notice upon the opponent against
whom he meditates any military operation.
The most famous Captains, moreover, we know as well
as Cullen does, utterly ignore the detestable doctrine
that victory generally inclines to the strongest battalions.
Instead, therefore, of trying to crush a foe by numerical
superiority, they invariably, before giving battle, make a
practice of telling off men enougli on their own side, if
the stronger, to put it as nearly as possible on an equality
with the other. They handicap their troops in fact. By
resorting to this noble expedient, besides affording t heir
antagonists an ample warning, they add simplicity to a
doubtful match, instead of "addiug perfidy to overwhelm-
ing numbers." Of the baseness thus denounced by
Dr. Cullen in terms of the choicest Irish rhetoric,
Cialdini and the Sardinians will no doubt feel sufficiently
ashamed.
AN ALGERINE CRUSADER.
Wb must not believe all that we read, and therefore cannot vouch
for the authenticity of the following extract from a despatch signed
De Lamoricierb :—
"Do not write to me about any more of those gossips, or else request me to put
MacornU in a ttato of siege. We will arrest twenty-five persons, shoot ten of theoi,
and then it will be all over."
Somebody ought to be hanged; either the villain who forged the
sentence last foregoing, or the scoundrel that put his own name to it.
The design of quietly arresting twenty-five persons, and shooting ten
of them, is a fine idea for a soldier of the Cross. The Cross is now the
prize of valour, but the proper reward for its soldier who conceived
the idea of arresting and shooting people in cold blood, is the gallows.
Yet Lamoriciere is walking about, whereas, if he really was the
author of the disgraceful document which contains the infamous
passage above cited, he ought, as soon as he was captured, to have
died in his boots, with their soles at some distance from the ground.
A Sooted Absurdity.
What are the Commissioners of Lunacy about P Here is a Wild
Irishman driving his friends mad, and proving himself eminently fit for
a straitwaistcoat, by claiming General Garibaldi as a countryman
of his, in order, as we fancy, that he may let off a bad joke about it.
The General, he says, was born in Cork or Connemara, he is not certain
which; and, after his father, was christened Richard Murphy, a
name which he has now contracted to Dick Tator!
The Dog and his Dwelling.
A Lady, charitable to the canine species, has established a "Home
for Dogs" at Islington. Now a Home for Dogs may be a very
admirable Institution; but Islington is not by any means the best
{)lace for it. A more appropriate site for such an establishment would
lave been found at Kenilworth.
New Jewry.—Baron Rothschild is stated to be arranging for
the purchase of Palestine, with a view to the Restoration of the Jews.
Rents at Brighton are expected to go down two-thirds.
OUR FRIEND THE DOCTOR.
Dr. Cummiso has just delivered, at Manchester, a pleasant address,
which reminds Mr. Punch of Canning's lines:—
11 Half novel and half sormon, on it Sowed:
With pious zeal too 1 Manchesterians' glowed."
And in this address the Seraphic Doctor (why should he not inherit
the title P) did Mr. Punch the honour of adverting to a paragraph
published by the latter some weeks ago, at the time when it was
stated—and, as the Doctor allows, truthfully—that, though believing
that the world would end in 1867, Da. Cummiso had taken a lease of
a house for twenty-one years. Mr. Punch, upon that occasion, grace-
fully complimented the Doctor upon his common sense. In the
Manchester address, Dr. Cummino refers to Mr. Punch's courtesy,
but says:—
"The Celebrated Satirist did not state that the lease was terminable at the end
of 7,14, or 21 years."
The Celebrated Satirist did not state this, because he did not know
it. But now that he does know it, from the best authority, he hastens
to announce it throughout the world, and to renew his compliments to
Dr. Gumming upon his extreme wide-a-wake-ishness. If the world
does not come to an end in 1867, the Doctor cm renew his lease, and if
it does, the lease will come to an end by what never can be more exactly
defined than in legal language—the Effluxion of Time. All is serene,
Seraphic Doctor.
An Awkward Memorandum.
"The Irish Catholics give a sword to Lamomcibr&"
He wants a new blade, for the old one has flown,
So give him the sword, disregarding the scoff
Which hints that whenever he puts the steel on
He '11 remember his Paddies were prompt to steal off.
social zorissA.
Zopissa is announced as something which will prevent the least
decay in a stone. Our friend Pam is not surprised, for he possesses,
(and long may he possess) something which prevents the least decay
in an Old Brick.

Sing rest to the souls of the brave sons of Erin,

Their glorious exploits were unaqualled for darin',
But ah! now, the Irish Brigade is no more.
Repose they in pace, ever blest be their slumbers,
And hallowed the spot where their cowld remains lie!
They fell, overwhelmed by shuparior numbers,
They would not surrender, preferring to die.
They drove back their foemen with terrible slaughter,
But sank under wounds, and exhausted with toil,
And then their warm life-blood was poured out like water,
To such an extent that it purpled the soil.
They stood whilst the death-shot around them was flying,
As thick as the leaves of the storm-shaken tree;
At last they were all on the battle-field lying,
Six hundred—of whom there survived only three.
Och! Talk of Leonidas; talk of the Spartans!

On the knees of their breeches, the kilt (that's not tartans)
Fought on, till their wristbands hung out at the!

Are buried in honour, be-painted with gore.
Their spirits have now jined the Army of Martyrs,
And Fame will remimber their names ivermore.

IMPORTANT SPORTING NEWS.

At the late Meeting of the Jockey Club, though little business was
done, many very valuable suggestions were made, and among them was
one which it is hoped will forthwith be embodied in a rule of the Club,
and carried out. It is the custom, as every one is aware, to publish on
the eve of a race a list of the horses that have arrived to fulfil their
engagements. But it is thought that the main object of the betting
fraternity would be better served, were the list accompanied by
another, from which they would at once learn the names of those who
attend races for the purpose of supporting the said fraternity. It is
proposed, therefore, that in future the papers which publish the list of
arrivals " shall do so in this manner:—

The service in which they are likely to be most effectual,
is that of keeping offensive people aloof. One of them

OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
"My dear Punch,
"Among the various advantages of being in Town when the
cream and flower of fashion have departed, I reckon the comparative
ease with which one can find a Hansom cab, a vacant table at Simp-
son's, and a seat at the theatres. I don't mean to say that your
'bloated aristocrats' take up much more room than ordinary mortals,
or that the pit (which I chit-fly frequent) is their favourite haunt on
this tide the footlights. Still the season is the season, there's no
denying that, and when it comes, bustle and confusion as surely ensue
as that annual hecatomb of delicate kids, of which we are reminded in
our glover's bills.
"The other night, then, tempted by that admirable arrangement by
which one may make sure of finding a seat without bolting one's
dinner, and thus incurring the horrors of indigestion, I found myself
in the pit of the Adelphi. I prefer, as I have said, that part of the
house. I have heard many of my friends confess the same partiality,
and assign various reasons for so doing; as for instance, because it is
cooler, or warmer, or more respectable than the boxes; or because you
needn't 'dress' there, or because it is the best place to see, &c, &c.
Now besides all these there is another advantage, which these honest
folks seem to overlook,but which the following little sum of subtraction
will render evident:—
A box ticket costs say
A pit ditto ditto ditto
5s. Od.
2*. Od.
Leaving a clear balance in hand of 3*. Od.
That is the advantage I mean, and I can't think why people are so
obtuse as not to see it.
"Of course I went to see the Colleen Baton. I couldn't help myself.
Everyone was bothering me about it. 'Have you seen the Colleen?'
says one. 'What d'ye think of the Baton?' inquired another,
(between ourselves I've not the wildest notion what, either of these
words mean; but that's not to the point). 1 determined to go, and
you may picture me seated with a bi-foliated playbill in my hand, and
listening to the last bars of the overture.
"Ehett, Poslhume I it must be some eight years ago since I, fresh from
the classic shades of Eastminster, sat before another drop-scene when
a certain young lady played Kadiga in the Alhambra, and sang a
facetious duet with poor old Harley. By Jove! how I envied that
venerable comedian as he piped out—
"My dear Kadiga, one fine day," &o.
I would have cheerfully resigned my last new bat and stumps of the
most approved pattern, and with all the latest improvements, to have
changed places with him. I am afraid I took advantage of my parents'
absence from town to repair to .the Princess's on five consecutive
nights, and should have been present on the sixth but for a severe cold
which I caught while absurdly waiting about to see Some One drive
away in a cab. There was one bouquet tied up with silver cord which
she must have noticed. A h! vive la Jeunesse! Live the youth, indeed!
I thought I could have died for—but however, I didn't. You see I
was but seventeen at the time: young gentlemen at that period of life
frequently survive their disappointments—(no less than eleven and a
half have fallen to my lot), but I confess I was rather in a flutter when
the curtain rose upon the Colleen Baton. You know the plot, I dare
say, but as some of your 500,000 readers may not, I will just sketch
the outline.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[Novembeh 3, 1SG0.
j and the action takes place (including the subaqueous business) in and
about the Lake of Kularney.
"There is a certain Mrs. Cregan (of Tore Cregan) with an only
; son, Hardress, who owing to the reverses of Fortune, has become
involved in considerable pecuniary difficulties from which Bhe is natu-
rally auxious to escape. Her chief creditor is a very objectionable old
person by the name of Corrigan, who takes advantage of her embar-
rassment to appear before her in the light of a suitor, and holds certain
mortgages in terrorem by way of inducing her to become his wife.
Being a very high spirited young widow (and having perhaps some
other swain in view), she is naturally very indignant at the suggestion,
and spurns his offer in her son's presence, who taking up his Mamma's
cause very warmly, brings his boots to bear upon the question, and, in
short, kicks Mr. Corrigan out of the house. That old gentleman goes
away vowing vengeance, and immediate ruin seems the inevitable con-
sequence; but Mrs. C, who, like a true woman, has had another string
to ber bow all the while, proposes to her son that he should espouse a
wealthy heiress, Miss Chute, who is supposed to be possessed of a
large landed estate with a comfortable little property in the funds
besides. There is, however, a slight obstacle to this arrangement
which is no less than the fact that Mr. Cregan has already taken to
himself a wife in the person of a peasant girl, Eily O'Connor (the
Colleen Baton). Without being aware that matters have gone thus far,
Mrs. Cregan on her son's declining to marry Miss Chute off hand, begins
to suspect that the Bawn has something to do with it, and I leave
you to judge what her feelings are towards that unfortunate young
person.
"Now Miss Chute is an uncommonly nice girl, but it so happens that
she has already fixed her affections on a Mr. Eyrie Daly, and therefore
would not be in a position to listen to Mr. Cregan's addresses (if he
were in a position to pay them), but for an accident which tends rather
to lessen her regard for her original lover. To explain this I must
introduce you to another individual who plays an important part in the
1 plot. This is a poor cripple called the Danny Man—a sort of retainer
on the Cregan estate, and devotedly attached to young Uardress for
the thoroughly Hibernian reason, that that gentleman had pitched
him over a precipice in early life, of which his deformity is the
consequence.
"Seeing the difficult position in which his master is plaoed, and
thinking it a pity that such a fine young squire should be thrown away
I upon a cottage girl, the Danny Man sets his wits to work in order to
prevent such a catastrophe. He begins by leading Miss Chute (by a
I tremendous bouncer) to believe that it is her lover Mr. Daly who is
paying attentions to the Bawn, and thus estranges her from that gen-
tleman. He then eggs on Hardress (who is uneasy at the prospect of
; insolvency) to try and wheedle his wife out of her marriage certificate,
I representing to her, by way of inducement, what a nice comfortable
arrangement it would be for all parties if she would kindly make her-
self scarce in order that her husband might contract a second, and more
advantageous marriage without incurring any disagreeable imputations
i of bigamy.
"Fortunately just at this juncture, and while the poor thing is still
hesitating, an old lover of Eily O'Connor turns up—a saucy dram-
drinking bright-eyed good-hearted son of Erin, who by putting matters
in their true light, brings her to her senses, and a jolly old priest, Father
lorn, who is attached to the family in general and to the whiskey bottle
in particular, makes her take a tremendous oath that she will never part
with the certificate as long as she lives. Mr. Cregan goes off in a rage
and the curtain falls on the First Act.
"In the next we find the Danny Man (whose moral obliquity is only
equalled by his crooked aspect) suggesting to Hardress, that if he
should desire any stronger measures used, he need but send him his
glove, and may leave all the rest (i.e., assassination of the Bawn) to
! him (D M.). Mr. Cregan naturally resents this proposal as not only
too horrible to contemplate, but also as extremely impertinent, and the
I Danny Man is in imminent danger of being throttled for his pains.
This, however (after the Irish fashion), only increases his devotion, and
under this influence, he unfortunately meets Mrs. Cregan, who is
struggling between pride and love and duty, and making a proper
tragic jumble of the three. Thinking it would be a capital thing to
get rid of the Bawn, that lady, without inquiring into particulars,
brings him the glove as from her son, and with a little show of con-
science, the Danny Man sets off on his errand. To cut matters short,
the poor Baton is easily persuaded to accompany him—and he decoys
her in a boat to the Water Cave, where in a most heartless manner he
pushes her into'the briny.' Of course, immediately afterwards he is
stung by remorse, and it is perhaps owing to the awful effects of this
passion on his personal appearance that he is mistaken for an otter and
shot then and there by Myles na Coppaleen, who has come down to the
Water Cave on a little private business in the distilling line. Fishing
about in the water for his otter, what should he come upon but the
cloak of his old sweetheart, and her own dear self at the end of it!
That is quite enough for him—before you can say Jack Robinson, in
he goes (a regular header, only there is no splash), and after about a
minute of intense anxiety, is seen making his way through the water,
and at last bearing Eily O'Connor to the rock whence she was thrown.
Then the Curtain very properly descends again.
"The Third Act, I confess, I do not clearly understand. The Bawn
is rescued, that is certain, and the Danny Man scrambles to shore
somehow, m time to make his confession before paying the just penalty
for his wickedness. This confession is partly dotted down by Mr.
Corrigan, who conceals himself with that object, but it is reserved for
Mrs. Oregon to explain before the parochial authorities that she is the
one who has been most to blame in the matter. By this explanation,
singularly enough, she manages to remove all suspicion of guilt from
Ilardress without incurring any herself. The heiress also sees how
affairs stand, and bestows her hand upon the faithfully. The Bawn.
is restored to the arms of her husband, and forgives him like a good
fond foolish wife as she is. But to descend from matrimony to money
matters, how do the Cregans get over their difficulties? Does good Mitt
Chute come to the rescue, as I believe she expressed a wish to do in
the early part of the play f or does Mr. Corrigan forfeit his claims, or
do Hardress and the Bawn live happily on nothing a year ever after-
wards? Rapt into a phase of melodramatic excitement, I forgot to
cross-examine the Muse on these points, which after all, are not of
much importance. I enjoyed my evening very much, as I believe most
of the spectators did, if we may put any faith in bravos and brass
ferrules. To my mind, one looks on at a play with additional interest
when the author is included in the role, and whatever may be the
opinion of the learned regarding Mr. Boucicault as a dramatist, there
can be little doubt of his merit 'on the boards.' I can hardly imagine
a better Stage Irishman, and if you have seen the 'Colleen Bawn' I
make no doubt you will agree so far with
"Tour humble servant,

THE CAUSE OF THE ROMISH CRUSADERS.

THERE was a time not far away,
1 When Cullen's Church the wisest schooled;
Kings governed with unbridled sway;
And priests the ruler's conscience ruled.
How high attained the human mind P
A holy Mother formed it then;
She had the teaching of mankind,
And should have made them noble men.
Ah! then the world, for some brief space,
Beheld the reign of truth and good.
And, lessoned by supernal grace,
Man's dues and duties understood;
But rarely then were subjects moved
Against their monarchs to rebel:
For Princes in their conduct proved
The right divine to govern well.
Yes, then hard hearts were taught to feel;
Then scourges tore the scorner*s back:
Then bones were crushed upon the wheel,
And sinews snapped upon the rack.
The tongue that uttered words of sin
Was then torn out by zealous ire,
And misbelievers' living skin
Hissed, shrunk, and crackled in the fire.
Alas! offenders now atone
Their crimes by torment scarcely more;
Subverted is the Bourbon's Throne,
That did some wretches force to roar.
The groan, the shriek, the scream, the wail,
From cell and scaffold cease to rise;
No roasting heretics exhale
Unwilling incense to the skies.
Ages of Faith, will you revive,
And miscreants shall we yet behold,
Whipped, mangled, maimed, and burnt alive,
As in the pious days of old?
Or have the wise, the good, and brave,
Been fighting, with devotion fired,
In vain, that Dynasty to save
Which those delightful times inspired?
A NEW OPENING.
Tite way in which our streets are torn up at the present moment
affords an admirable opening for street conjurors and posture-mongers,
of which our al fresco professors liberally avail themselves. As the
thoroughfares are impassable for vehicles, they have the street all to
themselves, and they can carry on their gymnastics without the slightest
interruption. When half-a-dozen Risleys have built themselves into a
living pyramid almost as tall as a Manchester warehouse, 'they can-
not pick themselves quickly to pieces, a Bounding Brick of Babylon
at a time, as often as a Pickjord s van is seen in the distance gallop-
ing, with the speed of a fire-engine, towards them. The consequence
is, that the wearers of pink fleshings have been doing a rare sweeping
business lately, which is likely to continue until such time as our
Paving Commissioners and Qas Companies force them to shut up
shop, by closing the chasms that are such profitable mines of
wealth to all followers of the haute gymnastique. The only drawback
is, the fear that occasionally possesses the aspiring gentleman who
acts the apex of la Perche, of falling some thirty or forty feet to the
bottom of a most uninviting sewer, that he sees yawning beneath
him.
It is not at all pleasant to think that the smallest hesitation, the most
trifling deviation from the right line of conduct, on the part of his
confrere who is performing the part of base below, might cause him
at any moment to play the involuntary character of AliSRCus Curtius.
The apprehension takes away materially from the pleasure that ambition
has generally in reaching the summit of its wishes; nor can the poor
posturer, who, poised in the air, is girouetting, like a corporeal weather-
cock, in front of the attic windows, be buoyed up much with the con-
soling conviction that, supposing he were to leap into the gulf, his
country would gain anything by it, or even be grateful for the sacrifice.
We doubt if the sewers would close any the quicker. Another draw-
back is, that these exciting performances distract the attention of the
workmen a great deal too much. The bold navvy leans upon his pick-
axe, and stares his eyes out with admiration, quite unconscious of
the rolling hours. We cannot blame him, for human nature loves play
better than work; but still wo see clearly that, unless these moving
distractions arc made to move off altogether, our streets give every
promise of being, like the Haymarket Theatre, open all the year
round.
Is there no Early-Closing Association that can look into the matter,
and get these million-andone cruel incisions into the bowels of the
earth to close a little earlier. If they would close at two o'clock on
the Saturdays only, still it would be a great boon, and would go a long
way to make matters a little smoother. Rent-day, we believe, comes
in the country not more than four times a-year, and in Ireland, some-
times, it never comes at all; but in London it is rent-day every day
throughout the year, and so sadly is every thoroughfare distrained upon
in consequence of these numerous rents, that we have scarcely a stick
or a stone that we can call our own.
Couldn't the Paving and Lighting Commissioners come to some
arrangement to open only one or two, and not all the streets, at the
same time F Or are the present regulations intended as a punishment
upon all those pitiable parties who are compelled, less from choice than
necessity, to stop in town P It may probably be our own fault. It
serves us right, if we do inhale gases and other perfumes unregistered
by Delcroix, and other perfumers who take the nose of the public in
hand. By rights, we should be at Brighton, or Leamington, or Scar-
borough—anywhere but in this unpleasant London.
In the interim, if there is any inquiring foreigner who is anxious to
see anything of the interior life of London, now then, we say, is his
time. He will find a capital opening for pursuing his researches,
ready-made for him, in Piccadilly, the Strand, or Regent Street, or
any main thoroughfare (so called, because the main is always being
pulled up) where the traffic is greatest.
THE MOST DELICATE COURTESY OF ALL.
Ik graceful acknowledgment of the Duke of Newcastle's having
brought H. R. H. to America, the Republicans have nearly made up
their minds to choose as President—A Lincoln.
A PARALLEL—SLIGHTLY COLOURED.
If China suffers under its Tae-pings, England has almost as gieat u
nuisance La its Red Ta-pings.

THE TRIO AT WARSAW.
When Victor first began to reign
Without the Tyrants' leaves,
He much alarmed three mighty men;
And two of them were thieves:
The first he was a Russian;
The next he was a Prussian;
And the third he was a little Kai-ser:
Three Despots altogether.
The Russian chafed with scorn;
The Prussian spun a yarn;
And the little Kai-ser waxed red with wrath,
And all three Sovereigns warm.
The Russian was choked with self-will;
The Prussian made swallow his yarn;
And the Rebels did away with the little Kai-ser,
With his Charter under his arm.
EXCITING RA.CE.
Last week there was a most exciting race in the Strand between a
fire-engine and a Pickford's van. The former had the start, but was
soon caught up to by the latter. The pace for about ten minutes was
terrific, we might almost say, killing—but ultimately the Pickford's
van won by a good couple of streets. Only five children and two old
women were thrown over, fifteen apple-stalls upset, one costermonger's
donkey seriously injured and not expected to survive, besides an old
gentleman and a commissionaire, who were carried to the hospital,
and lie in a very precarious state. The winner was taken to the station
house, and weighed in the scales of justice, whereupon some little
irregularity being detected, he was detained. This irregularity simply
arose from the fact of his being considerably overweighted with liquor.
THE PENNY WEDDING.
We are happy to state that a marriage which has been for a con-
siderable time on the sawdust has at length taken place. On Monday,
the 22nd ult. was solemnised in the Chapel, Fetter Lane, the union of
Morning Star, Esq., adopted child of John Bright, Esq, of Bir-
mingham, M.P., with Miss Dial, surviving child of A. Great Mistake,
Elect Street. The bride had long been in a delicate state of health,
owing to her having been unfortunately submitted to empirical treat-
ment, and at one time had scarcely been expected to linger through
another week, but it is hoped that the happy alliance now made will give
her a new lease of life. Her husband, though not very well educated,
and though at times inclined to be coarse, has a manly English character,
and Miss Dial, though brought up as a rigid Dissenter, haa already
seen the folly of fanat icism, and has accompanied her new lord to most
of the theatres, to Newmarket races, and other scenes of which she
was lately in the habit of speaking with the shyness of ignorance. We
take much interest in the fortunes of the wedded pair, and trust that
they will be blest with a large issue.
A Table of Contents.
A Table that answers to every rap of the Spiritualist, and answers
precisely as the Spiritualist wishes it,—or a table that moves according
to the desires of the fools that are circled round it, and is as easily
moved as a cook with a novel in penny numbers,—or, better still, a
table whose legs will begin cutting capers, and then flies off into the
Post-Horn Galop round the room, and winds up by dancing the College
Hornpipe on the ceiling,—such a table is indeed a Table of Contents.
A Table of Discontents is one. we suppose, that will not yield to any
amount of pressure—that would not allow itself to be carried away
even by a broker.

THE DRAG Off THE TREASURY COACH.
The Treasury Coach is a ticklish machine
To tool without perilous joltinfr,
To shave kerb-stones keen, and to turn corners clean,
And keep leaders and wheelers from bolting;
And the Jehus who drive, should be keenly alive,
To the rule, which the best for their tribe is,
Who would scape purls and pitches in kennels and ditches—
"In medio tutissimus ibis.
John Bull has good pluck, and firm faith in his luck,
And likes a bold rate of progression;
It's hard to make him shy, bnt that son of Minshi
Bill Gladstone did that all last session,
lie went off at a pace to try linch pin and trace,
Galloped up-hill and down—helter-skelter-
Spite of warnings and shouts, from both insides and outs,
Bad roads, and a weight more than welter.
As for nursing a nag, or attaching the drag,
Or heeding " wo-hoas" from his warners.
Or heavings and pitches, or kerb-stones and ditches,
Screaming pikemen, snort turns, or sharp Corners—
To such cautions a stranger, a scoffer at danger,
He swore he would show each old fogy,
He was not to be schooled how the coach should be tooled,
In defiance of tugbear or bogey.
The Treasury trap, by a merciful hap,
Through its stages he ended by getting,
Though the wonder was vast, that he didn't at last
Succeed the old coach in upsetting.
And when John Bull jumped down, at the sign of the Crown,
—Amazed ho had not had a tumble—
S.iys he, "Next time you drive, sure as 1 am alive,
1 '11 send a safe guard in the rumble.
"Latbo's all very well, o'er the way-bills to spell,
To look after the parcels and so on.
But he's not the rigut stuff—not half cautious enough—
A coach tooled by Gladstone to go on—
With a chap at the ribbons, who doesn't care fippencc
For his own neck, or passengers' either,
There's need of a man, who '11 do all caution can,
By help of the drag, to risk neither.
"If Bill must be endured," John told Pam his old steward,
"You look out 'mong the chaps in my service,
For one you can answer is not a Draw-can-sir,
But rather inclined to the nervous—
And just hint on the quiet, if Gladstone runs riot,
lie isn't obliged to obey him—
The more spokes in his wheel he can put I shall feel
The better he earns what I pay him."
Says old Pam. with a wink, "well, I really think,
I've a lad that just meets your directions;
He's as cool as a fish, with a natural wish
To make, if he can't find, objections.
He's staid, and he's solemn, talks shop by the column,
Spins red-tape by the yard, on occasion:
I don't want to brag, but if he spares the drag,
Say I can't twig a fellow's vocation.
"Fred Peel is his name, at hard work lie is game,
He don't care in whose teeth he runs rusty;
And Gladstone will find, if to ride rough inclined,
Fred quite as inclined to cut crusty—
So jump up—you Fred .... see Bill don't get his head,
Though he try all he knows of soft sawder;
To the drag have an eye, and remember, my boy,
You're put there to keep William in order."
Another such Victory, and they are Done For!
The Minister of War of the Kino op Naples, in his report on the
Battle of Volturno, claims it as a victory. The Neapolitan troops may
henceforth pride themselves on having one characteristic trait in com-
mon with the English, for it is very clear "they do not know when
they 're beaten." However, there the resemblance begins and ends.
Berlin Worsted—What Berlin certainly will be, if ever she is
foolish enough to have a quarrel with London.
A PEOSPECT FOR POISON-MONGERS.
{View of the MM.)
We are very much obliged to the Recorder of HuL, and author of
Postages from the Diary of a late Physician, Samuel Warren, Esq.,
Q.C., for having, in his address to the Grand Jury, at the late Quarter
Sessions, delivered a valuable summary of the last session of Parlia-
ment's legislation. Herein he specified one particular statute, contain-
ing a provision calculated to have a most beneficial effect, if it is but
duly and fully enforced. This Act is c. 8, which provides by section 1,
for the punishment, with a long term of penal servitude or imprison-
ment, of "any person unlawfully and 'maliciously administering, or
causing to be administered to, or taken by, any other person, any
poison or other destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby to endanger
life or inflict any grievous bodily harm;" a crime which it constitutes
felony. Having stated thus much, Mr. Wajlren proceeded to inform
his audience, concerning this same wholesome act for .the discourage-
ment of attempting to poison, that—
■ By the second section, the doing so with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy any
person, is declared a misdemeanour, punishable with or without hard labour for
any period not exceeding three years. By the third and last section, if a jury bo
not satisfied as to the prisoner being guilty of felony under section let, on an indict-
in cn t charging it, thoy may find him guilty of the misdemeanour under section 2,
if satisfied that he is guilty of it."
Now, then, deleterious lollipop-vendors, grocers who sell coloured
tea, and all the rest of you dealers in adulterated food, look out. If
you serve your customers with poisoned articles you will be clearly
liable to an indictment for felony, and even if that cannot be sustained,
it will be for the jury to consider whether, in selling people pernicious
eatables and drinkables for the purpose of cheating them, you are not
"unlawfully and maliciously administering or causing to be adminis-
tered" that which may rightly be described as poison or other
noxious or destructive thing, with intent to injure, aggrieve, or annoy"
those whom you defraud. Prepare your goods for the market, there-
fore, with the fear of the treadmill and the crank before your eyes.
You publicans also, mind what beer you sell, and be careful how you
purvey public-house port. Take heed lest you let yourselves in for
three years. The same caution should be observed oy all those who
pretend to give wine to others, and give something else, or give bad
wine; a cruelty and a wrong which is sometimes committed by other
hosts than landlords, and wliich richly merits imprisonment with hard
labour.
WELLINGTON VOLUNTEERS.
At the instance of the Early Closing Association, the principal boot-
makers in the Edgware Road and the western part of Oxford Street
have agreed to shut up shop every evening, except Saturdays, at eight
o'clock. It is to be hoped that this step will prove to have been the
commencement of a general Bootmakers' Early Closing Movement.
Amongst the various persons employed in the boot-trade, it is obvious
that the Boot Closers are at least as much interested as any in the
promotion of early closing, for which purpose they should redouble
their endeavours to close every boot confided to their hands as early
as possible. It is a pity that the bootmakers cannot participate in the
benefit of the Saturday half-holiday, which it may be thought that they
might enjoy if workpeople in general had their wages paid them on
Fridays; but the demand for new boots and shoes on the part of the
industrious classes, inseparable from the eve of Sunday, will probably
forbid the proprietors of Golden Boots and Noah's Arks, if not the
Makers to the Queen and the Aristocracy, to put up their shutters
much before twelve o'clock on Saturday night. Otherwise, the libe-
rated bootmakers' shopmen might go and contribute to the Saturday
Review, or at least assist at the drill, of Rifle Volunteers, which
generally takes place in Hyde Park, "or some other suitable place" on
Saturday.
Having served their customers, they would then learn how to serve
their country, if their country should ever require their services; but
let us hope it never will. It is!often jocosely said, that there is nothing
like leather; but a bootmakers' brigade would doubtless prove that
remark to be one of the many true things which are said in joke, by
the "leathering" which they would administer to their adversaries.
The sons of Crispin are generally celebrated for combativeness, and
no class of young men would be more prompt than the bootmakers to
aid in repelling any enemy who might come here in quest of booty.
No doubt many of them will avail themselves even of the limited
leisure, which is all the time they can at present command, to learn
the use of arms; and, with a view to their encouragement in the study
of this useful art, let us, the next opportunity we have of proposing a
toast and sentiment, drink "Success to the Bootmakers' Early Closing;
and no Heeltaps."

CHAPTER XXXV.—A FIRST LOOK AT THE LADIES OF THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY.
ucrr as it may pain us to
reflect upon the fact, truth
obliges us to slate that in
the reigns of Henry tue
Fourth, Henhy tue Fifth,
and Henry the Sixth,
(which, as every baby knows,
embraced the interesting
period between the first day
of October in 1399, and the
fifth day of March in 1461,)
the ladies certainly com-
mitted many an offence
against good taste in their
costume, and their head-
dresseswere perhaps the head
and front of their offending.
So gigantic were the struc-
tures they erected on their
beads that doorways, we are
told, had to be altered to
admit them.* Indeed such
was their absurdity, that
one of the most courteous
of writers on costume is
constrained to say the head-
dresses of these three Hen-
rys' reigns were "certainly
as ugly and unbecoming as
can well be imagined;" and
when one looks at the strange
specimen with which we
head this chapter, one must

thing in bonnets of the period." to oe great cause lor tins
complaint.
In general, variety is reputed to be charming; but this can hardly
be asserted of the coiffures which were fashionable during the fifteenth
century. There was abundance of variety, but very little that was
charming in the monstrosities that ladies took it into their heads to
wear upon them. In the reign of Henry the Fourth the fashion
was to nave the hair still gathered in a caul; but this, instead of being
fastened closely round the head, was projected at the sides, and
flattened at the top, so that ladies looked as though they carried
baskets on their heads, and made their back hair serve by way of
porter's knot. In the following two reigns flat crowns went out of
fashion, and it became "the thing " to wear large high and heartshaped
head-dresses, which sometimes were exchanged for a more pointed
style of coiffure, that gave its wearer the appearance of having grown
a pair of horns. Turbans of oriental form were also worn occasionally,
and now and then a roll of cloth or silk was wrapped or folded round
the head, and all t he hair was combed straight through it in the manner
of a scalp-lock, and thence dangled down the back.
The horned head-dress was, however, the one that was most fashion-
able, perhaps because it clearly looked the most ridiculous. What the
horns were made of we cannot state precisely, for the mysteries of the
toilette are not to be revealed by a modest and male pen. It is enough
for us to hint that they projected from the ladies like the crested
honours of the brute creation," as one of the most elegant of writers
has expressed it: and that sometimes from their tips behind, there
was suspended a short veil, which served to give a sort of background
to the face. Whether ladies ever played at "Buck, buck!" with each
other, and asked how many horns they held up on their heads, is a
question of so little value to our work, that we care not to decide it by
so much as a toss up. It puzzles us, however, to guess what other
good there could have been in wearing them, and we thoroughly
endorse the opinion of Will Cox, the learned Finsbury historian, that
the horns were not more useful than they were hornamental.
Of course the Punches of the period poked their fun unmercifully at
these preposterous head-coverings: but it must be owned their jokes
are somewhat of the mildest, with the addition too of being mostly far
too coarse to quote. As a specimen we may mention, that the ladies
who wore horns were declared to "carry about with them the outward
and visible sign of the father of all evil," and were compared to cows,
* Isabella of Bavaria, Queen of Charles the Sixth of Franco, is represented
by Montfaucon aa wearing "a heart-shaped head-dress of exceeding size, and some
doe say tbat Bbee did carry ye fashion to sucbe a beigbt tbat at Vinceunes y* palace
doors were obliged to be enlarged, for else btr Majjeety and eke y* ladies of her

to harts, to unicorns, and snails, and to all sorts of horned creatures,
perhaps including horned owls. One old writer gives his lips a miso-
gynic smack, as he relates how to a feast there did come a gentle-
woman, having her head so strangely stuck about with pins, that the
company full soon did scorn her from their presence, saying she did
bear a gallows on her skull. Moreover, poetry was launched as well
as prose at these queer head-dresses. Lydgate, the monk of Bury,
who, we are told, was "the most celebrated poet of the day," produced
a laughter-moving ballad called "A Ditty of Women's Horns," whereof
the gist and burden is the strangely sage reflection, tbat pretty women
have no need of horns to make them pretty. As a sample of the sort
of stuff which the "most celebrated poet" of the period could perpe-
trate, we beg to introduce the following mirthful stanza to the notice
of the curious:—
"Clerkes record, by great authority,
Horna were given to beastea for defenco
A thing contrary to feruiuity,
To be made sturdy of resistence.
But arch wives, eager in their violence,
Fierce as tigers for to make affray.
They have despito, and act against conscience.
List not to prido their boms cast away."
One can't help having a doubt of the "wisdom of our ancestors,"
when one reflects that they could write—and actually read—such stupid
stuff as this. What
would become of
Punch (who is clearly
"the most celebrated
poet of the day,") if,
instead of all the
golden lines he week-
ly issues from his
mental mint, he were
to palm upon the
public such a pitiful
ditty, full of bad
jokes and worse
grammar as this old
Monk's of Bury,
whose poetry by
rights should have
been buried with his
bones P
Of course it was
not likely that ladies
should be found to
be more sensible in
other parts of their
costume, when they
were so foolish
about that which
they wore nearest to
their brains. Ex-
travagance and su-
perfluity were their
prevailing faults in
dress; and they had
seemingly no notion of the " elegant simplicity " which has so eminently
distinguished the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, with whom some
of their descendants may perhaps be well acquainted. Gowns, we find,
were worn extremely wide and full, and with enormously long trains,
so that their wearers must have found it cruel crural work to walk in
them. Street-sweepers (if there were any—will Mr. Timbs enlighten
us ?) might have, with some reason, approved of these appendages, but
as they must have been continually tripping people up, we think that
no one else about the streets could have thought well of them.
It may be interesting to some cf our fair readers to learn, that ex-
ceedingly short waists were in fashion at this period; and that it was
thought nice to have them small as well as short may be inferred from
an old love-song we have recently unearthed, and which in the senti-
mental language of the time commences thus :—
"fHjj JLobe sfjre ftattj a rc6, rcS nose,
mponne a torjite, incite fact:
ge reason is, stoe mm suppose,
Srjee ootli too tigrjtlie lace."
Without bothering the reader (to say nothing of ourselves) with any
further details and particular descriptions, which we find (in other
writers) are particularly sleepifying, we beg to call upon our artist to
finish off this Chapter for us by giving a true copy of a curious old
drawing, which will amply serve to illustrate the ample bed-gowns of
the period, and the formidable structures which now served by way of
night-caps. The drawing, which is in the famous Whitefriars collec-
tion, will be looked upon as one of great domestic interest, aa it repre-
sents Queen Margaret, the wife of our Sixth Henry, in the noble act
of carrying her husband up to bed. Such of our readers aa have read the

History of England are of course aware that Margaret was a strong-
minded woman; and this old drawing shows her to have been strong-
bodied also. When we "look upon this picture" we seem to see quite
clearly why Henry was afraid of her, and instead of speaking of her as

his better half, used generally to call her his superior three-quarters.
History says that Henry was, during his last days, as mad as a March
hare, or as cracked as poor Big Ben, (the reader may select which simile
he pleases,) and used to play at cup-and-ball with the royal orb and
sceptre, while he amused himself with singing in a terribly cracked
voice this extremely touching strain:—
"©lj no, nrag ntfatr mention it,
i'icto isn't it too ban!
jFaur frogs upon mg forcljeafl git,—
But no, E am not fflao!"
A LUCID EXPLANATION.
Clumsiness is certainly the failing of the Spiritualists. _ Conjurors
they may be, but clever they are not. As a specimen of their stupidity,
take the following explosion of one of their great guns, who has been
firing away at Punch and all other non-dupables in a Yankee print:—
• brcatnoss among men is oloae a property of the sensuous world: it does not
belong to the world of spirits. Greatness of mind belong* to the philosophies of the
mirth, whicii philosophies, like the earth, are material, and are subject to the samo laws.
No groatness among men goes beyond the boundaries of the love of earth. The right
that we have to claim that tho spirits of Washinoton, Fenelon, Shakspeark, and
Napoleon are a whit greiter than the spirits of their washorwomon and scavengers
Is only warranted by the standard of niaterl tl philosophy, which to tho soul is as a
action—is as a shadow of matter."
Here, then, is the explanation, for whichjwe long have panted.
Here, then, is the reason why the spirits of the Great when summoned
by our tables say what is little worth the trouble we are at to call
them forth. The spirit of Solon drivels, and that of Dr. Johnson
cannot even spell, because wisdom and good language are material
possessions; and not being in the flesh, spirits therefore cannot own
them. Of course, this very luminous and lucid explanation will amply
serve to satisfy minds capable of crediting what Spiritualists state.
But when Siiakspearb spoke of calling spirits from the vasty deep, he
surely never dreamed that such vastly shallow reasoning could, in
after time, be coupled with them.
A Stitch in Time.
It appears that the only way to disable such a vessel as La Gloire is
(hat of contriving to foul her screw. The next invention in naval
warfare will be a Screw Fouler. Will the Admiralty get this want
supplied, or leave the French Marine to make another discovery
involving one more "reconstruction of the Navy."
THE IRISH ARMY OF MARTYRS.
Oh! weep for the hour, when the bullets in a shower
On Erin's brave Brigadesmen at Ancona came;
Like heroes they did fight
For Pio Nono's right,
And gilded with new glory Ould Ireland's glorious name.
The odds was one to ten; but what's that to Irishmen,
Who for foightin' 'tis well known, by constitution are inclined,
With their Clargy in their front.
To uphold them 'ginst the brunt.
The Holy Pope and Cardinals to push them on behind.
On the haythen foemen pour, thirty thousand, if not more,
Agin' the brave three hundred that scorn a foot to yield,
Though a hundred guns rained shot
Almost, if not quite, red-hot,
And the gallant blood of Ireland ran like wather o'er the field.
All in the crimson flood, up to the knees they stood,
And they scorned to ask for quarther, tho' the gore it rose and rose,
From their knees up their breasts,
O'er l he shorter warriors' crests,
And took great O'Reilly's self—bein' tall—up to the nose.
For hours and hours they fought, and a miracle was wrought—
As, if miracles is ever wrought, why wouldn't it for them
That in Holy Church's cause,
Defyiu' Saxon laws.
Enlists, the excommunicate Sardinian foe to stem?
For all the blood that flowed; to the depth that I have showed,
The thousands of the inimy, the hundthreds of big guns,
Every man came out alive,
And the wounded was but five,
And three of them, the Saints be praised, was only sprains and stuns.
There was gallant Peter Murphy, laid low upon the turf he
Defended with such sperrit. wid 'a scorch on hands and face,
It's himself that has smelt powdther,
And no man can brag loudther.
And good raison—wid his whiskers burn't off upon the place.
And there's valiant Daniel Savage, that the inimy did ravage,
Wid a slight flesh-wound above the knee, that he would niver bend,
To ask the foe for quarther,
If he was made a marthyr—
To the faithful for a pinsion the man I recommend.
And there's glorious Peter Nevin, after killin' six or sevin,
(Not to spake of those he wounded, which was more by a great deal)
In hurts, as deeds, he still is
Like Homer's great Achilles,
For the blow that laid him low is a contusion in the heel.
Then there's Murphy number two, if a mortial could outdo,
The Murphy number one, whose wounds above I've let you know;
Tom Murphy is the boy,
Whereby he does enjoy,
A splinther in his flauk—he marched side-front against the foe.
And lastly Christian prayers I beg, for James O'Beirne his leg,
That afther his surrendther was cut off below the knee—
The only Irish limb—
1 '11 say that much for Jim—
That fell before the bullets of the cruel Minnie".
Sure the Protestants makes strictures on all the bleedin' picthurs,
And miraculous Madonnas that winks their holy eyes,
And the haythens, I '11 go bail,
Will ridicule the tale
Of the blood that from the wounds I've sung, did wonthrously arise.
But in Holy Church's cause, what's the odds of Nature's laws,
Or the dirty rules of evidence the Saxon loves so well;
Sure, if marthyrs can't be got,
Widout havin' brave boys shot,
We '11 shoot 'em upon paper, and that will do as well!
A Photograph whose Like was Never Seen.
We read that there is a new invention (by an American, of coarse)
that professes to print 12,000 photographs, or stereographs, in one
hour, and all by means of a single negative. That must be »"™>st as
great a negative as Frederick Peel himself—with this difference,
that Frederick Pbel is a negative that has never yet made any
satisfactory impression.

THE MATRIMONY MARKET.
It will of course be in the remembrance of our readers (who cannot
fail to recollect every precious word we print for them), that a month
or two ago we inserted an advertisement.—not in our fly-leaf,—which
purported to emanate from a young and Bingle gentleman, who was
desirous of finding a young lady for a wife. The advertiser said, with
equal modesty and truth, that he was accomplished, sweetly tempered,
and possessed of every virtue, including a fine figure and a fortune
made to match. All he stipulated for in the object of his choice was,
that the young lady should have health and cheerful spirits, and, as an
absolute necessity, should be a friendless orphan, that she might not
bring a mother-in-law or other meddlesome relation to vex her husband's
peace.
As a contrast to this simple and unselfish offer, we beg to call the
notice of our readers to the following, which has actually appeared in
a contemporary print:—
MATRIMONY—A GENTLEMAN under 30 years of age, engaged in
mercantile pursuits, and that extensively, takes this opportunity of obtaining
an INTRODUCTION to a LADY with a view to MATRIMONY. The advertiser
considers bin fortune equal to £12,000, he haB a very nice house standing in its own
S-ounds, which are extensive, in a vory healthy part of one of the finest counties in
ugland, and if any lady (after an introduction, shotild that prove mutually satis-
factory) possessed of a sum equal to one-half of his capital, wish or fool inclined to
link her fate with his, he will do all In his power to promote her happiness and
obtain her love. This mode of effecting a matrimonial alliance may bo novel, but
what is a man to do who cannot make his wants and desires k uown otherwise?
This advertisement is written in a fair and honourable spirit, the strictest reliance
may be placed in the integrity of the writer, and ho may be fully depended upon.—
Address, <£c.
Here the advertiser does not say so much about himself as did the
orphan-seeker to whom we have referred; but what he says is clearly
not a whit more modest, and scarcely bears upon it more the stamp of
truth. His description of himself is confined to merely stating that he
is in trade, and, in addition to a house which he regards as "very nice,"
he thinks he is possessed of a dozen thousand pounds. The statement
that he "considers" that his fortune " equals this, we consider to be
as cool a thing as we have lately heard of; and it surprises us that any
one "extensively engaged in mercantile pursuits" should have ven-
tured to make use of so unbusinesslike a phrase. Men of business
never dream of "considering " a property to be such and such a sum.
They ascertain by valuation what it really is, and then state in black
and white the actual amount.
Whether he be owner of twelve thousand pounds or not, it is pretty
clear the advertiser wants to grab six thousand, and we believe this is
the end and aim of his advertisement. Money and not matrimony is
his real object; and so long as she be owner of those six thousand
charms, he will little care what else his wife may have to recommend
her. There are men who are quite capable of marrying for money, and
if they get it, never think how sour their moneymoon may be to them.
As we write for the protection of the weaker-minded sex, we would
put them on their guard against these money-marrying monsters, who
make a trade of matrimony if they do of nothing else. Fine fortunes
are not to be made out of fine words, any more than are fine feathers
the makers of fine birds. A man "extensively engaged in mercantile
pursuits," may, after all, be only a baked potato merchant; and though
he might "consider" his fortune what he pleased, such consideration-
money is a rather doubtful tender for the purchase of a wife.

THE SPANISH REFORMATION.
Br all accounts the Spaniards are turning over a new
leaf in theirs, and are really taking steps towards re-
gaining their lost credit. From statistics lately published,
it appears that their home produce and their foreign
commerce have within the last ten years increased with
great rapidity; and as commerce can be scarcely deve-
loped without credit, we may presume that this has in like
measure been extended. "Better known than trusted"
was formerly the maxim in dealing with the Dons; but
there now seems to be a hope that as they get less
"knowing" they will gain more trust.
To show that they are on the highway to prosperity,
and wish to smooth all obstacles which beset their path,
| the Spanish Government last year obtained a vote of credit
for a milliard of reals, which they are applying to the
improvement of their roads. A milliard of their reals is ten
millions of our pounds—a goodish bit of money to throw
beneath one's feet and trample into dust. However, we
may hope that all this milliard of reals will be really well
laid out; and that the welfare as well as the way fare of
the country will progress the faster for them. We are
glad to see the Spaniards begin to mend their ways, for
the path they once pursued appeared the road to ruin. As
Englishmen, of course we take great interest in the
Spaniards, because for such a time we took so little interest
from them. Whether, now they have begun to see the
error of their ways, they may be viewed as being on the
road to reformation, and are likely to "stump up" the
debts they long have owed, we leave to sanguine specu-
lators, if they please, to calculate. For ourselves, we must
confess, that the last thing in the world we should expect
to get from Spain, would be, if we were bondholders, a
shipment of " the Spanish."

Under the head of "Military and Naval Intelli-
gence," we are apprised that—
"The Landrail, 5, screw, Commander Martin, went out of
Portsmouth harbour yesterday to Spithead on the completion of her
re pairs."
Here we have related two wonderful and unaccountable
facts. A Martin is placed in command of a Landrail, and
the Landrail walks the water! Surely, considered in a
locomotive capacity, a Landrail, properly so called, can
only travel on a railway.
OUR SISTERS IN AMERICA.
In the psges of the London American, we read that in New York
there has lately been opened a library for the exclusive use of women.
At first, we sarcastically thought that it must consist of nothing but
novels, but we never were more mistaken, the collection being as
varied as that of the London Library in St. James's Square, only not
quite so numerous. The one is as yet only a baby,—a mere literary
infant,—whilst the other has arrived to the full-grown proportions of a
lusty intellectual manhood. The library has met with the greatest
success, and publishers and printsellers have vied with each other in
filling its walls and its shelves with presents. "The subscription is a
dollar (4.v. id.) a-year, for those who can afford it, and nothing for
those who cannot."
Would a similar Woman's Library answer in London P We strongly
believe it would, especially if opened in the evening, when the British
Museum and other libraries are closed. Besides, how many poor girls
are there who cannot afford fire and candle in the evening to enable
them to stop at home after their working-hours are over, and would
only be too glad of such a refuge, where they could improve and amuse
themselves, free from importunities, free from temptations, happy,
warm, and comfortable, until the clock warned them it was time to go
to bed P If a similar institution be ever established, we beg leave to
propose Miss Bessie Parkes as its noble librarian!
The Prince of Wales visited the Woman's Library. During the
interview, the following handsome tribute was paid:—
"The room was crowded with ladles. The Prince entered, leaning upon the arm
of the Chancellor or the University, and was roceiYed by Miss Powell (the
) brarian), who, on behalf of the ladies, said, 'Baron, we are happy to welcome to a
Woman's Library the Bon of a Royal Lady whom the women in America regard as
an honour and a pride to all womanhood.'
Bravo! We little suspected that the Women of America could say
such generous things; but then it was a live Prince who inspired the
graceful tribute. However, the compliment is all the more genuine
and valuable, as from the great gallantry, amounting to adoration, that
is shown to the female sex in America, the ladies are much more in
the habit of receiving compliments than of paying them. Amongst the
many pleasant recollections the Prince has brought home from
America, none, we will be bound, will occupy a more prominent or
grateful place than the above. It is a recollection that, in his mind,
will be ever wrapped up in lavender.
A POLONAISE AND VARSOVIENNE.
Dancing appears to have been the principal occupation of the illus-
trious personages who chiefly figured in the late Conferences at War-
saw. "Everything," of greater consequence, says a telegram from
Paris, "was limited to short conversations upon two or three principal
points of the general state of affairs;" so that the intercommunications
exchanged by the three crowned heads may be supposed to have nearly
resembled those which usually pass between Brown, Jones, and
Bobinson in the Commercial Room, when one of those travelling gen-
tlemen asks another, "What's your opinion of things in general f"
In admirable keeping with the light and lively drama which is now in
course of performance on the Theatre of Italy, the high conferring
parties engaged themselves chiefly in the dance. Ad hoc the Governor
of Warsaw, Prince Gortschaxof* gave a ball; whereat, according to
the Pott.—
"The Emperor Alexander appeared about half-past ten, and remained until
half-past one. All took part in the 4 Polonaise,' and amongst the princely persons
who danced in it were the young Cesarewitch of Russia, Prince Charles of Prussia
and the Grand Duke or Saxe-Weimar. Tbe number of invitations was between
300 and 400, but amongst these only about 25 ladies could be reckoned on as part-
ners. The Polish ladies were absent as far as possible.''
The Royal and Imperial Absolutists, happily unable to agree in
any scheme to defeat the constitution of an United Italy, were
forced to content themselves with dancing over the grave of Polish
freedom. No wonder the ladies of Poland declined to assist in that
"Polonaise."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 10, 1860
UNNATURAL SELECTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF SPECIES.
(A Paper intended to be read at Our Social Science Congress, by One icho has
been spending half-an-hour or so tcitk Darwin.)
Gentleman of social
science, endeavouring
to find a key to the
mysteries of wedlock,
and who being a sin-
gle man, has taken
his degree as a bache-
lor of hearts, has
started the new theo-
ry of Unnatural Se-
lection, by which he
f- says, nine happy cou-
ples out of every ten
are influenced. Cer-
tainly, the number of
queer matches—or
rather of mis-matches
—that one daily sees
and hears of, tends

strongly to confirm
our friend's L
i ingenious
hypothesis. Short
husbands are so fre-
quently assorted with
tall wives, and men
of substance (looked
lit bodily) so often
seem to marry the
smallest women they
can find, that "Like
selects Unlike," would
appear to be the
maxim of the marriage-making world. The same rule too apparently applies not
less injmental than in personal respects. Bad tempers are continually found allied
with good ones, and the sweetest dispositions are united to the sourest. The
instances of this are far too numerous and frequent for any one in reason to
attribute them to accident; and that they result from some fixed principle in
nature, it scarcely saems presumptuous in one to presume. According to the
theory which lately has been started, men are moved by nature to make what seem
at first unnatural selections, and to choose for partners
in the great business of liie, parties as dissimilar as can
be to themselves. Variety of species, both personal and
mental, is thus everywhere maintained; and as variety is
charming, we cannot well regret that this should be the
case.
When we see an ugly lout with an extremely pretty
wife, we are naturally inclined to feel a savage sort of
sorrow to see Beauty so mismatched; and we regret that
some fine handsome fellow (such for instance as oneself)
had not had the fortune to save Beauty from the Beast.
On second thoughts, however, philosophy and science both
dispose us to contentment with our singly blessed state:
for we reflect that Beauty possibly may have a wayward
temper, and may perhaps be pleasanter to look at than to
live with. Besides, we are consoled by thinking that mis-
matches have a tendency to propagate variety of species:
and if variety were wanting, eccentricity and folly would
in time receive their death-blow, and the fuu which is
derived from them, of course would then die out.
It is all very well to talk about" Improvement of Species"
as being the effect of Natural Selection: but if this improve-
ment principle were carried to extremes, it would cease to
be a benefit, and would become an actual nuisance. It is
terrible to contemplate what sad results might follow, if
people were unnaturally select in their selections, and did
not sometimes make mistakes when they take a Miss to
wife. If mutual improvement were the object in all
marriages, the world would get so wise and good that
there would really be but little pleasure left in it. To
persons of refined and cultivated intellects, one of the
chief delights in life consists in laughing at the follies of
our fellow-creatures, and this elegant enjoyment is per-
petuated mainly by the widely-spreading practice of Unna-
tural Selection, through which such queer mismatches are
daily taking place.
Were improvement of their species the aim of all the
applicants lor wedding-rings and licences, we fear that
simpletons and snobs would in time become extinct; and
one well may shrink from thinking what a sadly stupid life,
if one survived them, one would nave of it. If every one
grew wise, there would be uobody to laugh at; and as a
climax to its sorrow at this melancholy bereavement, the
world would be deprived of the existence of its Punch.

R. Dreadful! Shameful! I say, Austria, fancy a grandson of your
own, one of these days, shaking hands and waltzing with the descend-
ants of your revolted Lombards, and standing, hat in hand, at the tomb
of Garibaldi.
A. He hasn't got a tomb yet.
P. What, do you, too, think him immortal P
A. You'll see, if I catch him. He won't have a tomb, though, even
if he is buried—at the foot of the gallows.
P. You saw how Blondin crossed the Falls of Niagara P
R. On a tight-rope, with another fool at his back.
A. I wish he had been that fellow at the Tuileries, with Victor
Emmanuel, or the other vagabond, on bis shoulders, and that his foot
had slipped, and they had both tumbled in.
P. Garibaldi would have been saved even then, if your wishes
could be fully gratified in regard to him—and if there is truth in
proverbs, he wouldn't have been drowned.
R. If Blondin had, what a sight for Wales I But no, they love
the people—I may say their species; for they are not of us. They
have taught their family to truckle to democracy—confound them 1
P. Your Majesty!—I say !—I hope you will remember the connection
with that family which—
R. Pardon 1 of course I wished confusion to them in politics only.
Is there anything new at the Opera P
A. I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of State.
P. The remaik of a rather celebrated Venetian senator.
A. Bather of an Emperor who.would be glad if you would help him
to remain Sovereign of Venice.
R. Well, but what's to be doneP You want troops to fight France.
Can you pay them P
P. Where's the money to come from P
A. Israel. Those Jews could lend it if they chose. But they won't
negotiate another loan. I wish the Holy Father had surrendered that
young Mortara!
R. Suppose we persecute our Jewish subjects?
A. We might at least do that.
P. No, no, not in these times; and you would get no money if you
did—only drive them and their wealth to England—who is sufficiently
rich already.
A. Rich enough to settle a handsome fortune on a daughter.
P. Now come. I call that delicate. Well, I don't see what we can do.
R. Nor I.
A. Humph! Then I can only implore the help of the Saints.
R. I wish you may get it.
P. What's your opinion of things in general?
R. Well; really they seem at sixes and sevens. A fine October
A. A bright autumn after a gloomy summer. Let us hope for
change of political weather.
P. Oranges are late this year.
A. Yes, and potatoes scarce. But that won't affect us Monarchs-
that's a comfort!
P. When shall we three meet again?
R. This evening, and—By Jove, 'tis time to be off and dress for the ball,
P. To dance the Polonaise without, I fear, the assistance of many
Polish ladies. Wimporte! We can be each other's partners at Warsaw!
| Their Majesties dance the Varsovienne round the Table, and exeunt
dancing.

TYPE OF THE MEDICAL BOGTJE.
In an interesting letter on "The Wounded at Naples," a corre-
spondent of the Morning Pott, signing himself "Eye Witness," makes
the following statement:— .
"Tho whole things confided to Dr. , who is not an Englishman, but a German
Jew, and who represented himself as surgeon to Garibaldi (a falsehoodX are either
lost or These were the mostcostly instruments and presents from, I think,
several of the largo manufacturers (among which was a case from Tukocson) splints,
bandages, plasters, and other things."
The name of the medical gentleman of the German nation and
Hebrew persuasion who either lost or the surgical instruments
and appliances which he had been entrusted with, and most probably them, Ete-Witness forbears to publish. This reticence is im-
posed by the British law of libel; which, as worked by British barristers,
and administered by British judges and British juries, is the segis of
dishonest quacks. The publication, however, of a name probably as
common in Houndsditch as that of Smith is elsewhere, would, whilst:
involving the risk of a lawsuit serve no useful purpose. The names of
the patriarchs and princes of Israel, now popular in Houndsditch, are
capable of an expansion or contraction by which they are effec-
tually disguised. Moss is an honest Saxon name; but it is likewise
a corrupt aliat of Moses. The name of Lawrence is one which
several Englishmen have rendered honourable: but La whence is also
convertible with Lazarus unconverted. Thus the nominal exposure
of the rogue who pretended to be Garibaldi's surgeon, and whom
somebody, regardless or ignorant of physiognomy, trusted with goods,
i would not prevent him from setting up in London as an advertising
j quack, getting his loathsome puffs put into many of the provincial
papers, as well as some which disgrace the London press, and driving
about Town in a conspicuous equipage.
Transmuting the name which he had rendered infamous, he would
carry on a noisome and extortionate practice, either under a variation
of that, or beneath a simply assumed one—foreign possibly or aristo-
cratic. Thus he would, notwithstanding his antecedents, be enabled
to plunder, under pretence of treating, as many simpletons as his
advertisements might attract; youths or adults, who, havine fallen ill
'through folly, commit the greater folly of seeking to get wellby putting
themselves into the hands of medical advertisers, who pick their
pockets, and ruin their constitutions. It is useless as well as (thank
the law) dangerous, to denounce these blackguards personally; but
happily a description of the tribe is not actionable, and physically they
are almost as like one another as rat is like rat. There is also a generic
character about their very attire. By the study of their features,
especially of their eyes, noses, and lips; by attention to their style of
dress, and particularly the pins and other jewellery by which it is
mostly decorated, these fellows are easily distinguishable from the
decent and respectable part of mankind. Comic and characteristic art
has so richly embellished Mr. Punch's columas with portraits of gen-
tlemen of the race in question, that he who runs may read tneir
distinctive lineaments.
SIMPLE SONGS EOR SIMPLE SINGERS.
Simplicity in song-writing has been of late supplanting sentiment-
Fine language apparently is going out of fashion, and in place of high
flown humbug about pensive eyes and soul-drawn sighs, or breaking
hearts and Cupid's darts, our ballad-writers now appear contented to
describe the ordinary incidents of everyday domestic life. Things every
whit as common as those of Mr. Times, are seized upon as subjects
for lyrical development, and are spoken of in words as simple as the
singers whose taste they seem to suit. From the tittle of a morning
call to the tattle of an evening party, nothing is too frivolous or flimsy
for these song-wrights, who apparently consider that any stuff and
nonsense will do to set to music so long as it has rhythm and occa-
sionally rhymes.
If these simple songs were sung at befitting times and places, really
there would be but little to object to in them. Indeed, we own we
should prefer them to the "Jrill-you-love-aie-then-as-nowt" and other
, senseless twaddle which has emanated lately from the sentimental
school. But the singers of these songs appear to pay no heed to the
fitnesS of things, wliich is a philosophic notion quite beyond their
mental grasp. Absurdities in consequence are frequently engendered,
and the reflective mind is pained by thinking what egregious donkeys
people will make of themselves, in spite of all that Punch and other
human benefactors can do to prevent them. Imagine how ridiculous
a gentleman must seem who when standing by the side of a piano in a
parlour, bursts out gravely with the statement that he's "Sitting on
the style, A/a-ry!" where ne and that young person once "sat side by
side." Nor is it much less ludicrous to hear Miss Brown or Jones,
who has but just left school, tell every one that hears her, that she
"always has a welcome" for them if they happen to drop in, just as
though she had a house and a husband who allowed.her to give general
invitations to whomever she might wish. >
After all, however, these simple songs must sell, or they would not
be written; and as we like to suit all tastes, and tempt all sorts of
buyers for our world-pervading print, we may as well just knock off a
specimen or two, which may serve to show the public what we could ,
do in the song line, if we chose to try:—
I. II Petueroso.
I'm leaving thee in sorrow, Jane,
I heave a deep-drawn sigh;
A quiver, see, is on my lip,
A tear is in my eye:
And would'st thou ask me whence the pang
That fills my heart with pain P
'Tis simply that I'm called away
From my dear darling Jane!
I may no longer now delay
• The cab is at the gate;
The fare is sixpence extra, love,
If I should longer wait.
Farewell! 'tis business calls me forth
At six I'll come again,
And briDg perhaps a friend to dine
With my dear darling Jane!
i II. VAllegro.
I have always a welcome for thee;
And prithee what more can I say P
. So look in some evening to tea,
And then we will go to the play.
Or if yon'd prefer, dear, to dine,
'Twill be equally pleasant to me:
Or say that you '11 drop in to wine,
I have always a welcome for thee!
I commonly breakfast at ten;
But if that be too early for you.
It would make me the happiest of men
To see you to lunch, love, at two.
I care not how oft I'm looked up,
Such intrusions are pleasant to me:
Come to breakfast, lunch, dine, tea or sup,—
1 have always a welcome for thee!
III. IlSegreto.
I am a merry, laughing girl,
As every one may see; ,
And I can keep my hair in curl,
And I can make the tea.
I've learnt to dance, to Bing, and play
As every lady should: •
And if I promised to "obey "—
Now, do you think I would P
A nice young man I lately met,
His name I may not tell,
And in the course of the First Set"
He vowed he loved me well.
He dances sweetly, I confess.
He owned my pace was good,
And if he asks me to say yes—"
Now, do you think I would P
DIES NON IN THE MONEY MARKET.
The subjoined telegram from Paris was dated Nor. 1:—
"This being All Saints' Day, no business has been done on the Bourse."
The same day was also observed as a holiday at our Stock Exchange
—not, of course, merely because it was the half-yearly balancing day at
the Bank of England, but with a view to express a veneration for All
Saints, which is not generally supposed to be felt by all stockjobbers.
This is a very remarkable illustration of that kind of outward observance
whioh is simply external. The respeot towards Saints exhibited by
gamblers, must really be admitted strongly to exemplify the homage
that is sometimes rendered to Virtue by Vice.
Botchers Extraordinary.
On the supposition that the Czar, the Kaiser, and the Prussian
Regent will attempt to put a stop to the substantial repairs now in
course of making in the Italian boot, Mr, Edwin James has, we un-
derstand, christened the conference of Warsaw "The Bootmakers'
Early Closing Association."

MR. PUNCH HAVING HEARD OF THE EXCELLENT QUALITIES OF THE EXMOOR PONIES, PROCURES A FEW
FOR THE LITTLE FOLKS!
AMERICAN POLISH FOR A PRINCE.
Old hoss, John Bull, take back your Prince
From our superior nation,
Where he has been, for some time since,
Completin' education.
I calculate, though Wales is young,
He's gathered many a wrinkle,
And, when you hear his polished tongue,
Expect your eyes will twinkle!
Yankee doodle, &c.
Lord Chesterfield, old pigtailed beau,
Composed a book of letters,
To teach young fellers, no ways slow,
The manners of their betters.
They learn far better to behave
In this here land of Freedom,
Where none but Nigger is a slave,
Than boys in old Orandeedom.
Yankee doodle, &c.
Demeanour has its nateral laws
Which governs every motion.
How beautiful we smokes and chaws
You '11 now acquire some notion.
As Wales our fashions will import,
In them there pints of breedin",
And set a pattern to the Court
Which knows 'em but by readin*.
Yankee doodle, &c.
To liquor up in handsome style,
Instructing your great noodles,
He '11 bid Newcastle make Argyll
And Beaufort timberdoodles,
Mint juleps, which they learnt to brew
Beneath our starry banners,
And also Sherry Coolers, tu
Mend your old English Manners.
Yankee doodle, &c.
The horizontal attitude,
With legs upon the table.
Outstretched at easy latitude,
And length considerate,
By Wales the nobles will be taught;
And people's imitation
Of them, the custom, slick as thought,
Will spread throughout the nation.
Yankee doodle, &c.
New York in dancing goes ahead,
Some chalks, of Pans city,
If we ha'n't shown him how to tread
A polka, 'tis a pity.
Deportment's larnt with dancing, so,
Now Wales can show his mother
On one hand how we shakes the toe,
And rests the heels on 'tother.
Yankee doodle, &o.
HUILE ANTIQUE.
What odd animals are the Anointed! The instant a Continental
Sovereign, or a batch of his like, arrives in a place, no matter on what
high business of alliances, a people's freedom, or such matter, Royalty
instantly rushes to the Theatre. The Prompter's bell breaks up
conference, congress, council, and nothing must prevent Majesty, in
military uniform, from taking its place at the Show. Is it that Kings
have sympathy with speeches that are not in earnest, oaths that are
hut sport, acting that is intended to delude? Evil folks may say so.
But what is to be said for the Czar of Russia, who, on getting to
Warsaw, pulls up at the Theatre door, and is so delighted with a ballet
which he witnesses, that he insists on going again next night. Now
the main feature of this ballet, writes a Correspondent of the Daily
Neiet, is "a certain French dance, which I need not name." In other
words, it is a dance which, if Jules and Celestine and Arthur and
Lisette dare to attempt at the dancing gardens, a policeman walks off
the amiable quartette for offence against public propriety. And this is
the attraction which twice lured to the Theatre a Sovereign who had
left a dying mother, that he might come and ponder, with brother
Sovereigns, over the future of millions of his and their subjects. As
one King, corrected for bad Latin, nobly declared himself to be
"above grammar," it may be supposed that Czars and the like con-
sider themselves to be above Decorum. But the Oil seems getting
something rancid, and Lord John Russell may be right in intimating
that it may be well, sometimes, to clean out the Cruets.
When does "Lovely Woman stoop to folly F" When she stoops to
put on her Crinoline.

THE CONFERENCE OF THE EAGLES.
Well may the Eagles—lords of sable pinion—
Hear their quill feathers in aa angry flutter,
When the small birds, that own their high dominion,
With impious insolence begin to mutter
Of " Rights," "laws," "charters," "freedom of opinion"
—AVords which small birds are not allowed to utter,
Since they, by utterance, unless checked by acts,
Have a strange trick of making themselves facts.
. Scenting the risk, his Eagleship of Russia
Was nowise loath a conference to grant
When moved to't by his Eagleship of Prussia;
And though his vein of courtesy was scant
Towards his Austrian Eagleship (once flusher
Of conGdence),—as mindful of his want
Of gratitude, when, ready to miscarry,
lluss claws struck down for him his Magyar quarry.
His Eagleship of Austria was invited,
To join the aquiline deliberation—
It'» true the footing on which he was cited,
Was not quite that of the most favoured nation—
But an) how these Eagles three alighted
Upon the spot, where on a great occasion,
They had rent Poland's carcase—bound and
Into three parts, for their Imperial feeding.
There was the carcase, and there were the Eagles,
Got into conclave, sternly and sedately:
Round tbeni, keen-scented as a pack of beagles,
Their ministerial jackals barked elately.
And, clamouring eager—like a flock of seagulls
Over a herring-shoal rejoicing greatly—
l'he host of birds obscene—vultures and so forth—.
Who tta<hk meat's toward, when the Eagles go forth.
Quoth Russia, "Brother Eagles, we come hither
Warned by times big with each portentous omen:
The Eagle's world will soon go deuce knows whither,
Unless we band ourselves against its foemen,
With beaks and talons phalanxed Arm together.
Look round on Frank, Sicilian, Magyar, Roman,
All are, or soon will be, free of our tether;
The impious doctrine daily makes its way.
That Eagles have no right divine to prey.
"Europe has ouce seen an Alliance Holy
Between the Eagles, for the Eagles' profit;
Eagles that would prey safely, prey not solely;
If game be too small for three to dine off it,
That is no reason each should snatch it wholly:
I love my crown, but I would sooner doff it,
Than rob my Brother Eagles of a snack,
Though, by dividing, I went hungry back.
"So let's agree here to make common cause
'Gainst all who to resist us show intention—
Invoking Royal faith and public laws
'Gainst that vile heresy 'non intervention,'
Devised to clip Eagles' anointed claws;
Inspiring the small birds to breed dissension;
Raising up noisy rooks and choughs and daws,
To talk of 'equal rights' and 'nationality'—
Subversive of religion and morality."
"Agreed," screamed Austria—Prussia screamed "Agreed,
At least, in generals. Now for each particular—
There's Schleswig-Holstein, prey to Danish greed,
You'll help me there—swear by your own St. Nikola."
"And swear," quoth Austria, "with swoop perpendicular
On Piedmont to come down, in hour of need;
Her Volunteers and Regulars to scatter all,
If they lay hands upon my Quadrilateral."
"Help me to guard the Rhine from annexation,"--
Prussia took up the word, with eager scream.!
"Secure me 'gainst Hungarian perturbation,"—
Austria struck in, "Break up India's dream
Of what those idiots call 'regeneration,'
And Unity—the old Mazzinian theme;
Keep up that dear Pope's temporal domination;
Help back my Bombalino to his throne,
And each Italian Eaglet to bis own."
The Russian Eagle hemmed and ha'd and said:
"Hold, brethren—your account of wants is long.
You '11 pardon me, if I suggest, instead,
'Nothing for Nothing' is the Eagle's song.
How long were my crown safe upon my head,
If I pushed in. your little games among F
now long should I boast head to wear a crown,
If I tried setting up all vou've brought downP
"I want help too. My treasury wants filling:
Can either of you help me to a loan?"
"A loan!" cried Austria, " when I've not a shilling!"
"I want a fleet!"—here Prussia heaved a groan—
"To fight, my army's anything but willing;
Then I've internal bothers of my own—
Railways to build, serfs to emancipate,
And tnat Sick Man's still sitting at my gate,
"With France and England sending their physician*,
To try if they can't patch him up to health.
In short, when I consider our positions,
In purse and person, stamina and wealth,
I think I'd best adjourn all your petitions,
And try my old game. Weakness thrives by stealth.
1 really feel reliance now were rash on
Alliances, e'en of onr Holy fashion."
So saying, Russia's Eagle, with a bow,
Gave them a chilling conge and was gone.
And Prussia's Bird, crestfall'n and angry now
That such fool's errand she had flown upon,
Sulks with drooped tail and cloudy knitted brow.
While Austria, shrinking from the sun that shone
On Solferino and Magenta's flight,
Wings back her baffled way tolrindred night!
ABSOLUTE CHURCH FREEDOM.
What British Protestant will dissent from the doctrine thus laid
down by M. db Montalembert, in his letter lately addressed to the
Count de CavoukP—
"All tho civil andpolitic.il liberties which constitute the natural rtginu of civilised
society, far from boiag Injurious to tho Church, aid its progress and its glory. It
fiads rivalry, but at the samo time rights, struggles but arms, and thoeo which suit
it more than any other, languago, association, charity. Liberty, however, is not
suited to tho Church, oxcopt on one condition—that Is, that she herself enjoys li berty.
I speak horo in mynimo, without mission,without authority, foundodsofolyon along
experience singularly enlightened by the state of France for the last ten years. But
I say without hesitation—a freo Church in a free State is my ideal. • I add that in
modern society the Church cannot be tree except when everybody is free. That,
in my eyes. Is a great blessing and a groat progress. In any case it is a fact."
Respecting the principles above laid down, Mr. John Bull will
heartily roar Ditto to M. de Montalehbert. The fact, too, pro-
claimed by the amateur Jesuit, only seems not quite so unquestionable
as the theory, because it is not quite so clear. Does M de Montaleh-
bert mean to say, that the necessity of the freedom of everybody to
the freedom of the Church is a fact? If so, where did he learn that
fact? In what country is everybody free? The United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland presents a picture, commonly supposed to be
a tolerable likeness, of perfect freedom; at least there is no other
country in the world where everybody is more nearly free. Are we to
conclude, then, that M. db Montalehbert beholds his ideal free
Church in Her Majesty's dominions F Here, certainly, that Church
and all other Churches are equally free, and that one, in public esti-
mation, is somewhat more free than welcome. But perhaps his con-
ception of a Free State differs considerably from that entertained by
the majority of other people. A Free State is commonly understood to
mean a State in which everybody, subject to the obligation of not
injuring others, is at liberty to do as. he pleases. Possibly the State
which M. de Montalembert would call free, is a State which is free
to do whatever pleases the Church, and nothing more. This seems to
have been the condition of the Roman States in the palmiest days of
the Papacy. The ideal free Church in a free State of M. db Mont-
alembert, therefore, has had existence only in the States of the
Church when those States were subject to absolute Church Government.
A Family Trait.
At a grand Republican meeting held at Rochester, in the United
States, we notice that one of the greatest speakers was a Senator, from
Wisconsin, of the name of Doolittle. We imagine that this Senator
has a rare number of relations in this country, and it is a very noticeable
fact all over the world, that whenever you meet with a Doolittle, he
is sure to be a great talker.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 10, 1860.
A CROWNING CONCLUSION.
Dr. Johnson, when he was in a good humour, was in the habit of
saying, that " the Devil was the first Whig?" If so, the Wig in question
must nave been an Old Scratch.

SHARKS ON THE SOUTH COAST.
(J Study from St. Harold's.) lb Mr. Punch.
"Sir,
The Shark is not confined to the tropical seas. The visitors to
our South Coast watering-places may now and then have the satisfaction
of seeing one of these grinning monsters of the deep paraded on a
truck by the fishermen— among whose herring nets he has made havoc
—wilh a wedge between his toothed jaws, his piratical tail-fin stiff, and
his white belly turned up to the sun. You are expected to pay for the
exhibition, and your contribution, you are assured, goes to replace the
nets he has damaged. Well—a dead shark is no doubt a gratifying
sight, but it seems cruel to exact sixpences for dead sharks, under the
eyes and noses of so many live ones, who are gratifying their predatory
and devouring instincts on every unhappy paterfamilias, who seeks
the sea-side for a sniff of the briny. I felt this strongly the other day
at St.. Harold's.
"The sea-shark, to whose manes I was called upon to offer up my
shilling, was, beyond question, a fine specimen of the Chondropterygian
family. He looked as if he could eat anything, and digest everything
he eat. My Natural History informs me the sea-shark is of the family
Sgualidte. la this respect, as in so many others, the land-shark, with
which St. Harold's has familiarised me, evidently belongs to the same
species. The St. Harold's land-shark is eminently 'squalid,' to judge
by its obvious delight in unswept rooms, soiled bed-furniture, greasy
glass, and ill-cleaned table-cutlery. And I don't think—to judge by
my weekly bills, the rapid disappearance of my joints, and the alarming
diminution of my bread-stuffs—that his powers of deglutition are a bit
inferior to those of hi3 brother of the deep.
"I have always understood the sea-shark is omnivorous. One has
heard strange stories of the telescopes, tobacco-boxes, chain-cables,
and other indigestible articles found in his stomach, when cut open,
along with edibles usually considered more nutritious. But in this
respect, too, the land-sharks of our southern coast seems to be little
inferior to the sea cestracion. One peculiarity in the predacious
habits of the former is their extraordinary relish for condiments. The
quantity of salt, pepper, anchovy-sauce, pickles, and that cluster of
seasonings usually lumped under the head of cruets, which they can
dispose of in the course of a week, is truly astonishing.
The land-shark has the advantage over the sea-shark of being
furnished, not only with a most devouring pair of jaws and an insa-
tiable stomach, but also with that very formidable weapon—a bill. In
this respect, he should rather be classed with the sword-fish, or the
Ornithorhyncus paradoxus.
"I had once thought of presenting to my readers the truly appalling
bill which I extracted from my land-shark at St. Harold's; but on
second thoughts, it occurred to me that every paterfamilias who has
sojourned on the Sussex Coast could parallel my specimen, so I will
content myself with a trait in the habits of this predacious family, the
experience of which, so far as I know, is confined to my own case.
Let every paterfamilias who visits St. Harold's take care that the
land-shark.within whose maw he falls, is not grocer, as well as land-shark.
"It was my fate to be a victim to this combination of characters.
The sugar was sanded; the tea innocent apparently of all connection
with the Celestial Empire; the milk sky-blue; the pickles pea-green;
and the butter rancid. I remonstrated; I was fiercely chidden. I
tried other sources of supply; the groceries I ordered in were refused
admittance at my tyrant's door. The fact is hardly credible, but it is
literally true. I—a struggling paterfamilias, with a large family—was
sternly told, that if I lodged over a grocer's I could not expect to be
allowed to have in any groceries from a rival in the trade. He rudely
overrode all my legal pleadings that serfage was abolished in Great
Britain,—that the villein regardant, or adscriptus gleb/e, being un-
known to our law, his ri^ht to make me an adscriptus taberna: could
not be admitted; and when I meekly protested that I had not tried
elsewhere till I found what was supplied by my tyrant uneatable,—
especially the butter—I was sarcastically met, ' What! did you expect.
I was going to give you my choicest dairy F'—and the she-shark all
but ordered me and mine out of the house, bag and baggage, declaring
with a withering contempt which made my poor wife tremble, that ' all
she wanted was the amount of her bill, and that her lodgings were
anybody's money.'
Considering that I was at that moment bleeding from every pore—
that I found myself debited in stones of salt, pounds of pepper, pints
of vinegar, candles for hall-lamps by the pound, and 'cruets,' de par
le marche—1 did feel it hard that I should be coerced into swallowing
so much more than the uormal allowance of sand in my sugar, water in
my milk, and rancid lard in my butter, and I confess I kicked. But
lest other paterfamiliases, less gifted with the power of kicking,
should fall into the same trap, I hereby record my experience, and
recommend them most earnestly not to go and do likewise.
"The moral of my tale is simply, Never Lodge over a. St.
Harold's Grocer; or if you do, take care to ascertain eirst,
that you will be at liberty to buy your groceries where
you like. « Yours respectfully,
"Thomas Greenleaf."
SEWERAGE AND SALMON-FISHING.
This paragraph smacks sadly of the penny-a-liner flavour; but the re-
flective mind will fiud it not unpleasant food for mid-day rumination:—
"The Mais Drainaok.—Return or Salmon to the Thames.—Many years since,
before the introduction of steam navigation and the sewago was allowed to pollute
our noble metropolitan river, It was the resort of splendid specimens of that pisca-
torial delicacy, the salmon. Latterly, however, neither angling or netting conld
produce a single fish of that description, but the partial purifying of the river, which
has been progressing for the past year, together with the diversion of the main
drainage, and the absorption of the smoke of the steam-boats, appears likely to
reproduce the abundance of salmon in our noble stream. During the past year one
of this fisb, but of a moderate size, was caught off Erith : but yesterday ono of a
very large size was captured noar the same s[>ot, which was forwarded to Mr. C ,
of Pimlico, purveyor of fish to Her Majesty. It attracted much public attention,
and it is gonerally believed, when the main drainage is fully carried out, and other
general improvomonts offectcd, that tho Thames ana its tributaries will again abound
with those shoals of salmon for which, in tho days of Isaak Walton, and Ion*?
subsequently, they wore so celebrated."
The connection between salmon and main drainage may not at first
thought appear obvious or pleasant; but on more mature reflection,
the mind i9 led to think of them as separate and distinct, although they
may by accident be named in the same breath. It delights one to
reflect that the Thames is being purified, and that the main drainage
is progressing as it should do, and is draining something more than
the pockets of the public. But to the contemplative mind, and in
especial before dinner, there is something more delicious in considering
the statement that salmon have renewed their visits to our river, and
have been caught, so to speak, within a fly's-throw of our doors. We
can fancy the delight of our good friend Mr. Briggs when he reflects
upon the sport which appears to be in prospect, and how eagerly next
season he will practise lu his water-butt so as to be in readiness for
fishing in the Thames. Nor can it afford us much less pleasure to
imagine the transport of enjoyment of our fish-devouring gourmands,
when they learn they have a chance of seeing salmon caught and
cooked for them at Richmond or at Greenwich, without the fear of
rinding in it any soupcon of town sewerage, or flavour of main drains, j

FROM OUR YANKEE CORRESPONDENT.
"Broadway, Te useday, Mornm'."
"Wal, Punch, old hoss, and heow air you, and heow's the gals and
missus? Reckon them ar critters haeve been gitten sorter s wage cos
we've been and kep yar Prince such a 'nition while away from 'em.
Wal, tell 'em not to rile. Wc've retarned him safe and seound, and I
guess as heow his heart's as whole as when he come to us. 'Taiut for
want of trying, though. Our coons haeve set thar caps at him, yes,
that's A fact Sir-ree, and it's no small some of dancin' as he's had to git
through. I guess as heow the Mayors haeve bin as plaguey as
the Misses; and receivin' deppitations is pretty nigh as trying to the
narves as doing dootongs.
"Wal, the visit's over now, and he's done it like a Prince, and 1
reckon both our countries haeve reason tu be proud of it. 'faint
everywhere you'll find a bhoy can stand so much as he's done, and I
calc late he does credit tu the British Constitution! Nor 'taint
everywhere you'11 find sich A pleasant lot as we air, not ncedin' no
policemen fur tu to keep us in good humour, nor no sodgers for to
prick us up to cheerin'pitcli. That ar account of heow we welcomed
the Prince into New York (guess yar Times chap did it splendid, and
so he did Niagara, and if he'd given me a call I'd been most proud tu
liquor with him) that ar account, 1 say, should be printed in gold
letters and sent tu them ar coons at Warsaw, jist tu show heow A
free people Can welcome Riyal heads, if so be as they but likes 'em.
"Of course it worn't to be expected in such a tower as this,
extendin' over ever such a heap of thousand miles (for ours is A great
country, that's A fact old boss, and whar's the skunk who doubts it P)
say, it worn't to be 'xpected that all should go as sweet as sugar, ana
no flies. Human natur's human natur', and fools all'ys will be fools,
so long as they air made so. Them ar Orange boys, I reckon, were
plaguey aggrawatin', and desarved a smart cowhidin'; if they didn't
tar and featherin'. And here's another critter I'd have chawed up
orter small if I'd chanced to come across him:—J
"At throo o'clock tlio carriagos entered the arena to convoy tho distinguished
visitors from tho grounds. After riding entirely around the arena, the Prince
acknowledged the waving handkorchlofa, Ac, by raising his hat: tho party went
outsido the amphitheatre and rode around tho track, and passed out at the wostorn
gate, receiving evorywhere demonstrations of high rospect. Business was generally
suspended in tho City, tho Post Oiheo and Bulks being closod. Tho Priuco returned
to his hotel, and was again everywhere oheered. Ho was followed all along tho
route by a smart Yankee in an advertising waggon, covered with bills eulogising his
clothing storo."
"This is what the Herald tells us happened at St. Louis, and, as a
trade trick, there's no denyin' that it s smartish. Indeed, 1 don't
mind sayin' that it hully puts the kibosh on that scissargrinder's
dodge, of making his name public in connection with the Prince's by
presentiu' A armchair to his Riyal Highness. Wal, perhaps the best
excuse as one can make for this smart Yankee' (I wonder it the Riyal
band played Wait for the Waggon! as he passed in the procession ?) is
that there was a big hoss fair when the Prince went tu St. Louis; and
boss-dealers ain't over nice in what they du, and so perhaps the
Yankee's dodge was done at their suggestion. If it worn't, 1 'd say
St. Louis was as full of asses as Cincinnati is of pigs, else I reckon the
'smart Yankee' would have been made to smart for it.
"But, arter all, these countertongs must be expected in A country
where the people air so all-fired fond o' sticking to the counter. On
the whole, the Prince's Visit has been A Great Fact, and if he chose
to come agin I guess 't would be A greater. Here s a prophecy of
what might happen if he did, and there's many of our blioys who'd
lend a hand tu realise it:—
When tho Prince was seated In the car yesterday morning, an Irishman was
obsorvod giving vent to his leelings in a manner that Bhowed he was fairly over-
come with enthusiasm. After showering a score of compliments upon the Prince,
ho gave the coup de grace by swinging his hat and shouting. 'Be dad ! and como
back hero (our yoars from now and wo '11 run you for President 11 Tho Royal suito
were greatly amusod at this unoxpectol invitation, and tho Prince camo near tum-
bling from his seat In a paroxysm of laughter."
"There's a smack o' penny-a-liner flavour into this here; but I
reckon for all that there's a goodish some of sense in it. Jist you talk
it over at the Palace neow, old hoss, and see if you can't manage tu
arrange another visit.

Well 9aid, Johnny Russell. That latest despatch
You have sent to Turin is exactly The Thing,
And again, my dear John, you come up to the scratch
With a pluck that does credit to you and the Ring.
All the Despots have spoken, you justly remark.
Abusing Kino Victor for bloodshed and guile,
So you cau't suffer Europe to rest in the dark
Regarding the views of our tight little Isle.
You declare that a People has absolute right
To give irreclaimable Tyrants the sack,
And j cm point with Macaulayfied kind of delight,
To England's behaviour two centuries back:
Explaining that Naples is clearly as much
Entitled to ask the assistance she claims,
As England was, then, to make use of the Dutch
To help her extrusion of bigoted James.
But you've got no intention of bothering about
Affairs which are Italy's business, not ours;
You're pleased that she kicks all her enemies out,
And hauls down the Bourbonite flag from her towers.
You 're glad that King Victor had spirit and pluck
To set Bomba Secundus a cutting his stick:
And you wish the New Italy every good luck—
Well said, Johnny Russell, you write like a Brick.
A Very Easy One.
Why is the New Zealander taking his long-promised sketch of St.
gedP
Vaul's, like a school-boy that is being flogged
Because he's "ketching it" {sketching it).
A HEAVY FAN.
In the New York Herald's account of "The grand ball of the solid
men and splendid women of Portland to the officers of the squadron"
(in waiting to take the Prince of Wales home), there occurs, among
sundry descriptions of the clothes and ornaments worn by the roost
remarkable of the ladies who figured at that entertainment, the
following inventory, with appended remark:—
*'Mrs. E. C. Wilder, daughter of Hon. Marshal P. Wilder, wore a very
elegant and costly dross of white silk, flounced and embroidered, with a pink opera-
cloak, also richly embroidered. Hhe also wore a pearl necklace and earned a
costly pearl fan, which was used with all a woman's grace and power."
The embellishments in which the above-named lady appeared, no
doubt redounded to the glory of her own good taste as well as that of
her milliner, and reflected no less credit on the liberality of that relative
who was liable for, or paid, the milliner's bill, which must have
amounted to many dollars. Even the fan which she carried is
described as costly. A fan made of pearls, however, is not too costly
for a dear creature, and we can imagine the affection which would
allow, and the opulence which could afford, the purchase of such an
instrument, composed of the prettiest globules of a valuable form of chalk.
That a fan so constructed would naturally and unconsciously be used
with all the grace which a woman is capable of exhibiting, oue can
well imagine, but does not so well understand how the bearer could
use it with ail the power that a woman can exert. There is, to be sure,
such a thing as flirting a fan, for the purpose of attracting the admi-
ration of the beholders; but this a Spanish, and not an American,
practice.
The ladies of the United States are celebrated for standing no non-
sense; and we are afraid that when the pearl fan in the hands of the
lady at the Portland Ball was used with all a woman's power, it simply
broke the head, thick as that was, of some solid man there, who was
blockhead enough to infringe American decorum in addressing one of
the splendid women, by which inadvertence he got a crack on the crown
with her fan, instead of a less serious rap on the knuckles.

THE LORD MAYOR'S BANQUET.
{By our Special Reporter.)
Lord Mayor's Day was duly kept on the 9th, and none of its
ridiculous features were omitted. An unusual number of pickpockets
were in full occupation during the morning, plundering people who
were silly enough to stand and stare at the most imbecile Show con-
ceivable. Some Volunteers were kind enough to come, chivalrously,
to the rescue of the effete old exhibition, and, by marching between
the Bumbles and the Gobblefats, to try to infuse some spirit into the
display. But the Mayor is a Fishmonger, and the scaliness of the
whole business showed his attachment to nis Company. His Lordship
has appropriately selected the Ordinary of Newgate as his Chaplain,
an appointment which testifies to the Lord Mayor's conviction that
the mummery is moribund.
Guildhall was done up in the usual flaring way, and gas was turned
on regardless of expense, which extravagance the City can well afford,
considering its plunder out of the Coal Duties. The Gobblefats came
early to the dinner, and secured good places. The Swells, of course,
came later, and some of them were shouted at, in accordance with the
ordinary rudeness of Civic people. Dinner having been devoured,
speecbification set in with much severity. After the Loyal Toasts had
been "got over," as the Citizens disrespectfully put it,
The Lord Mayor proposed the Army, Navy, and Volunteers.
General Feel said that he had nothing to do with any of those
departments of the Service, and bad been a member of the late
Ministry, and was not in this one. He could not imagine what the Lord
Mayor was thinking of in calling npon him, but supposed there was
some blunder. However, as he was up, he might as well return thanks
for the toast, and congratulate the sleek Citizens upon having three
such services to defend their bales and puncheons.
The Duke of Someuset said that perhaps General Feel would at
all events be good enough to hold his tongue about the Navy, which
was his, the Duke's, business. He should like to hear anybody say the
Navy was not all right, and he begged to return thanks.
The Lord Mayor gave the Ex-Lord Mayor.
Alderman Carter said that he had tried to do his best. One of
his little boys had told him that there was a fable about Hercules and
the Carter, and that it meant that we were to put our shoulders to the
wheel He had put his lips to the weal at dinner, and very good weal
it was, but that was not the question now. He, Alderman Carter,
had pulled out of the way with his cart, and hoped the new Mayor
would go a-head.
The Lord Mayor gave the Foreign Ministers.
Count Persigny in reply said,
Milord Maire, et Messieurs.—II est un grand bore d'avoir de venir
et manger avec vous epiciera, et d'avoir un mal de tete avec votre
maudite gas, mais c'est uecessaire quand le diable est le Jehu. Mon dieu,
qu'elles sont laides, les citoyennes, et leur toilettes, ah, bah, poof!
Messieurs, je suis charme* de vous dire que mon auguste Souverain,
L'Empereur, n' a pas une seule idee d'invasion, a present, tout le
contraire, et vous pouvez dormir confortablement dansvos lits. C'est
vrai, Messieurs, et j'ajouteraiqu'il n'est pas un sot, et sait par fait emeut
bien sur quel cot6 son pain est beurre\ Eb, Messieurs, vous n' etes
pas des Solomons, mais vous avez compris que mon maitre et votre
ami le bon Cobden ont sous-sign & nne Trait 6 (derivator de Trahison),
et par cette Trait6, Messieurs, vous etes vot you call him—dun. Bien,
mes chers amis, pourquoi com batter avec ceux qui se donnent, francbe-
ment et avec humility, d'etre depouilles. Kestez tranquillement,
mes braves, et croyez que nous sommes raisonables. Milord Maire,
agreez, &c.
The next toast was the Lord Chancellor.
Lord Campbell said that one didn't come to the City for wit but
for wittles, and he had had a very good dinner, for which he was much
obliged. He had been reviewed by George the Third, and also
by the Quarterly, but he did not see how that concerned the present
audience.
The Lord Mayor then gave Lord Falmerston and the Queen's
Ministers.
Lord Palmerston (who was loudly cheered, especially by Lord
John Russell). My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. It is an
uncommonly jolly thing to come and eat these dinners sometimes,
though I don't mean to say for a moment that I should like to do it
often. Some great writer, Terence or Tupper, I forget which, has
observed that out of the conversation of the unwise the truly wise can
gather wisdom, and there is something to be learned sometimes from
Aldermen. We learn, for instance, what to eat, drink, and avoid; that
is to say, to eat their turtle, to drink their wine, and to avoid them-
selves. (Cheers and laughter.) I was greatly pleased with M. de Per-
signy's speech, as I am sure my noble friend the Foreign Secretary
will be when one of his young gentlemen translates it to him. I am
rejoiced that we have been and done it in China, and as citizens you.

orange in favour of those Armstrong guns. (Cheers.) As for the Volun-
teers, I am told they inarched in a remarkably elegant manner in the
Show to-day, and those who were so good-natured, ought, I think, to
be called "Gog's Own," for the future. I am sorry to hear that any
Volunteers are likely to be such asses as to be diddled into joining a
ridiculous expedition to Paris, but I trust that the number will be
small, and that they will all be expelled from their companies on their
return. Well, my Lord, we are Hampshire neighbours, and though
we can't quite do this sort of thing at Broadlands, I needn't say that
we shall always be delighted to see you there, and in the meantime I
congratulate you on getting upon a dais which has added a Cubit to
your stature. (Loud cheers!)
Mk. Gladstone. I have the honour of proposing the health of the
Loud Mayor. 1 always like three courses before me, but to-day I
have had nine. When I proposed that the people should have cheap
Claret, I did not exactly design to drink it myself; and I am bound to
say that this last bottle is an inconceivably thin potation. When I can
get a decent glass I will give the toast I am honoured with. (Tastes.)
Yes, that's more like it. That's real stuff, and not Treaty tipple.
Quam bonum est in visceribus meis! My Lord, you are a Conservative.
1 was one once, and may be again; but, that's nothing. 1 propose
your health, and, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, I thank you for
having built so many hundreds of residences for persons of the class
only too happy to contribute to the taxation which it is my duty to
impose—builders like you are indeed bricks.
The Lord Mayor gave the House of Lords and Lord Brougham.
Lord Brouoiiam said that he was going to speak for forty years.
(Sensation.) No, no, he meant that he had been speaking during
that time, and very frequently in the City. He hoped often to do
so again, and was very sorry that M. Berryeb was not in better
spirits.
The Lord Mayor gave the House of Commons and Lord Johs
Russell.
Lord John Russell said that he had perfectly understood M. de
Persigny, whose French was exceedingly pure (a bow from M. de P.),
and extremely like that which he. Lord John, adopted in his despatches.
He was very much iudebted to M. de Persigny for the warm tribute
he had paid to the administration of the Foreign Office by himself.
Lord J. Russell (M. de Persigny. "Mon ceil!"), and he hoped
long to deserve the praises which had been showered upon him. He
had his own authority and Dr. Cumming's for stating, that so long as
the Foreign Affairs of England were in his, Lord J. Russell's, hands,
so long would England pursue the exact path delineated for her by a
favouring Destiny.
Some other toasts followed, especially some exceedingly buttery
ones, which were handed round with the tea, and which the medical
gentlemen present recommended, with furtive smiles. There was also
a good deal of music, which prevented a certain amount of nonsense
from being talked and heard. We did not hear ot any particular
accidents up to the time of going to press.

HELP FOR BOMBALINO.
SSI8TANCE BOMBALINO Wants,
does he P His forces, being
'weaknesses, are in need
of reinforcements. Well,
we clearly have the means,
and we are charitably dis-
Eoaed, so let us lend a
and to help him.
At a moderate compu-
tation there are at this
present moment upwards
of ten million Organmenin
England. The majority of
these, we need scarce say,
live in London: twenty-
nine are playing within
earshot as we write. The
rest are resident in no par-
ticular locality, but infest
the highways generally
throughout the entire king-
dom, and are burglariously
occupied in breaking into
houses with their instruments of torture, aud extorting from their
inmates the blackest of black mail. The police, it seems, are power-
less to protect, us from these robbers, who steal away our brains like
the enemy of Cassius, and if they cannot rob us of our money, rob us of
our quiet, our comfort, and our rest.
Now might we not relieve both Bombaliko and ourselves by sending
him at once a contingent of these creatures, who are amply good
enough to be food for powder, and to serve the falling cruel tyrant's
cause? Detested as they are by all thinking persons here, the Organ-
men must surely lead most miserable lives, and it would be far better
to be shot down at Gaeta than be hunted down in England (as they
will ere long) by Punch. Besides, are they not Italians F Aud is it not
dutceet decorum pro patrid mori? To be sure, if they assisted the
wretched Bourbon cause, it could scarcely be asserted that they died
for Italy. Still they would have the satisfaction at least of dying in it,
and England would be grateful to them if Italy were not. We gladly
would engage Dr. Cullen aud his priests, and get up a subscription to
say masses tor their souls, if we only knew for certain that their bodies
had departed, and would not again molest us with their brain-dis-
tracting arts.
Persons of humane and charitable feelings, and the bumps of whose
benevolence are unusually big, might earn our lasting thanks by taking
up this mat ter; by enlisting first of all, say, the Bix or seven millions
of Organmen in London, and supplying them with ships and so forth
to depart. It would, we think, be hardly needful to furnish them with
arms, for of course care would be taken that they had their organs
with them, and it would be difficult to give them a more offensive
weapon. An organ in full play is indeed a deadly instrument, and he
must be a bold man who would at short range dare to face it. Our
chief fear, in fact, would be that, like the brave Irish Brigade, the
Organmen would prove rather difficult to kill, and would come back
like those martyrs to be feted in the flesh, instead, as we would wish,
of being henceforth heard of only in the spirit.
NO MORE SAXON FOR CELTS!
An Irish patriot and geographer, called The O'Donoghue, who is
said to have discovered that Ireland is not a part of Great Britain, has,
in concert with several compatriots, embarked in an agitation for the
Repeal of the Union which connects Great Britain with Ireland. With
a view to the prosecution of their advantageous and hopeful design,
they are about to expose themselves at an assembly which the Nation
announces in the following paragraph:—
"We ore happy to learn that our highly-talonted and distinguished countryman.
The O'Donoohi'r, MI', aud Mi: George Henry Moore, with other gentlemen of
known patriotism and abilities, have signitied their intention to be present at a
mooting in favour of Ireland's right to choose her own rulers which is shortly to bo
held in this City."
Repeal, which an O'Connell proved unable to carry, is evidently
going to be accomplished by the O'Donoghue. We are fortunately in
a position to be enabled to explain the means by which the success of
this hitherto impracticable undertaking will be secured. The O'Don-
ogiiue's discovery that Ireland is not a part of Great Britain involves
the equally important discovery that Irish is not English; that the
language of one of these couutries differs from that of the other. This
being so, it is felt that a great mistake has been made by Irish patriots
in going on, year after year, shouting for repeal in the language of
Dr. Johnson and Lindlby Murray. A man s speech bewrayeth him
all the world over, and The O'Donoghue and his associates find that
they have been howling for Irish nationality in the Saxon tongue amid
the ridicule of mankind. They have therefore determined that the
rights of Ireland shall henceforth be proclaimed in Irish. It is their
intention to harangue their countrymen in the original brogue which
served Brian Boru or Burroo—or whatever they call him—to express
his ideas, such as he had, and was employed by St. Patrick in con-
verting the natives of the Emerald Isle aud bothering the varmint.
The national language will also be adopted by all the Ultramontane
Press, and especially of course by the Nation. By" this expedient
great facilities will be gained for publishing treason with impunity.
Religious journals will be enabled to express uubounded sympathy for
Sepoys or other savages undergoing persecution for the slaughter of
English heretics. Yelling with joy over the reverses of Britons in wild
Irish, the faithful, intelligible only to each other, will not create that
scandal of which his Holiness the Pope is now reaping some of the
consequences in the influence exerted by England on his temporal affairs.
The O'Donoghue himself, if with the Speaker's permission, he shall
address the House of Commons in his native language, will be quite
as patiently listened to, and as implicitly credited as he would it' he
were to solicit the dismemberment of the Empire, abuse the Italian
nationalists, and trumpet forth the wrongs of tortured Ireland, in terms
which all his hearers could understand. Erin go bragh! Hurroo for
The O'Donoghue—the gentlemau that goes iu lor an Irish Parliament,
and has the definite article for a handle to his name
Valuations Taken.
We fancy a very pretty Rule of Three sum might be wonted out of
the title of a book, which has recently been introduced to the notice of
the public, under the name of t he Valley of a Hundred Fires. If, as
the advertisements tell us, it is possible to get "Four Fires for a
Penny," it would not be very difficult, we imagine, to ascertain what
the valley" of a hundred tires would come to. Any school-boy, or
Lord Malmesbuay, could do it.

But their foolscaps, sheets, and stools as well
May now be transferred to Klotz-Boussel—
Klotz-Boussel, Klotz-Boussel,
Bare your back for the rod, Hehb Klotz-Boussel!
We all of us know what chef d'ccuvres they are,
Those neat billet-doux of the honied Mocquabd,
When there's fool to gammon, or knave to propel;
Which head do you come under, Klotz-Boussel P—
Klotz-Boussel, Klotz-Boussel,
Take your choice of the two, Hehb, Klotz-Boussel.
Our Volunteers'you kindly invite,
In Paris to make themselves a sight,
In hopes that credit and cash may tell,
On the pride and the purse of a Klotz-Boussel—
Klotz-Roussel, Klotz-Boussel,
What a bright conception of Klotz-Boussel!
When the British Lion is armed to the teeth,
He's asked to put tushes and claws in their sheath,
And with bated breath and bare belts, pell-mell
To follow to Paris a Kloti-Boussel—
Klotz Roussel, Klotz-Roussel,
What a Leader of Lions is Klotz-Roussel!
There's a being in England known as "a snob,"
And a thing in England known as "a job:"
The " snob" we can see, and the "job we may smell,
Combined in this project of Klotz-Roussel—
Klotz-Roussel, Klotz-Roussel,
You may just as well drop it, Hehb Klotz-Boussel.
If e'er our Volunteers should go
To Paris, they won't go there for a show.
Meanwhile for home-use their ranks they swell,
Not to lackey the heels of a Klotz-Boussel—
Klotz-Boussel, Klotz-Boussel,
Paws off the Lion, Hebb Klotz-Boussel!
The old Greeks held there were omens in names,
Some promised successes, some augured shames;
And 'tis odds that the chance of a row and a sell
Both meet in this scheme of Klotz-Boussel—
Klotz-Boussel, Klotz-Roussel,
There's a sound of ill omen in Klotz-Roussel!
I haven't the luck to know who you are,
Accredited thus by the Great Mocquabd:
You may be a tout, for some rail or hotel,
And you may be a tailor, Klotz-Roussel—
Klotz-Roussel, Klotz-Roussel,
But your name rings doubtfully, Klotz-Boussel.
The French and English nations to bring
To I'entente cordiale, were an excellent thing;
But to give us an inch, and give them an ell,
Isn't quite the road to it, Klotz-Boussel—
Klotz-Boussel, Klotz-Boussel.
There's two sides to a Treaty, Klotz-Boussel.
All honour to Gladstone, and Cobden, and Beioht,
That with weapons of peace they prefer to fight;
But there's time for the sword, and the shot and the shell—
Ask Louis Napoleon, Klotz-Roussel—
Klotz-Roussel, Klotz-Roussel,
Steel may oust soft sawder, Kloiz-Roussbl.
John Bull begs leave very humbly to doubt
Whether arming his hands and then holding them out
Be the sort of logic that's likely to tell
On logical France, spite of Klotz-Boussel—
Klotz-Boussel, Klotz-Boussel,
She would call it a " contresetu," Klotz-Boussel.
Leave Ireland to send Volunteers to Rome;
Our Volunteers we'll keep at home,
Nor be lured to Paris by e'en the spell
Of a Mocquabd backing a Ki.otz-Koussel—
Klotz-Roussel, Klotz-Roussel,
Go home to the Tuileries, Klotz-Roussel,
And say, with John Bull's best compliments there,
He's not to be stroked the right way of the hair.
E'en British Asses will scarce don the fell
Of British Lions for Klotz-Roussel—
Klotz-Roussel, Klotz-Roussel,
You had best shut up shop, Herb Klotz-Roussel.

"WITH VERDURE CLAD."
Among other curiosities, we see advertised a sort of "Vegetable
Leather Gaiters," of which a hundred thousand pairs are expected to
be sold in London ere next spring. This announcement has, we own,
sadly puzzled and perplexed us, ana eleven of our hairs have prematurely
been turned grey by it. By what process any vegetable can be made
into a gaiter, is a problem our best powers are unable to resolve. But
supposing it accomplished, there would clearly be advantages which in
certain circumstances might perhaps result from it. For instance, we
have heard of shipwrecked sailors having to subsist upon their boots;
and if they had been supplied with Vegetable Gaiters, they doubtless
would hare relished the addition to their fare. A still more painful
story has moreover reached us, of how a newly-married couple went to
Paris for their honeymoon, and, arriving there at 3 a.m., could get
nothing served for supper, and so, to save themselves from starving,
had to devour their slice of cake. Now if the husband had but worn a
pair of Vegetable Gaiters, they need not have committed this almost
cannibal act. i
We are not informed if Vegetarians use these Gaiters, nor whether
any Vegetable in particular be chosen for their manufacture. This
latter is in some degree a point somewhat important. For instance, if
we purchased our Gaiters of a tailor, it would never do to ask him if
they were made of Cabbage!
The Bourbon and the Black Prince.
We have the best authority for stating, that Francis II., the Ex-
Kino op Naples, has declined, with thanks, the asylum which has
been offered him by the Queen c t Spain and the Emperor oe
Austria. The dethroned monarch wul reside at the Court of a Boyal
brother, where he will feel much more at home than he probably would
even in the Imperial Palace at Vienna. His Majesty has decided on
accepting the hospitality of the Kino of Dahomey.

THE RIGHT LEG IN THE BOOT.
The Boot of Italy may well
Be likened to the shoe
Wherein did that old woman dwell
Who knew not what to do.
Inside that Boot the Pontiff sits
Upon his shaky throne,
And questions, racking his poor wits,
How he shall hold his own.
But other Sovereigns, in that Boot
Did live, besides the Pope;
The Hapsburg, and the Bourbon brute,
Who ruled Dy axe and rope:
And petty Dukes there also were,
That served those tyrants twain,
And sceptres, by their favour, bare
Each o'er his mean domain.
Small space the Pontiff now, indeed.
Doth in that Boot possess;
His subjects being mostly freed:
The Bourbon holdeth less.
The Hapsburg, much against the grain,
Hath place been forced to give;
The petty Dukes no longer reign
Where happy subjects live.
Now may your boot, Italians, get
Soon on the right leg put,
No despot in it holding yet
One portion of his foot:
Soon Hapsburg after Bourbon kick,
A boot all one and whole,
And keep—allowed his bishopric—
The Pope beneath the sole.
DOBLER OUTDONE.
We really think the table-turners, and other conjurors and wizards,
should protest against the tradesmen taking leaves out of their books,
and doing strokes of necromancy on their own account. What with
"Magic Strops," and other marvellous inventions, the apparatus of a
conjuror seems sold at every counter, and feats of legerdemain are now
in nearly everybody's hands. Here, for instance, is a specimen of the
wonders which are worked by advertising tradesmen, who are constantly
attracting notice to some new commercial trick:—
"By merely pouring boiling water Into the inverted lid of Blank's Patent Coffee
Pot, from a pint to a gallon of delicious tea or coffeo may be procured in a few
minutes."
Really, now, this beats the Mysterious Bowls of Gold-Fisb, the
Inexhaustible Bottle, and the. Cup-producing Hat. We have often
seen a conjuror make hot coffee on the stage, but then he has always
had a pigeon or canary-bird to make it with—nay, has sometimes taken
a leaf out of the cookery-books at railway stations, and has easily con-
cocted it from a few handfuls of beans. In the case quoted, however,
the trick is done without the aid of these accessories, the beverage
being brewed by merely pouring boiling water on an inverted lid. No
mention is made of either tea or coffee being put into the coffee-pot,
and yet either of these drinks is producible at will by the mere means
we have stated. Both of them, moreover, are declared to be "delicious,"
a statement of the conjuror which, not being a consumer, we cannot
yet endorse. We think, however, that these coffee-pots, if they do
what is asserted of them, cannot be too widely known; and to guarantee
their being so, we make a note of them in Punch. It may influence the
Government in their dealings with the Chinamen to learn that tea can
now be made without the need of tea-leaves; and surely nobody will
dream of paying money for "Best Mocha," when he can get a pint or
gallon of the most delicious coffee by merely pouring boiling water
upon a bit of tin.

JEWELS OF JOURNALISM.
"To —Punch, Esq.
"Verbena Villa, Monday.
You Dear Old Pet,*
—I am so much obliged
to you for putting in
the letter which I
wrote the other day
about our darling
Prince op Wales,
and how before he left
America he had to kiss,
oh! ever such a lot of
girls by proxy, select-
ing one (of course the
prettiest) to take the
Kisses for the rest j two
dozen 1 think there
were, but the paper
didn't say whether the
Prince kissed her four
and twenty times for
them. Well, his labours
are all over now, and
I'm sure he must be
glad of it, for only
think what he's gone
through, and so young
as he is too, and what
with all bis travelling
and late hours, and
then having to rise
early in order to pack up, he must have fairly neen worn out, and quite glad to get home
again.
"But after all, he must have had a most delightful time of it. Only fancy how delicious to
have dancing every night almost, and always with fresh partners! I declare it's a great
shame there were no ladies in his suite. They would so much have enjoyed themselves. And
how nice it would have been to be mentioned in the newspapers, ana publicly be compli-
mented for one's personal appearance, as is the fashion in America, it seems in high society.
At least one judges this is so from the account the New York Herald gives of one of the
American Nights' Entertainments which were lately got up to amuse their English visitors.
The Herald thus describes a few of the 'radiant multitude' for the purpose of 'conveying
an idea of the general unanimity of the picture :'—
Miss Charlotte Couhino wore a laco dress with autumn leaves embroidered over tulle skirt. A scarf
of green loaves ctraploted an effective tout enftmble, and a row of pearls found a fitting resting place around a
bead of glossy black hair.
"Miss Mary Clapp, a favourito of the ovonlng, wore lace over white silk, looped up with natural flowers.
Very pretty.
"Mrs. John- Schgrmkrrorn looked a sort of incarnation of tho Adriatic with the Doge of Venice. [Oh, my
goodness me I how nice she niust have looked 1 How I leUth I had her photograph 1J
"Mrs. Stratestinqui wore a beautiful lace loopei up with flowers, looking every inch a bride.
"Miss Ellkn Rbkd wore a stmnlo pink cloud of crape, and, almost without a single ornament, was a
specimen of cottago simplicity calculated to do an immense amount of damage."
"There, now! isn't that delicious! I declare I feel quite jealous! Only think how nice,
after going to a ball, to find one was considered to 'look every inch a bride,' or that some
reporter thought one 'very pretty!' As of course one would not know whether one had
ready been 'the favourite of the evening,' how delightful it would be on awakening the
next morning to find oneself so famous! What a pity it is our papers are so stupidly
reserved, and withhold such pleasant news from us. Just conceive with what delight a
debutante at Almack's would discover that Bell's Life considered her a 'specimen of cottage
simplicity,' and how it would charm Mamma the Countess to learn that it was stated by the
'Titer or the Telegraph that, to their idea, her Ellen was 'calculated to do an immense
amount of damage.'
"Equally delightful it would be to our beau monde to find their manners and demeanour
criticised as freely as their personal appearance. If American reporters had access to our
ball-rooms, I suppose that some such stuff as that which follows would be written of us:—
H At first a slight degree of bashfulness was apparent on tho part of the young people of both sexes; but
as the batl progressed tfiis gradually wore off. and the officers to thoir no small satisfaction had the pleasure
of d in sin r with any lady in the room on whom they chose to fasten an inclination. ■ * English formality
aud restraint gave way before the winsome manners of the young divinities, and the ball rolled on to the
accompaniment of pleasant conversation, coquettish hallucinations, good music, plenty of room to dauce in,
plenty of handsome partners and every other adjunct calculated to mako one iu suoh a place contented with
himself and neighbours."
"'Pleuty of room to dance in!' Well, I do think we might copy our Yankee cousins in
this respect; although we might not care to specify anions the other benefits of having a
big ball-room, that 'there were no crushed corns to rise like agonised Ohosts of Banquo'
from it.
"But there was something else besides the 'winsome manners of the young divinities'
which helped to dissipate the English 'formalities' and coldness :—
"An admlrublo feature of the evening was a coffee-room, whore the thirsty and weary could retire at any
time, and without inconvenience inhale the rising incense of his Java. For the accommodation of the officers a
* We have no objection to bo called a Pet, but we must protest against the epithet preceding. Old, indeed,

private room was set apart for them under tho stage,
where had been rolled in a cask of alo and several quarts
of oysters, of which the English are very fond. This was
called 'John Bull's Saloon.' In a word, every possible
effort was made by the committee to render this portion
of the entertainment especially complete, and it is need-
less to say, that their endeavours to 'crowd the storaaoh
with thrifty tare' met with the most complete success."
"'Sine Bacco friget Venus' cried my cousin
Charley to me upon reading this, and as he said
it with a chuckle, of course 1 tried to laugh,
although I own I don't a bit know what he
meant by it. I suppose the smoking-room was
set apart for the use of the Americans, as of
course an English gentleman would never dream
of 'inhaling the incense of his Java' when he is
going to enjoy the society of ladies. And what
does the reporter mean by hinting the suspicion
that an Englishman can't dance without the
help of beer and oysters? If I thought my
cousin Charley needed such inducements to
make him waltz or polk with me, I declare, I
really think I'd never dance with him again I!
At least, unless he begged my pardon prettily
and vowed—But never mind all that: here's
something much more interesting to you than
Cousin Charley can be:—
"Whilst it is true that there were none who looked like
some of the women at the New York ball, as if they had
Just omergod from a diamond ahowor-bath, there was a
display or jewels and jewellery that bespoke tho good
taste and good sense of tho wearer. Portland ladies are
celebrated for their boauty and refinement, however,
more than for any mere display of dress, and tho gather-
ing on Wodncsday in this respect was sufficient to have
constituted an aurora. * * Ouo of the principal officers,
a dashing young lieutenant, mado tho remark that he had
seen more real genuino undiluted loveliness in the s^iace
of half an acre, and d'irtnv/ hall an hour, than he had
looked upon since he left the Old Country. He really
thought American ladies wore remarkably 'arnsome.'
A few minutes after this he was up to his elbows in
compliments, melting away imder the delicious fascina-
tions of a terrestrial angef in blue—a process ho went
through uo less than a dozen times in the course of tho
evening."
"Fancy now the gathering in a ball-room
'constituting an aurora.' What poets penny-a-
liners must be in America! Does that darling
Longfellow, I wonder, write for newspapers F
And how true to life it is to represent a British
officer as speaking of half acres of 'undiluted
loveliness,' and saying of his partners that he
thought them vastly arnsome!' Well, it cer-
tainly is a pity our reporters, like our dancers,
are so reserved and formal; I fear that we shall
have to wait a good long while before we find the
Times announcing to the world the fascinations
of Miss Smith, or reporting the flirtations which
go on in London ball-rooms.
"Yours, dear Mr. Punch,
"With the very warmest interest,
"Amelia Angelica Angelina Agnes Ann."
"PS. How does a man look when he is
'melting away' and 'up to his elbows in com-
pliments P' Because, if it improves his looks, I
shall get Charley to practise it."
Political Ingratitude.
The Conservatives find many kind things to
say in favour of Lord Palmerston, but not a
single flattering word do they ever say in honour
of poor Disraeli. We call this base ingratitude,
though Dis is quite strong enough to dispense
with their flattery. But really from the compli-
mentary way in which the Conservatives talk,
any stranger would naturally conclude that
Palmerston was their leader, and not Disraeli,
UNFOUNDED CALUMNY.
There is not the smallest truth in the rumour
that Mr. Sheridan Knowles has been appointed
"Professor of Allocution" to the Pops. Every
one, who hears it mentioned, is requested to
contradict it.

YOUNG SWELLS TEMP. FDWARD THK FOURTIt.
FROM AN ELABORATE WOOD-ENORAY1NO OF THK
PERIOD.
CHAPTER XXXVI.—OF THE REIGN OF EDWARD THE
FOURTH.
ow absurd were certain ol'
the costumes of this period,
the pencil of our artist will
show better than our pen.
By the drawing which we
use as an initial to this chap-
ter, and which is accurately
copied from a very rare old
manuscript,* it will be seen
what pains the dandies took
In make themselves ridicu-
lous, and how eminent ly some
of them succeeded in so
doing. Swells with spindle-
shankylegs appeared to take
delight in exposing their de-
formities, and made them
still more ludicrous by con-
trast with their upper gar-
ments, which were swollen
and puffed out to a prepos-
terous degree. Special no-
tice also should be taken of
their hats: some of which,
as in this drawing, were tall
sugar-loafy structures not
unlike a modern foolscap,
while others looked like
slop-basins with a peacock's
feather in them.
One would think that such
absurdities were hardly worth
the while of grave historians
to chronicle, but Monstre-
i.kt dilates at no slight length
upon the subject, as does
Pakadin likewise, in his Histoire de Lyons, which Cox db Finsbury
conceives to be a work of natural history, and only to bear reference to
the king of all the beasts. Among other information supplied us by
these writers, we learn, that doublets were cut short, as our artist has
depicted them, and that the sleeves of them were slit so as to show
large loose white shirts. They were padded in the shoulder with large
waddings called "maboilres:" T and were worn of silk, of satin, and
of velvet, even by mere boys. The beaux, however, and perhaps the
boys, were as capricious as spoilt children in their tastes and fancies;
and after coming out one day in the shortest of short jackets, the
next would, like great babies, go about in long clothes, "soe long
in soothe att times that they dya dangle in y* dirt."
Such of our readers as have Deen to public schools will have derived
at least this benefit from their classic education, namely that they will
not need us to translate the well-known line:—
"Dam vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt."
Of course we would not be so cruel as to call a swell a fool; but, with
a softening of the " stulti," the verse was clearly applicable to dandies
at this period, and we wonder the old writers, fond as they were of
Latin, should not have applied it. Besides their weathercocky ways
in the fashion of their coats, the gentlemen of England who lived in
Edward's reign, veered about as changeably in the shaping of their
shoes. On Monday you would meet a swell strutting a-down Chepe
with pointed toes, which were called poulaines, a quarter of an ell long;
and on Tuesday you might see him sunning himself idly in the gardens
of the Temple, having his feet stuck into a sort of shoes termed duck-
bills, which had a kind of beak-like projection at the toe, some five
fingers in length. Before the week was out, if you chanced to come
"This drawing is noteworthy as being one of the first specimens of the noble art
of wood-cutting with which our English literature (the Book of Costumes not
excepted) has been so much enriched. Dr. Dibdin says tho art "began to prevail
about tho year 1460," t.«., tho yoar before the reign of Edward the Fourth. Doubt-
less the drawings which illuminate this chapter, and which are all taken from the
artists of the period, will remind the thoughtful reader of the lines in the Excursion,
where Wordsworth speaks of these same •' wooden cuts :"—
"Strange and uncouth : dire facca, figures dire.
Sharp-kneed, sharp-elbowed, and lean-ancled too,
With long and ghostly shanks: forma which once seen
Can never bo forgotteu."
I This luxury, however, was only for the higher classes. By the sumptuary
statute which was passed during this reign, " no yeoman, or person under a yeoman,"
was allowed bolsters or stuffing of woo), cotton or cadis in his pourpoint or doublet,
under a penalty of a six and eightpence fine and forfeiture to somebody of the
offending garment.

envelopes, and carrying bis absurdity to fully as great widths as he had
previously done lengths. Slippers, we are told, were made "so very

broad in front as to exceed the measure of a good foot," but whether
they were worn to hide the measure of a bad one, the chronicler is not
so rude here as to hint.
If history be believed, our fourth Edward had not much to recom-
mend him to posterity. One writer (does the reader recollect the
name of EgertonP) speaks of him as being—
"To each voluptuous vice a slave,
Cruel, intemperate, vain, suspicious, brave."
But of this long string of epithets, the only one we need to say a
word on is the third. Vanity being one of the chief failings of the
sovereign, it may be fancied that his courtiers followed his example,
and were unchecked in their preposterous pomps and vanities of dress.
It is true an Act of Parliament was passed for their prevention; and
popular opinion, speaking through the mouths of the street-boys of the
period, was doubtless prone to treat with levity the very heavy swells.
But neither statutory laws nor the chaffing of the streets have ever
much effect to mitigate the dandyism of the day; and although it was
provided that "no one under a lord" should make a fool of himself by
wearing a short jacket and long shoes, and that every tradesman manu-
facturing such articles should be fined a sovereign (and be cursed by
clergy for the shoemaking offence), we will be bound to say short
jackets and long shoes still were made, and that other fools than lords
were found to wear them.
By this sumptuary statute, which was passed in the third year of
the reign of Edward the Fourth, bachelor knights were forbidden to
wear cloth of velvet upon velvet, unless they were Knights of the
Garter. This is the first tax upon bachelors recorded in our History;
and as the mania for finery appears to be reviving, it might not be
unwise to reimpose some such a hindrance on it. There really is no
saying how it mi^ht affect the Census, if single swells were now pro-
hibited from wearing porkpie hats and pegtops, and a dozen other
things which we have no space here to schedule.
Unbecomingly cropped heads, and closely-shaven chins and cheeks,
had been in fashion during the three last preceding reigns; but fops
now wore their hair "so long that it dyd come into their eyes, and
wits dyd say they looked like members of y* hairy-stocracie." Beards,
whiskers, and moustaches were, however, still discountenanced, for the
ladies, it was said, did set their face against them.
But little change took place now in the military equipment. A
modern writer says, that it "presents few striking novelties," and
indeed the only novel weapons for striking that present themselves
are the genetaire, or janetaire, a sort of Spanish lance, the voulge,
which varied slight ly from the old glaive or guisarme, and the halbert
(now first mentioned), whose name doubtless was derived from the
earliest kind of poleaxe, which the Germans, and perhaps the Poles,
called alle-barde, or cleave-all. Swords and bucklers were first given
to archers at this time; for although, like our Riflemen, these soldiers
were intended to fight chiefly at long ranges, it was found that they
were sometimes forced to battle hand to hand, and then a sword ana
shield were sure to come in handy.
We have said the Civil Swells were somewhat heavy at this period;
but the Knights, when in full fig, were even yet more ponderous.
Enormous globular breastplates were worn upon the chest, and the
feet were strongly shielded by sollerets of steel, whose long points are

tected with their metal casing. That Royal wit, Kino James tiie

First, is said to have remarked of the armour of this era, that "it
canna be denied it was an ower gude inveention, as it heendered a puir
body frae being hurt himsel', or hurting ither people, by reason of
its clumsiness.
This in some measure explains the marvels which we read, ot how
knights battered one another, like Hotspur and Jack Falstaf, by
the three hours together, without doing much more damage than just
to make their noses bleed. This however was providing that they
could keep their seats, for when once a knight came down it was
literally all up with him. The mere shock of his fall was quite enough
in general to knock him out of time; and as he could not anyhow get
up without assistance, his conqueror could coolly choose the best chink
in the armour to give the coup de grace. It was for this reason perhaps
that the horses were now armed almost as heavily as their riders,
having shields upon their chests and manefaires upon their manes,
while a strong plate called the clianfron gave protection to the face.
This plate bad a sharp boss, or point, projecting from the. forehead,
and a plume by way of ornament sprouting up between the ears, in
the manner of the cherry-tree upon the stag shot by Munchausen.
The saddle too was made of a peculiar construction, projecting round
the thigh so as to hold bad riders firmly to their seats. A splendid
specimen of this is shown in a quaint drawing in one of the Harleian
manuscripts, where the steed is represented rather bigger than a dray-
horse, and having a cropped mane and absurdly short bob-tail, which
we presume to have been according to the fashion of the time. This
presumption is supported by one of those old lyrics which antiquarians
have had to thank us for unearthing, and which with the quaint plea-
santry belonging to this period, relates in sixty stanzas how J* gentil
knight Syr Doodah—
"33nB go to Epsome to&mt,

Quite the Reverse.
Count Casella, the Minister of Francis tiie Second, the small
German potentates, and all the other minor fry of Despotism, are in
horror at the audacity of Victor Emmanuel, in coming to the rescue
of the Two Sicilies, and denounce his conduct as a violation of what
they call the "Jus Gentium."
They omit a syllable. What Victor Emmanuel has trampled under
foot—and all honour to him for it—is the "Jus Regentium' which in
despotisms, so far from being identical with the "Jus Gentium" is
precisely the reverse. In the name of " the right of nations," he over-
bears "the right divine of Kings to govern wrong."
GUILDHALL AS IT SHOULD BE.
A Sadly inaccurate description of the decorations at Guildhall for
the Lord Mayor's Feast last week having crept into the pipers,
Mr. Punch has been requested for the interest of the publio to furnish
what on Derby-days is known as a " c'rect list":—
The Lobbies.—These being the entrance-chambers leading to the
Banquet Hall, were appropriately embellished with trophies apper-
taining to the culinary art. Stewpans, Bpits, and saucepots were
clustered at each corner, flanked by frying-pans and gridirons, and
surmounted by a banner with the Arms (bared) of the Chief Cook.
The walls, instead of being whitewashed, were delicately floured, and
festooned with turnip roses and camellias cut from beet-root. In the
centre of each panel was au elegant medallion, carved to represent the
top of a raised pie. This formed a fitting background for the Statue
of the Chef, moulded from a portrait drawn by Cojk, R. A., aud showing
that great personage in his robes of office, consisting of an apron and a
white cotton cap. The Chef is represented in a graceful classic atti-
tude, bearing in one hand a beautiful bouquet of parsley, sage,and onions,
and in the other brandishing a rolling-pin, after the manner of a Field-
Marshal with his baton. Underneath this figure was inscribed in hard-
boiled whites of egg the suitable quotation.from Comus (slightly altered):
« Two blissful things la horo are Dome.
Good soup, good most, the Cook hath sworn 1
The Great Hall.—Here, as every Alderman knows, the Feast of St.
Lord Mayor is annually served, and the embellishments were strictly
in accordance with that fact Garlands of knives and forks, joined in
happy union, were suspended from the ceiling and glittered in the gas;
while all the statues in the Hall were draped with table-cloths and
napkins, which served to give a chaste and classical effect. The
Eastern window was adorned with a finely-painted allegory, representing
the combined forces of Common Councilmen and Livery preparing to
defend the Good Dinners of the City, and other ancient privileges
which they and their forefathers have so copiously enjoyed. Over the
chair of state were the portraits (size of life) of the Lord and Lady
Mayoress, each with a large plate of steaming turtle-soup before
them, and underneath, the civic motto :—
Happy, happy, happy Ma von.
None but the brave deserves tho Fare!"
Aldermen's Committee Boom.—Statues chiefly modern, embellished
this apartment, and as the figures mostly were modelled from live
aldermen, it is unnecessary to say that they were of great elegance.
A classic group of Helioqobbleus (the first of ancient Aldermen),
attired by the Graces, very naturally excited an immense deal of atten-
tion: as did a statuette representing Epicurus in the act of carving his
first haunch of venison. Appropriate mottoes were inscribed in gold
letters on the walls, one being a neat paraphrase of a well-known old
school couplet:—
"In guttling Turtle every day,
Let my first course be passed:
And let me hope my relish may
E'en for three pUtefuls last 1 **
Loggia of the Exchequer Court.—The decorations here were of a
severer style. The walls were draped with the paid bills of all the
Lord Mayors' Banquets for the last four hundred years, and on a black
board in the centre of each of the four walls was inscribed the exact
sum total of the money thus consumed. How many millions have been
guzzled aud gormandised away Rince the Cit of Richard Whittino-
ton lapped up her first ha'porth at the expense of City Coal-tax-paycrs,
we leave Economy to groan for and Posterity to guess.
THE TWO KINGS AT TEANO. October 25, 1860.
Victor and Garibaldi, side by side—
The crowned King and the crownless,—hand in hand,
'Neath the blue sky of their regenerate land.
Silent, mid shouting thousands, Lo, they ride!
Not many royal hands so pure of guilt,
As to be laid within that stainless palm,
Homy with grasp of the familiar hilt;
Not many royal looks could brave the calm
Of those deep-seated and unwavering eyes,
Fearful or terrible, as ruth or war
Subdues or lights them. Ride on, to the cries
Of "Long live Italy!" while, near and far,
All good men's hopes bless thine investiture,
Honest King-maker, of an honest King,
And pray thy work may stand, till rcoted sure,
In spite of friends that as the ivy cling.
Stifling with wintry green, that shows like spring.
Ride on, Victor Emmanuel, to the throne
From which crowned wickedness hath toppled do wn,
While Garibaldi, guerdonless, alone.
Takes his far higher throne, and nobler crown!

A RISE IN BREAD-STUFFS I-EFFECTS OF EATING AERATED BREAD.
Poor Cocker having been Recommended to try the " Aerated Bread," does so, and is Discovered, along with his Family, Floating about the Ceiling
of his Parlour, in an utterly Helpless Condition.
A CANON AND A BLUNDERBUSS.
The Irish Brigade, having returned from those plains of Italy which,
according to Cullen, they miraculously purpled with a very small
quantity of blood in the unsuccessful attempt to subjugate Italians to
despotism, arrived the other day at Dublin, where, amid the cheers of
a multitude impatient of the galling yoke of Constitutional Government,
they were harangued by the Rev. Canon Pope, who, according to a
newspaper ironically named the Freeman, " came forward to address the
young men of the Brigade, and to welcome them home in the name of
religion and of their country." The Reverend Canon then discharged
himself of a tremendous load of unspeakable bombast, but bis can-
nonade comprised one particular bang, the report of which deserves to
reverberate. Having told his hearers that they had done all manner of
the finest possible things for their "Holy Father " (the Canon's name-
sake), their "Holy Mother the Church," and the "Great Catholic
family of Christendom," he wound up a prodigious period of balder-
dash with the following portentous climax of bosh:—
"And In the blood of your fallen brave one* you have offered up a holocaust on
the altar of rollgion to the Great God of battles.■
This thundering explosion of pompous untruth created, according to
the Freeman, "profound sensation." No doubt.4 The sublimity of
solecism was likely to overwhelm the imagination of a crazy rabble.
Of course Canon Pope cannot know that a holocaust is a victim burnt
entire. If be had been acquainted with that fragment of etymology,
he would hardly have told even an Irish Brigade that tbey had offered
up a holocaust in the blood of their fallen brave. If those heroes had
caught Cialdini, or Fanti, and roasted their victim whole, then there
would have been some sense, at least, in congratulating them on having
offered up a holocaust on the altar of religion—religion of a peculiar
kind—to the Great God of battles—a deity whose worship demands
human sacrifices. Tbe less a Popish priest talks about holocausts the
better, even when he does not talk nonsense. A certain artist of
antiquity—a villanous flunkey—wishing to curry favour with a tyrant,
constructed a bull of brass, and presented it to that potentate, for the
purpose of enabling him to perform holocausts in its interior, by burn-
ing people alive there, in the meanwhile enjoying the pleasure of
hearing them bellow. The bull of Pebillus was more savage than
tbat of Canon Pope, and besides, Pebillus's bull contained the holo-
caust, whereas Canon Pope's holocaust involves his bull. This bull
will not make quite the same noise as what may be supposed to have
proceeded from the other one; but the Irish priest, as well as the
Athenian sculptor, must be admitted to have made a roaring bull.
Phalabis, as our youth are aware, rewarded the ingenuity and devotion
of Pebillus, by putting him forthwith into the toy which he had
fabricated to afford his patron amusement at the expense of others, and
playing, by way of experiment, in the first instance with himself. The
cruel ingratitude of the Tyrant of Agrigentum will not be imitated by
the Roman Pontiff, and Pio Nono at least will not command Canon
Pope to be roasted for his own holocaust.
The Englishman in Prussia.
In confirmation of a statement respecting Prussian custom-house
extortion, which appeared in tbe Times under the head of " Prussian
Insolence," a correspondent of the same journal, signing himself
"A Travelleb," declares that somewhere in Prussia he was made to
pay 5{d. duty on 1J lb. of children's ordinary biscuits, which the official
who inspected his luggage asserted to be sweetmeats. The customs of
the Prussians appear to be as bad as their manners.
VERY IIEAVY ORDNANCE.
According to a calculation which has appeared in the Mechanics'
Magazine, our Armstrong guns, of which we possess 451, have cost the
country no less than £2,000 a-piece. Truly the Armstrong gun is a
tremendous weapon. We ought to be able to knock La Gloire into
atoms with our two-thousand-pounders.

LECTURE OF A NEW LORD MAYOR.
At the Court of Aldermen held on the 14th instant at Guildhall,
when the Lord Mayor presided for the first time in his official
capacity, according to the newspapers:—
"His Lordship at the commencement of the proceedings rose and said. 'In
taking my place in this Court for the first time as Lord Mayor of the City of London,
I cannot fail to feol that I am entering on a post of great honour and dignity, ana
that 1 shall often have occasion to entreat the kind consideration of my brethren of
the Court of Aldermen. I feel, however, great confidence in being able to perform
the duties that will devolve upon me, because I know that I may at all times appeal
to my brother Aldermen for the assistance nf their experience and wisdom, and I
have no doubt that with such assistance I shall be able to go through my duties in
a manner that will be satisfactory to my brother-citizens, and at the same time
fully support tho dignity and privileges of the Court."
Evidently the above is an incorreot report of the Lord Mayor's
observations. The speech which his Lordship really did make was
most probably one of this sort:—In making my appearance in this
Court for the first time as Lord Mayor of the City of London, I pain-
fully feel that I am exhibiting myself in a character which will be too
generally deemed ridiculous. So many of my predecessors in office
have.principally distinguished themselves by their folly, that in attiring
myself in these robes, and putting on this chain, and taking my seat in
this chair, I know that I am exposing myself to inevitable derision.
Hoping, however, to contribute as little as possible to the public
amusement, I trust that my brethren of the Court of Aldermen will
excuse me if I occasionally deviate from a precedent which would
require me to make a fool of myself. I entertain some hope that I
may manage to perform the duties which will devolve upon me
without incurring very much ridicule, because I have determined to
pay no attention to any nonsense which may be uttered by my brother
Aldermen, and not to allow their advice or opinions to influence me at
all contrarily to my own judgment, in the discharge of my office. As a
member of the Legislature, accustomed to participate in the delibe-
rations of an orderly and decorous assembly, 1 trust I shall be enabled
to preside over you with that propriety of which the Speaker of the
House of Commons has afforded me an example, and thus, whilst sup-
porting the privileges, very considerably elevate the dignity, of this
Court. Now then, Gentlemen, silence if you please; let us proceed to
business, and let me entreat all of you to keep your tempers.
AN UNDUTLFUL PAPA.
Cardinal Antonelli has given Cardinal Wiseman the office to
collect Peter's Pence for the Pope, and Cardinal Wiseman has
ordered his clergy to levy the desired contribution. Among the pur-
poses for which his Holiness solicits a "whip" are "the requirements
of his army." Now, that the Pope's hat should go round among his
faithful disciples simply to collect the means of paying the expenses of
their faith, is all very well; and to that end they may reasonably be
invited to drop their coppers into the tiara; but do they believe in the
Papal Army P That is a new dogma indeed, and transcends all con-
ceivable conception.
The truth is, that Pius Papa is a very fast old gentleman; an extra-
vagant papa: a regular pere prodigue. He has been outrunning the
constable in keeping a standing army, if that army can be called
standing which has particularly distinguished itself by running away.
Papa should in all conscience have put down his expensive military
establishment before he proceeded to ask for pecuniary assistance at
the hands of his children.
An Unexpected Return.
We thought that the principle of *' No Money Returned" app
to Royal, just the same as to Theatrical houses. However, we have
stumbled over an exception. The Kino of Saxony has returned
to the Chambers the extraordinary sums which they voted last year,
not having any occasion for them. We wonder when we shall see any-
thing of so pleasing and acceptable a nature ever figure amongst our
"Government Returns?"

WHO STARTED THE FIRST RIFLE CORPS?
01 to use a stronger adjective,
a most unseemly squabble
lias been going on in print
as to who first set on foot
the Volunteer Movement.
At least a score of indi-
viduals, not to use a stronger
substantive, have severally
claimed the sole right to be
called the Benefactor to their
country, in so far as the origi-
nating of Rifle practice is
concerned. Now, without
wishing to make rows, or in
any way detract from any
one's pretensions, Captain
Punch begs leave to hint in
the mildest manner possible,
that, everybody living (in-
cluding Ma. Smith and the
Emieror of China) is very
well aware that it was Cap-
tain Punch who got up the
first Rifle Corps ever formed
in England, and thereby gave
the start to this world-ex-
citing movement. Any stupid
sceptic who dares to doubt
this fact, is advised hereby to
purchase Captain Punch's fourteenth volume; where, at page 85, in
the Number which was published for March 5, 1848, is an article ad-
dressed to "Spirited Young Men," who were desired to join forthwith
an "Invincible Rifle Corps, to be known as the Punch Rifles." This
Corps was gazetted at Captain Punch's private Horse Guards in the
ensuing week, and was by several years the first of all the corps which
have been started, and may be viewed as being the mainspring from
which the movement sprung.
Captain Punch, whose modesty is as well known as his valour, would
not have adverted to these historic facts, but for his anxiety to end the
squabbling aforementioned, which is setting by the ears men who ought
to be good friends, as they are good fellows, and who should know
better than engage in an uncivil war, even although happily it be
merely a verbal one.
GIANT POPE BITES HIS NAILS.
translation (verified) of a holograph letter from cardinal
anton elli, the popi's minister, to a brother cardinal on his
involuntart travels.
"Alas, mt Brother, the Church suffers great' discouragement in
these evil days, her hands are fettered and her enemies compass her
round about. The dungeons ia which she was wont to immure the
wicked for the good of their souls, are emptied of their human tenants
and thrown open to the gaze of the profane and to the glasses of the pho-
tographer; her instruments of chastisement are hung up in museums,
and the machinery of her miracles is sold to the exhibitor of the
Fantoccini. We have fallen upon bad days, and I see no silver lining
to the clouds that frown around the chair of St. Peter. Ora pro nobis!
"Yet, O my brother, the Church of Rome is not wholly abandoned.
Persecuted as she is iu the Old World, she can yet vindicate in the
New her right to be the directress and governess of mankind. There
she is still permitted to show what she would do everywhere if she
could, there her missionary zeal is unchecked, there is nobly realised
the beatific vision of the divine Montalembert, 'a free church in a
free state,' that is to say, a state which desires no freedom but that of
religion. With humble but hearty joy 1 subduct from one of the
accursed journals of England (one bearing the name of the blasphemous
wire that seeks to annihilate the distances fixed by Providence between
man and man), the following gracious and glorious news from
Mexico.
"I alter not the ribald words of the writer, for they do but show his
profane rage at Ecclesia's triumphs:—
"At ■ representation which took place at one of the thoatros of this city, Mira-
hok, the elected of the Church faction, and his wife being present, an appeal was
made in the piece to a monarch to grant his subjects the blessings of peace. A poor
mechanic, thinking the occasion a favourable one, arose, and, in a most pathetic
appeal, addrossed Miramon and hie wife, and requested them to put a term to the
miseries of his starring countrymen by according to Mexico a like favour. The
unfortunate supplicant was, by order of tho President, dragged out of the theatre,
conveyed to prison, and sentenced to receivo &00 lashes at daybreak the following
morning. When 850 bad beeu administered, Miramok was informed that tho man
was dying. 'Let tho remaiudor,' he said, 'be given on tho dead body; my orders
must bo carried out.'"
"Blessed be noble Miramon, and blessed ibe his wife, a true and
devoted Catholic, who—
On no single oocosion has been known to Intercede on behalf of any unfortunate
victim, but, on tho contrary, has ever hounded her husband on." .
"Good and devout woman! For her t he prayers of Rome shall not
be wanting. But here is another of the vigorous deeds of the Lamo-
riciere of Mexico, the Champion of the Church:—
"An unlucky peasant having been taken by the pressgang to serve as a
and conveyed to some barracks within the preoincta of the palace, his wife went to
see him. and, with the view of enabling him to escape, took with her female attiro
with which to disguise him. The man and his wife were both seized, and thrco
hundred loshos administered to each. The former survived, but the poor woman,
after giving birth to a still-born child, was conveyed to tho hospital, where aho
shortly after died .n the most excruciating agonies."
"May these tortures be beneficial to the soul of the wicked creature,
who sought to take away her husband from the duties which he owed
to the army of the .Church. But these punishments are instances of
the devotion with which her lay children in. Mexieo serve her. now let
us read, O my brother, and read with pious sorrow, that our lot is so
different, how the clerical servants of Ecclesia serve her in the happy
land of .Mexico in which the spirits of its first noble Spanish con-
querors seem again warring for the faith :—
"The above cases bear but on infinitely small proportion to the atrocities that ars
being dally committed by the Clerical Assassins. The murders ol prisoners, sick
and woundod, cease to attract attention, so common are they. It was only tho
other day that Vicario, one of the sons of the Church, killed in cold blood 400
'plutos,' or southern men, who surrendered to him. Losaoo, another sou of the
Church, skinned the soles of his prisoners' feet and made them danco upon sharp
stones. Mirahon's brother is said to have burnt two of his prisoners alive, and
certain it is that he assassinated a father for endeavouring to save his own daughter
• •••*», In faot, volumes would not suffice to rocouat the deeds of horror
that have boen committed by the Holy Church faction since they came to power,
and every one shudders to think that these deeds are done at the instigation of the
ministers of religion."
"So write these blinded heretics, my brother, of that which they
understand not, but we will take their evidence, though we repudiate
their profane reasoning. Let us, my brother, join iu petitions to S. S.
Moloch and Herod, that the hands of our brethren in Mexico, lay and
clerical, may be strengthened for the good work. We have done what
we could, as Perugia and Naples, and a hundred other places can testify,
but the sons of Zeruiah have been too strong for us, and the demon
Liberty rides Irampant through the temples of Zion. But our hearts
are with our Mexican brethren, what they do in majorem Dei gloriam
we would do if we could, and though now Revolution rejoiceth that
she hath tied our hands, they may yet be loosed, when, O Mexico, thy
divine example shall be remembered.
"Till when, O my brother, your prayers.
"Thine, in the above named Saints,

A HANSOM FAKE.
The Empress of the French in a "common street cab "! What
a shock to Snobbesses who think it "not genteel" to ride in one!
What a lifting up of hands must there have been among fine ladies
when their husbands called their notice to this startling Court intelli-
gence! What shrieks of "Did you ever.1"' from their feminine
acquaintances who think it vulgar to read newspapers, on being made
acquainted with the appalling fact I
Well, after this we hope that we shall hear of no more nonsense
being talked to struggling husbands who can't afford a carriage, about
ladies losing caste by being seen in common cabs. At, any rate, when
Angelina hints at her reluctance to enter such a vehicle, Edwin may
without fear of 8nt Cresswell Cresswell make reply, "My pet!
The Empress Eugenie once rode in a street-cab, and what an Empress,
love, has done, surely, sweetest, you may do!" Indeed, seeing how
the Empress has always led the ladies' fashions, it would not much
surprise us if soon it became vulgar to -ide in private carriages, and if
our fine ladies paid their calls and did their shopping in a "common cab."
Is it known, we wonder, whether the street vehicle in which the
Empress rode was a Hansom, or four-wheeler P As the fact is now
historical, that Eugenie did take a cab, it ought to be recorded what
sort of one she took. We half incline ourselves to guess it was a
Hansom, and we think whoever drove her certainly had never a more
handsome fare. Clearly he, in future, ought to charge a double mileage,
for his vehicle has now obtained a place in history, and something
extra surely should be charged for riding in it. Indeed, we think it
would pay well to make a public exhibition of it. We are confident
that thousands would pay a willing shilling for the privilege of seeing
where an Empress once has sat, and a shilling more to be allowed
themselves to sit there. Yes; Punch gives all honour to his pet, the
Empress; and of all his Court acquaintances, proclaims her la plus
taillante, as well as la plus belle. The Triumphal Car of Caesar will
henceforth stand in the Bame rank as Eugenie's Triumphal Cab; the
Cab wherein she rode over the shams of false gentility, and bravely
triumphed over the mock rules of etiquette.

Ashes to Ashes! Lay the hero down
Within the grey old Abbey's glorious shade.
In our Walhftlla ne'er was worthier laid,
Since Martyr first won palm, or Yictor crown.
'Tis well the State he served no farthing pays
To grace with pomp and honour all too late
His grave, whom, living, Statesmen dogged with hate,
Denying justice, and withholding praise.
Let England hide her face above his tomb,
As much for shame as sorrow. Let her think
Upon the bitter cup he had to drink—
Heroic soul, branded with felon's doom.
A. Sea-King, whose fit place had been by Blake,
Or our own Nelson, had he been but free
To follow glory's quest upon the sea,
Leading the conquered navies in his wake—
A Captain, whom it had been ours to cheer
From conquest on to conquest, had our land
But set its wisest, worthiest in command,
Not such as hated all the good revere.
We let them cage the Lion while the fire
In his high heart burnt clear and unsubdued;
We let them stir that frank and forward mood
From greatness to the self-consuming ire,
The fret and chafe that wait on service scorned,
Justice denied, and truth to silence driven;
From men we left him to appeal to Heaven,
'Gainst fraud set high, and evidence suborned—
We left him, with bound arms, to mark the sword,
Given to weak hands: left him, with working brain,
To see rogues traffic, and fools rashly reign,
Where Strength should have been guide, and Honour lord-
Left him to cry aloud, without support,
Against the creeping things that eat away
Our wooden walls, and boast as they betray,
The base supporters of a baser Court,
The crawling worms that in corruption breed,
And on corruption batten, till at last
Mistaken honour the proud victim cast
Out to their spite, to writhe and pant and bleed
Under their stings and slime; and bleed he did
For years, till hope into heart-sickness grew,
And he sought other seas and service new,
And his bright sword in alien laurels hid.
Nor even so found gratitude, but came
Back to his England, bankrupt, save of praise,
To eat his heart, through weary wishful days,
And shape his strength to bearing of his shame.
Till, slow but sure, drew on a better time,
And statesmen owned the check of public will;
And, at the last, light pierced the shadow chill
That fouled his honour with the taint of crime.
And then they gave him back the Knightly spurs
Which he had never forfeited—the rank
From which he ne'er by ill-deserving sank,
More than the Lion sinks for yelp of curs.
Justice had lingered on its road too long:
The Lion was grown old; the time gone by,
When for his aid we vainly raised a cry,
To save our flag from shame, our decks from wrong.
The infamy is their), whose evil deed
Is past undoing; yet'not guiltless we,
Who, penniless that brave old man could see,
Bestored to honour, but denied its meed.
A Belisarius, old and sad and poor,
To our shame not to hit—so he lived on,
Till man's allotted four-score years were gone,
And scarcely then had leave to 'stablish sure
Proofs of hit innocence, and of their shame,
That had so wronged him; and, this done, came death,
To seal the assurance of his dying breath,
And wipe the last faint tarnish from his name.
At last his fame stands fair, and full of years
He seeks that judgment which his wrongers all
Have sought before him—and above his pall
His flag, replaced at length, waves with his peers'.
He did not live to see it, but he knew
His country with one voice had set it high;
And knowing this he was content to die,
And leave to gracious Heaven what might ensue.
Ashes to ashes! Lay the hero down,
No nobler heart e'er knew the bitter lot,
To be misjudged, maligned, accused, forgot—
Twine martyr's palm among his victor's crown.
MODESTY AND MUSIC.
The modesty of_ Mr. Punch is as world-known as his genius, but it
clearly must not hinder him from calling public notice to whatever
may enhance bis exalted reputation. Now that Zadkiels and Table-
turners and other impudent impostors have taken up the calling, Mr.
Punch but seldom condescends to prophesy; but to prove that he is
competent to do so when he chooses, he occasionally inserts a predic-
tion in his print. The last with which the world was favoured and
astonished was published in his number for the sixth of last October,
and predicted that the clear-voiced Clara Novello, whose "farewell
performance" had taken place the previous week, would be heard
again in London ere the ending of November. This marvellous pre-
diction created great sensation in the musical world, and heavy bets
were laid that it would fail to be fulfilled; for that a "farewell per-
formance" should prove not to be a farewell, was a thing of course
unheard-of in the annals of the art. Nevertheless, the day which sees
these words before the world will see another laurel added to the
prophet Punch's crown, and his last wonderful prediction faithfully
borne out. On the evening of Wednesday, November 21st, while every
club and coffee-room, every street and dwelling-house, is ringing with
his praise, in St. James's Hall will issue the last notes that our Clara
will bring out for us Londoners before she takes her well-won rest.
All ye who music love and would its pleasures prove had better change
your gold and silver for these notes, for they are the last with which
your ears by her will ever be enriched.

A SONG WITHOUT WORDS.
From our Idle Contributor.
"Dear Punch,
"I Hate been to hear the Night Dancers, a delightful opera
by Mr. Loder, which has just been capitally revived at Covent Garden,
by Miss Pine and Mr. Harrison. ]f Loder were not an English-
man, I would say that his opera is replete with grace, melody, tender-
ness, harmony, colour, tparkle, chic, elan, ensemble, and verve, but of
course all those pretty words (and whatever they mean) must be
reserved for Frenchmen and Italians. 1 will only say, just you take
Mrs. Punch, and Judina, and Tobina, and see if they are not delighted.
Mr. Loder has, of course, been kept in his proper place, that is to
say, entirely neglected, by managers, for many years, but that is no
reason wtiy, if an Englishman has somehow contrived to knock out
a fine work, we should not go and enjoy it, meaning, I am sure, no
disrespect to M. M. Verdi, Flotow, Halevt, Alary, and the rest of
the deities of music.
"But my principal object in writing to you is to say that those
Fatal Fairies, the Wilis, are the agents in the drama of this opera, and
that a capital notion came into my head. We have not had the Night-
Dancers for several years, and it has been a loss to the stage. Could not
a good parody be written on one of those black songs, and be called
"O WUii, we have missed you I"
If so, hadn't you better tell one of your young men to write it. You
can't expect me to find the notion and the poetry too.
"I am, dear Punch,
"Yours affectionately,

SOUTHWARK ELECTION.
We are happy to learn that Southwark has no intention of yielding
to the base dictation of those who invite her to neglect her own
inhabitants, and seek to be represented by some mere statesman.
Mud is thicker than water, and we have no idea of setting aside local
men for the sake of giving a seat to somebody who is nothing to us,
and probably never waded through the Borough in all his life. We
are gratified to state that if Mr. Rhynd, our eminent Cheesemonger,
j should find it incompatible with bis duties to take our representation
j upon him, and the health of Mr. Young Codlings, our distinguished
| Fishmonger, should induce his indefatigable medical attendant Dr. Smith
to forbid his standing, Mr. Trtvetts, our celebrated Ironmonger, has
nobly declared that he will not abandon old Southwark at her need. Each
of these gentlemen has ample pecuniary means, and though it is a base
libel on Southwark to write, as has been written, that it costs £10,000 to
keep her publicans in good humour, and to seat a candidate (for we know,
from vouchers, that it does not cost nine-tenths of that sum), we are
proud to believe that the neighbourly claims of our enlightened con-
stituency will not he forgotten by any of the gentlemen we nave named.
We need neither Mr. Latard, Mr. Helps, Mr. Wentworth Dilke,
nor Mr. Miall, while we have citizens like those we have mentioned,
and we beg to assure the scoffing critics and the sneering press that
the "Southwark snobs" know on which side their bread is buttered.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FROM OUR CHINESE CORRESPONDENT.
(A Letter icrilten from the Seat of War to the Pekin Penny Trumpet.)
iNGa'songoftriumph! Again
our arms are victorious!
Again have the Barbarians
(may their grandfathers eat
dirt!) fled, routed and dis-
mayed, before the gingals of
our braves! Again will bis
Serene Effulgency, the Off-
spring of the Sun (may his
pigtail never grow less!)
clap his hands, and grow his
finger-nails in safety and in
peace, and offer votive vic-
tims to our battle-god!
"My last letter informed
you how the enemy had
effected a landing from their
war-ships, which, as I re-
marked, are clumsy ill-con-
structed vessels, and not to
be compared for speed or
power with our junks. By
advice of our commanders,
the landing was permitted
to be made without attack;
for the old spider knows
better than to frighten away
the blue-bottle that is fluttering to his web. Having let them disem-
bark their handful or so of men (at the most, it is computed that they
number but five millions), General Sang-ko-lin-sin calmly waited
their arrival at the Taku forts, which to lure the silly infidels safe into
our jaws, it had been resolved that they should carry by assault. To
achieve this clever stratagem, a masterly backward movement was
effected by our braves; and with the exception of some six thousand
or so, who to keep up the pretence, were suffered to be killed, all our
troops retired without hindrance or confusion, and in as perfectly good
plight as when they left Fekin. The enemy it is true attempted to
annoy us by letting off his cannon at us on our march; but the only
damage done to us was that our sides grew rather sore, with our
agonies of laughter at his absurd attempts.
"Their warfare is still waged upon the ancientest of methods, such
as Wanki-ium, or Ske-di-Jim, or any other of our Generals would
deem only fit for babies, and, if they prize their peacock's feather,
would not dare to use. Plain, straightforward fighting is all these
fools have yet been trained for, and they apparently know nothing of
trickeries and stratagems, and all those finer arts of warfare, in which
our officers and ministers are so surpassingly well versed. The well-
known maxim of Fun-ki (the great authority upon Celestial military
tactics) that—
"He who fights and runs away.
May live to fight another day,"
they either foolishly ignore, or else have never heard of; and so far
does their brute courage carry them away, that they often fall a sacrifice
to its stupid sway.
"To make sure of the Barbarians, and prevent their running away,
an order has been issued to destroy their fleet; and as a couple of our
junks have been commissioned for the purpose, there will be tne utmost
ease in effecting its accomplishment. As far as all our spies have yet
been able to discover, the Barbarians (may the bones of their great-
grandfathers be grilled!) are perfectly unconscious of the fate that
is in store for them, and unsuspecting of the snare which has so
cleverly entrapped them. At their present rate of marching, you may
expect them at Pekin in the course of the next week, so bid the
executioners to have their saws in readiness. General Sang-ko-
lin-sin, with his victorious army, still heads them on the march, and,
to avoid the chance of contact, keeps his rear six miles in front of the
Barbarian boots."

in their slavery, the most hot-tempered of brutes. Their breath steams
up like smdke from their long stiff black proboscis, their every snort
is like a th.inder-clap, and when they scream, they make one faint.

THE IMMENSITY OF THE LORD MAYOR.
A Most imposing idea of the greatness of the Lord Mayor op
London will be given to any Frenchman into whose hands may fall a
number of the City Prett, wherein is quoted a description of the jewels
of the Civio Sovereign, derived from the interesting and instructive
pen of Mr. Timbs :—
"The collar (date 1534). la of pure gold, composed of a aeries of links, each formed
of a letter 3 ; a united York and Lancaster (or Henry tub Seventh) rose, and a
massive knot The ends of the chain are joined by tho portcullis, from the points
of which, suspended by a ring of diamonds, hangs the jewel. The entire collar cm-
tains 28 S'a, 14 roses, 13 knots, and moasuros 04 iuchos. The jewel conUins in tho
centre the City arms, cut in cameo of a delicate blue, on an olive ground. Sur-
rounding this, a garter of bright bluo, eiged with white and gold, bearing the City
motto, 'Domint Dir'uit Kos,' in gold letters. The whole is encircled with a costly
border of gold S's, alternating with rosettes ol diamonds, set in silver. Tho jewel is
suspended from tho collar by a portcullis, but when worn without tho collar is sus-
pended by a broad bluo ribbon. The investiture is by a massive gold chain, aud
when tho Mayor is re-elected, by two chains."
The ends of the Lord Mayor's chain are joined by a portcullis. Ex
pede Herculem! What must be the size of that chain which has a port-
cullis for its clasp! The great Lord Mayor of London is surely
distinguished by a physical greatness nearly proportionate to his
dignity. Fancy a man walking about with a portcullis on his breast!
Are not the Aldermen of London sons of AnakP These will be the
natural exclamations of intelligent foreigners, on learning that a port-
cullis is one of the jewels of the Civic regalia. Our neighbours across
the Channel have heard of the City Giants. They will suppose that
there are many more than two of these; and they will conclude that
the Lord Mayor is a big brother of Gog and Magog. What sort of a
castle must the Mansion House be to contain an inhabitant who wears
a portcullis, as a coinmon man would wear a hook-and-eye; and besides
this portcullis, an enormous jewel set in gold hanging at it, suspended
from his collar P Would the Lord Mayor's portcullis serve to close
Temple Bar? Would an army marching on London by the Strand
be arrested by the Lord Mayor's portcullis? Such are the questions
which France will propose to Europe for solution; and she will further
demand to know, whether the 250 tureens of real turtle, and all the
many kilogrammes and hectolitres of food and drink of every descrip-
tion, consumed at Guildhall annually on the ninth of November, are
principally consumed by the great Lord Mayor for his own dinner P
have giant guns that roar as though it were a whirlwind, and that
shake the mountains like a mighty earthquake. The balls they carry
weigh a quarter of a ton, and these monster shot are fired with Isuch
power and precision, as to hit the smallest humming-bird at a dozen
score of miles!
"What mortal might can stand against such murder-bringing
monsters P In five minutes and three seconds they took the Taku
Forts, defended though they were by the bravest of our braves. m Our
gingals were no more to them than baby-guns and pea-shooters. Un-
harmed by our fire (for they bear a charm about them which renders
them ball-proof), they slaughtered, hand to hand, three millions of our
men. Hump-ti is no more; Dumf-ti sleeps in peace; even the brave
Fon-ki lies numbered with the slain! Sang-ko-lin-sin is indeed the
only warrior who has escaped. Thanks to his lucky star (as well as
his long legs), he bath lost his peacock's feather, but hath saved his life.
"What need I tell you more P Be warned in time, 0 friend! Pack
up your tea at once, and prepare your toes to stretch. If you value
your existence, leave your valuables behind you. They will terribly
impede you, and if I survive, you may rely I will take care of them.
Moreover, I would recommend you to cut off your long finger-nails.

THE THIRD, FROH THE
RICHARDSON, IN THE COLLECTION OF THE LATE
RARTLEMT FAIR, ESQ.
CHAPTER XXXVII.—THE REIGNS OF EDWARD THE FIFTH
AND RICHARD THE THIRD.
S the first of these two
sovereigns only reigned
three months, it is not very
surprising that we find but
little change of costume in
his reign. Nor were the
two years and a quarter
which saw the "sly and
bloody" Richard on the
tlirone, prolific in new
fashions, either military or
civil. But with the reign
of Hknky the Seventh,
we enter a new period in
the history of costume; and
we have something more to
say about the fashionable
marvels of the Yorkists and
Lancastrians before we turn
our pen to the wonders of
the Tudnrs.
That King Hioiard was
a dandy is an historic fact,
although our playgoers may
not have seen much cause
to credit it. The "crook-
backed tyrant" is in general
dressed somewhat dowdily
upon the stage, and has
more of the heavy villain
than of the heavy swell
about him. Yet, we learn,
when Duke of Gloucester
he was the most fashionable
dresser of bis day; and that
his love of finery survived
his coming to the throne, is pretty evident from a mandate to the keeper
of his wardrobe which is extant among the Harleian MSS., and which
they who can decipher it are welcome to peruse. This letter he dis-
patched from York on the 31st of August, 1483, and it contains a curious
list of the dresses he wished sent to
him, and in which he was desirous
of exhibiting himself to his sub-
jects in the north. As his favourite,
the Duke or Buckingham, was
equally notorious for his gorgeous
apparel, we may presume that fops
were mostly in favour at his court;
and we can fancy how the York-
shiremen rubbed their eyes, and
"dauged their breeches," to see
"t' foine fwoak " who came to them
from " Lunnun."
Familiar as we are with the
Richard of the stage, it is difficult
to credit that the Richard of
reality could have looked other
than a ruffian. Yet that there was
more of beauty than of an ugly
beast about him, is proved by no
less an authority than the Countess
of Desmond, who danced with him
when young, and described him to
her friends as " the handsomest man
in the room, except his brother, the
King." This exception seems to us
in some measure to account for the
Countess' opinion; and we incline
rather to fancy, that if Richard
had not had a title to his back, she would not have shut her eyes to its
deformity* As the poet says, or might have said:—
"I f to his lot Homo ugly features fall.
Look at his rank and you forget them all."
* Wags have tried to make out for the purpose of a joke that Kino Richard was
a hunchback, and that the street boys of tho period, when the King happened to
pass ttiero, used to take delight in giving him a military salute, significantly
shouting as they did so, "Shoulder hvmpt 1" But it is wrong to imagluo that
Richard had a hump. Rous, who knew him personally, says of him in his history:
"He was of low stature, had small compressed features, and his left shouldor higher

Some slight notion may be formed of what sort of a figure the King
cut in his State robes, when we mention, that the day before his
coronation he rode in a procession from the Tower down to West-
minster, in a doublet ana stomacher of blue cloth of gold, wrought
with nets and pine-apples (a pattern often seen in drawings of this
epoch), a long gown of purple velvet furred with ermine, and a pair of
snort gilt spurs. Still more gorgeous was his get-up on the day of
coronation, when he came out coram pontile (no, Cox, we don't mean
in Great Coram Street) in a couple of State suits; one of crimson
velvet furred with miniver, and having an extremely rich embroidery
of gold, and the other of purple velvet fringed with ermine fur. His
tahatcms, or shoes, were covered with crimson tissue cloth of gold:
his hose were of crimson satin, as also were the shirt, coat, surcoat,
hood, and mantle in which he was anointed. Fine feathers these; but
surely all this crimson plumage must have rather given Richard the
look of a flamingo, if it did not make him look more like Sam Weller't
swell friend,"Blazet." Perhaps the King, however, wished to symbolise
his bashfulness by wearing a red suit, which might have served to show
how be blushed all over at the honour that was done him. This may
seem a foolish fancy, but history in some measure bears us out in
entertaining it. For instance, Goldsmith tells us, that when the
Mayor and Aldermen waited upon the Protector with an offer of the
crown, " he accepted it with seeming reluctance," as though he wished
them to imagine he was too modest to take it. A pretty subject this
for a fresco in St. Stephens, and we almost wonder that our artists
have not thought of it. Richard, nine feet high, with one hand
hiding a smile and with the other grabbing the crown, represented with
a sort of "Oh-no-I-couldn't-think-of-it-Pray-don't-ask-me" air about
him, would form an interesting addition to the series of subjects which
have been taken lately from the lives of English Kings.
Whether the dandies of this period were gifted with good legs, is a

question which we have not leisure to debate,
itself at sight of the
naturally
exceedingly short jackets that
were worn, whereby the lower
limbs were left completely un-
concealed. The only things that
covered them were long stock-
ings or hose, which, in fact, were
the same garments as the ancient
Norman chavsses. These ex-
tended up the thigh like the
thread tights of an acrobat, and
were tied by points or laces to
the doublet, much in the same
manner as our roley-poley suits.
The short jackets we have men-
tioned were worn over the dou-
blet, and were made plain at the
sides, but full of plaits upon the
chest as well as in the back.
Sometimes they were edged with
fur, and at the waist were tightly
belted with a narrow girdle,
from which a dagger generally
depended in the front. Their
sleeves were large and full,
padded at the shoulder to give
broadness to the chest, and
slashed to show the doublet, or
even shirt, beneath. For this
purpose, apparently, they were
often slit entirely from the shoul-
der to the wrist, and the edges
laced together about three inches apart. This slitting, combined with
the swollen appearance of the shoulder, muBt have made the wearers
look as though they had their arm9 broken, and were obliged to walk
about with a poultice in each sleeve.
Coming fashions, like events, sometimes cast their shadows on before
them: and we find that these short jackets were somewhat giving way
in Richard's time to the long and sober gowns which came in with
his successor. But for several years previous, long dresses had been
worn at times as commonly as short ones. In fact, variety was as
charming in these days as in ours, and persons of distinction were aa
frequently distinguished for their oddities of dress. The modern pork-
pie hat, with a slightly higher crown and with a single feather leaning
forward from the back, was a common form of head-cover throughout
the fifteenth century, and Jews, for aught we know, may have seen
nothing wrong in wearing it. Other eccentricities were equally con-
spicuous: ana among them we may mention a gentleman depicted in
an old illumination, who wears a shoulder-belt or baldrick slung to
reach down to bis knee, having a peal of little bells looped all along its
length.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MIRACULOUS CABINET.
Under the above head an extraordinary work of art has been exhi-
bited by a Pole at the Egyptian Hall. It was only five feet high, three
wide, and eighteen inches deep, and yet it seems to have contained a
whole Pantechnicon-full of furniture. No carpet-bag of the most
caoutchouc capabilities ever held so much. It accommodated inside
its rapacious interior no less than 150 pieces of domestic apparel, and
of the same size as those that are generally found in the miscellaneous
wardrobe of a house. There was a bedstead with hangings, big enough
for Paul Bedford to have slept in—there were chairs whose legs
would not have given way under the weight of Daniel Lambert, in
his offallest days. There was a dining-table that Lord Cowlet might
have invited all his friends to dine round two or three times a week,
besides a chandelier that he could hang over it, to dazzle them with the
light (for we are perfectly aware that expense is no object to his
Lordship) of twelve of the very best Motie candles. It would require
one of Debbnham's catalogues to enumerate the multitudinous articles
stowed away as close as cabinet secrets in this miraculous cabinet.
Two young persons about to marry would find everything in it to
make their turtle-dovery that snug nest of comfort that they have so
long been dreaming about. They would discover something fitting to
the taste of each. There would be (that is to say, if turtle-doves ever
think of such things) a smoking-table for the gentleman, and a baby's
swing-cot for the lady. This enchanted cupboard is a house complete
in itself, and has the further advantage of being about the only house
in which there is no skeleton, for the simple reason, that there is no
room for the smallest skeleton to hang out in it. Were he as small as
Lord John even, the skeleton would not be able to procure standing-
room even, much less a seat. This miniature mansion is replete
with plate, linen, crockery, even down to toys for the little ones, and
footstool for Grandmamma.. What a beautiful present to make a bride
on her wedding-day, only perhaps the twenty-eight covers and plates
might teach her to be extravagant! What a convenient portmanteau
to give to an emigrant! He could move about with his domicile on
his back as easily as a snail; and if sleep overtook him in the desert
or the backwoods, he would only have to pull out his bed and tuck
himself iu for as many comfortable forty winks as the wild beasts or
the gold-diggers would allow him. When next we remove, we shall
certainly send to Mr. Nadolsky to ask him if he can pack up all our
furniture in about the same portable size. Ladies should take lessons
of him in the art of packing, and then they would be able to travel
with at least one-halt their present quantity of luggage.

"Honour" or "Honor P" That is the question which has lately
been raised by a stupid inscription on an ugly monument. "Honour,"
certainly, and not "Honor." Why should we not write "Honor" as
well as "Error" and "Terror?" Because "Honour" is not only
the older spelling, hut also the more customary. We may as well
prevent any further degeneration of the English language, and as the
line of limitation must be drawn somewhere, let us draw it under the
standard orthography of the present day. Any lower descent to the
gulf of phonetic writing than that which has been already accomplished
will thus be arrested.
Another very good reason for eschewing "Honor" and "Favor"
is, not only that those words, like "Defense," and "Offense," are
pedantic Yankeeisms, but also that they are especially employed by
puffing tradesmen and other quacks, and are commonly adopted by
snobs who affect to talk fine, and who are accustomed to pronounce
their last syllable "or" just as they write it, or as rhyming with
"for." Let us hear no more of leaving the u out of " Honour" and
"Favour," and concede neither "Honor" or "Favor" to these
pompous gents.

in honour of all ranks who fell
in that neighbourhood in June,
1815. Certainly, as far as mere
recital of fact goes, it is simple
enough; but then comes the Col-
lowing aphorism:—
"Glory encircles with the same noble
diadem the humble as the exalted."
This bit of sentiment is the
only attempt at ornament which
the inscription exhibits; and that
attempt is surely not a success.
Glory neither encircles the humble
nor exalted with any diadem at
all. It encircles, or causes to be
encircled, the heads indeed of the
exalted very frequently, in some
cases with royal diadems, in others
with ducal coronets, or caps of
lesser nobility. But Glory does
not encircle the head of the humble
with anything better than ban-
dages, sometimes, when it has got
those heads broken in battle.
Even then it is Surgery which
applies those bandages; Glory
only creates the necessity for
them; and lucky are all humble
sufferers, maimed in quest of
Glory, whose country has the gra-
titude to bind their wounds. The
only diadem wit h'which Glory can
be said to encircle the head of
the humble, who light for Glory's
sake, is the figurative oue of an
ideal foolscap.
A WORD FOR OUR STATUES.
"Mb. Punch,
"Let us not be ashamed of our public statues. They are, no
doubt, qneer. The best of them are bronze and marble Guys. Our
sculptors do contrive somehow to give a wonderfully wooden character
to their works in metal and stone. They are, in fact, little better than
stone-masons. _ But then they are free masons. Those whose designs
are successful in a competition for a job, are free and accepted masons,
and the other masons are free, though rejected; the masons, rejected
as well as accepted, are all free. In this freemasonry lies the secret of
our inferior sculpture. Our funny statues are among the fruits of our
free institutions. We have no tyrant princes in this country to squander
upon their artists the revenues wrung out of their slaves. There is no
recognised idolatry, creating a demand for images. Our cleverest men
have their way to make in commerce and politics; speeches to make,
laws to make; above all, fortunes to make—better things to make than
statues. The Englishmen who try to make statues, and make them
ill, are those who have little ability to make anything else.
"But it is not likely that even our money-makers and speech-makers
and law-makers would have succeeded very highly in making statues,
if they had turned their hands to that employment. Britons are too
robust, both morally and physically, for such fancy-work. Our indi-
vidual and our national constitutions are much alike. British liberty
produces and consumes beef and beer. Hence results a strong but
clumsy habit of body and mind. A diet principally consisting of poor
soup, vegetables, and sour wine, with frequent restriction to fish, or
nothing at all, appears, from the example of unhappy foreigners, to be
the necessary nutriment of what is called plastic genius.
"Sir, they tell us that we have no genius. Considering what they
mean by genius, we may complacently agree with them. England has
produced some men of genius in the large way, but certainly few in
the small. We are exccljed by our neighbours in every speciality of
genius. They surpass us in sculpture, and also in singing and playing
music. But this kind of partial genius is very commonly accompanied
with general weakness of mind. In most cases, I believe that it is
simply the effect of nearly total idiocy, which has occasioned the
exclusive cultivation of the only capable faculty of an otherwise
deficient intellect. An Englishman cannot put his whole soul into his
fiddle, or even into his picture, or his statue. Our statues are monu-
ments of bad taste, very well. They are also monuments of consti-
tutional government. Our neighbours might be proud of the City
Giants, if the Prefect of the Seine were as independent as the Lord
Mayor of London. Proud indeed, too, they would doubtless be to
possess those celebrated colossal works of civic art and exhibit them in
their national museum. But, Sir, I trust they will never have Gog and
Magog at the Tuileries. No, Sir; but let us be liberal. We cannot
make statues properly; let us employ those who can. We hire
foreigners to sing, and fiddle, and dance for our amusement; why not
also to decorate our streets and buildings with images?
"I am not a prejudiced or bigoted man, Sir, but
"Your obedient Servant,
"A COSMOPOLITAN."
"P.8. Though foreigners should be engaged to make statues in
honour of illustrious persons, there would still be room for native
talent. Gut Fawkes should not standalone. What if a monument
were erected in dishonour of Judge Jefferies f A similar memorial
might perpetuate the infamy of that successor of his who sentenced
Lord Dundonald to the pillory."
Final Floorer for Folly.

PRETTY PROSPECT!
OUR ROVING CORRESPONDENT.
"My Dear Punch,
"In these Prrc-Raphaelite days of Art, a man must be pretty
accurate about the accessories of his picture. Suppose, for example,
1 am depicting a scene from the history of the thirteenth century
(which epoch you must know I particularly affect) and suppose from
inadvertence I paint my hero in trunk hose—what an outcry there will
be among the learned critics, directly! Perhaps the style of my
knight's armour is a quarter of a century too early, or the 'clocks' on
Clarissa's stockings a half an hour too late,—inttanter that eminent
savant Borewell drops down upon me in the Tropylteum, with 'This
absurd anachronism is worthy of—' &c. &c, or 'when will Mr. Easel
learn that it is a painter's duty to—' &c. &c.
"Well, it was precisely the dread of such remarks as these which
led me the other day into Westminster Abbey with my sketch-book under
my arm. I wanted to make a study for a Boot 'of the period,' which 11
was sure I could find on one of the tombs in Edward thb Confessor's
Chapel. Admission to this portion of the edifice is charged sixpence
per head, in return for which little fee the Dean and Chapter kindly
provide a staff of semi-eccleaiastically robed gentlemen who take it in
turn to play the cicerone to those country cousins and distinguished
foreigners who bestow upon our metropolitan lions their simple admi-
ration. And so well are these faithful laymen trained to their calling
that I verily believe any one of them could go through his description
blindfold if you only gave him his cue and kept his head clear of the
pillars.
"The rapid strides which Civilisation is daily making must have an
influence, among the rest of mankind, on Vergers, who 1 make no
doubt are by this time an exceedingly agreeable and well-informed com-
munity, but years ago when time was young, and I sat sketching at
fair Phillippa's feet, there was one eccentric member of the frater-
nity who used to intone his description in a manner which was not
pleasant, and as I had to listen to it about five times a day, you may
suppose I have not forgotten it yet. His brief, but pithy remarks
were as far as I recollect:—
*' This 'ere's the Chnppul of Edwed the Confessur. The pavement ^composed of
various sorts of marvels. And thats the Shroine of Edwed the Confessur you
tmisson touch tho mosakes; and thata the Tooin of Edwed the Fust there never
vras no monnymcnt this way please. That thcers the Corrynation Cheer same as
QnBEX Victoyer was crowned in and under its the stone as was brought from Scono
palace by Edwed the fust and all the Kings and Queens of England 'shin crowned
on that stone ever senco. And thata tho Screen on which is carved out all the istry
of Edwed the Confessur and deserves a minoot inspection number one's the
prellits and nobility a swearing feelty to Edward ho wasn't born at the time so
they swore at his mother instead and number two's bis Buth and number three's
his Corrynation and number five you see he's blowing up a thief and seven feet long
that sword is mum and eighteen puns in weight was carried before Edwed the
Thud into France and thats tho Toom of Enwkry the Fifth the body was cased
iu silver and tho 'ead was solid silver but its bin all took away down the steps to
the leff ploase for the way bout."
"Ah, my dark robed guide! Ah my voluble and veracious verger!
little did you think that your artless words would be reproduced on
these pages. I wonder do you still ply your gentle calling on the
'mosake pavement? Does that solemn fat forefinger of yours still
indicate the remains of John db WalthamP Perhaps you have
retired from that line of business. Perhaps ere this your sixpences
have enabled you to exchange your cloister life for one more befitting
an active mind for something, let us say, in the licensed victualling
way—who knows?
Occupied with these speculations, and having finished my sketch,
I wandered listlessly among the tombs and monuments. What a queer
old fashion-book of exploded tastes and byegone conceits one reads in
in them! Just as this terrestrial sphere spins round on its own axis,
so the World of Art revolves on its own sesthetical pivot, and we find
this and that style turning up in its appointed place as surely as the
recurring decimals in Mr. Colenso's interesting little treatise. Good
heavens] was there ever a time when yon grinning sheeted skeleton
emerging from a marble tomb amidst clouds of the same material
inspired the spectator with any feelings but those of ridicule and horror P
Is it possible that Mr. Joseph Addison, as he calmly sauntered over
this ground in a Ramillies wig could have seen anything to admire in
those plethoric cherubims who hover over the Dure of Somerset's
sarcophagus P And yet no doubt His Grace's monument was considered
a masterpiece in its day! That was a time for urns and cenotaphs,
and reversed torches, and slobbering cupids. The Olympian deities
had their reign, but it is past, and the symbols of their dynasty are out
of fashion; English Art is taking another direction. We have long
laughed at those quaint old stiff-legged medievalists, with their black-
letter scrolls, forgetting that they might have been as active and
written as good a hand as ourselves if fate had but clothed them in

and made no more of cleaving a bar of iron in twain than my grand-

"Just as I" reach this point in my soliloquy, a sharp shrill sound
uncommonly like a railway whistle, strikes on my ear. What can
it be P There it is agaiii, louder and nearer, accompanied by the short
energetic puffs of a locomotive. I look inquiringly at my friends the
vergers who glance interrogatively at each other, and then we all run
out of Poet's Corner together, and look down towards Parliament
Street, where a crowd of people have assembled. Lo! whose is this
giant form which stands out dark against the London sky and makes
the Hansom cabs seem very pigmies P Who is this mail-clad warrior
with haughty mien and outstretched arm, riding like a god above the
crowd P Volumes of steam surround his charger's head, and we seem
to hear the noble beast snorting as he prances by. We all stand still
and wonder. Street boys throw up their caps and cheer. Even the
cabmen for a brief moment forget their fares and pull up to have a look.
Can I be mistaken P Those handsome bronzed features—that steed of
mettle yielding to an iron sway. No! It is Richard of the Lion
Heart riding triumphant into Palace Yard.

"By this time you will doubtless perceive that I have been de-
scribing in my romantic style, the arrival of Marochetti's equestrian
statue of the great Crusader which has just been set up at Westminster.
The wondrous snorts and steam emanated I admit not from the
warrior's horse but from one of Brat's traction engines which dragged
the statue to the spot. Now was not this a sight to see! The twelfth

Lion preceded by a locomotive! Bravo, Marocuetti! Bravo,
James Watt! Science and Art go hand in hand. Slowly and majes-
tically they approach. A great scaffold has been prepared for hoisting
the Warrior King, and presently a stout mechanic leaps upon his
shoulder. Another is astride the horse's head, and a dozen more are
at work below. For a few minutes the Lion heart has to submit to a
little indignity, and is bound with ropes and chains; at last the mass
begins to move; rises gently; swings in mid air; ah! if I had designed
that noble group what would have been my feelings at that moment?
an unsteady hand, an unseen flaw—one Blight defect in that ingenious
machinery, might have sent the whole seven tons of metal thundering
to the earth, and the labour of years would have been lost. DU averlite

CHAPTER XXXVIII.—A SECOND SIGHT (WITHOUT CLAIR-
VOYANCE) AT THE LADIES OF THE I5th CENTURY.
ueerlt quaint as were the
fashions in the first half of this
century, those which followed
them perhaps were even more
preposterous. This, although
of course it is distressing to
reflect upon, no doubt the
philosophic mind will be pre-
pared to hear. The highest
height of folly is not quickly
to he reached, any more than
is the lowest depth of base-
ness. The trite maxim that
"nemo repente fuit turpusi-
mm" is no less true in milli-
neries than it is in morals:
and when once an era of baa
taste begins, it is not in a
hurry that the worst may be
expected. Other parts of their
costume appear ridiculous
enough, but in looking at a
portrait of a lady of the period
which we have now to write
about, extending from the
reign of Edward the Fourth
to that of Richard the
Third, we cannot help first
smiling at the head-dress that
she wears, which, if not the
height of folly, certainly goes
far to reach it. Gigantic and
absurd as were the horned
raoic a beautiful wood-eiokavibo ot the and heart-shaped head-dresses
time of ei,ward the fourth. (VERY kabce.) which we saw in bur first look
at the ladies of this century,
they were not half so large and ludicrous as the high-crowned steeple-
caps, that came in fashion just before the death of Henry the Sixth.
These erections were constructed of cloth or other fabric, and were built
about as high as three of our men's hats. They, however, had no
brims, and fitted closely to the head, gradually diminishing in width
towards the top. These sugarloafy structures (which the ladies very
likely regarded as "sweet things") were worn at a slight angle in-
clining to the back, and were ornamented sometimes with a couple of
fauze flaps, which projected like the wings of a gigantic butterfly,
lit her covering the cap or else fastened to its top, was a scarf or veil
of lawn that hung down to the heels, and for comfort's sake in walking
was tucked under the arm. This scarf was somewhat similar to the
lirripipe or tippet, which still continued to be wom among the middle
classes; who, as they could not afford to make themselves ridiculous

by wearing the high steeple-caps, did the best they could by coming
out in hoods made somewhat flattened to the head, and at the sides
adorned with projections like apes' ears. The monks of coarse objected
to these monkeyish appendages; and one may fairly think that women
had more on their heads than in them when one finds them apeing the
appearance of an ape.
Tourists who in quest of finer weather than we have had in England
have taken a week's scamper into Normandy this summer, may have
seen caps approaching to the size of these huge head-dresses; and there
is little doubt, we think, that the fashion was originally taken from the
French, for English ladies then were just as imitative creatures, it would
seem, as they are now. We have ample proof indeed that the mania
for these monstrosities raged with even greater fury in France than it
did here. Among other clinching evidence, Monstrelet relates a
highly edifying story of a "perambulating friar" by name Thomas
Conecte, who must have been the terror of the women of his time.
This perambulating preacher (who, for aught we know, may have
preached from a perambulator) started so determined a crusade against
high head-dresses in France that the ladies did not dare to wear them
in his presence.* Besides other brutalities, 'he dyd excite j* smalle
boyes to pulle downe these monstrous headificies, so that y° maides
were forced to sheltere in some place of safetye, untyl their loveres or
their lacqueys did come to their assisttance." The sensitive mind
shrinks from picturing the scrimmages and scuffles that took place,
and gallantry compels us to entertain a hope that the beadles now and
then had the whipuand of the boys. We however find that for a while
the holy father triumphed and made a bonfire of big head-dresses in
front of his alfresco pulpit. But, proceeds the chronicler:—
"This reform laateddo not long; for like as snails when any one passeth by them
do drawe in their horals, and when dauuger seems ouerdo put them forth againo,t s
these ladies, shortly after the preacher had quitted their countrye, forgetful of his
doctrine and abuse, began to resumo tbeir former head-dresses, and wore them even
higher than ever."
It is difficult to decide whether the ladies of this era were great
church-goers or not, and whether if they were, they wore these steeple
caps to signify the fact. If they did, it would have been but yet
another proof of the weakness of the sex.
"A daw's not reckoned a religious bird,
Because he keeps a oawing from a steeple:"
nor, we apprehend, could a lady well establish a character for
church-going, on the ground that she persisted in wearing steeple-caps.
How they possibly contrived, in such Brobdingnaglike bonnets, to creep
* Addison, in the Spectator, speaks of the steeple head-dress as a "Gothic build-
ing," and gives it as his opinion that the ladies would most probably have carried
it much higher but for the attacks of the friar Cohecte. "This holy man," he says,
"travelled from place to place to preach down these monstrous structures; and
succeeded so welt in it that, as the magicians sacrificed their books to the names
upon the preaching of an apostle, many of the women threw down their head-
dresses in the middle of his sermon, and made a bonfire of them within sight of his
pulpit. Ho was so renowned that he had often a congregation of 20,000 people:
the men placing themselves on the one side of his pulpit, and the women on tbe
other, that appeared like a forest of cedars with their heads reaching to the clouds."
t It is not much of a compliment to compare ladies to snails; but when they wore
horned head-dresses, the simile was made so often that they must have grown quite
usod to it. Endless was the playing by the punsters on these horns. One can
hardly read a lino in the satires of the period without coming across such phrases as
"they deem their horns a hornament, or "their horns they have exalted."

under the low-arched doorways of the period, ia more than we at
present are able to conceive. Nor can we comprehend how, when
they had their Sunday caps
on, which were doubtless
taller than those worn
during the week, they ma-
naged to get into the street-
cabs of the period, which
no doubt were not much
roomier and higher than
ours now. Perhaps, in-
deed, for their express ac-
commodation, the cab-roofs
were constructed so as to
lift up; but we doubt not
sundry squabbles occasion-
ally occurred. A cabby
must have frequently de-
manded "some thin' hex-
try" for carrying "that
'ere luggage," as in his
anger and irreverence he
may perhaps have called a
couple of these caps.
In the score of years
succeeding the death of
Heney the Sixth, the
shape of ladies' dresses was
but very slightly varied,
being as ugly at the outset
as well could be imagined.
The fotm that was most
fashionable was to have
the front left open from
the neck down to the waist, with a turnover roll oollar, made of
a dark colour, bordering the aperture. A stomacher of cloth or linen
covered the breast beneath, and occasionally the gown was laced
together over it in the mode of the Swiss bodice. A fringe of fur
was often added to the dress; and the sleeves, which fitted pretty
closely to the arm, were furnished with deep cuffs of either fur or
velvet, reaching not unfrequently to the finger roots. The gowns
were so capacious both in their length and width, that as they
hung limp round the legs (for crinoline, we should remember, had
not been invented), the ladies were obliged to bear them slung
over their arms, as Dianas do their riding-habits at the present
day. A broad silken band was worn about the waist, the wives of
persons of less income than forty pounds a year being forbidden to
wear girdles of foreien manufacture, or adorned with any broidery of
silver or of gold. Figured satins, furs of sable, and the richer cloths
of velvet were also prohibited to ordinary women, such as the "wives
of esquires and gentlemen, and of the knights bachelors," though how
in the name of wonder knights bachelors could have wives, the writer
whom we quote does not condescend to state.
The following quaint lyric, which has obviously been parodied in one
of our most popular songs, suggests a pretty picture of a gallant of the
period casting sheepseyes at his sweetheart, and affords some indication
that the finery of the women did not find much favour in the eyesight
of the men:—

The Superior of the Jesuits (though any honest man is entitled to
that name) has published a furious protest against the Order being
expelled from Italy. He tells King Victor Emmanuel that in the
event of the Jesuit petition being rejected on earth, the Superior will
address it to a Higher Tribunal. We are inclined, considering the
wickedness of the sect and the insolence of the man, to wish that he

ARE UMBRELLAS PUBLIC PROPERTY?
The second column of the Timet grows daily more and more surprising.
It really sometimes is as much as we can do to eat our breakfast, so
strongly are we tempted to keep gaping with astonishment. Just by
way of sample, here is one of the last wonders which so greatly have
astonished us :—
FOUND, on the 13th instant, a SILK UMBRELLA. The owner may
have It on describing it and paying the expense of this advertisement. Apply
by letter only to F. W., &o.
Honour among thieves may be perhaps of rare occurrence, but what
is it compared to honesty among the finders of umbrellas! Umbrella-
stealing generally is accounted as no theft, although we should not
advise people rashly to commit it, for it may not so be viewed in
British Courts of Justice. Notwithstanding this, however, we should
scarce have thought it possible that the finder of an umbrella should
actually pay money to advertise the fact. Most people would rest
satisfied with finding the umbrella, without making an attempt to find
its rightful owner. Indeed, so lax is the morality of men in this
respect, that when they spy a stray umbrella, they pounce on it as
readily as though it were a mushroom, or any other thing that any
finder may pick up._ Whether umbrellas can in law be viewed as
private property, seeing how the public continually lay hands on them,
is a point which we reserve for counsel to decide; and whiie they are
about it, we would moot the further point, as to whether, if proceedings
at common law were taken to recover an umbrella, (say, one which
has been borrowed for five minutes and not returned within a twelve-
month) the proper plan would be to bring an action of trover, or an

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A JOKE AT ST. GEORGE'S-IN-THE-EAST.
ke day last week tome
very good fun occur-
red at a meeting of
the vestry of that ec-
clesiastical bear gar-
den, St. George's-in-
the-East. Mr. How-
ell, the Vestry Clerk,
having related the
particulars of an in-
terview with the
BiSHOF Of LONDON—
"Mb. Barrmt said he
could Dot help thinking
that the Bishop was act-
ing courteously; hut what
he might he doing spi-
ritually was a very dif-
ferent thing. He tried to
please tho people, but so
would a mountebank.
(0A, oh, and uproar.)"
Mr. 1Uhkf.it had
never perhaps had oc-
casion to transcribe,
iii his early days, the
aphorism which de-
clares that "compari-
sons are odious." A
gentleman capable of
comparing the Bishop
or London to a
mountebank, would
be likely not to have
been very highly edu-
cated; indeed, to be
an offender against
decorum of the class
"R.& W.Imp." The
similitude insinuated by Mr. Barrett was, if rather objectionable, still highly comical,
as anybody will acknowledge who recollects the bishop's photograph, and endeavours, by
its aid, to imagine bim grimacing in motley, or even making a fool of himself at a
Pnseyite altar. Scandalised, however, rather than diverted by the irreverent absurdity which
his colleague had just perpetrated—

"Mr. I.m i.kjohn protested against tho

being likened to a mountebank, and moved that the

a mountebank, according to Mr. Barrett, and
to write Mb. Barrett down a British Vestry-
man! The convocation of parochial authorities
in which that worthy distinguished himself by
the above quoted sally of broad but disrespect-
ful humour, is called, in the report of it, an
"Extraordinary Vestry Meeting." In point of
intelligence, wisdom, and refinement, however,
it seems to have been characterised by just the
ordinary features of that species of assembly.
TURNING-POINTS P
We read that an action for damages has been
brought for some "turn-tables." It turned out
that they had been supplied to a railway com-
pany, but at first we thought that these turn-
tables" had been ordered by our friends, the
Spirit-rappers, and were some of the rotary in-
struments by which they help to turn the heads
of the credulous fools who place their faith and
bank-notes in them. By the bye, will any
Spiritualist, whose sight is deeper than most of
his far-seeing fraternity, have the kindness to
inform us whether Kino Arthur and his knights,
as they sat round their circular table, were in
the habit of turning it? It might be a handy
practice for sending the bottle round. We should,
also, like to be informed by the same obliging
gentleman, whose sight, we are sure, is not
deeper than his sagacity, whether we should be
justified in calling, ana whether he would take
any offence if we did call, this old trick of
turning the tables a round game. The game
of Spirit-rapping, the rapacious sums that are
rapped out of fools, we should think went by
the name of cribbage.
Very well; but Mr. Barrett's comparison ought to have been recorded, as well as the
statement of Mr. Howell. Oh, that somebody had been there to write down the Bishop
A Fatal Sentence.
"Liberty, is fatal to the Bourbons." So said
the father of the present, or rather the ex-KiNo
o? Naples. But supposing the son is caught,
ought he not, as tried by the sentence above, to
be locked up for life. If "Liberty is fatal" to
a Bourbon, the most generous, the most chari-
table thing would be to deprive him of it. The
Elmo, we suggest, wouldn't be a
bad residence for him. He couldn't object to try
what he had so often recommended to others.
LONG LIVE THE LORDS!
"Extraordinary Longevity or the Peers" was the heading of
a newspaper paragraph which lately appeared, containing a statement
of the advanced ages to which several members of the House of
Lords have attained. The longevity of their Lordships, however, is
not extraordinary. They are almost all of them born with the peculiar
advantage of having in their mouths, at birth, a wonderful instrument,
ensuring the best possible nutrition. This is that bountiful provision,
which, in the vulgar tongue, is denominated the Silver Spoon. By
means thereof the very best of food and drink that may be desired can
be introduced into the system, and when that is out of order, also the
best of physic. Change of air and scene, recreation of all kinds, and
all manner of enjoyment are at the command of .their Lordships gene-
rally, and they are exempt from cares which kill other people, either
by directly wearing them out, or by inducing them to drink gin, and
smoke inferior tobacco. Good wine and first-rate cigars, in which
they are seldom driven by depression and misery to indulge too
freely, tend much to prolong their noble lives.
The old Law-Lords, who were not provided with a congenital silver
spoon, have contrived, however, to butter their bread well early in life on
one side, and afterwards to get it thickly buttered for them on the other.
None of the Peers are obliged to live in the constant practice of self-
denial, and also in the fear of ruin, and a destitute old age. They are
exempt from dread of bailiffs, and have no bills to meet, except those
which tradesmen send in at Christmas, which they can afford to pay, or
which come up from the Lower House, which they are free to reject.
In legislation, moreover, they carefully observe the truly constitutional
rule which prescribes early hours. No marvel they live so long as
they do. The only wonder is that most of them do not outlive Old
Parr, and that many of the Peers do not reach the years of the
Patriarchs.
A TRIFLE FROM THE HA.YMA.RKET:
In the which are a pretty little theatre, with a pretty little name, (the
Bijou) and a neat little company, and everything to help out a pleasant
evening, except one thing. And as Mr. Punch has no idea either of
being deprived of the French Play or of being suffocated while at it, he
begs to apprise Mr. E. T. Smith, or M. Talexy, or the responsible
party, that he, Mr. Punch, took a little gherkin in his pocket, the last
time he went to see Madame Doche, and that the fearful heat so
operated upon the vegetable, in a forcing point of view, that it grew
into a cucumber big enough to supply supper to his party of five, on
their reaching Eaton Square, besides leaving two large knobs to shy at
the cabmen as they drove away with his guests three hours later. Mr.
Punch trusts that this appalling anecdote (for the truth of which he
vouches) will induce the management to supply the one thing wanting
at the little Bijou, namely, ventilation. As Iachimo says:—
"I beg but leave to air this Jewel."
"Another Victim to Crinoline."
So many are these victims, that we think every newspaper establish-
ment must keep the above heading standing to meet the demand.
Another poor girl has been burnt at Warwick. The Hindoo widow used
to sacrifice herself on the funereal pile out of love for her husband.
The fanaticism of the English maiden is not less sad, for doesn't she
sacrifice herself to the flames out of love towards an absurd fashion?
The authorities have nearly suppressed the first wicked absurdity; why
doesn't the Government interfere with the second one, and try to put it
down? If it were only on account of these frequent accidents, we think
we should be warranted in denouncing Crinoline as A Burning Shame.

Justice not at Home.
So Government pro-
poses to erect, between
Carey Street and the
Strand, a grand new
building, comprehend-
ing all the chief legal
tribunals, under the
name of Palace of Jus-
tice. Let it not be called
by this new-fangled title.
Palace of Justice is a
Frenchified phrase, and.
moreover, the so-called
Palace will be one in
which a very different
inmate from Justice will
reside. To denote the
distinctive character, as
well as the nationality
of the edifice, style it
not Palace of Justice,
but Court of Law.
A Fair Return.
Every effort is being
made at the present
day by the men to en-
large the sphere of wo-
man's employment. If
woman is only com-
monly grateful, the very
least she ought to do in
return would be to di-
minish the sphere of her
dress!
THE MONEY MARKET AND THE TUNNY MARKET.
Con sid eh able agitation has been of late prevailing in the monetary
world by reason of a little squabble between those highly influential
and respected personages, Madame la Banque of France and the Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street. So far as we can gather, the row arose
in consequence of the behaviour of Madame, who, on finding her long
purse was getting short of gold, created what is called an artificial run
for it. This she partially achieved by buying up as many bills on
London as she could lay her hands on, and sending them over here to
be prematurely discounted; an operation that occasioned the Old Lady
of Threadneedle Street considerable annoyance, and made her more
than usually tetchy when applied to. Matters were at length indeed
brought to such a pass that she tied up her old stocking in which she
keeps her gold, and declared that she'd be "dratted" if she'd send
out any more of it: adding, that if her neighbour wanted gold, she
ought to raise her rate of discount, and not come bothering over here
and running off with all the gold that she could grab from us. For her
part the Old Lady said she wouldn't have demeaned herself by stooping
to such practices, and if Madame did not know the proper way to go
to work, it was high time that she were taught, and while she was
about it, the Old Lady was determined to give her a good lesson.
Madame la Banque of course felt some uneasiness at this, which she
tried her best to hide by affecting indignation. She knew too well,
however, that it would not suit her interest to quarrel with the Ola
Lady, and so she compromised the matter by begging for a loan of two
millions of gold to be secured by a deposit of an equal sum in silver, of
which it seems that she has plenty stored away in two or three old
china teapots in her safe. This request, as is well known, was gra-
ciously acceded to; but those behind the scenes are aware there was
some trouble in getting it accepted, for although upon the whole of a
kindly disposition, and ready to do all within her power to accom-
modate, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is rather apt to grow
cantankerous, especially when her old stocking is threatened to be
touched. It is not generally known, but we conceive there is no harm
in our publishing the fact, that her gracious acquiescence to the French
lady's request was mainly owing to the ready tact of Mr. Punch. Being
by far Hie most considerable capitalist in Europe, that gentleman felt
naturally some slight feeling of anxiety to see the symptoms of a
monetary panic put a stop to, and be therefore did his best to make
the old ladies snake hands upon the bargain which, it seems, had been
suggested by his wisdom, and of which the ablest of financiers had
approved. As an inducement, then, to part with her two millions of
gold, he generously offered to place at the disposal of the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street the same number of copies of his, Mr. Punch's,
Pccket-Book: a work which all his readers tell him, is "as good as
gold," and which has been stamped as sterling by the public press.
This Mr. Punch, who is all goodness, volunteered to do, without re-
ceiving further recompense than two million half-crowns, at which
absurdly low quotation he allows his book to issue; and he was liberal
enough to add, that he was willing to send over on precisely the same
terms two millions of his Pocket-Book to his friend Madame la Banque.
By these means the old ladies will be abundantly supplied with a new
circulating medium, which if not gold itself, is allowed to be as good
as it. When it is remembered that the Pocket-Book is valued at some
hundreds of puns, and that of the precious gems of poetry it abundantly
contains nearly every other line will be found to be a golden one, some
notion may be formed of how enormously by Mr. Punch's operation the
Banks of France and England will be mutually enriched.
"MOOSICK ! "-A CRY FROM THE GALLERY.
We read in our favourite publication, The Musical World, that the
municipal authorities of Baden-B.aden, have been christening, out of
compliment to the illustrious composer, one of their new promenades
L'Avenue Meyerbeer. We suppose that all the trees are covered with
nothing but leaves of music, which the wind, as it runs its weather-eye
through them, plays at sight, the result being a most delightful series
of glees, ballads, cantatas, and songs without words. What a glorious
Jubilate they would all strike up as their worthy godpapa walked
musingly through them! We wish some obliging correspondent would
oblige us with a stave or two out of this harmonious avenue. We
would have them made into flutes, or batons rather, and present one to
each of the most renowned Marechaux of the orchestra. By the way,
when shall we be christening any of our public thoroughfares after our
favourite composers or singers P In our dull imagination, it will be a
rare long time before we shall ever have a Balfe Square, or a Wallace
Crescent, or a Macfarren Avenue, or a Webster Lane, or a Punch Arc
de Triomphe, or a Clara Novello Park. How the nightingales, Swedish
as well as those of other countries, would cluster in the latter! It
would be one immense bird-cage, and Night, as it threw its black
mantle over it, would alone have the power of putting a stop to the
singing. You would Bee the whole atmosphere shaking like Albont,
with gushing melody—every breath of air, we can fancy, would bring
with it an air of music.

A CONSERVATIVE AGENT.
rail! Who is Mr. Frail?
Come, nonsense. Every-
body knows Mr. Frail,
- and if anybody knows
him a little better than
anybody else, it is Lord
Derby, inasmuch as Mr.
Frail is one of the men
of all work for the Tory
Opposition; an agent for
the Carlton Club. Mr.
Frail's services to his
party have been extraor-
dinary, and for fear that
the last service he has
done his party should be
insufficiently recognised,
Mr. Punch extracts the
following charming and
graphic record thereof
from the Montgomeryshire
Mercury.
Mr Frail was charged,
before the trembling Ma-
gistrates of Shrewsbury,
with having come up to a
gentleman named Soutii-
am (who was conversing
with a friend in a street
of the said town), and
having used unto the said
gentleman language of an
exceedingly potent de-
scription, so potent indeed,
that like very high game, it
could not be brought under the noses of ordinary persons. In four lines of the language
sworn to, there are seven words which are only heard (except in Shrewsbury and from the
Carlton agent) from persons in that condition of drunken violence which justifies their
immediate incarceration. Well, it is further sworn that Mr. Frail, not unnaturally
astonished that he did not receive instant chastisement, proceeded to intimate his ideas to
Mr. Souiham as follows, omitting oaths:—

said, 'We fine Mr. Frail £3, and require him to be
bound in bis own recognisances for £50 for three
They doubtless felt that Mr Frail's own
conscience would tell him whether he had done
anything out of the way. They never hinted at
such a thing, but merely complied with the letter
of the law, and without remonstrance or rebuke,
inflicted a nominal sentence on the eminent
Conservative. Their meekness was too much
even for Mr. Fbail himself :—
"Mr. Frail to Mr. 8hallwood (with a look of
assumed surprise)—Is that all? I thought it 'vould hare
been more!
One would have thought so, even if the more
had only been a severe rebuke to a self-con-
victed blackguard. But the Shrewsbury Magis-
trates doubtless know their own business best.
Mr. Punch has merely to point out Mr. Fbail's
last service to the Conservative party in show-
ing of what kind of stuff a Carlton agent may be
made.
coward, or you would knock my
"Frail. 111 give you a good lick in the mouth; you aro a ■
head off; but you know it's all true.
"Southam. 1 don't choose to make a blackguard of myself in the streets.
"Frail. I will knock yours off.
"Southam. If you touch me it will be the most expensive job you ever did.
"Frail. I will give you a good licking before the Mayor yet."
Mr Southam kept his head on, and also kept his temper, and invited the Conservative
gentleman to meet him, as proposed, before the Mayor. There the foregoing scene was proved,
and then the agent of the Carlton proceeded to cross-examine his accuser :—
'• Frail. Did I say it was not theiirst lie you had told, and had to apologise for?
"Southam. You did not I never had to apologise.
"Frail. Not to Mr. Kkatk, whon you told a lie about him.
•' Southam. I never told a lie about Mr. Krate, and never apologised to Mn. Keate.
'' Frail. Did I call you a vendor of squirt and British brandy?
"Hoituam. You did not.
"Frail. Did I call you. a bandy-legged baboon?
"Southam. You said nothing of the sort.
"Frail. Did I say your breath was worse than poison?
"Southam. No.
"Frail. Did I call you a punter? (A laugh.)
"Southam. I suppose all this is part of the mud you Bald you would throw at mo If the (
"Frail. Now, open your oars and shut your mouth, and listen unto me."
It is to be supposed that the worthy Magistrates of Shrewsbury desired that the case
should be established out of Mr. Frail's own mouth, and therefore permitted him to insult
the witness, as it is not to be imagined that a Mayor of Shrewsbury and his friends stand
in any awe and terror of the eminent Conservative. Their clerk certainly interfered, but was
in his turn insulted by Mr. Frail, and.was not supported by his more subtle and far-seeing
chiefs. Their wisdom was rewarded, and they had some fun into the bargain, for Mr Frail,
after justifying the use of the potent language, proceeded pathetically to narrate the
following anecdote:—
"Mr. Southam would have overybody look up to him, and when he stands up, as I often see him in the
council, he wants everybody to look up to him as a mighty man—a second Disraeli. Why did he not tell
yon what happened iu the summor months; ho prepared his speech ujwn the new market, walked out of his
drawing-room with hia two children, took them into a field occupied by Mn. Kockk, aud addressed them
as babes in the wood.
"Mr. Southam. I distinctly say that is untnio.
"Mr. Frail (continued) Addressing his children as babes in the wood, he commenced his spocch by
saying, 'Mr. Mayor and gentlemen,' and when ho concluded he said. 'Come along, my little dears: your
father has often told you ho was the Di.raeli of tho Town Council.' I appeal to him if he did not take the
two children with a largo tolcseopo, and a cow in tho distance, and say, 'What a splendid creature.'"
This story Mr. Frail supposed would be a plea in arrest of judgment, and he was not
entirely wrong; for after a good deal more of what a harsh judgment might term vulgar
buffoonery, by Mr. Fbail,
"The Magistrates retired, and after an absence of about a quarter of an hou» returned, when the Mayor
DON'T LOOK ALIVE.
What a dreadful hurry the victors of Delh:
and Lucknow are in for the reward of their
valour. Why, such of them as are still alive
have not waited much more than three years!
Is that a time to make a fuss about? If they
think so, let them be ashamed of their impv
tien*";, and read the following advertisement,
whicu is official. It appeared in the Timet news-
paper in June last:—
"NAVAL PRIZE MONEY.
"Department of tho Accountant-Ooneral of the Navy,
"Admiralty, Somerset House, June 16.
"Notice Is hereby given to the officers, seamon and
marines, and to all porsons Interested therein, that the
distribution of a moiety of tho proceeds of certain
piratical junks, captured on the 11th of May, 1853, by
Her Majkbtt'b Ship Rattler, will commence on Moudiy,
the 25th of Juue, I860, in the prize branch of the dopert-
ment of the Accountant-Qeneral of the Navy, Admiralty,
Somerset House."
There! a heroic deed is done in May, 1853,
and nobody thinks of rewarding the heroes until
1860, seven whole years later. As the man says
in the Antiquary, Oh, it's a beautiful thing to
think how long and how carefully justice is con-
sidered of in this country!"
But, mind! where there are reasons for being
rapid, our admirable authorities can be as fast
as steam or even telegraphs. It is only the
lower order of heroes who have to wait for
what is due to them. Their betters are served
the instant they have done their work. For
instance, though the Rattlers have waited seven
years, and the Indian warriors have waited three
years, the return mail took out (and very pro-
caine into court? perly) the guerdon to Sir Hope Grant for his
services the other day at Taku. So let us have
no sneers, or allegations that the authorities
can't be rapid—the fact simply being that they
won't.
A Trifle from Oxford Street.
Coming out of the Princess's Theatre, after
liny Bias, a friend who had the honour of
attending Mr. Punch remarked (as everybody
who really understands acting must remark
after witnessing that play), "M. Fechter is an
artist of exquisite finish." "You are right, my
dear friend," said Professor Pouch, " in Fech-
ter'sperformance, there is no case of reinfects"
They then adjourned to the American Stores
aud liquored.
Question for Spirit-Rappers.—Are spirits
smuggled under the table, and can they be
removed without a permit?

Therefore, George Cduzon, make your arrangements for

not bother about your will, because, even if the above
insane address did not show that no will made by you

MONKEY UNCOMMON UP, MASSA!
Tn consequence of the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the
United States (bravo, hooray, O my brothers!), it is announced1 that South Caro-
lina, in an eestacy of slave-owner's rage, has ordered a solemn day of humiliation,
on which all the slaves in the State are to be flogged, and all the copies of the
Scriptures burned. Moreover, she calls a Convention, and declares that she is
going to separate from the Union, and be an independent State, and have repre-
sentatives of her own at the Courts of Europe. We hear that her first demands
on England arc, that to show our sympathy in her hate of the President, Lincoln
Cathedral be pulled down, the County of Lincoln be re-christened and called
Breckenridge County, that all Lincoln and Bennett hats be immediately smashed
in, that LoasLincoln be transported, and that when FalttojTmthe play speaks of
"thieves in Lincoln green," he be ordered to say " President Lincoln s black

OFF WITH HIS HEAD!
Hoobat! we have not had a good sight lately, and the execution of a Lord, on
Tower Hill, will be a refreshing stimulant. We hope that the streets will be laid
down again by the time the fatal scene comes on, and we suggest to the Trinity
House to do something useful for once, and have the Hill nicely gravelled. We
bespeak front places in the best red cloth gallery for all our young men, and as
criminals from the lower class are finished off at a time which suits their friends,
we really trust that similar courtesy will be extended to the aristocracy, and that
justice will be done, in this case, about two o'clock, so that one will have time to
breakfast and get to the execution comfortably.

know when, but created in 1616. He will have to bring his block-head to the
block for the following High Treason.
He has objections to the present system of taxation, (and so have we for that
matter), and thus the unfortunate Teynham addresses the Northern Reform
Union:—
"A House of Commons that cannot carry the people's measures needs that the people should
carry It. Are the people as weak as their representatives T Do we dwell in Lilliput? If not, let
them arise upon their feet, stretch- themselves to the full stature of men, and have a solemn
proclamation read, ere they march to fight for freedom once again. Look, Britous I to the kins-
men of your fathers, who were colonists in North America, taxed, or attempted to be taxed,
being unrepresented. They petitioned Parliament that it might not be so. and the prayer of their
petitions was rejected. Under these circumstances they asked their hearts what should freemen
Uo, and the reply wm. ark yonr tieords. These gave them freedom."
HOORAY FOR NINEVEH!
Mr. Latard stands for Southwark. That is well. Now,
opposed as Mr. Punch is both to Bribery and Intimidation,
he intends to practise both upon the present occasion
in the most unblushing manner. And first in regard to
bribery, he hereby gives the Southwark ians notice that if
they nobly lift their borough out of local mud by returning
Mb. Layard, Mr. Punch will take the borough under his
care, and make it his pet. He will send a special corres-
pondent over in two Hansoms, and have the place explored
and praised, will show that Horsemonger Lane Gaol is
superior! to the Hanging Gardens of Nineveh, that High
Street is far more elegant than the same street at
Oxford, and that strangers ought to come from all parts to
examine the dirty old inns with the galleries whence the
guests used to look down on bear-baits and private the-
atricals. In fact, Mr. Punch will invent Southwark, as
Geobge the Fourth invented the now evil-scented
Brighton. But, on the other hand, for Intimidation. Let
Mb. Layard find, on canvassing, that Southwark offers
him no chance, or let him be second on the poll, and
Mr. Punch solemnly pledges himself to take care of South-
wark in another sense. He will say no more—except that
twelve months from the day on which he declares war, a
decent Christian shall sooner admit that be lives in
Holywell Street, Strand, than in the Doomed Borough.
Now, Southwark, utrum horum mavit accipe, which it may
be convenient to you to have translated—Return Mb,
Austen Latabd, or what Nineveh is now, you shall be
at Christmas 1861.

HOW HE OUGHT "HOT" TO LOOK.
Excited Prompteb (to the Ghost of Hamlet's Fatlier, who is working himself up to
the most funereal asjiect he can assume). "Note then, Walker, LOOK ALIVE I
JOLLY OLD FELLOWS.
Amongst things not generally known, is the existence of anything in common
between the British Peerage and the Society of Friends, except two legs, two
arms, and the other particulars which constitute a common humanity. Longevity,
however, is a peculiarity in which the Lords partake with the Quakers, and wherein
the plain Quakers even hold a rank above that of the noble Lords. Whereas the
average life of the Peers is seventy years, that of the Friends is thus stated in a
letter to the Times signed Joseph Axles :—
"Permit me to enclose you the following ages of some deceased members of the Society of
Friends during the present year, taken from the obituary of the Fritnd, a Monthly journal, pub-
lished by that body. They are as follows:—84, M, 86, 85, 81, 86, 88, 87, 87, 88, 88, 89, 89, 89, 91,
91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, making a total of 2,128 years, with an average for each life of rather
more than 88} years.
"Fifty lives in the same period give 4,258 years, with an average of 86 per life."
The Quakers are said to be dying out; but if their average duration of life is as
great as that above given, they are likely to take some time in decaying. The
decline of Quakerism will operate to the disadvantage of Life Assurance Offices, if
it is the custom of the Friends to insure their lives, as feelings of friendship
might prompt them to do, even those who have no relations. The various
Provident Societies should endeavour to provide for the dissemination of the
doctrines of the Society of Friends.
As a general rule, the Quakers bear a high character; but in some cases, as
regards pecuniary transactions, this assertion must perhaps be discounted. Their
characteristic morality may in some measure account for their long life, bnt that
seems to be in a greater degree due to the good living, for the practice of which
they are equally celebrated. They cultivate a cheerful equanimity together with
the main chance; and being for the most part rich, or in easy pecuniary circum-
stances, take all other things easy, as we all ought to do, and probably should do,
if we could afford it. Care may nave killed a cat, but it does not kill Quakers,
who appear to quake very little with anxiety and mental perturbations.
The affluence and comfort to which the longevity of the Lords and that of the
Quakers may perhaps be ascribed cannot be readily supposed to account for that
of paupers, which another correspondent of the Times proves to be extraordinary.
Paupers are not certainly affluent, and they can hardly well be imagined as being
comfortable. But in a workhouse wherein a proper warmth is maintained, and
the diet is sufficient, a pauper who is no epicure, has no
pride, and no affections, might manage to lead a contem-
plative life of considerable ease and enjoyment. He
would be better off in every respect than a monk; and the
discipline of the Union would not involve the occasional
flogging to which he might be liable in a monastery. On
the whole, therefore, it is conceivable that the rich Quaker
and the noble Peer may be sometimes equalled or even
exceeded in happiness and consequent longevity by the
philosophical pauper. The man, therefore, who is ushered
into the world with a silver spoon in his mouth, may, in
some cases, not have much the advantage of the one who
'liters it with a wooden one.
HE BEGINNING OF SLAVERY'S END.
Thus far shall Slavery go, no farther;
That tide must ebb from this time forth.
So many righteous Yankees are there,
Who Good and Truth bold something worth,
That they outnumber the immoral
Throughout the States, on that old quarrel
That stands between the South and North.
The great Republic is not rotten.
So much as half; the rest is sound.
Most of her sons have not forgotten
Her own foundation; holy ground!
The better party is the stronger,
And by the worse will now no longer
Bear to be bullied, ruled, and bound.
The nobler people of the nation
The baser sort no more will stand,
Nor cringe to truculent dictation
Enforced, with strength of murderous hand,
By ruffians, for example, brawling
In Congress, who knock statesmen sprawling,
To back slave-soil against free laud.
Their higher-minded fellow creatures
Of all these brutes are tired, and sick
Of slavery's blaspheming preachers.
That snuffle texts with nasal trick,
To justify the abomination
That 'a cherished by their congregation,
Whose feet these canting parsons lick.
Enough of frantic stump-haranguing,
Invectives of a rabid Press,
Tarring and feathering, flogging, hanging,
To stop free mouths; the mad excess
Of human-fleshmongers tyrannic,
Who rant and revelin Satanic
Enthusiasm of wickedness'.
This is America's decision.
Awakening, she begins to see
How justly she incurs derision
Of tyrants, whilst she shames us free;
Republican, yet more slaves owning
Than any under Empire groaning,
Or ground beneath the Papacy.
Come, Pouth, accept the situation;
The change will grow by safe degrees.
If any talk of separation,
Hang all such traitors if you please.
Break up the Union f Brothers, never I
No; the United States for ever.
Pure Freedom's home beyond the seas!
The Portraiture of the Times.
We expect to see very shortly houses opened all over
the country, at which will be held out the following
refreshing announcement:—" A Glass op Ale and a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [December 8, 1860.
A BOON TO BRITISH TOURISTS.

HERE
£s\ ject
has been a pro-
Btarted for pro-
viding English tourists
with the means of
being worried, fleeced,
insulted, mobbed,
douaned, and done
while travelling, in the
most approved and
common Continental
manner, without their
having to cross the
Channel and incur the
pangs of sickness for it.
A company of million-
naires, who are so much
at a los3 to employ their
surplus cash, that they
have actually consented
to lay it out in charity,
have conceived the
happy notion of pur-
chasing a tract of land
not many miles from
London, and of con-
verting it forthwith
into as close a copy of
a Continental country
(say, for iustance, Prussia) as it is possible to fancy. The front iers of the district will be
guarded by a custom-house, which will be officered by persons of most aggravating insolence,
mid made extremely difficult and time-wasting to pass. Every box marked "fragile" will be
knocked about and stamped upon, and, if the words "with care" be added, will most pro-
bably be smashed. The searchers will pry into the most private books and writing-cases, and
unless they are well bribed will blab forth to the public whatever they spy out. A sovereign
duty will be charged upon a pennyworth of biscuits, and on lollipops there will be levied a
fivc-pound-note apiece. Moreover, to make things even more unpleasant, the tariff of
forbidden articles will extend to all such articles as tooth-brushes and hair-combs, which no
one but an Englishman would look upon as necessaries; and any one attempting to introduce
into the district Buch un-Continental luxuries as good tobacco and good soap, will at once be
handed over to the Staats Procurator, to be dealt with as the law (as he may twist it) may
direct.
To further the resemblance to a Continental country, and increase the torment and
annoyance of the tourist, (outers and commissioners will dog him at each step, and tread
upon his heels until he either kicks them round or else engages one of them to defend him
from the rest. In the former case, however, he of course must run the risk of being dragged
before some functionary of what is mis-called Justice, and being blackguarded from the
bench as well as fined for the assault. In the same way he will always have the law dealt
out to him, if be refuses to submit to an exorbitant extortion, or gets into a row in any
public room or vehicle, where any impudent intruder may tread upon his toes or coolly oust
him from his seat. He will be told such incivilities are the customs of the country, and
instead of, as a foreigner, being treated with some courtesy, he will be jeered at for the
grossness of his ignorance in not knowing them.
In order to make tourists feel as wretchedly uncomfortable as they generally do when they
first get away from home, and have not grown reconciled to foreign ways of living, the
district will be furnished with hotel accommodation of the fifth-rate German class, such as
Englishmen when travelling have too often to put up with after vainly seeking entrance at
every decent house. Here the tourist will be tortured with every inn-convenience, and will
get the worst of everything by paying the best price for it. His days will be made wretched
by bad cookery and glazed floors, such as British boots unvaryingly and inevitably skate
upon: and his nights will be made hideous by every kind of torment, from sweltering quilts
of eider-down to tribes of creeping things. To keep up the resemblance, he will find his
bed-room furnished with those copious and extensive arrangements for lavation, consisting
of a slop-basin and cream-jug full of water, for which Continental places have been long and
justly celebrated: and if he express himself in any way dissatisfied he will grandly be
informed that His (olfactorily) Highness the Doke of Dirtisiiirtzenberg lias his bath-
room fitted up on precisely the-same scale, and of course no common tourist can expect to
be supplied with greater luxuries than Dukes.
It having been observed that, as a rule, an English gentleman never seems so ill at ease as
at a table d'hote, of course this form of taking meals will be the only one obtainable.
Persons who object to eat aud drink in public, where they are liable to be annoyed by
every kind of travelling bore, will be allowed no opportunity of having quiet dinners served
in private rooms. Care too will be taken to make the table d'hote as long and tedious as
possible by having too few waiters and too many ill-served plats. For this purpose the
cooks will be selected from the worst of those on board the Rhenish steamboats, and among
their other blunders, special pains will daily in particular be taken to send round the poulet
a considerable time after the stewed plums have been consumed. Cheap home-made wines
turned sour will be supplied in foreign bottles, and be charged for as Johannisberg, Rude-
sheim, and Asmanhausen; while to complete the misery of the unfledged British tourist, the
reckonings will be made in foreign dialect and money, and the waiters will speak nothing but
their own peculiar polyglot, which we will defy the most accomplished linguist to understand.
Besides fleecing them with every possible extortion, proper means will be provided to ease
tourists of their money by having gambling tables opened at every stage and stopping-place,
say for instance, on the average at every half mile. Ball-rooms will be attached, after the
manner of the Continent; and the luxury of
dancing will nightly be permitted in an atmo-
sphere of bad tobacco, blazing gas, and blaring
brass. Masters of the Ceremonies will be ready
in attendance to introduce the stranger to the
doubtfullest of partners. In fine, no pains will
be spared to make the Tourists' District equal
to the Continent in every respect; and as it
must assuredly be better for Great Britain that
Englishmen should lay out their spare five pound
notes at home, instead of going abroad to do so,
it appears to us that every lover of his country
of course must wish the project every possible
success.
SPIRITUAL LUXURY AND DESTI-
TUTION.
Is an account given by the Post of what we
may take the liberty to call a mass-meeting of
Puseyit.cs belonging to the Propaganda of St.
George's-iu-thc-East, held in the Church of St.
Mary Magdalene, Munster Square, Regent's
Park, on the 27th ult., appears the following
statement:—
"At a fow momenta past eleven, a procession of priests
and choristers, nil habited in surplices, ouierged from the
vestry, at the east end ot the south aisle, thon moved
along the south aisle, aud down the middle aisle to the
altar, on which two largo burning candles were placea,
and a golden cross."
The Bishop or Londos the other day made
some judicious remarks *bout existing spiritual
destitution. In the presence of that, his Lord-
ship's attention is respectfully invited to the
above case of spiritual luxury. Burning candles
in the middle of the day 1 What spiritual extra-
vagance! They were not dips, either, or even
composition; wax no doubt. It is deemed unbe-
coming of clergymen to smoke cigars in public:
and what could they have wanted with lighted
candles of a morning in church? If to fumi-
gate the place with incense, they were guilty
of indulging in the most heterodox form of
smoking. Perhaps they smoked the golden cross
which they put upon the altar, that is, incensed
it, in which case they will incense the Bishop if
he smokes their cross and them. Let them go
to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, if they
want to smoke, or to some other respectable
public-house, aud take their lights there, or if
they want to amuse themselves with fireworks,
let off their Roman Candles on the Eifth of
November, the Eeast of St. Guy Eawkes, in
some more suitable place than church.
Times Change, and so do Fashions.
We think it was Swim' who said that "young
ladies troubled themselves a great deal more
about making nets to catch men than cages to
hold them." However, the Dean would have
changed his mind, if he had lived at the present
day, for we think the Crinoline is much more
of a cage than a trap; or might it be looked
upon as a combination of the two—both trap and
cage rolled into one. There may be some truth
in this, for there is no doubt that many a man
has been hooked by a woman's Crinoline strongly
against his will, and detained there much longer
than was agreeable to him.
Chinese Poetry.
It took a three hours' fight,
It cost four hundred men,
To change the Forts Taka
Into the Forts Take*.

no addition to the Ambassadorial dinner-party

PUNCH, Oil THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUPPY PLAYGROUNDS.
t saw it proposed not long
ago by some ladies, whose be-
nevolence exceeded their good
sense, to found a refuge for
poor dogs who were seen
,\hout the streets in a destitut e
condition, and either had no
iome to go to, or did not
know their way to it. Care
for the canine species almost
seemed in this proposal to be
carried to extremes; but it
really falls far short of what
is being done for the comfort
of the hounds which have the
)>appiness to be hunted by the
Honourable Mark Rolle, a
young gentleman who has not
long since come into his—
and man's—estate. Among
other highly valuable and
interesting particulars, the
Western Times informs us
that—
"Tho kennels stand on an acre
<ind half of ground, and are built
in the Elizabethan style of arthi-
t.-oture. There are three lodging-
r> -otus in each compartment for the
<!i>£8, which at present number a
hundred, and thero are aho an
inclosed yard, a boiling bouse,
feeding ditto, a wbelpiug room, an
hospital, granaries; cottages for
the huntsman, first whip and
kennel's man, and an abundant
t-upply of fresh-water at every
point. Last, though not loast,
there is a puppies' play-ground,
a hundred feet square, which is
enclosed with iron palisading, and where the young dops can disport themselves on the green sward, to the
dciightcf their canine hearts, without fear of molestation from envious dogs ol larger growth. Mr. McKilvie,
the clever landscape gardener, arranged tho ground, and ho lias oonverted an nlmost barren spot into a fertile
pltce of play-ground, in which hundreds of children in towns and cities would be glad to recreate themselves
after school-hours. Tho dogs are very much better lodged and cared for than many of our agricultural
labourers; for the hounds' dwellings are clean, warm, and woll ventilated, and they have plenty of fresh sir,
pure water, and good food. It is a great reflection on some landlords—both in this and other counties—that
labourers on their estates are certainly worso boused, and perhaps not anything like so well fed as tho Stovcn-

stono fox hounds. We should like to see tho same
attention bestowed on tho Agricultural Labourer in
those districts—where his comfort is so obviously over-
looked—as is bestowed on the Nobleman's Hounds."
"Happy dogs!" will be the exclamation of
the reader when he has perused this interesting
paragraph. The notion of providing Play,
grounds for his Puppies surely does great credit
to the person who first thought of it, and if the
Honourable Mark Rolle be that person, let
him have the credit which, surely, he deserves.
We mean nothing offensive when we speak of
credit; nor would we hint that in this instance
there may haply be some need of it. Tho
Honourable Mark Rolle is doubtless rolling
in riches, or he would surely not have thought,
of squandering his money upon Playgrounds for
his Puppies. So, we repeat, let him by all
means have the credit he deserves, for doing
what no other man that we have ever heard of
has ever done, or wished to do.
But surely the Honourable Mark will not
stop here. After carefully providing for the com-
forts of his dogs, he will surely throw a crumb
or two of comfort to his labourers. If we believu
the Western Times, and we don't sec why wc
shouldn't, their condition is not quite such as
their friends would wish to see it, and some-
thing might be possibly suggested to improve it.
If the Honourable Mark Rolls would but
treat his pack of labourers as he treats his pack
of hounds, there really would be nothing left for
them to ask of him. Clean kennels—that is,
cottages—commodious and warm, a hospital, and
plenty of pure water and good food, what more
could the heart of labourer desire P and when
to this is added a Playground for his Puppies—
we mean to say his children—the list of his
requirements is more than well complete.
Very Obliging.
Wuen a man wants money, or assistance,
the world, as a rule, is very obliging, and indul-
gent, and—lets him want it.
THE PRIZE OF FOLLY.
Field-Marshal Mr. Punch has for some time cherished the idea
of originating a Great Pool Exhibition, with prizes for the most dis-
tinguished and remarkable folly. But he has been almost turned from
his purpose, by observing that there would be little or no fair play in
the competition. There is one person who, as far as Mr. Punch can
perceive, would infallibly sack all the prizes. And that person is the
Gaol Chaplain. The F.M. never takes up a paper without reading
some evidence that the Gaol Chaplains would make the chances ol
other candidates quite infinitesimal. For instance, here is a bit from
the Daily Telegraph:—
"Jamfs Miles, a ticket-oHcavo man, was placod at the bar at Lamboth, charged
with carrying on a regular srstem of plunder on children, a species nt offence for
which be has been already subjected to three terms of imprisonment of three
months each, in addition to three years' ponal servitude. He was caught putting
his hand into the pocket of a boy named Stewart, and taking a shilling. When
taken to the station-house a number of children attended and identifled him as tho
person who had robbed them of various small sums of money and other property;
and amongst them was a little child nine years of ago, and off whose ears he tore a
pair of earrings of the value of 5*., and at the timo the poor little thing's ears were
bleeding from the torn wounds in the flesh."
Well, for this Mr. Miles, all things considered, F.M. Mr. Punch
would have prescribed, first, an opportunity of becoming very intimately
acquainted with that interesting object of natural history, the Nine-
Tailed Cat, and then, when medical attentions should have overcome
any little excitement that interview might have occasioned, Mr. Miles
should have been requested to devote the next ten years of bis valuable
life to some such work as the cleansing old sewers, and old cesspools
(like those which poison Brighton), always under such superintendence
as should ensure his not neglecting the interests committed to him.
But Punch and Chaplains do on this divide, for see here:—
"When searched there were found on the prisonor his ticket-of-leave and a letter
written by the Chaplain of Dartmoor Pruon to a gentleman in town, recommending the
prisoner at a proper tvbject to be tent abroad."
"Sent abroad." His ticket of leave exchanged for a passport duly
vise!, and this interesting Miles remitted to plunder little French
children, we suppose, or little Australian children, or little American
children, or to tear earrings out of the bleeding ears of little Dutch
children, who are rather famous for such ornaments. This is the Gaol
Chaplain's notion. He may well reply to Mr. Punch's proposal for the
Great Fool Prizes, by quoting Achilles:—
"Prises which none beside ourfelf could gain.
Should our immortal coursers take tho plain."
CALLING NAMES.
WnERE are the old familiar names P
John and Jake and Mart and James?
We never hear of a Susan now,
And it's not Bill, but Frederic, who follows the plough.
You '11 not travel far by Second Class rail,
But you are sure to encounter some Florence pale,
With much aspiration towards fashion in dress,
But with never a trace of loveliness 1
Our laundress's infants have no great charms,
Yet they have an Eugenie in arms;
While Victor Albert swings on a gate,
And munches his bacon in village state.
'T would be hard to say there is any blame,
There is no monopoly in a name;
But it strikes one sometimes as rather absuul
That contrast between the child and the word.
And what will it be when years have flown P
And these finely-named damsels are womeu grown?
When Eveltn Ada must polish the grates,
While Edith Amelia is washing the plates 1
Think of it then, ye sensible mothers,
Before you arrange fine names for the others;
For though not to-day, nor perhaps next Sunday,
It will happen as sure as my name's Mrs. Grundy.

PUNCH TO SOUTHWARK.
Now, Southwark, look alive. You have had one awful warning from
Mr. Punch, and this second is given in pure charity and kindness.
Make Layard safe. That's all. As for the other candidates, the fact
that they did not instantly withdraw, with apologies, the moment Mr.
Punch pronounced for Nineveh, fatally proves them to be utterly unfit
for any employment whatever, except perhaps carrying about sandwich
placards with *' Layard for Ever on them. Mr. Fawcett is the
best, but as the gentleman is unfortunately disqualified from examining
the pictures in Punch, it is clear that he can never be in a condition
exactly to appreciate the position of important questions. As for the
Conservative, he is simply and absurdly in the way. And as for a Mr.
Scovell, the third party, who seems to rest his claim upon having
done something to bring more barges to the wharves of his friends on
the Southwark side, he may be a very good Bargee, but has no claim
to be a Senator. We observed that one of his most strenuous sup-
porters cried out that "they didn't want none of La yard's Roman
stones there," and the intellectual observation shows the calibre of the
Scovellian set. Come, Southwark, throw over the trio of incapables,
and exalt yourself among boroughs by electing a Scholar, a Gentleman,
and a Statesman, who moreover has been a Minister, and (mark) will
be a Minister again.
By the way, some folly has been uttered about the " refutation " of Mr.
La yard's statements as to the wicked system by which our soldiers
were destroyed in the Crimea. So they were refuted, and thus: A man
says "1 saw twelve black men on the pavement." It turns out that one
of the twelve was on the kerb stone, and one was a sweep. Thus he has
been refuted. That was what the military pettifoggers did when they
tried to refute Mr. Layard. And (he Reforms he demanded were
subsequently effected. That is another refutation. Once more, South-
wark, do your duty, or . .
THE SPREAD OF FASHION.
(An Extract from a beautiful and fashionable Young Lady's Letter!)
"I Must tell you, dear, that I have got such a capital Crinoline. 1
wish I could send you the pattern. It is a perfect love—the most
angelic thing I ever saw—so light, and graceful, and easy, and so com-
fortable that one feels as though one was swimming through the air wit h
it. Of course, it is thoroughly French. I got mine at Boulogne in the
Grande Rue. It is beautifully made, and with an extra case, which
unbuttons down the front, and allows the steels to slip out, as easily
as you would pull a pair of scissors out of their leather sheath.
There is no stitching to the steels, I need not tell you. This is a very
great convenience, as it enables a lady to send her Crinoline to the wash
with the same ease as she would an ordinary petticoat. The body is
deeply gored all the way down on both sides, &c, &c."
[And to the letter runs on for twenty lines more, but we think tee
have printed quite enough to warn the gentlemen to prepare
themselves for a very Severe Winter.
A Current Conundrum for Universal Circulation.
Why can the Emperor or the French never be Pope?
Because by the simple fact, it is impossible three crowns can ever
make one Napoleon.

PUNCH'S PLAN FOR PREVENTING WAR.
{Registered Prospectus.)
Everybody knows why there is now no Duelling. People may some-
times talk nonsense about the world having grown more sensible and
humane, or they may talk other nonsense about its having been time
for gentlemen to discard duelling when it descended to the lower
orders, e. g. the celebrated case where the barber fought the linendraper
on a question of honour, and the shaver of beards winged the shaver
of ladies. The law may nave had a little to do with it, hut the law is
not always regarded with the reverence due to it, ladies smuggle lace,
peasants occasionally poach, and gentlemen gamble behind iron-doors.
There was something more than civilisation, pride, or respect for the
law required to put an end to private war.
Life Assurance did it.
Every decent man's life is assured, and policies are declared forfeit
if the decent man is put out of the way by a duel. So nobody
challenges anybody, or if any wild Irishman, vicious Frenchman, or any
other valueless life were to invite an assured life to the combat, the
assured life would knock the other life down, and then assign him to
the police.
Why not try this excellent remedy on a large scale.
Let a Company be formed to be called the Tiirone Assurasce
Society.
But as kings never die, the object of the Society must be to make
a king comfortable in his circumstances by paying him a bonus at
specific times, and by advancing him money on the usual conditions of
assurance offices. His reign would then be always happy and comfortable.
But, if he goes to war, the Policy shall be void, and the Throne
Company is to have a right to confiscate his taxes, and send the other
kings, who have been his securities, to quod.
The speculation would answer uncommonly well, for subjects would
be too happy to see that the premiums, which preserve them from the
miseries of war, were regularly paid up.
The Office would not be liable if a King were kicked out by his own
subjects, «s a Sovereign with the command of money ought to be able
to make his people perfectly content.
Sovereigns would of course have to submit to the usual examination.
A King proposing to assure might be asked:—
1. How about your Constitution P
2. Have you ever been afflicted with Divine Right, or any other
insanity P
3. Have any of your ancestors died violent deaths, as by the block,
guillotine, private strangulation, &c.
4. Are you subject to Priests, or any similar affliction P
5. Give the name of your political adviser, and say how long he has
known you.
6. Are you assured in the Holy Alliance, or any other old office P
Further details will be published in due course. In the meantime,
Mr. Punch, Provisional Director and Manager, invites the consideration
of Capitalists to his scheme. It appears to him to be a noble idea,
entirely in conformity with the spirit of the age, and highly calculated
to bring about the Millennium.
N.B. The valuable service of Mr. John Bright will, if possible, be
retained for the Actuary's Department. ,
A STINGING HEADDRESS.
We read in one of the Magazines of Fashion as follows:—
"Pretty little caps are worn of a round form encircled with a ruche."
Now, from what we recollect of our French, a ruche is a hive, and
we can hardly imagine that as being about the most becoming straw
bonnet that a lady could wear. We know that many of the beautiful
sex carry their love of the fashions to a degree of madness, but still to
encircle one's face with a hive, would be decidedly so certain a method
of getting "a bee in one's bonnet" that we cannot believe any woman
in her senses would think of lending her countenance to it. It is true
that bees delight to live in the neighbourhood of flowers, such as
gallantry delights in poetically supposing bloom perennially on lovely
woman's features; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether the most flori-
cultural beauty would like to expose the roses and tulips of her
countenance to the risk of being stung, even if she could be sure
that from the honied result there would be distilled for her the very
"sweetest of bonnets."
Attempt by a Negro.
There were two learned negroes in Kentucky, of whom one was
named after the great founder of the Roman Empire, and the other
bore the name of his assassin. Brutus, smoking a cigar, was accosted
by Julius Cesar. "What—you smoke P "t asked the latter nigger.
"I do," said Brutus, offering his friend a whiff. "St chew, Brute P"
was the exclamation of Cjesar.
The Sheddon Case.
Ask you what's the case of Sheddon?
"Was a certain pair a wed one
Seventy years, or more, ago?"
Fourteen days the brave Miss Sheddon
And the lawyers talked and read on:
Then 8ir Cresswell answered, "No."
To "make Assurance doubly sure."—Don't take advantage of
the days of grace.

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXXIX.-CONCERNING THE CIVILIANS IN THE
REIGN OF HENRY THE SEVENTH.
iVKREi.T accurate as our de-
scriptions hitherto have been,
the; will henceforth be immea-
surably surpassed in that par-
ticular. For our knowledge
of Costume we have no longer
to rely on broken-nosed
old effigies, and half-illegible
black-letter chronicles. The
paint brushes of Holbein, of
Rubens and Vandyke will
henceforth, says a writer,
"speak volumes to the eye:"
and as these volumes will be
further enriched by the de-
scriptive pencil of our artist,
they will surpass all that has
hitherto been added to the
history of costume by our
pen.
According to the chroni-
olers, the clothes worn at the
close of the fifteenth century
were so foolish and fantastical
that, with persons of dis-
tinction, it was difficult to
distinguish one sex from the
other. This indeed might
have been said with almost
equal truth of other eras in
our history, but in the time
of Henrt thb Seventh it was specially made applicable, not merely
by the fashions, but by the very names of the garments which were
worn, and which were called, as well as cut, the same for male and
female use. Thus in a curious old manuscript called T* Boke of
Curtasye, the chamberlain is ordered to provide against his master's
uprising "a clene sherte and breche, a pettycote. a doublette, a long
cotte, a stomachere, hys hozen, hys socks, and hys schoen." The
order in which these articles were usually put on is indicated in
another writing called "y* Bole of Kervynge," which, in language
somewhat culinary, gives the following quaint recipe, whereof the title
might be written How to Dress a Dandy.
"Wnrme your soverayno hys potticotte, his doublett. And his stomacher, and
then putt on hys Dozen, and then hys Bchone or slippers, then stryten up hys hosen
mannerly, and tyo them up, and then lace hys doublett hole by bole."
It may not be unfairly questioned whether en revanche for the
betaking of their husbands to wear stomachers and petticoats, the
ladies now and then were tempted to try putting on the breeches; in
which practice there perhaps may not have been such peril, when there
was no such refuge extant as Sir Cresswell Cresswell's Court.
A curious cargo of descriptions of the dresses then in fashion is con
vcyed to us in Barclay's famous Ship of Fooles, which was launched
in print by Pynson in the year 1508. Among other particulars con
cerning the nobility we hear of "gorgeous parties" (as they would
now be called)—
"Whose necks wore charged with collars and with chaines,
In golden withes, their fingers full of rings:
Their necks naked almost unto the rallies,
Their sleeves blazing like unto a crano's wings."
Besides their almost feminine passion for fine jewellery, the gentle-
men of this age were vastly proud of their fine linen, and to show their
shirt sleeves used to slash their coats. Another way in which they
effected this display was by severing their coat-sleeves into two or
more divisions, which were tied together by means of "points," or
laces, between which the shirt sleeve, being made quite loose and full,
was suffered to peep out. The hosen too were sometimes slashed and
puffed above the knee, or differently coloured there to the portion
underneath: a fashion that foreboded the severance of the hosen into
stockings ami trunk hose, which division in the coarse of the next
century took place.
Instead of the long shoes of the last preceding reigns, the feet were
now encased in enormously broad beetlecrushers, the toes whereof says
Pahadin, "did oftentimes exceed the y* measure of a good foote," so
that men who had good feet could hardly have walked with comfort in
them. Clumsy as they were, however, they must at least have been
more comfortable than the long-toed shoes, which sometimes for con-
venience were chained up to the knees, so that dancers must have
jangled like the men at minor theatres who do hornpipes in stage
fetters. Indeed, for aught we know, the dandies may have danced to
their own music, for we have said that peals of bells were sometimes
worn upon the baldrick; and when their jingling was added to the
jangling of the knee-cbains, we can fancy what a promenade concert
was produced. One of the old balladists draws notice to this fashion,
in lines which have been parodied by some more modern poet, but
which were originally printed in black-letter, thus:—
"ftine a eoacr>horse to ffihatinge its Crosse,
9no see Uorfi Com $ol>oie figgeo out in fulle forte:
Wlitl) belli on hits baluricfte anb chaines to his tots,
ftjee shal hane mustrk fohertucT he goes."
We should add that as a sort of stepping place between the long
shoes, and the wide ones, a shoe had been in fashion about five fingers
in length, and at the toe extending to nearly a hand's breadth. In
some of the old manuscripts
this shoe is termed a slipper,
and in winter doubtless the
name was not inapplicable.
From their shape these
shoes or slippers were de-
nominated duck-bills; but
as far as we can learn, there
is no proof extant that
volunteers made use of
them in practising the
goose-step.
To jump from toe to top,
it must be mentioned that
the nobles wore their hair
so long that it fell below
their shoulders, thus re-
viving the fashion of the
time of Henry the First.
Faces, we are told expressly,
"were shaved clean," aud
it is just possible that they
were sometimes washed so:
of which fact, however, in
the absence of good proof
that the nobility in general
were then well off for soap,
we must entreat their spirits
to suffer us a doubt.
Apparently tbe hood had
almost disappeared, though
jn outlandish country places
it doubtless was still visible; just as now-a-days one sees in the
ball-room at Old Fogyborough, the blue coats and brass buttons
which were once the go at Aiinacks. For head-cover the dandies
wore broad felt hats and caps, and things which were called bon-
nets, made of velvet, cloth, and iur. These bonnets were scarcely
more commendable for elegance than are their spoon-shaped namesakes
of the present day. They chiefly were conspicuous for the absence of
good taste, and the presence of a monstrous plume or bunch of feathers,
which made a dandy's head look almost like a peacock's tail. That
these plumed head-dresses were purchased quite as much for ornament
as they were for use, may be inferred from the fact that they are very
frequently shown slung behind the back, covering it completely from
the shoulder to the knee. In these cases the wearer, or we should
more rightly say the bearer, perched on his head a little cap about as
large as a muffin, or else covered his crown with a few inches of gold
net.
Peculiar also to this period was a peculiarly shaped cap, which card-
players will hardly need us to describe, for a drawing of it is shown on
each of the four knaves. Other queer-shaped hats and caps were like-
wise then in fashion, some of which our artist, with the help of his old
manuscripts, has been able to depict. From these glimpses at the
truth we think our readers will be quite as much prepared as we
ourselves are to credit the old chronicler, who informs us that "ye
small boys did make fun of ye grete folke, and when a dandy passed
them, dyd crie out'Who's youre hattere P'

Positive and Comparative.
"I Declare," said Chief Justice Cockbohn, losing for once his
good temper, "that woman is more stubborn than a mule," alluding to a
certain lady's maid, who is always bringing actions against everybody,
and who is the terror and bete noire, in consequence, of both Bench and
Bar; "Yes, I repeat that that poor misguided woman is more stubborn
than a mule." Glad of the opportunity, Baron Bh am well immedi-
ately remarked, "Exactly so, Brother Cockbukn—the comparative of
Mule is of course Mulier?'

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ORGANS AND ORGAN-PLAYERS.

he art of (street) organ-
playing, dear Mr.
Punch, has attained
to such a degree of
popularity at the pre-
sent day, especially
in the suburbs of
London, that, know-
ing as I do from a
constant perusal of
your pages the great
interest you take in
the subject, I venture
to offer a few sugges-
tions for your con-
sideration; and my
remarks will perhaps
have greater weight
if 1 mention, with all
due modesty, that I
am myself a performer
of some experience on
that noble instru-
ment, as I" have fre-
quently in my younger
days, by the offer of
small coins, induced
the gentleman who
attended our house
to allow me to turn
the handle of his
organ.
I would suggest
that, with regard to
the performance of
the most favourite
airs,—as, for exam-
ple, // Balen, or the
Power of Love, — it
should not be considered necessary to play them oftener than about twenty-five times each
in any one place, as a more frequent repetition occasionally produces a feeling of monotony;
and if the organ should happen to be revoltingly out of tune, as might sometimes be the ca9e.
the performer should consider himself limited to a fifteenth repetition of those ever-fresh ana
beautiful melodies. In cases where the player
accompanies the organ with his voice,—where a
pedal passage is introduced,—where there is a
monkey obbligatot—in short, where any ges-
ticulation is required from either performer,—
the duration of the entertainment should be
limited to half an hour before each house, as a
longer performance is an unreasonable tax on
the physical powers of the executants. Iu case
of sickness in any house which he might ■Mtta
1 think it should certainly be left to the judg-
ment and good taste of the performer to deter-
mine how long he should play; and no remon-
strances ought, under any etresua-Ttances, to be
offered by the inhabitants. I trust that these
few suggestions will be received in the spirit in
which they are offered by those whose arduous
business it is to perambulate the streets for our
gratification, and I hope that they will meet with
due consideration from all admirers of the Italian
school of organ-playing.
"I remain, dear Mr. Punch, very truly yours,
"A LOVER OF THE 'DlVINE ART.'"
KILT, NOT KILTED.
Tub Tralee Chronicle has a remarkable con-
clusion to its record of a recent interment.
We have simply altered the names of the place
where it took place, and of the deceased:—
"The remains wero deposited in the family tomb at
Blunderbuss Castle, which, of tho many warm hearts
we have known in life, now slumbering in its timo-
honoured cemetery, holds not one which beats with a
warmer or a kinder pulse than that of Timothy Thadt
Mlxligan."
How the Tralee Chronicle justifies the inter-
ment of a gentleman whose heart is still beating
with a warm and kind pulse, or indeed what the
above elegantly complicated sentence means at
all at all, Mr. Punch knows not, and merely
submits the scrap as a Curiosity of Irish
Literature.
THE THREE TAILORS—TO WIT.
We arc three Tailors of Tooley Street, and trusty men are we,
And of the people of England we claim the mouthpiece to be—
Of the people of England in general, and of Southwark in partic'lar,
And we do hereby of our principles make this confession aurie'lar.
As touching this here election, that's just about coming off here,
We don't want never no Fawcetts, and no Layabds to come and
scoff here
At our eminent local wharfingers, and westry respectabilities,
Which to us, the Three Tailors of Tooley Street, has showed the
utmost civilities.
We thinks as how Afsley Pellatt was the likeliest man for our money,
Wich the bloated aristocrats in the 'Ouse they may have considered
him funny,
'Cos his righteous indignation at times to such lengths bore him,
He's been knowed to bonnet the hon'rable gent upon the bench before
him.
But since we can't have Pellatt, why as next best we '11 have Scovell,
Wich the rights and wrongs of the borough in course he's sure to
know veil,
And if he han't dug up bulls with wings and uniform 'scriptions
Ninnyvite,
He's a tradesman aginst whom nobody hasn't nothing to insinivite.
He ain't like to trouble the 'Ouse oratorically or wocally,
But what's the odds of that, if he does the right thing, locally?
We don't want a flighty Member, to talk about Milan or Moussul,
But a party as can say ditto to Loess Palmerston and John Russell,
And the more he says ditto to them, why the better they 're sure to
like him.
And the less inclined to say no if any chance should strike him
In the way of a nice little job for Tooley Street or the Borough—
(Wioh we 're all independent westrymen and likes to see things done
thorough).
Then this here Layard's as poor as a mouse, and Scovell he is rich,
And in course at an election time he's safe to behave as sich,
And to open the public 'ouses and pay canvassers, agents, and runners,—
(Wich we're independent westrymen, and scorns to be any man's
dormers).
Then this here Layard's always a gettin' hisself in hot water,
And a goin' in at the big-wigs, and, in course, mostly catching a Tartar,
But Scovell will mind his own business—wich that's Southwark, aua
nothin' but it,
And where there's a shindy he '11 behave like a sensible man and cut it.
For our part we haven't no confidence in your learned men and writers:
There was old Charley Napier was all very well,—though he was
one of your fighters,—
But still he was pleasant and affable, and hadn't no pride about him,
But as for tliis here Layabd,—we don't know, but somehow we doubt
him.
He's been a sort of a rolling stone; and we haven't a great opinion
Of a man that spends his time digging rubbish, not worth an 'inion,
Instead of sticking to business, like Scovell, and making a fori in',
And spending it on his Constituents—a thing this here Layakd falls
short in.
So altogether, as leaders of opinion in the Borough,
We recommend the Electors to give Scovell their confidence thorough,
And the motter we put on our banners, and the ticket on which we
start is,
"Here's Scovell the Local Candidate, and no Extraneous parties."
Their First Introduction.
There is a respectful distance between the Duke of York, as he
stands on the top of his brazen column, and the "Victory that is dis-
tributing plaster of Paris crowns from the top of the Guards' Memorial
half a cab-stand behind him. As was his wont, the Duke is turning
his back upon Victory. They might have pulled him round, just to
have allowed him to see what Victory was lite

AUSTRIA IN RAGS.
Here's a pretty mess the thrones are in
upon the Continent! Nearly all the Royal trea-
suries have stuck over their doors the words
"Suspension of cash payments!" The Pope
has scarcely a crazia, the Sultan hardly a
piastre, and the Emperor of Austria scarce
a kreutzer at his banker's. What's to be done,
and who? that is the momentous question.
Well, liere, let us see. The 1'orE sends round
his old tiara to beg for a few pence; the Turk
borrows a few millions at doubled interest from
the French: and the Austrian, yes, this is how he
hopes to raise the wind: readers of the Daily
Neics had the account I a -1. week thus stated:—
"A docroe dated Hehonbrun, Nov. 17, and signed
'Francis JostTH,' authorises the in-mo of notes of tho
vaiuo of fuurjicnce. These bit* of pajxir nro to have
tho character of a now Austrian money, and their falsifi-
cation or forgery is to bo punishable according to the laws
of the curroucy of higher denominations."
Well, these little bits of piper will serve, at
all events, to show how the wind blows, although
they mayn't much help to raise it. Fancy, what
would people say if the Old Lady of Thread-
needle Street were reduced to such a state that
the Government had to issue fourpenny bank
notes for her! Imagine the disgust of a
lirompton 'buss conductor on receiving a small
scrap of rather dirty paper, and being told it
was a legal equivalent lor fourprnce! (Hythe
way, the slang for this sum is a Joey." So the
notes are not unaptly signed by Francis-Joseph:
only Frank is short for Francis, and a note
which passes current for a Joey and a Franc,
should be worth fourteenpence we think instead
of fourpence.) Certainly, the Austrians must,
be on the brink of bankruptcy, or they would
not be driven to such desperate expedients to
keep their heads above water. Their credit
must indeed be a tottering concern if they
have not hing but such flimsy props as fourpenny
bank notes for it. In spite of all their careful
cooking of the national accounts, it cannot be
denied, that they are done to rags when we find
the State is issuing fourpenny bank-notes.
WOOD DEMON.
'* Mr. Ptjkch,
"I hear a great deal of Spirit-Rapping Mediums and 'Table-
Turning'; in fact, I hear of little else; for up our way—that is.Tslington
—we have several societies more or less devoted to the mysteries of a
stance. Now of the rapping I know nothing, nor of the Mediums
either, except that my boy George, who learns Latin, tells me the
word means 'a go between,' which information quite reconciles me to
my want of acquaintance with such folks. But of tables you may—
when I tell you I am an auctioneer and broker—believe I know some-
thing. Lor, bless me! what lots of tables I have had under my hands:
tables of all sorts—and there's a tolerable variety. There's the
universal round, the economic Pembroke, the family dining, the
frequent loo, and others that are only occasional. How often have I
seen a bevy of brokers standing round, say, a 'rosewood loo,' leaning
more or less heavily on it as they considered its value or tested its
workmanship, each doubtless thinking of turning it over to some
customer; and yet all this so frequently have I seen without one
eccentric attempt on the part of any table to turn or move!
"Now, Mr. Punch, to speak in a brokerly way, I am a 'man in
Sossession* of my senses, and I want to know why a committee of
rokers should not be called to give evidence as to their belief in the
disposition of tables to turn, so that their convictions on the subject
may throw some light on the seeming choice that spirits have to affect
tables above all other articles. In the meantime the Spiritualists
might refer to their Mediums for information on the same point; and
really if they don't give some satisfactory reason, the sooner the tables
are turned upon them and their nonsense the better, for with us
brokers the matter is getting to be serious. One old lady, last week,
refused a splendid mahogany square because it 'ran' easily on its
castors, being, as she affirmed, afraid it had been in a 'turning family.'
Now, Mr. Punch, you can easily see this is likely to affect our business
materially, so I do hope you will do all you can for us, and
"I am, Mr, Punch, yours to command,
"A. Praser."
PAYMASTERS OF THE INDIAN ARMY.
One day last week a respectable looking man named Rowland
Mucklestone was indicted at the Central Criminal Court for having
"applied to his own use a cheque that had been intrusted to him for a
specific purpose." He was found guilty—guilty of felony!
Many people will be astonished to find that the appropriation by one
person of money given him with a commission to administer it to
others is so serious a crime as that which felony amounts to.
Not but what everybody who is any better than a rogue feels em-
bezzlement to be a peculiarly bad sort of theft, because it is not, merely
dishonest, but also dishonourable. But then it is sometimes practised
by gentlemen who hold so decent a position!
There are certain persons notorious for being bad paymasters, of
whom it is commonly said that the money which passes through their
hands sticks to their fingers. In other words, they commit a temporary
embezzlement. Yet many of them shuttle on without, being even
shunned and avoided. Some even fill very high situations.
The Delhi prize money remains unpaid. It is in the hands of parties
who, like Mr. Mucklestone, though not convicted <f felony, have
been intrusted with that money for a specific purpose—the purpose of
distributing it among the soldiers who won it three years a»o. Who
are the official rogues that are at present embezzling the Delhi prize
money? Who are the swindlers in Government situations of whom
it may be affirmed, to their infamy, that the money due to brave
men, who won it with wounds and blood, by unexampled heroism, is
sticking to their fingers f
Spirituel, and Spiritual.
Who is the most extraordinary "Medium" in England P

A Bare Pack to give
Tongue.
Mr. Marsh informs
us that out of the voca-
bulary of the English
language, which now
consists of nearly a
hundred thousand words,
the generality of intel-
ligent people contrive to
get along with not more
than three or four thou-

SUICIDE AND MANSLAUGHTER.
Yesterday, at an extraordinary meeting of the Society for the
Amendment of the Law, a paper was read by Mr. Punch, Q.C., on
the subject of "Crowner's Quest Law." The learned gentleman
began by directing the attention of the Society to the subjoined verdict
of a Coroner's Jury touching the death of an unfortunate man who
had died by his own act. The deceased, Thomas Bates, aged sixty-
one years, a cabinet-maker, disabled, out of work, and destitute, had
applied at the Shoreditch Workhouse for admission as an in-door
pauper. He had been turned away with an order of Is. M. per week and
a four-pound loaf. This was all he had to live upon. He hanged himself.
"The jury found—"That the deceased committed suicide by hanging: and the
furors do further say that the act was committed while he was in a state of unsound
mind, through his feelings being operated upon by being refused admission into the
workhouse of Shoreditch."
Mr. Punch then reminded the Society that only the week before, in
the case of John Watson, sixty-three years old, starved to death in the
streets, another Jury had agreed to a special verdict to the effect—
"That the deceased died from the effects of exhaustion and the want of the
common necessaries of life, iToduced by exposure In the public streets, death
having been accelerated by the great neglect of the parochial authorities of St.
Leonard, Shoreditch, when the deceased was iu a state of utter destitution and
without a home."
With these cases before them, the Society would be prepared for a
proposition that an enactment should be framed for the better regu-
lation of the verdicts of Coroners' Juries. If the driver of a locomotive
engine, or a railway guard, happened, by the smallest oversight or least
want of precaution, to cause the loss of human life, a verdict of man-
slaughter was returned against him. A surgeon who had the mis-
fortune to kill his patient by an error in judgment, incurred, in the
event of an inquest, the same impeachment. This was, it should be,
on the principle which some gentlemen avowed, that punishment
should regard acts, and not motives. At least this was as it should be,
so far as it went. But it did not go far enough—on that principle,
everybody who had the misfortune to kill another ought to be hanged.
Hang misfortune. There ought to be no such thing as homicide by
misadventure. Hang unlucky individuals for the protection of the
mass; hang consideration; hang justice and all that twaddle! How-
ever, a new law would be required for this purpose: a law which
would declare the accidental killing of anybody wilful murder.
Observation of a
University Tailob.—
It is not always the gent
who takes the highest
honours that gets the
most credit.
There was this difficulty in the way of such a law; that it would put
and an end to the railways and abolish the medical profession. The
anxiety of gentlemen to enforce responsibility would deprive them of
engineers, guards, and doctors. As regards these persons it would be
best that the law should remain as it was. Unfortunately it generally
turned out that indictments for manslaughter in cases of homicide by
misadventure could not be sustained, and the accused got off, after
temporary anxiety and incarceration, with mere ruin. An express
statute, therefore, might be passed declaring all acts whatsoever, of
casual omission or commission, resulting in any one's death, man-
slaughter. The only objection to this step was derived from cases
such as those of the Shoreditch paupers of whom one died, and the
other was driven to self-destruction by the neglect of workhouse
authorities. The projected law might subject officials to a charge of
manslaughter for every wretched pauper whom they turned away
from the workhouse to starve in the streets. This would never do.
All law was primarily intended for the protection of the ratepayers:
and relieving officers and poor-law guardians should enjoy a special
exemption from liability under the new Act. He would add exemption
from liability under the existing law; for if coroners' juries are em-
powered to return verdicts of manslaughter against careless railway
servants and doctors, they also have the right, if they choose to exer-
cise it, of sending negligent officials of workhouses, at whose doors lie
the deaths of paupers, to take their trial, at least, for felony.
Mr. Punch concluded by suggesting another alteration in Crowner's
Quest Law." He would ask—Did a man, who, knowing what he was
about, jumped out of a burning ship into the waves and perished,
commit an act of felo de tet If not, what should his drowning him-
self be legally described as? "Justifiable Suicide P" Juries might
perhaps be allowed to return that verdict in the case of a pauper who
had hanged himself at once in preference to dying slowly of cold and
famine. Verdict of respectable Coroner's Jury of the Future—
Justifiable Suicide! If you hold all suicide unjustifiable, you should
make starvation impossible.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. December 15, 1860.
PITY THE POOR POPE I

orthy Gentleman, drop a tear of pity for a
Sovereign Pontiff, who hardly has a shilling
wherewith he may bless himself, which 1 haven'*,
touched a fi'-pun* note, your honour, lawks! I
can't say when; for it's them low blayguard
feliers who say they're my protectors as takes
care of all my property, and it's gospel-true
they've eat in' of me out of house and Rome,
and here am 1 reduced to try and earn my living
in a foreign land, which it's hard on a old man
to sleep upon a doorstep, while Emperors as
should know better snaps their fingers in my
face, and acts as though they had been born
with a tiara on their heads, 'cause I'm the right-
ful owner, as you know, kind Gentleman, and
they've robbed me of my crownd, and not left
me so much as five shillings in my pocket; so
drop a tear of pity, if you please, kind Gentle-
man, and drop a copper too, and receive my
benediction, for you see my Peter is a getting
dreadful slow in the co!-lection of his Pence for
me, and I'm growing a old man, and when 1
wants a crust of bread it's hard to have to work
for it by lying on a flag-stone; so drop a tear,"
&c, &c.
Such, done into plain English, may be the
words in choice Italian that, ere many months
are past, may meet the ear of loungers in
Lei-ces-ter-r-r-r-e Sciuarr, and attract their gene-
rous notice to a seedy but still rotund and sleek-
faced elderly person, who has been sketching
loaves and fishes in chalk upon the pavement.
The circular letter lately issued for collecting
Peter's Pence shows clearly that His Holiness
is on his last financial legs. A man mast be getting hard-up, when he has to beg for coppers; and if this circular letter fails to square the
Pope's accounts, Leicester Square, we fancy, is the only resource left him. Persons who can't raise the wind generally prescribe themselves
a sudden change of air: and if with all their brass his Cardinals can't get tin for him, the Holy Father, speaking figuratively, will be forced
ere long to hook it. Without money of course he cannot pay his mercenaries, and without their help he cannot long retain his throne. If
the Pope can't fill his purse he must vacate the Holy See, and come—as Punch predicted in his Fourteenth Volume (see page 146)—sailing
in his cockboat across the British Channel.
Other reasons than financial ones there are, too. for his going. Of those whom he still calls the "true sons of the Church," there are
not a few who wish to see him farther; and would if need be lend a hand, or a foot even, to send him there. Besides, the worm is growing
wiser than it was, and Popes no longer are necessities of spiritual life to people. Here is the Emperor op the French taking a leaf from
English history, and threatening to take any Pope's Bull by the horns that enters his dominions. Louis, like our Henry, seems thoroughly
prepared to try on the tiara, ana if the cap fits we have small doubt that he will wear it. "Every Emperor his own Pope" will be soon
the pope-ular motto, and as for poor old Papa Pics we fear that his rebellious sons will play a little game with him of "no child of mine,"
and get up a collection of more kicks than Peter's Pence for him.
OUR WONDERFUL ALLIES.
Among the people whom PRniCE Alfred lately had the honour of
being introduced to in his Visit to the Cape, was a native who, according
to the Timtt and other newspapers, rejoiced in the imposing title of
"Kino Moshesh." Now there is something in a name, despite Miss
Julie ft seeming doubt of it; and as that of Moshesh" may possess
somewhat of interest to some few of our readers, we propose, as we
have nearly half an hour to spare and nothing else we want to do in it,
to furnish a few details concerning this Kino Moshesh, who has been
exchanging salutations with our Prince.
By a Black Book, which is studied in high Hottentot society with
scarcely less avidity than our Red Book is in ours, it is stated that
Kino Moshesh sprang from Negro extraction, and that on either
side his family is of very ancient date. One writer pretends to trace
in a direct line the genealogy of this black sovereign up to our Black
Prince; while another strives to strengthen this preposterous assertion
by showing how Kino Moshesh levies black mail on his subjects,—a
practice which was once pursued extensively in England, and which
proves that certain of the ancestors of Moshesh must have had
acquaintance with the customs of that country, if indeed they were not
of true British blood and birth. Other allegations, equally absurd.
hav» been made to prove his Majesty of right royal descent; ana
several of the alienators appear inclined to shed some rather croco-
diley tears at their failing to establish this important point. We
regret we cannot say muoh to assist them in the matter; but seeing
that his skin is somewhat of the sootiest, we think that there are
certainly some grounds for the conjecture that Kino Moshesh is
remotely connected with the potentate now known as Old King Coal.
A Portrait of Kino Moshesh has recently been published in a
Blackamoor Book of Beauties, which, we believe, has an extensive
Ctffre circulation, and has portraits of the chief celebrities of Fashion
at the Cape. If the King be half as black as he is painted in this
picture, he need not fear that London smoke would injure his com-
plexion; and as fresh troupes of Niggers are continually coming, it is
not impossible he may be induced to visit us. According to his
portrait, Kino Moshesh's Court costume combines Simplicity with
Elegance in a remarkable degree. It consists of a dress coat and pants
of the last century, worn over a suit of bears'-grease. For crown, Kino
Moshesh usually sports a porkpie hat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW LINE OF ART.
ook, Mr. Punch. I'm a plain
man, and I oome of a pliin
sort. My father was a tailor,
and so, Sir, am I. He was
not ashamed to own it, and
no more am I: and nowa-
days, it isn't everyone who
keeps a tailor's shop, I think,
can say as much. This ad-
vertisement, at any rate, ap-
pears to me to prove so:—
BENJAMIN BOUNCE, No.
1, Swells Street, W By Special
Appointment to the Queek. And
Breveted by the Empkesh or the
French, Artist Id Draping the
Heal Figure. Court, Diplomatic,
Military and Naval Uniform*.
Practical experience, combined
with a scientific knowledge of ex-
toraal anatomy and the definite
proportions and forms of the hu-
man figuro, gives him confidence in
soliciting patronage.
"Merely altering the name
(for I don t want you to puff
a rival in the trade, or, as
, Mb. Bounce would doubt-
less call it, the 'Profession')
I copy this verbatim from a
late number of The Journal
qf the Society of Arts— rat her
a fine vehicle for a tailor's
advertisement, but as an 'artist,' Mr. Bounce, of course, has claims upon its
columns. Being a plain man and not having the 'confidence* or brass of Mr.

Bounce, I own I should have feared to publish such a
notice, lest somebody should question me about my
education, and examine me to see how far I really had
a title to the titles I assumed. For instance, might
not one inquire in what studio Mb. Bounce formed liis
acquaintanceship with art, and acquired his proficiency
'in draping the real figure?' And when one finds him
bragging of his 'scientific knowledge of external ana-
tomy,' might not one inquire, without being thought rude,
under what physician his studies were pursued, and in
what dissecting-room the 'practical experience' he boasts
of was obtained P I confess that for myself, 1 should not
much have liked to run the risk of such inquiries, which
through the medium of Punch or any other ugly customer,
are certain to be put. For fine words fail in general to
hide a false pretence, and no more serve to butter cus-
tomers, than they do to butter parsnips. Besides, Sir,
after all, an 'artist in draping,' is but another phrase for
'draper, and in spite of all the chaff about a man in our
trade being but the ninth part of a man, a ' tailor' is every
bit as good and high-born-sounding a title as a 'draper.' -
"At least, so thinks your obedient, humble servant,
"8nip."
"F.S. With all his genius for fine language, I wonder
what new phrase Ma. Bounce could find for 'cabbage?'
Does he bid his shopmen—I beg pardon, hisemploye"t—only
mention it as 'greens f'"

At the Repeal meeting "The" O'Donoghue complained

A BOTTLEHOLDER'S ADVICE TO HIS JOHNNt
BEING AN INTERCEPTED LETTER THAT SHOULD HAVE REACHED TUB
F M S T THE DAY BEFORE HE RECEIVED THE
DEPUTATION ON SPANISH INTOLERANCE.
"My dear John,
"I see that you have promised to receive a deputation of
serious blokes who feel aggravated because a couple of Spaniards, one
a soldier and the other a hatter, are being persecuted in their own
country for taking to Protestantism. Now. as your Premier, I am
particularly desirous that yon should, if possible, avoid making another
mull just now; and therefore'this letter comet hopping' (as the
woman said), that you will be pleased to mind what you are about.
My having recently declared you to be rather, on the whole, superior
to Solomon in wisdom, and to Hampden in patriotism, entitles me to
speak a friendly word to you, to say nothing of the increased responsi-
bility which I took npon myself by that generous declaration.
"I am the more nervous about it, because there is a theological
elephant—element I mean—in the business. You always get into a
mess when you have to deal with such matters. Between friends, one
may talk of oneself, and there are few people who have my happy
knack of dealing with theology. You can't forget how I knocked over
the orthodox doctrine, and instructed my hearers that all babies were
born good. Well, if you had said this, the Archbishops would have
torn their wigs, and there would have been a row in Exeter Hall that
you might have heard at Wobnm. But I smashed the Article as
neatly as you would—or rather would not—smash the pipe of Aunt
Sally, and with as much applause. I wish I had to see these Anti-
Spanish-Popery bloaters to-morrow.
"Now, please Johnny, don't promise anything. For I declare to you
that I will not have a row about a batter and a soldier. As for the
hatter—O, Johnny. I ought to have Been the deputation. What a
capital bit I should have got out of him!' Without wishing to display
levity on a serious subject, the noble Lord went on to say, it was
really enough to make one as mad as a hatter to hear of such tyranny
(laughter), and whatever the poor fellow's hats might be, his convic-
tions must indeed be felt (great laughter).' Hey, Johnny, ho,
Johnny, you can't afford epigrams like those, and therefore you do
wisely in not attempting them. Bat confound the hatter, why doesn't
he attend to his business, instead of muddling over theology 7 We
oan't get up sympathy for a hatter at any price, my boy, so do you take
the matter uncommonly easy.
"I need not tell you that you may go the entire animal about liberty
of conscience, auto da fe (mind you pronounce it right) Toe^uemada,
Philip the Second, and all that kind of thing. That is in your
way. and if you like a retrospective shy at Sanguinary Polly, I do
not know that anybody will object, except Mr. Frowde. But be sure
that you do not give any undertaking to remonstrate with the Spanish
Qovernment, for if you do, I shall be obliged to repudiate the obliga-
tion. I know that you would like to write a despatch like Noll
Cbouwell's about the Waldenses, but you musn't. Times are
changed, and if the Spanish people like to roast a heretic soldier and
natter, I cannot think that the true spirit of civilisation permits the
English to object. I said something of the same kind the other day,
when they wanted me to send out ships and prevent the King of
Dahomey from cutting off a couple of thousand of his subjects'
heads, by way of spending a pleasant birth-day. We won't interfere.
You know that I nave always been celebrated for never interfering
in anybody else's business.
"I confess I am in a fidget about you and this deputation, because
it affords just one of the pegs on which you delight to hang a blunder,
and really you must not. Of course I acquit you of any such nonsense
as caring a farthing whether all the hatters in Spain were hung to-
morrow, with your friend Dr. Cumming's last book tied to their necks;
but you have a Dissenting twang about you, and you always want to
make yourself acceptable to the Non-Coni. All very right, in its way,
but Dissenting admiration may be bought too dear, and decidedly any
pledge to try and deliver these Protestant coves would be an extrava-
gant price for a cheer at the next Missionary Meeting. Suppose you
did commit us to anything of the kind, and I let you write the sort of
despatch you would like, protesting against the persecution of Spanish
Protestants. Don't you see that it would be giving the other side the
most splendid opportunity of telling you to mind your own business?
It is just what Spain would like to do just now, being still sore about
having had to pay us our money, and being also in a state of sympathy
with your friend the Pope, whom we have treated so kindly. You
would have back the most insolent answer that could be devised, and
it would come like a potatoe with a stone in him, as my Irish friends
say, because it would have a backbone of common sense. Please,
Johnny, don't expose us to such a missile.
"Now get to work on your Reform Bill, and bother all Spanish
hatters, converted and unconverted. Get your details right this time,
and don't give Edwin James another step towards the Solicitor-
Generalship. Try and make a coherent bill, and if you can't do it
yourself, humble yourself before Bethell a little, ana get him to do
it for you. He'll make waterproof work ef it, and if you can make
him take an interest in the affair, he '11 stand by you like a brick.
Think of that, which is really your business, and ease off these serious
bloaters as soon as you can. Bless you, my dear John.
"Ever your devoted "P."
"Hie Treasury."

A VIEW OF OUR VOLUNTEERS AS THEY WILL NEVER BE SEEN BY THE ENEMY!
THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
Toe Star-spangled banner that blows broad and brave,
O'er the home of the free, o'er the hut of the slave—
Whose stars in the face of no foe e'er waxed pale,
And whose stripes are for those that the stars dare assail—
Whose folds every year, broad and broader have grown,
Till they shadow hot li arctic and tropical zone,
From the Sierra Nevada to Florida's shore,
And, like Oliver 'I wist, are still asking for more—
That banner whose infantine bunting can boast
To have witnessed the Union's great charter engrossed;
Which at Boston saw Freedom's stout struggle begun,
And from Washington welcomed its victory won—
For our fathers in rebel defiance it spread,
But to us it waves brotherly greeting instead;
And Concord and Peace, not Bellona and Mars,
Now support England's Jack and the States' Stripes and Stars.
Can it be there are parricide hands that would tear
This star-spangled banner, so broad and so fair?
And if there be hands would such sacrilege try,
Is the bunting too weak the attempt to defy F
Alas! while its woof Freedom wove in her loom,
She paused in her work, and the Fiend took her room,
And, seizing the shuttle that Freedom had left,
Threw Slavery's warp across Liberty's weft.
How the Fiend langhed and leaped, as the swift shuttle flew,
With its blood-rotted threads, the fair weft running through,
"Now cut out your web—it is broad, it is long—
Twixt Fiend's work and Freedom's, let's hope it is strong!"
And now that the blood-rotted warp is worn bare,
The flag it is fraying, the flag it may tear •
For the Fiend cheers on those who to rend it essay,
And the work he's had hand in is apt to give way.
Now Heaven guide the issue! May Freedom's white hands
'Ere too late, from the flag pluck these blood-rotted strands,
And to battie and breeze fling the banner in proof
That 'tis all her own fabric, in warp as in woof.
If this may not be, if the moment be nigh,
When this banner unrent shall no more flout the sky,
To make fitting division of beams and of bars,
Let the South have the Stripes and the North have the Stars.

but the announcement of Benbdek's promotion is accompanied by a

"Behkdek U still In the flower of UU ago, having just completed hU flfty-alxth

This statement is so calculated to give pleasure to our senior readers

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BIT OF REAL BURLESQUE.
As Christmas is approaching, the writers of burlesques are busy
looking out for subjects; and it perhaps may be refreshing to their
facetious faculties if they cast their comic eye on this suggestive para-
graph, which a coirespondent sends us from a weekly Plymouth
priut:—
"Stringent Laws at Penzance 1]—Tho authorities, acting, it would appear
under regulations adopted for the proper government of the Market, caused Mr.
Peter John Riohards, au old and well known butcher of the town, to be summoned
on Monday last, for appearing In the Market and carrying on his business without
having on a clean apron and sleeves. It appeared from tho evidence, that this respect-
able tradesman wore a blue frock or blouso, and that such had been his custom for 47
years. He refused to change to the new fashion, contending that there was no law
to compel hitn to do so. After a remonstrance from the Mayor the butcher said,
1 If convicted, I shall carry it to abigher court. A nulsauce, indeed 1 You may see
if I am a nuisance' (raising his blouse); 'my trousers, shirt, and drawers are all
olean ; the Bench may strip mo if thuy please and see whether I am a nuisance,'
(lowi lavQhttr). Mr. Pearce, the officer of the Court. 'You must not insult tho
Court.' The Mayor. 'The blouse you have produced is not an apron snd sleeves.'
Dt-fendant. 'Bettor still, it is an apron and sleeves all in one, and it is perfectly
clean.' In reply to the Mayor, the Bcadlo said, all the butchers in the Market
appeared with sleeves and aprons. The Mayor. 'Mr. Richards, we must carry out
the law, and you aro fined If. and the expenses,' Defendant. 'My case does not
come within the meaning of the Ac, and I won't pay a penny.' The Mayor. 'I am
sorry oven to mention the alternative, but there is seizure of goods and imprison-
ment provided by the act for those who won't pay.' Defendant. Not a penny will
1 pay. You may incarcerate me, you may make me drink the waters of affliction
and the bread of punishment, you may take me to the Green Market, tie me to
s ntake, pile up the faggots, and burn mo to a cinder beforo I will pay' (toud laughUr).
Tho Mayor. 'Oh I our remedy Inflicts no martyrdom; the unpaid fine only requires
a distress warrant' Defendant. * You may take away my bed, if you like; you '11
have to answer to a higher court. Mr. Tom Boliteo told me you missed your point
in taking out your warrant.' The Mayor. * It is time for you to learn better.' De-
fendant. 'Well, Sir, I shan't be much longer in the market.'"
It would need but slight invention to make a really first-rate funny
scene of this. Were it adapted for a pantomime, of course the part of
Butcher would be played by Clown, while Pantaloon would figure with
his brethren on the Bench. An attitude of digital defiance to the law.
presented by Clown's stretching out his fingers from his nose, would
doubtless draw a roar of hearty laughter from the Gallery; and if, to
close the scene, he bonneted the Beadle, and then touched up the
Mayor with the point of a hot poker, the pantomime would certainly
achieve a great success.
The scene might also quite as fitly be used in a burlesque, or, if need
be, might be spun out into a whole piece of the extravaganza sort.
The First Act might be occupied with the usual fairy business, with
tableaux of little incidents in the hero's early life. We should see him
in the cradle, at school, aud making love, and then, through means of
the Bad Fairy, getting his ears boxed and being sent about his business.
To him, moody and disgusted, and meditating suicide by swallowing
"South African," should come in the Good Fairy to set him up in
trade, giving him the Magic Blouse, warranted oy her to last clean
without washing for "forty-seven years." At the moment of investiture,
the Bad Fairy should appear in the form of an Old Magpie, and should
intimate by pantomime of pecking at the Butcher's boots that, though
she could not stop the gift, but little good should come of it, and that
if the Blouse were worn the wearer would be brought to grief. Here
the music might be borrowed from the celebrated trio in the Mountain
Sylph ("This magic-wove Blouse," &c, &c), after which the Magpie
should he booted and hop off, and to a Chorus of Congratulation the
corps of Aa/W-Butcbers might bring the act-drop down upon a Dance
of Delight.
In the Second Act we ought to see the Butcher in his blouse,
prosperous and happy, and on the point of being married to the
Princess who had jilted him, and had boxed his ears. On the day
before the wedding she might come to him to buy some beefsteaks for
the breakfast, and this would nicely give occasion for some sentimental
business, with the usual admixture of Mozart and Nigger Melody,
terminating, of course, in the usual comic dance. Then the Magpie
should hop in and aggravate the Butcher by indulging in a furtive
wiuk at the Princess. Vowing vengeance for such impudence, the
Butcher then should chevy the Magpie with his cleaver, and at last
succeed in chopping off its tail. With a meaning croak of mischief
away would fly the bird, and the happy lovers would resume their
comic dance, too soon, alas I to he cut short by a Policeman, who,
with a rattle in his hand and the Mugpie at his back, should arrest the
blissful Butcher for having been a ' nuisance," because he had been
seen at market in his blouse. Into the details of the scene in Court
we need not enter, for the report which we have quoted suggests them
clearly enough. Nor need we take the trouble to describe the
language that might fittingly be used, for anything more funny than
the words which we have cited it would puzzle the most clever of
burlesque-wrights to invent. The scene of course might be a parody
of those so often witnessed in our trans-Tnamesian melodramas, where
threats are hurled, and fingers snapped, at all legal authorities, where
justice is defied and judges are denounced in the huskiest of voices
and the haughtiest of struts. As a specimen, for instance, a portion
of the Butcher's speech on hearing condemnation, might run thus:—
"Ha! Minion!! You may rack me with the tor-rrments of the
torture-chamber, you may load these legs with fetters and these limbs
with ir-r-r-on gyves,—you may haply make me drink the bitter waters
of hafliction, and hemaciate my car-r-r-r-eaae with the coarsest prison
fare, but know you that beneath the blouse of the poor butcher there
beats an 'tart as 'aughty as that of any spangled noble in the land!"

STALE BEER!
Good people all, on you I call
To lend me a patient ear,
Whilst a song I Bing of a horrible thing;
A brewer supplying stale beer!
Now I honour and revere
The purveyor whose ale is sincere;
But do despise the brewer who tries
To do a poor man with stale beer.
He had bought the drink, fit to throw in the sink,
From a certain trade-compeer;
But not paying his friend, was sued, in the end,
For the price of the bad stale beer.
Now I honour, &c.
This case of hum into Court did come,
In the Time* it doth appear,
Where the story you '11 fiud of the man of low mind
Who is noted for selling stale beer.
Now I honour, &o.
A dead take-in is swipes too thin:
When 'lis likewise flat and queer
The brewer who puts such stuff in his butts
Should be drowned in a butt of stale beer.
Now I honour, &c.
This trash in beer's shape had a narrow escape
Of costing our soldiers dear;
To Gibraltar it went, then back was sent;
For the troops wouldn't stand stale beer.
Now I honour, &c.
Hog-wash by right, at half-price not quite,
The plaintiff sola it here -.
For Christians' supply what a shame to buy
That nasty and cheap stale beer!
Now I honour, &c.1
In future Jews I '11 ne'er abuse!
A fellow, Thames Walton near,
Deserving stripes, buys villauous swipes
To mix with the haymakers' beer!
Now I honour, &c.
To trifle with thirst of all crimeB is worst,
Most cruel and severe.
How the people will shout, as that chap goes about,
Crying, " Who sold the mowers stale beer F"
Now I honour, &c.
COPPERS FOR THE TRIPLE CROWN.
The subjoined telegram is calculated to reassure the faithful:—
"-£65,000 of Peter's Pence have arrived from America.''
The Pope complains of persecution; but he seems to be making a
very goqd thing of it. His paternal heart may be sadly grieved by the
attacks which are made on the see of Peter, but must derive no small
consolation from the Peter's Pence which flow into his paternal pocket.
The pocket of the Holy Father may be said to be lacerated no less than
the heart; at least there is a hole in it at which all the money runs out
to pay troops and purchase ammunition. This might soon be mended
if he would renounce bayonets, abjure guns and gunpowder, and send
his army to the right about. His Holiness would then be both pocket-
whole and heart-whole, and would no longer give the incorrigible
scoffer occasion to call him more holy than righteous. No reasonable
man would grudge the PoPI any number of Peter's Pence that his
flock may be willing to drop into the tiara of their pastor; but if the
money is spent in soldiering, that application of Peter's Pence will be
even more objectionable than robbing Peter to pay Paul.

RICHAI<D THE THIRD. PROM A 6KKTCH TAKE.V AT
THE BATTLE or BOSWORTH FOR AN ILLUSTRATED
newspaper or the period.
CHAPTER XL.—SHOULD BE READ BY ALL TRAGEDIANS
BEFORE THEY DRESS FOR RICHARD IIL*
nus far into the history of
costume having marched on
without impediment, we
come now to describe the
arms and armour of a period
which must interest every
reader who is conversant
with Siiakspbare, and they
who are not, are, of course,
unworthy of our thought.
As the. Wars of the Roses
ended with the battle of
Bosworth Field, and on the
crook-back tyrant's death
grim-visaged war awhile re-
moved Ins wrinkled front,
and left fair Englaud to be
smiled upon by smooth-
faced peace, the reiga of
RicruHD the TniRD, may
be viewed as being the cli-
max of a period of slaughter,
in which the arts of shoot-
ing, swording, stabbing,
spearing, sticking, slitting,
spitting, smiting, smashing,
slashing, and in other ways
destroying, attained the
greatest height of excellence
to which such evils could be
brought. We who have the happiness of living in a later age, have
the advantage of appliances a million-fold more deadly ; and the spears,
and swords, and matchlocks of the fifteenth century, sink into insignifi-
cance beside our Armstrong guns, and Minie\ and other
"Mortal (nuine*. whoso rude throats
The immortal Jore'e dread terrors counterfeit."
In Richard's time, however, gunpowder was little known, and,
perhaps, less trusted; and plate armour, which was cast aside when
better guns were cast, was wrought, and sought, and bought at figures
as extravagant as the wearers of it cut. What sort of Guys they
looked when "cased from head to foot in panoply of steel," the pencil
of our artist will tell better than our pen, and we need only direct the
notice of the nation to such points in his drawings as chiefly mark the
period which they represent.
One of the first things to observe is, the covering of the body from
the waist down over the hips with flexible and horizontal plates of
steel, which it appears were called either taces or tassets. To the
lowest of these, in front, were affixed two pendent plates that hung to
shield the thighs, and "were called tuiles, from their semblance to the
tiles of a house, a statement which, if true, serves to show that tiles
were quite as differently shaped then as were hats, to the housetiles
and silk "chimney-pots which are now in use.
Other points to notice are the great size of the shoulder-plates,
called otherwise the pan hi reus, and the still vaster proportions of the
pointed elbow pieces. These were generally fan-shaped, and so large
that at a front view they looked like little shields. Their long pro-
jecting points were sometimes hooked like lion's claws, ana were
most ly made so sharp, that it could have been no joke to get a poke in
the ribs with them by a funny man who wanted to emphasise a jest.
Apparently, the Knights in these old days were rather proud of the
distortion which in fashionable language is known as a "good figure,"
for their effigies are sadly small about the waist. This elegance, how-
over, they in some cases concealed by wearing a loose tabard, or
emblazoned surcoat, upon which their armorial bearings were dis-
played. But we sometimes find the tabard made to fit tight to the
body, so as not to hide its fashionable slimness, whereof an instance
is still visible at East Herling Church in Norfolk, in a window repre-
senting the good knight Sir Robert Wingheld kneeling at his
devotions, with spurs at least a foot in length projecting from his heels.
This fashion of covering the armour with a surcoat was a revival of the
custom in the reign of Edward the Fourth. We may suppose that
knights kept generally a change of tabards in their wardrobe, just as
their descendants keep a change of coats; but how much more costly
were the former than the latter may be inferred from the letter we
* As in point of date this Chapter ought to have preceded Chapter 39, we may
explain that it was written mainly to oblige a valuoa correspondent, who thought
that for tho bonoflt of future playgoing generations, the military properties of tho
rofgn of Richard thk Third ought to be correctly pictured in our Book.
have previously quoted, written by Kino Richard while at York to
his Clothes-Keeper, wherein he orders "three coats of arms, beaten
with fine gold, for our own person." Richard, we may repeat, it is
historically certain, was a swell of the first water: and tragedians who
present him as "lamely and unfashionable," ana "scarce half made
up," will show they have read Shaksfeare more than they have read
Rous. This old writer was a chantry priest at Guy's Cliff, near to
Warwick, where he resided from the time of Edward the Fourth to
that of Henry the Seventh. He commands our admiration as being
one of the earliest of English writers on Costume. Mr. Punch being
acknowledged as the latest and the best. For the benefit of readers
who look to us for funniment more than they do for fact, we may add
that Rous at one time earned the name of "Bravo Rous," from his
habit of purloining good bits from other writers without ever conde-
scending to notice their true authorship. Among the tales he thus
appropriated were several of Kino Richard, whom the old chroniclers
concur in describing as a restless and uncomfortable person, always
drawing his ring off and on, or continually sheathing and unsheathing
his dagger, while he was engaged in thought or conversation, as if his
mind was so unquiet that it would not let his fingers rest. The same
uneasiness, says Rous, he showed when trying a new coat on, or
walking in new boots: indeed in later life his clothes were invariably
altered a dozen times or more ere he would own they fitted him. One
of the stories tells us that, after winning a new hat in a wager with the
Ddee or Buckingham, who had bet him that he would not woo and
wed the Ladt Anne, King Richard sent the hat back sixteen times
to be made bigger, and every day just after breakfast used to ride
down to the maker's and roar out in blank verse, which he always
spoke when angry:—
"What 1 is my bearer easier than it was I"
During this period the dagger was as usual attached to the right
hip, w hile the sword was belted so as to make it hang almost in front,
the top of the hilt being about level with the waist. By inclining the
point a little towards the left, the wearer saved himself from getting
the blade between his legs; but it must have knocked his knee at
every step he took. The admirers of Shaksfearb doubtless would
contend, if the point were only mooted, that it was iu obvious allusion
to this fact that in the play of Richard the Third he makes Richmond
use the phrase:—
"Put in their hands thy bruising Irons of wrath."
The salade still continued the helmet most in use, and was generally
surmounted with the wearer's crest and chapeau, or else surrounded
wit h his colours woven in a wreath, and having at the side a feather
made to match. Richard, on his great seal, is represented with a
chapeau over the salade, surrounded by the crown and surmounted with
the lion, which was his kingly crest. The chapeau, we should add, was
a chaplet, not a hat, so readers must not fancy the King looked like an

old clo'man, because he wore three head-covers, chapeau, helm, and

To close our description, we may mention that the feet were still
encased in long steel sollerets. or shoes of flexible plate; and that to
shield the neck was worn a steel gorget, called a "hausse-col," which

sounds as though it bore some connection to a horse-collar, and provokes
a misquotation of the sadly hackneyed phrase :—
11 At loast wo'11 dlo with harness on our ncckB!"
Unlike the horsccollar, however, the hausse-col could have hardly
been big enough to grin through; at least we judga so from the effigies
and other figures bearing it, that look as though they were garolted
and were very nearly choked. Some such an appearance is presented
in a portrait of the Lord Lovel of Siiakspeare, who, in the tragedy of
Mchard III. has but two lines of speech allotted him (see Act iii., Sc. 7)
■which hardly afford the actor much insight to the part. The curious,
however, may learn more about his character from an old ballad which
lias lately fallen into our hands, and which, so far as we can learn, has
not been previously in print. Of this the first two verses run, or halt,
as follows:
"ILottie ILobcI bee stone nt fjgs GTasttl boorc,
3 combgnn; hga BiHhgtc Surric,*
SHbtn up to fjtm stalhca hps motlicrcsiiuhrbtr,

• Tliis allusion tn the fact that Whttt Surrey was a charger belonging to Lord
Lovel surely justifies our thinking; that, besides his other virtues, Kino Ricuabd
was a horse stealer. We merely throw out this suggestion to tragedians who wish
to take a new viow of his character, and strike out something original when thoy
undertake the port.
A GHOST STORY FOR GIRLS AND BOYS.
How f ceptical soever we may be on the subject of ghosts, yet when
a story of an apparition is authenticated by evidence taken before a
Magistrate, we must not allow our preconceived ideas about things
of that sort to prevent us from allowing such testimony its due weight,
no matter to what conclusion it may point. Now, really, there seems
no just reason for doubting the trutlt of the subjoined statement,
openly made the other day at the Thames Police Court, in the presence
of Mi. Yardlet, by Captain Joseph Hossack, master of the ship
Cyclops, trading between London and Hong Kong. It should be pre-
mised that an entry had been made in the ship's log book of the disap-
pearance of Peter Peterson, the dead steward below alluded to, who
was lost in a gale of wind, and believed to have fallen overboard and
perished in the waves. Eighteen days after this the second mate, who
was in the cabin, stumbled over an obstruction, which felt in the dark
like a man's feet; and upon obtaining a light he discovered under the I able
a human form resembling that of the departed steward. It may be as
well to mention that Peterson was a black man, a circumstance which
maybe supposed likely to render his identification under the conditions
stated, difficult if not impossible; but subsequent events leave no room
for question as to this particular. These are Captain Hossack's
words:—
"The mate called out to the man at the helm, saying, 'Bill, hore's the dead
steward I' Bill came to look, and was so terrified that he rushed back, and
though one of tho strongest men in the ship, he wont into a fit, and was ill for four
days afterwards."
So far, to be sure, the facts of the case might be admitted, and
ascribed, as usual, to imagination. But let us proceed:—
"He thought he had seen the steward's ghost. A Newfoundland dog, which
came down at the same time with Bill, was struck with terror, ran back howling,
and jumped ovorboard and was drowned."
How is this manifestation of terror on the part of the Newfoundland
dog to be accounted for? Indisposition might be a cause sufficient to
produce the appearance which presented itself to the mate; a figure
which he naturally took Jor that of the defunct steward. Mental
contagion, operating through a nervous system, which, although that
of one of the strongest men of the crew, may probably enough have
been under the influence of grog, and affecting a mind perhaps as weak
and superstitious as the frame which it actuated was powerful and
robust, would afford a possible, if not a satisfactory explanation of the
transference of the mate's hallucination to Bill, and the consequent
terror, fit, and illness of that seaman. Had the mate and Bill, or to
give him what most likely was his proper name, William, been the
only witnesses of the apparition under the table, the mere evidence of
their senses would be inconclusive. But what frightened the New-
foundland dog? Was the poor animal nervous, or superstitious, or
drunk, that, struck with terror," it "ran back howling and jumped
overboard and was drowned P" What has incredulity the most deter-
mined to say to that P
Proceeding in the examination of the Police Report, we find that—
"It turned out that tho steward had been all tho time in tho bread-locker, where
he had lived concealed, but he had gono out at night and procured*food for himself."
So, then, the Newfoundland dug jumped overboard to no purpose,
except, that of proving himself to have been a very dull dog to mistake
a skulker for a ghost. This foolish act of his must tend to cast great
discredit on the evidence of other Newfoundland dogs; indeed, on the
whole accumulated testimony of the canine species to the objective
reality of spectres. In connection with ghost-stories, this Newfound-
land dog seems to have thrown all dogs overboard together with him-
self. All that can be said for the sagacity of Nero—if that was the
name of the unhappy dog-is, that the faithful creature perhaps lost
himself in astonishment at the steward's deceit. The most incredible
part of the story remains to be told. Mr. Peter Peterson, after
having played the crafty trick above described, and been, at the
unanimous demand of the shin's crew, put in irons for the same, had
the audacity to summon Captain Hossack to the Thames Police Co irt
for the amount of his wages at £5 a month = £21! He had thrice
before been guilty of playing a similar trick in other vessels. He had
made a pigstye of the bread-locker, wherein he had secreted himself. It
is needless to say that the Magistrate dismissed the summons of this
nigger. Dogs are supposed to have an intuitive perception of character:
and it is possible that when the Newfoundland dog caught sight of
Mr. Peterson under the table, he was immediately frightened out of
his wits at seeing such a monster of impudence, and threw himself
overboard in a paroxysm of canine madness.

PILL-MAKING AND BILL-MAKING.
Are the Homoeopathic Doctors homoeopathic in their feesP Do
they, after dosing you with microscopic medicines, send in microscopic
charges for the cure P Are their bills as infinitesimal as the globules
they serve out to serve in lieu of pills P Because, if so, we really
should be tempted, the next time that we feel a little out of sorts, to
pay a visit to a Homoeopath instead of to an Allopath, on the ground
of the less fee that we shall have to pay for it. It is bad enough to
bear the torments of an illness, without having the infliction of a big
bill at the end of it. And really some doctors run up such wondrously
long bills that had they been born lawyers they could scarcely have
made longer ones. For instance, in the case of Denison v. Dent, the
Surgeon's little account for not three months' attendance was in
evidence alleged to be £962; and this, be it remembered, was merely
for attendance, and was exclusive of the charge of £76 14s. Zd. that
had been brought for pills, wherewith the wretched patient during that
brief period had nightly been besieged. Surely such a bombardment
of boluses as this is enough to frighten anyone of ordinary nerves: and
when one thinks of being charged well nigh a thousand pounds for
me ten weeks' attendance, one instinctively determines to do all
within one's power to keep oneself in health. There is no denying a
good Doctor in one's need is a friend indeed; but we cannot help
exclaiming, "Save us from such friends!" when we find such cause
for fear that, dearly as we prize them, their prices may still prove them
to be dearer than we think.

Losing all other freedom, you wouldn't mind that.

Be aisy we can't; but with patriot zeal,
Let us go about howling, and shrieking, and yelling,

Any Alteration would be Welcome.
We are told that "Habit is second naVure." We wish, then, that
some ill-natured persons we know would get into some such habit, for

be preferable to the one they possess.
THE ANATOMY OF SLAVERY.
Among the American news in the Times, the other day, appeared the
following paragraph:—
"A Mooting of the Southern medical atudonta iti Now York was hold on the
evening of the 9th at the Breckenridge head-quarters on the Broadway, opposite
Astor House, to tako action as to whother they should go homo or remain, sinco
Mr. Lincoln had boon elected. The Hon. Mr. Clinton, of Mississippi, Dr. Bimks
of this city, Captain Moroan of Tennessee, Colonei, Dick of Maryland, and
General Bynam of Tennessee, addressed the meeting. Tho Bpiritof the assemblage
was decidedly in favour of disunion, and of Southerns leaving tho city immediately.
Speeches favouring theso views wero applauded, whilst thoso advocating milder
moasures were hissed down."
What is there in the prospect of moderate anti-slavery legislation
that can be so peculiarly distasteful to Southern medical students f
Of all men in the world medical students ought to know, because
anatomy teaches them, that there is no essential difference between
white men and black men. Physiology instructs them to infer that
niggers are men and women from the knowledge that there are such
people as Mulattos and Quadroons. Therefore it is impossible
to entertain a certain supposition, which alone seems adequate
to account for the hostility of medical students to even the most
distant idea of acknowledging the humanity of the coloured race.
Otherwise that feeling on their part might be referred to a con-
sideration, which, if not anatomical, is connected with anatomy.
If negroes have no souls, they differ only from the ape tribe in
affording the anatomist better subjects than monkeys. Surely the
Southern medical students are not afraid that the result of Mr.
Lincoln's election may be a law to prevent them from having niggers
knocked on the head, or strangled, or smothered, to obtain bodies fur

OUR WONDERFUL CABINETS.
Every one has heard—for has not Punch announced the fact P of a
Wonderful Cabinet that is being^ here exhibited, and which is really
quite a marvel of constructive ingenuity. The maker is a foreigner,
one M. Nadolski, and as foreign art is always patronised in England,
his exhibition doubtless will achieve a great success. While, however,
we award him all the praise he merits, which really is not small, for the
credit of our country we ought not to forget that several Wonderful
Cabinets have been constructed of late years, by makers who are purely
British born and bred, and lay no claim to foreign parentage or genius.
Some of these Cabinets, such as those, for instance, which were con-
structed not long since by Lords Abebdeen and Derby, have been
wonderful not merely for the oddities that they contained, but for the
rapidity wherewith they came to pieces. Others have been wondrous
for a quality just opposite, for they have held together somehow in
spite of flaws and splits, and all attempts to disunite them; of this sort
is the Cabinet constructed by Lord Palmerston, who perhaps is the
most skilful master of the cabinet-making art. Among his other
strokes of cleverness, his Lordship shows great skill in hitting the right
nail upon the head when it is needful, and this assists him much in
keeping his Cabinet together. Not long ago it was reported that there
had been a split, and that the Foreign Office hinge was not working
very well, and was getting rather rusty; but Lord Palmebston in
quick time set all this to rights, and now his Cabinet seems stronger
and more durable than ever.
Perhaps, however, the most wonderful of all the wonders of our
Cabinets is their exceeding elasticity and power of prehension. Any
one who has had experience in packing politicians knows how difficult
it is to make them go together, ana fit their angular opinions with
those of their next neighbours. Our Cabinets, however, are so caout-
choucic in construction that the most wonderful of combinations are
sometimes found to be contained in them. Tories, Whigs, and Peelites,
Conservatives and Radicals, are somehow crammed together in our
Wonderful Cabinets, and everybody marvels how they could have been
fot into them. Being so got in, another wonder is that they should
eep together: but their adhesion is accounted for when one thinks
what glue it is that binds them with such marvellous tenacity to office.
Even politicians will stick like wax together, when they find that by so
doing something is left sticking to the lining of their pockets, which is
quite enough to make them disinclined to split.
CREDO, QUIA IMPOSSIBILE EST.
Mb, Punch observes the following advertisement in the Times:—
SHOULD this CATCH the ATTENTION of a CAPITALIST whose
faith in three per cents, subserves the better croed, a Catholic gentleman, a
convert, would be glad to confer with him. Address Credo, &c
"There is much matter in these convertites," says Jaques, and we
should like him to have "conferred" with this amusing party. The
"better creed" is most likely a misprint for the "better's creed," and
the advertiser is, in all probability, a starved-out racing prophet, who
always sent the right horses for every race, only somehow they never
came in first. He wants to try a new field of spooneyism. "Credo,
&c." must mean, "I believe you, my boy." We wish the converted
buffer all the luck he deserves.
How many Different Varieties of Riots are there?
We read in the police reports of a '* serious riot" that took place
last Monday at Knightsbndge Barracks. It is the word "serious"
that tickles us. We confess we never heard of a "comical riot,"
unless indeed it is an Irish Pat-riot, such as that great burlesque actor,
The ODonoqhue, has been giving us an amusing specimen of in Dublin.
We hope he will soon repeat the performance of his comical Pat-riotism.

KING 0. AND KING MAC.
Mr. Smith O'Brien refused to subscribe to the
McMahon sword. He considers that the presentation
thereof as "intended to be an intimation that McMahon
would be welcome" in Ireland "at the head of a French
army." He does not relish the idea of Kino McMahon-.
For, he demands in a letter which has just been pub-
lished by the Irish American—
"What is McMahon? It Is truo be belongs to an ancient Irish
family—la In fact a scion of the race to which I myself belong—but
ho has neither done nor suffered in the causo of Ireland. He is
simply the agent of a military despot, and he dares not even accept
tbe sword which you offer him without tho permission of that
dosjot. Yet the Irish people are encouraged to look upon McMahom
as tho future King of Ireland."
Are Irishmen really the warm-hearted people they have
so long had the credit of being P Is gratitude a senti-
ment which glows in the hearts of Irish patriots with any
high degree of ardour? Here is Mr. Smith O'Brien,
who has both done and suffered in the cause of Ireland,
lie has done what he will not be such a fool as to do
tigiiin; and he has suffered kss than he deserved, and
more lhan he will venture to deserve a second time. Yet
here are all the traitors of Ireland forgetting Smith O'Brien
and running after McMahon. Not one of all those
rascals has proposed to give Smith O'Brien a sword, or
even a knife to cut cabbages with. On the contrary,
adding impudence to ingratitude and insult to neglect,
they invite him to subscribe to a sword for McMahon,
—for a mere scion of that race to which somebody else
belongs. Is McMahon the representative of the ancient
Irish ltoyal Family that the Irish people are encouraged
to look upon him as the future King of Ireland? If the
Irish people really looked at McMahon in that character,
they would be open to the charge of base ingratitude.
They will not have that pretender to reign over them.
The sovereign of their choice will be Smith O'Brien,
in case they should ever have the opportunity of electing
him, which would be afforded by a default of succession
to the Crown of the United Kingdom occurring in Mr.
O'Brien's lifetime. In the meaulime, O'Brien will, no
doubt, be guided by the remark rather than the example
of Macbeth, considering that if chance will have him. King,
why chance will crown him without his stir, and there-
fore he won't stir, but bide his time like a caterpillar
under the shade of his greens.

THE APPETITE OF LONDON.
Here is an appalling fact for Vegetarians to ponder over. We take
it from the Timet reporter on the Cattle-show:—
"Tho enormous appetito of London is fed every year by about 270,000 oxen,
besides 30,000 calves, 1,500,000 Bhorp, and 30,000 swine. Of the dozen different
breeds and sorts of beasts, fully one-third are shorthorns, one-sixth are of cross-
breeds ; next in number come the foreign supplies; then tho Hereford*, then Irish
breeds, thou Irish crossos, then tho Devons; while polled Boots, Highlanders,
Welsh runts and longhorus make up tho remainder."
When to this account are added all the venison, hares, and rabbits,
grouse, partridges, and pheasants, ducks, chickens, geese, and turkeys,
which annually go down the "red lane " of the metropolis, it must be
certainly acknowledged that however much the votaries of Vegeta-
rianism may have increased, there still survives a portion of the
London population at present unpersuaded to live upon green meat,
It says something, we think, for the health of the metropolis, that
such a prodigious quantity of good, substantial food, is every year
consumed in it. A good appetite is generally a sign of good condition,
and a city that can put away three hundred thousand oxen and a
million-and-a-half of sheep, must have a pretty healthy digestive appa-
ratus. We have sometimes heard it said, that it is easier for some
men to find appetites than dinners. If so, they could not well do
better than come and live in London; for, to judge by the above quoted
account of its consumption, at no place in the kingdom can good food
be more plentiful. But, be this so or not, a person must indeed be
born of a "cross-breed" who would not at Christmas-time be put in
a good humour by the picture of good living this paragraph presents.

A TBIP TO KISSINGEN.
In the Neicburyport Herald, which is an American paper, and where
Neicburyport is, the reader of course knows too well for us to tell
him; and, supposing that he does not, we recommend him to apply to
the nearest Government clerk of his acquaintance, or else to send a
letter on the subject to Lobs Malmesbuut, who will be sure to send
him an answer, "with his compliments," by return of post; well, as
we began by stating, it was in the Neicburyport Herald (please exchange)
that we read the following fact, which has an agreeable smack of
romance about it:—
11 One time when Henry Clay came to New York, ho kissed a milo and a half of
women."
We thought that the proverb assured us that " every miss was as
good as a mile," but in New York (happy city, where travelling is
carried on by busses!) it would seem that the Misses rau to the extent
of a mile-and-a-half—and every Miss, too, was as good as a mile. The
New World seems to go further in everything than the Old World—
even in kissing. By the bye, with all due respect, the proper locality
for the above little incident should have been the Mississippi.

THE FIRST BRIEF.
A BALLAD OF THE TEMPLE.
Sir Brieelesse he sate on hisleather-back'd chair,
With statutes and books at his side;
And pen, ink, and paper before him all lay,
And a dusty old dummy or two for display,
Round which the red tape was tied—was tied,
Hound which the red tape was tied.
But nathless unopen'd the law books were,
Unopen'd the Statutes at Large;
And his pen it was dry, and his paper all white, _
For he'd nothing to read for, and nothing to write,
And what's worse, he'd nothing to charge—to charge,
And what's worse, he'd nothing to charge!
Clerke Tape he sate in his little back-room,
And mused on his country's wrongs,
As he read by the light of the Morning Star,
How bloated the proud aristocracy are,
To whom all the power belongs—belongs,
To whom all the power belongs.
But a terrible smile there play'd o'er his lips,
As he read of his country's oppression;
For the thought of one Champion, y-clept John Bright,
Who could set ev'ry body and ev'ry thing right,
If the Lords were put down and the duty were quite
Ta'en off from our paper next Session—next Session,
Ta'en off from our paper next Session.
Each morn Sir Brieflesse he rang at his bell,
And he rang each eventide;
"Has any one called, Clerke Tape?" he would say.
"No, Sir, no one has called, I think, to-day,
Except a few duns which I sent away;"
Was all that Clerke Tape replied—replied,
Was all that Clerke Tape replied.
"This never will do!" Sir Bhieflesse he said,
"This never will do!" quoth he;
"'Tis strange that attorneys can't find their way here;"
Quoth Tape, "Sir, it certainly is verv queer,
That such talent unnoticed should be—should be,
That such talent unnoticed should be."
One day there came a rap at the door;
And a strange little rap was there;
It wasn't the postman, who comes Bap! Bap!
Nor a dun who calls with a different tap,
Concerning that leetle affair—affair,
Concerning that leetle affair.
Clebke Tape rose up, and he open'd the door;
Sir Brieflesse he chanced to be out;
For a summons within him, unknown by few,
Used to solemnly warn him each day at two,
To go for his oysters and stout—and stout,
To go for his oysters and stout.
Clerke Tape had a paper thrust into his hand;
'Twas a scroll right fair to see;
Outside, a few words endorsed had been,—
"Exchequer—re Jenkins—Instructions within,
Sir Bui efles se—fi ce guai," which I'm told means the tin,
That professional men call the fee—the fee,
That professional men call the fee.
Sir Brieflesse returned to his legal retreat,
And seated himself on his chair;
When in walk'd Clerke Tape with his usual gnico,
The scroll in his hand and a smile on his face,
And thus spoke with a nonchalant air—air, air,
And thus spoke with a nonchalant air.
"A Clerk, Sir, has called with these papers to-dny,
To which your attention's desired.
I told him I thought you might find a spare minute
To examine the case and the points that are in it,
If dispatch were not greatly required—required.
If dispatch were not greatly required."
Uprose Sir Brieflesse and eyed Clerke Tape,
And his colour it went and came.
"And is it a Brief, at last P" he cried,
"Or is it a phantom my fate to deride,
Which appears when all is departed beside
In hope's still flickering flame—hope's flame,
In hope's still flickering flame."
Then he clutch'd at the brief, and he look'd at the fee,
And he cried. "By Jove! It's a topper!"
And something he said, as he gave it a swing;
It should have been "Dash it!" which means the same thing,
And which isn't thought quite so improper—improper,
And which isn't thought quite so improper.
Then he toss'd the brief up high in the air,
And he bang'd his books on the floor,
And seizing the poker with all his might,
He poked till the heat of the fire was white,
And Tape soon thought he was crack'd outright.
And began to retreat to the door—the door,
And began to retreat to the door.
"For this," cried Brieflesse, "each mom and eve
Have I prayed on bended knees;
And now it has come! and I see my way,
I shall be Chief Justice, I know, some day."
Quoth Tape, "Sir, I only hope you may
Preside at the Common Pleas—the Pleas,
Preside at the Common Pleas."
But many a day glided slowly away,
As be paced the road of fame.
Perhaps on a hoarded store of fees,
Clebke Tape and Sir Brieflesse are living at ease,
For upon the bench of the Common Pleas
I haven't yet seen his name—his name,
I haven't yet seen his name.
A FLASH OF TELEGRAPH-LIGHTNING.
he other day. one of
Keuter's telegrams,
conveying Chinese in-
telligence, was couch-
ed in the terms en-
suing:—
"The Emperor'a Pa-
lace was looted on the
«th of October."
Everybody knows
that "loot," plunder,
and the verb "to
loot," to pillage, are
terms derived from
the dialect of Sepoy
mutineers and rob-
bers. It must, be
pleasing to the Swell
Mob to see these
expressions getting
adopted in military
despatches and offi-
cial returns. The
rogues and rascals of
our native land may
now cherish the hope
that their own pecu-
liar phraseology will
soon be honoured
with employment in
public documents by
commanding officers,
and other gentlemen in high and honourable situations, and will pass
into the language of Government and diplomacy.
"I have much pleasure in informing your Excellency that we have
whopped the enemy into fits. Our men fought like bricks. We have
lagged no end of prisoners, and collared several guns. Besides the tin
which was secreted in the cellars, all of which we nabbed, we have
prigged a precious sight of gimcracks, and boned some valuable toggery.
Our coves also grabbed a variety of grub, which they shared with their
pals: but the brads and all the rest of the swag were carted into the
citadel, into which we quietly walked when our antagonists hooked it.
All serene; and I have the honour to be."
This is the style in which we shall soon have our generals reporting
the exploits of the British Army; for if they descend to the use of
Sepoy slang, why should they not pay other thieves the compliment of
expressing themselves in thieves' Latin F

HAESH TREATMENT OF A HEBREW.
What funny things one finds in the papers. Did Mr. Punch's
readers see this police report in the Daily Telegraph ?—
"MANSION HOUSE.
"A cunning-looking middle-aged Jew, named Abraham Moses, was yesterday
brought before the Lohd Mayor, chargod with an attempt todofraud Hbxry Harris.
"Tho complainant, a verj young man, but who api>earcd iu tho sequel to have
beon much more than a match for the Jew, stated that on Sunday evening he was
in Biabopsgate Street, when Mr. Mosks accosted him, and wanted to soil him what
ho described to be a real Australian gold ring and a silver chain for a sovoreign.
The complainant, bemg in tho service of a pawnbroker, he at once discovered tho
articles to be almost worthloss, and he gave the prisoner into custody. He now
stated, In addition to bis former evidence, that since tho prisoner had been
remanded bo had tested the articles in question, and had ascertained that the ring
was made of copper, slightly washed with gold, and the chain was also of copper
washed with nitric acid and quicksilvor."
But why does such a thing appear among the police reports P It
ought to have come in among the "Faceti/e," or should Lave been
headed "A Hint for the Pantomimes." So thought the amusing
Mr. Moses; for when—
11 The Lord Mayor asked the prisoner, whether he wished to make any answer to
the charge ?—
"He repHcd that all bo had got to say was, that ho was a dealer In tho articles,
and that what he had tried to do was done every day in Petticoat Lane and Hounds-
ditch, where the Jows every day sold brass articles for gold.
"Tho Lord Mayor told the prisoner ho should commit him for trial.
"The prisoner wanted to know what ho was to bo committed for?
"The Lord Mayor said for falsely pretending that the ring was made of Austra-
lian gold.
"The prisonor said that all he told tho young man was, that the ring came from
Australia, and this was tho truth; it did como from Australia—a very long way
from It—it came from Houndsditch. (A bnujh.)"
Laugh—of course. A mere bit of Mosaic-Arab fun; and Mr. Punch
protests against the dulness of a Magistrate who could take such a
thing au serieux. Why, according to the Times report, this unfortunate
farceur added, that "if all the Jews who did such things were to be
taken up, the gaols would be full of them." This may or may not be,
Mr. Moses may be more competent to say than Mr. Punch, but never
will the latter willingly see a bit of fun treated harshly, and he begs to
remonstrate with the Lord Mator, who seems to have no perception
of humour, and who actually sent Mr. Moses for trial. Christmas
time, too! Oh, Lord Cubitt! Lord Cubitt!
SOUTHWARK, PUNCH LOOKS TO-WARDS YOU!
That Mr. Punch can eject or inject anybody for anywhere is a
truth too universally acknowledged to need iteration. It is the con-
sciousness of his gigantic strength that prevents his interfering, save
rarely, in the quarrels of the lower creation. But he regarded it as a
matter of importance that Southwark should be lifted out of the mud
of local interests, and should be assisted to elect a Member of European
and Asiatic name and fame. Therefore, unlike Hercules in the case
of the Carter, he descended from Olympus, and gave the Nineveh Car
an immeasurable shove, which sent it rolling over the necks of all the
prostrate jobbers, bribers, publicans, Bumbles, and boobies of the
borough, and drove it, with Austen Layard in it, right up to the
door of the New Palace of Westminster. Mr. Punch has triumphantly
returned Mr. Latard, just as Mr. Punch indignantly hurled Mr. Cox
of Pinsbury into the abyss of obscurity. Mr. Latard will therefore
take Mr. Punch as his guide, philosopher, and friend, and (which is
tautology) pursue the brilliant career before the Honourable Member.
In the next place, for. Punch hereby shakes hands with every one of
Mr. Layard's voters, kisses (paternally) the feminine portion of that
voter's family, and pats his washed children on the head. He pro-
mised to patronise Southwark in the event of its doing its duty; and
although all election promises are not invariably kept, Mr. Punch
never broke his word. As soon as the weather is at all decent, he
will make a triumphal entrance into the borough. Meantime, he
drinks the health of Southwark aud its new Member.
The Battle of the T's.
There has been a great struggle between single t and double ditto
on the new penny-pieces. Is it to be Victoria Brit. Regina, or Victoria
Britt. Regina? The Doctors have at last decided that Brit, is short
for Britannia;, meaning England alone; while Britt. is the classical
abbreviation for Britanniarum, which includes England and Ireland
also. So Mr. Gladstone is right to a i, after all.

GRUB FOR THE MIND.
I cat
iut do you think?
At a meeting of the
Linnsean Society the
other evening, Mr.
Lovell described "a
parasite grub found
inside of humble bees,
but not in the intes-
tinal canal, which he
had minutely exa-
mined." It is strange
that humble bees
should be infested
with parasites. Such
creatures are more
commonly associated
with proud drones.
The grub that is
found inside the bees
but not in the intes-
tinal canal, is evi-
dently a case of grub
that has gone the
wrong way. No doubt
the learned natu-
ralists of the Lin-
nrean Society greatly
enjoyed the grub which Mr, Lovell placed before them. That grub must have
afforded them a high treat and a rich intellectual repast, and they ought to be
much obliged for it to Mr. Lovell, who had evidently taken some trouble to

"The Soldier Tired."
We fancy that every soldier, who was either at Delhi
or Lucknow, must be pretty well "tired" by this time of

COSTERMONGERS AND CHERUBS.
The Costermongers of the City of London met a few days since to
get up a petition to the Aldermen for the discontinuance of the Police
persecution to which they have lately been subjected. These are times
of progress, and obstructives ought to be forced to move on; but when
you tell the Costermonger to get on with his barrow, you invite Mm to
bring his business to a stand-still. Popular preachers and performers
cause obstructions in the streets, consisting of lines of carriages, which
are more in the public way than vegetable carts and apple-stalls. It
does not lie in the mouths of the Corporation, blocking up the
thoroughfares annually with their Lord Mayor's Show, to bid the
Policeman say "Move on," to the Costermonger. Live and let live;
live on buck's haunch and green fat, and let live on 'taturs.
A street nuisance, for which the Costermonger*s barrow would be an
acceptable exchange anywhere, is the perambulator. That and Crino-
line are the Scylla and Charybdis of the streets. You avoid the hoops
of the fashionable, or unfashionable female to get your foot crushed
under the wheels of a machine with a heavy baby in it, propelled
by a blundering nursemaid. And what remedy have you under these
painful circumstances? Noue, except you are a savage old fogy and
can read with delight the letter lately written by an eminent physician
in the Morning Post, wherein he disinterestedly protests against the
practice of taking children down from a hot nursery and wheeling them
about the streets in the most inclement weather, the result being their
seizure with " dyspnoea, hooping-cough, mumps, bronchitis, aphtbte, or
whatever name you may please to affix, which, in the great majority of
cases, soon terminate in death." All these effects of the employment of
perambulators, except just the fatal termination of the diseases thence
resulting, must be advantageous to doctors; and therefore it is very
liberal of a physician to publish them. The Policemen who order Cos-
termongers to move on with their stock in trade would be much better
employed, and would confer a real blessing on unthinking mothers, as
well as on the pedestrian public, iu obliging nursemaids with their
pestilent perambulators to move off. If parents make idols of their
children, they ought not to expect that other people will worship them
by submitting to nave their toes smashed beneath the cars in which
stupid servant-girls drag about these little Juggernauts.
Anglo-Mania.
The latest Nouveaute de Paris is a Btrong reaction in favour of the
English. In proof of this, a rich London November Fog went over
there a week or two ago, and the whole town, with the exception of a
single house, illuminated in its honour during the whole time of its stay I
As a further testimony of respect, we may also mention, that business
was almost entirely suspended so long as the fog remained in the lively
capital.
DRA.W THE CORK, SCOTLAND!
Now that, thanks to Punch, the Spiritualists have found their occu-
fiation gone in London, we almost wonder that they do not try their
uck across the Border, ana see what business (and believers) they
could do in Edinburgh, or any other place where the Thistle is the
crest. It may be that the Scotch are too far North and canny to be
taken in and done as mauy Southerns have been lately by spiritual
conjuring and clairvoyaut second-sight. We, indeed, can scarcely
picture a party of cool, cautious, calculating Scotctfmen, sitting
gravely round a table and expecting it to move. Such a process would
at best be deemed a waste of time, with the risk, nay, utter certainty,
of being made a fool of, from both of which results the mind of a
shrewd Scotchman instinctively would shrink. Yet, that Spirit influ-
ence is largely felt iu Scjtlaud, this extract froin a Parliamentary
return will surely show:—
"While England, with Its 20.000,000 of pooplo, consumed 17,000,000 gallons of
spirits last year, Scotland, with its 3.00.1,000 of population, took 5,600,000; and
Ireland, with perhaps only Lta 6,000,000 of Inhabitants, very nearly that prociso
number of gallons; so tbat iu Eugland wo do not tako quite a gallon of spirit*
a year apiece, but Scotland drinks the deficiency for us, so as to bring the consump-
tion of the United Kingdom up to about thit rato."
Clearly, no one who reads this will doubt that there are lots of
people now in Scotland who are once a-week, at least, under the influ-
ence of spirits. Instances of second-sight, or of persons who see
double, arc by no means rare in Loudon on occasions, such for instance,
as a Southwark Election; but they must certainly occur much more
frequently in Scotland, where the spirits yearly called from the vasty
deep of whiskey-cellars, are at a double rate per throttle to what they
are with us. We may add, to show our learning, that Dr. Dee and
other ancients raised spirits by the aid of what they called a Magic
Crystal, whereas, in our more modern time, no magic is required, and
a common piece of glass suffices amply for the purpose. Merely with
the aid of an ordinary wiue-glass, any Scotclimau can raise spirits as
high up as his lips, which everybody knows is a sufficient elevation for
anyone whose aim is simply to get elevated.

FLUTED ARMOUR, TEMP. HENRY THE SEVENTH.
[ A SUIT IN MR. PUNCU'3 COLLECTION.
CHAPTER XLI.—BIDS ADIEU TO HENRY THE SEVENTH
AND AU REVOIR TO HENRY THE EIGHTH.
he first of these two sovereigns
was peaceful, we are told, be-
cause he was penurious; and
the other was less famous for
fighting than for flirting. It
is therefore not surprising that,
however much the civil cos-
tume may have changed, we
find in neither of their reigns
much novelty to notice in the
military equipment. As the
royal fingers failed to give the
necessary fillip to it, the ar-
mourers no doubt found their
trade grow somewhat slack;
and so long ns their old stock
remained upon their hands, it
is not very likely that they
troubled their heads much to
think of new improvements.
It seems childish to inquire
whether it was because the
knights were fond of playing
the flute, that their armour in
these days was generally fluted.
But inquiries as ridiculous
have ere now formed the sub-
ject of the learnedest discus-
sion, and the point which we
-P*-*tfs£^M]l&& have mooted may for aught we
know be used as a sort of
mental pickaxe to bring to
light long-buried and most in-
teresting facts. Whatever
were its cause, however, flut-
ing became generally adopted at this period, and all parts of the
armour were more or less thus decorated. That the beauty of the
ornament might not be obscured, the tabard, or emblazoned surcoat,
was discarded; the arms or badges which it bore being in some cases
engraved upon the armour. An instance of this is sliown in the suit
which was presented by the Emperor Maximilian to Kino Henry
the Eighth, by way of souvenir upon his marriage with Katharine
or Arragon,* whose badges are engraved with those of her bad
husband, their initials being united by a true lover's knot. Such of
our young readers as in their Christmas holidays may have their minds
improved by being taken to the Tower, should beg the beefeater to
pause in his rapid act of showmanship, and give them time to get their
breath before this interesting suit. It has the credit of being the best
specimen existing of the period now under notice, and must especially
command the admiration of the ladies when they remember the occasion
for which it was expressly made. Besides the badges and initials, it is
tastily adorned with engravings which are chosen from the Lives of the
Saints • an ornament as fitting to our virtuous King Bluebeard, as
is the decoration of the true lover's knots.
The enormous elbowpieces which were worn in the last reign were
pretty nearly out of fashion in the time of Henrt the Seventh, and
the sword which had been slung in front for a brief period, was now
restored to its usual place as a side-arm. To guard the neck from
lance-pokes, plates which were called passe-gardes were appended to
the shoulders, rising perpendicularly on each side of the head, and
giving wearers somewhat the appearance of the Quakers, who used to
show that they belonged to a stiff-necked generation by the way in
which their coat-collars were cut so as to stand up. For further shield,
the helmet was frequently provided with flexible and overlapping plates
or ribs of steel, which fell upon the neck; so that the blow that is in
schoolboy parlance called a "rabbiter," could have hardly caused
much hurt if given only with the fist. The helmets for the most part
took the shape of the head, and had sometimes a serrated ridge upon
the summit, looking not unlike the coxcomb worn by many of our
Clowns. Somewhat in the fashion of the hats of the civilians, they
were adorned with an extremely long and flowing plume of feathers,
inserted in a pipe just where a pigtail would have sprouted, and streaming
down the back sometimes below the waist. It is stated by authorities
whose truth we dare not question, that these helmets were called bur-
gonets, because they came from Burgundy: an assertion which seems
* We often read of presents being made of armour, and had tfao mania for giving
Testimonials existed, doubtless beadles and Lord Mayors, and other public bene-
factor* would have been presented with a neat suit of plato armour, just as nowa-
days they are with a neat service of plate.
scarcely more supported by the words, than if we said that trousers
were commonly so called because they came from Troy.
As presenting a good picture
of the armour of this period,
we may direct the nation's no-
tice to the brass of " Richard
Gill, late Sergeant of the
Bakehouse,* wyth Kyng
Henrt the VII., and also
wyth King Henry theVIII."
This old worthy died in the
year 1511, the second of the
reign of his latter king and
master, and his brass is still
preserved in the church of
Shottesbrooke, Hampshire,
which it may be he enriched
with some few handfuls of his
tin. From this figure it will
be seen that the sollerets, or
steel shoes, were worn no
longer with long toes, but
had them broad and rounded
instead of coming to a point.
The passe-gardes we have
mentioned are also clearly
visible, and notice should be
taken of the horizontal plates,
called taces, extending from
the breastplate to protect the
hips. As we have seen in the
last reign, two small pointed
plates,called tuilles, are affixed
by straps in front to the lowest
of the taces, so as to give a buroonet. temp, henry the eiohth. sup-

there is visible a short tunic of
mail, which, we thus learn, still continued in military use. In this
respect, however, Serjeant Gyll was certainly old-fashioned in his
dress; for instead of tuilles and taces, skirts of steel, which were called
lamboys, were coming into vogue as being more convenient. These
lamboys (a name doubtless corrupted from lambeaux) were narrow
plates of steel which hung in fluted folds, covering the body from the
waist to the knee, and looking at a distance not unlike a highland kilt.

horse, brandishing with his right hand a formidable sword, and having
qnite a forest of feathers at his back.
With regard to the arms which were used chiefly at this period, we
reserve for the present a particular description, and content ourselves
with merely noticing the fact, that the arquebus was iutroduced about
this time, being an improvement on the hand-cannon, or gonne,
invented m the reign of King Edward the Fourth. Its novelty
consisted in having a sort of lock with a cock to hold the match; and
that this appliance was suggested by the cross-bow, may be reasonably
inferred from the name of arc-a-bouche, which the Britannic tongue, of
course, soon corrupted into arquebus. It seems the military autho-
rities were not much quicker then than now in adopting innovations,
for we titid that though the arquebus and other firearms had come in,
the ancient bow and arrows had not yet gone out. When that formid-
able body, the Yeomen of the Guard, were established in the year
1485, they were armed half with the bow and the others with the
arquebus; just as until Punch brought his cudgel into play, part of
our army had the rifle, while the others were left harmless by being
armed with old Brown Bess. The parallel, however, is not quite cor-
rectly drawn, for the first fire-arms were scarcely an improvement on
the bow; indeed, what with their clumsiness and aptitude to kick, we
may doubt if they were much in favour with the troops. Bows, how-
ever, had been brought to a very perfect state, as even the best shots
among our riflemen must own, when they read of hitting bullseyes at
three hundred yards range, and splitting rival arrows by striking on
their notch.
DANCING CHRISTIANS.
here are people to
whose mouths the
Early Closing Move-
ment had need to be
applied, to prevent
their doing damage
to the doctrines they
whole-hoggishly en-
deavour to support.
Such a person is a
recent correspondent
to the Record, who,
in giving his opinion
upon "Social Amuse-
ments," denounces
dancing as a devilish
and irreligious prac-
tice :—
"I fear that many a so-
called Christian will set
me down for an ascetic,
because I condemn in toto this fascinating but ensnaring amusement. . . What-
ever may be said of dancing, abstractedly, as an Innocent and healthful recreation,
it is a well-known fact that praying dancers have never yet made their appearance
in this world; the species is altogether unknown. An earnest humble spiritually
minded dancing Christian is a phenomenon not yet brought to light. Apologise
for the practice as we will, all evidence tells us that Satan lias never yet devised a
better instrument than dancing for filling the heart and mind with every principle
opposod to the religion of the Bible."
There is a smack of strained facetiousness in the idea of " praying
dancers," which makes us doubt whether the writer intended to be
serious in the rest of his remarks. Indeed, the levity with which such
persons often treat the most solemn of subjects would sadly shock a
sinner, though it might not offend a " saint." That there are dancing
dervishes everybody knows—except the gentleman who sta'es that
they "have not yet made their appearance;" and that there are
Christians who are capable of dancing and likewise of being devout,
each at the right season, nobody, save fools or fanatics, can doubt.
As to calling dancing an invention of the devil, and saving that "all
evidence" proves it is opposed to the religion of the Bible, we know
that general assertions are generally fallacious, and "all evidence," if
sifted, might turn out none at all. That dancing may do harm, under
some conditions, we are ready to admit. For instance, at Casinos it
becomes a recreation neither innocent nor healthful: and the sooner
such ensnaring places are abolished, the better will it be for the morals
of our sons. But to confound such dens of vice with virtuous English
drawing-rooms is to slander the fair name of every lady in the land.
The mind that can see evil in the exercise of dancing as practised in
Bociety at the present day, must be morbidly alive to the terrors of the
evil one, and dead to the enjoyment of any healthy pleasure. We
know that there are men who are so weak in will that they dare not
drink one drop of wine lest they be tempted to get drunk; and simi-
larly imbecile are they who dare not enter the most innocent enjoyment
for fear it should excite them to plunge headlong into vice. Ihey see
peril and temptation where purer eyes see none; and as they pass
their lives in looking out for sin, for their credit's sake they feel they
ought to find it omnipresent. We, who hold a healthier faith, main-

tain that there is far more good in life than evil: and a much less rare
phenomenon than a Christian who can dance, we hold to be a so-called
'saint" who can keep his tongue from slandering, and his heart from
thinking badly of his fellow-creatures.

POPULAR AMUSEMENTS.
The King of Naples is still continuing the game ot
Prisoners' Base that he has been playing now for some
considerable time. He has had a good long innings, bat
we do not see how he can avoid being eventually turned
out. He would not have kept in so long as he has done,
if he had not bad the French on his side. _ However,
we must in fairness compliment 'he King on his admirable
running. Very few Boukbons, quick as they are in that
respect, could have done it better. The game of Fer-
dinand v. United Italt promises to be one of the most
interesting in the Italian Bell's Life of popular sports and

at one time, had the whole field to himself, should have
retired at so early a period from the game.
An Unexpected Return.

The return is all the more welcome, as it was totally

IN THE NAME OF HIGH-ART!
To Mr. Punch.
"Sir,
"My hair stood on end eight days ago (and has ever since
obstinately refused to lie down) as I read in last week's Spectator, in
a review of a New History of Edwabd the First, the following
passage, for which I can only find the epithet' Outrageous :'—
"In b credulous acre fictions will grow up; but in an Incredulous age why should
they be repeated t we would ruthleaaly extirpate all 'graceful fancies' and 'beau-
tiful legends' from history, making tbem oyer to the poets, to whom they properly
belong. When they are admitted as facte into tho historian's pago. they sometimes
falsify and pervert reality to a degree that justifies any amount of Indignation.
Among thtu piclurttqut lift, vt btiUve, are now included the story of Rosamond and
her Bower; the story of Eleanor's heroism in drawing the poison from Edward's
wound; the tale of Quiin PuiurPA and the Citizens of Calais; the murder of the
Bards; the tale of Canu t, He. Ac."
"Really, Mr. Punch, it' is difficult to retain one's patience at such
profanity. Is the senseless miscreant who penned the above, blind to
the fact, that if there be incidents in history which come home to
men's businesses and bosoms, they are precisely those which he has
the impudence here to describe as 'picturesque lies?' Is he not
aware that they are exactly the subjects invariably selected by our
historical painters (from the Royal Academicians upwards) for their
illustrations of the History of England P Does he not know, or must
I tell him, that at the great competition of the cartoons in West-
minster Hall, there were no less than four Eleanors, three Philippas
and six Canutes sent in f Need I inform him, that there is no Exhi-
bition of the Royal Academy but has treatments of these soul-inspiring
subjects sent in by the score—though the majority of them are, of
course, rejected by the venal stupidity of the council P Will he allow
me to state that I have myself in my own studio (102, Newman Street,
first-floor bell) at this moment, designs for these very five incidents—
with Cabactactjs, Alfred founding Trial by Jury, ditto Burning
Cake, and Discovery of the body of Harold)—as portions of my series
of colossal subjects from the History of England, intended for the
decoration of Westminster Hall, so soon as the direction of the Fine
Arts of this country is transferred from the hands of an irresponsible
German-ridden clique, and a toad-eating, tuft-hunting Academy, to
men capable of discovering and rewarding real genius P And am I to
be told that facts on which my youthful imagination has feasted—I
designed a Philippa and Citizens of Calais in their shirts, at thirteen,
in chalk on the garden palings (which excited the astonishment of all
who saw it till erased by a brutal and soulless incoming tenant)—
occurrences which have employed the research of a Goldsmith, the
picturesqueness of a Pinnock, and the glowing periods of a Hume
and Smollett—act ious which have inspired the pencils of our noblest
painters from the gigantic but ill-requited Fooao, down to the writer
of this letter, whose name, though not yet inscribed in the scroll of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SOUTHERN CHIVALRY.
edacious Jons J. Pettus, the
Governor of slave-holding and
repudiating Mississippi, in his
Message to the State Legis-
lature, makes the following
proposal, among other sugges-
tions for organising rebellion:
"I recommend that a coat of
arms be adopted for the State of
Mississippi."
There's chivalry for you.
The like of it has been seen
since the Crusades, but not
since the extinction of the
British chivalrous Ministry
that opposed Free Trade.
Freedom was the enemy with
whom the Derbyite chevaliers
contended. The foe of the
Mississippi chevaliers is also
Freedom. Our native knight-
hood struggled against com-
mercial liberty. Their brethren
of the American order are con-
tending against the liberty of
man. Such sons of chivalry
ought, by all means, to have
a coat of arms- as the Com-
mandant of the Mississippi
branch or chapter of the order
rightly suggests. A slave-
owner rampant azure, on a
field argent, between a nigger
sable, fettered, at work, and an Abolitionist proper preaching on a
stump of the same. Crest: a cowhide, gules. This blazonry would,
perhaps, meet the necessities of the case, and answer the requirements
of Transatlantic heraldry. The motto of the Mississippi shield might
be Fiat Injustitia, ruat Caelum.
The conclusion of knight-errant Sir John J. Pettus's address is a
fine specimen of the knightly faith and devotion characteristic of his
peculiar order of knighthood:—
"Can we hesitate, when one bold resolve, bravely executed, makes powerless the
aggressor, and one united effort makes safe our homes? May the God of our fathers
put it into the hearts of the people to make it."
The Crusaders invoked Sr. Mart when they charged the Saracen or
rushed to the slaughter of any other fellow-men. Bolder in blas-
pheming is the champion of slavery.
not yet blest with the presence of its Punch, and had therefore not
yet learned the lesson he has taught,—that it is possible to be most
exquisitely fanny without offending either good morals or good taste.
"'Tis sixty years since" (to quote the title-page of Waverley) a play
of Plautus has been played before a British audience; and, clearly,
the revival must not pass unnoticed in the columns of so classical a
journal as is Punch. But space is here so precious, that an inch or
two is all which can be spared to tell the universe that, thanks to a
judicious use of the pruning-knife, the Trinummus has been fitted for
the modern stage, and acted with such success, that Punch really half
expestcd to hear the cry of "Author!" raised at the conclusion, and
to see the ghost of Plautus bowing his acknowledgment from a
private box. The old man eloquent, Charmides, the comic servant,
Stasimus, the good young man, Lysiteles, and the Charles Surface
Lesbonicus, carried on their conversation with such extreme vivacity,
that one could hardly believe one's ears were hearing a dead language;
while many a "heavy father" of the trans-Thamesian stage might have
fitly learned a lesson from the Messieurs Megaronides—a character so
ponderous that it took two actors to sustain the part.
Nor can Punch pass the Epilogue without a word or two of praise.
Especially he owns, he was tickled with the passage describing the
position of Westminster School, and the privilege of its scholars to
attend the House of Commons during a debate:—
"Tbamesis hie refluit vitreis argenteus undis,
Et placido lintres fertque rufertque sinu:
Atque ubi vicinas praetoxens Curia ripas
Verticl multiplied tollit ad ostra caput,
Audit quanta fori facundiu, quanta Senatus,
lliscit et eloquii fingere verba puer."
The notion of its nearness to the "glassy waters" of the "silver
Thames" being cited as a reason for not rusticating the School, struck
Mr. Punch as being most deliciously facetious; and when he pictured
the young Westminsters learning eloquence by listening to such
speakers as the Wiscotjnt, Mr. Punch broke out at once in such a
choking fit of laughter, that all the ladies in the stalls had to pat him
on the oack, before he could succeed in recovering his breath.
PUNCH AND PLAUTUS AT WESTMINSTEK PLAY.
When Mr. Punch, a year ago, complained of having to pass
Christmas without going to Westminster Play, he felt sure that the
authorities would pay due heed to his complaint; and he begs now to
remind " Old Westminsters" in general that it is to him their thanks
are mainly due, for reviving an old custom which was threatened with
disuse. "All work and no Play" was about to be adopted as the
maxim of the School, when, happily, the just wrath of Mr. Punch was
aroused, and by a timely word of warning he saved many a future Jack
from becoming a dull ooy through the fate that seemed impending.
Mr. Punch, who is all modesty, would not have hinted at this fact, but
that there are people who are painfully unconscious of it, and who,
when "See, the Conquering Hero comes," was played the other
evening upon Mr. Punch entrance (arm-in ..rm with his good friend
the Head-master of \L K ->ol), were not aware that it was to the
former learned gentlemt. .uu the compliment was paid, for his bravery
in conquor'ng the giants Whim and Prejudice, who had succeeded, for
a time, in prohibiting the Play.
Could old Plautus have obtained leave of absf" e'~ ihe Shades,
and brought his opera-glass to Westminster -t his Tri-
nummus, he would somewhat have been - jccognise his
offspring, so much was it improved anH ocent was its dress.
Justus Lipsius, the reader knows, caV. aUTUS the Tenth Muse;
but it is not every one would echo Justbi. Lipsius, who might rather
be called Sursius, for having made so great a slip. Were Plautus
to write now, his jokes would nu* be listened to in any decent society,
and their point would scarsely even be thought sharp enough to do for
a burlesque. The wit of the old playwright is a great deal more
remarkable for breadth than for its depth: and, in spite of their good
scholarship, it would puzzle the young Westminsters to translate his
plays entire, if their mothers or their sisters asked them so to do. It
must, however, be remembered that, in the classic age, the world was
A DISTINCTION FOR LORD ROBERT MONTAGUE.
A Whip, we know, the Tory party needs,
Now Joliffe's vigorous hand has grown enervate,
"Lord Robert Montague," say some, "succeeds,"
"No," says the Press, and hints he don't deserve it.
Now, in his Garibaldi-letter's name,
Let not Lord Robert's budding fame be nipped,
His Lordship to the lash has clearly claim—
If not to whip, yet surely to be whipped.
FOLK LORE.
The custom of putting the Yule Log on the fire at Christmss
originally arose from the inclemency of the season, and the want of
coals. It is now practised chiefly in places where coals are dearer than
wood, for the purpose of saving them.
Mistletoe was suspended from the roof-tree, because it grows upon
other trees, and also because of a superstition connected with it. This
parasitical plant was supposed to protect children from the thrush,
which feeds on its berries. The reason why mistletoe is now hung on
to the ceiling is too ridiculous to be mentioned.
Holly is stuck about the house on account of the holydays.
A Capital Bad One.
If prizes were to be given for bad conundrums, we think the follow-
ing would infallibly and triumphantly win the biggest prize:—
Why is the Electric Telegraph no new invention?
Because it is precisely the Same-afore (Semaphore).
The prize adjudged accordingly. It is a copy of Martin Luther
Farquhar Congreve Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, bound in

CHAPTER XLII.-IN WHICH WE TAKE ANOTHER SIGHT AT

with our histories are fur-
nished, are all as vague
and visionary, and almost
as much alike, as the
5hosts seen by Macbeth.
ndeed. so strong is the
resemblance between their
"gold-bound brows," that
one feels tempted to ex-
claim, with him, "Why
do you show me this F"
It is a pity that the pliant
and retentive mind of
childhood should be stamped with such absurdly false impressions
of our sovereigns; and some time or other, when we have a month's
leisure (a period which may arrive when they have paid the Delhi
prize-money, and put up Nelson's lions, and the monument to
Wellington in the Cathedral of St. Paul), we mean to write a
Book of British History for Babies, in which the kings shall all be
dressed in the costume of the period, their portraits being copied with
the utmost pains and nicety, from photographs supposed to nave been
taken from the life.
Hall, the noted chronicler, who lived in the sixteenth century, thus
describes King Harhy's "get-up" at a banquet held at Westminster
in the first year of his reign, which, our readers may remember, was the
nineteenth of his age:—
"Hys Majesty dyd wear shorte gannenta reaching but little beneath y« pointes,
of blew velvet and crymosyne, with long sleeves, all cut and lynedwith cloth of
gold, aud y# uttor(i.e. outer) parts of ye garments powdered with castles and sheafes
of arrowes (the badges of his Queen, Catherine) of fyne dokett (ducat) goldo ; the
upper part of the hoaon of like sewte and iacion; the nether parts of scarlet, pow-
dered with tymbrelles of fine golde. On hys head was a bonnet of dainaske silvre,
flatte woven in y* atoll, and thereupon wrought with golde and ryche feathers in it."
The sovereign clearly thought no small change of himself when he
carried on his person such a lot of gold and silver. But it was not
merely by the richness of his dress that the young monarch displayed
his love of being in the fashion. The "shorte garments ot blew
velvet" were a recent innovation, probably from Paris, at least, if we
may trust to the authority of Shakspeare, who makes Sir Thomas
Lovell quote a proclamation, bidding all the travelled gallants of the
Court, that they must— ,
'"leave these remnants
Of fool and leather, that they got in France, * * *
(Out of a foreign wisdom) renouncing clean,
The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,
Short blistered breeches, and those types of travel."
These breeches extended to the middle of the tjjigh, and were
slashed and stuffed and puffed so as to give a rather swollen appear-
ance to the hips. They were made of velvet, silk, and satin, coloured
and embroidered cloths, or gold and silver stuffs, and were attached by
points or laces to the doublet, just as small boys used to have their
trousers buttoned to their jackets, when they wore those frightful
"roley-poley" suits. Properly, these breeches were called a "pair of
hose; a name which must not be confounded with the long close-
fitting stockings which covered the remainder of the leg down to the
feet. The v. riters of the time not being so in fear of critics as they
miuht be now, applied the term of "hose to either of these garments,
and have thereby greatly puzzled the wise heads of many antiquaries.
We must, however, caution people against fancying that the stockings
* This title Henry gained on coming to the throne, being then, says Snooke, "in
j« flowere of hys youth, and not having shewed hys thorne by sticking it iutoo
people in y» shape of taxes." The words were out of compliment stamped upon his
coin : just as " Punch Protector" should have been on the new penny.
which were worn beneath the hose were a whit like what we buy as
hose, or stockings, now-a-days, in an inventory of the Royal wardrobe
(kings were much more careful then than even commoners are now, we
think, for we know no one who would dream of keeping a Best Clothes
list), we find an entry of " A yarde and a quarter of grene velvet for
stocks to a payr of hose for >* king's grace, and another of the same
quantity of purpul satin to cover >* stocks of a payr of hose of purpul
cloth of gold tissue for the kynge."
The first use of the word "waistcoat" occurs in an Inventory towards
the close of this reign, and the garment which it designated was made
apparently to supersede the stomacher and placard, which had been
previously worn as a protection to the chest. The waistcoat, like an
ostler's, had a pair of sleeves, but, unlike an ostler's, was made of rich
materials, such as "cloth of silver, quilted with black silk, and tuffed
out with fine camerike," as cambric was then called. It was worn
under the doublet, but was visible, no doubt, through the tlitterings
and slashings wherewith all the upper garments were disfigured at this
period. Illustrating this queer fashion, Camden, in his Bemaines, tells
a " merrie jeste" anent a shoemaker of Norwich, who was named John
Drakes, and deserved, as we shall see, to have been called a goose!
Of this worthy we are told that—
"Coming to a tailor's and finding somo French tawnoy clolho which had there
been sent to be made into a gowno for one Sir Philip Calthorp, he dyd take a
fancy to y» colour, and dyd ordore y taylour to buy as much of y« same stuff and
make a gowne for him precisely of y" fashion of y< knight's. Sir Philip, coming to
be measured, dyd spy this piece of clothe and dyd ask y* snip who was y* knave
that ordered it 'John Drakes,' replied y« Uilor, 1 ana hee will have it made y«
selsame faoion as your own.* 'Well, well,' growled y« knight, 'so in good time be
it. I will have mine as full of cuU as thy shears can make it.' Both g-arraenU
being finished according to y* ordor, y shoemakero on seeing his was slashed almost
to shreds dyd begin to swere most luatilee, but said to him y« toy lor, * I have done but
what you bade me, for as Sir Philip's gowne is even soe have'l made yours.* * By
my latchet I' groaned y* cobblere, 'I will stick to my old clothes, than, and will
never seek to dress as a gentleman again.'"
The gown which is here mentioned was worn over the doublet, and
was a short garment with sleeves, stuffed and puffed so as to give a
great breadth to the shoul-
ders. These sleeves were
made detached, and were
fastened on by means of
points or buttons, the latter
often being of the finest
gold, begemmed with pearls
and precious stones. The
words jacket, coat, and
jerkin were indifferently
applied by way of synonym
for gown; and we find in
the king's inventories men-
tion made of several descrip-
tions of coats, such as long
coats * and short coats,
d( mi-coat a and tunic coats,
riding coats and walking
coats, leather coats and
coats with skirts, which
show the gown or coat was
capable of change in cut.
Judging from his clothes'
lists, King Bluebeard must
have been as fond of chang-
ing coats as he was of
changing wives, and we
can fancy how he used to call upon his tailor, and order "some more
coats," in the manner of the exquisite who, to pass an idle hour, used
to dawdle about town, and order "some more gigs."
To finish our description, we may add that shirts were worn by those
who could afford them, a qualification which an Act of Parliament
defined to be the having of an income of a hundred marks a year.
They (we mean the shirts) were embroidered very frequently with
either silk, or gold or silver, and were made plain or plaited, whioh was
then called "pinched." Cloaks and mantles are described by Hall of
wondrous great magnificence, the former being sometimes slung
baldrick-wise across the chest, so as not to hide the gorgeous under-
garments. Slashed shoes of velvet, with very broad round toes, making
their wearers look as though they had the gout, are the form of pedal
envelope peculiar to this period; and—to jump from toe to top—the
broad slouched hat of Henry the Seventh, with its gigantic pea-
coek's-lail-like spreading plume of feathers, gave place in this reign to
a small fiat cap or bonnet, which looked like a smashed gibus, and was
adorned with a single ostrich feather at the side. We may add, too,

C08TDMB OF THE NOBILITY. TEMP. nkNKY
THE ElOHTH.
* It seems from this that long coats were not solely the distinction of the
as might be inferred from the Earl 0/ Surrey $ speech to Cardinal Welsey, which
doubtless every play-goer must quite well recollect :—
'By my soul.
Your long coat, priest, protects you
My sword i' the life-blood of thee else I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
that while the face was either shaved or not, according to the pleasure
or the nature of its owner, the hair upon the head was compulsorily
cropped; for King Bluebeard (who perhaps was blessed with a short
crop) issued the most peremptory orders to his Court, that the long
hair which had been in fashion in his father's time should be worn no
longer. How the Absaloms of the period relished this new edict,
history omits to state; but we think they must have gone as regretful
to the polling-place as an elector who is voting to oblige his Tory land-
lord, and has therefore to decline a liberal offer for his vote.
With thi* Chapter Mr. Punch clou*, for the present, his History of Costume. Thi*
he is impelled to do purely by the fear list he should ovcrultelm his readers rcith the
mass of erudition he has weekly been imparting to them. Mu. Pi.'NCH, however, hopes
ere many volumes pas*, to {rive a second course of lectures on the subject i to which
completing series, all the pupils he has had, will be privileged to subscribe, as will aay
body el e who is competent to pay for it.
CHARACTER OF THE BRITISH ARMY.
A Leading article in the Morning Post contains the alarming
statement subjoined:—
"It is no doubt more difficult to maintain dlsciplino in the British than in the
Continental armies, for thia among other reasons—that for the most part the man
who enlists in the British army is in general, as the OtilM or Wkijjmjton said, 'the
most drunken aud probably the worst man of the trado or profession to which he
belongs, or of the villago or town in which he lives.'"
If this declaration of the great Duke's still holds true, we are in a
bad way. We have an army consisting of blackguards, whom we have
no Iron Duke to keep in order, though the Duke of Cambridge
seems to manage them pretty well. The above-quoted passage relative to
the components of the British Army quite surprises us. We thought the
British soldier enjoyed the certainty of three meals a day, well cooked;
was housed in warm but well ventilated barracks, provided with clean
and comfortable dormitories, in which the married men were all sepa-
rated from the single—dormitories furnished with every convenience.
We believed that the soldiers were clothed and armed, as well as fed,
wholly and entirely at the public expense, which would fully account
for the Income-Tax. In addition to all gratuitous necessaries, and
some comforts, equally free, we imagined them to be in the receipt of
a daily shilling pocket-money. If it is indeed still true that, for the
most part, the man who enlistsjin the British Army is not, contrarily to
what the Duke of Wellington once said, one of the best men of his
trade or profession, we shall begin to think that we were mistaken in
our ideas of the soldier's lot, and shall be led to fancy that he must be
ill fed, ill lodged, and supplied in a great measure at his own cost,
having his pay subject to various stoppages, which reduce it to a figure
considerably under fourpence a day.
THE POPE AND THE BALLET.
The Pontifical Government, according to the Times, allows the
Roman opera 18,000 crowns a-year. A good many Peter's pence,
therefore, go into the short petticoats and pink tights of the ballet-
girls, unless their petticoats are as long as those of his Holiness him-
self, who also, like the danseuses, wears white satin shoes. The Pofe
patronises the ballet, like a good old gentleman. Fancy the Jolly
Father going behind the scenes, and imparting his paternal benediction
to the coryphees by poking them in the waist with his thumb and two
first fingers.
A New Musical Movement.
We have already had Songs Without Words. Now, as the words of
an opera are never heard, aud, moreover, as the libretto of an opera,
when heard, is not, nine hundred and ninety-nine instances out of a
thousand, ever worth listening to, would it not be a great gain to have
an Opera Without Words? No one would miss the absence of the
latter, and the omission might probably be an additional inspiration to
the composer, inasmuch as he would not be hampered by the nonsense
to which he is generally called upon to wed immortal music. The
public would gain largely on that score.
The New Bishop.
"A Good appointment? No, it's not,"
Said old beer-drinking Peter Watts,
"At Worcester one but hears 'Phil-pot,' ]
At generous Exeter, 'Phil-pots.'
A Bale Splitting Compliment.
It is not oftt n we pay compliments, especially to Americans, but we
confess we do like complimenting an honest man, when by chance we
meet with one. We suggest, therefore, with great pride and pleasure,
that the White House at Washington should change its name, and
henceforth—out of honour to the President elect, and as a graceful
record commemorating his election—be called Lincoln's"

DIZZY TO THE RESCUE.
When British Bucolicals cowered in dismay,
As Cobden and Peel struck the Corn Laws away,
Who lifted the flag they had dropped in the path,
Gave voice to their vengeance, and wit to their wrath,
Set flame to the fire that they hid in their hearts,
With poison and point tipped their impotent darts,
Though in-BuKKE's County Gentry his name was unknown,
Though no rent-roll he showed, called no acre his own,
Though he ne'er handled ox, nor knew barley from rye?
"Who," Vivian Grey may ask proudly, "but I?"
And now, when the Church in alarm looks around,
When its canons are rusty, its mitres unsound,
When its synodals rive, and its articles rend,
And the garrison squabble that ought to defend,
When Neology scales e'en the citadel's walls,
And Heresy whispers in grey College Halls,
When tolerance holds to Dissenters the hand,
'And Church-rates by tott'ring majorities stand,
Who springs to the helm, at the ship's deepest lurch,
And summons to quarters the crew of the Church,
Though one whom no Oxford nor Cambridge has nursed,
■ With orthodox swaddlings unblessed or uncursed,
Who from Abraham's bosom his nourishment drew,
In name, as in look and lineage a Jew—
Who, with alien hand the Church flag lifts on high r

Happy ye who gaily go
'Neath the joyous mistletoe,
Or enjoy life's giddy whirl.
Waltzing with a lively girl.
Happy ye of riper age,
Who in the dance no more engage,
But deem of Christmas joys the chief,
Its turkey, pudding, pies, and beef.
But ah! The mistletoe looks grim
When you see her t here with him! I

Lest haply one for draughts and pills
May help to swell your Christmas bills.
CIVILISATION IN RUSSIA.
The Deuce is not so deep of dye as painters have repre-
sented him, nor are the Russians so barbarous as they
are commonly supposed. Fools and bullies arc discouraged
from duelling as far as possible by heavy penalties. Never-
theless, a dnel was fought the other day between two
blockheads in the Russian army, Lieutenant Prince
Gortschakoff and Lieutenant Baron Fitinghoff.
The name of the latter fool or ruffian was, we trust, a
nickname which he acquired by his fire-eating propensities.
He got his bellyful this time, however: he was shot.
Three other numskulls acted as seconds and partici-
pators in this affair of folly. The surviviug duellist has
been deprived of his orders and reduced to the ranks.
The two more culpable of the seconds are imprisoned in
casemated barracks, one for four and the other for six
months. These are commuted sentences. The bullet-
headed fools had incurred social as well as military
degradation, and eight years' confinement in a fortress.
They manage these things in Russia better than in France,
where society is at the mercy of practised assassins, whom
it permits to hold a pistol to the head of anybody they
may wish to murder, and demand his money or his life.

Is a move in the right line, John Bull must confess.
Of Passports he thanks you for setting him free,
And is glad to accept from your hands a latch-key,
Right oft his vast shadow will darken your door,
Now his visit you've rendered exempt from a bore.
In another point also he owns you've done good;
In giving France free trade—as free as you could.
And gratitude under his great waistcoat glows,
For the Treaty of Commerce, as far as it goes.
Now if you will only recall your troops home,
And let Italy deal with Gaeta and Rome,
We shall say that you've nobly wound up a good year,
And your health drink in claret—exchanged for our beer.

when they published a picture said to contain capital likenesses of all

PILLARS OF THE PAPACY.
According to telegram :—
"The Pontifical Zouaves have re-entered Rome.'
Just the men to sustain the Papal chair on the points of their
bayonets! The late Lady Morgan's revelation touching St. Peter's
chair, showed that if Peter owned that chair, he probably bought
it at some Mahometan sale, or was presented with it by a Mussulman
convert; moreover, that Peter thought fit ta retain the inscription on
the chair, which acknowledged Mahomet for the Prophet. As
St. Peter could not have posses«el tnat article of furniture consis-
tently with chronology, the fact of nis chair is, of courso, a miracle;
and accordingly, the chair ought to support itself as well, at least, as
one of Mr. Home's tables; but, if not self-sustaining, this Ottoman-
chair of Peter can have no better support than the bayonets of
Zouaves.
Holy Vestments for the Church.
The attention of every one is requested to the fact, that there
exists a Society for supplying the Clergy with cast-off clothes. Please
copy the address, 345, Strand. It is really the fact, and no mistake,
ana no joke—except at the expense of the opulent Bishops and rich
Deans who permit the Society to exist.
