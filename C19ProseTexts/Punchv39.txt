THE GREAT REFORMER CONFUCIUS AND THE GREATER REFORMER, MR. PUNCH,
MEET IN THE CATHEDRAL OF PEKIN.
UNCH. Hail, most illustrious, preposterous, and antibilious philosopher | I forget your honourable and
distinguished Chinese name.
CoNFUCIUs. My ignoble and contemptible appellation in the vulgar language of this unworthy country
is spelt Koong-Foo-Tsee, oh, nine times to be venerated and idolised PUNCH ! The intolerable Jesuits converted
it (I entreat your pardon for speaking again on so miserable a matter) into the ridiculous Latin word by which I
am ticketed in literature.
PUNCH. Odoriferous and beatific Koong-Foo-Tsee, I trust that your adorable wife and your unap
proachable son are well.
CoNFUCIUs. Elaborated and interminable Punch, it is fitting that the microscopic details of my insignifi-
cant history should escape your lordly recollection, and that you should not accord in the golden amber of your
celestial mind a place for such undignified flies as my objectionable old woman and my unappreciable brat. Else
you might remember that I turned them both out of my abominable doors, in order that I might be undisturbed
in my philosophic meditations for the good of China.
PUNCH. Ah! so you did, most philanthropic, and thereby you transcended myself, who only beat my
wife and threw my baby out of window. But still we are brothers, and I am ecstatic at meeting you in this
place. I hope that the hymns of the West, once more chanted in the Cathedral of Pekin, have not been
offensive to you, Koong-Foo-Tsee.
CoNFUCIUs. Nay, most considerate, I rejoice that a war which began in smuggling ends in psalmody.
PUNch. None of your scoffs, most analytic. Do you not see that it is to your own teaching that the
Chinese owe any little inconvenience or humiliation they may have sustained?
CoNFUCIUs. Telescopic and retrospective Punch, may I be eviscerated if I see anything of the kind.
PUNCH. Thou wert monops inter cacos, Koong-roo-TsKE, but I may now remark, that there thou goest
with thine eye out.
CoNFUCIUs. My object is truth, O PUNch, and I would humbly request elucidation of thy proposition.
PUNCH. Thou didst write a heap of books, Koong-Foo-Tsee, and thou didst preach a heap of sermons, and
thou didst make some seventy thousand disciples, of whom seventy-two were Stunners and ten were Out-and-Outers.

iv. PREFACE. |December 29, 1860.
Confucius. My contemptible public history, O PUNch, seems at the ends of thy aristocratic fingers.
PUNCH. No, Sir, I have nothing there but eight Chesterfieldian nails, which I flatter myself are neatly
cut by the affectionate scissors of the partner of my expenses and heart. But I have perused your Life. You
founded a system on which became based the morals and manners of China.
CoNFUCIUs. All is serene.
PUNCH. No, Sir, all is not Serene, and what serenity has endured for so many centuries has not been the
repose of virtue, but the stagnation of impotence. You taught passive obedience, the divine right of Kings, and
an outward and artificial morality, which, in combination with your theocratic doctrines, made the Chinaman an
automaton. So he has become vicious and helpless, and we have been obliged to invent Armstrong guns in
order to rectify the defects of your system. Now, you are shut up. Or do you want to argufy?
CoNFUcrus. O, concise and irresistible ! I am convinced. I knock my head—theoretically—ninety-nine
times on this pavement, and own myself duller than its thickest stone.
PUNch. Enough, Koong-roo-tsee, when a gentleman apologises, no more must be said. And how do
you think we have put together the Chinese Puzzle”
CoNFUcIUs. Well, O PUNCH, the war is over, the Chinese will have to pay some five millions of pounds
sterling, and trade will be thrown open. But I confess that a great deal more is wanting, before it can be said
that the West has done its work for the regeneration of the East.
PUNCH. Proceed, apostle of the Blue Firmament, which, as you ought to have known, is not blue at all.
CoNFucius. Can we all be Punches Let me say that China wants a Teacher.
PUNCH (colouring deeply). It may be so.
CoNFucius. A Teacher who can do what I failed in effecting. One who, from the elevated platform of
a magnificent intellect, can survey mankind from the spot on which we stand to Peru, wherever that is—
PUNCH. It is in South America, and is situated between 3° 30' and 21°28' south latitude, 68°20' and
81° 20' west longitude, you ignorant old bloater.
Confucius. I don’t care. A Teacher, I say, who combines the sternest justice with the kindest affection;
Custom, and Faith, and Power who spurneth, from guilt and fear whose heart is free, ardent and pure as day
who burneth, for cold and dark mortality—
PUNCH. If you are going to spout SHELLEY all the afternoon, I shall light a cigar. I always take smoke
with my poetry.
Confucius. You know whom I was endeavouring to describe.
PUNCH (modestly). Acting up to the precept GNothi SEAutoN, I do.
Confucius. Then, do your duty, O Magnanimous, and be the Guide, Philosopher, and Friend of China.
Punch (covered with blushes). My dear Koong-roo-tsee, I will. I am just sending out to the world in
general, and Pekin in particular, my
Čirin-flint ºnlimt.

POLITICAL SUMMARY.
WE continue from the preceding volume our summary of
the Italian struggle and of other events of the year.
FERDINAND THE SEcond, despite the remonstrance of his
uncle, the Count of SYRAcuse, resolved to cling to sove-
reignty to the last, but his Ministry resigned, and sought
shelter on board a British man-of-war: his troops deserted him,
shouting “Viva Garibaldi / " In the bitterness of his soul he
exclaimed, “Then I am abandoned by all !” and he determined
to leave his capital, which GARIBALDI was rapidly approaching.
He issued a proclamation, in which he declared that he had
not entertained a single thought that was not devoted to the
happiness and good of his subjects, and on the morning of the
6th of September embarked on board a steamer, and sailed to
Gaëta, a strong fortress on the coast, which, with that of
Capua, was all that now remained to him of his dominions.
Two days afterwards GARIBALDI entered Naples with a
few of his staff, having reached it from Salerno by the railway
train He came, not at the head of victorious legions with all
the pomp and circumstance of war, but as a first-class pas-
senger in a railway carriage He had dethroned the Bourbon
dynasty, and marched from Melito to Naples, with hardly the
loss of a single man since the moment when he first set foot on
the Calabrian shore.
Meantime in the Papal States insurrectionary movements
were taking place everywhere. At Tesaro, in the Marches,
and at Montefeltro, Urbino, and other towns, the inhabitants
rose in revolt, and proclaimed Victor-EMMANUEL as their
King. This happened at the beginning of September.
The Papal Government had made every effort to increase its
army, and recruiting agents had been sent into different
countries to procure volunteers. In Ireland a considerable
number of men were collected, who left the island on pretence
of being employed as “navvies” or railway labourers, but
the object of their departure was perfectly well known.
GENERAL LAMoRICIERE was appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Pontifical army.
GENERAL LAMoRICIERE met with great difficulties. Want
of money.—£20,000 sent by the Pope to Ancona disappeared
nobody seemed to know how—scarcely any bread could be
obtained for his troops, owing to the oppressive toll which had
been levied by the Government upon the mills. After several
adverse engagements, all more or less important, and in which
the Irish mercenaries were the first to fly, LAMoRICIERE was
so signally defeated that he abandoned the field accompanied
only by a few horsemen, and succeeded in reaching Ancona,
whilst the remains of his beaten army retired upon Loretto,
where next day they laid down their arms. Ancona was then
compelled to surrender, and with it there fell into the hands
of the conquerors 154 pieces of artillery, among which were
two field batteries, with all their equipment of chariots, &c.,
and ammunition, 180 horses, 100 oxen, 250,000 miriagrams
of flour, 25,000 rations of forage, provisions of all kinds, two
steamers, two trabaccoli (coasting vessels), coal stores, clothing,
arms, and 4,125,000 f.
“The fall of Ancona terminated this short campaign,” writes GENERAL
FANT1, “but no less glorious for your Majesty's army. In 18 days we won
the places of Pesaro, Urbino, Perugia, Spoleto, San Leo, and Ancona. There
fell into our hands 28 field-pieces, 160 pieces of wall-artillery, 20,000 muskets,
more than 500 horses, and from 17,000 to 18,000 prisoners, with all the enemy's
generals."
The state of Naples under GARIBALDI was very unsatis-

factory, and tumults had to be repressed and popular feeling
controlled—not always with the best discretion on the part of
the Dictator. GARIBALDI, however, had performed wonders
in the field before the entry of the Piedmontese army into the
Neapolitan territory. On the 1st of October was fought the
Battle of Volturno, when the Royalist troops were commanded
by the King in person. The Wolunteers were at first worsted,
but succeeded ultimately, after fighting many hours, in de-
feating the Royalist troops, who retired behind the Volturno,
and into the fortress of Capua. It was computed that the
Royalist force consisted of 30,000 men, while the Volunteers
under GARIBALDI did not exceed half that number.
In a few days afterwards the Piedmontese army crossed the
frontier into the Abruzzi, and took the direction of Capua.
The leading columns, under GENERAL CIALDINI, were attacked
by the Royalist forces on the heights of Macerone, near
Isernia, on the 21st of October; but in less than half an hour
the contest was decided, and the Neapolitans were completely
defeated, leaving many prisoners in the hands of the Pied-
montese.
This success of the Sardinian troops was announced by
GARIBALDI to the Neapolitans in a proclamation, in which he
said:—
"The army of LAMoR1ct has has been defeated by those valiant men. All
the provinces, slaves of the Pope, are free. Ancona is ours. The valiant
soldiers of the army of the north have passed the frontier, and are on the
Neapolitan soil. Shortly we shall have the fortune to grasp the right hands
of the brave." -
GARIBALDI himself soon afterwards advanced with a body
of Volunteers to meet the KING, who was marching at the
head of his army upon the line of the Volturno. Their first
interview took place between Teano and Speranzano on the
26th of October, and a picturesque account of it appeared in
the Journal des Debats, which is worth quoting:—
“Seeing the red shirts, the KING took a glass, and having recognised
GARIBALDI, gave his horse a touch of the spur and galloped to meet him.
At ten paces distant the officers of the KING and those of GARIBALDI shouted,
* Viva Victor-Emmanuel / " Garibaldi made another step in advance, raised
his cap, and added, in a voice which trembled with emotion, “King of Italy f'
Victor-EMMANUEL raised his hand to his cap, and then stretched out his
hand to GARIBALDI, and with equal emotion replied, ‘I thank you.'"
The liberators, commanded by Victor-EMMANUEL in person,
gained another victory at Capua, and the defeated Royalists
retreated in haste to Gaëta, excepting a portion who crossed
the frontier close to Terracina, into the Papal territory. Gaëta
would have soon followed had it been attacked by sea, but
this the Sardinians were not allowed to do, as the EMPERoR
of THE FRENCH interfered to allow, he said, the KINg of
NAPLEs a chance of escape, or to make an honourable capitu-
lation, and so save his Majesty from becoming the prisoner of
the Kng of SARDINIA, the consequence being that Gaëta
was only invested on the land side, and a tedious siege com-
menced, which lasted to the end of the year, causing much
useless bloodshed. Within a certain radius of the Eternal
City the Piedmontese were compelled to halt, and GENERAL
Guyon was restored to his command of the French troops in
Rome.
At the beginning of November the people elected WICTOR-
EMMANUEL as their constitutional King. The votes being
1,302,064 in the affirmative and 10,312 in the negative.
On the 7th VICTOR-EMMANUEL made his entry into Naples,
and immediately issued a proclamation, in which he said:—
“The results of the vote by universal suffrage give me the sovereign power
over these noble provinces. I accept this new award of the national will,
moved not by any monarchic ambition, but by conscientious feelings as an
page
Italian. The duties of all Italians are augmented. Sincere concord and
constant self-denial are more than ever necessary. All parties must bow
before the majesty of the Italian nation, which God uplifts. We must here
inaugurate a Government which may give security of free existence to the
people and of severe rectitude to public opinion. . . . .”
He immediately visited the Cathedral; and the multitude
had the satisfaction of finding that their patron saint, St.
Januarius, was not displeased at recent events, for his blood
liquefied in the usual orthodox manner.
GARIBALDI did not remain in the territory which he had
added to the Crown of Sardinia. He quitted Naples for the
Island of Caprera on the 9th of November, two days after
WICTOR-EMMANUEL entered it. The exact cause of this
abrupt departure is not yet known. The King, however, was
lavish in his offer of honours and emoluments to the hero, to
whom he owed so much ; but GARIBALDI was inflexible in his
refusal to accept them; and he withdrew to Caprera, after
distributing medals to his soldiers and issuing a last proclama-
tion, addressed to his former comrades, in which he said:—
“Providence has given Victor-EMMANUEL to Italy. Every Italian should
bind himself to him. All should gather close around him. By the side of
the ‘Re galantuomo" every strife should disappear, every rancour be dissi-
pated. Once again I repeat my cry to you—To arms, all ! all ! If the month
of March, 1861, does not find a million of Italians under arms, alas for liberty
alas for Italian existence Oh, no 1 away with a thought which I loathe as
poison. March, 1861, and February, if necessary, will find us all at our
post. Italians of Calatafimi, of Palermo, of the Volturno, of Ancona, of
Castelfidardo, and of Isernia, and with us every man of this land who is
neither servile nor a coward—all, one and all—gathered closely round the
hero of Palestro, we will give the last shock, the last blow to the crumbling
tyranny.”
The record of the after career of the noble, unselfish patriot
must be reserved for its place in future volumes.
The affairs of Italy were continually under discussion in
Parliament during the Session of 1860. M. PERSIGNY had
positively denied any intention on the part of the EMPERoR of
THE FRENCH to annex Savoy and Nice, but the demand was
made early in the year as a compensation to France for per-
mitting Central Italy to be united to Piedmont, and the
pretext made use of by France to justify such an arrangement
will be found expressed in the following extract from a des-
patch addressed to M. THouyen EL, the French Minister for
Foreign Affairs, to BARoN DE TALLEYRAND, the French Am-
bassador at Turin, on the 24th of February this year:–
“Historical traditions, which it is needless to recall, have accredited the
idea that the formation of a more powerful state at the foot of the Alps
would be unfavourable to our interests, and although, in the arrangement
developed in this despatch, the annexation of all the States of Central Italy
to Sardinia should not be complete, it is certain that in the point of view of
external relations it would be equivalent in reality to an analºgous result.
The same provisions, however distinct they may be, claim the same guaran-
tees; and the possession of Savoy and of the county of Nice, excepting the
interests of Switzerland, which we always desire to take into account, also
presents itself to us in that hypothesis as a geographical necessity for the
safety of our frontiers.”
This was evidently a demand of the strong upon the weak,
and Europe felt indignant at having been duped by the pro-
fessed disinterestedness of the French EMPEROR, who had
declared again and again that he had made war for “an
idea.” Mr. Punch never believed the assertion. French
emissaries were sent into Savoy and Nice, who contrived to
“make safe” an appeal to universal suffrage for the transfer
of the allegiance of the population to France. Count Cavour
wrote to M. Thouven EL thus:–
“We feel too deeply what Italy owes to the EMPEpoR not to pay the most
serious attention to a demand based on the principle of respect for the
wishes of the inhabitants. His Majesty's Government would never consent,
with even the greatest prospective advantages, to cede or exchange any one
of the parts of the territory which has formed for so many ages the glorious
inheritance of the House of Savoy. But the King's Government cannot
refuse taking into consideration the changes which passing events in Italy

INTRODUCTION.
page
may have introduced into the situation of the inhabitants of Savoy and Nice.
At the moment when we are loudly demanding for the inhabitants of Cen-
tral Italy the right of disposing of their destiny, we cannot, without incur-
ring the charge of inconsistency and injustice, refuse to the King's subjects
dwelling on the other side of the Alps the right of freely manifesting their
will. However poignant the regret we should feel if the provinces, once the
glorious cradle of the monarchy, could decide on demanding their separa-
tion from the rest of the King's dominions, in order to join other destinies,
we should not refuse to acknowledge the validity of this manifestation,
declared legally and conformably with the prescriptions of Parliament.”
The Swiss Government strongly opposed the annexation of
Savoy, but forgetful or unmindful of the interests of the
country which had sheltered him in exile, the EMPEROR OF
THE FRENCH persevered in his scheme of aggrandisement,
and the appeal to universal suffrage took place, the result in
Savoy being 130,533 votes given in favour of annexation to
France against 253, and in Nice 25,743 for annexation
against 160.
On the 25th of July the French EMPEROR, conscious of
the uneasiness felt in England on account of the policy and
conduct of France, addressed a remarkable letter to Count
PERSIGNY, the French Ambassador in this country, which is
of sufficient interest to be quoted in extenso. Whether the
explanations given were satisfactory or not, it is impossible
not to be struck with the air of frankness and sincerity which
pervades it; and such a familiar epistle from a crowned head,
in defence of his Government, has, at least, the merit of
novelty.
“St. Cloud, 25th July, 1860.
“My dear PERSIGNY,-Affairs appear to me to be so complicated—thanks
to the mistrust excited everywhere since the war in Italy—that I write to
you, in the hope that a conversation, in perfect frankness, with Lord
PALMERStoN, will remedy the existing evil. LoRD PALMERSTon knows me;
and when I affirm a thing he will believe me. Well, you can tell him from
me, in the most explicit manner, that since the peace of Willafranca, I have
had but one thought, one object—to inaugurate a new era of peace, and to
live on the best terms with all my neighbours, and especially with England
I had renounced Savoy and Nice; the extraordinary additions to Piedmont
alone caused me to resume the desire to see re-united to France provinces
essentially French. But it will be objected, ‘You wish for peace, and you
increase immoderately the military forces of France.' I deny the fact in
every sense. My army and my fleet have in them nothing of a threatening
character. My steam navy is even far from being adequate to our require-
ments, and the number of steamers does not nearly equal that of sailing
ships deemed necessary in the time of KING Louis Philippe. I have 400,000
men under arms; but deduct from this amount 60,000 in Algeria, 6,000 at
Rome, 8,000 in China, 20,000 gendarmes, the sick, and the new conscripts,
and you will see—what is the truth—that my regiments are of smaller
effective strength than during the preceding reign. The only addition to the
Army List has been made by the creation of the Imperial Guard. Moreover,
while wishing for peace, I desire also to organise the forces of the country
on the best possible footing; for, if foreigners have only seen the bright side
of the last war, I myself, close at hand, have witnessed the defects, and I
wish to remedy them. Having said thus much, I have, since Villafranca,
neither done, nor even thought, anything which could alarm any one. When
LAVALErre started for Constantinople, the instructions which I gave him
were confined to this—‘Use every effort to maintain the status quo, the
interest of France is that Turkey should live as long as possible."
“Now, then, occur the massacres in Syria; and it is asserted, that I am
very glad to find a new occasion of making a little war, or of playing a new
part. Really, people give me credit for very little common sense. If I
instantly proposed an expedition, it was because my feelings were those of
the people which has put me at its head, and the intelligence from Syria
transported me with indignation. My first thought, nevertheless, was to
corne to an understanding with England. What other interest than that of
humanity could induce me to send troops into that country? Could it be
that the possession of it would increase my strength? Can I conceal from
myself that Algeria, notwithstanding its future advantages, is a source of
weakness to France, which for thirty years has devoted to it the purest of
its blood and its gold * I said it in 1852 at Bordeaux, and my opinion is still
the same—I have great conquests to make, but only in France. Her interior
organisation, her moral development, the increase of her resources, have
still immense progress to make. There a field exists vast enough for my
ambition, and sufficient to satisfy it.
“It was difficult for me to come to an understanding with England on the
subject of Central Italy, because I was bound by the peace of Willafranca.
As to Southern Italy, I am free from engagements, and I ask no better than
a concert with England on this point, as on others; but, in Heaven's name,
let the eminent men who are placed at the head of the English Government
lay aside petty jealousies and unjust mistrusts.
“Let us understand one another in good faith, like honest men as we are,
and not like thieves who desire to cheat each other.
“To sum up, this is my innermost thought. I desire that Italy should
obtain peace, no matter how, but without foreign intervention, and that my
troops should be able to quit Rome without compromising the security of the
Pope. I could very much wish not to be obliged to undertake the Syrian
expedition, and, in any case, not to undertake it alone; firstly, because it
will be a great expense; and secondly, because I fear that this intervention
may involve the Eastern question; but, on the other hand, I do not see how
to resist public opinion in my country, which will never understand that we
can leave unpunished, not only the massacre of Christians, but the burning
of our consulates, the insult to our flag, and the pillage of the monasteries
which were under our protection.
“I have told you all I think, without disguising or omitting anything.
Make what use you may think advisable of my letter.
“Believe in my sincere friendship.
Before the close of the year the Chinese difficulties were
at an end, though not until great barbarities had been
inflicted on our countrymen, twenty-six British subjects
having been seized and thirteen only restored alive, all of
whom bore on their persons evidence of the indignities and
ill-treatment which they had suffered. Thirteen of our people
had been barbarously murdered, amongst whom were MESSRs.
DE NoHMAN and Bowl BY (the Times correspondent). CAP-
TAIN BRABAzoN, LIEUTENANT ANDERSON, and an English
dragoon were treated with such cruelty that they perished;
and MR. PARKEs, the Government interpreter, and MR. Loch
(LoRD ELGIN's secretary) were subjected to imprisonment,
torture, and indignity, but fortunately escaped with their
lives. LoRD ELGIN refused to negotiate until the prisoners
were restored; and, as the Chinese authorities hesitated to
comply with his demand, the Allied Army marched upon
Pekin, and the Summer Palace of the EMPEROR OF CHINA was
taken and demolished. A convention was signed immediately
afterwards, on the 24th of October; and a sum of 300,000 taels
was especially appropriated for those who had suffered, and for
the families of the murdered men.

The Volunteer Review.—On June 23, 1860, the great
Volunteer Review took place in Hyde Park before HER
MAJESTY. This impressive spectacle passed off without the
least disaster or confusion, although over 20,000 volunteers
were under arms, and the concourse of spectators was immense.
A brief statement of the programme will give the names of
the superior officers to whom so much of the completeness
and order of the review are due. The Volunteer army was
arranged in two divisions, each of four brigades, each brigade
comprising four battalions. The first division was under the
command of LIEUT.-GEN. SIR F. Love, K.C.B. The few
mounted rifle corps and the artillery were ranged in this
division. The Artillery Brigade was commanded by ColoneL
TULLocH; the First Brigade by HIs GRACE THE DUKE or
WELLINGTON : the Second Brigade by LIEUT.-Col. HIcks;
the Third Brigade by LoRD RANELAGH; the Fourth Brigade
by LoRD ELCHO. The Second Division was under the oom-
mand of MAJoh-GEN. LoRD RoKEBY, K.C.B.; the First
Brigade was commanded by Col. Thobold; the Second Bri-
gade by Col. THE MARQUIs of Don EGAL, G.C. H.; the Third
Brigade by BRIg.-GEN. Russell, C.B.; the Fourth Brigade

be filled up with the religious profession of the person
signing.
“See the Conquering Hero Comes.”—Refers to the
return from India of SIR Colin CAMPBELL, afterwards LoRD
CLYDE.
Effects of the Eclipse.—The Eclipse of the Sun occurred
at 1h. 38m. 34s. p.m., on the 18th of July, 1860, and con-
tinued until about half-past three; and throughout the whole
adumbration the disc of the sun could be gazed on without
pain to the naked eye. The highest register of the thermo-
meter during the forenoon was 114.0°Fahr.; and during the
eclipse it fell to 65.7°.

The Wake of the Irish Brigade.—These mercenaries 170
of the Pope made an ignominious retreat; but their valour
was eulogised by DR. CULLEN.
Passport Precedence.—Denmark, Sweden, and Norway 171
were the earliest to abolish the passport nuisance; and France
followed suit, December 16, 1860, but in favour of Englishmen
only. M. PERSIGNY's circular to the French Préfets is worthy
preservation in these pages:—
“Monsieur le Préfet,-The Emperor, as made known by a notice inserted
in the Moniteur of the 16th instant, has decided that, from the 1st of January
next, and by reciprocity, the subjects of the Queen of Great Britain and Ire-
land coming into France, will be admitted to circulate on the territory of the
empire without passports. I request you, in consequence, to give the neces-
sary instructions, that English subjects may be received in France on the
simple declaration of their nationality. Such among them as shall desire to
be provided with a voucher, which will allow them to claim the advantages
which are accorded to foreigners provided with passports, for visiting the
public buildings, will only have to present to the special agent at the frontier
a visiting card, on which that agent will affix the stamp of the Administra-
tion; or they may provide themselves with a special card, which will be
delivered to them, on application, by the Prefect of Police. I request you,
Monsieur le Préfet, to cause these instructions to be published in the form of
the annexed notice, which you will take care to have posted up in the ports
and the different points of entry on the territory. Accept, &c.
“F. DE PERSIGNY.”
New Elgin Marbles.—LoRD ELGIN enforced a com-
pletion of the Chinese Treaty.—See Introduction.
“Monkey uncommon up, Massa.”—The consequences
of this event is now a matter of history.
Sir C. C.’s Last.—MR. DENT, a well-known chronometer
maker, died, and bequeathed a considerable sum of money to
MR. DENIson, the designer of Big Ben at Westminster. The
will was made the subject of a law-suit subsequently.
“A Vicious Circle.”—Several privates in the Guards had
assaulted civilians by striking them with their heavy belts.
A Friendly Visit.—The health and spirits of the EMPREss
EUGENIE had suffered so much from sorrow for the death of
her sister, the DUCHESS OF ALBA, that some total relaxation
from Court state and complete change of scene were recom-
mended. Her Majesty, with the promptitude that distin-
guished her earlier days, decided on a visit, of the most
unceremonious character, to England and Scotland. Her
Majesty therefore crossed the Channel on the 21st, in the
ordinary packet-boat, attended by the MARQUEss of LA
GRANGE and two ladies in waiting, and took first-class tickets
for London. Arrived at London Bridge, the party engaged
the ordinary street-cabs, and drove to CLARIDGE's hotel,
where they were fortunate enough to find apartments disen-
gaged. So privately had the whole journey been managed,
that Her Majesty had been some time at the hotel before her
rank was known. The EMPRESS, on the following day, paid
a visit to the Crystal Palace, and then went by railway to
Edinburgh. After a rapid tour through Scotland on the 4th
of December, the EMPREss was received by Her Majesty at
Windsor Castle, and arrived in London on the same day.
The EMPRESS returned to Paris on the 13th, greatly improved
in health.
Favourite French Musical Instrument.—“Loot.” is
pillage; and the French exercised it in perfection when the
EMPEROR OF CHINA's Summer Palace was destroyed by the

NOVEMBER—no June (at least the Almanack says so) the 25th,
Monday. LoRD STRATHEDEN, the son of the LORD CHANCELLOR,
made his maiden display as a Peer, and with success, filially beating the
Government of which his Governor is a member. There is a place on
the east coast of Africa called Mozambique. There is a place on the
south-west of Europe called Portugal., The former is a station belong-
ing to the latter. The Slave-trade is largely favoured, despite profes:
sions to the contrary, by Portugal. LORD STRATHEDEN thinks that if
England keeps a Consul at Mozambique, he could keep an eye on the
slavemongers, and in some sort shame the Portuguese into pretendin
to be a little more earnest in repressing the traffic. The young Lor
wisely brought down two big guns to fire upon the Government, and
DR. WILBERFORCE and LoRD BRough AM both blazed away with great
effect, the latter taking the opportunity of laying into the Americans
for their treatment of the Negro. SomERSET snapped and GRANVILLE
bled, but STRATHEDEN was stubborn, and on division HER
JESTY's Government were defeated by 11 to 6, and an address for
a Consul was decreed. “Weel done, my bairnie,” murmured the
CHANCELLOR. “I’ll say ye're nae just sica Sumph as the unrighteous
hae ca'd ye.”
In the Commons there was a Scene. The Bankruptcy Bill, the
great measure of the year, was placed in imminent peril, and (Mr. Punch
must say) unwisely, by a sudden fit of imaginary justice with which
divers Members,were seized. The bankruptcy system has always been
a blunder, and the last legislation for amending it made it horribly
worse, so much so that the Mercantile World contemns and neglects
the Court. SIR RICHARD BETHELL, laudably desirous to cleanse the
Augean stable, proposes to turn a stream of some six hundred clauses
of new law into it, and among the arrangements of our legal HERCULEs,
there is a provision for relieving the fund contributed by the
estates of unfortunate bankrupts from certain compensations, rendered
necessary by the absurdities of former legislation. It certainly seems
hard that the country should throw on the suitors the costs of mistakes
made by the country's own representatives. And considering that the
sum itself is but about £20,000, and is yearly diminished, it was not
much to make a fuss about. But SIR HENRY WILLoughby and some
others made fight, and with some claptraps about the hardship of
taxing the people for a Court they do not use (what do the Conser-
vatives say when the same argument is employed about the Church of
England in Ireland?) they managed on division to reject this part of
WoL. XXXIX.-1860.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
the plan by lll to 98. MR. MALINs, a leading Conservative, told his
friends they had been yoting in perfect ignorance of the subject; a
olite remark seconded by MR. BRIGHT with the intimation that they
§ so upon many other occasions. SIR HERCULES BETHELL then
declared that he would not go on with a scheme that had been thus
mutilated. This made a great sensation, and finally he was prevailed
upon to say that he would give the House another chance. The
debate was to have been resumed at the end of the week, but the
beestly weather has produced the same effect upon the ATToRNEY-
GENERAL as upon most other people, and he is ill. The SoLICITOR-
GENERAL, however, stated on Friday, that the measure is to be
proceeded with.
A Game Certificate measure was agreed to, on the distinct under-
standing that it was to afford no new protection to Rabbits, against
which class of our fellow-creatures several Members spoke very
bitterly. The Church Property Bill had been much opposed, but on
LoRD John RussELL (whose family is an authority on the question of
Church Property) explaining that it was not at º confiscatory, it was
read a Second time.
Tuesday. The new and able Archbishop of York, DR. I.ONGLEY,
came out in the House of Peers, in his elevated capacity, but on a
subject, connected with his old diocese, and the application of eccle-
siastical tin to local purposes. Many Lords talked, and the Archbishop
carried the Second Reading of his Bill, which is a just one. . ...
Ireland had the Pull, in the Commons to-day, the morning sitting
being chiefly occupied with an Irish Landlord and Tenant Bill, and the
evening opening with a much more interesting affair—namely, a per-
sonal debate. . Conolly, Conservative, delivered a great Philippic
against LoRD CARLISLE, Lord Lieutenant, declaring that he was a very
bad Viceroy, and made very objectionable appointments. One great
crime of LoRD CARLISLE's, in the estimation of his enemies, is his
having made a MR. LYLE Lord Lieutenant of Londonderry. MR.
LYLE is a Master in Chancery, and in every way a suitable man for the
appointment; but he was so obnoxious to the vulgar Irish Squires,
that, when he presented himself as the representative of the QUEEN,
none of the Grand Jury rose to receive him. The idea of paying any
attention to the opinion of men, who knew no better than to insult
their Sover EIGN, through her officer, is too preposterous to occur to
anybody but an Irish partisan. There was a good deal of scoffing at
LoRD CARLISLE by other speakers, and Colonel FRENCH abused him
No. 991.

2 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 7, 1860.
for “inaugurating a Turkish bath, entertaining at 'dinner a troop of
theatrical performers, and a horse-tamer at breakfast, and attending the
opening a shop in Grafton Street, where he drank a glass of cham;
pagne and made a speech to the assembled shopkeepers and astonished
cabmen.” MR. GREGORY made a spirited and convincing defence of
the LYLE appointment, and LORD PALMeRSTON and MR. HoRsMAN
spoke up warmly for their friend LoRD CARLISLE. Of the legions of
incidental matters dragged into such a debate Mr. Punch would despair
to treat, unless he j a double supplement and an appendix;
hut on the whole Lord CARLISLE came off very well. A case of loca
distress in Ireland next came on, but MR. Pope HENNEssy could not
show that there was any reason for Imperial interference.
The Monster, MR. SIDNEY HERBERT, then introduced a valuable
Bill for Improving the Militia Laws. The Militia are not to be
seduced into the regular Army, and the object is to make them a
separate and reserve force, to be embodied only in case of emergency.
The Monster made an admirable speech, and his proposals were
received with merited applause.
... Wednesday. The Bill for relieving the poor creatures engaged in
Bleaching and Dyeing Works was considered in Committee, and very
much hindered by those who, as MR. Edwin JAMEs told them, thought
that children were sent into the world for nothing else but to be used
up in manufactures. But very large majorities were ranged on the
side of humanity.
Thursday. . A singular act of homage was paid to the House of
Lords. Their Lordships were sitting in the morning in Appeal, when
some poor Indian, whose untutored mind was utterly overpowered b
the spectacle of so much wisdom and gravity, set up a yell, and, puſ-
ling out a knife, proceeded to offer himself up as a sacrifice to the
Idols of the Nation. However, the operation was prevented, and the
.# being removed to a neighbouring hospital, was found to have
done himself no particular harm by his preliminary to a Happy Dis-
patch. In the evening their lº talked about Breakwaters, and
decided that nobody knew anything at all upon the subject.
The Commons were occupied all the evening with a debate upon the
important Indian Army Fusion Bill. Among the statements that were
made was an astounding one to the effect that the Officers of the Line
and of the Local Service being called as witnesses on the question of
fusion, the former all testified one way, and the latter the other. Here-
upon Mr. Punch would like to tell a little true story. There was a
collision case to be heard before the Court which sits in London to
settle when ships are justified in running down one another. A certain
sailor's evidence was wanted. He was at Dover, so it was resolved to
send down an affidavit, which JAck could make there. The London
official who had to prepare the affidavit was not sure as to which side
JACK's evidence was to favour, and therefore to save time and trouble
he prepared and sent Two forms of affidavit, directing that the sailor
should be sworn to the one which he believed consistent with truth.
Of course they were in direct contradiction, one saying that the wind
was S.S.W. and the smashed vessel, going in one direction, and the
other that it was N.N.E., and that she was steering in the other. The
affidavits were duly returned by the Dover agent, who wrote, “You
did not make it clear which you wanted, so I have sworn him to both,
and you can use which you like.” It is a very sad thing that
sailors should be so heedless, but of course the story has no other
application. The debate was adjourned, after a vain struggle by Lord
PALMERSTON to prevent that course, so PAM said it would be a shame
to keep the SPEAKER up while they squabbled.
Friday. In the Lords there was another exposure of the conduct of
the Admiralty. . Somebody said in society the other day, “Don’t be
uncharitable. Everybody has got something good about him, except
my, brother Bob.” The country will soon learn to say, that every
Body has something good about it except the Board of Admiralty.
Its behaviour in re TROTMAN's Anchor was the charge to-night, and
IORD HARDwicke put himself in a very proper rage with the
Government.
In the Commons, MR. WALPole brought up the Report of the
Select Committee, appointed as Buffer to prevent collision between
the Lords and Commons on the Paper Duty question. It was ordered
to be printed for consideration. Of course Parliament has to wait for
jts jº, but the newspapers have the thing at once, and Mr.
Punch is able to state that the Report mentions a variety of cases that
have no bearing on the present difficulty, and a few that have some
affinity with it. It recommends nothing, and there will be a good
debate on the subject, especially as Lord John RussELL and MR.
GLADSTONE join MR. BRIGHT in his view that the Bull-dog ought to be
set upon the Mastiff.
SIR. G., C. Lewis made a lame apology for the conduct of the police
in not chastising the ruffians who hunt the choristers and other
tools of the Puseyite fools at St. George's-in-the-East. There was
another Irish debate about an alleged act of LoRD LEITRIM, who is
said to have seized a Roman Catholic chapel on his estate in that
county, and thereby provoked a riot. A good deal of iſ. liberal
and proper sentiment was expressed about the duty of landlords, of
any creed, to afford tenants, of any creed, the means of performing
worship in their own way. But Ireland is a curious place. A Catholic
and a Protestant gentleman, over their Lafitte at the Club, will, of
course, express themselves most tolerantly and affably as to the above
duty; and if a Mohammedan gentleman happened to draw up his chair
to theirs, while he took his iced sherbet, the three gentlemen would be
all : upon the propriety of perfect liberality. The Mohammedan
gentleman might probably carry out his view, he not being so far
advanced in civilisation as to let his priests and his women dictate to
him. But, when the other two got back to Ireland, and proceeded to
act up to their Fº and the Catholic talked of giving a site for
a Protestant church, and the Protestant mentioned that he should
build a Catholic chapel, what a Burst there would be from Priests,
Women, and Families! Those only who do not know what are the
sentiments and powers of dogged Popish pastors and perspiring Evan-
gelical pastors in Ireland, will be disposed to abuse the poor tolerant
gentlemen for not fulfilling the vows made over the libation of
#. So saith Mr. Punch, Tolerator yet Legislator-General to the
niverse.
THE BOYS OF THE IRISH BRIGADE.
“There have been considerable disturbances among the Irish papal recruits at
Macerata, in which shillelaghs were freely used, and the polico, who interf, ed,

THE BOURBONS' BLUSH.
THE boys of Palermo are naturally amusing themselves by disfiguring
and demolishing the statues of the Bourbon Kings. According to the
Special Correspondent of the Times:–
“One, bolder than the others, climbed up with a provision of charcoal and
blackened the faces, exciting no small hilarity among the idlers and promenaders."
This was a satirical young wag. In giving the marble visages of the
Bourbons the semblance of ebony, he evidently meant to signify the
§§ by which those tyrants have rendered themselves infamous in
reaking faith with their subjects, and to express their characteristic
readiness, in taking an oath, for instance, to maintain a constitution,
to swear till they are black in the face.
“These Irishmen.”—John Buu.
MR. IRwin, who brought the successful action against the Member
for Galway to obtain compensation for having professed to introduce
the latter to Swells, announces his own belief that his education in
mechanics must have been sadly neglected. He thought he was going
to use a Lever, but found he had got hold of a Screw. The remark is
an impolite, one, and though. Mr. Punch professes no violent admira-
tion for an M.P., who (according to DoD), “will support any Ministry
that will make Galway a Packet. Station,” Mr. P. will not be sorry
should MR. IRWIN's theory of motive power be modified after a motion
for a new trial. We don't like the Touting System, especially when
applied to public objects—as the Wiscount says “Tout le contraire.”

THAT Clause in the Census Bill which provides
for a return of religious professions has called
forth a good deal of opposition; The system of
asking impertinent questions has been already
carried by Government to an insufferable extent,
and must be checked. “How much have you
ot a year?” seems the height of impertinence,
ut, “What’s your religion?” is a higher flight
still. It exceeds the audacity of any clown in
the most outrageous pantomime. We are crying
out upon Puseyism and Popery, whilst a Con-
fessional and an Inquisition are growing up in
our midst. WALKER will probably be the de-
nomination under which persons who like to
keep their doctrinal opinions in their own
breasts will for the most part be disposed to
return themselves. They may, however, do
better than that. Let everybody who desires to
resist the attempt which, ignorant, fanatics are
making to destroy the Christian liberty of the

Jewish Sabbath, return himself as an Excur-

My lit-tle dears, there was once a French Wolf—very grey, and
gree-dy, and lean, and sly. Near the wood in which he lived grazed a
large flock of sheep, in the charge of a great many small dogs, who were
al-ways snarling and bit-ing, and quar-rel-ling a-mong them-selves.
The old Wolf knew that he was more than a match for any of the
dogs sin-gly, but he was a fraid if he ven-tur-ed to attack one of them,
the o-thers ºff. for-get their snarl-ing to join in a league of de-fence
a-gainst him. There was one large dog in par-ti-cu-lar, cal-led “Prince,”
who had long warned the rest of the pack of the com-mon danger to
all from the old Wolf, and had done his best to make them agree
bet-ter; “for so sure,” said he, “as the Wolf succeeds in keep-ing us
at log-ger-heads, he will take us,one by one, with-out dif-fi-cuſty, and
when he has eatien us up, he will have his own way with the sheep.”
But they would not mind his words, and some of them growl-ed at
him, and said he was a trai-tor, end on-ly wan-ted to get the sheep to
him-self, and that the Wolf was an honest beast, and loved the small
ogs, and would do the sheep no harm.
The Wolf, knowing that if he could only succeed in gain-ing over
the big dog Prince he might eas-i-ly mas-ter the small curs one by one,
was always yery po-lite to Prince, and used to send him civil messages,
in-vi-ting him to take coun-cil with him, for the ben-e-fit of the other
dogs, and the sheep. For a long time the big dog on-ly grow-led and
fººd the other way when-e-ver he saw the Wolf making to-wards
lm.
But at last, find-ing the Wolf would take no de-nial of his in-vi-ta-
tions, he sent him a let-ter, º; to meet him.
The Wolf was de-light-ed, and said to his cubs, “Now I have the
big dog at last.” And off he trotted to the place of meet-ing. It
was in a thick wood on a hill, with an old castle built at the top.
The big dog was at the gate of the cas-tle, and when the Wolf came
up, with a grin that show-ed his long, sharp teeth, he said—“Walk in,
my dear Wolf; I am so glad to see you.” Then the Wolf put his paw
on his heart, and said, “Dear Prince, I have been wait-ing so long for
this hap-py meet-ing. I do feel so fond of all you dogs, and of those
dear sheep you watch so well, you can’t think.. I have a plan, by which
the small dogs will be able to do their work, so plea-sant-ly and so
ea-si-ly. What a shame it is, that the poor little beasts should be so
hard work-ed, and kept out in all wea-thers, guard-ing their sheep from
the wick-ed wolves that sur-round them. Now you are a great dog,
and ve-ry strong. Sup-pose you took the work of the small dogs off
paunches; and mean-while we would guard the sheep to ge-ther.”
Then the big dog laugh-ed and said, “A nice plan, in-deed! How
ye-ry kind you are Here are all the small dogs just in-side the gate.
Per-haps you will be kind e-nough to tell them the nice lit-tle * Oul
have just told me, and see, how they will like it.” Then the Wolf
be-gan to feel very awk-ward and un-com-fort-a-ble, and felt that the
big dog had led him in-to a trap; and he curl-ed up his mouth in-to
what he meant for a ve-ry sweet smile, and said, “No, thank you, dear
Prince. I think I will not say any-thing to them to-day. I have not
got my speech quite rea-dy.” Then all the small dogs, who had heard
all from in-side the old cas-tle, be-gan to yelp and to laugh, and to
wag their tails, and to set up a cry of, “How ve-ry kind you are, dear
Wolf, to think of ta-king the charge of our sheep of our hands !” . .
So the Wolf, see-ing his plot was de-tect-ed, sneak-ed off with his tail
be-tween his legs, and from that time the small º: knew that Prince
was their true friend, and were #. of him no long-er, and made up
their own quarrels, and the Wolf was fain to keep his de-signs a-gainst
the sheep in the dark, till he could find a bet-ter time for put-ting
them in ex-e-cu-tion. -
HOW TO MAKE A SPLENDID INCOME.
Thanks to MR. Justice WILLEs, this process is now easy to anybody
who can raise the preliminary Five Pounds. The journals say—
“It has been laid down by MR. JUSTICE WILLEs, that a banker is bound to pay
on the production of the half of a cut note, even without an indemnity."
Therefore all one has to do is to get a £5 note, and cut it in halves.
Present one half, and under the authority of MR. JUSTICE WILLEs,
demand the money. Do the same with the other half. Turn each £5
into a note, and cut each note, and repeat the presenting process. So
go on until the banks close. An industrious young man with £5 and
a pair of scissors may now render himself independent in the course of
a week. Thanks, MR. JUSTICE WILLEs.
A SERVANT on SPIRITUALISM.–It is fortunate that rapping spirits,
which seem very tricksy beings, do not seem to be able to move street-
knockers. Otherwise we should continually be going to answer a rap
at the door, and ooming back, saying, “Please 'm only a ghost.”

A Tiger'is waiting to spring,
And so we come up to our QUEEN, as of yore
Our fathers came up to their KING.
The beast that is lurking is fiercer, they say,
Than the j our fathers brought grimly to bay,
And rolled in his blood at their feet,
And therefore we come to our Lady to-day,
The vow of our sires to repeat. ,
We come, but it is not in plaint or in fear—
Which, which did the QUEEN, proudly marking us, hear
In the voice of that thunder-toned shout?
We come but to show her what Hunters are near
For the hour when her bugles ring out.
We come with firm footstep, as Hunters should tread,
With the glaive by the side, with the plume on the head,
With the heart where a Hunter's should be ;
And each with the Y. of weapons most dread,
Most dread in the hands of the Free.
Nor idly we come in a holiday pride,
With arms unaccustomed, with sinews untried,
To deal with a savage so fell;
We know from our sires, when a savage hath died,
His Hunters have quit them right well.
And we come that the Lady of Kingdoms may know,
In the day, should it chance, that her bugles shall blow
She shall find Hunter-Soldiers astir;
And the men whom her signal shall launch on the foe
Shall be worthy of dying for Her.
From the Loom, from the Mine, from the Forge, from the Mart,
From the cells of stern Science, the halls of fair Art,
From the homes of calm Learning, we come;
Who grudges his brother a brotherly part
In our work—let him hence, and be dumb'
Some say the War-Tiger is scared from the fight;
And some that his courage hath quailed to a blight
From the scent of our fresh-flowing sea;
And some that he is but a monster to fright
The folks near his home. It may be:
But our fields they lie open, our gardens are rare,
And those we love better than life wander there,
And our babies are crawling about ;
And none of us all is so brave as to dare
To leave certain questions in doubt.
So we come in our thousands, from cot and from ha.,
And from thousands again who are ready at call,
Should once the War-Tiger be seen,
And this is the errand on which, one and all,
We come up, to-day, to the QUEEN.
Did they daunt the brave Hunters in years have gone by,
That foam on his fangs and that fire in his eye,
As he rushed in his rage on the spear?
No, thus, ever thus, the War-Tiger should die:
Come, Tiger, the Hunters are here.
The blood-thirsty growl and the roar are in vain;
If the savage attack us, the savage again
Shall writhe in a merited doom;
There’s the steel for his flank, and the ball for his brain,
Come, Tiger, and spring on thy tomb.

A SCHOOLMASTER SLIGHTLY ABROAD.
onsiderATE as Mr. Punch is at
all times, he would not think of
troubling a Schoolmaster with
any work in addition to that of
his school, until the holidays had
2 set in. But now that our Young
Friends are at home, Mr. P.
ventures to ask MR. H. E.
JANson, of Brighton, what is
the exact meaning of the follow.
ing note, which he inserted in
the Times *—
“To the Editor of the “Times.”
“Sir, –I beg very distinctly to
contradict a statement in MR.
CLERY's letter to the Times, that I
have ever threatened to cane young
WANsitta RT, or that I have ever held
a stick over him. My practice is
very different to this, as I may confi-
dently appeal to all my pupils.
“I remain, Sir.
Your Obedient Servant,
** H. E. JANson.”
“106, Lansdowne Place, Brighton.”
“My practice is very different to this,” says MR. JANsoN, in ques:
tionable English. Then what is MR. JANson's practice? Mr. Punch
hopes, and believes, that MR. JANson (whose haste to deny brutality
does him credit) means that he does not wop his boys. But from his
letter it might inferred that he does not “threaten,” or “hold a
stick over” a culprit, but lets into him at once, like one o'clock. Or
is it the stick which is repudiated, and is the “different practice” the
use of a trifle from the tree Betula, vel betulla, not nearly so pleasant a
refresher as one at BIRch's, in Cornhill. Not pausing for a reply,
Mr. Punch proceeds to the last part of the letter. “As I may confi-
dently Appeal to all my º: If . pupil of MR. JANsoN's brought
him such a sentence as this, it is possible that the youth might make a
vain Appeal against orders to “stay in” all the afternoon, and consider
LINDLEY MURRAY on Prosody. iº. all the boys having gone
home, MR. JANson should beguile his leisure by improving his compo-
sition. Mr. Punch's zeal in favour of education will be regarded by
#: JANson as ample excuse for troubling that gentleman with the
int.
MR. PUNCH AND THE FRENCH ORPHEONISTS.
Last week Mr. Punch, as representative of England, fraternised
with the French Orphans, as by some English literati the Orpheonists
were called. As the Romans to MARKANTONY, he first “ſent them
his ears,” and them gave them his hands, clapped in thundering
applause. Their performance far exceeded all that had been promised
º them, and in the thunder of Punch Tonans their triumph was
complete.
On the merits of their singing. Mr. Punch need not dilate, for he
could scarcely print a word of praise without committing plagiary, so
amply has the subject been recently discussed. Enough to say that
these French singers sang with such distinctness that, to English ears,
their French was perfectly intelligible; and as near three thousand
tongues were wagged for each one word, it may be fancied with what
practice and precision they were drilled. Not being used of late to
hear the French sing small, Mr. Punch was struck especially with the
piano passages; and, without meaning a pun, he came to the con-
clusion that, in the singing of the Orpheonists, their piano is their
forte. Mr. Punch has T. been used to consider the Cologne Choir
unapproachable in this; but had he now to give the prize, he rather
thinks that he would have to halve his golden pippin, and award one
aureous moiety to his new friends from France. The faultless manner,
too, in which they kept ºp the true pitch was, as a musical w
remarked, the true pitch of perfection. And not less to be praise
was the finish of their Swells, which were as exquisite as those of
“Wegent Stweet” or “Wotten Wow.” In short, as
“Orpheus with his lute made trees,
And the mountain tops that freeze,
Bow themselves when he did sing,”
so did the French Orpheonists with the sweet music they discoursed
make Mr. Punch, and some few tens of thousands of his cºuntrymen,
nod their heads in pleasant approbation of their efforts. (Parentheti.
cally, too, Mr. Panch must give one word of commendation to the
Guides; for he felt that, with such guides to accompany a chorus, the
march to vocal victory was easy of accomplishment.
By way of a finale to each of the four concerts, there was such cheer-
ing and such handclapping, and such waving of hats, handkerchiefs,
º: and programmes, that experienced Mr. Punch had both to rub
is eyes and twitch his ears before he could believe that he was not
deceived by them. A scene of such excitement is so rarely seen in
England (before dinner at least) that Mr. Punch could scarcely bring
his senses to put credence in it. With a sort of friendly rivalry the
audience cheered the singers and the singers cheered the audience;
and the oldest and the coldest morning concert-goers present gave vent
to their enthusiasm without feeling they lost caste by it. Indeed they
so warmed up that the fire of wit was kindled, and some brilliant
things popped out of it. For instance when French gallantry sent
forth a shout of . Wive la Reine.” a British wit, at once flashed forth
the sparking sally, “Ah, we've la Rain, indeed! You may well, say
that, my boys, seeing that we've scarcely had a dry half hour these
six months!”
And these—Mr. Punch could not help seriously reflecting, while his
heart, big with fraternity, bumped against his waistcoat--these are
the Allies who by this time had been enemies, if statescraftsmen and
soldiers had been allowed to have their way. These are the two nations,
the one deriving some of its old blood from the other, who are said to
be in nature like as dog and cat, and to have only the feeling of win-
dictiveness in common. , Surely nations would keep friends if they
were left more to themselves, and surely statescraftsmen, and soldiers
who would hound on the French poodle to attack the British bulldog,
should be hissed off the stage as the bad genii of the peace.
But if there be one thing more likely than another to foster kindly
feeling between Englishmen and French, it is by letting them compete
in ºnly rivalry of art, instead of stirring them to deadly rivalry in
arms., ...Were Festivals of Music internationally, appointed, nations
would live more in harmony together, and “Discord, #. sister,” would
be swept from off the earth.
Wherefore Mr. Punch, in the name of all the peacemakers, tenders
thanks to all concerned in the Orpheonist invasion, which he regards
as the in-bringing of a new era of peace. It will be no fault of Old
England if “La Nouvelle Alliance” does not take root in her soil, and
“France / France/* if left alone will surely strive to foster it. By
instituting this first of Anglo-French peace festivals. the Sacred
Harmonic Society has shown itself a Peace Society; and indefatigable
MR. Bowley, the prime mover in the matter, should have a statue
large as life for bringing it to pass. How much Income-Tax might be
saved, were musical invasions to supersede the chance of martial ones,
Mr. Punch will leave to MR. GLADstoNE to determine; and he will
likewise leave that gentleman to introduce into his Beer Bill a clause
allowing our pale ale, for the use of all French singers, to be sold
them free of duty * either hops or malt. With which last thought
for their welfare, Mr. Punch again shakes hands with his French
friends Les ORPHéonisTEs, and, as usual, speaking as the mouthpiece
of All England, he bids them not adies—but, in no long time, au revoir.
NEWLY-DISCOWERED WORK BY MR. MACAULAY.
“The following curious advertisement lately appeared in the Bristol Mirror:—
“If the gentleman who borrowed the fourth volume of MAcAulay's History of
England for a Fortnight, some two years since, is deteruined not to return it, he had
better apply to J. R. T., Mirror Office, for the three remaining volumes, which will
render his set complete.'"
On the contrary, he had better, send the volume he possesses to
Messrs. LongMAN, who are probably unaware of the existence of the
work in question, and might like to include it in the new edition of
MR. MacAulay's productions. Mr. Punch also would like to see it,
being curious to know what Fortnight in the History LoRD MACAULAY
selected as the theme for his brilliant illustration. Perhaps it was the
immortal fortnight in 1841 that beheld the birth of Punch. Anyhow,
the Bristol gentleman should let the world know something of this
History of England for a Fortnight.
Compensation for All or Nome.
THE House of Commons has discountenanced the |. of the
ATToRNEY-GENERAL to afford compensation to the officials who will
be superseded by the enactment of his Bankruptcy Bill. Why, indeed,
should those gentlemen be compensated for their prospective loss any
more than the Publicans whose gains may be diminished º: Wine
Licences Act? Honourable Gentlemen, perhaps, are disposed to
refuse, compensation to anybody whatever, on the twofold principle
that what is sauce for goose is sauce for gander, and that, as enlightene
financiers hold, the cessation of liability under Schedule Dis a sufficient
set off against the ruin entailed by loss of income.
BRITAIN's BEST BULwARks.—If there are any works which are
powerfully defensive to the nation, and tremendously offensive to all
its enemies, they are those which, now amounting to thirty-eight
volumes, are published by Mr. Punch, at 85, Fleet Street.

HEART AND HEAD IN THE CORPORATION
OF LONDON.
At the Common Hall of the Livery of the City of
London, MR. ALDERMAN ARBIss and MR; LUSH having
been, with the usual formalities and row, elected Sheriffs,
the latter gentleman made the following neat and appro-
priate speech on the occasion:—
“MR. Lush admitted that he had no claim to the office upon the
score of any great ability. It was not, he said, possible for all men
to be Peels or GREys, GLADstones or GRAHAMs; but it was possible
for all to be honest men, and he P. to act honestly in the
discharge of his public duties, and to use his utmost exertions to
sustain the honour and dignity of the office."
It has been said that when an office is conferred upon a
man, he is usually also inspired with the abilities necessary
to discharge it. Worthy MR. Lush need not fear that his
talents will be inadequate to the requirements of the office
of Sheriff of London and Middlesex. These have been
usually considered to be amply insured by the proof of
intelligence competent to the numeration of hobnails, and
mechanical faculty sufficient to chop sticks. The duties
which the Sheriff is called upon to perform are not such as
to render a competitive, examination a very necessary con-
dition to eligibility to the Shrievalty. If anything of the
kind were requisite, it would perhaps be a trial, on the
part of candidates, of their comparative proficiency in the
use of the knife and fork. The successful competitor might
be the one who showed himself the best man “to carve a
capon and eat it.” If it were possible for MR. Lush to
be a PEEL, a GLADstone, or a GRAHAM, it might not be
desirable, at least for the Corporation of London. Some
of those statesmen might be too strongly disposed to
trouble their fellow-citizens with projects for municipal
reform. We wish MR. Lush every success in the attempt
to display, as an honest man, his moral splendour, which, in
a civic dignitary, will amply compensate for almost any
deficiency of intellectual brightness.

A CI-DEVANT JEUNE HomME.
A PLEA FOR RAGGED PLAY-GROUNDS,
The maxim that “nullum tempus occurrit, Regi Punchio.” is quite
enough of an excuse, if any at all be needed, for KING PUNCH now
to signify his Royal approbation of a speech made by LoRD SHAFTES;
BURY some short time ago, at a meeting of the patrons of the Field
Lane Ragged Schools. After speaking of the progress and success of
that establishment, his Lordship turned from ragged schools to talk
of º play-grounds, a º which has more than once engaged
the Royal pen and pencil of KING, PUNCH; and while discoursing on
this theme, his Lordship, laudibly let fall the following observations,
which KING Punch will for posterity preserve in the embalming
amber of his type:–
“It was stated in the House of Commons the other night, that in our metropo-
litan prisons there were forty-two children, under thirteen years of age, who were
confined there for playing at marbles, or at driving hoops, or at a game called ‘tip-
cat." No doubt it was quite necessary that these games should be prohibited in the
streets, where they were dangerous, and horses might be frightened, or the pas-
sengers' eyes might be injured by them. But when we had an opportunity of
opening as play-grounds large places in London, where poor children might enjoy
their sports without any danger, was that advantage to be taken from them, and
were we to go on imprisoning the children because they indulged in a natural and
proper propensity where they could. (Cheers).”
Tip-cat, hoops, and marbles, are nuisances, no doubt, to adults who
never play at them, and KING PUNCH has more than once severely
suffered from these pastimes. Indeed, he rarely shows himself at an
of the Courts (he means those of St. Giles's rather than St. jº
without having his Royal eye half knocked out by a tip-cat, or being
tripped up by a hoop trundled between his Royal legs. But whatever
may be done by crusty old curmudgeons, KING PUNCH would never
dream of prosecuting his small torturers. Though what is sport to
them not seldom proves almost the death of him. His Royal breast is
moved by no vindictive feeling; on the contrary, KING PUNCH main-
tains that children must have play, however he may suffer by it:
Playing is a natural necessity of life to them, and play they must and
will, pass what laws we may to punish and prohibit them. If we
deny them proper play-grounds they will play upon the pavements,
and no one but a BoMBA would imprison them for playing there.
But are there no spare places where poor children might play,
without annoyance to the public? Why should not ºn "Šiº
be made a ragged play-ground, instead of being turned into a noxious
dead-meat market LoRD SHAFTESBURY for one will not see its site
so desecrated, and KING, PUNCH for another will take care, to defend
it. This is how the children's champion throws his gauntlet bravely
down, and boldly sounds his challenge against all civic comers:–
“He did not know whether in that room there was present any worthy citizen
or member of the Corporation of London; but if so, he (Lord SHAFTEsBURY) now
gave him due notice that he would contest this point tooth and nail, and step by
step, so long as he had any breath in him ; he would resist any attempt to give up
one square inch of the site of Smithfield Market for any other purpose than for the
health and happiness, the security and recreation of the population of London."
Bravo! good LoRD SHAFTESBURY | You speak up like a man on
behalf of London children, and on behalf of them KING PUNCH now
thanks you for your speech. In carrying out your promise to defend
the site of Smithfield, your Lordship may rely on the assistance of
KING, PUNCH. By KING Punch's pen the pens of Smithfield were
demolished, and with the same steel weapon KING PUNch will now
defend its site against the butchers’ steel. Having cleared away the
beasts that used to make day hideous with their bellowings and bleat-
ings, KING PUNCH has little wish to see their place of meeting haunted
by their ghosts; and this he fears might be the case were a market to
be opened there, for the barter of the carcases of their defunct des-
cendants. Far rather would KING PUNCH see the site of Smithfield
market stocked with living children than with cartloads of dead meat;
and he therefore boldly echoes the defiance of LoRD SHAFTEsBURY,
and proclaims War to the Knife! against those greedy citizens who
would make Smithfield a catering-place for the civic knife and fork.

PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXI. — MORE ABOUT THE LADIES OF
TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES.
ALTHough the ladies of this period were doubtless censured by
their husbands for extravagance in dress, we really think them far
more moderate than some of their descendants. We could, for in-
stance, cite a register to show that sixty shillings only was the cost
of a new robe; and we could also quote a warrant which was issued
by KING John, ordering the purchase of two robes for the Queen,
whereof each, was to consist of five ells only of cloth. When one
reflects that in these days of unconscionable crinoline as much as
twenty yards is far too little for a dress, one can't help wishing one
could take a leaf out of KING John's book, and limit one's JEMIMA
to the six yards and a quarter with which a Queen in the twelfth
century was, doubtless, well content.
The robe, as we have said, was an undergown with sleeves, and it
appears that, during John’s reign green was generally considered the
most fashionable colour, for it. Hence we may remark, that pretty
girls who wore it might have been asked why they resembled the fields
in the Creation ; the answer, of course, being, that they were “With
Werdure Clad,” and, no doubt, “de.
lightful to the ravished sense” of
their admirers. Express mention of
this colour is made in both the war-
rant and the register referred to, and
we likewise find allusion to it in the
accounts given of the flight of WIL-
LIAM LongchamP, Bishop of Ely, who
was Regent during RICHARD's ab-
sence in the East. We learn from
MATTHEw PARIs that the Bishop ran
away” “disguised in a green woman's
tunic;” but who was the “green wo-
man,” whose robe he ran away in, the
writer of this passage does not pro-
ceed to say.
Over their robes on swell occasions
the ladies wore a mantle, which was
splendidly embroidered, that of QUEEN
ELEANOR being sprinkled with a lot
of golden crescents. Under this, or
on ordinary days perhaps in lieu of it,
they wore a closely-fitting garment
which being richly furred, was called pelisson, or pelisse; a name said
to be derived from pelletier, a furrier. KING JoHN orders a grey one,
with nine bars of fur, to be made up for his Queen: t and we learn,
from an old jest book, that when she tried it on the King made some
mild joke about her being in the pelisse. -
A garment called a bliaus (whence, doubtless, the modern blouse), is
also mentioned at this period as being worn over the robe; but it
appears that the word bliaus was only another name for the surcoat
or supertunic. For winter use, we learn, the bliaus was lined with fur;

but we cannot say if it was waterproofed for summer, as, were it now || –
in wearing, it certainly would need to be.
. The wimple, of which mention is first made during KING John's
time, was an under-veil or kerchief wrapped round the head and chin,
and at times completely enveloping the neck. For the nuns and
poorer classes it was made of linen, and fastened on the forehead with
a plain fillet to match: but the swellesses all wore it of gold tissue or
rich silk, and had their fillets, jewelled with gems which, Cox remarks,
some jew’eld not unfrequently in pawn for them.
The peplum, or veil, was worn over the wimple; and above them
both was often placed a diadem or garland, or else a small round hat
or cap. Isabel, the sister of KING HENRY THE THIRD, is described
by MATTHEw PARIs as taking off her hat and veil, so as to let the
people see her face, which, if she was pretty, was a vastly proper
action in her. e find too, from the famous Roman de la Rose (a
poem we shall have more fully to refer to), that at times a floral
chaplet was worn besides the diadem or coronal of gold, as bears
witness the couplet:—
“Ung chappel de roses tout frais
Eut dessus le chappel d'Orfrays.”
* We surely need not caution our enlightened readers against believing the
surmise of Cox, the Finsbury Historian, that it was from his creditors the Bishop
ran away; nor need we refute the further supposition, that it was at Runnymede
that LoNGCHAMP set off running, in company, as Cox conjectures, with John LAck-
LAND, whose Estates had just
up the Rye House Plot.
f “It appears from this, and from the warrant above quoted, that husbands in
these days used to order their wives' dresses. Were this custom of the “good old
times' to be revived, what mints of money might be saved, and what preposterous
absurdities of crinoline be spared us !”—Punch. “And what frights you stingy
creatures would be sure to make of us!"—Judy.
n confiscated for his helping Titus Oates to get
This fact is also mentioned in another ancient poem, with which some
antiquarians may perhaps be less familiar:—
“$htt port 5 ºuttatht ºf rosts
$3t 3&mightt ſuijtm first slºtt me...
3 goldt garlamüt the babbt sher on,
o makt ºrt spiffitri gttt.”
We regret to have to add (but Truth must not be sacrificed, though
gallantry might wish it so), that the ladies of this period were by no
means so attentive to their hands as to their heads, for though they
took º care to dress and decorate the former they were actually
so vulgar as to leave the latter naked! P; the old iiſuminations the
clearest light is thrown on this appalling fact, and we have read in
black and white abundant other proof of it. Thus, when KING HENRY,
in the well-known ballad of “fagre 13tsamomit,” mentions as his
reason for going down to Woodstock, that he merely wished to get
some gloves made for his wife, “y” furious queene” throws instantly
discredit on the statement; and knowing that those articles of dress
were not in fashion, with a woman's quick sagacity she jumps to the
conclusion that:—
“Cºif bet ºutnt thir for Globt-makgng
iftt was tuitijoute gº & !”
For further illustration of this love-story or glove-story, we may
well refer our readers to the Gallery of Illustration; where the tale
of “Rosa mundi, non Rosa munda” will be classically told them by
one Johan NEs. PARRY in what, if not a parody, may at least be
termed a Parrydy.

Rubrical Costume.
MR. Punch presents his
compliments to the Rev.
BRYAN KING, and recom-
mends him to buy a quire
of foolscap wherewith to
make caps for his choris-
ters, and also a suitable
covering for any other head
which he may feel it to
fit.
THE UMBRELLA RIFLE.
MR. PUNCH begs to call the attention of Volunteers in general to
his newly-invented weapon, the UMBRELLA RIFLE, which has been
introduced by him expressly to meet the requirements of the present
rainy season. With that modesty which ever is attendant on true
º: Mr. Punch will frankly own that his invention was suggested
y a well-known apparatus, which combines those useful implements
the parasol and whip. By cleverly adapting this ingenious idea,
Mr. Punch has introduced an instrument for Riflemen which will prove
at once protective and destructive, and will shield them from a soaking
while it provides them with the means of opening a hot fire. The
umbrella being fixed near to the muzzle of the rifle, the ribs, when not
distended, will lie flat along the barrel, and will be covered in fine
weather with the usual oilskin case. No impediment will thus occur
in taking aim, nor will the handling of the rifle in the least be interfered
with. As soon, however, as a shower comes (as on marching or parade
days it is almost sure to do), the order can be given to “Uncover
.."." and the men may stand at ease and defy the threatened
ucking.
Mr. Punch need not dilate upon the benefits and comforts his inven-
tion will conſer on Volunteers who wisely use it; but as economy is
(said to be) the order of the day, he may just point out how vastly his
new instrument will help towards it. }. has been calculated by a
most eminent military mathematician, that every time a Rifleman gets
soaked through to the skin (which happens on an average three times
out of four that he ventures on parade) five shillingsworth of inju
is done to a new uniform, and as much as three and sixpence º
of damage to an old one. Whenever he gets “washed, just washed
in a shower,” not less than one and ninepence worth of gloss is wetted
off him: while, since it is proverbial that
“London rain
Leaves a stain,”
as few as half-a-dozen drops of it will take out of him at least a
shillingsworth of shine. . .
When to this account is added the saving of expense in cabbing
home from wet parades, and of doctors' bills for curing cramps and
coughs and colds, and the hundred other ills that ºf flesh is heir
to, Mr. Punch feels proudly sure that his UMBRELLA RIFLE will prove
to be the cheapest and most comfortable weapon that has been ever
introduced to the notice of the nation, and no Volunteer's equipment
will be thought complete without it.
A drawing showing the invention as it appears in use will be shown
for a few days in the window of the Punch Office, when as well as
afterward, copies may be had, price threepence, at the counter, or four-
pence if impressed with the Governmental stamp. -
N.B. MacKINTosh ED PERCUssion-CAPs for the Wimbledon Meeting
should be immediately applied for. Also ask for Mr. Punch's IMPER-
vious Short-PIPE Cover and WATERFRoof CIGARs, which have been
expressly manufactured for bad weather, and are essential to damp
Riflemen when “marching easy” in the wet.
A PROFESSOR IN THE “HUE AND CRY.”
UNDER the head of “Extensive Robberies of Cash, Plate, and
Jewels” the Morning Post, the other day, enumerating a glut of crimes,
of which information had been received the day before by the Police,
states that the Authorities of Scotland Yard had been apprised–
“That the Rev. W. S. CHArkley, a Wesleyan preacher, had gone off with £5,000,
which he obtained by fraud and forgery as Secretary to the Lancashire Mutual
Loan Society. The discovery of Chalkley's delinquency has created much
among the Reformed Wesleyans, of which body he was a member."
There must be some mistake in this announcement. The idea of
any Wesleyan preacher bolting with money with which he had been
entrusted, is absurd enough; but the conception of a preacher who is
not merely a Wesleyan, but even a reformed one, committing such an
offence, is too ridiculous. It is incredible that an ordinary methodist
parson should be a rogue, and quite out of the question that extra-
sanctified methodism should be consistent with double-dyed rascality.
We cannot believe that Brother Chalkley, walked his chalks with
the funds of the brethren. At least, let us hope that if there is º
truth in the report that MR. Chalkley has “gone off with £5,000.’"
the fact simply is, that the Rev. Gentleman, being a bachelor, and
having been successful in the pulpit, has eloped with an heiress of that
amount, who is now MRs. ChâLKLEY, and rejoices in the congrat
tions of all the other reformed young methodist ladies who are
privileged to sit under her husband.
THE PRACTICAL Housewife.—“Sir,” said, speaking of his wife,
the husband of a lady whose mind was exclusively devoted to domestic
affairs—"Sir, she would have made a dumpling of the apple which
revealed the law of gravitation to Newton.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 2. Monday. MR.PUNch, not now speaking in lightness, but
on the contrary, as the Wiscount says, seriatim, observes that this has
been a remarkable Parliamentary week, and that mention of what took
place on its penultimate and antepenultimate days will he made in the
Constitutional Histories that will be read when Punch himself shall
he the only surviving representative of the Victorian Age. LoRD
MACAULAY's New Zealander—no, let us give the eternal and unborn
heathen a little peace—but this is a week to be remembered, and there-
fore Mr. Punch erects to it a memorial, are perennius, and though now
F. for a ludicrously small amount of that metal, will one day
worth, the weight, in gold, of the three largest George the Third
pennies that were ever shied at a mudlark at Greenwich.
On the Monday the noticeable incident in the Lords was the extra-
ordinary obstinacy of the Duke of MARLBoRough. When small men
eal with great subjects they usually display an arrogance proportioned
to their incapacity. The DUKE of MARLBorough conceives that he has
a mission to direct England as to the mode in which she shall educate
India. Wise men have thought that during the present state of the
minds of the natives of India it is better that we should gradually pre-
; those minds for the reception of Christian teaching, than at once
egin, with the Bible. The Duke thinks, differently, and insisted
to-night on bringing forward a motion on, the subject. The leading
Representative Men in the Lords begged him not to do so. LoRD
SHAFTESBURY, for Evangelicalism and Missionary Societies, LoRD
ELLENBOROUGH, for Indian Governments, LoRD GRANVILLE, for the
QUEEN’s Government, LoRD DERBY, for the QUEEN’s Opposition, and
LoRD BRough AM, for Common Sense and Experience, all urged this
request, but in vain. The Duke was stubborn, and made a long
speech, and his motion. The severest rebuke which can be read to a
fºllº, was then administered. ... No answer was made him, but
oRD BRough AM without a needless word moved the Previous
Question, which means (vide your DoD) that a formal method was
taken of getting rid of a subject which a meeting has no intention of
discussing. The Duke was dropped as flat as his own speech.
In the Commons, the first move was made in the Important Game
to which Mr. Punch has adverted, LoRD PALMERSTON giving notice
that he should on the Thursday call attention to the Report of the
Committee on the interference of the Lords with Tax Bills, and should
propose certain Resolutions.
he debate on the Indian Army Fusion Bill was resumed and con-
tinued by MR. Rich (the late MR. HENRY DRUMMOND's Little Pig
that squeaked because lacteal nourishment was not attainable by it),
SIR. DE LACY EVANs, who stood up for the loyalty of the English
soldiers in India, and urged that they had been treated unfairly and
ungraciously in the arrangements of the transfer of the Army to the
QUEEN, MR. Monckton MILNEs, who protested against Qur'Lust of
Centralisation, and divers other military and lay figures, and the second
reading of the Bill was finally carried by 282 to 53. There was a
nursery rhyme of Mr. Punch's demigodlike infancy, a rhyme descended
from the time of the Civil Wars, but which he never has been able to
connect with the history of the period:—
“High diddle diddle and high diddle ding, ...
The Parliament soldiers are going to the King.”
Infants of the present generation may have this transfer and fusion
business stamped upon their butter-like memories by a variation upon
the above beautiful couplet:—
“High diddle, diddle the soldier so green,
The Company’s Soldiers are sold to the QUEEN.”
Tuesday. The Bill for providing means for settling disputes between
Masters and Operatives (this does not mean Maestriand Opera-singers,
Wiscount) was read a second time in the Lords, but declared very
unsatisfactory. A Bill for creating a Native Council in New Zealand,
for settling #and disputes, was read a second time, on the Govern-
ment's motion. It is to be hoped that it provides for civil and polite
conduct on the part of the Members towards each other... We shall
erhaps read of references to “the Honourable Member with the Blue
attoo,” and that “the Speaker then retired and eat his grandmother;
after which the Council resumed.”
After some military debates in the Commons, they got themselves
No. 992.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Counted Out. Some Gas Bill dodge was said to have something to do
with the affair.
Wednesday. Good MR. HuBBARD,
He went to his cupboard,
And put in his meat little Bill -
(On the vext Church Rate question)
At civil suggestion
That the measure amounted to nil.
A very f: Bill for taking the mismanagement of country roads out
of the hands of slow, stupid, and .# boors, and transferring the
duty to a responsible Board that could be made to understand a
subject, and to feel a kicking for neglecting it, was read a second
time by 203 to 120, MR. HENLEY, as usual, growling and grumbling
against any change in any existing system. For a man of real sense,
HENLEY is the best type of an Obstructive that is presented in the
House of Commons. He knows enough to do very great mischief,
and, as somebody told him more truly than civilly, he worries Bills like
a great ferret with a rat. It was very fit that such a Stick-in-the-mud
should oppose a measure for making roads passable, and this senti-
mental excuse is the only one that Mr. Punch can invent for him.
Then came another thing considerably to be regretted. Does anybody
know what a Marine Store Dealer is P. He or she, for the women are
worse than the men, keeps a filthy little den, usually covered with
vulgar, flaunting placards, tempting servant girls and the like with
visions of fine clothes in exchange for “odds and ends,” and with
doggerel verses such as:—
“If you want a bit of luck
Qome to MoTHER HABAKKuk,
Bring old bottles, bones, and rags,
And she will fill your money-bags.”
But this is merely a blind... The real business of the rogue is to buy,
for as little of course as will be taken, anything that a servant, a child,
or an apprentice, can bring. The Marine-Store keeper is, in fact, a
receiver of stolen goods, and half the juvenile crime of our cities is
attributable to these wretches, who not only receive the produce of
thefts, but hint to their customers what thefts are easiest and most
profitable. The Police Magistrates would have the utmost pleasure in
seeing them all transported, but unluckily they are themselves in
no peril of such an earit, though they annually send hundreds and
thousands to our gaols and convict-ships. Various attempts have been
made to give the police some hold over the rascals, but the means have
not been very effective, and the fearful demoralisation business goes on.
A Bill has been introduced this session for dealing with them, but in
the natural desire of the framers to make it as stringent as possible,
they have so devised it as to make it operate against honest trades-
people. SIR. G. C. Lewis remarked that it was true that “Marine
Store Dealers were to a great extent dealers in stolen # *. but he
did not promise his aid in amending and carrying so needful a measure.
He did promise, however, to consult with the Magistrates.
Thursday. That, poor old creature, LoRD NoHMANBy, did a little
cackling against GARIBALDI and the italians; but the aged goose only
succeeded in eliciting from several Peers, a warm tribute to the
humanity, as well as to the bravery, of the Dictator of Sicily. Non-
MANBY on GARIBALDI is like an old black beetle crawling on a lion's
Inaue.
In the Commons, Lord John Russell, mentioned that PRESIDENT
BuchanaN had recalled GENERAL HARNEY from San Juan. This
HARNEY has been trying to get up a collision between the English
and the Americans at San Juan. He is so fond of bloodshedding that
he once flogged a woman to death. The PRESIDENT has very wisely
removed this man, and all seems likely to be serene until the question
of ownership shall be decided between the Governments. Loºp John
also stated that our Commander, off Naples, knows exactly what to do
in the event of an insurrection.
Then began the discussion upon the Resolutions moved by LoRD
PALMERSTON, in assertion of the Rights and Privileges of the House
of Commons. As Mr. Punch's Parliamentary History is about the §
one which anybody, now reads, and will be quite the only one which
will be read by Posterity, he deems it fit, in the exercise of his
flºus Wisdom, to insert those Resolutions in this place. They are
eSe:—
“1. That the right of granting aids and supplies to the Crown is in the Commons
alone, as an essential part of their constitution; and the limitation of all such
grants, as to the matter, manner, measure, and time, is only in them.
“2. That although the Lords have exercised the power of rejecting Bills of several
descriptions relating to taxation by negativing the whole, yet the exercise of that
power by them has not been frequent, and is justly regarded by this House with
peculiar jealousy, as affecting the right of the Commons to grant the supplies and
to provide the ways and means for the service of the year.
“3. That, to guard for the future against an undue exercise of that power by the
Lords, and to secure to the Commons their rightful control over taxation and
supply, this House has in its own hands the power so to impose and remit taxes,
and to frame Bills of supply, that the right of the Commons as to the matter,
manner, measure, and time, may be maintained inviolate.”
The debate which followed, and which lasted through Thursday and
Friday night, was remarkable in itself, on account of the attitude into
which the House, by addressing itself to such a subject, put itself in
regard to the House of Lords, and also on account of the fact that
while LoRD PALMERston, the Premier, virtually defended the conduct
of the Lords, and stated himself content with the proposed protest,
MR. GLADstons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Load John
Russell, the Foreign Secretary, took an opposite course, MR.GLAp-
stone desiring “Action,” and LoRp John “reserving a right” to do
as he might see fit. . It is not improbable that such a Split, on such a
question, may lead to a solution of continuity in a certain Cabinet, but
we shall see. There is no doubt about the fact, for the ultra-Liberals
are pouring their fiercest abuse upon LoRD PALMERSTON, as a Faithless
Chief, a Traitor, and all sorts of sad things, and lauding MR.GLAD-
stone and LoRD JoHN as something a little better than any Patriots
of F. ages who have died for their country.
ord PALMERston moved the Resolutions in a speech of much
tact, dexterity, and good sense. He was vehemently cheered—by the
Opposition.
R. Collier, learnedly and lengthily, censured the Lords, and
warned the House to be on guard. -
MR. CoNINGHAM was not content with merely recording resolutions,
and was for forcing the Peers to give way.
b *. Scully thought that passing the Resolutions was all that could
e done.
MR. LEATHAM was contemptuous about precedents, denounced the
Lords, and had something to say about CHARLEs THE FIRst's head.
MR. BERNAL Osbok NE made fun of the grammar of the Resolutions,
and declared them intended to º up a Treasury quarrel.
MR. Edwin JAMEs called the Resolutions lame and impotent, and
the act of the Lords a usurpation.
MR. GLADstone taunted the Opposition for not speaking, called the
Resolutions mild and temperate, but thought that the House would do
well to vindicate its rights by action. He spoke vehemently, and was
vehemently cheered by a portion of the Liberals.
MR. WHITEside, roused, fired off one of his ready salvoes of good
slashing sarcasm, and demanded whether it was desired to subvert the
*...a...: lar mark, and t
ter some speeches of no particular mark, and a smart one, agains
the Lords, by #. STANSFELD
MR. DiskAELI complimented the PREMIER, and approved the Reso-
lutions, but defended the Lords, and poured a quantity of ridicule on
MR. GLADstone, and upon the Šplit in the Liberal party.
LoRD John Russell thought that the Lords had used their power
in an unprecedented manner, and declared his no-confidence in LoRD
§: leading. The debate was adjourned, and resumed next
night by
R. DIGBY SEYMoUR, who was not satisfied with the Resolutions.
MR. HoRsMAN delivered a spirited defence of the Lords, and
castigated MR. GLADSTONE for playing tricks with finance.
Mr. BRIGHT abused MR. Hors.MAN, made a very effective speech in
favour of the Budget and the French Treaty, and said that the House
was about to abase itself before the hereditary chamber.
Excitement followed, two divisions on adjournment were ºl."
the motions for it were defeated by 433 to 36, and 369 to 52, and then
THE House of CoMMons AGREED To Lord PALMERSTON's REso-
LUTIONS.
RESOLUTION p. ACTION.
SAYs PAM, with his smile, friends or foes to beguile,
And his jaunty elocution,-
“You may trust all to me, my dear GLADstone, you see,
I'm a man of resolution.”
Says GLADSTONE, with gloom in his eyes of doom—
And a smile—not of satisfaction:
“Resolution, dear PAM?—That's all S. H. A. M.
I am a man of action /*
Says PAM, “Say you so * Then 'tis well you should know
hat the Lords your mistake to correct meant;
And the action I’ll take, if a rumpus you make,
Is an action of ejectment.”
Action of Damages; England v. China.
The estimate of the sum we shall have to pay towards defraying the
expenses of the Chinese War, amounts to £3,800,000. That is the
damage that has yet been done by our naval and military operations in
China. It is much to be feared that all the future damage which may
be caused by those proceedings will, affect only ourselves. We may
pursue the Chinese; but are too likely to catch only the Tartar portion
of the population.

From these premises

C. E. PUTNAM, with
her son, MR. EDMUND
T. PUTNAM, and party,
consisting of a lady
and gentleman, respec-
tively named SMITH
and CAssey, having
taken first class pas-
senger tickets ºfcr
England on board the
steamer Europa, CAP-
TAIN LEich, were, a
few days before the
steamer sailed, served
with the following
notice:–
"British and North American Royal Mail Steam-packet Company. Office, 99, State Street, Boston, Oct. 27, 1859.
“For your information, we desire to inform you that a separate table will be provided for yourself and
party on board the Europa, hence to Liverpool, where everything will be furnished you that first cabin
passengers are entitled to; the person who applied for your tickets did not state the fact that the party
were coloured, otherwise we should have informed you.
“Should this interfere with your expectations, please apply at this office at once, and we will refund the
passage-money. Respectfully,
“Mrs. E. Putnam and party, Salem.” E. C. and J. G. BATEs.
“(Signed)
“The arrangement above indicated, MRs. PUTNAM states, was enforced during the voyage.
She says, in a letter to an English gentleman:—
“During the whole voyage we were not allowed a seat at the table. . . . . And during the last few days
of our voyage we were obliged to sit in the ladies' cabin by ourselves, and servants bring us food as if we were
criminals, when we had conducted ourselves with the strictest propriety. The captain committed a great
wrong in submitting to the dictation of an American agent. Yours, &c.,
“(Signed) C. E. PUTNAM.”
“Now the above particulars, and more to the same . were communicated by MR.
M. D. HILL and . CHAPMAN to the party mysteriously entitled SIR, SAMUEL CUNARD,
together with the respectful expression of a * that, as the chief proprietor of the American
line of packets including the Europa, he would prevent the repetition by his agents of the
conduct of which they were guilty towards MRs.
PUTNAM and her friends. To this communica.
tion no answer...was returned. A second appeal
obtained the following reply:—
“Bush-hill-House Edmonton, June 29, 1860.
i º Sir, I have received your letters of the 8th and 28th
inst.
“I do not see that any advantage would result from
discussing the subject matter of those letters, therefore I
must decline entering into any correspondence on the
subject. “I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
“S. Cunard.”
“The Rev. E. Chapman, Durdham Down, Bristol."
."Surely the writer of the above letter, signing
himself. S. CUNARD, is plain SAMUEL. It is
impossible that he can be “SIR” SAMUEL. To
be in case to bear the title of SIR, he must needs
be a British subject; whereas it is manifest that
S. Cunard is a regular Yankee. No Englishman
could possibly be capable of such subserviency to
the wicked and absurd antipathies of the American
ºl. as to permit, on board any vessel under
his control, the continued perpetration of the
infamous insolence which MRs. PUTNAM declares
to have been practised on herself and her friends
by the authorities of the Europa. Any SIR
SAMUEL CUNARD would have written at once to
MR. CHAPMAN, apologising for the base brutality
of his servants, and promising to take care that
no ship of his should ever again be disgraced by
such atrocious truckling to the prejudices of
American snobs. The author of the foregoing
refusal to entertain the question of putting a
stop to a system of outrages, upon justice,
humanity, freedom, and English civilisation,
can only be one simply MR. SAMUEL CUNARD !
SAMUEL unadorned; SAMUEL, without a handle

countryman of Uncle SAM.

BUTCHER's meat is high, and accordingly the
working classes have very reasonably resolved to
abstain from it. If, however, in consequence of
this resolution, the butchers are prevented from
selling their beef and mutton off their hands, and

soon get still higher.
OUR FACETIOUS FRIENDS.
PUNCH has sometimes been found fault with both by ignorant and
timid persons, for venturing to poke his fun at our near and dear
THE STOOL THAT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE STOOD
UPON.
OUR PREMIER he made a Precedents' stool,
With three legs, as neat as could be,
allies (who might be held still dearer if they were not so expensive
to us). Stupid people say the French don't understand a jest, while
timid ones declare they are so thin skinned and so sensitive that the
cannot take good humouredly a harmless laugh at their expense; and,
as an element of enmity, one might as well propose to crack a rifle as a
joke at them. How far away from truth are these absurd Britannic
notions, may be shown by this brief extract from one of the few dozens
of French pamphlets lately published, which by their friendly tone and
truthfulness have by no means less astonished than they have delighted
us:—
“It is absolutely essential to the existence of the British Empire that the entire
class of peasants of Ireland should be maintained in a condition which renders
them perfectly docile and easy to decimate when they grow too numerous, or not
disposed to º recruits to the army. They who are of opinion that the English
is the basest and most horrible tyranny which ever scandalised the earth will
pºly form the wish that her indispensable support, Ireland, shall be taken from
er."
The statement that “the English is the basest, and most horrible
tyranny, which ever scandalised the earth” is really, to our thinking,
so exquisitely ludicrous that one might fancy, that the force of funning
could no further go, were it not for the still funnier remark, directly
following it. But that Ireland should be viewed as really being
*** s “indispensable support” is an idea which is so flattering as
well as so facetious, that, we should almost feel inclined to, give the
writer an engagement did not the interests of our readers prohibit such
a Course.
Out of old HATSELL wood, the workmanship good,
And the turning masterlie.
Then up came GLApSTONE, full of wrath,
Brimming o'er with a º so fine,
“Let me mount this stool, the House to school,
And deliver this soul of mine.”
“Now may—now may,” quoth the PREMIER gay,
“Thy speech thou may’st speak anon;
But this stool, my friend, thou mayst not ascend,
'Tis not meant for standing on.”
Then up and spake grim GLADSTONE,
And he smote the board till it rang—
“A stool with three legs, and none of 'em pegs
Whereon a speech to hang!
“I leave you to sink—I leave you to swim,
As pleases DISRAELi,
But the place where such cabinet-work is done,
Is no longer the Place for me.”
Then up he rose, and shook his clothes,
And clapped the chamber-door—
Which as Ministere to that sely Peer
He never entered more!

A PROFESSIONAL PROTEUS WANTED.
The advertisers daily grow more queer in their requirements, and
by no means the least strange are those connected with the theatres,
where novelty of any kind is always in request: . We take the following,
for instance, from the columns of the Era, which are constantly sup-
plying something funny of this sort:-
W ANTED, for an ENTERTAINMENT, a Professional Gentleman of
Versatile Powers, to play with a Lady. A good figure and personal appearance
indispensable. Age not over. Thirty. Characters to be sustained :-A Young, and
an E derly Gentleman, a Modern Fop, a Frenchman, and a Drunken Character in
Low Life. A fixed salary weekly.—Address, &c
A gentleman must need, have “powers” ...something more than
“versatile” to make him able to comply with all these various require-
ments. Were nothing said about his “personal appearance,” the
task might indeed be much more easy of accomplishment. But although
it may be proper for him to he possessed of a “good figure” to enable
him successfully to “play with a lady,” it seems to us that this would
not be an advantage to him when appearing as a “drunken character
in low life,” and he must indeed be a most skilful pantomimist to
undertake the transformation scenes which seem to be required of him.

“MY DEAR PUNCH,
- “THREADING my way through the mazes of flounce and
crinoline which fill the R. A. Exhibition, I found myself one morning
in the North Room.
. “Poor MR. WILKINs, the Architect, to whose taste and skill we are
indebted for the design of these halls, has been much abused for his

mistakes—for inventing the North Room, that cool retreat from the

at a picture in comfort, and without prejudice—to corns.
“Nor are the works exhibited in this little Sanctuary to be over-
looked or despised as an insignificant part of the show. Let gentle-
men console themselves who are condemned to be hung (I allude, of
course, to their paintings) in the North Room. Here their friends
can examine their canvas at leisure; and as for dignity, are not HUNT,
PICKERSGILL, and RICHMOND, good company for any of us? The
fact is, that crowds rush through the larger rooms to see A.’s famous
Allegory, and B.'s grand Battle-piece, or struggle to get a peep at the
exquisite portraits by DAUBNEY. Suppose this or that picture is
raised,—let us say in The Connoisseur, or the Propylaeum, well—
it naturally becomes popular, and the British Public elbows, its way
up to it in admiration. It is the correct thing to do. I don’t sa
this out of spite, though my Coronation of Amalasuntha was rejected.
º I’m above envy—but such is the case. When, on the other
hand, I see any one in the North Room straining his neck here or
there, and anxiously turning over the leaves of his catalogue, I feel
pretty sure he is looking for a friend's picture, or is guided by his
own aesthetical instinct. And surely there is a sufficient variety in this
room to suit all tastes, from the simple truth and grace expressed
in MR. MoºRIs's /oices from the Sea, to the dismal text of MR.
STIRLING's ſterical Sermon. The former (537) is an English coast
scene. A young wife, and mother listens to her husband's farewell
shout as his boat scuds out to sea. Her ruddy children play beside
her, and one young rascal has run knee-deep into the water to catch
the last sound of his father's voice. It is a pretty, unaffected subject,
to which the painter has done justice; and—Oh, if MR. STIRLING
had but, chosen such a one, instead of depicting the horrors of a
“Revival,’ we should not have had to look at-
“A pastor anathematising his flock,
While Stiggins stands by in a dirty white stock,
And rears a placard. Sitting under is seen
A flunkey; his coat is of emerald green,
And crimson his breeches. Significant leers
This worthy bestows on a damsel in tears,
With a polychromatic and Brummagem shawl.
While a juvenile version of Samuel Hall
Attacks (most unjustly, it must be confest,)
His companion, attired in a bright yellow vest.
A reporter, “got up” in low comedy style,
Is dotting down notes. . An eccentric old file,
Sits watching the preacher. Observe in the rear
How the “fruits’ of the sermon begin to appear.
There’s a girl in hysterics, with terror dismayed,
While an anxious M.D. makes a rush to her aid.
Thus famatical froth, flirting, fighting, and fainting,
Form the subject of this—most remarkable painting.”
“The title of Ivory and Ehony is given by MR. ERCOLE to (483)
a picture representing a fair damsel in an unexceptionable brocaded
dress, attended by a nigger, who carries a plate of fruit. The contrast
* An ingenious friend of mine, the author of several very clever (and eminently
unsuccessful) poems, has, at my request, just dashed off these lines to show you what
might be done in the way of metrical critiques. Artists will be pleased to remem-
ber, that his terms are moderate, and inclusive of beer. Prae-Raphaelito notices
executed in Mediaeval type, and Royal Academicians waited upon at their own
co8. A Schibli.RUs, care of MR. CATNACH, &c.
is pretty, and the idea of ‘Ebony’ bearing apples has, at least, the
merit of novelty.
“MR. ERwooD's First Place deserves a better one on the Exhi-
bition walls. It is exquisitely finished, down to the very dust-pan
which the poor housemaid has laid aside for a few tearful moments
before she begins her day’s work.
“Love Knows no Sleep (531), by MR. W. WILLIAMs, represents a
flirtation between a young lady at an open window who is slipping a
letter into the hand of her lover as he leans through the casement.
If Love knows no sleep, the fair creature in question appears well
aware that, at least, her Mamma is dozing. As for the gent. in the
Balmoral bonnet, there is no doubt that He is tolerably wide awake.
gº º The Outrage upon Sir John Coventry, affords MR. MAGUIRE
a capital bit of melodramatic incident for illustration. Poor SIR
John appears hard pressed in the Sa sa encounter. He placed
himself against the wall (so runs the story), and thus, though foes
attacked him in front, he had bricks to back him. Two heavy villains
are already disarmed, and SIR. J. is laying about him bravely. It is
a curious fact, that though Cove NTRY was least likely of all to show
the white feather, he is the only cavalier in the lº". who wears one.
“To criticise The Critics would be hardly fair, mor, if MR.
EMMERSON chooses to paint from such models as are represented
on his canvas (559), has any one a right to interfere. It would be
violating the liberty of the subject, which in this instance, though a
singularly ugly one, is treated with skill. Artists will not fail to
appreciate the “accidental repeat” of the puppy behind the chair in
the spaniel on the carpet.
“Guilty or not Guilly? asks MR. HAYLLAR, apropos of his picture
(565), in which a fat little boy is seen standing by a Fortnum-and-
Masonic looking jar. Guilty, I suppose, of poaching on the home
preserves. -
“MR. G. D. LESLE contributes two works, Matelda (578), and
Meditation (588). The latter represents a young lady in a brown
study and pink dress lying by a green Fºl. She has chosen a some-
what damp spot for her reflections. It is melancholy to think that
such a close inspection of water lilies might be attended by—lum-
bago. The other picture (Matelda), is more interesting, and has
its admirers, among whom is your humble servant. -
“Let artists take warning by the incident which forms the subject
of MR. Hughes's picture (568), and keep, their studios locked up.
Young Hopeful is here earnestly engaged in laying ‘high lights’
on the nose of a lay figure, while his papa peeps round the corner,
apparently pleased with the experiment. ell—there is nothing like
encouraging youthful genius, even when manifested through the
medium of Roman white.
“One would have expected MR. WHISTLER's talents to have been
developed on the flute rather than At the Piano (598). , Neverthe-
less, the painting of that title shows genius. The tone which he has
produced from his piano is admirable, and he has struck on it a chord
of colour which will I hope find an echo in his future works.
“The South Room is, as you know, chiefly devoted to the exhibition
of Architectural designs, the critique on which I have no doubt has
been so ably conducted by my eminent friend, MR. T. SQUARER, else-
where, that further comment would be superfluous. There are, how-
ever, some portraits here to which I would willingly allude:... It would
be a pleasure to linger before the miniatures, of MESSRs. WELLs and
MoIRA, and note the grace and artistic skill in the water-colour
portraits by MR. MooRE, but it is time to close my letter.
“As I descended from the R. A. Rooms, after looking at the thou-
sand and ninety-sixth Work of Art there exhibited, I passed through
the Condemned Cell—I mean the room devoted to rejected contri-
butions. Alas! for the vanity of human hopes | There lay dear

PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
REIGN OF HENRY THE
CHAPTER XXII. — PERIOD — THE
THIRD.
UT little change of costume
occurred in this long reign,
and we may therefore make
short work of what we have
to say about it. This in-
deed we are the more at
liberty to do, having, with
our usual gallantry, ac-
corded place aur dames,
and described in our last
Chapter the dresses of the
ladies. To come now to
their lesser halves (who
through crinoline are now-
a-days dwindling down to
less than quarters), we leave
our artist to depict a Por-
trait of a Gentleman, as he
would doubtless have ap-
peared at the R. A. Exhibi-
tion, had the Academy been
opened in the thirteenth
century. -
The reader will perceive
from this artistic work, at
least if his perception be
aided by our pen, that the
chiefly novel points about
the male dress of this period
were, that the robe, was
somewhat fancifully slit, or
slashed, or slittered,” and
that the boots were fretled, again worn with long toes. The robe was
called a “quintis,” or “contise,” from this slashing, the word quinteur
in French meaning fancifulorfreak-
ish: epithets which almost seem
too mild to be applied to men who
had their coats cut all to bits before
they’d wear them. Such dandies
might have fitly worn strait-waist-
coats with their robes, and have
been vested with the right to sit in
the “Mad Parliament.”
Another point to which we may
direct attention is, that drawers
were worn in this reign, so as to
be visible; the tunic, being open
as high up as the waist, that the
right leg might be left more free
to be put forward. This fashion
must have specially found favour
with the young, for they must have
found it difficult to “over” posts,
or fly the garter, when their tunics,
like old Jones's coat, were “all
buttoned down before.” -
A garment called a “cyclas” is
first mentioned in this reign: the
city swells who were invited to
King HENRY's Coronation wear-
ing, we are told, “cyclades worked
with gold over vestments of rich
silk.” The cyclas, it would seem,
was a sort of upper tunic, and de-
rived its name from the stuff which
it was made of. This was called
“cyclas,” from being manufactured
chiefly in the Cyclades, and not be-
cause, as has been fancied, it was
first made for sick ladies. - -
Another new material, was a rich silk woven with gold, which was
known as cloth of Baldekins, from its being made at Baldeck, as
Babylon was then called. In fact the tailors of this period appear to
have done more in introducing new materials than in altering the
fashions, and their poverty of invention was atoned for in some |E

measure by the richness of their stuffs. The effigy of the King on
his monument at Westminster (on view for a few coppers to the Dean
and º represents him, as is usual, in his royal robes; consist-
ing simply of a tunic, made rather long and full, and a mantle which
is fastened by a brooch on the
right shoulder. The most splen-
did things about him are certainly
his boots, which are, like a surly
miser, fretted with gold; each
square of the fret having the
figure of a lion in it, with its tail
put out of joint and twisted level
with its back.
Mantles and cloaks were only
used on state occasions and in
travelling; for which latter use a
kind of over-all was worn, called
a super-totus, in the Latin of the
monks. This was an improve-
ment on the capa, or Norman
cloak, not only being bigger, but
having sleeves as well as hood.
It was likewise called balandrana by monks, who liked fine names;
and under this title (derived from the French balandran, a foul-weather
cloak), monks of the or-
der of St. Benedict were
ordered not to wear it.
Why they were so is a
question which is open to
our guessing, and we
may fancy if we like,
for there is nobody to
hinder us, that, perhaps,
the Benedictines were
chary of lavation, and so
a ducking now and then
was thought conducive to
their health.
With regard to the ca-
pillary fashions of this
reign we find that men
in general were tolerably
close shavers, but that
they mostly wore their
hair in flowing curls, at
least if they could any
how prevail on it to grow
so. Cowls or hoods were
used for head-cover, and
so were small round caps
and hats, the latter not
unlike the old, “beaver.”of our youth, but which must not be con-
founded with that mentioned in dº passage:-

ings, bear some likeness, to the cockneys we have seen unhorsed at
Epping, with their handkerchiefs tied round their heads to take the
place of their lost hats.
The historian MATTHEw PARIs, the Monk of St. Alban's, favours
us with some descriptions of the fashions of this period, and proclaims
himself disgusted with the fopperies he witnessed. it seems, how-
ever, somewhat questionable if the clergy were in general of this
austere ... for their garments for the most part were so fop-
pishly embroidered, that, Pope INNocent THE Fourth is said to
have exclaimed: "O England! thou garden of delights, thou art truly
an inexhaustible fountain of riches! From thy abundance much may
be exacted!”. What º there was present when he made this
observation the chronicles do not enable us to say; and indeed we
rather question if Pope INNocent was such an innocent as to talk
about exactions, however much inclined he might be, possibly, to make
them. That he was rather so disposed we find from certain bulls
which he despatched to several English prelates, enjoining them to
send him a quantity of vestments, for the use (at least he says so) of
the priests who were at Rome. Many of these habits, are described
as being “covered with gold and precious stones,” while others were
"embroidered with the figures of animals and flowers;” so that the
English priests who were deprived of these “beautiful vestments”
might have lamented them as did the priest of our St. George's-in-the-
ast.
We may note here that the red hat. Punch so often has poked ſun at
was, as it appears, a bright invention of this INNocent: and was
resented by His Innocence (what a rare name for a Pope!) to the
ardinals who came to the Council of Lyons, held, as everybody

knows, in the year 1245. According to De Curbio, they wore it for
the first time in the twelvemonth following, at an interview between
His Innocence and KING Louis
The NiNth. The hat when first
invented was not made with a flat
brim, as it is at present, but was
moulded to the fashion of the
mouth of a French horn, and
looked like an old wide-awake
knocked rather out of shape.
During HENRY's reign it was
that the Dominicans, or preaching
friars, and the Franciscans, or
friars minor, were established in
this country. From their black
cloak and º the first were
called Black Friars (Cox pe. FINs-
BURY is wrong in saying they were
ed so because they made their
hands black in frying their parched
peas): while the Franciscans had
the title of Grey Friars applied to
them, because, like many of our
Riflemen, they preferred to dress
in grey. Calumny has hinted that
these reverend old fathers were
somewhat prone to the enjoyment
of mundane creature comforts, albeit they affected to hold them in
contempt; and this suspicion, we must own, is supported by the
passage:–

THE LADIES” OWN RIFLE CORPS.
“Honeysuckle House, Hampstead.
7----- AM sure, my dear Mr. Punch, that
you who so zealously keep watch
over our national defences, and
have been so warm a friend to our
gallant Volunteers, will be glad
to hear that steps are being taken
by which a great accession will be
soon made to their ranks, and the
security of England be perfectly
ensured. With a view to this
result it is intended to get up a
Rifle Corps for Ladies, and arrange-
ments are on foot by which the
petticoats may everywhere be
pressed into the service, and
some thousands of good feminine
effectives be enrolled.
“I dare say you may smile at
the notion of weak women volun-
teering to defend themselves, and
boasting that they mean to come
out thousands strong. But you
know one doesn't want much
strength to pull a trigger, and as
for skill, I’m sure we women very
often get the better of you men.
If ladies can shoot pheasants, as
the papers say they do, they surely
might soon learn to aim at larger animals, and be as deadly in a battle
as they are in a battue. And I’m sure they can't do better than take
ttern by HER MAJESTY, who hit the middle of the bull's eye at four
undred miles range (wasn't it?) and showed herself undoubtedly the
first shot of the day. Moreover, if they be not so destructive with
their rifles as the shooters who belong to the coarser-sinewed sex, they
have other weapons always at command, which would do good exe-
cution, upon any hostile ranks. Their ocular artillery is ever read
primed, and when it is well served what foe could hope to face it?
should like to see the Frenchman who would dare to keep his ground
when the ladies’ corps were ordered to put on their killing looks, and
to set their rifle caps at him!
“Besides, Sir, there are sanitary reasons to allure us, and good
health you know is needful to the keeping of good looks. I'm sure
the exercise of drill, is doing wonders for you men, and I can't see
why we women should not also take advantage of it. You do look so
much better now that you’ve been taught to hold your backs straight
and your heads up, and to keep your legs free from that sluggish sort
of slouch, and your hands from that eternal fumble in those hateful
pe/top pockets. . I declare young MR. MoneyBAGs (whom Mamma
would make me dance with, don't you know, at LADY SQUABBLEToN's)
was positively hideous until he took to drill, and now he’s grown so
handsome that really when he called the other day I hardly knew him :
It was very rude of Ma to compliment him as she did on the improve-
ment in his looks, but I’m sure that he deserved it, and really his
moustache is getting on quite visibly, and if rifle practice gives one
such a healthy, clear complexion, I’m sure that many girls I know
would be the better for it. LAURA PERTLY would for one, and as a
friend I should advise her to try a dose of drilling before she throws
her sheep's eyes any more at MR. M., who (I've heard him say) can't
bear those tallowy, flabby faces, which look as though one could make
dokes in them, as children do in putty.
“So we ladies, Mr. Punch, intend to go to drill as you do, and
although we may be awkwardish at first, you must bear in mind, Sir,
what you were yourself,” and must not laugh at us for treading in
your goose steps. The drill will be a healthy exercise for girls, and
there’s no reason why it should not be as fashionable as dancing. And
so, say I, let ladies put their best foot foremost, and for the mere sake
of the exercise join the Rifle Movement. Let them get up Rifle
Meetings in the lieu of Archery, and take to burning powder instead
of midnight ball lamps. You old grumblers keep on growling that
we women want employment. Now, if we started Rifle Corps, you’d
have to hold your tongues, I think; for judging by the time you spend,
or rather that you say you spend, on marches and parades, and club
meetings, and drills, }. sure that if we ladies only do as you do,
there’ll be very little seen of us at home, Sir, and you'll have no cause
for twitting us with want of occupation.
“And so, Sir, hoping next year to compete for the Ladies' Prize at
Wimbledon, believe me to remain,
“Your constant reader and admirer,
“ANGELINA SMITH.”
“P.S. Don’t you think that mauve would look nice for our uniform,
with rose-colour cuffs and facings, and pheasant’s feathers in our
caps? I rather fancy, though, that some of us would like all scarlet
§ for the last thing women wish for is to make themselves
invisible.”
* Don't be personal, young lady, and consult your dictionary. There is no such
word as “awkwardish" existing in the language, and if there were, it is impossible
that WE should ever be described by it.—Punch.
MURDER ON THE PLATFORM.
MR. BRIGHT's Organ played the following pleasing little air last
Saturday:—
“On Thursday evening Count Rudio (so well known as being connected with the
late attempt to assassinate the EMPERoit of the FRENch) gave a lecture at the
Assembly Rooms, Nottingham. MR. CLARK presided. The Count gave a detailed
history of the conspiracy in which he had been engaged. . . He (the Count) had
attempted tyrannicide for the benefit of his fellow-creatures and the punishment ºf
a great crime. As his hearers well knew, the attempt was defeated, and his brave
friend, ORsiN1, perished on the scaffold. The modern hero *. him (the speaker)
as a cat spared a mouse—only to torture it. No tongue could describe the. sufferings
he underwent, and how he survived he could not tell. The lecturer concluded by
giving a narrative of his escape from the penal settlement to which he had been
cºndemned, and his journey to England. HE THEN Resumed his seat AMID Loud
CHEERs."
All things considered, Mr. Punch is not exactly delighted with the
above information. His own admiration for the EMPEROR OF THE
FRENch is known to be excessive, and this may make Mr. Punch unduly
sensitive. But he cannot help thinking that “the QRSINI attempt”
was an abominable and dastardly crime, by which the destruction of
innocent persons might have been accomplished, and that Count
RUDIo's “brave friend” was a cowardly assassin, who well deserved
to lose his head. Count RUDIO is lucky to have escaped, and would
show himself more worthy of his good luck did he abstain from
exhibiting himself to Englishmen as a murderer in intention. Mr.
Punch suspects the “loud cheers” to have been an invention of
the penny-a-liner, but if RUDIo were really cheered, the Notting-
ham audience must have permitted their compassion for a foreigner
and an exile, to triumph over their sense of decency. MR. BRIGHT's
paper publishes the statement without a word of . reprobation or
regret, but this Mr. Punch takes to be merely an instance of the
habitually careless editing of the penny press, and not an indication
that RUdio is regarded as a hero by MR. BRIGHT's editor. Mr. Punch,
however, on behalf of his country, at once signifies to Europe, that
English detestation of the Dagger-School almost, equals English
detestation of the systems of tyranny that provoke ill-regulated minds
to Murder, and that we have a different platform from that of an
assembly-room for the benefit of those who break the Sixth Com-
mandment.

WORK FOR WOMAN.
WHAT are we to do with our young women? is a question which is
now beginning to be seriously asked by the benevolent, and by Pater-
familias. Thanks to the prevalent taste for a profusion of finery,
combined with a rising Income Tax, girls are getting too dear, that is
to say too expensive, creatures, to find husbands. Under these cir-
cumstances there has been formed a Society for the Employment of
Women. It met, the other evening at 19, Langham Place, the EARL
of Shaftesbury in the Chair. Among various recommendations
and suggestions for the accomplishment of its gallant and generous
object, - -
“MR. Cookson urged law-engrossing as a suitable occupation for women,
described the office established by the Society, which is at present, supported by
several solicitors, and gave an interesting account of the work done there."
This is a very good notion. Young ladies are generally fond of
writing. Employed in lawyers’ offices they will turn to profitable
account a propensity which now merely wastes ink and º The
female copying clerk, who supports herself by her quill, will no longer
Jen a billet when she should engross. Some caution must be exercised
y the solicitor's official handmaiden lest she should, at first starting,
spoil some quantity of sheepskin. She should beware of underlining
not only words and sentences which are by no means emphatic, but
also of underscoring any words whatever, and if she has a long deed to
draw up, she must mind not to cross it. These and a few other caveats
being observed, legal engrossing may doubtless suit a young lady as
well as the at least equally engrossing care of a family.
The next notion is sufficiently reasonable:–
“MR HASTINGs spoke of printing as peculiarly well adapted for women, and read
a paper contributed by Miss EMILY Faithfull, on the introduction of women into
the printing trades.”
There is more pie capable of affording employment to ladies' ſingers
than that which is usually associated with pudding. Milliners are
accustomed to the making up of caps and bonnets, but there are caps,
if not bonnets, in a printing-office, which the fair sex might set up as
well as those that they are accustomed to construct of lace and artificial
flowers; . might compose both small caps and large caps in books,
if not in book-muslin. Authors will generally be in favour of a change
which will occasionally afford them visits from the printer's angel—
angelic visits not too few and far between.
A gentleman instrumentally indicated a void in female education,
which might be º; filled :-
“Mr. MACKENzie read a paper by Miss J. Bouchenett on book-keeping, stating
that a want of knowledge of accounts was one great reason of the disinclination to
employ women in shops, showing how they might be fitted for the offices of cashiers
and bookkeepers, and announcing that a school to supply these deficiencies had
been opened by the Society.”
Marble and chalk being essentially the same substance, except that
the former excels the latter in density, there is every reason to hope
that due education would soon convert the marble brow of Beauty into
a good “chalk head.” A little of that attention to arithmetic which
girls are accustomed to devote to their figures, would soon qualify
them for a seat on the highest stool, or a position behind the counter of
a first-rate banking ... whence on returning home the fair
cashier, if musical, might sit down to her piano and sing, “I Know a
Bank” to the no small comfort of her family.
We see also that—
“Vice-CHANCELLort Wood spoke of other occupations for women, and recom-
mended that they should be employed as clerks in post-offices, and as managers of
hotels, as hair-dressers, &c."
Very good. The occupation of hair-dresser in particular is one
peculiarly suitable to young persons of the gentler sex. Their fingers
are much better adapted to the scissors than those of the male fist, and
especially to scissors in relation to the fºllº'. real head of hair
or peruke, whether visible or invisible. , There are cases, however, in
which the customer might be disposed to practise retaliation to the
extent of a curl, on the head of a ministering Belinda, or rather,
erhaps, we may say Barbara, by the leave of Joe Miller. If young
adies very generally take to the hair-dressing line, it may be appre-
hended that the Swells and Nobs, and the Nobs of Swells, wº go
extensively cropped.
Sharp-Shooting Extraordinary.
It is remarkable that, at the late grand Rifle sº Match § |
great numbers of ties were shot off. These will perhaps be conjecture
to be the ties of civilians; as the Rifle Volunteers all wear stocks.

UNFoundED REPORT.-There is no truth in the rumour
that the Pore's Brass Band competed in the Brass Band

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY.9. Monday. “Answer a Norm ANBy according to his Norman-
byism,” is a Solomonionism whereof LoRD BRough AM lost sight
to-night, for he took the trouble to make a wise and earnest reply to
some ridiculous cackle of the old N, directed against GARIBALDI.
BROUGHAM certainly expressed marvellous contempt, both for the
sources of NormanBy’s information and the argument he set tottering
upon it; but some elegant little colloquialism like “Shut up” would
have been the more fitting response to twaddle.
LoRD PALMERSTON had recently informed a deputation of Con-
servatives, who came to him on the Census #. that he should
certainly adhere, to the proposed inquiry as to a person's Religious
Profession. Nobody was therefore surprised, in the present delightful
state of unanimity in the Cabinet, to hear to-night that two days later
Government would state their intentions on #. subject. It should
be mentioned that the Dissenters, being excessively averse to this
return, had been bringing all their influence to bear upon Members in
order to get the provision expunged. MR. CowPER said that he had
no “present intention” of making a road through Kensington Gardens
to join Tyburnia and Belgravia, as desired by the Swells, to whom,
they having horses and carriages, it is of no earthly consequence
whether they have, to make a détour or not, whereas it is of great
consequence to pedestrians that one of the few beautiful walks they
have should not be cut up by a noisy dusty road. Mr. Punch has a
º intention of inflicting a future, whack upon MR. CowPER's
Iob, if he listens to the Nobs on this point. The other alteration, the
giving a better ride to hard-worked gentlemen who take their consti.
tutional gallop in Rotten, Row, will be so agreeable to Mr. Punch
himself, that he §º. it at once, and MR. CowPER need not bother
himself about . EDWIN JAMEs's reclamations on that subject.
The Attorney-GENERAL having m ...}} forgiven the House
for its foolish meddling with his Bankruptcy Bill, proposed to proceed
therewith, with alterations made necessary by the Anti-transfer-of-com-
pensation-from-the-suitors-to-the-consolidated-fund-Vote. But, he pro-
tested against the way in which his Liberal friends snapped at and
impeded the Bill, and declared that, unless confidence were reposed in
him, and he was credited with knowing something about the merits and
operation of a measure to which he had devoted his best energies, there
would be no chance of passing the Bill. After this very reasonable
and temperate remonstrance the Committee went to work, and got on
fairly, though MR. BouvBRIE, “the Prig,” emitted petulance, and
caught a good slash from the ready whip of PALMERStoN, which did
Bouver IE temporary good. Late in the night the Committee stopped
at about the eightieth clause, a heap of Bills were shoved ahead, and
MR. HENNEssy, taking a division on an Irish question, found himself
in a minority of one to seventeen. But we should do that modest
gentleman an injustice if we left, it to be supposed that he considered
that a minority in wisdom, authority, influence, or any other Parlia-
mentary attribute.
Tuesday. In both Houses Ministers stated that orders had been sent
to our naval commanders to interfere for the prevention of further
atrocities in Syria. News arrived, during the week, that they had done
so promptly, at Beyrout. The hostilities of the savage inhabitants of
the country are not, mainly, based on religious hatred, but on enmities
of races, and are fomented b the agents of other nations whose rulers
desire the embarrassment º dismemberment of Turkey. . - -
LoRD RAYNHAM appealed to SIR. G. C. LEWIs to remit a whipping
to which some Hertfordshire criminal had been sentenced, but SIR
GEORGE, havin . into the facts, said that the flagellation had
been ºf, ell deserved. Doctor BRADY wanted a Committee
to inquire into an alleged grievance committed against a Doctor
MAcLough LIN forty years ago, and was duly squashed by the Monster,
MR. SIDNEY HERBERT. There is a Bill before the House for making
the Gas Companies behave with some sort of fairness and honesty, at
which those Companies being naturally indignant, obtained the advo-
cacy of MR. STANILAND, who, as Wiscount WILLIAMs novelly and
beautifully said, tried to throw a little less light upon the subject than
we had before...MR. STANILAND, in a long speech, did his work, so
exceedingly well, that when the public perceives that such capital
management can make no more of the case, the Gas Tyrants will find
their pipes put out. . All the tact in the world will never make people
believe that Companies ought to charge high for bad gas, and then
because they have a monopoly of the supply, ought to insult customers
who remonstrate. A good deal of uncharitableness having been
shown on the Roman Catholic Churches Bill, the Commons rose, after
sitting thirteen hours.
Wednesday. A day of .# to the Dissenters. The Home Secre-
tary, on the fourth clause of the Census Bill, made a speech in which
he showed that in all civilised states it was held desirable to know the
respective proportions of religious sects, that such returns, were
obtained in nearly every European country, in some of our colonies,

and in Ireland, that there was no intention of favouring the Church of
England by untruthfully swelling her numbers, and, that the intended
Census would be damaged and left imperfect by the proposed aban-
donment of the inquiry as to religious profession. But as MR.
BAINEs and the opponents of the inquiry commanded a great many
votes, “were the Masters of Twenty 7. ” was the classical
Home Secretary's classical phrase, he should withdraw the penalty on
the non-return. In order to make things perfectly pleasant, SIR
George added, that the Mahommedans in India, who had formerly
disapproved of a Census, because it involved inquiries into domestic
arrangements, had become enlightened enough to waive that objection,
and to make the return, which showed that “sentimental objections”
might be overcome, and he hoped that some of these days the Dissenters
would be as sensible as the Mahommedans, with which placebo he gave
up the point to which LoRD PALMeRSTON had pledged himself to stick.
His sarcasms, of course, told, especially on those eminent religionists,
MR. BERNAL Osborn E and MR. EDw1N JAMEs, and some other leading
Dissenters, who considered the philosophical Whig's cynical remarks as
extremely ungracious. MR. HENLEY was, and took care to show him-
self, a good deal amused at the Mohammedan hit, and LORD ROBERT
CECIL mentioned, that the Dissenters, on occasion of the last Census,
made false returns, Zoar lending its morning congregation to Ebenezer
for the aſternoon, and Ebenezer and Zoar both joining Ichabod in the
evening, so as to make a good show in the returns, and moreover that
all three stated their habitual congregations at much larger numbers
than could be got into those pleasantly named chapels. A suspicion of
such practice would now, Lord Robert amicably added, attach to the
whole Dissenting body. MR. Whiteside, of course, said that the
Dissenters were afraid of the results of the Census, and Lord PALMER-
ston, having assured the malcontents that SIR GroRGE had not meant
to be uncivil, said for himself, that he yielded out of deference to the
1)issenters' feelings, though he could not assent to their arguments.
So there is rejoicing in Zoar, and in Ebenezer, and in Ichabod, and
in neither, let Mr. Punch add, does he believe that any of the imputed
falsification was or will be resorted to. Himself an eminent Dissenter,
and one who
“Hates most people, and dislikes the rest,"
he can afford to be perfectly impartial. He wishes his beloved
brethren of all sects were more charitable, as it gives him great
trouble to be always ºf: their heads and bringing them into a
proper and kindly frame of mind.
Thursday. The House of Commons having protested, in the Reso-
lutions of last week, upon the subject of the Lords' Rejection of the
Paper-Duty Bill, Lord BROUGHAM took upon himself to set up a
counter-protest, and stated that the House of Lords had a perfect
right to do what it had done. He introduced this, apropos of a little
Jew Bill, for further smoothing the Mosaic pavement of the way into
the House of Commons.
ADMIRAL WAlcott, complaining of the unfinished state of the
Nelson Column, was told by MR. Cowper that SIR Edwin LANDSEER
was engaged on the Lions, and that his attachment to animals and to
the Constitution would doubtless induce him to make first-rate British
Lions. Talking of statuary, when are the railings round CHARLES
PRIMUs coming away, as promised ? Are the directions being reserved
to be given in Cow PER's Winter Morning Walk?
There was a long and curious Foreign Debate, in the course of which
MR. KINGLAke (who is remarkably well informed on foreign matters,
and somehow gets news in advance of the Government) stated that the
EMPEROR of the FRENch had offered the EMPEROR of AUSTRIA to
give him back Lombardy, if he would assent to France's claiming the
Rhenish Provinces. To which the younger Emperor indignantly
replied, “I am a German Prince,” and moreover told the REGENT
of PRussia of the offer. MR. KINGLAke further said that Louis
NApoleoN kept up an agitation in every country of Europe, ready to
The Monster asked for a vote of £3,800,000 for the Chinese War,
but the House was in that cranky humour which one sometimes sees
in crusty benefactors, who will give ſº a £100 note and refuse you a
penny that you wanted to take off the chimney-piece to save getting
change in buying a Queen's-head. MR. HERBERT could get only
£3,356,104, after a debate. But, in the same crankified crustified
spirit, the House gave him the balance, £443,896 the very next evening
after another debate, in which divers persons, not in a very dignifie
manner, sought to throw upon one another the responsibility of the
Chinese war, and others, not in a very patriotic manner, protested
against it altogether. Very late in the night, or shall we say early next
day, LoRD PALMERStoN made a capital fight with some Irishry, who
moved repeated adjournments; but he held out, laughed at them, told
them to “go to bed,” told them, when reduced to 7, to show that there
were Seven Wise Men in the country, and finally, beat, them, and
carried the point he wanted. This was at four o'clock in the morning.
Friday. All the Commons' morning was given to Ireland. In the
evening there was the usual miscellany. An Irish Member declared
life and property to be unsafe in the county of Tyrone, because a
window in a chapel at Cookstown had been broken; but the Govern-
ment declined to send cavalry, infantry, or artillery, and seemed to
think a glazier might deal with the crisis. Notwithstanding that the
House had been saturated with Irish matters, some of the Members
complained that Ireland was neglected, for which, ungrateful untruth

partly based upon what could be done by a Member of that House, not
then present. It was made clear that the Party who was to deliver
over England to the EMPEROR, was MR. John BRIGHT. We are
happy to add that MR. BRIGHT, who was just lighting a remarkably
full-flavoured cigar in the smoking-room, was instantly arrested, and
being taken off to the Westminster Sessions House, was at once tried
by a jury composed one-half of Quakers and the other of officers in
the Guards, and being found guilty, was allowed a quarter-of-an-hour

The blue bonnet of Scotland is now so full of plumes that there is
hardly room in it for another cocktail or eagle's quill. Scotchmen
will doubtless go on winning fresh honours—which they must put in

at—
“If the English Volunteers next year allowed a Scotchman to take the gold
medal, it would be a disgrace to them.”
His Lordship, of course, was joking when he made the remark fore-
going. It can be no disgrace to anybody to be excelled in any branch
of human º: by a chiel who is one of the most highly gifted
children of ADAM—a MAC ADAM, properly called. If a gold medal is
to be won, a Scotchman will certainly do all that he can to win it, and
what is there which cannot be done by a canny Scot?
MR. Ross is a Scotchman not only born but bred. LoRD ELCIIo
distinctly stated that “the youthful Ross had been trained by his
father, the deer-stalker, considerably north of the Tweed.” There is
no doubt on that point: but if MR. Ross had been born south of the
Thames, there is as little question that our Scottish friends would
have claimed him for their countryman, The winner of the QUEEN's
gold medal, for noble marksmanship, will always be a Scotchman.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 23
A REVIVER FOR THE RIVER,
It is Tººl an ill wind
that blows no one any good,
and the same remark applies
to ill weather in general. The
wet time we have had has
sadly tried the temper of our
.."; friends the far-
mers, and market gardeners
too have had their spirits
somewhat damped by it.
Umbrella makers must how-
ever have been benefited,
and the venders of goloshes,
waterproofs, and clogs must,
figuratively speaking, have
made a lot of hay while the
sun has not been shining.
But nowhere has the bad
weather been productive of
more good than in the river,
which last year was in such
an ill condition. Father
Thames looks all the better
for the absence of the sun,
and Mr. Punch begs to con-
gratulate him on his marked
improvement. His face is so
much cleaner for the washing
it has had, that his most
watering places whence they have long been
banished. Carpe diem being the maxim of the
carp, they have come as far as Chiswick and
found nothing to carp at; while dace are so
audacious as to swim close up to Chelsea. Ere
long one may expect to see boys perching upon
ondon Bridge to fish for perch, and to find
that the mud-frontage of the Temple Gardens
has been laid down with ground bait for the
benefit of the benchers. In fact, it would not
much surprise, one if M.P.s, took to fly-fishing
during the debates, or bobbed for eels while
smoking their cigars upon the Terrace.
. To prove indeed how wondrously the river is
improved, Mr. Punch last week went two days
following down to Greenwich, and felt all the
better for his evenings' fishing. Speaking from
experience, Mr. Punch may recommend a trip
to Greenwich, as being the best fishing excursion
that he knows of; and civic Iza Ac WAltons,
who have a relish for his namesake, may be
advised to make it the scene of their aquaticſétes.

The New WINE MEASURE.-The Licensed
Wittlers describe the measure as the Wine

apprehend that it will prove extremely damaging
to their prophets.
TWO YOUNG MEN'S TALES.
EveR, anxious to improve the public mind, Mr. Punch begs to set
before the world a couple of little stories, as told by the parties. prin-
cipally interested. He finds them both in the same number of the
Morning Star, a fact which he mentions, inasmuch as the letter con-
taining the Pleasing Picture is the exclusive property of that journal,
and was called out by a foolish epistle from a maundering banker's.
clerk, who having married on £120 a year, and having children, cannot
enjoy himself very expensively, and therefore thinks that his employer
ought to raise his salary. But in accordance with Mr. Punch's incon-
tº: veneration for the aristocracy, the Painful Picture shall have
the pas.
In the Cambridge Insolvent Court, a few days ago, -
“LoRD WILLIAM Godolph IN Osborn E, son of the DUKE or LEEDs, applied for his
discharge. The total of his debts were stated at £1,066 6s. 11d., of which he stated
£352 to be without consideration. The list of creditors included tailors, tobacco-
nists, a Jew for money lent and interest, a livery stable keeper, and a college tutor.
The insolvent, in examination, stated that he was twenty-five years of age, that
until he came of age his father, the Duke, allowed him only £12 a-year, but since
he had come of age, advanced it to £100 a-year. His chief debts were to the Jew,
contracted whilst he was at the Duke's residence at Gogmagog, near Cambridge,
in 1855 and 1856. He had married in August, 1859, and since then had contracted
no debts. Had no marriage settlement with his wife, and his father refused to
increase his allowance."
Mr. Punch knows nothing of the circumstances of this unpleasant
story except from the published accounts, nor why His Grace of
Leeds has come to the conclusion that it is more to the credit of his
family that, LoRD GoDOLPHIN QSBORNE should go through incarce-
ration and the Insolvent Court for such a sum as £1000 than to pay
the young Lord's debts and give him a chance in married life. If
the matter were not one of public legal record, Mr. Punch, of course,
would never have alluded to it, and the “Own Correspondent” of
§ and American papers need fear no intrusion K. from
piritualists) upon the monopoly of impertinent revelation of private
matters. Mr. Punch completes the story, from the published evidence,
by saying that two witnesses, a tailor and the Jew, were called, who
swore to misrepresentations by the insolvent as to his income, and
as to what he had received from them; and the Jew, as reported, says
that he was promised a hamper of plate, but that iono Godolphin
OsRohne excused himself from getting it on a particular day “as the
butler was in the way.” . Unless this is a typographical error, and the
word “not” is omitted by mistake, one would like to know what
Egyptians our Hebrew thought were to have been spoiled for his
benefit. We take the report, however, as we find it in the Star.
After one LAxton had testified that the said butler had stated that
such plate was non-existent, and also that LoRD GoDolphin Osborne
had “sumptious” breakfasts, which were explained to mean beef.
steaks. The Judge, believing the tailor and the Jew,
“Condemned the conduct of the insolvent, knowing he had but £100 a-year to
indulge in the luxuries mentioned, not to say vices. The insolvent had been con-
tradicted on oath by two witnesses, and he must deal with him as he would with
other persons, and under the penal clause of the Act he directed that he should
be imprisoned for six calendar months from the date of the vesting order.”
So much for the young Lord. Now let us hear a gentleman who
writes to the Star in comment upon the discontented banker's clerk.
We must condense his narrative a good deal, but here are the points.
He writes from the Temple, and signs himself an LL.D.:- -
“At the age of twenty I took a degree in my University, and intended going to
the bar. I had a very good property, but the extravagance and improvidence of
college life, and subsequently a law-suit, reduced it to £40 a-year. felt I must
change my habits. I married and came to London, weak and delicate-I might say
a boy. My young wife, who descended from a superior rank to share the misfor-
tunes of a student, shared his resolution, too. After a few months' anxious searching
I obtained two literary engagements, which brought me in £110 a year—one to be
attended in the morning, the other in the evening. Six miles of London pavement
lay between them. I took a house, as near as I could guess, in the centre of my field
of operations, and for three years, through rain and snow, and scorching sun, I
walked twelve miles a day (except Sunday) and studied forty hours a week besides."
He then describes his tiny but comfortable house at £15 a year, and
proceeds:—
“My wife, who had her waiting-maid to the hour of her clandestine marriage,
would not hear of a servant. She never charred, except secretly perhaps (it was
the only cause of dispute between us), but she washed, and smoothed, and dusted,
and marketed, and cooked to perfection. A short time elapsed, and I became a
student in the Temple. I never expended more than £10 a-year in clothing myself,
and yet I appeared amongst gentlemen at commons rather respectably."
He did not want the doctor, happily, thanks to exercise, and early
rising, but, “always fed well, on the best meat-the toiling mind
requires it.” Quite true—he should see Mr. Punch's bills for venison
and turtle.
“In the second year, I had purchased sufficient choice furniture for a parlour and
bedroom ; and, above all, a select library. The third year came, and the third
story. I was barrister-at-law. *; seclusion ended, and so shall my chapter; only
you are authorised to tell ‘G. A. P.” (the maundering clerk), that in this arduous
struggle I never received a farthing gratuity from friend or relative, and always
had a pound to spend when the accidents of my position rendered a little harmless
amusement necessary.”
There is the companion F. and Mr. Punch, whose incessant
aim is at once to delight and to instruct, presents the two illustrations
of a young English gentleman's life, for the study of mankind in
eneral. He would add that if Mrs. L. L. D. (to whom he presents
is heartiest and most admiring compliments) has any sisters, several
of his best Young Men would ń. profoundly obliged by an invitation
to tea.

declares to be the key stone of the arch of the American Constitution.
He showed, successively and successfully, that the “Domestic Insti-
tution” makes brutes of the slaves, and worse brutes of the masters
—that it checks education, industry, prosperity, and population—that
it generates violence, foul vice, cruelty, duelling, and ruffianism
generally—that its advocates in and out of Congress are the worst
citizens and the worst men in America—that it has been condemned
by WAshingtoN, JEFFERson, and FRANKLIN, and by all States-
men and Moralists of eminence—and that its poisonous influence is
actively working towards the destruction of the noble Republic. MR.
SUMNER's speech was chiefly characterised by its closeness of argu-
ment and lucidity of diction, but he occasionally introduced a passage
of highly wrought eloquence, or an image of singular vividness; and
in England, however the orator's sentiments might have been objected
to by a political antagonist, MR. SUMNER would have received the
compliments of gentlemen on both sides, upon so remarkable an exhi-
bition of sustained power and intellectual skill.
MR. CHESTNUT, of South Carolina (Slave-owner), rose, and after
abusing MR. SUMNER for “ranging over Europe, crawling through
the back doors to whine at the feet of British aristocracy, craving
pity and reaping contempt,” called him the “incarnation of malice,
mendacity, and cowardice,” and declined, on the part of Slave.

forth the recipient of Punishment howling through the world, yelping
fresh cries of slander and malice.” The punishment in question alludes
to the brutal assault with a bludgeon, committed by the now defunct
BRooks upon an unarmed and unsuspecting gentleman. The “Slave-
masters in the Senate then surrounded MR. CHESTNUT, and approved
his speech.” The question was postponed.

Mr. Punch begs to offer his respectful congratulations to MR.
SUMNER upon his magnificent speech, and, even more earnestly, upon
the ample and perfect testimony that was instantly given, by the
besotted Slave-owners, to the truth of his assertion of the Barbarism
of Slavery. It is not often that an orator's enemies are in such a
desperate hurry to prove his case for him. But here he was scarcely
own when the Slave-party rushed together to proclaim themselves
the ruffians he had painted them, and in the published copy of the
oration, MR. SUMNER has given at once the calmest and the 3. ii.
blow to the system he denounces—for he prints MR. CHESTNUT's
speech. All the bludgeons in the hands of all the “chivalry of the
South” cannot beat that demonstration of MR. SUMNER's case out of
the heads of the public in and out of the States. The speech should
be reprinted in England, and circulated in thousands. What is the

FORGETFULNESS CURED BY SMELLING.
A PERFUMER advertises a scent under the name of “Hungary
Water,” as possessing the peculiar property of improving the memory.
That an odoriferous, compound may serve to correct corporeal exha-
lations is conceivable, but there is some difficulty in understanding
how it can possibly effect the improvement of an intellectual faculty.
A pinch of snuff, however, will stimulate the power of recollection;
and those who are up to snuff may not unreasonably hope to refresh
their memories as well as their nostrils by sniffing Hungary Water.
This fluid, if it really possesses the mnemonic virtue ascribed to it, may
be recommended to laundresses, who, by sprinkling therewith the
linen which they send home to fashionableiadies may, perhaps, induce
some of their förgetful customers to remember the poor washerwoman
—that is, her . A bottle of Hungary Water may be a suitable
offering for presentation to an oblivious lover, and would convey an
intimation more delicate than the broad hint expressed by a bunch of
forget-me-nots.
Gentlemen who are apt to forget small commissions or necessar
purchases might do better to scent their pocket handkerchiefs wit
Hungary Water than to tie knots in them. If the House of Commons
were purified with Hungary Water, members might recollect their
pledges. Candidates for situations in the Civil Service, under com-
petitive examination, might, by smelling hard at a flask of Hungary
Water, manage to recollect the cram which they had forgotten, and
thus be enabled to spell some words in the orthography of which

CHAPTER XXIII.-ALL ABOUT ARMS AND ARMOUR.
O much fighting occurred
throughout the thirteenth
century, that the army tailors
must have had a roaring time
of it, like the man who has
to superintend the feeding of
wild beasts. We are told
indeed that changes were
continually taking place in
the military equipment, an
assertion which appears to us
quite easy of belief, seeing it
º nowadays be echoed
with great truth. Perhaps
of all the armour the helmet
was the part, which under-
went most variation. During
John's time it was made cy-
lindric and flat-topped, and
covered up the head no lower
than the ears, the face being
protected "... aventaille,
or grating. In the next reign,
however, it enveloped the
whole head, and rested on the
shoulders; and seeing that it
bulged out like a barrel at
the sides, there seems to
have been fair reason for
calling it a casque. This
reat helmet was made still more cumbrous and conspicuous, by
ing commonly surmounted with the wearer's knightly crest; which,
although intended to be a decoration, proved, nine times out often, to be
rather a disfigurement. Indeed the only reasonable reason we can think
of why these (so thought) ornaments should have been adopted is that
they seem to have made the helmet look still more like a barrel, by
ºn a projection like a #: Or a º: Fº who complain that
their †: give them a headache may thank their lucky stars that they
were born in the nineteenth, and not the thirteenth century; for we
read that these big headpieces were sometimes twisted round so by a
lance-stroke in a tournament that their unhappy, wearers, had to gasp
out to their squires to come and lend a hand to twist their turned
heads back again.
In the reign of Edward THE FIRST the barrel-shaped helmet con-
tinued still in use, although some slight attempts were made to knock
it on the head, and substitute a somewhat lighter kind of skull-cover.
Helmets inclining to a cone at the top are visible in some of the illu;
minated manuscripts; surmounted in some cases with a small round
knob, and, when seen in profile, showing, an angular beaked front.
Simple plates of steel, convex and cut with breathing holes, were worn

sometimes tied round the head in lieu of helmets; and skullcaps called
chapels de fer, with nasals and without, were used by archers and
esquires and common men at arms, who although perhaps º thought
no small beer of themselves were too poor to come out in barrel-helmets,
or in casques. - - -
Whether the knights were in these days more thin-skinned than they
had been is a point which we must leave to antiquarians to settle. But
it appears that padded armour came much more, into use, and this
seems to us to argue a tenderness of cuticle. Quiltings of cloth and
silk, of buckram and of leather are spoken of as coming into fashion at
this period, and the peculiar pointed work with which they were em-
broidered obtained for them the names of “counterpoint” and “pour-
oint.”. A complete suit, consisting of a sleeved tunic and chaussés
a kind of Norman cross between a legging and a stocking) was
worn not infrequently underneath the surcoat, which was considerably
lengthened in the reign of HENRY THE THIRD, and was first emblazoned
with the arms of the wearer. We suppose that this emblazonment was
either done for decoration, or else to mark the garment when going to
the wash; in which latter case we fancy that the farce of How to Settle
Accounts with your Laundress must have now and then occasioned some
ludicrous mistakes. We can imagine the disgust of the doughty EARL
of GooseBURIE at finding LoRD DE LACKshy RTE's surcoat sent him
for his own: his washerwoman possibly attempting to excuse herself
on the ground that the three geese portrayed on the Earl's shield
had been “mistuk” for the three griffins which adorned the other
garment.
FROM THE FRONTISpiro E to THE old MEthical, Romance or “Yr EARLE AND
YE WAslı kit woman's DAUGHTER." DATE A.D. 1260.
The old flat-ringed form of armour having gone quite out of fashion,
that made of rings worn edge-ways was worn mostly at this period.
A new species, however, was introduced from Asia in the reign of
HENRY THE THIRD, and as ariºus moriatiºt gent militaris we find
that this new sort was very generally sought after. Not being made
of chain, it was, doubtless, called chain-mail, from the same cause that
the lucus is so termed a non lucendo. Consisting of four rings linked
together by a fifth, it might not inaptly have been named link-mail,
but that its wearers might have possibly been chaffed for being link:
men. The rings were riveted together so as to form a perfect garment
of themselves, without requiring, like the scale-mail, a leathern lining
or foundation. The chain-mail generally was worn in the shape of a
loose shirt, between the gambeson and surcoat; and in one respect
it clearly must have been superior in comfort to our shirts, for it cer-
tainly could never have been sent home with a button off.
Small plates of steel were worn upon the shoulders and the knees,
and likewise on the elbows, to protect them from those nasty knocks
upon the funny-bone which make recipients laugh upon the wrong
side of their mouth. On the shoulders, too, were worn a curious
kind of ornament called ailettes, or little wings, which came first into
fashion in the last years of the reign of KING Edward THE FIRST.
As far as we can judge from the drawings of them extant, these
ailettes could have been of neither use nor beauty; and as their name
indicates a #. to fly, they must have been misplaced upon the
shoulders of our soldiers.
The lance lost its gonfanon, or streamer, in this reign; and the
pennon was adopted as a military ensign, being charged with the
crest, or badge, or warcry of its knightly owner. The pennon, like
the gonſanon, was swallowtailed in shape, but in breadth as well as
length it was made much bigger. In addition, the swell knights had
their, banners borne before them, parallelograms in form and embla-
zoned with their arms, as were their cyclas and their quintis, and other
night-gown looking, overcoats...They swaddled up, their steeds, too
in horsecloths similarly beautified, or else adorned with quaint and
fanciful devices; so that their nags looked like the hobby-horses used

from their petticoats.
Every schoolboy knows that our first Edward was called “Long-
shanks” from his long and slender legs, which he attenuated and
stretched by constant chevying of his ene-
mies.” Equally well known, of course, is
the story of his being stabbed when a
rusader, and of how QUEEN ELEANOR,
coming to his succour, sucked the poison
from his wound. His warrings with the
Welsh cannot less be in remembrance, as
we are all now thinking of our PRINCE OF
WALEs; and it was by Edward's sword
that the title was first gained for us. Nor
can his battles with brave WILLIAM WAL-
LACE be forgotten by those who have had
the Tales of My Grandfather retailed to
them, or have learnt of DR. GoLDSMITH
from the fear of DR. BIRCh. To readers,
then, with all these recollections fresh
before them, we need not say that this was
a most pugnacious period; nor shall we
much surprise them if we state, that not
less various than the armour were the arms
of it. The shield in some cases was flat,
and triangular, or heater-shaped, and in
others pear-shaped, and in surface more
cylindric: while to the ... of offence
there were added now the falchion, a sword
with a broad blade, the estoc, a sword
much smaller, chiefly used for stabbing,
the coutel or cultelas, whence our modern
“cutlass,” and the anelace, or anelas, a
broad dagger which tapered down to a fine
oint, and “not to put too fine a point on
it,” would do for any lad or any lass whom
it was dabbed into. Besides these imple-
ments of manslaughter there was a sort of
a small pickaxe called martel-de-fer, which
was used to break the links and plates of
mail, and make way for a sword-cut, or a
lance-thrust or a dagger-poke. The mace
lso appears first in the drawings of this period, though it, was
doubtless introduced in the earlier crusades, as it is quite clearly.9f
oriental origin. This opinion is borne out º the MS. of the Talis-
man, in which SALADIN is described as being knocked off his horse by
SIR. KENNETH's weighty mace: and another less known writer, in
his account of how the English were mustered by KING RICHARD for
the assault of Ascalon, speaks of somebody or other “giving pepper
with his mace,” a description which we must allow is rather spicy.

THE BERKELEY PEERAGE CASE.
BY OUR SPECIAL REPORTER.
SCENE–The House of Lords last week. Present the CHANCELLOR,
Lords REDesDALE, BRough AM, KINGsdown, MR. FLEMING, the
Attorney-GENERAL, and other great lawyers.
Lord Brougham. Well, now, MR. FLEMING, you want us to declare that
ADMIRAL SiR MAURICE BERKELEY is a Baron. But you make him
out such a rum kind of Baron. I don't see our way.
Lord Kingsdown. You might as well call him a Baron of Beef.
Mr. Fleming. Well, my Lord, there was a Baron Front de Boeuf.
The Attorney. General. I must remind my learned friend that Front
de Boeuf was only a hero of fiction. -
Lord Redesdale. You say SIR MAURICE is entitled, because he has
got Berkeley Castle. That seems a barren claim to a barony.
Mr Fleming. My Lord, it’s in the most fertile part of Gloucester.
The Chancellor. Nevertheless, the claim’s not the cheese.
Mr. Fleming. One of our kings was murdered in that Castle, my
Lords, and— -
Lord Kingsdown. We are not throwing Edward THE SEcond into
your respectable client's face, MR, FLEMING. We acquit him of all
share in that transaction. But, on the other hand, we do not think that
it gives him a claim to a peerage.
§. Fleming. The Castle was taken by OLIVER CROMWELL–
Lord Redesdale. That is important. Was it taken on a lease or an
agreement? -
The Attorney-General. Taken, I apprehend my learned friend to mean,
as a castle is taken at chess, that is to say, captured, if I make myself
intelligible to my LoRD REDEsdale.
Lord Redesdale. Qh Ah!
Lord Brougham. But if the Admiral means to say he helped in that
affair, he may tell that to his, Marines. I am sure the Attorney-
GENERAL will not admit that what was done on the 21st of September,
1645, could have been performed, in part or in whole, by an elderly,
irascible, and naufrageous ſº. extant in the year of grace 1860.
The Attorney-General. I form no opinion on the point, one way or the
other, my Lord. Let my learned friend prove his case.
Lord Brougham. Why, the old boy would be 275 years old, if he
joined CROMWELL at 20.
The Attorney-General. Nor can I undertake to assert whether your
Lordship's estimate approximates to accuracy. Let my learned friend
prove his case. -
Mr. Fleming., I, mean to. . See here. It is perfectly ridiculous to
talk of a Castle being without a Baron, I never heard such nonsense.
You might as well talk of a Castle without a Donjon, or a Partisan, or
a Keep, or a Portfolio.
Lord Kingsdown. Do you mean a Portcullis P
The Attorney-General. I must protest against your Lordships helpin
# º friend with his curious assemblage of architectural .#
1Snments.
Lord Brougham. Have there been machicollations at the Castle, MR.
FLEMING !
Mr. Fleming. My Lord, I am not precisely informed ; but the
BERKELEYs have been always the souls of hospitality, and I make no
doubt that there have been all possible kinds of collations.
The Chancellor. So far so good. Now, MR, FLEMING, be kind
enough to state, as shortly as is consistent with biographical candour,
the personal history of all the BERKELEYs who have lived since the
building of the Castle by HENRY THE FIRST in the year 1108.
Lord Brougham. I am not quite satisfied with that direction. Why
did HENRY the FIRST build the Castle in 1108 °
. The Attorney-General. That in 1860 my learned friend might take
his stand upon it.
Mr. Fleming...You have no right to say so. I never stood on a
Castle in my life. I don't like heights; they make me giddy, espe-
º if I* bilious. I always get a queer feeling that I should like
O Jump off.
}}Kingsdown. I have felt that. It is very odd.
Lord Brougham. So have I.
Lord Redesdale. You should hunt more, Fº fellows, and then you
wouldn't be bilious. y the way, talking of hunting, SIR RICHARD,
that's a capital nag of yours. i saw him in Palace Yard. If you
think of parting wit him at any time, give us the refusal.
Lord Campbell. He's just the thing for an ATToRNEY-GENERAL, but
he has too much go in him for a CHANcellor.
The Attorney-General. Your Lordship (smiling) has felicitously indi-
cated the circumstances under which I shall be happy to recall this
pleasant conversation to my LoRD REDEsdale's recollection.
Mr. Fleming. The founder of the House of BERKELEY—
Lord Brongham. He must have been a brass founder, to judge by
the cheekiness of his descendants.
The Attorney-General. I am not admitting any descent, mind, my
Lords. Let my learned friend prove his case.
The Chancellor. Another time, MR. FLEMING, please. We have
made very good, progress to-day, and we must not hurry. ADMIRAL
BERKELEY has lived for sixty years, and more, without a peerage, so
he can wait a little longer, and we can’t.
The case was then adjourned.
EUPHEMISM UNCOMMON.
A FoREIGN Correspondent of a contemporary begins his letter as
follows:–
“The plot thickens at Naples. We shall soon too, probably, hear of a sanguinary
outburst."
Good phrases are, and ever were, commendable, as Justice Shallow
remarks., “A sanguinary outburst” is one of those phrases. “Out-
burst,” that is to say, in popular phraseology, row, That is the
expression which a costermonger would have used in the above con-
nection. . The itinerant vegetable-merchant certainly would not have
employed the substantive “outburst,” and the adjective which, he
would have adjoined to it would have been more Saxon than
Sangulnary.

THE WOLUNTEER ON JULY 14th,
You must wake and call me early, when the early birds appear,
To-morrow will be a glorious day for each London Volunteer:
For each London Wolunteer by far the hottest, heaviest day—
For we’re to sham-fight at Chiselhurst, four thousand strong, they say.
There’s many a crack, crack corps I know, but none so crack as mine,
There’s the Queen's and Artillery Company, almost equal to the Line,
But none can beat our local corps, whether red, or green, or grey,
And so we shall prove at Chiselhurst in to-morrow's tremendous fray.
I sleep so sound after evening drill, that I shall never wake,
If the maid doesn’t knock extremely loud when my boots she comes to
take;
And you’ll have to cut me some sandwiches, and cut them sub-
stantial, pray—
We shall all have desp'rate appetites at Chiselhurst, I dare say.
As I came up to our private parade, whom think ye I should see,
But that ass, SMIVENs—a coming it as cheeky as could be:
He gave a look at my uniform, as if he meant to say:
“How can you make such a guy of yourself, old chap, at your time of
day?”
He thought I should be offended, but I guess I sold him quite;
For I passed, and no more gave him a look than if he’d been out of
sight;
You may tell me it’s snobbish to cut a man, but this is what I say:
That the chap who don't join a Volunteer Corps has thrown his man-
hood away.
They say we shall fire thirty rounds, I don't know how that may be;
I've not fired more than ten rounds yet, and that was enough for me.
For what with biting the cartridges, and what with blazing away,
I’d a taste in my mouth, and a buzz in my ears, for all the rest of
the day.
LORD RANELAGH as Commander-in-Chief to-morrow will be seen,
And as his uniform is grey, let us hope he won't turn out green;
I trust he'll remember which is attack, and which is defence, in the
fray,
Or we certainly shall have a difficulty about who is to give way.
The War-Office has issued no end of rounds and caps;
I hope there’ll be surgeons enough on the ground, in case of little
mishaps.
For novices have a habit—at least so veterans say—
When they get a little excited, of firing their ramrods away.
Detachments through the streets and squares to their firing practice
pass
And in Regent's Park and on Putney Heath spent cartridges dot the
grass:
And there's a sulphury, choky, smell of gunpowder hangs all day
In the suburbs, that quite overpowers the breath of the new-mown
hay.
And then when we've done our fighting, our empty stomachs to fill,
There’s to be GRANT's cooking-waggon, to find dinner for all who
will:
And the moderate sum of two shillings is all one will have to pay,
Which, considering what we’re likely to eat, is a trifle, I must say.
So you must wake and call me early, when the early birds appear,
To-morrow's to be a glorious day for each London Volunteer:
For each London Wolunteer about the hottest heaviest day—
For we’ve to fight at Chiselhurst, four thousand strong, they say!

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 16. Monday. It is an unwise thing to give offence to a clever
man. One of these days you are sure to feel the evil consequences of
your imprudence. Especially if he be not only a clever but a good
man, and a professed philanthropist. For though, of course, so far as
he is personally concerned, he freely and fully forgives you, we being
all bound to forgive one another, he is much too conscientious to let
his own amiable feelings render him negligent of the duty he owes to
society. To have wronged a worthy person argues that you are an
unworthy person, and therefore Mr. Worthy, who finds the power of
chastising you entrusted to him, doubtless for a good purpose, dares
not let you escape uncastigated. And then a good man and a profound
philanthropist has such a strong impression made upon his mind by
your naughtiness, from its being so startlingly unlike his own conduct,
that your misdeeds are never out of his memory. You are sure to
catch it, one day or other, perhaps when }. have quite succeeded in
forgiving yourself, and forgetting the whole business. Mr. Punch
repeats it—never give offence to a good and clever man.
The Publicans and Spirit-dealers should have thought of this maxim
when they were so offensively rude to MR. GLAT ston E about the Wine
Licences Bill, and when they exerted themselves to the utmost of their
ability to embarrass the Cabinet during the Budget debates. They
were very brutal, but Mr. Worthy bore their onslaughts with so sweet
a smile, and pleaded with them so elaborately and P. that
though he beat, them thoroughly, the Bungs could not suppose he
preserved resentment. He carried his Wine Licences system, and
every cabman now takes his La Rose and Lafitte, and swears furiously
if the bouquet be wanting in the wine. And the CHANCELLOR or THE
Exchequer put away wrong on the shelf to cool, quite sure that
he could warm it up again at the shortest notice. The chance came, as
it always will come if we wait for it, and watch; and it so º:
that England wanted a little more than a Million of money to help to
make up the small amount needed for the Chinese War. “Bless me,”
says MR. GLADston E, “a million ? Dear, dear, that is a considerable
sum. But it must be raised, and we must try to make the business as
easy as possible for the people. Nay, we must endeavour to make it a
boon to them. What a bad habit it is, that of drinking Spirits.
Suppose we discourage it as far as possible. Do you know that if a

corner, and brought by the waiter, and requesting that “the gentleman,
with whose name the writer had not the honour of being acquainted,
would kindly advance º: to make up a shilling to enable the
writer to obtain a glass of brandy-and-water.”, MR,GLADSTONE is a
statesman of resources, and he riz the amount with singular ease.
Part he borrowed from the balances in the Exchequer, stating that on
the whole it was really an advantageous thing that they should be so
employed—and whence, do }. think, he got the rest? Why, from
the Paper Duty, which he had proposed to take off, and which the
Lords, insisted on his keeping on. Thus do great chemists extract
medicines from poisonous herbs. Thus does MR. GLADSTONE, like the
old Admiral in the song, put his Pigtails in Paper. Thus does
the British Press become (a trifle indirectly) the means of sending
Civilisation through China.
“Its voice is heard ºf: rolling drums
That beat for fight where ELGIN stands,
Its force comes down in Armstrong bombs,
And gives the battle to his hands.”
The business thus described was the principal work of Monday, but
among smaller matters of note were an intimation that we are not to
have the Bronze Pennies till the end of September—a stern protest
against the Chinese War by MR. RoºBuck, and a rather neat justifica:
tion of it by MR. GLADstoNE, who had himself sternly protested against
it a short time ago, but who now urged that however objectionable the
original war might be, we had a right to fight for a ratification of the
treaty of peace—and an endeavour b R. NewDEGATE to get the
debates, closed at one o'clock at night. This attempt, was, warmly
opposed by LoRD PALMERSTON, who quoted Tom MooRE's allegation,

that the best of all ways to lengthen our days is to steal a few hours
from the night, my dear, and who is as * and full of work at four in
the morning as at eight in the evening. The PREMIER is one of the
men described by MR. DisrAELI in Tancred, who contemn the vul-
garian that begins to yawn, for his plebeian night-cap at eleven
o'clock. They used in the old days, “to finish a debate, when once in
it, like Gentlemen, who had been accustomed to be up all night, and
º * sup at WATIER’s.” New DEGATE's notion was knocked
On the nob.
Tuesday. LoRD BROUGHAM displayed an amount of ignorance with
which Mr. Punch did not credit him. Complaining of the time wasted
in debate in the House of Commons, he said that it had remembered
its original etymology, and become a House of Talk, a Parliamentum.
The Lords laughed as ignorantly as the speaker spoke. They may be
forgiven, Mr. Punch is never hard upon the uneducated classes, washed
or unwashed, but he knows that BRough AM reads his Punch, and there-
fore the latter wonders how the former can have forgotten the real
derivation of the word Parliament. Does he not know that it is from
two French verbs, parler and mentir "
The Commons were more active in an anti-educational demonstration.
There was a Bill for making it compulsory on the employers of the
labour of children under twelve years old, to have a certificate that the
child was learning to read and write, and had twenty hours of teaching
per month—nothing like an hour a day. But so monstrous an Innova.
tion frightened the House. MR. HENLEY was pious, and said that
people were not to eat unless they worked, but were not commanded to
read and write; MR. Buxton was humane, and said there were
thousands of children too idle, wicked, or stupid to learn, and their
vested rights were not to be interfered with ; MR. HARDY took the old
Tory view, and said that the children of the poor were taught quite
enough to enable them to do the duties they were intended for; and MR.
BAINes, as a Dissenter, declared the Bill to be needless, and that the
work of education was going on admirably. Yielding to these irre-
sistible arguments, the Bill was thrown out, a majority of 122 to 51
deciding that the children of the English poor want no assistance in
the battle with the World, the Flesh, and the First Whig. In a second
educational debate, more sense was exhibited, the House refusing to
disturb the system of national teaching in ireland, as demanded by
certain ultra-Protestants, who wish to force the Bible into the schools,
whereby the Catholic children would be forced out. Mr. Lºrno, gave
the highest praise to the F. system, in saying that it was not satis-
factory to the clergy of Ireland. . If it. did please the “perspiring
º: 22 Flo do the firebrand business, it would certainly not please
r. fººt/tch.
LoRD FERMoy then tried to get up another Shindy on the Paper
Duty question, but whether he did it to please the lower class of his
Marylebone constituents, or, as we hope and believe, only from a high-
mettled Irishman's noble love of combat, did not exactly appear. Lord
PALMERSTON said that the question was settled, and he would have no
such nonsense, and MR. GLADSTONE, prayed to help in the fray,
declined being party to any new demonstration. There was a ſº:
smart firing on both sides, and MR. DisrAELI wanted Lond PALMER-
ston to take a vote directly hostile to the other Irish nobleman. PAM
would not do this, but carried the Previous Question by 177 to 138.
h'ednesday. The Moon moved and carried a Resolution that the Sun
was unworthy of the confidence of the Earth, and followed up her
motion by moving herself into a place directly between the l,
parties. People threw up their eyes a good deal at the Moon's motion,
and things were beginning to look rather dark, when the Moon thought
better of it, and slunk out of the way. Many observations were made,
but as it is understood that such a thing is not likely to occur again in
a hurry, it is not necessary to be harsh in comment upon what really
seemed an act of Lunacy. It naturally set the House of Commons
thinking of Gas, and the Bill for dealing with the Gas-Tyrants went
through Committee, much hindered, but finally successful.
Thursday. LoRD DERBY made a long speech in which he pointed out
that the House of Lords was really of no use for legislative purposes.
This was the fault, of the House of Commons, which wasted such
oceans of time in gabble that there was no getting Bills up to the Lords
in any decent time. He thqught that the best way would be, not as at
present to make every Bill die with the Session, but to let the Lords,
on re-assembling after prorogation, take up any Bills to whose principles
they had assented. LoRD REDEsdale thought that the fewer Bills
that were passed the better, but this rather off-hand way of treating the
subject was not admired, and— the question is to be considered.
In the Commons a melancholy proof was given of the truth of Lord
DERBY’s accusation against the Commons. The only valuable measure
of the Session, the Bankruptcy Bill, so vehemently demanded by
the mercantile world, that is to say England, was thrown up by
the ATToRNEY-GENERAL, in despair of being able to force it through the
forest of gabble that stood between it and the Lords. Mr. Punch
tenders to the learned parent of the deceased measure his warmest
acknowledgments of the labour and skill that produced the Bill, and
tter | 1
*-
the energy with which he fought it, and hopes that he (Mr. Punch)
may next year have the pleasure of exhibiting an immortal Cartoon, of
a classical and allegorical character, and with this title: “The hero
BETHELL, having, delivered Fair, Commerce from the Monster, Öid
Bankruptcy, confides her to the keeping of the twin tutelary deities,
Equity and Economy.” -
An Indian Debate, which, singularly, though personal was unin-
teresting, was followed by a long drawn and on some points just
grumble by CHARLEY NAPIER about defects in the management of
Greenwich Hospital. A good deal in the improving way might be
done, but when CHARLEY states that the Government make the Sea-
men at Greenwich as miserable as they can, Mr. Punch must say that,
judging by observations made by himself (while getting up his appetite
for the benefit of one Q, or one H) on the demeanour of the old Salts,
the allegation, if true, proclaims the Government to be singularly
unsuccessful.
Friday. LoRD LUCAN, of Crimean Blunder celebrity, took an ºppºr:
tunity of informing the Lords that he had “a very good memory.” S
have the public and the army, and Lok D LUCAN's memory is better
than his judgment, or he would not willingly intrude upon the world
his noble name, associated as it is with the recollections of disaster
caused by aristocratic imbecility.
The Government had the pleasure of receiving another defeat. MR.
GLADston E’s Savings Banks Bill was opposed, and its principal clause
was rejected by 116 to 78, whereupon the CHANCELLOR or The
withdrew the measure. “Third smash of the week,” said the PREMIER,
laughing,
“Tria sunt, verb, quae me faciunt flere.”
LoRD John Russelſ, stated that we should at present interfere in
Syria only to the extent of placing ships on the coast, but that France
was proposing more vigorous action, and the subject was under con-
sideration. The Queen's Printer is to retain his patent for printing
the Bible. . There was a renewal of the personal Indian debate of the
º night, SIR. C. Wood, MR. HoRsMAN, and Lord PALMERston
eing the speakers, and another proof was afforded of the great advan-
tage which is afforded to a person who has gone wrong should his censor
forget his manners, or lose his temper. With an angry opponent
and a judicious friend one only wants a little tact to shift the whole
ground, and actually hand the party with a grievance into the dock,
instead of the party originally accused. This was very neatly done by
SIR C. Wood and Lord PALMERSTON, and MR. Horis MAN, who had
really a case about some juggling with documents, was terribly scolded,
and made to appear to the House as anything but a generous personage.
But JUPITER PUNCH, who sits “high throned all height above,” sees
º all the dodgery, and hereby hits CHARLEs Wood a rap on the
16a (1.
Then came a diverting speech from Edwin JAMEs about the diversion
of the ride in Kensington Gardens. The fact is that such crowds
come to gaze delightedly on Mr. Punch, as he rides in the Row, that
MR. CowPER thought more accommodation was required. But Mr.
Punch, although he is happy to exhibit himself to his fellow citizens,
and finds the alteration a great accommodation to himself, has no idea
of frightening away the ladies from the Gardens by the tremendous
cavalcade that gallops after him (like the Thousand Knights at Ivry
behind the Snow white Crest,) the moment he shows himself, and there-
fore, on the whole, he proposes to Cow PER to put the affair in statu
110.
If all the Irish gentlemen resembled MR. Cog AN, who made,
to-night, a most temperate and proper appeal on the subject of Orange
Processions, Ireland would give Mr. Punch much less trouble. He
was, of course, and as is de rigueur in Irish debates, answered with a
tu quoque by the Orange party, but his speech produced an excellent
effect on the House. The introduction of a Bill for continuing the
Corrupt Practices Act finished the week. A sort of Committee on the
same subject had been sitting at York, and at the termination of its
work, M.R. LeATHAM, recently elected for and ejected from Wakefield,
was declared to be Guilty of Bribery—the occasion for such declaration
being York Assizes. Wae victis /
AN ANGLO-AMERICAN CONGRESS.
Noble old BRough AM, at one of the late meetings of the Congress
which has been held at Somerset House, expressed a fear that he had
given offence to MR. DALLAs and the United States by calling “the
attention of the American Ambassador to the fact—and he thought it
was a very interesting fact—that a highly respectable coloured gentle-
man, MR. DELANY, from Canada, was one of the assembled members
of the International Statistical Congress.” The noble and learned
º entertained a groundless apprehension, , MR. DALLAs
was too glad to be reminded of a fact which he could quote for the
instruction of the barbarous part of his countrymen, and they no more
care, about being twitted on the subject of slavery than Thugs would
mind being “chaffed” about murder.

the

(if he may use two

the “cynosure of en-

“observed of all ob-

it was, they showed
their judgment, Mr.
Punch will frankly
own, in fallowing
MEssIEURs PAUL to
take away that
ºf honour; for, joking
quite apart, their
roses were so big as
to be almost appalling. Mr. Punch indeed half fancied that some fairy had transported him
to the land of Brobdingnagia, so gigantic were the specimens these gentlemen exhibited; and
his surmise was somewhat strengthened by the roses that were shown and gained a prize for
MR. HEDGE, which were the very largest Hedge-roses that Mr. Punch had ever had the
happiness of sniffing at. Besides the rows of roses, there were heaps of ferns and heaths,

With the march across the hay-fields, and the skirmish in the copse,
And every flask had long been drained down to its latest drops.
Yet not a grumbler in the corps, a laggard in the train,
As hopefully we marched towards the longed-for cooking-wain;
The bivouac upon the plan stood plain to every eye;
We longed for pots of beer so—we were so very dry!
We came to “Bivouac No. 1,” and nothing could we see,
But a tent set, bare of victuals and drink, beneath a tree:
We thought at “Bivouac No. 2,” to find the tap we craved,
But “Number 2,” like “Number 1* repulsively behaved
Upon those'porter-barrels, and those pork-pies of ours,
The spectators had descended as keen as locust-showers;
They had cleared off every remnant of victuals from the hill,
And entirely floored our liquors while we were fighting still.

and hosts of hothouse plants, which though they
all had gone to pot, looked not a whit the worse
for it. fact, as the poet might have said if he
had seen them,-
“Flora gave her fairest flowers,
None more rare in all her treasure:
Which being placed in Floral bowers,
Punch was pleased beyond all measure.”
Several of these plants had remarkably fine
names, and looked quite fine enough to justify
them. Their rich colours were however some-
what thrown into the shade, being washed out
by the flood of rose-light which was shed on
them. Indeed, Mr. Punch might have passed
them without notice, had not his attention been
attracted by a Wretch, who tried to pun about
two cacti being like an exotic fruit, because it
was quite patent that they were a prickly pair.
Blest as he is with affluence and with every
blissful comfort that can make home happy, Mr.
Punch's disposition is not naturally covetous.
But there certainly are times when a sensation
takes possession of him, which makes him feel
that there is something wanting to his happiness,
and which something, if secured, would yield him
erfect bliss. This feeling Mr. Punch felt at the
"loral Hall, when he looked at the Great Bed of
roses in the centre, which in its vastness bore
resemblance to the Great Bed of Ware. The
instant that his eye first rested on this bed,
Mr. Punch felt a longing to rest his head and
shoulders on it; and only the reflection that he
was close to Bow Street prevented him from
jumping slap into the bed, and calling out to
somebody to come and tuck him up ! Mr.
Punch, of course, had often seen a rose-bed
before, but he had never seen a rose-bed which
so tempted one to sleep upon it, secure from
molestation even by its thorns. To lie on such
arose-bed, to sip a sherry-cobler, and be squirted
at with rosewater, the while MARIo and GRISI
sweetly sang one off to sleep; such bliss a man
would pay a double Income-Tax to dream of, and
Mr. Punch felt sadly tempted to envy MR. Gye,
who had it in his power, if he pleased so, to
en-Gye it.
And from the heights of Chiselhurst the night-wind set in cool,
And ‘. feelings tow’rds LoRD RANELAGH weren't pleasant, as a
But the best of a bad bargain was all that could be made;
So to our hungry bellies we the flattering unction laid,
That some kind tap might chance to lie on in the way that we should
pass,
To the Southborough-Road Station, but that hope was vain, alas !
We had been calm and patient; but we grew desp'rate now;
And we got back to the station with a cloud upon each brow;
And it really was enough to make a fellow rather riled,
Of bub and grub in this way to find himself beguiled!
We waited for a train, for hours; and in such piteous case,
That to get a glass of water one had quite a row to face;
And when at last the carriages got with us under weigh,
We were kept at sidings, shunted, in the most provoking way!
Good night—good night; but leave the key of the cellar in the door,
ou’ve drawn a jug of beer I see, but I shall want some more;
And if of this cold mutton, in the morning, nought is seen,
Tell Cook she need not be surprised—my appetite's so keen.
You'll find my muddy gaiters upon the passage floor; - -
With my pouch—but mind the candle—there’s ten rounds in it or
more;
Tell the maid to dry my boots—in a ditch I got them wet;
I tried to leap across it, but into it chanced to get.
Good night; you’ll see well-brushed the coat and trousers l have
worn;
And take care and get them mended, where I hitched upon a thorn;
I’ll be sure and put the lights out, when I’ve had my meat and

should end there; and where the cause is so good, as in the present
jº. there will surely be no need to say more than one good word
Orl
GILES SCROGGINS’S JOURNAL.
Y some persons the following state-
ment in the Spiritual Magazine for
July may be thought to require
confirmation:-
“A few evenings ago, during the month
of June, some remarkable spirit mani-
festations took place at the mansion of
the French Ambassador, Albert Gate.
Amongst a large number of influential
persons who witnessed them were the Duc
and DUCHEsse DE MALAKoff, Count PER-
signy, and Lord WARD, who all expressed
their great satisfaction and delight to
MADAME Louise BEsson, who was the
medium present.”
The same, number of the same
periodical also contains the sub-
H joined announcement:—
“SPIRIT MEDIUM AND CLAIRvoyANTE.-
MADAME Louise Besson, King Street, Soho
Square, has séances daily, and is open to
private engagements."
Some ladies have doubles, if we may credit Spiritualism, like the
young person mentioned by RoRERT DALE Owen in his Footfalls on
the Boundaries of Another World, the Livonian Governess, who lost
nineteen situations by her extraordinary duplicity. MADAME Louise
Besson, may also possess, or be possessed with, a duplicate; and,
whilst she was astonishing the natives and foreigners at the French
Ambassador's, her counterpart, or counterfeit, may have been prac:
tising professional necromancy, at King Street, Soho Square. If
the medium of Albert Gate and the advertising seeress are one and the
same person, then, albeit she may be describable as a “wise woman,”
the less that is said the better about the wisdom of Count PERSIGNY,
the DUKE and Duchess of MALAKOFF, LORD WARD, and a large
number of influential persons—or else about the accuracy of the
Spiritual Magazine. The veracity of our credulous contemporary is
not in question. But when the above-named personages complimented
MADAME BEsson on her “spirit manifestations,” did they congratulate
her as a witch or an artist? ---
If MADAME BEsson is really in a position to accept engagements as
a “Spirit Medium and Clairvoyante,”--just as she might hire herself
out as a corn-cutter, she must be able to command spiritual mani-
festations nearly whenever she pleases. Old SAM Wesley told the
rapping spirit of Epworth to come into his study if it had anything to
say to him. Couldn't MADAME BEsson, come to Punch's Qffice, and
get a spirit to rap out a spirited communication for this periodical on
the counter? - - -
Perhaps not. Like LoRD, MAMSBERRY, Punch is not particular
about spelling, because that is corrigible; but erroneous orthography
and bad composition are apt to be conjoined. . Of bad writing, in com-
bination with bad grammar, an instance may be quoted from this same
number of the Spiritual Magazine, in the following message ...;
as having been transmitted by a departed spirit through the hand of a
medium, in a backward scrawl:—
“Ye are sorrowing as one without hope.”
The spirit substitutes Ye are for Thou art. If we are to believe the
supernatural origin of the foregoing sentence, we may suppose it to have
emanated from an illiterate Methodist parson. The passage in question
will remind most of our readers of a very similar piece of spiritual
English, occurring in a familiar metrical legend:—
“When, standing all by the bed-post,
A figure tall her sight engrossed,
And it cried, “I beez GILEs Scroggins's fººt ;
Ritol de riddle lol de ray !”
Exactly so. Ritol de riddle lol de ray! What else is there to be
said in either case? Nothing but that some spirits, like most rogues,
write, and probably read, imperfectly, and might be classified, as the
rogues are, under the head of “R. & W. Imp.”. Punch is credibly
informed—credibly, because spirit-writing bears the information out,
that at a recent necromantic séance the spirits were summoned by an
old female party with the invocation, “Is there any ºperrits present?”
On the same occasion Punch's informant says that he put his hand
under the table to be grasped by any other that might dare to take
hold of it, fully prepared to drag that other up to the light. The
experiment proved unsuccessful...
Mr. Punch recommends his spiritual contemporary to remember that
the ridicule of truth should be regarded with serene contempt and
refuted by demonstration; that experiments which cannot be performed
except under certain conditions which are among those of jugglery are
inconclusive, and that it is the peculiarity of all quacks and enthusiasts,
whether religious or scientific, to resent derision of their impostures
or delusions. “Let th9se laugh who win,” is the maxim of the sure
philºsopher. LoRDs LYNDHURST and BRough AM are believers in
spiritualism, are they BROUGHAM and LYNDHURST also among the
spirit-rappers! So the §: Magazine asserts; but Incredulity
whispers "WALKER!” hat are the odds that any alleged spiritual
manifestation is genuine? Who will bet on the head of AME
BEsson; who will back her to obtain one rap on a table? There is an
oracle that may settle this question; a point on which we would advise
our spiritual to consult our sporting contemporary. Bell's Life is at
least as likely as any other humansmedium to give a correct answer to
any inquiry touching the life beyond the grave.
GOLDSMID'S DESERTED WILLAGE.
“MR. WHITE, a Radical, has been returned for Brighton, beating MR. MooRE, a
Tory, and MR. GoLDSMID, a Jew.”—Weekly Paper.
To the above concise narrative Mr. Punch would have had nothing
to add, but that from reports of the election, and from correspondence,
it would appear that MR. MooRE may complain of being bracketed
with MB. GoupsMLD, as beaten. MR. MooRE was beaten—Brighton
olled 1565 Whites and 1239 Moores, and the Tory went down in fair
ght. But MR. GoLDSMID retired in the middle of the contest, after
polling only 477 votes. And he retired, because he had no chance of
winning. And he had no chance of winning, because he, or his agents,
had endeavoured to bring to bear upon MR. WHITE a Jew Screw
which is not generally approved by English mechanics. MR. White
stated upon the hustings that the Hebrew's agent had called upon the
Radical's agent, and told him that something which happened in con-
nection with the pecuniary affairs of MR. WHITE, twenty-three years
o, had come to MR. GoLDSMID's knowledge, and that, if MR.
WHITE did not retire, those particulars should be made known to every
elector of Brighton. The threat was carried out, and the fact that
MR. WHITE had been unsuccessful in business at Plymouth nearly a
quarter of a * back, and had not cleared away all his debts, was
*...*. by handbills throughout Brighton. The answer of
righton was to vote for the Tory and the Radical, and the Jew had
to retire with a splendid minority of 477 votes, which must be con-
siderably under the number of Mosaic jewellers and cigar-shopkeepers
at Brighton, who would naturally support their fellow-believer.
Mr. Punch fought the cause of the Jews for years and years, and
finally brought them, into. Parliament. ... He has also supported the
honourable and amiable, if not very brilliant, representatives whom
Israel has sent to the House. But he begs to warn Jewry generally not
to fallinto the mistake of imitating such Christians as work the money
screw, either in the way of bribery or of intimidation, and sometimes get
convicted by Yorkshire juries. It would be a bad day for the British
Jew should Mr. Punch withdraw his countenance from that party—in
fact the sooner he took, in such an emergency, a non-return ticket for
Palestine the better., Mr. Punch believes that the majority of his
Hebrew friends would disapprove as heartily as he and Brighton have
done of the mean attempt to damage MR. WHITE; but it is just as well
to let Jewry know that what Mr. Punch would denounce in a Christian
he is not disposed to pardon in a Jew. Equality of privileges implies
an equal standard of what is just and gentlemanly.

hands of a solicitor. Yet, under existing circumstances, it is necessary
to announce to the benevolent, that their charitable contributions are
earnestly solicited for the Solicitor who has shut up the Broadstairs
Boatmen in prison; and that any addition over the sum of that gen-
tleman's bill which they may please to subscribe, so as to compensate
the wrongs of those meritorious prisoners, will be thankfully received.
What the men have done to deserve thus much we know; but we do
not know why CAPias and his clients should be empowered to enforce
their demands upon insolvents by squeezing liquidation out of the
public heart, The performance of this operation or experiment, either
upon sympathisers or friends and relations, is the only purpose which
detention for debt, when it is not penal, can ſº. serve, and it is
one so undesirable that perhaps Parliament will, some Session or other,

imprisonment for all debtors but rogues.

CHAPTER XXIV. — THE REIGNS OF EDWARD THE FIRST
AND EDWARD THE SECOND.
E described in our last chapter the
armour which was worn in the first
of these two reigns, and that used in
the second did but very little differ
from it. To the weapons of offence
there were added a sort of poleaxe,
known as a godendac, and a scimi-
tar, which is said to have been
“borrowed from the Turks,” but
which is not recorded as having
been returned to them.* Perhaps
the scimitar was used by the semi-
tars and semi-soldiers who engaged
at sea; but for these marine man-
slaughterers the falcastrum, a kind
highly recommended by the fighting
faculty. The falcastrum is described
as a sort of scythe fixed firmly at
the end of a long spear; and the
wielders of it doubtless, like the
lawyers with their bills, must have
made, themselves unpleasant by
“sticking it into” people.
As these new weapons of offence
rendered enemies of course more
offensive than they had been, the
armour was made stronger and more
cut-and-thrust-and-poke-proof. A
greater quantity of plate was worn
mixed with the chain; by which we
do not mean that knights carried
more forks and spoons about them,

plate-baskets. Wrought iron almost
covered the hauberk and chaussés: greaves of one plate shielded the
forepart of the leg: and plates known as mamelières were worn upon
the breast; while the arm, we learn, was armed with vant-braces,
and brassarts, not named from brass the metal, but from bras the
arm. As a further alteration, the beer-barrel shaped helmet assumed,
we are told, a “sugar-loaf or egglike form:” which seems as if its
wearers had it in their heads to indicate a preference for sweet
wort or egg § The common men at arms however, still wore
the ancient skull-cap, which, though called chapeau de fer, must
not be confounded with the modern fur cap. But we should
notice that they wore it now without a nose-piece, which appears to
have been cut off in the reign of Edwarp THE FIRST. at Occa-
sioned this removal the reader is at perfect liberty to guess; for we
find nothing authentically stated on the point. The best conjecture
we can make is, that as the nasal stuck out like the handle of a sauce-
pan, it must have been a tempting thing to clutch at and lay hold of,
and men were doubtless taken prisoners by being taken by the nose-
piece, which was about as ignominious as being . by the nose.

how little our first Edward cared for finery and fashion, it is enough
to say his common dress was like that of a commoner. He always
wore blue looks when he ever had to wear his º robes, of purple,
and we learn that, after the coronation ceremony, he showed his sense
by never, again putting on his crown, Had SHAKsKEAR: then been
extant, the King might have quoted, in defence of what he did, the
line which SayS,
“Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,"
—although he must have owned there is some sense in the suggestion
lat—
“If a king lies uneasy in his crown,
He'd better take it off when he lies down."
As a reason for his singular ºpiº of dress, Epward is said to
have observed, that “Members of the feathered tribe are not made
fine minded by the fineness of their plumage,” and to have added to
this strikingly original remark the declaration, that although his
Christian name was Edward, still he was not such a Neddy as
to fancy kings were more esteemed in costly clothes than coarse
Ones.
To readers so intelligent as those must be who study Punch, it is
needless, to relate that, under such, a sovereign, finery and foppery
went rather out of fashion, and dowdy dressers doubtless found chief
favour at his Court. When the Prince of Wales however was invested
with the military belt of knighthood, § robes, fine linen and gold-
embroidered mantles were liberally distributed to his young knight
companions,” who, we fear, were up to sad fº. in the Temple
Gardens, for we find it stated that “yº flowere o y” nobilitye did playe
sad havock with y' floweres.” R. BRooME, the present Temple
Gardener, been there, he would probably have had a brush with these
; rakes, and perhaps have used the birch to sweep them from the
place.
Fops came more into favour in the reign of Edwarp THE SEconD,t
and the most finicking and fine of them were probably his favourites.
PIERs GAVESTON set the example by out-dressing his peers, and fol-
lowing his lead, “the esquire endeavoured to outshine the knight, the
knight the baron, the baron the earl, the earl the king himself, in the
richness of his apparel.” In fact everybody tried to cut a greater
shine than everybody else, and, how splendidly they flared up may b
seen by looking at the old illuminations. Swell vied with swell in
the absurdest manner possible, and as, doubtless, a good many of them
* This scimitar, no doubt, was the weapon used by SALADIN to cut the scarf and
cushion, on the day of the Arabian Knights' Entertainment to KING Richard.—
Wide Talisman.
* When our PRINCE Edwańn comes from Canada, we may probably expect to see
this ceremony repeated: and the Government may save themselves from searching
for a precedent by bearing in their minds the present chapter of our Book. As one of
the young knight (and day) ..". of the Prince, Mr. Punch may just remind
them that he likes his linen marked plainly with a P., and that as embroidery has
now gone out of fashion, he would prefer to have the gold simply put in his pocket;
or, as he does not wear a mantle, if it be laid upon his mantel-piece he will be quite
as well content.

we remember, fell a sacrifice to

But great as was their dandyism,

fashions were but very little varied
in this reign, and the costume of
both nobs and snobs was like that
of their grandfathers. The only
novelty worth note, was that the
cloak-hood or capuchon which had
been worn 3 la cowl, was often fan-
cifully twisted and worn a la toque.
In some cases, however, it was
simply folded and balanced on the
brain-pan, as the women of the Pays
de Basque bask in, it in summer-
time even to this day. From the
head-dress to the head being no
eat step, we may add here, that the
lair was curled with monstrous
care, and that beards were only
worn by old fogies and knights
templars, and great officers of state.

he was bearded on his way to the

EFFECTS OF THE ECLIPSE.
OUR position being settled as that of the first scientific journal of
the day, of course we felt desirous, for our own interest as well as that
of all our readers, to obtain the fullest, truest, and the most particular
account of the Eclipse; and we therefore called together our sharpest-
eyed contributors, and enjoined them to spare no expense in railway;
tickets and smoked glass, and if they wished to go to Spain we said
that we would “stand the Spanish,” for the purpose of observing the
most noteworthy effects. A day or two elapsed without our hearing
anything from any single one of them, or even any of the married ones;
but on inquiring at our bankers' we discovered that ". had given
proof of their existence by cashing the blank cheques which we had
given them permission, if needful, to fill up. The amounts might have
staggered any ordinary capitalist, but the sole emotion they produced
on our part was that of pleasure in the thought that the money was
well spent, inasmuch as it had furthered scientific observation, and
would enable us no doubt to eclipse all other journals in describing the
Eclipse. But we regret that we must say our joy was a short-lived
one; for on returning with our pass-book to enter up the items, our
peace of mind was broken by a seedy-looking person. , Approaching
us with somewhat of a corkscrewy, gyration, he solemnly deposited a
packet on our writing-desk, and whispered º in a liquid
tone of voice, “Allsh’rene olecock!. Sheclipsh-hic-wentoffshsthunnin!”
The delivery of this oracular remark was followed by a scarcely more
intelligible request for “aborreloshodawawr-hic-ifyoushhic gorritandy:”
and the remedy somewhat removing his impediment of speech, our
visitor then informed us that he and some scientific co-labourers had
been staying down at Greenwich to witness the Eclipse, and that
the packet he had brought contained their several reports. We must
own that we find nothing in the notes that have been handed us which
might not have been written without stirring out of London. How-
ever, as nothing has come to hand from our own staff, we shall print
from them the following selections, adding in each instance the names
of the observers, as a proof of the great confidence we place in their
reports. These will serve at all events to show the future HERschEL
that among the queer phenomena attending the Eclipse, there were
many strange effects observed, of which no mention has been made in
any other journal, and which were scarcely less worth seeing than
those which our astronomers went all the way to Spain to see:-
“The effects of the Eclipse were plainly visible in Parliament. Members all
seemed in the dark as to what was to be done about the China War; and how
MR. Gladstone's Spirit-Tax could be reconciled with the opinions expressed in his
great speech on bringing in his Budget."—SMITH,
“MR. Fly THER of the bankrupt firm of Flyther and M'Hookit, had prepared to
take advantage of the darkness that was looked for at the time of the Eclipse, to
get the best of his effects on board a steam-boat for Boulogne. The obscurity, how-
ever, proving less than had been counted on, an observation could be taken of Mr.
FLY THEa's movements, and the venue of his occultation was altered before night-
fall from Boulogno to Bow Street."—Bhows.
“Miss FLIRTINGrox had hoped to make good use of the Eclipse by m º
tête-à-tête with Load Fitz-WALTER CRGEsus, who had unwarily arranged to join her
family at Richmond. In their progress to the Park she skilfully contrived to
secure him as her escort, and had the obscuration been as t as she expected,
F. the hooking of his fortune might have been one of its effects. There was,
owever, so provoking a continuance of light, that his lordship, with hisnaked eye,
could see that she was fishing for him; and not even at the moment of the greatest
occultation did the darkness hide sufficiently the plainness of the bait.”—Jones.
“A marked magnetic variation took place during the Eclipse at the house of the
reputedly rich Mrs. BLUNTE, at Bayswater. The deviation was occasioned by an
observation being taken of the will of her late husband, which has just been
exhibited at Doctors' Commons. It was discovered by this instrument that the
daughter, not the widow, of MR. BLUNTE, was his chief heiress. In consequence
of this, several single gentlemen who called on MRs. BLUNTE, on the day of the
Eclipse, showed a marked deviation from their former course; the magnet that
attracted them being, it was clear, no longer the hand of the old lady, but the
young one."—TITTLE.
“MR. SwizzleR being urged by a scientific friend to make a note of what “pre-
cipitation of moisture’ accompanied the Eclipse, observed that he that day pre-
cipitated precisely twelve pints and a half of moisture down his throat between the
periods of his first and last contact with the pewter. MR. Swizzler did not make
an observation with a glass, but his experience at once apprised him of the fact
that the wet was of the kind which by the savans is called "heavy.’”-WALKER.

THE corps had been washed, newly washed in a shower,
Which, as usual, had spoiled our parade:
The plentiful moisture, poured down for an hour,
With our uniforms havoc had played.

For a hat it had duty to do.

Poor shako—a shaking to stand!
And swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas!

With his helmet, so neatly combined:
He exposed it to thwacks, which the joints rudely cracked,
Not for use but appearance designed.

DONKEY-PASTURES IN RICHMOND PARK.
DURING the last few years Richmond Park has been undergoing a
gradual system of subsoil drainage; sets of tile-pipes progressively
laid down in sections of the ground, piece by piece, and each piece,
consisting of several acres, consequently deformed, spoiled, and, for
more than twelve months, till the clods of turf, which are dug up and
piled in ridges along the courses of the drains, have had time to sub-
side,-rendered º impassable. It is a remarkable fact, that the
reward of these costly operations, appropriately remunerative of the
taste which ordained them, should be, in almost every spot whereon
}º been expended, the development of a plentiful crop of
asſies.
“The Keating of our own Heart.”
MR. Justice KEATING the other day thought proper, in speaking
from the Bench about two foolish persons who had attempted suicide,
to say, “He supposed these people had been reading novels.” MR.
Justick PUNCH would like to know the basis of his learned brother's
obiter dictum. Do novels inculcate suicide, or does novel-reading drive
people to that absurdity? He might as reasonably have said he sup:
posed these people had been taking KEATING's Cough Lozenges, and
Mr. Punch presents the learned judge with this advertisement of those
excellent compositions, in compensation for having pointed out that he
occasionally talks nonsense.

THE POPE’S IRISH RAGAMUFFINS.
(To GEORGE Bowyer, Esq., M.P.)
CHIVALRous SIR,
As the Pope's Knight-errant, I wonder you have not come forward to
break a lance with those unworthy Irishmen—those bad Catholics—who, having
apostatised from the Papal Brigade and sneaked home, go about complaining of the
usage which they experienced in the service of his Holiness. It seems that I
must do the Holy Father's business for you.
The Irish volunteers in the service of our Lord the Pope were naturally supposed,
by his Holiness and LAMORICIERE, to be devout Catholics. As such they were
treated with the greatest possible attention. They were afforded every facility for
fasting. The means of doing penance were freely afforded them. What better fare
could a Saint wish for than an insufficiency of black bread and sour wine, what
better couch could he desire than the floor of a stable? Circumstanced as the
recruits were, they no doubt swarmed with vermin and reeked with filth, and, if
they had expired in that blessed state, would have died in the odour of sanctity.
They complain that some of their number were shot for breach of discipline.
If so, had they not the friars of San Giovanni Decollato to confess them; and did
they not therefore go to Paradise? They even murmur because some of them
were flogged. Their grievance was a privilege. How, many, holy men are con-
tinually whipping one another; how many are obliged to whip themselves, not
having anybody whom they can trust to perform that pious office for them! The
ungrateful grumblers ought to have kissed the cat-of-nine-tails which “whipped
the offending ADAM out of them.” Excuse me for quoting a heretical poet.
What could these pilgrims expect at Macerata but being thoroughly macerated?
Had they understood their own faith—if there was any in them—they would
have known that mortification necessarily awaited them in an army of confessors
and martyrs, and whilst they would of course have been mortified by the indignities,
privations, and punishments, to which they were subjected, they would by no
means have been disappointed, but on the contrary, perfectly well satisfied, with
the chastisement which they had to endure. - -
Hoping that the foregoing apology for the sacred commissariat and the holy
diº of the Pontifical army may encourage many true Catholic devotees to
enlist in its ranks, I have the honour to remain, chivalrous
Sir, your Knighthood's humble Servant, Substitute, and
Esquire,
49&INGLA.
P.S. It does not appear that the Holy See provided its
Irish crusaders with hair-shirts. But what then? It did
the next best, thing in not finding them any shirts at all.
And for suitable stuff to wear next the skin, they might
i: foundstinging-nettles enough, instead of linenin every

THE MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS.
FYTTE FIRST-FEBRUARY.
It was a score of blithesome Bills—
Merrily came they in-
And fair without, looked the gamesome rout,
And neat as a new-made pin;
Each would-be law, without a flaw,
Or erasure-line within.
'Twas a sight to behold these Bills so bold,
So blithe and débonnaire,
As each took his place on the paper,
Where room was still to spare,
With the Member that was in charge of him,
So proud of his nursling fair.
SIR BETHELL LE BLAND, in either hand,
Led innocents many a one;
The first he was strong, and lusty and long—
With º writ thereon:
And a train of Law Bills followed him,
Whose godfather was “Plain John.”
And proud was the mien of GLAnstone, Iween,
As his masterful way he bore,
With Bills enow most fathers to cow,
A gambolling before:
Wines, Spirits, and Paper, and Savings Banks,
And HANSARD he knows what more!
Tho' cool of blood, and fishy of mood,
Even Lewis was stirred with pride,
As with conscious face he took his place,
With two old Bills at his side—
One yelept City Corporation Reform—
One Highways—often-tried.
And SIR CHARLEs De Wood, bewildered he stood,
Aud you scarce his head might see,
For the crowd of Bills the space that fills
Where SIR CHARLEs his head should be—
All Indian Bills, with porcupine quills,
A-bristling angrily.
More blithe M.P.s I trow than these,
St. Stephens did ne'er espy:

That no Bill may defy!

UAKERISM was said, may shown, to be dying out... But a new phase
of the drab faith has just been manifested, and we should not wonder
if there were a Revival. A person, proclaiming himself a Quaker,
enters the meeting-house of his and the Friends, near Gracechurch
Street (in pious conversation they call, it Grace-steeple-house Street),
and proceeds loudly to animadvert, in the most personal manner, upon
divers members of the Society there present. One he explained tº be
a Wolf, another an Owl, and the third a Deceiver, adding, other illus-
trations of character. And his º was, he said, that it was a
Quaker doctrine, that you should always speak your mind. It occurs
to FRIEND Punch, that FRIEND. BRIGHT is, the founder of this new
sect of Quakers. Their practice is very much in his style. Does he
want a good-looking convert who delights to speak his mind? If so
verily let him apply at No. 85, near the steeple-house carnally called
Bride's or Bridget's,

not have let this wasted Session go without passing in some shape
the “little Bill” they introduced for Bankruptcy Reform. To prove
how utterly erroneous are these absurd impressions, Mr. Punch *:::
to report a day's proceedin s in his presence—if he may º: e
term “proceedings” where there seems but little progress. stead
of copying, however, the curt style of the reporters, Mr. Punch will
ve his notes a somewhat more dramatic form: feeling justified in
oing so by a remark he overheard made by a lawyer in his presence,
that the Court work which he witnessed was as good as any play:-
Scene—A Court in Basinghall Street, which would be seen more clearly
were the windows ever washed. Time-Eleven o'clock, A.M., and
though it is so early, the Court is crammed with people doing the work
& other Courts, which are already far too full to hold them. The
oMMissioner, as usual, has not yet arrived; but the business ºf the
day commenced at ten o’clock as usual, by the Usher challenging the
Registhan to take a pinch of snuff. Since then nothing of importance
worth recording has transpired; and the time has been employed in
the usual stage business. The Messengers are reading the #. Paper
in their pews, and having very nearly got the inner sheet by heart, are
now in sheer despair poring over the advertisements. Small boys sit
behind, munching suckers, cracking cherry-stones, and copying pro-
ceedings. Every one is talking as loudly as he can, and apparently
without getting any one to listen to him. There was a meeting “RE
BLoBBs” appointed for 10:30, and no one has appeared. But Soli-
citors and Counsel (with rather aged wigs) are anariously awaiting to
hear judgment pronounced in the matter of “The Wash-your-dirty-
clothes-at-home Insurance Company,” which through the absence q
the Treasurer (with all the funds in hand) was some years since made
bankrupt. Suddenly enters, with a bany, Great Gun Solicitor “RE
Blobbs,” followed by Small pitto—atº respectful distance:–
G. Solicitor. Where’s our CoMMIssion ERP
Small ditto. Not come yet, I presume.
G. Solicitor, Do you oppose?
Small ditto. Yes, I have instruc-
Great Gun (interrupting). Just come over here.

which does not last long, but lasts long enough to rouse some of

much think you'll have to wait long, MR. BANGER.
[Erit timidly in search of the CoMºMissioner. Business as before.
Parties in RE SNIGGERLY arrive in haste and anariously inquire
for the CoMMIssionER, and witnesses in RE “The Milk and Mealy

corner by their Counsel. Court very noisy.
Dirty-widged ſounsel. You swear that, do you, Sir?
Dirtier-trigged Counsel. Why, of course, you know he swears it.
Isn't he on oath?
Enter REGISTRAR in triumph, followed by CoMMissionER. Noise in

Usher (bellowing). Si-lence in the Co-o-ort'
[Court still more noisy. CoMMissionER calmly takes his seat,
unlocks his desk, and yawns. All the Counsel and Solicitors
simultaneously endeavour to attract his attention. His Honour
bears in mind the dictum, that an upright British Judge should
never show a bias, and accordingly bestows his notice upon none
ºf them.
Great Gun (popping up, and going off as usual with a bang). I have to
apply to your Honour for a certificate in the matter of John Josiah
Lobbs. In the first place I must draw the attention of your
Honour——
[Fires away for some fire minutes, the CoMMIssionER remaining per-
ſectly unconscious, and being occupied apparently with a calcu.
lation of the cost of whitewashing the ceiling. Noise in Court
tº creases.

forward to him a sum of 6,000
fr., which they had intended
for the purchase of their sum-

the purchase of muskets."
Is not this indeed a tre-
mendous sacrifice of dra-

going, without your sum-

winter clothes, or those of

actual surrender of finery would kill you, would it not? There is

you might assist in the emancipation of Italy at a sacrifice much less

It is highly probable that the reverend gentleman will go over to
Rome; where he will be enabled to practise any postures, and wear
any petticoats of the kind that he admires, and also to sing his prayers
through his nose in the key of A flat, or the bray of a donkey. In the
Eternal City he may intone Paw Wobiscum without causing a row.
When he is at Rome it will be very proper for him to do as the Romans

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 23. Monday. The Lords were informed that the Metropolis
requires, extensive Poultry and other Provision Markets, and the
Smithfield Bill was presented to them as the means for supplying the
want. Mr. Punch has said his say upon civic greed, and has elicited
the explanation that only 550 square yards of Smithfield are to be con-
verted into poultry-yards, and about five times as much is to be let
alone, for the present. He does not expect the City to make Ducks
and Drakes of its money; but to convert into a Poultry-shop any of the
limited space which might have been arecreation ground for the people,
is a Fou #. and worthy of Cox (Finsbury). However, the site is
near St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and he hopes all concerned in the
plunder will catch the Chicken-pox from some out-door patient. If he
could mark his contempt for the City by making any worse jokes on the
subject, he would do so. The Bill was read a Second time. A Bill
for relieving the Press, from certain liabilities was opposed by LORD
CHELMSFORD, as calculated to hinder the punishment of libellers, and
was rejected.
LoRD PALMERSTON announced to the House that we really must
Fortify. He meant no disrespect to Anybody anywhere, and Nobody
had any “call” to be offended; but it would not do for England to
owe her safety to Anybody's forbearance, and she must be as strong as
Anybody else. Therefore it was proposed, to lay, out about Nine
#. of money in the way recommended by the Fortification Com-
mission. There is to be no attempt to defend London, PALMERSTON
considering that Mr. Punch's residence in the E. C. |. Early Closing)
District is sufficient guarantee for the impregnability of the City
which, moreover, PAM said would have to be saved by a Hattle—and
one Battle he thought would be sufficient for the purpose. But we
are to make our i. and naval storehouses so safe that, happen
what may, we shall always have ample means of warfare at our com:
mand. The dockyards and arsenals generally are to be fortified.
About Two Millions of money are wanted at once. PALMERStoN made
a spirited speech, which offended MR. BRIGHT, who declared that,
come what might, the money should not be granted off-hand, and who
afterwards gave notice of a resolution
more. MR. LINDSAY, a ship-builder,
stone walls, and means to oppose PAM.
The Monster HERBERT then made an interesting speech on the
details of the F. works. The places that are to be fortified are
Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Pembroke; and inasmuch as the Thames
does not smell this year, and is therefore useless as an offensive force,
about £180,000 is to be spent thereon. On the Medway, and at
Chatham, there are to be works. Dover is to be made strong, as is
Portland, and there is to be a good deal done at Cork. That is the
Government proposal for defending the kingdom against Anybody, and
it was arranged that it should be considered that day week.
On the Civil Service Estimates, our Wiscount came out. He wants
the grounds of Hampton Court used for the training of Riflemen and
as Shooting-Grounds for them, Mr. Punch thinks that visitors
might like to be heard upon that subject, and that it should be a
matter of inquiry, how far it would be agreeable to a couple of lovers
spooneyfying beside, the fat gold-fishes, to have their sentimental con-
yersation interrupted by a howl from Epwin to the effect that a conical
ball had just gone through the am sangwitches in his coat-tail pocket, or
a squeal from ANGELINA setting forth that a similar stray missile had
knocked the steel of her Crinoline hind part before. The Wiscount
made several other suggestions, which were also treated with the most
erfect contempt. There was an idea for building a new house for the
ig Car which was the only ridiculous thing at the funeral of the Duke
of WELLINGTON. This the PRINCE of WALEs is of course not going to
have choking up the court-yard of his house in Pall Mall, and MR. Cow-
PER does not seem to know what to do with it. Considerable sarcasm
was launched at the Car, and MR. CowPER finally withdrew the vote,
iteously declaring, however, that he must have some place to put it in.
hy on earth, if it is to be preserved at all, is it not put into the Hall of
Chelsea Hospital, where the old Land-Crabs might pick up an occasional
sixpence by showing it, and lying about their own achievements under
the Duke, just as the old Sea-Crabs do at Greenwich about Nelson f
Tuesday. The Lords, got through a good deal of business, and
ainst fortifying ourselves any
so, of course, sees no sense in
ELLENBoRough made a little speech which deserves to be remembered.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Whether its grace is materially increased by the fact that the speaker's
father was a law lord, is a matter for anybody who cares about it:-
“The EARL or ELLENBorough said, he always felt a difficulty in understanding
the state of the case when he had heard three or four law lords discuss it, especially
if they spoke at any length. (Laughter.)”
The Commons had a fight on the Poor-Law Board Continuance Bill
which went through Committee, though not until the Government had
been defeated on the question, whether the Board, like Pompey in the
play, was to “continue” for five years or three, the latter alternative
being carried by 147 to 92. -
LoRD John Russell, had the pleasure of announcing to the House
that the KING OF THE Two SICILIEs was, by his own act, the King of
One Sicily only, he having been obliged to order that the island be
*::::: by his troops. §t is stated that this announcement is pre-
mature. It is also said that the KING OF SARDINIA sent to GARIBALDI
to beg he would not think of attacking the mainland; but GARIBALDI,
curiously, happening to be out of the way, of course the King's
message could not reach him. - ---
MR. O'BRIEN wanted the Government to make it a condition on
board the mail-packets they subsidised, that there shall be none of that
system of insulting coloured ladies and gentlemen of which we have
lately heard so much. MR. LAING replied, that all the colourable
interest of Government in these ships' concerns is the safe conveyance
of what is down in Black and White in the letters. A long debate
on the present absurd system of Promotion and Retirement in the
Navy followed, SIR John PAKINGTON demanding an inquiry into the
subject, which demand was successfully resisted by the Ministers.
JWednesday. SIR. G. C. Lewis drew a whole row of the teeth of the
Ecclesiastical Commission Bill, by withdrawing all the clauses on
which serious fight was offered, and the measure being thus rendered
#: useless, the House discussed it, in Committee, with much
affability.
Thursday. In the Felony Bill it was enacted by the Lords that counsel
for the prisoner shall have the right of .# only when the Judge
thinks it necessary. Mr. Punch is rather inclined to agree with Lokn
ELLENBoRough, that this is rather unfair upon the Judge, who will
very likely permit many a needless harangue rather than be charged
with shutting up the advocate's mouth. As regards the interests of
justice, there does not seem to be any harm in the arrangement, or
that a criminal will be much more likely to get off because his man has
the last word. MR. Justice PUNch would feel it his duty to be par-
ticularly clear in his summing up after such an address, and would
certainly not be, as the Judge in old time, was called, Counsel for the
prisoner.
The Bill with (or rather without) the Drawn Teeth went through
Committee. The CHANCELLOR or THE X. informed MR. BRIGHT
that the one and elevenpenny Rap just inflicted on Spirits was to be
permanent spirit-rapping. LoRD John Russel L stated, that the KING
of NAPLEs had begged the Government of England to insist on
GARIBALDI's accepting an armistice, and that the Government of
England had informed the KING OF Napies that they would see him
in Acheron first, and then they wouldn't, whereat the House cheered.
MR. LAING stated, that the Post Office Report was under consideration.
Mr. Punch's private Spirits have informed him of one thing in it which,
when disclosed, he proposes to make a precious row about. LoRD
PALMERston then, after a good deal of grumbling and growling from
the Opposition and others, took away another large piece of the little
time now left to independent Members. The Gas Tyrants Correction
Bill was passed, on the motion of SIR John SHELLEY, who deserves
the title of the Gas GARIBALDI, .
After a sentimental little motion of MR. HENNEssy had been squashed
by 73 to 15, the important Bill about the Indian Army came on again,
and after some debating, a motion for adjournment was made, to which
LoRD PALMERSTON assented, saying,
“It is the duty of Hrr Majesty's Ministers to sit here and listen to any length of
speeches that Honourable Gentlemen may choose to make, and to any length of
extracts that they may tender us. (A laugh and cheers.) Of course, when an
Honourable Member is at a loss for other arguments, it is very natural that he
should make out his speech by reading. ("Hear,” and a laugh.) HER MAJEsty's
Government attach great importance to this Bill. Our patience is inexhaustible,
i. ;: are quite prepared to sit here until Christmas in order to pass it. (Hear,
r.)”
This did not exactly tend to sweeten the tempers of some of the
º; of the Bill, which Colon EL Sykes declared would greatly
tile the 4980 British officers in the local service, besides ruining the
Indian Empire. This debate was acrimoniously resumed next night,
and again adjourned till the Monday, so that it might delightfully
interfere with the Fortifications discussion.
. A Bill for interfering with Theatres and Public-Houses had been
introduced, but in consequence of the publication of a letter on the
subject from the Christy Minstrels, who would be affected by its action,
it was withdrawn, and the poetical person who writes the gibberish
chanted by these begimed parties received orders to prepare a song of
jubilee. He sent an early copy to Mr. Punch, who is much pleased
with it, and considers it quite up to the mark of the Christy poetry.
The first of the fifty-three verses goes thus:–
“Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Yaw, yaw, yaw,
Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Him shan’t be law. t
Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Yap, yap, yap, -
Take away dat Bill, Nigger,
Dat’s a good chap.
Take away, &c., &c, &c., &c.”
Friday. The British Coroner savours a good deal of the British
Beadle. He is usually either a spouting Doctor or a pushing Attorney,
and he gets his place by a desperate canvass, with placards and all the
vulgar machinery of a parochial struggle. , When in office, his business
is to hold as many inquests, as he possibly can, because he is paid out
of fees on separate cases. It is therefore to his interest that as many
persons should make away with themselves or be made away with as
possible. A Bill for making him a little less obnoxious to the public
was this evening read a Second time. The Coronets avowed considerable
contempt for the Coroners. -
The Session and Season are now telling upon everybody. People
get weary, cross, and careless; and even Mr. Punch himself is conscious
of occasionally emitting an epigram whose excellent wit is not quite
polished up to his habitually preternatural effulgence. He sometimes
ives gold—the purest, doubtless, but only gold—instead of diamonds.
he fact is, that it is time to leave town, and bathe the soul in shady
woods. Any person who is up to his ...' mark during the last part
of the Season is a Snob, and not Elegant and Sought After. Any journal
that is as well written in September as in May is written by Snobs.
These remarks are not made in any Aristocratic spirit of Swell-dom—
Mr. Punch conceived them while eating a cold *: and leaning at
the door of a country public-house—but to º or the House of
Commons, which is just now dawdling, twaddling, and every now and
then having a violent scold. PALMERSTON to-night rebuked the Oppo-
sition for hindering and talking, and advised Members to avail them-
selves of every opportunity of holding their tongues, whereat DisrAELI
blazed up, and said that all the loss of time and good measures arose
from the Government-Coalition having, merely for factious purposes,
and to keep their places, wasted the Session on an Illusory Treaty and
a Moonshine Reform Bill. Even big BENTINck, of Norfolk, has grown
nervous, and thinks all the foreigners in London are going to rise and
pull u º: telegraph-posts and tear up the railways. We must all get
Out Of town.
THE PAPAL BRIGADIER'S RETURN.
THE Irish Boy is come back from Rome,
In a seedy suit you’ll find him :
He brings large holes in his breeches home,
And his coat slit up behind him.
“Land of bosh!” cried the downy card,
“Though Priests may howl, be aisy:
Some lads have cut the Papal guard—
Some greenhorns, duped, not crazy.”
The Boy was done, but the Papal chain
Could not keep his shrewdsoul under ;
The swag he expected, he didn’t gain;
So he found he'd made a blunder.
And said, “No Pope shall humbug me;
My soul abhors base knavery.
I’ll never fight, gratis, against the Free,
For Popery and for Slavery!”
WE OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL.
Is Forbes WINslow's new book, among some very singular accounts
of the beneficial results of accidents to persons of feeble intellect, is a
statement that a supposed Idiot, having received a violent blow on the
head, became a practising Barrister. Mr. Punch, ever since reading
this anecdote, has been puzzling over the Law List to try to find out
who the party is. He has his suspicions on the subject, but it is
premature to disclose them. Meantime he has resolved to be very
careful for the future how he indulges his own favourite practice of
j, idiots a rap on the head, lest he should be unwarily creating
more barristers than at present afflict creation.
OUR SANGUINE FRIEND.
THE Honourable Member for Birmingham opposes the loan for the
fortification of our dockyards. He evidently takes too BRIGHT a view
of the armaments of our neighbours.

PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMEs.
CHAPTER-XXV.-LOVELY WOMAN IN THE REIGNS OF
EDWARD THE FIRST AND SECOND.
T is painful to reflect that
in spite of all the boasted
ſºlº of man, ladies’
esses have at all times
more or less been jeered at,
or * . tº: the
gentlemen; perhaps because
the latter iſ: that, as they
have to pay for it, they may
as well from their wives’
finery get all the fun they
can. The time of the First
Edward certainly formed
mo, exception to this rule
and its long dresses an
large gorgets, were pretty
nearly as much ridic as
the wide dresses and small
bonnets have been in our
own day. For the credit of
our countrymen, it should
however be observed, that
the French writers were
certainly the cruelest of the
critics: the famous Roman
de la Rose being specially
distinguished by the sharp-
mess of its satire, which,
unlike the shafts of ridicule
from Mr. Punch's armoury,
was sometimes shot beyond the boundaries of decency and truth. As
it took a whole half-century to write this single poem, there was
plenty of time of course to correct,it for the press, and we cannot
excuse its authors for neglecting to have, done so., Had their birth-
time been postponed until this more polished }." they would have
known that coarse expressions admit of no defence, inasmuch as want
of decency, it is allowed, is want of sense. -
The Roman was written in France and treated of French fashions:
but of course these soon, became adopted in this, country, for we
always take our fashions, like our farces, from the French. This im-
portation was moreover much assisted at this period by a royal double
marriage in the year 1298; when Edward The FIRST espoused the
sister of PHILIP THE Fourth of France, whose daughter was united
to Nep's son, the Prince of Wales. This PHILIP was distinguished
by the nickname of “LE BEL,” and as no doubt he “wery much
applauded” his two sons-in-law for coming into take a couple of women
.# his hands, there seems to be sºle cause to suppose he supplied each
witharing. Howmany clergymen assisted at this royaldouble marriage,
we have not patience to search through the registers to learn: but we
think were such a ceremony gone through, in our day, we should
expect at least a score of parsons to take. º: in it. Now that MR.
SMITH can’t get spliced to Miss Jones without the help of some half-
dozen reverend assistants, we may assume that for a brace of royal
happy couples, the hymental halter would hardly be thought binding,
unless the knot were tied by twenty-parson power.
Leaving our lady readers to debate this knotty point, we proceed
now to describe the costume of their ancestresses, who lº."during

Their dress, we find, consisted of the robe or gown (which now was
also called a kirtle) made with long tight sleeves and fastened high
up in the neck, much as it was worn during the reign of HENRY THE
Second, and, with but trifling variation, had indeed been ever since.
A train was, however, now added to the garment, and this train appears
to have fired the mines of satire of the cynical, and caused several
explosions of wrath at its great length. One male wretch says: "Yº
maydens doe moche resemble maggpyes, seeing both of y" have tayles
which doe draggle in y” dirte;” and another monster hints that pos
sibly long trains were worn to hide large feet, asneer which is ñº

The sleeveless cyclas or supertunic was still worn over the robe, and,
we are told, was made so long that ladies were obliged to hold it up
with one hand to prevent their treading on it. The mantle too was
worn pendent down behind as it had been before: being fastened on
the shoulders by silken cords and tassels, and bordered with a rich
embroidery of gold. The ladies, we learn, used it “on state occasions
only;” but whether formal morning-calls or stiff and stately tea-fights
were included in this Fº we have now no means of knowing.
Among the habits of the leaders of the fashion at this period, we must
not omit to notice their bad habit of tight-lacing; which sad and silly
ractice, we have shown, was in existence in the reign of WILLIAM
UPUs, but since that time had verywisely been discarded. In “yº Laye
of Syr. Launſal,” written about the year 1300, we find the Lady
TRIaMoRE described as-
“Clad in purple pall,
with º body and middle small;"
and the same poem thus speaks of acouple of º damosels” whom
Syr Launſal meets “by accident” (?) in the middle of a forest (!)—

What these two young ladies were up to in the forest in such gor-
geous array, is a point on which the scandal-monger.if he likes may
speculate. Our impression is, that they had been invited to a pic-nic,
and fearing lest that dear Syr Launſal might absent himself, they
enticed him into promising to meet them in the forest, where he might
indulge in an innocent flirtation, under the plea of walking with them
to protect them from the frogs.
A very ugly species of wimple called a gorget came somewhat into
fashion in the first of these two reigns, and was worn occasionally
in the second. John De MEUN describes it as a piece of linen
wrapped some two or three times round the neck, and then, being
fastened with a dreadful lot of pins, raised on either side the face as
high * as the ears. “Pardieu/?” he exclaims, “I have often thought
eart, when I have seen a lady so closely tied up, that her neck;
cloth was either nailed unto her chin, or that i. had the pins hooked
into her flesh.” In further chaff he calls the gorget “la towelle,” a
name which seems to hint that ladies had been known to use it for a
towel, first taking the precaution to take out all the pins. He also
makes a not very delicate remark in stating that the Thorn-like pro-
º of the gorget were stuck out, at a little distance from the face,
so that,
* William De Lorals, who began it, died in the year 1960, and John DE MEU’s
ºmpleted it circa 1804.
“Entrelatemple et les cornes pourroit passer unrat,
Oula greigneurmoustelée qui soit jusques Arras."
* “Inde sendel" may mean either Indian silk, or light blue silk; for “Inde"
was often used to designate that colour.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
We omitted to record that in the reign of HENRY THE THIRD the
mode of wearing the hair was changed, and that instead of being
plaited in long fails as it was in the twelfth century, it was simply
turned up behind, and confined in a gold net. This fashion continued
in the following two reigns, and indeed remained in vogue throughout
the fourteenth century. By some writers we find the net or fret is
called a “caul,” but since our dictionary defines this as the “network
of a wig,” our jº forbids us from applying such a term to the
head-dress of a lady. Girls doubtless used these nets to assist them in
the work of fishing for a husband, and seeing that the fashion has been
recently revived, we may presume it has been found productive of net
profit.
Viewed in the º: of the old illuminations, the ladies of this period
were either sadly shamefaced, or ºl. susceptible to toothache and
sore throat. A kerchief and a veil were often worn besides the gorget,
and fair necks and faces really were so swathed and swaddled up that
there were scarcely three square inches of their surface left salutable.
Whence this anti-kiss-me-quick sort of mania could have sprung from,
the learnedest of writers (we mean, of course, ourselves) are unable to
determine; but the fashion appears certainly of oriental origin, and for
some cause the Crusaders may have possibly imported it. A husband
must be a great Turk, or else clearly a great muff, to muffle his wife's
cheeks up so that scarce an inch is kissable; and had the Cruelty-
Prevention Society been extant, it might fitly have prohibited so
arbarous a practice. To the sensitive in mind it is afflicting to reflect
what dreadful deprivations the ladies must have suffered from it; for
one would as soon have thought of takingamummy under the mistletoe,
as a girl choked in the head-gear of the fourteenth century.

But I’m sick of foreign squallers—sick of Tweedles, dee, and dum,
Sick to wishing all brass silent, and all cat-gut stricken dumb.
And with more than common sickness, I am sick of Commons' prate,
Of the Morning sittings early, and the Evening sittings late.
Sick of strangling all the good Bills, which some interest offend;
Sick of passing all the bad Bills, which there’s no time to amend.
Sick, oh sick of MR. HoRsMAN’s “taking up” and setting down;
Sick of voting supplemental millions, under MR. GLADstoNE's frown.
Sick of being ...; º all hours, to divide, or make a house,
With the knºwle ge that the Session won't respect the “sacred

Hide, oh hide me, mother Nature, in thy glad and glorious green;
Take me back into the country, while a corn-field’s to be seen.
Let me breathe the purple fallows-watch the waving of the grain,
Feel my Shorthorn’s ribs and shoulders underneath my hand again!
But I wander in my fancies—there’s that vile division bell,
To all hopes of calm and country tinkling an enforced farewell.
I am knit unto my party, I must sit at their command,
Whileijismºuſ can find dodges, and Big Ben has words on hand.
I must sit, and barred from all that to my being pleasure yields,
Thus unto the blinding Bude-lights sadly babble of green fields.

A BURLESQUE AL FRESCO.
AN Auctioneer in the North, who publishes his name as MR. DoNKIN
(but compositors are mortal men, and there may be some slight typo-
graphical error in the spelling of the respected name), has an estate to
sell, whereof he thus sweetly discourseth in the Manchester Eraminer:—
“The auctioneer feels relieved from a prolixity of details while introducing this
fascinating property to public attention; yet so completely is he beset by objects of
the most º interest, no less to those in search of the materialism of a judicious
investment of capital, than to minds soaring abºve the philosophy of the ledger,
that for a moment the solid, the substantial, the positive, the real elements of
wealth may be lost sight of in the contemplation of a scenery so associated with the
past, and where memorials through the mist of ages offer a chapter upon the history
of Chipchase Castle, grand in attitude, within the bosom of ancestral woods, and
with a fortress grey in the heraldry of the herons of Northumberland, opening its
rude portcullis into halls groined and marbled in the splendour of later times, this
majestic structure stands the wonder and admiration of North Tyne, with parks so
fat in pasturage undulating to the º of the most pellucid of rivers. Shepherds
upon its banks pipe their pastorals, while, to the Arcadian flute, Ceres waves her
sickle over harvests that are in combination with untold mineral wealth, starti
into active form, and proclaiming in the midst of a primitive ple the i...i
glories of the genius of George STEPHENsoN.—MR. Robson show the estate.”
The words of Mercury would be harsh, after the songs of Apollo—or
Ceres aforesaid, and Mr. Punch permits himself no comment. But he
must congratulate MR. DoNK-IN on having secured the services of
MR. Robson to show the property—we presume when the Olympic
season is over. Nothing could be more proper. ; Robson's own
health will be promoted on the banks of the “most pellucid of rivers,”
while, in reading aloud the above particulars, with which MR. D. will
supply him for the instruction of visitors, the great comedian will feel
thoroughly at home, inasmuch as he will imagine himself reciting one
of his own burlesques. He may even introduce, appropriately to the
Castle, the song of Ben Barter, with the burden—
“With a Chip-chase, cherry-cho, folderol de ride, 0."
MR. Robson's kind consent to show the estate does him great credit,
and Mr. Punch trusts that MR. R. will derive as much amusement
from his novel occupation as Mr. P. has done from the above delightful
announcement. The single part of it which he does not quite appre-
ciate is the reference to the Heraldry of the herons, and he can
explain it only by supposing that in the advertisement there is some-
thing herroneous.

Now, what a good-for-nothing spiteful Girl that JEMIMA must have been, when her kind Mistress (who could not put up with her goings-on any
longer) gave her a Month's Warning, to serve her so with the Palmer's Candle, pretending the Spring slipped accidentally.
ACCIDENTS AND OFFENCES.
At Lewes Assizes, the other day, a poor young man was indicted for
the manslaughter of his mother. He had—having received a medical
education—been in the habit of administering to her hydrocyanic acid
for the relief of sickness. She died, after having taken what was con-
ectured to be an overdose, poured out by the merest, accident. For
aving been º: to have had the misfortune to kill his mother—
whom he fondly loved—in the earnest endeavour to prolong her life,
this good son was by some justice, justices, or coroner's jury, no
matter which—sent to take his trial as a felon! There was not the
slightest proof that he had given an excessive dose; and he was of
course acquitted. But even if he had made a fatal blunder, it would
have been not...only unintentional, but most pitiably the reverse of
intentional. Who but a fool would presume culpable negligence in
such a case? Who with a particle of benevolence, with a grain of
sense, would have sent such a case for trial? Aggravate the unspeak-
able Fiº of that dutiful unfortunate son by placing him in a felon's
dock! What dense stupidity, and what monstrous cruelty!
Melancholy as this case was, the evidence for the prosecution can
hardly well be conceived to have afforded occasion for merriment. A
articular point in it, however, seems to have wonderfully diverted the
earers, who may have known the reason why. The fun, however, in
the following question put to a surgeon about the strength of prussic
acid, will be generally considered inscrutable:—
“The Lord CHIEF JUSTICE. What do you say is the difference between a ‘minim’
and a “drop?" (A laugh.)”
Where’s the wit? Again—we quote the Post:—
“SERJEANT BALLANTINE, to the witness. If you were told to
many minims, should you give him so many “drops?’ (A laugh.)
“Witness. Certainly not. (Renewed taughter.)”
What joke is there in the question as to the difference between a
minim and a drop?. A minim is a drop of uniform size measured by a
aduated glass, a drop is a variable quantity dropped out of a bottle.
#. is no quibble or equivocation in the words, and nothing loath-
some in the ideas. What did the gentle dulness of Lewes see to
laugh at?
give a patient so
But even if MR. MERRYMAN, in MERRYMAN's motley, had stood in
the witness-box, grinning from ear to ear, the piteousness of the case
might have hindered his grimaces from setting on barren spectators to
laugh too. . Sorrow and indignation would possess any honest heart at
the sight of a son standing his trial for felony, because he met with a
mischance in practising the Fifth Commandment... No doubt there
are those who would insist on ºf responsibility in all cases of
accidental homicide, with a view to public safety, and an especial eye
to their own. “Prevent mistakes irrespectively of right or wrong.
Never mind abstract justice—mercy, consideration, compassion be
blanked' Punish a blunder as you would a crime. Treat an unfor-
tunate man as a guilty one for the protection of the community in
general, and particularly of myself.” This is the language of these
gentlemen; and it is the language of immoral selfishness. Trust
nobody who talks it, unless in trusting him you can rely on his pride,
vanity, covetousness, or other low motives. . Such language is also the
language of folly. it is calculated to deprive its utterer of medical
attendance in any case of danger. Surgeons are not likely to risk a
bold remedy, or venture a hazardous operation with the fear, in case of
unforeseen misadventure, of an indictment for manslaughter before
their eyes.
IO BACCHE
THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH has been fixing the price of cigars
in France. This is to vary from five centimes to fifty—say from a half-
penny to fivepence. It may be held, therefore, that for fivepence a
French gentleman may procure the very best cigar he need smoke.
Then why, in the name of all that is Detestable, can't Mr. Punch get
first-class weeds at the same price? Why has he to pay Ninepence, if
he wants the real thing that does him good? Of course there are
Penny Pickwicks and trash of that kind, but he smokes for enjoyment,
health, and soothing. MR. BRIGHT is a smoker, and ought to have
provided for this in the Treaty. Mr. Punch cannot trust himself to speak
freely on so outrageous a state of things. Why are there no good cheap
cigars in London? he asks once more: and Echo answers that there is
a “want of system” somewhere, though not of a system of imposition.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
JULY 30. , Monday. LoRD CLYDE, introduced by LoRD PUNCH,
took the oaths and his seat in the House of Lords, so that the saviour
of India, though far inferior in rank to CARDIGAN, or LUCAN, or
NoRMANBY, or WESTMINSTER, is now as good a man as most of the
bishops, as Jones Loyſ), or as WERNoN SMITH. But Lord PUNCH
begs to say that he has no notion of leaving things where they are, and
that he recommends those who have the means º the Fountain
of Honour in play, to send a very handsome shower-bath of honour in
the direction of LoRD CLYDE, or LoRD PUNCH may turn the stream of
his own indignation in the direction of the negligent parties. Fancy a
LUCAN having precedence over a Colin CAMPBELL!
LORD John Russell has sent out Lord DUFFERIN as our Commis-
sioner for settling the affairs of Syria. This nobleman is a very good
yachtsman, and a man who is good at yachting is generally good at
most other things. He is not—
“A slave,
Whose very soul would sicken at the wave,”
but usually a manly, wide-awake, intelligent, self-reliant fellow. One
of this class of Englishmen saved Tyre the other day, by putting his
vessel and his guns in such a position that the savage. Druses were
afraid to attack. We make no doubt that DUFFERIN will manage very
well. After this appointment had been announced, there was a row
originating with MR. HoRsMAN, who has got the combative element
strong upon him, and who insisted on speaking, and blew up the
SPEAKER himself for trying to put him down. Mr. Punch is far from
regarding MR. HoRSMAN with any red-tapey dislike, and on the con-
trary, holds that it is very desirable º upon occasion Members
should speak out their minds, and not let any bureaucratic swagger
and self-conceit be too strong for them. But there is reason in roastin
of eggs, and also in roasting of Ministers, and MR. HoRsMAN shoul
be temperate. At present the Wild Horsman is about as terrible an
apparition to an English Minister as the Wild Huntsman to a German
peasant; but the chief end and object of a British Senator is not the
scaring one of the QUEEN’s servants into a fit.

Talking about the Fortifications, the Monster missed the opportunity
of making a good and vulgar joke. SIR CHARLEs NAPIER objected to
the proposed defences, at a certain place called Browndown, and the
Monster HERBERT replied, admitting the difficulty of getting there.
If he had chosen to be at once low and irrelevant, he might have said,
that the interruptions to the yote for the Fortifications money made
the real difficulty in . a Brown down; but we are very glad that
he was not so coarse and objectionable. The Indian Army Fusion Bill
Debate was resumed, and new objections were raised to the scheme,
and a division took place, which Mr. Punch records, in order to show
how many Members thought it worth while to stay and discuss the
gravest business now before Parliament. SIR. J. FERGUsson's motion,
in opposition to a plan which LORD PALMERSTON, declared to be so
important that he would sit till Christmas to carry it, was rejected by
88 to 50. Had there been a personal squabble, or some trumpery
matter into which personality could be imported, the division would
have been a couple of hundred on each side. The struggle on the Bill
was protracted; but, PALMERSTON, saying that as long as health and
strength permitted, he would resist a factious opposition, the House
went into Committee, and the Bill passed through it. SIR CHARLEs
Wood promised that all pledges given to ...' the Indian soldiers,
or in connection with the local army, should be faithfully redeemed.
Tuesday. LoRD LYTTLETON opposed the New Zealand Bill; but the
Government think it rather important that the Land question should
be set at rest, as a system of º which is illustrated by the
occasional killing the tenant for life, and eating the cross remainders
over, is rather in arrear of the age. So the Bill was passed
LoRD John Russell was asked, whether the EMPEROR OF THE
FRENch had not sent an uncommonly affectionate letter to this
country, as stated by the Morning Post. LoRD John said that such
was the fact, but that, as the letter was strictly private, he could not
produce it. The following day, of course, the letter was in all the
newspapers. Mr. Punch avows himself greatly touched by his ".
Brother's missive, especially by the piquant bit: , “Eh, bien, LoRD
PALMERSTON knows me; and when I say a thing, he will believe it.”
Mr. Punch is rejoiced that the EMPEROR means nothing but peace,

liberty, conquest in France, and cordial co-operation with England;
and in order that England may be worthy of such affection, she-just
as a loving wife educates herself up to be worthy of her husband—will
fortify herself with every increase of strength that may tend to place
her on an equality with her adorer...Then, to pursue the j
metaphor, they will converse delightfully, because they will thoroughly
understand one another.
ColoneL FRENCH had been reading the Rejected Addresses, and had
been evidently inspired by the imitation of TöM MooRE:-
“For dear is the Emerald Isle of the Ocean,
Whose daughters are fair as the foam of the wave,
Whose sons, unaccustomed to rebel commotion,
Though joyous, are sober—though peaceful, are brave.
The Shamrock their Olive, sworn foe to a quarrel,
Protects from the thunder and lightning of rows,
Their sprig of shillelah is nothing but laurel,
That flourishes rapidly over their brows.”
With these convictions strong upon him, the gallant Colonel de-
manded that the Irish should É. allowed to form Volunteer Corps.
MR. CARDwell, for Government, said that we did not distrust Irish
loyalty, but really —. Up sprang MR. MAGUIRE, and testified to
the extreme advantage of arming Ireland, by stating that if the
French invaders came, they would not be received by the Irish as foes.
LoRD PALMERSTON is not the man to let such a speech go unimproved,
and on division, 86 to 30 voted against Colonel FRENch, or rather,
the French Colonel. MR. EwART made an attempt to get Members to
confine their discussion of the Principle of a Bill to certain stages
thereof, instead of mixing up big and little matters in the present
ſeminine fashion. But beyond a grumbling admission that things were
badly managed, nothing came of MR. EwART's proposals. It occurs,
also, to Mr. Punch, that an arbitrary rule might be difficult of observ.
ance. The extinct Reform Bill had no principle for people to speak
on, and therefore, on MR. EwART's plan, must have been destroyed in
solemn silence. The House treated itself to a Count Out, materially
promoted by some oratory from MR. HENNEssy.
Wednesday. There was a fight over the Metropolis Local Manage.
ment, Bill...MR. BRADy, Member for Leitrim, and Licentiate of the
Apothecaries Söciety, led the attack; but what this Hibernian AEscu.
lapius has to do with the London parishes, it is not very clear. How.
ever, the Licentiate had only 13 votes, what he would call “a dirthy
thirteener.” Various clauses moved by private Members were rejected,
and the dynasty of the Board of Works was confirmed in all its irre-
sponsible tyranny... The despots, however, had better beware—there is
yet existing the window in Whitehall which let in a new light upon
the duties of sovereigns.
Thursday. The Lords merely shoved on business at a capital speed,
§ became sportsmen who had but nine days,between them and St.
rouse.
In the Commons, SIR GEORGE Bowy ER (copy the address, in order
to remember that our friend the Cardinal's Cross-Bearer and the Pope's
apologist is now a Baronet) tried to get up a story against GARIBALDI,
and LoRD John's tone, as he replied that he had no information on the
subject, was more supercilious than usual, and we can hardly blame his
manifestation of contempt. Bowy ER must be put into a curricle with
NoHMANBy, and then, if Mr. Punch holds the whip, he flatters himself
that he will “make the raw material fly.” -
The debate on the Fortifications followed. MR, LINDsay, the ship-
builder, opposed them, and was perfectly happified by the EMPEROR's
letter. HENRY BERKELEY thought we ought to defend ourselves with
Qur own gºod right arms, a bit of idiotcy that was very properly
derided. . The Monster had every confidence in the EMPEROR's inten.
tions, but “circumstances were sometimes stronger than men.” MR.
BRIGHT §: MR. LINDsAy, and described those who had advocated
the fortifications as a Set of Lunatics, for which MR. HoRsMAN, casti-
fºliº to the House of Commons, laid into MR. BRIGHT pretty
eartily; . There was a long debate, and after LoRD PALMERston had
declared that the best way to maintain peace was to be in a position to
Gefend ourselves against insult, a division was taken, and there were
for Fortifying 268, against it 39.
Friday. For reasons of his own, which anybody may ascertain by
sending a directed and stamped envelope and a £10 note, Mr. Punch
knocks the report of this day's doings into the middle of next week.
RESTORATIVE IN SLUMBER.
Mong the most wonderful of
the inventions of the present
day are the patent magnetic
brushes and combs, in which
an advertising philosopher,
to quote his own words, has
most beautifully developed
the mysterious power of the
magnet. This power, as de-
veloped by that philosopher
in his brushes, is indeed truly
mysterious. it is exerted by
a magnet enclosed within the
back of the brush; and acts
as a remedy for grey hair,
and also for weak or fallin
hair, and besides, for neural.
gia, nervous headache, rheu-
matism, stiff joints, &c. The
magnet is supposed to ope-
rate, in .."; greyness, by
its attraction for iron. Per-
fect hair contains iron. Grey
hair does not contain iron.
The magnet attracts the iron
which the grey hair does not
contain. According to this
theory, therefore, the magnet
raises the oxide of iron out of the blood, and draws it up into the
interior of each hair. How easily this is to be effected any fool may
convince himself by taking the blackest hair and the strongest magnet
he can get, and trying how much of the hair the magnet will lift. Or
he may chop the hair in minute pieces, and see if they will not stick
to the magnet like iron filings. Qf course neuralgia, nervous headache,
rheumatism, stiff joints, and the numerous diseases comprehended
under the head of, &c., are caused by an excess of iron, which the
magnet eliminates from the blood.
As oxide of iron is rust, it might naturally be feared that the use of
magnetic brushes would turn the hair rusty; but experience has
proved that there is no ground for this apprehension.
. The success which has been obtained by the magnetic brush has
induced Pºnch to devise a much more eligible invention for the same
purpose. This is a magnetic nightcap, which consists of soft cotton,
enclosing a delicate mesh, or network of very fine magnetic steel
wire...The immense superiority of this elegant contrivance is obvious
from the consideration that the hair of the person who sleeps in the
magnetic nightcap is exposed all night to the action of the magnetic
fluid, a fluid much more efficacious than any other capillary fluid
for beautifying the hair, which it affects by a peculiar capillary
attraction. -
During the day, the magnetic nightcap is folded up and enclosed in
a neat iron casket, or it may be kept in an old saucepan or teakettle.
The object of these precautions is to prevent its magnetism from
escaping, which happens whensoever a magnet is not in action. The
iron armature of the magnetic brush answers the same purpose; but
unscientific ladies often forget to remove it when tº: use the brush,
of which, in that case, it monopolises the virtue; whereas no such
mistake can possibly be made with the magnetic nightcap.
Neuralgia, rheumatism, stiff joints, and &c., are much more effec.
tually cured by the magnetic nightcap than they can possibly be by
instruments which, subjecting the head for a few minutes only to the
influence of magnetism, can extract but little iron from it at a time.
Worn on the night after the most copious indulgence at the festive
board, the magnetic nightcap will be found a never failing§.
against a headache the next morning. It is therefore invaluable to the
gourmand and votary of Bacchus. -
The magnetic nightcap may be, had beautifully embroidered and
adorned with a splendid tassel. All those gentlemen and ladies whom
the cap will fit are recommended to wear it.
Archery and Rifle Practice.
THE Rifle in the hands of Englishmen will soon be a weapon sup-
plying the place of the ancient long-bow. It will be necessary to make
a corresponding change in a popular idiom—to call, for example, our
wonderful spirit-storytellers, long rifle-shots.
GIVE IT 'EM.
Punch reads paragraphs stating that the savage Druses. "claim
affinity with the Scotch.” This is all bosh. . But he is decidedly of
opinion, that the sooner the Druses are scotch'd the better.
DARING FEATS OF HORSMAnship.
THE Honourable Member for Stroud has acquired considerable
celebrity by putting his spoke in the wheel of the Government.

SOLDIERING AND SHOPPING.
Your attention, if you please, ladies, to the following short paragraph
which we take for your perusal from a morning contemporary, whose
columns being devoted more to politics and commerce may not be so
well familiar to you as are those of Punch:-
* A considerable number of the principal tradesmen of the West End have met
and agreed to close their establishments early on Saturday afternoon, so as to give
the young persons in their employ the benefit of a fair evening's holiday. This is
a gracious and considerate resolution, and one that the public, which has helped on
the Early Closing Movement by its warm approval, will not fail to sanction and
support. It is proposed to close the shops on Saturdays at four in the winter and
at five in the summer months. These hours are not too early, if the young people
are to get out for a breath of air in the fields, or for a couple of hours' Volunteer
drill. A great deal might be said in favour of two o'clock all the year round; but
the measure is an innovation in the retail trade of London, and it is wise not to
attempt too much. Of course it would be hopeless to attempt to carry out a
measure of this kind against the wishes of the fair patrons of trade. But there is
the less reason to suppose that this will be withheld, inasmuch as the proposed
arrangement is to some extent an act of deference to their wishes. The Rifle Corps
of the Metropolis, as we all know, are to a large extent constituted of young men
employed in houses of business, and every one must wish that they may have in
weekly drill opportunities of healthful active exercise while they qualify themselves
to become, in case of need, defenders of their country. If then the ladies generally
will kindly countenance a change which has been actively promoted by some who
are the ornaments of their sex, the transition to new and better arrangements will
be easily accomplished, and here, as so often happens with seeming difficulties, it
nºy a gue le premier pas quicoſite.”
Gallantry forbids, ladies, that we should think that any one of you
can be otherwise than sensible; and we hold therefore it cannot be
"against your wishes” that they who would, if need be, fight in your
defence should be well qualified to do so. Now counter-jumping may
be labour, but it is not manly exercise; and although in some i:
the muscles may be º by it, no one can regard it as fit
practice for a soldier. Unless therefore young shopmen have oppor-
tunities of drill, it is impossible that they can be relied upon as Rifle-
men. Volunteers they may be, but they cannot be effectives; and if
the army were recruited from their ranks, our forces might be called
more fittingly our weaknesses. With their eyesight dulled and dimmed
by long confinement in close shops, “judging distances” can be by
no means easy work to them; and blunted as their faculties must be by
overwork, they cannot without practice be trained to act as sharp-
shooters. .
It rests with youthen, ladies, to assist the Volunteer, and the Earl
Closing movements by desisting from §. shoppin after two o'cloc
on Saturdays, and after five, as far as feasible, on other evenings of the
week., Let every mother of a family who has a wish to see her family
defended from invasion, not only rigidly abstain from shopping late
herself, but take care to teach her daughters, as they grow, to do as
she does., “Shop Early” should be one of the first texts in a girl's copy-
book, and no pains should be spared in impregnating her mind with it.
Every “bargain” which is bought after two o'clock on Saturdays
deprives a Rifleman, or would-be one, of practice at his drill, and
diminishes thereby the defences of the country.
On the score too of humanity, late shopping should be stopped, and
the Cruelty Prevention . should see to it. To imprison fine
young men upon fine summer afternoons cannot be regarded as other-
wise than torture to them, and no one but a Bomba in Crinoline would
perpetrate it. The fair sex will deserve to be considered the unfair
sex, if they do not let our shopmen have the liberty they ought to
have: Indeed the woman who would lay her hands upon a shopman,
and forcibly detain him from proceeding to his drill, must in very truth
* as a Creature, whom it were gross flattery to call a Selfish
retch.
THE SPIRITUAL “HUME”-BUG.
GILEs SQRoggins's Journal, or the Spiritual Magazine, keeps
harping on the assertion, that Mr. Punch has been assured by several
gentlemen with whom he is concerned or connected, of their belief in
the reality of some alleged spiritual manifestations, witnessed by them
in the presence of certain mediums. This assertion is altogether
untrue. On the contrary, the gentlemen impertinently named by our
indelicate and credulous, if not fallacious, contemporary unite in
assuring Mr. Punch of their conviction, that the phenomena exhibited
to them asº"; were all humbug... Mr. Punch is sorry to inform
the Spiritual Magazine, that one of the mediums whose séances his
friends have attended has been described to Mr. Punch, by a compe-
tent judge of deportment, as “a low American.” Of two mediums of
the other, sex, the old party who asks for “sperrits,” and her con-
federate the young female, an excellent physiognomist who tested their
pretensions, speaks with the utmost contempt and scorn. This gen-
tleman reports, that their performances are transparent fudge, and that
they themselves are a couple of rank impostors. The Spiritual Maga-
zine directly accuses Mr. Punch of impugning what he knows to be the
truth. , Mr. Punch must reply, “You’re another!” Regarding him.
self and his friends, the Spiritual Magazine, at any rate, asserts what
it does not know to be true. GILes ScRoggins's Journal, however,
may, to be sure, believe whatsoever it imagines. It may believe that
Mr. Punch believes in the spiritual manifestations which he gainsays.
It may believe that it believes in them itself when it really only wishes
to believe them, and is vexed º the incredulity at which its own faith
stumbles. It may be weak without being mendacious; but, wilfully or
foolishly, it belies Mr. Punch. Certainly Spiritualists may claim credit
for the innocence of imbecility. They do not seem to know what
scientific demonstration is. If they knew, they would not expect their
miracles to be believed by any but the most ignorant of the vulgar,
high and low, until performed before competent observers, and sub-
jected, in the presence of those judges, to the test of crucial experi-
ment. When next Mr. Punch's contributors happen to be all assem-
bled together, will any spirit, or “sperrit,” at the request of any
medium, or of its own hook, come and rebuke our incredulity by
pulling all our noses?
FORWARD CHITS.
“Among the Bills to come before the House of Lords the other day,
I notice an Infants' Marriage Act Amendment Bill. Well, I’m sure,
what next! What can the poor little things want to marry for, except
wedding-cake, which would be far too rich for them, and make them
ill? They had much better be kept to their tops and bottoms. The
women of Andover and the neighbourhood, I am happy to see, have
petitioned against any alteration in the law of marriage, Very much
to their credit. Of course the alteration they objećt to is that which
is to allow infants to marry. People ought to be ashamed of them:
selves for putting such things into children's heads. Talk of old
women, indeed! Parliament would never dream of letting infants
marry one another, if all the Members were of the age and sex of
“Your humble Servant,
“MARTHA GRUNDY.”
A Rap at the Rappers.
We hear that several of the Spirit-rappers have written to, Mn.
GLADstone, complaining of the damage he is doing to their trade by
his recent imposition of a higher tax on spirits. The tax is now so
heavy that the rappers say the spirits are most terribly depressed '. it,
so much so, that the efforts which are made to raise them are daily
more and more becoming unsuccessful.

DEAR–As PossIBLE!”
THE IMPERIAL BILLET-DOUX AND THE ANSWER,
The EMPEROR to John BULL (care of Count PERSIGNY).
My dear MR. BULL,~Let me first beg to say,
That my letter is solely intended for you :
But as crowned heads must act in a round-about way,
I transmit through Count PERSIGNY this billet-dour.
I’ve been pained to the heart at your lending your ear
To “Old Parties” who charge me with all sorts of crimes:
But my genuine feelings I hope to set clear
In this letter which really is meant for the Times.
Don’t think in your eyes that I mean to throw dust,
But pray give full credit to all I aver:
There’s PALMERSTON knows I am worthy of trust,
And to him I am kindly allowed to refer.
'Pon my honour—a thing, which you know I hold dear,
Since I signed at Willefranche--with my back to the wall—
I have wished but for peace and for friendship sincere
With my excellent neighbours, and you above all.
Bless you, I never meant to take Nice and Savoy,
Till to º: so alarming Sardinia would go,
Annexation I really was driven to em *
(After all, they’re essentially French slopes, you know).
With my soldiers and ships, you say, Europe Ifrighten;
Europe ought to know better, and you too, mon cher;
Cherbourg's nothing, in fact, but a sort of French Brighton:
As for soldiers—I haven't one man I can spare.
Of invasion by Louis PHILIPPE did you dream?
Yet NAPOLEoN of peace as he was—just like me—
He’d more ships under sail than I have under steam—
And of troops, when all 's weighed, I have no more than he.
Indeed to speak plain, as a plain Emp'ror suits,
I’ve not nearly the force—land or sea—that I want;
What with China, Algiers, Rome, Gendarmes, sick, recruits,
Of bayonets I find myself frightfully scant.
Besides, you can't blame me for wishing to make
The best of the handful of men that I’ve got:
Less flatt’ring than yours is the view I must take.
You see what our troops are, I see what they’re not.
Then as to the East—'Pon my honour again—
The only instruction I gave THOUVENEL., .
Was, “Don’t put the sick gentleman out of his pain—”
He’s free to stay sick—so he doesn’t get well.
In Syria again—where such sad things, alas, occur;-
You blame me for the mischief I seek to repair:
MR. BULL, I’ve a heart, and it burned at the massacre
Of my dear Christian brethren, now suff'ring there—
Till I wasn't exactly myself, and my feelings
Perhaps may have hurried me rather too far. -
Did I say “twenty thousand?” But Christian appealings
Are things I could never resist—so they are.
"Twas º urged the proposed expedition:
What profit from Syria could I expect?
M; troops would have gone on their peace-making mission,
f you hadn't stept in, and the enterprise checked.
No–I say the same thing I said eight years ago,
4- 'Twas very soºn after the second December)—
Empire e'est la pair” was my text at Bordeaux,
And how I’ve lived up to that text just remember.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I HAVE conquests to make—but mon cher, they’re in France:
She’s not yet nearly conquered, I’m sorry to say,
Though material interests have had every chance,
And “L’Empire,” on the Bourse, has been really “la paye.”
In Romagna and Tuscany, much to my sorrow,
I had ties which prevented my acting with you;
But for Naples and Rome—say the word, and to-morrow,
I'm your man: make your game: and I’ll back you, true blue.
Do let us, at last, act like brother to brother:
And each pin his faith on what either may swear:
Not like rogues on the watch each to trip up the other,
And bone all the swag they, in honour, should share!
There—I’ve told you my thoughts, without bunkum or blarney;
From a heart I have spoken of friendship chock full:
There are some men can stoop to soft-sawder and carney,
But I’m not one of that sort—believe me, cher BULL.
John BULL's Answer.
Dear EMPEROR, here’s my reply to your letter.
To a ream of soft words I prefer one hard fact.
And if you mean all that you say, why you’d better
Lose no time in putting your talk into act.
As to listening to what some “Old parties” have said of you,
I don't know at all what “Old parties” you mean.
My opinions I’ve formed, not from what I have read of you,
But—I’m sorry to say it—from what I have seen.
As a witness to character PAM you’d have summoned:
I'm afraid, if you called him, he might make denial;
And such witnesses often, when well cross-examined,
Only make matters worse for their friend who’s on trial.
And don't swear by “your honour;” the weight of a straw,
'Gºjnºt that oath would be heavy, as facts passed away show:
And "De non apparentibus.”—so says our law—
“Et non eristentibus, eaſt” est ratio.”
As for Nice and Savoy, p'rhaps 'twas nothing but proper,
o annex 'em—I whisper no word of duresse:
The encroachment was nothing, but wherefore the whopper?
Why the positive “No,” which I found to mean “Yes?”
And as for your armies, and Cherbourg, and steamers;
We needn't waste time in discussing their figure:
But please don’t set me and my lads down as dreamers,
If ours should grow big, as yours keep growing bigger.
Volunteers and Defences you think quite disgusting,
As implying mistrust ºyour word—All my eye'
I’ll trust you as far as I see you; so trusting,
You’ll excuse me for keeping my cartridges dry.
I have heard of oaths lightly sworn, lightly broken
Professions that ne'er to performances came;
Of vows cancelled almost before they were spoken,
Intentions now paving a place I’ll not name:
But in one thing at least all are safe in confiding—
And that’s a man's self, to himself that is true;
One promise at least gives assurance abiding—
That’s where heart says to hand, “You back me, I’ll back you?”
And such is the trust that I sooner would lean on,
Than the oiliest words MocQUARD's pen can contrive;
Tº: flumm'ry on others; but, please offer me none,
n diet more solid my friendship must thrive.
I have watched both your games, Sire, at home, making slaves;
Abroad—as you said and we’ve seen—making free;
While you cozened the fools, and bought over the knaves—
inder which of these heads do you classify me?”
What has been may recur. Should a Brummagem CAESAR
Try a dash at John BULL, after conqu'ring the Gauls;
I intend he shall find the achievement a teaser
What with Armstrongs, long Enfields, and stout Wooden)Walls.
Suspicions I may feel, but not apprehensions,
As long as I’ve hands and a trigger to pull;
By deeds and not words I interpret intentions:
And so I remain, yours, etcetera, JoHN BULL.
AFTER-DINNER ARGUMENT.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to the EARL OF HARDwigkº,
and requests his Lordship's notice to the following observations, which
are reported to have fallen lately from his Lordship's lips:—
“Application had been made to him as Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, to
allow an organisation of the humbler classes of society, but he had peremptorily
refused; and he should continue to do so, because he held that that most intelligent,
useful, respectable and important body of men had duties of another kind to perform.
If they wished to carry a musket, or enter any military volunteer force, the militia
regiments of the country were short of something like 50,000 men, and were ready
to receive these most worthy candidates for military service. He also thought there
was a great difference between arming men of property and men of none. He said
not one single word against the character of the working classes, on the contrary
he held it in the highest veneration; but if a weapon were given to a man who had
no property, whether it were a civil weapon or a military one, his natural tendency
would be to acquire a property which he had not got."
These remarks are said to have been delivered after dinner, and
|Mr. Punch can see no reason to disbelieve that statement. But for it,
indeed, Mr. Punch would find it difficult to credit that LoRD HARD-
wicke could so far have lost his senses as to say what is reported of
him. The enemy that steals away the brains of those who put it in
their mouths must clearly have abstracted those belonging to his
|Lordship before he could have uttered such unreasonable nonsense.
To say one has the “highest veneration” for a class of men whom one
believes to have a “natural tendency” to robbery, surely is to show
that one is not in one's right mind, and has for the time at least said
goodbye to one's senses. To imagine too that persons of importance
and intelligence, and who are useful and respectable members of society,
are not fit to be trusted with possession of a rifle, this clearly is an
insult which applies to all the Wolunteers who have enrolled themselves,
and who hardly can lay claim to better qualities than these. It is no
excuse to say, that poor men if they please may enter the militia. The
militia is a paid service, and the Volunteer is not; and humble as they
be, there are many of the “humbler classes” who are much too proud
to enter it.
Commenting on Lord HARDwicke's after-dinner speech, the Daily
News observes:—
| “We will not do the late Government or the Tory party as a body the injustice of
supposing that Lord HARDwick E represented them in his speech; but that a man
in his position should have ventured on such language shows the sentiments which
many of them really entertain towards the working classes, whom they affect to
K. but conspire to crush. After dinner and over their wine the ruck of the
ory party still think and speak, as in their provincial circles they still act, as they
thought and spoke and acted half a century ago."
| “In vino veritas” is an ancient axiom, and is as true now as it was
a hundred years ago. But would it not be well if Tories like LoBD
HARDwicke were to take the pledge of total abstinence from public
speaking, seeing that perhaps the weakness of their reasoning seems
somewhat to betray their imbibition of strong drink.
INO BULWARKS FOR EWER |
THERE is something in the subjoined argument, advanced the other
evening by Mr. BRIGHT against the expediency of fortifying our
dock-yards. Speaking of MR. WHITwoRTH, the Hon. Member for
Birmingham is reported to have said:—
“He told me last night, that he would undertake to throw a 70 lb. shell, filled
with molten iron, six miles. I see agentleman opposite who seems startled at that
assertion. MR. Whitworth said he believed he could reach seven miles, but would
guarantee six. The whole system of warfare is about to undergo a change as great
probably, as that which took place when gunpowder was first used, (Hear.) And
| yet you have your Government in its fussy activity (a laugh), not having the courage
to tell the people the truth upon these matters, rushing day after day into all kinds
of expenses, not knowing in the least that all they are now doing will twelve
months hence be found to be of no avail, and will have to be done over again."
Don't *. §§ arsenals this year with defences which some new
shell may explode the next. This advice is not devoid of reason. But
what if the new shell should not happen to be invented, and an enemy
should bombard our ill-defended Portsmouth and Plymouth with the
shells now in vogue in the meanwhile P Suppose the new shell should
happen to be invented, would Portsmouth and Plymouth, with their
existing fortifications, he less liable to bombardment than they are
now * If we cannot tºº fortify Portsmouth and Plymouth, we
had better dismantle them. hy run up a tailor's bill, when you may
as well go naked! It may be all very well for a Member of the Society
of Friends to stick to his costume, but when the question is about
covering our military and naval magazines and repositories, we may as
well be out of the world as out of the fashion. Don't wash your hands
now, because they will be dirty again by-and-by. Don't wash them
#; because they will be as dirty as ever to-morrow morning.
If Friend BRIGHT acts personally on this principle, his best friends
must surely refuse to shake hands, with him. He ought to receive a
compulsory order of the Bath, and in case of his perseverance in the
neglect of ablution, to be indicted for a nuisance.

PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXVI.-TuF REIGN OF EDWARD THE THIRD.
He long reign of this sove-
reign, on whom such showers
of eulogium have beenpoured
by the historians, forms a
most important era in the
history of costume, and may
therefore claim to occupy a
few leaves of our Book.
From the changes which are
noticeable not less in the
civil than the military habits,
more markedly discernible
than those, perhaps, of any
other, from the days of
WILLIAM THE CoNQUEROR
to the knights of . Good
QUEEN BEss. In lieu of
the long tunics and robes of
the last reigns, a closely
fitting body garment but-
toned down the front like
the jacket of our “Buttons,”
and extending as far as the
middle of the thigh, was
adopted as the usual dress of
the nobility. Being made of
soft materials it was called a
cote hardie, and its rich
embroidery was set off and
enhanced by the splendid
belt of knighthood, which
was commonly worn over it
#. girt across the hips.
The sleeves of this new gar-
ment were fastened with a row of buttons between the wrist and
elbow, whence depended a long slip of cloth, usually of white colour,
which was called a tippet. Cotes with short sleeves were, however,
often worn, the fore part of the arm being covered with an under-
garment buttoned with a row of buttons like the cote. A long mantle
was occasionally worn over this dress, fastened on the right shoulder
by four or five large buttons, so that, when suffered to hang loose, it
covered the bearer completely to the feet. In general, however, the
front part was thrown back over the left shoulder, and hung in folds
behind in the manner of a cope. Very frequently the mantle was
indented at the edges in the form of leaves, but the reason why it was
so history leaves us now to guess.
MR. STRUTT, who on the subject of costume is (next to Punch)
the cock of the literary walk, observes that to their frequent tourna-
ments and pageants the English chiefly owed the quick succession of
new fashions, which especially distinguished the reign of this old King.
The knights who attended came from all parts of the Continent, and
endeavoured to cut out each other in their clothes as much as to cut
into one another in the lists. In a wardrobe roll, still legible by those
who have good eyes, and have a knowledge of black letter, an order is
given for a jupon of blue tartan, “powdered,” that is, embroidered
thickly, “with blue ſº and decorated with buckles and pendents
of silver gilt; ” also for a linen doublet, “bordered round the skirts
and sleeves with long green cloth, embroidered with clouds and vine
branches of gold” (rather a queer mixture), and with the motto, “It
is as it is,” which is said to have been of KING EDward's own dic-
tating, and is a clear proof of his Majesty's great literary attainments.
Upon another garment made for Royal use this interesting distich is
commanded to be stitched—
“Hayl hay the why the swan,
By Gode's soul I am the man.”
What the wearer was the man for, is left to be conjectured: indeed
the meaning of the couplet is so doubtfully perceptible, that we think,
were the word “goose º as a substitute for “man,” the introduc-
tion of the “swan” would, on the score of its antithesis, perhaps be
more excusable.
Of course these continental fashions found but little favour in the eyes
of the old gentlemen, who used to talk to one another about the good
old times, Sir, when *...". were Englishmen, and knew better
i’ fackins than to ape those foreign monkeys. The clergy too were
censurers of what they doubtless termed the “backsliding” of their
flocks, and indeed they went so far as to beliken them to devils, for
their devilish conceits. Says Dowglas, Monk of Glastonbury, speaking
of the weathercocky ways of the beau monde:–
“The Englishmen haunted so much unto the foly of strangers that every year

included the jagged or *::::

made mention in the time of
HENRY THE THIRD. But we
find no special record of it in
this reign, and we prefer
therefore to assume. that it
had been abandoned, being
deservedly considered the
quintis-sence of absurdity.
Such indeed was the ex-
travagance of fashion at this
period, that in 1363 the House
of Commons made a formal
complaint about the matter,
and actually an Act of Parliament was passed to prohibit the excessive
usage of rich clothing, which it was apprehended would impoverish
the nation. Among the sumptuary rules which our Collective Wisdom
thought proper to propose, we learn that—

IMPROVED FROM A Wrry Curious
“Furs of ermine, and lettice," and embellishments of pearls, excepting for a
head-dress, were forbidden to any but the royal family and nobles who had upwards
of £1000 a year. Cloths ºff". and silver, and habits embroidered with jewellery,
lined with pure miniver and other costly furs, were permitted only to knights and
ladies whose incomes exceeded 400 marks per annum. Knights whose income
exceeded 200 marks, and squires possessing £200 in lands or tenements, were per-
mitted to wear cloths of silver or of wool of not more than the value of six marks
the whole piece; but all persons under the rank of knighthood, or of less property
than the last mentioned, were confined to using cloth worth not more tº: four
marks, and were prohibited from wearing embroidery and silks, or any kind...of
ornaments of silver, gold, or jewellery. Rings, buckles, ouches, girdles, and
ribands, were all forbidden decorations; and the penalty annexed to the infringe-
ment of this statute was the forfeiture of the dress or ornament so worn.”
This Act, it would seem, was directed not so much against the ladies
as the gentlemen, although the former, we are told, “dyd far outstrip
# men in all manmere of arraies and curious apparell.” Perhaps the
House, however, was afraid to risk the chance of a female revolution,
if they ventured much to interfere with ladies' dresses. We tremble
to consider what a fearful reign of terror would infallibly result from
such a daring venture now, and what a number of our members would
be sure to get their ears boxed if they made it (say) illegal to wear
military heels, or lessened by one inch the miles of crinoline now
staggered under.
The Scots, who seldom have committed great excesses in expense,
and who too well know the worth of siller to be so silly as to waste, it
in extravagance of dress, had a rhyme about this period which ran (or
halted) thus:–
“Long beinds hertiless, +
Peyntedt hoods witless,
º: graceless, .
Maketh Englonde thriftless.”
From this and other evidence, it appears that beards were generally
worn both long and pointed, and that capuchons with long peaks or
tails were made to match. Whether these pointed cloak floods were
ever brought in front to protect a cherished beard from dirt, or dust,
or wet, is a point which a debating club would do well to dilate upon.
Our own idea inclines to think they sometimes were, and we recom-
mend the dodge to the notice of the swells who seem to spend their
life now in growing long cat's-whiskers, which on Derby days or driz-
zling ones, might be saved much hirsute injury by being bottled up in
beard-bags.
* Disciples of Lord MAMSBERRY who are heedless of orthography, maybe informed
that the word “lettice" when written with an “i" does not mean the pleasant
vegetable, but an unpleasant little animal, described by CotoRAve as “a beast of a
whitish grey colour.”
+ Some writers read “shirtless,” but we are not so “hertiless,” or heartless, as
to copy them.
! “Peynted” may mean either pointed or painted: it being considered quite
the thing to paint or decorate the hood, as well as the cote hardie, with flowers and
quaint mottoes, as we have above described. Whether the word “dunce" was ever
painted on the hood, we are unable to determine, but the epithet of “withess"
almost makes us think it may have been.

at last over—we lay in our
winter's stock. As we kick
off sheet and counterpane
in composing ourselves to
slumber, we remember what
a load of bed-clothes we
required during the frost,
and wonder if we shall want as much this time six months. Coals
and Blankets being thus brought within the scope of our considera-
tion, suggest the subscriptions which the benevolent are called upon
to disburse in order that their destitute fellow creatures may be
provided , with fuel and bedding. ... Ideas, of soup-kitchens, also
present themselves, and, in connection with them, the unhappy
people who want, them, that they may not starve and who must §
supplied with firing and flannel, lest they should freeze to death.
The present warm and sunshiny portion of the year is that, which
especially obtrudes on the thought of reflecting persons the fact
will therefore, also, in half-a-year's time or sooner, be wretchedly cold.
Heated as it were thus by the solar rays, Imagination beholds a vast
crowd of lean, wan, sallow, sunken-cheeked, hollow-eyed, shivering,
groaning, paral sed, convulsed, contorted, shrunken, tumid, and alto-
gether miserable men, women and children, who are not only fellow
creatures but fellow Christians most of them. Working people out of
employ, with their families, constitute the reality which thus fore-
shadows itself in a Midsummer Night's Dream. Working people—
but not all underpaid journeymen tailors, or distressed needlewomen, or
even well-paid bricklayers’ labourers on strike. These same working-
people out of employ, or in employment at starvation prices, include a
very considerable number of those labourers whose work lies in what
is called the vineyard. It is a fact that many of them are working
clergymen. These fellow Christians of ours, comprise a very large
number of Christian pastors—who may feed their flocks indeed with
spiritual nutriment, but themselves actually want bread. Numerous
fellow clergymen may be contemplated among these scarecrows by the
bloated or #. beneficent pluralist.
The above statements will be found to be warranted by the contents
of a little blue book which has lately been written by the Rev. W.
JERVIs, M.A., and published under the title of Startling Facts. MR.
JERVIs is Secretary to the Poor Clergy Relief Society, which advertises
for cast-off apparel wherewithal to clothe naked Priests and Deacons.
The demand for such aid may well be presumed from the fact, pro-
claimed in this work, that there are more than 5,000 Curates ministering
in the Church of England whose incomes do not average above £80
per annum, and as many as the same number of beneficed, Clergymen
whose clerical incomes are under £150 a year. Poor angels! This is
something like apostolic poverty—isn't it? -
The following are specimens of the entreaties and supplications of
various poor clergy for alms, as cited by the Rev. MR. JERVIs:—
“Within the last three months I have been wearing a coat in rags, and shoes
which, from inability to get them mended, let in water every time. I put them on ;
and for weeks together we have not been able to have a dinner from Sunday to
Sunday, but have been compelled to allow ourselves but two meals a day, and those
two composed of tea without sugar and bread without butter.” “I solemnly assure
you, that I have not food for more than to-day, and that I have not the means of
procuring it till Friday next.” “They " (an Incumbent's twelve children)." cannot
attend divine service on the Sabbath-day for want of clothes and shoes.”—“I ask to
be supplied gratuitously with a donation of clothing."-"We never can afford
animal food more than once a week.”—“Frequently" % is was a clergyman whose
wife was starved to death) “we have not had a mouthful of butcher's meat for
months together, and have felt really thankful that we had a potatoe."-" I have a
wife and seven children dependent on an income of £52 per annum, which I find
inadequate for the maintenance of my large family; and I am in great distress."
that large multitudes of our fellow creatures are hungry and naked, and c
Bishop, have you got a copper to relieve a poor clergyman?—a poor
clergyman, bishop, who has not tasted food all this blessed day.
That is the style, of solicitation to which scholars and gentlemen are
nearly reduced by clerical poverty. We shall have ministers of the
wealthy Church of England, lying about on the pavement, and illus:
trating the Gospel, which it is their vocation to preach, in coloured
chalk, and writing under the picture thus delineated “I am starving.”
Or, perhaps they will perambulate Cathedral closes in torm surplices,
singing psalms, in hopes to get a sixpence tossed to them out of the
dean's window. .
Statesmen object, that, if the Church revenues were divided equally
amongst the clergy of all ranks, there would be only £240 a year for
each parson; so that if there were no “blanks” in the Establishment,
there would be no “prizes.”. But what necessity is there for prizes;
What harm would be done, if the clergy were levelled down to £240
a-year a-piece? Is it credible that one soul the less would be saved
in consequence of that pecuniary arrangement?. Rich bishops and
deans are great ornaments to society, but they might be as useful as
St. PAUL on £240 per annum, as far as their utility depends upon their
incomes. In the meantime, could not dignitaries, who generally leave
large fortunes behind them, afford to endow a few ragged churches, to
be served by ragged clergymen, provided by MR. JERwis's society with
old clothes? “Startling Facts” is a book which ought to lie on every
prelate's library table.
THE BLOCKADE OF THE SESSION.
The Obstructives have been having a rare time of it in Parliament.
Not content with having put a stopper on Reform, they have impeded
every, useful measure of the Session, and the car of legislation has
been brought quite to a stand-still through the quantity of spokes—or,
more correctly, speeches—they have put into its wheels. T. Savings
Banks Bill easily they knocked upon the head; and though the Bank-
ruptcy Bill loudly was called for by the country, the Obstructives inter:
posed, and would not let it pass. Quite early in the Session they stopped
the measure for reforming the London Corporation; and now the same
fate seems to threaten the Bill proposed for strengthening our forces
in India. There is little doubt, indeed, they would have ended it lon
since, had not the PREMIER somewhat awed them by his dreadf
threat that the House should sit till Christmas rather than not
arry it.
Chief of the Obstructives is the clever MR. HoRsMAN, whose powers
of obstruction are really quite remarkable. If there be any truth in
the science of phrenology, we think were MR. HoRsMAN’s bumps to
be examined, he would be found to have a wondrous organ of obstruc-
tiveness. “MR. HoRsMAN's speech stops the way,” may be taken as
a summary of all the late debates, when anything important has been
ripe to be discussed. What his constituents, may think of him is a
point which “hath no magnitude” (as saith EucLID) in his eyes, and
which apparently he keeps out of sight as much as possible. Certainly
were justice done, to MR. HoRsMAN, it would be only fair to charge
him with having done more to prevent the course of legislation than
any other Honourable Member of the House; and the damage he has
caused to the interests of the country might be laid, before him in the
shape of a small Bill, which should enumerate as items the Bills lost
through his means. MR. HoRsMAN might be credited with the speeches
he has made (some of which, in point of eloquence, have been really to his
credit), and per contrà might be debited with all the valuable time which
he has taken up in talk, and the many useful measures he has thus
obstructed. The account we think should then be shown to his consti-
tuents, that they may see exactly what it is he owes to them. We
think were voters saddled with the legislative debts which their Mem-
bers owe the country, most§ when next he asked them for a
seat there would be some talk of unhorsing the Horsman.
The Diggings of Suez.
... At a late meeting of the Suez Canal Company, on the production of
its accounts 1,000,000 fr. were found to have been spent in the costs
of direction. Of this sum 500,000 fr. had gone for the journeys of
M. Lesseps. To this was added a further sum for furnishing that
gentleman's rooms at Paris; and, withal 400,000 fr. for the salaries of
the members of the direction, namely, of M. Lessers and one or two
associates. If M. Lesseps does not make a canal out of the Suez
excavation, he will have found it a mine.
A Spiritual Calling.
A MR. HuME professes to have the power of calling spirits from the
vasty deep, and shallow-minded persons put belief in his profession,
As profession is not always accompanied by practice, it would be well
if they would look a little deeper in the matter, for it may possibly
turn out that they are being Hume-bugged.

THINGs HAve come to A PRETTY PAss INDEED, when A DRAWING-Room TABLE JUMPs UP, AND AFTER PLAYING A TUNE on its
ACCORDION, offers Its HAND TO THE HouseMAID!—
(Now, witHouT ANY of The GAMMON OF PUTTING LIGHTs out, AND DARKENING THE ROOM, THIS REALLY did HAPPEN IN BROAD
DAYLIGHT-YoU NEEDN'T BELIEVE IT, OF COURSE, UNLESS YoU LIKE.)
A DUCR (0' DIAMONDS) OF A BONNET :
AMONG other highly interesting feminine intelligence, a fashionable
contemporary, the other day, informed us that—
retentious in their decoration; fewer flowers are
“Bonnets are just now less
worn, and those somewhat negligently; there is above all, a diminution in the
amount of the gilt ornaments to which we have frequently alluded, and they seem
likely to give way to another mode just coming into fashion: we mean imitations
of precious stones, which will afford a wider range for the display of taste, and have
a somewhat less appearance of tinsel. We may therefore expect shortly to have to
describe the imitations of some of the most celebrated diamonds, opals, rubies,
F. &c., which, if well executed, will throw much light around the heads of the
adies; but will, we are afraid, add materially to the weight and cost of their
chapeaux. We really think that BENEDICT & Co. ought to make a demonstration
against these continuous efforts to assault their purses, and try to convince their
better halves that imitated precious stones will only injure the naturally much
superior effect produced by themselves, who are the real jewels of the creation."
“Rich and rare were the gems she wore” is a bit of an old song with
which our lady readers may probably be conversant, but which, if this
new fashion become popular, will hardly be found applicable to those
who may be followers of it. All are not gems that glitter; and as we
hate shams, we certainly shall set our face against a fashion which
cannot be regarded as otherwise than sham-full. Our love for lovely
woman is very far too true for us to countenance a custom which puts
ought of false about her, and the light of Koh-i-Noors would find small
favour in our eyes if we fancied that those brilliants were of Brumma-
gem construction. Indeed even could we manage to view the gems as
enuine, they would not much enhance to us the value of their wearers.
olding as we do, that beauty unadorned is adorned the most, we really
should not more admire our wife in a new bonnet, which entitled her
in verity to be called a “duck o' diamonds.”. Nor do we think that
she herself would feel the happier for wearing it, for probably the
weight of it would soon give her a headache. -
e trust the ladies then will show the wisdom of their sex by taking
the advice which is given them in Punch, and neither wearing bonnets
trimmed with false jewels nor real ones. To carry half a stone or so of
precious stones upon one's head cannot well be other than a precious nui-
sance; and as it may prove, perhaps, a sort of capital punishment, we hope
that the fair sex will not suffer themselves to suffer it. Jewels as they
are to us, let them rest quite satisfied that we prize them for their own
sake, and not for their fine fashions, and that it is their precious selves
and not their precious stones we value. Were the dear creatures to
wear apeck of Koh-i-Noors apiece, they could not be more dear, though
they might be more expensive to us; and in the business-sounding
name therefore of “BENEDICT & Co.” (the Co. comprising fathers,
brothers, uncles, cousins, friends, and lovers of the sex) we protest
against our women wearing such rich things as may perhaps eventually
bring us to the poor-house.
THE SYSTEM OF KINDNESo.
THE liberal Government of the future, in pursuance of the policy of
constitutional benevolence, will be open to receive tenders for the
following Articles of Comfort and Luxury:—
Wenison for Workhouses.
Pommade for Prisons.
Smelling Salts for the Navy.
Eau-de-Cologne for HER MAJESTY's Land Eorces.
Crinoline for Female Refuges.
Sugar Candy for Charity Schools,
Caviare for the Million.
The Government does not pledge itself to accept the lowest tender.
A Fair Attempt.
Several jokes were made at the Dramatic Fancy Fair, and not the
worst of them was made by a small wag in our hearing, who noticing
how happy the young actresses all looked in their booths, said the
place reminded him of Boothia Felix.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
August 6. Monday. On the day when Paterfamilias is † to take
his family out of town, it may have been remarked by those who watch
domestic interiors, that there is pretty sure to be something disagree-
able before starting. P.F. himself, perhaps, loses his keys; and after
he has . for half an hour, and accused everybody of taking them,
he remembers that he left them, in the pocket of the pair of trousers
which is at the very bottom of the big corded trunk. Or Materfamilias
has collected and paid all the bills, as she thinks, when a dirty boy
comes with a peremptory message from an impertinent newsvendor
demanding one pound eighteen and threepence on the instant; an
Paterfamilias is furious at having to take the money out of what he
had put into his purse for the journey. Or the children seize the
opportunity—their legitimate guardians being all engaged in the last
... ramp about the house like wild cats, make unusual
and preternatural noises, Fºl. about things they ordinarily dare not
touch, and finally, just at the moment when P.F. is struggling frantic-
ally with a huge strap, and is irritable at not being quite sure that he
has read Bradshaw rightly, they become so outrageous that Louis A is
suddenly ordered into the back drawing-room, and threatened with no
end of Aunt and Church, Robert is savagely shoved into a chair and
forbidden to speak or move, and ARTHUR. retreats, to the stairs
howling from a sound box on the ear. Then Materfamilias turns irate
at these energetic police measures (though she has herself been
scolding the children incessantly for three hours), and making a short
answer to the next speech, receives a vindictive snub, and an order to
be kind enough to recollect who is the master of the house; and so
: the time for starting arrives, the holiday begins in pouting and
Sulks.
This is just the sort of thing that has been going on in the House of
ommons... We had nearly got to the end of the Session, and were
preparing for a jolly holiday, when discomfort and a row break out
there is a fight, and everybody is now thoroughly discontented, and
everybody is blowing up everybody else. Nay, Parliament is worse off
than the private family; for P. F. with all his irritation, is a kind old
fellow, and will not disappoint the household by postponing the
journey, whereas PALMERston now declares that the Members shall
not go out of town for a month, perhaps not for six weeks., Heavily
are they being punished for the weeks consumed in gabble at the
*. of the Session.
'o-night the Lords did mere machine-work, but the Commons had
THE ROYAL BLUE
AND YELLOW.
THE Seventh of August
1860, is a day which will
be everlastingly celebrated
in the annals of Scotland.
Latest posterity, as well as
the present generation, will
associate that memorable
anniversary with the Edin-
burgh Review, where the
QUEEN appeared as a Re-
viewer of the gallant Scotch
Volunteers. The contribu-
tors to this great Review,
composing the number
which came out on that oc-
casion, amounted to twenty-
one thousand; and their
entire force includes nine
=lthousand more. There can
be no doubt that such a
host of slashing blades
would effectually cut up
the audacious authors of
any foreign attack upon
British liberty.
Multum in Parvo.
A Book has just been

nomy in a Nutshell? Anut-

a desperate fray. MR. DisBAELI had ordered a whip on MR. GLAD-
stoniº's resolution for lowering the duty on the import of foreign paper.
So MR. BRAND and his colleague exerted themselves to gather
together the Opposition men, and the danger appeared so great that
LoRD PALMERSton called a meeting of Liberals in Downing Street,
and preached to them upon the necessity of sustaining the Government.
As he was good enough to add, that he should regard the votes of his
supporters as evidence of confidence in the Government and its policy,
he was immediately assured in return, especially by the Members
returned by the Irish priests, that the Government would be supported,
but that there was no confidence in them. However, PAM laughed,
à and in the course of the meeting took the opportunity of further
§: the Irishry by ...; that he just heard that Gari:
aldians had landed in Naples, and that he was sure everybody wished
them success. How many Papist Members were driven away by this
declaration may be doubtful, but out of 76 Irish who voted that night,
57 voted against LoRD PAM.
Well, the night came, and MR. GLADstoNE made along and spirited
speech, and moved his resolution. His special point was, that we were
bound by the French, Treaty to reduce the duty. CHRISTOPHER
PULLER, a Liberal ex-Chancery lawyer, opposed him, and pleaded for
the paper-makers, who, expect to be hit hard, the manufacture duty
being kept on, and the import duty being reduced so as to let in
foreign paper. MR. CHILDERs believed, on the contrary, that the
paper-makers would be gainers by the opening up wider fields of
operation. MR. CRossLEY, carpet-maker, crossly described Protection
as the robbing somebody else, and was glad that the makers were to
be unprotected. MR. MAGUIRE, journalist, opposed the resolutio
and advised the House to wait, and do no more to please France unti
we had a stronger and more determined Government, who would do
something to benefit England. , SIR Hugh CAIRNs, lawyer, then
delivered the crack speech against Government, but Mr. Punch seldom
listens to these lawyers, and went into the smoking room to chaff MR.
BRIGHT. Somebody came in and, said that, the ATToRNEY-GENERAL
had walked into CAIRNs, told him he evinced far too much assurance,
and also knew nothing of the subject. When Mr. Punch went back
to his place, MR. NoRRIs, paper-maker, was complaining on behalf of
his craft, and MR. HENLEY, grumbler, followed with a big brief
grumble at GLADstoNE. LoRD JoHN Russell took a larger view of
the case, told the paper-makers that if they were like other English-
men they ought to be able to help themselves without protection, and
urged that on the grounds of treaty, wisdom, and policy, the resolution

---------------
was right, to which several allegations MR. DISRAELI demurred, and
argued that the treaty did not bind us to the reduction, and that we
ought not to be precipitate in a measure that would injure important
interests. LoRD PALMERSTON cleverly said, that he was not surprised
that the lawyers could not understand the treaty, but that he was
surprised that honest and straightforward men, “who looked at
matters in a common sense light,” could doubt about its meaning.
He said that the French Government had acted in a liberal and hand-
some manner, and had offered us time to make the reduction, but that
he thought that we ought at once to fulfil our engagements. We were
too far advanced in the paths of free-trade to retrace our steps.
Then did the Committee divide, and the Government had 266 votes,
and the Opposition 233, total 499, majority for Ministers 33. PULLER
wanted to fight on a second resolution, but was ordered by MR. Dis-
RAELI to accept the situation, and so ended the great Battle of Papyrus.
Mr. Punch must not omit to mention, that MR. ALDERMAN Sidney
has been elected for Stafford. Mr. Punch congratulates the respected
º, and opes eel not find the orrible ours of the ouse ostile to
is elth.
Tuesday. Lords at machine-work. Commons passed the Indian
Army Fusion Bill. The Ministers have invented a capital way of
evading the questions which Members want to ask. They stay away
until it is past the hour at which questions may be put, and then come
in with a dear-me.have-I-been-wanted-you-don't-say-so smirk on their
faces, and smile blandly at the sold inquirer. We don’t believe, how-
ever, that this sort of thing is prescribed in Magna Charta. SIR FITz-
Roy KELLY, the signer of ridiculous addresses to Gough, the tee:
totalling spouter, whom the Morning Star brackets with ByRoN and
HAYDoN, but gives Gough superior praise—you don't believe it?
Here is the passage from a leader of the 10th instant:—
“Such change of treatment has often before driven strong men to despair. It
drove ByRoN to debauchery, and HAYDoN to self-destruction; but, through the
É. of living faith; Gough has risen, on the wave intended to overwhelm him,
righter in spirit and stronger in his intellectual manhood."
Now then. No, come, while we are about it, here is another—
“Those who most appreciate the graphic power of DANTE and the music of
SHELLY (sic) increasingly admire the growing power of MR. Gough."
Are you satisfied?—Well, SIR FitzRoy KELLY, who signs ridiculous
addresses to this compeer of BYRoN, HAYDoN, DANTE, and SHELLEY
consistently made a fight for the maltsters to-night, but was defeated
by 89 to 49. Seven valuable criminal Bills, which had passed the
Lords, were withdrawn by the SoLICITor-GENERAL, on account of the
lateness of the Session. So much for cackle.
Wednesday. A Church Bill coming on in Committee in the Commons,
of course there was some good fun. It was the Bill for enabling the
Bishop and other authorities to deal with the City Churches which
have no congregations. There is to be power to remove these. But
MR. CAVENDish BENTINck (not the other one) insisted upon making
four of the most beautiful City Churches quite safe, º scheduling
them as, tabooed. He was a good deal attacked, but he was quite
right. “Who would pull down, such, Churches?” was asked. It
might have been answered, “Why, miserable Wandals like those who
were going to pull down the Ladye Chapel, a very few years ago, if
London had not sent up a menacing yell of indignation.” Moreover,
none of the Church spires and towers ought to be touched—they are
the ornaments of the City. Mr. Punch would like to see anybody lay
a hand on his neighbour, St. Bride. In half a minute from his getting
down his rifle, the º Sexton of the parish would have a job.
Mr. Punch applauds MR. BENTINCK, and does not applaud MR. B.
Osborne for pirating a Latin joke out of Hood's Whins and Oddities,
and for making another joke of his own out of one of the most
touching º es in the Christian's portion of The Book. Nor is he
greatly delighted with MR. HUBBARD, for arguing that if a Church
ceased to belong to the Church, it mattered not whether it were made
a Dissenting chapel or a gin-shop.
Thursday. The Lords managed to get º a little steam over the Dean
of York question. This affair looked like a job, a º: increase of
suddenly given to a rich man,—but it is explained by the Bishop
of LoNDON to be the right arrangement, and intended to prevent the
appointment from becoming an appanage of aristocratic families. If
Ishop TAIT says the thing is right, Bishop PUNCH will not ask
another question.
CAPTAIN Fowke, Royal Engineer, and of the South Kensington
Museum, evised a very clever and economical plan for improving
the National Gallery. There are three reasons in that sentence why,
of course, the authorities, set, themselves against it. Two are in the
adjectives; the third is in the fact that the Captain is a practical
soldier, and not a petted architect, who would make a bad job of the
affair, and spend twice the amount of the contract. If CAPTAIN
Fowke's plan receives fair play, its adoption will be called for by the
Public. o-night, MR. CowPER expressed his dissatisfaction with it.
The New Kensington Ride question came up, and was discussed with
much fire. LQRP John, MANNERs and MR. MALINs abused the ride;
MR. CowPER defended it, and actually scoffed at The Westries—and,
we believe, still lives. A fight was taken, and 71 supported the Ride
to 48 against it.
LoRD John Russell explained to the House that Spain wanted to
be considered one of the Great Powers. She is so proud of having
paid one of her debts, and of having been only baffled, not beaten, in
Africa, that she is ready to burst with glory. LoRn John Russell,
intimated that he had no notion of yielding to such folly, and that at
all events he should keep Spain in her place until next Session. Well
said, author of “Don Qarlos.” MR. Edwin JAMEs then, opposed the
Fortifications Bill, and after a debate, and a smart speech from PAM,
who laughed at everybody for declaring his own º, to be the
one that was to save the country, the Bill was carried, on Second
reading, by 143 to 32, majority lll. Something about the Galway
Packet contract naturally sent, Mr. Punch to sleep, but he was waked
by hearing MR. Roebuck, evidently in a dreadful rage, declaring that
he laughed everybody to scorn.
Friday in the Lords was noteworthy, because LoRD CLYDE came
out in the character of a Maiden Speaker. The heroic maiden was not
so fluent as JoAN OF ARQ, but spoke much to the purpose, and heartily
approved the Indian Army Fusion Bill. LoRD ELLENBoRough
opposed it, and incidentally rebuked the Anglo-Indian press for the
mischievous ribaldry it is always launching at the natives and their
religion and customs. LoRD, DERby had fears about the proposed
Change, but as the DUKE or CAMBRIDGE and a large majority in the
Commons approved it, he should not oppose it. . So the Bill was read
a Second time. Speaking on the elongation of the Session, LoRD
REDESDALE strongly objected to being kept in town, and said that the
QUEEN had set everybody a good example by taking her holiday, and
going off to Scotland. There was some sense in this speech.
In the Commons there was a very miscellaneous discussion. The
metropolitan Members abused Cowper for .# at the Westries;
MR. ConingHAM abused SIR CHARLEs EASTLAKE for being done, as
was alleged, in a recent picture purchase; MR. BRIGHT abused every-
body on the Paper Question, and was himself blown up by Lord
PALMERSTON for reviving old grievances and making P. lamenta-
tions; the Irish Members abused the Government for ſetting coercion
Bills be passed for Ireland, and MR. NUMB-Skully declared they were
more needed in England; and everybody abused Mr. Punch's patience,
and sent him out of the House in a rage, muttering; Quousque tandem,
Dog-and-Cat-alina, abutere, &c.
ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE PRINCE OF WALES.
OUR young friend the PRINCE or WALEs is likely to see, some
strange things, both in the country, he enters as Viceroy and in that he
approaches as Visitor...We hope that H.R.H..will keep a diary, as it
promises to be a collection of curiosities. For instance, here is a little
anecdote which Mr. Punch extracts from an American paper:—
“A CLERGYMAN FIGHTING-On Sunday last, the monotony of church-going was
unpleasantly disturbed by a street-fight between a Wesleyan Methodist preacher
named Bolton, and a pious man named WILLIAMs. The brethren had a fine fight
of it for a while, and would probably have ended with a visit to the hospital, had
not Mr. WiLLIAMs thrown up the sponge at the request of the police, just as the
REveREND MR. Bolton was putting in some of his most scientific fibbers. This
desperate affair took Place in Toronto, Canada, and was witnessed by a large crowd
of delighted citizens. -
But this was a mere display of odium theologicum, and its termi-
nation was milksoppy in the extreme, a complaint which cannot be
made in reference to the following little scene, also described in an
American journal:—
“INDICTMENT of A CRITIC roa. KILLING AN Acton.—We notice by late exchanges
that MR. GEORGE W. Over ALL, the theatrical critic of the New Orleans Delta (we
believe) has been indicted "#. Grand Jury of that city for manslaughter, he
having shot an actor named HARRY Copeland. If we remember the particulars of
the encounter rightly, Copelanr, assailed MR. Overall, in the street, in consequence
of some close criticism of his acting by the latter, when the critic shot him in self-
defence. We are no advocates of the pistol business so common in the South ; but
it seems to us that the assailant, in this case, only got his just deserts. When a
journalist cannot express an honest opinion without incurring the rowdyish attacks
of the criticised, it is high time that some one should be taught a severe and useful
lesson."
The Republicans far surpass the Colonists in thoroughly doing what
they set about. any national and characteristic scenes of these
kinds should be got up for the instruction and delight of the Prince,
Mr. Punch will feel that a delicate compliment has been paid to the
Royal Family of England.
Natural and Supernatural.
A “Thirsty Soul” of our acquaintance avows his entire belief in
MR. Home's being lifted into the air by spiritual influences, as
described in the Cornhill Magazine for this month. He declares he
has more than once been elevated by spirits himself.

A PROTESTANT PANIC.
THERE is a MR. TURNBULL, a Roman Catholic, who has been ap-
ointed to the office of Calenderer of Foreign Papers in the State Paper
ffice. This does not, at first glance, seem to be a fact worth recording,
except in the Red Book, or some such esteemed work of reference.
But we must not judge by first glances. As the children say, “looky
ear: **—
“A deputation has had an interview with Wiscount PALMERston, to present a
mºnºf respecting the appointment. The deputation consisted of the EArt, of
SHAFTEs BURY, Lord CALTHoRPE, the HoN. A. KINNAIRD, M.P., SIR. W. VERNER,
BART., M.P., &c. &c. The memorial presented by Lord SHAFTFsbury was signed
by 2,500 persons, of whom 10 were Peers, 18 Members of Parliament, 10 Baronets,
85 Magistrates, 518 Clergymen, 553 Dissenting Ministers, besides several generals,
admirals, and other officers in the army and navy, heads of colleges, literary and
other gentlemen. MR. KINNAIRD at the same time presented a similar memorial
from Scotland, signed by 3,500 persons. The memorials were very graciously
received by the PREMIER, who promised that the subject should receive the attention
it deserved. It appeared that MR. TURNBULL is distrusted even by the friends who
appointed him, two competent persons (Protestants) being ordered to “revise' all
his abstracts.”
. This is the most astounding phenomenon Mr. Punch has witnessed
since DoNATI's comet. Six thousand persons in a state of agitation
about one poor man, who, under other circumstances, Mr. Punch would
have supposed to be a superior clerk, whose business it is to make a
précis of a document, endorse it, and put it in a pigeon-hole, making a
* entry in an index-book, so that it might be easily found again.
ut the whole Evangelical world is up in arms against the §
What is the crime which he is suspected of meditating, or can possibly
commit? Into the State Paper Office rush the Six Thousand, but who
is the enemy? Are they afraid that MR. TURNBULL will translate the
old documents wrongly, and forge evidence that this country really
belongs to the KING of NAPLEs or the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA! Or is
he suspected of intending to introduce passages into the love-letters of
PHILIP to Sanguinary MARY, which will show that England broke
faith with Spain in remaining Protestant? Or will TURNBULL turn
Bulls from Rome into engines damaging to our national character.
If so, it is ". right to set two Protestant sentinels over him; but
why the Six Thousand to watch the sentinels? This is altogether a
most inexplicable case of Protestant Terror, and Mr. Punch would
much like to have it cleared up. SHAFTESBURY had better call at 85
some morning before 6.
Putting Louis Napoleon's Pipe Out.
The French EMPEROR complains bitterly of the English Govern-
ment's interpolation of a bar in his favourite air, Partant pour la Syrie.
He declares it quite spoils his latest arrangement of that favourite
melody, which he had intended to be in five flats. It seems the Five
Powers did not exactly like the Imperial time, or tune either.
PROPOSED CREATION IN THE SMARTEST NATION.
WHo will bet Mr. Punch a red cent that in ten years time our
American cousins do not create an American Peerage? The Upper Ten
are evidently awakening to a sense of the distinctions between people.
The New York Herald, the leading journal of the States, is perfectly
disgusted with the snobbishness of the Aldermen of that City. Now
that the PRINCE OF WALEs is to be the guest of the President, QUEEN
WICTORIA’s “good friend” is affectionately urged to take care that the
. stranger is not approached by the “vulgar rowdies”, who
belong to the Corporation. It is particularly desired that he should
not take to the old world such an impression of republicanism as he is
likely to derive from seeing and hearing these vulgar personages. The
Mayor of New York, whom LoRD John Russell, blundering, called
Your Excellency, is not an unworthy person, it seems.
“That he will º in a fitting and dignified manner his duties as host, and
that he will convey to his guest an agreeable impression of the cultivation and
refinement of the community of which he is the head, we are fully persuaded.
Whatever Mayor Wood's failings may be, no one will accuse him of being wanting
in the manners and bearing of a gentleman, and there is not, perhaps, a man in this
city better qualified to play the part expected of him on this occasion.”
. But as for the Aldermen and such like, they are to keep off, and not
disgrace the Republic. If a banquet is to be got up, it
“Should be entrusted to the management of a committee of gentlemen in whom
the public have confidence; otherwise it might degenerate into another such scene
of rowdyism and vulgarity as the Japanese ball presented.”
As Mr. Punch knows everything, it is his duty to add, in justice to
the Editor of the New York paper, that his opinion of the present
municipal authorities of the territory formerly the property and still
bearing the name of the DUKE of York, is amply borne out by facts,
especially facts which are occasionally elicited before the Police Magis-
trates of that locality; and on the part of the English nation, Mr. Punch
begs to express, his sense of the courtesy intended by the advocacy of
the exclusion of the “rowdies” from the hospitalities that await the
young Prince. On the whole, however, Mr. Punch strongly recom-
mends the construction of a Peerage to the consideration of his
American friends. When Mr. Punch himself next visits the States,
he trusts to be welcomed by the EARL OF LINCOIN and the MARQUIs
of BENNETT, and is ready to, bet his own Lincoln and Bennett
(quite right, Wiscount, to explain that he means a. At) that MR.
Bouglas will look uncommonly well in a coronet, of which his Scottish
namesake, the MARQUIs or QUEENSBURY will be very happy to send
him a pattern. The DUKE of BRECKENRIDGE is a title that would
sound nobly, and as that nobleman is, according to GARRETT DAVIs:—
“A gentleman of good intents, fine manners, easy and graceful elocution, while
his habits are indolent, and his manners and thoughts superficial,”
the Duke must be the exact counterpart of the majority of our own
titled Swells. Let America think of it, and open a Herald's Office in
connection with the Office of the Herald.

MISS MERMALD.
Miss MARTINEAU wrote admirably (which indeed is tautology) upon
the duty of teaching youn ies to swim. According to an adver-
tisement which has caught Mr. Punch's eye, a very young lady follows
in Miss MARTINEAu’s wake, and is setting the example. A little Miss
BeckwitH, *. six years, has, it, seems, attained great skill in
swimming, and, disports herself, in the prettiest of costume, in the
great Lambeth bath. A little Duck. Except that the pedigree would
not be ‘...} Mr. Punch would suppose the fair little baigneuse
to be a descendant of Macheath's friend, Jenny Diver.
“Who taught the little Nautilus to swim?"
is an improved quotation which occurs to Mr. Punch's well-regulated
memory, but only to be immediately rejected; because, in the first
lace, she is not a naughty lass, but a very good lass, and in the second,
ecause the question is superfluous, as she is stated to have been taught
by her papa, a distinguished swimmer, to whom Mr. Punch tenders his
congratulations on having a child who will always be able to keep her
head above water.
CHEERING IF TRUE.
In these days of alarming and unpleasant rumours, the report men-
tioned in the following extract from the French correspondence of the
Times will be hailed, as a lively variation of the melancholy air which
has so long been resounding on the trumpet of common Fame:—
“As a prelude, it is said, to the total abolition of passports for foreigners travel-
ling in France, the EMPERoR has ordered that foreigners coming to Paris to witness
the festivities on the 15th of August, the EMPERoR's fete, shall not be required to
show passports.”
This tune goes nicely. Is it not too cheerful to be true? Is
Pandora's box not yet quite empty? Are peaceable people still in a
condition to entertain some little hope? Can we venture to give ear
to any announcement of aught, but impending calamity-war, plague,
pestilence, famine, deficit and increased taxation? The EMPEROR or
THE FRENCH has written us a very promising letter. The abolition of
§. would indeed be a great step in the direction of performance.
omething like confidence would be created in Europe by the spec-
tacle of such an Imperial stride accomplished in the Seven League
Napoleon Boots.

A GO AT THE GABBLERS.
H! What is to be
done with our talka-
tive M.P.s? This is
a question which is
yearly getting more
and more momentous.
Every session is more
taken up and wasted
by them than the last,
and the more they sit
and talk, the less the
country is advantaged
by it. Here we are in
* August, and their
tongues are just as
voluble, as they were
in April; and nobody
except the grouse is
any whit the better off
for the clatter they
keep up. As for any
wusiness, being got
through in their pre-
sence, one might as
well expect to get an
epic poem written
within hearing of an
. -grinder. Their
gabble is enough to
distract the strongest
- - mind, and divert from
what engages it the steadiest attention. Who can hope to see a Bill safe through the
House, when a hundred tongues are waiting ready primed, to fire away upon it? The
batteries, it is true, are mostly, loaded with blank cartridge, but then they kick up such a
ceaseless row, that no one possibly can work in it.
Talk, talk, talk,
Till the brain grows dizzy and dim:
And talk, talk, talk,
Till the cheerfulest face looks grim.
And it’s oh! what a din they make,
In spite of the cries of “s !”
And in spite of the fact that each bottled-up Act,
Will be turned to a bottle of smoke.
Now, what is to be done to bring these garrulous M.P.s beneath the wholesome influence
of the Eary Closing Movement, or, in language less circuitous, to make them “shut up”
sooner than they have done of late? Everybody grumbles at the way in which the country's
time is taken up, and nobody º of . remedy to name for it. State physicians,
iſ appealed to, blandly shrug their shoulders, and say they fear the case is past all curing.
Hear, for instance, how the Times talks on the matter, and hints that a reform pill must in
some shape be prescribed for it:—
“No greater service could be rendered to the efficient transaction of public affairs, and the maintenance of
the high character of public men, than a scheme by which the House should be euabled to protect itself
against its unruly members, and to find time for all its business by economising that which it devotes to the
least-important part. *, *, *, * The man who shall invent any means by which Parliament can dis-
charge efficiently the duties that it has undertaken, will be the author of a real Reform Bill, that will give a
stability to our institutions which at this moment they do not possess, and avert the most formidable danger
which can overtake an ancient constitution—that of being found unequal to copo with the circumstances of a
society into the midst of which it has descended.”
Thus appealed to, Mr. Punch, whose talents are devoted to the service of his country,
has felt in duty bound to keep his brains upon the rack, until he could devise a scheme for
silencing the gabblers, and removing the obstructives to the business of the nation. With
this view he has nightly dosed himself with tea, and has supped off toasted cheese to keep
himself awake, and unnaturally stimulate his powers of invention. The result is, he at length
has hit upon a plan by which the workers in the House will be secured due peace and quiet,
without º: by one syllable the pratings of the talkers. Mr. Punch suggests, that
henceforth the House should be divided, and that the talkers and the workers should be kept
distinct and separate. As no Member is influenced by what he hears in Parliament, there
can be but very small advantage in his hearing it. Votes, it is well known, are always cut
and dried beforehand, and not one in a million is biassed by the speeches. Gabblers get upon
their legs that they may use their tongues, merely, and never dream of getting workers to
waste their time in hearing them. It is clear then, that for all the good they do in the House,
the talkers might, in fact, be every whit as well kept out of it.
But Mr. Punch, who ever tempers justice with mercy, will not be so cruel as to hint that
this is requisite. A Bill for the Removal of these National Nuisances would no doubt
be vastly º and has much to recommend it. Nevertheless, Mr. Punch will not at
present aft or it, but will content himself with º severing the House, and separating
its productive from its unproductive Members. The former might still occupy the chamber
they now sit in, being secured from any chance of interruption by the latter: to whom should
be allotted a chamber by themselves, where they might gabble as they pleased without
annoying anybody. Reporters might attend when they were specially engaged; and the
luxury of seeing one's pet speeches put in print might thus be graciously provided for all
who chose to pay for it. - -
By separating thus the really busy bees of Parliament from the idly buzzing drones by
whom the business is im
of St. Stephens will be .
ded, the great hive
out quite suffi-
ciently, and room be found to lay up goodly
stores of useful Acts.
When the drones can’t
interrupt them, the working bees, no doubt, will
stick to work like wax; and will no more have
their time wasted by swarms of ga
od-for-nothings, whose only point o
erence from the family of drones i
and then one finds that they are gi
sting.

PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXVII.-THREE WORDS MORE ABOUT THE REIGN
OF KING EDWARD THE THIRD.
Q oming now to the
military costume
of this period, we
would direct espe-
cial notice to the
beautiful initial
letter which our
artist has selected
to illuminate this
chapter, as throw-
ing a clear light
upon the armour
of the time. The
letter we should
note is quite cor-
rectly copied from
one that any anti-
quary at a glance
will recognise; but
as some few of our
readers may not be
so well acquainted
with it, we may
append a word or
two by way of ex-
planation. Look-
ing to the left,
then, º will per-
ceive his Gracious
Majesty King ED-
warp THE THIRD a-sitting in his easy chair (please observe the cushion
on it) and a-holding in his left hand either a ; or a sword or elsea
kitchen poker, it is really rather puzzling to decide precisely which,
With his dexter hand the monarch is handing what might possibly be
thought to be a newspaper, but which really is the grant of the Duchy
of Aquitaine. The figure to the right is Edward the BLAck PRINCE,
who is a kneeling on his helmet to
receive the Royal gift. Some conjec-
ture that the reason why he chooses
that position is simply that his leg
armour was made a little tight, and if
he had knelt upon the ground he could
not have got up again. The spectator
will, remark the pourpoint over the
thigh-pieces, a prevalent way of wearing
it in this and the next reign. It like-
wise should be noticed, that the Prince
is not so Black as history has painted
him, but for which there seems to have
been no colourable excuse. As shown
in this initial, his complexion is as
white as a Serenading Ethiop's who
has had his face .
Plate armour came much more into
use during this reign, the body indeed
being almost wholly covered by it. The
chief cause of its adoption was, that it
was very much lighter than chain-mail
which, with its appendages, was foun
so hot and heavy that the knights were
sometimes suffocated, or sank beneath
its weight. A light steel back- and
breast-plate proved fully as protective
as the hauberk and the plastron, and
the plate was not so liable to be pushed
into a wound as were the links of the
chain-mail when broken by a lance-
poke. This improvement in our armour
was, it seems, of foreign origin. By the
Florentine annals º: 1315 is given
as the date of a new Horse-guards regu-
lation, whereby every mounted soldier
was ordered to have his helmet and his
breastplate, his cuisses, jambes, and gauntlets, all of iron plate: and as
the Italians were famous for the way in which they kept their irons
-
... fire, we found it worth our while to steal a leaf out of their
00ks.
There may be doubts if many readers will remember such queer
names, but mention should be made that brassarts and demibrassarts,
and vant-braces or vambraces were separate bits of armour worn upon
the arms; cuissarts or cuisses were used to shield the thigh, and boots
of steel called greaves orjambes were worn upon the leg between the
ancle and the knee. We have no doubt that the jambes were found to
act well as preserves, but we think at times the shin must have been
sadly * in them. A similar objection too, we think, must have
applied to the manner of affording protection to the feet; for we learn
that they were cased in what were known as “sollerets” of overlap-
ping plates, which people who had corns found most corn-foundedly
unpleasant. Similar plates were worn upon the backs of the leathern
gauntlets, which upwards from the
wrists were mostly made of steel.
Knobs or spikes, called gadlings,
being fastened on the knuckles, the
gauntlets were occasionally used as
knuckle-dusters, if “jacket-dusters”
would not be a more appropriate
term. Thus in a trial by combat
between one John De Wisconti and
SIR. Thomas DE LA MARCHE, fought
at Westminster before KING Edward
in close lists, SIR. Thomas gained
the day by dashing in his gadlings on - - -
the mug of his antagonist, who went to grass minus three ivories, and
with his dexter peeper closed.* -
Over the body-armour a garment called a jupon was much worn
during this period, being lighter and less, cumbrous than the cyclas
or the surcoat, which had been in use with the wearers of chain-mail:
The jupon was girt loosely, with the gorgeous belt of knighthood, and
was usually emblazoned with the arms of him who wore it, or else was
embroidered with griffins or green geese, or any other tasty and
fanciful device.
People well * in their history, as (of course) are all our readers,
need not be told that there was plenty of fighting in this reign. Else
might we remind them of how King Edward, making war with
Philip THE TALL, of France, landed with his army on the coast of
Flanders, after gaining a naval battle in which the enemy lost upwards
of two hundred and thirty ships and thirty thousand men; and how,
marching thence towards Paris, he took the towns and villages which
lay #. his route, and, as one old writer tells us, “at Caen in especiall
he didde give y” Frenchmen peppere.” The names of Poictiers, too,
and Cressy must alike be fresh in the remembrance of our readers;
who will doubtless recollect that it was at the latter battle that cannon
were first used, although they by no means as yet supplanted bows and
arrows. The first cannon indeed would now be thought mere popguns,

and, as arms, would be considered very weak compared with Arm:
strong's. We fancy, too, that what with their recoil and the chances
of their bursting, they often did more damage to their own side
than the enemy; while their range no doubt fell short of that attained
by the long-bowmen, who, unless they drew the long bow in more
senses than one, are believed to have killed their men at above four
hundred yards with it. Our victory at Cressy was won mainly by the
bow, our marksmen, showing themselves markedly superior to the
foreigners, who had the disadvantage too of shooting with wet weapons,

* That the Prince was called “the Black” from the colour of his armour is a
notion which Sir SAMUEL Mºynick has exploded: and it appears that the nickname
was in truth a nom de guerre, being derived from the black looks with which he
faced the foes whom he had put in his black books,
* We may note here, that the gauntlets of Edward the BLAck Panos were made
of brass or laton, and the gadlings were fashioned in the shape of lions or leopards,
the reader, if he pleases, may himself-determine which. He will find the gauntlets
hanging above the Prince's tomb in Canterbury Cathedral, together with his sur-
coat, shield, and tilting helmet, all of which are visible without increase of price:
and'we think the dean and Chapter may very fairly calculate that after this
announcement there will set in quite a rush of Canterbury pilgrims to see the
interesting relics which are there on view.
+ “what man has done,” &c. we won't pursue the proverb; but should any
future steps be taken in that direction, it will be seen by this that they are not
without a precedent.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
which materially damped the ardour of their fire. This we learn from
various more or less authentic sources, and among them we may cite
one of those curious old ballads which we believe that we have been
the first to put in print. Herein it is stated that—
“ Cheir boºs habbe berm mashto, just mashtt in a shoºtre,
3 mb pt strings ſurrt so mitten ant fragth,
Chat gº arthers, tubo ºutre of our formen gº flousfrt,
jull soone ºcre our prisoners matt.” "
It may be noticed here, that there has been much argument expended
as to whether it was at the Battle of 9. (which, from the rain that
fell, has been by some folks called the Battle of Water-Cressy) that the
BLAck PRINCE first adopted the sign of the Three Feathers, which
has ever, since continued the Prince of Wales his crest. CAMDEN
states in his Remains (which Cox of Finsbury believes were written in
Camden Town)—
“The victorious BLAck PRINCE used sometimes one feather, sometimes three, in
token as some saye of his speedye execution in all his services, as y” posts in the
Roman times were called pterophori, and wore feathers to signifie their flying post
haste. But yº truth is y he wonne them at y' battle of Cressy, from John, King of
Bohemia, whome he there slewe.”
What authority he had for calling this “the truth,” the learned
CAMDEN carefully neglects to let us know; and as contemporary, his-
torians make no mention of the matter, we cannot pin our faith on
MR. CAMDEN's tale. The crest of John of BohemiA, as shown upon
his was the pinion of an ostrich; and whether the Prince plucked
his feathers from John's wing is a matter of a pinion which we cannot
well decide.t. For his bravery at Cressy, the Prince received no end
of praise from his father, who may have said his º were a feather
in his cap: and the Prince may then have stuck three feathers in his
cap to show how much he plumed himself on having pleased his
parent. A single feather, we are told, was very often worn by civil
ple at this period, but whether the Prince led the mode, or merely
}. it, is a question upon which our means of knowledge are but
mode-rate.
* The English, with more forethought, had taken the precaution not to take their
bows out of their cases until they were wanted, it being then an excellent war
maxim to “keep your bowstrings dry."
# “STRAUss," the German word for “ostrich," was used in ancient times to sig-
nify a combat, although it is now obsolete in that old-fashioned sense; and this may
have been a reason for the pinion of the bird being adopted by the Kino of
Bohr MIA as a crest. Another reason possibly was that the ostrich, being blest with
an extraordinary digestion, was used to º: a soldier's appetite for steel, which
he was continually at the risk of having to bite. In one of the old descriptions of
the battle of Poictiers, we find the HomeR of the period saying ‘’Many a hero,
like the ostrich, had to digest both iron and steel"—without feeling much the
better, we should say, for the steel mixture.

But that patience and courage the Baron has stowed
In his vessel, which one day will surely be towed

The seeds of success have been carefully sowed,
And one of these days shall the harvest be mowed.

And bids the official Obstructives be blowed,
And pay up the claims of brave BARON DE BoDE.

THE EDINBURGH REVIEW.
(Tuesday, August 7th.)
THERE's an ancient periodical, in blue and yellow bound,
That appears on old Whig tables as quarter-day comes round,
And many a good old-fashioned Whig would make a sad ado,
Were a quarter-day to pass without his Edinburgh Review /
But not in old § uniform of blue and yellow pied
Was clad that Edinburgh Review which now wakes Punch's pride:
And not in issue quarterly, four numbers by the year,
Čame out the Edinburgh Review which Pinch would welcome here
But in sober greys and russets, and in plaids of sombre sheen,
The latest Edinburgh Review was welcomed by our QUEEN;
And more than twenty thousand were the numbers it poured forth, |
Where, Lion-like, grim Arthur's Seat looks down upon the Forth.
From the storm-swept head of Dunnet, to Solway’s level sands—
From the sea-firths of Argyleshire to where Arbroath castle stands—
From Lowland heugh, and Highland strath, from mountain, moor
and fell,
Trooped forth those sturdy thousands—the loyal throng to swell.
The clansman with his claymore, his kilt and belted plaid,
The Lowlander in hodden grey, or darkling green arrayed;
The crofter from the loch-side, the gilly from the hill,
The farmer from the furrow, and the weaver from the mill.
Came gentle and came simple, came wealthy and came poor,
All moved by one intent, all bound by one tie, strong and sure;
By leal love of the Lady in whose soft sway we stand,
And love more leal, it such may be, for this their native land.
There have been times when North and South stood foot to foot for
ray,
But no blood-feud has summoned the gathering of to-day;
The sons of merry England with Scotland's sons are here,
Shoulder to shoulder marching—true step and tuneful cheer.
St. Andrew's Cross from Arthur's Seat salutes with stately show
St. George's banner waving on Holyrood below;
Two hundred thousand faces on the hill-sides hide the green,
Two hundred thousand voices ring out “God save the QUEEN' "
And before the Royal Standard and the Royal presence, lo!
Where twenty thousand Volunteers in martial order go;
With rifles trailed, and swinging stride, and port erect and free—
If such are Britain's citizens, what should her soldiers be?
An hour has gone, and still pours on that armed and ordered tide,
And well the Queenly face may flush and pale with sudden pride,
For such a body-guard as this had never §. I trow—
From the days that MALcol M wore his torc of twisted gold, till now?
And never sent a country such a band of stalwart sons
To guard their hearths and household gods, their wives and littie
ones—
And never had defenders such an awful trust to hold,
As that which lies on us and them—these peaceful soldiers bold.
The South had spoken out before—and now outspeaks the North,
In this many-thousand muster upon the shores of Forth :
May it be long ere Scotland forgets the bold and true,
That came out this Seventh of August in her Edinburgh Review:
A Vicarious Crack.
THE new Report of the Lunacy Commission states, that out of every
600 persons, one is cracked. Now the House of Commons consists of
654 persons, and therefore must contain one person, and also the
twelfth part of one, incapable of managing affairs. A Committee
ought to be moved for, in order to ascertain who these parties are. Or,
shall we accept the largest compound of the two things that make a
senator, namely, Tin and Brass,” as the representative of the House,
and regard the crack in Big Ben as the case of Parliamentary Lunacy.
THE HOUSE OF CHATTERBOXES.
The Long Parliament made a name for itself in history, and the
º House of Commons bids fair to earn a somewhat similar name.
t will probably be denominated the Long-Winded Parliament.

SARCastic Conductor. “Now, Sir ;
A PRINCE OF A YOUNG FELLOW.
“Oh, MY DEAR MR. PUNCH, “Verbena Villa, Friday.
“I AM so delighted. That dear darling PRINCE OF WALEs
Isn't he a duck? Only hear now how delightfully his charming Royal
Highness is getting on in Canada. This is what the New York Herald
tells us of the § which was given at the Colonial House, in the
parish of St. John's,” to him :—
“The Prince arrived at about ten o'clock, and was greeted with loud, enthusi-
astic, and prolonged cheers—the bands playing “God save the Queen." The Prince
was dressed in the full uniform of a British colonel. He was accompanied by the
EARL or St. Germans, who was dressed in blue, with a badge, and the Duke or
Nºwcastle, who wore his full uniform. The Prince danced six times during the
evening, and remained with the company until half-past two o'clock this morning.
The dancing, on the whole, among the company was not very good. The Prince
very affably and good-naturedly corrected some of the .#. dancers, and
every now and then called out the different figures of the dance. He is himself a
very graceful and accomplished dancer, as he fully proved in the way he whirled
through waltzes, polkas, and quadrilles. While he danced he was repeatedly
cheered, and he very properly took a new partner whenever he stood up to dance.
The people everywhere are greatly delighted. The unpretending and genial dispo-
. of the young Prince has gained him the affection of many true and worthy
hearts."
“There! isn't that delicuous / Only think now of our PRINCE OF
WALEs having to turn dancing-master / Oh, how I should have loved to
have been “whirled through a waltz” with him I’m sure His High-
ness wouldn't have found me a ‘blundering dancer.” Poor fellow ! I
dare say that he was sadly wered to find that the Canadians were so
clumsy in a ball-room. Really, I’ve no patience with such ungainly
creatures. My heart bleeds to think how terribly they trod upon his
toes, and wobbled in their waltzing. Clearly something should be done
to prevent such stupid things from troubling our Princes. Oh, if I’d
been there! Wouldn't, I have put their noses out of joint just 1 I
should so like to show them how an English girl can dance, particularly
when she gets a Prince to be her partner!
“I don't quite understand though what the paper means by saying
that whenever the Prince danced he “very properly took a new
partner.” I confess I can't see what there is so “wery proper’ in this.
* St. John's is not a parish, and is not in Canada. But never mind, Miss, Loyalty
ranks higher than Geography.—Punch.
'Ere y are.
*
-
Room for yer all insideſ"
I know myself I like to keep more to one partner, than to have to dance
about with nobody knows whom, so that one never has the chance of a
bit of a flirtation, and still less of arriving at the interesting moment
when one may hear something serious. I’m sure that my Mamma
knows much better than a newspaper what is ‘very proper’ for one;
and I know that when the other night I danced sir times with young
LoRD CROEsus, Ma whispered me en passant to try and dance a seventh,
and told me when I had done so, that it was ‘very proper/
“But variety, you know, isn't always charming, is it? at any rate,
in Canada it doesn't seem to be so. At least, although the paper says
that the Prince has ‘gained the affection of many true and worthy
hearts,” I don't much think His Highness has lost his own at present.
And I hope he'll bring it back with him as whole as it was, doubtless,
when he took it out; though for that matter, perhaps, if it really is
the law that he musn't form a marriage with a nice good English girl,
I don't know, but I’d like him to bring home a born Yankee rather
than be forced for some ridiculous State reasons, to give his Royal
º to one of those Small Germans, who are doubtless looking out
or it.
“I am, dear Mr. Punch, yours, and Oh! the Prince's, if he might
but have me!
“With the fondest love and reverence,

THE SONG OF SUPPLY.
(By A ST. STEPHEN's overLookER.)
Dash through the paper, boys; knock off Supply—
August is waning, September is nigh!
Six months of Session you wasted in talk,
You’d a Budget to bait, a Reform Bill to baulk—
But now the arrears of the work must be done,
By ‘gº from slumber and cribbing from sun;
So all hands to the crank, boys,
And turn it in rank, boys,
All hands to the crank, boys, and round by the run!
- Some sages maintain work and º both go quicker
For mixing, as topers mix lymph and strong liquor;
But you, gallant spirits, have voted it shorter,
First to drink all the spirits, and then all the water.
Let us see, now talk's alcohol’s spent, you won't shirk
—Howe'er nauseous such tipple—the water of work—
Then all hands to the crank, boys,
And turn it in rank, boys,
And cough down all who prate, though 'twere CHATHAM
or BURRE.
s
What if they are millions with which you’ve to deal:
'Tis you make the national shoe-sole and heel.
What odds if you stretch or screw in, ell or inch P
'Tis John Bull has to wear it, and he’ll feel the pinch.
He in law and finance trusts his cobbling to you,
So stick to your last, till §. 's rattled through—
Then all hands to the crank, boys,
And turn it in rank, boys,
Supplies we must have if we sit till all’s blue !
This is no time for haggling, and shaping, and squaring ;
A fig for each saved candle-end and cheeseparing!
Into items we’d rather you didn't look close,
Just give us the sums that we want, in the gross.
With your priv'lege of voting the cash be content,
And don't bother your heads about how it is spent—
So all hands to the crank, boys,
And turn it in rank, boys, -
We must have Supplies, if we keep you till Lent.
NEw EDITION of “Evelyn's Sylver.”—A fine of £500
in gold. Publisher, CockBURN (not BeNTLEy).
A PRINCE IN A YANKEE PRINT.
AN American journal has cut out our Court Circular. The special
reporter of the New York Herald, appointed to watch and record the
progress of the PRINCE OF WALes, relates, with wonderful minuteness
the performance, by his Royal Highness, of actions of which the
importance is immense. For instance:—
“At the Newfoundland ball he danced eleven of the thirteen dances; but last
º: be was the hero of seven quadrilles, four waltzes, four gallops, and three
poikas.
Put that grand fact down, CLIo. Note this also, Muse of History:—
“This morning he was out in plain dress, walking with his suite.”
Book also the following memorable relations:—
“At eleven he appeared in uniform, and held a levee at the Government House,
which was attended by 300 persons. At half-past twelve he stood, hat in hand,
with his suite, and was photographed in the private grounds of Government House.
At half-past two the Prince drove in an open carriage with Loºp and LADY MUL-
GRAve, the Dukº or NEwcasTLE, and Lord ST GERMANs, to the dockyard, and
embarked amid the thunders of a Royal salute from the batteries and ships, and the
cheers of a vast multitude, for the Nile, to lunch with the admiral, and witness the
regatta.”
Of all the details in the foregoing narrative the most striking, per-
haps, is the specification of the solemn circumstance, that the PRINCE
of WALEs stood, hat, in hand, with his suite, and was photographed
in the private grounds of Government House at half-past twelve.
It is much to be regretted that the republican chronicler of the
rincely movements was not, also, photographed at the same time.
tanding, watch in hand for his part, to time every change and transi.
tion of .*. or attitude on the part of his Royal Highness, he
must himself have presented a picture of ºidºl. grandeur and
dignity. Ah! if all historians had only paid equal regard to exactness
in taking notes of the acts and deeds of illustrious personages, there
would be much less controversy than there unhappily is about many
vital points in history, sacred and profane. But now for an ascent to
particulars, even exceeding in consequence the most tremendous things
contained in the preceding narrative:-
“He afterwards went on board the Hero, and substituted for his uniform a pair
of drab trousers, a dark-blue buttoned walking coat, with an outside breast pocket
for the handkerchief, an ordinary black hat, and walking-stick."
Here is a specimen of glorious word-painting indeed! For to what
nobler purpose could words be applied than that of expressing the
colours of the clothes of a Prince, and informing a breathlessly atten-
tive world that his trousers were drab, that his walking-coat was blue,
and his hat black? The further information that our Prince's walking
coat was buttoned, and that it had on the outside of it a breast-pocket
for the handkerchief, will be perused with eager interest whereyer the
English language is spoken, and, will excite the enthusiasm of gene-
rations yet unborn, especially when it is recollected that, this attire
was substituted for a uniform on board the Hero; because if that is not
an heroic act, what is? We can only lament that the foregoing im-
pressive inventory of his Royal Highness's costume contains no
account of his cravat, and not any mention of his boots; so that we do
not know whether the former was white, black, or coloured, and as to
the latter, although we may safely conjecture that they were of patent
leather, we are not enabled even to guess whether they were Welling-
tons or anklejacks with elastic side-springs. The reporter of the New
York Herald forgets also to tell us what gloves were worn by the
PRINCE or WALEs, and, if he wore two or only one; a question
naturally suggested by the consideration that he carried a walking-
stick, in which case he may have worn his left£: only, and held the
right in his left hand, or vice versá, or have had both hands gloved and
his stick in either one of them.
Those who are not magnanimous enough to care about the boots or
clothes in which the PRINCE OF WALEs is astonishing the American
mind, may yet rejoice to know that the wearer of those habiliments is
comporting himself in such a manner as to increase the great popularity
which he necessarily inherits.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 25, 1860.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
UGUST 13. Monday. THE
FESTIVAL OF ST.G.Rouse!
and here were Lords and
Commons blazing away in
Parliament instead of on
the Moors! As a warning
to posterity, Mr. Punch
would give due promi-
mence to this disgraceful
fact, and he therefore has
employed it as the base
of his Big Cut. Having
gabbled, away their time
in the beginning of the
Session, Members now are
kept in town to do the
work they have neglected;
like a lot of lazy school-
boys, who, having larked
in school time, are stopped
from going out. Many a
sportsman, surely, as he
snoozes in the smoking-
room, or snores on the
back benches, must be
haunted by the ghosts of
the Keepers who are wait-
ing for him, and , must
mistake the grumblings
and the groanings over
the Estimates for the
yelpings, and the growl-
ings of his impatient dogs.
The result of the days
sport may be told in no great space. A large covey of Bills was
ut up by their lordships, some of which were done for, (being
#. Assented to), while others, not so forward, were “advanced
a stage,” with the intent of being bagged the next time they
were flushed. The EARL OF HARRINGton got some sport out of
the Ireland Refreshment Houses, by saying that the Bishops who
opposed, the Gin Bill were “Spiritual." Lords; and that the cheap
wines which MR. GLADSTONE patronised were made from “grapestalks
mixed with water and trodden, with dirty feet.”. These statements
both elicited the .# of their Lordships; as did likewise the con;
fession that the Earl had “in his earlier days indulged in no illiberal
potations of wine, but he had never yet discovered that they had a
sobering quality.” Let the reader recollect this remarkable assertion!
The day's sport in the Commons was begun by SIR CHARLEs Woon,
who fired away for some few hours upon the Indian Finances. All
this verbal ammunition may be shot off in one volley: India wants
Three Millions; will England let her borrow them? The interest
taken in our finding capital for India was º evinced by the
aspect of our Parliament. When SIR CHARLEs. WooD opened ſire
there was No House to attend to him, there being less than forty of
our Statesmen who were present; and the Debate, which ended in the
uestion being assented to, was conducted for the most part before
ess than thirty listeners.
Having thus resolved to fortify the Indian Finances, the thirty (or
forty) turned their tongues upon the English Fortifications, and made
their minds up, that if forts were ordered we must pay for them; and,
therefore, that the Bill for Provision of Expenses could not well be
smashed. In the discussion which took place, the Monster (MR.
SIDNEY HERBERT) made a good defence for Government for the plans
whereby it meant to make a better defence for Portsmouth; adding, in
Mr. Punch's private ear, with liberty to print the joke, that with
regard to placing forts about our ports, “fort-iter occupa portum”
was the rule to be observed. Instead of going to bed by ten, as they
doubtless would have done had they been out upon the Moors, the
House sat up till half-past two; but nothing further worthy of record-
ing passed, with the exception of the Bill imposing:New Duties on
Spirits, which MR. HoME and other Mediums would do well to
peruse.
Tuesday. LoRD STRATFORD DE REDCLIFFE, who has some knowledge
of the Turks, wished to know if Government had sent a ship of war to
Sm for the protection of the Christians; whereto Government
replied, through!the medium of Lord Wodehouse, that no ship had
been sent to Smyrna quite direct, but that a strong squadron had
orders to cruise along the Syrian coast, and if any row occurred they
would assuredly be down upon it. The chances were though, that
theirF. would prevent such contingency; for no cur of a Druse
would ever dare to show his teeth while he was in reach of the bite of
British “bulldogs.” On the Gas Bill being considered there was a
bit of a flare-up, several noble lords opining that the measure was a
bad one, and LoRD LLANoveR explaining that it would have been
much better had not the companies put such a pressure on the
Commons. -
Among the latter MR. JAMEs produced a slight sensation by asking
MR. CowPER, First Commissioner of Works, if he had delivered a dis.
course last Sunday in Hyde Park, and had harangued the British people
on the subject of “Cowper's Folly,” called otherwise his “Ride.” º:
reply, MR. CowPER confessed that he had donealittle Sunday spouting,
for the Ride was such a hobby of his, that he couldn't well help mounting
it whenever he had a chance. But he declared that what he said was
uite on his own hook, and did not in any manner compromise the
vernment. Mr. Punch, however, cannot quite agree in this opinion,
for he doubts if it comports with the dignity of senators to get upon
their legs among al fresco meetings, and let off fireworks about them-
selves to amuse a London mob. , Mr. Punch has little wish to see his
friend LoRD PALMERston *. from the Forum which he so long
has graced, to address a MR. BugGINs on the subject of the Income.
º harangue a MR. Huggins on the policy of Turkey or the posture
of the Pope.
Having talked for a few minutes about Corporal Punishment (which
MR. AIFIELD and the Wiscount thought was very much too frequently
adopted in our gaols, and Mr. Punch, it is unnecessary to state, thinks
the reverse), t e flouse inflicted a small dose of it upon itself, by
sitting on the Estimates until after two o'clock. During the discussion
SIR John PAKINGTON endeavoured to get Members to Resolve that
ragged schools should be more aided by the Government; but Members
(who had mostly good coats on their backs) did not seem to see the
need of giving more help to the ragged, and so the motion, on division,
was lost by 41 to 25. Mr Punch mentions the numbers to show how
many there are in Parliament who really care about the Education of
the People, this being the evening when the grant for National Schools
was (through the people's representatives) nationally discussed.
... Wednesday. The Commons in Committee were engaged in consider-
ing the Civil Service Estimates, which, strange as it may seem, did not
include an estimate of the services of Mr. Punch. The discussion, like
the Estimates, was somewhat miscellaneous, embracing several subjects
quite foreign to the matter; such, for instance, as the recent squabble
down at Guildford, between Mr. Justic: 'BºAcºuns and Mr.
ShERIFF EVELYN, about which Mr. Punch may have something else to
say. It should be noted, too, that though the Commons rose at Six
o'clock, the Wiscount had been on his legs no less than twice six
times. But when was WILLIAMs ever known to forget his country's
interests? May the bump of his Economy never grow one atom less!
Thursday. The Lords had a rattling battue of little Bills; after
which, the EARL of HARRINGTON made a sadly silly speech, attempt-
ing to pit himself against SIR ALEXANDER Cockburn in determining
what evidence a Court of Justice should receive. The case was one
which Mr. Punch has recently adverted to, of a medical man at Lewes,
who was cruelly accused of murdering his mother; an accusation
which (except in the eyesight of LoRD HARRINGTON) there was not a
scrap or shred of evidence to prove. With proper sternness was his
Lordship rebuked by the LoRD CHANGELLOR, who said his Lordship's
motion was “utterly uncalled for,” and that he ought to have known
better than to cast doubts on a trial which “had been fairly conducted
in the face of the country.”
The other House was occupied in shovelling out Supplies; where-
anent there, was some talk about the British Museum, which
AYRTON said (to use an American expression) was sartinly a-gitten
sorter bust up by the Bilers. The latter (known less commonly as
the Kensington Museum) were open in the evening, and therefore could
be visited, whereas the show in Bloomsbury was only visible by day-
light, when working-men had little opportunity to profit by it. A
question, being raised as to whether Government knew that recruits
were being enlisted here to serve under GARIBALDI, Lord PALMER-
STON said that, Government, had no knowledge of the fact, but when
they had he felt quite sure that they would “do their duty.” As their
duty seems to be to put the Foreign Enlistment Act in operation,
Volunteers who talk of going to have a crack at BoMBA had better
just read over the provisions of that Act. A resolution granting a sum
of near three hundred thousand pounds for education of the Irish was
the signal, not unnaturally, for a regular Irish row, more especially
as MR. CARDwell, the mover for the vote, showed most clearly that
the money would be profitably spent. The vote being agreed to, after
#: verbal shillelaghing, the House adjourned at soon after halfpast
ee A.M.
Friday. The Lords talked for two hours, but did not say two words
which Mr. Punch deems worth reporting.
Although up late the night before, the Commons met at noon, when
MR. GLAnston; said he wanted a couple of millions raised by Exche:
uer Bonds or Bills (he didn’t much care which), and having explained
that but for the wet weather he would only have wanted one, the House
consulted its barometer,, and agreed to his request. Shovelling out
Supplies was then the order of the day, and in the evening this agree-
able occupation was resumed. Time was, however, found for talk on
some few dozen other topics on the tapis, and among them Loss

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FERMoy, called attention to the fact, that a black blackguard
named BADAHUNg, who is at present king of Dahomey, is going
to butcher in cold blood a couple of thousand º as a
-- d custom” in honour of the death of the late king. In
regard to this, LoRD PALMERston said, that endeavours, had been
made to “persuade” the Royal miscreant to give up, these, little
luxuries: his Lordship adding, that while the Slave Trade lasted
there was little good in preaching to black blackguards about Cruelty:
and so long as there were white º who spent money in the
Slave Trade, we could not well expect black blackguards to abandon it.
Saturday...At Two o'clock, A.M., the Parliamentary proceedings were
closed by Mr. Punch, who walked home arm-in-arm with the juvenes-
cent PREMIER; and having lately been engaged in brushing up his
Scottish (no, don't say “Scotch,” please, Wiscount!) with the view
of holding converse with the keepers on his moor, gave vent to his
disgust at the dulness of the Session in the following sad strain:-

THE REW. ROBIN REDBREAST.
The Redbreast has acquired a good name which he little deserves.
In point of fact he is a fierce and pugnacious little wretch, apt to kill
the other small birds in an aviary, and peck their eyes out. His intru;
sive impudence, however, passes for affection towards mankind, and
his requiem-like song has gained for him, a peculiar character for ten-
derness and compassion; insomuch that the old ballad-maker is gene-
rally felt to have conceived a natural idea in relating of the “Children
in the Wood,” the pathetic circumstance that—
“Robin Redbreast painfully
Did cover them with leaves."
The truth is, that Robin Redbreast would never dream of doing º,
aught approaching to sexton's work, except in order, on his own per-
sonal account, to Fº: up worms. However, he has a reputation
for the piety whic
sepulture: and that good name may therefore befitly transferred to the
Rev. STEPHEN Rosse Hughes, of Llanallgo, near Moelfre, Anglesey,
and also to his brother the Rev. Hugh Robert Hughes, of Penrhos-
lligwy, who, between them, interred about 230 bodies of persons lost
in the Royal Charter. This herculean as well as Christian feat they
accomplished with the least possible assistance. A horse, a cart, a
sheet, and three or four men, formed all the appliances whereby the
former of the above-named º reverend f. managed to unite
the duties of the clergyman with those of the undertaker. At Llanalgo
there lay at one time the corpses of 40 men and women requiring to be
identified, and awaiting burial. They were both identified and buried
by the Rev. STEPHEN Hughes, whose house in the meanwhile was
crowded with their inquiring and distracted relatives. . He buried 145
bodies; had to exhume several for inspection by friends; kept a pitch
fire burning to disinfect the atmosphere, and a white surplice hangin
at hand on his door; and had to write 1,070 letters. #. reveren
brother's labours may be pretty nearly expressed by the word ditto.
Their arduous, melancholy, and unpleasant but generous exertions
have cost them dear.
The foregoing facts having been considered, a subscription has been
started, with a view to present the Rev. Robin Redbreast, alias the
Rev. S. R. Hughes, and his brother, the Rev. H. R. Hughes, with a
purse. Surely the fuller that purse can be filled, the better, that it
may rather more than reimburse them for their actual expenses; and ||

aérial suspension by Robert Houpin of his son; while the show of
spirit-hands, which is effected in the dark, they protest may be achieved
by just a bit of wax or wood, displayed by the mere aid of lazy-tongs
and phosphorus. In fact, they look upon a “Medium” as merely ar.
accomplice, and say that spirits may be raised by the wonder-working
magic of the Wizard of the North, or the almost supernatural diablerie

Now, disposed as Punch may be to coincide in their opinion, Punch
cannot quite allow that he thinks it is a fair one; in so far at least as it
tends to make comparison between a rapper and a conjurer. The

the presence of persons who believe in them. Sceptics like Mr. Punch
are carefully excluded, or if admitted, obtain entrance upon such con-

In fact, knowing well what clumsy machinery they work with, the

dark they take precautions not to let the faintest ray of light upon it.
They confess themselves thereby far inferior to the Wizards of the
North, South, East, or West, and in no sense are they worthy to be
named in the same breath with a Houdin or a DobleR, or a WILJALBA

MRS. GROUSE AND MES. PARTRIDGE.
(3m 3utumn 3Eclogut.)
MRs. GROUSE.
Good morning, MRs. PARTRIDGE, I hope that MR.P.
Is well, and all the little ones?
MRs. PARTRIDGE.
- Quite, thank you, MRs. G.
And how are all your family, and connections, in the heather?
MRs. GROUSE.
Why—what can one expect, with this miserable weather?. -
I’ve lost six of my last thirteen, and poor G.'s cough's quite hacking.
MRs. PARTRIDGE,
You should try a change of air.
MRs. GROUSE.
- - Yes. We’re thinking about packing.
But you know with a sick husband, and small family besides—
MRs. PARTRIDGE (sympathisingly).
Ah! Indeed I do, my dear. hen you and I were brides,
We thought little of the troubles and the worrits and vexations,
As thick, as crows at sowing-time in married life's probations;
But really what with egg-stealers, and gamekeepers, and poachers,
Not to speak of stoats and foumarts, and such four-footed encroachers,
And those murderous breech-loaders, and those cruel patent cartridges,
I wonder one finds heart to lay, and brood and hatch young partridges.
Then there’s that GLApstone too—the man is one of my specific hates—
Must be going and reducing the charge for Game certificates!
I suppºse there weren't already guns enough—past keeping count of
em
Blazing and banging at us, that he doubles the amount of 'em.
One would think his bottle-conjuring, with all its crop of quarrels,
Might have made him somewhat scrupulous of so increasing barrels.
MRs. GRouse., .
Such Glad-stones may do for pavement, side by side with good intentions;
Qf course you know they serve to pave a place one never mentions:
But one thing we do owe the man.
MRs. PARTRIDGE.
Indeed? And pray what is it?
MRs. GROUSE.

LADstone's budget, and the way that it was gibbeted.
MRs. PARTRIDGE.
And that cock-and-bull-Reform Bill—
MRs. GROUSE.
- No doubt that, too, contributed—
Treas’ry Bench and Opposition, on the one ground or the other,
Instead of firing into us, have been firing at each other.
Spending their powder and their shot in squabbling, talk, and chatter,
As if time were so abundant that its waste could make no matter,
How John BULL stands that House, with all its blatancy and bubbles,
Amazes us up on the Moors—
MRs. PARTRIDGE.
And us, down in the stubbles.
Think if our old cocks sat crowing and laying down the law,
When they should be picking grubs up for their ladies in the straw,
Or on the watch for keepers or beaters, or p'raps netters,
Not to speak of guns and pointers, retriever dogs and setters?
MRs. GROUSE.
Yes, indeed, dear MRs. P.; and if we in our vocation,
Behaved like representatives of this poor British nation,
What hosts of ill-starred squeakers to death we should see paddled,
What number of good eggs, by bad sitting, would be addled!.
What scores of bad eggs brooded that could never come to chicks,
However sanguine the mamma, and free from gadding tricks.
In short, G. says, if we did things “in Parliamenti modo.”

MRs. PARTRIDGE.
“”Tis an ill wind blows no one good,”, so the old proverb runs,
The more M.P.s fire off their talk, the less they’ll use their guns.
And when they do, it’s well for us, though serious for their pots,
That, judging by their speeches, they’re uncommonly bad shots.
And we shan’t run much danger if our legislators' aim
Be as bad at grouse and partridge, as at House of Commons game.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SINGULAR IF TRUE.
(An extract from the Note-book of a Spiritual Enthusiast.)”
|
N the name of the
Prophet,_FIGs | *
was the oft re-
peated cry of the
truly pious Mus-
sulman; and a si-
milar ejaculation
may possibly be
uttered by unbe-
lieving Giaours
who read this
strange narration,
and instead of being
awed by it, incline
to laugh at my ex-
pense. The fear-
fully appalling facts
which I describe,
these sceptics will
regard as merely
optical delusions,
and of no moment
whatever, even
were they truths.
But diº is the
resource of unin-
quiring intellects.
Sluggish minds de-
cline to jump to a
conclusion. They
find such mental exercise very far too active for them; Scepticism is
indeed the common characteristic of the vulgar English people. Your
snub plebeian nose turns up at anything which is not stupidly conven:
tional. It is the sharp, thin, highborn nostril that sniffs out novel
wonders, and graciously inclines itself to persons who are elsewhere
held in doubtful odour. Sweet to it is the propinquity of savans and
Fºlº whom the common plebs regards as charlatans and quacks,
ecause it is too lazy to submit to be converted by them.
To begin at the beginning, it is needful I should state, that I tho-
roughly believe, in all the mysteries of spirit-rapping, and have often
turned my hand to the turning of a table, which science (so my friends
say) has almost turned my head. All my life indeed, or at least since
I have come to years of gin-discretion, I have had an almost daily
acquaintanceship with spirits, and have summoned them whenever I
have (gratis) got the chance. ... My last spiritual intercourse was, how-
ever, so extraordinary that I feel it is my duty to expand the notes I
made of it: a feeling which I need not say is somewhat strengthened
by the hope that my narration will be liberally paid for by the editor
who has the fortune to be favoured with it.
. Having thus taken the reader into my confidence, I must now take
him, in spirit, to the parlour of a tavern, where the spiritual wonders
occurred which I relate. The time is morning; and the only persons
present are two ſº one of whom, it must be needless to men:
tion, is myself. The other is a friend of mine, whom I have ever trusted
as far as I could see him, and if he gave me good security would even
trust him farther still. We are at breakfast, and two bloaters have
been placed, before, me, which I am requested by my friend to help.
In one hand I hold a knife which is rather the worse for wear, having
a split handle and a limp bent point; and in the other I have a fork
which is not over clean, and has been in its youth deprived of one of
its three prongs. Just as I am proceeding to obey my friend's behest
and am in the act of transfixation of the bloater which is next to me, f
see the fish give a decided wriggle with its tail, as though it were
endeavouring to escape my thrust; and at the same time a soft gurgle
strikes upon my ear, apparently proceeding from the gullet of the fish.
Startled, yet not º, by what is very obviously a spiritual pheno-
menon, I prepare again to thrust my fork into the fish; but lo! again
there is a *::: of the spirit-moving tail, and again I hear a murmur
of soft music from the mouth. This convincing me, of course, that a
spirit must be present, I gain my friend's permission to use him as a
Medium, and go through the usual dodges to place him en rapport. To
the question, if the Bloater had anything to say why we should not
demolish it, the response was given audibly, “I guess you’d better
not ''' and then, in explanation of this spiritual warning, we were told
that it (the fish) had died a natural iº. and it felt therefore pretty
* Mr. Punch need scarcely state that, though the writer of this narrative is perfectly
well-known to him, he does not put the slightest atom of belief in it, nor does he
expect that any of his readers will. They are, however, welcome to do so if they
like, so long as they first buy, and do not meanly borrow, the number that contains
it. In the words of the immortal showman (slightly altered), Mr. Punch would say:
“My dears, first pay me down your money, and then I will concede you leave to
take your choice.
N
sure that it would disagree with us. Being asked, what it could do to
show that we might trust, it; the Bloater gradually raised itself, and
stood straight up on its tail; and then most reverentially bowed its
head to each of us, and placed at the same time its fin upon its heart.
The floater then informed us, that its parents were both dead, and
that the fish which, lay beside it was its only brother; a cruel codling
having swallowed all the spawn their mother ſaid, with the exception of
the ova whence these two orphans sprang. On being further questioned
as to its relations, the Bloater said it was descended on the side of its
É. grandmother, from, the singing fish inhabiting the waters of
ylon; and, proudly added that this ancestress had assisted in the
chorus. at the concert under, water, which, was given some few
years since at the bottom of Lake Chilka, in the presence of a most
distinguished auditory; among whom was the Governor, SIR EMERson
TENNENT, who was good enough to publish a report of the performance
in his interesting book. This confession tempted me to ask the fish,
if the ancestral talent had descended, to it, and, a modest gulp and
gurgle confessing that it had, I boldly asked the Bloater to oblige us
with a song. . Whereat with a slight show of not unnatural reluctance,
the fish, in a faint treble, struck up this plaintive stave:–
“Some like coffee, some like tea,
Some 'ike herrings just like Mel
I once was white: I now am red:
Just think of this when you go to bed.
Chorus. Sitch a getting up-stairs, and a-"
Here the singer was attacked with a violent fit of coughing, which it
explained by telling us that some of the salt it had been cured with
had got into its gills. Further conversation being thus precluded, our
interesting séance was perforce brought to an end. I ought to add,
however, that my friend, who as I have said had been acting as my
Medium, had been throughout the interview in a most excited state,
declaring every now and then that he believed I had gone mad, or else
—I can't help smiling at the ludicrous alternative—or else he said,
I had been dining out the night before, and had not yet managed to
get over my debauch. To convince him how preposterous was this
absurd impression, I asked him which of the four bloaters he would
like first to be helped to, that I might show him that my hand and
head were every whit as clear and steady as his own. Ön this he
burst into a coarse laugh, and protested that there were only two fish
in the dish; which of course was pure invention suggested by his
malice at finding me the one most spiritually favoured; for it was I
who first found out that there were spirits Helent, and thus had proved
I was more influenced by them than himself.
THE SONG OF THE TALKATIVE MEMBER.
AIR-" Let us all speak our minds, if we die for it.”
PUNCH tells me 'tis fit that M.P.s should submit
To be tongue-tied submissively, meekly:
That the nonsense we say for some eight hours a day
Should be cut down to one hour weekly;
We are begged, just for peace, our prattle to cease,
As there's neither a wherefore nor why for it:
But I can't and I don’t, and I shan’t, and I won't—
No, I will make a speech, if I die for it !
Friends who owe one a grudge say one's talk is all fudge—
Mere bombast and bunkum, and so on :
But you’ll surely allow we’ve a right to say how,
We consider that matters should go on.
The business indeed would far quicker proceed,
If we simply said “No” or said “Aye” to it:
But we .# and we can’t, and we won’t, and we shan't—
No, we will make a speech, if we die for it !
So all talkers, I hope, will take plenty of rope,
Nor care with º: interests they trifle;
With ease, if we choose our tongues but to use,
e may all legislation quite stifle.
Let PAM, if he will, then bid us be still,
And silent, he’ll have to pay high for it;
For we can't and we don't, and we shan’t, and we won't—
No, we'll all of us speak, if we die for it!
The Pope's Own.
Pope's Essay on Man is a great work; but Pope's Essay on (Irish)
man seems likely to turn out an alarming failure. We perceive that
MAJOR LAFFAN, the commander of these broths of boys, -broths that
boil up at once, and require no stirring at all, at all-appends to his
name the appropriate addition “of Knock Abbey,” a name redolent
of the Church-militant. He must find his duty of keeping down the
Celtic exuberance of the Brigade anything but a LAFFAN matter.

is, perhaps, to say, that MR. HYPHEN does not educate them without assistance. If MR;
YPHEN did “pass more candidates than any school in England” last year at the Qxford
Local Examination, and (in passing candidates) “was second only to the Liverpool Collegiate
Institution,” it must be presumed that he did
not educate them in all the branches of learning
wherein he contrived to pass them. Indeed it
is difficult to conceive in what department of
education he could possibly have instructea
them. MR. HYPHEN appears to be what is
called an English master, and to merit that
appellation by inability to write English. What
does he mean by saying that he “has a few
vacancies to supply the places of pupils leaving
school?” Grammatically this is nonsense; but
the sense which he would express, if he could,
probably is simply that he has a few vacancies for
pupils. Unless he º a staff of competent
ushers, doesn’t he wish he may get them?

MAKING GAME or The SPEAKER,
AN enthusiastic partridge-shooter, who has the
misfortune to be an M.P., and of course looks
forward with horror to the prolongation of the
Session into September, under the influence of his
partridge prepossessions, the other day addressed
the august occupant of the Chair of the House as
“MR. SQUEAKER,”
OUR ROWING CORRESPONDENT.
“MY DEAR PUNCH,
“WHEN good QUEEN Bess, of pious memory, visited the
well-known College of Saint Ulric's, Eastminster, the young gentlemen
who were educated at that establishment used to pass in review before

“Who has not heard the pretty jest (all jests were pretty in those

pic poet, as he dropped on one knee, the arch boy replied—
“Infandum, regina jubes, renovare dolorem,”
and was immediately rewarded with a groat from the Privy Purse, or,
as some say, by a buss from the Royal f S.
“The anecdote was related to me as I pored over my VIRGIL in the
fourth form at Eastminster, and I remember thinking the youth must
have been a prodigy of wit and satire. For such a sally, to so great a
Bess, fourpence certainly seems an insignificant º: but having my

“GRINDLEY, whose fag I was at school, and who is now an under-
master at Eastminster, comes up to town for the holidays, and at
breakfast with me one morning, suggested the above-mentioned subject
for a picture. ...
“I don't think it would make a bad group. Fancy the maiden
Queen in her Royal robes and ruffles (carefully studied in the Post:
Peruginesque manner), DR. PEDAGoGUs, cap in hand, looking fat and
smiling (as every Headmaster ought to look in the presence of his
Sovereign), and the chubby honest school-boy pointing to a flogging-
stool," of the period.”
“Full of the idea, I went down last week to the scenes of my youth,
which I had not visited for many years. O Tempus edar rerum ('what

impossible to define. What were mine on revisiting these Classic

cannot say. A host of old associations rise up to plead on either side,
and make the verdict doubtful. When the author of The Anatomy of

tolerably familiar: don't suppose, however, that I wish to set up for a
scholar, or can construe so much as a line of OvID without a dictionary.]
“It is twelve o'clock, and the boys come rushing down from prayers,
which, in accordance with ancient precedent are always recited in the
heathen tongue. Two or three of the monitors in infinitesimal,white

fashion to translate Pope into Latin elegiacs (we were rather famous
for our verses at Eastminster), and I remember Dick's ‘rendering’

be able to turn his attention to “quantities.’ Here sat poor Dick, I
say, thumbing his Gradus or stammering over the woes of Hecuba—
yet why ‘poor Dick?’ if he made no use of his pen, he soon learned to
wield his sword. In the shout of battle he forgot the horrors of a

the more widely it is read the better. We should like all “little fellows”
of ten or twelve years old, to get by heart this little anecdote of how
one of their own age saved himself from drowning although he could
not swim. The story should be added to the Boy's own Book, and girls
as well as boys, should be made more self-reliant, by it. ..“Learn to
Float” should be an early lesson in a copy-book, and “Keep your
llow, having seen his father indulge in the amusement of floating
hand; down” might be written as the one just next preceding it.
Children of both sexes, until they have learned to swim (and the
sooner national swimming schools are thrown open the better), should
have their minds, impressed with the easily proved fact, that their
bodies cannot sink, if they do but keep their hands down, and throw
their heads well back. Let them take example by brave little MASTER

A T the final meeting of the British
Archaeological iation the
other day, there arose a discus-
sion, reported to have been one
to the cause of the remarkable
deformity of several of the
skulls found at Wroxeter.
These skulls are twisted all
manner of ways—one side of
the face, for example, project-
ing very far in front of the
other, insomuch that, as in the
the late Charles MATHEws,
both the eyes, at least their
sockets, may be seen in profile.
In a paper on the subject
of the crania thus queerly
shaped, written by DR.HENRY
WRIGht, their distortion was
attributed to posthumous
causes; moisture and subse-
quent frost. , MR. T. WRight, on the contrary, was inclined to think
that the heads had been deformed in infancy, they having belonged, not
to ancient Romans, but, to some of the barbarians who had destroyed the
city of Uriconium. In this opinion it is probable that MR. T.
is not altogether wrong.
of considerableinterest, relative
case of the youth described by
RIGHT
On the mind of which the early faith remains unperverted by modern
scientific theories, there can be no doubt that the misshapen skulls in
question are those of barbarians, whether born, with lop-sided logger;
heads, on their shoulders, or having had their numskulls, squeezed
awry in their cradles; of which suppositions, the former is by far the
more probable. . The universality with which, Blunderbore and his
brethren, in Jack the Giant-Killer and all the like illuminated works
which antiquity has handed down for the instruction of youth, are
represented with monstrous heads, whilst the same conformation has
from time immemorial been given to similar characters in Christmas
Pantomimes, evidences a constant tradition of the existence of an
ancient race of savages whose heads were malformed and mispropor-
tioned, and who were also remarkable for prodigious noses and goggle
eyes. To this class belonged the ogres and giants about whom we
used to read, and who were no doubt all killed off by such heroes as
the jack whose adventures are recounted in the chronicle above
quoted, and his celebrated namesake of the Beanstalk. The bulging
and contorted skulls dug up at Wroxeter are doubtless the remains of
some of the enormous louts who were destroyed either by one of
those two Champions, or by one of the Seven, or by some other
equally doughty, deliverer. Perhaps it was Guy of Warwick, who
extirpated all those other Guys. Geology has already, proved the
literal correctness of those records of the nursery which allege, the
former existence of dragons; authentic animals whose relics we behold
in the bones of the flying saurians. There is every season to suppose
that they belched smoke and fire. Archaeology, hand in hand with the
sister science, demonstrates, in the amorphous skulls discovered at
Wroxeter, the kindred fact, that this island was, once the abode of a
race of horribly absurd wretches at least .." allied to Cormoran,
Blunderbore, and, their gigantic brotherhood, by their º mugs.
None but the obstinately incredulous can refuse to believe in the British
griffins of old, and the giants who, physiognomically, must have very
closely resembled the griffins.

The PRINCE of WALEs seems having a hard time of it in Canada,
Not merely is he daily bored with deputations, and nightly burthened
with State-dinners, or bothered by State-balls where the folks don't
know the figures of even a quadrille, and His Royal Highness has to
teach his partners how, to polk; but besides all this, it seems, the
Prince is hourly pestered with inanimate annoyances, in the shape of
presents made to him by advertising tradesmen, whose aim is that
their names should be mentioned in the papers in connection with the
Prince. As a sample of this dodge, and not, the least unpleasant one,
we find the following reported in the Daily News:—
“PRrsenTs for THE PRINCE of WALEs –A Canadian paper says, our friend
Robinson, the scissors-grinder, has prepared a rustic chair for presentation; and
weventure to predict that His Royal Highness will not see anything in Canada with
which he will be more astonished than he will be with this same chair. It is orna-
mented with snakes and serpents, as well as woodcuts of Lord PALMERston and
LoRD John Russell, who are supposed to be waiting for an audience with the
Prince. MR. Robinson has also made two walking-sticks for His Royal Highness,
one of which is painted black, and is intended to be used at funerals only."
Qf course the Falls of Niagara will fall into the shade in comparison
with the chair which “our friend Robinson, the scissors grinder,” has
been preparing to “astonish” the mind of the young Prince. If the
prediction of the Canadian reporter be fulfilled, nothing in the way of
nature or of art will come up to this wondrous piece of sedentary
location; with its fanciful adornment of snakes entwined with serpents
(will the writer by the next mail teach us to distinguish them?), where-
with our two first statesmen are appropriately placed. The walking-
sticks moreover were most º selected: for everybody knows
how much our nobles use them, and how no funeral equipment is
esteemed complete without them.
We could wish though MR. RoBINsoN, before he got his gifts in
readiness, had considered if His Royal Highness cif receive them,
without sacrificing somewhat the #. of England, and of England's
Sovereign whom he represents. To make our Princes presents implies
that they have need of the articles presented, and this clearly is an
insult to the country of their birth. If Royalty wants rustic chairs
John BUIL can afford to pay for them, and need not be beholden to
Colonial MR. Robinsons to supply the Royal want., M.R. BULL, did
not send his eldest son to Canada to be treated like a beggar by whom
the smallest contributions, walking-sticks included, would be thankfully
received. ...MR. Robinson no doubt had not the least intention of
insulting MR. Bull. All that he intended was, just to get his name
put forward in the newspapers, as one of the 'cute traders who tried
to do a stroke of business by toadying the Prince. But MR. BULL
will not allow his Royal boys in this way to be made commercial tra-
vellers, by being º when travelling for purposes of trade. And he
therefore gives this scissors-grinder a rap upon the knuckles with one
of his own walking-sticks, and assures him, that his absence from the
Royal precincts will always be esteemed more highly than his presents

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
August 20. Monday. The Lords doing crank-work—grinding away
with almost profitless exertion at the nearly needless measures sent
them by the Commons. ... From this *:::::::::: of their, labours must,
however, be excepted their Second Reading of the Bill for providing
Fortifications, which, with all due deference to LoRD PALMERSTON's
French “friend,” can neither be regarded as. º: nor needless;
On this point spake, LoRD ELLENBoRough, with his usual spirit, and
perhaps with something more than his usual common sense:–
“I vote for this measure most willingly, because I entertain that firm distrust of
the French Government which Lord John RUSSELL frankly told the French Govern-
ment months ago all the world would entertain if that Government persevered in
its scheme for annexing Savoy and Nice. . . . . And because when a man has
once so committed himself by his conduct as to give reason to suppose that he does
not act from pure motives, those who believe him afterwards—say what he may-
deserve any misfortune that may befall them.”
If this should catch, the eye of Our Foreign Correspondent it may
explain why his kind letter was not received so gushingly in England
as he hoped; for nine Englishmen in ten are of LoRD ELLENBoRough's
opinion, and the tenth would be so, too, if he did but read his
Punch.
The Commons met at half-past three, and before they got to business
had their usual go of gab. Among the hundred other interesting
topics which were talked of, SIR. W. GALLwey complained of the con-
dition of Victoria Street, where, thanks to the exertions of a Commis.
sion, called facetiously the “ Westminster Improvement” one, houses
are in ruins, and their inmates are in rags, and sites for building are so
filthy they are not fit to be seen. As a climax to the horrors of this
Carthage of a place, which deserves the word Delenda to mark it in
the map, SIR. W. GALLwey said, that in a corner near the Abbey, the
Dean and Chapter had constructed a most hideous erection, which
“outside looked like a nunnery, and was inside, he understood, a den
of attorneys” (!). If SIR. W. º wishes to improve our public
thoroughfares (which are many of them so foul that no fair one can
walkthorough them), there are other hideous nuisances for him to try his
handon: such, for instance, as the organ-fiends, the singing blacks, and
howling bellowers, who especially infest the “quiet” streets and
squares, where decent people who pay taxes have to live, and work,
and sleep—that is, if, having been born deaf, or being blest with nerves
of cast-iron, they can contrive to do so... Mr. Punch, he need not say,
will be “the man for GALLwey,” should that gentleman want help to

bring all these street nuisances beneath the operation of the Nuisances
Removal Act. -
The Syrian §: being opened, LoRD PALMERSTON protested, in
reply to MR. Monsell, that he thought it was of vital consequence to
Europe that one of the Two Sick Men should be kept still alive, and
capable of kicking; for there undoubtedly would be a jolly row, among
his neighbours # he even were dismembered, or, worse still, became
defunct. Then an Irish row of the first magnitude arose, in
reference to the Irish Party Emblems Bill, which, MR. HENNEssy
protested was the “hoighth of insult;” while several other Members,
who by their ºf: owned the sister-kingdom, as their mother,
declared they felt the Bill a degradition to their counthree, and,
bedad, they meant to foight it to the last dhrop of their breath.
Tuesday. Lords still at the crank. Commons in the morning got
through a little business and a lot of talk. . In the evening another of
the Innocents was Massacred; but as the innocent was nothing more
than a small Bill for doing something for the natives of New Zealand,
(which, since you ask the question, Wiscount is a long way off), of course
the House was moved but little by the sacrifice, the only motion being
that it should be made. - - - -
A discussion then took place upon the Bill for Naval Discipline
which LoRD CHARLEs PAGET explained was to supersede an Act passed
in the reign of CHARLEs THE Second, that had since, then been the
textbook of our navailaw. It was thought that as this old Act had
now seen service for two centuries, there might be some few holes in it
which required repairing; but on being overhauled it was found, like
the gunboats, in such a rotten state, that the Government resolved
that it should be put out of commission, and that a new one should be
launched, spick and span, to take its place. The Bill (which in the
main was approved by almost all the great naval authorities, including
MR.AYRTON and MR. Wiscount WILLIAMs), will usefully facilitate the
holding of courts-martial, and will secure them an extension of their
power to give punishment, by allowing them mºre liberty tº sentence
men to less of it. Traitors, and only traitors, will, without alternative,
if found guilty, suffer death; but cowards and deserters, and all lesser
offenders, including thieves and drunkards, will be *: by im-
prisonment, by flogging, or dismissal, it being left to the Coºl;
martial, in its judgment, to judge which. So when Jack has his Gill
(and something more, perha ; of spirits, and his grog, by ill-luck
happens to get into his head, he will not of necessity be made a marked
man (on his back) for it. Eight-and-forty lashes is the maximum of

of any sort will suffer it. As the Cat has been considered one of the
worst hindrances to the manning of our fleets, Mr. Punch would give
due prominence to the above-recorded facts... He would note too, that
LoRD PAGET “could show, by sure, statistics, that this degrading
punishment is steadily decreasing, and º but certainly dyin
out of the service.” So cheer up, my lads! Take heart, ye hearts o
oak! Your old enemy is clearly now on its last legs. Although the
Cat may have as many lives as tails, there is no 'doubt that common
sense will ere long be the death of it. “Jack Tar” is said to be
derived from jactari, to boast: and certainly our Jack Tars may boast
that by good conduct they are gradually driving the Cat out of the
rvice.
With the exception of a word or two about the DFAN of York, the
doubling of whose snug little salary M.R., BERNAL Osboºn; spoke of
as “the great job of the Session,” the whole remainder of the evening
was occupied by what one can but call a Jolly Row, on the subject of
the Bill A. the Roman Catholic Charities, which was proposed to
"amended”, by striking out Clause I, MR. HENNEssy declared that
so far from being viewed as a charitable act, the measure now must
rather be regarded as a penal one; and although his name, he owned
was on its back, he wished the Bill to be dishonoured and returne
with “no effects.” This wish was repeated by CARDINAL WISEMAN's
echo (need Punch mention SIR GEORGE Bowy ERP), who indulged in
such a quantity of kind remarks about the Government, that the
SPEAKER had to tell him he was getting “unparliamentary,” and Lord
PALMERsroN, accused him of “not being a master of his own
...” which, as he talked the best of Billingsgate, was a rather
Cruel Cut.
Wednesday. In the Commons MR. CochRANE wished to know if MR.
Evelyn, “the fined old English gentleman,” would, because of his
high character, be let off paying the £500 imposed for his late lark at
Guildford. Whereto SIRCORNEwALL LEwis replied, he had no doubt
of the High Sheriff's high character, but that was no apology for his
low behaviour. If he wanted to be let off, he should petition the
Home Secretary, and not bother the House; but his better plan would
be to make two notes in EveLYN's Diary: Mem. To fork out the Five
Hundred; and Mem. Don't insult a Judge again!
The Union of City Benefices Bill then came on for discussion, and
was eventually ordered to be reported, but actually not until no fewer
than fifty-nine short speeches had been made on it.
The House adjourned at 5'40, when the Government proceeded (by
a Citizen steamboat) to discuss by far the most important business of
the day:-viz., their annual Whitebait Feed at the Trafalgar Hotel,
Greenwich. "Covers were laid for thirty; nearly all of whom remem-

hand of the Chair. The dinner that was served, was, worthy of the
occasion, and so was Mr. Punch's appetite, which indeed but rarely
fails him when there is something good to eat. It was, however,
noticed that the bait were rather large; another penalty entailed by a
late Session on our senators, and which, it may be hoped, they will not
º forget. The only toast worth recording was the health of Mr.
Punch; and this, LoRD PALMERSTON proposed in an elegant oration,
which Mr. Punch's modesty forbids him to report. Having gone into
Committee on the Provisional Expenses Bill, which was not laid upon
the table until rather, a late hour, the Members of both Houses
adjourned to Mr. Punch's residence, where the sitting, like the Session,
had its end in smoke.
Thursday. Being up so late last night, both Houses adjourned early;
Lords knocking off at six, and Commons being actually Counted Out
be at eight., But before they called their Hansoms, they passed the Bills
for Naval Discipline, and for Union of Benefices, and (in spite of SIR
G. Bowy ER, who said that there was no morality in England now that
divorces had become as cheap a luxury as pine-apples) they read a
Second Time the Divorce Court Bill. Moreover, they found time for
lamenting with Lord PALMERston, that the PAshA of EGYPT had been
sold by buying shares in the Suez Čanal bubble; and they listened for
some minutes to SIR DE LAcy. Evans, who wants to see a biggish fort
or two stuck on Shooter's Hill, and if he f: them (as a tax-payer,
Punch wishes that he may !) will probably then ask to have the ditto
done for Primrose.
Friday. The Lorp Chancellor brought in a Bill to repeal a heap
of statutes which, although as old and obsolete as a Court of Justice
jokes, have by some slip only been “impliedly repealed.” This Bill
he observed, would lop off a lot of useless limbs from the body of the
law, so that what is now so bulky will collapse into a moderate and
manageable size. His Lordship also called attention to the law
reforms which have been effected in the Session, and delivered an
affecting funeral oration upon such of his sixteen small legal children
as had died. Of these he specially lamented the fate of all his seven
little Criminal Innocents, who had been massacred most cruelly in the
other House.
At half-past six the Commons were again Counted Out, there being
only 3 and 20 Members present. This result was partly caused by some
curious remarks which were let fall by SIR GEORGE Bowy ER, on the
subject of the doings of the hero, GARIBALDI; whom, with singular
consistency he first of all denounced as an “unprincipled pirate,” and
then fittingly belikened to that “patriotic” person, TANTIA Topee!
r. Punch of course could not stop to listen to such balderdash as
Bowy ER's, and so shut up his note-book, and hailed the nearest
Hansom; an example which the Commons showed their Commons
sense by following.

“EARL GRANville's mention of “striking work' in
reference to noble Lords, was certainly calculated to elicit
ejaculations of remonstrance. But there is too much reason
to believe that the protest of “Qh, oh!” had a much less
lofty meaning, and was intended to express, not any dis-
approbation of the terms which the noble £ail condes.

which those extremely vermacular terms served his Lord-
ship to convey. Where—as the late MR. Liston might
have demanded-where is the dignity of recognising such
familiar forms of speech? Familiarity doth breed contempt
and contempt will entail political extinction. What would
the great LoRD CHATHAM have thought of speaking of
the House of Lords as ready to “strike work?” He would
have probably fainted at the very idea, and thus have pre-
maturely afforded the subject which he furnished to the
pencil of CoPLEY. At all events, before venturing to use
such an expression, he would undoubtedly have exchanged
the flowing and majestic wig of the statesman for the arti-

further proof than the recent exhibition of the far-famed Talking Fish, whose premature
decease was almost nationally deplored. , The second interesting truth is stated in these
words by SIR EMERson. TENNENT, to whom, as one of the distinguished patrons of its
grandmother, the Bloater in the narrative so feelingly referred:—
“I distinctly heard the sounds in question. They came up from the water of Lake Chilka, in Ceylon,
like the gentle thrills of a musical chord, or the faint vibrations of a wineglass, when its rim is rubbed by a
wet r. It was not one sustained note, but a multitude ºf tiny sounds, each clear and distinct in
itself: the sweetest treble mingling with the lowest bass. On applying the ear to the woodwork of the boat,
the vibration was greatly increased in volume by conduction. F. sounds varied considerably at different

original locality the sounds were at once renewed."
-" Still further to prove the existence of these fish, which it appears are not confined to the
waters of Ceylon, another eminent naturalist, DR. Apºs, tells us—
“While in the brig Ariel, then lying off the mouth of the river of Borneo, I had the good fortune ... ...ear the
solemn aquatic concert of the far-famed organ-fish, or drum—a species of Pogonias. These singular fishes
produce a loud monotonous singing sound, which rises and falls and sometimes dies away, or assumes a
very low drumming character; and the noises appeared to proceed mysteriously from the bottom of the
vessel. This strange submarine chorus of fishes continued to amuse us for about a quarter of an hour, when
the music, if so it can be called, suddenly ceased, probably on the dispersion of the band of performers.”
“Sir, the statements of these naturalists are, to my mind, quite as strange as the tales of
supernaturalists, which, instead of crediting, you hold in sad contempt. DR. ADAMs says that

SHAKSPEARE speaks of calling, spirits from the ‘vasty deep,” and is not, this, Sir, I would
ask, the clearest proof that he believed in their marine existence? and will you, Sir, dare to
pityour knowledge against his, and cast your grovelling doubts upon the grand truths he
believed in? Sir, the story of the Singing
Bloater, as narrated in your columns, may have
possibly seemed “Strange ’ to you, but there
cannot be a shadow of a doubt that it is “True.”
And if, after all the pains I have taken to con-

at the corner of Chancery Lane, against MR.
JERvis, a barrister, and Treasurer of an Insti-
tution called the Social Club, to recover
£14 6s. 11d. for a supper had at the London
in December, 1859. In the report of the case it
is stated that—
“Thirty-three sat down to supper, and they managed
to dispose of no less than thirty-eight crown bowls of
punch, besides beer and wine and spirits, for which they
paid at the time. There were also items for pipes,
tobacco, and broken glass, which were not disputed.”
The Social Club is described, as composed
of “members of the bar, military officers,
merchants, and gentlemen.” 'hey are
stated to have “proceeded with their merri-
ment and enjoyment until four o'clock in the
morning.”
The item for broken glass in MR. SAwyer's
account was probably very considerable. Thirty-
eight crown bowls of punch alone, imbibed by
thirty-three persons, might be expected to in-
volye a very large, breakage of that fragile
article. Add to all that punch an indefinite
quantity of wine, beer, and spirits, and the result
will in any case probably, be the comminution
of every vitreous and fictile vessel on the table,
and indeed in the room. On the occasion in
question, the crown bowls most likely went as
well as their contents, and it was a mercy if no
cracked crowns, as well as cracked bowls, were
the consequence. The charge for broken glass
was wisely not disputed—it was no doubt indis-
putable. It would be satisfactory to know that
glass vessels were the only tumblers that sus-
tained any damage on this festive occasion.
The Dangers of Steeple-Chasing.
If the Union of Benefices Bill be carried out,
“Woe,” cry the Architects, to all WREN's
exquisite City steeples.” In fact, when these
architectural master-pieces are pulled down, we
may give a new interpretation to the, famous
#. on the great designer of St. Paul's. “Si
monumentum quaeras, circumspice.”—“If you ask
É. hiº, Monument, don't you wish you may
find it.”

Piscator. “Oho! THIs Is THE PLACE where THE BIG TROUT ARE, Is It? THEN THIs Is THE sort of FLY, I THINK!"
THE WARNING OF THE WHITEBAIT.
In th’Arabian Nights Entertainments,
Is a tale of a little fish talking,
And though such piscatorial attainments
May be nothing to tables a-walking,
And Mediums revealing themselves at the . -
Pulled up, through unlicensed and grave spirit-dealing,
There’ve been cases of Whitebait-served up as the right bait,
And arm-chairs up ottomans stalking—
And though he who wishes to hear vocal fishes—
we credit SIR EMERson TENNENT,
Needn't seek them in magic Egyptian dishes,
Nor beneath MENDEz PINTö's broad pennant—
But in Chilka's fair lake may hear the fish make
A concert at dusk, which for rhyme's urgent sake,
May best be described as “surprenant.”
Still one can't quite expect to be heard with respect,
When one states that on MR. HART's premises,
To a party who'd just steamed down Thamesis—
Giving vent to discourse full of logic and force,
Though such tales we accept as mere matters of course
In the regions once ruled o'er by RAMESEs.
Yet this, I’ve heard tell, very lately befell,
In the course of that Cabinet dinner, -
Which is held when the Session—with languid progression,
And House growing thinner and thinner.—
O'er Saharas of speeches, that Pisgah- oint reaches,
Whence the green land of leisure tired statesmen beseeches;
To enter and take up possession.
For this feast, as all know, the Cabinet go
To Greenwich, and every dish is
(From the carp, souché stewed in, to Cabinet pudding)
Emblematic of loaves and of fishes;
But flounders and plaice are forbidden, in case
Of their prompting a pun to some blunderer's face—
An omission that’s highly judicious.
The initiate assure us that Cabinet jollity,
As displayed with discreetly closed doors,
If you measure by quantity rather than quality,
nofficial facetiousness floors. - - - --
And through key-holes and ghinks oose out hints of high jinks,
When official reserve at wild rollicking winks,
And the soul red-tape's band over-soars.
'Twas just—in the dinner of Wednesday last,-
As the fun to this maximum drew—
When the mirth ministerial wax'd furious and fast,
And e'en Lewis was almost warm'd through; . .
While #. slapp'd GLADSTONE's back, Lowe hailed Russell
as -- AC -
And ARGYLL tickled BETHELL in playful attack,
And SoMERset courteous grew—
The Whitebait—course first—had gone round, and the burst
Of voracity drew to a pause, - -
When, an extra-sized fish from the half-emptied dish
Expanded its sore-battered jaws, .
With a “List, list, oh, list!”–and in ev'ry fist .
Knife and fork hung suspended, hairs slowly uprist,
As the fish thus 'gan pleading its cause:-
“Broil ye not in your shame!, shades of UDE and CAREME
With the pang that your spirits must own, .
To see thus shovelled down wretched Whitebait done brown,
Qf dimensions till this year unknown!
Fish, fated as fecund, on this Twenty-second
Of August–a month past the time when we reckoned
The perils of Greenwich outgrown!
“In the House week by week, it was still speak, speak, speak;
Ev'ry ill had its measure, but talk;
And Bill after Bill, howe'er puff'd, turned out ill,—
What the House could not bungle, ’t would baulk.
There sat Bunkum, enthroned in ſº à la Russell;
Ambition, in GLADSTONE-Finance; Bounce and Bustle
Incarnate in BETHELL did stalk.

TIT-BITS FROM THE “TABLET.”
oMETIMEs a dig into the Tablet
Roman Catholic newspaper will
reward the humorous explorer
with many absurdities. Subjoined
are a few gems of precious quality
and various kind, derived, all of
them, from the mine formed by the
last number of that wonderful
journal. The first, to be sure,
occurs in a letter from Rome,
quoted from the Cork Eraminer.
It relates to the “Pope's Qwn;”
the soldiers of the Irish Brigade
in Rome; of whom its author thus
reports:-
“I can say that one is struck by their
religious attitude, not a nominal but a
genuine one (sono religiosi non di nome
madi opera).”
These Irish are, of eourse, en-
thusiastic papists. The religious
attitude of such devotees is very
peculiar. An idea of it may be
obtained by an inspection of the
pictures of saints exhibited in the
windows of Roman Catholic book-
shops. . Many, of the , canonised
#. and ladies are delineated praying with twisted necks or
islocated limbs, in quite miraculous postures. One species of the
religious attitude º il. by those pious but grotesque personages
is that of ogling a skull, another that of making an obeisance to an
image precisely similar to the curtsey, which ballet-dancers are accus-
tomed to drop before pachas and princes, apparently meaning, “See
how submissive I am, and at the same time how very interesting and
pretty. I look.” Considering this last variety of the religious atti;
tude in question, one might almost suppose that a joke was intended
by the statement that the Pope's Irish soldiers are religious “non di
nome ma di opera.” - - - - - - -
The next good thing lies in the simplicity with which the desire
quoted verbally in the following piece of foreign intelligence is treated
as something extraordinary:-
* “At one of the late public feasts in Modena, the astonished population read the
following inscription inscribed by the scholars on a brilliant transparency:-"Vog:
liamo lavera Religione senza Papa e senza Preti."—"We wish true Religion without
either Pope or Priests.”
As if this wish were a very unreasonable or very novel, one. _, ,
º the Tablet treats us to the ensuing outbreak, in which, a
remarkable, strength of language will perhaps be considered to be
curiously blended with a corresponding weakness in every other respect
but that of bigotry:-
“We are not prepared to deny that there may be a diabolical cunning and an
infernal sagacity in the policy pursued by which NAPolkon THE THIRD has been
outbidden and 3…..”and by which #. Italian revolution, unchained by him
for his own selfish purposes, has been converted into a danger and a difficulty for
him from which it is hard to discover any means of escape."
Grant that the policy of wishing the deliverance of Italy from caps
of silence, noisome dungeons, bastinado, hot-bottomed chairs, and
Bourbonic and Austrian rule which rests on these appliances, together
with papal domination, which is allied with that of Bourbon and Haps-
burg, is diabolical and infernal. Admit that the Fº is altogether
infernal and diabolical, still where is the cunning of it? Did England
eyer make a secret of its desire to see the pontifical despotism and the
absolute monarchy of Naples abolished? Is it particularly cunning, at
least, to go about roaring, “No Popery !” or chalking that popular
exclamation up openly on the walls? Infernal straightforwardness and
diabolical downrightness are the sins of which the Tablet should accuse
British policy. .. Qur outrageous contemporary pº. regards as a
master-stroke of diabolical cunning on the part of LoßD PALMERston
and Loºp John Russº LL the Government's connivance at the enlist-
ment of the poor, Paddies who went out to fight the Pope's battles for
a consideration which proved to be “monkey's allowance,” and who
have returned wiser and leaner men, and ragamuffins more squalid than
they were when they started. This result the Tablet may believe to
have been contrived by the Ministry with the diabolically cunning
and infernally. ious view of destroying the confidence of the
faithful Irish in their priesthood, and thus as it were diminishing the
ºl. of Erin, or opening the eyes of Hibernia and abating the green
in them.

A GEM FROM THE EMERALD ISLE.
RenundancIEs in writing are not considered elegant: and in
advertisements especially they are to be avoided, for unnecessary words
are not printed without cost. Had the writer of the following borne
this fact in mind, he would not have afforded us a laugh at his expense,
which luxury we enjoyed on Thursday the 9th ultimo:—
IN QUIRY.—D. A. S., late of Dublin, is earnestly requested, by his
Irish correspondent in Paris, to WRITE (if living), regardless of circumstances,
20th of June being long since passed.
There is something so Hibernian in requesting that a person will
please to write “if living,” that the advertiser scarcely need have said
that he was “Irish,” the fact being quite patent from the two words
introduced. Whether, these two words cost the writer somethin
extra, we need not waste our space in endeavouring to guess: but i
they did, he will at least have this great consolation, that without them
what he wrote would not have gained a place in Punch.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM OUR COCKNEY CORRESPONDENT.
“York, August, 20th.
O my request to be kind enough
to allow me a holiday, dear
Mr. Punch, you obligingly re-
plied, ‘Oh, be off; ' and added
that in consideration of my long
and invaluable services, you
would gladly defray all the
expenses of my endeavours to
recruit the health wasted in
your service,” so I feel myself
bound to send you a few flying
notes of my journey.
“Having never been out of
London before in all my life
(except on occasion of a single
visit to Gravesend, when I
suffered so severely from sea-
sickness, that I resolved never
again, to tempt the billowy
ocean) my letters may be the
more valuable to §". because
they will convey the fresh and
vivid impressions made upon a
oung, enthusiastic, and intel-
igent individual, who is not a
Blazey, as the French say. I do not affect to suppose that I shall cast
a new light upon the condition of England; no person but my gifted
friend the Editor of the Morning Advertiser can make himself thoroughly
acquainted with a country during a run across it in a railway carriage;
but I trust that the navetey of my sketches may atone for their
possible want of originality. - - -
“At present, Sir, I am in York, which you are aware is an ancient
Deanery of a Dean, to whom, because he was already a very rich gen-
tleman, the Church, authorities have given a very large increase of
income. Into the history of York I do not know that it is necessary
for me to enter at any length, but I think it right to state that the
sanatory reformers have a good deal to do there—comparisons are
odorous, SHAKSPEARE says, and I should think that there must be a
ſ. many comparisons, in York, º there is no comparison
etween its Cathedral and anything in London or Gravesend,
“But, Sir, what has astonished me most, is the extreme inaccuracy
of the ideas which I—and I suppose thousands of other inhabitants of
the Metropolis—have been accustomed to entertain in respect of the
Yorkshire people and their habits. I have been accustomed to visit
the theatres a good deal, Mr. Punch, and we all know that the stage
holds the mirror up to Nature. Well, Sir, wishing, to compare ºf:
verities of Nature with the transcripts of Art, I took the earliest oppor:
tunity of placing myself upon a bridge which forms the principal
thoroughfare of York. Here, Sir, with a note-book in my hand, and a
pleasant smile on my face, I prepared to be amused, but in a kindly
way, with the sterling honesty and rough humour which so delights us
in the mimic scene. In order to give the Yorkshireman the oppor-
tunity of developing his nature, I accosted the first who seemed #.
to be a good specimen of his race. He was a tall, stalwart, broadfaced,
powerful fellow.
“. Four Correspondent. This is indeed a noble city, my friend, inte-
resting in its archaeological features, which present so remarkable a
combination of Pagan and Catholic type; ºf favoured in its locality,
which enables it at once to invite agricultural and mercantile contri.
butions to its prosperity.
“Yorkshire Individual, Ay, it be a main foine place, but to my moind
the foinest thing about it loike be the honest hearts that beat .
the bosoms of its sons, and that liſt 'em as high as yon Minster above
aught that is debasing and degrading, mun.
“At least, Mr. Punch, that is what I expected him to say, with a
slap on his waistcoat. I regret to add, however, that what he said
was,
“‘Thee be dom'd ''
"And that what he did was, to shove your correspondent into the
gutter, and walk on without the least, allusion to the latter's being a
stranger, to whom it be our duty to show koindness like, if he bain't
too proud to accept the humble fare of the honest peasant, whose roof
may be lowly, but who would bend to no haughty ". that ever hid
his head in his spangled coronet.
“But we must not judge of a whole county by a single individual,
and having witnessed upon the stage the frank and hearty hospitality
of the Yorkshireman, and being moreover uncommonly thirsty,...I
crossed the bridge, and observing through an open window a family

at º early dinner I approached, and putting my head in, said,
gally :- -
“‘I am a stranger in these parts, and have travelled far, and am
hungry and thirsty. Need I say more?”
“The Paterfamilias, a very respectable looking person, rose from the
table, and I expected to hear him exclaim, - -
“‘Coom in, mun, what dost stond there talking for—eat and drink
first, and talk after if thee be so minded, but do not wrong the warm-
hearted Yorkshireman by utterin' a doubt like whether all he have be
not at the wayfarer's service. Dom it, SARAH, stick feyther's old
chair for the gentleman.”
“But I am sorry to say that instead of this, he approached the
window, and F. across the road, said, -
“‘You will find excellent hotel accommodation at that house, Sir.’
“And he closed the window so rapidly, that if I had not drawn back
my head with considerable speed, I should have been guillotined.

up Micklegate to the Bar (where the heads of the DUKE of York, and
the young Duke of RUTLAND were placed; but I suppose they have
been removed, as I could see no traces of them), and meeting a pretty,
rosy-faced, dark-eyed girl (whose hat I must say was º;
like any lady's hat in Oxford Street), I began, smilingly,–
“‘I am a stranger in these parts, my pretty lass, but where such
lº eyes and such ruby lips are found, I am sure that gentleness
* kindness must reign supreme, and the stranger may dispel his
errors.'
“The young lady looked at me for a moment, and did not seem to
know what to say. So I went on, as I have heard MR. John Cooper
do in a score of comedies of English manners. -
“‘Doubtless, fair one, you were expecting a more welcome arrival–

attachment, and sure am I that no other could be inspired by those
dear eyes. Tell me, is it RoBIN, or LUBIN, for whom thy minutes lag

up the corner of her apron, and looking down, - -

my mother's cottage, and rest in the old arm-chair—we have no dainties,
but if a dish of cream, and strawberries of my own gathering can

“And at least, Sir, if she could not say that, she needed not to have
said to a great policeman, B. 54, an exact facsimile of a London
Bobby, only bigger—
**This person is ºf me.” -
“And why did that stupid and powerful owl walk me off, despite all
my clamour, to the police-station, whence I was not delivered until
late in the evening, and then through the good offices of the landlord
of my hotel, who got me out, civilly enough, but, would not
in the least believe my story, and who, when he had taken my eager
orders for supper, went out of the room, saying, slily,–
“‘This isn't London, you know, Sir.’ -
“Confound it, Mr. Pinch, I knew it was not London, but neither
was it Yorkshire, so far as I had been taught. I begin to think these
playwriting ple are humbugs.

SMITH O'BRIEN'S CONWICTION.
THE Morning News, Irish paper, publishes a letter, addressed to
“Monsieur MARIE MARTIN, #. r * that Frenchman for
his pamphlet on La Question, Irlandaise, and for the complimentary
language which accompanied the present thereof. In conclusion, the
writer assures M. MARTIN of “the existence of a disposition on the

rights and to ãº their character;” adding:—
“Such being my conviction, I venture in their name to thank you for your past
labours in their cause. I have the honour to be yours, very faithfully,

MR. SMITH O'BRIEN's conviction was a conviction for High Treason,

to have greatly affronted him. In corresponding with an enemy of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
l
MR. SPURGEON'S TOUR ON THE CONTINENT.
My dear friends and hearers, who, constant appearers
In this Tabernacle, are purposed, I trust,
Me long to sit under, whenever I thunder,
Who to build up these walls have come down with the dust,
To edification º peregrination
Would tend, if related, you seem to suppose,
I omitted to book it, as easy I took it,
But some few rough sketches to give you—here goes!
For Antwerp from London, in health somewhat undone,
I started, attended by many a friend,
I say that f started, but we were soon parted,
Because my companions left me at Gravesend.
blessings a cargo—thereon no embargo—
Did freight the steam-packet that bore us away;
An Essex man Captain, rich anecdote apt in,
We kept telling tales to each other all day.
At Antwerp we landed, and when we commanded
A view of the noble Cathedral, behold,
Out came a procession—perhaps from confession—
Of peasants and priests holding candles—large mould.
The consumption of tallow intended to hallow
The festive occasion was truly immense;
Some lamps, too, were bearing; the sun meanwhile flaring,
But when folks burn daylight their darkness is dense
Now Antwerp's a city which we can but pity,
Though some for its wondrous religion extol, -
Full of carved Virgin Maries; and each of them varies
From a Queen on her throne to a little black doll.
In each street and alley presides this Aunt Sally
Over shops; and a tar of the true British type
Declared, honest JACK, he had purchased his 'backy
At a shop where the Virgin sat smoking her pipel
Our vessel exported a gang, ill-assorted,
f Irish, to serve in the Papal brigade,
And thanks to their sender, and skipper, I tender,
For such a lot out of the country conveyed.
Their luggage was lighter than e'er loaded fighter,
They had one pocket handkerchief—there the list stops—
The Captain well prized them—thus characterised them—
He said “they were not fit to cut up for mops.”
Such tatterdemalions to thrash the Italians,
Oh, doesn't the Pontiffjust wish he may get
His guards to be guarded will have, or discarded;
I never beheld such a beautiful set.
May Ireland's brave nation soon find occupation
More noble than propping a rotten old throne,
Which stands but to crumble; I pray it may tumble,
And brave GARIBALDI o'erthrow the “Pope's Own.”
Some things I can’t mention repelled my attention,
Exposed in that Catholic Antwerp for sale;
But I found a strong feeling all Belgium revealing
'Gainst Louis NApoleon; a symptom I hail.
Our ties are more German: 1 heard a good sermon
At Brussels, although it was preached by a priest.
Men smoking, toil shirking, I saw women working:
If their husbands they whacked, they’d have my leave at least.
Cologne, so high is it, I’ll never revisit;
Such smells insupportable poison the air.
Than the eye more the nose is affected, with roses
By no means, but quite with another thing there.
Each yard still excelling the last in vile smelling,
As onward I travelled—l don't know of what—
I had ne'er before smelt it, severely I felt it,
I cannot say whether’t was Pop'ry or not.
At experience aiming, I witnessed the gaming
At Baden; ne'er saw a more terrible sight.
At rouge-et-noir playing, their precious souls slaying,
Why even the women there sit up all night!
Oh! none of you gamble, for if, in the scramble,
You lose, serve #; right, 'tis still worse if you’ve won.
For in that case Old Harry the winnings will carry
Away with the winner, as sure as a gun.
THE FLIGHT OF THE EAGLE OF NAPLES.
No wonder AQUILA flies to his brother Eagle at Paris. Society in
aris, we hear, is rotten—and “where the carcase is,” there we know
“The Eagles will be gathered together.”
A HORSE-CARPET FOR KENSINGTON GARDENS
THE Pºiº against the new horse-ride in Kensington Gardens has
received the signatures of so many pedestrian snobs that it extends to
the length of half a mile. HoRse CowPER—as the originator of the
equestrian improvement in question deserves to be entitled for his
chivalry—should show the wretches whose plebeian names are affixed
to that mean parochial document at what a price he estimates them,
their opinions, and wishes, by causing it to be unrolled and laid down
along the tract of beautiful’soft mud into which he is turnin what
was formerly mere turf, between the Round Pond and the Palace.
The petition would be so nice for the horses’ feet; and in trampling
thereupon, by an act of graceful defiance, MR. Cowper and the 'Ossy
party will, with a pardonable ostentation, indicate that they have got
the ridiculous admirer of " beauty and repose" under their hoofs.
THE GENTS OF THE PRESS.
WRITERs for the newspapers are called in common parlance the
Gentlemen of the Press. There are, however, some among them who,
if they had their rights, would more properly be known as the No
Gentlemen of the Press. These “parties” care but little for their duty
to their neighbour, and can no more, keep their pens from lying and
from slandering, than they can keep their ears from eavesdropping and
their eyes from keyholes. They are no respecters of persons or mahog-
anies, and whenever they accept a private invitation, it is with the
intention to make public use of anything that happens to occur. If
their memory should fail, they have recourse to their invention, and as
they have to please the palate of a morbid class of readers, who are
º a healthy appetite for wholesome literary food, they season
what they scribble with a spice of gross impertinence, and are
; apt to flavour it with a sprinkling of scandal, and a soupçon of
gros set. -
To show the estimation in which the labours of these literary
“gents” are held, we cite the following extract from a letter by MR.
Cobden, who has personally had reason to complain of what they
write:—
“The paragraph you enclosed, giving a conversation o mine, is one of those
rascally acts of ºf for which American newspaper writers are so noto-
rious. There is a good deal of the paragraph which agrees with what I have
thought, but whether I expressed it in private conversation is more than I could
swear to, as no one expects to be made responsible for private gossip. There ought
to be the punishment of the pillory or the stocks revived for those who publish in
newspapers the unguarded remarks which fall from a man in private conversation,
when he frequently speaks merely to provoke a reply and keep people from going
to sleep over too serious an interchange of views.”
If we remember º MR. CoRDEN, used, to stick up for the
Yankee press-wrights, and declare that their cheap papers were far
better than our dear ones. But MR, COBDEN has seen reason to alter
his opinion, and now acknowledges that cheapness is sometimes found
in union with that which is not niceness. In this era of refinement
there is little hope of clapping scandalmongers in the stocks; but
Mr. Punch's public pillory will always be found open for any literary
blackguard who deserves to be exposed in it.

STARTLING INTELLIGENCE.
We have been for some weeks daily startled out of some of our five
senses by the sight of a small paragraph in big type in the Times, which
every morning ºccupies a most conspicuous position, and cannot fail to
catch the eye of constant readers like ourselves in glancing down the
page. The Fº flits dodgily about the inner sheet; now appearing
just, at the end of the last leader, and anon being inserted at the close
of the Court Circular, or with the maniacal, returns of conscience
money to the Exchequer, or as a tit-bit to wind up the ſº Latest
Intelligence. , Our interest and excitement are thus artfully kept up,
for we cannot always, at a glimpse recognise our old acquaintance, as
we might do were it always printed in one place. We therefore every
morning seize upon it with avidity, expecting to discover a most
*...* announcement, such for instance, let us say, as any one of
ese:-
We rejoice to state the fact, that GARIBALDI has stormed. Naples,
and has taken BoMBA prisoner. The Royal miscreant is now in one of
his own dungeons, and will be beheaded (it is hoped) on Monday next.
We are requested to announce that the EARL_óF DERby is now
jº with his old friend MR. BRIGHT, and that LoRD PALMERston
will join them in the course of a few days. . The meeting of these three
statesmen is a political
said to be the base.
It alarms us to have learned that the EMPEROR OF THE FREnch has
completed his arrangements for invading England, and the ceremony
will come off in the middle of next week. The troops will simulta-
neously effect an unmolested landing at Portsmouth, Dover, Plymouth,
John o'Groat's House, and Sheerness; and after having devastated the
outlying districts, will at śjś to demolish Windsor
Castle, and then march on the Metropolis, which they intend to sack.
We believe that we may state, without much fear of contradiction,
that Wiscount WILLIAMs is engaged in completing a big blue book,
arrangement, of which a new Reform Bill is
call that Conductin' a Bus. Oh / THEY wouldn't go / I like that, dºc., &c.”
showing how many cheeseparings he has this year saved the nation,
and what amount of loaves and fishes have been wasted by the Govern-
ment since they first came into place. - -
It charms us to announce that MR. CoBDEN is preparing a new
Treaty, of Commerce, whereby the EMPEROR will pledge himself to
general disarmament; provided only that, to show him our intentions
are pacific, we first disband our Army, sink our Navy, and disarm our
Wolunteers. - - -
We are requested to make known the highly interesting fact, that
Mr. Punch, who is about to complete his Thousandth Number, is making
splendid preparations for this national event. Without undue divulging
|. secrets of the press, it may be confidently prophesied, that this
his Thousandth effort will far exceed in every estimable quality, the
nine hundred and ninety and nine which have so happily preceded it.
Instead of some such startling pieces of intelligence, only just con-
ceive how disappointing it has been to discover only this:—
“We beg to inform our readers that The Times may now be purchased at all
railway stations in England and Wales where newspapers are sold at the price q
fourpence per copy, Travellers who are unable to obtain The Times on demand will
oblige us t; making immediate complaint to the publisher."
Without †.; in the least to dictate to our contemporary, or
interfering in the slightest with its business arrangements, may we not
just drop the hint, that however vastly interesting this statement may
łº, been when it was first put forward, it has now rather lost its
freshness, and is becoming mere stale news? Moreover, now that we
have given it insertion in our columns, we have of course secured for
it a world-wide circulation, and there can therefore be no longer the
least need to repeat it.
ANOTHER,RAP AT THE RAPPERs—One of those humbugs who are
called “Mediums” has been heard to express a fear that, in conse-
quence of the attacks which have been made on it by Punch, the
business of a Spirit-rapper will be soon not worth a rap.

PUNCH*s Essence OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, August 28. At last the weary Session, which like a wounded snake,
had been dragging its slow length along since January the Twenty-fourth,
was this day put an end to by PROTECTOR PUNCH, to whom the labour was
confided of proroguing the Long Parliament. The ceremony took place at a
little after two, in the presence of ten Ladies, three Bishops, and eight Lords,
flanked by a scant sprinkling of the ever faithful Commons. This enumeration
will serve to show what interest was taken in the proceedings, which were
fraught as usual with the most intense excitement.
Upon arriving at the House, PROTECTOR PUNCH was formally conducted
through the Commons, and observing there were actually forty Members
F. he elegantly complimented, them upon their courage, in being seen, in
ondon on the twenty-eighth of August “Forties creanturyortibus,” said he
as he good-humouredly shook, hands with the juvenescent PREMIER, and
whispered something about Nestor looking like Narcissus. - -
Coming to the Woolsack, the PROTEgtoR who had put on the big wig of
the LoRD CHANCELLOR (which Lady Judy said became him charmingly, and he
therefore felt quite proud in it; although, not being used to wear it, he found
the horsehair would tickle his ears), in the usual manner signified the Royal
Assent to exactly fifty bills; º them upon his fingers to make quite
sure they were º right, and that he had not by some accident dropped one in
his journey from Balmoral down to Fleet Street. Then amid the breathless
silence of the House, the PRotector PUNCH proceeded in his usual silver
accents, as HER MAJESTY's Commissioner, to spout this Gracious Speech:-
“My Lords, and you Gentlemen, too, of the Commons,
Pray lend me your ears; as to MARK did the Romans;
We come the misdeeds of the Session to bury,
To praise it, methinks, were preposterous, very.
'Twas a Session of fussing, of talking, not working,
business all shelving, and promises shirking;
And though I may speak on't as “long and laborious,”
In such strenua inertia there’s little that’s glorious.
“To begin my stale news, I am happy to state
That my friends are all friendly, both small ones and great:
France, Russia, and Prussia, and Norway and Swede
É. our runaway rascals, which latter is the den),
olland, Austria, Turkey, and Belgium, and Spain
ºº le, tho' free, still in bond-age remain),
fact all t powers are peaceful I hope,
Excepting young BoMBA, and p'raps that old Pope;
Little wonder that o'er them the battle-cloudlours,
For such weak º fools can be hardly called Powers.
Far more worthy, the name is the brave GARIBALII,
Who is dealing the death which all tyrannies shall die;
Right well he makes head, e'en his worst friends must own,
And the best we can do is to “let well alone.”
Cross the Channel, I trust, will be wafted this hint
"hough the “Boot’ may pinch BoMBA, Nap's foot is not in't).
“I own I’ve scant love for those tatterdemalians,
Who send us our organ-fiends, Northern Italians;
But I must say it caused me a moment's vexation
To see through the trick of their late annexation.
Yet now the deed’s done, the best course to pursue
Is to register simply that it was a doo.
“Of the Syrianslaughters I have heard with great grief,
And, with just indignation, have sent quick relief;
With Austria, and Prussia, and Russia, and France
I have joined, to the SULTAN some troops to advance,
Whereby of the Christians the terrors to end,
And the dastardly Druses to Hades to send.
“Another small matter I have for regret,
Viz.:-My China account is not quite settled yet.
That the Chinese care little for music 'tis clear,
To my overtures lately they turned a deaf ear;
As in harmony, therefore, to live they refuse,
I must see whether discord will long suit their views.
With the French, a few instruments lately I’ve sent,
Which will make these rash Pigtails their deafness repent—
Qne or two ..º. from ARMSTRONG's dark caves,
Will rather astonish the minds of the “Braves;"
And Ifancy ere long, as our force there increases,
If she don't sue for peace you'll find China in pieces.
“Coming now to home subjects, I say to your faces,
Your conduct in Parliament quite a disgrace is:
In a jiffy I’ll count º the work that you’ve got done,
Rather longer 'twould take me to tell what you’ve not done.
You have made a French Treaty; you’ve voted Supplies;
At legal abuses you’ve had some small shies:
And to show you’re at #. now with all foreign nations,
You’ve passed a small Bill for some fortifications.
You've united my forces in India at length,
And I trust that the act will show ‘Union is Strength:”
Irish landlord and tenant F. ’ve placed on fair footing,
So I hope we shall hear of no more landlord shooting;
You have smashed party. Emblems: and after long º -
You have saved little children when bleaching from dy(e)ing;
Relief you have granted to Catholic charity,
Which, tho' Spoon ER, thinks otherwise, is not a rarity;
You've amended the law touching banks for small Savings,
Still for further amendment Iown I’ve great cravings);
aval Discipline too you have taken in hand,
And made it more easy to get my ships manned:
The Cat's the chief hindrance, half an eye can see that;
But more ‘care’ for my men must ere long “kill the Cat.”
“Thus in few words I’ve summed up the year's legislation,
And shown what odd jobs you have done for the nation;
But your strenuous idleness, as I’ve declared,
Has but kept you at work that you well might have spared.
Half the Session, and more than two weeks of the Grouse,
You have wasted in talk of Reforming the House;
While the wisest of measures, there can't be a doubt of it,
Were to turn all the talkative Members clean out of it!
For which sensible hint thank my friend with the hunch,
I need surely not name him—you know I mean Punch /
“Now for pleasanter themes, I am happy to say
That my boy is in Canada making a º - -
And there taking such steps (you have heard of his dancing)
As prove in the right path that he is advancing;
Indeed, such is his conduct, it must be allowed of him,
That his Mother has every right to feel proud of him.
“And not less deserving my high commendation
Is my Volunteer Army; whose organisation,
Both on leaders and men, hath great credit reflected,
For they’ve both done their duty, as England expected;
And have made so remote the bare chance of invasion
That no shade of alarm it need henceforth occasion.
“Now, good-bye; and go home to your children and wives,
And show them your taste for home comfort survives.
Give an eye to your farms, and your tenants, and neighbours,
And let care for the poor be not least ofdº labours.
You’ll not get much shooting;-the birds are all drowned;
But the means of time-slaughter may elsewhere be found:
There are schools to erect—there are horses to tame-

92 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(SEPTEMBER 8, 1860.
There are commons, and criminals, too, to reclaim;
There are oak-trees to plant; there are poachers to catch;
There are poor lands to drain; there are poor roofs to thatch;
At law-framing moreover your hands you may try,
ſº: a wet day for that, as the work's rather dry).
'd say more, but I see you are wanting your lunch,
So to sum up—Mind weekly you study your Punch /
If you want good advice, that’s the shop to afford it ye:
So my Lords, Wos Walete / I need not add, Plaudite!”
At the conclusion of The Speech, PROTECTOR PUNCH received the
thanks and gratulations of Both Houses on being happily released from
the labours of his Essence. After this affecting ceremony, the PRO-
TECTOR flung his big wig at the head of the LoRD CHANCELLOR, and
went to watch the Lower boys pack up for the holidays; where he
was mightily amused at seeing little JoHNNY RussBLL make a terribly
wry face, because PAM wouldn’t let him take his old Reform Bill hobby-
horse to play with. When the last cab had departed, the PROTECTOR
locked, the doors, and put the keys into his pocket; thereby showing
he had read History, and was not too proud to imitate his namesake.
Then, after bonneting a small boy who happened to be staring at him,
he hailed a special Hansom, and flew away upon the wings of love—a
poetical expression for the fastest express train—to join the Grouse
and Judy.
FROM OUR COCKNEY CORRESPONDENT.
To Mr. Punch,
“Drumnadrochit Inn,
“SIR, “Inverness-shire, Scotland.
“I.ADDRESSED you last from the interesting, though misun-
derstood regions of Yorkshire. I now write to you from the Highlands.
The inn whence these lines are dated faces a scene which happily is not
too often to be observed in this planet. I say º Sir, because we
are all perfectly well aware that this world is a Waſe of Tears, in which
it is our duty to mortify ourselves, and make everybody else as uncom-
fortable as possible. If there were many places like Drumnadrochit,
persons would be in fearful danger of forgetting that they ought to be
miserable. . The most glorious scenery, Mr. Punch, here surrounds a
most delightful inn, and an inn, Sir, where not only are you made
thoroughly comfortable, but where (unlike the vast majority of Scottish
.#. your kindhearted Landlady does not endeavour to
revenge Flodden upon us, English by charges as tremendous as those
we made, upon that glorious day, on the army of KING JAMES THE
FourTH. Your health, Sir, in a dram.
. “From York, Sir, to Drumnadrochit, is a considerable distance, and
inasmuch as I have been receiving for the last week every kind of
Scotch hospitality, and also every kind of Scotch information, it is
possible that the notes I have been able to make may not convey very
precise notions to your mind, I own to being in a Paradisaical
muddle. Still, I have done my best, and have struggled up against the
influence both of the Tumbler and the Eke, to write down facts for
you, after retiring, (with slight assistance from my hosts) to my
sleeping chamber. I can but transcribe those notes for you, being far
too much occupied, with fishing, theological discussion, and other
diversions, to attempt anything like style. Your health, Sir, in a dram.
“I say then, Sir, that the harvest is in better condition than the
English one, and the strawberries I got at Aberdeen, which is built of
granite and celebrated for strawberries (also Dugald Dalgettie was
educated at the Marischal College) were very fine indeed. As to the
vexed question between the Highlanders and their landlords, and the
clearings away of the population, there seems to be a good deal to say
on both sides, only the fact is certain that the Highland population is
increasing, and not diminishing, and that if you eat the salmon at once
while it is firm and curdy it is perfectly, delicious. Duncan was not
murdered by Macbeth in Cawdor Castle, and the latter reigned
seventeen years, and was killed at Lumphanan, in Aberdeenshire, and
DUNCAN was killed at Elgin, where there is a tall column, like the
DUKE of York’s, to the late Durº or GoRDON, the DUKE of RICH-
MOND's predecessor, which I saw from the railway. MACBETH very
likely had a castle at Inverness, at all events there is a high place
where anybody might have had a castle, but this is not the place where
Inverness Castle stands, quite different. In the latter is a very
picture of MR. Charles GRANT, father of Lord GLENELG, but they
do not hear very well in the Assize Court. Inverness bridge fell down,
but there is another now, a suspension one, and you do not pay any-
thing to go over it. Your health, Sir, in a dram,
“Smeddum is a good Highland word, and means spirit and pluck,
and Gaelic is the language Highlanders talk, when they do not talk
English. There is great talk in Scotland now about the Volunteer
Review, which must have been a very splendid sight, because the
costumes of the North are picturesquer than ours, and the people
#. covered Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Cr This reminds me of
olyrood, where I saw the room in which MARY was sitting with
Rizzio and some others, when DARNLEY and the lot came in and
finished off the arrogant fiddler. But as to that being the Italian's
blood on the ground, I don't believe a bit of it. Why, the Queen had
the audience apartment altered, that she might not see the place where
the party fell, and is it likely she wouldn't have the floor planed, or a
new bit of planking put in P. However, I bought a glass copy of her
seal, the original CARDINAL WISEMAN has got, and I change
with his Eminence if he likes. There is not mueh to see in
Palace except the Chapel ruins, and they are not in it, but next door,
and very interesting. Your health, Sir, in a dram.
“As I did not stop at Perth, I cannot say anything about it, and the
same remark applies to several towns. The sandwiches at Keith are
not good, nor is the coffee, and they charge threepence a-piece for
penny cheese-cakes. All the railway officials are uncommonly civil,
and I consider that railways have been a great boon to Scotland. You
do not require passports to travel in this country, but your pass-book
will show pretty clearly when you have been here, and I cannot think
that the high charges at the hotels are wise. The Caledonian Canal
is a truly grand work, linking the lakes, which are extraordinarily deep,
at least Loch Ness is, being in some parts 150 fathoms, or 900 feet
which is nearly five times as much as the Monument is in height, and
the Caledonian Canal may be considered a monument to TELFoRP,
whose name was TELFER, but he altered it. The drive, along the side
of Loch Ness to this place is lovely, but there are awful precipices on
one side, and in many points not a bit of parapet, so that if the horses
are restive, your pleasure in contemplating the placid waters of the
lake is a little interfered with by your feeling at every kick that you
are extremely likely to descend into the said still waters by an exceed-
ingly short road. However, there would be no pleasure in travelling
without adventure. Your health, Sir, in a dram. -
“I will now enter into a somewhat elaborate, but I hope lucid state-
ment of the theological differences in Scotland, and especially upon the
points of dispute between the Establishment and the Free Kirk. In
the first place you must understand that John Knox—

because his exploits are performed in the cause

SMITH O'BRIEN SUB ROSã.
. THAT honourable and useful gentleman, MR. SMITH O'BRIEN, has
just published a letter, inspired with the most grateful loyalty and the
sincerest º; having for its object the suggestion of a device
whereby the insidious intention of the British Government to prevent
the Irish population from arming themselves and getting drilled under
the name of Volunteers may be frustrated, and the law, which forbids
the unauthorised training of soldiers evaded. The following is the
ingenious and ingenuous proposition of estimable O'BRIEN:—
“The existing law does not prevent individuals, except in proclaimed districts,
from learning the use of arms. The law prohibits regimental training, but it does
not impose a penalty on the practice by individuals of the art of rifle-shooting, and
I conceive that any number of persons may meet to try their skill as marksmen.
Let the leading gentlemen of Ireland, without distinction of party, offer prizes for
marksmanship in rifle-shooting; and in case of need the organisation of such marks-
men into mili companies would be effected without difficulty in a few weeks,
perhaps in a few days."
In the meanwhile there stands on the Statute Book a certain Act, to
wit lst George IV. c. 1, ; which, no doubt, MR. O'BRIEN has read,
and is quite satisfied that his brilliant scheme, for making riflemen of
his trustworthy, compatriots in spite of the ruling powers, is not
threatened with the least discouragement by the º: portion of
that enactment:—
“All meetings and assemblies of persons for the purpoſe of training and drilling
themselves, or of being trained or drilled in the use of arms, or for the pu e of prac-
mili exercise, movements, or evolutions without lawful authority, shall
tising
be and are hereby prohibited as dangerous to the peace and security of His
Majesty's liege subjects and his Government."
Imprisonment for two years, or transportation for seven, are the
malties provided for disobedience to the foregoing, prohibition,
eqple who assemble and meet together for the purpose of drilling and
training themselves in the use of arms are liable to those punishments,
which need not, however, MR. Q'BRIEN thinks, deter any number of
persons from meeting to try their skill as marksmen. If, in accordance
with MR. Q'BRIEN's advice, there should take place in Ireland any
assembly of would-be organised combatants, with the view of learning
to shoot, under the idea that training or drilling themselves in the use
of arms is one thing, and co-operation in rifle-practice another thing,
let us hope that MR. O'BRIEN will venture to test the correctness of
his opinion to that effect by constituting himself one of the º: Let
the experiment be tried on SMITH O'BRIEN. If it succeeds he will
rejoice—if it fails he will be transported. . One expatriation has taught
him not again to risk the consequences of being taken in arms against
the Crown among the cabbages. Another may teach him that a
pardoned traitor made a great mistake when he attempted to levy
rebellion under the rose.
THE THEATRICAL CENSUS OF EUROPE.
According to a statistical work recently published on the Continent,
it appears that at this moment there are in Europe no less than 18,640
actors, 21,609 actresses, 1,773 managers, and 21 manageresses. f; 1S
not stated whether England is, included in the above enumeration.
We should doubt it, for it is well known that we have so many actors
in England that MR. BABBAGE's calculating machine would certainly
be brought to a stand-still, as effectually as though an Italian organ;
boy was grinding away outside, if called upon to give an account of
them all. In fact, so numerous are they, that if we were asked to give
the name of a single actor at the present day, we should feel extremely
uzzled. The best plan would be, to ask the very first actor you met.
e he high, or be he low; be he CHARLEs KEAN, or be he Hicks—he
would be sure to tell
the English stage, and that one was himself.

GARIBALDI’S ASSES.
THE sympathy with GARIBALDI, which Punch has always entertained
was so enthusiastic, that it seemed capable of no increment. The little
but interesting circumstance, mentioned in the following extract from
the letter of the Times, correspondent on a voyage with the Italian
Liberator, has raised the enthusiasm of Mr. Punch on behalf of that
glorious fellow, to a heat which would be many degrees above boiling,
if Punch's enthusiasm could boil, which it cannot, because boiling
necessarily involves evaporation, and his sentiments with regard to
GARIBALDI are fixed and not to be volatilised. The Dictator of Sicily
is not only a hero, but a wag. At the illustrious General's own place
in the islet of Caprera, where he had landed with a select party, the
scenery and the crops having undergone inspection:—
“Presently some of the domestic friends of the solitary landlord came up-sheep,
goats, and pigs, which he knew and º one by one, four donkeys, one of
whom he hailed by the august name of Pio Nono, and the others by other names
equally illustrious in contemporary history which I shall not write down."
“Do,” the KING of NAPLEs will doubtless say, when he reads the
words last foregoing. “Write me down one of the asses.” “And me
another,” the EMPEROR or AustEIA will as probably, exclaim;
addressing the other young tyrant, let us hope, at Vienna. “Oh, that
he” (the Times correspondent) “were here to write me down an ass;”
cries the young Neapolitan Doyberry, and the wish is echoed by the
juvenile Werges of Austria. - -
. GARIBALDI, by thus playfully assigning the names of his enemies to
jackasses, indicates that he them no malice, and that, in his
struggle to emancipate men from Asinine despotisins, “nought is done
in hate but all in honour.” And if those poor despotic creatures would
but accept their proper situation, and submit to their natural master,
they would no doubt receive at his hands the same kind, and gentle
treatment as that which, he is described as having extended to their
representatives on the above-mentioned occasion:-
“The harmless creatures, came forward to be petted by their kind master, and
rubbed their long-eared heads against his legs."
If Pio NoNo would only imitate this sensible as well as amiable
conduct on the part of his quadruped namesake, instead of kicking
against the prickles, he would show considerably more wisdom than he
does in proposing his toes to the lips of the faithful. The other human
counterparts of GARIBALDI's asses might also just as well submit as it
were to be patted by the benevolent conqueror, and rub their long-eared
heads against his legs. - - - - -
But we have been confining our consideration all this time to three
asses, and GARIBALDI has four. Who is the fourth Ass?. What other
name illustrious in contemporary history is it likely that a good and
great man would confer on a jackass?. Louis NapoleoN, is not an
ass—although he is said to believe in Spirit-rapping. Yet GARIBALD:

CHAPTER XXVIII.-THE REIGN OF RICHARD THE SECOND.
ICHARD came to the
throne when not quite
twelve years old, but
little as he was, there
is reason to believe he
was a great fop even
then. A curious illu-
mination in the Argen-
tine Collection repre-
sents him in the act of
“overing” a playmate,
to whom the boyish

* height of fashion.
he boy being pro-
verbially the father of
the man, we find that
as the King grew up,
his love of inj grew
- with him. One of his
coats wasyalued at thirty thousand marks, a fact which marks, we think,
the Royal disposition. This high value arose chiefly from the quan:
tity of needlework expended, on the garment, and the precious lot of
precious stones with which it was embroidered. Another of his robes,
and very probably a Sunday one, is depicted in the portrait of him
which, is still on view, being preserved in Westminster Abbey, in
the Chamber called “Jerusalem.” . This robe is adorned with an
elegant embroidery of capital R's and roses: it being quite the fashion
with the dandies of this period to have either their initials or a motto
on their dresses, perhaps, as we have, hinted, to mark them for the
wash. Were the custom now revived, we can conceive what stupid
mottoes would be sported by the gentish, who always mock and maul
the fashions of their betters:—
“if mish, mp. 65al to pleast:
©, ain't # just tºt Christ!”
would doubtless be a popular device for a new shirt-front: while a
couple of lines stating that—
“àts, ſºloshts!) is a 33rick:
Ibis cost but trn amb a kirk 1"
might be fittingly embroidered on the back of a gent's paletot dis-
played upon the dum-
my of an advertising
slopshop.
nder a foppish
sovereign, foppery, of
course, became 'the
order of the day, and
the lowest orders
even became visibly
infected by it. One
writer hints, that ser-
vants dressed as finely
as their masters; but
accustomed as we are
to be dazzled by the
randeur of our
HAWLESEs and our
JEAMESEs, there is
nothing very novel
or surprising in this
fact. KNIGHTonsays,

what writers of the time confessed they shrank from trying? How:
ever, all the penmen of the period were not Knightons. Some of
them were bright'uns, and saw clearer than the Knightons, and
were able to distinguish persons of distinction. Not being a Jesuit,
KNIGHTON pºli had not the word distinguo in his iii.
But other writers had, we find; and scarcely need we say, that one
of these was CHAUCER, who wrote his Canterbury Tales about the
close of this short reign, and dropped therein some interesting hints
about the clothes of it. On one point his opinion coincides with
that of KNIGHToN, in so far that he makes his º chaff the
clergy for riding on high horses glittering with gold, and being armed
with swords and bucklers like to men of war, so that it was not easy
to distinguish them from knights. To the latter charge the parsons
might have not inaptly answered, that as part of the Church Militant
they had a right to go well armed: and as for the offence of riding the
high horse, that has been in all ages a clerical amusement, and in some
parts of the country is said to be still extant.
In further illustration of the fashions of the clergy, CHAUCER has
introduced a monk among his Canterbury Pilgrims, dressed plainly in
defiance of the clerical regulations, inasmuch as he was anything but
plainly dressed. The rich sleeves of his tunic were "edged with fur
de gris, yº finest in yº land:” he wore bells upon his bridle, and a pair
of “supple” boots; and under his chin his hood was fastened with a
golden pin, which, as a climax to his fopperies, was actually fashioned
“like a true lovere hys knotte l’” Nor were the clerks, it seems, a
whit less foppish than the parsons; for in the description which is
given of one in the same poem, it is said (in other metre) that—
“Hºgs host ºutre rth, bus kirtle blºſur,
#gs surpliſt *: as smoº-Droppe mtm :

&Hitſ; 3Bault's minuouts, a quaint Urugst:
in 560th bus tuggis gº morſt but tellt
Cºlijat paints be took to comt out sºutlit.”
Exceptions there were, doubtless, to the general clerical rule; for we
find preachers complaining of the vanities and ". of dress in which
the laity indulged: and this they could not well have done if they had
been themselves attired in gorgeous array. CHAUCER's parson has
two charges to bring º: the people: the one accusing them of
superfluity, and the other of unseemly scantiness of dress: for it
appears that both these fashions were in vogue at the same period.

Duke of Lancaster, came back from the Continent, he made his entry
into London in a “courte jacques” of cloth of gold, cut “à la fachon
d’Almayne.” As another proof, moreover, of its German derivation,
the “courte” or shortened coat is said to have been called “hanselein,”
from the German “HANs,” or “Jack,” whence the garment became
known in England as a “jack-et.” The word “slop,” as applied to an
article of dress, occurs for the first time in the passage we have quoted,
and is probably derivable from the German schleppe, which signifies a
something “trailing.” Whether our cheap and n—not nice tailors, who
are commonly called “slop-sellers,” have any claim to be considered
of German derivation, is a question which debating clubs may argue if
they like, but which we have neither space nor inclination to discuss.
But we may hint, that there is certainly some ground for the hypothesis:
for the word “British” we know is synonymous with “brickish,” and
as slopsellers are never known to act like bricks, they clearly cannot
claim that their origin is British.
Mention has been made in the last preceding extract of the fashion
now of wearing “hose departed of two colours,” and we find that
parti-coloured robes were made to match—or rather, not to match
would be speaking more correctly. M. quaint and queer were these
arti-coloured dresses, which must have looked as though their wearers
ad left half of themselves at home, and had somehow got a moiety of
some one else stuck on to them. The hose too being quite dissimilar,
could hardly with º have been called a pair; and must have made
men fancy that their righ

one. Our circus “fools” have frequently adopted this º: fashion,
without being aware perhaps that it had been devised by the wisdom
of their ancestors. Could the latter now be summoned by the aid of
...; we can fancy, with what horror they would see upon
what shoulders their mantles had descended. We cannot think though,
that our clowns are to be viewed in their stage-dress as greater fools than
were their forefathers, for the latter set the fashion which is so ridiculous.
The parti-colours sometimes had political significance, and like those
worn at elections were really party colours. In an old illumination
representing John of GAUNT, who was the uncle of Richard THE
SECOND, gravely sitting to decide the claims upon his nephew's coro-
nation, the gaunt one wears a funnily grotesque appearance, by wearing
along robe divided down the middle, the one half being blue and the
other being white, which we all know were the colours of the House
of Lancaster. We think that great good might result were our M.P.s
to revive this curious old fashion, and to show by their costume what
. they belonged to. Were this hint to be acted on, not merely
would the House present a much gayer appearance, by the magpie
black and white in it being turned to peacock hues; but there would
be far less chance that Members would, enter the wrong lobby, as in
the now expiring Session, has unluckily occurred. Unstable minds,
moreover, might indicate their waverings, by wearing rainbow pegtops
and coats of . colours; which with a variegated vest, and a tie of
neutral tint, would show they were in-vest-ed with the freedom of a
t leg had by some mishap become a wrong weathercock, and could veer round independently of any party tie.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TERRORS OF TABLE-TURNING,
REALLY, if this Spirit-moving mania be carried on much further, it
will be necessary for persons who are about to marry to take steps to
secure themselves from buying haunted furniture, and from possessing
chairs and tables which are themselves “possessed.” When we hear
of wardrobes “manifesting signs of the most lively emotion” on being
approached by the mistress of the house; of sofas “undergoing throes”
and swaying to and fro with “tumultuous energy” when invited by a
Medium to join in a séance; of heavy easy chairs standing up on their
hind legs, and wheeling about and turning about like so many JIM
CRows, when informed through the same means, that there were
“sperrits” present; of tables rising unsupported some three feet in the
air, and then descending to the ground with such a “dreamy softness”
that it rendered their alighting “almost imperceptible;” of tables
“rearing themselves up at an angle of 45°,” without letting the vases
and things º: upon them topple over; of tables clambering up
ottomans and jumping into beds, and performing such “strange antics”
with such “yiolent vivacity” as clearly showed they were “infected
with a wild rollicking glee,” and “inspired with the most riotous
animal spirits; ” when we hear, we say, of furniture behaving itself in
this way, we cannot but consider that people should be careful how
they run the risk of contact with it, and that great pains should be
taken to avoid the chance of accidents resulting from its getting into
an excited state. After what has actually been seen by living witnesses
(at least if we believe their tongues, and they themselves believe their
eyes, without using their other senses, common sense included, to test
i. “truths” to which they testify), we should hardly think it safe to
let a table cross our threshold without having some knowledge of its
character and habits, and feeling guaranteeſ in some way that when
a spirit moved it we need fear no ill effects. Having a wife and a large
family of ten or twelve small children, from whom we daily are obliged
by business to absent ourselves, it would never do to leave them at the
mercy of strange furniture; which for aught we, know might prove
addicted to an intercourse with spirits, and be liable to get elevated,
and suspended in the air, and alarm the household by the madness of
its freaks.
Obviously, therefore, some measures must be taken whereby the
peace of mind of parents may be thoroughly secured, on the point as
to how far their tables may be trusted, and their chairs and sofas left
without being strictly watched. Upholsterers must be eyed as jealously
as horse-dealers, and whatever article of furniture they sell will have to
be submitted to most scrutinising tests. When they turn out a new
table, they will have to guarantee it as being free from rapping, tipping, or
any other vicious tricks; and no father of a family, will think it safe to
buy an old one without asking the shopkeeper what character he had
with it, and whether it had ever shown a restive disposition, or had
betrayed a tendency to back-jump, rear, or kick. Prudent persons will
..". that their easy chairs and sofas should be similarly certified;
and unless they can be warranted as sound and safe from spirits, of
course they will not be allowed to come into a drawing-room, where
ladies, not strong-minded, might be frightened into fits.
Nor, while the Spirit mania lasts, will such precautions be less
needful with regard to bed-room furniture, which must equally awaken
one's suspicion and alarm. After what has been detailed of tables
jumping upon beds, and chests of drawers being seen to undulate and
vibrate with emotion, and curtain-rods, for aught we know, to quiver
with excitement and rotate with remorse, surely nobody would dream
of purchasing a wardrobe without a proper warranty that it was all
serene; or of suffering one's upholder to send one home a dressing-
table, which, being addicted to show spirits in the looking-glass, might
shake one so while shaving as to make one cut one's throat. In fact,
as spirits don’t seem proud, but condescend to take possession of things
most insignificant, the smallest household articles will be objects of
suspicion, the while one fears there may be “sperrits present” in one's
house. For ourselves, we frankly own, that as we have by nature a
somewhat nervous temperament, we would never even purchase a
second-hand perambulator without having a full knowledge of its
parentage ºpedigree; nor could we with any comfort use so small a
; : furniture, even as a footstool, if we fancied that a spirit-hand
ad (in the dark) been seen on it.
CAMPS AND DAMPS.
THERE are&.” complaints of the state of the cavalry horses in
the Curragh Camp. It seems as if some biped wanted a good curragh
combing, as well as these poor starved out quadrupeds. A “French
Soldier” writes to the Times, declaring that the people most to blame
are the soldiers themselves, who have not the nous to drain their camp,
and pave sloped standing-places for their horses. Perhaps there may
be some truth in this; but are we sure that the soldiers have been
permitted—much more taught—to set about such works? Let us take
care, before we blame them, to be sure that we put the saddle on the
right horse—even though the saddle be a Cavalry one, and the horse a
Dragoon.
A PROFITABLE LINE OF BUSINESS.
WE read that a certain Railway pays its Lawyers £30,000 a year.
This is very º for the Lawyers doubtlessly, and must pay
them remarkably well to keep up a running account of such an
agreeable magnitude; but how about the poor Shareholders? We do
not allude to the preference, or the preference preference Shareholders
with their 6, 7, and 8 per cent. guaranteed interest, but to those who
originally invested in the speculation? It strikes us (we are talking
of Bradshaw generally, and not picking out any separate line) that
many of the Shareholders have to starve in order that one or two
favoured Lawyers may be fed. Of all Railway branches, and but few of
them pay, the Legal Branch is the most expensive, and yet Railways are
always running to law, and thousands have to be paid as the penalty of
the numerous Railway collisions that are continually taking place in
consequence in the Courts of Law.
To no professional class, not even excepting the Engineers, has the
establishment of Railways been so profitable as to the Lawyers. The
Engineer finishes his line, and there to a great extent his interest ends;
but you have never finished with your Lawyer. Once allow him to put
his iron fingers on your line, and with the well-known tenacity that iron
has for iron, he will not let go his clutch in a hurry. A mother-in-law
in a household is not more difficult to be got rid of than a Lawyer who
once gets his red-bag inside a Railway carriage. He is there, you ma
be sure, for life, and he takes the line in any direction he pleases, and,
not only rides free of expenses but pockets every half-year the hand-
somest dividend that the Company pays. A cabinan is not paid more
than sixpence a mile, but a Railway Lawyer's fare, we should say, was
cheap at the rate of a hundred a mile. The sooner the Shareholders
put down such legal conveyances, or else keep a tight cheque-string
on them, the better they will find it for their pockets. Our words for
it, these furious-driving legal Phaetons, if not pulled up in time, will
infallibly run away with all your money.
Of all the paces, there's none like the Lawyer's pace for killing. In
their time Lawyers have killed more than Railways. When the two
combine, poor men must lose their own. In the meantime, the Railway
axiom can safely be laid down, that Railways were established in this
country for the special emolument of Lawyers and Directors. They
take the first spoil; if anything is left (iſ), it is divided amongst the
Shareholders.
CHILDREN, GOODS AND CHATTELS.
At the Westminster Police Court we are informed by the Morning
Post that—
“ALLEN FAIRRIE Johnstone and SARAH Elliott were further examined charged
with stealing a valuable child."
A dear child we often hear of; but a valuable child is something
apparently new. The fact is, however, that JANE SMITH, the valuable
little article which MR. Johnston E and Miss ELLIOTT were accused ot
purloining, draws large audiences by singing at various concert-rooms.
She being only five years old, her value consists in the attraction which
she exerts on the more intelligent portion of the British public in the
character of musical prodigy or phenomenon and infant wonder. For
stealing a child of this value how would the indictment run ? The
accused might perhaps be charged with having stolen, taken, and
carried away one child, value £1000, for instance. A singing baby is
at least as valuable as a singing mouse; but if it were as dear as it is
valuable, its friends would take care of it, and the way to do that is
not to let it go about singing at concerts at a time when it...ought to
be playing at home, or lying fast asleep in bed. Valuable children who
are allowed to ruin their health by excitement and want of natural
rest are very apt to be lost, if they are not stolen.
Is the punishment for stealing a child, whether of little or great
value, as severe as that inflicted for stealing a sheep? The answer is
not easy; for although numerous cases of kidnapping have occurred
lately, the offenders, and especially the .. who stole the
little Jew, appear all of them to have escaped justice.
The Bonapartist Claque at Naples
It seems that one can sing, as well dance, on a volcano. For in-
stance, the Imperial claqueurs, in the pay of the Bonapartes, are trying
to get at Naples a new song, entitled, “ Murat pour la Patrie.” They
sing it with a great deal of warmth, but can get very few of the natives
to join in the chorus. Apparently the Neapolitans do not think MURAT
worth a song.

paragraph concerning you, extracted from the “Notices to Corre-
spondents’ in the Spiritual Magazine :-
“INQUIRER.—‘A Word with Punch on the merits of his three Puppets, Sleekhead,
Wronghead, and Thickhead,' is, we believe, out of print. The exposures in it were
certainly very damaging, but they answered the purpose. Punch never attacked
MB. BUNN afterwards; perhaps the quiet intimation on the corner of the title-page,
“To be continued if necessary, made Punch discreet rather than valiant. You are
right in supposing that “Thickhead' is the present Editor of Punch.”
“Besides deterring youfrom saying anything more against Spiritualism,
the foregoing reference to yourself ought to convince you of its truth.
Surely, you must see that the passage above quoted is a communication
from the spirit of the late BARNARD GREGORY, sometime Editor of the
Satirist. Expect more, and worse, from the same quarter, if you keep
on making jests of Mediums and talking tables. Your ridicule of
quackery will be met with personal abuse, the author of which you may
call a † blackguard, but you will disdain to answer him, and he will
go about boasting that he has shut you up.
“The ribaldry with which you assail Spiritualism, is nothing new,
It is as old as Spiritualism itself. The Spiritualist and the Scoffer have
co-existed from the beginning. ... Let me call your attention to evidence
of this fact, contained in some lines, of doggerel (much like the verses
of your own contributors), with which an insidious naturalism, from
time immemorial, has sought to poison and prejudice the mind of
infancy:—
“High diddle diddle,
The Cat and the Fiddle,
The Cow jumped over the Moon;
The Little Dog laughed to see such sport:
And the Dish ran away with the Spoon.”
“Let us analyse these despicable nursery rhymes, in order to expose
their covert meaning. “High diddle diddle.” This first line is com-
monly, but erroneously, supposed. to be nonsense. It, embodies a
general denunciation of Spiritualism as delusion. “High” means
supreme; * diddle', is a familiar synonym of imposture or humbug.
The repetition of the word ‘diddle' is intended to intensify the force
of it, so that ‘diddle diddle” is as much as to say ‘humbug double-
distilled,' or ‘transcendent humbug. The whole line amounts to a
sweeping assertion that Spiritualism is regular out-and-out humbug.
“I shall make this statement clear as we proceed. ‘The Qat and
the Fiddle.” This is ribaldry. It is just the same sort of ribaldry as
that with, which you attack the high and holy truths of Spiritualism.
The words are intended to insinuate deception in, the case of a
spiritual performance on a violin. The fiddle was played by spirit-
agency; but the poetaster attempts to account for a phenomenon
which he cannot deny by suggesting that the sounds were produced by
hº º twitched the strings of the instrument with her claws under
e table.
“‘The Cow .." over the Moon.’....More ribaldry. As much as
to say, the alleged fact of spirit-fiddling is as improbable as the
legendary relation that a certain ruminant quadruped overleapt the
satellite of this planet. -
“‘The little Dog laughed to see such sport.’... Ribaldry again. Of
course a dog could not laugh; though the so-called laughing hyaena is
a brute of the dog kind, and such, puppies as §§. Toby may laugh at
humble women for inquiring, in the unaffected language of the lower
classes, whether there is any sperrits present? By the sport mentioned
in this line are intended Spiritual manifestations; and the pretended
laughter of the little dog is an innuendo, signifying that they were so
º absurd as even to excite the derisive merriment of an
animal of the canine species. - -
“We now come to the last of the five lines which compose this piece
of stupid scurrility. “And the Dish ran away with the Spoon'. This
is the simple statement of an unquestionable Spiritual fact, which the
preceding buffoonery is calculated to discredit,
“You will live to believe in Spiritualism, if you live till you are a
day older—as DR. L.ARDNER lived to see the Atlantic crossed by
steamers. Spirits will, of course, immediately disclose the authors of
the Road and Stepney murders, You have put them on their mettle
by defying them to reveal anything whatever, and, though in eternity,
they will Iose no time in rapping out the names of the murderers by
the alphabet. -
“Is there no sperrits—to borrow the homely language of commu-
No. 1001.

“P.S. ‘The Dish ran away with the Spoon.” I know you will say
that the subject of this Spiritual asportation was the Editor of Giles
Scroggins's Journal.”
PROPRIETIES OF PENNY-A-LIN in G.
N the report of a recent exe-
cution published by a con-
temporary, there occurs, im-
mediately after the description
of an attempt on the part of
the prisoner to commit suicide,
the following remark:—
“The 1. appears to have
conducted himself exceedingly well
since he has been in Horsemonger
Lane Gaol.”
The endeavour to destroy
himself seems not to have
appeared to the reporter an
exception to the prisoner's
good behaviour. In continua-
tion we are told that—
“He attended chapel every day,
and seemed to be very much pleased
with the religious discourses of the
REv. M.R. JEssopp, and paid great
attention to them."
In a previous part of the
narrative we find that MR.
Jessopp “exhorted him to tell the truth, and not go out of the world with
alie in his mouth.” He, however, did go out of the world asserting
his innocence. If it was really the fact that he paid any attention
whatever to the religious discourses of the clergyman, that fact would
suggest a shocking doubt of his guilt. But, to our relief, we are
informed, not only that he paid great attention to those discourses, but
was also “very much pleased with them.” A man about to be hanged
might be terrified or comforted by ghostly exhortations, but could
hardly be likely to be “pleased” with a religious discourse; like a
serious gentleman at large sitting under MR. SPURGEON. W. may
safely conclude that the attention paid by the convict to the discourses
of his spiritual adviser was about equal to the pleasure which he
derived from them.
- What a wonder that, in penning the passage next subjoined, the
narrator did not think of instituting a comparison which it suggests to
anybody who is in the least acquainted with LEMPRIERE's Dictionary:—
“He conversed freely with the warders who had the charge of him, and upon
one occasion, in reference to the punishment of death, he said he objected to it
“upon principle," and said he did not think the law was justified in taking life for
any crime.”
This philosophical behaviour is really quite analogous to the conduct
of Socrates in his last moments.
We seem to have read the ensuing description, or something very
like it, more than once before; . very often. Like nearly every
criminal, an account of whose execution for murder we have ever
perused, the condemned man, having taken leave of his friends,-
“Went to bed at the usual hour, and º soundly till yesterday morning at
seven o'clock, when he got up and dressed himself, and had his breakfast, which
consisted of cocoa and bread and butter. He ate the whole of the allowance given
to him apparently with great relish, and asked for an additional quantity, which
was supplied him, and he finished the whole of that also.”
If the reports of executions in general can be believed, the last
breakfast of a murderer is almost invariably a good one, and he seldom
fails to ask for more; which is always “supplied him,” in most cases
“promptly” or “immediately.” The items of the meal also, as in the
present instance, are constantly specified. Somebody, must be inte-
rested in this sort of detail, instead of being disgusted with it. We
wonder if the chronicler of such particulars would be sensible of
recording anything incongruous with the solemnity of the occasion
in stating, if an eccentric malefactor gave him occasion for doing so,
that the prisoner “expressed a wish for shrimps, which was instantly
gratified,” or “requested a bloater, which was at once supplied him.”
In the extract which shall conclude this anthology, however, there
is one word, which, if not absolutely novel in the composition of such
a narrative as that in which it occurs, may nevertheless suggest a new
idea to thinking minds:–
“The chaplain then commouced reading the imposing service for the dead, and
the mournful cavalcade proceeded across the yard to the place of execution, which
is at some considerable distance."
Equestrian tragedies have been performed in a theatre; but even on
the stage it is at least unusual for a prisoner to be led to execution in
a cavalcade.
SONG OF THE IMPERIAL PREFECT.
CoMe on my friends, look here, this pair of boots you see,
Attend, approach, assist, in cleaning them with me.
Whom do F. invite from dirt to free them for P
Aha! and can you doubt? It is our Emperor.
These boots which I embrace, as if they were my sons,
What do they call themselves? You know. Napoleons.
'Tis well, therefore, to clean and make them gaily shine,
Because the name they bear effuses light divine.
Yes, glory from that name as from bright Phoebus shoots,
Well, then, will you refuse to wipe its owner's boots?
No ; raising cries of joy, in eager haste you’ll press
To cleanse their very soles of all unpleasantness.
To him who wears them think how vast a debt you owe,
And all your bosoms then with gratitude will glow.
What! dares some voice exclaim, that France is no more free ?
The Empire is for her the Tree of Liberty!
For chains with garlands she is to that poplar bound,
A Maypole decked with flowers, which she can dance around.
So let us dance; but first remove the spots impure
Of these Napoleon boots the radiance which obscure.
What, is not Paris grand, almost indeed rebuilt
Are not your eyes régaled with º and with gilt
Of splendours such as these be happy in the face;
If Britons are not slaves, their statues are all base.
But most of all reflect on what a height we stand,
In terror and alarm maintaining º land. -
Qur neighbours fear lest we should force them to enjoy
The happiness of Nice; the fortune of Savoy.
See England all in arms; John Bull up to his eyes
Taxed, lest we some fine day his seaboard should surprise ;
His wealth, his hearth, and home, should plunder an profane
Of glory thus possessed, of what can we complain?
Come help me then these boots—to polish shall I say?
No; simply they require defilement wiped away.
Of patent-leather formed, their stains removed, they glow:
Now has arrived the hour devoted zeal to show.
Lend me—your hands? Ah no! These boots demand of us
A nobler sacrifice—idea more generous!
With blacking's acrid taste no palate will be wrung,
Let me request you all to aid me with the tongue.
Hereditary Bondsmen who are Always Striking the First

MR. HERMAN LANG (the name reads like the German for LoNG:
#º writes to the Times to state that a Volunteer Band, if good
for anything, cannot be kept up for less than £1,000 a year. (Bosh!)
We venture to say that the Pope's Brass Band, proficient as they are in
blowing their own trumpets as well as those of their harmonious
master, manage to keep themselves up for a much less sum than the
above. We doubt if the poor fellows draw much beyond their own
breath. The reward is certainly not great, tending to empty the
chest rather than fill it, but then the Pope, who has not kept, an old
rag-shop so many years for nothing, says it is the BEST Price that can
be Given for OiD BRAss.
Inhuman Attempt at the Floral Hall.
A FRENchMAN's love of the ridiculous exceeds even his love of the
truth. An apology was made the other evening for MLLE. PAREPA's
absence;—“Ah / il parait donc que MLLE. PAREPA ne parait pas.”
The Frenchman, who was the unnatural parent of the above absurdity,
was so proud of his misshapen distorted offspring, that he went about
introducing it to every one he met. How true it is, that parents love
their deformed children the best!
Poor BEASTs —It is decided that the Natural History of the British
Museum is not to go out of town this year.

STOP H E R
WE read a short time ago, in a contemporary the following strange want:—
-- WANTED, A SINGING CHAMBERMAID."
Now of all the nuisances in one's establishment, we should fancy a domestic who
could not hand one the Times newspaper without bursting, into a bravura song,
would be unexceptionably the most intolerable. º one who goes singing about
the house is abore. One instinctively longs to fling the brute over the bannisters;
but to have MoLLY constantly humming about one's ears—to warm your bed the
last thing at night with “We’re all Nodding,” and to bring you a cup of tea at
daybreak with “Behold how brightly breaks the Morning”—would have such an
*:::: upon our sensitive nerves, that, by St. Barnabas! we would as soonlive under
the same roof with a party of Puseyite priests, who were practising intoning all
day. We know we should very soon have to rush off to the nearest tailor's, who
had the private custom of the Lunacy Commissioners, and ask to be measured
without delay for, the straitest of strait waistcoats. ... We should only want a
facetious butler, a dancing porter, a crockery-smashing footman, and an Irish valet,
who never spoke to you without slapping his thighs and saying, “Lord bliss yer
'oner!” to complete our mundane happiness.
Perhaps, however, the “Singing Chambermaid” was wanted for the stage, and
certainly the stage is welcome to her so long as she doesn't come near us. When
all our wives and daughters sing at the present day, we certainly don’t want
chambermaids who can sing also, unless they were sure to charm our hearts and
ears like Miss PATTY OLIVER, or Miss Louise KEELEY, as often as they play the
part of one.

Pºſt this and that together. This is one of REUTER’s telegrams:–
“Perugia, Aug. 30.
"GENERAL LamoRIgikar, in an order of the day, has directed his troops to plunder any town
which, on the approach of the enemy, should rise in insurrection.”
That, which follows, is a paragraph from the Times:–
“A Loretto Wow.--GENERAL LaMoRucieae went on the 15th of last month to the famous
chapel of Our Lady of Loretto, and having, like other pilgrims, offered his devotions at the shrine,
solemnly engaged to present there ex voto the sword which he now brandishes on the Pope's
behalf, as soon as hes have delivered the Pontifical throne from all its enemies.”
LaMgRicº RE's order of the day, appropriately dated at Perugia, would, if it
stood alone, seem the proclamation of a miscreant. Taken, however, in connection
with, the gross and monstrous act of fetichism which he performed at Loretto, it
enables charity to hope that he may possibly be a madman.

A COLOSSAL BORE.
We wonder that Mons. FERDINAND DE LEsseps, with
his wonderful powers of ºf has not yet been able to
construct the canal across the Isthmus of Suez. With so
º a bore at the head of the works, the job should
ave been of the easiest nature, and ought to have been
constructed at the very smallest expense. How tired we
are of this everlasting surging, up-heaving, Isthmus! If
it only had been worked half as well in reality as it has
been on the press, French men-of-war might be sailing
across it at the present moment, on their way to take pos.
session of India. We can understand M. Dº issºrs
holding on to it with all his teeth, for it is a kind of ali-
mentary canal to him, so long as any subscriptions keep
pouring in; but we do wish that he would bore quietly like
a mole underground, and not disturb the peace of Europe
as though all the mountains in the ºwere in labour.
M. DE L. has been hammering away again at poor LoRD
PALMERSTON, who does not seem much hurt by the puny
blows he is perpetually receiving from this effervescing
little Frenchman. He has been sending his Lordship some
more “Observations” as striking as those he has dealt
him five thousand times at least before, but they do not
appear to have made any greater impression than their
feeble predecessors. Nettled at no notice being taken
either of them or himself, he sent to Cambridge House
under all possible forms and disguises, until his servant,
who seems to be as great a genius at boring as his master,
brought back the ºf answer:-"LoRD PALMER-
ston's final reply on the subject of M. De Lesser's canal
is simply–Cut it.” Nothing could be more expressive, or
so laconic, or kinder, and yet we are told that M. 'Dr.
Lesseps is in a greater rage than ever. There are some
men whom it is impossible to please.
Verbum Sap. Verbum Nap.

look the awful warning latent in the first line of the Com-

quest, and Europe, indignant, should take her in hand
who knows but that a future historian may have to record
that Omnis Gallia divisa est in, &c.

JOHN BULL’S BLUNDERS.
THE City of Montreal, in Lower, Canada, has been thrown into an
uproar by a proposition brought before its Municipal Council for
changing the name of one of its squares from Commissioner Square to
Victoria Square, and by the circumstance that a monument to LoRD
Nelson has been erected in another square_named after JAcques
CARTIER, the original founder of Canada. It certainly does seem
wonderful that, considering how punctiliously the British Government
has respected and protected the institutions and laws of French
Canada, the people of Montreal should abuse us like pickpockets for
proposing to name one of their squares after the British Sovereign,
and setting the image of a British hero, up in the other. But this is
just the way we always do offend people after having done our utmost
to deserve their gratitude. We confer on them inestimable benefits,
and then unwittingly inflict on them, some petty slight, or exas-
erate them by some unintentional insult. We consult their interests
ut overlook their prejudices; do our best to promote their moral
and material prosperity, but tread by accident on their sentimental
corns. To pamper Sepoys and give them larded cartridges was a
regular British blunder; and it was a blunder still more regularly
and truly British to call a square in Montreal by the name of our
QUEEN, and to post an º of NElson among the descendants of
French people in a place which would have been appropriately occupied
by that of a distinguished Frenchman.
How shall we make amends to the susceptibilities we have wounded?
Shall we implore the City Council of Montreal to call the square which
was to have borne the name of British Majesty, Bourbon Square?
Shall we invite them to remove NELsoN from Cartier Square and put
CARTIER on Nelson's pedestal? It would be as well perhaps if we
were to endeavour to disarm the animosity we have unawares provoked
among foreigners, and particularly our next §§ if we were, as
a set-off against our Waterloo Places and Trafalgar Squares, to call
several of our streets Bonaparte Street, and to name the new bridge at
Westminster Austerlitz Bridge. It is true that we have Napoleon as
well as Wellington boots. The more general adoption of such nomen-
clature would show that we intend no affront to those who feel them-
selves aggrieved by the clumsy ineptitudes—gaucheries don't they call
them?—which they mistake for insolence. The fact is, that we, being
extremely deficient in pride and vanity, cannot conceive how others
can be irritated by trifles, of which we in their places should take no
notice except that of a smile. ". should pity our obtuseness. As
to NELson's statue, the French Colonels themselves might be content
to see it in the Place de la Concorde, on the condition that it should be
made by one of our own sculptors. They might admit WELLINGtoN’s
on the same terms. Both Waterloo and Trafalgar would then be more
than avenged.
Tribulation Cumming.
THE REVEREND DR. CUMMING has published a new book and some
prºphetic sermons, in an advertisement of which he styles himself
‘Author of The Great Tribulation Coming on the Earth.” DR. CUM-
MINg, by his own account, would seem to be a very ill-natured person;
but let us hope that his machinations will be frustrated, and that his
malevolent hopes will be disappointed by the non-arrival of the cala-
mity which he appears to anticipate so conſidently as to call himself
the author of it. At least, we may trust that he will inflict upon the
world no greater tribulation than a great bore.
Waste of Print.
“LoRD GRANville's errand to Madrid is in connection with recent efforts to put
down slavery.”
“The KING or NAPLEs has been ºf ic d an asylum by the Queen of SPAIN in the
event of his being expelled from his dominions."
Except as regards the names, these paragraphs seem to Mr. Punch
to be tautology.

THE TRAVELLING SEASON.
THE KING, or NAPLEs has decided upon
taking along journey. As Wesuvius was getting
too hot to hold him, he has been recommended
change of air by his physician, DR. GARIBALDI.
The atmosphere of Naples was found a great
eal too oppressive for one of his feeble con-
stitution. In this instance, the formality of a

een kindly intimated to His Royal º

any annoyance on his journey, he : "...

The Houses of Idleness.

than two hundred obeisances had to be given

may well fall low when they have so little to be

DOUBLE MEMORY.
In the pages of Once a heek we read the particulars of the case of a
young la { who was afflicted with what is called “A.Double Memory.”
One day she was as ignorant as a Member of Parliament, and the next
she would be as accomplished as the object of your affections that you
have an º with at eleven o'clock to-morrow in front of the
“hymeneal altar,” at St. George's, Hanover Square. On Monday her
fingers would be quite sore from not knowing how to handle her pot-
hooks and hangers; but on Tuesday she would write you a book
almost as clever as any written by MRs. GoRE. . This two-fold state,
in which one was alternately a child and a young lady, must, however,
have possessed certain advantages. It is sometimes so convenient for
a young lady to forget to morrow the beautiful things she has been
promising you to-day. Moreover, is the case so very wonderful after
all? Cannot every one recall to memory innumerable instances of old
ladies who have fancied themselves almost young children, and, under
that delusion, have acted most childishly? It was once our *}} lot
to know a friend who owed us a certain sum of money (say £1000).
Not º for five ºf years did he recollect that he owed us the
money, but at last, when hope had almost grown into despair, he also,
by some miracle or other, recollected to pay it / It is true that the
second recollection was of very slow growth, but the two facts, taken
together, authorise us in saying, that we look upon the above pheno-
menon ºf our friend as the most wonderfuſillustration of "150 ubie
Memory” we ever met with.
The Prince of Wales in Canada.
On Tuesday, the 21st ult., his Royal Highness drove out to see the
Falls of Montmorenci, near Quebec. Whilst he was contemplating the
cascade, a bystander remarked that the noise was deafening. “Ah,”
said, another, “that is indeed extraordinary. , Qataract is generally
blinding.”. The speaker was a Surgeon; and his observation was
rebuked with a universal cry of “Shop !”

THE WOLUNTEER. MOVEMENT.
Another admirable phase of the above movement was the won-
derful precision with which, to a minute, several of the leading establish-
ments in London closed their shops last Saturday week. When the
“close” order of “Put up Shutters” was given, not a man lagged
behind. It was another ebullition of the stron. Volunteer spirit which
animates the entire country. If we are “a nation of shopkeepers,” it
is but right that the shopkeepers themselves should do something to
defend it. If they cannot exactly give their bodies, they are right, by
thus closing early, to prove that they are perfectly willing to ſend
their “hands.” #. closed shutters are an addition to the Wooden
Walls of England. If Louis NAPOLEoN should ever become our cus-
tomer (and there is no doubt that in one sense he would be, a very
"ugly customer” indeed), a notice might be written on each shop-
front that he would be “served,” not behind the counter, but in the
open field, where all military orders would be executed on the shortest
notice. Should it ever come to a measurement of weapons, we are
ositive that the English yard-measure would teach the French pretty
orcibly to mind their “aune.”
The Two Extremes.
At some public meeting we read, that “the thanks of the Meeting
were given to the Press and SIR. GeoRGE Bowyer.” This convinces
us more than ever, that there is only one step from the Sublime to the
Ridiculous. How strangely astonished SIR GEORGE must have been
to have found himself thrust into such intellectual company. The poor
fellow must have felt very uncomfortable!
“coming Events,” ETC.

CHAPTER XXIX.-TWO WORDS MORE ABOUT THE REIGN
OF RICHARD THE SECOND.
Not HER eccentricity to be
noticed in the civil cos-
tume of this period was
the wearing of wide sleeves,
which were “shaped like a
bagpipe,” and were known
in common parlance by the
name of “pokys.” This they
}. obtained from the
act that odds and ends were
now and then poked into
them ; for the Monk, of
Evesham tells us that they
were also known as the
“devil's receptacles,” be-
cause of their convenience
for hiding stolen goods.
In spite of this, however,
servants were allowed to
wear them like their mas-
ters; and we have no doubt
their example was followed
}. their “followers.” The
sleeves were made so §
and wide that they reache
down to the knee, and
sometimes even to the feet;
and it is easy to imagine
that any snapper-up of un-
considered trifles could
make a decent living by
the perquisites he pouched. Another nuisance in these pokys was, that
they continually were dipping into dishes, for the Monk expressly tells
us that servants when engaged in bringing in the sauces, “dyd saucilie
contrive to lett their sleeves have y” first taste.”
Fully as absurd as these foolishly wide sleeves were the sillily long
shoes introduced about this time, and which were known commonly by
the name of “crackowes.” It is likely they were called thus from the
city of Cracow, whence there is some reason to believe they were
imported. Shoes with long points, we have seen, were worn in England
as early as the reign of WILLIAM RUFUs; but from these the crack-
owes differed somewhat in their shape, and in having their points
fastened up with chains of gold or silver to the knees of those who
wore, but could not otherwise have walked in them. Mention of these
crackowes is made by an old writer in a work called the Eulogium

FRIEND." DATE 1390.
- !F. because there is so very little praise in it), and as it likewise
rows some light on other fashions of this period, we are disposed to
let the passage have insertion in our Book:-
“Aboute this time ye Commons [i. e. the people, not the House] were besotted in
exceedinge excess of apparrell, some in wide surcoats reaching to their loins, some
in a garment reaching to their heeles, close before and struttinge out on ye sides, so
yt at yº backe they make men seeme like women, and this they doe call by yº
ridiculous name of gowne. Their hoodes are little, tied under yº chinne and eke
buttonedde like yº women's, but set with gold or silver and precious stones. Their
lirripipes or tippets do pass round yº neck, and hanginge downe before reach to yº
heeles all jagged. They have another weed of silk which º do call a paltock."
Their hose are of two colours, or pied with more, which they tie to their paltocks
with white lachets called herlots, withouten any breeches % Their girdles are of
gold and silver, and some of them worth twenty markes. Their shoes and pattens
“re snouted and piked, more than a fingere long, crookyng upwards, which they do
call crackowes, resembling devil's clawes, and %. to yº knees with chains of
golde and silvere."
For further information respecting the clothes worn by civilians at
this period, we may well, refer the curious to the Canterbury Tales,
where. CHAuCER, who combined the º: with the poet, has
described a lot of people of both high and low estate. They may learn
here how the Squire wore a short gown with long sleeves, and a robe
embroidered—
“As it were a mede
Alle fulle of freshe flowres white a rede:"
—how the Yeoman was "yclad in a cote and hoode of grene,” had his
horn slung in a green baldrick, wore a dagger on one side and sword
and buckler on the other, bore in his hand “a mighty bow,” and carried
a sheaf of arrows winged with peacock's feathers underneath his belt;
how the Franklin, or country
gentleman, is simply spoken
of as wearing an anelace, or
knife, and bearing at his
girlſº a gipciere or purse of
silk, which, being “as white
as milk,” for aught we know
may in reality have had the
colour of sky-blue; how the
Merchant is described as
being dressed in “motley,”
(a term which Chaucer
aptly gives to the parti-
coloured costume, we have
previously described, and
which must have made a
man look vastly like a fool)
and as wearing a forked
beard and a Flaundrish bea-
ver hat, and boots which, we
are told, were “fayre and
fetously yolasped; ” how the
Doctor was clothed “in san-
guin and in perse” (i. e.
purple and light blue), an
the Lawyer wore a medley
coat striped with different
colours * and y-girt with
silk : how the eve or
Steward (who though called
a Reeve may really have been somewhat of a º was adorned with
a long surcoat and a rusty sword, had a closely shaven, beard, and hair
rounded at the ears and docked upon the crown in the manner of a
priest's; how the Ploughman wore a tabard and a hat and scrip and staff,
and the 'Shipman was attired in a gown of stuff called falding, ſalling tº
the knee, and had a dagger under his arm slung by a lace thrown round
the neck; how, for reasons of his
own which it is needless to inquire
into, the Miller wore a white coat,f
a blue hood and sword and buckler,
with the addition upon holidays of
hose made of red cloth; and how the
Haberdasher, Carpenter, Weaver
Dyer, and Tapestry Worker, all
wealthy London burghers—
“Were yelothed in a livery

—a phrase which might induce one
to imagine them ancestrally related
to our flunkeys, and first founders of
the solemn Brotherhood of Plush.
In this reign, as in the last, the
hair was worn rather long and very
carefully curled, and the beard long
and forked, "like the faii of .
swallow,” a fashion which can
hardly be considered inappropriate,
seeing that the swallow has con-
nection with the throat. Whether
the dandies had a habit of twiddling
their moustaches is more than we
can say; but they wore them long
and drooping upon each side of the
mouth, as one sees is not infrequently
done even to this º ---
With regard to the military cos-
tume of this period, we find there
was but little noticeable change in
it. The gradual substitution of plate
armour for mail, which had been pro-
ceeding in the previous two reigns,
was continued and brought almost
to completion under Richard. . Of the complete suit of ringed mail,
which had been in use at the beginning of the century, all that now
remained were the apron edge, the gussets which were made to shield
the joints, and the camail or chain neck-guard that was added to a
* This “weed" it would ap had sprung from Spanish soil, and had been
somewhat in use with the flower of the nobility in the time of Edward THE THIRD.
The word paletoque is still extant in the Spanish dictionary, and is there said to be
“a kind of dress like a scapulary," which instructive information leaves us little
wiser than we were before. Du CHESNE describes a scapulary as a monk's frock
without sleeves; and as the word paletoque is obviously compounded of palla a
cloak and toque a kind of head-dress, we are encouraged to conjecture that the
garment had a something like a monkish cowl attached to it. As paleto in Spanish
signifies a clown, it is ...! the paltock was first worn by common people;
and as the modern paletot is obviously descended from it, we think that advertising
tailors should advertise the fact. -

t “Why does a miller wear a white coat?” is a question which will doubtless
occur to learned readers as having been in everybody's mouth about this period,
having been introduced perhaps by the Joe Miller of the day.

* The state purse being emptied by the wars of Edwarp THE Third, by the

be that one need not copy nowadays the costume there described. Sir
Topas, when he dressed himself, first of all put on :-
“Of cloth of lake fine and clere

And over that an habergeon

a lot of things to have to wear, and what a bore they must have often
been to those who bore them. We complain a good deal of the dis-
comforts of our clothing; but the miseries of Sir Topas must have far
exceeded ours. Just imagine our M.P.s “debating” in the dog days

PORTER ON POLITICAL ATOMS.
The free, and independent electors of the city of Exeter
met the other day at the London Inn, having been con-
vened by circulars “to hear a further exposition of the
political views of Whitworth PortER, Esq., the Con-
servative candidate for the representation of the city, in
the room of MR. DiveTT, who is about to retire.” The
following is a specimen of the political views regarding
Reform exposed by MAJoR PortER:—
“He observed upon those who were endeavoured to be added to
the franchise by the two statesmen alluded to, and said that he
thought those who were mentioned in MR. Disaarlı's Bill were
better than opening the flood-gates and letting in those which Loan
John Russell, desired. The bill of that statesman was an atom of a
bill from an atom of a man. (Laughter.)”
If LoRD John's Reform Bill was an atom of a Bill, and
a measure of which the strength was proportionate to the
size, how could it have been powerful enough to open
flood-gates? Is MAJoRPoRTER a disciple of HAHNEMANN,
and does he imagine that atomic Bills possess the virtues
which Homoeopathists ascribe to infinitesimal Pills?
MAJOR PoRTER calls Lord John Russell an “atom
of a man.” This is just the phrase in which a tall officer,
superior to the biggest blockhead in height and nothin
else, would be likely to express his contempt for a politica
opponent of small stature. Is the gallant Major six feet
high? Or does the candidate for the ..." of
Exeter look down upon the Secretary for Foreign Affairs
from an intellectual altitude?
WHITwoRTH PortºR, Esq., in propounding the above
illustrations of his Conservative Atomic Theory, may
perhaps be considered not only to have delivered an expo-
sition of his political views, but also to have exposed him-
self. Do the electors of Exeter require him to afford them
any further exposition of politics or self-exposure?

Take your congestions and pleurisies hence, as
Well as your agues and slow influenzas—

Go with a murrain from each and from all!
Sorely the wheat on the uplands you threatened,

The market for light summer muslins you flattened,
As the poor draper's stock-book too certainly tells;
You thinned the hotels, and you town-tied the tourists;
You made the Lake car-men perforce sinecurists; . .
F'en the Volunteer movement you aimed at restraining,
But it went on full gallop, in spite of your raining;
And the soldierly spirit, in Curragh and Camp,
Like John BRIGHT, by your spouting you struggled to damp.
Our peaches you stonily hindered from swelling,
Washed out all the savour from pear and from plum,
Made our peas so insipid they scarce were worth shelling,
Persuaded the swallows that winter was come.

And summer transported to Botany Bay; -
That the dogs, for some cause, had had their days demolished,
And Sirius been muzzled, or minced like Dog Tray.
And the world seemed a vista of weary wet Sundays,
And mankind's occupation to chant “de Profundis; ”
And barometers stood as if fixed at “much rain; ”
And we thought we should never see sunshine again;
And all of our blindness and bitterness, too,
Was owing, oh soppy St. Swithin, to you /
But the sun in the heavens was steadily shining
Behind the dark rain-clouds, for all who could see ;
And the fº we deemed perished, the fruit we thought pining,
Kept their faith in the future more constant than we;
The rain-cloud must pass, and the growing things knew it,.
And garnered each glance of the sun that pierced through it;
For now that St. Swithin is chased from his hold,
They don feasting garments of green and of gold:
And waving glad welcome to sun and blue skies,
Bid even St. Swithin God speed, as he flies!

pigtail in the mode prescribed by Society on
such occasions, he would “make himself pecu-

of buying new clothes which they do not want,

the performance of idle, unbecoming, and intrin-

father, perhaps º a family dependent upon his

look forward to in his old age beyond what he
can save out of his hard and precarious earn-

FRIENDs, LA letter
in a newspaper from
an English resident
at Chusan, contains
the passage follow-
Ing:—
“I saw a washerman
this morning, and asked
him why he made himself
peculiar in plaiting his
pigtail with drab-coloured
silk. He replied, “I lose
my moder.’”
The writer of this
remark was evidently
a gentleman of your
way of thinking, for
he represents the act
of the Chinaman, in
plaiting his pigtail
with drab-coloured
silk on account of his
mother's death as
something absurd.
The habitual wearing
of drab, of course, he
does not consider
you do; but he deems
it folly to put on that,
or any other particular
colour on the death of
arelation—inanity for
a man to illustrate
a solemn, grief, by
changing, the fashion
of his clothes. He

MUSIC AND MATHEMATICS.
ANY a time we have
said, “When we have
nothing else to do (a
condition which we
fear will postpone the
act we contemplate to
arather remote period),
we will knock off a
pamphlet which shall
enumerate the barrel-
organs wherewith we
. are afflicted, and
shall show by some
statistics the damage
that the country is
annually sustaining by
them.”
Considering the
value of our literary
labours (for how long
could Society survive
3 without its Punch *),
it becomes a point of
really national impor-
tance that we should
never in the least be
interrupted in our
º - ºntº º *
In F º work. As our nerves
ºy | { WW |Nº|| ſ are rather delicate (fine
} |- -- minds are in general
attended with fine
nerves) the faintest and
most distant squeaking of a hº is sufficient, so to speak, to knock us off
our perch. The very instant that we hear it, the fear of coming horrors com-
pletely overpowers us; and throwing down our pen we make a frantic rush to
our remotest coal-cellar, where with cotton in our ears we tremblingly abide until
we think the danger past. From this our readers may imagine how street-music
in general tormentingly affects us, and we need not undergo the pang of giving
more particulars. Suffice it to add, that were a vagrant pair of bagpipes to strike
up, before we could escape from our study to our coal-hole, the chances are that
Bedlam would receive us the next morning; and it makes us ill to contemplate
the probable result, were a brass band on a sudden to bray beneath our window,
selecting Poor Dog Tray, or some such fiendish tune, to bring out the full effects
of four trombones and a cornopean, in which well-balanced combination about nine
out of ten of our street orchestras consist.
Levity apart, and street musič is no joke to those who, like us, suffer from
it, a headache is a luxury which men who live by brain-work seldom can afford
themselves, because indulgence in it totally unfits them for their business. It
is no wonder, then, that writers should complain about street music; for they
suffer in their pocket as well as in their patience from it. How many more good
books might have been given to the world, had German bands and barrel-organs
never been imported, is a point for the Štatistical Society to argue, but which
we cannot spare our space at present to discuss.
To take but one example of the losses which are visibly occasioned through
this cause: a considerable proportion of the life of MR. BABBAGE has been
wasted in his sufferings at the hands of these street miscreants, and in his
laudable exertions to summon them to justice. This is no novel story, and
critics may accuse us of commenting on stale news. But in the latest case
reported of him there was a fresh grievance, to which the notice of the Magistrate
was specially directed, and which appears to claim the notice of MR. JUSTICE
PUNch. It appeared from the evidence adduced in the Police Court, that certain
most ºniº; neighbours of MR. BABBAGE took delight in hiring vaga-
bonds to play under his windows, and thus to interrupt the studies which they
had no brains themselves to value. On this disgraceful conduct, MR. SECKER
spoke as follows, with an amount of indignation which all right-minded readers
certainly must share:–
“The complainant was, no doubt, entitled to the peaceful occupation of his home, and so far as
he (the Magistrate) was concerned, he should have the protection he properly claimed and
required from annoyance while in the exercise of his calling. It was not to be endured that
neighbours should continue to encourage street musicians for the sole purpose, as it seemed to
be, of preventing the complainant from studying in his own house; and if they persisted in
# i.#:perhaps find that they were liable to an indictment for assisting and abetting
There is a childish little e which we remember to have played at, whereof
the fun consists in your obliging the player who sits next you to go through a
great number of corporeal contortions, which }. are gratified to think you have the
power to inflict. The game is called “Neighbour, Neighbour, I’m going to torment
wokſ "these words being uttered as a prelude to the mandate which throws your
neighbour's person into a contorted state. Now some such pleasant game as this
appears to have been indulged in by the neighbours of MR. BABBAGE, who have
ma tly enjoyed the fiendish pleasure of tormenting him by hiring hurdygurdy-
rinders to disturb him at his work. The only drawback to their pleasure must
ave been their inability to witness the contortions which poor tortured MR.
BABBAGE must have suffered through their means.
Vol. XXXIX.-1860,
To have seen him in despair pacing round and round his
study, with his fingers in his ears, or else fruitlessly endea-
vouring to sit still at his desk and bear historments like a
martyr, suffering, a fresh º of pain as every new
squeak, reached him, this would have been doubtless as
* to historturers, as were the shrieks which reached
ING PHALARIs from, the victims, he confined in his
burning brazen . . A picture of MR. BABBAGE as the
#. Mathematician must no doubt have been con-
tinually present to their minds, and have afforded them
most probably great pleasure to contemplate. The thought
that what is play to them is death to his desk-labours,
doubtless adds an extra zest to their enjoyment of the fun.
Such persons pay no heed to their duty to their neighbour,
and by urging on the organ-fiends to worry and torment him,
they rob him of his labour as they rob him of his peace.
To a man like MR. BABBAGE time of course is money, and
any one who robs him of it should be punished as a thief.
In dealing with the organ-men this should be borne in
mind, and culprits who abet them should, as criminis par-
ticipes, be made to suffer for their guilt. There is no
excuse to be made for such offenders, and no extenuating
circumstances to mitigate their punishment. Were MR.
JUSTICE PUNCH to be entrusted with the sentence, he
would condemn them to confinement in a solitary cell,
where the fiends they have invoked to torture MR.
BABBAGE should be the sole “companions of their soli-
tude” allowed them. Instead of the hard labour of
grinding at the Crank, they should be made to grind away
at the intº or the hurdy-gurdy, until they were
made sensible of what torture could be caused by it.
the turning of an organ-handle did not ere long turn their
brains, it would simply be, we think, because their heads
were empty; and this, considering their conduct with
regard to MR. BABBAGE, is a conjecture which there really
seems fair reason for our hazarding.
SUDORIFIC POPERY.
A BLASPHEMoUs rogue of a Roman Catholic Priest
at Naples attempted to create a diversion in young
BoMBA’s favour at the last moment by getting up a
miracle, consisting in the perspiration of an image meant
for the Virgin....The hoax of the “sweating Virgin” was
exposed; as will, let us hope, be the humbug of the lique-
faction of the blood of St. Januarius. What was the object
of the priest in “sweating” the statue, beyond that of
creating vague terror and alarm among the Lazzaroni, it is
not easy to understand. Such a prodigy would most
naturally be interpreted into a hint to the Bourbon that
Naples was getting too hot to hold him, or else to consider
where he expected to go to, lest his ultimate destination
should be a place where such monsters of wickedness, as
the porter in Macbeth says, have to “sweat for it.”
Practical Joke at the Expense of Public Creditors.
WE have often pointed out the absurdity of sending
money to the ChancELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, on
account of Income Tax which has not been demanded.
Now you see the result of this injudicious practice. The
Government demands a double Income-Tax, the British
impost and the Indian too, on the interest of Indian stock.
The object of MR. GLADston E probably is to render that
stock as popular as he is making himself.
HOW TO GET A RIDE FOR NOTHING.
PURCHAs: a penny paper. By jumping on the steps of
the various omnibuses, and pretending to offer it for sale,
you can easily get a ride from the Bank to Hyde Park
Corner for nothing. If you wish to return, you have only
to take the same steps backwards.

MR. BULL remarked to the languid Mourner over the

To see, whilst abject heads they bowed,
The blood of Januarius melt:
A #. miracle behold

Which melts when hot, congeals when cold,

Of slavery a mournful scene—
A wretched land of blood and tears.
Her best blood ne'er had ceased to drip,
Her tears continued still to flow,
Beneath the rule of sword and whip,
Since Freedom perished long ago.
But now, as GARIBALDI speeds,
To Italy, from hills to shore,
Restoring Liberty, she bleeds
And weeps, except for joy, no more.
False jugglers, he outdoes your art;
His honest truth excels your lie;
His hand has healed her wounded heart;
Her blood is staunched; her tears are dry.

AN The Dublin Correspondent of a morning paper states

“The English steamers sailing from Belfast, ticularly those

His Holiness the Pope, therefore, does not get all the
Irish geese, and by far the greater number of those which
are good for anything at all are exported to England.
Moreover, the young and lean geese that go to England get
fat and fit for the table, whereas, of those which Ireland
sends to Rome, the greater part return leaner, and not

the cellars of the British Museum, change places. The
Metropolis would be sure to be the gainer. It would be
a sweeping bargain, that would have the singular merit of
resulting in a profit to both sides. The cellars could not
lose, and the streets must win. Our only regret would
be, that by this exchange we should lose our beautiful idol,

GEOMETRY OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD.
AMong the fashionable announcements of the Post one day lately, the
peculiar properties of the circle in relation to the superior classes were
H.P in the cases of several members of the aristocracy. A right
honourable gentleman and lady, and a duke, were represented as about
to receive, respectively, “a select circle of friends.” Another duke
was described as “surrounded by a select family circle.” In reading
this last sort of notification, we are sorry to say we are always reminded
of an incident which occasionally occurs in that not very select circle
the ring at Astley's, when the Clown tries to slip a hoop over the
Riding Master, but the Riding Master slips it back over the Clown,
before Mr. Merryman has time to stop himself from saying, “High
diddle diddle the fool in the middle.” In this case the fool is sur-
rounded by a circle, and so is the duke in the other, only the Clown's
circle is that through which the horseriders jump, and the Duke's is
a select family one. Yet both circles may be said to be of the eques-
trian order. The Duke is the centre of a circle, so is the fool; they
are alike in that point which the centre of a circle is defined to be.
Now if a fool is the centre of a circle of spectators, the circumference
of that circle must consist of persons who are some degrees removed
from a fool, if they are not very wise; but this remoteness from the
fool is simply local, and they may be all as great fools as the fool
himself. But the circumference of which the Duke is the centre is a
circumference formed by persons of quality, and their quality ought to
be uniform, because every part of the circumference of a perfect circle
is equidistant from the centre, and (if a select circle is not a perfect
circle, what is? Therefore, if they are not all Royal personages, so as
to be distant from the Duke by a degree of superiority, they ought to
be all Earls, so as to be one remove from his Grace inferiorly, or else
all Marquesses, or Earls, and so on, and the lower their rank the larger
the circumference would be, because the farther distant from the
centre; which is absurd.
Why will fashionable newsmen persevere in the solecism of denomi:
nating the guests of individuals of the upper ranks circles? Divers of
the nobility and gentry might be properly said to represent a square in
which they are householders; but if this is the square of a circle, there
has been solved a problem which will soon be followed by the combus:
tion of the Thames. Why resolve .# life exclusively into spheres?
Why not as well say that such a nobleman entertained a select oval,
or a distinguished ellipse ? Would that be too eccentric P Why not
arrange the society entertained by a given aristocrat into §:
or rhombs Perhaps because it is necessary to imply, that the great
creature around whom visitors revolve as it were in a circle or orbit

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LOGIC FOR LADIES.
BY ONE OF THEM.
ou will excuse any apology for .
present dissertation, and I sh
assign only one particular reason
for writing on Reason in general.
Ladies ought to be fine logicians;
for, whether they deal with Majors
or Minors, they have, generally
speaking, a perfect mastery over the
premises. -
Logic teaches us to train our
mental, faculties, so that we may
firmly hold the thread of our dis-
course, and prevent it getting into a
tangle. Under its guidance alone we
draw from sound premises a safe con-
clusion. If people's premises are un-
tenable, they must necessarily break
down, just as if an Alderman and
his august consort were to dance a
pas de fascination in one of our
modern compoed villas; assuming
(as we may) the premises to be un-
sound, one can easily predicate with what a disaster such an imprudent
step must conclude. - -
Of mental operations there are these three: simple, apprehension
judgment, and discourse or reasoning. Thus, if a lady's hoop should
entrap a gentleman's hat and carry it out of a church-pew, it is simple
apprehension; but it requires judgment to drop it gracefully at the
§: and logical acumen to prove that such an abduction is sanctioned
y the law of licensed carriers. - ---
A syllogism is reasoning expressed in propositions, and every argu-
ment brought on the tapis is reducible to that scholastic form:
You say, CARRY, that at eleven o'clock
I ought not to commence another cigar;
But it is not eleven—it wants three minutes. -
By your own showing, then, I ought to commence another cigar.
This is manifestly a reductio ad absurdum, and if CAROLINE, under
such an insult to her reason, were to remain dumb, it would be still
more absurd. She rejoins, mildly of course, “You know, CHARLEs,
my feelings as to Figars: the smoke enters the nursery, and makes
little ELLEN cough!” -
Charles (loquitor). Oh! very well; if you object to cigars, I’ll put
up with my hookah.
What logicians call this mode of reasoning I cannot. precisely say,
but I strongly suspect it must be the argumentum 'baccolinum. / -
In every syllogism we find an antecedent and a consequence, which
sometimes lead to strange and contradictory results; for example:–
Wealth is an essential antecedent to consequence.
Dobbs’s wealth is clear, though his antecedents are very obscure.
Dobbs's antecedents, therefore, are of no consequence.
Syllogisms are simple, or compound. A dear friend at whose
suggestion I undertook this essay, has favoured me with some simple
syllogisms from her elegant pen—here is one:—
All men are heartless.
A Parrot is not a Man.
A Parrot, therefore, is not heartless.
Again:- - , ,
Red whiskers are deceitful.
LIONEL LYNX’s whiskers are tawny.
LIONEL LYNX is very deceitful.
Therefore—Tawny whiskers are red.
This (par parenthèse) I may observe is one of Sophy's sophisms.
me more :-
Young married people cannot live on less than six hundreda-year.
EDWIN and MARIA married on five.
Therefore—Edwin and MARIA cannot live.
I must beg pardon for introducing my urbane reader to so dogmatic
an author as DR. SAMUEL Johnson, whose works, let me note (en
passant), hold a º though not very prominent position in every modern
bookcase. I have heard that DR.J. wrote aromantic drama called from
its biting humour Irony, but, never having read it, I cannot say con-
fidently that he did. To this sonorous Pundit, however, we are indebted
for a charming syllogism, which all lovers of real enjoyment will, I feel
certain, cheerfully endorse:—
Matrimony has its cares.
#. has no pleasures.
Those will embrace matrimony, therefore, who prefer pleasure to care.
I regret, from a humane feeling, that my kind printer cannot con-
veniently illuminate these glorious truisms with letters of gold.
Some, compound syllogisms are very ridiculous. Here is one in
which absurdity and conceit are equally mixed:—
Fanny's pin-money, under her settlement, is so much a year.
Mamma thinks this too little.
I think with Mamma.
Papa thinks it too much.
HENRY thinks with Papa.
Whatever, therefore, may be the value of my opinion and
Mamma's, -
The opinion of Papa and HENRY is not worth a pin. Q.E.D.
Reasoning in a circle is very fashionable; for instance:—
Those who marry for rank alone, are certain to repent.
Miss LoPTY married for rank alone.
Miss Lorty, then, is certain to repent.
But—LoRD Toppy is very old.
Oh! then Lord ToDDY, not Miss Lofty, is certain to repent.
This, I think, might more properly be called Tea-table logic, as I
have frequently met with it at Soirées, both in London and Bath.
The suppressio veri and the suggestio falsi next merit our attention.
When LADY OGLE tastefully trains her auburn ringlets over one eye,
so as to conceal a certain visual aberration, I call this a suppressio veri;
but when SIR NATHANIEL assures me he has no need of glasses, it is a
suggestio falsi, because I know that he has one, and a very good
imitation it is too.
Of dilemmas, properly so designated, I shall not treat; for, as little
RUPERT, my nephew, would say, it’s no treat for any lady to handle
them-looking at their terrible horns. In lieu of a dilemma, however,
my gentle student will please to accept a tender perplexity.
A white hand shows a tender heart.
That should be loved which shows a tender heart.
A young Divine has a white hand.
A young Divine then—
But no; that young Divine a wealthy widow woos.
Therefore—A tender heart must not be loved.
In conclusion, let me add that, much as I admire Logic, I would
rather praise my Nieces for making mince-meat than for chopping it.
Woman has her mission, and it is better that her mind should be
absorbed in knitting than in gathering wool. Of course I do not
recommend either pursuit, as Woman's special province is making ties.

For the miracle shown by the Church to its own,
Is that clot turnin’ liquid, widout foire to melt it;
But the miracle wanted to make sinners daunted,
Is the clot's keepin’ hard, till their hard hearts have felt it.
Sure the heretic crew will cry out, it’s a doo-
That it don't melt, because no priest's hand warms the phial;
But lave them to prache—sure the faithful 'twill tache,
That our Saints won't have heretics put 'em on thrial'

“Oh, look here, Billy; here’s a Swell with a Pork-Pie on his head/"
LANGUAGE OF FILOWERS.
A PIQUANT Report has just reached us from that loquacious little
Bird of nursery fame who is so notoriously given to eaves-dropping.
It describes a conversation, at which our twittering reporter was
present, having promiscuously dropped in among the sprigs of floral
fashion, with whose diction young Bird, from his position, is conversant
in most of its branches. Their language, somewhat flowery, is cast in
a good garden mould, and would not discredit colloquists in any walk
—gravel or grass; while their knowledge of political on dits might lea
one to surmise that they were mixed up more with Clubs than Spades.
We confess that the peep thus afforded us into the secrets of the
parterre has largely opened our literary eyes; for we never expected to
find so much genuine fun cropping out among the pinks of botanical
Society.

TIME-Break of day.

Tulip. Oh! dear Lily, that clumsy Gardener hasn't tucked me in
properly. I really feel as if I should tumble out of bed.
Lily. Don't be alarmed; there's no danger, my Tulip.
Tulip. Well, this will be my last night here. I’m going up to-
morrow for examination.
Rose. I suppose, then, . are prepared for being plucked?
Tulip. Perhaps I am ; but, at any rate, people won't squeeze me to
death, as they do all your family. How I should hate to be fondled by
some fantastic old Dowager with a parrot nose.
[Rose sheds a tear, which has been for some time due.
Lily. Never mind, Rose, dear; he is only jealous because, like a

Wiolet. Listen!

WHERE is that solitary Stoic who can contemplate witn:

bases equal in breadth and digestibility) which are annually
consumed by our native infantile population?-orwho can

sagacious statesmen could devise some employment that
would come within their grasp. We have various light-
houses maintained at much trouble and cost. Suppose in
place of them, we were to establish nurseries into which
the Martello Towers on our Kentish coast might readily
be converted. I’ll be bound that my MARY ANNE (afat.
seven months) if a hurricane were blowing in-land, would
warn off a vessel at the distance of a mile—her voice being
of such penetrating timbre, and her passion at bed-time
above all praise.
Another useful end might be attained by these Martello
nurseries. Not only might a fleet be saved, but an enem
frightened away. Those who were cradled on the lan
would have little to fear from those who were cradled on
the deep. My MARY ANNE alone, with her piercing treble,
could shield Folkstone from invasion, for Cºsas himself
would pause ere he attempted to seize her. Norlet our
patriotic Riflemen despise these vocal Volunteers. Though
in point of discipline they may not quite come up to that
high standard which some stern º Generals demand, I
think with a little training this new body of infantry would
at all times be ready to present arms; and, ticklish as they
may be, I feel assured that no prudent parent will make
light of their charge.
Aiolet. Lily, look at that poor learned Blue-bell; º takes any
notice of her. How strange it is that mankind in general should stand
so much in fear of a Blue.
Lily. It is very odd, but many strong-nerved men pause before
giving one of those bells a ring.
Wiolet. It’s .. Monsieur the Sergent de Wille did not hear you,
or he would certainly have taken you up.
Lily. Pourquoi?
Kiolet. Because you are addicted to play— -
Lily. Gambolling, you mean—on words, for smiles, instead of six-
pences—how ver illegai!
Rose. As for Monsieur, he's not worth a Bachelor's Button—he's
a married man.
Wiolet. You surprise me!
Rose. It’s true, machère—he gave his hand last night to one of the
Peaches.
Tulip. I know her, and they are well matched—she always looked
a downy one.
Łiolet, Do you see poor little Box over there? I do pity him.
Lily. On what ground
Violet. He is so very green. -
Rose. Hush! here comes that tipsy old Bee again—how sweet he is

Tulip (loftily). A set of proud upstarts holding their heads so high,
and looking down as if we were dirt under their feet.
Wiolet. Bee is a shocking old fellow—he's always in his cups. Rose,
are you asleep?
l Rose. No, dear, I’m only reading a heavy novel, and nodding over a
eaf.
Wiolet. Hm, should you like to be MRs. BEE? I’m told he beat his
first wife.
Lily. Resolved at any risk, I suppose, to escape from Bee's-wax.

THE papers are recording the progress of the EMPEROR

it must have a sly reference to the tour de force by which
the EMPEROR got, possession of them. In the latter case
it must be, or ought to be, un bien vilain tour.
GOGS AND MAGOGS.
WE see with great pleasure that the Government has refused an
application made by some well-meaning gentlemen for a quantity of
metal wherewith to make a statue to the memory of SIR John
FRANKLIN. The monument which FRANKLIN has made for himself is
more durable than brass, and his fame would derive neither extension
nor prolongation from a molten image erected in the market-place.
But even if it would, in case the image were well made, the proposal
to make one would remain objectionable, because we know that the
image would not be well made. There is not one modern statue about
Town that is not a disgrace and an insult, as far as it can be, to the
hero or statesman for whom it is meant. St. Paul's and Westminster
Abbey are full of statues of illustrious persons, nearly all of which
have no merit whatever but that of comicality, whilst many of them
are draped in the ludicrous dress of the last century; and it is fortu-
nate that they are situated in the naves and aisles, and transepts of
those churches, and not in the choir, where service is performed, the
solemnity of which would be entirely destroyed by the sight of figures
apparelled like old gentlemen in a farce.
Even if our sculptors could make good statues of nude or elegantly
draped figures, they would be unable to make any but absurd dummies
out of the suits of clothes with a head at the top of them of which all
likenesses of personages of the present time must consist, represented
either in ungainly uniforms, or civil coats, vests, and pants marked by
imagination with Sydenham 17s.6d. It does not mend the matter to
put your hero into a toga. He only looks as if he were going to be
shaved. We can't look, and can't be made to look like ancient Greeks
and Romans. , The classic age was, the age of sculpture. That was
the marble and brazen age. This is the wooden age. The propriety of
statues ceased when mankind began to Mister and Monsieur and
; and Herr each other, and the world became comfortable and
riſinful inus.
For ANTINous, for Juriter, for HERCULEs, statues are all very
well. Utsunt Divorum, MARs, BAcchus, Apollo; ricorum also, such
heroes as CoNoN and Lysan DER and Alcibiades. But they won’t do
for the British Grenadier or the British Sailor. Should CRoMweli,
have a statue? Perhaps. CRoMwell, in his habit as he lived, was
icturesque—may even be looked upon as statuesque. Shall FRANKLIN ?
of by any means, if Punch can help it. SiR John FRANKLIN was a
gallant commander; but he was a stout middle-aged man, and, figured
as such, in a naval uniform, his statue would be neither useful nor
ornamental, but on the contrary, a grievous eyesore in any situation
wherein it could be º except upon the top of a column like
Nelson's, where its ugliness would be out of sight.
A Lamentable Case.
In the money article of some paper we were painfully struck with
the following distressing fact:—
“No Gold was taken to the Bank to-day.”
Poor old Lady of Threadneedle Street!, Doesn't the reader feel for
her! Fancy, her, going one entire day without any gold being taken to
her! How did she sleep that night after such an overwhelming blow
of destitution? Might we inquire if it possibly disturbed her “rest”?
A BALMORAL OBSERVATION.
The Court Circular says, that the QUEEN drove the other day to the
Qolonel's Cave in Glen Eye... Is this the glen where the Falls of
Quoich, are?, If there is a place in all Scotland where one would
expect to find a cataract, it is surely Glen Eye.
THE BLACKEST Hypocrisy.-America pretending to be a land of
Freedom so long as Slavery exists in it!

SPIRITS, SIR "
BETTING ROGUES AND THEIR BETTERS.
At the Old Bailey, the other day, a MR. RoRERT BATTEN, aged 26,
a poulterer, having pleaded guilty to the charge of embezzling £75,
the money of EdwańD WEAtherby, his master, received sentence of
eighteen months’ seclusion, with the addition, we may presume, of
compulsory bodily exercise. Perhaps MR. BATTEN would have had to
apply muscular power to the crank for a somewhat longer period if he
had not made restitution to the amount of £36. He attributed his
deviation from the path of rectitude to that of roguery to the practice,
which he had adopted, of betting on horse-races.
The example set by noblemen and gentlemen, patrons of the Turf,
is sometimes represented as the cause which induces shopboys, ware-
housemen, clerks and other persons in such a situation as that of MR.
BATTEN, to turn first gamblers and then, by the most natural of tran-
sitions, thieves. This representation may be true, but if we did not
know that inferior snobs are prone to ape superior snobs, we should
think it was a mistake. A poor snob lies under a greater temptation
to gamble than a wealthy snob, just as he is subject to a fº.
temptation to steal. Betting, as one form of gambling, might, like
theft, be expected to be the peculiar vice of the necessitous. It seems
reasonable to believe, that many a betting man, and many a thief, in
narrow circumstances, would have been a respectable member of
Society if he had been well off. The presumption is, that he bets or
steals, or first bets and them steals, from the incentive of want. On
the other hand a Swell has no motive to induce him either to
steal or to bet except mere covetousness; so that if he steals it is
because he is naturally a thief. But then he would also be a natural
born fool to steal whilst surrounded with pleasure, and plenty, and
risk reputation, liberty, luxury, and even comfort. Therefore he bets
instead of stealing, because by betting he hazards only money, which,
being of a sanguine temperament, he does not expect to lose. If you
can assign any more reasonable explanation of the fact, that gentlemen
of wealth and station do addict themselves to betting, like the poul-
terer's man who got eighteen months, candidly impart it, if not, adopt
the foregoing together with Mr. Punch.
expecting some return, but rarely get it.
A WISE COUNCILLOR.
“Nay, if thou art joking Deputy-Lieutenants,”—roars Sir Tunbelly
Clumsy, feeling that audacity can go no further. Mr. Punch regards
the art of joking Town Councillors as almost as atrocious, and, in nº
light spirit extracts the following from a letter read before the Council
of º, in Scotland. That awful body has some shooting to let,
and a gentleman named CoMRIE was one of those who offered to take
the same. He wrote:–
“I make offer of two guineas a year for the shootings on the grounds belonging
to the burgh of Rothesay. I consider the above a fair rent for the first year, as Mr.
Ewing has hardly left a foot or wing upon the ground, but as it is necessary for me
to have some exercise and excitement to enable me to fulfil the duties of a coun-
cillor in a proper and becoming manner. Should there be a bona.fde offer, ºr offers,
higher than mine. I am willing to give a few shillings above the highest offer.
The construction of the most interesting sentence may be defective,
but Mr. Punch can, see no reason for the “loud laughter” which is
reported to have followed the perusal of this letter. Mr. Punch, who is
the “Councillor” of the nation, feels that even He requires “exercise
and excitement” to enable him to fulfil his duties “in a º and
becoming manner,” and he heartily sympathises with MR. Qoºſe;
Moreover, he admires that gentleman's wide-awake-ishness, which led
him to suspect that the Rothesay Town Cºuncil would try the dodge
of pretending to receive higher offers, in order to “run him up.” The
stipulations that he would advance on a bond ſide §." only is truly
charming. For their own reasons, however, the Council would not, let
him have the shooting, and Mr. Punch hopes that the worthy Councillor
will find feet, wings, exercise, and excitement, elsewhere; for nobody
can work without Glidays the grandest discovery of modern science.
The Support of Italy.
The Italians, desirous of j only One Italy, keep shouting

and safely render the vent air-tight. The writer wishes
that, if there is any better method of serving the vent of a
cannon than that which he proposes,...some scientific
engineer, should be invited to devise it. Certainly a
º: thumb is the most expensive of all possible vent-
stoppers for a cannon; to say nothing of the inconvenience
of losing his thumb to the sailor. Bereſt of his thumb
he ceases to be an able-bodied seaman; and the Naval
Service has not yet become so popular that it can well
afford to lose a hand, which it does lose when an able-
bodied seaman loses his thumb. Besides, when one able-
bodied seaman at the vent of a 68-pounder loses his
thumb, another at the muzzle runs a great risk of losing
his arm. So great is this risk, that any reflecting man
would strongly object to load a piece of ordnance which he
knew was perhaps only prevented from going off in the
process by the accurate pressure of another man's thumb
on the vent.
Sailors, now-a-days, are reflecting men, many of them,
insomuch as to be unwilling to expose themselves to quite
unnecessary mutilation. Intrepid as the British sailor is,
he is much more likely to hold a gutta percha stopper
steady on a cannon's vent, than a stopper consisting of his

A BULL OUTROARED.
. To the Beyrout Correspondent of the Times the British Public is
indebted for the publication of an edifying pastoral, said, to have been
issued by the Maronite Bishop of Tyre and Sidon, and breathing the
most pious sentiments, of a species similar to those which are expressed
in the passage following:—
“Now there has been a general meeting on the mountains of Lebanon of the
Chiefs of the people of Zahleh, Deir-el-Kammar, Keserawan, Jezzin, and of the
neighbouring places, that they will be as one hand against this nation (Druses),
small in numbers and weak, in destroying them, in shedding their blood, and in
taking their goods and possessions, and in driving them from out of the land which
before was that of your forefathers, the orthodox nation.”
The apostolical author of the above evangelical announcement goes
on to inform his flock—of sheep or wolves?—that
“There has come a letter from his Holiness our Lord the exalted Patriarch,
instructing us to aid the aforesaid people (Maronites of Rasbeya) as they may
determine; and for this purpose came the letter, that you may be every one of you
provided with the necessary arms."
This holy exhortation bears the signature and seal of the “humble
SEPHRONIUs, Bishop of Tyre and Sidon; ” the seal no doubt being one
of pantomimic magnitude. It is indeed a very good imitation of a
roaring papal bull. The affectation, bombast, and mock humility
which it is replete with, give it a close similarity to the “allocutions”
and “encyclical letters,” of which º is sick...The subjoined
brief extract reads, however, like an Irish Maynooth Priest's interpo-
lation in a pontifical edict:—
“It is determined here that on Monday next there shall be fighting."
The writer here drops down from the flowery height of ecclesiastical
rhetoric to the expression of common ruffianism in the vulgar tongue.
He had probably assumed a character that he could not sustain. Pos-
sibly, then, his alleged episcopal epistle was the forgery of a clever
Druse, who wanted to get the origin of the late massacres in Syria
imputed to the Maronites. He describes himself as writing under
ºl. from his Holiness our Lord the exalted. Patriarch. Now his
Holiness the Lord of the Maronite mongrel Christians happens to be
not the Patriarch of Constantinople, but, on the contrary, his Holiness
the Pope of Rome. A Druse would be likely enough to confound
those two hierarchs. We can hardly suppose that Pio NoNo per-
sonally commanded ScHMIDT to sack łºś. or has ordered LAMoRI-
CIERE to subject the towns of his insurgent subjects to pillage. As
little can we imagine him capable of issuing such instructions as the
above, declared to have been received by the humble SEPHRONIUs.
And then the Sephronian imitation of the Papal balderdash is a little
too strong of savage Orientalism... Let us, cherish, therefore, the cha-
ritable hope, that the self-styled “humble” SEPHRONIUs was, in reality
the humbug SEPHRONIUs, or some other designing humbug of a
heathen who assumed that name. But, heathen or bishop, SEPHRONIUs
is evidently a humbug.
GARIBALDI PAINTED BY A YOUNG LADY.

do, º: GARIBALDI as “a dear old weather-beaten angel.” e
doubt if angels care much about the weather, considering they are
always living in the open air, and are not generally represented as
having much clothing about them, though, on the other hand, it is
agreeable to picture GARIBALDI as an angel—an avenging angel for
the long-endured wrongs of Italy—the angel of deliverance for the
long-suffering martyrs of Naples. However, granting (and to a young
lady we are always ready to grant everything) that GARIBALDI is “a
weather-beaten angel,” it is a comfort to know that as yet he has never
been beaten by anything else.

FOREIGN LYRICS OF LOW LIFE.
“BEING at an evening party lately, and having sustained a severe
infliction of young-lady singing, a thought came into my head. I said
to myself, ‘These British Ladies have been for the last two hours
chanting about the supposed characters, feelings and habits of conti-
mental parties of the inferior class. We have heard The Muleteer.
The Gondolier, Il Pescatore, Le Postillon, The Boatman of the Darda-
nelles, The Sledge-Driver, The Tauridor, and a heap of other sentimental
portraitures of people who, if they were not foreigners, we should
never think of singing songs about. I wonder whether foreign ladies
and gentlemen pay our humble classes the same compliments, and do
so with the accuracy of detail with which our Lyric Bards describe the
folks our vocalists are so fond of?’ And, Sir, prosecuting the subject,
I learned, on inquiry at foreign music-shops, that the same class of
subject is as popular abroad as at home. I have obtained a mass of
songs much chanted in Paris, Madrid, and St. Petersburgh, in which
our cabmen, policemen, engine-drivers, beadles, watermen, and others
receive the same elegant and accurate treatment for the continental

And his love gushes forth like his ale from the bung;

A PRETTY SAFE PROPHECY.
In the Memoirs of Bishop Hurd, recently published, we meet with
the following prophecy. It is rarely that prophecies are so strictly
fulfilled, and this rarity is the cause of our alluding to this particular
one. DR. CUMMING must gnaw his fingers with envy:—
“Shortly after his arrival at Hartlebury, she said to him one day, ‘How do you
think your pupil, his Royal High Ness THE PRINCE of WALEs will turn out?”—“My
dear Cousin,” the Bishop replied, laying his peculiarly small white hand (enparen-
these, is it not a great peculiarity with Bishops that they mostly all have peculiarly
small white hands?) upon her arm, “I can hardly tell; either the most polished
gentleman, or the most accomplished blackguard in Europe, possibly an admixture of
both.”
And we all know how the Bishop's pupil, his Blessed Majesty
GeoRGE THE Fourth, did turn out. The prophecy was a pretty safe
one, it was sure to be true on one side or the other, and the result
proved it. Was he not universally acknowledged to be the most
polished gentleman in Europe? polished, as a boot is with blacking—
for his memory has received nothing else. It is true that Europe i.
since reversed its own verdict, and rather leans now to the opinion
that, instead of being the most accomplished gentleman, the Prince
was rather the reverse. Thus, Bishop HuRD was doubly right with
his double-barrelled prophecy—the Prince was “possibly an jº.
of both "-a kind of “Prince's Mixture,” that contained a very large
proportion of “Blackguard.” It is not often that Bishops can see so
far; but then Bishop HURD had such a brilliant pupilſ

WALOUR PROMPTLY REWARDED,
AN officer, under the signature of HARD UP, complains in the Times
that, although the third anniversary of the capture of Delhi has now
elapsed, the prize-money taken on that occasion has not yet been dis-
tributed. Can this be true? Many brave fellows to whom some of
this money was due are dead, and how long will those who are living
have to live to enjoy their share of it? If there is any one labourer
who is worthy of his hire, surely it is that one whose labour consists
in fighting, and who has especially earned a reward by helping to take
a city in his country's service. What difficulty can there be in the dis-
tribution of money in hand? If there is none, or none which is in-
superable, in the present case, what words can express the height or
depth of the rascality on the part of those Jacks or Knaves in office
who are responsible for that infamous procrastination which has kept
the heroes who are entitled to the Delhi prize-money out of it so long?
SNOBBISM AND SPORTING.
“Cato Cottage, Peckham.
“PRAY Mr. Punch, are you not fond of deer-stalking P. I can't say I
am myself; but that’s ū. fault of my physique, and is not to be
regarded as a mental blemish. People generally like best the sports
which they excel in; and nature, when she gave me a protuberance of
person, with a couple of short legs, and—I must add-wind to match
very clearly did not intend me for a deer-stalker. My long limbed
friends assure me that the sport is splendid fun, and are so good as to
invite me to their lodges to partake of it; but I don't quite see the
“fun’ of scrambling over boulders; of panting up a mountain merely to
pant down again; of scampering over plains, and shambling oyer stones,
and floundering about in Theather some three or four feet high (which
may be easy work, no doubt, to persons with long legs, but is terribly
hard labour to people who have stumpy ones); of sliding down a
precipice, or wading up a waterfall, or crawling along a stream as flat
as you can stoop, with your waistcoat in the water and your very
whiskers wet with it; of sitting in damp clothes upon rocks as hard as
adamant, and crouching behind corners until you get the cramp, and
waiting hours and hours for the chances of a shot, with the odds at
ninety-nine to one that you won't get it, and if you do the odds are
that your Fº has got wet and that your rifle will miss fire, or that
you’ll feeſ so nervous when the creature comes in sight that you’ll
blaze away by accident while you, are taking aim, and so almost get
ºri. for having bagged a gillie, or knocked over a ekeeper.
this may be Fºl. good sport to those who like it, but it would
be certain death to a man of my physique; and I think I am quite
justified in restricting my enjoyment to the eating of the game, without
attempting to partake of the pleasure of pursuing it.
.“Having a healthy appetite, it delights me nevertheless to hear of
slimmer persons, indulging in the sport; not merely because I think it
is a manly, healthful exercise (for those, I mean to say, whom Nature
has adapted for it), but because there is, the chance that I may profit
by their labours—venison sent gratuitously being at all seasons pleasant
to receive. Of course I own this last reflection cannot influence me in
hearing of H.R.H. PRINCE ALBERT, still, as a loyal British subject, I
am always, charmed to hear of his successes as a deer-stalker; and I
annually devour with an increasing relish, the accounts which the
Court Circular affords us of his sport. The history, I must confess, is
somewhat bare and meagre, being limited in general to the statement
that ‘the Prince this morning went out deer-stalking,’ without inform-
ing his admirers, how many stags he mastered, or how many shots he
missed. Still, the stalest of stale crusts is better than no bread; and
hungry as I am for whatever crumbs may fall to me from the Royal
table, the smallest contributions in the way of sport intelligence I
thankfully receive. ... Every now and then, though, I come across a
paragraph which I find grows yearly more and more perplexing to me,
and, as you know everything, I am driven in despair to ask you to
explain it. The following is the passage to which I would refer,
extracted word for word from the Times of the 15th. Those who study
the Court Circular must be doubtless well familiar with it, for, with but
little variation, it annually recurs, and is repeated some half-dozen
times in every shooting season:—
“The Prince Consort, attended by the Gentlemen-in-Waiting, drove to the
Abergeldie woods, which were driven for deer.”
“The driving of the Prince, and the driving of the woods, are things
which I am competent, I think, to .* The only part which
puzzles me in this wº." paragraph is the yearly introduction of
the Gentlemen-in-Waiting. For the life of me I can't conceive, Sir
why the Gentlemen-in-Waiting are lugged into the account. As f
read it, the statement bears no sort of reference to any courtly cere-
|mony, in which the presence of the Gentlemen-in-Waiting is needful.
When perusing it, P. the Prince Consort as a sportsman not a
| court's man; and what have deerstalkers to do with Gentlemen-in-
Waiting? is the question which quite .."; rises to my mind. Do
|Gentlemenin-Waiting attend His Royal Highness for the purpose of
officiating in the place of gamekeepers? Do they carry the Royal
powderflask, and load the Royal rifle, and instruct the Royal sportsman
where he ought to stand, jº. he º to fire, and what he ought
to do supposing he should miss? Or do the Gentlemen-in-Waiting
perform the part of waiters (as their name seems to imply), and
scamper about at lunch-time with napkins on their arms, handing the
Royal sandwich, to subdue the Royal appetite, or the Royal pocket-pistol
to wet the Royal whistle? To an inquiring mind like mine, and ºne
loyally inquisitive about the Royal movements, a hundred, other
questions instantly suggest themselves, of fully, equal interest with
those which I have named. But I confine myself to asking-Do you
think, Sir, as a deerstalker, that the Prince gets better sport by going
out attended by these Gentlemen-in-Waiting? And do you think, Sir,
as a subject, that your loyalty is heightened by having mention of such
escort yearly dinned into your ears?
“One of the charms of shooting, at least so far as I, a Cockney,
understand it, is the freedom it affords from the forms of courts and
cities, and the solacing relief of the hour or two of solitude which ill
places like the Highlands it is certain to secure. Whether his Royal
Highness appreciates this pleasure, it is not for me to ask; but I am
certain if he does he cannot possibly get much of it, seeing that he
never can enjoy a day out deer-shooting without a pack of Gentlemen-
in-Waiting at his heels. - -

and to yourself,

“A BAD SPORTSMAN.”
An Invariable Rule.
When an M.P., at an agricultural dinner, or a cutlers' feast, or a

to intrude politics, because politics by the rules of the society are
excluded, you may be sure that he is on the point of introducing,them,
and that he will do so the very next minute; and, furthermore, that he
wilitaſk of nothing else but politics during the remainder of his speech.

CHAPTER XXX. —THE FASHIONS OF THE LADIES OF THE
FOURTEENTH CENTURY.
ovely Wom AN in the reign of
KING EDward THE THIRD
showed as usual that in point
of finery and fashion she natu-
rally belonged to the weaker-
minded sex. Her habits at
this period are described as
being sadly sumptuous and
extravagant, “far passing y”
menin all mannere of arraies.”
“Neat, not gaudy,” was a
maxim that she paid but little
heed to; and she hardly gave
a thought to the cost of her
costume, so long as she could
*. to get somebody to
pay for it. It is by habits
such as these that Woman
makes herself so dear to all
who have to do with her, and
we have no doubt that the
dressmakers during the four-
teenth century were as terri-
ble to husbands as they are
in the nineteenth.
In Epward's time the
gown or kirtle was still made
with tight sleeves, much the
same as it had been in the
two preceding reigns; and
the mode remained un-
- changed throughout, the
reign of Richard THE Second, which ended (ask the nearest charity
ºhild), with the last year of the century of which we are now treating.
The sleeves sometimes reached the wrist, and sometimes stopped short
at the elbow, and in the latter case had pendent streamers, which were
called tippets, attached to them. We have noticed the same fashion in
the male dress of this period, and as lovely womanisan imitative creature,
we incline to think she did not set the mode, but followed it. Fº
it may be interesting to some of our fair readers, if we specially make
mention, that the gown was now cut rather lower in the neck, and was
worn so long in front as well as in the train as to require to be held up
when the attempt was made to walk in it. In-
deed the fashion of long trains was now carried
to such lengths, that actually a tract was written
by some dreadful old divine, entitled “Contra
caudas dominarum,” in plain English, that is,
“Against the Tails of the ladies.” Another
point moreover to notice in the gown was, that
instead of being worn all loose and flowing, it
now fitted closely to the waist, and a protube-
rance was added which we dare not more than
hint at, further than to say, in the smallest of small
type, that a reference is made to it in a riddle of the
E. which belikens a fine lady to a careful house-
eeper, for “shee maketh a grete bustle aboute a littel
waste.' That horrible old fogy, Dowglas,
Monk of Glastonbury, says the women of his
time “dyd wear such straiten cloathes that
they hº foxtailes (!) sewed within their gar-
ments for to holde y” forth; ” but this surely
must have been a scandalous invention of the
holy father, who being a single man, of course
could have known nothing of the secrets of the
toilette.
Like the gentlemen, the ladies took to
wearing at this period the garment called a
cote-hardie, which we have previously described.
For the benefit, however, of readers with short
memories, we may again state, that the cote
was a somewhat, graceful ent, not unlike
a long pea-jacket, fitting closely to the figure, and reaching about as
far as the middle of the º: It was fastened in the front with a
row of large-sized buttons," had sometimes streamers from the elbows,

ing of The Founteen TH

* Buttons were at this time very generally used for whatever wanted fastening;
and indeed were often worn in such profusion that people must have wasted a great
part of their lives in buttoning their clothing. FAIRHolt speaks of the cotehardie as
"having nought extravagant about it, except buttons;” and judging from the look
of them in some of the old drawings, it seems to have been the cheese to have them
made as big as cheese-plates. History repeats itself, so assuredly does Fashion.
and sometimes had a couple of small pockets in the front, in which
the fast girls stuck ºil, no doubt, and did their best, we dare
say, to swagger like the swells.
Another point of resemblance between the dresses of the gentlemen
and ladies at this period was, that the latter often came out in that parti-
coloured clothing to which the notice of the reader has already been
directed. It was no uncommon thing to see a beauty with one sleeve
of blue and the other sleeve of white; and if by any accident her
stockings became visible, it would have been found they were made
also not to match. Like their husbands too, the ladies often bore their
armorial bearings emblazoned on their gowns, which were rendered
thus as hideous as heraldry could make them, with all its curious
*::::: of blue griffins and green geese. -
A loose garment with long skirts, bordered and faced with fur, was
introduced about this period, and worn over the kirtle. The chiefly
curious point, about it was that, generally speaking, it had neither
sleeves nor sides; the armholes being made so large, that the girdle of
the kirtle which was worn beneath, it was visible at the hips.
interesting specimen of this sideless sleeveless garment is shown in an
old drawing in the Argentine Collection, representing QUEEN PHILIPPA
(who has let down her back hair) interceding for the lives of the six
burgesses of Calais; who with halters round their necks are kneeling
to KING EDwARD, with the piteous looks of aldermen when panting a
request for a third helping ºturtle, or pleading that their venison
been sent them with no fat.
EDWARD THE THIRD AND QUEEN PHILIPPA. FROM A M8, IN THE
Argentine Collection.
MR. STRUTT, who as a writer on the subject of costume must clearly
be regarded as one of the first walk, quotes an interesting story from
a manuscript of this period, which shows that ladies were at times not
much more sensible in dress, in the reign of Edward THE THIRD, than
in that of QUEEN VICTORIA. As the story, although French, has an
admirable moral, we may without imprudence transfer it to our print:—
“The eldest of two sisters was promised by her father to a young and handsome
knight, who owned a very large estate. The day was appointed for the gentleman
to introduce himself, he not having as yet seen either of the ladies; and they were
duly informed beforehand of his coming, that they might be properly prepared to
receive him. The affianced bride, who was the handsomest of the two, bein
desirous to show her elegant shape and slender waist to the best advantage, cloth
herself in a cote-hardie, which sat very strait and close upon her, without any
lining or facing of fur, although it was winter, and exceedingly cold. The conse-
quence was, that she appeared pale and miserable, like one Fº with the
severity of the weather; while her sister who, regardless of her shape, had attired
herself rationally in thick garments lined with fur, looked warm and healthy, and
as ruddy as a rose. The young knight was fascinated by the girl who had the least
beauty and the most prudence, and having obtained her father's consent, proposed
to her instead of marrying her sister, who was left in single blessedness to shiver in
her finery, and sigh at her sad fate.”
This affecting anecdote is related by a Norman knight, named
Geoffroi DE LA Tour: LANDRY, who recites it in a treatise on morals
and behaviour, which he composed expressly for the use of his
three daughters, and in which occur some, curious details respecting
dress. It is not now, the fashion for fathers to write books for the
instruction of their children (who would probably not dream of reading
anything so “slow”), but were any Paterfamilias to venture so to do,
we should advise him to insert the story we have cited, and to devote
a page or two to fit, remarks upon the salutary moral that it points.
The anecdote we think might be most profitably repeated, if it only be
This fondness for big buttons was certainly revived by our “gents” a few years
back; and many of our fast girls, if we remember rightly, copied it.

to illustrate the evils of tight-lacing, which is still one of the weak-
messes of the weaker sex. Indeed a stronger term than “weakness”
ought to stigmatise such folly, seeing that it sometimes amounts almost
to suicide, for it entails a certain sacrifice of health if not of life. . A
“good figure” is no doubt an enviable possession, but its attainment is
too commonly attended with bad health; and husbands as a rule think
far less of fashion than they do of flesh and blood, and are less likely to
be ; by a pair of well-shaped stays than by a pair of rosy cheeks.
Girdles handsomely embroidered, and embossed with gold and silver
were generally worn over the kirtle and cote hardie, and were girt
loosely on, the hips, and not round the waist. A sort of pouch or ||
reticule, which was called a gypsire, was worn pendent from the girdle,
occupying much, about the same position as the chatelaines which
lately were in fashionable use. As it was tastefully embroidered, no
doubt the gypsire was at times merely worn by way of ornament; and
we learn that a small dagger was occasionally stuck through it, which
doubtlessly was likewise only worn for decoration, or if ever it was
used, it surely must have been for some, such peaceful purpose as
piercing a few button holes, or stabbing a plum cake.
The hair was still worn in a fret or cauſ of golden network, which
sometimes was surmounted by a coronet of jewels, and sometimes by a
- wreath of flowers, or
else simply by a veil.

however, and at pic-
nics (if there were
any) ladies mostly

and wrapped round
their heads like cords

“tippets,” which
were the long
streamers depending
from the hoods.

copy or CHAUCER. hole of oblivion, for
we find no mention
that it was still in use. Coverchiefs or kerchiefs were still worn b
way of head-dress among the middle classes, but by the swellesses it
seems they had mostly been discarded. CHAUCER's Wife of Bath, he
tells us, wore them once a week; and if she had any tendency to
headache, we can scarcely wonder that she did not wear them oftener,
for he expressly mentions that they were “full fine of ground” (what-
ever that may mean) and he adds:–
“I durste swere that they weighed a pound,
That on the Sonday were upon hir hedde:
Hire hosen weren of fine scarlett redde,
Ful streityteyed, and shoon full moist and newe."
We learn too of this lady:—
“Upon an ambler easily she satte,
Ywimpled well, and on hire hede an hat
As brode as a bokeler or a targe.
A foote mantel about hire hippes large,
And on hire feet a paire of sporres sharpe."
With the exception perhaps of the wimple and the spurs this des-
cription might have fairly been applied to the Miss BRowns, Miss
Jones Es and Miss SMIThs, who a season or two since were wont to
amble about on donkeys by the sad sea-waves, at Ramsgate; for the

CLUBS AND CHARITIES.
To Mr. Punch.
“SIR, “Club, Pall-Mall, Friday.
“I AM ashamed to put a more specific address, for it is a dis-
º thing to be in town at such a time as this, but an Irish friend's
aving unaccountably forgotten to remit the money for a bill which I
accepted for him as ‘the merest matter of forrum’ has compelled me
to come up, and all my business friends having in the most unbusiness-
ike manner taken themselves off to Southend, Switzerland, and similar
places, I am unhappily obliged to remain and collect my funds wise:
modis... I am sure that you will sympathise in my humiliation, and be
content to forego the inclosure of a card, which I am aware you usually
insist upon. I am a gentleman, Sir, although in town at the end of
September.
“Having much leisure, I read all the papers at my club, as much to
avoid the contemptuous looks of such of the servants as are not
grouse-shooting as for any interest I can take in literature at such a
time.
“I º that a Reverend Gentleman by the name of KEMPE (which
reminds me, of Kemp Town, which is bad enough, but better than
London in the autumn) has been publishing a complaint that the Clubs
of London . the best parts of the best, parishes, but do not con-
tribute to parochial charities, except º: out their broken meat
to the churchwardens, and such like. The Reverend Gentleman wants
the Clubs to come down handsomely with benefactions.
“Now, upon my life, Sir, one always knew that of all the unhesi-
tating mendicants the parsons are the most unblushing, and that out
of every dozen letters on a fellow's table there is sure to be one from a
Reverend, inclosing a statement that in the parish of St. Miasma,
or St. Fetida-cum-Drains, there is no Church accommodation for eleven
hundred heathens and a half, for whose benefit he sends you a
perforated card, into which you are to insert a shilling of your last
winnings at billiards ". and thus bless the residue and remainder.
But, really, when a Reverend Gentleman asks a Club to * its
subscriptions in aid of the poor-rates, I can only say that -
cooler card than the perforated pasteboard.
“Why, Sir, does the Reverend K. know that at this very moment
half the Clubs in London want more billiard accommodation?" Does
he know that port wine is fº dearer and dearer every day, and
that it is the bounden duty of every Committee to lay down every good
§ they can hear of P Does he know, Sir, that we want more warm
aths built?, Is he acquainted with the price of tobacco for does he
need to be told that very few Club cigars are fit to smoke, in conse-
quence of the dearness of the article and the reluctance of men to give
more than eightpence or ninepence for a weed? Is he aware that our
libraries, º: the French novel departments, are far from com-
plete, and that from the absence of duplicate sets a man has often to
wait a couple of days for the last Paris story, especially if an English
dramatic author gets hold of it? Can he have been apprised that Club

ance, a fellow has often, to wait three minutes before his table can be
cleared and the wine, brought? I am not hostile to the Clergy, Sir,
far from it, and I willingly assume that the Reverend Gentleman is
uninformed of these facts, and that his preposterous proposition would
never have been made had he possessed ampler knowledge. But in
the face of this painful destitution, in the presence of these revolting
details, it is mockery to ask the Clubs to squander funds in charity.
“I do not insist, Sir, upon the impropriety of a Club's º: a
public contribution, and proclaiming its almsgiving, though such a
thought might have occurred to a minister of the Establishment. But
charity should be a secret matter, of which the world should have no
knowledge. “What I give is nothing to nobody’ was the admirable
remark of one of the most ...; Members of Parliament. The
ostentation which would be manifested by Club donations would be most
objectionable to the feelings of Club-men, who are celebrated for prac-
tising the truly Christian virtue of retiring modesty upon the subject
of any good deeds they may do, should they happen to do any.
“I will only add, Sir, that should the plausible but most improper
appeal of the REv. M.R. KEMPE, produce any effect upon, our Com-
mittee (not that I would wrong them by believing it, possible), I, for
one, will leave no stone unturned to eject that Committee from office at
the earliest opportunity, and I have the honour to be, Sir,
“Your very obedient Servant,
“THOMAS ANTIKEMPIs.”
“P.S. The poor, I am given to understand, have Clubs of their own.
Let them apply there for assistance, if they want it. We occasionally
send the hat round for a Swell—properly recommended by Swells—so
it is unjust to accuse us of illiberality.”

SERMONS AND SORE THROATS.
UNDER the signature of T. B., a correspondent
of the Inquirer discusses a peculiar complaint to
which preachers are liable, and which appears
to be known to those whom it concerns § the
name of “Minister's Sore Throat.” T. B. ob-
serves that singers, who exert the vocal organs
much more powerfully than preachers do, are
not subject to this affection, and attributes their
exemption therefrom to the modulations of sound
wherein their performances consist, as con
trasted with the usual monotony of sermons,
which he supposes to be the cause of the minis-
terial malady. It is possible that harping upon
one string, as it were, of the chordae vocales, *
produce a soreness of the part overstrained. It
is desirable to know whether the “Minister's
Sore Throat” is confined to Dissenting Ministers,
or whether it is an orthodox ailment.
There are certainly some divines other than
nonconformists, who in preaching are wont to
utter such uncouth tones as to grievously offend
the ears of the listener. In the effort of producing
such painful sounds they may also perhaps hurt
their own throats, and serve them right. But
who ever heard a parson of the old school com-
plain of any injury to the throat sustained through
preaching * }; the plump old pluralist with a
red nose ever suffer from “Minister's Sore
Throat”? Yet surely he was monotonous enough
in preaching. But it must never be forgotten
that this kind of clergyman was in the habit of
keeping the immediate neighbourhood of that
mechanism which is liable to be deranged by
preaching well moistened with a fluid which is
an excellent gargle—port wine. It is very true
that he always drank his *f; Perhaps also
he did not preach too long. How if the pastors
who suffer from “Minister's Sore Throat” were
supplied by the liberality of those who sit under
them with plenty of the parson's preservative
sº that complaint, on condition of their
observance of the same moderation as that which,
on the parson's part, may be supposed to have
been a condition to the efficacy of the remedy?
A FRIENDLY WENTURE.
“MIGHT I_tempt you to venture upon this
orange?” “I should be happy to oblige you,
Madam,” said LEIGH HUNT, who was thus j
addressed hy a lady, “but f'm afraid i shoul
fall off.” The PRINCE OF WALRs, much in the
same way at Kingston and other places in Canada,
would not venture near the Oranges; for fear, not
of falling off, but of falling out. There might
have been a falling off of his popularity, had he
yielded to the insolence of these sour bigots, who
acted infinitely more like meddlers than oranges.
If we were asked to say, what were the Fruits
of Sedition, we should not hesitate for a moment
to reply—“The Oranges in Upper Canada.”

OUR AUSTRIAN SYMPATHIES.
ENGLAND must fraternise with Austria. Surprising as
“I say, Old Fellow, it’s not the slightest use trying to shelter there—you'll be wet
through in no time. Why don't you follow my example *
this declaration may seem, its truth will be apparent from
the facts, that, for the last ten years the Austrian nation
has paid taxes, to the amount of 800,000,000 florins more
than it did in the ten preceding; that the national debt is
1,300,000,000 florins larger than it was ten years ago; that
State property valued at 100,000,000 florins has had to be
sold; that the deficit expected in 1861 is 39,000,000 florins
ºven in case of peace; and that the people are subject to a
war-contribution" of 32,000,000 florins per annum.
These circumstances are stated in the report of a financial
committee; and what Englishman that reads them can
eſtain from exclaiming to his Austrian fellow sufferer,
“Come to my arms, my brother in taxation! Let us
compare what our friend Dish AELI calls fleabites.” We
are told that the war-contribution is so exceedinglyonerous
that it cannot ºf be levied. How very like our own
Income Tax! Perhaps, even as that impost, it is assessed
with the utmost injustice, and levied so as to inflict the
ſº possible inconvenience. Whilst, therefore, John

“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I DID hope that we were going to hear no more of MR. G.
H. M., the gentleman who insulted us, the Matrons of England, by
saying that we did not know how to give dinners properly, and by
offering us all sorts of advice which was not required, and if it was,
was not going to be taken from such as him. But it seems that he
cannot keep his disgusting ſº pen quiet, and that not being able
to find anything good enough to eat in #jº. he must go to Russia
for a dinner, and he had better stop there. I am not going to demean
myself by going through his letter of two columns long, all about his
dinner, like a Pig, and indeed Iscarcely read a quarter of the rubbish;
but I shall only say that the creatures he speaks of who want a floggin
before dinner to give them an appetite, should have a precious goo

marble halls.” That ought º enough of Bohemian Girl for him. I
despise. G. H. M., Mr. Punch, and that’s the long and the short of
it, and it’s no use saying it isn't, because it is.
“But what I meant to say to you was, that I do hope you will set
yourself against the fashion of these Russian dinners, dinners à la
Russe. If there is one thing in the world I like, it is to be able to say
to people, 'You see your dinner.” I am old-fashioned, I dare say, but

like people in an omnibus, eat and drink, and go away. . And this you
call having a dinner! I don’t, if you do. . I choose to talk about my

A PRINCE PROCEEDING TO AMERICA.
=º tº ºr O BRoth ER PRINCE,

reported to have been

him the propriety of
going to America.
Some British colony

has been forced to

and there appears to
be good ground for
questioning whether
a more personal kind
of investment in the
stocks might, or not,
be the legal consequence of some of his pecuniary transactions. It has been suggested that

É. but, unless, PRINCE takes many, rich
ollowers out with him, it may be conjectured
that he and Young will not agree to put their
asses together.
The exoteric doctrines of the Mormon Chief
and those of the Prince of the Agapemone
perhaps differ, but there is every reason. for
supposing that their esoteric views are identical.
They have both of them, no doubt, genuine in-
ternal convictions, though neither of them has
#. been convicted of swindling; BRother
RINCE having been compelled to make resti-
tution by a legal tribunal, which had not the
power to allot, him likewise a term of laborious
grinding, at the crank. They both evidently
coincide in a belief in the main chance, as con-
tradistinguished from predestination and every-
thing else, except, perhaps, polygamy.
If there is balm in Gilead, there is tar in
America. There are also feathers. These con-
siderations may, if they fail to render BROTHER
PRINCE disobedient to , the revelation which
orders him to the United States, at least induce
him to take good care in what, portion of the
American territory he pitches his tabernacle,
and to make sure that it is one inhabited by the
greatest fools, and exempt from the jurisdiction
of JUDGE Lynch.
Extremely Shell-fish.
We beg to present the reader with the two
following latest novelties in the way of autumnal
conundrums:–
1st. Why have lobsters no feeders? Because
they have antennae (haven't any).
2nd. Why is a supplementary plate of crabs
like the Alien Act P Because it contains an
extradition clause (an ertra dish and claws).
If the too indulgent reader were to try for
a thousand years, he would never be able to
beat the above in badness.
OUR ROWING CORRESPONDENT.
“My DEAR PUNCH,
“It may seem anomalous that your, Roving Correspondent
should, at this season of all others in the year, be still in Town. Such,
however, is the fact. While others were looking after their passports,
getting them vised and inserted in charming little morocco cases, with
their names neatly printed in gold outside, or arming themselves with
those wonderful circular notes (which by the way are really rectangular
but still, extremely useful), or investing in miraculous knapsacks,
which hold everything you don't want, from a portable shower-bath to
a patent shaving-brush; while, I say, tourists have been consulting
Bradshaw, haunting Railway Offices, and flurrying themselves generally,
your humble servant has been quietly occupied in his studio over his
canvas and cutty-pipe.
“Perhaps a continental tour has lost its charms for me, . Perhaps, I
am somewhat weary of trips down, the Rhine, fortnights in Paris,
excursions to Switzerland, pic-nics in the Pyrenees (where Iwill our
indefatigable tourists next spend their autumn?) Perhaps out of
perversity I am determined not to do whateveryone is doing. Perhaps
the balance at my banker is not of sufficient preponderance to justify,
&c. &c.—what matters? Here I am on my native soil; neither
watching the sun rise upon the rosy J ". nor sink behind the
great dome of Buonarotti; but looking at the rain, drizzling, pattering,
pelling down on London pavement.
... “Slow this sounds I admit; but in pleasant company what'situation
is not tolerable,” I would not give a fig for the finest scenery in the
world if I should be condemned to wander through it alone. 1 think
I am a gregarious animal, and can't º life without a companion.
Some of my friends who are of an equ { sociable turn, are good
enough to drop in upon me occasionally to share mycognac, or join me
in a pipe, and so we manage to f. through an evening very pleasantly.
Sometimes STIPFLER holds forth on the divine art, and grows warm in
defence, of Pre-Raphaelites, or old Massicot, sitting down, at my
battered piano, trolls, out a jolly ditty. And in truth I would rather
listen to him than to the strains of Miss Gushington, who warbles at
LALY PRISM's soirées, for all her fine contralto voice, f fear there must
be some truth in the theory once prevalent in fashionable circles, that
we painters have low tastes, and instinctively incline to humble sources
of pleasure. For my own part I admit that there are occasions when
a churchwarden pipe and a wainscotted tap-room possess irresistible
attractions for me. Why should I be ashamed to own it?. Has not
the greatest poet of modern times written an Ode to The Cock, that
famous chanticleer, under the shadow of whose wing how many wits,
authors, artists, have joked and eaten! Nay, had not the great Lexi-
cographer himself a weakness for tavern dinners? I have seen the
corner pointed out, in which the author of Rasselas used to sit,
(GRABLEY the stockbroker takes his chop there daily), and I like to
imagine the old philosopher puffing and grunting over his humble fare.
There must be some charm about a neatly sanded floor, which we miss
in the produce of Kidderminster... I have been assured by a score of
exceedingly respectable persons that they prefer a pipe in, an old
fashioned chimney-corner to º souchongin the genteelest boudoir
in Christendom. What do I but follow in the wake of my more dis-
tinguished brethren? A great modern author has said, that a painter
should be fit for the best society; and keep out of it. There are a few
of us who dance attendance on fat dowagers, and haunt the houses of
the great, but ninety-nine out of a hundred prefer ease and good
fellowship at home. Thank heaven, the flunkeydom of Art is past,
and if our pictures are engraved, there is no need to dedicate the proof
to my LoRD MEcAENAs for the sake of his gracious patronage or
precious gulneas.
“So my friends take kindly to my easy chair, and in a cloud of
fragrant Latakia forget to sneer at my humble Penates. Last week I
met, an old German chum, HERR. Von STUNNINGER, who used to
study in the Munich Academy, until, the death of his uncle, and his
consequent accession to the family thalers, induced him to relinquish

split, but the fact is, that STIPPLER, who had on my shooting jacket,
which is much too small for him, actually did lose several buttons in a
fit of laughter behind the Times, when he saw my foreign friend thus
orgeously attired enter the apartment. For my part I felt sor

coming to a grand, entertainment, and here were we smoking short
clays and imbibing beer like amateur coalheavers. , What do I say?
smoking? beer-drinking? If the STUNMINGER had been of any other
nation than his own, I might have felt embarrassed. But when did a
Wateriander ever refuse a weed and a glass of ale? Imploring him to
be seated (for the honest fellow was standing in the first position, and
bowing away to everyone, including MRs. K., at the rate of ten, miles
an hour), I presently divested him of his dress-coat, and lent him a
dressing-gown, enveloped in which easy garment, and pulling away at
my best Meerschaum, he soon made himself at home, and recounted
. late adventures. He had been in Town but five days, and in that

º: of time had managed to visit more lions than I ever expect
to see during the term of my natural life.
“Qf course he had been over the Tower—of which I have only once
caught a fº. from a penny steamboat. He had penetrated into
the humid regions of the Thames Tunnel, and scaled the heights of the
Civic Monument. He had been introduced to MADAME Tussaud's
ceroplastic celebrities, and had watched with delight the gambols of
the hippopotamus in the Regent's Park. He had been wound up in the
ascending-room of the Coliseum, and lowered in the diving-bell at the
Polytechnic; visited the Law. Courts, ‘vare I underwent,” said the
#. fellow, “a brofuse transpiration, the Metropolitan Prisons, the
ouses of parliament, Guildhall—what not. He was good enough to
speak of all in terms of glowing admiration. One was “sehr hibsch,”
another wunderschön. His only regret was, that he had had no
º of seeing SHAKsPEARE on the British stage. “My frient,’
said he, ‘I would have liked to see Hamled by WELPs or KEAN in
How you Please It.'. He went to the Olympic, and came away shocked
at Mſ. Ronson's admirable impersonation of the Kenetian Jew. He
looks upon burlesque as a sign of the decadence of the English Drama,
and censures the immortal Bard himself for his disregard of the
“unities.
“As the evening wore away, I think it was STIPPLER who proposed
that we should adjourn to PADDY GREEN's, and afford the STUNNINGER
an opportunity of seeing that famous Music Hall. ...We summoned a
cab, and it would have done your heart good to see the Herr taking off
his hat to the Peeler who shut the door for us. “How amiable are
your constables!" he exclaimed, as we drove away, and I believe he
tipped X4002 a shilling for his pains. At GREEN’s the STUNNINGER
made himself thoroughly at home, listening to ‘The Tardy Horsman,”
“The Chaffing Crow,' 'Band the Life moat, and other popular melodies
with the greatest enthusiasm and delight, and breaking a tumbler or
so at every round of applause, MR. GREEN the well-known proprietor
tendered his snuff-box with his usual affability, and HERR Joel, at the
particular, desire of a few, kind, friends (who have made the same
. of him any night these twenty years) favoured us with his
celebrated imitation ºf a male and female kingfisher, a trombone, a
hayrick, and other types of lower creation.

taking a candle from the night-porter, and collecting all his energies

THE CRYSTAL PALACE BABY COURT.
We hear it is the intention of the Crystal Palace Company, who are
always active in administering to the wants of the pleasure-seeking
public, to open, a small Court for the reception of the Babies who in
such numbers daily honour the Palace with their presence. To ease
the minds of such Mammas as bring their Babies without nursemaids,
the Court, will be º: with suitable attendants; and every care
will be taken, in the absence of their parents to provide the infant
occupants with recreation and refreshment. A quantity of pap will be
continually on sale, and Babies who—despite of stern GEORGE CRUIK-
sHANK–are addicted to the Bottle, will be furnished with the means
to allay their inward ºf:
Corals will be kept for all the tiny teeth in need of them, and rattles
of the newest and the noisiest description will be constantly, in readi-
ness for all the little hands which may be stretched and clapped in
eagerness to seize them. A lot of baby-jumpers will also be suspended
for infants who are fond of active sedentary exercise; while for Babies
of more dormant and retiring dispositions cradles, rocked by steam
will be let out by the hour, each one warranted to send its inmate oft
to “bye-bye.” within the limit of a brace of shakes, after tucking up
in it. In short, no pains will be spared to make the Court, a pleasant
lounge and agreeable midday resting-place for all the tiddy ittle
sings” whom their Mammas may wish to leave there, like parcels,
until called for: -
The chief object of the Court is, however, not so much to please the
Babies as the public, who are now continually annoyed by squeals and
squallings, at times when such disturbance is most trying to the
nerves.”ft is an aggravating thing for a connoisseur of music to find
a pack of Babies in full cry in the concert room, when he goes there to
enjoy a symphony of Beethoven or a melody of MozART. The power
of disturbance by a Baby with good lungs is considerably greater than
the ignorant may think. Indeed an infant's throat, if its possessor he
in health, is one of the most powerful wind instruments we know.
A solo on the squall is quite enough to drown a solo on the flute; in
fact, the other day as we sat hearing the Creation, the grand crash of a
chorus was completely overwhelmed by the squeals of MRs. BIBs's
baby just behind us.
By the opening of the Baby Court these interruptions will be stopped,
and the Crystal Palace Concerts may be heard without annoyance.
This consummation is the more devoutly to be wished, as the music
which is given there really is worth hearing, and it tries one's temper
sadly to listen without ºf it. By the arrangement now in prospect
this aural disappointment will in future be avoided; and in common
with all lovers of the Crystal Palace Concerts we shall most heartily
rejoice when we are able to announce that the project we have men-
tioned has been put in actual ..". and that daily during concert-
time every Baby in the building has to undergo the ceremony of
presentation at the Baby Court.

ROME ON THE SEINE.
THE following article, which explains, on behalf of the French
Imperial Government, the relation of the Tuileries to the Watican, may
be regarded as semi-officious:—
The Government of the EMPEROR, ever having at heart the interests
of France and the Catholic world, which are inseparable, has known
how to conduct itself under existing complications.
When France kneels, Europe falls prostrate. When France crosses
herself, Europe beats her breast. -
Will the Sovereign Pontiff quit Rome? Will the Holy Father stay
where he is Behold the two questions of which France is going to
propose a solution.
It is incontestable that Rome is the patrimony of St. Peter. But the
Pope is the father of 200,000,000 Catholics. Therefore, wherever the
Pope may be, he can bless the whole world from the roof of the nearest
house. It follows that the Pope is unable to quit the metropolis of
$ººm; because Rome, so to speak, accompanies him wherever
e goes.
evertheless, unbounded freedom of action is necessary to the
political independence of the Head of the Church.
It is in this regard that France has resolved to astonish the world by
a self-devotion which will exemplify the inexorable logic of faith.
By this time the Catholic populations will have comprehended the
necessity of ºf the Holy Father to take up his residence at
Paris. Paris, equally with Rome, is the Eternal City. Consequently,
in going to Paris the Pope, does not quit Rome; it is † a change
of air; a transition to a mild atmosphere from one of which the tempe-
rature was excessive.
The treasures of Christian and Classical art which have been accu-
mulated by so many Pontiffs, can accompany his Holiness. -
France, is profoundly Catholic....What is Government? It is, for
France, Catholicism applied in politics. What! is there one morality
for individuals and another for nations? Certainly not. The Imperial
Government will therefore constitute itself towards France, and thus
towards Europe, the Executive of the Catholic theocracy.
Nevertheless the Government of the EMPEROR will reserve to itself
the filial privilege of advising the Father of the Faithful, and tendering
to the Sovereign Pontiff those necessary counsels, which, when adopted,
must be universally accepted as the dictates of infallible wisdom. In
this manner France will reconcile a devout . with the º of
the present situation, and will consult European objects which are also
those of the Church.
A TORTURER'S PLEA.
ONE Hopley, a ruffian, usurping the sacred name of Teacher,
recently flogged a child, to death, and is undergoing a righteous
sentence for his crime. For some reason, he is permitted to make a
plea in print against his punishment. His plea is as loathsome as his
crime. e has the effrontery to urge, that in, beating REGINALD
CANCELLoR to death, he, Hopley, the Brute, was but following out a
System which has been strenuously maintained by religionists. And
he cites cases in which the most cruel chastisements have been per-
severed in by Christian parents, until exhausted and tortured children
have been compelled to beg mercy. His argument is that we, the
Wiser and Stronger, are entitled to use our strength against others
until they admit our wisdom.
We are content to accept the man's propositions, and we call for
the adoption of his system. §. English .# says, in its
wisdom, “It is wicked to torture children.’ opLEY refuses to admit
this, "Well outraged ºnglish Society lº. to be stronger than

A Poor Look Out.
It would be rather awkward, when that new Zealander comes to
Waterloo Bridge to take his celebrated sketch, if he hasn't a half-
penny with him to pay the toll; for how, pray, is he to take his stand
on one of the middle arches, if the toll-keeper will not allow him to

future prospects have been so frequently and so eloquently commented
upon.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
A REAL WORKING MEN'S RIFLE CORPS.
, “PERHAPs they won't per-
\\º sewere !” was the reflection
of the footman when he
heard his bell º vigo:
rously a second and third
time; and did not think it
worth his while to trouble
, himself to answer it.
“Perhaps they won't per
sewere !” may have like-
wise been the thought of
certain friends across the
§ Channel, when they heard
how energetically our Rifle
§ Movement was first started,
%, and what vigorous vitalit
7 was evinced in its .
* progress. If this were so,
; however, we apprehend that
* Our good friends have been
# sadly disappointed. The
ardour of our Riflemen has
not been “too hot to hold,”
as the common ºf goes;
and the wet, which they
have marched through has
entirely failed to damp it.
Ardent spirits as they are,
the members of our Rifle
Corps will bear a lot of
sº water before they are much
3 weakened by it. Their
- º: fire is not easy to
e quenched, and we may
now regard them as com-
pletely above proof, with
so many watery trials has
their strength been weekly
to posterity by the members of the Deptford Company,
of whose good work their captain,_Montgomerſe by
name, has let us know this much:—
“Having received from a friendly neighbour ground for ball practice,
and spoilt bricks enough for a wall, they set to work to erect their
own butt; and in seven evenings, working with a will, and every
member of every rank, the chaplain not excepted, taking his turn
at digging and wheeling, . erected a wall sixty-four feet long, ten
ºna six feet thick at the base, with an embankment
it."
This. Deptford Corps, we learn, was set on foot for
“working men.” Assuredly its members, in erecting their
own butts, have not belied their name, and they have
thereby made it one which they may well feel proud of.
We think if other corps were to follow in their footsteps,
there would be smalſ harm, and probably great benefit.
There is nothing infra dig. in handling a spade, and in
erecting their own butts there is nothing to cause Riflemen
to make butts of themselves for outsiders to laugh at.
However high may be their standing in society, they need
not fear that doing useful handiwork will lower it; and as
for any jokes that may be cracked at their expense, the
cracking of their rifles will be quite enough to drown them.
Indeed, seeing what expense their butt-making has saved
them, they can well afford to run the risk of being laughed at.
But there is little chance of ridicule for such good pluck
and perseverance as that by which the Deptford corps have
won our thanks, and kudos... We say our “thanks,” for
every one who lends his aid to strengthen our national
defences, deserves the thanks of every one who wants to
be defended by them. As the father of a family, in their
name, we therefore thank the Deptford Volunteers for the
practice ground which they so pluckily have made; and
we hope next year at Wimbledon they will show us that
their practice has made them pretty perfect.
The Head of his Race.
At the boat-races at Ottawa, before the PRINCE or
WALEs, the great race was won by an Indian, who shot

º: and of both of these good qualities
s orps have
s displayed them more than others; and a laudable example of what ma
ieved in the pursuit of Rifle practice under no slight difficulties is afforde
far a-head of all his competitors. This gives a flat con-
tradiction to the assertion, that the Indians as a race are
fast going out. However, in the present instance, it was no
great wonder that the Indian proved the winner, for as his
canoe was made of birch, it was pretty sure to flog allothers.
CRINOLINE AND CIVILISATION.
“OH, Mr. Punch / I am so enchanted! What do you think that
darling PRINCE OF WALEs has discovered? At least it wasn't he
exactly, but the Times Correspondent; only of course you know if the
frince hadn't gone there, the Correspondent would not either, and so
the discovery might never have been made, or at any rate not so soon,
and, if it had, perhaps the Times might not have had its Correspondent
there, and then of course the public would have heard nothing about
it. §utiºn keeping you, poor man! from the account of the discovery.
Here it is then, word for word as it was printed in the paper, I got m
little sister JULIA to copy it, for Miss SMITH (she's our governess
was gone to see her Aunt, at least she says it’s her Aunt, but I say it’s
her Cousin, because I know that he’s at home now, and he's got Oh!
such nice hair, and such a lovel º moustache, at least so Miss
SMITH tells me, and so you see I had to hear the children say their
lessons; and JULIA, Oh! she was such a naughty child, she would insist
on saying ‘c A T’ spelt 'dog,' and in declaring that twice twelve was
a hundred and twenty-four ! and in protesting that New York was a
lake in Mesopotamia / And so for punishment I made her copy out
this extract, and you needn't be afraid to print it from her writing,
because I read it over afterwards and made the spelling right, and put
the proper stops. . You know the Correspondent is describing the
Royal tour through Upper Canada, and between two villages calle
Almonte and Arapsin-they have the queerest names for places in
America!—he says:—
“The track was partly through the forest, over what is called a corduroy road, a
Colonial synonyme for no road at all, a kind of track where the natural inequalities
of the ground are developed to their utmost by a profuse intermixture of pine logs.
The route at this part lay through a perfectly wild country. Only a log cabin broke
the monotony of the forest here and there, with a group of ragged brown girls and
boys clustered on pine logs to cheer the Prince. The despotism of fashion, however,
has penetrated into the remotest recesses of these backwoods, for however ragged
may be the female members of a Settler's family, I never saw any who did not wear
the most monstrous wooden hoops under their petticoats.”
“There, Mr. Punch l, Now, what do you *y to that, Sir? Wide
petticoats are worn in the backwood, of America / Isn’t that an inte-
resting discovery to make! And how glad I am to think the Prince—
d|sure you must admire the heroism—or should
dear darling fellow, how I should like to waltz with him—should be
the man to make it! One feels really almost reconciled to losing him so
long, when one hears of what intelligence his absence is productive.
How charming it is to think that wherever women go, Crinoline goes
with them; and that no matter what a nuisance and a trouble it must
be to them, they will persist in wearing it despite of every obstacle.
Of course it must be a great bother to walk in a wide, petticoat in
places like the backwoods, at least if they’re at all like whit my fancy
paints them. Why, even in Kew Gardens there are walks which are
so narrow one can scarcely squeeze one's hoops through them, and I’m
sure in Richmond Park there are heaps and heaps of places where one
finds one's Crinoline immensely inconvenient. As for Burnham Beeches,
really there are walks there which are quite impassable if one goes in a
wide dress. The last picnic that, I went to, I 8. so entangled, I do
believe indeed that I should never haveF. out if Cousin ChañLEY, who
was with me, hadn't had a penknife, and so by main force extricated me.
He said I was as difficult to clear as the Great Eastern, and I’m sure
it took him such a time to cut me out, that Mamma grew really anarious
and would insist on sending off that horrid MR. QUIzzINGTON to see
what had become of me !
“Well, if Crinoline is so inconvenient in England, what must it be
in places like the forests of America!. and how brave it is in girls to
go through the bore of wearing it! Much as you hate Crinoline I’m
call it sheroism?—of
those who make such martyrs of themselves by using it. And surely
you will cease, Sir, from your horrible attacks on it, now you are con-
vinced, as I’m sure you ought to be, that they are futile to arrest its
world pervading course, and that wherever we may trace the adyance
of civilisation, there will the march of Orinoline infallibly be manifest.
“I remain, Sir, in the fashion

CHAPTER XXXI. THE LADIES, BLESS THEM AND THE
REIGNS OF HENRY THE FOURTH AND HENRY THE FIFTH.
EpoRE we leave the
Ladies of the four-
teenth cent
in our last Chapter we
gave a full-length pic-
ture, we may just re-
mind the reader that in
the twenty-second year
of thereign of Edward
THEThird was founded
the most noble Order of
the Garter. How the
order is by some people
supposed to have had
origin in the drop-
ping of a garter by a
Countess of Sailis-
BURY, and the handing
of it back to her by the
King who picked it up,
with the memorable
saying, “Honi soit qui
mal y /* we
scarcely should have
taken the labour to re-
peat, were it not to
add, that the story is
one of those which are
too good to be true,
and we must therefore
- - - - - - - - warn our readers not
to put their faith in it. Seeing that we have always believed the tale
ourselves (as we have the story about Romulus and REMUs being
suckled by a wolf, and a hundred other anecdotes that history has
handed to us) it causes us a cruel pang to have to say there is no
truth in it; but as a living author tells us that “all writers of any
credit combine to reject the popu-
lar tradition,” we cannot for our
credit’s sake do otherwise than
join them.
We noticed that wide hats were
worn about this period, and that
Chaucer's Wife of Bath, whose
hat was “as broad as a targe,” in
this respect bore likeness to Miss
JEMIMA Jones, whom we saw two
seasons since (before the Spanish
hat came into vogue) ambling on
her donkey along the sands at
Broadstairs. To this we ought to
add that also showing a resem-
blance to certain recent fashions is
the description Chaucer gives us
of the Carpenter his Wife; who
among herother finery was adorned
with a broad silken fillet round her
head, and to fasten her low collar
wore abrooch which was as big as
the boss of a buckler (!) We learn
too that her shoes were laced high
up on her legs, a description that
ust tallies with the modern “high-
ows,” which now that they are
called by a less vulgar appellation,
may be daily seen on hundreds of Lady or Raº tº ºn tº
fashionable feet. sºconio. *... M-N- -º-o-
Gloves are shown in many of the -
drawings of this period, but whether they were worn more upon
the hands than in them is a question, which we leave to those who
like to guess at. In the old, illuminations we see them just as fre-
quently in one way as the other, and so wenay presume that ladies
who were too lazy (dare we say?) to put their gloves on, liked to
show, that they possessed them by carrying them in their hand.
Whether girls were wont then to bet gloves at the tournaments, which
they usually attended in gorgeous array,” is another of the problems
º
º
º
, of whom|F
we must leave to be decided by those who have more time and inclina-
tion for the task. But if they did, we rather question if the fair sex
were more fair in this respect than they are now, and we have lately
learnt that gentlemen have even been discovered so far North as
Doncaster, who have failed in their attempts to make young ladies pay
their bets.
We come now to the threshold of the fifteenth century, and the
costume of the º of KINg HENRY THE Fourth and that of his sad
scapegrace son, the friend of old Jack Falstaff, KING HENRY THE
ifth. We have not seen it ourselves; but from all that we read of
it, we think the effigy of HENRY pere is one of the most splendid in
aſ our regal series; and we strongly advise readers who have nothing
else to do, and cannot enjoy a holiday unless they have some excuse for
it, to ascertain in what cathedral the tomb is to be seen, and to spend
a pleasant day or two in going to inspect it. In doing so we ma
advise them to pay the most particular attention to the crown, whic
is probably an imitation of the famous “Harry crown” that was
broken into º by KING-BENRY THE FIFTH, and pawned in 1415
for wages to the Knights who served in the expedition against France."
We cannot say for certainty if this were the same crown of which the
poet ShakspeaRE makes King Henry say:-
“Heaven knows by what byepaths and crooked ways
I met this crown; and I myself know well
How troublesome it sat upon my head."
But judging from the look of it, we must º we incline to fancy that
it was. e know that for ourselves we should feel disposed to think
it something worse than “troublesome” to have to carry on our head
such a structure as this
crown; and torture as, we
think it to wear a modern
“chimney-pot,” we can
hardly bear to think of
the excruciating headaches
which such a crown as this
would infallibly inflict on
us. No one but a lunatic
would ever dream of wear-
ing such aheavy head-cover;
and the “madcap.” PRINCE
of Wales must indeed have
earned that epithet when he
ut his father's crown on
just to see if he looked well
in it.
Butlittlechange occurred
in civil Costumes at this
period, nor were there many
military novelties to speak
of. Gowns both long and
short were worn as upper
ſº both by high and
ow; and were made with
sweeping sleeves, indented
at the edges in the form of
leaves, or else with sleeves
called pokys, which as we
have shown depended from
the wrist, not unlike the
bags of bagpipes, and which doubtless, were found useful by police-
men of the period to conceal the legs of mutton which they
pouched upon their beats. Long tunics were likewise very gene-
rally worn, and the one seen on the effigy of King HENRY THE
Fourth has two pockets in the front, placed somewhat near the
sides, the slits whereof are perpendicular like those in modern
“pegtops.” This long tunic we learn was known by a long name,
being called a houppelandej, and as the word is derived from the
sº it does not seem unlikely that the garment came from Spain.
e are told that at the Coronation of King HENRY THE Fourth the
lordswore scarlet houppelandes, covered with long mantles; while the
Knights and their Esquires were allowed to wear the houppelande, but
without the mantle. We likewise are informed that the day before the
ceremony, the King performed the feat of making six-and-thirty
knights; which we fancy must have been a rather expensive morning's
work, seeing that to each of them he gave a long green coat, with
straightsleeves furred with miniver, and having a large hood lined with
the same fur and fashioned like the hoods which were then worn by
the prelates. On the day when we are knighted (which we fully

expect will happen as soon as we have finished the Great Work we are
engaged upon), we trust this good old custom will be duly borne in
mind, and that a suit of the most fashionable clothing will be added to
the title with which we are rewarded, and by which a grateful nation
will indicate its thanks.
OMNIBUS REFORM.
Although for the present ousted from our Parliament, Reform is
very clearly the order of the day. Everyone seems bent upon reform-
ing everybody, and from tailors' bills to juvenile delinquents there is
nobody and . that escapes without attack. The very oldest
nuisances are daringly assailed, nor is a little finger lifted by the public
to protect them. Smithfield has been swept out, and so has the
Palace Court, and there are men who hope to live to see the Income-
Tax reformed, and an end of Temple, Bar, the toll-gates and, the tax-
gatherers. Where the mania will end it is impossible to say, but 'bus-
cads have been threatened and cabmen may come next, and when these
are both reformed what new wonders may be looked for?
To show we are not wrong in our announcement of this threat, and
to apprise the British Public that the Wild Busmen of London are not
far off extinction, we ... call attention to a stringent code of rules
which the General Qmnibus Company have recently been issuing, and
which if generally obeyed, will quite exterminate the savages who have
far too long been suffered to infest the public streets. These new
rules are intended for a new set of conductors whom the Company have
started on their Bank-to-Clapton route, where in future, we are told
“intelligent lads of sixteen or eighteen, having a good character and
dressed in a neat uniform,” will officiate in place of those beery shoot.
ing-coated and slouch-hatted individuals, by whom the rider in an
omnibus has usually been served. The plan, it seems, is copied from
that which is adopted by the Telegraphic Companies; from whose
ranks of nimble Mercuries, as from time to time they grow too old for
that service, the footboards of the Ömnibuses will in part be filled.
This we cannot but regard as a promising arrangement; for a lad who
has been trained to run about with, telegrams will not be likely to like
crawling along at a snail's pace as 'bus-cads are in general prone to let
their drivers do.
Something more, however, than mere bodily activity is required for
the service. Aspirants must to some extent have cultivated minds,
and to render themselves eligible must have undergone such schooling |b
as will enable them to “perform any ordinary sums of addition, sub-
traction, and multiplication of money”. This, we can't help thinking,
is a highly useful rule: for whenever hitherto we have been cheated in
our change, and have received but fivepence halfpenny as the difference
between the shilling which we tendered and the fare of fourpence |d
which we had to pay, we have often in our charity attributed the fraud
to an ignorance of mathematics on the part of the conductor, whose
defective education we have inwardly deplored. -
fi º: other rules laid down for his guidance and protection, we
nd unai,”
“A conductor must not enter a public-house during his hours of duty, under
pain of immediate dismissal and forfeiture of any wages that may be due to him."
This, although a highly salutary law, we fancy must admit of some
slight mitigation; Unless conductors are to eat their dinners, upon
doorsteps, it is obvious the rule must daily be relaxed. We do not
think it would enhance the beauty of our 'buses to see conductors on
their footboards with a pork pie in their hands, or a hunch of bread
and cheese, or a slice of a polony, and taking surreptitious swigs from
a flat bottle. But as even a conductor to an omnibus must eat, to
some such steps as these will our bus.cads be reduced, if entrance to
a public-house for dinner be denied them. If, when serving as most
do at a distance from their homes, they are not to be allowed to enter
a refreshment place, they will have to be continually taking bits and
scraps, and doubtless will be forced to answer questions with their
º: full, and perhaps to wet their whistle when they want to
OW lit.
But the mandates we have quoted are comparatively mild compared
with others which are issued, and which we here subjoin. During
each journey, each conductor is told on pain of death, or at any rate
dismissal, that—
“He must direct the driver where to go, and where to stop during the journey.
He must see that the omnibus works to its appointed time, and report to the road
inspector the cause of any irregularity in that respect. While on the journey he
must stand on his footboard, with his back to the omnibus; but in letting passen-
#. in and out, he must descend and assist them. He must if possible set passengers
own at the kerb stone on either side of the road desired. If more passengers desire
to ride than he has room for, he who first hails the omnibus must have the prece-
dence. Before giving the signal for starting, he must see that passengers are
seated, or that they have firm hold of the upright bar in the interior. He must not
slam the door, strike the panel, or kick the footboard, as a signal to the driver, but
must call or blow a whistle. He must prevent pas ers getting in or out, on or
off, the omnibus while in motion. He must be civil ...; obliging to passengers in
all things. . He Inust not leave the omnibus while on his journey, except to assist a
passenger to or from the pavement. He must not ride inside the omnibus. He
must not smoke nor stop to drink during the journey. Persons in dirty dress or
otherwise fairly objectionable, or in a state of intoxication, must not be admitted
into the omnibus. No person must ride on the step of the omnibus. Dogs must
not be admitted into the omnibus, except small dogs carried in the hand, and then
only with the consent of all passengers. Packages of meat, or fish, or bulky or
offensive packages of any kind, must not be allowed inside the omnibus.”
If conductors observe duly this their º to their Neighbour, we
shall hear no more of stoppages to “wash the osses' mouths out;” of
nervous persons being set down in the middle of the street; or of
unprotected females being carried off to Bayswater upºn the plea that
it’s within a “heasy walk” of Brixton, e word 'bus-cad will die
out, and the micer term of 'bus-lad be allowed to take its place. Lads
who know how to conduct themselves, may wondrously reform the
conducting of the omnibuses. There will no more be slams of doors, or
shovelling in of feeble passengers, or starting off so suddenly that they
are thrown in others' laps, or have to lay hold of the nearest noses to
support themselves. Band-boxes and lap-dogs, and other feminine
encumbrances, will no longer be allowed to annoy the public's knees,
and the public's toes and corns will be most carefully respected. We
even live in º that the days of the admission of Crinoline are
numbered. So Eutopian, in fact, is the state of things in prospect,
that we thoroughly expect it will be possible ere long to get into an
omnibus without having to run for it, and without finding a baby or a
wet umbrella in it.
JANUARIUS AND GAVAZZL.
To SIR George Bowy ER, M.P.
My DEAR Bowyer,
You will have seen that FATHER GAVAzzi has been preachin
in the Cathedral at Naples. Fancy that! The sarcrosanct edifice di
not fall down upon him. Would you have thought it? Nay, GAVAZZI
º: in the pulpit, and, what is more, his prediction was fulfilled.
e said that SAN GENNARo's blood would lique y on the º: day,
notwithstanding the presence of GARIBALDI. The blood did º so
unctually as nine o'clock in the morning, like butter on a hot roll at
§. a natural phenomenon which no doubt occurred in many
instances about the same hour with the miracle. It is clear, therefore,
that GENNARo is no more a humbug than GAvAzzı. . If the former is a
true saint, the latter is also a veritable prophet; but what a testimony
the saint and the prophet combine in bearing to the cause of GARIBALDI
and Victor EMMANUEL! How can the King and the Dictator be
supposed to have been excommunicated?. Of course they have not
een. Infallibility could not err. His Holiness named no names in
the bull consigning to perdition, some person or persons unknown,
which he caused to be stuck on the walls. The spiritual pretensions
of the Holy Father are thus triumphantly saved; but don't you think
now that he appears to be placed in a dilemma wherein he had better
raw in his temporal horns? ANTONELLI may say what he likes; but
you will doubtless agree with your condisciple in apple sauce.

CENTS AND NONSENSE.
The Elections in America are principally carried on by a process
called “stumping.” Paid orators scour the country, and address the
multitude, who dearly love a speech, from the stump of a tree. . Hence
the term, º orator.” However, there is also another form of
stumping it. All the officials in the pay of the Government have been
called upon by the Democratic clubs to pay a subscription, the minimum
of which is to be not less than £10, towards the expenses of the election
of their Candidate. As their retention of office depends upon the
return of the Democrat candidate, the subscriptions, must be paid, or
else the million and a half of employés (they are either more or else)
must politely walk out to allow another million and a half quietly to
walk in. The application is tantamount to a demand, “Your money
or your seat.” This method of coming down with the stumpy is by
no means so popular as the first. Your stump orator attracts men far
and near to listen to him; but your stump tax-gatherer, who calls upon
the poor clerk to stump up, has the peculiar effect of making all those
he addresses himself to run in the opposite direction.
The Cup of Misery.
We read in the Italian correspondence the following distressing fact:-
“There has been an insurrection in Todi.”
We suppose such an insurrection was stirred up with a spoon? We
should recommend that an Irishman or a Scotchman be sent over to
uell this insurrection, for they're the boys for putting down Todi
Toddy).

A LAMENTATION AND A PROPHECY.
As if the fall of the year needed a climax to its sadness, there came
last week a mournful invitation from the º Palace, to hear the
“Last Farewell” of the clear-toned CLARA Novello. Obeying the
behest, Mr. Punch went, and heard, and—for the thousandth time—
was conquered. But so strong was she in voice that Mr. Punch could
not believe that he was hearing the last strains of his favourite swan-
like songstress. , Mr. Punch could not, help thinking, with doubtless
hundreds of her hearers.--Can she “retire” her notes, as people say in
Lombard Street? Will JoHN BULL so prematurely submit to such a
loss? For even, if MR. GLApston E, should next year double the
Income-Tax, the deed will tend but little to console us for our CLARA.
How could she so composedly behold that sea of lovely bonnets, if she
had made her mind up never once more to confront them? While her
seraphic tones were floating, like the rustling of angel-wings, round
about her audience, could she bear to let them go home to their
mundane occupations without the hope of hearing such a heavenly
voice on earth again?
. No!. Forbidit, BENEDICT! No!, Forbid it, Bowley. Mr. Punch
is (by himself) now fully authorised to state, that CLARA has not left
him. How could she exist, with all that gush of song, in the bosom of
retirement? It must well forth somewhere, that is clear as Cheapside
mud; and such a flood of liquid melody as GLARA can pour forth
would be com º overwhelming in any private hearing-place.
Therefore, speaking for the ; of the greatest number,
iſ. Finch elights to state that the flood-gates are not closed yet
finally and for ever. With his mantle of prophecy consolingly ..
round him, Mr. Punch, without much fear, will wager ten to one that
ere the Twentieth of November (who will bet "the bet will not be
won on the Nineteenth?) the echoes of a concert-room within cab-range
§ Fleet Street will once more be awakened by the clear voice of our
LARA.
A DEVILISH BAD PRACTICE.
IN an article upon cotton, and the
need there is of growing it in India
and Australia, as well as in America,
a contemporary fitly calls attention to
the fact that—
“A º has had to go to America,
to see whether a stop cannot be put to the
adulteration of cotton bales, which are apt to
consist of sand and rubbish to the extent of
thirty per cent. ; , to say nothing of the
hideous fact that lucifer matches are some-
#. lºsed in the most dangerous part of
e bale.'
With due respect to our contem-
É. , we really think this latter

not one “to say nothing of.” To
adulterate with rubbish to the extent
of thirty per cent. is evil work enough;
but surely it is work, fit only for the

|NEWS FOR ACTORS AND ACTRESSES.
MR. Punch is delighted to find, that such of the Managers of
Country Theatres as protest against being prevented from, using the
Works of Dramatic Authors without paying for such use, have come
to the noble determination of carrying out the principle which the
Managers consider involved in the question.
As regards the plays, the Managers say that the Author who pro-
duces his play in London is paid for it by the London, Manager, and
therefore ought to have no further remuneration, and his work ought
to be free for the use and advantage of the Country Manager.
The Managers, being convinced of the justice of this view, intend to
apply it to the case of Actors and Actresses who have appeared in
London. Having been paid by the London theatre for their trouble in
acquiring their art, these performers ought to make no claim upon the
provincial Manager, but ought to be glad that “a mere intellectual
effort which has been adequately rewarded,” should contribute to the
support of so noble an institution as the British Drama.
n future, therefore, Ladies and Gentlemen º by the Managers
alluded to will understand that they will be placed on the footing of
the Author, and will be paid only for “intellectual efforts” º
designed for the theatres, in question. Travelling, expenses will,
however, be allowed. A List of these Managers may be had from the
Dramatic Authors' Society, or from their Solicitor.
Francis Himself Again
Though the KING or NAPLEs is at present without a kingdom, still
he cannot refrain, so strong has the habit become a part of his nature,
from condemning his subjects, even at the very moment that he is left
without any subjects to condemn. The following is the sentence he
has }: upon them:—“The conduct of the Neapolitans is positively
revolting.”

SPIRITUAL HAT-MOWING.
THERE are no good lies in the Spiritual Magazine of this month; for
the stories about the “DAVENPORT Boys” copied from a Yankee organ
of Spiritualism, called the Herald of Progress, are as silly as they are
false, and evince merely a stupid effrontery and an idiotic indifference
to truth. From the notices "To Readers and Correspondents” the
subjoined extract shall jº. the advantage it can derive from quo-
tation in these columns. Hat-moving is a spiritual phenomenon, as
well as table-moving, and as the hat ºthe Spiritual Magazine is going

We have no wish to impede the success of the Spiritual Magazine
considered as a commercial undertaking; nay, we will go so far as to
express, the hope that we may not damage any pecuniary interests
which the Editor of that journal, or other parties connected with it,

The Ladies' Fashionable Siphonia.
In consequence of the recent wet weather many sensible ladies have
taken to wearing their Crinoline outside of their walking dresses, in the
form of a framework of gutta-percha tubes, serving the same purpose
as the pipes which conduct the rain-water from the roofs of houses.
The dress which is worn over Crinoline extends to such a circumference
than an umbrella affords it no adequate protection, saving nothing but
the bonnet, so that it can only be defended from the showers a
system of drainage, which is managed by an arrangement of Crinoline
combining utility with elegance.
ADVENTURE WITH ECONOMY.:

“As the taste for Alpine climbing is a very expensive
one, particularly to that parent of juvenile tourists who is ironically
called “the Governor, allow me to suggest a means whereby the same
amusement, essentially, may be º: in this Metropolis, at the
small cost of 3d. Let the railing be removed from the spiral staircase
in the interior of the Monument, and let the cage alsº, which encloses
the top of it, be taken away. The wind is generally very high up

jostling each other in their way up and down, the peril of i.;

of the question, and might also be hazarded on a Saturday half-holiday
by adventurous young men who now, at no season of the year, can
afford an excursion to any mountainous district more dangerous than
that of Hampstead.
“If the Monument, the Duke of York's Column, and all such

FRENCH COOKS AND ENGLISH EATERS.
=N Michaelmas Goose-day, dear Punch, happen:

I dined with a City, Company—I will not make
the others envious by specifying which. Being
= of a reflective and a contemplative mind, Iown
I found the dinner a most gratifying repast. I
shall not soon forget the gurgle of enjoyment
with which old Guttleton, sucked down his
second plate of turtle; having, to secure the
possession of that luxury, it seemed to me made
somewhat of a gallop with the first. A younger
man, Iown, I wished I had a similar digestive
apparatus, and no more apprehension of the
evils of good things. Judging from the way in

LAMORICIERE'S WOW, OR HE
WOULD BE AN ALWA.
HE would be an Alva, vowed and sware
The red-hot LAMoRicièRE;
Through him, the papacy restored
Should be, with wasting fire and sword.
The towns which spurned the Pontiff's sway
Should be his mercenaries' prey;
He’d turn his rufians loose, to kill, -
Burn, spoil, and work their bestial will.
But ere he went on this crusade, .
The Frenchman sought celestial aid;
Thus, kneeling at Loretto's shrine,
Invoked the female form divine:
“O spotless Queen! Celestial Rose !
I end me thine aid to crush my foes;
Remembering that those foes are mine,
Because they are the Pope's and thine.
Adorable and most adored,
Behold this ornamental Sword;
Thine, if I conquer, it shall be:
Here will I hang it up to thee!”
Unheard was the Crusader's prayer,
Wholly by winds dispersed in air;
Because, there’s too much ground to fear,
Though dolls have ears, they cannot hear.
Our Hero's doom was dire defeat,
As expeditious as complete;
His army driven from the field,
And he himself obliged to yield
Fulfil, though thou hast lost the game,
Thy vow, Crusader, all the same;
Thy deity of wax, stone, wood,
Thy prayer had granted, if it could.
The will is equal to the deed,
And merits no inferior meed;
So let thy sword, in spite of scorn,
The angel-shifted house adorn.
For, now that weapon's work is o'er,
Thou should'st resign it evermore:
Drawn against Freedom—drawn in vain-
Oh! never wear that Sword again,
THE POPE AS A LOGICIAN.
THE, Pope seems in a muddle in his mind
as well as his material, affairs. Here, for
instance, is a proof of his confusedness of
intellect, in an address he issued lately to a
regiment of French soldiers sent for his
protection:—
“Mark well, my dear sons, that the Church stands
in need of no man's help in support of her spiritual
sovereignty; for being therein directly protected and
enlightened by God, far from requiring the aid of the
powers of earth, it is she who upholds nations and
empires. But since it has pleased God, in the pre-
sent dispensation of his Providence, that for the free
exercise of her spiritual sovereignty she should also
possess temporal F. it is this latter power, my
very dear sons, that you are called to defend in its
integrity. Great and glorious mission 1"
To our thinking this is rather out-at-elbow
sort of reasoning, and is congruous in that
respect to what may be the temporal position
of the Pope. Indeed, it shows, the Holy
Father is quite clearly on his last legs in the
point at least of intellect, howeyer he may be
in more material possessions. If the Church,
as he affirms, be in her spiritual sovereignty,
“directly protected” by the Divine power,
this protection surely must extend as well to
her temporal possessions, which, His Holiness
alleges, it has pleased Heaven"to bestow on
her to secure her the free exercise of her
spiritual sway. º then, the Church is
independent of man's help, not less in her
material than in her spiritual sovereignty;
and if His Silliness the Pope be true to his
own logic, he will at once ask the French
army to withdraw, and beg of Irish friends
to make no more subscriptions for the secular
support of the pillars of their Church.

how it would come down on him, and pierce his

“But I did not take my pen up to talk to
you of GUTTLETON. It was the dinner, not the
diners, that I wished to say a word about. Of
course I need not tell you that although the day
was Gooseday, we ate something besides geese.
There was turtle I have said, and there were
turbot, eels, and cod, there were soles and there
were whitings, and though somewhat out of
season, there was not at all bad salmon. From
this account of the first course you may fancy
those which followed; although perhaps you
won't conceive that—albeit the day was the last
Saturday in September—we had. Pheasants

might justify his fancying that the Sovereign of

“Some dishes, it is true, may be such horrible concoctions that
nobody would dream of touching them if they were known by their
right names. Who would call for that “Batoinié,” which G. H. M.

and salt cucumbers’ were put down in the carte: Or who would ask a
Russian servant for a ‘Bitok,' if he saw before him a confession of the
fact that the dainty was composed of several chopped meats, mashed
into a mass with honey and stewed onions, vinegar and capers, and
surrounded with stoned olives, sliced lemons, and peas?. Moreover,
now and then the converse might occur; and one might miss a dainty
because of its fine name. I myself, the other day, very nearly lost a
taste of that same "Coq de Bruyère,’ because of the word ‘Gratin’
which was stupidly prefixed to it, and which, as I, conceived, meant
‘the burnt scrapings of a saucepan,’ a conception which my dictionary
afterwards confirmed.

At Coleshill, in Warwickshire, MR. NEwdEGATE entertained the
agriculturists by saying that-
“Protection was not dead; it was a principle of our nationality, and burned now
more brightly than ever."
No, it is not burning. MR. New DEGATE mistakes for a pure flame
what is merely the phosphorescence of a dead body, Poor Protection
has been buried now for years, and many a fruitful harvest since
ripened over its grave. It was but right that Protection should give
back to corn what in its lifetime it took from it. ...Why does §.
NEwdEGATE attempt to play the º of a resurrectionist? If Pro-
tection is still burning, it must look uncommonly like a gas-lamp that

SHAVING A SERIOUS THING.
The attention of Sabbatarians is earnestly called to the subjoined
copy of an advertisement:—
SHAYING a Breach of the Sabbath and a Hindrance to the Spread of
the Gospel. By 6EOAOTOX. M. A. Cantab. London. SAUNDERs & Orley.
Messrs. SAUNDERs & OTLEY publish many novels, but the serious
world need hardly fear that the work above announced is a novel.
There is, indeed, novelty in the idea that Shaving is a Breach of the
Sabbath; because every morning is not Saturday, and many people
shave every morning. Neither is every morning Sunday, if that is the
day which we are to suppose to be meant by the word Sabbath. True
it is, however, that some old clothesmen never, shave at all, for some
reason or other, which may possibly be the belief that Shaving, under
any circumstances, is a breach of the Jewish Sabbath. And certainly
there can be no doubt that shaving on a Sunday morning, or during
any portion of Sunday, is a desecration of the Sabbath just as flagrant
as that of travelling by an excursion train; for it is by no means
necessary: and this is probably the truth which the author of the work
under consideration, but which, like many other reviewers, we have
never read, most probably wishes to impress on the serious public.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 147
THE BATTLE OF THE REGISTRATION COURTS.
ENJAMIN BUFFLEs, Esq., the
Revising Barrister, for the
West-Eastern and South-
Northern Districts, yester-
day held his court at the
Mastodon Hotel, Mega-
therium Road, for the pur-
pose of going through the
electoral lists for the pa-
rishes of Choakley, Ditch-
ington, Bodger Hamlets,
Blokebury, and Gnasham.
MR. Jolliboy attended for
the Conservatives, and MR.
CHAFFERs for the Liberals.
The Choakley list was
first taken. -
The Revising Barrister asked what fool had made out such a list
as that.
Mr. GAPeseed, overseer of Choakley, stated that he was the party
inquired after by the learned barrister. - -
The Barrister asked him, whether he would like a presentation
to the Asylum for Idiots, as that was the best place for a man who
could lay such a document on the table of a court.
MR. GAPESEED asked where he was to lay it.
The Barrister instantly committed him for contempt of court, and
disfranchised the parish of Choakley. - -
Mr. GRUNTER, an elector of Choakley, submitted that it was
very hard that he should lose his vote because the overseer was an ass.
he Barrister said it served the Choakley electors right for electing
asses as overseers, and ordered MR. GRUNTER out of court.
The Ditchington list came next. - - -
Mr. Wibbiº was objected to by the Liberals. He claimed in
respect of a freehold house and grounds which had been in his family
for sixty years. The objection taken was that he had described the
house as a mansion-house. -
The Barrister. What do you call this a mansion-house for .
Mr. Wibble. I suppose I may call my house anything. I like...MR.
SquEERs says a man may call his house an island if he pleases. There
is no law against it. - - -
The Barrister. Then I'll make one. The Mansion-house is in the
City, and nowhere else. Do you mean to say you are the Lord
Mayor?
Mr. Wibble. Bless me, no, Sir. - - - -
The Barrister. How dare you swear in a court of justice, Sir? Leave
this place, Sir.
Name expunged. - -
MR. BUNKERBy was objected to % the Conservatives. He claimed
in respect of a house and shop in Poppleton Street. The objection
was that he did not live there.
The Barrister. Do you live there, Sir?
Mr. Bunkerby. Yes, Sir; and I dye there, also, Sir.
The Barrister. None of your ribaldry, Sir. What's your case, MR.
Jolliboy? - -
MR. JolliBoy said that MR. BUNKERBy did not sleep in the house,
and therefore it was not a residence.
The Barrister. You need not tell me that, MR. JoLLIBoy. I suppose
I know that if a man does not sleep in a house he does not reside there.
What do you mean by not sleeping in this house, MR. BUNKERBy *
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, as a respectable elderly man, for
not going home to bed. Where do you sleep—at the Mummums, or
under a dry arch of Ricketty Buildings? -
w: Bunkerby. I sleep generally at my other house in St. Peter's
0001.
The Barrister. Sleep generally, MR. JolliBoy, what does he mean
by that? I’ve heard of sleeping soundly, and sleeping heavily, and
sleeping lightly, but I never heard of a man's sleeping generally. Do
you ever sleep particularly, Sir.
Mr. Bunkerby. Yes, Sir, I sleep particularly well when I have been
reading any of your honour’s published works. (Laughter.)
The Barrister. Ha! ha! Not so bad. Well, GENERAL SLEEPER,
you may go to your military duties, as we shan’t trouble you to come
to the hustings.
Name expunged.
The next objection was by the overseers, and was made to the vote
of MR. PINDAR WAKEFIELD. It was alleged that the voter was dead.
MR. PINDAR WAKE FIELD attended, and begged to state that he
was not dead. -
The Barrister. You know I must have proof of that. What is the
use of an unsupported assertion? -
Mr. Wakefield. Would my punching the overseers' heads induce your
Honour to give consideration to the question whether I am alive or not?
The Barrister. I cannot, MR. WAKE FIELD, decide on a hypothetical
case; but if you were to do as you propose, I should be able to give you
an allSWer.
MR. WAKEFIELD, who was much excited at being described as dead,
here made a rush at the overseers, who fled out of Court, followed by
the avenging claimant of electoral rights.
Name retained.
The Bodger Hamlets list came next.
MR. Joli.Hoy took a preliminary objection to its being received.
The Barrister. I know nothing of Conservative or #. but I
suppose you have, found that there is a preponderance of claimants
whom you don't like over those you do, * so you are ready to sacri-
fice your own men in order to damage the other side.
Mr. Chaffers. You've hit it, Sir, by Jove.
The Barrister. And I’ll hit you, Sir, that is to say with the strong
arm of the Law, if you talk in that flippant manner. If you mean that
I have accurately indicated the animus of the objection, I know I have,
and need no information from you.
Mr. Jolliboy. Far, Sir, be such a paltry design from me, or from the
great, powerful, and respectable body I have the honour to act with.
But, Sir, the late SIR Robert PEEL nobly said that the battle of the
Constitution was to be fought in the Registration Courts. In the
interest of that Constitution, Sir, the envy of surrounding nations, and
the pride and glory of our own, I am here to protest, as emphatically
as my humble ability will permit, against the reception of that, dis-
graceful, despicable, and disgusting document. I ask you to look at
it, Sir, and I ask you if the British Constitution can be considered
safe in the hands of officials who-nay, Sir, look at it, and with your
own impartial eyes judge it—who have spelt Hamlets with two “t's.”
That, Sir, is my case, and I demand the rejection of the list.
The Barrister. It is so spelt, certainly. }. at it, MR. ChaffeRs.
. Mr. Chaffers (without looking at it). Indeed, Sir, you could not have
given me greater pleasure than by your assurance. I trust, indeed,
that it is so spelt. Had it been otherwise * would have been
my painful duty to ask you to reject the list. But the overseers of
this parish, Sir, however much they may be sneered at by the minions
of Toryism—
Mr. Jolliboy. Withdraw minions, or where would you like this ink-
stand? (Snatches it up.)
Mr. Chaffers. A Tory had better let ink alone—he always makes a
mess with it. But if the word annoys my friend, I will substitute
contemptible tools, and proceed to add that the overseers have stood
by the old spelling, that in use when HAMPDEN died on the scaffold,
and Sydney on the field, for the liberties of England; and that the
list is made out in accordance with the Constitution, with tradition,
with prescription, and with precedent. - -
The Barrister. This is a very important and difficult question. Will
you have a case for the Court of Queen's Bench, or will you sky a
copper which way it shall go?
Mr. Jolliboy. I’m º: to the copper.
Mr. Chaffers. Sudden death?
The Barrister (skies the coin and places his hand on it). Go it—who'll
cry?
Mr. Jolliboy. Woman!
The Barrister. 'Tis. Women are always for bad spelling. I refuse
to receive the list, and the overseers of the parish will go to the
Hº! Correction for three months with hard ºr. (Applause in
Tourt.
No case of interest arose subsequently, except that of, MR.
Lobkins, of Gnasham, who was objected to by both sides, and who
attended to support his claim.
The Barrister. You don’t seem a favourite, MR. Lobkins. What’s
the objection of MR. JolliBoy
Mr. Jolliboy. I see that we have made a little mistake, and that MR.
Lobkins is an excellent Conservative. I can only apologise to him
for the trouble we have given him. I hope that we have not incou-
venienced him much. -
Mr. Lobkins (savagely). No ; you’ve only ºf: me about six
hundred miles from the north of Scotland, where I was shooting. I
have just got out of the train.
Mr. Jolliboy. Really, though! Have we? I trust you had good
sport. How are the grouse? -
Mr. Lobkins. Wild, as I am at being dragged to town in October.
You'll see about that, next election. - - ---
Mr. Chaffers. Will a Liberal candidate be favoured with your intelli-
gent support on that occasion, MR. LoBKINs? -
Mr. Lobkins (emphatically). Yes, by George, he will, Sir! even if he
is as great a Pump as the sitting Member. -
Mr. Chaffers. In that case I have much º: in withdrawing my
objection, as I know your vote to be perfectly good, and I should be
very sorry to deprive you of a constitutional right.
Mr. Jolliboy. Stop, though. I am not so sure, on looking at my
paper— -
The Barrister. You shut up. You withdrew, and can't speak again.
Mr. Jolliboy. I would not think of it, Sir. I meant my Times.

regret to perceive that the house in virtue of which MR. Lobkins
claims was totally destroyed by fire at an early hour this morning—
Mr. Lobkins (astounded.) O, Blazes' (Rushes out of Court.)
The Barrister. Curious. Well, he can't vote for a house that does
not exist.
Name expunged.
The lists were signed, and delivered over, and the entire business
was completed, and the Barrister had left, when MR. JoLLIBoy, as he
put up his papers, remarked to his Clerk, that his own eyes were not so
good as they had been, and he saw, on second reading, that it was the
house next door, to M.R. LoBKINs that had been burned. However,
mistakes would happen, and he would have some lunch.
PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXXII.-PERIOD —THE REIGNS OF HENRY THE
FOURTH AND FIFTH.
- N an inventory taken at the
Eº death of HENRY THE FIFTH
º 4 º' there is mention of a “peti
º coat,” manufactured of red
| damask, and having open
U sleeves. But for this adden-
dum, one might have almost
thought the garment was the
one which is exclusively
confined to female use; did
not one remember that the
monarch was residing in
Paris when he died,” and
that the word “peti” was
doubtless put instead of
“petit,” by the French
valet de chambre who no
doubt made out the list.
We may therefore think this
petticoat was simply a small
coat, being perhaps so called
in distinction from a great
one. It was however not
at all uncommon at this
period to see small swells
attempting to make great
girls of themselves by wear-
ing clothes which looked
much more as though they
had been made by a milliner
than a tailor. In many of the figures represented in old manuscripts
the sex is to be scarcely distinguished by the dress; and as the gentle-
men, we find, very commonly wore gowns, it is not at all impossible
that petticoats were also º in their wardrobes. -
That men-servants dressed like women in the same way as their
masters, we have proof in some remarks made by the poet OccLEye,
which occur in one of the quaint poems he composed, concerning “y”
Pride and y” Waste-Clothing of Lordes Men: ”—

And something more, his sleeves up to hold."
In the reign of HENRY THE Fourth a decoration first appears, the
origin of which is differently accounted for. This is the collar of Esses,
which CAMDEN says was composed of a lot of letters S, that being the
initial of SANctUs SIMO SIMPLIcius, an eminent Roman lawyer, and
the collar he adds was chiefly worn by men of that profession. Qther
writers say that the collar had its origin in the initial letter of the
motto “Souveraine,” which KING HENRY THE Fourth bore when he
was EARL of DERby, and which, as he afterwards ascended to the
throne, appeared to have been auspicious, and to have brought him
great good luck. But whatever were its origin, it is certain that the
Collar was worn during his reign: and one old writer tells us that so
many titled fools were in his time distinguished by it, that instead of

calling, it the Collar of Esses, “y” common folke were wont to nick-
name it yº Collar of Asses.” A specimen of this, Collar may be seen
in an old drawing, which is in the Punch Collection, and which illus-
trates the anecdote of how the judge, SIR WILLIAM GAscoignE, was
struck in º Court by the madcap PRINCE of WALEs, for having
fined SIR John FALst AFF for wrenching of a door-knocker, and
having been found drunk and disorderly in the street.”
One of the chief features in the costume of the fourteenth and the
fifteenth centuries was the variety of fashion in the hoods which were
in use; as if, says MR. FAIRholt, “as if the ingenuity of fashionable
changes had been directed most to decorate the heads that had invented
them.” In the illuminated MSS. which may be viewed as the Books
of Fashion of the period, we see all sorts of hoods and caps and other
kinds of head-cover; some of the first enveloping the shoulders and
the neck, and of the latter some like nightcaps, and some like our
modern wideawakes. These latter were worn mostly slung around the
neck, for infine weather the head was left in general uncovered, and the
luxury of an umbrella not having been invented, our forefathers when
it rained used first of all to throw their hoods over their heads, and
then for further shelter used to clap their caps a-top of them. One of
the oddest looking of all the hoods in use was made to cover the head
and shoulders, and to reach down to the elbow, having pointed ends
which peaked out from the head on either side. This hood is still on
view in a drawing in, the Romance of St. Graal and Lancelot, which
any one may see in the British Museum, if they only take the trouble
to go there and º for it. To save them this exertion our artist
has, however, made a copy of the picture, and they are at liberty to
test the faithfulness of his designs by comparing the original with the
sketch we here subjoin:—
This charming work of art, which was executed doubtless by one of
the most eminent domestic painters of the period, throws as much light
on the customs as the costumes then in vogue, and is therefore doubly
serviceable to the student of the time. For fear of misconception we
may as well just state, that it represents a countrywoman in the act of
churning, to whom a blind beggar is shown approaching to ask alms
carrying one of his (twelve) children in what looks something like, a
chemist's mortar at his back. Besides the
curious hoods worn by the beggar and his
baby, the observer is requested to observe
the careful way in which the girl (or
ndmother) has put her apron on to save
er dress from splashes, and has tied her
kerchief round her head and neck to shield
her from bronchitis, toothache, or sore-
throat. Notice also should be taken of the
manner in which her gown is pinned up at
the bottom, to show off her dark petticoat,
which is left visible beneath it; and the
eye of the observer should likewise be
especially directed to the dog, , who is
. towards her with the platter in
his mouth. This interesting creature
should command a close inspection, be-
cause it shows us the antiquity of this
mode of street-begging; and, indeed we
think the animal can hardly be regarded
without some sentimental feelings, for
when we view the tray or platter in his mouth we seem to see quite
clearly that the creature was an ancestor of our much lamented friend,
the famous Poor Dog Tray.
To show that swells were extant thenadays as much as they are
nowadays, we should note that in the fourth year of the reign of
HENRY THE Fourth it was thought needful to revive the sumptuary
laws which had been previously enacted; but we scarcely need observe
that such enactments almost always proved to be dead letters, and that
* We trust that we may note without giving offence to our friends across the
Channel, that after the battle of Agincourt KING HENRY THE FIFTH caused himself
to be elected heir to the French crown: and that having espoused the PRINcess
CATHERINE, daughter of KING CHARLEs, of France, he fixed his residence at Paris,
and lived there till he died. By the treaty it was provided that France and England
should, in future, for ever be united under the same King, but should still retain
their respective laws and privileges; including of course the privilege of picking
quarrels with each other whenever anything, or nothing, might set them by the ears.

to revive them was in general a useless and unprofitable attempt.
Among other regulations, it was now provided that nobody but ban-
merets or men of high estate should wear cloth of gold, of crimson, or
of yelvet, nor should they use the fur of ermine, of marten, or of
lettice," nor wear long hanging sleeves, or gowns which touched the
ground. Four years afterwards it was ordained that no man, of what-
ever rank or wealth, should wear a gown or other garment that was
cut or slashed in pieces in the form of leaves or letters, under the
penalty of forfeiting the same; and it was ordered that the tailors
employed by such offenders should in future be imprisoned “during
the king's pleasure” for abetting the offence, Should any sumptuary
laws be enacted in our time, we trust that this wise hint will not be

THE A. B. C. OF SPIRITUALISM.
It is a pity that the Spiritualists (at least for their own sake it is)
are not more reserved in the statements which they publish. The
might have many more disciples—or shall we call them dupes?—if
they did not themselves take such pains to repel them. But a
Spiritualist seldom shows his hand on paper without making clearly
manifest his mental imbecility; and the natural result of this unlucky
* is, that nobody but fools will condescend to listen
O-Illin.
. To show what simpletons have lately assumed the name of Spiritual-
ists, we beg to call attention to a little book which has been written by
a certain DR CHILD, for the instruction of the children of the Spiritual-
ist faith. This “A. B. CHILD, M.D.,” we learn, is one of the bright
stars whose radiance illumines the Banner of Light, a Yankee Spiritual-
ist paper which is said to have subscribers, and we presume i.
readers, in our own enlightened country. What a shining light is
CHILD, and how much good must be done to the Spiritualist cause by
the general diffusion of his literary beams, may º be somewhat
judged from this brief extract from his book:-
“What is a Lir: *—A Lie is true to the cause that produced it; so what we call
a lie is a truth that exists in nature, just as real as is what we call a truth. The
cause of a lie exists in nature, the cause of a truth exists in nature, and the effect of
each cause is wrought out in nature. Nature is always true in her work; so both a
truth and what we call alie are lawful and right in the great plan of existence. A
lie is a truth intrinsically; it holds a lawful place in creation; it is a necessity.”
This extremely proper doctrine is very ſilly promulgated under such
a heading as ‘Hºtever is, is Right,” which DR CHILD has chosen for
the title of his book. We look upon it as a highly useful statement,
as it micely lets the cat out of the Spiritualist bag, and by affirming
that a liar is a natural necessity, it shows us the professors of that
faith in their true light. If in the ethics of the Spiritualists a truth,
and "what we call a lie,” are in the great plan of existence alike
“lawful and right,” of course no Spiritualist would shrink from
trickery and fraud in order to encourage a belief in his false faith.
But there are far worse º than lying, which, according to this
CHILD, a person may at times be spirit-moved to do. Prefacing his
dictum by saying that “no commandment, either written or spoken,
ever yet had any influence upon the soul,” and that “there is no such
thing as Spiritual culture coming from the teachings of another,” the
Doctor next informs us that, in Spiritualist ethics, killing is no murder,
or rather that murder is no killing of the soul; thus flatly contradicting
the Scriptural assertion which tells us that “the soul which sinneth,
it shall die:”—
"Murder has no influence upon the soul: it is a thing of the material world in its
influence. It has no influence upon spiritual existence, of which it is an effect. When
the murderer kills his brother, he strikes a blow that will paralyse every love of his
own earthly existence. Then the affections of his soul must cling to something;
and if his love of earth becomes broken by the awful deed of murder, and the con-
sequent punishment that he meets, spiritual things are next grasped, and perhaps
sooner grasped for the commission of the deed. The murderer does his dº in
darkness: he does not commit the deed with a view to advance the progress of his
soul. He is moved by an unseen and irresistible power to commit what seems to
us the “evil” deed. Every murder that ever was committed has been inevitable:
in th. bosom of nature has existence the lawful cause, of which murder has been the
We are informed that DR. CHILD at present lives at Boston (in the
Shires, not in the States). For Boston his residence may ere long be
changed to Bedlam, if he goes on writing such insane stuff as this.
Were it not in sooth for its obvious insanity, such a doctrine as the
Doctor's might entitle him quite fitly to a residence in Newgate, to
expiate his blasphemous contempt of God's commandments, and his
wickedness in framing an excuse, if not indeed an incentive, for a
crime.
The extracts we have given, and others we might give, had we not
more respect for our readers than the Doctor has, form part of what
he flippantly has termed his “All Right Doctrine.” He has been
tº to a belief in it not by reason or by teaching, but by simple
intuition, and by spirit-revelation. Reason ſe regards as “an effect of
the soul that is allied to material º and with the material
things of earth will sometimes give P ace to the higher development of
intuition.” Truth, he deigns to tellus, “is developed in the soul b
intuition always. The soul never did nor never can receive that whic
to itself is a truth, from external teachings, from the school-house or
the meeting-house.” And so we are informed that—
“Every real Spiritualist is a Spiritualist alone from intuition, not from external
evidence. Philosophy never made a Spiritualist, and never will.”
Really? Doctor! Well, we own you do astonish us. To think now
that philosophy will never make a Spiritualist! Whoever would have
thought it! And conceive too what a bold asserter is the Doctor,
when he sweepingly affirms that a Spiritualist has never once been
found among the learned ranks of the philosophers, from Plato even
down to Punch /
As we began by saying, it is a pity º themselves; for others we
incline to regard it as a benefit) that the Spiritualist writers do not
take more pains to be a little less discordant in their theories, and a
little more discreet in revealing what their spirits (whether mixed or
meat) may move them to let out. A writer in the current number of
the Spiritual Magazine grandly talks of Spiritualism as “an all-powerful
influence, which possesses the power to raise man, body, mind and
soul, to a higher position even whilst on earth, than poet ever con-
ceived, or any but a prophet ever hinted at.” How far this description
agrees with the “All Right Doctrine,” which DR. A. B. Chrºp puts
forth to us as being | we may make this use of his initials) the
A. B. C. of the Spiritualist faith, we leave to readers not so childish as
the Doctor to decide. To our thinking the gallows is the only “high
position” that is likely to be reached by a believer in a doctrine which
excuses murder, justifies a lie, and would shut up as useless our
churches and our schools.

AESOP'S SELECT FABLES.
THE SEA-NYMPH AND THE OCEAN SWELL.
ONE morning, when there was a heavy Swell upon the sands, a gentle
Nymph walked forth, her blue eyes beaming with joy, her flowing
tresses crystallised with dew. The Swell, struck by her beauty, and
solicitous to win her admiration, paused, and proudly shook his own
ong wavy curls. “Canst thou not spare, sweet Nymph,” he said,
“from that treasury of beauty one captive-making lock?”—“Where
would'st thou have a lock?”. quoth she, “not on thy understanding,
that's confined enough already.”—“Oh, cruel,” cried the crest-fallen
Swell, “thou knowest lain #, slave”: "I know thou art a surf,”
she answered, “and a most wicked flatterer, for while thou art kissing
the pale sands, thou art running of them down.”—“One lock of thine,”
returned the Swell, “would rivet my devotion, and banish all incon-
stancy.” The arch Nymph shook her laughing face, and said, “Oh,
restless Swell; how cans thou dream one lock of mine would make

said the slow Coach, stopping and regarding the little Duck with a
dreary smile, “when I can get a licence, you shall go to market with
me.”—“Thank you,” returned the little Duck, proudly lifting up her

A Young Monkey, in the uniform of a Middy, sat at the mess-table
(H. M. S. Dandelion) gazing admiringly at an ugly mug belonging to
the First Lieutenant. “What are you thinking of, MR. Sly P" demanded
the ugly Mug.--"Of my Sister, Sir,” replied the young Monkey, with
becoming humility.—"Your Sister!” returned the ugly Mug, grimly,
“is she pretty?”—“She is considered so, Sir,” replied the young
Monkey; “I had a letter from her this morning.”—“Indeed, and
what does she say?” inquired the Mug, pushing a bottle of Çº
Madeira towards the young Monkey.—“She says, Sir,” rejoined the
latter, “that she would be exceedingly pl sed if I would send her

with vanity, “Fill your glass, MR. Sly, and I think you wanted, leave

certainly a marked increase

tary equipment. The swell
knights of the day wore
around their bascinet a rich
wreath or band; and the
border of their jupon was
still elegantly cut into the
form of foliage, notwith-
standing the provisions of
the sumptuary statutes.
With regard to this quaint
fashion of cutting borders
into leaves, one of the old

tailors “first did take
French leave to take it from the French ; ” but it is a matter of
some doubt to us, whether this remark was based on actual truth, or
was merely made for the small pun which it involved. Somewhat
uestionable likewise to our mind seems the story of how when KING
NRY THE Fourth was asked, if his jupon should be bordered with
an oakleaf or an ashleaf, he replied, “I had as lief, to leave it to the
imaº to indent which leaf he'liketh; for if he trieth to make an oak.

Since the time of Edward The THIRD civilians had not seldom worn
feathers in their caps; but, excepting as heraldic crests, plumes had
not been sported by knights until this period. In the reign of HENRY
THE FIFTH we first find them adopted as military ornaments; and the
either were stuck upright on the helmet or the bascinet (in whic
event the plume was called, correctly, a “panache”), or, at a later
time, were worn at the side, or falling backward, when the proper term
to apply to them was “plume.” We mention this distinction just to
show our readers how minutely accurate we can be if we choose; but
as these minute descriptions are generally dull, we cannot let them
often intrude upon our space. -
The great crested helmet, called otherwise the heaume, was now
exclusively reserved for wearing at the tournament: as the bascinet
sufficed for ordinary purposes, shielding wearers from the blows of
weapons and of winds. This headpiece we described when it was
introduced (namely in the reigns of EdwańD THE FIRst and SEcond
and of course our careful readers must remember our description. Ali
that we need add to it is, that at this period its shape was slightly
changed, being curved behind so as to be more closely fitting to the
head. In this respect it bore resemblance to the salade, a kind of
German headpiece introduced in the next reign. We must, take care
not to mix this salade with the bascinet, because the two, although so
much alike, were really different; and as the salade was first used as
an article for dressing in the time of HENRY The Sixth, it would be
premature to say at present much about it. -
A fashion somewhat curious was that, of wearing with the armour
large loose hanging sleeves, made of cloth or silk or even richer sub-
stances. These in general were part of a kind of cloak, or surcoat,
thrown over the whole suit; but sometimes they are shown as though
they were detached, and were worn without the surcoat, being fastened
to the shoulder, and falling to the wrist.
For further information º: the Fº equipment of this
eriod the reader will do well to read up what is said about it by

BR90KE, FAIRholt, PLANCHé, STRUTT, and some few dozen other
writers on the subject, whom we have no time now more closely to
consult. All that we can add in the way of illustration of the military
costume, is a copy of an ...ºf picture we possess, representing
Sir John Falstaff as he appeared when he was sent to grass by fiery
Hotspur, whom he fought so many hours with, as he said, “by Shrews-
bury clock.” The original picture (in point, at least of measurement) is
one of the very greatest works of art we are acquainted with; for the
figure of Sir John Falstaff, being painted of life size, occupies upon the
canvas about twenty-five square feet.

MILITARY Costume.
We come now to the period of King HENRY THE Sixth, regarding
which a trustworthy authority observes:–
“If any proof were wanting of the confusion and disorder of this unfortunate
monarch's reign, it might be drawn from the apparel of his people, which a i. to
have been a jumble of all the fashions of past ages with everything most º iculous
and extravagant that could be discovered at the moment. It were a vain task to
attempt a minute description or classification of the dresses of this period."
As vanity forms no part of our mental composition, we shall not try
our hand at this unprofitable task; but . content ourselves with
simply noticing a point or two which appear to our mind worthy of
attention.
Commencant par le bout, or more correctly par le boot—whether the
game of football was in vogue about this time is a question which
debating clubs, if they like, may argue; and if they incline to a decision
that it was, it remains for them to settle as to how the players played
at it—any one who looks at the preposterous long toes, in which, says
STRUTT, the dandies strutted in this reign, might with reason doubt if
active crural exercise were possible; and might think the art of kicking
became almost extinct.
So far as we can judge, too, the coverings for the head were quite as
queer and quaint-looking as those used for the feet. Of the horned
and heartshaped headdresses in fashion with the ladies, we shall speak
when we describe the feminine costume. But the men wore forms of
headcover nearly as fantastic, and the variety seems endless in the
caps* worn, by the chaps. Some wore them stuck erect, some bore
them cocked or slouched; and every size and shape appeared in vogue
at the same time, from the biggest of big bell-toppers, to the smallest
of small hats." We have hunted up some dozens of old drawings in
rare manuscripts, and in no two are the kinds of braincover alike.
Some hats are made peaked, as being thought perhaps piquant; and
while one dandy wears a | crown i. brigand's in a ballet, another
sports a structure not unlike a gothic pepper-castor, which pinnacle-
wise sticks up from the centre of the .# In short, we shall not
much exaggerate in stating that the caps or hats or “bonnets” of the
time whereof we are treating were every whit as odd and ugly as those
of our own day. Nearly every sort of wideawake in fashion now was
worn; except perhaps the species known as the “porkpie,” which it
was reserved for modern taste to introduce.
. As a good many of our readers are Knights of the Garter, it may
interest them to know that the robes of this Most Noble Order were

as we perhaps might now say,
hat and overcoat. No re-
striction was placed upon the
robes of royalty; and on
HENRY's hood and surcoat the
number that were broidered
was a hundred and seventy-
three. It seems rather odd to
number, but we learn from
AsHMoLE that the fact was
even so. We should certainly
have fancied that a hundred broidered garters was quite enough for
any single man to wear; and although the King was married, we think
he might have done without the extra seventy-three.
º and Lord Mayors and other men in offices were gorgeousl
arrayed in gowns made rather long and full, sometimes parti-coloured,
trimmed and lined with fur, and girdled round the waist. To keep
their learned heads warm, they wore hoods with a long tippet, or
streamer, hanging from them, whereby they were sometimes slung over
the shoulder. e read in an old chronicle, which is too badly spelt to
quote, that in the year 1432, when HENRY came to England after being
crowned the reigning King of France (how his reigning there was
stopped and how he had to mizzle, the recollection of the reader will
nºt need us to relate), the Lord Mayor of London rode to meet him at
Eltham, being arrayed in crimson velvet, and a ſº furred velvet hat,
j about his middle a splendid girdle of gold, and having a golden
baldrick fastened round his neck, and trailing down his back. His
three henchmen, or pages, we are told, “were in one suit of red,
spangled with silver;” while to add to the effect, the aldermen woré
scarlet gowns with purple hoods, and all the city commonalty white
5. and scarlet hoods, with divers cognisances embroidered on their
sleeves.

sion to Guildhall, were simply to array himself in crimson and in gold,

MARRIED TO MUSIC.
AN unusually comic “Marriage in High Life,” on Saturday last
week, took place, .#. the Morning Post, at another Temple of
Hymen than St. George's, Hanover Square. The superior classes are
now out of Town, and nothing is going on at the crack matrimonial
temple there but ordinary divine service. Edinburgh, not London,
comprised the site of the sacred edifice wherein these nuptial rites were
celebrated. The exalted couple were an Honourable of the harder sex
and an Earl's daughter of the softer. The report of these aristocratic
hymenaeals states that the bride “was conducted to the altar by her
guardian,” a Duke, and that—
“As the bride advanced to the altar, the organ played HANDEL's anthem, ‘Ex-
ceeding glad.'"
The bride ought to have been much obliged to the organ...Of course
the anthem it played was performed chiefly with a devotional view,
and not for a purpose analogous to that of a polka. Still, in advancing
# to an altar to be married before it, a young lady wants some .#.

rather stronger than a smelling-bottle and the arm of her guardi
Common brides cry on these occasions, and sometimes faint. Nothing
can be better calculated to fortify the heart and sustain the spirits of
anybody, in the immediate prospect of marriage, than one of old
HANDEL's anthems—let it be even a funeral one; they are all so jolly.
Perhaps, however, “Happy We,”, from Acis and Galaţea, would have
been even more seasonable and suitable than “Ecceeding glad.” Oh!
say not that it would have been inappropriate to the sanctity of the
edifice and the solemnity of the occasion. For read on, and you will
arrive at the statement following:—
“The marriage ceremony was then performed by the Very Rev. E. B. RAMsay,
Dean of Edinburgh; and as the marriage party left the chapel, MENDELssohn's
“Wedding March” was played on the organ."
St. John's Chapel, Edinburgh, is indeed a Temple of Hymen. MEN-
DElssohn’s “Wedding March” is a movement in the secular direction
considerably a-head, we suppose, of anything in the way of musical
accompaniment to matrimony yet ventured on at St. George's, Hano-
ver Square. What would the Bishop say if he heard that a marriage
party had been played out of a London church with that jubilant compo-
sition—the gem of the music in the Midsummer Night's Dream & Per-
haps, that no tune in the world could have been more opportune; only
in the next similar case he would rather have it played just outside the
church door by a German band, or, with due respect to the high order
of the music and rank of the happy pair, by the orchestra of HER
MAJESTY's Theatre.
Should, however, the Bishop of LoNDoN not object to illustration
of the marriage service by dramatic music, the example set at St.
John's, Edinburgh, may be improved on at St. George's, Hanover
i. If the bridesmaids do not advance to the altar, they may at
all events retire from it to the celebrated chorus and waltz assigned to
their representatives in CARL MARIA voN WEBER's immortal opera.
MozART, in Le Nozze di Figaro, might also be laid under contribution
to supply harmonious embellishments for marriage in high life. Then
Rossini and the rest of the Italian school could be unlimitedly drawn
upon. MEYERBEER could furnish selections from Robert le Diable;
and there is no reason why Satanella should not be applied to the same
purpose, except that Satanella is an English opera. Could not the
whole matrimonial service be sung as well as said, responses and all;
a musical clerk officiating for a bridegroom without ear
But the worst of all this will be that the lower orders, aping their
betters, and at the same time actuated by their own inferior tastes, will
also want to get married to music. Is there not a song called “Come
let us all haste to the Wedding '" This is the kind of thing you would
have at St. Giles's if at St. George's you permitted “Giovinettiche fate.”
Then one thing would lead to another, and you would have couples in
the costermongery line advancing to the altar whilst the organ played
“Drops of Brandy,” and dancing out of church to the “Devil among
the Tailors.”
St. John's Chapel, Edinburgh, is of course an episcopal chapel, and it
is to be feared that the matrimonial music performed there, on the
auspicious occasion of a recent “ * in High Life,” will not, if
it should come to the ears of the Scottish public, induce the national
mind of Scotland to renounce its definition of a church organ as a
“kist fu o' whistles.”
Consolation for a Royal Culprit.
It has been rumoured that Mons. Victon Hugo is in Naples. It
might be an act of charity if the illustrious French author were to send
the King, who is kept a close prisoner at Gaeta, a copy of his well-
known work, “Les Derniers Jours d'un Condamné.”

HIGH LAND's seem to 'GREE WITH You won ERFLY—ANNOMISHTAKE.
PAPAL CREDIBILITY.
THE opening sentence of the Allocution lately pro-
nounced by the Pope contains one word which is very
remarkable. His Holiness thus commences:—
“Wenerable Brethren,—It is with incredible pain and profound
sorrow that we are forced to deplore and condemn new attacks,
unheard of till these days. committed by the Piedmontese Govern-
ment against us, the Holy See and the Catholic Church."
Incredible is the epithet of all possible adjectives which
the Pontiff chooses to apply to the emotions, which he
declares himself to feel. Does he, then, indeed not care,
and º: that nobody can believe that he really cares,
a baioccho about being relieved of his temporal power?
If so, why does the Holy Father persistin making assertions
which he knows can deceive nobody? Popes will be
Popes; but even a Pope might be content with the assertion
of that which is untrue. It is, as the common people
say, cutting it rather too fat to affirm a thing with the
distinct avowal that it is incredible. But no. In the
present instance there can be no doubt that the Pope
means what he says. There is every reason to suppose
that he does really feel very acute pain and exceedingly
deep sorrow at the prospect of losing his temporal authority:
His Holiness may assure himself that the world will
readily believe that all the suffering which he professes to
endure on that account is genuine and unaffected. He
does himself injustice in describing the pain with which his
paternal heart is affected at the idea of resigning his earthly
kingdom as incredible.
Historical Parallels.
CHARLEs the TENTH, when he was bundled out of
Paris, amused himself by shooting sparrows along the road.
FRANcis the Second, being summarily kicked out of
Naples, has been amusing himself at Gaéta by firing off
protests and protocols. . Both sports are equally harmless,
and we don't know which fall more dead, or which are more
worthless—the sparrows or the protocols?
TRUE. In the END.
Homoeopaths make this boast—that the Allopaths dis-
pense medicine, and they dispense with it. This may be
partially true, owing to their losing their patients so very
quickly.
BEDCANDLE PHILOSOPHY.
AMONG other household comforts, we see advertised some bedcandles
which are made “to burn half an hour only,” and which require “no
snuffing” and emit “no sparks.” It is obvious, we think, to any
ordinary intellect, that these candles are expressly constructed for
young ladies, and in especial for young ladies of a sentimental turn,
who nightly take a long time in “doing”, their hack-hair, and in
heaving up a sigh or two while thinking of the locks which they—
how willingly l-could spare for ARthur or AUGUSTUs, if ARTHUR or
AUGUstus would but breathe a wish to have them. Instead of getting
into bed at once and going off to sleep, there are many girls who
thus stupidly dawdle at their dressing-table, and spend half the night
or more in silly suspirations in the lieu of useful sleep. To check this
senseless habit, these half-hour-lasting hedcandles appear to be well
fitted, and no mother of a family of sentimental daughters ought to be
without them.
Another of their benefits is, that they are likewise eminently fitted to
put a stop to the dangerous and deleterious practice, so common
with young ladies, of reading trash in bed. . The stuff and nonsense
which is aunually emitted to the world through the economic medium
of the circulating libraries, we rather think is largely read between the
sheets, and keeps awake unhealthily the feeble minds whom it excites.
Girls who come down in the morning with dim eyes and pallid cheeks,
may safely be accused of being addicted to this practice; and to cure
them, we should recommend these half-hour-lasting candles, with one
of which they should be furnished every other night. In early life late
hours are extremely detrimental; and, being past that age ourselves,
we do not hesitate to say that children of eighteen or so, both mascu-
line and feminine, ought nightly to be sent to bed much sooner than
they are. Nothing (except, perhaps, a bad night and a headache) can
be gained by sitting up to sigh about one's lovers, or by lying down to
read the life of Laura the Lone One, or drop a tear upon the death of
the Doomed Dove of the Dell / If a bad night and a headache were the
only ill effects, one would not care so much perhaps to check these
baneful practices. But late hours, as we have said, occasion pallid
cheeks; and as wife-requiring bachelors look out generally for rosy
ones, the habits we complain of may tend to make young ladies hang
upon their fathers' hands; and therefore, for their parents' welfare and
their *. these half-hour burning bed-candles should be rigidly served
out to them.
THE NEXT DANCE,
YEs, dance with him, Lady, and bright as they are,
Believe us he's worthy those sunshiny smiles,
Wave o'er him the flag of the Stripe and the Star,
And gladden the heart of the Queen of the Isles.
We thank you for all that has welcomed him—most
For the sign of true love that you bear the Old Land:
Proud Heiress of all that his ancestor lost,
You restore it, in giving that warm, loving hand.
And we'll claim, too, the omen. Fate's looking askance,
And Fate, only, knows the next tune she will play,
But if John and his Cousin join hands for the Dance—
Bad luck to the parties who get in their way.
The Scarlet Scold.
“ Unjust, cruel, impious, detestable, hypocritical, impudent, sacri
legious, insolent, atrocious,” are specimens of the epithets applied
to Wictor º his Government, and his acts, in the Papal
Allocution; which is full of abusive language. His Holiness the
Pope calls himself the successor of the Fisherman. Hi
language,
however, smacks less of the Fisherman than of the Fishwife.

of the left-hand figure in
the last plate in Le Follet, the wretched weather which has nipped the
autumn flirtations so sadly, and the extreme stupidity of most of the new
novels, it was proposed that the Meeting should proceed to business.
The Chairwoman said that she wished somebody else had been put
into the Chair, for she had not the slightest idea of what was...wanted
of her, and she had really only come in to please her friend Mrs. DE
CRAPAUD, who had insisted on bringing her.
Amid cries of “O my dear,” “You really must,” “Her rank, you
know,” &c., MRs. BLAND was induced to retain her seat; . -
Mrs. Bland. Well, my dear creatures, it’s sadly unbusinesslike to
choose the very worst President you could find; but just as you please.
Now, MRs. NANGLEs, will you kindly state what we are here for.
Fido, darling dog, do lie down.
Mrs. Nangles. At last justice is done us, so far as mere words go.
At last, Women, Man, from his hall of council, has been compelled to
proclaim our superiority, , Hitherto, as every married lady present can
testify, we have only had to open our lips upon any political, legal, or
social topic of the day, to be apprised that we could not understand if,
that we did not know its various bearings, and that we had better con-
fine ourselves to our own proper spheres. Do you not hate the words
Proper Spheres, Ladies? (Wehement applause.) But I am happy to
say that we are not likely to be again exposed to such tyrannical imper-
tinence. A speaker at the Glasgow Congress declared, and the brutes
—men, I mean—around him gave in their long withheld adhesion to
the sentiment, that Law cannot be reformed unless We “take it in
hand,” and that “Ladies are the Best, Law-Reformers.” (Applause.)
Any admission being made, I need only ask you whether it would be
womanly not to take the fullest advantage of it? (Laughter and applause.)
I am answered; and I therefore propose that a Society be formed, to
be called the Ladies' Law Reform Association, and that we proceed to
“take in hand” the question of the Reforms which we shall demand
of the authorities. i. Meeting, of course, is only preliminary. We
have a wide field before us, and f hope that we s not imitate the
timid, niggling, bit-by-bit policy of men, but do the thing all at
once and thoroughly, as you would make your servant clean out a
r00m.
Mrs. Brompton. I hope a law will be passed directly to make cabmen
more honest and º I and my sister came on Thursday from
Apsley House to the Opera in the Haymarket, and the man wanted
eighteenpence. - -
Mrs. Bowbell. Is the new opera a nice one-Robin Hood, I mean *
Mrs. Brompton. O delightful—that is, for English music. You know
no Englishman can write any music like WERDI's. (General assent.)
However, it was a great success.
Mrs. Bowbell. Whose music is it P
Mrs. Brompton. Upon my word I didn't look, but I know somebody
said it was an Éziº opera.
Mrs. Bland. It is by MR. MACFARREN, an intensely clever man,
my dears, and a musician worth a dozen of WFRDI., And I assure you
that it is not the thing, now, to pretend to know nothing about English
people. Excuse the hint.
Mrs. De Crapaud (in ertacies). O, MRs. BLAND, my dear! Any
hint from you, I’m sure /
Mrs. Sallowby. There ought to be a law that when any of those
dreadful cases occur, like—(Cries of Yes, yes)—you know, and the
ridiculous policemen cannot find out who did it, everybody who is near
the place shall be cast into prison and kept on bread and water till they
confess. (Great applause.)
Mrs. Tufton. I really think that the present state of the law about
debts is very wrong. The other day a case occurred under º Own
knowledge. CAPTAIN Swoshi NGHAM, some of you have seen him at
my house—well, I don't say that he is the wisest creature in the world,
but he is excessively handsome—he had an action brought against him
by a perfumer. Soldier-like, he tossed the papers in the fire, and did
not condescend to take the least notice of the matter.
Miss Gusher (enthusiastically). Brave creature I like that.
. Mrs. Tufton. The wretched perfumer went on, my dears, with the
aid of his horrible º and one day CAPTAIN SwosbiNGHAM,
while he was dressing himself, was actually dragged off to prison at the
instance of that contemptible perfumer. -
Mrs. Bowker. But he had had the perfumes, I suppose?
Mrs. Tufton. Of course he had, and used them, or had given them
away, for he is the most generous creature breathing. There ought to
be law to prevent such disgusting impertinence in tradesmen.
Miss St. Clair. I only wish I was the Judge, or Chancellor, or what-
ever you call it, and a paltry ugly mean-looking tradesman came before
me to annoy an officer and a gentleman.
al voices. Ah!
Mrs. Meekham. I think there ought to be a law for preventing the
lower classes from smoking their pipes in the streets. Really the whiffs
of tobacco one gets in walking are perfectly dreadful. I would make
it transportation for any common person to smoke anywhere except in
one of his own apartments.
Mrs. Tufton. I don't think that gentlemen would support the putting
down smoking in the streets. Officers are very fond of Weeds, as they
wittily call them, and—
Mrs. Meekham. My dear, I did not mean that for an instant. I
mean bricklayers, clerks in public offices, and that sort. Indeed, it
would be better (thoughtfully) in a philanthropic point of view, if such
persons were forbidden to smoke, because they could put the tobacco-
money into the savings banks for their families. (Applause.)
Mrs. Spoonbury. Well, now there’s another thing. The S,
what a nuisance they are, and yet one don't like to be harsh with them,
poor things, especially when they have children (applause), but it is
quite wrong that they should torment you in the street, and keep the
poor little things out in the cold. I think we ought to have some sort
of law about that.
. Mrs. Frackleton. I think that any lady who sees a beggar, should
give her a card, and this should be shown to a policeman, who should
immediately be obliged to see to the poor creature’s being clothed and
fed, and sent home with a little money in her pocket.
Mrs. }º. And the expense?
Mrs. Frackleton. Of course I have thought of that. It is a great shame
that such large salaries should be given to lawyers, and bishops, and
those kind of people, while the poor starve. So I would cut down all
those salaries, and use the money for the relief of the poor.
Mrs. Bland. My dear soul, I have not a word to say for the lawyers,
but perhaps as I accidentally happen to be a little more among the
bishops than some of you, I may assure you that the high payment is
perfectly essential. There are a thousand reasons why it is absolutely
necessary. I have had it explained to me fifty times, and—you must
omit the bishops from your plan.
Mrs. De Crapaud. Oh, my dear MRs. BLAND !
everything.
Mrs. Tufton. Why, it stands to reason that a bishop's business is
with the religion of the ºilº, and what respect can a Duke or
Earl have for a two-penny curate?
Mrs. St. Rubric. I must be allowed to say that I do not think you
quite understand that subject. The two-penny curate, as you are
pleased to call him, is as much part of the Church—
Mrs. Bland (laughing |...} May I say Order, Order? I
think we had better confine ourselves to ław Reform. I’m afraid
that if we get into ecclesiastical matters we shall find differences
among us.
Mrs. Tufton. I don't want to say anything. I was only supporting
your view of the matter, and º: that you can’t expect noblemen
and that kind of personages to be instructed by scrubby curates.
Mrs. St. Rubric. I won't have curates called scrubby.
Mrs. Tufton. I beg your pardon—you won't £

- O MY DEAR PUNCH,
“DEAR OLD PET,
—I dare say you re-
member that I wrote
to you the other day
to say how glad I was
to find that our dear
darling PRINCE of
WALEs was gettin
on so charmingly wit
our cousins in Ame-
rica — though why
they’re called our
cousins, when we talk
of ‘Brother.JonATHAN."
and they taikof’īnºle
BuLL,” I’m sure I
really cannot for the
life of me determine.
But while I said how
pleased I was to find
how well the Prince
got on and how proud
we all should be of
him, you know I had
to add a word of sad
regret that the girls he
had to dance with
were such clumsy
partners, for the pa-
pers, you know, told
us what great awkward things they were; and how they wobbled in their waltzing; and how
the Prince had to turn dancing-master, and teach them how to hold themselves; and how, to
show how bored he was, he never once danced twice with any single one of them!”
“Well, from an extract I’ve been reading in the Illustrated News, it seems at last the bad
behaviour of the girls has been enough to sour the sweet temper of the Prince; and I must
say I’m not surprised, and I don't feel very sorry for it. The way they trod upon his toes,
no doubt, was painful in the extreme, and I’m sure an angel (only angels have no corns)
could not have borne it better. But, patience has its limits, and at last the Prince, poor
fellow ! was so terribly imposed upon that he took on the offenders a most terrible revenge. This
is what I read this morning to Papa, who now that Parliament is up will listen to the letters
of “our own Correspondents,’ and any other tittle-tattle that I happen to pick out for him:—
“At Guelph the Prince was sung to by twenty-nine young ladies, whom he rewarded by proxy, kissing
the daughter of the Mayor for them all.”
“There now, wasn't that a terrible revenge to take Only just conceive how shamefully the
girls must have behaved, for the Prince so to “reward” them, as in irony we’re told he did.
The writer does not tell us what was their offence, whether they sang badly, or giggled, or
threw sheepseyes at his Royal Highness. But whatever their fault was, they were most
severely punished for it. Just conceive the degradation of being kissed by prory / as if one
wasn't pretty enough to be personallykissed I declare if I’d been one of the unhappy twenty-
eight, I don't think I could possibly have long survived the shame of it.
“Of course it must be charming to be kissed by royal lips, and I must own that I envy
much the daughter of the Mayor of Guelph, who will delight to tell her grandchildren the
honour that was done her. Of course she will be viewed now as no ordinary match, and
may hold her hand up for the very highest bidders. A girl whose cheeks have been saluted
by a Prince, may expect to get a lord if not a marquis for her husband. To be sure, they
haven’t lords and marquises in Canada, and Miss §o. may wait a long while there before
she catches one. Still it must be a great pleasure to her to think how she was kissed in the
presence of the Court, and was singled out from such a number of competitors. Oh, how I
do wish I’d been she, and had that odious JULIA WRIGGLEToN to stand where she could see
me! She's got re–no, auburn hair, and watery sky-blue eyes, and such big feet and freckles,
that I’m quite sure and certain she’d have been one of the eight-and-twenty. I can't think
how cousin CHARLEY can see any beauty in her; but I’m persuaded that the Prince would be
much too good a judge to do so.
“It was too bad, I declare, that his Lordship—or should I say his Grace?—the DUKE
OF NEWCASTLE allowed his Royal Highness to make eight-and-twenty enemies, at a Fº too
which is clearly named after his own family. But still I must repeat, I do so wish I’d been
M. ¥on (or whatever else her name may be) and had had Miss JULIA to stand and see
fººd ao tº .
“Ever, Mr. Punch, your most attentive reader,
“GeoRGIANA Gushington.”
“P.S. I’m told that in Court circles they sometimes court byproxy. For the PRINCE OF
WAles's sake I hope it isn’t true. But if it is, one feels more reconciled to being born a
common person.”
* This, Miss, was
matter of Court etiquette, not liking. And the papers did not say the girls were
“wobbling waltzers.”
It is your jealousy, young lady, which invents such cruel phrases.—Punch.

THE END OF THE SEA-SIDE
SEASON.
OUR Ramsgate Correspondent writes to us
as follows:– If the ghost of GoLDSMITH were
to rise up at this time, with the wish to add a
line or two to his Deserted Willage, he could not
well do better than take the train to Ramsgate,
and muse in ‘mournful numbers’ on its melan-
choly aspect. Everything and everybody soon
would
is all over. Even the poet THOMson, who wrote
four books about the Seasons, could hardly find
materials to write two lines now about this.
The few visitors who linger sadly on the pier flit
noiselessly as though they were the ghosts of the
departed, and pass with downcast looks as
though ashamed of being seen there. They move
about with all the air of melancholy maniacs,
and if they stay much longer they will run the
risk of being carried off to private madhouses,
and clapped into strait waistcoats. The steam-
boats come in daily with nobody on board except
the crew , and captain. The shilling-an-hour
boatmen have, laid up their crafts in winter
quarters, and have rigged their better halves
in bran new gowns and bonnets. The bathing
machines are all drawn up so high and dry that
it seems to be a problem if they ever will be wet
again. Not a donkey brays defiance on the
beach : not a bath-chair now is visible, even
with a telescope. Not a wooden spade or sand-
heap is there by the sad sea waves; not, an
organ, or a bagpipe, or a German band is audible.
All the minstrels with blacked faces have taken
themselves ‘off to Charlestown,” or some other
locality; and the Tyrolean Tenor who sings so
sentimentally and sweetly out of tune, with one
eye closed in strong emotion, and the other
looking out for coppers, has left us with his
wife and small harmonium-playing son, and
is probably now singing to some al fresco
inland audience. More saddening fact still—
the vocal vender of crisp hardbake, delicate
drops, and tempting toffy, has at one fell swoop
deprived us of his sweet . and his sweet
stuffs, and has left us lollipopless to lament his
absence.
“Paragon is a wilderness; grass is growing
in High Street, and hay, if there were sunshine,
might be made on half the pavements. The
shopkeepers have mostly put their chains and
shutters up, and are now engaged in counting
over their unholy gains and in sending con-
science money to the Income-Tax Collector.
The lodging-letters have emerged from their
coalcellars and dustbins, or whatever other holes
be in the summer-time their sleeping places. It
is believed that they would occupy the bed-rooms
which in summertime fetch five guineas a night,
but that they are haunted with the ghosts of
recent victims, who came, saw, and were fleeced,
and fleabitten into the bargain. The flys have
flown away, or else are hibernating in back
slums; the riding horses have returned to their
normal occupations, and are now drawing
bakers' carts, or working in a circus. The hotel-
keepers have vanished to visit their estates, or
confer with BARON Rothschild about buying
up the Bank, as a safe way of employing some
º their spare millions. In short, so dull...is
Ramsgate, that the brigand's occupation is, like
Othello's, gone. A cat or two are now the only
beasts of prey left preyable. Even the fleas, it
is affirmed, have this week hopped the twig.
Their flight has been described as the Retreat
of the Ten Thousand.”

NOWELTY FOR NEWSPAPERS.
In the “Births, Marriages, and Deaths” published in the papers,
why is it that the ages of the several persons named are specified
under the latter head alone? The Births, of course, speak for them-
selves in this respect, but the Marriages by no means do; for we know
that an age long past the years of discretion is no necessary cause or
impediment why some persons should not join themselves together in
holy matrimony. The ages of deceased parties signify, for the most
part, nothing to anybody but their friends and relations, whereas the
iime of life at which people marry is to other people in general a matter
of interest or amusement; of interest when the couple are both young:
of amusement when they are both old or one of them considerably
older than the other. In the case of the aristocracy our contemporaries
could get the requisite information out of the Peerage; and if the
journals, in announcing a Marriage in High Life, always.regularly
published the time of that life arrived at by the bride and bridegroom,
the majority of newly-wedded pairs, in sending their names for inser-
tion, would take very good care to mention how old they were.
THE TIDE OF FASHION.
The Ornamental Water, which has been absent now for several
weeks, has returned to its Metropolitan residence in the enclosure in
St. James's Park. This is one of the first proofs that town is gradually
filling. We need not say that the Water is looking all the better for
its change. Not only is it much clearer in its complexion, but it seems
also to have increased in volume almost as much as it has gained in
beauty, and looks much healthier altogether. ... It has been visited every
day by hundreds of nursery-maids and soldiers, who seem most de;
lighted to see it back again. We need not state that the Qrnamental
Water is waited upon by its usual retinue of ducks and other aquatic
birds, who are looking remarkably well just at present in their hand-
some winter liveries, particularly the swans, who are presenting, so to
speak, the very cleanest bills of health.
MANUFACTORY AND MYSTERY.
We are really very ignorant: . Every time we take the Times up we
see a something advertised, which completely puzzles us... Here for
instance is a statement which so bothered us at breakfast, that we ate
our second egg without at all enjoying it:—
WANTºp A PARTNER, of business habits, in a large bond fide
Manufacturing concern. Address, &c.
Now, pray, what's a “land fide?”, What's its usual size and
how is it manufactured P. We notice that this bond fide is expressly
called a “large”.9ne, and our second query therefore instinctively
suggests itself. We are ourselves “of business habits,” (only ask our
Printer's boy, who never has to wait above pa hour or two for “copy”
from us), and we might be tempted to ent’, as a partner in this adver-
tised “concern.” But until we know the nature of what is manufac-
tured in it, of course we should not dream of venturing to offer. Only
think if “bond ſide” should turn out after all to be a slang trade name
tº: ºr which we should be “wanted” to manufacture into
read suuli .
“Know Thyself.”
MoRALIsts are always dinning this precept into our ears. ... We
should hardly venture, however, to recommend it to the notice of DR.
CULLEN; for supposing he succeeded, he would be forming a very low
acquaintance.

sir, to defraud pore suvnts of their puckwisits, which i calls it Meen

“We own that on public grounds we are opposed to the system of giving gra-
tuities to servants; and if we even entertained the question, we should protest
against the unequal and inequitable manner in which they are administered. Take
for instance among outdoor servants the stud groom, head gamekeeper-and-park-
keeper, and huntsman. If a friend gives you a mount, the “master of the horse'
of the stable expects a sovereign for one with the foxhounds, and half for one with
the harriers, and yet his only trouble is to give the order and alter the stirrups a
hole or two, while the helper who has all the hard work to do receives not a
farthing; it is nearly the same with the head keeper who employs an underling to
clean your guns, and thinks you a very shabby fellow if you do not offer him
‘golden opinions' to prove the contrary; the park-keeper too, if ordered to forward
half a buck, not only º: himself to a portion of it as his usual perquisite, but
anticipates a guinea for the trouble of killing the deer."

- RULY, since the day when
Ireland's hero, MR.
SMITH O'BRIEN, hid
himself among the other
crawling caterpillars in
the cabbage garden, we
have never had such
dreadful news from Ire-
land as is contained in
the º; extract
º the Kilkenny Jour-
fºam --
"We have learned from
a London Correspondent
that the Government has
cautioned the Times against
the insertion of such articles
as that which appeared
lately in its columns against
the Irish Brigade ; not, of
course, that such is not the
true English feeling towards
Ireland, but that it is in-
judicious and impolitic at
the pres' nt crisis . This
seems confirmed by an
article in the Morning
Chronicle of Thursday, glos-
sing the matter over, and
wondering that the Irish
should feel annoyed at the
abusive article of the Times,
as their bravery on every
battlefield places them be-
yond the reach of criticism or the charge of cowardice All very fine, Mr. Chronicle, but Ireland
will never forget that ruffian attack, at a time when she was trembling with anxiety for the fate
of her brave volunteers... No “soft sawder' will blot it out from the national memory, and, with
Heaven's help, there will be a day of reckoning."
Ah! These London Correspondents. They are the boys for making discoveries.
Did LoRD PALMERSTON think that because he sneaked meanly out at the back-
door of Broadlands, and spoke to MR. SIDNEY HERBERT in the kitchen garden
among the clothes that were hanging out to dry, and told him what to dº, and
because MR. HERBERT put on a footman's old livery, and went in a hack cab (no,
not a Hansom, British minions, but a close cab. No lič7, driver Alphonso
STUMPER, ha, slaves!), and stole into P. H. Square at one in the morning to give
the hint in question, the London Correspondent of a Kilkenny paper did not
detect every turn in the foul and makjiki area of the cowardly Saxons? Bah!
No, Ireland will never forget “that ruffian attack.” Yes, ruffian attack. You
may affect to laugh at it, Saxon dogs, and say that it was a good bit of fun, and a
|
not ill-natured way of letting down fellows who would have
deserved to be treated as rogues if they had not been such
everlasting fools; but that is only adding insult to insult.
“A day of reckoning will come,” and Irishmen, who always
ay their debts, will be ready for the dark hour of vengeance.
Tremble, caitiffs, for the spirit of the Kilkenny cats is not
laid, but bides its time. In the words of one of your own
execrable poets—
“Those who fought and ran away
May live to run another day."
And dire will be the “other day” when, the heroes,
happily saved from the Sardinian fiends, shall receive the
mot d'ordre, “Printing House Square, E.C.”, Not all the
#º stuff from the neighbouring Apothecaries
Hall will in that day avail to medicine the foes of Irelan
after her steel lozenges, ha! haſ shall have done their
work. In the burning words of our own bard:–
“We'll tread the land that hates us,
That demeans and understates us,
We'll uphold our maxims,
And pound the Saxons,
And we 'ſl smash the Times that slates us.
Sword of Honour Extraordinary.
The British Papists are going to present LAMORICIERE
with a sword. Perhaps they don't know that the one which
he had to surrender was returned to him again. How-
ever, if the Pope's defeated champion wants a sword, let
the friends of slavery present him with one by all means.
The sort of sword most suitable for presentation to the
hero of Ancona would be one with a flexible blade; such a
weapon as that which Harlequin flourishes in our Christmas
pantomimes, and with which he does, as LAMORICIERE in
his last engagement did, wonders.
Cabmanism Amended.
(A FACT.)
PROPRIETY of diction, as a point of general, refinement,
is advancing amongst the drivers of our public vehicles:
A clergyman calling “Cab. 1" had, the gratification...of
receiving from a Hansom director the equally respectful
and correct reply, “Here I am, Sir!”

UESTIONs are more easil

information upon
curiosity of literature,
which we copy from the

Now, pray what are
these luminous men :

says of us:–
"The turbulent irregularity of a mob, however well meant or dictated by good
feeling, could not fail to grate harshly upon one of so much natural and acquired
refinement. Therefore, the lower strata of the democratic element may prove some-
what uncongenial to him. But I am happy to say that the people of the United
States generally, and the superior order particularly, have studied his comfort,
pleasure, and wishes, with a delicacy dictated by that good sense which is their pre-
vailing characteristic, that has not failed to impress him and his suite with a very
favourable idea of American consideration and courtesy."
“Screamin' fine that scribblin', ain't it? And to show hedw true it

kind if some one would
enlighten us. We have
heard men sometimes
spoken of as being shining
lights, but we have never
before heard them des-
cribed as being luminous.
Moreover, from the man-
ner in which they have
been “ordered” of him,
one would think M.DEMANGEOT had the power to manufacture them;
and one must regard.him as a sort of phosphorescent, Frankenstein,
endowed with the ability not merely to make men, but to make them
luminous.
If it were not almost too great a liberty to take, we might suggest
that were ARchbishop Cul-LEN to apply to fill the place of one of
these eight luminous individuals, the director of Covent Garden might
be tempted to accept him. As one of the bright lights of the Roman
Catholic Church, DR. Qulliºn might put in a claim to being viewed as
luminous; and seeing how he has lately blazed away for his Brigade,
and what a farce he has been playing to celebrate their obsequies, we |k
think, the, Doctor is just fit for a theatrical engagement, and would
exactly fill a part where he is wanted to be luminous.

“Man is º nature regal and princely. Democracy is the cordial recognition of
this fact, and seeks not to uncrown men except by crowning all men. Heaven
meant mankind for a race of kings and queens, princes and princesses; and to
realise that end is the aim of democracy. In ages of rudeness homage to the royal
character of some men was a step towards the general culture of such character.

pupilage, to have done adulating and to have become kings. * * * Without a

free country, and we air mostly sorter free-and-easy in our talk. We
|ain't shy o' findin’ fault neither, and I reckon as our writers can
criticise a 'coon as well as compliment him. At the Cincinnati Ball,
for example, we air told that “at times the Prince, apparently, was very
much embarrassed,' (Wal, I calc'late them air crinnyleans du
‘embarrass' a chap kinder'), ‘and it was noticed that he made several
mistakes, not being au fait in American style; but he soon recovered
himself, and enjoyed himself in his usual style.” Y’ see, our style ain't

and to this the Herald adds, by way of courteous compliment, “Some
people think he is looking seedy; but he is probably saving his best
clothes for his New York visit. In course the delicate inference from
this, here writer's statement is, that the Prince’s “usual dress’ is

BRIGHTON JEWELS.
A SEA-SIDE STUDY.
By A SENTIMENTAL STUDENT.
As I walked out at Margate,
It was but th' other day,
A Jew there sat in a “Porkpie” hat,
At a window that was bay.
I stood and gazed upon him,
To assureme of his race;
I knew not his name, but his birth was plain
As the nose upon his faceſ
Yet he sported a Porkpie hat!
And I couldn't help thinking that
'Twas a singular thing
For a poet to sing
Of a Jew in a Porkpie hat!
'Twas extremely rude to stare so,
Of course I well knew that;
But it seemed to me so queer to see
A Jew in a Porkpie hat.
At the hat and the nose beneath it
I º: and gazed amain,
And I haven't a doubt, if the truth were out,
I should do the same again.
If still at the window sat
The Jew in the Porkpie hat!
For who could help staring
To see a Jew wearin
A thing called a Porkpie int ?
A PIG AND A POKE.
“MR. PUNCH, SIR,
“The other morning, as I were a going to kill our pig, in
steps our parson... My wife she were a standing by me, quite pleased
to see the pig weighed so handsome—and our two little lads was a
laughing like mad, for really the pig did squeak quite unnecessary
like to my wife, ‘I do
loud. So says the parson, says he, S. ºf d still more that
all more that you
wonder, MARY, that you should be here at
should allow your boys to make diversion of a poor dumb animal's
sufferings. (Dumb he warn’t, no how, by the bye, but that 's nought.)
Why can’t, you let GILEs kill the pig by himself, and why don't you
give those two brats a couple of boxes on the ear for taking a pleasure
in seeing such sights?”
. “Those were our parson's very words, Sir, and I do believe he were
right; so I told my wife to go indoors and mind her own business, and
theni took the stick to JEM and BILLY, and sent 'em scampering like
afore I finished the pig, which died beautiful.
“A few days after, my wife she was a reading out to us after supper
an old penny paper as the cheese had come home in, she reads capi
well, for she was in service at the parson's before she married me,
and I’ll be hanged if she didn't read out this:—
“From the Court Circular.
“Yesterday HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, with their Royal Highnesses the PRINCE
CoNsort, the Duke and Duchess of SAxe-CobURG Gotha, the PRINCE and PRINCEss
FREDERick WiLLIAM, of Prussia, and PRINCEss Alice, accompanied also by Load
John Russell, and attended by the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Household, drove
to the Wald Parc at Mönckröden, where, the gentlemen being posted, the forest was
driven for wild boar. The sport was very successful, seven boars being killed.
Luncheon was afterwards served to the Royal party in one of the forester's houses."
“Only fancy, Sir, our Gracious, Queen, and the little, PRINCEss

than in what Mother has just been reading out to us?' I really didn't
know what to say to the lad, Sir, so in course I º him a lick, and
sent him flying. But I wish you would tell me what I ought to have
said to him, for when I asked our parson, he told me not to talk about

SPIRIT-RAPPING TESTIMONIALS.
THE Editor of the Spiritual Magazine, and Proprietor of the famous
Spirit-Rapping Ointment, begs respectfully to lay before his friends
and the public a few of the Testimonials with which he has been
favoured by parties who have availed themselves of his Discovery.
They are but a handful out of thousands, but they fully exemplify the
eminently advantageous working of his system. He may, however,
hereafter submit further evidences of the efficacy of the Discovery in
altering the present unnatural state of society.

"Sir, It would be injustice to you, and false delicacy in me, if I
withheld my testimonial to the efficiency of your Spirit-Rapping Oint-
ment, which has wrought, Mussy be praised, the most extraordinary
cure in my own case. Sir, I had been for many years troubled with a
most obstinate complaint in my mind, and I found myself utterly unable
to believe anything. In vain did, I apply the strongest remedies, in
vain did I seek to swallow the blood of St. Januarius, the Winking
Picture, MR. BRIGHT's allegations against the upper classes, and other
things which I was told, by friends, if I could once get down, I should
be cured of my incredulity. At last, Sir, in a happy hour, somebody
mentioned your Ointment. I bought but one sixpenny packet, and
tº: it. Sir, I took it in faith, and instantly found that I could
believe anything. . Now, Sir, I am a changed man, and prepared to
give credit to whatever may be stated to me. As a proof, Sir, I was
told yesterday, by an Irish friend, that the Pope's volunteers from
Ireland had slaughtered thirty times their own number before they
were taken by the enemy, and I never thought of contradicting him.
Sir, although I know that such permission is needless to you in the
case of private communications, I authorise you to make what use you
like of this letter.

to watch its effects. In about three minutes I began to laugh, then to
yawn, and my wife, entering the room an hour afterwards found me in
a sound slumber. I had not previously slept for several hours. I have
bought several packets, and am happy to add that the Ointment has
been equally efficacious with my children. Formerly, there was no
getting them to go to bed, but I have now only to exhibit a packet of
your Qintment, and in a moment they are all up, and wishing me, and
their Mamma fº. night. Publish this letter, f you think it will be

“MRs. MEPHIBosh ETH BARNEs presents her compliments to the
Editor of the Spiritual Magazine, and begs to thank him for the great
utility of his Ointment. Her eldest son, a ...; lad of twelve
years. old, and a pupil at the Buffington Proprietary, School, was
devoting himself to his studies with an energy which, she, as a fond
mother feared would be prejudicial to his health. At length, alarmed at
his saying that he was determined to go in and win the Greek prize, she
º: some of the Spirit-Rapping Ointment, and administered it to
AsTER, BARNEs. At first he revolted against it, but she having per-
severed in º it under his eyes, he began to like it, and it has
entirely cured him of any over-zeal in his studies, as he now thinks of
nothing but the Ointment, and there is not the least chance of his
gaining the Greek or any other prize.

“Sir, Permit a happy father to thank you with all the earnestness
of the paternal nature for having effected a singular cure in his house-
hold. I am the parent, Sir, of two charming daughters, aged respec-
tively 19 and 17, and they, being possessed of lively spirits, were a
#. trouble to me, who am a quiet, widower. They were always

kind, and would frequently ask me to take them to one of the operas
or the theatre; or to invite young friends to see them at home. It
was a source of much disturbance to my evenings. By a lucky, or
shall I say, a ºil. circumstance, your ointment came my know.

it with the enthusiasm of their age. No more dances, operas, parties
stage-plays for them now. They have become silent and thoughtful, and
neither will ever stir from the room without the other, especially after
dark. They are completely subdued, and I should hardly know
them again. Accept once more the thanks of a happy father, and

To show that he has no other object than the discovery of the
truth, and never seeks to “humbug” anybody, the Editor of the Spi-
ritual Magazine prints the following letter, although its contents do
not, at first sight, present evidence of so favourable a result as in the
preceding cases. But truth is immortal, and can bear any casualties:-

"Siri-Ishquld be much obliged by your advice under these cir-
cumstances. My husband was a clerk in the Bank of England, and a
wery steady, economical, and affectionate man, who j me in all
things except one. That, Sir, was the surreptitiously procuring and
constantly using your Spirit-Rapping Ointment. §. times have I
flung it out of window, and into the fire, but the determined victim
always possessed himself of more, and at last became so addicted to its
use that he neglected his business at the Bank, and ended by defying
the Governor and Company for rebuking him, in consequence of which
he was turned out of his situation. He did not feel this much at first,
declaring that he was glad to be a martyr for Spiritualism, but he
gradually sank into a low way, and yesterday morning I was surprised
at seeing his two legs sticking out of the water-butt. º: the
day before had been washing day, so there was nothing in the butt but
mud, slime, and efts, and he escaped exceedingly dirty and with a lum
on his forehead the size of an orange, but the moral is the same, and
could wish that you would print with your Ointment directions as to
how much weak people qught to be allowed to take at a time. I have
him safe in bed now, and I think he is ashamed of himself, though the
maid says that he is constantly knocking his gruel-spoon against the
night-lamp, and asking whether there are any Spirits in the room.

that I wished she would return to her friends. Happily, a friend
recommended your Ointment, and I have applied it with such success,

but we fear if he continues his Cullenary courses, DR. CULLEN will in
time be mistaken for DR. KITCHENER. No doubt each member of his

PUNCH'S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMEs.
CHAPTER XXXIV-THE TIME OF HENRY THE SIXTH.
UNNILY fantastic as were
the civil habits, the knight-
ly armour of this period we
learn was quite asſanciful.
One writer describes the
panoply of horsemen as
showing the “unbridled
caprices of the day;” but
we question if this phrase
may be accepted in its lite-
ralness, for we cannot think
that horsemen rode their
nags unbridled, any more
than (with the exception
of at Astley's) they do now.
Surcoats and jupons went
somewhat out of fashion,
and it became “the thing”
to cover the breast-piece
and the placard with two
different coloured silks.
The placard, we should
note, was a plate, and not
a #. as readers of the
bill stickin persuasion
might imagine it. Breast-
lates now consisted most-
y of two pieces, and the
lower one of these was
called properly the placard.
We find that back-plates
were occasionally worn
as well as breast-plates;
chiefly, we presume, by
knights who thought dis-
cretion was the better part
of valour, and who were prone, when they were forced to fight, to
let their feelings run away with them. In lieu, however, sometimes
both of breast-pieces and back-plates, there was worn a kind of jacket
called a jazerant, or jazerine; a defence which was composed of little
overlapping iron plates, covered with rich velvet, and for men who
studied their personal appearance, fastened with gilt studs.
Aprons of chain mail still continued to be worn; but whether, only
by Free Masons, we confess we cannot, state. Over these are shown
in some of the old drawings plates called tuiles, depending from the
front skirt of the body armour, and which it would appear were now
first introduced. ºf so many plates about them, the knights must
certainly have found it difficult to cut away, and when º; to escape
one can't help thinking that the fat ones were occasionally dished. It
would thin the stoutest ranks to box them up in body-plates, and then
to, start them at “the double;” and however, much their military
ardour might be cooled, there would be little need of plate-warmers for
keeping up their vital heat.
at there, were lightly armoured, swells, as well as knightly
“heavies” is however º by PHILIP DE CoMMINEs; who
tells us how the DUKEs of BERRI and BRETAGNE “were at their ease
upon their hobbies” (which is more than can be said of some of our MPs.)
“armed only, with gilt nails, sewn upon satin, that they might weigh
the less.” This queer fashion of wearing gilt nails upon satin must
have given, knights a rather coffiny appearance; and if there be any:
thing significant in names, one may fairly think that such a suit of
armour must have been exactly suited for the DUKE DE BERRI.
Another point to notice in the military equipment is that to the
bascinet, the helmet, and the old chapel-de-fer (by the bye, we ought
to caution the weakminded of our readers that this ancient iron
“chapel” must in no way be confounded with the modern iron
churches, which we are now making for the settlers in Wan Diemen's
Land and the natives of our mining districts, and of other heathen
parts)—to these old head-pieces we find was added now the “salade,”
to which we have alluded in our notice of the armour of the last pre-
ceding reign. The salade was a kind of bascinet or skull-cap, made to
fit the head, and to project behind it in the manner of a trough, so as
to keep both wet and weapons from dropping on the neck. We believe
it to have been of German introduction; for we own we put no cre-
dence in the story that the salade was originally introduced by SALADIN,
We have spoken of a fur called “lettice” at this period, but whether
or no this lettice was in any way mixed up in the making of the salade,
we must leave the Antiquarian Society to judge.
A sort of steel cap called a casquetel was also used about this time,
and was furnished with oreillets, which were round or oval plates
covering the ears. A spike called a crenel, or by some writers a

channel, was stuck atop of this new steel, cap; and sometimes,the
oreillets were themselves supplied with spikes, projecting from their
centres. Qne would fancy that this fashion must have found especial
favour with the school-boys of the period; for spiked oreillets must
have made the schoolmasters think twice before they dared to box the
ears of peccant pupils.
Whether or no horses were at this time more than usually tough
about the cuticle, we are unable with our present means of knowledge
to decide. But we find that spurs were made with terribly long shanks,
and the spikes of the rowels were of formidable dimensions. To give
them extra power, too, it seems that they were generally screwed into
steel shoes, an arrangement which the “screws,” for whose excitement
they were used, could hardly have approved of.
MILITARY SHOES AND SPURs or THE PERIoD. Found whilst DIGoing
the Foundations For MR. PUNCH's NEW COAL-CELLAR.
During the reign of the Sixth HENRY the first token of an important
change in warfare, became visible and it clearly must not, pass un:
noticed in our Book. According to the best authorities (including ºf
course ourselves) it was at this time that the hand-cannon or “gonne
was introduced: a weapon which we ought to regard with no small
interest as being the first parent of our Miniés and Enfields, and the
great great greatest grandmother of our exploded, old Brown Bess.
Wastly different from fl. modern eight-or-ten-mile-killing rifle was its
first, progenitor the hand-cannon, or gonne. Such as they were, we
think the merits of the invention belong to the Italians, who seem first
to have been struck with the brilliant idea that small cannon might be
made as easily as large ones, and that if they were made portable, foot
soldiers could carry them. The first parent of our Mantons and our
Westley Richardses was a simple iron tube (not unlike a little gas
pipe or a largish pea-shooter) made with trunnions at the sides and a
touchhole pierced atop. This was fixed in a piece of wood about a
couple of feet in length, which answered to the modern, stock, and was
called the frame. It was soon found out, however, while the touchhole
was atop that the priming got blown off before the match could be
applied; and so some genius or other made the touchhole at the side,
and put a small pan under it so as to hold the priming. It being then
as now a maxim to keep one's powder dry, a cover for the pan was
added in due course, constructed with a pivot so as to turn off and on.
With these improvements it appears the gonne was used in England as
early as the year 1446; as the curious may learn by a purchase-roll so
dated, bearing reference to the Castle on Holy Island, Durham; a
document which readers of black letter may find interesting, but which
ordinary readers would not care to have us quote. - - -
Of course we may surmise, without much fear of contradiction, that
the newly invented weapon was fit for other purposes than that of
human slaughter, and that sportsmen as well as soldiers in course of
time inade use of it. What sort of a figure was cut by cockney
shooters who went out a birding with one of these new gonnes, and
became almost gonne 'coons from the recoil of it, we leave to our own
artist with the help of his old manuscripts here clearly to depict.

assassins, had seized the strongest positions, and selected the
battle-ground, most favourable to themselves; and, adding perfidy
to overwhelming numbers, had commenced the struggle before they
gave any indication of their hostile intentions.”
Of course regular troops, acting under judicious com-
manders, do not usually seize the strongest positions,
select the battle-ground most favourable to themselves,
and swoop down upon their antagonists when the latter
are unprepared for them. No; as DR. Cullen says, they
leave this low kind of strategy to robbers and assassins,
who, in order to carry out their murderous and predatory
designs, are well known to be in the habit of intrenching
themselves in fastnesses, securing a basis of operations,
and choosing their own field—that is to say, when they
mean to fight, and do not intend, creeping up to their
victim and stabbing him in the back, or lying in wait for
him and shooting him from behind a hedge. This way of
committing murder is one which DR. CULLEN may have
heard of Fthough, not perhaps in Ireland. . But brave
sºldiers, handled by magnanimous leaders, always punc-
tiliously take care to give the forces opposed to them due
intimation of their hostile intentions. A British general
officer, indeed, has always a Solicitor on his staff and usually
sends him on to serve a notice upon the opponent against
whom he meditates any military operation.
The most famous Captains, moreover, we know as well
as CULLEN does, utterly, ignore the detestable doctrine
that victory generally inclines to the strongest battalions.
Instead, therefore, of trying to crush a foe by numerical
superiority, they invariably, before giving battle, make a
practice of telling off men enough on their own side, if
the stronger, to put it as nearly as possible on an equality
with the other. They handicap their troops in fact. By
resorting to this noble expedient, besides affording their
antagonists an ample warning, they add simplicity to a
doubtful match, instead of “adding perfidy to overwhelm-
ing numbers.” Of the baseness thus denounced by
Dr. Cullen in terms of the choicest Irish rhetoric,
º and the Sardinians will no doubt feel sufficiently
as named.
AN ALGERINE CRUSADER.
OUR FRIEND THE DOCTOR.
DR. CUMMING has just delivered, at Manchester, a pleasant address,
We must not believe all that we read, and therefore cannot vouch
for the authenticity of the following extract from a despatch signed
DE LAMORICIERE:–
“Do not write to me about any more of those gossips, or else request me to put
Macerata in a state of siege. We will arrest twenty-five persons, shoot ten of them,
and then it will be all over."
Somebody ought to be hanged; either, the villain who forged the
sentence last foregoing, or the scoundrel that put his own name to it.
The design of quietly arresting twenty-five persons, and shooting ten
of them, is a fine idea for a .# of the Cross. The Cross is now the
prize of valour, but the proper reward for its soldier who conceived
the idea of arresting and shooting people in cold blood, is the gallows.
Yet LAMORICIERE is walking about, whereas, if he really was the
author of the disgraceful document which contains the infamous
passage above cited, he ought, as soon as he was captured, to have
died in his boots, with their soles at some distance from the ground.
A Rooted Absurdity.
WHAT are the Commissioners of Lunacy about?. Here is a Wild
Irishman driving his friends mad, and proving himself eminently fit for
a straitwaistcoat, by claiming GENERAL GARIBALDI as a countryman
of his, in order, as we fancy, that he may let off a bad joke about it.
The General, he says, was born in Cork or Connemara, he is not certain
which ; and, after his father, was christened Richard MURPHY, a
name which he has now contracted to Dick TATOR!
The Dog and his Dwelling.
AIADY, charitable to the canine species, has established a “Home
for Dogs” at Islington. Now a Home for Dogs may be a very
admirable. Institution; but Islington is not, by any means the best
lace for it. A more appropriate site for such an establishment would
ave been found at É.
NEw JewRy.—BARON Rothschild is stated to be arranging for
the purchase of Palestine, with a view to the Restoration of the Jews.
Rents at Brighton are expected to go down two-thirds.
which reminds Mr. Punch of CANNING's lines:–
“Half novel and half sermon, on it flowed :
With pious zeal the ‘Manchesterians' glowed.”
And in this address the Seraphic Doctor (why should he not inherit
the title?) did Mr. Punch the honour of adverting to a paragraph
published by the latter some weeks ago, at the time when it was
stated—and, as the Doctor allows, truthfully—that, though believing
that the world would end in 1867, DR, CUMMING had taken a lease of
a house for twenty-one years. Mr. Punch, upon that occasion, grace-
fully complimented the Doctor upon his common sense. In the
Manchester address, DR. CUMMING refers to Mr. Punch's courtesy,
but says:—
“The Celebrated Satirist did not state that the lease was terminable at the end
of 7, 14, or 21 years.”
Tº Celebrated Satirist did not state this, because he did not know
it. But now that he does know it, from the best authority, he hastens
to announce it throughout the world, and to renew his compliments to
DR. CUMMING upon his extreme wide-a-wake-ishness. If the world
does not come to an end in 1867, the Doctor can renew his lease, and if
it does, the lease will come to an end by what never can be more exactly
defined than in legal language—the Effluxion of Time. All is serene,
Seraphic Doctor.
An Awkward Memorandum.
“The Irish Catholics give a sword to LAMoRicièak.”
He wants a new blade, for the old one has flown,
So give him the sword, † the scoff
Which hints that whenever he puts the steel on
He'll remember his Paddies were prompt to steal off.
SOCIAL ZOPISSA,
ZoPIssa is announced as something which will prevent the least
decay in a stone. Our friend PAM is not surprised, for he possesses,
(and lon § he possess) something which prevents the least decay
in an Old Brick.

Their glorious exploits were unaqualled for darin',
But ah! now, the Irish Brigade is no more.
Repose they in pace, ever blest be their slumbers,
And hallowed the spot where their cowld remains lie!
They fell, overwhelmed by shuparior numbers,
They would not surrender, preferring to die.
They drove back their foemen with terrible slaughter,
But sank under wounds, and exhausted with toil,
And then their warm life-blood was poured out like water,
To such an extent that it purpled the soil.
They stood whilst the death-shot around them was flying,
As thick as the leaves of the storm-shaken tree;
At last they were all on the battle-field }.
Six hundred–of whom there survived only three.
Och! Talk of LEONIDAs; talk of the Spartans!

IMPORTANT SPORTING NEWS.
(From Belial’s Life.)
At the late Meeting of the Jockey Club, though little business was
done, many very valuable suggestions were made, and among them was
one which it is hoped will forthwith be embodied in a rule of the Club,
and carried out. It is the custom, as every one is aware, to publish on
the eve of a race a list of the horses that have arrived to fulfil their
engagements. But it is thought that the main object of the betting
fraternity would be better served, were the list accompanied by
another, from which they would at once learn the names of those who
attend races for the purpose of supporting the said fraternity. It is
propºsed, therefore, that in future the papers which publish the list of
“arrivals” shall do so in this manner:-
THE FOLLOWING hors ES HAVE ARRIVED :-
Diddle Dumpkin. Lord Williams.

ENGLAND'S IRON WALLS.
We have a mail-clad Warrior on the stocks; but we

to figure in the Lord Mayor's Show.
No longer can we boast of the Wooden Walls of Old

Ribs of steel are our ships,
Engineers are our men,
We're steady boys—steady,
. But always unready;
We’ve just let the French get before us again!
However, steam frigates and rams are better calculated
tº repel aggression, than they are to facilitate invasion,
The service in which they are likely to be most effectual,
is that of keeping offensive people aloof. One of them
would, with the greatest ease, very soon send a three-

OUR ROWING CORRESPONDENT.
“MY DEAR PUNCH, -
“AMONG the various advantages of being in Town when the
cream and flower of fashion have departed, I reckon the comparative
ease with which one can find a Hansom §ab, a vacant table at SIMP-
SQN's, and a seat at the theatres. I don't mean to say that your
‘bloated aristocrats’ take up much more room than ordinary mortals,
or that the º (which I chiefly frequent) is their favourite haunt on
this side the footlights. Still the season is the season, there’s no
* that, and when it comes, bustle and confusion as surely ensue
as that annual hecatomb of delicate kids, of which we are reminded in
our glover’s bills. -
“The other night, then, tempted by that admirable arrangement by
which one, may make sure, of finding a seat without bolting one's
dinner, and thus incurring the horrors of indigestion, I found myself
in the pit of the Adelphi. I prefer, as I have said, that part of the
house... I have heard many of my friends confess the same partiality,
and assign various reasons for so doing; as for instance, because it is
cooler, or warmer, or more respectable than the boxes; or because you
needn't ‘dress’ there, or because it is the best place to see, &c, &c.
Now besides all these there is another advantage, which these honest
folks seem to overlook,but which the following little sum of subtraction
will render evident:—
A box ticket costs say . . . . . 5s. 0d.
A pit ditto ditto ditto . - - - - 2s. 0d.
Leaving a clear balance in hand of 3s. 0d.
That is the advantage I mean, and I can't think why people are so
obtuse as not to see it.
“Of course I went to see the Colleen Baton. I couldn't help myself.
Everyone was bothering me about it..." Have you seen the Colleen º'
says one. “What d'ye think of, the Bawn f", inquired another,
(between ourselves I’ve not the wildest notion what either of these
words mean; but that’s not to the point). , 1, determined to go, and
ou may picture me seated with a bi-foliated playbill in my hand, and
ſ: to the last bars of the overture.
“Ehew, Posthume!, it must be some eight years ago since I, fresh from
the classic shades of Eastminster, sat before another drop-scene when
a certain young lady played Kadiga in the Alhambra, and sang a
facetious duet with poor old HARLEr. By Jove! how I envied that
venerable comedian as he piped out—
“My dear Kadiga, one fine day,” &c.
I would have cheerfully resigned º last, new bat and stumps of the
most approved pattern, and with all the latest improvements, to have

absence from town to repair to the Princess's on five consecutive

she must have noticed. Ah! wive la Jeunesse / Live the youth, indeed!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[November 3, 1860.
and the action takes place (including the subaqueous business) in and
about the Lake of ki. -
“There is a certain Mrs. Cregan (of Torc Cregan) with an only
son, Hardress, who owing to the reverses of Fortune, has become
involved in considerable pecuniary difficulties from which she is natu,
rally anxious to escape. Her chief creditor is a very objectionable old
person by the name of Corrigan, who takes advantage of her embar-
rassment to appear before her in the light of a suitor, and holds certain
mortgages in terrorem by way of inducing her to become his wife.
Being a very high spirited young, widow (and having perhaps some
other swain in view), she is naturally very indignant at the suggestion,
and spurns his offer in her son's presence, who taking up his Mamma's
cause very warmly, brings his boots to bear upon the question, and, in
short, kicks Mr. Corrigan out of the house. That old gentleman goes
away vowing vengeance, and immediate ruin seems the inevitable con-
sequence; but Mrs. C, who, like a true woman, has had another string
º bow all the while, proposes to her son that he should espouse a
wealthy heiress, Miss 8. who is supposed to be possessed of a
large landed estate with a comfortable little, property in the funds
besides. There is, however, a slight, obstacle to this arrangement
which is no less than the fact that Mr. Cregan has already taken to
himself a wife in the person of a peasant girl, Eily O'Connor (the
Colleen Bauen). . Without being aware that matters have gone thus far,
Mrs. Cregan on her son's declining to marry Miss Chute off hand, begins
to suspect that the Bawn has something to do with it, and I leave
you to judge what her feelings are towards that unfortunate young
person.
“Now Miss Chute is an uncommonly nice girl, but it so happens that
she has already fixed her affections on a Mr. Kyrle Daly, and therefore
would not be in a position to listen to Mr. Cregan's addresses (if he
were in a position to pay them), but for an accident which tends rather
to lessen her regard for her original lover. To explain this I must
introduce you to another individual who plays an important part in the
plot. This is a poor cripple called the Danny Man—a sort of retainer
on the Cregan estate, and devotedly attached to ...; Hardress for
the thoroughly Hibernian reason, that that gentleman had pitched
him over a precipice in early life, of which his deformity is the
consequence,
“Seeing the difficult position in which his master is *. and
thinking it a pity that such a fine young squire should be thrown away
upon a cottage girl, the Danny Man sets his wits, to work in order to
prevent, such a catastrophe. He begins by leading Miss Chute (by a
tremendous bouncer) to believe that it is her lover Mr. Daly who is
paying attentions to the Bawn, and thus estranges her from that gen-
tleman. He then eggs on Hardress (who is uneasy at the prospect of
insolvency) to try and wheedle his wife out of her marriage certificate,
representing to '. by way of inducement, what a nice, comfortable
arrangement it would { for all parties if she would kindly make her.
self scarce in order that her hº might contract a second, and more
ºu. marriage without incurring any disagreeable imputations
Ol bigamy.
“Fortunately just at this juncture, and while the poor thing is still
hesitating, an old lover of Eily O'Connor turns up—a saucy dram-
#. good-hearted son of Erin, who by putting matters
in their true light, brings her to her senses, and a jolly old priest, Father
Zom, who is attached to the family in general and to the whiskey bottle
in particular, makes her take a tremendous oath that she will never part
with the certificate as long as she lives. Mr. Cregan goes off in a rage
and the curtain falls on the First Act.
“In the next we find the Danny Man (whose moral obliquity is only
equalled by his crooked aspect) suggesting to Hardress, that, if he
should desire any stronger measures used, he need but send him his
ſº and may leave all the rest (i.e., assassination of the Bawn) to
im (D.M.). Mr. Cregan naturally resents this proposal as not only
too horrible to contemplate, but also as extremely impertinent, and the
Danny Man is in imminent danger of being throttled for his pains,
This, however (after the Irish fashion), only increases his devotion, and
under this influence, he unfortunately meets Mrs. Cregan, who is
struggling between pride and love and . and making a proper
º: of the three. Thinking it wou d be a capital thing to
t rid of the Bawn, that lady, without, inquiring into particulars,
rings him the glove as from her son, and with a little show of con:
science, the Danny Man sets off on his errand. To cut matters short,
the poor, Baton is easily persuaded to accompany him—and he decoys
her in a boat to the Water Cave, where in a most heartless manner he
pushes her into ‘the briny.” Of course, immediately afterwards he is
stung by remorse, and it is perhaps owing to the awful effects of this
passion on his personal appearance that he is mistaken for an otter and
shot then and there by Myles na Coppaleen, who has come down to the
Water Cave on a little private business in the distilling line. Fishing
about in the water for his otter, what should he come upon but the
cloak of his old sweetheart, and her own dear self at the end of it!
That is quite º for him—before you can say Jack Robinson, in
he goes º regular header, only there is no splash), and after about a
minute of intense anxiety, is seen making his way through the water,
and at last bearing Eily O'Connor to the rock whence she was thrown.
Then the Curtain very properly descends again.
. “The Third Act, I confess, I do not clearly understand. The Bawn
is rescued, that is certain, and the Danny Man scrambles to shore
somehow, in time to make his confession before paying the just penalty
for his wickedness. This confession is partly dotted down by Mr.
Corrigan, who conceals himself with that object, but it is reserved for
Mrs. Cregan to explain before the parochial authorities that she is the
one who has been most to blame in the matter. By this explanation,
singularly enough, she manages to remove all suspicion of guilt from
Hardress without, incurring any herself. The heiress also sees how
affairs stand, and bestows her hand upon the faithful Daly. The Bawn
is restored to the arms of her husband, and forgives him like a good
fond foolish wife as she is. But to descend from matrimony to money
matters, how do the Cregans º over their difficulties? Does good Miss
Chute come to the rescue, as I believe she expressed a wish to do in
the early part of the play? or does Mr. Corrigan forfeit his claims, or
do Hardress and the Bawn live º on nothing a year ever after-
wards? Rapt into a phase of meſodramatic excitement, I forgot to
cross-examine the Muse on these points, which after all, are not of
much importance. ...I enjoyed my evening very much, as I believe most
of the spectators did, if we may put any faith in bravos and brass
ferrules. To my mind, one looks on at a play with additional interest
when the author is included in the rôle, and whatever may be the
opinion of the learned regarding MR. Boucicault as a dramatist, there
can be little doubt of his merit on the boards.' I can hardly imagine
a better St Irishman, and if you have seen the ‘Colleen Bawn.' I
make no doubt you will agree so far with

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CAUSE of THE
ROMISH CRUSADERS.
THERE was a time not far away,
When CULLEN's Church the wisest schooled;
Kings governed with unbridled sway;
And priests the ruler's conscience ruled.
How high attained the human mind?
A holy Mother formed it then;
She had the teaching of mankind,
And should have made them noble men.
Ah then the world, for some brief space,
Beheld the reign of truth and good,
And, lessoned by supernal grace,
Ian's dues and duties understood;
But rarely then were subjects moved
º: their monarchs to rebel:
For Princes in their conduct proved
The right divine to govern well.
Yes, then hard hearts were taught to feel;
Then scourges tore the scorner's back;
Then bones were crushed upon the wheel,
And sinews snapped upon the rack.
The tongue that uttered words of sin
as then torn out by zealous ire,
Aud misbelievers' living skin
Hissed, shrunk, and crackled in the fire.
Alas! offenders now atone
Their crimes by torment scarcely more;
Subverted is the Bourbon's Throne,
That did some wretches force to roar.
The groan, the shriek, the scream, the wall,
From cell and scaffold cease to rise;
No roasting heretics exhale
Unwilling incense to the skies.
Ages of Faith, will you revive,
And miscreants shall we *: behold,
Whipped, mangled, maimed, and burnt alive,
As in the pious days of old P
Or have the wise, the good, and brave,
Been º with devotion fired,
In vain, that Dynasty to save
Which those delightful times inspired :
A NEW OPENING.
THE way, in which our streets are torn up at the present moment
affords an admirable opening for street conjurors and posture-mongers,
of which our al fresco professors liberally avail themselves. As the
thoroughfares are impassable for vehicles, they have the street all to
themselves, and they can carry on their gymnastics without the slightest
interruption. When half-a-dozen Risleys have built themselves into a
living, pyramid almost as tall as a Manchester warehouse, they can-
not pick themselves quickly to pieces, a Bounding Brick of Babylon
at a time, as often as a PICKFoRD's van is seen in the distance gallop-
ing, with the speed of a fire-engine, towards them. The consequence
is, that the wearers of pink fleshings have been doing a rare sweeping
business lately, which is likely to continue until such time as our
Paving Commissioners and Gas Companies force them to shut up
shop, by closing the chasms that are such profitable mines of
wealth to all followers of the haute gymnastique. The only drawback
is, the fear that occasionally possesses the aspiring gentleman who
acts the apex of la Perche, of falling some thirty or forty feet to the
bottom of a most uninviting sewer, that he sees yawning beneath
lin.
It is not at all pleasant to think that the smallest hesitation, the most
trifling deviation from the right line of conduct, on the part of his
confrère who is performing, the part of base below, might cause him
at any moment to play the º character of MARCUs. CURTIUS.
The apprehension takes away materially from the F. that ambition
has generally in reaching the summit of its wishes; nor can the poor
posturer, who, poised in the air, is girouetting, like a corporeal weather-
cock, in front of the attic windows, be buoyed up much with the con-
soling conviction, that, supposing he were to leap into the gulf, his
country would gain anything by it, or even be grateful for the sacrifice.
We doubt if the sewers would close any the quicker. Another draw-
back is, that these exciting performances distract the attention of the
workmen a great deal too much. The bold navvy leans upon his pick:
axe, and stares his eyes out with admiration, quite unconscious of
the rolling hours. We cannot blame him, for human nature loves play
better than work; but still we see clearly that, unless these moving
distractions are made to move off altogether, our streets give every
promise of being, like the Haymarket Theatre, open all the year
round.
Is there no Early-Closing Association that can look into the matter,
and get these million-and-one cruel incisions into the bowels of the
earth to close a little earlier. If they would close at two o'clock on
the Saturdays only, still it would be a great boon, and would go a long
way to make matters a little smoother. Rent-day, we believe, comes
in the country not more than four times a year, and in Ireland, some-
times, it never comes at all; but in London it is rent-day every day
throughout the year, and so sadly is every thoroughfare distrained upon
in consequence of these numerous rents, that we have scarcely a stick
or a stone that we can call our own.
Couldn't the Paving and Lighting Commissioners come to some
arrangement to open only one or two, and not all the streets, at the
same time P Or are the present regulations intended as a punishment
upon all those pitiable parties who are compelled, less from choice than
necessity, to stop in town . It may probably be our own fault. It
serves us right, if we do inhale gases and other perfumes unregistered
by DELCRoix, and other perfumers who take the nose of the public in
hand. By rights, we should be at Brighton, or Leamington, or Scar-
borough-anywhere but in this unpleasant London. - -
In the interim, if there is any inquiring foreigner who is anxious to

THE TRIO AT WARSAW.
WHEN VICTOR first began to reign
Without the º: leaves,
He much alarmed three mighty men;
And two of them were thieves:
The first he was a Russian;
The next he was a Prussian;
And the third he was a little Kai-ser:
Three Despots altogether.
The Russian chafed with scorn;
The Prussian spun a3. ;
And the little Kai-ser waxed red with wrath,
And all three Sovereigns warm.
The Russian was choked with self-will;
The Prussian made swallow his yarn; ,
And the Rebels did away with the little Kai-ser,
With his Charter under his arm.
EXCITING RACE.
Last week there was a most exciting race in the Strand between a
fire-engine and a Pickford's van. The former had the start, but was
soon caught up to by the latter. The pace for about, ten minutes was
terrific, we might almost say, killing—but #. the Pickford's
van won by a good couple of streets. Only five children and two old
women were thrown over, fifteen apple-stalls upset, one costermonger's
donkey seriously injured and not expected to survive, besides an ol
gentleman and a commissionaire, who were carried to the hospital,
and lie in a very precarious state. The winner was taken to the station
house, and weighed in the scales of justice, whereupon, some little
irregularity being detected, he was detained. This irregularity simply
arose from the fact of his being considerably overweighted with liquor.
THE PENNY WEDDING.
... We are happy to state, that a marriage which has been for a con-
siderable time on the sawdust has at length taken place. On Monday
the 22nd ult. was solemnised in the Chapel, Fetter Lane, the union §f
MoRNING STAR, Esq., adopted child of John BRIGHT, Esq., of Bir-
mingham, M.P., with Miss DIAL, surviving child of A. GREAT MISTAKE,
Fleet Street. The bride had long been in a delicate state of health,
owing to her having been unfortunately submitted to empirical treat-
ment, and at one time had scarcely been expected to linger through
another week, but it is hoped that the º alliance now made will give
her a new lease of life. ... Her husband, though not very well educated,
and though at times inclined to be coarse, has a manly English character,
and Miss DIAL, though brought up as a rigid Dissenter, has already
seen the folly of fanaticism, and has accompanied her new lord to most
of the theatres, to Newmarket races, and other scenes of which she
was lately in the habit of speaking with the shyness of ignorance. We
take much interest in the fortunes of the wedded pair, and trust that
they will be blest with a large issue.
A Table of Contents.
A.TABLE that answers to every rap of the Spiritualist, and answers
precisely as the Spiritualist wishes it, or a table that moves according
to the desires of the fools that are circled round it, and is as easily
moved as a cook with a novel in penny numbers, or, better still, a
table whose legs will begin cutting capers, and then flies off into the
Post-Horn Galop round the room, and winds up by dancing the College
d| Hornpipe on the ceiling, such a table is indeed a Table of Contents.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
sº-
THE DRAG ON THE TREASURY COACH,
THE Treasury Coach is a ticklish machine
To tool without perilous jolting,
To shave kerb-stones keen, and to turn corners clean,
And keep leaders and wheelers from bolting;
And the Jehus who drive, should be keenly alive,
To the rule, which the best for their tribe is,
Who would scape purls and pitches in kennels and ditches—
“In medio tutissimus ibis.”
JoHN BULL has good pluck, and firm faith in his luck,
And likes a bold rate of progression;
It’s hard to make him shy, but that son of Minshi
BILL GLADSTONE did that all last session.
He went off at a º: to try linch-pin and trace,
Galloped up-hill and down—helter-skelter-
Spite of warnings and shouts, from both insides and outs,
Bad roads, and a weight more than welter.
As for nursing a nag, or attaching the drag,
Or heeding “wo-hoas” #. Warners
Or heavings and pitches, or kerb-stones and ditches,
reaming pikemen, short turns, or sharp corners—
To such cautions a stranger, a scoffer at danger,
He swore he would show each old fogy,
He was not to be schooled how the coach should be tooled,
In defiance of bugbear or bogey.
The Treasury trap, by a merciful hap,
Through its stages he ended by getting,
Though the wonder was vast, that he didn't at last
Succeed the old coach in upsetting.
And when JoHN BULL jumped down, at the sign of the Crown,
—Amazed he had not had a tumble—
Says he, “Next time you drive, sure as I am alive,
'll send a safe guard in the rumble.
“LAING's all very well, o'er the way-bills to spell,
To look after the parcels and so on
But he’s not the right stuff—not half cautious enough—
A coach tooled by GLADstoNE to go on—
With a chap at the ribbons, who doesn't care fippence
For his own neck, or passengers' either,
There's need of a man, who'll do all caution can,
By help of the drag, to risk neither.
“If BILL must be endured,” JoHN told PAM his old steward,
“You look out 'mong the chaps in my service,
For one you can answer is not a Draw-can-sir,
But rather inclined to the nervous—
And just hint on the quiet, if GLADSTONE runs riot,
He isn't obliged to obey him—
The more spokes in his wheel he can put I shall feel
The better he earns what I pay him.”
Says old PAM, with a wink, “well, I really think,
ºve a lad that just meets your directions;
He’s as cool as a fish, with a natural wish
To make, if he can't find, objections.
He's staid, and he’s solemn, talks shop by the column,
Spins red-tape by the yard On Occasion :
I don't want to brag, but if he spares the drag,
Say I can't twig a fellow's vocation.
“FRED PEEL is his name, at hard work he is game,
He don't care in whose teeth he runs rusty;
And GLAbstone will find, if to ride rough inclined,
FRED quite as inclined to cut crusty-
SoH. up—you FRED. . . . . see BILL don't get his head,
w § he try all he knows of soft sawder;
To the drag have an eye, and remember, my bo p
You’re put there to keep WILLIAM in order.”
Another such Victory, and they are Done For
THE Minister of War of the KING OF NAPLEs, in his report on the
Battle of Volturno, claims it as a victory. The Neapolitan troops may
henceforth, pride themselves on having one characteristic trait in com.
mon with the English, for it is very clear “they do not know when
they’re beaten.” However, there the resemblance begins and ends.
BERLIN WoRSTED–What Berlin certainly will be, if ever she is
foolish enough to have a quarrel with London.
A PROSPECT FOR POISON-MONGERS.
(View of the Mill.)
WE are very much obliged to the Recorder of Hull, and author of
Passages from the Diary of a late Physician, SAMUEL WARREN, Esq.,
Q.C., for having, in his address to the Grand Jury, at the late Quarter
Sessions, delivered a valuable summary of the last session of Parlia-
ment's legislation. Herein he specified one particular statute, contain-
ing a provision calculated to have a most beneficial effect, if it is but
duly and fully enforced. This Act is c. 8, which provides by section 1,
for the punishment, with a long term of penal servitude or imprison-
ment, of “any person unlawfully and 'maliciously administering, or
causing to be administered to, or taken by, any other person, any
#. or other destructive or noxious thing, so as thereby to endanger
fe or inflict any grievous bodily harm; ” a crime which it constitutes
felony. Having stated thus much, MR, WARREN proceeded to inform
his audience, concerning this same wholesome act for the discourage-
ment of attempting to poison, that—
• By the second section, the doing so with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy any
person, is declared a misdemeanour, punishable with or without hard labour for
any period not exceeding three years. By the third and last section, if a jury be
not satisfied as to the prisoner being guilty of felony under section lst, on an indict-
ment charging it, they may find him guilty of the misdemeanour under section 2,
if satisfied that he is guilty of it."
Now, then, deleterious lollipop-vendors, grocers who sell coloured
tea, and all the rest of you dealers in adulterated food, look out. If
ou, serve your customers with poisoned articles you will be º
iable to an indictment for felony, and even if that cannot be sustained,
it will be for the jury to consider whether, in selling people permicious
eatables and drinkables for the purpose of cheating them, you are not
“unlawfully and maliciously administering or causing to be adminis-
tered” that which may rightly be described as “poison or other
noxious or destructive thing, with intent to injure, aggrieve, or annoy”
those whom you defraud. Prepare your goods for the market, there-
fore, with the fear of the treadmill and the crank before your eyes.
You publicans also, mind what beer you sell, and be careful how you
purvey public-house port. Take heed lest §: let yourselves in for
three years. . The same caution should be observed by all those who
pretend to give wine to others, and give something else, or give bad
wine; a cruelty and a wrong which is sometimes committed by other
#: than landlords, and which richly merits imprisonment with hard
abour.
WELLINGTON WOLUNTEERS.
AT the instance of the Early Closing Association, the principal boot-
makers in the Edgware Road and the western part of Qxford Street
have agreed to shut up shop every evening, except Saturdays, at eight
o'clock. It is to be hoped that this step will prove to have been the
commencement of a general Bootmakers' Early Closing. Movement.
flººr. the various persons employed in the boot-trade, it is obvious
that the Boot Closers are at least as much interested as any in the
promotion of early closing, for which purpose they should redouble
their endeavours to close every boot confided to their hands as early
as possible. It is a pity that the bootmakers cannot participate in the
benefit of the Saturday half-holiday, which it may be thought that they
might enjoy if ...'" in general had their wages paid them on
Fridays ; but the demand for new boots and shoes on º: of the
industrious classes, inseparable from the eve of Sunday, willtº:
forbid the proprietors of Golden Boots and Noah's Arks, if not the
Makers to the QUEEN and the Aristocracy, to put up their shutters
much before twelve o'clock on i. night. Otherwise, the libe-
rated bootmakers’ shopmen might go and contribute to the sº
Review, or at least assist, at the drill, of Rifle Volunteers, whic
g; takes place in Hyde Park, “or some other suitable place” on
aturday.
Having served their customers, they would then learn how to serve
their country, if their country should ever require their services;, but
let us hope it never will. It is often jocosely said, that there is nothing
like leather; but a bootmakers’ brigade would doubtless prove that
remark to be one of the many true things which are said in joke, by
the “leathering” which they would administer to their adversaries;
The sons of CRISPIN are generally celebrated for combativeness, and
no class of young men would be more prompt than the bootmakers to
aid in repelling any enemy who might come here in quest of booty;
No doubt many of them will avail themselves even of the limited
leisure, which is all the time they can at present command, to learn
the use of arms; and, with a view to their encouragement in the study
of this useful art, let us, the next opportunity we have of proposing a
toast and sentiment, drink “Success to the Bootmakers' Early Closing;
and no Heeltaps.”

PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
CHAPTER XXXV.-A FIRST LOOK AT THE LADIES OF THE
FIFTEENTH CENTURY.
uch as it º pain us to
reflect upon the fact, truth
obliges us to state that in
the reigns of HENRY The
Fourth, HENRY The Fifth,
and HENRY THE Sixth,
(which, as every baby knows,
embraced the interesting
period between the first day
of October in 1399, and the
fifth day of March in 1461,)
| the ladies certainly com-
mitted many an offence
against good taste in their
costume, and their head-
dresses were perhaps the head
and front of their offending.
So gigantic were the struc-
1ures they erected on their
heads that doorways, we are
told, had to be altered to
admit them.” Indeed such
was their absurdity, that
one of the most courteous
N of writers on costume is
N constrained to say the head-
* dresses of these three HEN-
Rys' reigns were “certainly
as ugly and unbecoming as
can well be imagined;” and
when one looks at thestrange
specimen with which we
head this chapter, one must
confess that there appears
to be great cause for this
complaint.
In general, variety is reputed to be charming; but this can hardl
be asserted of the coiffures which were fashionable during the fifteent
century. There was abundance, of variety, but very little that was
charming in the monstrosities that ladies took it into their heads to
Wear Nº. them. . In the reign of HENRY THE Fourth the fashion
was to have the hair still gathered in a caul; but this, instead of being
fastened closely round the head, was projected at the sides, and
flattened at the top, so that ladies looked as though they carried
baskets on their heads, and made their back hair serve by way of
porter's knot. In the following two reigns flat crowns went out of
fashion, and it became “the thing” to wear large high and heartshaped
head-dresses, which sometimes were exchanged for a more pointed
style of coiffure, that, gave its wearer the appearance of having grown
a pair of horns. Turbans of oriental form were also worn occasionally,
and now and then a roll of cloth or silk was wrapped or folded round
the head, and all the hair was combed straight through it in the manner
of a .*.*. thence dangled down the back.
The horned head-dress was, however, the one that was most fashion-
able, perhaps because it clearly looked the most ridiculous. What the
horns were made of we cannot state precisely, for the mysteries of the
toilette are not to be revealed by a modest and male pººl. It is enough
for us to hint that they projected from the ladies “like the crested
honours of the brute creation,” as one of the most elegant of writers
has expressed it: , and that sometimes from their tips behind, there
was suspended a short veil, which served to give a sort of background
to the face. Whether ladies ever played at "Buck, buck!”, with each
other, and asked how many horns they held up on their heads, is a
question of so little value to our work, that we care not to decide it by
so much as a toss up. It puzzles us, however, to guess what other
good there could have been in wearing them, and we thoroughly
endorse the opinion of WILL Cox, the learned Finsbury historian, that
the horns were not more useful than they were hornamental.
Of course the Punches of the period poked their fun unmercifully at
these preposterous head-coverings: but it must be owned their jokes
are somewhat of the mildest, with the addition too of being mostly far
too coarse to quote. As a specimen we may mention, that the ladies
who wore horns were declared to “carry about with them the outward
and visible sign of the father of all evil,” and were compared to cows,
From The Brass or BARBARA Dr BERMondseye.
TEMP. HENRY The Fifth. showing The “newest
thing in Bonnets of the PERIOD."
* IsabelLA of Bavaria, Queen of CHARLEs. The Sixth of France, is represented
by Montfaucon as wearing “a heart-shaped head-dress of exceeding size, and some
doe say that shee did carry yº fashion to suche a height that at Vincennes y palace
doors were obliged to be enlarged, for else hir Majesty and eke yº ladies of her
suite, when they were in fulle dress, could not have squeezed through them.”
to harts, to unicorns, and snails, and to all sorts of horned creatures,
perhaps including horned owls. One old writer gives his lips a miso-
gynic smack, as he relates how to a feast there did come a gentle-
woman, having her head so strangely stuck about with pins, that the
company full soon did scorn her from their presence, saying she did
bear a gallows on her skull. Moreover, poetry was launched as well
as prose at these queer head-dresses. LYDGATE, the monk of Bury
who, we are told, was “the most celebrated poet of the day,” produced
a laughter-moving ballad called “A Ditty of Women's Horns,” whereof
the gist and burden is the strangely sage reflection, that pretty women
have no need of horns to make them pretty. As a sample of the sort
of stuff which the “most celebrated poet” of the period could per
trate, we beg to introduce the following mirthful stanza to the notice
of the curious:—
“Clerkes record, by great authority,
Horns were given to beastes for defence
A thing contrary to feminity,
To be made sturdy of resistence.
But arch wives, eager in their violence,
Fierce as tigers for to make affray,
They have despite, and act against conscience,
List not to pride their horns cast away."
One can't help having a doubt of the “wisdom of our ancestors,”
when one reflects that they could write—and actually read—such stupid
stuff as this. What
would become of
Punch (who is clearly
“the most celebrated
poet of the day,”) if,
instead of the
olden lines he week-
y issues from his
mental mint, he were
to palm upon the
public such a pitiful
ditty, full of bad
jokes and worse
grammar as this old
Monk's of Bury,
whose poetry, by
rights should have
been buried with his
bones?
Of course it was
not likely that ladies
should be found to
be more sensible in
other parts of their
costume, when the
were so foolis
about that which
they wore nearest to
their brains. Ex-
travagance and su-
perfluity were their
prevailing faults in
dress; and they had
seemingly no notion of the “elegant simplicity” which has so eminently
distinguished the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, with whom some
of their descendants may perhaps be well acquainted. Gowns, we find,
were worn extremely wide and full, and with enormously long trains,
so that their wearers must have found it cruel crural work to walk in
them. Street-sweepers (if there were any—will MR. TIMBs enlighten
us?) might have, with some reason, approved of these appendages, but
as they must have been continually tripping people up, we think that
no one else about the streets could have thought well of them.
It may be interesting to some ºf our fair readers to learn, that ex-
ceedingly short waists were in fashion at this period; and that it was
thought nice to have them small as well as short may be inferred from
an old love-song we have recently unearthed, and which in the senti-
mental language of the time commences thus:—
“ſtig. 3Lout sºrt hati, a rºt, rth most,
pomnt a mbitt, ſubitt fart:
$t ſtason is, got mtm suppost,
$5tt both too tightlit laſt.”
Without bothering the reader (to say nothing of ourselves) with any
further details and particular descriptions, which, we find (in other
writers) are particularly sleepifying, we beg to upon our artist to
finish off this Chapter for us by giving a true copy of a curious old
drawing, which will amply serve to illustrate the ample bed-gowns of
the period, and the formidable structures which now served by way of
night-caps. The drawing, which is in the famous Whitefriars collec.
tion, will be looked upon as one of great domestic interest, as it repre-
sents QUEEN MARGARET, the wife of our Sixth HFNRy, in the noble act
of carrying her husband up to bed. Such of our readers as have read the

History of England are of course aware that MARGARET was a strong-
minded woman; and this old drawing shows her to have been strong-
bodied also." When we “iook upon this picture” we seem to see quite
clearly why HENRY was afraid of her, and instead of speaking of her as

his better half, used generally to call her his superior three-quarters.
History says that HENRY was, during his last days, as mad as a March
hare, or as cracked as poor Big Ben, (the reader may select which simile
he pleases,), and used to play at cup-and-ball with the royal orb and
sceptre, while he amused himself with singing in a terribly cracked
voice this extremely touching strain:—

A LUCID EXPLANATION.
CLUMSINess is certainly the failing of the Spiritualists. . Conjurors
they may be, but clever they are not. As a specimen of their stupidity,
take the following explosion of one of their great guns, who has been
firing away at Punch and all other non-dupables in a Yankee print:—
• Greatness among men is alone a property of the sensuous world: it does not
belong to the world of spirits. Greatness of mind belongs to the philosophies of the
earth, which philosophies, like the earth, are material, and are subject to the same laws.
No greatness among men goes beyond the boundaries of the love of earth. The right
that we have to claim that the spirits of Washisoton. FENELow, ShakspeaRE, and
NaPolzox are a whit greater than the spirits of their washerwomon and scavengers
is only warrantel by the standard of material philosophy, which to the soul is as a
fiction—is as a shadow of matter.”
Here, then, is the explanation, for which we long have panted
Here, then, is the reason | the spirits of the Great when summoned
by our tables say what is little worth the trouble we are at to call
them forth. The spirit of Solon drivels, and that of Dr. Johnsox
cannot even spell, because wisdom and good language are material
possessions; and not being in the flesh, spirits therefore cannot own
them. Of course, this very luminous and lucid explanation will amply
serve to satisfy minds capable of crediting, what Spiritualists state.
But when ShakspeaRE spoke of calling spirits from the vasty deep, he
surely never dreamed that such vastly shallow reasoning could, in
after time, be coupled with them.
A Stitch in Time.
It appears that the only way to disable such a vessel as La Gloire is
that of contriving to foul her screw. The next invention in naval
warfare will be a Screw Fouler. Will the Admiralty get this want
supplied, or leave the French Marine to make another discovery
involving one more “reconstruction of the Navy.”
THE IRISH ARMY OF MARTYRS.
QH! weep for the hour, when the bullets in a shower
On Erin's brave Brigadesmen at Ancona came ;
Like heroes they did fight
For Pio NoNo's right,
And gilded with new glory Ould Ireland's glorious name.
The odds was one to ten; but what’s that to Irishmen,
Who for foightin', 'tis well known, by constitution are inclined,
With their Clargy in their front,
To uphold them ’ginst the brunt,
The Holy Pope and Cardinals to push them on behind.
On the haythen foemen pour, thirty thousand, if not more,
Agin' the brave three hundred that scorn a foot to yield,
Though a hundred guns rained shot
Almost, if not quite, red-hot,
And the gallant blood of Ireland ran like wather o'er the field.
All in the crimson flood, up to the knees they stood,
And they scorned to ask for quarther, tho’ the gore it rose and rose,
From their knees up their breasts,
O'er the shorter warriors' crests,
And took great O'REILLY's self—bein’ tall-up to the nose.
For hours and hours they fought, and a miracle was wrought—
As, if miracles is ever wrought, why wouldn't it for them
That in Holy Church's cause,
Defyin' Saxon laws,
Enlists, the excommunicate Sardinian foe to stem *
For all the blood that flowed; to the depth that I have showed,
The thousands of the inimy, the hundthreds of big guns,
Every man came out alive,
And the wounded was but five,
And three of them, the Saints be praised, was only sprains and stuns.
There was gallant Peter MURPhy, laid low upon the turf he
Defended with such sperrit, wid 'a scorch on hands and face,
it’s himself that has smelt owdther,
...And no man can brag loudther,
And good raison—wid his whiskers burn’t off upon the place.
And there's valiant DANIEL SAVAge, that the inimy did ravage,
Wid a slight flesh-wound above the knee, that he would niver bend,
To ask the foe for quarther,
If he was made a marthyr—
To the faithful for a pinsion the man I recommend.
And there's glorious Peter NewſN, after killin' six or sevin,
(Not to spake of those he wounded, which was more by a great deal)
In hurts, as deeds, he still is
Like HomeR’s great Achilles,
For the blow that laid him low is a contusion in the heel.
Then there’s MURPHY number two, if a mortial could outdo,
The MURPHY number one, whose wounds above I’ve let you know;
Toyſ MURPHY is the boy,
- Whereby he does enjoy, .
A splinther in his flauk—he marched side-front against the foe.
And lastly Christian prayers I beg, for JAMEs O'BEIRNE his leg,
That afther his surrendther was cut off below the knee—
The only Irish limb–
I'll say that much for JIM—
That fell before the bullets of the cruel Minnié.
Sure the Protestants makes strictures on all the bleedin' picthurs,
And miraculous Madonnas that winks their holy eyes,
And the haythens, I’ll go bail,
Will ridicule the tale
Of the blood that from the wounds I’ve sung, did wonthrously arise.
But in Holy Church's cause, what’s the odds of Nature's laws,
Or the dirty rules of evidence the Saxon loves so well;
Sure, if marthyrs can't be got,
Widout havin' brave boys shot,
We'll shoot 'em upon paper, and that will do as well!
A Photograph whose Like was Never Seen.
We read that there is a new invention (by an American, of course)
that professes to print 12,000 photographs, or stereographs, in one
hour, and all by means of a single negative. That must be almost as
great a negative as FREDERick PEEL himself—with this difference,
that FREDERICK PEEL is a negative that has never yet inade any
satisfactory impression.

Rush onwards regardless of weather.
“Take your seats,” they call out, while I look about,
To get all our boxes together.
Oh! those boxes, and hampers, carpet-bags, and port-
manteaus !
They were but eighteen in all;
But to get them on shore, took some minutes more
Than the train would concede to our call.
With a scream and a groan the fierce monster was gone,
With our six pretty bairns in its keeping,
While we two bereft, on the platform were left,
With no other resource but weeping.
Oh! the sea! the sea! the deceitful sea!
And the faithless Prince of Hales?
Oh! that long long hour at Tilbury,
With its iron-hearted rails!
THE MATRIMONY MARKET.
It will of course be in the remembrance of our readers (who cannot
fail to recollect every precious word we print for them), that a month
or two ago we inserted an advertisement-not in our fly-leaf-which
purported to emanate from a young and single gentleman, who was
desirous of finding a young º: for a wife. The advertiser said, with
equal modesty j truth, that he was accomplished, sweetly tempered,
and possessed of every virtue, including a fine figure, and a fortune
made to match. All he stipulated for in the object of his choice was,
that the young lady should have health and cheerful spirits, and, as an
absolute ...; should be a friendless orphan, that she might not
bring a mother-in-law or other meddlesome relation to vex her husband's
peace.
As a contrast to this simple, and unselfish offer, we beg to call the
notice of our readers to the following, which has actually appeared in
a contemporary print:—
ATRIMONY.-A GENTLEMAN under 30 years of age, engaged in
mercantile pursuits, and that extensively, takes this opportunity of obtaining
an INTRODUCTION to a LADY with a view to MATRIMONY. The advertiser
considers his fortune equal to £12,000, he has a very nice house standing in its own
unds, which are extensive, in a very healthy part of one of the finest counties in
ngland, and if any lady (after an introduction, should that prove mutually satis-
factory) possessed of a sum equal to one-half of his capital, wish or feel inclined to
link her fate with his, he will do all in his power to promote her happiness and
obtain her love. . This mode of effecting a matrimonial alliance may be novel, but
what is a man to do who cannot make his wants and desires known otherwise?
This advertisement is written in a fair and honourable spirit, the strictest reliance
º be placed in the integrity of the writer, and he may be fully depended upon.—
Address, &c.
Here the advertiser does not say so much about himself as did the
orphan-seeker to whom we have referred; but what he says is clearly
not a whit more modest, and scarcely bears upon it more the stamp of
truth. His description of himself is confined to merely stating that he
is in trade, and, in addition to a house which heregards as “very nice,”
he thinks he isº of a dozen thousand pounds. The statement
that he “considers” that his fortune “equals” this, we consider to be
as cool a thing as we have lately heard of; and it surprises us that any
one “extensively engaged in mercantile pursuits” should have ven-
tured to make use of so unbusinesslike a phrase. Men of business
never dream of “considering” a property, to be such and such a sum.
They ascertain by valuation what it really is, and then state in black
and white the actual amount. - - -
Whether he be owner of twelve thousand pounds or not, it is pretty
clear the advertiser wants, to grab six thousand, and we believe this is
the end and aim of his advertisement, Money and not matrimony is
his real object; and so long as she be owner of those six thousand
charms, he will little care what else his wife may have to recommend
her." There are men who are quite capable of marrying for money, and
if they get it, never think how sour their moneymoon may be to them;
As we write for the protection of the weaker-minded sex, we would
put them on their guard against these money-marrying monsters, who
make a trade of matrimony if they do of nothing else. Fine fortunes
are not to be made out of fine words, any more than are fine feathers
the makers of fine birds. A man “extensively en d in mercantile
ursuits,” may, after all, be only a baked potatomerchant; and though
emight “consider”, his fortune what he pleased, such consideration-
money is a rather doubtful tender for the purchase of a wife.

sively thin-skinned should take better care not to be out-at-elbows!

OUR SISTERS IN AMERICA.
In the pages, of the London. American, we read that in New York
there has lately been opened a library for the exclusive use of women.
At first, we sarcastically thought that it must consist of nothing but
novels, but we never were more mistaken, the collection being as
varied as that of the London Library in St. James's Square, only not
quite so numerous. The one is as yet only a baby, -a mere literary
infant, whilst the other has arrived to the full-grown proportions of a
lusty intellectual manhood. The library has met with the greatest
success, and P. and printsellers have vied with each other in
filling its walls and its shelves with presents. “The subscription is a
dollar (4s.2d.) *Year, for those who can afford it, and nothing for
those who cannot.”
Would a similar Woman's Library answer in London? We strongl
believe it would, especially if opened in the evening, when the British
Museum and other libraries are closed. Besides, how many poor girls
are there who caunot afford fire and candle in the evening to enable
them to stop at home after their working-hours are over, and would
only be too glad of such a refuge, where they could improve and amuse
themselves, free from importunities, free from temptations, happy,
warm, and comfortable, until the clock warned them it was time to go
sº Miss Bess: PARKEs as its noble librarian! -
. The PRINCE or WALEs visited the Woman's Library. During the
interview, the following handsome tribute was paid:—
“The room was crowded with ladies. The Prince entered, leaning upon the arm
of the CHANGELlor, or THE UnivERsrºº, and was received by Miss Powell (the
librarian), who, on behalf of the ladies, said, ‘Baron, we are happy to welcome to a
Woman's Library the son of a Royal Lady whom the women in Åmerica regard as
an honour and a pride to all womanhood.’”
Bravo! We little suspected that the Women of America could say
such generous *::: but then it was a live Prince who inspired the
graceful tribute. However, the compliment is all the more genuine
and valuable, as from the great gallantry, amounting to adoration, that

THE SPANISHEREFORMATION.
By all, accounts the Spaniards are turning over a new
leaf in theirs, and are really taking steps towards re-
gaining their lost credit. From statistics ſately published,
it appears, that their home produce and their foreign
commerce, have within the last ten years increased with
great rapidity; and as commerce can be scarcely deve-
loped without credit, we may presume that this has in like
measure been extended. “Better known than trusted”
was formerly the maxim in dealing with the Dons; but
there now, seems to be a hope that as they get less
“knowing” they will gain more trust.
To show that they are on the highway to prosperity,
and wish to smooth all obstacles which beset their path,
the Spanish Government last year obtained a vote of credit
for a milliard of reals, which they are applying to the
improvement of their roads. A milliard of ; reals is ten
millions of our pounds—a goodish bit of money to throw
beneath one’s feet and trample into dust. However, we

laid out; and that the welfare as well as the wayfare of
the country will progress the faster for them. e are
ſº to see the Spaniards begin to mend their ways, for
the path they once pursued appeared the road to ruin. As
Englishmen, of course we take great interest in the
Spaniards, because for such a time we took so little interest
from them. Whether, now they have begun to see the
error of their ways, they may be viewed as being on the
road to reformation, and are likely to “stump up” the
debts they long have owed, we leave to sanguine specu-
lators, if they ; ease, to calculate. For ourselves, we must
confess, that the last thing in the world we should expect
to get from Spain, would be, if we were bondholders, a
shipment of “the Spanish.”

DANCING appears to have been the principal occupation of the illus-
trious personages who chiefly figured in the late Conferences at War-
saw, “Everything,” of greater consequence, says a telegram from
Paris, “was ſimited to short conversations upon two or three principal
points of the general state of affairs;” so that the intercommunications
exchanged by the three crowned heads may be ". to have nearly
resembled those which usually pass between BRown, Jones, and
RoBINson in the Commercial Room, when one of those travelling gen:
tlemen asks another, “What's your opinion of things in general ”
In admirable keeping with the light and lively drama which is now in
course of performance on the Theatre of Italy, the high conferring
parties d themselves chiefly in the dance. Ad hoc the Governor
of Warsaw, PRINCE GoRTschakoff gave a ball; whereat, according to
the Post :-
“The EMPERoR ALExANDER appeared about half-past ten, and remained until
half-past one. All took part in the “Polonaise,’ and amongst the princely persons
who danced in it were the young Cesarewitch of Russia, PRINCE CHARLEs of Prussia
and the GRAND DUke of SAxE-WEIMAR. The number of invitations was between
800 and 400, but amongst these only about 25 ladies could be reckoned on as part-
ners. The Polish ladies were absent as far as possible.”
The Royal and Imperial Absolutists, happily unable to agree in
any scheme to defeat the constitution of an United Italy, were
forced to content themselves with dancing over, the grave of Polish
#. No wonder the ladies of Poland declined to assist in that
“Polonaise.”

in the great business of life, parties as dissimilar as can
be to themselves. Variety of species, both personal and
mental, is thus everywhere maintained; and as variety is
charming, we cannot well regret that this should be the
Case.
..When we see an ugly lout with an extremely pretty
wife, we are naturally inclined to feel a savage sort of
sorrow to see Beauty so mismatched; and we regret that
some fine handsome fellow (such for instance as oneself)
had not had the fortune to save Beauty from the Beast.
Qn second thoughts, however, philosophy and science both
dispose us to contentment with our singly blessed state;
for we reflect that Beauty possibly may have a wayward
temper, and may perhaps be pleasanter to look at than to
live with, Besides, we are consoled by thinking that mis-
matches have a tendency to propagate variety of species;
and if variety were wanting, eccentricity and folly would
in time receive their death-blow, and the fun which is
derived from them, of course would then die out.
It is all very well to talk about “Improvement of Species”
as being the effect of Natural Selection: but if this improve-
ment principle were carried to extremes, it would cease to
be a benefit, and would become an actual nuisance... It is
terrible to contemplate what sad results might follow, if
people were unnaturally select in their selections, and did
not sometimes make mistakes when they take a Miss to
wife. If mutual improvement were the object in all
marriages, the world would get so wise and good that
there would really be but little pleasure left in it. To
persons, of refined and cultivated intellects, , one of the
chief delights in life consists in laughing at the follies of
our fellow-creatures, and this elegant enjoyment is per-
petuated mainly by the widely-spreading practice of Unna-
tural Selection, through which such queer mismatches are
daily taking place.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TYPE OF THE MEDICAL ROGUE,
In an interesting letter on “The Wounded at Naples,” a corre-
i. of the Morning Post, signing himself “EYE WITNEss,” makes
the following statement:—
“The whole things confided to DR. —, who is not an Englishman, but a German
Jew, and who represented himself as surgeon to GARIBALDI (a falsehood), are either
lost or These were the most costly instruments and presents from, I think,
several of the large manufacturers (among which was a case from TURGUson) splints,
bandages, plasters, and other things.”
The name of the medical gentleman of the German nation and
Hebrew persuasion who either lost or the surgical instruments
and appliances which he had been entrusted with, and most probably
them, EYE-WITNEss forbears to publish. This reticence is º:
posed by the British law of libel; which, as worked by British barristers,
and administered by British judges and British *: is the aegis of
dishonest quacks. The publication, however, of a name º as
common in Houndsditch as that of SMITH is elsewhere, would, whilst
involving the risk of a lawsuit, serve no useful purpose. The names of
the patriarchs and princes of israel, now popular in Houndsditch, are
capable of an expansion or contraction . which they are effec-
tually disguised. Moss is an honest Saxon name; but it is likewise
a corrupt alias of Moses. The name of LAWRENCE is one which
several Englishmen have rendered honourable: but LAwRENCE is also
convertible with LAzARUs unconverted. Thus the nominal exposure
of the rogue who pretended to be GARIBALDI's surgeon, and whom
somebody, regardless or ignorant of physiognomy, trusted with goods,
would not prevent him from setting up in London as an advertising
quack, getting his loathsome puffs put into many of the provincial
papers, as well as some which disgrace the London press, and driving
about Town in a conspicuous equipage. -
Transmuting the name which he had rendered infamous, he would
º on a noisome and extortionate practice, either under a variation
of that, or beneath a simply assumed one—foreign possibly or aristo-
cratic. Thus he would, notwithstanding his antecedents, be enabled
to plunder, under pretence of treating, as many simpletons as his
advertisements might attract; youths or adults, who, º, fallen ill
through folly, commit the greater folly of seeking to get well by putting
themselves into the hands of medical advertisers, who pick their
pockets, and ruin their constitutions. It is useless as well as (thank
the law) dangerous, to denounce these blackguards personally; but
happily a description of the tribe is not actionable, and ph .# they
are almost as like one another as rat is like rat. There is also a generic
character about, their very attire. By the study of their features,
especially of their eyes, noses, and lips; by attention to their style of
dress, and particularly the pins and other jewellery by which it is
mostly decorated, these fellows are easily distinguishable from the
decent and respectable part of mankind. mic and characteristic art
has so richly embellished Mr. Punch's columns with portraits of gen-
tlemen of the race in question, that he who runs may read their
distinctive lineaments.
SIMPLE SONGS FOR SIMPLE SINGERS.
SIMPLICITY in song-writing has been of late supplanting sentiment.
Fine language apparently is going out of fashion, and in place of high
flown humbug about pensive eyes and soul-drawn sighs, or breaking
hearts and Cupid's darts, our ballad-writers, now appear contented to
describe the ordinary incidents of everyday domestic life. Things every
whit as common as those of MR. TIMBs, are seized upon as subjects
for lyrical development, and are spoken of in words as simple as the
singers whose taste they seem to suit. From the tittle of a morning
call to the tattle of an evening party, nothing is too frivolous or flimsy
for these song-wrights, who apparently consider that any stuff and
nonsense will do to set to music so long as it has rhythm and occa-
sionally rhymes.
If these simple songs were sung at befitting times and places, really
there would be but little to object to in them. Indeed, we own we
should prefer them to the “h/ill-you-love-me-then-as-nows” and other
senseless twaddle which has emanated lately from the sentimental
school. But the singers of these songs appear to pay no heed to the
fitness of things, which is a philosophic notion quite beyond their
mental grasp. Absurdities in consequence are frequently engendered,
and the reflective mind is pained by thinking what egregious donkeys
#: will make of themselves, in spite of all that Punch and other
uman benefactors can do to prevent them. Imagine how ridiculous
a gentleman must seem who when standing by the side of a piano in a
parlour, bursts out gravely with the statement that he’s “Sitting on
the style, Ma-ry !” where he and that young person once “sat side by
side.” Nor is it much less ludicrous to hear Miss BROWN or Jones,
who has but just left school, tell every one that hears her, that she
“always has a welcome” for them if they happen, to drop in, just as
though she had a house and a husband who allowed her to give general
invitations to whomever she might wish.
After all, however, these simple songs must sell, or they would not
be written; and as we like to suit all tastes, and tempt all sorts of
buyers for our world-pervading print, we may as well just knock off a
specimen or two, which may serve to show the public what we could
do in the song line, if we chose to try:-
I. Il Penseroso.
I’m leaving thee in sorrow, JANE,
I heave a deep-drawn sigh;
A quiver, see, is on my lip,
A tear is in my eye:
And would'st thou ask me whence the pang
That'fills my heart with pain?
'Tis simply that I’m called away
From my dear darling JANE!
I may no longer now delay
The cab is at the gate;
The fare is sixpence extra, love,
If I should longer wait.
Farewell! 'tis business calls me forth
At six I’ll come again,
And bring perhaps a friend to dine
With my dear darling JANE!
II. L’Allegro.
I have always a welcome for thee;
And prithee what more can I say?
So look in some evening to tea,
And then we will go to the play.
Or if you’d prefer, dear, to dine,
*Twill be ºJ.; to me:
Or say that you’ll drop in to wine,
I have always a welcome for thee!
I commonly breakfast at ten;
But if that be too early for yo
It would make me the happiest of men
To see you to lunch, love, at two.
I care not how oft I’m looked up,
Such intrusions are pleasant to me:
Come to breakfast, lunch, dine, tea or sup,
1 have always a welcome for thee!
III. Il Segreto.
I am a merry, laughing girl,
As every one may see;
And I can keep my hair in curl,
And I can make the tea.
I’ve learnt to dance, to sing, and play
As every lady should:
And if I promised to “obey”—
Now, do you think I would?
A nice young man I lately met,
His name I may not tell,
And in the course of the “First Set,”
He vowed he loved me well.
He dances sweetly, I confess,
He owned my pace was good,
And if he asks me to say “yes—”
Now, do you think I would?
DIES NON IN THE MONEY MARKET.
The subjoined telegram from Paris was dated Nov. 1:—
“This being All Saints' Day, no business has been done on the Bourse.”
The same day was also observed as a holiday at our Stock Exchange
—not, of course, merely because it was the half-yearly balancing day at
the Bank, of England, but with a view to express a veneration for All
Saints, which is not generally supposed to be felt by all stockjobbers.
This is a very remarkable illustration of that kind of outward observance
which is simply external. The respect towards Saints, exhibited by
gamblers, must really, be admitted strongly to exemplify the homage
that is sometimes rendered to Wirtue by Vice.
Botchers Extraordinary.
ON the supposition that the Czar, the Kaiser, and the Prussian
Regent will attempt to put a stop to the substantial repairs now in
course of making in the Italian boot, MR. Edwin JAMEs has, we un-
derstand, christened the conference of Warsaw “The Bootmakers'
Early Closing Association.”

THE CONFERENCE OF THE EAGLES.
WELL may the Eagles—lords of sable pinion—
Rear their quill feathers in an angry flutter, . .
When the small birds, that own their high dominion,
With impious insolence begin to mutter - -
Of “Rights,” “laws,” “charters,” “freedom of opinion”
—Words which small birds are not allowed to utter,
Since they, by utterance, unless checked by acts,
Have a strange trick of making themselves facts.
Scenting the risk, his Eagleship of Russia
Was nowise loath a conference to grant
When moved to't by his Eagleship of Prussia;
And though his vein of courtesy was scant
Towards his Austrian Eagleship (once flusher
Of confidence), -as mindful of his want
Of gratitude, when, ready to miscarry,
Russ claws struck down for him his Magyar quarry.
His Eagleship of Austria was invited,
To join the aquiline deliberation—
It's true the footing on which he was cited,
as not quite that of the most favoured nation—
But anyhow these Eagles three alighted
Upon the spot, where on a great occasion,
They had rent Poland's carcase—bound and bleeding—
Into three parts, for their Imperial feeding.
There was the carcase, and there were the Eagles,
Got into conclave, sternly and sedately:
Round them, keen-scented as a pack of Hºgle.
Their ministerial jackals barked elately.
And, clamouring eager—like a flock of seagulls
Over a herring-shoal rejoicing greatly—
The host of birds obscene—vultures and so forth–
Who think meat’s toward, when the Eagles go forth.
Quoth Russia, “Brother Eagles, we come hither
Warned by times big with each portentous omen:
The Eagle's world will soon go deuce knows whither,
Unless we band ourselves against its foemen,
With beaks and talons phalanxed firm together.
Look round on Frank, Sicilian, Magyar, Roman,
All are, or soon will be, free of our tether;
The impious doctrine daily makes its way,
That Eagles have no right divine to prey.
“Europe has once seen an Alliance Holy
Between the Eagles, for the Eagles' profit;
Eagles that would prey safely, prey not solely;
f game be too small for three to dine off it,
That is no reason each should snatch it wholly:
I love my crown, but I would sooner doff it,
Than rob my Brother Eagles of a snack,
Though, by dividing, I went hungry back.
“So let's agree here to make common cause
'Gainst all who to resist us show intention—
Invoking Royal faith and public laws
'Gainst that vile heresy"non intervention,”
Devised to clip Eagles' anointed claws;
Inspiring the small birds to breed dissension;
Raising up noisy rooks and choughs and daws,
To talk of º rights’ and “nationality’—
Subversive of religion and morality.”
“Agreed,” screamed Austria–Prussia screamed “Agreed,
At least, in generals. . Now for each particular-
There’s Schleswig-Holstein, prey to Danish greed,
You’ll help me there—swear by your own St. Nikola.”
“And swear,” quoth Austria, “with swoop perpendicular
On Piedmont to come down, in hour of need;
Her Volunteers and Regulars to scatter all,
If they lay hands upon my Quadrilateral.”
“Help me to guard the Rhine from annexation,” -
Prussia took up the word, with eager scream.
“Secure me 'gainst Hungarian perturbation,”—
Austria struck in, “Break up Italia's dream
Of what those idiots call “regeneration,”
And Unity—the old Mazzinian theme;
Keep up that dear Pope's temporal domination;
ºf back my Bow BALINo to his throne,
And each Italian Eaglet to his own.”
The Russian Eagle hemmed and ha'd and said:
“Hold, brethren—your account of wants is long.
You'll pardon me, if f. instead,
“Nothing for Nothing” is the Eagle's song.
How long were my crown safe upon my head,
If I pushed in, your little games among P
How lon should I boast head to wear a crown,
If I tried setting up all vou’ve brought down?
“I want help too. * treasury wants filling:
Can either of you help me to a loan?” -
“A loan l’” cried Austria, “when I’ve not a shilling!”
“I want a fleet!”—here Prussia heaved a groan–
“To fight, my army's anything but willing;
Then I’ve internal bothers of my own—
Railways to build, serfs to emancipate,
And that Sick Man's still sitting at my gate,
“With France and England sending their ºician.
To try if they can't patch him up to health.
In short, when I consider our positions,
In purse and person, stamina and wealth,
I think I'd best adjourn all your petitions,
And try my old game. Weakness thrives by stealth.
1 really feel reliance now were rash on
Alliances, e'en of our Holy fashion.”
So saying, Russia's Eagle, with a bow,
Gave them a chilling congé and was gone.
And Prussia's Bird, crestfall'n and angry now
That such fool's errand she had flown upon,
Sulks with drooped tail and cloudy knitted brow.
While Austria, shrinking from the sun that shone
Qn Solferino and Magenta's flight, -
Wings back her baffled way to kindred night!
ABSOLUTE CHURCH FREEDOM.
WHAT British Protestant will dissent, from the doctrine thus laid
'down by M. DE MONTALEMBERT, in his letter lately addressed to the
Count DE CAvouh?—
“All the civil and political liberties which constitute the natural regime of civilised
society, far from being injurious to the Church, aid its progress and its glory. It
finds rivalry, but at the same time rights, struggles but arms, and those which suit
it more than any other, language, association, charity. Liberty, however, is not
suited to the Church, except on one condition—that is, that she herself . liberty.
I speak here in my name, without mission, without authority, founded solely on along
experience singularly enlightened by the state of France for the last ten years. But
I say without hesitation—a free Church in a free State is my ideal. • I add that in
modern society the Church cannot be free except when everybody is free. That,
in my eyes, is a great blessing and a great progress. In any case it is a fact.”
Respecting the gº." above laid down, MR. John Bull will
heartily roar Ditto to M. De MonTALEMBERT. The fact, too, pro-
claimed by the amateur Jesuit, only seems not quite so unquestionable
as the theory, because it is not quite so clear. Does M. De MonTALEM-
BERT mean to say, that the necessity of the freedom of everybody to
the freedom of the Church is a fact? . If so, where did he learn that
fact? . In what country is everybody free? The United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland presents a picture, commonly supposed to be
a tolerable likeness, of perfect freedom; at least there is no other
country in the world where everybody is more nearly free. Are we to
conclude, then, that M. De MonTALEMBERT beholds his ideal free
Church in HERMAJESTY's dominions? Here, certainly, that Church
and all other Churches are equally free, and that one, in public esti-
mation, is somewhat more free than welcome. But perhaps his con-
ception of a Free State differs considerably from that entertained by
the majority of other people. A Free State is commonly understood to
mean a State in which everybody, subject to the obligation of not
injuring others, is at liberty to do as he pleases. Possibly the State
which M. De MontalEMBERT would call free, is a State which is free
to do whatever pleases the Church, and nothing more. This seems to
have been the condition of the Roman States in the palmiest days of
the Papacy. The ideal free Church in a free State of M. De Mont-
ALEMBERT, therefore, has had existence : in the States of the
Church when those States were subject to absolute Church Government.
A Family Trait.
At a grand Republican meeting held at Rochester, in the United
States, we notice that one of the greatest speakers was a Senator, from
Wisconsin, of the name of Doolittle. We imagine that this Senator
has a rare number of relations in this country, and it is a very noticeable
fact all over the world, that whenever you meet with a Dool.IITLE, he
is sure to be a great talker.

SHARKS ON THE SOUTH COAST.
S (A Study from St. Harold's.) To Mr. Punch.
-- IR,
“THE Shark is not confined to the tropical seas. The visitors to
our South Coast watering-places may now and then have the satisfaction
of seeing one of these grinning monsters of the deep paraded on a
truck by the fishermen—among whose herring nets he has made havoc
—with a wedge between his toothed jaws, his piratical tail-fin stiff, and
his white belly turned up to the sun. You are expected to pay for the
exhibition, and your contribution, you are assured, goes to replace the
nets he has damaged. Well—a dead shark is no doubt a gratifying
sight, but it seems cruel to exact sixpences for dead sharks, under the
eyes and noses of so many live ones, who are gratifying their predatory
and devouring instincts on every unhappy paterfamilias, who seeks
the sea-side for a sniff of the briny. I felt this strongly the other day
at St. Harold's.
“The sea-shark, to whose manes I was called upon to offer up my
shilling, was, beyond question, a fine specimen of the Chondropterygian
family. He looked as if he could eat anything, and digest everything
he eat. My Natural History informs me the sea-shark is of the famil
§§ In this respect, as in so many others, the land-shark, wit
which St. Harold's has familiarised me, evidently belongs to the same
species. The St., Harold's land-shark is º -
by its obvious delight in unswept rooms, soiled bed-furniture, ſº
glass, and ill-cleaned table-cutlery. And I don't think—to judge by
my weekly bills, the rapid disappearance of my joints, and the alarming
diminution of my bread-stuffs—that his powers of deglutition are a bit
inferior to those of his brother of the deep. -
“I have always understood the sea-shark is omnivorous. One has
heard strange. stories of the telescopes, tobacco-boxes, chain-cables,
and other indigestible articles found in his stomach, when cut open,
along with edibles usually considered more nutritious. But in this
respect, too, the land-sharks of our southern coast seems to be little
inferior to the sea cestracion. One peculiarity in the predacious
habits of the former is their extraordinary relish for condiments. The
squalid,” to judge
º that I found myself debited in stones of salt, pounds
quantity of salt, pepper, anchovy-sauce, pickles, and that cluster of
seasonings, usually lumped under the head of cruets, which they can
dispºse of in the course of a week, is truly astonishing. -
“The land-shark has the advantage over the sea-shark of being
furnished, not only with a most devouring pair, of jaws and an insa-
tiable stomach, but also with that very formidable weapon—a bill. In
this respect, he should rather be classed with the sword-fish, or the
Ornithorhyncus paradorus.
“I had once thought of presenting to my readers the truly appalling
bill which I extracted from my land shark at St. Harold's; but on
second thoughts, it occurred to me that every paterfamilias who has
sojourned on the Sussex Coast could parallel my specimen, so I will
- content myself with a trait in the habits of this predacious family, the
experience of which, so far as I know, is confined to my own case.
Let every paterfamilias who visits St. Harold's take care that the
lºſſ whose maw he falls, is not grocer, as well asland-shark.
“It was my fate to be a victim to this combination of characters.
The sugar was sanded; the tea innocent apparently of all connection
with the Celestial Empire; the milk sky-blue; the pickles pea-green;
and the butter rancid. I remonstrated; I was fiercely chidden. I
tried other sources of supply; the groceries I ordered in were refused
admittance at my tyrant’s door. The fact is hardly credible, but it is
literally true. I—a struggling paterfamilias, with a large family—was
sternly told, that if I lodged over a grocer's I could not expect to be
allowed to have in any groceries from a rival in the trade. He rudely
overrode all my legal pleadings that serfage was abolished in Great
Britain,_that the villein regardant, or adscriptus glebae, being un-
known to our law, his right to make me an adscriptus taberna could
not be admitted; and when I meekly protested that I had not tried
elsewhere till I found what was supplied by my tyrant uneatable,_
especially the butter—I was sarcastically met, ‘ Whº did you expect
I was going to give you my choicest º: '—and the she-shark all
but j me and mine out of the house, bag and bag ºf
with a withering contempt which made my poor wife tremble, that “
º she wanted was the amount of her bill, and that her lodgings were
anybody's money.’
‘Considering that I was at that moment bleeding from every pore-
of pepper, pints
of vinegar, candles for hall-lamps by the pound, and ‘cruets,’ depar
le marché—I did feel it hard that I should be coerced into swallowing
so much more than the normal allowance of sand in my sugar, water in
my milk, and rancid lard in my butter, and I confess I kicked. But
lest other paterfamiliases, less gifted with the power of kicking
should fall into the same trap, I hereby record my experience, an
recommend them most earnestly not to go and do likewise.
“The moral of my tale is simply, Never LoDGE over A ST.
HARold's GRoceR; or IF You Do, take cARE to Ascent AIN FIRST,
THAT you will BE AT LIBERTY to Buy YoUR GRocłBIEs where
You Like. “Yours respectfully,
“Thomas GREENLEAF.”

SEWERAGE AND SALMON-FISHING.
THis paragraph smacks sadly of the penny-a-liner flavour; but the re-
flective mind will find it not unpleasant food for mid-day rumination:-
“THE MAIN DRAINAge.—RETURN of SALMon to THE THAMEs.-Many years since,
before the introduction of steam navigation and the sewage was allowed to pollute
our noble metropolitan river, it was the resort of splendid specimens of that piscº-
torial delicacy, the salmon. Latterly, however, neither angling or netting could
F.". a single fish of that description, but the partial purifying of the river, which
as been progressing for the past year, together º the diversion of the main
drainage, and the absorption of the smoke of the steam-boats, appears likely to
reproduce the abundance of salmon in our noble stream. During the past year one
of this fish, but of a moderate size, was caught off Erith; but yesterday one of a
very large size was captured near the same spot, which was forwarded to MR. C-,
of Pimlico, purveyor of fish to HER MAJESTY. It attracted much public attention,
and it is generally believed, when the main drain is fully carried out, and other
general improvements effected, that the Thames and its tributaries will again abound
with those shoals of salmon for which, in the days of Isaak Waltos, and long
subsequently, they were so celebrated.”
The connection between salmon and main drainage may not at first
thought appear obvious or pleasant; but on more mature reflection,
the mind is led to think of them as separate and distinct, although they
may by accident be named in the same breath. It delights, one to
reflect that the Thames is being purified, and that the main drainage
is progressing as it should do, and is draining something more than
the pockets of the public. But to the contemplative mind, and in
especial before dinner, there is something more delicious in considerin
the statement that salmon have renewed their visits to our river, an
have been caught, so to speak, within a fly’s-throw of our doors. ...We
can fancy the delight of our good friend MR. BRiggs when he reflects
upon the sport which appears to be in prospect, and how eagerly next
season he will practise in his water-butt so as to be in readiness for
fishing in the Thames. Nor can it afford us much less pleasure to
imagine the transport of enjoyment of our fish-devouring gourmands
when they learn they have a chance of seeing salmon caught and
cooked for them at Richmond or at Greenwich, without the fear of
finding in it any soup, on of town sewerage, or flavour of main drains. ,

through. I guess as heow the Mayors haeve, bin as plaguey as
the Misses; and receivin' deppitations is pretty nigh as trying to the
narves as doing dootongs. - -
“Wal, the visit’s over now, and he’s done it like a Prince, and I

liquor with him) that ar account, I say, should be printed in gold

“Of course it worn’t to be expected in such a tower as this,

say, it worn’t to be 'xpected that all should go as sweet as sugar, an

so long as they air, made so. Them ar Orange boys, I. reckon, were
plaguey aggrawatin', and desarved a smart cowhidin'; if they didn’t
tar and featherin’. And here’s another critter I'd have chawed up
orter small if I’d chanced to come across him:—
“At three o'clock the carriages entered the arena to convey the distinguished
visitors from the grounds. After riding entirely around the arena, the Prince
acknowledged the waving handkerchiefs, &c., by raising his hat: the party went
outside the amphitheatre and rode around the track, and passed out at the western
gate, receiving everywhere demonstrations of high respect. Business was generally
suspended in the City, the Post Office and Banks being closed. The Prince returned
to his hotel, and was again overywhere cheered. He was followed all along the
route by a smart Yankee in an advertising waggon, covered with bills eulogising his
clothing store.”
“This is what the Herald tells us happened at St. Louis, and, as a
trade trick, there’s no denyin' that it’s smartish. indeed, I don’t
mind sayin' that it hully puts the kibosh on that scissargrinder's
dodge, of making his name public in connection with the Prince's by
presentin’ A armchair to his Riyal Highness. Wal, perhaps the best
excuse as one can make for this “smart Yankee” (I wonder if the Riyal
band º: Wait for the Waggon! as he passed in the gº." is
that there was a big hoss fair when the Prince went tu St. Louis; and
hoss-dealers ain't over mice in what they du, and so perhaps the
Yankee's dodge was done at their suggestion. If it worn’t, I’d say
St. Louis was as full of asses as Cincinnati is of pigs, else I reckon the
“smart Yankee” would have been made to smart for it.
“But, arter all, these countertongs must be expected in A country
where the º le air so all-fired fond o' sticking to the counter. On
the whole, the Prince's Visit has been A Great Fact, and if he chose
to come agin I guess.'t would be A greater. Here’s a prophecy of
what might happen if he did, and there’s many of our bhoys who’d
lend a hand tu realise it:—
When the Prince was seated in the car yesterday morning, an Irishman was
observed giving vent to his feelings in a manner that showed he was fairly over-
come with enthusiasm. After showering a score of compliments upon the #.
he £. the coup de grace by swinging his hat and shouting, “Be dad I and come
back here four years from now and we'll run you for President 1' The Royal suite
were greatly amused at this unexpected invitation, and the Prince came near tum-
bling from his seat in a paroxysm of laughter.”
“There’s a smack o' penny-a-liner flavour into this here; but I
reckon for all that there’s a goodish some of sense in it. Jist you talk
it over at the Palace neow, old hoss, and see if you can't manage tu
arrange another visit.

and Stickings.”
THE LORD MAYOR'S BANQUET.
(By our Special Reporter.)
LoRD Mayor's Day was duly kept on the 9th, and none of its
ridiculous features were omitted. An unusual number of pickpockets
were in full occupation during the morning, plundering people who
were silly enough to stand and stare at the most imbecile Show con-
ceivable. Some Wolunteers were kind enough to come, chivalrously,
to the rescue of the effete, old exhibition, and, by marching between
the Bumbles and the Gobblefats, to try to infuse some spirit into the
display. But the MAYoR is a Fishmonger, and the scaliness of the
whole business showed his attachment to his Company. His Lordship
has appropriately selected the Ordinary of Newgate as his Chaplain,
an appointment which testifies to the LoRD MAYoR's conviction that
the mummery is moribund.
Guildhall was done up in the usual flaring way, and gas was turned
on regardless of expense, which extravagance the City can well afford,
considering its plunder out of the Coal Duties. The Gobblefats came
early to the dinner, and secured good places. The Swells, of course,
came later, and some of them were shouted at, in accordance with the
ordinary rudeness of Civic people. Dinner having been devoured
speechification set in with much severity. After the Loyal Toasts ha
been “got over,” as the Citizens disrespectfully put it,
The LORD MAYor proposed the Army, Navy, and Volunteers.
GENERAL PEEL said that he had nothing to do with any of those
departments, of the Service, and had been a member of the late
Ministry, and was not in this one. He could not imagine what the LoBD
MAYOR was thinking of in calling npon him, but supposed there was
some blunder. However, as he was up, he might as well return thanks
for the toast, and congratulate the sleek Citizens upon having three
such services to defend their bales and puncheons.
The DUKE of Somerset said that perhaps GENERAL PEEL would at
all events be good enough to hold his .#. about the Navy, which
was his, the Duke's, business. He should like to hear anybody say the
Navy was not all right, and he begged to return thanks.
The Lord MAYon gave the Ex-Lord MAYOR.
...ALDERMAN CARTER said that he had tried to do his best. One of
his little boys had told him that there was a fable about Hercules and
the Carter, and that it meant that we were to put our shoulders to the
wheel. He had put his lips to the weal at dinner, and very good weal
it was, but that was not the question now. He, ALDERMAN CARTER,
had pulled out of the way with his cart, and hoped the new MAYOR
would go a-head.
The Lord MAYor gave the Foreign Ministers.
Count PERSIGNY in reply said,
MILoRD MAIRE, et Messieurs.-Ilest un grand bore d’avoir de venir
et manger avec vous épiciers, et d’avoir un mal de tête avec votre
maudite gas, mais c'est mécessaire quandle diable estle Jehu. Mon dieu,

contraire, et vous pouvez dormit confortablement dansvos lits., C'est

mes chers amis, pourquoi combatter avec ceux qui se donnent, franche-
ment et avec humilité, d'être dépouillés. ". tranquillement,
: º et croyez que nous sommes raisonables. MILoRD MAIRE,
agreez, &c.
The next toast was the LoRD CHANCELLOR.
LoRD CAMPBELL said that one didn't come to the City for wit but
for wittles, and he had had a very good dinner, for which he was much
obliged. He had been reviewed by GeoRGE THE THIRD, and also
H. he Quarterly, but he did not see how that concerned the present
audience.
The LoRD MAYoR then gave LoRD PALMERSTON and the QUEEN's
MINIsrRRs.
Lord PAIMERston (who was loudly cheered, especially by Lord
John Russell). My Load MAYor, Ladies and Gentlemen. It is an
uncommonly jolly thing to come and eat these dinners sometimes,
though I don't mean to say for a moment that I should like to do it
often. Some great writer, TERENCE or TUPPER, I forget, which, has
observed that out of the conversation of the unwise the truly wise can
gather wisdom, and there is something to be learned sometimes from
Aldermen. We learn, for instance, what to eat, drink, and avoid; that
is to say, to eat their turtle, to drink their wine, and to avoid them.

will be when one of his young gentlemen translates it to him. I am

The Lord MAYor gave the House of Lords and Lord BROUGHAM,
LoRD BRough AM said that he was going to speak for forty years.
(Sensation.) No, no, he meant that he had been speaking during
that time, and very frequently in the City. He hoped often to do
so, again, and was very sorry that M. BERRYER was not in better
spirits.
The Lord MAYor gave the House of Commons and LoRD John
Russell.
LoRD John Russell said that he had perfectly understood M. DE
PERSIGNY, whose French was exceedingly pure, (a bow from M. de P.),
and extremely like that which he, Lord JöHN, adopted in his despatches.
He was very much indebted to M. DE PERsigny for the warm tribute
he had paid to the administration of the Foreign Office by himself
LoRD J. Russell (M. DE PERsigny. “Mon ail/"), and he hoped
long to deserve the praises which had been showered upon him. He
had his own authority and DR. CUMMING's for stating, that so long as
the Foreign Affairs of England were in his, LoRD J. Russell's, hands,
so long would England pursue the exact path delineated for her by a
favouring Destiny.
Some other toasts followed, especially some exceedingly buttery
ones, which were handed round with the tea, and which the medical
gentlemen present recommended, with furtive smiles. There was also
a good deal of music, which prevented a certain amount of nonsense
from being talked and heard. We did not hear of any particular
accidents up to the time of going to press.

to be shot down at Gaëta than be hunted down in England,(as they
will ere long) by Punch. Besides, are they not Italians?' And is it not

Persons of humane and charitable feelings, and the bumps of whose
benevolence are unusually big, might earn our lasting th by taking
º this matter; º enlisting first of all, say, the six or seven millions
of Qrganmen in London, and supplying them with ships and so forth
to depart. It would, we think, be hardly needful to furnish them with
arms, for of course care would be taken that they had their organs
with them, and it would be difficult to give them a more offensive
weapon. An organ in full play is indeed a deadly instrument, and he
must be a bold man who would at short dare to face it. Our
chief fear, in fact, would be that, like the brave Irish Brigade, the
Qrganmen would prove rather difficult to kill, and would come back
like those martyrs to be fºted in the flesh, instead, as we would wish,
of being henceforth heard of only in the spirit.
NO MORE SAXON FOR CELTS 1
AN Irish ºl. and ſº called The O'Donoghue, who is
said to have discovered that Ireland is not a part of Great Britain, has,
in concert with several compatriots, embarked in an agitation for the
Repeal of the Union which connects Great Britain with Ireland. With
a view to the prosecution of their advantageous and hopeful design,
they are about to expose themselves at an assembly which the Nation
announces in the following paragraph:—
“We are happy to learn that our highly-talented and distinguished countryman
The O'Donoghue, M.P., and MR. GeoRGE HENRY MooRE, with other gentlemen of
known patriotism and abilities, have signified their intention to be present at a
meeting in favour of Ireland's right to choose her own rulers which is shortly to be
held in this City.”
Repeal, which an O'Connell §. unable to carry, is evidently
going to be accomplished by the Ö'Donoghue. We are fortunately in
a position to be enabled to explain the means by which the success of
this hitherto impracticable undertaking will be secured. The O'Don-
oGHUE's discovery that Ireland is not a part of Great Britain involves
the equally important discovery that Irish is not English; that the
language of one of these countries differs from that of the other. This
being so, it is felt that a great mistake has been made by Irish patriots
in going on, year after year, shouting for repeal in the language of
DR. Johnson and LINDLEY MURRAY. A man's speech bewrayeth him
all the world over, and The O'Donoghue and his associates find that
they have been howling for Irish nationality in the Saxon tongue amid
the ridicule of mankind. They have therefore determined that the
rights of Ireland shall henceforth be proclaimed in Irish. It is their
intention to harangue their countrymen in the original brogue which
served BRIAN BoRU or BURRoo—or whatever they call him—to express
his ideas, such as he had, and was ‘. by St. Patrick in con-
verting the natives of the Émerald Isle and othering the varmint.
The national language will also be adopted by all the Ultramontane
Press, and * of course by the Nation. By this expedient
;. will be gained, for publishing treason with impunity.
ligious journals will be enabled to express unbounded sympathy for
Sepoys or other sayages undergoing persecution for the slaughter ºf
English heretics. Yelling with joy over the reverses of Britons in wild
Irish, the faithful, intelligible only to each other, will not create that
scandal of which his Holiness the Pope is now reaping some of the
consequences in the influence exerted by England on his temporal affairs;
The O'Donoghue himself, if with the SPEAKER's permission, he shall
address the House of Commons in his native language, will be quite
as patiently listened to, and as implicitly credited as, he would if he
were to solicit the dismemberment of the Empire, abuse the Italian
nationalists, and trumpet forth the wrongs of tortured Ireland, interms
which all his hearers could understand. Erin go bragh! Hurroo for

WE fancy a very pretty Rule of Three sum might be worked out of
the title of a book, which has recently been introduced to the notice of
the public, under the name of the Walley, of a Hundred Fires. If, as
the advertisements tell us, it is possible to get “Four Fires for a
Penny,” it would not be very difficult, we imagine, to ascertain what
the “valley” of a hundred fires would come to. Any school-boy, or
LoRD MALMESBURY, could do it.

We really think the table-turners, and other conjurors and wizards,
should protest against the tradesmen taking leaves out of their books,
and doing strokes of necromancy on their own account. What with
“Magic Strops,” and other marvellous inventions, the apparatus of a
conjuror seems sold at every counter, and feats of legerdemain are now
in nearly everybody's hands. Here, for instance, is a specimen of the
wonders which are worked by advertising tradesmen, who are constantly
attracting notice to some new commercial trick:—
-- º merely pouring boiling water into the inverted lid of BLANK's Patent Coffee

Really, now, this beats the Mysterious Bowls of Gold-Fish, the
Inexhaustible Bottle, and the Cup-producing Hat. We have often
seen a conjuror make hot coffee on the stage, but then he has always
had a pigeon or canary-bird to make it with-nay, has sometimes taken
a leaf out of the cookery-books at railway stations, and has easily con-
cocted it from a few handfuls of beans. In the case quoted, however,
the trick is done without the aid of these accessories, the beyerage
being brewed by merely pouring boiling water on an inverted lid. No
mention is made of iſ: tea or coffee being put into the coffee-pot,
and yet either of these drinks is producible at will by the mere means
we have stated. Both of them, moreover, are declared to be “delicious,”
a statement of the conjuror which, not being a consumer, we cannot
yet endorse. We think, however, that these coffee-pots, if they do
what is asserted of them, cannot be too widely known; and to guarantee
their being so, we make a note of them in Punch. It may influence the
Government in their dealings with the Chinamen to learn that tea can
now be made without the need of tea-leaves; and surely nobody will
dream of paying money for “Best Mocha,” when he can get a pint or
gallon of the most delicious coffee by merely pouring boiling water
upon a bit of tin.

“Equally delightful, it would be to our beau monds to find their manners and demeanour
criticised as freely as their personal appearance. If American reporters had access to our
ball-rooms, I suppose that some such stuff as that which follows would be written of us:—
“At first a slight degree of bashfulness was apparent on the part of the young people of both sexes; but
as the ball progressed this gradually wore off, and the officers to their no small satisfaction had the pleasure
of dancing with any lady in the room on whom they chose to fasten an inclination. * * English formality
and restraint gave way before the winsome manners of the young divinities, and the ball rolled on to the
accompaniment of pleasant conversation, coquettish hallucinations, good music, plenty of room to dance in,
lenty of handsome partners and every other adjunct calculated to make one in such a place contented with
º and neighbours.”
“‘Plenty of room to dance in!” Well, I do think we might copy our Yankee cousins in
this, respect; although we might not care to specify among the other benefits of having a

“But there was something, else besides the ‘winsome manners of the young divinities’
which helped to dissipate the English “formalities’ and coldness:–

private room was set apart for them under the stage,
where had been rolled in a cask of ale and several quarts
of oysters, of which the English are very fond. This was
called ‘Joh N BULL's Saloon.” In a word, every possible
effort was made by the committee to render this portion
of the entertainment especially complete, and it is need-
less to say, that their endeavours to “crowd the stomach
with thrifty fare” met with the most complete success."

oes the reporter mean by hinting the suspicion
that an Englishman can’t dance without the
help of beer and oysters? If I, thought my
cousin, CHARLEY needed such inducements to
make him waltz or polk with me, I declare, I
really think I’d never dance with him again!!
At least, unless, he begged my pardon prettily
and vowed—But never mind alſ that: here's
something much more interesting to you than
Cousin CHARLEY can be:–
“Whilst it is true that there were none who looked like
some of the women at the New York ball, as if they had
just emerged from a diamond shower-bath, there was a
display of jewels and jewellery that bespoke the good
taste and good sense of the wearer. Portland ladies are
celebrated for their beauty and refinement, however,
more than for any mere display of dress, and the gather-
ing on Wednesday in this :*: was sufficient to have
constituted an aurora. * * One of the principal officers,
a dashing young lieutenant, made the remark that he had
seen more real genuine undiluted loveliness in the space
of half an acre, and during half an hour, than he had
looked upon since he left the Old Country. He really
thought American ladies were remarkably ‘arnsome.'
A few minutes after this he was up to his elbows in
compliments, melting away under the delicious fascina-
tions of a terrestrial angeſ in blue—a process he went
through uo less than a dozen times in the course of the
evening.”
“Fancy now the gathering in a, ball-room
‘constituting an aurora.’. What poets H.H.
liners must be in America!. Does that darling
LoNGFELLow, I wonder, write for newspapers?
And how true to life it is to represent a British
officer as speaking of half acres of ‘undiluted
loveliness,’ and sa ing of his Pºrtº that he
thought them vastly ‘arnsome!’ Well, it cer-
tainly is a pity our reporters, like our dancers
are so reserved and formal; T fear that we shall
have to wait a good long while before we find the

ter, and which is accurately
copied from a very rare old
manuscript,” it will be seen
what pains the dandies took
to make themselves ridicu-
lous, and how eminently some
of them succeeded in so
doing. Swells with spindle-
shanky legs appeared to take
delight in exposing their de-
formities, and made them
still more ludicrous by con-
trast with their upper gar-
ments, which were swollen
and puffed out to a prepos-
terous degree. , Special no-
tice also should be taken of
their hats; some of whic
as in this drawing, were t
sugar-loafy structures not
unlike a modern foolscap,
while others looked like
slop-basins with a peacock's
feather in them.
One would think that such
absurdities were hardly worth
the while of grave historians
to chronicle, but Monstre-
LET dilates at no slight length
upon the subject, as does
PARADIN likewise, in his Histoire de Lyons, which Cox DE FINSBURY
conceives to be a work of natural history, and only to bear reference to
the king of all the beasts. Among other information supplied us, by
these writers, we learn, that doublets were cut short, as our artist has
depicted them, and that the sleeves of them were slit, so as to show
large loose white shirts. They were padded in the shoulder with large
waddings called “mahoitres:” + and were worn of silk, of satin, and
of velvet, even by mere boys. The beaux, however, and perhaps the
boys, were as capricious as spoilt children in their tastes and fancies;
and after coming out one day in the shortest of short jackets, the
next would, like great babies, #: about in long, clothes, “soe long
in soothe att times that they º dangle in y' dirt.” . -
Such of our readers as have been to public schools will have derived
at least this benefit from their classic education, namely that they will
not need us to translate the well-known line:–
“Dum vitant stultivitia, in contraria currunt."
Of course we would not be so cruel as to call a swell,a fool; but, with
a softening of the “stulti,” the verse was clearly applicable to dandies
at this period, and we wonder the old writers, fond as they were of
Latin, should not have applied it. Besides their weathercocky ways
in the fashion of their coats, the gentlemen of England who lived in
EDWARD's ‘. veered about as changeably in the shaping of their
shoes. On Monday you would meet a swell strutting a down, Chepe

TEMP. Edward The Fourth.
FROM. An ELABorate WooD-ENGRAVING OF THE
PERIOD.
* This drawing is noteworthy as being one of the first specimens of the noble art
of wood-cutting with which our English literature (the Book of Costumes not
excepted) has been so much enriched. DR. DIBDIN says the art “began to prevail
about the year 1460," i.e., the year before the reign of Edward THE FourTH. Doubt-
less the drawings which illuminate this chapter, and which are all taken from the
artists of the period, will remind the thoughtful reader of the lines in the Excursion,
where Wordsworth speaks of these same “wooden cuts:"—
“Strange and uncouth : dire faces, figures dire,
Sharp-kneed, sharp-elbowed, and lean-ancled too,
With long and ghostly shanks: forms which once seen
Can never be forgotten.”
# This luxury, however, was only for the higher classes. By the sumptuary
statute which was passed during this reign, “no yeoman, or person under a yeoman,"
was allowed bolsters or stuffing of wool, cotton or cadis in his pourpoint or doublet,
under a penalty of a six and eightpence fine and forfeiture to somebody of the
offending garment.

envelopes, and carrying his absurdity to fully as great widths as he had
previously done lengths. Slippers, we are told, were made “so very

broad in front as to exceed the measure of a good foot,” but, whether
they were worn to hide the measure of a bad one, the chronicler is not
so rude here as to hint.
If history be believed, our fourth Epward had not much to recom-
mend him to posterity. One writer (does the reader recollect the
name of EGERTON ?) speaks of him as being–
*— To each voluptuous vice a slave,
Cruel, intemperate, vain, suspicious, brave."
But of this long string of epithets, the only one we need to say a
word on is the third. Vanity being one of the chief failings of the
sovereign, it may be fancied that his courtiers followed his example,
and were unchecked in their preposterous pomps and vanities of dress.
It is true an Act of Parliament was passed for their prevention; and
popular opinion, speaking through the mouths of the street-boys of the
eriod, was doubtſess prone to treat with levity the very heavy swells.
ut neither statutory laws nor the chaffing of the streets have ever
much effect to mitigate the dandyism of the day; and although it was
provided that “no one under a lord” should make a fool of himself by
wearing a short jacket and ºf shoes, and that every tradesman manu-
facturing such articles should be fined a sovereign (and be cursed by
clergy for the shoemaking offence), we will be bound to say short
jackets and long shoes still were made, and that other fools than lords
were found to wear them.
By this sumptuary statute, which was passed in the thirddi. of
the reign of Edward THE FourTH, bachelor knights were forbidden to
wear cloth of velvet upon velvet, unless they were Knights of the
Garter. This is the first tax upon bachelors recorded in our #.
and as the mania for finery, appears to be ºf it might not be
unwise to reimpose some such a hindrance on it. here really is no
§: how it might affect the Census, if single swells were now pro-
hibited from wearing porkpie hats and º and a dozen other
things which we have no space here to schedule.
Unbecomingly, cropped heads, and closely-shaven chins and cheeks,
had been in fashion during the three last preceding reigns; but fops
now wore their hair “so long that it #: come into their eyes, and
wits dyd say they looked like members of y' hairy-stocracie.” Beards,
whiskers, and moustaches were, however, still discountenanced, for the
ladies, it was said, did set their face against them.
But little change took place now in the military equipment. A
modern writer says, that it “presents few striking novelties,” and
indeed the only novel, weapons for striking that present themselves
are the genetaire, or janetaire, a sort of Spanish lance, the you!
which varied slightly, from the old glaive or guisarme, and the halbe
(now first mentioned), whose name doubtless was derived from the
earliest kind of poleaxe, which the Germans, and perhaps the Poles,
called alle-barde, or cleave-all, Swords and bucklers were first given
to archers at this time; for although, like our Riflemen, these soldiers
were intended to fight chiefly at long ranges, it was found that they
were sometimes forced to battle hand to hand, and then a sword and
shield were sure to come in handy.
We have said the Civil Swells were somewhat heavy at this period;
but the Knights, when in full fig, were even yet more ponderous.
Enormous globular breastplates were worn upon the chest, and the
feet were strongly shielded by sollerets of steel, whose long points are

MAyor His showe,” IN 1480.
FIRST, is said to have remarked of the armour of this era, that “it
cannabe denied it was an ower gude inveention, as it heendered a puir
body frae being hurt himsel’, or hurting ither people, by reason of
its clumsiness.”
This in some measure explains the marvels which we read, ot how
knights battered one another, like Hotspur and Jack Falstaff, by
the three hours together, without doing much more damage than just
to make their noses bleed. This however, was providing that they
could keep their seats, for when once a knight came down it was
literally all up with him. The mere shock of his fall was quite enough
in general to knock him out of time; and as he could not anyhow, get
up without assistance, his conqueror could coolly choose the best chink
in the armour to give the coup def". It was for this reason perhaps
that the horses were now armed almost as heavily as their riders,
having shields upon their chests and manefaires upon their manes,
while a strong plate called the chanfron gave protection to the face.
This plate had a sharp boss, or point, projecting from the forehead,
and a plume by way of ornament sprouting up between the ears, in
the manner of the cherry-tree upon the stag shot by MUNCHAUSEN,
The saddle too was made of a peculiar construction, projecting round
the thigh so as to hold bad riders firmly to their seats... A splendid
specimen of this is shown in a quaint drawing in one of the Harleian
manuscripts, where the steed is represented rather bigger than a dray-
horse, and having a cropped mane and absurdly short bob-tail, which
we presume to have been according to the fashion of the time. This
resumption is supported by one of those old lyrics which antiquarians
#. had to thank us for unearthing, and which with the quaint plea:
santry belonging to this period, relates in sixty stanzas how yº gentil

foot—and all honour to him for it—is the “Jus. Regentium,” which in
despotisms, so far from being identical with the “Jus Gentium,” is
recisely the reverse. In the name of “the right of nations,” he over-
ars “the right divine of Kings to govern wrong.”
GUILDHALL AS IT SHOULD BE.
A SADLY inaccurate description of the decorations at Guildhall for
the LORD, MAYOR's Feast last week having crept into the papers,
Mr. Punch has been requested for the interest of the public to furnish
what on Derby-days is known as a “c’rect list”:—
The Lobbies.—These being the entrance-chambers ſeading to the
Banquet Hall, were appropriately embellished with trophies apper-
taining to the culinary art. Stewpans, spits, and saucepots were
clustered at each corner, flanked by frying-pans and gridirons, and
surmounted by a banner with the Árms (bared) of the Chief Cook.
The walls, instead of being whitewashed, were delicately floured, and
festooned with turnip roses and camellias, cut from beet-root. In the
centre of each panel was an elegant medallion, carved to represent the
top of a raised pie. This formed a fitting background for the Statue
of the Chef, moulded from a portrait drawn by Cook, R.A., and showing
that great personage in his robes of office, consisting of an apron and a
white, cotton cap. The Chef is represented in a graceful classic atti-
tude, bearingin one hand a beautiful bouquet of parsley, sage,and onions,
and in the other brandishing a rolling-pin, after the manner of a Field.
Marshal with his bâton. Underneath this figure was inscribed in hard-
boiled whites of egg the suitable quotation,from Comus (slightly altered):
• Two blissful things in here are borne.
Good soup, good meat, the Cook hath sworn 1
The Great Hall.—Here, as every Alderman knows, the Feast of ST.
LoRD MAYoh is annually served, and the embellishments were strictly
in accordance with that fast, Garlands of knives and forks, joined in
happy union, were suspended from the ceiling and glittered in the gas;
while all the statues in the Hall were draped with table-cloths and
napkins, which served to give a chaste and classical effect. The
Eastern window was adorned with a finely-painted allegory, representing
the combined forces of Common Councilmen and Livery preparing to
defend the Good Dinners of the City, and other ancient privileges
which they and their forefathers have so copiously enjoyed. "Over the
chair of state were the portraits º of life) of the LQRD and LADY
MAYokess, each with a large plate of steaming turtle-soup before
them, and underneath, the civic motto:—
Happy, happy, ha MAYo
§.†: º ºth, Fare 1"
Aldermen's Committee Room.—Statues chiefly modern, embellished
this apartment, and as the figures º were modelled from live
aldermen, it is unnecessary to say that they were of great elegance.
A classic group of HELIogobbleUs (the first of ancient Aldermen),
attired by the Graces, very naturally excited an immense deal of atten-
tion: as did a statuette *...* EPICURUs in the act of carving his
first haunch of venison. Appropriate mottoes were inscribed in gold
letters on the walls, one being a neat paraphrase of a well-known old
school couplet:—
“In guttling Turtle every day,
Let my first course be :
And let me hope my relish may
E'en for three platefuls last !”
Loggia of the Erchequer Court.—The decorations, here were of a
severer style. The walls were draped with the paid bills of all the
Lord Mayors' Banquets for the last four hundred years, and on a black
board in the centre of each of the four walls was inscribed the exact
sum total of the money thus consumed. How many millions have been
guzzled and gormandised away since the Cat of Richard WHITTING-
toN, lapped up her first ha'porth at the expense of City Coal-tax-payers,
we leave Economy to groan for and Posterity to guess.
THE TWO KINGS AT TEANO. October 25, 1860.
Victor and GARIBALDI, side by side—
The crowned King and the crownless, hand in hand,
'Neath the blue sky of their regenerate land,
Silent, mid shouting thousands, Lo, they ride!
Not many royal hands so pure of guilt,
As to be laid within that stainless palm,
Horny with grasp of the familiar hilt;
Not many royal looks could brave the calm
Of those deep-seated and unwavering eyes,
Fearful or terrible, as ruth or war
Subdues or i. them. Ride on, to the cries
Of “Long live Italy!” while, near and far,
All good men's hopes bless thine investiture,
onest King-maker, of an honest King,
And pray thy work may stand, till rooted sure,
In spite of friends that as the ivy, cling,
Stifling with wintry green, that shows like spring.
Ride on, WICTOR EMMANUEL, to the throne
From which crowned wickedness hath toppled down,
While GARIBALDI, guerdonless, alone,
Takes his far higher throne, and nobler crown!

A RISE IN BREAD-STUFFS —EFFECTS OF EATING AERATED BREAD,
Poor Cocker having been Recommended to try the “Aérated Bread,” does

A CANON AND A BLUNDERBUSS.
THE Irish Brigade, having returned from those * of Italy which
according to, Cullen, they miraculously purpled with a ver small
jº of blood in the unsuccessful attempt to subjugate Italians to
espotism, arrived the other day at Dublin, where, amid the cheers of
a multitude impatient of the galling yoke of Constitutional Government,
they were harangued by the REv. CANON Pope, who, according to a
newspaper ironically named the Freeman, “came forward to address the
young men of the Brigade, and to welcome them, home in the name of
religion and of their country.” The Reverend Canon then discharged
himself of a tremendous load of unspeakable bombast, but his can-
nonade comprised one particular bang, the report of which deserves to
reverberate. Having told his hearers that they had done all manner of
the finest possible things for their “Holy Father” (the Canon's name-
sake), their “Holy Mother the Church,” and the “Great Catholic
family of Christendom,” he wound up a prodigious period of balder-
dash with the following portentous climax of bosh:—
“And in the blood of your fallen brave ones you have offered up a holocaust on
the altar of religion to the Great God of battles."
This thundering explosion of pompous untruth created, according to
he Freeman, " profound sensation.” No doubt. The sublimity of
solecism was likely to overwhelm the imagination of a crazy rabble,
Of course CANON POPE cannot know that a holocaust is a yictim burnt

he would hardly have told even an Irish Brigade that they had offere
up a holocaust in the blood of their fallen brave. If those heroes had
º CIALDINI, or FANTI, and roasted their victim whole, then there
would have been some sense, at least, in congratulating them on having
offered up a holocaust on the altar of religion—religion of a pecu
kind—to the Great God of battles—a deity whose worship demands
human sacrifices. The less a Popish priest talks about holocausts the
better, even when he does not talk nonsense. A certain artist of
antiquity—a villanous flunkey—wishing to curry favour with a tyrant,
constructed a bull of brass, and presented it to that potentate, for the
purpose of enabling him to perform holocausts in its interior, by burn-
so, and is Discovered, along with his Family, Floating about the Ceiling
ing people alive, there, in the meanwhile enjoying the pleasure of
hearing them bellow. The bull of PERILLUs was more savage than
that of CANON Pope, and besides, PERILLus's bull contained the hold:
caust, whereas CANoN Pope's holocaust involves his bull. This bull
will not make quite the same noise as what may be supposed to have
proceeded from the other one; but the Irish priest, as well as the
Athenian sculptor, must be admitted to have made a roaring bull.
PHALARIs, as our youth are aware, rewarded the ingenuity and devotion
of PERILLUs, by putting him forthwith into the toy which he had
fabricated to afford his patron amusement at the expense of others, and
playing, by way of experiment, in the first instance with himself. The
cruel ingratitude of the Tyrant of Agrigentum, will not be imitated by
the Roman Pontiff, and Pio NoN9 at least will not command CANON
Port to be roasted for his own holocaust.
The Englishman in Prussia.
IN confirmation of a statement, respecting Prussian custom-house
extortion, which appeared in the Times under the head of “Prussian
Insolence,” a correspondent of the same journal, signing himself
“A TRAVELLER,” declares that somewhere in Prussia he was made to
pay 54d. duty on 14 lb. of children’s ordinary biscuits, which the official
who inspected his luggage asserted to be sweetmeats. The customs of
the Prussians appear to be as bad as their manners.
WERY HEAVY ORDNANCE.
According to a calculation which has appeared in the Mechanies'
Magazine, our Armstrong guns, of which we possess 451, have cost the
country no less than £2, a-piece. Truly the Armstrong gun is a
tremendous weapon. We ought to be able to knock La Gloire into
atoms with our two-thousand-pounders.

LECTURE OF A NEW LORD MAYOR.
At the Court of Aldermen held on the 14th instant at Guildhall
when the LoRD MAYOR presided for the first time in his official
capacity, according to the newspapers:—
“His Lordship at the commencement of the proceedings rose and said, “In
taking my place in this Court for the first time as Lord Mayor of the City of London
I cannot fail to foel that I am entering on a post of great honour and dignity, an
that I shall often have occasion to entreat the kind.consideration of §. brethren of
the Court of Aldermen. I feel, however, great confidence in being able to perform
the duties that will devolve upon me, because I know that I may at all times appeal
to my brother Aldermen for the assistance of their experience and wisdom, and I
have no doubt that with such assistance I shall be able to go through my duties in
a manner that will be satisfactory to my brother-citizens, and at the same time
fully support the dignity and privileges of the Court.”
Evidently the above is an incorrect report of the LoRD MAYOR's
observations. The speech which his Lordship really did make was
most, probably, one of this sorti-In making my appearance in this
Qourt for the first time as Lord Mayor of the City of London, I pain.

Hoping, however, to contribute, as little, as possible to the public
amusement, I trust that my brethren of the Court of Aldermen will
excuse me if I occasionally deviate from a precedent which would
require me to make a fool of myself. I entertain some hope that I
may manage to perform the duties which will, devolve upon me
without incurring very much ridicule, because I have determined to
pay no attention to any nonsense which may be .# my brother
Aldermen, and not to allow their advice or opinions to influence me at
all contmarily to my own judgment, in the discharge of my office. . As a
member of the Legislature, accustomed to Fº in the delibe-
rations of an orderly and decorous assembly, I trust. I shall be enabled
to preside over you with that propriety of which the Speaker of the
House of Commons has afforded me an example, and thus, whilst sup-
orting the privileges, very .# elevate the dignity, of this
É. Now then, Gentlemen, silence i {. please; let us proceed to
business, and let me entreat all of you to keep your tempers.
AN UNDUTIFUL PAPA.
CARDINAL ANTONELLI has given CARDINAL WISEMAN the office to
collect Peter’s Pence for the Pope, and CARDINAL WISEMAN has
ordered his clergy to levy the desired contribution. Among the pur-
poses for jº Holiness solicits a “whip” are “the requirements
of his army.” Now, that the Pope's hat should go round among his
faithful disciples simply to collect the means of paying the expenses of
their faith, is all very well; and to that end, they may reasonably be
invited to drop their coppers into the tiara; but do they believe, in the
Papal Army? That is a new dogma indeed, and transcends all con-
ceivable conception.
The truth is, that Prus Papa is a very fast old gentleman; an extra-
vagant papa: a regular pere prodigue. He has been outrunning the
constable in keeping a standing army, if that army can be called
standing which has particularly distinguished itself by running away.
Papa should in all conscience have put, down his expensive military
establishment before he proceeded to ask for pecuniary assistance at
the hands of his children.
An Unexpected Return.
We thought that the principle of “No, Money Returned” º:
to Royal, just the same as to Theatrical houses. However, we have
...; over an exception. The KING or Saxony has returned
to the Chambers the extraordinary sums which they voted last year,
not having any occasion for them. We wonder when we shall see any-
thing of so pleasing and acceptable a nature ever figure amongst our
“Government Returns?”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHO STARTED THE FIRST RIFLE CORPS
OT to use a stronger adjective,
a most unseemly squabble
has been going on in print
as to who first set on foot
the Volunteer Movement.
At least a score of indi-
viduals, not to use a stronger
substantive, have severally
claimed the sole right to be
called the Benefactor to their
country, in sofar as the origi-
nating of Rifle practice is
concerned. Now, without
wishing to make rows, or in
any way detract from any
one's pretensions, CAPTAIN
PUNCH begs leave to hint in
the mildest manner possible,
that everybody living (in-
cluding MR. SMITH and the
EMF BroR of ChiNA) is very
well aware that it was CAP.
TAIN PUNCH who got up the
first Rifle Corps ever formed
in England, and thereby gave
the start to this, world-ex:
citing movement. Any stupid
sceptic who dares to doubt
this fact, is advised hereby to
purchase CAPTAIN, PUNCH's fourteenth volume; where, at page 85, in
the Number which was published, for March 5, 1848, is an article ad-
dressed to “Spirited Young Men,” who were desired to join forthwith
an “Invincible Rifle Corps, to be known as the Punch Rifles.” . This
Corps was gazetted at CAPTAIN PUNCB’s, private Horse, Guards in the
ensuing week, and was by several years the first of all the corps which
have been started, and may be viewed as being the mainspring from
which the movement sprung.
CAPTAINPUNCH, whosemodesty is as well known as his valour, would
not have adverted to these historic facts, but for his anxiety to end the
squabbling aforementioned, which is setting by the ears men who Qught
to be good friends, as they are ſº fellows, and who should know
better than engage in an uncivil war, even although happily it be
merely a verbal one.
GIANT POPE BITES HIS NAILS.
TRANSLATION (VERIFIED) OF A HOLOGRAPH LETTER FROM CARDINAL
ANTONELLI, The Pope's MINISTER, TO A BROTHER CARDINAL ON HIS
InvolunTARY TRAvels.
“ALAS, MY BROTHER... the Church suffers great discouragement in
these evil days, her hands are fettered and her enemies compass her
round about. The dungeons in which she was wont to immure the
wicked for the good of their souls, are emptied of their human tenants
and thrown open to the gaze of the profane and to the glasses of the pho-
tographer; her instruments of chastisement are hung up in museums,
and the machinery of her miracles is sold to the exhibitor of the
Fantoccini. We have fallen upon bad days, and I see no silver lining
to the clouds that frown around the chair of St. Peter. Ora pronobis/
“Yet, O my brother, the Church of Rome is not wholly abandoned.
Persecuted as she is in the Old World, she can yet vindicate in the
New her right to be the directress and governess of mankind. There
she is still permitted to show what she would do everywhere if she
could, there her missionary zeal is unchecked, there is nobly realised
the beatific vision of the divine MonTALEMBERT, “a free church in a
free state,’ that is to say, a state which desires no freedom but that of
religion, . With humble, but hearty joy I subduct from one of the
accursed journals of England (one bearing the name of the blasphemous
wire that seeks to annihilate the distances fixed by Providence between
man and
Mexico. -
“I alter not the ribald words of the writer, for they do but show his
profane rage at Ecclesia's triumphs:—
“At a representation which took place at one of the theatres of this city, MIRA-
Mon, the elected of the Church faction, and his wife .# present, an appeal was
made in the piece to a monarch to grant his subjects the blessings of peace. A poor
mechanic, i.º. occasion a favourable one, arose, and, in a most pathetic
appeal, addressed MIRAMon and his wife, and requested them to #. a term to the
miseries of his starving countrymen by j to Mexico a like favour. The
unfortunate supplicant was, by order of the President, d out of the theatre,
conveyed to prison, and sentenced to receive 500 lashes at daybreak the following
morning. hen 850 had been administered, MIRAMon was informed that the man
was dying. ‘Let the remainder,’ he said, “be given on the dead body; my orders
must be carried out.’”
man), the following gracious and glorious news from |H
“Blessed be noble MIRAMON, and blessed be his wife, a true and
devoted Catholic, who—
“On no single occasion has been known to intercede on behalf of any unfortunate
victim, but, on the contrary, has ever hounded her husband on.”
“Good and devout woman!, For her the prayers of Rome shall not
be wanting... But here is another of the vigorous deeds of the LAMo-
RICIERE of Mexico, the Champion of the Church:—
“An unlucky peasant having been taken by the º to serve as a soldier,
and conveyed to some barracks within the precincts of the palace, his wife went to
see him; and, with the view of enabling him to escape, took with her female attire
with which to disguise him. The man and his wife were both seized, and three
hundred lashes administered to each. The former survived, but the poor woman,
after giving birth to a still-born child, was conveyed to the hospi where she
shortly after died in the most excruciating agonies.”
“May these tortures be beneficial to the soul of the wicked creature
who sought to take away her husband from the duties which he owed
to the army of the Church. But, these punishments are instances of
the devotion with which her lay children in Mexico serve her now let
us read, O my brother, and read with pious sorrow, that our lot is so
different, how the clerical servants of Ecclesia serve her in the happy
land of Mexico in which the spirits of its first noble Spanish con-
querors seem again warring for the faith :—
“The above cases bear but an infinitely small proportion to the atrocities that aro
being daily committed by the Clerical Assassins. The murders of prisoners, sick
and wounded, cease to attract attention, so common are they. It was only the
other day that Vicario, one of the sons of the Church, killed in cold blood 400
- º or southern men, who surrendered to him. Los ADo, another son of the
Church, skinned the soles of his prisoners' feet and made them dance upon sharp
stones. . MiRAMon’s brother is said to have burnt two of his prisoners alive, and
certain it is that he assassinated a father for endeavouring to save his own daughter
* * * * * * . In fact, volumes would not suffice to recount the deeds of horror
that have been committed by the Holy Church faction since they came to power,
and every one shudders to think that these deeds are done at the instigation of the
ministers of religion.”
“So, write these blinded heretics, my brother, of that which they
understand not, but we will take their evidence, though we repudiate
their profane reasoning. Let us, my brother, join in petitions to S. S.
Moloch and Herod, that the hands of our brethren in Mexico, lay and
clerical, may be strengthened for the good work... We have done what
We could, as Perugia and Naples, and a hundred other places can testify,
but the sons of Zeruiah have been too strong for us, and the demon
Liberty rides trampant through the temples of Zion. But our hearts
are with our Mexican brethren, what they do in majorem Dei glorian
we would do if we could, and though now Revolution rejoiceth that
she hath tied our hands, they may yet be loosed, when, O Mexico, thy
divine example shall be remembered.
“Till when, O my brother, your prayers.
“Thine, in the above named Saints,
“Rome, Nov. 5. (St. Guido.)” “ANTONELLI.”
A HANSOM FARE.
THE EMPREss of the FRENch in a “common street cab.”! What
a shock to Snobbesses who think it “not genteel” to ride in one!
What a lifting up of hands must there have been among fine ladies
when their husbands called their notice to this startling Court intelli-
gence! ... What shrieks of “Did you ever?” from their feminine
acquaintances who think it vulgar to read newspapers, on being made
acquainted with the appalling fact!
ell, after this we hope that we shall hear of no more nonsense
being talked to struggling husbands who can't afford a carriage, about
ladies ºf caste by being seen in common cabs. At any rate, when
ANGELINA hints at her reluctance to enter such a vehicle, Edwin may
without fear of SIR CREsswell. CREsswell make reply, “My pet!
The EMPREss EugéNIE once rode in a street-cab, and what an Empress,
love, has done, surely, sweetest, you may do!” Indeed, seeing how
the EMPREss has always led the ladies' fashions, it would not much
surprise us if soon it became vulgar to ride in private carriages, and if
our fineladies paid their calls and did their shopping in a “common cab.”
Is it known, we wonder, whether the street vehicle in which the
EMPREss rode was a Hansom, or four-wheeler? As the fact is now
historical, that EugéNIE did take a cab, it ought to be recorded what
sort of one she took. We half incline ourselves to guess it was a
ansom, and we think whoever drove her certainly had never a more
handsome fare. , Clearly he, in future, ought to charge a double mileage,
for his vehicle has now obtained a place in history, and something
extra, surely should be charged for riding in it. ..Indeed, we think it
would pay well to make a public exhibition of it. We are confident
that thousands would pay a willing shilling for the privilege of seein
where an Empress once has sat, and a s º more to be allow
themselves to sit there. Yes; Punch gives all honour to his pet, the
EMPREss; and of all his Court acquaintances, proclaims her la plºt
taillante, as well as la plus belle. , The Triumphal Car of Căsar will
henceforth stand in the same rank as EugéNIE’s Triumphal Qab; the
Cab wherein she rode over the shams of false gentility, and bravely
triumphed over the mock rules of etiquette.

November 13, 1860.
AsHEs to Ashes! Lay the hero down
Within the grey old Abbey's glorious shade.
In our Walhalla ne'er was worthier laid,
Since Martyr first won palm, or Victor crown.
"Tis well the State he served no farthing pays
To grace with pomp and honour all too late
His grave, whom, living, Statesmen dogged with hate,
Denying justice, and withholding praise.
Let England hide her face above his tomb,
As much for shame as sorrow. Let her think
Upon the bitter cup he had to drink–
Heroic soul, branded with felon's doom.
A Sea-King, whose fit place had been by BLAKE,
Or our own NELson, had he been but free
To follow glory's quest upon the sea,
Leading the conquered navies in his wake-
A Captain, whom it had been ours to cheer
From conquest on to conquest, had our land
But set its wisest, worthiest in command,
Not such as hated all the good revere.
We let them cage the Lion while the fire
In his high heart burnt clear and unsubdued;
We let them stir that frank and forward mood
From greatness to the self-consuming ire,
The fret and chaſe that wait on service scorned,
Justice denied, and truth to silence driven;
From men we left him to appeal to Heaven,
'Gainst fraud set high, and evidence suborned-
We left him, with bound arms, to mark the sword,
Given to weak hands: left him, with working brain,
To see rogues traffic, and fools rashly reign,
Where Strength should have been guide, and Honour lord—
Left him to cry aloud, without support,
Against the creeping things that eat away
Our wooden walls, and boast as they betray,
The base supporters of a baser Court,
The crawling worms that in corruption breed,
And on corruption batten, till at last
Mistaken honour the proud victim cast
Out to their spite, to writhe and pant and bleed
-
Under their stings and slime; and bleed he did
For years, till hope into heart-sickness grew,
And he sought other seas and service new,
And his bright sword in alien laurels hid.
Nor even so found gratitude, but came
Back to his England, bankrupt, save of praise,
To eat his heart, through weary wishful days,
And shape his strength to bearing of his shame.
Till, slow but sure, drew on a better time,
And statesmen owned the check of public will ;
And, at the last, light pierced the shadow chill
That fouled his honour with the taint of crime.
And then they gave him back the Knightly spurs
Which he had never forfeited—the rank
From which he ne'er by ill-deserving sank,
More than the Lion sinks for yelp of curs.
Justice had lingered on its road too long:
The Lion was grown old; the time gone by,
When for his aid we vainly raised a cry,
To save our flag from shame, our decks from wrong.
The infamy is theirs, whose evil deed
Is past undoing; yet not guiltless we,
Who, penniless that brave old man could see,
Restored to honour, but denied its meed.
A Belisarius, old and sad and poor,
To our shame not to his—so he lived on,
Till man's allotted four-score years were gone,
And scarcely then had leave to 'stablish sure
Proofs of his innocence, and of their shame,
That had so wronged him; and, this done, came death,
To seal the assurance of his dying breath,
And wipe the last faint tarnish from his name.
At last his fame stands fair, and full of years
He seeks that judgment which his wrongers all
Have sought before him—and above his pall
His flag, replaced at length, waves with his peers’.
He did not live to see it, but he knew
His country with one voice had set it high ;
And knowing this he was content to die,
And leave to gracious Heaven what might ensue.
Ashes to ashes! Lay the hero down,
No nobler heart e'er knew the bitter lot,
To be misjudged, maligned, accused, forgot–
Twine martyr's palm among his victor's crown.
MODESTY AND MUSIC.
THE modesty of Mr. Punch is as world-known as his genius, but it
clearly must not hinder him from calling public notice to whatever
may enhance his exalted reputation. Now that ZADKIELs and Table-
turners and other impudent impostors have taken up the calling, Mr.
Punch but seldom condescends to prophesy; but to prove that he is
competent to do so when he chooses, he oecasionally inserts a predic-
tion in his print. The last with which the world was favoured and
astonished was published in his number for the sixth of last.Qctober
and predicted that the clear-voiced CLARA Novello, whose “farewel
performance” had taken place the previous week, would be heard
again in London ere the ending of, November. This marvellous pre-
diction created great sensation in the musical world, and heavy bets
were laid that it would fail to be fulfilled; for that a "farewell per-
formance” should prove not to be a farewell, was a thing of course
unheard-of in the annals of the art., Nevertheless, the day which sees
these words before the world will see another laurel added to the
rophet Punch's crown, and his last wonderful º faithfully
F. out. On the evening of Wednesday, November 21st, while ever
club and coffee-room, º street and dwelling-house, is º Wit
his praise, in St. James's Hall will issue the last notes that Qur CLARA
will bring out for us Londoners before she takes her well-won rest.
All ye .#. music love and would its pleasures prove had better change
your gold and silver for these notes, for they are the last with which
your ears by her will ever be enriched.

views, and without too intimate an acquaintance with the Heathen Poets and

A SONG WITHOUT WORDS.
From our Idle Contributor.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“I Have been to hear the Night Dancers, a delightful opera
by MR. LoDER, which has just been capitally revived at Covent Garden,
by Miss PYNE and MR. HARRIson. If LodeR were not an English-
man, I would say that his opera is replete with grace, melody, tender-
ness, harmony, colour, sparkle, chic, član, ensemble, and verve, but of
course all those pretty words (and whatever they mean) must be
reserved for Frenchmen and Italians. I will only say, just you take
Mrs. Punch, and Judina, and Tobina, and see if they are not delighted.
MR. Lope R has, of course, been kept in his proper place, that is to
say, entirely neglected, by managers, for many years, but that is no
reason why, if an . has, somehow contrived to knock out
a fine work, we should not go and º it, meaning, I am sure, no
disrespect to M. M. VERDI, Flotow, HALévy, ALARY, and the rest of
the deities of music. -
“But my º: in writing to you is to say that those
Fatal Fairies, the Wilis, are the agents in the drama of this ; and
that a º notion came into my head. We have not had the Night-
Dancers for several years, and it has been a loss to the stage. Could not
a good parody be written on one of those black songs, and be called
“O Wilis, we have missed you!”
If so, hadn't you better tell one of your young men to write it. You
can't expect me to find the notion and the poetry too.

SOUTHWARK ELECTION.
WE are º to learn that Southwark has no intention of yielding
to the base dictation of those who invite her to neglect her own
inhabitants, and seek to be represented by some mere statesman,
Mud is thicker than water, and we have no idea of setting aside local
men for the sake of giving a seat to somebody, who is nothing to us,
and probably never waded through the Borough in all his life. We
are gratified to state that if MR. RHYND, our eminent Cheesemonger,
should find it incompatible with his duties to take our representation
upon him, and the health of MR. YoUNG Conlings, our distinguished
Fishmonger, shouldinduce his indefatigablemedical attendantL)R.SMITH
to forbid his standing, MR. TRYvetts, our celebrated Ironmonger, has
nobly declared that he will not abandon old Southwark at her need. Each
of these gentlemen has ample pecuniary means, and though it is a base
libel on Southwark to write, as has been written, that it costs £10,000 to
keep her publicans in good humour, and to seat a candidate (for we know,
from youchers, that it does not cost nine-tenths of that sum), we are
proud to believe that the º claims of our enlightened con-
#. will not be forgotten {º of the gentlemen we have named.
We need neither MR. LAYARD, MR. HELPs, .WENTwoRTH DILKE,
nor MR. MIALL, while we have citizens like those we have mentioned,
and we beg to assure the scoffing critics and the sneering press that
the “Southwark snobs” know on which side their bread is buttered.

FROM OUR CHINESE CORRESPONDENT,
(A Letter written from the Seat qf War to the Pekin Penny Trumpet.)
ING a song of triumph! Again
our arms are victorious !
Again have the Barbarians
may their grandfathers eat
irt!) fled, routed and dis-
mayed, before the gingals of
our braves | Again his
Serene Effulgency, the Off-
spring of the Sun (may his
pigtail never grow less!)
clap his hands, and grow his
finger-nails in safety and in
peace, and offer votive vic-
tims to our battle-god
“My last letter informed
you how , the enemy had
effected a lºf rom their
war-ships, which, as I re-
marked, are clumsy ill-con-
structed vessels, and not to
be compared for speed or
power with our junks. . By
advice of our commanders
the landing was permitted
to be made without attack;
for the old spider knows
better than to frighten away
the blue-bottle that is fluttering to his web., Having let them disem-
bark their handful or so of men (at the most, it is computed that they
number but five millions), GENERAL SANG-Ko-LIN:SIN calmly waited
their arrival at the Taku forts, which to lure the silly infidels safe into
our jaws, it had been resolved that they should carry by assault. To
achieve this clever stratagem, a masterly backward movement was
effected by our braves; and with the exception of some six thousand
or so, who to keep up the pretence, were suffered to be killed, all our
troops retired without hindrance or confusion, and in as perfectly good
plight as when they left Pekin. The enemy it is true *: to
annoy us by letting off his cannon at us on our march; but the only
damage done to us was that our sides grew rather sore, with our
agonies of laughter at his absurd attempts.
“Their warfare is still waged upon the ancientest of methods, such
88 Wºº or SEE-DI-JIM, or, any other of our Generals would
deem only fit for babies, and, if they prize their peacock's feather,
would not dare to use. Plain, straightforward º ting is all these
fools have yet been trained for, and they apparen { know nothing of
trickeries and stratagems, and all those finer arts of warfare, in whic
our officers and ministers are so surpassingly well versed... The well-
known, maxim of FUN-KI (the great authority upon Celestial military
tactics) that—
“He who fights and runs away,
May live to fight another day,”
they either foolishly ignore, or else have never, heard of; and so far
does their brute courage carry them away, that they often fall a sacrifice
to its stupid sway.
“To make sure of the Barbarians, and prevent their running away,
an order has been issued to destroy their fleet; and as a couple of our
junks have been commissioned for the purpose, there will be the utmost
ease in effecting its accomplishment. As far as all our º have yet
been able to discover, the Barbarians (may the bones of their great-
grandfathers be grilled!) are perfectly unconscious of the fate that
is in store for them, and unsuspecting of the snare which has so
cleverly entrapped them. At their present rate of marching, you may
expect them at Pekin in the course of the next week, so bid the
executioners to have their saws in readiness. GENERAL SANG-Ko-
LIN-SIN, with his victorious army, still heads them on the march, and,
to avoid the chance of contact, keeps his rear six miles in front of the
Barbarian boots.”
ANOTHER ACCOUNT.
(Private and Confidential, and not meant for Public Print.)
“O, my Ji-MI-N1 CRI-ki, we are all as dead as tea leaves! The
Barbarians have landed from their world-conquering fleet. Such ships
O Ji-MI-NICRI-K1-Monsters made of iron, with fiery dragons chaine
inside them, tamed by the barbarians to do their bloody work! These
dragons, it is said, are fed on coals and boiling water, so you may con-
ceive they have no bowels of compassion in their bodies, and are, even
in their slavery, the most hot-tempered of brutes. Their breath steams
up like smoke from their long stiff black proboscis, their every snort
is like a thunder-clap, and when they scream, they make one faint.
“The arms, too, of the enemy are as fearful as their fleets. They
have i. guns that, roar as though it were a whirlwind, and that
shake the mountains like a mighty earthquake. The balls they car
weigh a quarter of a ton, and these monster shot are fired with suc
power and precision, as to hit the smallest humming-bird at a dozen

monsters? In five ºt. and three seconds they took i."#.
Forts, defended though they were by the bravest of our braves...Our
gals were no more to them than baby-guns and pea-shooters." Un-
armed by our fire (for they bear a charm about them which renders
them ball-proof), they slaughtered, hand to hand, three millions of our
men. HUMP-Ti is no more; DUME-TI sleeps in peace; even the brave
Fun-KI lies numbered with the slain! SAng-Kö-LIN-sin is indeed the
only warrior who has escaped. Thanks to his lucky star (as well as
his long legs), he hath lost his peacock's feather, but hath saved his life.
“What need I tell you more ? Be warned in time, O friend! Pack
up your tea at once, and prepare .." toes to stretch. If you value
your existence, leave your valuables behind you. They will terribly
impede you, and if I survive, you may rely I will take care of them.
Moreover, I, would recommend you to cut off your long finger-nails.
The less you have to carry, the quicker you will travel.
“I remain, expecting every moment to be roasted,
“THE WRETCHED ONE who used to sIGN
HIMSELF Your own CoRRESPONDENT.”
“P.S. Before you go, dig a hole beneath the China rose-tree in your
garden, and hide me the cash due for my last quarter’s salary. On
second thoughts I hope to keep my head on by shaving off my pig-tail,
and by becoming a Barbarian perhaps to save my life.”

THE IMMENSITY OF THE LORD MAYOR.
A Most imposing idea of the greatness of the LoRD MAYOR of
* |LONDON will be given to any Frenchman into whose hands may fall a
number of the City Press, wherein is quoted a description of the jewels
of the Civic Sovereign, derived from the interesting and instructive
pen of MR. TIMBs:—
“The collar (date 1534), is of pure gold, composed of a series of links, each formed
of a letter S.; a united York and Lancaster (or HENRY THE SEvenTH) rose, and a
massive knot. The ends of the chain are joined by the portcullis, from the points
of which, suspended by a ring of diamonds, hangs the jewel. The entire collar con-
tains 28.8's, 14 roses, 13 knots, and measures 64 inches. The jewel contains in the

rounding this, a garter of bright blue, edged with white and gold, bearing the City
motto, “Domine Dirige Nos," in gold letters. The whole is encircled with a costly
border of gold S's, alternating with rosettes of diamonds, set in silver. The jewel is
suspended from the collar by a portcullis, but when worn without the collar is sus-
pended by a broad blue ribbon. The investiture is by a massive gold chain, and
when the Mayor is re-elected, by two chains.”
The ends of the LoRD MAYOR's chain are joined by a portcullis. Er
pede Herculem. What must be the size of that chain which has a port-
cullis for its clasp The great LoRD MAYoR or LoNDON is surely
distinguished by a physical greatness, nearly proportionate, to his
dignity, Fancy a man walking about with a portcullis on his breast!
Are not the Aldermen of London sons of ANAK? These will be the
natural exclamations of intelligent foreigners, on ...; that a port-
cullis is one of the jewels of the Civic regalia. Qur neighbours across
the Channel have heard of the City Giants. . They will suppose that
there are many more than two of these; and they will conclude that
the LoRD MAYoR is a big brother of Gog and Magog. ...What sort of a
castle must the Mansion House be to contain an inhabitant who wears
a portcullis, as a common man would wear a hook-and-eye; and besides
this portcullis, an enormous jewel set in gold hanging at it, suspended
from his collar P. Would the LoRD MAYor's portcullis serve to close
Temple Bar? Would an army marching on London by the Strand
be arrested by the Lord MAYoR's portcullis P. Such are the questions
which France will propose to Europe for solution; and she will further
demand, to know, whether the 250 tureens of real turtle, and all the
many kilogrammes and hectolitres of food and drink of every descrip-
tion, consumed at Guildhall annually on the ninth of November, are
principally consumed by the great LoRD MAYOR for his own dinner?

CHAPTER XXXVII-THE REIGNS OF EDWARD THE FIFTH
AND RICHARD THE THIRD.
S the first of these two
sovereigns, only reigned
three months, it is not very
surprising that we find but
little change of costume in
his reign. Nor were the
two years and a quarter
which saw the “sſy and
bloody” Richard on the
throne, prolific in new
fashions, either military or
civil. But with the reign
of HENRY THE SevenTH,
we enter a new period in
the history of costume; and
we have something more to
say about the fashionable
marvels of the Yorkists and
Lancastrians before weturn
our º to the wonders of
the Tudors.
That KING RICHARD was
a dandy is an historic fact,
although our playgoers may
not have seen much cause
to credit it. The “crook-
backed tyrant” is in general
dressed somewhat dowdily
upon the stage, and has
more of the heavy villain
than of the heavy swell
about him. Yet, we learn,
when Duke of Gloucester
he was the most fashionable
dresser of his day; and that
his love of finery survived
his coming to the throne, is pretty evident from a mandate to the keeper
of his wardrobe which is extant among the Harleian MSS., and which
they who can decipher it are welcome to peruse...This letter he dis-
atched from York on the 31st of August, 1483, and it contains a curious
ist of the dresses he wished sent to -
him, and in which he was desirous
of exhibiting himself, to his sub-
jects in the north. As his favourite,
the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, was
equally motorious for his gorgeous
apparel, we may presume that fogs
were mostly in favour at his court;
and we can fancy how the York-
shiremen rubbed their eyes, and
"danged their breeches,” to, see
“tº foinefwoak” who came to them
from “Lunnum.”
Familiar as we are with the
Richard of the stage, it is difficult
to credit that the RIGHARD of
reality could have looked other
than a ruffian. Yet that there was
more of beauty than of an ugly
beast about him, is Fº by no
less an authority than the Countess
of DESMOND, who danced with him
when young, and described him to
her friends as “the handsomestman
in the room; except his brother, the
King.” This exception seemstous
in some measure to account for the
Countess' opinion; and we incline
rather tº fancy, that if Richard
had not had a title to his back, she would not have shut her eyes to its
deformity." As the poet says, or might have said:-
Some slight notion may be formed of what sort of a figure the King
cut in his State robes, when we mention, that the day before his
coronation he rode in a *::::: from the Tower down to West.
minster, in a doublet and stomacher of blue cloth of gold, *:
with nets and pine-apples º pattern often seen in drawings of t
epoch), a long gown of purple velvet furred with ermine, and a pair of
short gilt spurs. Still more gorgeous was his get-up on the day of
coronation, when he came out coran populo (no, Cox, we don’t mean
in Great Coram Street) in a couple of State suits; one of crimson
velvet furred with miniver, and having an extremely rich embroidery
of gold, and the other of purple velvet fringed with ermine fur. His
sabatons, or shoes, were covered with crimson tissue cloth of gold:
his hose were of crimson satin, as also were the shirt, coat, surcoat,
hood, and mantle in which he was anointed. Fine feathers these; but
surely all this crimson plumage must have rather given Richaºn...the
look of a flamingo, if it did not make him look more like Sam Weller's
swell friend, “Blazes.” Perhaps the King, however, wished to symbolise
his bashfulness by wearing a red suit, which might have served to show
how he blushed all over at the honour that was done him. This may
seem a foolish fancy, but history in some measure bears us out in
entertaining it. For instance, ãº, tells us, that when the
Mayor and Aldermen waited upon the Protector with an offer of the
crown, “he accepted it with seeming reluctance,” as though he wished
them to imagine he was too modest to take it. A pretty subject this
for a fresco in St. Stephens, and we almost wonder that our artists
have not thought of it. Richard, nine feet high, with one, hand
hiding a smile and with the other º the crown, represented with
a sort of “Oh-no-I-couldn't-think-of-it-Pray-don't-ask-me” air about
him, would form an interesting addition to the series of subjects which
have been taken lately from the lives of English Kings, -
Whether the dandies of this period were gifted, with good legs, is a
question which we have not leisure to debate, but which naturally
suggests itself at sight of the
exceedingly short jackets that
were worn, whereby the lower
limbs were left completely un-
concealed. The only things that
covered them were long stock-
ings or hose, which, in fact, were
the same garments as the ancient
Norman chaussés. These ex-
tended up the thigh like the
thread tights of an acrobat, and
were tied by points or laces to
the doublet, much in the same
manner as our roley-poley suits.
The short jackets we have men-
tioned were worn over the dou-
blet, and were made plain at the
sides, but full of plaits upon the
chest as well as in the back.
Sometimes they were edged with
fur, and at the waist were tightly
belted with a narrow girdle,
from which a dagger generally
depended in the front. Their
sleeves were large and full,
º at the shoulder to give
roadness to the chest, and
slashed to show the doublet, or
even shirt, beneath. For this
purpose, apparently, they were
often slit entirely from the shoul-
der to the wrist, and the edges
laced together about three inches apart. This slitting, combined with
the swollen º: of the shoulder, must have made the wearers
look as though they had their arms broken, and were obliged to walk
about with a poultice in each sleeve.
Coming fashions, like events, sometimes cast their shadows on before
them: and we find that these short jackets were somewhat giving wa
in Richard's time to the long and sober gowns which came in wit
his successor. But for several years previous, long dresses had been
worn at times as commonly as short ones. In fact, variety was as
#. in these days as in, ours, and persons of distinction were as
frequently distinguished for their oddities of dress. The modern pork-
ie hat, with a slightly higher crown and with a single feather leaning
orward from the back, was a common form of head-cover throughout
the fifteenth century, and Jews, for aught we know, may have seen
nothing wº in wearing it. Öher eccentricities were equally con-
spicuous; and among them we may mention a gentleman, depicted in
an old, illumination, who wears a shoulder-belt or baldrick, slung to
º to his knee, having a peal of little bells looped all along its
ength.

* Wags have tried to make out for the p of a joke that KING RICHARD was
a hunchback, and that the street boys of the period, when the King happened to
pass them, used to take delight in giving him a military salute, significantly
shouting as they did so, “Shoulder humps!” But it is wrong to imagine that
Ruchard had a hump. Rous, who knew him personally, says of º in his history:
“He was of low stature, had small comp features, and his left shoulder higher
than his right.” For thus setting us right respecting his left shoulder, the Ghost ºf
Richard clearly ought to cry out, “Bravo, fº ºng - qf

THE MIRACULOUS CABINET.
Uspen the above head an extraordinary work of art has been exhi-
bited by a Pole at the Egyptian Hall. It was only five feet high, three
wide, and eighteen inches deep, and yet it seems to have contained a
whole Pantechnicon-full of furniture. No carpet-bag of the most
caoutchouc capabilities ever held so much. It accommodated inside
its rapacious interior no less than 150 pieces of domestic apparel, and
of the same size as those that are generally found in the miscellaneous
wardrobe of a house. There was a bedstead with hangings, big enough
for Paul Bedford to have slept in—there were chairs whose legs
would not have given way under the weight of DANIEL, LAMBERT, in
his offallest days. There was a dining-table that Lord Cowley might
have invited all his friends to dine round two or three times a week,
besides a chandelier that he could hangoverit, to dazzle them with the
light (ſor we are perfectly aware that expense is no object to his
Lordship) of twelve of the very best étoile candles. It would require
one of DeBENHAM's catalogues to enumerate the multitudinous articles
stowed away as close as cabinet secrets in this miraculous cabinet.
Two young persons about to marry would find everything in it to
make their turtle-dovery that snug nest of comfort that they have so
long been dreaming about. They would discover something fitting to
the taste of each. There would be (that is to say, if turtle-doves ever
think of such things) a smoking-table for the gentleman, and a baby's
swing-cot for the lady. This enchanted cupboard is a house complete
in itself, and has the further advantage of ſº. about the only house
in which there is no skeleton, for the simple reason, that there is no
room for the smallest skeleton to hang out in it. Were he as small as
LoRD John even, the skeleton would not be able to procure standing-
room even, much less a seat. This miniature mansion is replete
with plate, linen, crockery, even down to toys for the little ones, and
footstool for Grandmamma. What a beautiful present to make a bride
on her wedding-day, only perhaps the twenty-eight covers and plates
might teach her to be extravagant! What a convenient portmanteau
to give to an emigrant! He could move about with his domicile on
his back as easily as a snail; and if sleep overtook him in the desert
or the backwoods, he would only have to pull out his bed and tuck
himself in for as many comfortable forty winks as the wild beasts or
the gold-diggers would allow him. When next we remove, we shall
certainly send to MR. NADolsky to ask him if he can pack up all our
furniture in about the same portable size. Ladies should take lessons
of him in the art of packing, and then they would be able to travel
with at least one-half their present quantity of luggage.

“Honour” or “Honor?” ...That is the question which has lately
been raised by a stupid inscription on an ugly monument. “Honour,”
certainly, and not “Honor.” Why should we not write “Honor” as
well as “Error” and “Terror?” Because “Honour” is not only
the older spelling, but also the more customary. We may as well
º any further degeneration of the English language, and as the
ine of limitation must be drawn somewhere, let us draw it under the
standard orthography of the present day. Any lower descent to the
gulf of phonetic writing than that which has been already accomplished
will thus be arrested.
Another, very good reason for eschewing “Honor” and “Favor”
is, not only that those words, like “Defense,” and “Offense,” are
pedantic Yankeeisms, but also that they are especially employed by
puffing tradesmen and other quacks, and are commonly adopted by
snobs who affect to talk fine, and who are accustomed to pronounce
their last syllable “or” just as they write it, or as rhyming with
“for.” Let us hear no more of leaving the w out of “Honour” and
“Favour,” and concede neither “Honor” or “Favor” to these
pompous gents.

A Word to the wise is sufficient, and the following words ought to
be enough for even the EMPERoR of Austria. They occur in
GARIBALDI’s parting address to his comrades:—
“By the side of King Honest Man, every feeling of rancour must disappear. Yet,
again, I repeat to you my cry—‘To arms 1 all, all !" If in the March of 1861, I do
not find a million of Italians in arms, alas for poor Italian liberty—alas for poor
Italian life Oh, no I cast from me a thought hateful as poison. The March of
1861, if required, even the February, will find us all at our posts.”
Now, then, FRANCIs Joseph; now's your time for a bargain. Sell
Venetia if you can. Sell Venetia in time. Next March it will be too
late, if you then have to deal with GARIBALDI and a million of Italians
in arms. You can't put Venetia up to auction; but she is f.
going, going—and if you don't look out, in less than six months she
will be-gone!

“Glory encircles with the same noble

This bit of , sentiment is, the
only attempt at ornament which
the inscription exhibits; and that
attempt is surely not a success.
Glory neither encircles the humble
nor exalted with any diadem at
all. It encircles, or causes to be
encircled, the heads indeed of the
exalted very º: in some
cases with royal diadems, in others
with ducal coronets, or caps of
lesser mobility. But Glory does
not encircle the head of the humble
with anything better than ban-
dages, sometimes, when it has got
those heads, broken in battle.
Even then it is Surgery which
applies those bandages;... Glory
only creates the necessity for
them; and lucky are all humble

A WORD FOR OUR STATUES.
“MR. PUNCH,
“LET us not be ashamed of our public statues. They are, no
doubt, queer. The best of them are bronze and marble Guys. Our
sculptors do contrive somehow to give a wonderfully wooden character
to their works in metal and stone. They are, in fact, little better than
stone-masons; . But then they are free masons. Those whose designs
are successful in a competition for a job, are free and accepted masons
and the other masons are free, though rejected; the masons, rejected
as well as accepted, are all free. In this freemasonry lies the secret of
our inferior sculpture: Our funny statues are among the fruits of our
free institutions. We have no tyrant princes in this country to squander
upon their artists the revenues wrung out of their slaves. There is no
recognised idolatry, creating a demand for images. Our cleverest men
have their way to make in commerce and politics; speeches to make,
laws to make; above all, fortunes to make—better things to make than
statues. The Englishmen who try to make statues, and make them
ill, are those who have little ability to make anything else.
“But it is not likely that even our money-makers and speech-makers
and law-makers would have succeeded very highly in making statues,
if they had turned their hands to that employment. Britons are too
robust, both morally and physically, for such fancy-work. Qur indi.
vidual and our national constitutions are much alike. British liberty
produces and consumes beef and beer. Hence results a strong but
clumsy habit of body and mind. A diet principally consisting of poor
i. vegetables, and sour wine, with frequent restriction to fish, or
nothing at all, appears, from the example of unhappy foreigners, to be
the necessary nutriment of what is called plastic genius.
“Sir, they tell us that we have no genius. , Considering what they
mean by genius, we may complacently agree with them. England has
produced some men of genius in the large way, but certainly few in
the small... We are excelled by our neighbours in every speciality of
genius. They surpass us in sculpture, and also in singing and playing
music. But this kind of P. genius is very commonly accompanied
with, general weakness of mind. In most cases, I believe that it is
simply the effect of nearly total idiocy, which has occasioned the
exclusive, cultivation of the only capable faculty of an otherwise
deficient intellect. An Englishman cannot put his whole soul into his
fiddle, or even into his picture, or his statue. , Our statues are monu-
ments of bad taste. Very well. They are also monuments of consti-
tutional government. Our neighbours might be proud of the City
Giants, if the PREFECT or THE SEINE were as independent as the Lord
MAYok of London. Proud indeed, too, they would, doubtless be to
possess those celebrated colossal works of civic art and exhibit them in
their national museum. But, Sir, I trust they will never have Gog and
Magog at the Tuileries. No, Sir; but let us be liberal. We cannot
make statues properly ; let us employ those who can. . We hire
foreigners to sing, and fiddle, and dance for our amusement; why not
also to decorate our streets and buildings with images?
“I am not a prejudiced or bigoted man, Sir, but
“Your obedient Servant,
“A CoSMOPOLITAN.”
“P.S. Though foreigners should be engaged to make statues in
honour of illustrious persons, there would still be room for native
talent. Guy Fawkes should not stand alone. What if a monument
were erected in dishonour of Judge JEFFERIEs? ... A similar memorial
might perpetuate the infamy of that successor of his who sentenced
LoRD DUNDONALD to the pillory.”
Final Floorer for Folly.
“After this, the EMPERoR thinks it will be better not to pursue any further an
idea,” &c. &c.

“MY DEAR PUNCH,
“In these Prae-Raphaelite days of Art, a man must be pretty
accurate about the accessories of his picture. Suppose, for example,
I am depicting a scene, from the history of the thirteenth century
which epoch you must know I º, affect) and suppose from
inadvertence I paint my hero in trunk hose—what an outcry there will
be among the learned critics, directly! Perhaps the style of my
knight's armour is a quarter of a century too early, or the ‘clocks” on
CLARIssa’s stockings a half an hour too late, instanter that eminent
savant Borewell drops down upon me in the Propylaeum, with ‘This
absurd anachronism is worthy of ’ &c. &c., or “when will Mr. Easel.
learn that it is a painter's duty to—” &c. &c.
“Well, it was precisely the dread of such remarks as these which
led me the other day into Westminster Abbey with my sketch-book under
my arm. I wanted to make a study for a boot “of the period,” which I
was sure I could find on one of the tombs in Edward THE Confessor's
Chapel. Admission to this portion of the edifice is charged sixpence
per head, in return for which little fee the Dean, and Chapter kindly
provide a staff of semi-ecclesiastically robed gentlemen who take it in
turn to play the cicerone to those country cousins and distinguished
foreigners who bestow upon our metropolitan lions their simple admi-
ration. And so well are these faithful laymen trained to their calling
that I verily believe any one of them could go through his description
blindfold if you only gave him his cue and kept his head clear of the
Illars.
... “The rapid strides which Civilisation is daily making must have an
influence, among the rest of mankind, on Vergers, who l make no
doubt are by this time an exceedingly agreeable and well-informed com-
munity, but years ago when time was young, and I sat sketching at
fair PHILLIPPA's feet, there was one eccentric member of the frater-
nity who used to intone his description in a manner which was not
pleasant, and as I had to listen to it about five times a day, you may
suppose I have not forgotten it yet. His brief, but pithy remarks
were as far as I recollect:—
“This 'ere's the Chappul of Edwed the Confessur. The pavement scomposed of
various sorts of marvels. And thats the Shroine of Edwed the Conressur you

“Ah, my dark robed guidel Ah my voluble and veracious verger!
little did you think that your artless, words would be reproduced on
these pages. I wonder do you still ply your gentle calling on the
‘mosake’ pavement? Does that solemn fat forefinger of yours still
indicate th: remains of John DE WALTHAM? Perhaps you have
retired from that line of business. Perhaps ere this your sixpences
have enabled you to exchange your cloister life for one more befitting
an active mind for something, let us say, in the licensed victualling
way—who knows? - -
“Occupied with these speculations, and having finished my sketch,
I wandered listlessly among the tombs and monuments... What a queer
old fashion-book of exploded tastes and byegone conceits one reads in
in them!. Just as this terrestrial sphere spins round on its own axis

Is it possible that MR. Joseph ADDIson, as he calmly sauntered over

those plethoric cherubims who hover over, the DUKE of SoMERSET's
sarcophagus? And yet no doubt His Grace's monument was considered
a masterpiece in its day!, That was a time for urns and cenotaphs,

enough, but in looking at a
portrait of a lady of the period
which we have now to write
about, extending from the

smiling at the head-dress that
she wears, which, if not the

far to reach it. Gigantic and

time or Edward the fourth (very scaRcr.) which we saw in our first look
at the ladies of this century,
they were not half so large and ludicrous as the high-crowned steeple-
caps, that came in fashion just before the death of HENRY The Sixth.
These erections were constructed of cloth or other fabric, and were built
about as high as three of our men's hats. They, however, had no
brims, and fitted closely to the head, gradually ºf in width
towards the top. These sugarloaſ, structures (which the ladies, very
likely regarded as “sweet things”) were worn at a slight angle in:
clining to the back, and were ornamented sometimes with a couple of
auze flaps, which projected like the wings of a gigantic butterfly

was tucked under the arm. This scarf was somewhat similar to the

classes; who, as they could not afford to make themselves ridiculous
by wearing the high steeple-caps, did the best they could by coming
out in hoods made somewhat flattened to the head, and at the sides
adorned with projections like apes' ears. The monks of course objected
to these monkeyish º ; and one may fairly think that women
had more on their heads than in them when one finds them apeing the
appearance of an ape.
Tourists who in quest of finer weather than we have had in England
have taken a week's scamper into Normandy this summer, may have
seen caps approaching to the size of these huge head-dresses; and there
is little doubt, we think, that the fashion was originally taken from the
French, for Euglish ladies then were just as imitative creatures, it would
seen, as they are now. We have ample proof indeed that the mania
for these monstrosities raged with even greater fury in France than it
did here. Among other clinching evidence, Monstrellet relates a
highly edifying story of a “perambulating friar” by name Thomas
CoNECTE, who must have been the terror of the women of his time.
This perambulating preacher (who, for aught we know, may have
reached from a perambulator) started so determined a crusade against
igh head-dresses in France that the ladies did not dare to wear them
in his presence." Besides other brutalities, “he dyd excite y” smalle
yes to pulle downe these monstrous headificies, so that y” maides
were forced to sheltere in some place of safetye, untyl their loveres or
their lacqueys did come to their assisttance.” #. sensitive mind
shrinks from picturing the scrimmages, and scuffles that took place
and gallantry compels us to entertain a hope that the beadles now ant
then had the whiphand of the boys. We however find that for a while
the º father triumphed and made a bonfire of big head-dresses in
front of his al fresco pulpit. But, proceeds the chronicler:—
“This reform lastedde not long; for like as snails when any one passeth by them
do drawe in their hornis, and when daunger seems ouer do put them forth e,t so
these ladies, shortly after the preacher had quitted their countrye, forgetful of his
doctrine and abuse, began to resume their former head-dresses, and wore them even
higher than ever.”
It is difficult to decide whether the ladies of this era were great
church-goers or not, and whether if they were, they wore these steeple
caps, to signify the fact. If they did, it would have been but yet
another proof of the weakness of the sex.
“A daw's not reckoned a religious bird,
Because he keeps a cawing from a steeple:"
nor, we apprehend, could a lady well establish a character for
church-going, on the ground that she3. in wearing steeple-caps.

* ADDIson, in the Spectator, speaks of the steeple head-dress as a “Gothic build-
ing," and gives it as his opinion that the ladies would most probably have carried
it much higher but for the attacks of the friar Conects. “This holy man,” he say
“travellod from place to place to preach down these monstrous structures; an
succeeded so ºil in it that, as the magicians sacrificed their books to the flames
upon the preaching of an apostle, many of the women threw down their head-
dresses in the middle of his sermon, and made a bonfire of them within sight of his
pulpit. He was so renowned that he had often a congregation of 20,000 people:
the men placing themselves on the one side of his pulpit, and the women outbo
other, that appeared like a forest of cedars with their heads reaching to the clouds."
# It is not much of a compliment to compare ladies to snails; but when they wore
horned head-dresses, the simile was made so often that they must have grown quite
used to it. Fridless was the playing by the punsters on these horns. One can
hardly read a line in the satires of the period without coming across such phrases as
“they deem their horns a hornament,” or “their horns they have exalted."

In the score of years
succeeding the death of
ENRY. THE Sixth, the
shape of ladies' dresses was
but very slightly varied,
being as ugly at the outset
as well could be imagined.
The form that was most
fashionable was to have
- the front left open from
the neck down to the waist, with a turnover roll collar, made of
a dark colour, bordering the aperture. A stomacher of cloth or linen
covered the breast beneath, and occasionally the gown was laced
together over, it in the mode of the Swiss bodice, . A fringe of fur
was often added to the dress; and the sleeves, which fitted retty
closely to the arm, were furnished with deep cuffs of either #: or
velvet, reaching not unfrequently to the finger roots. The gowns,
were so capacious, both in their length and width, that as they
hung limp round the legs § crinoline, we should remember, had
not been invented), the ladies were obliged, to bear them slung
over their arms, as Dianas do their riding-habits, at the present
day. A broad silken band was worn about the waist, the wives of
persons of less income than forty pounds a year being forbidden to
wear girdles of foreign manufacture, or adorned with any broidery of
silver or of gold; Figured satins, furs of sable, and the richer cloths
of velvet were also prohibited to ordinary women, such as the “wives
of esquires and gentlemen, and of the knights bachelors,” though how
in the name of wonder knights bachelors could have wives, the writer
whom we quote does not condescend to state.
The following quaint lyric, which has obviously been parodied in one
of our most popular songs, suggests a pretty picture of a gallant of the
period casting sheepseyes at his sweetheart, and affords some indication
ºthe finery of the women did not find much favour in the eyesight
of the men :-

ARE UMBRELLAS PUBLIC PROPERTYP
THE second column of the Times grows daily more and more surprising.
It really sometimes is as much as we can do to eat our breakfast, so
strongly are we tempted to keep º: with astonishment. Just by
way of sample, here is one of the last wonders which so greatly have
astonished us:–
FQUNP, on the 13th instant, a SILK UMBRELLA. The owner may
have it on describing it and paying the expense of this advertisement. Apply
by letter only to F. W., &c.
Honour among thieves may be perhaps of rare occurrence, but what
is it compared to honesty among the finders of umbrellas! Umbrella-
stealing generally is accounted as no theft, although we should not
advise people rashly to commit it, for it may not so be viewed in
British Courts of Justice. Notwithstanding this, however, we should
scarce have thought it possible that the finder of an umbrella should
actually pay money to advertise the fact. Most people would rest
satisfied with finding the umbrella, without ". an attempt to find
its rightful owner. Indeed, so lax is the morality of men in this
respect, that when they spy a stray umbrella, they pounce on it as
readily as though it were a mushroom, or any other thing that any
finder may pick up.. Whether umbrellas can in law, be viewed as
private property, seeing how the public continually lay hands on them,
is a point which we reserve for counsel to decide; and while they are
about it, we would moot the further point, as to whether, if proceedings
at common law were taken to recover an umbrella, (say, one which
has been borrowed for five minutes and not returned within a twelve-
month) the proper plan would be to bring an action of trover, or an
action on the case.

in which that worthy distinguished himself by
the above quoted sally of broad but disrespect-
ful, humour, is called, in the report of it, an
“Extraordinary Westry Meeting.” In point of
intelligence, wisdom, and refinement, however,
it seems to have been characterised by ust the
ordinary features of that species of assembly.
TURNING-POINTS P
WE read that an action for damages has been
brought for some “turn-tables.” It turned out
that they had been supplied to a railway com-
pany, but at first we thought that these “turn-
tables” had been ordered by our friends, the
Spirit-rappers, and were some of the rotary in-
struments by which they help to turn the heads
of the credulous fools who place their faith and
bank-notes in them. . . By the bye, will any
Spiritualist, whose sight is deeper than most of
his far-seeing fraternity, have the kindness to
inform us whether KING ARTHUR and his knights,
as they sat round their circular table, were in
the habit of turning it? It might be a .#
practice for sending the bottle round. We should,
also, like to be informed by the same obliging
entleman, whose sight, we are sure, is not
deeper than his sagacity, whether we should be
justified in calling, and whether he would take
any offence if we did call, this old trick of
turning the tables a round game. The game
of Spirit-rapping, the rapacious sums that are
rapped out of fools, we should think went by
the name of cribbage.
A Fatal Sentence.
“LIBERTY is fatal to the Bourbons.” So said
the father of the present, or rather the ex-KING
of NAPLEs. But supposing the son is caught,
º: he not, as tried by the sentence above, to
belocked up for life. If “Liberty is fatal” to
a Bourbon, the most generous, the most chari-
table thing would be to deprive him of it. The
Castle of St. Elmo, we suggest, wouldn't be a
bad residence for him. He couldn't object to try
what he had so often recommended to others.
LONG LIVE THE LORDS |
“ExtRAORDINARY LONGEVITY of THE PEERs” was the heading of
a newspaper paragraph which lately appeared, containing a statement
of the advanced ages to which several members of the House of
Lords, have attained. The longevity of their Lordships, however, is
not extraordinary. They are almost all of them born with the peculiar
advantage of having in their mouths, at birth, a wonderful instrument,
ensuring the best possible nutrition. This is that bountiful provision,
which, in the vulgar tongue, is denominated the Silver Spoon. By
means thereof the very best of food and drink that may be desired can
be introduced into the system, and when that is out of order, also the
best of physic. Change of air and scene, recreation of all kinds, and
all manner of enjoyment are at the command of their Lordships gene-
rally, and they are exempt from cares which kill other people, either
by directly wearing them out, or by inducing them to drink gin, and
smoke inferior tobacco. Good wine and first-rate cigars, in which
they are seldom driven by depression, and misery to indulge too
freely, tend much to prolong their noble lives.
The old Law Lords, who were not provided with a congenital silver
spoon, have contrived, however, to butter their bread well early in life on
one side, and afterwards to get it thickly buttered for them on the other.
None of the Peers are obliged to live in the constant practice of self-
denial, and also in the fear of ruin, and a destitute old age. They are
exempt from dread of bailiffs and have no bills to meet, except those
which tradesmen send in at Christmas, which they can afford tº pay, or
which come up from the Lower House, which they are free to reject.
In legislation, moreover, they ºlº: the truly constitutional
rule which prescribes early hours. No marvel they live so long as
they do. The only wonder is that most of them do not outlive OLD
#: . that many of the Peers do not reach the years of the
atriarchs,

operated upon the vegetable, in a forcing point of view, that it grew
into a cucumber big enough to supply supper to his party of five, on
their reaching Eaton Square, besides leaving two large knobs to shy at
the cabmen as they drove away with his guests three hours later, Mr.
Punch trusts that this appalling anecdote (for the truth of which he
vouches) will induce the management to supply the one thing wanting
at the little Bijou, namely, ventilation. As Iachimo says:-
“I beg but leave to air this Jewel."
“Another Victim to Crinoline."
So many are these victims, that we think every newspaper establish-
ment, must keep the above heading. standing to meet the demand;
Another poor girl has been burnt at Warwick. The Hindoo widow used
to sacrifice herself on the funereal, pile out of love for her husband.
The fanaticism of the English maiden is not less sad, for doesn't she
sacrifice herself to the flames out of love towards an absurd, fashion?
The authorities have nearly suppressed the first wicked absurdity; why
doesn't the Government interfere with the second one, and try to put it
down? If it were only on account of these frequent accidents, we think
we should be warranted in denouncing Crinoline as A BURNING SHAME.

THE MONEY MARKET AND THE FUNNY MARKET.
ConsideBABLE agitation has been of late prevailing in the monetary
world by reason of a little squabble between those highly influential
and respected personages, Madame la Banque of France and the Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street. So far as we can gather, the row arose
in consequence of the behaviour of Madame, who, on finding her long
purse was getting short of gold, created what is called an artificial run
for it. This she partially achieved by buying up as many bills on
London as she could lay her hands on, and sending them over here to
be #. discounted; an operation that occasioned the Old Lady
of Threadneedle Street considerable annoyance, and made her more
than usually tetchy when applied to. Matters were at length indeed
brought to such a pass that she tied up her old stocking in which she
keeps her gold, and declared that she’d be "dratted” if she’d send
out any more of it: adding, that if her neighbour wanted gold, she
ought to raise her rate of discount, and not come bothering over here
and running off with all the gold that she could grab from us. For her
part the Old Lady said she wouldn't have demeaned herself by stooping
to such practices, and if Madame did not know the º way to go
to work, it was high, time that she were taught, and while she was
about it, the Qld Lady was determined to give her a good lesson.
Madame la Banque of course felt some uneasiness at this, which she
tried her best to hide by affecting indignation. She knew too well
however, that it would not suit her interest to quarrel with the Öid
Lady, and so she compromised the matter by begging for a loan of two
millions of gold to be secured by a deposit of an equal sum in silver, of
which it seems that she has plenty stored away in two or three old
china teapots in her safe. This request, as is well known, was gra.
ciously acceded to; but, those behind the scenes are aware there was
some trouble in getting it accepted, for although upon the whole of a
kindly disposition, and ready to do all within her power to accom-
modate, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is rather apt to grow
cantankerous, especially when her old stocking is threatened to be
touched. . It is not generally known, but we conceive there is no harm
in our publishing the fact, that her gracious acquiescence to the French
lady's request was mainly owing to the ready tact of Mr. Punch. Being
by far, the most considerable capitalist in Europe, that gentleman felt
naturally some slight feeling of anxiety to see the symptoms of a
monetary panic put a stop to, and he, therefore did his best to make
the old ladies shake hands upon the bargain which, it seems, had been
suggested by his wisdom, and of which the ablest of financiers had
approved. As an inducement, then, to part with her two millions of

notion may be formed of how enormously by Mr. Punch's operation the

rare long time before we shall ever have a Balfe Square, or a Wallace

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CONSERVATIVE AGENT.
RAIL! Who is MR. FRAIL *
Come, nonsense. Every-
body knows MR. FRAIL,
- and if anybody knows
him a little better than
anybody else, it is Lond
DERBY, inasmuch as MR.
FRAIL is one of the men
of all work for the Tory
Opposition; an agent for
the Carlton Club. MR.
FRAIL's services to his
party have been extraor-
dinary, and for fear that
the last service he has
done his party should be
insufficiently recognised,
Mr. Punch extracts the
following charming and
graphic record thereof
from the Montgomeryshire
Mercury.
Mr. FRAIL was charged,
before the trembling §:
gistrates of Shrewsbury,
with having come up to al
gentleman named South-
AM (who was conversing
with a friend in a street
of the said town), and
having used unto the said
gentleman language of an
exceedingly potent, de-
scription, sopotentindeed,
- that like very high game, it
could not be brought under the noses of ordinary persons. In four lines of the language
sworn to, there are seven words which are only heard (except in Shrewsbury and from #.
Carlton agent) from persons.in, that condition of drunken violence which justifies their
immediate incarceration. Well, it is further sworn that MR. FRAIL, not unnaturally
astonished that he did not receive instant chastisement, proceeded to intimate his ideas to
MR, South AM as follows, omitting oaths:-
“FRAIL. I'll give you a good lick in the mouth; you are a
head off; but you know it's all true.
“Southam. I don't choose to make a blackguard of myself in the streets.
“FRAIL. I will knock yours off.
“Southam. If you touch me it will be the most ex
“FRAIL. I will give you a good licking before the
MR, SouTHAM kept his head on, and also kept his temper, and invited the Conservative
gentleman to meet him, as §º before the Mayor. There the foregoing scene was proved,
and then the agent of the Carlton proceeded to cross-examine his accuser:-
* FRAIL. Did I say it was not the first lie you had told, and had to apologise for 7
*Southam. You did not. I never had to apologise.
“Faail. Not to MR. KEATE, when you told a lie about him.
“Southam. I never told a lie about MR. KEATE, and never apologised to Mr. KEATE.
“Faail. Did I call you a vendor of squirt and British brandy?
** southam. You not.
“Faaul. Did I call you a bandy-legged baboon?
“Southam You said nothing of the sort.
* FRAIL. Did I say your breath was worse than poison?
--Southam. No.
* FRAIL. Did I call you a punter? (A laugh.)
“SouTHAM. I suppose all this is part of the mud you said you would throw at me if the case came into court?
“Faaul. Now, open your cars and shut your mouth, and listen unto me.”
It is to be supposed that the worthy Magistrates of Shrewsbury desired that the case
should be established out of MR. FRAIL's own mouth, and therefore permitted him to insult
the witness, as it is not to be imagined that a Mayor of Shrewsbury and his friends stand
in any awe and terror of the eminent Conservative. Their clerk certainly interfered, but was
in his turn insulted by MR, FRAIL, and was not supported by his more subtle and far-seeing
chiefs. Their wisdom was rewarded, and they had some fun into the bargain, for MR. FRAIL,
after justifying the use of the potent language, proceeded pathetically to narrate the
following anecdote:–
“MR-SouTHAM would have everybody look up to him, and when he stands up, as I often see him in the
council, he wants everybody to look up to him as a º man—a second Disraeli. Why did he not tell
coward, or you would knock my
nsive job you ever did.
ayor yet."
you what happened in the summer months; he prepared his speech upon the new market, walked out of his
drawing-room with his two children, took them into a field occupied by MR. Rocke, and addressed them
as babes in the wood.
“Mr. SouTHAM. I distinctly say that is untrue.
“Mr. FRAIL (continued). Addressing his children as babes in the wood, he commenced his speech by
saying, “Mr. Mayor and gentlemen," and when he concluded he said, ‘Come along, my little dears; your
father has often told 3. he was the Disraeli of the Town Council.” I appeal to him if he did not take the
two children with a large telescope, and a cow in the distance, and say, ‘What a splendid creature.'"
This story MR. FRAIL supposed would be a plea in arrest of judgment, and he was not
entirely wrong; for after a good deal more of what a harsh judgment might term vulgar
buffoonery, by MR. FRAIL,
“The Magistrates retired, and after an absence of about a quarter of an hour returned, when the Mayor
said, “We fine MR. FRAIL E3, and require him to be
. in his own recognisances for £50 for three
months.”
They doubtless felt that MR. FRAIL's own
conscience would tell him whether he had done
anything out of the way. They never hinted at
such a thing, but merely complied with the letter
of the law, and without remonstrance or rebuke,
inflicted a nominal sentence on the eminent
Conservative. Their meekness was too much
even for MR. FRAIL himself:-
“MR. FRAIL to MR. Smallwood (with a look of
assumed surprisey-Is that all? I thought it would have
been more .
One would have thought so, even if the more
had *} been a severe rebuke to a self-con-
victed blackguard. But the Shrewsbury Magis-
trates doubtless know their own business best.
Mr. Punch has merely to point out MR. FRAIL's
last service to the Conservative party in show-
º what kind of stuff a Carlton agent may be
Inacle.
DON'T LOOK ALIVE.
What a dreadful hurry the victors of Delhi
and Lucknow are in for the reward of their
valour. Why, such of them as are still alive
have not waited much more than three years!
Is that a time to make a fuss about? If they
think so, let them be ashamed of their impa-
tience, and read the following advertisement,
which is official. It appeared in the Times news.
paper in June last:-
** NAVAL PRIZE MONEY.
“Department of the Accountant-General of the Navy,
“Admiralty, Somerset House, June 16.
“Notice is hereby given to the officers, seamen and
marines, and to all persons interested therein, that the
distribution of a moiety of the proceeds of ce
piratical junks, captured on the 11th of May, 1853, by
HER MAJEsty's Ship Rattler, will commence on Monday,
the 25th of June, 1860, in the prize branch of the depart-
ment of the Accountant-General of the Navy, Admiralty,
Somerset House.”
There! a heroic deed is done in May, 1853,
and nobody thinks of rewarding the heroes until
1860, seven whole years later. As the man says
in the Antiquary, “Oh, it’s a beautiful thing to
think how long and how carefully justice is con:
sidered of in this country!”
But, mind! where there are reasons for being
rapid, our admirable authorities can be as fast
as steam or even telegraphs. It is only the
lower order of heroes who have to wait for
what is due to them. Their betters are served
the instant they have done their work. For
instance, though the Rattlers have waited seven
years, and the Indian warriors have waited three
years, the return mail took out (and very pro-
perly) the guerdon to SIR. Hope GRANT for his
services the other day at Taku. So let us have
no sneers, or allegations that, the authorities
can't be rapid—the fact simply being that they
won't. -
A Trifle from Oxford Street.
CoMing out of the Princess's Theatre, after
Ruy Blas, a friend, who had the honour of
attending Mr. Punch remarked (as everybod
who ºil; understands acting must remar
after witnessing that play), “M. FechTER is an
artist of exquisite finish.” “You are right, my
dear friend,” said PROFEssoR PUNCH, “in Fegh:
TER’s performance, there is no case of reinfectſ.”
They then adjourned to the American Stores
and liquored.
Question for SPIRIT-RAPPERs.-Are, spirits
smuggled under the table, and can they be
removed without a permit?

MONKEY UNCOMMON UP, MASSA
IN consequence of the election of ABRAHAM LINcoln as President of the
United States (bravo, hooray, O my brothers!), it is announced that South Caro-
lina, in an ecstacy of slave-owner's rage, has ordered a solemn day of humiliation,
on which all the slaves in the State are to be flogged, and all the copies of the
Scriptures burned. Moreover, she calls a Convention, and declares that she is
going to separate from the Union, and be an independent State, and have repre-
sentatives º her own at the Courts of Europe. e hear that her first demands
on England are, that to show our sympathy in her hate of the President, Lincoln
Cathedral be pulled down, the County of Lincoln be re-christened and called
Breckenridge County, that all Lincoln and Bennett hats be immediately smashed
in, that LoRDLINcoln be transported, and that when Falstaff in the play speaks of
“thieves in Lincoln green,” he be ordered to say “PRESIDENT LIN coln's black
thieves.” Anything to please the lovely Carolina.
OFF WITH HIS HEAD !
Hoopay! we have not had a good sight lately, and the execution of a Lord, on
Tower Hill, will be arefreshing stimulant. e hope that the streets will be laid
down again by the time the fatal scene comes on, and we suggest to the Trinity
House to do something useful for once, and have the Hill nicely gravelled. We
bespeak front places in the best red cloth gallery for all our young men, and as
criminals from the lower class are finished off at a time which suits their friends,
we really trust that similar courtesy will be extended to the aristocracy, and that
justice will be done, in this case, about two o'clock, so that one will have time to
reakfast and get to the execution comfortably. -
The nobleman whose head—such as it is—now totters upon his noble shoulders,
is GeoRGE HENRY RoPER Curzon, 16th Baron Teynham, who was born we don't
know when, but created in 1616. He will have to bring his block-head to the
block for the following High Treason. -
He has objections to the present º of taxation, (and so have we for that
matter), and thus the unfortunate TEYNHAM addresses the Northern Reform
Union:-
“A House of Commons that cannot carry the people's measures needs that the people should
carry it. Are the people as weak as their representatives? Do we dwell in Lilliput? If not, let
them arise upon their feet, stretch themselves to the full stature of men, and have a solemn
proclamation read, ere they march to fight for freedom once again. Look, Britons to the kins-
men of your fathers, who were colonists in North America, taxed, or attempted to be taxed,
being unrepresented. The titioned Parliament that it might not be so, and the prayer of their
petitions, was rejected. º: these circumstances they asked their hearts what should freemen
ac, the reply was, ask your swords. These gave them freedom."
That is to say, that if the Government does not take off
the taxes, we are to proclaim a Republic, with TEYNHAM
for our Wasmºdrºs. That will not pay, and we very
much prefer the other alternative, namely, TEYNHAM's
having his head taken off as aforesaid, in the presence
of a, brilliant and distinguished circle of spectators, and
# the express desire of several persons of distinction.
herefore, GeoRGE CURzon, make your arrangements for
taking a chop on Tower Hill, at an early date. You need
not bother about your will, because, even if the above
insane address did not show that no will made * you
could be valid, you may remember, GEORGE, that all your
property is forfeit to the Crown. We have ordered a new
opera-glass of double }." to see howi u behave your-
self, and we cannot think that you will have much to
grumble about, for the ceremonial will leave you much
as you are, seeing that you can have got no head at
present. So,
“Sharp be the blade, and sure the blow,
And short the pang to undergo,”
and if you have got any watches, jewels, or anything in
that line, don't º them for the }. of Oxford or
any other prelate who may attend your last moments, but
send them Parcels' Delivery Company to 85, fleet
Street, and mind and pay the carriage.

'Tis said that, to quiet the Priests running riot,

MR. LAYARD stands for Southwark. That is well. Now,
oppºsed as Mr. Punch is both to Bribery and Intimidation,
he intends, to practise both upon the present occasion
in the most unblushing manner. And first in regard to
bribery, he hereby gives the Southwarkians notice that if
they nobly lift theirboroughºut of local mud by returning
MR. LAYARD, Mr. Punch will take the borough under his
care, and make it his pet. He will send a special corres-
pondent over in two Hansoms, and have the place explored
and praised, will show that Horsemonger Lane Gaol is
superior, to the Hanging Gardens of Nineveh, that High
Street is far more elegant than the same street at
Oxford, and that strangers ought to come from all parts to
examine the dirty old inns with the galleries whence the
guests used to look down on bear-baits and private, the-
atricals. In fact, Mr. Punch will invent Southwark, as
GeoRGE THE Fourth invented the now evil-scented
Brighton. But, on the other hand, for Intimidation. Let
MR. LAYARD find, on canvassing, that Southwark offers
him no chance, or let him be second on the poll, and
Mr. Punch solemnly pledges himself to take care of South:
wark in another sense. He will say no more—except that
twelve months from the day on which he declares war, a
decent Christian shall sooner admit that he lives in
Holywell Street, Strand, than in the Doomed Borough.

HOW HE OUGHT “NOT” TO LOOK.
Excited PRomPTER (to the Ghost of Hamlet's Father, who is working himself up to
the most funereal aspect he can assume). “Now then, Walker, LOOK ALIVE/"
JOLLY OLD FELLOWS.
Amongst things not generally known, is the existence of anything in common
between the British Peerage and the Society of Friends, except, two legs, two
arms, and the other particulars which constitute a common humanity. Longevity,
however, is a peculiarity, in which the Lords partake with the Quakers, and wherein
the plain Quakers even hold a rank above that of the noble lords. Whereas the
average life of the Peers is seventy years, that of the Friends is thus stated in a
letter to the Times signed Joseph ALLEN:-
“Permit me to enclose you the following ages of some deceased members of the Society of
Friends during the present year, taken from the obituary of the Friend, a Monthly journal, pub-
lished by that body. They are as follows:–84, 84, 85, 85, 85, 86, 86, 87, 87, 88, 88. 80, 89, 89, 91,
91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, making a total of 2,128 years, with an average for each life of rather
more than 884 years.
“Fifty lives in the same period give 4,258 years, with an average of 85 per life.”
The Quakers are said to be dying out; but if their average duration of life is as
#. as that above given, they are likely to take some time in decaying. The
ecline of Quakerism will operate to the disadvantage of Life Assurance Offices, if
it is the custom of the Friends to insure their lives, as feelings of friendship
might prompt them to do, even those who have no relations. The various
Provident Societies should endeavour to provide for the dissemination of the
doctrines of the Society of Friends.
As a general rule, the Quakers bear a high character; but in some cases, as
regards pecuniary transactions, this assertion must perhaps be discounted. Their
characteristic morality may in some measure account for their long life, but that
seems to be in a greater degree due to the good living, for the practice of which
they are equally celebrated. They cultivate a cheerful equanimity together with
the main chance; and being for the most ſº. rich, or in easy pecuniary circum-
stances, take all other things easy, as we all ought to do, and probably should do,
if we could afford it. Care may have killed a cat, but it does not kill Quakers,
who appear to quake very little with anxiety and mental perturbations.
The affluence and comfort to which the longevity of the Lords and that of the
Quakers may perhaps be ascribed cannot be readily supposed to account for that
of paupers, which another correspondent of the Times proves to be extraordinary.
Paupers are not certainly affluent, and they can hardly well be imagined as being
comfortable. But in a workhouse wherein a proper warmth is maintained, and
the diet is sufficient, a pauper who is no epicure, has no
pride, and no affections, might manage to lead a contem-
plative life of considerable ease and enjoyment. He
would be better of in every respect than a monk; and the
discipline of the Union would not involve the occasional
flogging to which he might be liable in a monastery. On
the whole, therefore, it is conceivable that the rich Quaker
and the noble Peer may be sometimes equalled or even
exceeded in happiness and consequent longevity by the

A company of million-

have conceived the
happy notion of pur-
chasing a tract of land

guarded by a custom-house, which will be officered by persons of most aggravating insolence,

unless they are well bribed will blab forth to the public whatever they spy out. A sovereign
'duty will be charged upon a pennyworth of biscuits, and on lollipops there will be levied a
five-pound-note apiece. Moreover, to make things even more unpleasant, the tariff of
forbidden articles will extend to all such articles as tooth-brushes and hair-combs, which no
one but an Englishman would look º as necessaries; and any one attempting to introduce
into the district such un-Continental luxuries as good tobacco and good soap, will at once be
º over to the Staats Procurator, to be dealt with as the law (as he may twist it) may
irect.
To further the resemblance to a Continental ºff. and increase the torment and
annoyance of the tourist, touters, and commissioners will dog him at each step, and tread
upon his heels until he either kicks them round or else engages one of them to defend him
from the rest. In the former case, however, he of course must run the risk of being dragged
before some functionary of what is mis called j ustice, and being blackguarded from the
bench as well as fined for the assault. In the same way he will always have the law dealt
out to him, if he refuses to submit to, an exorbitant extortion, or gets into a row in any
ublic room or vehicle, where any impudent intruder may tread upon his toes or coolly oust
in from his seat. He will be told such incivilities are the customs of the country, and
instead of, as a foreigner, being, treated with some courtesy, he will be jeered at for the
grossness of his ignorance in not knowing them.
In order to make tourists feel as wretchedly uncomfortable as they generally do when they
first get away from home, and have not grown reconciled to foreign ways of living, the
district will be furnished with hotel accommodation of the fifth-rate German, class, such as
Englishmen when travelling have too often to put up with after vainly seeking entrance at
every decent house. Here the tourist will be tortured with every inn-convenience, and will
º the worst of everything by paying the best price for it. His days will be made wretched
y bad cookery and glazed floors, such as, British boots unvaryingly and inevitably skate
Fº and his nights will be made hideous by every kind of torment, from sweltering quilts
of eider down to tribes of creeping things. To keep up the resemblance, he will find his
bed-room, furnished with those copious and extensive arrangements for lavation, consistin
of a slop-basin and cream jug full of water, for which Continental places have been long an
justly celebrated; and if he express himself in any way dissatisfied he will º, be
informed that His (olfactorily) Highness the DUKE of DiRTIshirtzENBERG has his bath-
room fitted up on precisely the same scale, and of course no common tourist can expect to
be supplied with greater luxuries than Dukes., ..
It having been observed that, as a rule, an English gentleman never seems so ill at ease as
at a table d'hôte, of course this form of taking meals will be the only one obtainable.
Persons who object to eat and, drink in public, where they are liable to be annoyed b
every kind of travelling bore, will be allowed no opportunity of having quiet dinners serve
in private rooms. Care too will be taken to make, the table d'hôte as long and tedious as
possible by having too few waiters and too º ill-served plats. For this purpose the
cooks will be selected from the worst of those on board the Rhenish steamboats, and among
their other blunders, special pains will daily in particular be taken to send round the poulet
a considerable time after the stewed plums have been consumed. Cheap home-made wines
turned sour will be supplied in foreign bottles, and be charged for as Johannisberg, Rude.
sheim, and Asmanhausen; while to complete the misery of the unfledged British tourist, the
reckonings will be made in foreign dialect and money, and the waiters will speak nothing but
their own peculiar polyglot, which we will defy the most accomplished º to understand.
Besides fleecing them with every possible extortion, proper means will be provided to ease
tourists of their money by having gambling tables opened at every stage and stopping place,
say for instance, on the average at every half mile. Ball-rooms will be . . the
manner of the Continent; and the luxury of
dancing will nightly be permitted in an atmo-
sphere of bad tobacco, blazing gas, and blaring
brass. Masters of the Ceremonies will be ready
in attendance to introduce the stranger to the
doubtfullest of partners. In fine, no pains will
be spared to make the Tourists' District equal
to the Continent in º respect; and as it
must assuredly be better for Great Britain that
Englishmen should lay out their spare five pound
notes at home, instead of going abroad to do so,
it appears to us that every lover of his country
of course must wish the project every possible
success.
SPIRITUAL LUXURY AND DESTI-
TUTION.
In an account given by the Post of what we
may take the liberty to call a mass-meeting of
Puseyites belonging to the Propaganda of St.
George's-in-the-East, held in the Church of St.
Mary Magdalene, Munster Square, Regent's
Park, on the 27th ult, appears the following
statement : —
“At a few moments past eleven, a procession of priests
and choristers, all habited in surplices, emerged from the
vestry, at the east end of the south aisle, then moved
along the south aisle, and down the middle aisle to the
altar, on which two large burning candles were placea,
and a golden cross.”
The Bishop of LoNDoN the other day made
some judicious remarks about existing spiritual
destitution. In the presence of that, his Lord-
ship's attention is respectfully invited to the
above case of spiritual º Burning candles
in the middle of the day! What spiritual extra-
vagance! They were not dips, either, or even
composition; wax no doubt. It is deemed unbe-
coming of clergymen to smoke cigars in public;
and what could they have wanted with lighted
candles of a morning in church? If to fumi-
gate the place with incense, they were guilty
of indulging in the most heterodox form of
smoking. Perhaps º smoked the golden cross
which they put upon the altar, that is, incensed
it, in which case they will incense the Bishop if
he smokes their cross and them. Let them go
to the Golden Cross, Charing, Cross, if they
want to smoke, or to some other respectable
public-house, and take their lights there, or if
they want to amuse themselves with fireworks,
let off their, Roman Candles on the Fifth of
November, the Feast of St. Guy Fawkes, in
some more suitable place than church.
Times Change, and so do Fashions.
We think it was Swifr who said that “young
ladies troubled themselves a great deal more
about making nets to catch men than cages to
hold them.” However, the Dean would have
changed his mind, if he had lived at the present
day, for we think the Črinoline is much more
of a cage than a trap; or might it be looked
upon as a combination of the two—both trap and
cage rolled into, one. There may be some truth
in this, for there is no doubt that many a man
has been hooked by a woman's Crinoline strongly
against his will, and detained there much longer
than was agreeable to him.

ago by some ladies, whose be-
nevolence exceeded their good
sense, to found a refuge for
poor dogs who were seen
about the streets inadestitute
condition, and either had no
home to go to, or did not
know their way to it. Care
for the canine species almost
seemed in this proposal to be
carried to extremes; but it
really falls far short of what
is being done for the comfort
of the hounds which have the
happiness to be hunted by the
Honourable MARK Rolle, a
oung gentleman who has not
ong since come into his—
and man's—estate. Among
other highly valuable and
interesting particulars, the
ſº Times informs us
that—
“The kennels stand on an acre
and half of ground, and are built
in the Elizabethan style of archi-
tecture. There are three lodging-
rooms in each compartment for the
dogs, which at present number a
hundred, and there are also an
enclosed yard, a boiling house,
feeding ditto, a whelping room, an
hospital, granaries; cot for
the huntsman, first whip and
kennel's man, and an abundant
supply of fresh-water at every
point. Last, though not least,
there is a puppies' play-ground,
a hundred feet square, which is
stone fox hounds. We should like to see the same
attention bestowed on the Agricultural Labourer in
those districts—where his comfort is so obviously over-
looked—as is bestowed on the Nobleman's Hounds.”
“Happy dogs!” will be the exclamation of
the reader when he has perused this interesting
paragraph. The motion of º: Play-
grounds for his Puppies surely does great credit
to the person who first thought of it, and if the
Honourable MARK Rollº be that person, let
him have the credit which, surely, he deserves.
We mean º: offensive when we speak of
credit; nor would we hint that in this instance
there may haply be some need of it. The
Honourable MARK Rolle is doubtless rolling
in riches, or he would surely not have thought
of s undering his money upon Playgrounds for
his Puppies. So, we repeat, let É. by all
means have the credit he deserves, for doing
what no other man that we have ever heard of
has ever done, or wished to do.
But surely the Honourable MARK will not
stop here. After carefully providing for the com.
forts of his dogs, he will surely throw a crumb
or two of comfort to his labourers. If we believe
the Western Times, and we don't see why we
shouldn't, their condition is not quite such as
their friends would, wish to see it, and some-
thing might be possibly suggested to improve it.
If the Honourable MARK Rollie would but
treat his pack of labourers as he treats his pack
of hounds, there really would be nothing left for
them to ask of him. Clean kennels—that is,
cottages—commodious and warm, a hospital, and
plenty of pure water and good food, what more
could the heart of labourer desire? and when
to this is added a Playground for his Puppies—
we mean to say his children—the list of his
requirements is more than well complete.

THE PRIZE OF FOLLY.
FIELD-MARSHAI, MR, Punch has for some time cherished the idea
of originating a Great Fool Exhibition, with prizes for the most dis.
tinguished and remarkable folly. But he has been almost turned from
his purpose, by observing that there would be little or no fair play in
the competition. There, is one person who, as far as Mr. Punch can
rceive, would infallibly sack all the prizes. And that person is the
aol Chaplain... The F.M. never takes up a paper without reading
some evidence that the Gaol Chaplains would make the chances of
other candidates quite infinitesimal. For instance, here is a bit from
the Daily Telegraph:—
“JAMrs MILEs, a ticket-of-leave man, was placed at the bar at Lambeth, charged
with carrying on a regular system of plunder on children, a species of offence for
which he has been already subjected to three terms of imprisonment of three
months each, in addition to three years' penal servitude. He was caught putting
his hand into the pocket of a boy named STEwART, and taking a shilling. When
taken to the station-house a number of children attended and identified him as the
person who had robbed them of various small sums of money and other property;
and amongst them was a little child nine years of age, and off whose ears he tore a
É. of earrings of the value of 5s., and at the time the poor little thing's ears were
leeding from the torn wounds in the flesh."
Well, for this MR. MILes, all things considered, F.M. Mr. Punch
would have prescribed, first, an opportunity of becoming very intimately
acquainted with that interesting object of natural history, the Nine-
Tailed Cat, and then, when medical attentions should have overcome
any little excitement that interview might have occasioned, MR. MILEs
should have been requested to devote the next ten years of his valuable
life to some such work as the cleansing old sewers, and old cesspools
(like those which poison Brighton), always under such superintendence
as should ensure his not neglecting the interests committed to him.
But Punch and Chaplains do on this divide, for see here:—
“When searched there were found on the prisoner his ticket-of-leave and a letter
written by the Chaplain of Dartmoor Prison to a gentleman in town, recommending the
prisoner as a proper subject to be sent abroad."
“Sent abroad.” His ticket of leave exchanged for a passport dul
visé, and this interesting. MILEs remitted to plunder little ºr.

disport themselves on the
reds of children in towns and cities would be glad to recreate themselves
after school-hours. The dogs are very much better lodged and cared for than many of our agricultural
labourers; for the hounds' dwellings are clean, warm, and well ventilated, and they have º of fresh air,
It is a great reflection on some landlords—both in this and ot
abourers on their estates are certainly worse housed, and perhaps not anything like so well fed as the Steven-

children, or to tear earrings out of the bleeding ears of little Dutch
children, who are rather famous for such ornaments. This is the Gaol
Chaplain's notion. . He may well reply to Mr. Punch's proposal for the
Great Fool Prizes, by quoting Achilles:–
“Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,
Should our immortal coursers take the plain."
CALLING NAMES.
WHERE are the old familiar names?
John and JANE and MARY and JAMEs?
We never hear of a Susan now,
And it’s not BILL, but FREDERIC, who follows the plough.
You'll not travel far by Second Class rail,
But you are sure to encounter some FLORENCE pale,
With much aspiration towards fashion in dress,
But with never a trace of loveliness |
Our laundress's infants have no great charms,
Yet they have an EugéNIE in arms;
While Victor ALBERT swings on a gate,
And munches his bacon in village state.
'Twould be hard to say there is any blame,
There is no monopoly in a name;
But it strikes one sometimes as rather absurd
That contrast between the child and the word.
And what will it be when years have flown?
And these finely-named damsels are women grown?
When EvelyNADA must polish the grates,
While EDITH AMELIA is washing the plates!
Think of it then, ye sensible mothers,
Before you arrange fine names for the others;
For though not to-day, nor perhaps next Sunday,
It will happen as sure as my name's MRs. GRUNDY.

PUNCH TO SOUTHWARK.
Now, Southwark, look alive. You have had one awful warning from
Mr. Punch, and this second is given in pure charity and kindness.
Make LAYARD safe. That’s all. As for the other candidates, the fact
that they did not instantly withdraw, with apologies, the moment Mr.
Punch pronounced for Nineveh, fatally proves them to be utterly unfit
for any employment whatever, except perhaps carrying about sandwich
lacards with “LAYARD for Ever” on them. R. FAwcETT is the
est, but as the gentleman is unfortunately disqualified from examining
the pictures in Punch, it is clear that he can never be in a condition
exactly to appreciate the position of important questions. As for the
Qonservative, he is simply and absurdly in the way. And as for a MR.
ScovelL, the third party, who seems to rest his claim upon having
done something to bring more barges to the wharves of his friends on
the Southwark side, he may be a very good Bargee, but has no claim
to be a Senator. We observed that one of his most strenuous Sup-
porters cried out that “they didn't want none of LAYARD's Roman
stones there,” and the intellectual observation shows the calibre of the
Scovellian set. Come, Southwark, throw over the trio of .
and exalt yourself among boroughs by electing a Scholar, a Gentleman
and a Statesman, who moreover has been a #.ter, and (mark) will
be a Minister again.
By the way, some folly has been uttered about the “refutation” of MR.
LAYARD's statements as to the wicked system by which our soldiers
were destroyed in the Crimea. So they were refuted, and thus: A man
says “I saw twelve black men on the pavement.” It turns out that one
of the twelve was on the kerbstone, and one was a sweep. Thus he has
been refuted. That was what the military pettifoggers did when they
tried to refute MR. LAYARD. And the Reforms he demanded were
subsequently effected. That is another refutation. Once more, South-
wark, do your duty, or -

wish I could send you the pattern. It is a perfect love—the most
angelic thing I ever saw—so ſight, and graceful, and easy, and so coin-
fortable that one feels as though one was swimming through the air with
it. Of course, it is thoroughly French. I got mine at Boulogne in the
Grande Rue." It is beautifully made, and with an extra case, whic
unbuttons down the front, and allows the steels º out, as easily
as you would pull a pair of scissors out of their leather, sheath.
There is no stitching to the steels, I need not tell you. ... This is a ver
great convenience, as it enables a lady to send her Crinoline to the was
with the same ease as she would an ordinary petticoat. The body is

PUNCH*S PLAN FOR PREVENTING WAR.
(Registered Prospectus.)
EveRYBody knows why there is now no Duelling. People may some;
times talk nonsense about the world having grown more sensible and
humane, or they may talk other nonsense about its having been time
for gentlemen to discard duelling when it, descended to the lower
orders, e.g. the celebrated case where the barber fought the linendraper
on a question of honour, and the shaver of beards winged the shaver
of ladies. The law may have had a little to do with it, but the law is
not always regarded with the reverence due to it, ladies smuggle lace,
easants occasionally poach, and gentlemen gamble behind iron-doors.
here was something more than civilisation, pride, or respect for the
law required to put an end to private war.
Life Assurance did it. - - -
Every decent man's life is assured, and policies are declared forfeit
if the decent man is put out of the way by a duel. So nobody
challenges anybody, or if any wild Irishman, vicious Frenchman, or any
other valueless life were to invite an assured life, to the combat, the
assured life would knock the other life down, and then assign him to
the police.
Why not try this excellent remedy on a large scale.
Let a Company be formed to be called the ThroNE Assurance
SocIETY.
But as kings never, die, the object of the Society must be to make
a king comfortable in his circumstances by paying him a bonus at
specific times, and by advancing him money on the usual conditions of
assurance offices. His reign would then be always º and comfortable.
But, if he goes to war, the Policy shall be void, and the Throne
Company is to have a right to confiscate his taxes, and send the other
kings, who have been his securities, to quod. -
The speculation would answer uncommonly well, for subjects would
be too º to see that the premiums, which preserve them from the
miseries of war, were regularly paid up. - -
The Office would not be liable if a King were kicked out by his own
subjects, as a Sovereign with the command of money ought to be able
to make his people perfectly content. - - -
Sovereigns would of course have to submit to the usual examination.
A King proposing to assure might be asked:—
1. How about your Constitution? - - -
2. Haye you ever been afflicted with Divine Right, or any other
intº f
3. Have any of your ancestors died violent deaths, as by the block,
guillotine, private strangulation, &c. -
Are you subject to Priests, or any similar affliction?
5. Give the name of your political adviser, and say how long he has
known you.
6. Are you assured in the Holy Alliance, or any other old office?
Further details will be published in due course. In the meantime,
Mr. Punch, Provisional Director and Manager, invites the consideration
of Capitalists to his scheme. It appears to him to be a noble ide
entirely in conformity with the spirit of the age, and highly calculate
to bring about the Millennium.
N.B. The valuable service of MR. John BRight will, if possible, be
retained for the Actuary's Department.
A STINGING HEAD.DRESS.
WE read in one of the Magazines of Fashion as follows:–
“Pretty little caps are worn of a round form encircled with a ruche.”
Now, from what we recollect of our French, a ruche is a hive, and
we can hardly imagine that as being about the most becoming straw
bonnet that a lady could wear. We know that many of the beautiful
sex carry their love of the fashions to a degree of madness, but still to
encircle one's face with a hive, would be decidedly so certain a method
of ſº “a bee in one's bonnet” that we cannot believe any woman
in her senses would think of lending her countenance to it. It is true
that bees delight to live in the neighbourhood of flowers, such as
gallantry delights in poetically supposing bloom perennially on lovely
woman’s features; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether the most flori-
cultural beauty would like to expose the roses and tulips of her
countenance to the risk of being stung, even if she could be sure
that from the honied result there would be distilled for her the very
“sweetest of bonnets.”

tº EveRely accurate as our de-
scriptions hitherto have been,
they will henceforth be immea-
surably surpassed in that par-
ticular. For our knowledge
of Costume we have no longer

old effigies, and half-illegible
black-letter chronicles. The

and as these volumes will be
further enriched by the de-
scriptive pencil of our artist,
= they will surpass all that has
hitherto been added to the
history of costume by our
pen.
According to the chroni-
clers, the clothes worn at the
close of the fifteenth century
were so foolish and fantastical
that, with persons of dis-
tinction, it was difficult to
distinguish one sex from the
other. This indeed might
have been said with almost
equal truth of other eras in
our history, but in the time
of HeNRY THE SEventh it was specially made applicable, not merely
by the fashions, but by the very names of the garments which were
worm, and which were called, as well as cut, the same, for male, and
female use. Thus in a curious old manuscript called Jº Boke ºf
Curtasye, the chamberlain is ordered to provide against his master's
uprising “a clene sherte and breche, a pettycote, a doublette, a long
cotte, a stomachere, hys hozen, hys socks, and hys schoen”. The
order in which these articles were usually put on is indicated in
another writing called “y" Boke of Kervynge,” which, in language
somewhat culinary, gives the following quaint recipe, whereof the title
might be written. How to Dress a Dandy.
“Warme your soverayne hys petticotte, his doublett, and his stomacher, and
then putt on hys hozen, and then hys schone or slippers, then stryten up hys hozen
mannerly, and tye them up, and then lace hys doublett hole by hole.”
FashionABLE GENT in the Most APPROVED
“Duck-bills" of THE PERIOD. 1485.
It may not be unfairly questioned whether en revanche for the
betaking of their husbands to wear stomachers and petticoats, the
ladies now and then were tempted to try putting on the breeches; in
which practice there perhaps may not have been such peril, when there
was no such refuge extant as SIR CREsswell. CREsswell's Court.
A curious cargo of descriptions of the dresses then in fashion is con-
veyed to us in BARcLAY's famous Ship of Fooles, which was launched
in print by PYNson in the year 1508. Among other particulars con
cerning the nobility we hear of “gorgeous parties” (as they would
now be called)—
“Whose necks were charged with collars and with chaines,
In golden withes, their fingers full of rings:
Their necks naked almost unto the raines,
Their sleeves blazing like unto a crane's wings."
Besides their almost feminine passion for fine jewellery, the gentle-
men of this age were vastly proud of their fine linen, and to show their
shirt sleeves used to slash their coats. Another way in which they
effected this display was by severing their coat-sleeves into two or
more divisions, which were tied together by means of “points,” or
laces, between which the shirt sleeve, being made quite loose and full
was suffered to peep out. The hosen too were sometimes slashed an
puffed above the knee, or differently coloured there to the portion
underneath: a fashion that foreboded the severance of the hosen into
stockings and trunk hose, which division in the course of the next
century took place.
Instead of the long shoes of the last preceding reigns, the feet were
now encased in enormously broad beetlecrushers, the toes whereof says
PARADIN, “did oftentimes exceed the y” measure of a good foote,” so
that men who had good feet could hardly have walked with comfort in
them. Clumsy as they were, however, they must at least have been
more comfortable than the long-toed shoes, which sometimes for con-
venience were chained up to the knees, so that dancers must have
jangled like the men at minor theatres who do hornpipes in stage
fetters. Indeed, for aught we know, the dandies may have danced to
their own music, for we have said that peals of bells were sometimes
worn upon the baldrick; and when their jingling was added to the
jangling of the knee-chains, we can fancy what a promenade concert
was produced. One of the old balladists draws notice to this fashion,
in lines which have been parodied by some more modern poet, but
which were originally printed in black-letter, thus:-
“33iot a coath-horst to Charingt its Crosst,
3mb ste 3Lord Com ſºlobbit ſiggth out in fullt forct:
&Hitſ; brils on bus balbrickt and chaints to bis tors,
#tt shal bapt musick inherturr jt gots.”
We should add that as a sort of stepping place between the long
shoes, and the wide ones, a shoe had been in fashion about five fingers
in length, and at the toe extending to nearly a hand's breadth. In
some of the old manuscripts
this shoe is termed a slipper,
and in winter doubtless the
name was not inapplicable.
From their shape these
shoes or slippers were de-
nominated duck-bills; but
as far as we can learn, there
is no proof extant that
volunteers made use of
them in practising the
goose-step.
... To jump from toe to top,
it must be mentioned that
the nobles wore their hair
so long that it fell below
their shoulders, thus re-
viving . the fashion of the
time of HeNRY the FIRST.
Faces, we are told expressly
“were shaved, clean,” an
it is just possible that they
were sometimes washed so:
of which fact, however, in
the absence of good proof S
that the nobility in general
were then well off for soap,
we must entreat their spirits
to suffer us a doubt.
Apparently the hood had
almost disappeared, though
in outlandish country places
it doubtless was still visible; just as now-a-days one sees in the
ball-room at Old Fogyborough, the blue coats and brass buttons
which were once the go at Alnacks. For head-cover the dandies
wore broad felt hats and caps, and things which were called bon-
nets, made of yelvet, cloth, and fur. These bonnets were scarcely
more commendable for elegance than are their spoon-shaped namesakes
of the present day. They chiefly were conspicuous for the absence of
good taste, and the presence of a monstrous plume or bunch of ſeathers,
which made a dandy's head look almost lſ. a peacock's tail. That
these plumed head-dresses were purchased quite as much for ornament
as they were for use, may be inferred from the fact that they are very
frequently shown slung behind the back, covering it completely from
the shoulder to the knee. In these cases the wearer, or we should
more rightly say the bearer, perched on his head a little cap about as
lºgº as a muſlin, or else covered his crown with a few inches of gold
nel.
Peculiar also to this period was a peculiarly shaped cap, which card.
players will hardly need us to describe, for a drawing of it is shown on
each of the four knaves. Other queer-shaped hats and caps were like:
wise then in fashion, some of which our artist, with the help of his old
manuscripts, has been able to depict. From these glimpses at the
truth, we think our readers will be quite as much prepared as we
ourselves are to credit the old chronicler, who informs us that “ye
small boys did make ſun of ye grete folke, and when a dandy passed
them, dyd crie out ‘Who's *::::::::::::: * * *

“I DECLARE,” said Chief Justice Cockburn, losing for once his
good temper, “that woman is more stubborn than amule,” alluding to a
certain lady's maid, who is always bringing actions against everybody
and who is the terror and bete noire, in consequence, of both Bench and
Bar; “Yes, I º that that poor misguided woman is more stubborn
than a mule.” Glad of the opportunity, BARON BRAMwell immedi-
ately remarked, “Exactly so, Brother Cockburn—the comparative of
Mule is of course Mulier.”

the duration of the entertainment should be

to offer a few sugges-

remarks will perhaps
have greater weight
if I mention, with all

ammyself a performer

THE Tralee Chronicle has a remarkable con-
clusion to its record of a recent interment.
We have simply altered the names of the place
where it took place, and of the deceased:—
“The remains were deposited in the family tomb at
Blunderbuss Castle, which, of the many warm hearts
we have known in life, now slumbering in its time-
honoured cemetery, holds not one which beats with a
warmer or a kinder pulse than that of TIMothy Thady
MULLIGAN."
How the Tralee Chronicle justifies the inter-
ment of a gentleman whose heart is still beating
with a warm and kind pulse, or indeed what the
above elegantly complicated sentence means at
all at all, Mr. Punch knows not, and merel
submits the scrap as a Curiosity of Iris
Literature.
Then this here LAYARD's as poor as a mouse, and ScovelL he is rich,
And in course at an election time he’s safe to behave as sich,
And to open the public 'ouses and pay canvassers, agents, and runners, L

Then this here LAYARD’s always a gettin' hisself in hot water,
And a goin' in at the big-wigs, and, in course, mostly catching a Tartar
But ScovelL will ... own business—wich that’s Southwark, and

There was old CHARLEY NAPIER was all very well,—though he was

Of a man that spends his time digging rubbish, not worth an 'inion,
Instead of sticking to business, like Scoy ELL, and º fortin',

AUSTRIA IN RAGS.
HERE's a pretty mess the, thrones are in
upon the Continent! Nearly all the Royal trea-
suries have stuck over their doors the words
“Suspension of cash payments!” The Pope
as scarcely a crazia, the SUITAN hardly a
piastre, and the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA scarce
a kreutzer at his banker's. What's to be done,
and who that is the momentous question.
Well, , Here, let us see. The Pope sends round
his old tiara to beg for a few pence; the Turk
borrows a few millions at doubled interest from
the French: and the Austrian, yes, this is how he
hopes to raise the wind: readers of the Daily
News had the account last week thus stated:—
“A decree dated Schönbrun, Nov. 17, and signed
“FRANCIs-Joseph,” authorises the issue of notes of the
value of fourpence. These bits of paper are to bave
the character of a new Austrian money, and their falsifi-
cation or forgery is to be punishable according to the laws
of the currency of higher denominations.”
Well, these little bits of paper will serve, at
all events, to show how the wind blows, although
they mayn't much help to raise it. Fancy, what
would people say if the Old Lady of Thread-
needle Street were reduced to such a state that
the Government had to issue, fourpenny bank
notes for her 1 Imagine the disgust of a
Brompton ’buss conductor on receiving a small
scrap of rather dirty paper, and being told it
was a legal equivalent for fourpence 1 (By the
way, the slang for this sum is a “Joey.” So the
notes are not unaptly signed by FRANCIs-Joseph:
only FRANK is short for FRANCIS, and a note
which passes current for a Joey and a Franc
should be worth fourteenpence we think instead
of fourpence), Certainly, the Austrians must
be on the brink of bankruptcy, or they would
not be driven to such desperate expedients to
keep their heads above water. Their credit
must indeed be a tottering concern if they
have nothing but such ſlimsy props as fourpenny
banknotes for it. ... In spite of all their careful
cooking of the national accounts, it cannot be

the State is issuing fourpenny bank-notes.
WOOD DEMON.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I HEAR a great deal of Spirit-Rapping Mediums and ‘Table-
Turning’; in fact, I hear of little else; for up our way—that is, Islington
—we have several societies more or less devoted to the mysteries of a
séance. Now of the rapping I know nothing, nor of the Mediums
either, except that, my boy, GEORGE, who learns Latin, tells me the
word means ‘a go between,” which information quite reconciles me to
º want of acquaintance with such folks. But of tables you may—
when I tell you I am an auctioneer and broker—believe I know some-
thing. Lor, bless me! what lots of tables I have had under my hands:
tables of all sorts—and there’s a tolerable variety. There's the
universal, round, the economic Pembroke, the family dining, the
frequent loo, and others that are only occasional. How often have I
seen a bevy of brokers standing round, say, a rosewood loo, leaning
more or less heavily on it as # considered its value or tested its
workmanship, each doubtless thinking of turning it over to some
customer; and yet all this so frequently have I seen without one
eccentric attempt on the part of any table to turn or move!
“Now, Mr. Punch, to speak in a brokerly way, I am a ‘man in
É...". of my senses, and I want to know why a committee of
rokers, should not be called to give evidence as to their belief in the
disposition of tables to turn, so that their convictions on the subject
may throw some light on the seeming choice that spirits have to affect
tables above all other articles. In the meantime the Spiritualists
j refer to their Mediums for information on the same point; and
really if they don't give some satisfactory reason, the sooner the tables
are turned upon them and their nonsense the better, for with us
brokers the matter is É. to be serious. One old lady, last week,
refused a splendid mahogany square because it ‘ran’ easily on its
gastors, being, as she affirmed, afraid it had been in a turning family.”
Now, iſ, Fºnº you can easily see this is likely to affect our business
materially, so I do hope you will do all you can for us, and

PAYMASTERS OF THE INDIAN ARMY.
ONE day last week a respectable looking man named Rowland
MucKLEston E was indicted at the Central Criminal Court for having
“applied to his own use a cheque that had been intrusted to him ſor a
specific purpose.”... He was ſound guilty—guilty of felony
Many people will be astonished to find that the appropriation by one
person of money given him with a commission to administer it to
others is so serious a crime as that which felony amounts to.
Not but what everybody who is any better than a rogue feels em-
bezzlement to be a peculiarly bad sort of theft, because it is not merely
dishonest, but also dishonourable. But then it is sometimes practised
by gentlemen who hold so decent a position'
There are certain persons notorious for being bad paymasters, of
whom it is commonly said that the money which passes through their
hands sticks to their fingers. In other words, they commit a temporary
embezzlement. Yet many of them shuffle on without being even
shunned and avoided. Some even fill very high situations.
The Delhi prize money remains unpaid. It is in the hands of parties
who, like MR. Mucklestone, though not convicted c.f felony, have
been intrusted with that money for a specific purpose—the purpose of
distributing it among the soldiers who won it three years ago. Who
are the official rogues that are at present embezzling the Delhi prize
money?, Who are the swindlers in Government situations of whom
it may be affirmed, to their º: that the money due to brave
men, who won it with wounds and blood, by unexampled heroism, is
sticking to their fingers?

SUICIDE AND MANSLAUGHTER.
YESTERDAY, at an extraordinary meeting of the Society for the
Amendment of the Law, a paper was rea * Mr. Punch, Q.C., on
the subject of. “Crowner's. Quest, Law.” . The learned gentleman
began by directing the attention of the Society to the subjoined verdict
of a Coroner's Jury touching the death of an unfortunate man who
had died by his own act. The deceased, Thomas BATEs, aged sixty:
one years, a cabinet-maker, disabled, out of work, and destitute, had
applied at the Shoreditch Workhouse for admission as an in-door
pauper. He had been turned away with an order of 18.6d. per week and
a four-pound loaf. This was all he had to live upon. He hanged himself.
“The jury, found—"That the deceased committed suicide by hanging: and the
furors do further say that the act was committed while he was in a state of unsound
mind, through his feelings being operated upon by being refused admission into the
workhouse of Shoreditch.”
Mr. Punch then, reminded the Society that only the week before, in
the case of John WATson, sixty-three years old, starved to death in the
streets, another Jury had agreed to a special verdict to the effect—
“That the deceased died from the effects of exhaustion and the want of the
common necessaries of life, produced by exposure in the public streets, death
having been accelerated by the great neglect of the parochial authorities of St.
Leonard, Shoreditch, when the deceased was in a state of utter destitution and
without a home."
With these cases before them, the Society would be prepared for a
º that an enactment should be framed for the better regu-
ation of the verdicts of Coroners' Juries. If the driver of a locomotive
engine, or a railway guard, happened, by the smallest oversight or least
want of precaution, to cause the loss of human life, a verdict of man-
slaughter was returned against him. A surgeon who had the mis-
fortune to kill his patient by an error in judgment, incurred, in the
event of an inquest, the same impeachment. This was, it should be,
on the principle which some gentlemen avowed, that punishment
should regard acts, and not motives. At least this was as it should be,
so far as it went. But it did not go far enough—on that principle,
everybody who had the misfortune to kill another Qught to be hanged.
Hang misfortune. There ought to be no such, thing as homicide by
misadventure. Hang unlucky individuals for the protection of the
mass; hang consideration; hang justice and all that twaddle! How-
ever, a new law would be #: for this purpose: a law which
would declare the accidental ng of anybody wiſful murder. “
There was this difficulty in the way of such a law; that it would#.
and an end to the railways and abolish the medical profession. The
anxiety of gentlemen to enforce responsibility would deprive them of
engineers, guards, and doctors. As regards these persons it would be
best that the law should remain as it was... Unfortunately it generally
turned out that indictments for manslaughter in cases of homicide by
misadventure could not be sustained, and the accused got off, after
temporary anxiety and incarceration, with mere ruin. An express
statute, therefore, might be passed declaring all acts whatsoever, of
casual omission or commission, resulting in any one's death, man-
slaughter. The only objection to this step was derived from cases
such as those of the Shoreditch paupers of whom one died, and the
other was driven to self-destruction by, the neglect of workhouse
authorities. The projected law might subject officials to a charge of
manslaughter for every wretched pauper whom, they turned away
from the workhouse to starve in the streets. This would never do.
All law was primarily intended for the protection of the ratepayers;
and relieving officers and poor law guardians should enjoy a speci
exemption from liability under the new Act... He would add exemption
from liability under the existing law; for if coroners' juries are, em-
powered to return verdicts of manslaughter against careless railway
servants and doctors, they also have the right, if they choose to exer-
cise it, of sending negligent officials of workhouses, at whose doors lie
the deaths of paupers, to take their trial, at least, for felony.
Mr. Punch concluded by suggesting another alteration in “Crowner's
Quest Law.” . He would ask–Did a man, who, knowing what he was
about, jumped out of a burning ship into the wayes and perished,
commit an act of felo de se?. If not, what should his, drowning him:
self be legally described as ?, “Justifiable Suicide?”. Juries might
perhaps be alſowed to return that yerdict in the case of a pauper who
had hanged himself at once in preference to dying slowly, of cold and
famine. Verdict of respectable Coroner's Jury of the FutureT
Justifiable Suicide If you hold all suicide unjustifiable, you should
make starvation impossible.

OUR WONDERFUL AILIES.
AMoNG the people whom PRINCE ALFRED lately had the honour of
being introduced to in his Visit to the Cape, was a native who, according
to the Times and other newspapers, rejoiced in the imposing title of
“KING MoshesH.”. Now there is something in a name, despite Miss
Juliet's seeming doubt of it; and as that of “Moshesh” may possess
somewhat of interest to some few of our readers, we propose, as we
have nearly half an hour to spare and nothing else we want to do in it,
to furnish a few details concerning this KING Moshesh, who has been
exchanging salutations with our Prince.
By a Black Book, which is studied in high Hottentot society with
º less avidity than our Red Book is in ours, it is stated that
KING MoshesH sprang from Negro extraction, and that on either
side his family is of very ancient date.,,One writer pretends to trace
in a direct line the genealogy of this black sovereign up to our BLAck
PRINCE; while another strives to strengthen this preposterous assertion
by showing how KING Moshesh levies black mail on his subjects, a
practice which was once pursued extensively in England, and which
proves that certain of the ancestors of Moshesh must have had
acquaintance with the customs of that country, if indeed they were not
of true British blood and birth. Other allegations, equally absurd
have been made to prove his Majesty of right royal descent; an
several of the allegators appear inclined to shed some rather croco-
diley tears at their failing to establish this important point. We
regret we cannot say much to assist them in the matter; but seeing
that his skin is somewhat of the sootiest, we think that there are
certainly some grounds for the conjecture that KING, Moshesh is
remotely connected with the potentate now known as Old King Coal.
A Portrait of KING Moshesh, has recently been published in a
Blackamoor, Book of, Beauties, which, we believe, has an extensive
Caffre circulation, and has portraits of the chief celebrities of Fashion
at the Cape. If the King be half as black as he is painted in this
picture, he need not fear that, London smoke would injure his com-
plexion; and as fresh troupes of Niggers are continually coming, it is
not impossible he may be induced to visit us. According to his
}. KING Moshesh's Court costume combines Simplicity with
legance in a remarkable degree. It consists of a dress coat and pants
of the last century, worn over a suit of bears'-grease. For crown, KING
MoshesH usually sports a porkpie hat.

not one inquire in what studio MR. Bounce formed his
acquaintanceship with art, and acquired his proficiency

bragging of his ‘scientific knowledge of external ana-
tomy,” might not one inquire, without being thought rude,
under what physician, his studies were pursued, and in
what dissecting-room the ‘practical experience’ he boasts
of was obtained? I confess that for myself, I should not
much have liked to run the risk of such inquiries, which

hide a false pretence, and no more serve to butter cus-
tomers, than they do to butter parsnips. , Besides, Sir,
after all, an “artist in draping,” is but another phrase for
‘draper,’ and in spite of all the chaff about a man in our

A BOTTLEHOLDER'S ADVICE TO HIS JOHNNY.
BEING AN INTERCEPTED LETTER THAT SHOULD HAVE REACH ED THE
F–N s Y THE DAY BEFORE he RECEIVED The
DEPUTATION ON SPANISH INTOLeRANCE.
“MY DEAR John, -
- “I see that you have promised to receive a deputation of
serious blokes who feel aggravated because a couple of Spaniards, one
a soldier and the other a hatter, are being persecuted in their own
country for taking to Protestantism... Now, as your Premier, I am
particularly desirous that you should, if possible, avoid making another
mull just now; and therefore ‘this letter comes hopping' (as the
woman said), that you will be pleased to mind what you are about.
My having recently declared you to be rather, on the whole, superior
to SQLOMON in wisdom, and to HAMPDEN in patriotism, entitles me to
speak a friendly word to you, to say nothing of the increased responsi-
biſh which I took upon myself by that generous declaration. -
“I am the more nervous about it, because there is a theological
elephant—element I mean—in the business. You always get into a
mess when you have to deal with such matters. Between friends, one
may talk of oneself, and there are few people who have ny happy
knack of dealing with theology. You can't forget how I knocked over
the orthodox doctrine, and instructed my hearers that all babies were
born good. . Well, if #. had said this, the Archbishops would have
torn their wigs, and there would have been a row in Exeter Hall that
you might have heard at Woburn. But I smashed the Article as
neatly as you would–or rather would not—smash the pipe of Aunt
Sally, and with, as much applause. I wish I had to see these Anti-
Spanish-Popery bloaters to-morrow. -
“Now, please John NY, don't promise anything. For Ideclare to you
that I will not have a row about a hatter and a soldier. As for the
hatter-Q, John Ny, I ought to have seen the deputation. What a
capital bit I should have got out of him! “Without wishing to display
levity on a serious subject, the noble Lord went on to say, it was
really enough to make one as mad as a hatter to hear of such tyranny
(laughter), and whatever the poor fellow's hats might be, his convic.
tions must indeed be felt (great laughter).” ey, John NY, ho,
JQHNNY, you can't afford epigrams like those, and therefore you do
wisely in not attempting them. But confound the hatter, why doesn’t |}
he attend to his business, instead of muddling over theology? We
can't get up sympathy for a hatter at any price, my boy, so do you take
the matter uncommonly easy. -
“I need not tell you that you may go the entire animal about liberty
of conscience, auto da fº (mind you pronounce it º ToRQUEMADA,
PHILIP The SEconD, and all that kind of thing. That is in your
way, and if you like a retrospective shy at SANGUINARY Polly, I do
not know that anybody will object, except MR. FRowDE. But be sure
that you do not give any undertaking to remonstrate with the Spanish
Government, for if you do, I shall be obliged to repudiate the obliga-
tion. I know that you would like to write a despatch like NoLL
CROMwell's about the Waldenses,...but you musn't... Times are
changed, and if the Spanish people like to roast a heretic soldier and
hatter, I cannot think that the true spirit of civilisation permits the
English to object. I said something of the same kind the other day,
when they wanted me to send out, ships and prevent the KING OF
DAHOMEY from cutting off a couple of thousand of his subjects'
heads, by way of spending a pleasant birth-day. We won't interfere.
You know that I have always been celebrated for never interfering
in flºº else's business. - -
“I confess I am in a fidget about you and this deputation, because
it affords just one of the pegs on which you delight to hang a blunder,
and really you must not... Of course I acquit you of any such nonsense
as caring a farthing whether all the hatters in Spain were hung to-
morrow, with your friend DR. CUMMING's last book tied to their necks;
but you have a Dissenting twang about you, and you always want to
make yourself acceptable to the Non-Cons. All very right, in its way,
but Dissenting admiration may be bought too dear, and decidedly any
pledge to try and deliver these Protestant coves would be an extrava-
gant price for a cheer at the next Missionary Meeting. ... Suppose you
did commit us to anything of the kind, and I let you write the sort of
despatch you would like, protesting against the persecution of Spanish
Protestants... Don't you see that it would be giving the other side the
most splendid opportunity of .# you to mind your own business?
It is just what Spain would like to do just now, being still sore about
having had to pay us our money, and being also in a state of sympathy
with your friend the Pope, whom we have treated so kindly. , You
would have back the most insolent answer that could be devised, and
it would come like a potatoe with a stone in him, as my Irish friends
say, because it would have a backbone of common sense. Please,
John NY, don't expose us to such a missile. -
“Now get to work on your Reform Bill, and bother, all, Spanish
hatters, converted and unconverted. ...Get your details right this time,
and don't give EDw1N JAMEs another step towards the Solicitor-
Generalship. Try and make a coherent bill, and if you can't do it
ourself, humble yourself before BETHELL a little, and get him to do
it for you. He'll make waterproof work of it, and if you can make
him take an interest in the affair, he’ll stand by you like a brick.
Think of that, which is really #. business, and ease off these serious
bloaters as soon as you can. Bless you, my dear John.
“Ever your devoted “P.”
“The Treasury.”

A VIEW OF OUR WOLUNTEERS AS THEY
THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER,
THE Star-spangled banner that blows broad and brave,
O'er the home of the free, o'er the hut of the slave—
Whose stars in the face of no foe e'er waxed pale, -
And whose stripes are for those that the stars dare assail-
Whose folds every year, broad and broader have grown,
Till they shadow both arctic and tropical zone,
From the Sierra Nevada to Florida's shore,
And, like Oliver Twist, are still asking for more—
That banner whose infantine bunting can boast
To have witnessed the Union's great charter engrossed;
Which at Boston saw Freedom's stout struggle begun,
And from WASHINGTON welcomed its victory won–
For our fathers in rebel defiance it spread,
But to us it waves brotherly ‘....: instead;
And Concord and Peace, not Bellona and Mars,
Now support England's Jack and the States' Stripes and Stars.
Çan it be there are parricide hands that would tear
§ star-spangled banner, so broad and so fair?
And if there be hands would such sacrilege try,
Is the bunting too weak the attempt to defy?
Alas! while its woof Freedom wove in her loom,
She paused in her work, and the Fiend took her room,
And, seizing the shuttle that Freedom had left,
Threw Slavery's warp across Liberty's weft.
How the Fiend laughed and º as the swift shuttle flew,
With its blood-rotted threads, the fair weſt running through,
"Now cut out your web—it is broad, it is long—
Twixt Fiend's work and Freedom's, let’s hope it is strong!”
And now that the blood-rotted warp is worn bare,
WILL NEWER BE SEEN BY THE ENEMY |
For the Fiend cheers on those who to rend it essay,
And the work he's had hand in is apt to give way.
Now Heaven guide the issue! May Freedom's white hands
'Ere too late, from the flag pluck these blood-rotted strands,
And to battle and breeze fling the banner in proof
That 'tis all her own fabric, in warp as in woof.
If this may not be, if the moment be nigh

but the announcement of BENEDER's §: is accompanied by a
contemporary with the following agreeable remark:—
"BENEDER is still in the flower of his age, having just completed his fifty-sixth
year."
This statement is so calculated to give Fº to our senior readers
that we gladly afford it the benefit of our enormous circulation.
Happy shall we, be if, we shall thereby, succeed in rousing any
despondent middle-aged, gentleman, who thinks that he is getting
old, and is delivering himself over to the blue devils, out of his

start forth in good spirits for a wholesome “constitutional.” Many

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BIT OF REAL BURLESQUE.
As Christmas is approaching, the , writers of burlesques are busy
looking out for subjects; and it perhaps may be refreshing to their
facetious faculties if they cast their comic eye on this *ś para-
graph, which a correspondent sends us from a weekly Plymouth
print:—
“STRINGENT LAws AT PENzAxor 11—The authorities, acting, it would appear
under regulations adopted for the proper government of the Market, caused MR.
PETER John Richards, an old and well known butcher of the town, to be summoned
on Monday last, for appearing in the Market and carrying on his business without
having on a clean apron and sleeves. It appeared from the evidence, that this respect-
able tradesman wore a blue frock or blouse, and that such had been his custom for 47
years. He refused to change to the new fashion, contending that there was no law
to compel him to do so. After a remonstrance from the Mayor the butcher said,
* If convicted, I shall carry it to a higher court. A nuisance, indeed You may see
if I am a nuisance' (raising his blouse); ‘my trousers, shirt, and drawers are all
clean; the Bench may strip me if they please and see whether I am a nuisance,’
4. laughter). MR. PEARCE, the officer of the Court. “You must not insult the
ourt." The Mayor. “The blouse you have produced is not an apron and sleeves."
Defendant. ‘Better still, it is an apron and sleeves all in one, and it is perfectly
clean." In reply to the Mayor, the Beadle said, all the butchers in the Market
appeared with sleeves and aprous. The Mayor. “MR. Richauds, we must carry out
the law, and you are fined ls. and the expenses.' Defendant. ‘My case does not
come within the meaning of the Act, and I won't pay a penny." The Mayor. “I am
sorry even to mention the alternative, but there is seizure of goods and imprison-
ment provided by the act for those who won't pay.' Defendant. Not a penny will
I pay, You may incarcerate me, you may make me drink the waters of affliction
and the bread of punishment, you may take me to the Green Market, tie me to
a stake, pile up the faggots, and burn une to a cinder before I will pay' (loud laughter).
The Mayor. “Oh our remedy inflicts no martyrdom: the unpaid fine only requires
a distress warrant.' . Defendant. “You may take away my bed, if you like; you'll
have to answer to a higher court, MR. ToM Bolitho told me you missed your point
in taking out your warrant.'. The Mayor. “It is time for you to learn better." De-
fendant. “Well, Sir, I shau't be much longer in the market.’”
It would need but slight invention to make a really first-rate funny
scene of this. , Were it adapted for a pantomime, of course the part of
Butcher would be played by Clown, while Pantaloon would figure with
his brethren on the Bench. An attitude of digital defiance to the law
presented by Clown's stretching out his fingers from his nose, woul
doubtless draw a roar of hearty laughter from the Gallery; and if, to
close the scene, he bonneted the Beadle, and then touched up the
Mayor with the point of a hot poker, the pantomime would certainly
achieve a great success.
The scene might also quite as fitly be used in a burlesque, or, if need
be, might be spun out into a whole piece of the extravaganza sort.
The First Act might be occupied with the usual fairy business, with
tableaua of little incidents in the hero's early life. We should see him
in the cradle, at school, and making lº, and then, through means of
the Bad Fairy, getting his ears boxed and being sent about his business.
To him, mood; and disgusted, and meditating suicide by swallowing
“South African,” should come in the Good Fairy to set him up in
trade, giving him the Magic Blouse, warranted by her to last clean
without washing for “forty-seven years.” At the moment of investiture
the Bad Fairy should appear in the form of an Old Magpie, and should
intimate by pantomime of pecking at the Butcher's boots that, though
she could not stop the gift, but little good should come of it, and that
if the Blouse were worn the wearer would be brought to grief. Here
the music might be borrowed from the celebrated trio in the Mountain
Sylph (“This magic-wove Blouse,” &c., &c.), after which the Magpie
should be hooted and hop off, and to a Chorus of Congratulation the
..". # ºut Busin might bring the act-drop down upon a Dance
of Delight.
In the Second Act we ought to see the Butcher in his blouse,
P.": and happy, and on the point of being married to the
rincess who had jilted him, and had boxed his ears. On the day
before the wedding she might come to him to buy some beefsteaks for
the breakſast, and this would nicely give occasion for some sentimental
husiness, with the usual admixture of Mozaar and Nigger Melody,
terminating, of course, in the usual comic dance. Then the Mappie
should hop in and aggravate the Butcher by indulging in a furtive
wink at the Princess. Wowing vengeance for such impudence, the
Butcher then should chevy the Mº with his cleaver, and at last
succeed in chopping off its tail. ith a meaning croak of mischief
away would fly the bird, and the happy lovers would resume their
comic dance, too soon, alas! to be cut short by a Policeman, who,
with a rattle in his hand and the Magpie at his back, should arrest the
blissful Butcher for having been a “nuisance,” because he had been
seen at market in his blouse. Into the details of the scene in Court
we need not enter, for the report which we have quoted suggests them
clearly enough. . Nor, need we take the trouble to describe the
language that might fittingly be used, for .."; more funny than
the words which we have cited it would puzzle the most clever of
burlesque-wrights to invent. The scene of course might be a parody
of those so often witnessed in our trans-Thamesian melodramas, where
threats are hurled, and fingers snapped, at all legal authorities, where
justice is defied and judges are denounced in the huskiest of voices
and the haughtiest d struts. As a specimen, for instance, a portion
of the Butcher's speech on hearing condemnation, might run thus:–
“Ha! Minion You may rack me with the tor-r-r-ments of the
----- - - ------- - ---------
torture-chamber, you may load these legs with fetters and these limbs
with irrºr-on gyves-you may haply make me drink the bitter waters
of hafliction, and hemaciate my car-r-r-r-case with the coarsest prison
fare, but know you that beneath the blouse of the º: butcher there
beats an 'eart as 'aughty as that of any spangled noble in the land ' "
We have said enough, we think, to show how well The Blue Blouse.”
Butcher, or, Peter of Penzance would do to be placarded as a Christmas
piece. Whether we have also said enough to show how justice is
occasionally burlesqued in country courts, and with what trifles the
“authorities”, of our old beadle-ridden boroughs often trouble their
wise heads and allow their precious time to be engaged, our readers at
their pleasure and their leisure may decide.
STALE BEER | -
Good people all, on you I call
To lend me a patient ear,
Whilst a song I sing of a horrible thing;
A brewer supplying stale beer!
Now I honour and revere
The purveyor whose ale is sincere;
But do despise the brewer who tries
To do a poor man with stale beer.
He had bought the drink, fit to throw in the sink,
From a certain trade-compeer;
But not paying his friend, was sued, in the end,
For the price of the bad stale beer.
ow I honour, &c.
This case of hum into Court did come,
In the Times it doth appear, -
Where the story you’ll find of the man of low mind
Who is noted for selling stale beer.
Now I honour, &c.
A dead take-in is swipes too thin:
When 'tis likewise flat and queer .
The brewer who puts such stuff in his butts
Should be drowned in a butt of stale beer.
Now I honour, &c.
This trash in beer's shape had a narrow escape
Of costing our soldiers dear;
To Gibraltar it went, then back was sent;
For the troops wouldn't stand stale beer.
Now I honour, &c.
Hog-wash by right, at half-price not quite,
The plaintiff sold it here:
For Christians' supply what a shame to buy
That nasty and cheap stale beer!
Now I honour, &c.
In future Jews I’ll ne'er abuse !
A fellow, Thames Walton near,
Deserving stripes, buys villanous swipes
To mix with the haymakers’ beer |
Now I honour, &c.
To trifle with thirst of all crimes is worst,
Most cruel and severe.
How the people will shout, as that chap goes about,
Crying, “Who sold the mowers stale beer?”
'Now i honour, &c.
COPPERS FOR THE TRIPLE CROWN.
The subjoined telegram is calculated to reassure the faithful:—
“AC65,000 of Peter's Pence have arrived from Ainerica.”
The Pops complains of persecution; but he seems to be making a
very good thing of it. His paternal heart may be sadly grieved by the
attacks which are made on the see of Peter, but must derive no small
consolation from the Peter's Pence which flow into his paternal pocket.
The pocket of the Holy Father may be said to be lacerated no less than
the heart; at least there is a hole in it at which all the money runs out
to pay troops and purchase ammunition. This might soon be mended
if he would renounce bayonets, abjure guns and gunpowder, and send
his army to the right about. , His Holiness would then be both pocket-
whole and heart-whole, and would no longer give the incorrigible
scoffer occasion to call him more holy than righteous. No reasonable
man would grudge the Pope any number f Peter's Pence that his
flock may be willing to drop into the tiara of their pastor; but if the
money is spent in soldiering, that application of Peter's Pence will be
even more objectionable than robhing Peter to pay Paul.

PUNCH*S BOOK OF BRITISH COSTUMES.
ChapTER XL-SHOULD BE READ BY ALL TRAGEDIANS
BEFORE THEY DRESS FOR RICHARD III.”
HUs far into the history of
costume having marched on
without impediment, we
come now to describe the
arms and armour of a period
which must interest every
reader who is conversant
with SHAkspeaRE, and they
who are not, are, of course,
unworthy of our thought.
As the Wars of the Roses
ended with the battle of
Bosworth Field, and on the
crook-back tyrant's death
grim-visaged war awhile re-
moved his wrinkled front,
and left fair England to be
faced peace, the reign of
Richard The THIRD, may
be viewed as being the cli-
max of a period of slaughter,
in which the arts of shoot-
ing, swording, stabbing,
spearing, sticking, slitting,
spitting, smiting, smashing,
slashing, and in other ways
destroying, attained the
greatest height of excellence
to which such evils could be
brought. . We who have the happiness of living in a later age, have
the advantage of appliances a million-fold more deadly; and the spears,
and swords, and matchlocks of the fifteenth century, sink into insignifi.
cance beside our Armstrong guns, and Miniés, and other
“Mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dread terrors counterfeit.”
Richał D THE Thield. From a skrtch taxen. At
THE BATTLE OF Bosworth Fort An illustrated
Newspaper or The peniod,
In Richard's time, however, gunpowder was little known, and,
º: less trusted; and plate armour, which was cast aside when
etter guns were cast, was wrought, and *# and bought at figures
as extravagant as the wearers of it cut. hat sort of Guys they
looked when “cased from head to foot in panoply of steel,” the pencil
of our artist will tell better than our pen, and we need only direct the
notice of the nation to such points in his drawings as chiefly mark the
period which they represent.
One of the first things to observe is, the covering of the body from
the waist down over the hips with flexible and horizontal plates of
steel, which it appears were called, either taces or tassets. To the
lowest of these, in front, were affixed two pendent plates that hung to
shield the thighs, and “were called tuiles, from their semblance to the
tiles of a house,” a statement which, if true, serves to show that tiles
Were | as differently shaped then as were hats, to the housetiles
and silk “chimney-pots” which are now in use.
Qther points to notice are the great size of the shoulder-plates,
called otherwise the pauldrons, and the still waster proportions of the
pointed elbow pieces...These were generally fan-shaped, and so large
that at a front view they looked like little shields." Their long pro.
jecting points were sometimes hooked like lion's claws, and were
mostly made 30 sharp, that it could have been no joke to get a poke in
the ribs with them by a funny man who wanted to emphasise a jest.
º the ºf: in these old days were rather proud of the
distortion which in fashionable language is known as a “good figure,”
for their effigies are sadly small about the waist. This elegange, how-
over, they in some cases concealed by wearing a loose tabard, or
emblazoned surcoat, upon which their armorial, bearings, were dis-
º But we sometimes find the tabard made to fit tight to the
body, so as not to hide its fashionable slimness, whereof an instance
18 still visible at East Herling Church in Norfolk, in a window repre-
senting the good knight SIR Ronent WINGFIELp kneeling at his
devotions, with spurs at least a foot in length projecting from his heels.
This fashion of covering the armour with a surcoat was a revival of the
Qustom in the reign of Edward THE Fourth. We may suppose that
knights kept generally a change of tabards in their wardrobe, just as
their descendants keep a change of coats; but how much more costly
were the former than the latter may be inferred from the letter we

present him as “lamely and unfashionable,” and "scarce half made

acknowledged as the latest and the best. For the benefit of readers
who look to us for funniment more than they do for fact, we may add
that Rous at one time earned the name of “Bravo Rous,” from his
habit of purloining good bits from other writers without ever conde-
scending to notice their true authorship. Among the tales he thus
appropriated were several of KING Richard, whom the old chroniclers
concur in describing as a restless and uncomfortable person, always
drawing his ring off and on, or continually sheathing and unsheathing
his dagger, while he was engaged in thought or conversation, as if his
mind was so unquiet that it would not let his fingers rest. The same
uneasiness, says Rous, he showed when trying a new coat on, , or
walking in new boots: indeed in later life his clothes were invariably
altered a dozen times or more ere he would own they fitted him... One
of the stories tells us that, after winning a new hat in a wager with the
Uke or BuckINGHAM, who had bet him that he would not woo and
wed the LADY ANNE, KING RICHARD sent the hat back sixteen times
to be made bigger, and every day just, after breakfast, used to ride
down to the maker's and roar out in blank verse, which he always
spoke when angry:—
“What 1 is my beaver easier than it was ."
ºf this period the †: was as usual attached to the right
hip, while the sword was belted so as to make it hang almost in front,
the top of the hilt being about level with the waist. Hy inclining the
point a little towards, the left, the wearer saved himself from getting
the blade between his legs; but it must have knocked his knee at
every step he took. The admirers of ShakspeaRR doubtless would
contend, if the point were only mooted, that it was in obvious allusion
to this fact that in the play of Richard the Third he makes RichMond
use the phrase:–
“Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath.”
The salade still continued the helmet most in use, and was generally
surmounted with the wearer's crest and chapeau, or else surrounded
with his colours woven in a wreath, and having at the side a feather
made to match. Richard, on his great seal, is represented with a
chapeau over the salade, surrounded by the crown and surmounted with
the lion, which was his kingly crest. The chapeau, we should add, was
a chaplet, not a hat, so readers must not fancy the King looked like an

old clo’man, because he wore three head-covers, chapeau, helm, and
crown, which latter, you remember, was knocked off at Bosworth and
discovered in a bush. .
To close our description, we may mention that the feet were still
engased in long steel sollerets, or shoes of flexible plate; and that to
shield the neck was worn a steel gorget, called a “hausse-col,” which

sounds as though it bore some connection to a horse-collar, and provokes
a misquotation of the sadly hackneyed phrase:—
“At least we'll die with harness on our necks . "
Unlike the horsecollar, however, the hausse-col could have hardly
been big enough to grin through; at least we judge so from the effigies
and other figures bearing it, that look as though they were garotted
and were very nearly chºked."Some such an appearance is presented
in a portrait of the Lord Lovel of SHARSPEARE, who, in the tragedy of
Richard III, has but two lines of speech allotted him (see Act iii., Sc. 7)
which hardly afford the actor much insight to the part. The curious,
however, may learn more about his character from an old ballad which
has lately fallen into our hands, and which, so far as we can learn, has
not . previously in print. Of this the first two verses run, or halt,
as follows:
“3Lorūt 3Lobtl jet stabt at bpg (Tastel boort,
% combpng lips &Higte $urrit,”
&Hiſtn up to bim stalktu jps mothert-in-latur,

I'ut taken mg Cljubbt bgs latti, ktgt 1”
"This allusion to the fact that White Surrey was a charger belonging to Lord
Lovel surely justifies our thinking that, besides his other virtues, KING RICHARD
was a horse-stealer. We merely throw out this suggestion to tragedians who wish
to take a new view of his character, and strike out something original when they
undertake the part.
A GHOST STORY FOR GIRLS AND BOYS,
How sceptical soever we may be on the subject of ghosts, yet when
a story of an apparition is authenticated by evidence taken before a
Magistrate, we must not allow our preconceived ideas, about things
of that sort to Fº us from allowing such testimony its due weight,
no matter to what conclusion it may point. -
no just reason for doubting the truth of the subjoined, statement,
º made the other day at the Thames Police Court, in the presence
of MR. YARDLEY, by Captain Joseph Hossack, master of the ship
º trading between London and Hong Kong. It should be pre-
mised that an entry had been made in the ship's log book of the disap-
pearance of PETER PETERson, the dead steward below alluded to, who
was lost in a gale of wind, and believed to have fallen overboard and
perished in the waves. Eighteen days after this the second mate, who
was in the cabin, stumbled over an obstruction, which felt in the dark
like a man's feet; and upon ** light he discovered under the table
a human form resembling that of the departed steward. It may be as
well to mention that PETERson was a black man, a circumstance which
may be supposed likely to render his identification under the conditions
stated, difficult if not impossible; but subsequent events leave no room
for *ion as to this particular. These are Captain Hossack's
Words:—
“The mate called out to the man at the helm, saying, “Bill, here's the dead
steward 1' BILL came to look, and was so terrified that he rushed back, and
though one of the strongest men in the ship, he went into a fit, and was ill for four
days afterwards.”
So far, to be sure, the facts of the case might be admitted, and
ascribed, as usual, to imagination. But let us proceed:–
“He thought he had seen the steward's ghost. A Newfoundland d
came down at the same time with BILL, was struck with terror, ran back
and jumped overboard and was drowned."
How is this manifestation of terror on the part of the Newfoundland
dog to be accounted for? Indisposition might be a cause sufficient to
produce the appearance which presented itself to the mate; a figure
which he naturally took for that of the defunct steward. Mental
contagion, operating through a nervous system, which, although that
of one of the strongest men of the crew, may probably enough have
been under the influence of grog, and affecting a mind perhaps as we
and superstitious as the frame which it actuated was powerful and
robust, would afford a possible, if not a satisfactory explanation of the
transference of the mate's hallucination_to_BILL, and the consequent
terror, fit, and illness of that seaman. Had the mate and BILL, or to
give him what most likely was his proper name, WILLIAM, been the
only witnesses of the apparition under the table, the mere evidence of
their senses would be inconclusive. But what frightened the New-
foundland dºg? Was the poor animal nervous, or superstitious, or
drunk, that, ‘‘struck with terror,” it “ran back howling and jumpe
overboard and was drowned?” What has incredulity the most deter-
mined to say to that? -
, which

Now, really, there seems ||
Proceeding in the examination of the Police Report, we find that—
“It turned out that the steward had been all the time in the bread-locker, where
he had lived concealed, but he had gone out at night and procured food for himself.”
So, then, the Newfoundland aug jumped overboard to no purpose,
except that of proving himself to have been a very dull dog to mistake
a skulker for a ghost. This foolish act of his must tend to cast great
discredit on the evidence of other Newfoundland dogs; indeed, on the
whºle accumulated testimony of the canine species to the objective
reality of spectres. In connection with ghost-stories, this Newfound.

self. l, that can be said for the sagacity of Nero—if that was the
name,9f. the unhappy dog-is, that the faithful creature perhaps lost
himself in astonishment at the steward's deceit. The most incredible
#: of the story remains to be told. MR. PETER PETERson, after
aving played the crafty trick above described, and been, at the
wnanimous demand of the ship's crew, put in irons for the same, had
the audacity to summon Captain Hossack to the Thames Police Court
for the amount, of his wages at £5 a month=224! He had thrice
before been guilty of playing a similar trick in other vessels. He had
made a pigstye of the bread-locker, wherein he had secreted himself. It
is needless to say that the Magistrate dismissed the summons of this
nigger... Dogs are supposed to have an intuitive perception of character;
and it is possible that when the Newfoundland dog caught sight o
MR. PETERson under the table, he was immediately frightened out of
his wits at seeing such a monster of impudence, and threw himself
overboard in a paroxysm of canine madness.

PILL-MAKING AND BILL-MAKING.
ARE the Homoeopathic Doctors homoeopathic in their fees? Do
they, after dosing you with microscopic medicines, send in microscopic
charges for the cure? Are their bills, as infinitesimal as the globules
they serve out to serve in lieu of pills? Because, if so, we really
should be tempted, the next time that we feel a little out of sorts, to
pay a visit to a Homoeopath instead of to an Allopath, on the ground
of the less fee that we shall have to pay for it...It is bad enough to
bear the torments of an illness, without having the infliction of a big
bill at the end of it. And really some doctors run up such wondrously
long bills that had they been born lawyers they could scarcely have
i. longer ones. For instance, in the case of DENIson v. DENT, the
Surgeon's little, account for not three months' attendance was in
ak | evidence alleged to be £962; and this, be it remembered, was merely
for attendance, and was exclusive of the charge of £76.14s. 3d. that
had been brought for pills, wherewith the wretched patient during that
brief period had nightly been besieged. Surely such a bombardment
of boluses as this is enough to frighten anyone of ordinary nerves; and
when one thinks of being charged well nigh a thousand pounds for
some ten weeks' attendance, one instinctively determines to do all
within one's power to keep oneself in health. There is no denying a
good Doctor in one's needſ is a friend indeed; but we cannot help
d|exclaiming, “Save us from such friends!” when we find such cause
for fear that, dearly as we prize them, their prices may still prove them
to be dearer than we think,

So it is with the Romans, those blackguards, just now.
Which our gallant Brigade, winning honour and glory,
Have vainly been fighting to make them allow.
So 'twould be with yourselves, if, the thraldom rejecting,
And the yoke of a base constitutional throne,
And the men of your choice for your rulers selecting,
You served under masters and lords of your own.
The burdens that they would impose your proud backs on,
y your leave and consent, you would willingly share:
But the liberty wrung from the heretic Saxon,
Being not what you want, is too heavy to bear
Your priests might prohibit free speech of opinion,
But then if they did you'd know what they were at;
And if you were free from Victor IA’s dominion,
Losing all other freedom, you wouldn't mind that.
When we see foreign nations around us rebelling,
Be aisy we can't; but with patriot zeal,
Let us go about howling, and shrieking, and yelling,

be preferable to the one they possess.
THE ANATOMY OF SLAVERY.
AMONG the American news in the Times, the other day, appeared the
following paragraph:—
“A Meeting of the Southern medical students in New York was held on the
evening of the 9th at the Breckenridge head-quarters on the Broadway, opposite
Astor House, to take action as to whether they should go home or remain, since
MR. LINcolN had been elected. The Hon. Mr. CLINton, of Mississippi, DR, SIMEs
of this city, CAPTAIN MoRGAN of Tennessee, CoLonel, ljick of Maryland, and
GENERAL BY NAM of Tennessee, addressed the meeting. The spirit of the assemblage
was decidedly in favour of disunion, and of Southerps leaving the city immediately.
Speeches favouring these views were applauded, whilst those advocating milder
measures were hissed down."
What is there in the prospect of moderate anti-slavery legislation
that can be so peculiarly distasteful to Southern Inedical students?
Of all men in the world medical students ought to know, because
anatomy teaches them, that there is no essential difference between
white men and black men. º instructs them to infer that
niggers are men and women from the knowledge that, there are such
people as Mulattos and Quadroons. Therefore it is impossible
to entertain a certain...supposition, which alone seems adequate
to account for the hostility of medical students to even the most
distant idea of acknowledging the humanity of the coloured race.
Otherwise that feeling on their part might be referred to a con-
sideration, which, if not anatomical, is connected, with anatomy.
If negroes, have no souls, they differ only from , the ape tribe in
affording the anatomist better subjects than monkeys. "Surely the

OUR WONDERFUL CABINETS,
EveRx one has heard—for has not Punch announced the fact? of a
Wonderful Cabinet that is being here exhibited, and which is really
quite a marvel of constructive ingenuity. The maker is a ';
one M. NADolski, and as foreign art is always patronised in England,
his exhibition doubtless will achieve a great success. While, however,
we award him all the praise he merits, which really is not small, for the
credit of our country we ought not to forget that several Wonderful
Cabinets have been constructed of late years, by makers who are purely
British born and bred, and lay no claim to foreign parentage or genius.
Some of these Cabinets, such as those, for instance, which were con-
structed not long since by, LORD's ABERDEEN and DERRY, have been
wonderſul not merely for the oddities that they contained, but for the
rapidity wherewith they came to pieces. Others have been wondrous
for a quality just opposite, for they have held together somehow in
spite of flaws and splits, and all attempts to disunite them; of this sort
is the Cabinet constructed by LORD PALMERston, who perhaps is the
most skilful master of the cabinet-making art. Among his other
strokes of cleverness, his Lordship shows great skill in hitting the right
nail upon the head when it is needful, and this assists him much in
keeping his Cabinet together. Not long ago it was reported that there
had been a split, and that the Foreign Office hinge was not working
very well, and was getting rather rusty; but Lord PALMERSTON in
quick time set all this to rights, and now his Cabinet seems stronger
and more durable than ever.
Perhaps, however, the most wonderful of all the wonders of our
Cabinets is their exceeding elasticity and power of prehension...Any
one who has had experience in packing politicians knows how difficult
it is to make them go together, and º : their angular opinions with
those of their next neighbours. Our Cabinets, however, are so caout-
choucic in construction that the most wonderful of combinations are
sometimes found to be contained in them. Tories, Whigs, and Peelites,
Conservatives and Radicals, are somehow crammed together in our
Wonderful Cabinets, and everybody marvels how they could have been
; into them. , Being so got in, another wonder is that they should
eep together: but their adhesion is accounted for when one thinks
what glue it is that binds them with such marvellous tenacity to office.
Even politicians will stick like wax together, when they find that by so
doing something is left sticking to the lining of their pockets, which is
quite enough to make them disinclined to split.
CREDO, QUIA IMPOSSIBILE EST.
MR. PUNCH observes the following advertisement in the Times:–
HOULD this CATCH the ATTENTION of a CAPITALIST whose
faith in three per cents. subserves the better creed, a Catholic gentleman, a
convert, would be glad to confer with him. Address Credo, &c.
“There is much matter in these convertites,” says Jaques, and we
should like him to have “conferred” with this amusing party. The
“better creed” is most likely a misprint for the “better's creed,” and
the advertiser is, in all probability, a starved-out ...; prophet, who
always sent the right horses for every race, only someho
came in first. He wants to try a new field of spooneyism. “Credo
&c.” must mean, “I believe you, my boy.” We wish the converted
buffer all the luck he deserves.

Mr. SMITH QBRIEN refused to subscribe to the
McMahon, sword. . He considers that the presentation
thereof as “intended to be an intimation that McMahon
would be welcome” in Ireland “at the head of a French
army.” He does not relish the idea of King McMahon.
For, , he demands in a letter which has just been pub-
lished by the Irish American—
“What is McMahon? It is true he belongs to an ancient Irish
family-is in fact a scion of the race to which I myself belong—but
he has neither done nor suffered in the cause of Ireland. e is
simply the agent of a military despot, and he dares not even accept
the sword which you offer him without the permission of that
*º Yet the Irish people are encouraged to look upon McMahon
as the future King of Ireland.”
Are Irishmen really the warm-hearted people, they have
so long, had the credit of being?...Is gratitude a senti-
ment which glows in the hearts of Irish patriots with any
º degree of ardour? Here is MR. SMITH O'BRIEN,
who has both done and suffered in the cause of Ireland.
He has done what he will not be such a fool as to do
again; and he has suffered less than he deserved, and
more than he will venture to deserve a second time. Yet
here are all the traitors of Irelandforgetting SMITHO'BRIEN
and running after McMahon. Not one of all those
rascals has proposed to give SMITH O'BRIEN a sword, or
even a knife to cut cabbages with. On the contrary,
adding impudence to ingratitude and insult to neglect,
they invite him to subscribe to a sword for McMahon,
- for a mere, scion of that race to which somebody else
º, Is McMahon the representative of the ancient
Irish Royal Family that the Irish people are encouraged
to look upon him as the future King of Ireland? If the
Irish people really looked at McMahon in that character,
they would be open to the charge of base ingratitude.
They will not have that pretender to reign over them.
The sovereign of their choice will be SMITH O'BRIEN,
in case, they should ever have the opportunity of electing
him, which would be afforded by a default of succession
to the Crown of the United Kingdom occurring in MR.
Q'BRIEN's lifetime. In the meantime, O'BRIEN will, no
doubt, be guided by the remark rather than the example
of Macbeth, considering that if chance will have him King,
why chance will crown him without his stir, and there-
fore he won't stir, but bide his time like a caterpillar
under the shade of his greens.

THE APPETITE OF LONDON. A TRIP TO KISSINGEN.
HERE is an appalling fact for Wegetarians to ponder over. We take | . In the Newbu t Herald, which is an American paper, and where
it from the Times reporter on the Cattle-show:—
“Tho_enormous appetite of London is fed every year by about 270,000 oxen,
besides 80,000 calves, 1,500,000 sheep, and 30,000 swine. Of the dozen different
breeds and sorts of beasts, fully one-third are shorthorns, one-sixth are of cross-
breeds; next in number come the foreign supplies; then the Herefords, then Irish
breeds, then Irish crosses, then the Devons; while polled Scots, Highlanders,
Welsh runts and longhorns make up the remainder.”
When to this account are added all the venison, hares, and rabbits,
grouse, partridges, and pheasants, ducks, chickens, geese, and turkeys,
which annually go down the “red lane” of the metropolis, it must be
certainly acknowledged that however much the votaries of Vegeta-
rianism may have increased, there still survives a portion of the
London population at present unpersuaded to live upon green meat,
It says something, we think, for the health of the metropolis, that
such a prodigious quantity of good, substantial food, is every year
consumed in it. A good appetite is generally a sign of good condition.
and a city that can }. away three hundred thousand oxen and a
million-and-a-half of sheep, must have a pretty healthy digestive appa-
ratus. We have sometimes heard it said, that it is easier for some
men to, find appetites. than dinners. . If so, they could not well do
better than come and live in London; for, to judge by the above quoted
account of its consumption, at no place in the kingdom can good food
be more plentiful. But, be this sº or not, a person must indeed be
born of a “cross-breed” who would not at Christmas-time be put in
a good humour by the picture of good living this paragraph presents.

Newburyport is, the reader of course knows too well for us to tell

the nearest Government clerk of his acquaintance, or else to send a
letter on the subject to LoRD MALMEsbury, who will be sure to send
him an answer, “with his compliments,” by return of post; well, as
we began by stating, it was in the Newburyport Herald (please exchange)
that we read the following fact, which has an agreeable smack of
romance about it:—
“One time when HENRY CLAY came to New York, he kissed a mile and a half of
women.”
We thought that the proverb assured us that “every miss was as
good as a mile,” but in New York (happy city, where travelling is
carried,on by busses!) it would seem that the Misses ran to the extent
of a mile-and-a-half—and every Miss, too, was as good as a mile. The
New World seems to go further in everything than the Old World-
even in i.; By the bye, with all due respect, the proper locality
for the above little incident should have been the Mississippi.

“”Tis strange that attorneys can’t find their way here;”
Quoth TAPE, “Sir, it certainly is very queer,
That such talent unnoticed should be—should be,

One day there came a rap at the door;
And a strange little rap was there;
It wasn’t the postman, who comes Rap! Rap!
Nor a dun who calls with a different tap,

CLERKETAPE rose up, and he open'd the door;
SIR BRIEFLEsse he chanced to be out;
For a summons within him, unknown by few,
Used to solemnly warn him each day at two,
To go for his oysters and stout—and stout,

CIERKETAPE had a paper thrust into his hand;
'Twas a scroll right fair to see;
Qutside, a few words endorsed had been, L., .
“Exchequer—re JENKINs—Instructions within, -
SIR BRIEFLEsse—five guas,” which I’m told means the tin,

SIR BRIEFLEsse returned to his legal retreat,
And seated himself on his chair;
When in walk’d CLERKETAPE with his usual grace,

And thus spoke with a nonchalant air—air, air,
And thus spoke with a nonchalant air.
“A Clerk, Sir, has called with these papers to-day,
To which your attention’s desired.
I told him I thought you might find a spare minute
To examine the case and the points that are in it,
If dispatch were not greatly required—required,
If dispatch were not greatly required.”
Uprose SIR BRIEFLEsse and eyed CLERKETAPE,
And his colour it went and came.
...And is it a Brief, at last?” he cried,
..Qr is it a phantom my fate to deride,
Which appears when all is departed beside
In hope’s still flickering flame—hope's flame,
In hope's still flickering flame.”
Then he clutch'd at the brief, and he look’d at the fee,
And he cried, “By Jove! It’s a topper!”
And something he said, as he gave it a swing;
It should have been “Dash it !” which means the same thing,
And which isn't thought quite so improper—improper,
And which isn't thought quite so improper.
Then he toss'd the brief up high in the air,
And he bang'd his books on the floor,
And seizing the poker with all his might,
He poked till the heat of the fire was white,
And TAPE soon thought he was crack'd outright,
And began to retreat to the door—the door,
And began to retreat to the door.
“For this,” cried BRIEFLEsse, “each morn and eve
Have I prayed on bended knees;
And now it has come! and I see my way,
I shall be Chief Justice, I know, some day.”
Quoth TAPE, “Sir, I only hope you *}
Preside at the Common Pleas—the Pleas,

But many a day glided slowly away,
As he paced the road of fame.
Perhaps on a hoarded store of fees,
QLERKETAPE and SIR BRIEFLEsse are living at ease,
For upon the bench of the Common Pleas
I haven't yet seen his name—his name,
I haven't yet seen his name.

HARSH TREATMENT OF A HEBREW,
WHAT funny things one finds in the papers. Did Mr. Punch's
readers see this police report in the Daily Telegraph *—
“MANSION HOUSE.
“A cunning-looking middle-aged Jew, named ABRAHAM Moses, was yesterday
brought before the Lord MAYor, charged with an attempt to defraud HENRY HARRIs.
“The complainant, a very young man, but who appeared in the sequel to have
been much more than a match for the Jew, stated that on Sunday evening he was
in Bishopsgate Street, when MR. Mosks accosted him, and wanted to sell him what
he described to be a real Australian gold ring and a silver chain for a sovereign.
The complainant, being in the service of a pawnbroker, he at once discovered the
articles to be almost worthless, and he gave the prisoner into custody. He now
stated, in addition to his former evidence, that since the prisoner had been
remanded he had tested the articles in question, and had ascertained that the ring
was made of copper, slightly washed with gold, and the chain was also of copper
washed with nitric acid and quicksilver.”
But why does such a thing appear, among the police, reports? It
ought to have come in among the “Facetide,” or should have been
headed “A Hint for the Pantomimes.” So thought the amusing
MR. Moses; for when—
“The Lord MAYor asked the prisoner, whether he wished to make any answer to
the charge?—
“He replied that all he had got to say was, that he was a dealer in the articles,
and that what he had tried to do was done every day in Petticoat Lane and Hounds-
ditch, where the Jews every day sold brass articles for gold.
“The Lord MAYon told the prisoner he should commit him for trial.
“The F. : wanted to know what he was to be committed for?
lian gold RD MAYok said for falsely pretending that the ring was made of Austra-
gold.
“The prisoner said that all he told the young man was, that the ring came from
Australia, and this was the truth; it did come from Australia—a very long way
from it—it came from Houndsditch. (A laugh.)”
Laugh—of course. A mere bit of Mosaic-Arab fun; and Mr. Punch
protests against the dulness of a Magistrate who could take such a
thing au serieur. Why, according to the Times report, this unfortunate
farceur added, that “if all the Jews who did such things were to be
taken up, the gaols would be full of them.” This may or may not be,
MR. Moses may be more competent to say than Mr. Punch, but never
will the latter willingly see a bit of ſun treated harshly, and he begs to
remonstrate with the LoRD MAYOR, who seems to have no perception
of humour, and who actually sent MR. Moses ſor trial. Christmas

SOUTHWARK, PUNCH LOOKS TO-WARDS YOU!
THAT Mr. Punch can eject or inject anybody, for anywhere is a
truth too universally acknowledged to need iteration. It is the con-
sciousness of his gigantic strength that prevents his interfering, save
rarely, in the quarrels of the lower creation. But he regarded it as a
matter of importance that Southwark should be liſted out of the mud
of local interests, and should be assisted to elect a Member of European
and Asiatic name and fame, . Therefore, unlike Hercules in the case
of the Carter, he descended from Olympus, and gave the Nineveh Car
an immeasurable shove, which sent it rolling over the necks of all the
rostrate jobbers, bribers, publicans, Bumbles, and boobies of the
H. and drove it, with Austen LAYARD in it, right up to the
door of the New Palace of Westminster. Mr. Punch has triumphantly
returned MR. LAYARD, just as Mr. Punch indignantly hurled MR. Cox
of Finsbury into the abyss of i. MR, LAYARD will therefore
take Mr. Punch as his guide, philosopher, and friend, and (which is
tautology) pursue the brilliant career before the Honourable Member.
In the next place, Mr. Punch hereby shakes hands with every one of
MR. LAYARD's voters, kisses (paternally) the feminine portion of that
voter's family, and pats his washed children on the head. He pro;
mised to patronise Southwark in the event of its doing its duty; and
although all election promises are not invariably kept, Mr. Punch
never broke his word. As soon as the weather is at all decent, he
will make a triumphal entrance into the borough. Meantime, he
drinks the health of Southwark and its new Member.
The Battle of the T's.
THERE has been a great struggle between single t and double ditto

Britt. Regina f. The Doctors have at last decided that Brit. is short
for Britanniae, meaning England alone; while Britt. is the classical
abbreviation for Britanniarum, which includes England and Ireland
also. So MR. GLADston E is right to a t, after all.

COSTERMONGERS AND CHERUBS.
THE Costermongers of the City of London met a few days since to
get up a petition to the Aldermen for the discontinuance of the Police
persecution to which they have lately been subjected. These are times
of progress, and obstructives ought to be forced to move on; but when
; tell the Costermonger to get on with his barrow, you invite him to
ring his business to a stand-still. Popular preachers and performers
cause obstructions in the streets, consisting of lines of carriages, which
are more in the public way than vegetable carts and apple-stalls. It
does not lie in the mouths of the Corporation, blocking up the
thoroughfares annually with their Lord Mayor's Show, to bid, the
Policeman say “Move on,” to the Costermonger. Live and let live;
live on buck's haunch and green fat, and let live on ’taturs.
A street nuisance, for which the Costermonger's barrow would be an
acceptable exchange anywhere, is the perambulator. That and Grino-
line are the Scylla and Charybdis of the streets. You avoid the hoops
of the fashionable, or unfashionable, female to get your foot crushed
under the wheels of a machine with a heavy baby in it, propelled
by a blundering nursemaid. And what remedy have you under these
painful circumstances? None, except you are a savage old fogy and
can read with delight the letter lately written by an eminent physician
in the Morning Post, wherein he disinterestedly protests against the
practice of taking children down from a hot nursery and wheeling them
about the streets in the most inclement weather, the result being their
seizure with “dyspnoea, hooping-cough, mumps, bronchitis, aphthº, or
whatever name you may please to which, in the great majority of
cases, soon terminate in death.” All these effects of the employment of
perambulators, except just the fatal termination of the diseases thence
resulting, must be advantageous to doctors; and therefore it, is very
liberal of a physician to publish them. . The Policemen who order Cos-
termongers to move on with their stock in trade would be much better
º: and would confer a real blessing on unthinking mothers, as
well as on the pedestrian public, in obliging nursemaids with their
pestilent perambulators to move off. If F. make idols of their
children, they ought not to expect that other people will worship them
by submitting to have their toes, smashed beneath the cars in which
stupid servant-girls drag about these little Juggernauts.
Anglo-Mania.
THE latest Nouveauté de Paris is a strong reaction in favour of the
English. In proof of this, a rich London November Fog went over
there a week or two ago, and the whole town, with the exception of a
single house, illuminated in its honour during the whole time of its stay!
As a further testimony of respect, we may also mention, that business
was* entirely suspended so long as the fog remained in the lively
capital.
DRAW THE CORK, SCOTLAND !
Now that, thanks to Punch, the Spiritualists have found their occu-
tion gone in London, we almost wonder that they do not try their
uck across the Border, and see what business (and believers) they
could do in Edinburgh, or any other place where the Thistle is the
crest. It may be that the Scotch are too far North and canny to be
taken in and done as many Southerns have been lately by spiritual
conjuring and clairvoyant second-sight. We, indeed, can scarcely
picture a party of cool, cautious, calculating Scotchmen, sittin
gravely round a table and expecting it to move. Such a process .#
at best be deemed a waste of time, with the risk, nay, utter certainty,
of being made a fool of, from both of which results the mind of a
shrewd Scotchman instinctively would shrink. Yet, that Spirit influ-
ence is largely felt in Scotland, this extract from a Parliamentary
return will surely show:—
“While England, with its 20,000,000 of people, consumed 17,000,000 gallons of
spirits last year, Scotland, with its 3,000,000 of population, took 5,600,000; and
Ireland, with perhaps only its 6,000,000 of inhabitants, very nearly that precise
nuumber of gallons; so that in England we do not take quite a gallon of spirits
a year apiece, but Scotland drinks the deficiency for us, so as to bring the consump-
tion of the United Kingdom up to about that rate.”
Clearly, no one who reads this will doubt that there are lots of
people now in Scotland who are once a week, at least, under the influ-
ence of spirits. Instances of second-sight, or of persons who see
double, are by no means rare in London on occasions, such for instance,
as a Southwark Election; but they must certainly occur much more
frequently in Scotland, where the spirits yearly called from the vasty
deep of whiskey-cellars, are at a double rate per throttle to what they
are with us. e may add, to show our learning, that DR. DEE and
other ancients raised spirits by the aid of what they called a Magic
Crystal, whereas, in our more modern time, no magic is required, and
a common piece of glass suffices amply for the purpose. Merely with
the aid of an ordinary wine-glass, any Scotchman can raise spirits as
high up as his lips, which everybody knows is a sufficient elevation for
anyone whose aim is simply to get elevated.

CHAPTER XLI.—BIDS ADIEU TO HENRY THE SEVENTH
AND AU REVOIR TO HENRY THE EIGHTEI.
He first of these two º:
3) was peaceful, we are told, be:
cause he was penurious; and
the other was less famous for
fighting than for flirting. It
is therefore not surprising that,
however much the civil cos-
tume may have changed, we
find in neither of their reigns
much novelty to notice in the
military equipment. As the
royal fingers failed to give the
necessary fillip to it, the ar-
mourers no doubt found their
trade grow somewhat slack;
and so long as their old stock
remained upon their hands, it
is not very likely that they
troubled their heads much to
think of new improvements.
It seems childish to inquire
whether it was because the
knights were fond of playing
the flute, that their armour in
these days was generally fluted.
But inquiries as ridiculous
have ere now formed the sub-
ject of the learnedest discus-
sion, and the point which we
have mooted may for aught we
know be used as a sort of
mental pickaxe to bring to
light long-buried and most in-
teresting facts. Whatever
were its cause, however, flut-
ing became generally adopted at this period, and all parts of the
armour were more or less thus decorated. That the beauty of the
ornament º not be obscured, the tabard, or emblazoned surcoat,
was discarded; the arms or badges which it bore being in some cases
engraved upon the armour. An instance of this is shown in the suit
which was presented by the EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN to KING HENRY
THE EIGHTH, by way of souvenir upon his marriage with KATHARINE
of ARRAGoN,” whose badges are engraved with those of her bad
husband, their initials being united by a true lover's knot. Such of
our young readers as in their Christmas holidays may have their minds
improved by being taken to the Tower, should beg the beefeater to
ause in his rapid act of showmanship, and give them time to get their
reath before this interesting suit. It has the credit of being the best
specimen existing of the period now under notice, and must especially
command the admiration of the ladies when they remember the occasion
for which it was expressly made. Besides the badges and initials, it is
tastily adorned with engravings which are chosen from the Lives of the
Saints; an ornament as fitting to our virtuous KING BLUEBEARD, as
is the decoration of the true ſover's knots.
The enormous elbowpieces which were worn in the last reign were
pretty nearly out of . in the time of HENRY THE SEVENTH, and
the sword which had been slung in front for a brief period, was now
restored to its usual place as a side-arm. To guard the neck from
lance-pokes, plates which were called passe-gardes were appended to
the shoulders, rising perpendicularly on each side of the ". and
giving wearers somewhat the appearance of the Quakers, who used to
show that they belonged to a stiff-necked generation by the way in
which their coat-collars were cut so as to stand up. For further shield,
the helmet was frequently provided with flexible and overlapping plates
or ribs of steel, which j upon the neck; so that the blow that is in
schoolboy parlance called a “rabbiter,” could have hardly caused
much hurt if given only with the fist. The helmets for the most part
took the shape of the head, and had sometimes a serrated ridge upon
the summit, looking not unlike the coxcomb worn by many of our
Clowns. Somewhat in the fashion of the hats of the civilians, they
were adorned with an extremely long and flowing plume of feathers,
inserted in a pipe just where a pigtail would have sprouted, and streaming
down the back sometimes below the waist. It is stated by authorities
whose truth we dare not question, that these helmets were called bur-
gonets, because they came from Burgundy. an assertion which seems
scarcely more supported by the words, than if we said that trousers
were commonly so called because they came from Troy.
As presenting a good picture
of the armour of this period,
we may direct the nation's no-
tice to the brass of “Richard
GYLL, late Sergeant of the
Bakehouse,” wyth KYNG
HENRY THE vº. and also
wyth KYNg HENRYTHEVIII.”
This old worthy died in the
year 1511, the second of the
reign of his latter king and
master, and his brass is still
preserved in the church of
Shottesbrooke, Hampshire,
which it may be he enriched
with some few handfuls of his N.
tin. From this figure it will
be seen that the sollerets, or
steel shoes, were worn no
longer with long toes, but
had them broad and rounded
instead of coming to a point.
The passe-gardes we have
mentioned are also clearly
visible, and notice should be
taken of the horizontal plates,
called taces, extending from
the breastplate to protect the
hips. As we have seen in the
last reign, two small pointed
lates, called tuilles, are affixed
§ straps in front to the lowest
of the taces, so as to give a BurgoNET.

there is visible a short tunic of
mail, which, we thus learn, still continued in mili use. In this
respect, however, SFRJEANT GYLL was certainly old-fashioned in his
dress; for instead of tuilles and taces, skirts of steel, which were called
lamboys, were coming into vogue as being more convenient. These
lamboys (a name doubtless corrupted, from lambeaur), were narrow
plates of steel which hung in fluted ſolds, covering, the body from the
waist to the knee, and looking at a distance not unlike a highland kilt.

with merely noticing the fact, that the arquebus was introduced about

that this appliance was suggested by the cross-bow. may be reasonably
inferred from the name of arc-a-bouche, which the Britannic tongue, of
course, soon corrupted into arquebus. It seems, the military autho-
rities were not much quicker then than now in adopting, innovations, |
for we find that though the arquebus and other firearms had come in,
the ancient bow and arrows had not yet gone out. , When that formid-
able body, the Yeomen of the Guard, were established in the year
1485, they were armed half with the bow and the others with the
arquebus;, just as until Punch brought his cudgel, into play, part of
our army had the rifle, while the others were left harmless by being
armed with old Brown Bess. The parallel, however, is not quite cor-
rectly drawn, for the first fire-arms were scarcely an improvement on
the bow; indeed, what with their clumsiness and aptitude to kick, we
may doubt if they were much in favour with the troops. Bows, how-
ever, had been brought to a very perfect state, as even the best shots
among our riflemen must own, when they read of hitting bullseyes at
three hundred yards range, and splitting rival arrows

DANCING CHRISTIANS.
HERE are people to
whose, mouths, the
Early Closing Move-
ment had need to be
applied, to prevent
their doing damage
to the doctrines they
whole-hoggishly en-
deavour to support.
Such a person is a
recent correspondent
to the Record, who,
in giving his opinion
upon “Social Amuse-
ments,” denounces
dancing as a devilish
and irreligious prac-
tice :-
“I fear that many aso-
called Christian will set
me down for an ascetic,
because I condemn in toto this fascinating but ensnaring amusement. . . . What-
ever may be said of dancing, abstractedly, as an innocent and healthful recreation,
it is a well-known fact that praying dancers have never yet made their appearance
in this world; the species is altogether unknown. An earnest humble spiritually
ininded dancing Christian is a phenomenon not yet brought to light. Apologise
for the practice as we will, all evidence tells us that Satan has never yet devised a
better instrument than dancing for filling the heart and mind with every principle
opposed to the religion of the Bible.”
There is a smack of strained facetiousness in the idea of “ º:
dancers,” which makes us doubt whether the writer intended to be
serious in the rest of his remarks. Indeed, the levity with which such
persons often treat the most solemn of subjects would sadly shock a
sinner, though it might not offend a “saint.” That there are dancing
dervishes everybody knows—except the gentleman who states that
they “have not yet made their appearance; ” and that there are
Christians who are capable of dancing and likewise of being devout,
each at the right season, nobody, save fools or fanatics, can doubt.
As to calling dancing an invention of the devil, and saying that “all
evidence” protes it is opposed to the religion of the Bible, we know
that general assertions are generally fallacious, and “all evidence,” if
siſted, might turn out none at all. That dancing may do harm, under
some conditions, we are ready to admit. For instance, at Casinos it
becomes a recreation neither innocent nor healthful: and the sooner
such ensnaring places are abolished, the better will it be for the morals
of our sons. But to confound such dens of vice with virtuous English
drawing-rooms is to slander the fair name of every lady in the land.
The mind that can see evil in the exercise of dancing as practised in
society at the present day, must be morbidly alive to the terrors of the
evil one, and dead to the enjoyment of any healthy pleasure. We
know that there are men who are so weak in will that they dare not
drink, one drop of, wine, lest they be tempted to get drunk; and simi-
larly imbecile are they who dare not enter the most innocent enjoyment
for fear it should excite them to plunge headlong into vice. They see
peril and temptation where purer eyes see none; and as they pass
their lives in looking out for sin, for their credit's sake they feel they
ought to find it omnipresent. e, who hold a healthier faith, main-

An Explanation Quite as Good as any other.
MR. BERNAL Osborn E, who for some time held a good appointment
in the Admiralty, has been kind enough to send us the following:—
Why are there so many deserters in the British Navy’.
The reason is plain-no man gets his proper desert in it, and so he
goes elsewhere to seek it.
Bravo, BERNAL! We shall be happy to hear from you again.
Free Soil all Over.
In the United States the North and South seem to be resolving
themselves, on the Slavery question, into absolutely opposite poles.
Could not they compromise the matter in dispute by a mutual arrange-
ment in which both sides would engage to concede something to the
demands of Liberty? Suppose the South consented to :* Negro
Emancipation, whilst the North agreed to adopt Free Trade
A DEPLORABLE MISTAKE.
It is no end of pities that MR. BECKETT DENIson's name is
EDMUND. Why wasn't it WILLIAM? His friends would have been sure
to have called him, if it was only for the abstract of the thing–Will.

g- S
IR, a My hair stood on end eight days, ago (and has ever since
obstinately refused to lie down) as Iread in last week's Spectator, in
a review of a New History of EdwańD THE FIRST, the following
passage, for which I can only find the epithet “Outrageous:’—
* In a credulous fictions will grow up; but in an incredulous age why should
they be repeated? We would ruthlessly extirpate all “graceful fancies' and “beau-
tiful legends' from history, making them over to the poets, to whom they properly
belong. When they are admitted as facts into the historian's page, they sometimes
falsify and pervert reality to a degree that justifies any amount of indignation.
Among these picturesque lies, we believe, are now included the story of Rosamond and
her Bower; the story of ELEANort's heroism in drawing the poison, from Edward's
wound; the tale of QurkN PHILIPPA and the Citizens of ; the murder of the

the fact, that if there be incidents in history, which come home to

the impudence here to describe as “picturesque, lies?” . Is he not

SOUTHERN CHIVALRY.
UDACIous JoHN J. PETTUs, the
Governor of slave-holding and
repudiating Mississippi, in his
essage to the State Legis-
lature, makes the following
proposal, among other sugges-
tions for organising rebellion.
“I recommend that a coat of
arms be adopted for the State of
Mississippi."
There’s chivalry, for you.
The like of it has been seen
since the Crusades, but not
since the extinction of , the
British chivalrous Ministry
that opposed Free Trade.
Freedom was the enemy with
whom the Derbyite chevaliers
contended. The foe of the
Mississippi chevaliers is also
Freedom. Our native knight-
hood struggled against cem-
mercial liberty. Their brethren
of the American order are con:
tending against the liberty of
man. Such sons of chivalry
ought, # all means, to have
a coat of arms; as the Com-
mandant of the Mississi pi
branchor chapter of the order
rightly suggests. A slave-
owner rampant azure, on a
field argent, between a nigger
sable, fettered, at work, and an Abolitionist prºper preaching on A
stump of the same. Crest: a cowhide, gules. blazonry would,
perhaps, meet the necessities of the case, and answer the requirements
of Transatlantic heraldry. The motto of the Mississippi shield might
be Fiat Injustitia, ruqt Calum. > -
The conclusion of knight-errant SIR John J. PETTUs's address is a
fine specimen of the knightly faith and devotion characteristic of his
peculiar order of knighthood:-
“Can we hesitate, when one bold resolve, bravely executed, makes pºwerless the
aggressor, and one united effort makes safe our homes? May the God of our fathers
put it into the hearts of the people to make it."
The Crusaders invoked St. MARY when they charged the Saracen or
rushed to the slaughter of any other fellow-men. Bolder in blas-
pheming is the champion of slavery.
PUNCH AND PLAUTUS AT WESTMINSTER PLAY.
WHEN Mr. Punch, a year ago, complained of having to pass
Christmas without going to Westminster Play, he felt, sure that the
authorities would pay due heed to his complaint; and he begs now to
remind “Old Westminsters” in general that it is to him their thanks
are mainly due, for reviving an old custom which was threatened with
disuse. “All work and no Play” was about to be adopted as the
maxim of the School, when, happily, the just wrath of Mr. Punch was
aroused, and by a º of warning he saved many afuture JACK
from becoming a dull § through the fate that seemed, impending.
Mr. Punch, who is all modesty, would not have hinted at this fact, but
that there are people who are painfully unconscious of it, and who,
when “See, the Conquering Hero comes,” was played the other
evening upon Mr. Punch's entrance (arm-in-arm with his good friend
the Head-master of the School), were not aware that it was to the
former learned fº that the compliment was paid, for his bravery
in conquering the giants Whim and Prejudice, who had succeeded, for
a time, in prohibiting the Play.
Čould off fºurts have obtained leave of absence from the Shades,
and º his opera-glass to Westminster, for a look at his Tri-
nummus, he would somewhat have been puzzled to recognise his
offspring, so much was it improved and so decent was its dress.
Justus insius, the reader knows, called PLAUTUs the Tenth Muse;
but it is not every one would echo JUSTU's LIPSIUs, who might rather
be called SLIPSIUs, for having made so great a slip. Were PLAUTUs
to write now, his jokes would not be listened to in any decent society,
and their point would scarcely even be thought sharp enough to do for
a burlesque. The wit of the old º; is a great deal more
remarkable for breadth than for its depth; and, in spite of their good
scholarship, it would puzzle the º: Westminsters to translate his
plays entire, if their mothers or their sisters asked them so to do. It
must, however, be remembered that, in the classic age, the world was
not yet blest with the presence of its Punch, and had therefore not
yet learned the lesson he has taught—that it is possible to be most
exquisitely funny without offending either good morals or good taste.
“”Tis sixty years since” (to quote the tit :*: of Waverley) a play
of PLAUTUs has been played before a British audience; and, clearly,
the revival must not º: unnoticed in the columns of so classical a
journal as is Punch. , But space is here so precious, that an inch or
two is all which can be spared to tell the universe that, thanks to a
judicious use of the pruning-knife, the Trinummus has been fitted for
the modern stage, and acted with such success, that Punch really half
expected to hear the cry of “Author l’” raised at the conclusion, and
to see the ghost of PLAUTUS bowing his acknowledgment from a
private box. The old man eloquent, Charmides, the comic servant,
Stasimus, the good young man, Lysiteles, and the Charles Surface
Lesbonicus, carried on their conversation with such extreme vivacity,
that one could hardly believe one's ears were hearing a dead 6;
while many a “heavy father” of the trans-Thamesian stage might have
fitly learned a lesson from the Messieurs Megaronides—a character so
ponderous that it took two actors to sustain the part.
Nor can Punch pass the º: without a word or two of praise.
Especially he, owns, he was tickled with the passage describing the
position of Westminster School, and the privilege of its scholars to
attend the House of Commons during a debate:—
“Thamesis hic refluit vitreis argenteus undis,
Et placido lintres fertgue refertque sinu:
ue ubi vicinas praetexens Curia ripas
ertici multiplici tollit ad astra caput,
Audit quanta fori facundia, quanta Senatſis,
Discit et eloquii fingere verba puer."
The notion of its nearness to the “glassy waters” of the “silver
Thames” being cited as a reason for not rusticating the School, struck
Mr. Punch as being most deliciously facetious; and when he pictured
the young Westminsters learning ºl. by listening to such
. as the Wiscount, Mr. Punch broke out at once in such a
choking fit of laughter, that all the ladies in the stalls had to pat him
on the back, before he could succeed in recovering his breath.

in the first year of his reign, which, our readers may remember, was the
nineteenth of his age:–
HEM-y The Eighth.
whol-EBINE.
From A RARE PORTRAIT BY
in The Punch COLLECTION.
“Hys Majesty dyd wear shorte garments reaching but little beneath y' pointes,
of blew velvet and crymosyne, with long sleeves, all cut and lyned with cloth of
gold, and ye utter (i.e. outer) parts of y" garments powdered with castles and sheafes
of arrowes (the badges of his Queen, CatheRINE) of fyne dokett (ducat) golde; the
upper part of the hosen of like sewte and facion;, the nether parts of scarlet, º.
dered with tymbrelles of fine golde. On hys head was a bonnet of damaske silvre,
flatte woven in yº stoll, and thereupon wrought with golde and ryche feathers in it."
The sovereign clearly thought no small change of himself when he
carried on his person such a lot of gold, and silver. But it was not
merely by the richness of his dress that the young monarch displayed
his love of being in the fashion. The “shorte, garments of blew
velvet” were a recent innovation, probably from Paris, at least, if we
may trust to the authority of SHAKSPEARE, who makes Sir, Thomas
Lowell quote a proclamation, bidding all the travelled gallants of the
Court, that they must—
“leave these remnants
Of fool and feather, that they got in France, * * *
(Out of a foreign wisdom) renouncing clean,
The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,
Short blistered breeches, and those types of travel."
These breeches extended to the middle of the thigh, and were
slashed and stuffed and puffed so as to give a rather swollen appear;
ance to the hips. They were made of velvet, silk, and satin, coloured
and embroidered cloths, or gold and silver stuffs, and were attached by
points or laces to the doublet, just as small boys used to have their
trousers buttoned to their jackets, when they wore those frightful
“roley-poley” suits. Properly, these breeches were called a “pair of
hose;” a name which must not be confounded with the long close-
fitting stockings which covered the remainder of the leg down to the
feet. The writers of the time not being so in fear of critics as they
might be now, applied the term of “hose” to either of these garments,
and have thereby greatly puzzled the wise heads of many antiquaries.
We must, however, caution people against fancying that the stockings
jerkin were
which were worn beneath the hose were a whit like what we buy as
hose, or stockings, now-a-days. In an inventory of the Royal wardrobe
(kings were much more careful then than even commoners are now, we
think, for we know no one who would dream of keeping a Best Clothes
list), we find an entry of “A yarde and a quarter of grene velvet for
stocks to a payr of hose for y” king's grace,” and another of the same
quantity of “purpul satin to covery" stocks of a payr of hose of purpul
cloth of gold tissue for the kynge.”
The first use of the word “waistcoat” occurs in an inventory towards
the close of this reign, and the garment whicn it designated was made
apparently to supersede the stomacher and placard, which had been
previously worn as a protection to the chest. The waistcoat, like an
ostler's, had a pair of sleeves, but, unlike an ostler's, was made of rich
materials, such as “cloth of silver, quilted with black silk, and tuffed
out with fine camerike,” as cambric was then called. It was worn
under the doublet, but was visible, no doubt, through the slitterings
and slashings wherewith all the upper garments were disfigured at this
period. Illustrating this queer fashion, CAMDEN, in his Remaines, tells
a “merrie jeste” anent a shoemaker of Norwich, who was named John
DRAKES, and deserved, as we shall see, to have been called a goose!
Of this worthy we are told that—
“Coming to a tailor's and finding some French tawney clothe which had there
been sent to be made into a gowne for one Sir PHILIP CALTHoRP, he dyd take a
fancy to y' colour, and dyd ordere yº taylour to buy as much of ye same stuff and
make a gowne for him precisely of F. fashion of y'knight's. SIR PHILIP, coming to
be measured, dyd spy this piece of clothe and dyd ask yº snip who was ye knave
that ordered it. “John DRAkks, replied ye tailor, “and hee will have it made y-
belsame facion as your own.” “Well, well," growled y- knight, “so in good time be
it. I will have mine as full of cuts as thy shears can make it.” Both garments
being finished according to y' order, yº shoemakere on seeing his was slashed almost
to shreds dyd begin to swere most lustilee, but said to him y taylor, “I have done but
what you bade une, for as SIR Philip's gowne is even soe have I made yours.” “B
my latchet !' groaned yº cobblere, ‘I will stick to my old clothes, then, and wi
never seek to dress as a gentleman again.'”
The gown which is here mentioned was worn over the doublet, and
was a short garment with sleeves, stuffed and puffed so as to give a
great breadth to the shoul-
ders. These sleeves were
made detached, and were
fastened on by means of
points or buttons, the latter
often being of the finest
gold, begemmed with'pearls
and precious stones. The
words jacket, coat, and
i indifferently
applied by way of synonym
for gown; and we find in
the king's inventories men-
tion made of several descrip-
tions of coats, such as long
coats" and short coats,
demi-coats and tunic coats,
riding coats and walkin
coats, leather coats an
coats with skirts, which
show the gown or coat was
capable of change in cut:
Judging from his clothes’
lists, King Bluebeard must
have been as fond of chang-
ing coats as he was of
changing wives, and we
can fancy how he used to call upon his tailor, and order “some more
coats,” in the manner of the exquisite who, to pass an idle hour, used
to dawdle about town, and order “some more gigs.”
To finish our description, we may add that shirts were worn by those
who could afford them, a qualification which an Act of Parliament
gefined to be the having of an income of a hundred marks a year.
They (we mean, the shirts) were embroidered very frequently with
either silk, or gold or silver, and were made plain or plaited, which was
then called “pinched.”. Cloaks and mantles are described by HALL of
wondrous great magnificence, the former being sometimes slung
baldrick-wise across the chest, so as not to hide the gorgeous under-
garments. Slashed shoes of velvet, with very broad round toes, makin
their wearers look as though they had the gout, are the form of ped
envelope peculiar to this period; and—to jump from toe to top-the
broad slouched hat of HENRY THE SEVENTH, with its gigantic pea-
cock's-tail-like spreading plume of feathers, gave place in this reign to
a small flat cap or bonnet, which looked like a smashed gibus, and was
adorned with a single ostrich feather at the side. We may add, too,
costume or reie Nobility. Temp. Hi-NRY
The Eighth.
* This title HENRY i. on coming to the throne, being then, says Snooke, “in
yº flowere of hys youth, and not having shewed hys thorne by sticking it intoe
people in yº shape of taxes.” The words were out of compliment stamped upon his
coin: just as “Puxgh PRotector" should have been on the new penny.
* It seems from this that long coats were not solely the distinction of the clergy,
as §: be inferred from the Earl of Surrey's speech to Cardinal Wolsey, which
doubtless every play-goer must quite well recollect:-
“By my soul,
Your long coat, priest, protects you: thou should'st feel
My sword i' the life-blood of thee else 1"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CRIARIVARI.
that while the face was either shaved or not, according to the pleasure
or the nature of its owner, the hair upon the head as compulsorily
cropped; for King Bluebeard (who Fº was blessed with a short
crop) issued the most peremptory orders to his Court, that the long
hair which had been in fashion in his father's time should be worn no
longer. How the Absaloms of the E. relished this new edict,
history omits to state; but we think they must have gone as regretful
to the polling-place as an elector who is voting to oblige his Tory land-
lord, and has therefore to decline a liberal offer for his vote.
tar With this Chapter MR. PUNCH closes, for the present, his History of Costume. This
he is impelled to do purely by the fear lºst he should overwhelm his readers with the
mass of erudition he has weekly been imparting to them. MR. Punch, however, hopes
ere many volumes pass, to give a second course of lectures on the subject : to which
completing series, all the pupils he has had, will be privileged to subscribe, as will any
body elee who is competent to pay for it.
CHARACTER OF THE BRITISH ARMY.
A LEADING article in the Morning Post contains the alarming
statement subjoined:–
“It is no doubt more difficult to maintain discipline in the British than in the
Continental armies, for this among other reasons—that for the most part the man
who enlists in the British army is in general, as the Duke or WELLINGtoN said, ‘the
most drunken and probably the worst man of the trade or profession to which he
belongs, or of the village or town in which he ilves.'”
If this declaration of the great Duke's still holds, true, we are in a
bad way. We have an army consisting of blackguards, whom we have
no Iron Duke to keep in order, though the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE
seems to manage them pretty well. The above-quoted passage relative to
the components of the British Army quite surprises us. We thought the
British soldier enjoyed the certainty of three meals a day, well cooked;
was housed in warm but well ventilated barracks, provided with clean
and comfortable dormitories, in which the married men were all sepa-
rated from the single—dormitories furnished with every convenience.
We believed that the soldiers were clothed and armed, as well as fed,
wholly and entirely at the public expense, which would fully account
for the Income-Tax. In addition to all gratuitous necessaries, and
some comforts, equally free, we imagined them to be in the receipt of
a daily shilling pocket-money. If it is indeed still true that, for the
most part, the man who enlists in the British Army is not, contrarily to
what the DUKE or WELLINGTON once said, one of the best men of his
trade or profession, we shall begin to think that we were mistaken in
our ideas of the soldier's lot, and shall be led to fancy that he must be
ill fed, ill lodged, and supplied in a great measure at his own cost,
having his pay subject to various stoppages, which reduce it to a figure
considerably under fourpence a day.
THE POPE AND THE BALLET.
THE Pontifical Government, according to the Times, allows the
Roman opera 18,000 crowns a-year. A good many Peter's pence,
therefore, go into the short petticoats and pink tights of the ballet-
girls, unless their petticoats are as long as those of his Holiness him-
self, who also, like the danseuses, wears white satin shoes. The Pop E
patronises the ballet, like a good, old gentleman. Fancy the Jolly
Father sº the scenes, and imparting his paternal benediction
to the coryphées by poking them in the waist with his thumb and two
first fingers.
A New Musical Movement.
WE have already had Songs hithout Words. Now, as the words of
an opera are never heard, and, moreover, as the libretto of an opera,
when heard, is not, nine hundred and ninety-nine instances out of a
thousand, ever worth listening to, would it not be a great gain to have
an Opera hºithout h’ords? No one would miss the absence of the
latter, and the omission might probably be an additional inspiration to
the composer, inasmuch as he would not be hampered by the nonsense
to which he is generally called upon to wed immortal music. The
public would gain largely on that score.
The New Bishop.
“A Good appointment? No, it’s not,”
Said old beer-drinking PETER WATTs,
“At Worcester one but hears ‘PHIL-Pot,”
At generous Exeter, “PHIL-Pots.’”
A Rale Splitting Compliment.
Ir is not often we pay compliments, especially to Americans, but we
confess we do like complimenting an honest man, when by chance we
meet with one. We suggest, therefore, with great pride and pleasure,
that the White House at Washington should change its name, and
henceforth—out of honour to the President elect, and as a graceful
record commemorating his election—be called LincoLN's Inn.
SEASONABLE ADVERTISEMENTS.
AVE YOU SEEN THE NEW BRONZE COINAGE! If you
have, you may perhaps be interested o know that it was struck expressly to
assist the British public in receiving pleasant cºunge when they are buying Punch's
4lmanack. For a shilling tendered over the counter of the Punch Office you may
obtain three Almanacks (no family can do with less) and get three, six, or a dozen
of the elegant bronze medals of HER MAJEsty supplied to you, according as you
wish your change in farthings, halfpennies, or pence.
THE BEST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENTS is clearly Punch's Alma-
nack, for it contains a feast of all the “good things" of the season, which will
disagree with nobody, and please every taste.
USBANDS, IF YOU BEAT YOUR WIVES, you should be kept
on water gruel, and not allowed to get a sight at Punch's Almanack, until it is
found that you have no strength left to laugh at it. A harsher punishment than
this it would puzzle the invention of a Chinese to suggest.
IS LAUGHING INJURIOUS 1 Because if it is, the publishers of
Punch's Almanack have a great deal to auswer for. It can be proved by the Inost
reliable statistics that more laughing has been caused by this inirthful publication
than by all the jest books and Joe Millers that ever have been written, and all the
Christmas games and pantomimes that ever have been played for aunusement at
this festive and facetious season.
O YOU BEUISE YOUR OATS YET Many who are asked this
question will return the stupid answer; “No, but we cut our corns." A certain
cure for these bad jokes is supplied by Punch's Almanack, which, in addition to its
gallery of pictures (any one of which is worth all that REMB RANDT, Robens,
WANDyke, Titi AN, CLAUDE, SAlvatoti Rosa, Porter, Cuyp, or TiNTokETTo ever
painted) contains above a unillion model jests to study from, any one of which would
Imake the instant tortune of a writer of burlesques.
Nº PASSPORT REQUIRED by purchasers of Punch's Almanack//
On and after Tuesday next, the possession of this interesting and invaluable
work (which may be bought at all the railways for the trifling sum of Threepence)
will entitle British subjects to land and stay in France without hindrance or
inquiry by the gens d'armes or police. One trial will prove the fact. Millions
selling daily I Be in time !! Be in time !!!
“IS YOUR HEART IN THE HIGHLANDS!” If so, you ought
certainly to purchase Punch's Almanack : where, besides a thousand other
things that will amuse you, you will see how your friend BRiggs went out Deer
Stalking in Scotland, and cause to grief as funnily as you might do yourself.
O YOU WANT LUXURIOUS WHISKERS Then by all means
buy a hundred dozen copies of the Almanack, and distribute them with barrels
of oysters to your friends. Far better spend your money rationally than lay it out
in ‘‘ balms” and beastlinesses which destroy the hair, and prevent its ever being
appareut on your cheeks.
DIZZY TO THE RESCUE.
WHEN British Bucolicals cowered in dismay,
As CoBDEN and PEEL struck the Corn Laws away,
Who lifted the flag they had dropped in the path,
Gave voice to their vengeance, and wit to their wrath,
Set flame to the fire that they hid in their hearts,
With poison and point tipped their impotent darts,
Though in Burke's County Gentry his name was unknown,
Though no rent-roll he showed, called no acre his own,
Though he ne'er handled ox, nor knew barley from rye f
“Who,” Vivian Grey may ask proudly, “but I ?”
And now, when the Church in alarm looks around,
When its canous are rusty, its mitres unsound,
When its synodals rive, and its articles rend,
And the garrison squabble that Qught to defend,
When Neology scales e'en the citadel's walls,
And Heresy whispers in grey College Halls,
When tolerance holds to Dissenters the hand,
And Church-rates by tott’ring majorities staud,
Who springs to the helm, at the ship's deepest lurch,
And summons to quarters the crew of the Church,
Though one whom no Oxford nor Cambridge has nursed,
With orthodox swaddlings unblessed or uncursed,
Who from Abraham's bosom his nourishment drew,
In name, as in look,and lineage a Jew—
Who, with alien hand the Church flag lifts on high P
“Who,” Vivian Grey may ask proudly, “but I?”
The Political Chess-Board in America.
THE game is still going on. It is for Black to make the next move,
and White is waiting with the greatest anxiety. Thousands are de-
pendant on the result. Some say that White must win, whilst others
contend just as confidently, that Black, if there is anything like fair
play, must sweep the board; but the knowing old players, who are up
to every turn of the game, and have calmly calculated the chances on
both sides, declare, without the slightest hesitation, that it will be a
drawn game. Our good wishes are all on the side of White.

A CANZONET FOR CHRISTMAS.
BY A POET WHO LOOKS ALWAYS on TBE BLACK-Doº slop
OF THINGs.
HAPPY ye who gaily go
'Neath the§. mistletoe,
Or enjoy life's giddy whir
Waltzing with a lively gir
Happy ye of riper age,
Who i. the dance no more engage,
But deem of Christmas joys the chief,
Its turkey, pudding, pies, and beef.
But ah! The mistletoe looks grim
When you see her there with him / .
Nor is there vast delight in dancing,
When on plaguy corns you’re prancing?
And ye who feast on Christmas fare,
The pangs of biliousness beware,
Lest haply one for draughts and pills
May help to swell your Christmas bills.

[ CIWILISATION IN RUSSIA.
THE Deuce is not so deep of dye as painters have repre-
sented him, nor are the º so barbarous as they
are commonly supposed. Fools and bullies are discouraged
from duelling as far as possible by heavy Jºliº Never-
theless, a duel was fought the other day between two
blockheads in the Russian army, LIEUTENANT PRINCE
GoRTSCHAKOFF and LIEUTENANT BARON FITINGHoFF.
The name of the latter fool or ruffian was, we trust, a
nickname which he acquired by his fire-eating propensities.
He got his bellyful this time, however: he was shot.
Three other numskulls acted...as seconds and partici-
pators in this affair of folly. The surviving duellist has
been, deprived of, his orders and reduced to the ranks.
The two more culpable of the seconds are imprisoned in
casemated acks, one for four and the other for six
months. . These are commuted sentences. The bullet-
headed fools had incurred social as well as military
degradation, and eight years' confinement in a fortress.
They manage these things in Russia better than in France,
where society is at the mercy of practised assassins, whom
it permits to hold a pistol to the head of anybody, they
may wish to murder, and demand his money or his life.
LATIN UNDER THE LASH.
A School.MASTER, in giving a boy a flogging, waited
about a minute between the cuts of the rod. Bisdat qui
cito dat, cried the victim to the tormentor.
JOHN BULL'S CHRISTMAS-BOX.
Go on only as you have been going of late,
And, NAPOLEoN, you’ll get named NApoleon THE GREAT.
The new freedom you’ve granted Debate and the Press
Is a move in the right line, John BULL must confess.
Of Passports he thanks you for setting him free,
And is glad to accept from your hands a latch-key,
Right oft his vast shadow will darken your door,
Now his visit you’ve rendered exempt from a bore.
In another point also he owns you’ve done good;
In #. rance free trade—as free as you could.
An ſº under his great waistcoat glows,
For the Treaty of Commerce, as far as it goes.
Now if you will only recall your troops home,
And let Italy deal with Gaëta and Rome,
We shall say that you’ve nobly wound up a good year,
And your health drink in claret—exchanged for our beer.
From “The Hue and Cry."
THE Fº boast that they often give effectual assistance to the D
e never heard of their really doing so, until the other day
when they published a picture said to contain capital likenesses of all
Police. never
the habitual Patrons of the Ring.
PILLARS OF THE PAPACY.
According to telegram:—
“The Pontifical Zouaves have re-entered Rome.”
Just the men to sustain the Papal chair on the points of their
bayonets! The late LADY MoRGAN's revelation touching ST. PETER's
chair, showed that if PETER owned that chair, he probably bought
it at some Mahometan sale, or was presented with it by a Mussulman
convert; moreover, that PETER thought ti', to retain the inscription on
the chair, which acknowledged MAuoxſet for the Prophet. A
St. PETER could not have possessed ºnat article of furniture consis-
tently with chronology, the fact of mis chair is, of course, a miracle;
and accordingly, the chair ought to support itself as well, at least, as
one of MR. Home's tables; but, if not self-sustaining, this Ottoman-
%. of PETER can have no better support than the bayonets of
uaves.
Holy Westments for the Church.
THE attention of every one is requested to the fact, that there
exists a Society for supplying the Clergy with cast-off clothes. Please
copy the address, 345, Strand. It is really the fact, and no mistake,
and no joke—except at the expense of the opulent Bishops and rich
eans who permit the Society to exist.
