O close a volume is, in the ordinary matters of literature, a heavy, dumpish process. The author feels
that, for a time at least, he has taken leave of the world. With Punch it is—as are all other mortal
events—altogether different. Punch merely closes one volume to begin another. His ink is not a pond, but a
perpetual spring : his goose-quill renews its youth like Juno, by the bath it continues to dabble in. Here
are Four Volumes of PUNCH completed, and yet is the goose-quill of PUNCH as full of promise as when
in a state of gosling-hood.
When Punch concludes one Volume, he instantly calls on another and a better. In the like way, that a
host who knows the serious responsibility of life has port succeeded by claret, claret by burgundy, and so on,
until as the renowned MR. Jenkins of The Morning Post (hang that fellow !—why will he always write “too
well?") would say, “the lachrymae Christi produce that costumed thought which liveries the intellect in its
rainbow effulgence.”
Every man may be instructed by PUNCH.
Whether he rule in a Chancery-court, or keep a ledger in a court in the City—whether as a Chancellor of
the Exchequer he has to balance John Bull's accounts, or as a Sevon Dials' mountebank has to balance an
animal that might very often typify the same John, especially when “accounts” were in question—every man
to lighten the dead weight, to soothe the weariness of life, should indulge in nothing but—Punch.
As for Punch himself, he knows no more of bragging than his own trumpet—not he. And, therefore, as
he well knows that there are many persons wandering about the world, who give themselves out as his especial
ministers, PUNCH requests the world not to believe them. The sages who shed ink for Punch, never talk of
their labours.

iv. PUNCH'S PREFACE.
Hence, when a certain Bishop boasts, as we know he does, of supplying the Money-Markets to Punch, we
say, with all respect for his Grace—Don't believe him.
The King of Hanover gives himself out as Punch's foreign Correspondent. Don't believe him.
Lord Brough AM is in the habit of taking PUNCH to the Lords, and dropping his finger upon a sparkling
paragraph, whispers to Wellington—“I wrote that.” Punch is sorry that he must say—Don’t believe him.
We know that these people have, all of them, tried their hands upon certain soft paper imitations of
Punch, for which special reason, they have specially failed.
No, no, gentle public. The Ministers of PUNCH are severe, grave men, in horse-hair coats, with beards
down to their waists, and ordinarily walking with staffs horn-tipped. They dwell in caves, their common food is
the roots of the earth—their ordinary liquor is the best spring water, and their names are—
But that, very gentle reader, you shall know on the completion of our hundredth volume. May you live
to see it !

POLITICAL
T HE commencement of the year 1843 was marked by the
great amount of distress which existed among the in-
dustrious classes of the community, and was sufficiently
attested by the serious diminution of consumption in all articles
which contribute to the public revenue. The Excise returns
exhibited a falling off equal to two millions and a half per
annum, and the Customs showed nearly a similar amount of
diminished revenue. The Stamps and Taxes were equally
unproductive, and the total yearly deficiency was calculated
at five millions and a half. The distress consequent on such a
state of the revenue had been borne with great patience by
the people, but necessarily engendered an uneasy feeling in
the public mind, and an impression that some changes were
necessary for the general benefit. Some blamed the reckless
speculation of the manufacturers as the cause of the prevailing
distress, while others attributed it to the operation of the Corn-
Laws; and the Poor-Law [Milk of Poor-Law Kindness]
and Income-Tax were also equally obnoxious to censure.
These different theories found their advocates in Parliament;
but all agreed in the existence of a general distress, and the
necessity for considering those public affairs which bore directly
upon the internal condition of the people, and affected the
physical comfort and resources of the industrious classes, and
through them the fiscal condition of the country.
Parliament was opened by Commission on the 2nd of Fe-
bruary, and the QUEEN's Speech [The Queen's Speech]
&69 was read by the LoRD CHANCELLOR. The Address was moved
in the House of Lords by EARL PowIs, and seconded by the
EARL of EGLINToUN. No opposition was offered to the
Address, but LoRD LANSDown E took exception to many asser-
tions therein put forward, and provoked a warm reply from
the DUKE of WELLINGTON, who eulogised the conduct of the
SUMMARY.
Government in respect to the Ashburton Treaty, the conclu-
sion of the War in China [The Button and Peacock], and
declared his readiness to uphold all the acts of the Governor-
General of India, LoRD ELLENBoRough. [Gates of Som-
nauth.] In the House of Commons LoRD Court.NEY moved
the Address, and it was seconded by MR. PHILIP MILEs. SIR
RoBERT PEEL made an important speech, in which he asserted
his satisfaction with the American treaty, which had “ob-
tained such a division of the disputed district as secures our
possessions in North America, and preserves our military com-
munication in tact, and is far more favourable to this country
than the arrangement proposed by the KING OF THE NETHER-
LANDS.” He accounted for much of the lost revenue by
the reduction which had taken place under the New Tariff
[Royal Nursery Rhymes], and cautioned the House
against drawing gloomy and unfavourable inferences from the
existing temporary distress. He claimed a fair trial for the
new financial measures, and declared that no further changes
would be made, as he could not forget that protection had been
the rule in this country, and under it extensive interests had
grown up, and that in making changes to create contentment
you may produce distress, and obstruct the progress of right
principles. He considered that the New Corn Law had not had
a sufficient trial to justify him in proposing the abrogation of a
duty upon corn. The Income-Tax, he believed, had been no
burthen upon the people, as there had been such a reduction of
prices on all articles of consumption as enabled all parties to
make a saving equivalent to the amount contributed by them
in the form of Income-Tax.
LoRD JoHN RUssell considered the Speech from the Throne
“wisely and judiciously framed to avoid calling for a differ-
ence of vote,” and therefore he would not oppose the Address,
Duke of BuccLEUGH AND QUEENSBURY.

but he took exception to the conduct of LoRD ELLENBoRough,
then Governor-General of India, and who had issued a procla-
mation [Proclamation of a “Tame Elephant”] which
many people in this country did not believe at first to be
genuine. “Although there is much in that proclamation,”
said his Lordship, “that is very absurd, so much so that the
very name of “the despoiled tomb of SULTAN MAHMoUD looking
down upon the ruins of Ghuznee” got to be a jest in the
country, yet the whole tone and substance of the proclama-
tion have a very direct meaning. Much as I desire to see the
introduction of Christianity into the East, I should be sorry to
see any attempt partaking in the least degree of violence; but
on the other hand, that any man coming from a Christian
land, and who had enjoyed the benefits of its institutions,
should pay the respect which that proclamation indicates to
such gross and idolatrous worship, does appear to me to be a
proceeding well calculated to lessen the respect with which
Englishmen and the English Government ought to be regarded
in India. These matters are not insulated blunders, and are
calculated to alarm one as regards the general calm, sober, and
judicious conduct of the Governor of India.” As this docu-
called forth strong expressions of censure and condemnation
when first made known in this country, we append it:—
“Proclamation from the Governor-General to all the Princes and Chiefs and
People of India:—
“My Brothers and my Friends,—Our victorious army bears the gates of
the temple of Somnauth in triumph from Afghanistan, and the despoiled
tomb of Sultan Mahmoud looks upon the ruins of Ghuznee. The insult of
800 years is at last avenged. The gates of the temple of Somnauth, so long
the memorial of your humiliation, are become the proudest record of your
national glory—the proof of your superiority in arms over the nations beyond
the Indus. To you, princes and chiefs of Sirhind, of Rajwarra, of Malwa, and
Guzerat, I shall commit this glorious trophy of successful war. You will,
yourselves, with all honour, transmit the gates of sandal-wood through your
respective territories, to the restored temple of Somnauth. The chiefs of
Sirhind shall be informed at what time our victorious army will first deliver
the gates of the temple into their guardianship, at the foot of the bridge of
the Sutlej.
“My Brothers and my Friends,--I have ever relied with confidence upon
your attachment to the British Government. You see how worthy it proves
itself of your love, when, regarding your honour as its own, it exerts the
power of its arms to restore to you the gates of the temple of Sornnauth, so
long the memorial of your subjection to the Afghans. For myself, identified
with you in interest and in feeling, I regard with all your own enthusiasm
the high achievements of that heroic army, reflecting alike immortal honour
upon my native and upon my adopted country. To preserve and to improve
the happy union of our two countries, necessary as it is to the welfare of
both, is the constant object of my thoughts. Upon that union depends the
*ecurity of every ally, as well as of every subject, of the British Government,
from the miseries whereby, in former times, India was afflicted: through
that alone has our army now waved its triumphant standards over the ruins
of Ghumee, and planted them upon the Bala Hissar of Cabul.
“May that good Providence which has hitherto so manifestly protected
me, still extend to me its favour, that I may 80 use the power now intrusted
to my hands, as to advance your prosperity and secure your happiness, by
i. º union of our two countries upon foundations which may render
t eternal 1"
Lord John Russell, declared that the operation of the New
Corn Law strengthened his conviction that a moderate fixed
duty was the best system upon which to conduct the trade
in corn, and could not conceive that SIR Robert PEEL was
determined to make no further concession. He next touched
upon the Income-Tax, which he said had been framed to
exempt persons of £150 a year, but practically persons having
£30 or £40 in the funds had to pay, as the difficulty of pro-
ouring a return of the Tax when once levied deterred many
from making the effort. Another grievance was that persons
who made a fair return were subject to a surcharge, and put
to great inconvenience to prove the incorrectness of the impo-
sition. Lord John complained that the Queen's Speech
mºde no recognition of the noble forbearance and love of order
displayed by the working men, who, after three years of great
privations, assembled by thousands from their workshops and
factories, while there was no force at hand to control them for
three days; and though urged by the inflammatory harangues
of reckless demagogues to join the Chartists, and to overturn
the Constitution, returned to their work peaceably, without
any influence from others. Such conduct he considered was
worthy of admiration and respect; but he found no such
feeling displayed in the Speech. He implored the House to
enter upon an investigation of the causes of distress with a
view to find some practical remedy.
LonD STANLEY vindicated the conduct of Lord ELLENBo-
Rough, and considered the objections to the proclamation
“mere matters of taste:” and after some observations by
LoRD PALMERSTON, MB. HUME, MR. FERRAND (who pro-
posed to tax all descriptions of machinery), and other Members,
the Address was carried unanimously.
The continued commercial and general distress produced
universal uneasiness, and made the Anti-Corn-Law League
more active in denouncing the present sliding scale. LoRD
HowICK's motion for a Committee to inquire into the state of the
country was regarded with much anxiety, and the debate conse-
quent thereon is remarkable for the variety of opinions expressed
as to the cause of the existing distress. The debate lasted five
nights, most of the leading Members of the House speaking,
and the motion was rejected by 306 to 191. During the
debate MR. CoBDEN declared that he should hold SIR RoBERT
PEEL “individually responsible: ” an opinion which had
given great offence when used at a Meeting of the Anti-Corn-
Law League. SIR RoPERT PEEL, amidst immense cheering,
took notice of the expression [A Pleasant Position], and
MR. CoRDEN endeavoured in vain to explain his meaning of
the word “individually,” so vociferous was the interruption,
a significance having been given to the words by the recent
melancholy death of MR. DRUMMOND. At the close of the
debate, MR. CoBDEN again rose to disavow the meaning which
had been imputed to him in the employment of the word “in-
dividually,” and SIR RoBERT PEEL accepted the explanation.
[The Pearls of Parliament.]
LoRD ASHLEY (now the EARL of SHAFTESBURY) moved an
Address to the Crown on the Education of the labouring
classes, and gave some shocking details of the vice and
wretchedness existing in our large manufacturing towns. The
motion was agreed to without opposition.
MR. CHARLEs BULLER proposed a plan for systematic
colonisation, and enforced his opinions in a speech remark-
able for great ability and promise of future statesmanship.
LoRD STANLEY (now the EARL OF DERBY), although agreeing
with MR. BULLER's sentiments, considered the motion
uncalled for, as an extensive system of emigration was
carried on by the Government. MR. BULLER, therefore,
withdrew his motion.
On Feb. 9th, MR. WERNoN SMITH moved for papers in the
House of Commons, and referred to LoBD ELLENBoROUGH’s
proclamation before alluded to. In the debate which ensued, the
Governor of India was accused of holding language with refe-
rence to an idolatrous and foul form of worship unbecoming a
Christian ruler. [The “Christian” Bayadere Worshipping
the Idol “Siva.”] When an ancient temple at Guzerat was
destroyed by MAHMoUD of GHUzNEE in 1025, he carried away
the gates which were made of sandal wood. When Ghuznee
was taken by GENERAL NoTT, LoRD ELLENBorough ordered
the gates to be restored after an exile of 800 years, and the

INTRODUCTION.
creeds, a circumstance considered likely to produce the worst
consequences in India. It was said that the government of
India had turned the head of the noble Lord, and that he was
no longer fitted to hold such an important office. The
MARQUIs of CLANRICARDE on the 9th of March, made a like
statement in the House of Lords, when the DUKE of WEL-
LINGTON defended the absent Governor, and received unlooked-
for support from LoRD BROUGHAM. [What is to become
of Lord Brougham P] The resolution in the House of Lords
was rejected by 83 to 25, and a similar one in the House of
Commons by 242 to 157. [Scene from Romeo and Juliet.]
Votes of thanks to the Army and Fleet for their services in
China, and to LoRD ELLENBoRough and the officers and men
engaged in the Affghanistan war, were carried in both Houses
unanimously. MR. RoeBUCK, on the 2nd of March, moved
for a Select Committee, to inquire into the cause of the
Afghan war, and took occasion to accuse the late Ministry of
falsifying the despatches of SIR. A. BURNEs, omitting an
important passage, to which reference was made again in
1861. The motion in 1843 was rejected by 189 to 75.
The sliding scale of the last session had by no means settled
the question of the Corn Laws, and whilst it gave dissatis-
faction generally to the agricultural interest, it in no way
lessened the exertions of the Anti-Corn-Law League for a total
repeal of duty upon imported grain. MR. WARD therefore
moved on the 14th of March for a Committee to inquire into
the special burdens on landed property, and was opposed by
the whole Government party, and supported by MR. Cobden
and all the advocates for repeal of the Corn Laws. The
motion was rejected by 232 to 133. MR. WILLIERs then moved
for a Committee of the whole House on the Corn Laws, and
was defeated by a majority of 256. LoRD JoHN RUSSELL
renewed the motion for a Committee on the Corn Laws with a
view to a fixed duty, but the motion was negatived by a
majority of 99. Previously, however, to the last debate,
LoRD STANLEY (Secretary for the Colonies) had proposed a
measure slightly affecting the operation of the Corn Laws.
The Protectionists were greatly alarmed by the proposition
(which was to impose a duty of 3s. only on each quarter of
wheat imported into this country from Canada), [Smelling
a Rat, believing it to be an indication on the part of the
Government to yield to the growing popular demand for the
abolition of duties upon corn. [The Modern Macheath.]
MR. G. HEATHcoTE and MR. MILEs, both leading Members in
the landed interest, opposed the measure, as did many other
members usually found voting with the Government. The
debate was very animated, and touched upon so many topics
that it was chiefly remarkable for its confusion of parties.
The majority for the motion was 81. A Bill was subsequently
founded on the resolution, and MR. SHEIL, having accused
LoRD STANLEY with threatening the supporters of the
Government with resignation should the Bill not pass, the
Secretary for the Colonies sharply denied that Ministers had
taken “the indecent liberty” attributed to them, and did not
wonder that a member of the late Government should recom-
mend any measure rather than resignation. The second
reading was carried by 209 to 109.
In the House of Lords the debate on the Bill commenced on
the 4th of July, the EARL of DALHOUSIE being the mover,
and LoRD BROUGHAM the seconder, “not,” as he said,
“because the measure was a step towards the total removal
of the Corn Laws, but because it removed an anomaly.”
[Sancho Panza tossed in a Blanket], and [A Scene at
Greenwich Fair.]
32, and the Bill passed without amendment. The deficiency
in the Revenue, which was a frequent theme of reproach to
the Ministry, explains the cuts at pp. 187, 227.
The present Session (like its predecessors for many years)
was largely occupied with Irish affairs, and the introduction
of an Arms Act, nearly similar to one which had been passed
by the Whig Cabinet, gave occasion to a long debate. Most
of the Irish members were opposed to its introduction, and
LoRD CLEMENTs in particular, distinguished himself by the
violence of his harangues. The most sensible speaker upon
the occasion was MoRGAN JoHN O'Conn ELL. MR. S. O'BRIEN
gave indications during this debate of those strong opinions
which subsequently produced so much injury to Ireland and
to himself. The Ministers made out their case by describing
the unsettled state of Ireland, and the consequent insecurity
of life and property, and succeeded in carrying the Bill by
270 to 105.
A great deal of valuable time was consumed over the second
reading of the Bill, and the debate only served to create
irritation and more confirmed difference of opinion between
the contending parties. MR. O'ConnELL was carrying on
vigorously out of the House, the Repeal Movement, and the
House of Lords was occupied for some time in discussing the
propriety of SIR Edward SUGDEN dismissing LoRD FFRENCH
from the Commission of the Peace, and from the Deputy
Lieutenancy for attending a Repeal meeting, at which some
very violent language had been used. The DUKE of WEL-
LINGTON justified the course taken by the Government on
these grounds. [Genuine Agitation.] It was well known
that Parliament was determined the Union should not be
repealed, and these “meetings for Repeal of the Union, con-
sisting of 20,000, 10,000, or 100,000 men—no matter the
number of thousands—having been continued after these
declarations in Parliament, I wish to know with what object
they were continued ? With a view to address Parliament to
repeal the Union by the terror of the people, and if not by
terror, by force and violence.” The resolutions (which were
moved by the MARQUIs of CLANRICARDE) were negatived by
91 to 29. The conclusion of the Session of 1843 will be
found in the next volume.

Q. were written by the late Douglas JERROLD, one of Punch's
earliest and most valuable contributors.
The Approaching Session.—The Observer newspaper was
distinguished at this time by the rigmarole style of its leaders.
Latest News from Windsor.—SIB (MR.) F. G. Moon,
a wealthy publisher, was too frequently in receipt of honours
more properly due to the distinguished artists who supplied
the subjects of his publications.
Sir Peter Laurie on Wood.—SIR PETER LAURIE’s op-
position to the introduction of Wood Pavement for the Streets
of London was thought at this time to be ill-judged. The
objections proved in the end to be correct.

the 25th. On March 3rd, MACNAUGHTEN was tried at the
Central Criminal Court, before Lord CHIEF JUSTICE TINDAL,
MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS, and MR. JUSTICE ColeRIDGE, and ac-
quitted on the ground of insanity. He was afterwards placed
in one of the receptacles for insane persons for permanent
confinement. MACNAUGHTEN had mistaken MR. DRUMMOND
for SIR Rob ERT PEEL.
The “Post” at the Opera.-In this article MR.
JENKINs makes his first appearance in Punch. The celebrity
he afterwards attained induced one or two gentlemen to claim
to be his prototype. MR. JENKINs was, however, an imaginary
person.

for some time declined the appointment.
Literary Mendicity.—The Book was called the Chronicles
of the Careworn.

elder sisters' pelisses into little girls' cloaks. Prepare hot
bedsfor colds caught at snowballing, or tumbling through the
ice. Cut sprigs of birch and hang up for future use. Plant
suckers of hardbake and cuttings of Twelfth-cakein nurses'
cupboards. Previous to Black Monday general crops may
be looked for. Rake heads with small-tooth comb and
dress with pomatum.
warensien's FAREs.-For every hackney-coach called
off the stand—optional. For every empty cab stopped in
the street—nothing.
To DREss CALF's Head —Take your head and rub in a
thick lather all over the face, then paro off with a sharp
instrument. wipe well with a clean towel, and place picces
of starched linen about halfway up the cheek. Lard the
crown with any kind of grease, a few drops of oil may

of his own admissions. If therefore the manager of a
theatre gives an order and gets hissed by the person coming

To obtain Been from Chalk-This is an easy and
common process, and may be put in practice as follows:-
Go to a respectable public-house, having first taken a resi-
dence or lodging in the neighbourhood. When you wish for
beer resort freely to the chalk, and go on, getting as much as
you can upon this principle, until it becomes unproductive,
when you may try it in another quarter.
Astronomical Obsenvarions—Sagittarius, the Archer, is

Nores of the Month.-The stars of Drury Lane and

and amalign influence reigns over the Poultry: not merely
the two Turkeys, but two thousand, appear in the service
of China. Peace smiles in Afghanistan, since Ghuznee
was knocked down in separate lots by General Sale. Celes-
tial sparring on the 25th; the moon squares to Mars.
The New Year-Those who have not been accustomed
to pay any accounts should now begin. January is the
time for good resolutions; and that is why the Houses of
Parliament never meet until February.
Miscºllanzous—Turkeys are in season this month. If
they are required to be plumped and fattened, we should
recommend using copies of Mr. Ferrand's speeches, which
are known to be the most extraordinary crammers.
sporting.—The slipper may be hunted in family circles:
the fair sex joining in the chase. Blindman's-buff and
Snap-dragon are in season, and requirenogame certificates.
Domestic and MoRal-On the 1st, call early on rich
old aunts and grandmothers, at whose death you expect
legacies, to wish them many happy new years. Present
young ladies with Affection's offerings, Keepsakes, and
Books of Beauty. At academies lay in your green birch,
and prepare to meet your young friends. -

A Tanuk To Calculatz Wages.-Put down, first of all,
the nominal wages received by your servant, which by cal-
culation you will find to be the exact half of twice as
much. Then subtract the fresh butter from the pantry,
and the product will show you how often the best Dorset will
go into the tub of kitchen-stuff. Then work out the sum:
as the parlour Stilton is to the Dutch cheese, so is the cold
meat to the young man who stands outside the area of an
evening. Divide the contents of the tea-caddy into what
you use yourself, and what is used for you, and the quo-
tient will be as one to six. Writo these several results
upon a slate, and by adding them up carefully you will be
enabled to calculate how much your servant costs you.

chase a loaf without weighing it, and your bread will cer-
tainly be short.
Notes or Thr Month.-The moon staying in the house
of Aquarius, the Preissnitz of the Zodiac,+takes to cold-
water-drinking out of compliment to her landlord. We
perceive, on referring to our astronomical works, she has
her “ First Quart" on the 7th, and her “Last Quart" on
the 21st; which has such an excellent effect, that we find
her quite a “New Moon” at the end of the month. Much
will occur in this month, which we do not foretoll for fear
it should not come to pass; but the circumstance of
February being so exceedingly short, will excuse us for
overlooking several of its events.
To make youn own BREAD.—Take the yeast of industry,
and blend it well with the flour of integrity. By following
these simple directions, it is probable that you will make
your own bread.
Pardºcrions.-On the 10th there will most likely be
a royal dinner party, to commemorate the marriage of our
gracious Sovereign; but what there will be for dinner it is
impossible to foretell; though it is nearly certain that
potatoes will be included in the bill of fare, and also that
some one of the illustrious guests will drink beer. Hare
hunting will end on the 27th-probably in some capsizes
Dirreakncz of TIME-When it is a quarter-past eight
at Greenwich, it will want about forty-five minutes to
nine at Deptford, and the kitchen clock at Windsor Castle
will be slow if not regulated.

TWITS SOLUMN.
A Plain and Easy Mrthod to find the Time of High
WATER.—Take a cheap lodging in a cellar in Ratcliffe-
highway. When the rats run out of their holes and over
your bed, then the tide is rising; but when the flounders
get into your pillow-case, and the bed is gently floated up
until your nose touches the ceiling, then it is high water.
On the other hand, it is low water when you cannot afford ==
to pay yourrent: and it is then advisable to ebb yourself.
A Second MRTHUD.-Walk to Hungerford-market, and
purchase a halfpennyworth of shrimps. Then sit on the
steam-boat pier and enjoy them, throwing their heads and E
tails into the water. If they float towards Blackfriars the
tide is going out; but if they go towards Westminster, then
it is flowing. If they do neither one nor the other, then it
is either high or low water; which may be ascertained by
watching the people fall off the plank when they land from
the boats, and seeing how deep they go.
Userul REMARKs.—“It is an ill wind that blows nobody
good;" and you should therefore go out every day in March,
with the hope that you may comein for “the good" that the
ill winds which prevail about this time are said to blow to
somebody. --
LEGAL HINTs.-A beggar with several children is not
at liberty under the Wagrant Act to plead the general
issue.
REMAnks on THE WEATHER.—The greatest dryness will
be at Westminster Hall, during the arguments of counsel;
the greatest moisture at the Cider Cellars after the
Theatres.
Prophritc.-Quarter-day may belooked for on the 25th.
Several tenants may also be looked for about the same time,
but whether they will be found is another question.
Medical--A good remedy against March, or any other
wind. Take of best cognac brandy one go, of loaf sugar
three lumps, of pump-water (boiling) as much as you like; ;
stir with spoon, and drink down hot after a full meal. s-
Boys, particularly, this month should beware of bad chaps,
they being very prone to injure young hands.
Norrs of THE Month-The Wernal Ingress commences
March 21, and Spring-not Tom-beats Winter from the
field. Quarter-day brings trouble and wailing; and noc-
turnal transits of various bodies take place on occult paths
forming the hides (and seeks, of March. Mr. Jones and
his infantry retreat from a charge, himself leading the van.
In compliment to his saint, the Prince of Wales cuts anew
tooth on the 1st.
Philosophical.-The Wind is a phenomenon. It blows
very hard round the corners of streets and through courts
or alleys; but, perhaps the fact of there being generally a
pawnbroker's shop in such a position, accounts for the
wind being generally raised there.
Ramakks. By A NATURAList.—The common flea appears
..] to build its abode in the coat of the ordinary dog. In
warm weather the flea will migrate, and becomes the con-
stant companion of man.
The sleepy appearance perceptible in the hackney-coach
horse has not been accounted for by Buffon, nor has Cuvier
touched on the same subject. English naturalists differ
on the point, and science is therefore silent. -
Economic AND Monar.-Mind your eyes on account of the
dust; and lookout for chimney-pots and other “breakers
a-head." Sift your ashes on Ash Wednesday in readiness

Arºn--This month is said to be derived from aperire, tº ºpen,
because seeds begin to germinate and flowers to blow therein. A slight
objection to this piece of etymology is, that many seeds germinate and
several flowers blow before April; moreover, the Opera usuall
opens in February; so does the Parliament. Others affirm that it
comes from ãppos, scum; Venus having arisen from the scum of the

Rºmulations Respecting Elections.— Presuming the

should be attended to:-Substitutes must be found for dead
or transported electors by March 20.—Persons objecting to
claims of candidate must have notice to quit their tene-
ments March 25.-Last day for purchasing ten guinea legs
of mutton and five-pound cakes of soap, of doubtful free-
holders, March 27–Last day for collecting antique eggs.

Astronomical Observations—Canis Major (the large

rius the water-bearer (whosprinkles him with the watering-
pot), seizes from the Libra (or scales) a piece of Taurus (or
beef-steak) from Virgo (the maid), who is weighing it.
Notes of THE Month.-The knife of the butcher enters
Aries, and many fore-quarters of lamb are the result; and
several delays in the Easter-piece rehearsals provide
Covent Garden with a cross Bunn, most applicable to the
Passion Week. The clerk of the weather unbridles the
mouths of the clouds, and lets go the rains, from which
cause, coupled with the wind, many umbrellas are seen to
revolve on their axes, and describe eccentric orbits. A
planet which, according to Francis Moore, somewhat re-
sembles the number24 knocked into one figure, is said to be
in perigee, and will promote concord and harmony: the
effect of this is seen in the many concerts which take place
at this time.
Mohal Maxims.-Itneverrains but itpours—Macintosh.
Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs—Editor of the

To Mull, WINE-Take a bottle of good claret, draw the

away again for a month. Pour it into a jug which has had
beer put into it by mistake, and serve it out in any way you
like, when you will find your claret mulled most effectually
Mstronological.-The depth of rain fallen in April
1842, was in the puddles of Tottenham-court-road 123456
inch, and somewhat less in the pocket of a cabman on the
same spot. In a cracked pipkin on the wall of Mr. Snooks
back-yard, 6.54321 inches; and in the garret bedroom of
Mr. Jones, of Drury-lane, it varied according to the state of
the tiles.

Astronomical.-There will be a total eclipse of the
Norma Moon on one of the Covent Garden scenes, by the
paint-brush of Mr. Grieve, about Easter. This will be in-
visible to the greater part of the universe, but plainly dis-
tinguished by a few in the scene-room. A lunar occultation
will take place about the same time at the Adelphi, from
the lamp behind the flat tumbling down. This will be visible
from all parts of the house, but scarcely discernible from
the lobby of the second boxes, or the back of the pit.
GEoghaphical Observations.—Captain Ross, when he
visited the North Pole, took Chili on his way, and though
he doubled the Cape, still felt cold about the shoulders.
NotEs of THE Monrh.-The sweeps appear in perihelion
to Jack-in-the Green on the 1st. The stars of the first mag-
nitude at the Opera may now be seen in their greatest
brilliancy during the evening, through good glasses. The
satellites of Cerito are visible at intervals, and Perrot ap-
pears in conjunction with Carlotta Grisi. The latter planet
will be at her greatest distance from the earth when she
flies across the stage in Giselle.
To AscertAIN if MEAT is Good.-Call at a friend's house
about dinner-time; accept his invitation to sit down if he
gives it, and, if not, adopt the free-and-easy principle, by
inviting yourself. Taste freely of all the things on the
table, and you will be able to form your own opinion as to
whether the meat is good.
SENTIMENTAL ANd Domestic.—Now begin to roam through
flewery meadows with sweethearts; whisper soft nothings,
imprint soft somethings, and breathe hard vows. Steal out
at evening hours to listen to nightingales, and meet lady-
loves by moonlight alone at groves by the ends of vales. Eat
your small salad at supper with your bread and cheese–
if you can get it: in which case you will be lucky, con-
sidering the times.
Legal Hints.-If a trespasser is caught in a steel-trap,
he stands seized; but the tenant in possession may execute
a release, that is, if he takes a sufficient interest.
If a tragedian agrees to act a character, ard is hissed off
in the middle, it does not amount to a performance of his

Fon Reaning TIMBER.—Get a good acorn, and plant it in
a breakfast cup; and when it begins to open, which you can
ascertain by scratching up the mould, you may transfer it
to a flower-pot. Water freely with your bed-room pitcher,
and directly your plant begins to show itself above the
earth you should set it in the garden. Then watch your
shrub; and if it should continue to flourish, you may trans-
plant it when young to a forest. When it is †. large
enough, you may cut it down for ship-building.

instrument. Wrench, crunch, smash, crash, and you have

Arrificial Asses’ MILK.—Take an extract from the Par-
liamentary Reports, and it will generally give you a large
quantity of a milk-and-watery fluid. Strain off the water,
and what little milk may remain will most likely be arti-
ficial asses'.

June.—Junº comes from juvenes, young people; for, like an adver-

- |TWITS COLUMN.
Directions for ANGLERs.-The fishing-books tell us that
Chubb may be found near Teddington Locks; but the best
spot to find Chubb is near his own Detector Locks in St.
Paul's Church-yard, which must be taken as they come, no
picking being allowed. A good Perch may sometimes be
secured on a lamp or tree in the Park during reviews and
processions; and a Pike will soon reward the sportsman
at any of the principal outlets from London. You may be
sure of Flounders if you attempt to cross Battersea Marsh
in the dark. A species of Shark, known as the Income-Tax
Collector, is caught, like barbel, with a ledger. White
Bait are taken eagerly during the summer months with
brown bread and butter; and every kind of Fly may be
found returning from country tea-parties, where the
caddiſe)s will prove an attractive bait.
LEGAL Hint.-It has been decided that lunatics and
idiots may purchase, and therefore it is probable that if
Waterloo Bridge were offered for sale, a bargain might be
concluded.
AstroNoMical.—Madame Westris becomes a fixed star at
the Haymarket, and shines between 7 and 12 each evening.
Miss Adelaide Kemble becomes quite invisible, but it is
expected she may return to her old orbit. The laws of
attraction are considerably disarranged in the neighbour-
hood of Covent Garden by the retirement of this planet;
but Sagittarius (Bunn) who generally knows how to hit the
mark, takes Taurus by the horns, and supplies the place of
the lost planet.
To CLKAN PLATR.—The best mode of plate-cleaning is
that adopted in St. Giles's, which may be regarded as
an Eastern custom. Put your plate on the ground, and
turn a Newfoundland dog loose upon it.
Notes of THE Month.-Wan Amburgh walks into the
house of Leo, at the English Opera: let us hope that Leo
will not return the compliment by walking into him. The
solar opposition to Mars by Aquarius foretells a quarrel
between Father Mathew and Deaf Burke. Continual broils
take place in the kitchens of the Cider Cellars. Ursa
Major becomes the pole-star at the Zoological Gardens.
DIMENsion of THF DAY-The Australians call twelve
o'clock at night the middle of the day, and when we are
upon our heels they are upon their heads. The Chinese
day begins at night, a custom which the aristocratic indi-
viduals at the west-end of London have successfully endea.
voured to imitate.
REMEDIEs Fort FAINTing.—If the patient seems faint, the
first thing to be done is to rip his neck-handkerchief in two,
and cut the sleeves of his coat right up from the cuff to the
shoulder. This is much better than the slow process of
taking off or untying; and if consciousness should not be
quite gone, the very fact of the articles of dress being sacri-
ficed will have a beneficial effect on the patient. Throw
glasses of cold water rapidly into his face, and singe his
nose by burning a quantity of feathers under it. This
should be kept up till the patient has quite recovered.
To Cunk Tonguks.-A coarse tongue is very difficult to
7||cure. But there is a process known at the courts of law,
which is often efficacious in doing so. Some tongues are
harsh and rough, but a good deal of beating has often the
effect of softening them down amazingly. Aº
Medical.—Children home for the holidays will be likely
to have small pox or measles. In these diseases the cold-
water cure is very cfficacious; put your child, therefore,
under a pump, which you will probably find tautamount
to putting him under an apothecary,

GENERAL.-Now saunter by purling brooks, and smoke
meerschaums or make love, or do both (if permitted) in cool
arbours. Shoot sparrows in cherry-trees, and take every
thing as easy as you can. Doff coats and neckcloths,
and unbutton trousers after dinner; rest feet after the
American fashion, on chairs, and read novels. Eat your
cold lamb, and drink, if you can afford it, your Hock and
Clare—which ice.
VALUABLE REcipes.—For a Sorc Nose. Take a tumbler
of cold water, and drop in tallow from a rushlight. Lay a
little of the tallow on your finger, and rub in smartly
before going to bed.
AstronomicAL.—The moon will be visible at High Wy-
combe a quarter of an hour later than at Hockley-on-the-
Hole, and Jupiter will be over Stoke Pogis at the same
moment that Venus is exactly above the Waithman Obe-
lisk. Mars will attend regularly at the Horse Guards, and
Saturn will be visible in St. James's-street.
AN INDIAN PickLF.—Join the army in the East : and
having subjected yourself to a moderate quantity of the
native pepper, which is proverbially pretty hot, the result
will be a strong Indian pickle.
A DelicAte HAsh.--Take a French melo-drama—dilute
with a dictionary—lard with English idiom—spice with
buffoonery—and simmer down with sentiment. Serve it
out to a “ British audience,” and the delicate hash will
go down very pleasantly. r -
Medical.-Curr For Hydrophonia.-Against the regu.
lar disease there are several good antidotes: the following
prescription will answer as well as any. Take of prussic
acid four ounces, of extract of deadly nightshade, and of
extract of aconite, half an ounce, of arsenic in powder an
Qunce and a half. Mix, and drink down at one gulp. In a
few seconds the hydrophobia will be at an end.
Notes of the Month.-Zadkiel foretells destruction to
some aged Pier—probably that at Cremorne House, Chelsea,
which is the oldest on the river. St. Swithin is at length
regarded as a useless pump, the regular supply of water
being by no means certain. Rain may be looked for about
the 3d, 15th, and 27th days of this month; but it does not
follow that it will come in consequence. The Sun appears
in conjunction with Madame Tussaud's wax-work, and dis.
astrous events ensue. His rays threaten the Prince of
Wales, and affect the right arm of Burdett: let Sir Robert
Peel also beware
LEGAL HINTs.-In an action for fees a physician cannot
recover. In cases of illness the patients are often in the
same predicament.
On a bill or note the statute begins to run directly it is
due. The acceptor, if he cannot pay, had better follow the
statute's example.
Metronological—When the Stars look dim, rain may be
expected. When, therefore, the performances of Mr. Ma-
cready or Mr. Charles Kean appear rather dull, you may
look for a shower in the evening; it being supposed that
the expected rain which invariably causes a bad house,
produces the dimness of the Stars already alluded to.
It will be high water at Aldgate pump throughout the
year, and when the moon shines upon the handle, a com-
mon barometer will give the mean average. It will be low
water in the kitchens by the river side several times in tho
course of the year, and the mean depth may be ascertained
by walking into it. .

determined to outstrip all competition, has used the
greatest exertion, and given much attention to the sub-
ject, with the view of preparing a list of the Royal Family
ten years hence. The following may be depended on, as
being, if not quite correct, at least as nearly so as circum-
stances will admit of:-
Queen Victoria, born - - - - - 1819
Prince Albert . - - - . . 1819
Albert Edward, (Prince of Wales) . - . 1841
Victoria Adelaide, (Princess Royal) - . . 1842
Augustus Leopold, (Duke of Brompton) . . 1843
Sophia Maria - - - - - . . 1844
Elizabeth Leonora Jane . - - - . 1845
Henry Philip William, (Duke of Lambeth) . . 1846
Mary Alexandrina . - - - - . 1847
John Charles Peter, (Duke of Chelsea). . . 1848
Timothy Theobald Thomas, (Duke of Kensington) 1849
Matilda Seraphina . - - - - 1850
Richard Stephen, (Duke of Deptford) . . . 1851
Ethelred Guthrum, (Duke of Battersea) . . 1852
Seraphina Susan Cecilia - - - . . 1853
The above are, as nearly as we can give them, the ar-
rangements for the next ten years, of the Royal Family,
and the above table, may be looked upon as a sort of per-
petual calendar of information on the subject it embraces.
The returns are at present made up only to the year 1853,
but we may carry our calculations further on a future
occasion. The above will be thought by any reasonable
person enough for the present-
Mohal Reflection.—How delightful on a hot, broiling,
sultry morning, is a good plate of pickled salmon, with no
end of Chillivinegar and pepper, and a cool bottle of Guin-
ness's Dublin stout, or a draught of pale India ale!
Norrs of THE Month-Celestial sporting begins, and the
Stars take out their licences to shoot about the 9th. The
heat is still intense: the cream of Circassia feels its in-
fluence, as well as the grease of Russia. Sagittarius presides
over the targets of Tivoli, whilst from the aspect of a little
boy fishing for crabs at the extremity of the Margate Jetty,
the Son will probably come into conjunction with the right
limb of Cancer. The “Stars" of the Gravesend Company
may be seen from the observatory of Windmill Hill in
rapid transit on the River.
Legal Hints.-If a man makes a foolish bargain with
another, it is a simple contract.
Feigned issues may in some cases be pleaded. When
beggars borrow children to excite compassion, it may be
said that they are pleading a feigned issue.
ARMoRIAL BEARings.-The duty on Armorial Bearings
has been held not to apply to the men belonging to the
County Fire-office, who bear on their arms the celebrated
design in brasso relievo, of Britannia sitting on the sharp
edge of a shield, and making a rug of the hide of a living
lion. -
Mºnical.—Corn-cutters in August may expect plenty of
employment. The fair sex will be greatly afflicted with
summerfreckles, to which they may apply kalydor or cocoa-
nut oil, with nearly equal advantage: or if they prefer it,
may take a regular walk, beneath the harvest-moon; the
finest cosmetic in the world being moonshine.

Thoughts on The 20th of September-It is Michaelmas
Day. We shall have goose for dinner. What a beautiful
thing is roast goose, with apple sauce; and oh! with sage
and onions: How delightful the odour which, long before
the sweet bird is fully dressed, ascends from the regions of
the kitchen. Delicious fowl: it seems almost cannibalism
to eat thee.
Notes or The Month.-The astral illuminations of
Vauxhall are eclipsed by the pluvial inferences; and the
gardensoncemoreclose “forgood,” which, considering how
very often they have opened for bad, is but fair. Mr. Jones
again moves into the second house on the 29th, and all he -
sees of a goose on that day is the quill, with which he writes
a label to leave on his door “Back in an hour.” Desola-
tion broods over Smithfield on St. Bartholomew; but the
ingress of Aries and Taurus from the Continent counteracts
the deficiency.

To cut up A Goose—If any difficulty is experienced in
catching a goose, or nobody has cooked your own for you,
wait until the Marquis of Londonderry publishes a new
work. Then review it honestly, and you will have cut up
the goose. The sage will be very difficult to find.
Oyster Sauce for Taverns.—Take a go of thin gruel.
Heat it in a saucepan, and then add three raw oysters.
Serve in a butter boat, and garnish with a few blacks.
Sporting.—“Gents” are particularly recommended to
put the powder into their guns before the shot, and to with-
draw ramrods from barrels previously to firing. The first of $4
those directions may be reversed when the “Gents” form a
shooting party; which will beasure way to avoid accidents.
In this case, also, the removal of each other's percussion
caps, or the pouring of beer into flint locks, will be found
excellent sport, and likewise conduce to general safety. (2
N.B. Geese, ducks, and barn-door fowls may not be shot 2-M
without special licence from their proprietors.
LEGAL HINT-In an action of ejectment the outgoing Tu
party, who receives notice to quit behind his back, cannot
plead tender.
A parliamentary speech is not evidence, but a speech by
Mr. Ferrand is primd facie evidence of the exact contrary
of what it asserts.
Interest Table.—The table which is best adapted for
calculating interest is the dinner table. If you keep a good
one, the interest taken by your friends will be propor-
tionably large. A haunch of venison secures a very high
rate of interest, but the coupons from cold viands are
generally thought little of, and few people take the trouble
to come for the dividends. .
Lip Salve.—This is made by simmering together equal
quantities of deception and soft soap, with a portion of
essence of tin. Pour in a few drops of tincture of humbug
to flavour it, and strain through a cant sieve. It is excel-
lent to correct crudities of speech.
Bill Stamirs.-For a dishonoured bill returned upon
your hands, several stamps with your foot.
For a promissory note never intended to be paid, the
giver stamps himself as a cheat.
The acceptances of certain extravagant lords are to be
considered as securities of the very lowest stamp.
Astronomical.-The constellation Punch will dazzle the
world every Saturday, appearing first in wellington-street, .
and traversing the whole kingdom in the course of eight-
and-forty hours,

Notes for The Month.-Boisterous winds prevail, and
earthquakes are caused thereby in the mignonettegardens of
the thirdfloors, which are blown from their fastenings. The
aspect of the heavens enables us to foretellshipwrecks at the
Surrey Theatre: fires will be more frequent in the metro-
polis, and floods and inundations from neglected cisterns
may affect the kitchens of the North. Ceres passes into
Libra, and a penny loaf full weight is the result. Little
Britain is affected by tumults; and a denizen thereof being
run after by a mad bull, suddenly finds himself in the cusp
of the ascendant.
LEGAL HINT-A purchaser who cannot make up the
whole of the purchase-money, may in some cases go to the
Court for relief; at least if there happens to be a pawn-
broker's shop at the corner of it.
To calculark Nativities.—This is a troublesome pro-
cess, and requires much labour. Find out the hour and
minute of the day by the nearest clock, and if in a tavern,
what sign you are under. Then according to the time you
may have, walk through the streets and work out this
problem. As the knockers tied up in kid, are to the
monthly nurses at the second floor windows, so are the
births in the newspapers to the doctors' gigs at the doors.
Make friends with the district registrar, and inspect his
tables; and to this add the number of usually married men
who may be seen entering into the gay frivolities of life.
Caution is necessary to avoid calling too soon at the house
after the result; as it involves half a-crown to the nurse.
A Shorter Method.—Keep an account of the increasing
expenditure occasioned by your children: and, by looking
back, you will soon be enabled to calculate their nativities.
PRoPHETIc.—The conjunction of malt and hops this month
will be favourable to the concoction of beer. Many phea.
sants, but more rubbish, will be shot on the 1st. St.
Crispin's feast, otherwise Awl Saint's-day, will be cele-
brated on the 25th : on which occasion cobblers will" sew
themselves up.”
Purulic Offices.—Horse-Guards.-Sentries of the day,
Privates Snooks, Jones, Brown, Green, &c. Comptroller
of the Clock, Mr. Smith.
Civil Department.—Watcrimen at the Charing Cross Cab
stand, Dick Wiggins.
Woods and Forests.-Rangers of Hyde Park, Messrs.
Outatelbows, Seedy, Needy, Greedy, &c.
Powers of Attorney.—It is impossible to form any idea
of the power of an Attorney until you get completely within
his clutch. The expanding power of an Attorney is mani-
fested in the swelling of a bill of costs; and the condensing .
power is shown in shutting up defendants within the
limited precincts of a prison.
Pickles. A Good FAMILY Pickls.—Order in goods on
all sides from your tradesmen. Take the choicest viands
from your butcher, the best vegetables from your green-
grocer, and the most costly spices from your tea-dealer. *
Go on as long as you are able, mixing up in hot water, and
draining off in all directions as fast as you can. Repeat
this as often as possible, as you will soon find the result to
be a fine family pickle.
The Chops.-Manure with pomatum, and irrigate well
with Rowland's Macassar. Plough with a small-tooth
comb, and pull up by the roots all the grey hairs to be met S
with. Weed old whiskers and trim young moustachios,
with a view to a better crop, -

Allowance Fok. Witnesses.—There are several sorts of
allowance for witnesses. The chief allowance is that which
is to be got at the Exchequer Coffee-house. The following
is very near the scale:
A witness who will forget as
convenient . - - - A glass of grog.
A witness who will remember A mutton chop and grog at
things that never happened } discretion.
A witness who will keep out
of Court when called . .
A witness who will º: Nothing until the trial is
} Wine and beer ad libitum.
all the evidence on the other over, but wine and grog
side . - - - afterwards in proportion
to the verdict.
Among other allowance to witnesses is the allowance that
must be made for the prevarication of a lady who is asked
her age; and there are other allowances of a similar cha-
racter. On cross examination, witnesses come in for a very
large allowance of abuse from counsel.
To Canve. Poulthy.—Fowls have seldom more than two
wings. It is advisable, therefore, in carving them, to re-
men ber this. Help the particular guests to a wing or
bre, st; and when they are gone, it is good-breeding to ask
the unimportant people, “if they have a preference for any
part.”
AstronomicALPhenomenon for 1842—The Annual Eclipse
of the Sun by the fog on Lord Mayor's Day will take place
as usual on the 9th November.
Notes of the Month.-Strange phenomena mark the
fifth. Fiery stars and meteors appear, the air is shaken by
concussions and reports, and a celebrated character is
burnt at the stake. The influence of Venus on Virgo
tempts a young lady at a boarding-school to fly to Gretna
with her lover, who is tributary to Mars. A dark cloud
hangs over London—let the manufacturers put out their
fires, and avert the evil, which will pass away as smoke.
Post-office Regulations.—Letters to go the same day
must be put in by yourself: if entrusted to your servants
they will be forwarded the following one. Letters borrow-
ing money, or begging favours, generally miscarry, or
come to hand whilst the person they are sent to “is in the
country." Letters demanding payment of cash due, to be
returned to the writers, endorsed “Gone away—not known
where:" or forwarded from one place to another with “try
No. 14,” “no such name,” &c., until they get worn out or
illegible.
Population of the United Kingdom.–We have no
means of arriving exactly at the result, for the last census
made several omissions; amongst whom was our boy, who
did not go to bed at all on the night of the fifth of June,
1841, and consequently slept nowhere. Perhaps the best
means of ascertaining the population of the United King-
dom is to find the exact half, and having multiplied by
two, you will get the correct total. º
Agricultural Statistics.-It is calculated that the W.
Staffordshire Potteries turn out every year more than a 7.
million flower-pots. The mould inserted in these pots |
may be estimated at some thousand of cart-loads, which is
equal to several acres. Supposing that each hundred
flower pots on an average contains one rose-tree, this will
give a large number of perches (in the shape of pieces
of dead stick) to the metropolitan sparrows. The number
of daisies grown for London consumption (and they always
go into a consumption when they reach London) is not
ascertainable.

| Dºomaka was anciently so denominated from derem, ten. The
Romans might, if they had chosen, have called it a great many
- names on account of its dreariness and dulness besides—but it seeins
º they did not. Some assert that the Saxons (after their conversion to
Christianity) used to call it Guzzle-monath, on account of the libations
}:{EM}}}
in which they indulged at Christmas. Others maintain that they
entitled it Fun-monath, on account of the pantomimes and other
drolleries which accompanied that festive season. The sign of De-

INNs of Count.—The principal Inns of Court are the
Wrekin, Broad Court; The Cheshire Cheese, Wine-office
Court; The Feathers, Hand Court; and others. The
Terms here are as follows:-
“Two muttons to follow"—A couple of consecutive chops.
** One mixed." —A tumbler of hot punch.
“Coming, sir" —The flight of the waiter.
“Pint palale" —A bottle of Bass's Indian beer.
Cheap Hvonometsa.-A simple way to detect the pre-
sence of moisture on the surface of the earth, is to wear
boots with holes in the soles; or sit upon the ground out of
doors for two hours, and then calculate according to the
degree of Rheumatism to which you will rise.
Thansfer of Stocks may be effected at any respectable
cravat-sellers on any particular day, except Sunday, which
is kept as a holiday. A power of attorney is not necessary,
although it is often out of the power of attorneys’ clerks
to get a new stock. The transfer is generally made by the
payment of a certain sum and leaving the old one behind
to be re-covered, or because it is not worth taking away.
To make a Welch Rabbit-The simplest method is
that practised in our schools by little boys, which consists
in toasting a slice of yellow soap on a bit of slate over the
candle. Foreigners should ask for “Lapin du pays des
Galles,” to ensure the real animal, which arrives from
Wales to the London markets potted down in the form of
cheeses, to which it bears some resemblance in taste. It
is not necessary to take out a poulterer's license in order
to retail Welch rabbits, nor has the trade, in this parti-
cular article, been found as yet to suffer, from the tariff
rabbits which are sent from Ostend. The skins of the
welch rabbits are perfectly useless in a commercial point
of view; but are sometimes advantageously employed to
bait mouse-traps.
GARDENING-Take up crops of onions, carrot, and pars-
nips, if you have a garden; if you have not, it is better to
buy them at the nearest greengrocer's. The best time for
trees which grow near the road. Bring down apples which
overhang the highway, with stones and hooky sticks.
Notes of The Month.-The single ladies begin to wonder
what the next year will bring forth, and perhaps the
married ones do the same. A constellation of peculiar
brilliancy will appear towards the close of the panto-
mime; although at the beginning the conjunction of the
prompter's hand with the weather apparatus, betokens
storms of wind and rain. Christmas Day will fall this
year upon the 25th, as heretofore. Let Sir Robert Peel
beware, if he ventures on the ice before it bears, or he may
fall in.
Philosophical--When an estate is advertised to be sold
“without reserve,” it may be inferred that the auctioneer
will display more than the usual amount of impudence.
His assurance may in these cases be relied upon.
Equation, or Time.—Note—That a watch generally
goes much faster in a crowd than if it was left at home.
A clock goes down if it is not wound up; but if your
own affairs are approaching a wind-up instead, then it is
most likely that the watch or clock will “go up", watches
should be regulated by Sun Dials; but if none are handy,
then the mean time of the gin-shop clocks in Seven dials
will answer all the purpose. At the close of the theatres,

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
In T Roduction.
I AM a native of Africa; but my parent Ostrich having been hunted
down for the property he carried about with him, I was, many years
ago, shipped at the Cape of Good Hope for London; in which magni-
ficent city I have lived a life of many changes. On my arrival, I was
preferred to the house of a duke; there, I waved, and fluttered, and
tossed my head among the noblest of the land; and now—
But I will narrate my adventures in the order they befell me.
My duty to my parent demands that I should champion him against
the supercilious sneers of the world—that I should vindicate his
memory from the ignorant slander of mankind.
I will confess it, when, after a race of some fifty leagues, with the
horses close at my parent's tail—
“Cujus fui minima pars"—
(where, reader, I picked up my Latin, shall, in good time, be made
known to you,)—when I beheld my honoured sire thrust his head
into a bush, believing, as it was too plain he did, that because he
could not see himself, nobody could see him, I do confess, despite of
filial love, I felt a fluttering of indignation, not unalloyed—may I be
pardoned the sin —with contempt. The world has taught me better
wisdom. Experience hath made me tolerant. Since I have seen
men, praised, too, for their excelling prudence, commit the self-same
folly as my unfortunate sire, reproach has subsided into sorrow, and
contempt become ennobled by regret.
But I come of an outraged, a slandered race. What bouncing fibs
have been written of me, by sand-blind philosophers, and glibly
repeated by gossips of all sorts at their firesides! How venerable does
a lie become by length of years Truth is never a babe, and never
a hag. As at the first, so at the last : full-blown yet young; her
eyes lustrous through ages, and her lip ruddy and fresh as with the
dews of Eden: upon her brow sits an eternity of beauty. Now False-
hood is born a puling, roaring thing : its very infancy is anticipative
of its old age, and stamped with the grossness of mortality. Day by
day it waxes bigger and stronger; has increase of reputation, crowds
of clients; until at length, its unrighteous hoariness makes it wor-
shipped by multitudes for no other reason save this—it has gray
hairs. And so the wrinkled wizard keeps his court, and works his
mischief-dealing, paralysing spells, until Truth at some time turn her
Sapphire eyes full upon him, and as a bubble at a finger's touch, False-
hood is gone.
For thousands of years my ancestors have borne the weight of lies
upon their backs. And first, for the shameless scandal that the family
of Ostriches wanted the love which even with the wasp makes big
its parental heart towards its little ones :—
“The Ostrich, having laid her eggs, leaves them to be hatched by
the heat of the sun.”
Such is the wickedness that for tens of centuries has passed among
men for truth, reducing the ostrich to a level with those hollow-
hearted children of Adam, who leave their little ones to the mercies
of the world—to the dandling of chance—to the hard rearing of the
poor-house. There is Lord de Bowelless; he has a rent-roll of thou-
sands ; is a plumed and jewelled peer. Look at him in his robes;–
behold “law-maker” written on the broad tablet of his comprehen-
sive brow. He is in the House of Peers; the born protector of his
fellow-man. How the consciousness of high function sublimates his
nature | He looks, and speaks, and lays his hand upon his breast,
the invincible champion of all human suffering—all human truth.
Turn a moment from the peer, and look at yonder biped. There is
an old age of cunning cut and lined in the face of a mere youth. He
has counted some nineteen summers, yet is his soul wrinkled with
deceit. And wherefore Poor wretch His very birth brought
upon her who bore him abuse and infamy—his first wail was to his
mother's ear the world's audible reproach. He was shuffled off into
the world, a thing anyway to be forgotten, lost, got rid of. In his
very babihood, he was no more to men than the young lizard that
crawls upon a bank, and owes its nurture to the bounty of the ele-
ments. And so this hapless piece of human offal—this human ostrich
deserted in its very shell—was hatched by wrong and accident into
a thief, and there he stands, charged with the infamy of picking
pockets. The world taught him nothing wise or virtuous, and now,
most properly, will the world scourge him for his ignorance.
And thus, because Man, and Man alone, can with icy heart neglect
his little-ones—can leave them in the world's sandy desert to crawl
into life as best they may, because a Lord de Bowelless can suffer his
natural baby to be swaddled in a workhouse, to eat the pap of poor-
laws—to learn as it grows nothing but the readiest means of satisfy-
ing its physical instincts, because his Lordship can let his own boy
sneak, and wind, and filch through life, ending the life the peer did
him the deep wrong to bestow upon him, in Macquarrie Harbour,
because, forsooth, his Lordship is capable of all this, he must, in the
consciousness of his own depraved nature, libel the parental feelings
of the affectionate ostrich Oh, that the slander could perish and
for ever ! Oh, that I could pierce the lie to the heart; with a fea-
ther pierce it, though cased in the armour of forty centuries 1
Again, the Ostrich is libelled for his gluttony. Believe what is
said of him, and you would not trust him even in the Royal stables,
lest he should devour the very shoes from the feet of the horses.
Why, the Ostrich ought to be taken as the one emblem of temperance.
He lives and flourishes in the desert: his choicest food a bitter, spikey
shrub, with a few stones—for how rarely can he find iron, how few
the white days in which the poor Ostrich can, in Arabia Petraea, have
the luxury of a tenpenny nail, to season, as with salt, his vegetable
diet ! And yet common councilman Prawns, with face purple as the
purple grape, will call the Ostrich—glutton
For how many centuries did that stately rajah, the Elephant, move
about the earth, mankind all the while resolutely denying to him
the natural joints of his legs . Poor fellow ! although thousands and
thousands of times he must have knelt before men—going upon his
knees that his riders might tell the truth of him, they nevertheless
refused to him the power of bending. But the Elephant has become
a traveller—has condescended to eat cakes at a fair—has shown the
combined humility and magnanimity of his nature, by going on his
marrow-bones on the boards of a play-house, and the world has at
length passed a truthful sentence upon him. In the year 1843, the
Elephant has joints :
I have endeavoured, feebly enough I know, to vindicate the cha-
racter of the maligned ostrich. Let that pass. My purpose in the
following chapters—and whether I shall proceed to one or five
hundred chapters, is a doubt at present hidden in the mysterious
depths of a bottle of ink—is to tell what I have seen in my eventful,
ever-shifting existence, as a feather among men. An ostrich feather
Consider my mutations, and give courteous ear to my history !
A LOST PLAY.
It is an authentic anecdote of Hogarth, that he was wont to make
certain miniature sketches on his thumb-nail, to be elaborated at an after-
time. A certain dramatist followed the like practice. He would write a
plot in the same limited space, in short-hand. He was once consulted on
a new drama by a manager. “I have it,” exclaimed the ready artist ;
and he immediately marked the plot upon his thumb-nail. Weeks passed
over, but no play was presented. The manager waited on the author—
“Now, about the piece : It's done, of course ; you took it on your thumb-
nail?” “To be sure,” replied the author, “and there it was for some
time; but, as ill-luck would have it, I one morning unfortunately—washed
my hands !”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SIDE-SCENES OF EVERY-DAY SOCIETY.
cHAPTER I.-INTRODUCTORY.
“HERE we are again —How are you ?”—to adopt the style of the
present season.
Well, dear reader, the Christmas week has come and gone ; and
our holidays are at an end. By the liberality of those charitable
people, who take care that the inmates of workhouses, authors, and
other indigent classes of society, should enter into the customary
festivities of the period, we have feasted on beef, turkey, and goodly
brawn—we have drank the potent ale and comforting elder-wine of
the rural districts—we have gone with the holiday people to the
exhibitions, and felt a few returns of almost forgotten merriment, as
we listened to the glorious musical laughter of the children at the
pantomimes. And now, having trimmed our garret with small sprigs
of pearly mistletoe and bright-berried holly, we resume our pen and
slippers, and return to work, with a grateful retrospection of our
holiday, and a cheering anticipation of once more meeting you in our
columns.
To our subject then at once. Those of our good friends who have
been given to literary pursuits, and even those in whom we have
created a taste for reading, which they possessed not before, must
recollect that a long time back—two centuries and a half ago—in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth,a poet and dramatic author named Shakspere,
or Shakespeare, flourished at an obscure village in Warwickshire. He
appears at that remote period to have stood somewhat higher than
the other authors of his day, which, although verging upon the dark
ages of barbarism, now and then furnishes a proof that the scribblers
of the era understood something of human nature and language. It
is true that the plays written by the author we have just named
possessed little of the pathos or interest which abounds in the more
modern dramas of “Susan Hopley” and “My Poll and my Partner Joe.”
Many of them also had neither an incidental ballet, nor a combat º
six to enliven them, and consequently are now almost extinct : yet,
if any one will take the pains to look over them, if by chance an
edition comes in his way, he will find here and there flashes of imagi-
nation, and cleverly-turned sentences, which even dramatists of the
present day need not be ashamed to have written. This ancient
author, then, in one of his plays, has compared the world to a stage,
and the men and women who people it to the actors in a domestic
drama of seven tableaua, chequered with sad and comic scenes, like
the “Wreck Ashore,” or any other piece of the same class. Now,
to carry out still further the analogy between the world and a theatre
which this almost forgotten writer has adduced, we would say that
the world—which in the present instance we would have understood
as meaning society—has its side-scenes as well as the stage; and that
the performers who thereon “strut and fret their hour” (we borrow
from our author again) are as different before and behind the scenes,
as is the Monarch on the stage to the same Monarch drinking cold
brandy-and-water in his dressing-room between the acts.
However ignorant they may be of the writings of Shakspere,
possibly most of our readers are acquainted with “The Devil upon two
Sticks.” We do not mean the hourglass-shaped toy which is played
upon two sticks and a string, nor the ballet in which Duvernay
danced the Cachucha, and Wieland hopped about so quaintly and sat
upon the fire—but the excellent novel of Le Sage bearing that title,
wherein one Don Cleophas Leandro Perez Zambullo sees what is
going on in every house in Madrid, by the kindness of an eccentric
demon who removes the roofs.
He was here admitted to the side-scenes of which we wish to
speak: and we will just add, in reverting to the ballet, that had the
spirit possessed the power of uncovering the hearts of his audience
in the same manner as he lifted up the roofs of the houses, the stu-
dent would have beheld a much stranger sight than ever the scholar
of Alcala witnessed, with all the opportunities that his friend Asmo-
deus afforded him.
There is no denying the plain truth, that every action of the society
of the present day is as much involved in a covering of duplicity as
the date-stone-looking abode of a chrysalis silkworm is in the web of
yellow pluff which surrounds it; and thus the real object of any such
action is as difficult to discover as the actual commencement of the
aforesaid web. We have been cultivating this general deception for
some time past. It has been going on so rapidly that it must of
necessity soon arrive at its climax ; and then, when it can go no fur-
ther, as extremes meet, we shall most probably return again to truth.
At present, there is not a single event or action of our social lives,
however trifling, but is involved in a mesh of deceit ; sometimes seen
through as easily as is the amber which envelops the flies, but more
frequently as dense and impenetrable as the hide of a wild-boar.
Par eremple.—A lady sends an invitation to a person she cannot
bear, but whom she is compelled to be polite to from motives of inter-
est or connexion : she requests, openly, “the pleasure of his com-
pany”—she hopes fervently, behind the scenes, that he will not come.
A physician salutes his victim with “I hope you are well;” when it
would, much, delight him to see the unhappy person's frame
quivering with the rapid vibrations of intermittent fever, and betray-
ing evidence of the commencement of some tedious chronic complaint.
The mistress of the house, at a dinner party, is “unconscious” of the
contents of a neighbouring “spring tart”—a name which the professors
of the fiddle-faddle school of fashion have given to a small rhubarb-pie,
in the early stages of that plant's existence, to impress you with a due
notion of its premature delicacy. Now, behind the scenes, the cook was
over-done with work, and the lady ordered the rhubarbto be sent to her
in the drawing-room, whereshecutit up with her own hands. Andby the
way, what a poor dash of conventional style it is, to call the piece of
confectionery just mentioned “spring tart.” It is as much as to say
to your guests (and it means it too), “Rhubarb is very dear now, so
you must think a great deal of this, and not cram it down as if it was
apple-pie.” We perceive we have committed an error. “Tarts are
made of fruit, pies of meat,” was an axiom instilled into us by our
schoolmistress at an early age, and we fancy, reader, that you are now
chiding us for not paying attention to it. We plead guilty, with most
willing readiness; but still an apple-pie will be an apple-pie to the end
of the world. There might justly be room for censure in speaking of
a beefsteak tart; but with the other, we maintain it will never be
anything else, whilst the legend that so inseparably connects the
letters of the alphabet with its being, and their contest for its posses-
sion, shall exist, from the humblest halfpenny edition to the glowing
shadows of the phantasmagoria.
We propose, in the sketches we are about to lay before you, to
give you a free admission of some of the minor, but not less popular,
theatres of society; where you may possibly find as much diversion
and matter to amuse you, as you would do before the curtain. The
great houses we shall leave alone. We would not soar too high, lest
in our imaginings we should tumble out of the cloud-pieces upon the
stage, or perhaps underneath it, through an open trap-door, and be
thought no more of ; or not being sufficiently acquainted with the
extensive machinery, we may be unable to grapple with its difficulties,
and thus cause the failure of the piece, from a similar fault in life
that * many originally good plans to miscarry, attempting too
Illucil.
Stage-door keepers are renowned for being people of peculiarly surly
and discourteous bearing; but we shall endeavour to conduct our-
selyes with all due politeness and propriety, that through us and our
colleagues you may look with favourable eyes upon the management
of our establishment, to secure a good name for which all our efforts
tend, and upon the success of which undertaking our situations and
salaries depend.
PUNCII’S “COURT CIRCULAR.”
ON Wednesday night, her Majesty the Queen and his Royal High-
ness Prince Albert, with a numerous suite, honoured Drury Lane
Theatre with a state visit. The pieces played were a new comedy,
called Better Late than Nerer, The Illustrious Stranger, and the panto-
mime. Her Majesty appeared to be highly delighted with the enter-
tainments. . The audience were very enthusiastic, and evidently ap-
preciated the praiseworthy condescension of our beloved Queen,
who, by thus personally patronising the dramatic literature of Eng-
land, may in a great degree make it endurable by the “fashionable
classes.” We understand that, with this benevolent intention, her
Majesty will pay a state visit to one of the three theatres—namely
Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and the Haymarket, at least once a
fortnight. Punch will be at his post, and duly report proceedings.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FRENCH SENTIMENT.
T is not often that Purch
has occasion to praise foreign
sincerity, but the following
extracts are so brimful of
it—so free from that vile
sycophancy which disfigures
the English character, — so
touching in their appeal, and
so winning in their sym-
pathy, that he cannot help
holding them up to the ad-
miration of his readers as a
perfect specimen of real good
feeling ! A Frenchman alone
could have written it.
We borrow at random
from a long article that
graced the feuilleton of the
Sircle a week or two back. The happiness of our extracts
will show the pleasure we have taken in this exhilarating task. But
we will let Mr. ALExANDRE DUMAs speak for himself. He is talking |
of the funeral of the Duke of Orleans, and says:–
“One would have said that this poor prince was not only the hope
of France, but also the Messiah of the whole world.”
The following extract, however, far exceeds the above by its homeli-
ness and great sensibility of feeling:—
“There was in the voice of the Duke of Orleans, in his smile, in
his look, quite a magnetic charm which fascinated ererybody. I have never
observed in anybody-not even in the most seductive female—anything
which equalled this look, this smile, this roice.”f
Could Wordsworth have written anything more feelingly Our
next extract shows the love of truth Mr. Alexandre Dumas cherishes,
to the sacrifice of everything like rhapsody and adulation :-
“There were centred in him too many things emanating from God;
his virtues imporarished the kingdom of heaven. The Almighty has called
him away, and now the earth is in mourning for the loss of his virtuest. ...?
- The fearless honesty of expression displayed in the above passage,
is sufficient to stamp Mr. Alexandre Dumas as the first biographer
of the day. The following, for its enthusiasm and sincerity, is not
less worthy of admiration —
“From the tribune where I was standing, I could see the coffin but
indistinctly. I would have given, I will not say money, but several
years of my very life, to have thrown myself on my knees before that
catafalque, to hare kissed that coffin, to have cut away a small fragment of
the relret which corered it $.”
..With regret we leave this affecting subject. The extracts we have
given are but as glass-beads compared to the many peerless gems
the article is studded with. We give just one more, which, we think,
is of the highest water.
“On leaving the church, there was a moment of confusion, and I
found myself placed between the bronze urn which enclosed the
heart, and the leaden coffin which contained the body.
“Both of them touched me as they passed. One would have said
that both heart and body wished to say to me a last farewell. I thought I should
Mare fainted 1 . . Just four years since, at the very same hour, I had put
on mourning for my mother!] . . . . ||”
What could be more free from affectation With the beauty of
this last passage still dwelling on our minds we take our leave of Mr.
Alexandre Dumas, thanking him for the sincere pleasure we have
derived from his admirable exposition of French sentiment
* As some of our readers might imagine we are awarding to Mr. Alexandre Dumas
praise that is not legitimately due to him, we guard against any such supposition, by
iving the original extracts:—“On eat dit que le pauvre prince qui venait de mourir
tait non-seulement l'espºir de la France, mais le Messie du monde entier.”
t “Il y avait, dans la voix du duc d'Orléans, dans son sourire, son regard, un
charme magnétique qui fascinait. Je n'ai Jamais retrouvé chez personne, meme
chez la femme la plus séduisante, rien qui ne rapprochát de ce regard, de ce sourire,
de cette voix.”
t Il y avait en lui trop de choses venant de Dieu; ses vertus appauvrissaient le
ciel. nea l'a repris avec ses vertus, et maintenant c’est la terre qui en est
veuve
$ “De la tribune oth j'étais (à la cathédrale), je voyais imparfaitement le cercueil;
J'aurais donné, je ne dirais pas de l'argent, mais des années de ma proprevie, pour
aller m'agenouiller devant ce catafalque, pour baiser ce cercueil, pour couper un
morceau du velours qui le couvrait.”
“ En sortant de l'église, il y eut un moment d'embarras, et je me trouvai pris
entre l'urne de bronze qui contemait le coeur et le cercueil deplomb qui renfermait
le cadavre.
“Tous deux me touchèrent en passant. On eat dit que coeur et cadavre voulaient
me dire undernier adieu. Je crusque j'allais m'évanouir!.... Il y avait juste quatre
ans, a pareille heure, que j'avais mené le deuil dema mère! . . . .”—Fºuilleron Du

CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES.
MR. Snow gave a grand dinner on Christmas-day to the whole of his
tenantry, consisting of his second-floor single young man lodger, and the
occupants of the attics. Covers were laid for three, and both flaps of the
Pembroke table were put up, so as to afford sufficient space for setting out
the courses. The fare consisted of two of the delicacies of the season—
namely, roast beef and potatoes. After the cloth, was removed, Non
Nobis was given in fine style by the second-floor lodger, and after the
usual loyal toasts the front attic gave the beautiful melody, “My lodging
is on the cold ground,” with great truth and finish. The back attic pro-
posed the health of Mr. Snow, their worthy landlord.
Air—All Round my Hat.
Mr. Snow declared it was the happiest moment (but twenty-five) of his
whole existence. He was glad to be surrounded by his tenantry (hear),
and he hoped to see them often on the same three chairs (three cheers).
Here Mr. Snow broke down, and the meeting broke up, and the bottle
was locked up and put away in the cupboard.
Overture—The Ruler of the Spirits. By Mr. Snow, in the key of B(e)
Sharp.
FASHIONS FOR JANUARY.
The waistcoats after Christmas are expected to be full, but the pockets
are usually empty. There was considerable lightness in the arrangements
for the head, especially in the streets on boxing-night, and much spirit
was evident among those who moved in their own peculiar circles. In
some instances the coat was brought down horizontally, so as to lie level
with the pavement, and the hat was worn a good way off the head, while the
watch and pocket-handkerchief were left completely dégagé. The coats,
which were cut away a good deal last year, are not now seen, the wearers
having cut away themselves; and in boots there is nothing new, those of
last year having had such a run that it is impossible to come up with
them. In trousers the twelve-shilling Swedish are still the favourites.
They are worn rather white at the knee, and are more or less shot with
mud about the calves and ankles.
PUNCH'S “ PANTOMIME.”
DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY LORD BROUGHAM
AND WAU X.
MY DEAR Lond,-A great original idea is like an acorn; it takes
at least a hundred years to become a mighty presence in the eyes of
men. What a small matter it is—a thing to be hidden in a girl's
thimble 1 and yet it has in its potentiality a forest of oaks—yea, an
ungrown, unbuilt armada.
My pantomime—Punch's Pantomime—which cast a glory on the
departing skirts of 1842, is a great original idea. Mr. Manager Bart-
ley says it is not ; never mind that—I say it is. In this belief—in
the invincibility of this conviction—I dedicate the Pantomime to you.
What says Lord Bacon, dedicating his great work to that solemn
noodle, James the First Namely, that by such dedication, he ad-
vances his labour at least a hundred years. He obtains even from
the prejudices of men a more attentive hearing, seeing that the
king “delights to honour” wisdom—that he graciously wraps a rag
of the imperial purple around the shivering carcase of porera e nuda
Here, my dear Lord, you will perceive I copy the “Chan-
cellor of human nature.” What BAcon was to JAMEs, Punch is to
Brough AM
You will concede, my dear Lord, that my Pantomime has peculiar
claims on your protection. It is not a merely mechanical pantomime
—a thing of spring-wire and pulley; but a pantomime of thought.
It is in its nature essentially subtle, and therefore it instinctively
flies to you as its natural guardian.
The age, however, is not yet fit for Punch's Pantomime. I have, in
some degree, abased myself to the shallow ignorance of present
times in the great work (to be seen every night at half-price) on
Covent Garden boards. I have suffered myself to make certain com-
promises with the prejudices of men, and, I feel it, have not yet fully
asserted my notions of the true character—the wit, the wisdom, the
profound, and almost tragic speculations—of the theme. Harlequin to
vulgar apprehension is a mere fantastic piece of patchwork, dancing
without motive—producing change and change with not the barest
reference to the “moral fitness” of the transformation. Clown is
simply a blackguard (Southey has made the word classical) and a
thief: Pantaloon a compound of asthma and rheumatism. How dif-
ferently does Punch contemplate the capabilities of the trio how is
he confirmed in the faith, and exalted by the idea, that the boxing-
night will come, when Harlequin shall indicate great moral meaning
in the rocking-step, nor roll his head round and round, without have

ing at least something in it. The Clown shall steal with an eye to
practical philosophy, and Pantaloon make gray heads grayer still with
unexpected wisdom. Columbine herself shall be a sort of Aspasia to
the galleries—a young and blooming schoolmistress to the million, in
variegated satin. Punch is as confiding in the advent of this true
philosophy of pantomime, as was his late mighty friend Bacon in
the ultimate success of the Norum Organum. BAcon said, “I stand
upon the shoulders of time, and look into futurity.” Punch, in the
like prophetic spirit says, “I stand upon the shoulders of Harlequin,
and look abroad into pantomimes to come.”
Albeit my present Pantomime—thanks to my weak concessions to
the erring million—is far from perfect, still a great step has been
taken. I feel that with my so potent bàton I have dealt a heavy
blow at the mere carpentry and mechanism of pantomime: and that
henceforth there must be a moral presence in the work...Twill not
be enough to change a sentry-box into Westminster Abbey :-no,
not there must be a meaning in the transformation, or it will be
nought. People will one day go to read a pantomime, not merely to
stare at it.
I am aware, that if Punch's pantomimic philosophy had to elbow
its own way through generations, it would not arrive at its destined
seat of honour until i850; but you, my dear Lord-I speak with a
knowledge of your old benevolence, with a faith in the friendship you
have ever shown to Punch,-you will graciously advance to meet the
struggling novelty, and holding forth your comforting and sustaining
hand, will clear out of its way at least half-a-century. This you will
do : if not, as sweet Lady Percy saith—
“I’ll break your little finger, Hal.”

My dear Lord, such werethe feelings of Punch on the 26th ult.—10–
P. M., the curtain then rising upon Punch's Pantomime. I shall not here
dwell upon the glories of the Magi the GRIEves, but drop a tear
to think that such painting should ever be painted out ; that it should
not be carried away as cabinet art to the gallery of the Titans. In
scene the second I began to perspire—a little; just enough to prove
my mortality. I must, too, own that I was greatly struck with the
respect for Punch that seemed to possess the audience on two or three
occasions. Where, in the ignorance of my soul, I had expected to
be greeted with horse-laughs, I met with merely a benevolent titter.
One of my dearest friends, basking in the expected glory of Punch,
sat radiantly smiling in the front of my box. After a while he looked a
little anxious ; and then, as if some vague thoughts of ancient eggs
and over-ripe apples came upon him, shudderingly withdrew into
the dark recesses of the nook. Another, and most philosophic friend
—let me drop a tear on human weakness—also withdrew into the
rear; but, with a latent thought of the Stoics, returned to his seat,
still adorning the front row with his short hair and massive brow—
a brow, spacious as Kennington Oval (and in some places quite as
| green).
But let me—thou worthy son of ancient martyrdom l—let me
dedicate one exclusive paragraph to thy virtue ! Thou didst take thy
seat in the front, confidently yet unostentatiously. The excelling
whiteness of thy tie sweetly typified the innocence of thy intentions:
thou didst seem expressly “got up” for a triumph. With what
calmness—what dignity—didst thou reprove the large-browed philo-
sopher and our fair-haired friend I Hadst thou been wrinkled by
hisses—thy cuticle corrugated like an elephant's, by the damnatory
breath of “a discerning public,” thou couldst not have sat more com-
pletely armed against the worst. “Sweet are the uses of adversity 1"
As for myself, my Lord, there is no sheet of paper big enough to
I was, of course, present—deep in the sanctity of a private box-
on the night of the 26th ult. You know what it is to make a maiden
speech in the Commons Fiddle-de-dee Nothing ; only try a maiden
pantomime at Covent Garden. I am convinced, that had I been
weighed when I left the box—as they weigh jockies reeking from the
sadāle—I had been found to have lost by perspiration at least three
stone. I was so changed, that when I returned home, the wife of
my bosom hardly knew my nose again; my very hump had sunk
more than “the altitude of a chopine.”
(—You were about to interrupt me, my Lord. Thank you for all
intended inquiries; I am now quite myself again.) -
Well, my Lord, there I was in my box, with the house roaring
about me ! The comedy was finished (some of it very much finished
indeed), and the fiddlers struck up the overture. In that terrible
moment, it seemed that by some diabolic spell, every petty nerve in
my body was turned into a fiddle-string; the larger vessels into
flutes, clarionets, bassoons, trumpets, and pistons-à-cornet; whilst some
fearful fiend beat—beat—beat the big drum upon my rebounding
heart. I tried to take a view of the audience. What a mass of
heads in gallery and pit ! I looked, endeavouring to catch the general
expression of my jury. I looked and looked, and wondered if
some of them could by any possibility be the individuals alluded to
when people spoke of “a discerning and intelligent public." The
overture ceased ; the curtain gave signs of rising; the–
My dear Lord, in your many sea-voyages, do you recollect your strug-
gles with nausea; your heroic attempts to remain perfectly well; and
hold the description of my feelings. I walked the box like a wild
beast—I tore my hair—I put my handkerchief in my mouth, and in
a spasm of indignation at public ignorance (one of my finest things
had fallen on an intelligent audience dead as an oyster), swallowed
the cambric.
My dear Lord, should you ever write a play, take with you into your
private box at least a pint of shrimps. Then you will not have, what
too often (thanks to the actors () happens,—i. e., an entertainment
without head or tail l
The pantomime proceeded to its close, and though bouquets studded
with diamonds were not thrown to Punch, the pantomimic principles
of Punch were triumphant. It was my aim to instruct; and I yet
hope the time will come, when the intelligent people of the British
Empire will call that the noblest pantomime, which may be witnessed
without a single smile—which may send the audience comfortably to
their beds, making them rise on the morning “wiser,” yes, and
“sadder” individuals.
That you, my Lord, have so handsomely consented to this dedica-
tion, proves to me the truth of my principles, assures me of their
ultimate triumph.
I have the honour to be,
My dear Lord,
Your friend and admirer,

BRITISH BALLADS.
No. 1.-SIR WINI FRED WILLIBALD WALTER WHITE.
IR Winifred Willibald Walter White
Was a yeoman, grim and bold;
There ne'er did live more stalwart
knight,
In England, New or Old.
A bonnet of goodly steel he wore,
A brighter none could find ;
And the hilt of his sword stuck out
before,
While the point stuck out behind.
* Sir Winifred Willibald Walter White
Did love a high-born dame ;
And whether 'twas morning, noon,
or night,
His heart was always the same.
So he sent a Page to the castle gate
Where the dame did dwell (God wot);
And he bade the faithful urchin wait
For an answer on the spot.
The lady, she was rich and fair,
And tall and portly too ;
So she eyed the Page with disdainful air,
Saying, “Save us! Who are you?”
And the little Page, in a sudden fright,
Did timidly reply,
“I come from Sir Winifred Willibald White,
And his faithful Page am I.”
“Go to, go to 1” said the high-born dame,
“I love a bolder knight and a betterer
Than he that bears the ugly name
Of Winifred Willibald Walter et cattera.”
So the Page, like a hunted fawn, flew back,
And his message told to the stalwart knight;
Oh, never did yeoman look half so black
As Sir Winifred Willibald Walter White l
He gave a stamp, and he gave a roar,
Then his Roman nose in the air did toss;
Oh, quotha, how he raved and swore
While the little Page his breast did cross.
He roll'd his eye to the left and the right,
And he look'd at his quaking Page–
Gramercy the bold and stalwart knight
Is in a thundering rage.
He call'd for his helmet thick and strong,
Of quaintly-figured metal ;
And seizing his falchion, six feet long,
“My rival,” quoth he, “I’ll settle 1"
So he sought him east, and sought him west,
And sought him north and south,
And swore till he found him he'd never rest,
Nor a morsel take in his mouth.
He went with a hop, and he went with a bound,
And he went with a loud halloo !
And the valleys and mountains echoing round,
Seem’d roaring and bellowing too.
He came to an old baronial hall,
In an ivy-eaten state ;
And he plunged through a hole in the crumbling wall,
For he could not find the gate.
In the court-yard he raved and stamp'd and cried,
Till an aged menial came,
Who, when the stalwart knight he spied,
Said—“Gallant Sir Yeoman, thy name f"
But the old retainer got no reply
From the brave and valiant knight—
Except a tremendous crack in the eye
From Sir Winifred Willibald White.
“Thy master,”—quoth he, “to see I would fain”——
And the valiant knight did frown;
Then smote the old menial thrice again,
Kicking him eke when down.
DESCENDED FROM THE CONQUERO-
Sir Winifred Willibald Walter White
To the winds did roar and howl,
When a figure came upon his sight
In a friar's robe and cowl.
“Gramercy, good father,”—the knight did cryº-
“My .# came to find;
Then count thy beads and tell my why
I am left to howl to the wind.”
But the friar from beneath his gown
Did draw a falchion bright-
“Thy rival am I,”—said her—and struck down
Sir Winifred Willibald White.
To the earth the stalwart yeoman fell’d,
The ground with his fingers pick'd,
Gramercy, how he roared and yell'd
While the dust his hot tongue lick'd.
And there in the court-yard he was laid
Until the approach of night,
When a hole was dug, and no fuss was made,
Pitch'd in was Walter White.
And over the grave a stone they raised,
And his epitaph did write:
“Here lies—(for the riddance goodness be praised)-
Sir Winifred Willibald Walter White.”
THE MARKETS.
Apples were freely offered on the Duke of York's Steps, at a halfpenny
the large handful, and pies (made of tariff meat) were so little in demand,
that the holders were obliged to resort to the tossing system, in order to
get rid of them. This shows an unhealthiness in the market, and is evi-
|dence of a frightful decline in the public appetite.
The toffy treacle continues dull, but the real Everton, which was ne-
glected for a time by the dealers, was caught up with some eagerness by a
party whose transactions are all of the same hazardous and enterprising
character.

The new tariff has had a good effect upon the itinerant sandwich trade,
and a good deal is now done in this popular luxury. Baked potatoes, with
the coupons to insert the butter, were freely offered at old rates, and a
great deal was done in cat's meat, at the former quotations. Dealers who
had been steady in the morning, and kept up through the day, came down
at night, and there was a frightful fall of various kinds of merchandise in
different quarters.
The news from Barcelona had not the expected effect on nuts, which
maintained their old prices. If Espartero should eventually triumph, and
Spain become tranquil, there is no saying what effect it may produce on
Spanish licorice.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
cHAPTER. I.-cos MOGOn Y.
OUNTING many ages back,
there was a time when the
Universe was all higgledy-pig-
gledy. This was about five
thousand years before Britain
began to rule the waves—and
there were then no waves to
rule—or if there were, they
were altogether unruly; for
as yet the sea was not, for the
best of reasons—namely, be-
cause there was no land. The
azure firmament too, was, in a
popular sense, “all my eye”.
The state of the Universe at
this period was called Chaos.
Imagine saucepans, sea-
weed, obelisks and allspice,
- º tomatoes, tomahawks, cata-
9racts and horsehair, gunpowder, lobster-sauce, stalactites
and boot-jacks, fire-drakes, whirligigs, squibs, water-
spouts and gongs, cyanogen, soojie, mountains, magpies,
earthquakes, oyster-patties, spermaceti and thimbles,
soap cerate, adamant, granite and tobacco, molasses,
maggots, tenterhooks and tripe, rocks, glaciers, rattle-
snakes, tongs, pig-tails, whistle-pipes and thunder—with
hot, cold, moist, dry, sweet, sour, sharp, flat, and all
sorts of contending opposites, including several tom-
cats, jostling, clanging, whizzing, clashing, hissing, flaring,
spurting, bellowing, and caterwauling; and you will have
n some faint idea of what Chaos may have been.
Or fancy an infinity multiplied by itself of lunatic asylums, schools
in an uproar, camp-meetings, and Chartist mobs, with ten times that
number of mad bulls, blown by as many exploding powder-mills into
“an immortal smash;” and your conception of the chaotic state may
perhaps be slightly assisted.
Whether Chaos was the wreck of a former system or not, tradition
does not tell us. If it was, the additions of certain skeletons of
mammoths and ichthyosauri to the above clanjamphries will render
them no improbable representations of it.
Now Chaos was the domain of Chaos of that ilk, from whom the
McKays of Scotland claim, it is said, to be descended. This Chaos
was the oldest of the Gods; though some say he was the offspring of
Necessity, and consequently the brother of Invention. They further
maintain, that Necessity set Invention to work to reduce Chaos to
order, which is probable enough—but how do they prove it Let us
keep to classical authority.
The dominion of Chaos (which was an unlimited Anarchy) was
shared with his wife, Darkness. By this lady he had a son called
Erebus, and a daughter whose name was Nox. Nox, be it observed,
must not be confounded with Niz; an appellation which signifies
nonentity, and was given to a supposed predecessor of Chaos by some
paradoxical speculators.
In process of time Nox and Erebus fell in love, and, as a natural
consequence of that accident, were married. These deities were
blessed with a large family, whereof the principal members were
the God of the Day, or Light, and the three Fates.
As soon as Day came into existence, he made a survey of Chaos,
his grandfather's estate, and instantly saw, as the saying is, what
was up. He complained to his mother and father of the state of
things; but Erebus told him not to grumble or he would lock him up
in the cellar; and Nox declared that if he said another word, she
would put him out. It is said that hereupon Day first “took a sight”
at his parents; but he had offered them that insult long before—pro-
voked to it by their black, cross, sulky looks. He replied not to their
threats, but, mentally ejaculating an expression of disgust, deter-
mined to put the Universe to rights before he closed.
Accordingly he summoned up his best looks and went and popped
the question to the eldest of the three Fates, his sisters. She not
only accepted his hand, but declared that she had long destined him
for her husband. So they were married; whereabouts it is not ex-
actly known; for the topography of Chaos is involved in perplexity.
This step was against the consent of the old folks, who refused to
see them, and also fell out with the two other Fates for having aided,
abetted, and comforted their brother and sister. Day and the Fates
now naturally made common cause ; and they soon found means to
gain over the remaining children of Erebus and Nox to theirown party.
Day and his partner (not Day and Martin) had a son and daughter,
so to speak, in no time. The son's name was Uranus : that of the
daughter, Terra. Gods are born in a state of maturity; so that it was
not long before Day and the Fates, with Uranus and Terra, who
were all warmly attached to one another, were enabled to act in
concert.
The first thing they did was to seize on the property of old Chaos,
upon pretence of his being a lunatic, and incapable of managing his
own affairs.
non compos Mentis.
It will readily be conceived that Chaos did not like this proceeding
at all, and that he accordingly resisted it with all his might. He
was seconded by his wife Darkness, and by Erebus, his son. Nox,
from interested motives as it is supposed, thinking perhaps to come
in for a share of the property, stood neuter.
The law of the Gods being the law of the strongest, the legal pro:
ceedings to which the parties had recourse were a mere trial of
strength. The contest ended in the defeat of Chaos. He was seized,
and together with his son Erebus, who was voted as mad as himself,
consigned to a sort of Bedlam, which was built on purpose for theim
in a place afterwards called the Infernal Regions.
Day, with his wife and sisters, having now obtained possession of
the Universe, set forthwith to work to put it to rights. They raked
together a lot of materials—to wit: coal, limestone, slate, granite,
grauwacke, gritstone, gypsum, toadstone, alluvion, sandstone, gold,
silver, platinum, lead, copper, tin, molybdenum, tungsten, diamouds,
emeralds, amethysts, rubies, sulphur, boron, phosphorus, oxygen,
hydrogen, and many other things of the above and different kinds—
with all of which they mixed up a quantity of water, which Nox
got by condensing the aqueous vapour which had been diffused
throughout Chaos. They then kneaded and rolled the whole mass
into balls, and thus made the heavenly bodies and the earth, into
which they inspired a quantity of electric fluid, and so set them
spinning. But they are said to have made the sun out of an enor-
mous carbuncle, to have composed the moon principally of silver,
and some of the stars of pure diamond.
The earth, however, was the peculiar object of their care. They
compounded it of all the ingredients that the chaotic rubbish afforded
them. It was the plum-pudding of creation. They divided it into
land and sea; interspersed it with mountains and valleys; and finally
surrounded it with an atmosphere, “just,” as Momus (one of the nu-
merous children of Nox) remarked, “in order to give it an air.”
Having thus formed the terrestrial globe, they allotted it to Terra;
her husband Uranus receiving for his especial domain the regions of
space in general. Already Terra had become the happy mother of
numerous gods, including Oceanus, who was installed Lord of the
Sea. She now brought forth vegetables, next animals, after
them, Man;
“And then she made the lasses, O.”
Night and her son Day undertook to watch over the earth conjointly
for their daughter Terra. Several subaltern divinities were appointed to
various employments in the administration of mundane affairs. Oceanus,
who had formed a matrimonial alliance with his sister Tethys, begat
the River Gods and the pretty Oceanides—whose offices were at the
heads of streams and in the coral caves of the dark blue sea, where
they transacted business, which they mixed with no little pleasure.
Those airy grandsons of Terra, the Winds, were appointed to their
respective quarters. Of these the most pleasant one was conferred
on Zephyrus, who had become enamoured of a charming young lady
called Flora, had made a goddess—a real one—of her, and had mar-
ried her. His delightful task was to tend spring flowers, and waft
perfume to the nostrils of immortals and of men. Her lovely Hama-
dryades were appointed by Terra to posts, that is to say, trees, in the
merry greenwood. To the blushing Aurora, her golden-haired

daughter, was assigned the morn, with a beautiful rose-coloured four-
in-hand, wherein she drove daily to open its gates, which was her
“limited service.” Subordinate situations were entrusted to Nymphs,
Satyrs, Fauns, and various other deities. Thus originated this sub-
lunary scheine of things. Oh ’twas a merry world; nothing but
basking in the sunshine, dancing in the shade, eating grapes and figs,
drinking celestial liquor, and continually making love. We shall
never see such times again
So much for the Cosmogony. By some anonymous poet a different
account of it has been given, which, though it cannot be depended
upon, deserves to be quoted for its brevity—
“Nine tailors make a man,
That's how the world began,
So the proud tailor went prancing away.”

REFLECTIONS ON THE CHARACTER OF WOMAN.
Woman was made for man—as the sun was made for the world—to
adorn and cheer it. But for woman, where would be the luxuriance with
which the spring of youth and the summer of manhood are adorned by
the cunning of the tailor! As soon would the sunless field be green and
* as man without woman.
he hand of man is formed to guide the plough, to ply the oar, to wield
the sword. The more delicate fingers of woman are calculated for the
dexterities of the sempstress—for the neatnesses of the culinary art.
When we survey our wristbands, how striking is our conviction of the
debt which we owe to womanhood . The constitution of the universe is
such, that buttons are necessary to shirts, unless studs are substituted for
them—an expense to which the vast bulk of mankind are unable to go.
Such, too, are the laws which regulate the material world, that these
buttons are liable at times to come off. The clumsy male fist would make
poor work of the delicate process of sewing them on again, which feminine
skill effects with nicety and despatch, leaving on the unrumpled and
unsmirched surface of the snowy Irish no trace where the thumbs have been.
But even if masculine adroitness were competent to replace a button,
how could those solutions of continuity, which occur as a consequence
of friction about the toes and heels of stockings, be repaired P Instances,
it is true, have been known of old bachelors who were wont to darn their
own hose ; but these are isolated exceptions. Were we of the sterner sex
deft enough, in general, for this employment, the impatience of our more
irritable natures would consign, in most cases, our half-finished haudiwork
to the flames.
The husband, occupied with his counting-house, his office, his shop,
| his clients, his patients, could not, although he were qualified so to do,
superintend the economy of the kitchen.
But to the man of leisure, the
garden, the tool-house, the field, present appropriate objects of amusement.
While the sportsman is levelling the gun, his wife at home is wielding the
rolling-pin ; and the jam-pudding that crowns his meal is the offering of
female assiduity to the palate of reciprocal affection.
Owing to its physiological relations to the external world, the nervous
system of the infant is peculiarly susceptible of irritation from the ap-
plication of moisture to the skin. The daily removal, however, of the
incrustations which would otherwise accumulate on its surface is ne-
cessitated by the requisitions of health. In other words, children ought to
be washed every morning, and they have at the same time a great objection
to being so. This infantile hydrophobia is productive, as all domesticated
“wanted—a governess.”
people know, of much screaming and crying. The innate ferocity of
savage man would be excited by this noise; and failing in trying to stop the
mouth of the suckling with his handkerchief, he would probably dash its
head against the wall. But the screams of the suffering little one excite,
not rage, but tenderness and compassion in woman's gentle breast; and
with soothing voice and soft caress, she beguiles the vociferous darling
into acquiescence and quiet.
When we reflect on the multifarious comforts and conveniences—the
clean linen, the hemmed handkerchief, the mended glove, the tidy house,
the comfortable cup of tea, the savoury patty, the pretty tune, the nice
glass of grog, and the thousand other blessings which are derived from
and centre in “Woman,” we are forcibly struck with the propriety of that
toast which, in all well-regulated societies, is never omitted after dinner-
“The LADIEs 1”
THE BATHOS.
Deep is the lover's voice,
When like a muffled bell,
As to the object of his choice
His tale of love doth tell.
Deep is the blackbird’s song,
And deeper still the sparrow's ditty,
But none of these—(ahl do not say I'm wrong),
Equal in depth the mud about the city.

We have heard it whispered in circles likely to be well informed, that
Mr. Snooks has at last been prevailed upon to allow one of his riddles to
be published on the snuff-paper of a popular tobacconist. We have heard
the riddle, but are not yet at liberty to go into particulars at present. We
can, however, venture to say, that it asks the question—When a certain
article is not a certain article 1 and the reply embodies a well-known
adjective. It may be objected that the idea is taken from the popular
enigma—“When is a door not a door " But we can go so far as to
assert, that there is so much neatness in the notion, and so much clever-
ness in the conceit of Mr. Snooks, as to give him almost the merit of
originality.
Mr. Snobson has a ballad in preparation, founded on the delightful song
of “Tell me, my heart.” It commences with “Oh inform me, my
bosom ; ” and is expected to become exceedingly popular.
THE MONEY MARKET.
Cash was excessively loose on Christmas-Day; but it became much
tighter on the demand for Christmas-boxes. The reduced scavengers
were done in many quarters at 00, which is the lowest figure ever known
on similar occasions; and though they had expressed a readiness to come
down at any time with the dust, they were not met in the same spirit.
The waits began briskly at 3 to 12, and left off flatly at 1h. 45m. ; but
very little disposition was shown by the public to have anything to do with
them. They were generally quoted as “dead weights” during the whole
of boxing-day.
THE EFFECTS OF • OUR PANTOMIME.” |
MR. W. H. Payne has so completely entered into the spirit and feeling of “ King
John," that he walked into the treasury of Drury Lane on Saturday last, under the
impression that he was actually Mr. Macready. We need not say he was instantly
undeceived by the treasurer.

ELLISTON AND “PUNCH.”
WHEN Elliston had retired from his empire of Drury Lane to his
Elba, the Surrey, he still maintained that regal deportment which
had in former times cast such glory about him. Elliston, like Caesar,
fell with dignity; hence, he was at times most difficult of access,
and most freezing in his manner. He was in one of his imperial
moods in the lobby of the Surrey, when J., an old Edinburgh actor,
begged Hunt, the singer, to introduce him to the lofty manager.
“Mr. Elliston,” said Hunt, “allow me to introduce to you Mr. J., of
Edinburgh.” Elliston looked at Mr. J. with an eye of ice, the while
silently dilating his nostrils. “I had the honour, Mr. Elliston, very
many years ago,” said the Edinburgh comedian, in his soft and timid
manner, “of belonging to your company.” “Indeed, Sir,” thundered
Elliston, “then you ought by no means to be the wretched actor
you are " Poor Mr. J. spoke not another word, but, as though
mortally wounded, sank upon a seat. Hunt followed Elliston,
and begged him if possible, by some kind phrase, to restore
the Edinburgh actor to life. At this moment, one of Elliston's
worshippers — for the manager of even Bullocksmithy would
have his idolaters—presented him with a large jorum of punch.
Glancing at the vessel and then at Hunt, Elliston smiled benignantly,
and with all the grace of the finished actor approached his victim.
“Mr. J.,” said Elliston, in his most dulcet tone, “will you do me the
honour of taking some punch f” “I thank you, sir,” answered Mr. J.
with all possible coldness, “I thank you, but I never take spirituous
liquors.” “Oh, nor I,” quickly answered Elliston, as though depre-
cating the indulgence as a general custom—“nor I, Mr. J., except”
—and here he drew his breath, and shook every syllable of the word
—“except me-di-ci-nal-ly. Come, Mr. J.;” and Elliston still pressed
the punch. Poor J., taking the vessel, just placed it to his lips, and
returned it to the manager. Elliston looked down into the punch as
children in the wood.
though he was looking into the crater of a volcano, then fixed his
merciless eye upon the actor, and bellowed out : “Well, Mr. J., for a
gentleman who does not take spirits, you have bit your name in this
most tremendously.” Here Hunt went away. Meeting J. the next
morning, he alluded to the incidents of the previous night. “I assure
you,” said J., “Elliston came round wonderfully. I had him, as I
thought, all to myself; I was bringing to his mind old times, old
anecdotes, and had him, I thought fast, for a night's gossip, when he
suddenly exclaimed, in the middle of one of my best stories—'I beg
your pardon, Mr. J.; it breaks my heart to leave you, but I have an
unavoidable engagement in the New Cut to sup on periwinkles.’”
THE SHARE MARKET.
The Waterloo Bridge new debentures, with the dividend of two-pence
payable on or before the 25th of March, 1873, are heavy at nothing;
while the dividend itself is so buoyant, that in spite of the eagerness to
realise, no one was found to have a hand in it. The scripholders of 1826
have been obliged to pay the interest guaranteed to the new proprietors of
1838, who, in their turn, have discharged the current expenses, leaving
a balance of li. 5s, to be added to the rest—which is nothing.
Room for IMPROVEMrnt.
EXHIBITIONS FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
THE laying down of the wood pavement opposite St. Martin's Church
has caused a large hole in the carriage way, which has been open to the
public all the week, and will remain so |. until furt.,er notice, but) with-
out any notice at all. Several people have fallen down upon their tem-
ples, so that the spot may be said to have been visited by many heads of
families.
The fountain in the Temple, by an arrangement with the water com-
pany, was kept º the Christmas week, and was visited by several
parties of juveniles. It was tastefully laid on in the form of a waggoner's
whip, and was greatly admired by the one or two individuals who stopped
to look at it.

SEASONABLE BENEWOLENCE. *
MasTER SMITH, on his return from school for the holidays, distributed
peas among the assembled villagers through a tin tube.
Sir Peter Laurie was about to rise for the purpose of making a speech,
when a friend, with seasonable benevolence, pulled him down by the skirts
of the coat, and prevented him from doing so.

THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
CHAPTER II.-OF SOCIETY IN GENERAL, AND OUR EXAMPLEs.
LTHOUGH it is allowed universally
that the two large theatres are doing
- very indifferently, and not supported as
they ought to be ; yet, if the crowds who
assemble there would only look about
them, they would find such far better
* actors, and so many more interesting
plots and situations amongst their own
connexions, that they would quit the
playhouses altogether in disgust, and
leave their treasuries in a state of bank-
ruptcy. They would find out that as at
our large theatres, performers are en-
gaged at tremendous salaries, whilst the
mobs and processions are content with
a shilling a night and their beer; so, in
the great world, some who hourly exhibit
their antics on the stage are rewarded
with immense fortunes, whilst the super-
numeraries and sceneshifters of life, to whom the working of the huge
machine is principally intrusted, occasionally starve for want of its
necessaries. In fact, whilst some men are born with soup-ladles in
their mouths of the chased Queen's pattern—figuratively speaking,
of course, because we do not think that an infant ever actually came
into the world with such an incumbrance—others are obliged to put
up with a bone marrow-spoon. And yet high or low, both these
classes, are versed in the contradictions and simulations of the side-
scenes. The man in an apron and paper-cap, who turns the winches
that give motion to the “Fountain of Revolving Diamonds,” in the
last scene of a fairy spectacle, occasionally solacing himself with a
draught of porter from a pewter-pot which he hides in the nautilus-
shell, as he crouches behind the back of the dolphin, has his proto-
types in the real world, who amuse the million with gaudy decep-
tions, whilst they are invisibly and quietly enjoying themselves, or
drawing their own gain from dazzling the multitude, with empty
brilliancy. As the trick in the pantomime, which by its ingenious
transformation calls down the applause of a delighted audience,
would be nothing if it were not for the assistant who pulls its con-
cealed strings, which once revealed to public view would take away
all the interest—so the parrenu, who changes in a day from humble
circumstances to a splendid income, would lose much of the éclat
which his altered state calls forth, did the world see clearly, in many
cases, how the transformation is effected. The stage was intended
to “hold a mirror up to Nature,” and very properly so, because, like
most other ladies, Nature is very fond of looking in a glass.
There is a half-price to be found in the entertainments of society,
as well as in those of the theatre—adapted to the circumstances of
those whose means will not allow them to take front rows in the
dress circle for the whole performance. The half-price is arranged
as follows:–Very often after a dinner-party to the most important
people of your connexion, who keep their carriages and reside west
of Regent-street, you invite your second-rate acquaintances to a
species of after-piece at the usual hour of half-price—nine o'clock.
These meetings are particularly distinguished by the passage
savouring very deliciously of soup, and the aroma of port-wine,
as you enter; two or three dish-covers for the visitors to stumble
over, may possibly be seen in the hall ; the tongue-sandwiches
taste rather warm and juicy, at the rifazione of the lighter dinner
viands doing duty a second time for supper ; and the gentle-
men come up stairs from the dining-room very argumentative and
political. And, generally speaking, a set dinner party is one of the
most melancholy examples we can offer of the feudal service by
which the givers hold their caste in society. Hospitality, which ought
to be the primary cause, is triumphed over by jealousy or ostenta-
tion. The whole entertainment is an unmitigated series of attempts
at rivalry and display: there is a mute eloquence in every cover and
claret-jug upon the table, which seems to say “See in what style we
do things here, compared to your own establishment!”
about the table, in the constrained style of a horse in a curb and
kicking-strap, with a clog at his heels, have something in them
peculiarly distressing. True it is, that after dinner the dialogue
becomes somewhat more animated; but then it is the forced
excitement of the decanters which effects this change; and the plea-
sure derived from it is far different to that which we experience
from the unrestrained conversation of those real acquaintance who
are as warm and animated over a boiled leg of mutton and turnips,
as they would be if treated with venison and French beans at
Christmas.
But pray, reader, do not think from this, that we are about to cry
down the general habits of society. Far from it, we assure you ; for
we admire many of its institutions, and also think that when any
one receives his friends, he is bound to entertain them as well as he
best may, always stopping short of ostentation. We are alone about
to expose the humbug conventionalities of the middle classes—it is a
harsh term we admit, but it suits our purpose—neither soaring to the
circles of the aristocracy, nor coming down to the sphere of the
vulgar, but keeping to that class of society known as “respectable”
—the vast mass, amongst whom we have reason to believe a large
proportion of our circulation lies.
We purpose, then, to forward this great end by showing-up a
family of our acquaintance—a sort of mental connexion of our own,
with whom we have been long upon terms of intimacy—in our imagi-
nation. Yet understand us : we are not about to drag forward any
private individuals upon the platform of our public exhibition, for
such a proceeding we have ever shrunk from.
The head of our family is Mr. Spangle Lacquer, who is reported to
have made a great deal of money somehow or another, but in what
precise way is not known, and has passed through the three degrees
of comparison appropriated to commercial wealth, in the stages of
shopkeeper, tradesman, and merchant. He prefers an uncomfortable
house, at an enormous rent, in the Hyde Park division of the Royal
Blue Book, because it is considered stylish to live there, to any of
the most eligible mansions he could command for half the sum in a
less fashionable part of the town. Mrs. Spangle Lacquer is a very
fine lady—a very fine lady indeed. She dresses by the fashion-books,
and has reserved-seats at concerts as well as a pew in a very fashion-
able church, where religion is made a medium for the display of

without a “page” at their heels, unless they are in their carriage. As

there is no degradation in their sometimes honouring the earth with

3}untb's Contrimporary 33iographics.
No. 1.-SIGNOR SWAGGERBIN1, CONDUCTOR OF THE MUSIC AT THE
ETRUSCAN TEMPLE IN THE COMMERCIAL ROAD.
The subject of our present biography was born in the vicinity of
IIolborn Bars, which accounts for his early love of music; and it is
said of him that, even as an infant, he would pay particular attention
to the singing of his mother's tea-kettle. He had scarcely attained
the age of eight, when he began to develop a remarkable love of
tune; and his father, in order to bring this faculty out, was accus-
tomed, when the boy wanted any indulgence, to let him very fre-
quently whistle for it. Such was his precision in the way of time,
that he could always tell the dinner hour by something within him
——or rather by the absence of something within him ; and at the
early age of 12 he had put some variations of his own to the “Margin
of Zurich's fair raters,” which he was in the habit of giving at dusk
with great effect in the public thoroughfares. This performance
sometimes attracted the attention of the authorities, by whom he was
occasionally a good deal sought after ; and he was honoured by the
especial notice of policeman K36, who struck our hero very forcibly
in a manner that was not soon forgotten. It was K36 who taught
the young musician the difference between Sharp and Flat ; for on
some occasions when he did not look sufficiently sharp, he was ren-
dered flat by the severe but wholesome interference of the official
alluded to.
Having purchased a halfpenny whistle at Bartholomew fair, our
hero became a proficient on that somewhat ineffective instrument,
but he subsequently brought himself into notice among his own
friends, by a very brilliant arrangement of the gallopade in Gustavus
for the Tintuberion—a small pipe made of the metal which its name
indicates.
Having picked up a violin at a dealer in marine store's, he picked
up, somehow or other, the knack of scraping a tune upon it; and
though he certainly cannot be ranked as a performer on the fiddle,
his quick ear renders him peculiarly fitted to conduct the orchestra
of the Etruscan Temple. The perfect control under which he holds
his band (consisting of a very classical quartette) is no less astonishing
to all who know him, than to all who don't. Nature having favoured
him with a squint, he is able to look a pair of daggers at once, and to
embrace in his vision the flute on his right as well as the double-bass
on his left. His enormous white paper cuffs and highly-chalked dog-
skin gloves give him the appearance of Jullien, whose style of
wielding the director's baton he closely imitates. As a conductor he
stands excessively high—being mounted on a wooden pedestal. His
compositions are very few, and he never commits them to paper,
but whistles them when he sets to music any of those pieces for
which the Roman Temple (licensed pursuant to the 2 thof
George the Second) is eminent. His idea is caught up by the
band, and in this way he has not a rival. among British coni-
posers. His crash music to the storm in the Mountaineers
is a truthful and energetic burst, consisting of two consecutive
chords in the orchestra; and the fine effect of the flute playing
a minor fifth while the double-bass is a major seventh out
of the key, is one which musicians only can properly appreciate.
thr Bold haNDLure or A Difficult suburct.
When he takes the violin in hand, he is often out, and his mother,
though devotedly attached to him, knows it. His real name is,
Swagger, but he assumed the interesting diminutive of ini at the end
of his first season at the Roman Temple. His engagement here is
supposed to be merely a stepping-stone to something else; but what
that something else is, has not yet been decided on. The terms of
his engagement are half-a-crown a night, with the privilege of beer
to the nightly tune of four-pence. We have already spoken of his
compositions, but his chief score is preserved in chalk at the back of
the bar-room door of the Etruscan Temple. It presents a series of
running passages, and it is expected the landlord will add an obli-
gato of his own at no distant period. Among other efforts of his
genius, we have heard it whispered that he has an idea of carrying
out an entirely novel plan, which will place him in permanently com-
fortable circumstances. It is something in the nature of a composi-
tion—and it is to be called sixpence in the pound, which he con-
templates dedicating to his creditors.
TNautical.
The following has been handed to us by an eminent Professor of Navi-
gation, as very important questions to be put to those gentlemen who are
about to pass their examination for Lieutenants in the R. N. ; extracted
from that celebrated work, “Sailing Directions between London and
Blackwall,” by the great Welch Navigator, Captain Richard Ap-Lin.
Stiggins and Co., No. XXX. Fillpot Lane.
“Ques. In steering between London and Blackwall, what are the
leading marks to “The George,’ half-way public house?
Ans. I steer E. by S. till I bring “the George’ to bear a point on
the larboard bow; I then keep on till I bring the flagstaff before the
door, and the pewter pot in the bar window, in one ; then cross the
street, bring the bar-door broad on the starboard beam, put the helm
hard-aport, and bear up for the door, which, having well opened, I put
the helm hard-astarboard, and, coming up to N. N.E., enter the Parlour.
Ques. What soundings have you in that Parlour?
Ans Many long yarns, pewter pots of various depths and yards of clay.
Ques. Supposing the night dark and squally, you hasy and unable
to make headway, what would you do?
Ans. I would bowse out my jib with a stiff Norwester at the
“Black Boy and Camel, light a cheroot, set my pea-jacket, and take
my departure on the top of a Blackwall omnibus.
Ques. By what method do you compute the course to be steered 1
Ans. As Aldgate Pump is to Whitechapel Church, so is the Halfway
House to Blackwall Stairs.”

She bounds along with step so fleet,
And such aerial spring,
That from a world where spirits meet
She seems some fairy thing.
Her eye, with gushing radianse full,
So clearly bright, and brightly clear,
Is sparkling (from a recent pull
At a quart of Barclay's beer).
The lily's whiteness p'rhaps may charm
Those who in meadows walk,
But nothing can outshine her arm
(Caked with the finest chalk).
To sylph-like tenants of the sky
We surely may compare
A creature that doth dwell on high
(In some back-room—three-pair).
As wild and graceful as the fawn,
As swift as young gazelle—
(She's lately taken out of pawn
That ring which shines so well).
She seems the very child of dance,
A gentle thing devoid of art—
(Without a month's pay in advance,
From France she would not start).

MoRE WORDS ON “PUNCH's PANTOMIME.”
WE are at this moment sitting knee-deep in letters touching our
Pantomime. If Punch were a boaster, if he delighted in sounding his
own tin trumpet, if he did not always retire within the modest circle
of his own silent thoughts, when a sense of his manifold merits and
virtues was pressed upon him by a grateful kingdom—then would
Punch print the whole of this correspondence. As it is, with a meek-
ness, a humility, not to be fully appreciated by one out of a million,
Punch contents himself with printing only the subjoined; assuring
the world and his epistolary friends generally, that their letters
(bound in gold-smeared morocco) will be carefully deposited in the
Punch library, for the eyes of unborn centuries. It is enough for
Punch to know (and let the unbelieving world peruse the subjoined
and be converted,) that the great original principles of his Pantomime
are working—potently working—in the breasts of millions.
LETTER. I.
MR. Punch - How am I to express to you º moral obligation for your
Pantomime ! Oh, sir! in about fifty years, how very much the world
will bless you ! I was naturally light and frivolous, treating all the
serious concerns of life as the mere juggling of mountebanks and trick-
sters I laughed at everything; but, sir, I have seen your Pantomime,
and—I have never smiled since {
What a shallow-hearted, sniggering wretch was I, when on the 26th
ult. I showed my grinning countenance—defiling the divine aspect of
man with ignorant laughter—in the front row of Covent-garden pit. Your
Pantomime, sir, began ; and my moral revolution began with it. Swiftly,
indeed, did your wondrous pantomime principles work within me ! A love
of laughter gave way to a recognition of the deep solemnities of life, and
by the time that Harlequin and Columbine had danced their first pas de deur,
I was, indeed, a “wiser and a sadder man.” I saw at once that such a
pantomime would involve in it the sternest truths, and that it was only
from the profoundest ignorance, from the most barbarian crassitude of
spirit, that men bring themselves to laugh at a harlequinade. I have seen
your pantomime, and I would now as soon laugh at a death's-head and
cross-bones.
In the very sadness, which means in the very wisdom of my heart, I
thank you for the great work you have begun. Go on, sir—go on, and by
repeated pantomimes, crush for ever the very seeds of laughter in the
heart of man.
I Remain, Sir, Your Obliged,
JAcob Giggleton.
P.S.—I have already sent in my resignation to “The Jolly Cocks,” and
think of joining the Anabaptists.
LETTER II.
Sir, I was a gay, flaunting fellow upon town ; in costume, fine as a
dragon-fly, in brain as empty—I only wish you could see me now !
I write this, Sir, from a very respectable hovel in the neighbourhood
of the wilds of Herne Bay; where I am located, at five shillings a week
for lodging, with the run of the turnips in the garden. It is Punch's
Pantomine that has sent me here !
When I rushed from Covent-Garden on the 26th ult, under the influ-
ence of your profound work, I passed the night reading Jeremy Taylor on
Death ; summoned, with the earliest dawn, a Jew clothesman, sold to him
my fine wardrobe, donned a gaberdine, canvas trousers, high-lows and an
overshadowing hat, and hastening per first boat to Herne Bay, arrived at
Mangel Wurzel Cottage at about 6 P.M. “Here,” said I, entering my
white-washed hermitage—“here," said I, smitten with the awful truths
in Punch's Pantomime, will I give up all the frivolities of life: here will
I study the complex nature of my fellow-creatures; here, though they
may talk about ‘the fall of man, I'll make him quite as good as new, if
not a great deal better. Sir, I do not jest—I have laid in a ream of
foolscap and a gallon of ink. The human mind shall look up again—and
this elevation it shall owe to Punch and Punch's Pantomime !
Any communication you may have to make, will reach me here at Mangel
Wurzel Cottage. Should you, influenced by the genial spirit of the season,
wish to make me a present, may I be permitted to suggest a copy of
Vossius And this too, if accompanied by a twelfth-cake, will not be less
acceptable to your own eremite,
Philo-Hobbes.
P. S.–Need I say, how delighted—how honoured I should feel, if you
would condescend to dignify my retreat by a visit I will feast you to my
uttermost. I should not be a worshipper of truth were I to brag much of
my beef, but this I can assure you—the horseradish hereabouts is unex-
ceptionable.
LETTER III.
DEAR, mean MR. Punch 1–Bless you ten thousand, thousand times
I had been a lost woman without your pantomime; now, am I the happiest
wife in Christendom
My dear husband had run away from me ; for six months, I heard not
where he was. Before his departure, he-but no, I will not speak of his
past errors, but of his present goodness ;
I was sitting, Mr. Punch, miserable as a deserted wife ought to be—
sitting on the 26th of December, in my back two pair, when I heard a
running up the stairs; the door was flung open, and my own dear Barnaby
rushing in, fell upon his knees before me. I thought I should have fainted,
but I asked him what he meant. He said nothing ; but laying your play-
bill down before me, and taking your pantomime from his pocket, tried to
speak, but burst into tears. *
Yes, Mr. Punch, my husband has since assured me that it is your Pan-
tomime that has sent him home to the paths of virtue and his loving wife.
I bless you for it sir, and hope, for the sake of all married folks, you'll go
on making no end of pantomimes, and at the same time, believing me
Your Obliged Servant,
MARIA Louisa Muggs.
P.S.–Is there any allowance made to families who “take a quantity” of
your printed pantomime ! I know a great many ladies who wish to pre-
sent their husbands with a copy. Their husbands have not yet run away
from them ; but, you know sir, “prevention is better than cure.”
LETTER IV.
SIR.—iave bene in the abit of prigging a Shillin aweek Hout off the til
off my mastere : i ave sene yoor panntoemine and i wil doe Sonoe
no Yourn
re, 3. Bob.
LETTER. W.
Theatre Royal Covent-garden, Jan. 10, 1843,
MR. Punch,--In your last you observe—“Mr. Manager Bartley says
my Pantomime is not a great original idea; never mind that—I say it
is.” And now, sir, permit me to add, so say I.
I must confess it, sir, that at first I did not wholly comprehend all the
wondrous subtleties of thought abounding in your production ; but, sir, I
have watched it with a growing interest. I have felt it due to myself as a
manager and a man, to take my place in front every night at the rise of
the curtain, remaining, delighted and improved, until the curtain fell. I
now believe Punch's Pantomime to be the test evidence of human
wit (certainly in a peculiar style) to be found in the whole range of the
drama; and it will, in the retirement of my life, in the golden, mellow
autumn of my days, it will be to me an exceeding gratification to reflect
that Punch's Pantomime was produced under my management—that it
produced the greatest theatrical revolution yet known, since Thespis dis-
mounted from his cart, and actors got into carriages.
I remain, Mr. Punch,
Your obedient and delighted servant,
GeoRGE BARTLEy.
P.S.—Permit me to add, on the part of Mr. John Cooper, that he is
“exactly of my opinion.”
Besides these, Punch has letters (all in the same strain) from Downing-
street; letters from several of the Foreign Ambassadors; but no
egotism was never the vice of Punch, and he will not print them.
Income-Tax Appeals.
The Commissioners of Bankruptcy having been assessed at the amount
of their salaries, have appealed, on the ground that they are not worth
so much.
The “heavy father” at the Victoria, who had been surcharged on the
ground of his having given away six full purses on one night, has appealed
—the purses and their contents having been “stage properties,” used in
the drama of The Benevolent Buffer; or, The Tomb, the Turk, and the
Telescope.
thr Millen and his MEN.
A penny-a-liner has appealed, in consequence of the lamentable falling-
off in accidents. He sets forth that, in consequence of the Fire-Escape
Society having lately discontinued their labours, the loss of life has been
so limited that his income has been materially diminished.
Mr. Charles Kean has appealed, on the ground of his having been reatly
over-rated.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPTER i.—MY ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND ; VISIT TO SHADRACH JACOB'S,
OF The MiNORIES.
My voyage from the Cape to the port of London I would fain pass
with the fewest words. I had at least this consolation—I was
an unwilling traveller. Otherwise, I had deserved all the mise-
ries of ship-board—the darkness, the fetor, the hubbub and violence
of the place. I have some pity for anything that in its ignorance of
salt-water first trusts itself to its mercies; but none for the fool that
ventures twice. There may be some Eden-like spots even in a coal-
mine; but, the hold of a ship—ugh
I remember being once present at a party of the Bishop of
Fat-o'the-land's. The conversation turned upon the bountifulness of
the sea, ordained, as it assuredly was, for the facile communication of
man with man. Poor simpletons ! It is my inherent faith that the
ocean was expressly created to keep nations as much as possible
separate; but that the courageous wickedness of man has set at
nought the benevolent design of nature, and—to her astonishment—
has triumphed in the very teeth of sea-sickness. Nay have I not, on
my side, the wisdom of law-makers ? For were they not of my faith,
would they tax silks and pepper On the contrary, would they not
take to their bosoms the adventurous men who are tossed to and
from the far East for rare commodities to clothe the limbs, and tickle
the palates of their fellow-bipeds? And what is the fact Why,
legislation, as a check to the presumption of man, makes him—in a
hundred different modes—pay for his temerity. The sea was intended
to keep people to themselves; but the human heart is wicked, and
men became ship-builders.
Let me here advise the reader of one of my besetting faults. I am
now and then apt to give up the thread of a narrative, that I may
run after some butterfly-thought starting up before me; however, if
the reader have patience, he will find that I always return to my
story. If he have not, let him make clear the history and utility of
the Pyramids, and at once lay down the feathery tale before him. I
am consciºus of this infirmity of falling into idle chit-chat. Consider,
however, the prejudices of my early education. Consider the time
of life at which I was taken to court—consider the society amidst
which I passed my whitest days, and you will pardon the small-talk
of this my forlorn, ragged, mortified old age.
IIowever, to begin the history of my adventures in merry, mise-
rable England:—I found myself the property of the third mate of
the Jupiter, who had purchased me, with other of my companions,
of a Kaffer, for a twist of pigtail; my new master rejoicing himself
exceedingly at the cultivated intellect which enabled him to
trick the savage. He never, I am certain, felt so much of an
Englishman, as when he had fobbed the Hottentot. Jack Lips-
comb, for so was my new master named, combined in his nature
—at least, so he thought—all the courage and daring of the sailor,
with the prudence and foresight of the experienced merchant.
With this belief, he had the deepest contempt for every man of every
other nation, save England. He believed that the blessings of arith-
metic were wholly confined to his own beloved country and her
darling sons; hence, in his small traffic with Chinese, Malay, and
Hottentot, he would insist that two and two made seven, five and
seven fifteen or twenty, as he might feel it convenient to arrange the
figures. In a word, he considered every foreigner to be produced by
benevolent nature for this one purpose—to bestow profit and pleasure
on a freeborn Briton. It was this consciousness of superiority that
made him vote himself “honest Jack Lipscomb—a man as was
above a lie, and didn't care who knew it. He'd no deceit in him, not
he no—he never did nothing that he need hide from nobody.” It
was, doubtless, this fine principle that induced the ingenuous sailor
to pack myself and some twenty companions between his shirt and
jacket ere he quitted the Docks. Doubtless, there was no need of
such an arrangement, no other than the whim, the caprice of honest
Jack Lipscomb.
On leaving the Docks, Jack took his way towards the Minories;
and in a short time smote the hospitable door of an ancient Hebrew,
known among his people as Shadrach Jacobs, and still more fami-
liarly recognised by his intimates as “old Fluffy.” Shadrach was a
dealer in the pomps and vanities of life, turning the honest penny by
such commodities, and still benevolently deploring their existence.
IIe would employ an hour, persuading a poor wench that ear-lings of
mosaic metal were of the purest ore, pocket the girl's quarter's wages
for the small commercial deceit, and then sigh for the promised
innocence, the pure felicity of the New Jerusalem. This was the
tradesman who, for the past four voyages, had purchased the mer-
chandise of honest, knowing Jack Lipscomb.
“Well if it isn't Mr. Lipscomb—if I didn't dream on you last
night—if I didn't dream you was come home, captain, don't never
believe me, that's all!” Such was the salutation of the Hebrew
dealer, as Jack stood revealed at the door-step. “This way, Mr.
Lipscomb—this vay;” and old Fluffy fluttered down the passage, and
mounted the narrow staircase, shaking at least twenty years from his
heels, with the expectation of sudden gain. Jack was speedily con-
ducted into the Jew’s room, crammed and littered as it was with
exotic produce—shells, feathers, birds, bamboo-sticks, Indian ham-
mocks, war-swords, canoe-paddles, with half-a-dozen screaming par-
rots and macaws, enriched the commercial sanctuary of the Hebrew.
“If I didn't dream you was captain, Mr. Lipscomb 1" repeated the
Jew as Jack dropt himself upon a chair.
“Captain : " cried Jack, affecting a contempt for such vain dignity.
“Well, then, first mate,” said the Jew, as though his dream com-
prehended even the second rank.
“Ugh 1” cried Jack, “a pretty first-mate we've got—yes, a good
'un, he is—just knows a bowsprit from a umbrelia, and thet's all.”
“Bless me ! vell 1" sighed the Jew, and then smiling and rubbing
his hands, he turned himself towards Jack, and with an affected look
of anxiety, said, “In course, Mr. Lipscomb, you comes back second "
“I tell you what, old Fluffy,” said Jack, stung with the feeling of
unrewarded personal merit, “I tell you what—I'm just what I was–
honest Jack Lipscomb—third mate of the Jupiter, and I’d like you
to show me a more straightforwarder, honester, cleverer fellow !”
“Hat it would do good to my eyes to see him as could,” said
Shadrach; and then, in a tone of sympathy, “only third-mate—vell,
this is a vorld, to be sure 1* Having thus delivered himself, Mr.
Jacobs proceeded to the first business of his life; namely, to business
itself. He had thought it merely prudent to learn the condition of
his old acquaintance, whether improved or not, since they last met.
This, it must be owned on the part of the Jew, was really respectful
to station in the abstract; for if Mr. Lipscomb were Captain Lips-
comb, Mr. Jacobs, of course, knew too well what was due to rank to
offer to a commander, or even to a first or second mate, that which in
the trader's own opinion, was merely due to the third. “Well, and vot
have you brought us, Jack t” asked the Jew, with the old familiarity
of an old friend.
“In the first place,” answered the sailor, “feathers;” and he pro-
duced me.
“Feathers, vell, I don’t know,” mused the Jew, “as for feathers,
Jack, they're down to nothin'. There's no vonder the vorld's vot it
is, for feathers is quite gone out. Look at them shelves, there; look
at them boxes—all full—not sold a feather this six months. I don't
know vot's come to people. Some say it's edication—I don't know ;
if it is, it ought to be put down, for it makes the feather trade nothin’—
nothin'—nothin’.” Thus spoke the Jew, his voice deepening on each
of the last three words, until he sounded what seemed the very bass-
string of despair.
Indeed, the Jew and the sailor might have made a picture.
Shadrach had, in his youth, rejoiced in luxuriant locks of more
than golden ; they were, in the intense signification of the

phrase, red gold. These, in the storms of life, had become thickly
specked with grey and white; yet remained there a departing ray
among them to indicate the glory that was past. Shadrach's face
was lean and pointed; his eyes quick, and, as at times they seemed,
trembling with excess of light—a light reflected as from guineas. His
nose was boldly bowed, indicating the true son of Israel; and whilst
the corners of his upper lip were twitched by muscular emotion—
(how mysteriously is fashioned the civilised man, when there is a
connexion between the seat of the pocket and the seat of the mouth)
—emotion, due homage to the spirit of gain, his under lip hung
down, lapped over with the weight of sensibility, or sensuality, I
cannot here decide. His sharp face, quick eye, faded yellow hair
and ardent complexion, gave him, to the eye of fancy, the visage of
an old fox, grown venerably grey in the blood of stolen geese. And
thus Shadrach sat and gazed at Jack Lipscomb.
And Jack received the looks of the Jew with the stalwart manner
of a British tar, chewing the while that sweetest condiment—pigtail

A * SPORTING” PUBLICAN AND “SPORTING” PEERS 1
A few days ago, the Justices of Newbury fined one William North, of
Monmouth-street, Bath, for having “wantonly and cruelly abused, ill-
treated, and tortured a horse.” The matter was undertaken for a bet;
the horse to run 53 miles in four hours and a half. The horse died
* within 20 minutes after it arrived, from the effects of having been overdriven. In
the evening the animal was examined by a veterinary surgeon, and it was proved
that the immediate cause of death, was the violent exertion it had been compelled to
undergo. When the defendant reached Hungerford he stopped a minute or two to
give the horse some “sherry." At this place several persons remarked the condition
of the horse, and advised the defendant not to proceed, as it was quite evident that
it could not live to reach Newbury. He, however, persisted, and continued
towards the Halſway-house, when the death of the animal compelled him to give up
the match.”
William North was forthwith condemned to a fine of 5l. 6s. 6d., with
costs, which (of course) was immediately paid. William North obtained
only his deserts ; and we trust that if he read the report in The Times,
he turned to another column, and perused an article headed “The Royal
Buck-hounds.” On this occasion, the celebrated little deer, “Sailor,” was
turned out for the dogs, the Earl of Rosslyn and other peers following.
The deer was uncarted at the Splash, when
“it crossed that portion of the Beeches for a short distance, and headed back to
Farnham-common, crossing the hounds, and then nearly to Farnham, whence it
headed back to East Burnham, and again to the Beeches, where it was run into by a
portion of the pack (close to the Splash), and got terribly bitten before the hounds
were whipped off. The Earl of Rosslyn stated in the field, that it would be the last
time the “Sailor” would be brought out, as it is supposed he has seen his best days
(he has now but one eye), and is out of condition for hunting for the future.”
If the spirit of Esop can inform “Sailor” whilst enjoying Windsor
pastures (always provided he is not shot for Windsor larder), with what a
proud consciousness must he tread the green sward ' What keen delight
—what true enjoyment, has he afforded to nobles of the land 1 To be sure,
he has again and again been hunted to agony—has been, as some people
would say, like the publican's horse, “wantonly and cruelly abused, ill-
treated, and tortured ;” but then it has been for sport—for the express
delectation of royalty and the peerage. Poor “Sailor!” . He was, on his
last exhibition, “terribly bitten” too by the dogs—he had lost an eye in
previous pleasures; but then, happy brute!—happy in its aristocratic rank
and breeding—it is not confounded in its miseries with the agony of a
publican's horse. If we consider the conduct of John North towards his
steed, we have much in stern reproof to shake the head at ; but con-
templating an array of nobles, horsed and spurred to hunt a deer from
county to county, to have it “terribly bitten" by the dogs—torture strain-
ing “its leathern coat, almost to bursting”—and after all to be taken
back for future pleasure (agony) on a future day,+that is, perhaps, the
noblest spectacle to be afforded by wise, contemplative, benevolent man |
A poet (now coming into fashion) has, among the greatness of his other
doctrines, propounded this elevating dogma—
“Never to link our pleasure or our pride
With suffering of the meanest thing that lives.”

WORKING OF THE NEW TARIFF.
It is expected that the New Tariff, in conjunction with the Corn Laws,
will have the effect of increasing the consumption of articles of food to
so t an extent, as to wear out a far greater number of teeth than
hitherto; and the Dentists of the Metropolis are likely to reap a rich
harvest. We have seen a celebrated Surgeon-Dentist, who tells us that,
where he used to make one false tooth in a month, he now . three ;
but he complains that the impetus to his business is feverish and hectic,
for he cannot get ready money in any quarter. If there should be a
fixed duty on corn, the molars or grinders will come into operation more
frequently, and there will be mastication for the million, which is far
more desirable than singing—a practice that tends to excite hunger rather
than to satisfy its cravings.
THE QUARTER'S REVENUE.
WHILE the national finances are all at sixes and sevens, it will at least
be satisfactory to the public to learn, that Punch's own revenue shows a
tremendous increase, not only on the year and the quarter, but on the
month, week, day, hour, and minute. Our takings over the counter were
TAKING A PRoxiinfºnt PART,
fourpence more yesterday at half-past twelve than at the corresponding
moment of the same day in the last week; and our till, at a quarter to six,
presented such an astounding surplus, that our boy ventured to request,
that an annuity might be settled on his aged mother—a demand that was
at once acceded to. Our advertisement account shows an increase on the
week; and our neglect in paying the duty to the Stamp-office, may account
for the deficiency, under the head of stamps, in the statement of the pub-
lic revenue. The only deficiency is in our own pockets, which exhibit a
decrease on the whole year, and a perfect vacuum on the quarter.
CASUALTIES, &c., OF “THE SPECTATOR.”
OUR “cold-water” friend, the Spectator, has long been celebrated for his
incomparable frigidity. He sometimes for half-a-paragraph disappoints
the reader; but he finds that the writer is at the last always true to him.
self. For instance, the gentleman may go on with several lines of praise;
then he inevitably comes to a “but,” and this is sure to be a cold-water
butt. Within the past few days, several accidents have occurred in the
office, which as faithful journalists we are bound to give ; at the same time
informing the reader that there may be, in some particulars, slight exag-
geration. We give the “casualties” as they have reached us:–
The compositor employed to put in type the notices of the drama, fine
arts, &c., is suffering dreadfully from the awful coldness of the articles, all
his fingers being in a dreadful state of chilblain.
A pressman accidentally treading upon a piece of copy that had fallen
on the floor, was tripped up, as though he stepped upon a sheet of ice.
The poor man was conveyed to the hospital, where he lingers with a dis-
located ankle.
Last week the theatrical critic, entering the conservatories of Covent
Garden market, left a hoar-frost upon all the exotics. Many are ex-
pected not to recover.
Several confectioners, despairing of their usual stock of ice, have sent
in tenders for unsold copies.
The Spectator was last week expelled from the reading-room at Liver-
pool, it being found that no sooner was the journal brought into the esta-
blishment than all the fires went out. It is, however, expected that the
paper will be taken in as a great luxury in the dog-days.
During the late frost it was found necessary to keep the editor's ink
boiling in a saucepan. It is, however, a curious fact, that no sooner did
the liquid enter the gentleman's pen, than it fell below zero.
£ashionable intelligentt.
Ma. and Mas. SMITH have taken the attic lately occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. Jones: the latter have gone to pass the holidays in a new lodging.
The Indian-rubber Untrustables entertained a large circle in the public
streets on Wednesday last. The celebrated drum band was in attendance,
and played several popular airs, accompanied by the Pandean pipes. A
policeman was in attendance.
Baron Nathan left Kennington for the West End by the Paragon
omnibus. The Baron, being unable to find an inside-place, took the oaths
and his seat on the coach-box.

THE OLD ENGLISH POETS.
No. 1.-CHAUCER.
Chaucer is known as the father of English poetry, and seems to have
left his offspring very shabbily off, if we are to judge by the mass of anti-
quated gammon he has bequeathed to posterity; . It is said that Chaucer
flourished in the time of Edward the First, and his flourishing probably
consisted in the fact of his writing down everything with his own hand,
for all he did was in manuscript. His Canterbury Tales beat those of
MissLee quite hollow, and arefood for the strongest intellect; but such food,
that nothing Butaliterary ostrich could in these days succeed indigesting it.
Chaucer, like a meddling old humbug as he was, embroiled himself in
political disputes, and was compelled to fly to Holland; but he returned,
and was made clerk of the works at Westminster, a situation now held by
one of the men in the employ of Messrs. Grissell and Peto. When he
lost this place, which was only temporary, he got a letter of license,
and afterwards occupied a house, of which the rent was only fifty-three
shillings and fourpence. He died in London, and was buried, in
westminster Abbey, being the first of the file of poets (very old files,
some of them t) who laid their ashes there. The flights of fancy in
which Chaucer indulged were not half so vigorous as his flight
from the numerous duns who followed him up ; and though he never punc.
tually discharged a liability, he came down with his dust in liquidation of
the debt of nature. Like agentleman, Chaucer delighted in his books; but
how he could have done so is a marvel to us, for such books as he has left
behind him, we (Punch) cannot at all appreciate. His splendid description
of a barn-door cock is ranked on a level with Shakspeare's allusion to the
Morning Herald, put into the mouth of the Ghost in Hamlet, and his
beautiful line descriptive of a priest-
“Full well he sange the service divine-”
will not be easily forgotten. -
His glorious burst of passion in the Good WIP or Bath is thought by
some to be equal to anything ever done by Mr. Cartlitch at Astley's. We
give it: * The Reve was a slendre colerike man,
his berd was shave as neighe as ever he can.”
we boldly ask, where is the poet of the present day who would venture
on this splendid piece of imagery, which leaves such a glorious uncertainty
as to the extent of his “shave,” telling us only it was as “neighe as ever
he ean;" but how “neighe" that was, is shrouded in poetic mystery.
with these remarks we leave Chaucer to the admiration of our wonder-
ing and flabbergasted readers.
MORE “WAx” FOR THE CHINESE.
The Observer tells us that the “great seal of England” has been
affixed to the treaty “between England and China;" and, as we think
we shall prove from our very contemporary, quite unnecessarily; for
says The Observer 1–
“Of the seal itself, it is expected no trace of the impression of Mr. Wyon's beau-
tiful mould will exist when the case reaches its destination, on account of the
yielding nature of the materials of which it is composed; indeed, on former occa-
sions, it has been discovered that during the comparatively short journey between
Scotland and London the design has been completely obliterated.”
Under these circumstances, and also considering—as Sir Henry Pot-
tinger has proved—“the yielding materials” of which the Emperor
himself is composed, would it not have been a handsomer thing on the
part of our Government to have sent out a stick of sealing-wax to the
Brother of the Moon, and let him have sealed for himself?
We, however, can still suggest a remedy. It will surely be very neces-
|sary that the emperor should understand the armorial terrors of England,
and we therefore propose the appointment of a committee of explana-
|tion, to instruct the emperor as to what was once impressed upon the wax,
“no trace of the impression remaining.” Why should not a Colonel
Sibthorpe and a D'Israeli be of the committee SIBTHoRPE could say—
“This, please your Emperorship, this piece of melted wax was a lion º
and D'Israeli, playing his part, might add—“and this a unicorn!”
|The only difficulty would be in getting the emperor to understand the
Dieu et mon Droit. It will be a hard matter to make him couple the
opium war with “God and my right.” The task will be too delicate for
a layman; and therefore we suggest that, for the proper instruction
of his Celestial Majesty, a bishop be added to the commission; and
that that bishop be (who so fit 1) Henry of ExETER 1
* PUNCH*S* ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE CHEMISTRY.
It is quite clear that there is carbon in cabbages, and the albumen
or white of an egg, is identical with the gluten of plants; so that
there is hope that some day or other the hedges will hatch chickens.
The chemists have analyzed ox flesh, and have found starch, sugar,
and gum in it; but the gum is all in the mouth, the starch is in the
gills, and the sugar is left in solution; but there is no solution to
the difficulty experienced in finding it. Whether it will be possible
to cultivate the albuminous principle in plants, so far as to make them
a substitute for meat, has not been ascertained; but if a hedge-stake
can be made equivalent for a beef-steak, the fact would be highly im-
portant in the eyes of the Poor Law Commissioners. All of us contain
a very large proportion of oxygen, and a certain quantity of carbon,
which, acting in combination on the different particles of matter, produce
the essence commonly called breath, and gives rise to animal heat. It is
clear that the gas in our bodies is pretty nearly equal in all of us, so that
had it been laid on by the equitable company itself, there could not well
have been a fairer adjustment of it. Some, however, have more—some less;
which accounts for the different degrees pf enlightenment, and causes a
want of equality in the disposition to flare-up among the human race
in general. It has never occurred to scientific men to light the metropolis
with human health; but as it contains a good deal of gas, and many people
use their breath to very little purpose, it is to be regretted that some gas
company does not make some arrangement to prevent the aforesaid breath
being wholly wasted. Daisies contain gluten, and daffydowndillies are, to
a certain extent, imbued with carbon; but this is also found in ash and
other vegetable substances. Every hundred tons of turnips contain ninety
tons of water; so that any one who lives entirely on these things, might in
time become a regular butt by such a course of treatment. Dumas, a
French chemist, declares that the principle of fat is to be found in hay;
but we never met with any. We will, however, examine a truss of it that
we have by us, and if we find a bit of fat there, we shall not fail to make
the fact known in our next Number.
The Share Market.
The Hungerford and Belvedere Suspension shares are flat, but the
holders are flatter. The report that a new pile had been driven in
caused some excitement, which was soon allayed by an authenticated
statement of the fact, that Old Thames was so extremely obstinate, that
he had scarcely been got out of the bed of the coffer before he tumbled
in again.
†. Chelsea Chain-pier scrip has rallied, and a shareholder who had
thrown his shares into the dust-hole has had them looked for among the
rubbish, with a view to giving them another trial. The Chelsea Emigra-
tion Society, for colonising Battersea-fields and draining all the flats in
the neighbourhood of Wandsworth, has been broken up. Their chief
object was to restore the ancient order of Jolly Young Watermen; but
they have failed signally in this bold experiment.

PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER II.--THE UPS AND DOWNS OF OLYMPUS.
RANUS and Terra, among
their numerous godlings,
had some forty-five stal-
wart sons, who were very
tight lads, and therefore
called Titans. When a man
has a large family he often
wishes it at the deuce; and
so sometimes do the gods.
Mortals, however, can only
implore this blessing on
their progeny: immortals,
if they choose, can confer
it. Now, Uranus took a
dislike to these forty-five
boys of his, for no reason
upon earth except that
º ) they were “great hulking
ſy fellows”—which was no
s=2^ reason at all in heaven,
where provisions were
cheap. He accordingly confined them all, except the eldest,
Saturn, in the infernal regions: a place of which you will know
more hereafter—I mean, by description. This so grieved his wife,
Terra, that she poured forth floods and ataracts of briny tears,
whereby the sea became impregnated with its chloride of sodium.
Not content, however, with crying, she instigated Saturn—who would
have been imprisoned, too, if anybody haddared to arrest him—to
dethrone the unnatural father. In this enterprise Saturn succeeded;
but not without a struggle, in which Uranus
received a bloody nose—or, to speak with
more accuracy, in a fanciful metaphor, he
had his “claret tapped.” Gods, be it ob-
served, bleed ichor. From this blood, or
claret, or ichor, there sprung a crop of mon-
sters called giants, each about nine acres long.
Uranus was divorced from his wife Terra,
and banished into a remote planet, unknown
to the ancients, which was discovered in
1781 by the late Dr. Herschel—the astrono-
mer, not the Rabbi. The next step of
Saturn was the liberation of his brothers,
who made an agreement with him that he
should be Emperor of Everything, provided
he brought up no male children. To this
Saturn agreed, took his coronation oath by
the Styx, and ascended his father's throne.
His next brother, Hyperion, who was created
a sort of celestial Duke of York, took up his
quarters in the sun, of which he was to rule
the roast. -
Weary of a bachelor's life, and longing
for domestic bliss, Saturn, not long after his
accession, contracted a matrimonial alliance.
The object of his choice was his sister Ops,
alias (for there were aliases in the Courts above, as well as in
the Courts below) Rhea. His empress soon presented him with
a pledge of affection, which, the moment it was placed in his
hands to be kissed, he, to her unspeakable horror, stuffed into
his great mouth and swallowed. Each little annual in succession
he regularly devoured in the same way: he would not even
preserve one as a forget-me-not, or a keepsake. In vain did Ops
kneel, beg, intreat, implore him to relinquish this barbarous
practice. ... In vain did she and the nurse-nymphs cry shame upon
him in full chorus; in vain did they call him. Theophagus, and Tek-
nophagus, and Theoteknophagus, and other hard and opprobrious
names ; he persisted in his boa-constrictor-like habit, and replied
to their tears and exclamations only by a hoarse laugh, wherein he
was joined by his eruel brothers. It was his agreement with them
which induced him to take this cruel line in the first instance; but
he was confirmed in it by subsequently having received from an
oracle a hint that one of his children would depose him. if he did not
take care. “For,” he thought to himself, “the best way to make
sure of them will be to bolt them.”
Now here some sceptic will say “Pooh 1” and ask how could Saturn
eat his children, immortal as, of course, they were ; at all events,
how could he digest them How, indeed If he had asked such
a question in Ancient Greece, the priests would have soon taught
him how. They would not have burnt him alive, perhaps; but if they
would not have ordered a “go” of hemlock for “that gentleman,”
never believe history.
Perceiving that complaints were unavailing, Ops had recourse
to stratagem. The next godling she had (which proved to be a fine
boy), she secreted it; and when Saturn came smacking his lips for the
tit-bit, she playfully told him to “shut his eyes, and open his mouth, and
see what she would send him.” He, pleased with her apparent ac-
quiescence, did as he was desired, whereupon she slipped a huge
oyster, or, accórding to some, a pebble, (however, it is all one,) into
the baby-trap, and down it went, without question. The son thus
preserved she called Zeus; and she put him out to nurse in a respect-
able family at Mount Pleasant (then called Mount Ida) in Crete.
Here he was fed on goat's milk and honey, which proved a most
nutritious diet: for the young dog (that is, young god, especially if
you read the word backwards) grew so big and strong in a twelve-
month as to be quite able to defend himself. During his helpless
infancy, the interesting child was protected by a fortunate circum-
stance from paternal voracity: the good people with whom he was
placed lived next door to an institution for the insane, where certain
madmen, called Corybantes, were kept. These poor people (who
were a kind of classical Ranters, and had become deranged through
fanaticism) were continually creating a disturbance by yelling and
shouting, and by the clashing of cymbals and the beating of drums
which they were allowed to play with, to keep them, as their Irish
keeper said, quiet. By this hullaballoo the cries of the little deity
were effectually drowned; a result which could have been achieved
in no other manner—for he would scream like fifty screech-owls, and
roar like a bull. This last accomplishment stood him afterwards in
good stead, when he put on horn and hoof, and went courting
Europa-though then he roared “gently as any sucking dove :" but,
as a child, he was much more noisy. It is lucky, therefore, that his
foster-parents did not indict the asylum for a nuisance, which they
had thought of doing more than once.
When Zeus had arrived at maturity, Ops confessed to Saturn the
trick that she had played him, whereupon he flew into a tremendous
fury; but knowing that his son would be too strong for him, and
would infallibly take his mother's part, he abstained from offering
her any violence. He even consented to see the young deity—pro-
bably, however, more on prudential grounds, than from any feeling
of affection.
After this Saturn ate no more of his children. “What must be,
must,” he said; and consoling himself with this reflection, he drowned
every other in nectar. Nectar was the drink of the gods. Some say
it was Champagne; others, Burgundy; others, claret; one calls it
hock; another hic; and a few maintain that it was half-and-half.
Whatever it was, it was uncommonly good; and Saturn took to it.
Ops now went on increasing her family without molestation from
her liege lord. At this her brothers, particularly Hyperion, were

highly exasperated ; they declared that Saturn had violated his
coronation oath, and that if he did not abdicate immediately, they
would make him—or see themselves at Orcus.
Their threats came to the ears of Zeus, who at once resolved juvare
patrem, to assist his father, whence, as some say, he was afterwards
called Jupiter. Accordingly, bestriding an enormous eagle which
he had tamed, he literally flew to the rescue. “My boyſ" cried
Saturn, quite affected, when Zeus, or Jupiter, as we shall henceforth
call him, appeared before his throne—“My boy, my child—forgive
me—I have done thee wrong!” “Governor l’” answered Jupiter,
“never mind; I'll stand by you to the last.” The parent grasped
his heroic son by the hand, and the youth returned the parental
pressure. The other children of Saturn melted into tears, and all
vowed eternal fidelity to their ancient sire.
This pathetic scene took place on the top of Mount Olympus, where
stood the celestial palace among the clouds.
By the aid of the great Jupiter the rebellious Titans were defeated.
The particulars of the contest would, if related, form a tremendously
appalling narrative, and one infinitely more spirit-stirring than any
description of carnage on a grand scale by the most graphic Irish
novelist. But the war of the giants, which will be chronicled in the
next chapter, being just the same affair, only on a much grander
scale, let it suffice to say, that after several volleys of rocks and
mountains on the part of the Titans, and much spirited thundering on
that of Jupiter, the insurgents were made prisoners, and trans-
ported to various penal settlements. Some were buried beneath the
Alps and Andes, some confined at the bottom of Vesuvius and Ætna,
and others sent to keep company with Erebus.
Will it be believed that after all this Saturn grew jealous of his
son Jupiter, and conspired against his happiness and liberty? Such
was the melancholy fact ; and it placed Jupiter under the painful
necessity of deposing his ungrateful progenitor—thus fulfilling the
decree of Destiny. The treacherous Saturn absconded. He first
fled to America, where he expected to be hospitably taken in ; but
finding that he was taken in inhospitably, he shifted his residence to
Italy, where Janus, who was king of that country, was so good as to
give him half-a-crown—sharing with him his
sovereign power. He now, taught by adver-
sity, turned over a new leaf, and by promoting
in every way his people's happiness, proved
himself a good governor. His son, therefore,
forgave him; and though he would not trust
him again on the throne of Olympus, where he
had very naturally established himself, he
assigned him a temple among men and a very
comfortable planet to live in—rather cold,
perhaps, but gods are exempt from rheu-
matism. -
Things being thus settled, Jupiter, finding himself autocrat of the
universe, and in the possession of unlimited power, very wisely pro-
ceeded to make himself as comfortable as possible. He thought he
would look about him a little before he married; but he had his
throne and sceptre re-gilt—his pavilion, which was considerably
handsomer than that at Brighton, fresh painted and decorated. He
ordered in several pipes of nectar, and not a few of tobacco; and he
dubbed himself “Father of the Gods and Men.”
THE “SCHOLASTIC POLICE.”
Punch, in his too frequent collisions with the police, has frequently
remarked the growing politeness, the humane and gentle courtesies to be
found among that body; a day or two since he discovered the cause of
this. . Mr. Higginbottom, of Flayem House, Brixton, was regretting to a
friend and late schoolmaster, the dearth of classical assistants—the paucity
of ushers, who, at 30l. per annum, were wont to teach Greek, Latin, Mathe-
matics, &c. &c. “Why,” said his friend, “there was no want of such
people in my time ! No ushers to be had How do you account for it tº
#: dººr friend,” said Higginbottom, “they're all gone into the New

3puntb's “Court Cirtular.”
HER Majesty, in furtherance of her most gracious determination to
patronize the English drama, “commanded” the performances at Covent-
Garden on Wednesday last. Her Majesty with Prince Albert, attended
by a numerous and brilliant suite, arrived at the theatre at five minutes to
seven. Her Majesty and the Prince were received by Messrs. Bunn and
Bartley in full court dress, and immediately lighted to the royal box. On
the appearance of the Queen and the Prince, the audience (and we never
witnessed one more numerous or more enthusiastic) rose, cheering and
applauding, whilst the orchestra immediately commenced God save the
Queen. When the anthem was concluded, the curtain rose upon a new
comedy, called She's Come at Last. Both her Majesty and the Prince
seemed to relish, with the keenest pleasure, the many sparkling and agree-
able points abounding in the play; whilst She's Come at Last, as a general
performance, appeared to give the highest pleasure to the audience at
large. The Comedy was followed by The Agreeable Suprise, and the
Entertainments concluded with the Pantomime. Her Majesty staid until
the fall of the curtain, and then retired amidst the renewed cheers and
hurrahs of the audience, who evidently appreciated this condescension on
the part of the Queen, who, by thus giving her countenance to the national
drama, by thus patronizing one of the most ennobling arts, gives one proof,
among a thousand others, of her high personal sense of the advantages, and
what is more, of the duties of her elevated station.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
chapter. Ii.
The RE was a pause of some two or three minutes. Jack Lips-
comb fully apprehending the purpose of Shadrach Jacobs, yet at the
same time feeling somewhat humiliated by the consciousness of his
inferiority to the Jew. Thus had Jack in his innermost heart crowed
and triumphed at the hard bargain which had made me his property
With what profound contempt had he contemplated the intellectual
degradation of the Kaffer who sold me, tricked, cheated, as the poor
savage had been, by the mixed lying and bullying of the sailor. Such
had been Jack's emotions; but as he sat, and silently chewing, gazed
at the Jew, he half-seemed to himself to change his condition with
the barbarian he had gulled—he felt, in its fullest force, the supre-
macy of the Jew;-he shrank beneath the influence of a subtler
nature. Thus, Jack Lipscomb remained doggedly silent—and thus
the Jew was at length compelled to be a talker.
* I tells you, Jack, feathers is nothin'. If, now, you've a little bag
of gold-dust, or any nicknack of that sort—vell, you havn't Vell,
vell—more's the pity, Jack—more's the pity, Mr. Lipscomb.”
“Then we sha’n’t deal, eh?” asked Jack sulkily, and throwing a
significant glance towards the door. “Well, there's Barney Aaron,
yet—that's one comfort.”
“Well, I didn't think it of you, Jack ; to threaten me with that
sarpent—that disgrace to the synagogue. Votif feathers is a drug,
do you think Mr. Lipscomb that I’d let you be robbed Vy, I should
think the roof would fall upon me if I let you go out of this house to
be cheated.”
“Humph : I don’t know,” said Jack, a little mollified—“perhaps
you arn’t the worst of the sharks.”
“I vish I vos—yes, Mr. Lipscomb, I vish I vos,” said the Jew,
earnestly, “for then I shouldn’t be the beggar vot I am. Ha! this
is a vorld ! Well, vell, we must take it as it is till the better one
comes.”
“In course,” responded Jack, philosophically; and then counting
my companions and myself before the Jew, he asked, “How much for
the lot tº
“I don't know vot to do vith 'em,” answered Shadrach despond-
ingly, looking down upon us, and sighing deeply. “As I'm an
honest man, I shall only keep 'em for the moths. Vot money have
you in your pocket, Jack?”
“Something within hail of five pounds,” replied the sailor.
* Well, let me see—von, two, three, yes, fourteen feathers—”
“Seventeen, you griffin,” growled Jack
“Well, vell—I didn't see ; ven you’ve looked upon the vickedness
of the vorld as long as I have, Mr. Lipscomb, you’ll have some
feelin' for an old man's eyes. Let me see, six—no, yes—seventeen
—vell, seventeen feathers, and you've got seven pound in your
pocket t”
“Four pound, six half-crowns,” said Jack in correction.
“Now shall I tell you vot I've long thought of, Mr. Lipscomb 1
I’ve often said to myself, vot a pity it vos that a man like you, Mr.
Lipscomb, didn't think more of yourself: that you didn't show the
face you ought to the vorld.”
“What do you mean, Mr. Jacobs?” asked Jack, very seriously.
“Vy, you see,” continued the Jew, in his blandest manner, smiling
upon the sailor—as an epicure smiles upon a dish he purposes very
pleasantly to incorporate in his system—“vy you see, vot does it go
for if you're the best sailor as ever swum—the honestest, jovialest,
goodlookingest young man as ever von the vink of a wirtuous young
voman—vot does all your goodness go for vith the vorld, if you don't
vear a votch f"
Jack Lipscomb, with increasing gravity, sawed the back of his
hand across his chin, and looking upon the floor, seemed as if the
interrogative of the Jew had awakened a dormant feeling of vanity
—had, in a moment, solved to his entire satisfaction, a great social
mystery. “I don't know, if you ar’n’t right,” said Jack, after a
pause.
“As the vorld goes—for it's made of wanity, Jack—a man's nothin'
vithout a votch.”
“There may be something in it,” agreed the sailor.
“I’m an old man, my tear friend, and know the vorld vith all its
crooked bits, and nasty blots, and I talk to you, Jack, like my own
flesh and blood.”
“Come, avast there !” exclaimed Jack, suddenly; “none o' that—
I’m a Christian, and loves pork.”
“To be sure, vy not "answered the Jew, in no way disconcerted :
he then returned to the charge. “I talk to you as I’d talk to my own
son, and if it was the last vords I had to speak, I'd say, Jack Lips-
comb do justice to yourself and get a votch.”
“Advice is plentiful as sprats,” said the sailor. “Any fool can say,
get a watch; but he isn't such a fool, who shows how it's to be done.”
“My tear friend,” said the Jew, “vait a minute.” Shadrach then
unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a large, yellow, metal watch,
exposed it, with a light laugh, to the sailor.
“It’s a big un,” said Jack Lipscomb, gravely.
“It's a beauty,” exclaimed the Jew; “but you hasn’t seen half,
Jack, look here.” Shadrach then wound up the watch, and the picture
of a ship fixed in the dial-plate, was set in motion, rocking very
regularly over grass-green billows, under which was written the
legend—“Such is life.”
“She carries a good deal of canvas for such a sea,” said the sailor,
glancing at the toy with a purely professional eye.
“To be sure—vonts nothin’,” answered the Jew, casting his gleam-
ing looks in the weather-beaten face of the doomed purchaser.
“Humph 1 I wonder how long them studding-sail booms would
stand in a trough of the sea like that They'd snap like clay-pipes;
if they wouldn't I’m "–
“Never mind, my tear friend,” cried the Jew quickly, “sixpence
vill paint it out. Well, vot do you say to that, Jack f" asked Shad-
rach, now holding the watch to the sailor's eyes, now withdrawing it,
and now turning it in his hand, as though he held a magic mirror to
dazzle and confound the looker's senses. “Wot do you say to that,
Jack º’”
Jack spoke, to the Jew's understanding, a whole volume; albeit he
really uttered not a word. For he slowly wiped his lips with the
cuff of his jacket, the while he gazed at the chronometer ; again he
wiped away, what to the Jew seemed the water rising to the sailor's
mouth, brought thither by strong desire of making that watch his own.
“For six pound with them feathers,” and here the Jew threw an
affected look of contempt upon myself and companions prostrate at
his feet—“the votch shall be yourn.”
“Is it gold "asked Jack.
“Vot vell 1* exclaimed the Jew, and he advanced two indignant
steps towards the drawer, as if about to consign the watch for ever
to its keeping—then paused, and looking sorrowfully up into the face
of Jack Lipscomb, asked him, in most pathetic tones, “vot he thought
of him : *
“No offence, I hope,” said Jack Lipscomb, deferentially.
“As if I’d sell my best friend anything but the best gold. Ha!
Mr. Lipscomb, you don't know me—no, you don’t ; you’ve cut me
clean to the heart; but to show you I bears no malice, I'll take all
the money you have for the votch”—
“Without the feathers ?” asked the sailor.
“No, my tear friend, with the feathers; though they're of no use
to me—quite none; still, for principle, my tear friend, I must have
the feathers.”
Jack turned his tobacco in his mouth, looked at the watch, as the
cameleon fixes a fly, ere with its long thread of a tongue he consigns
it to its jaws, then, throwing forth his right hand, seized the time-
piece, almost immediately emptying his pocket of four pounds,
fifteen shillings.
“You’ve a bargain, Mr. Lipscomb—you've a-vell, bless my heart,
don't go,”—said the Jew, as the knocker smote the street-door—“it’s
only an old acquaintance of yourn, my daughter Miriam.”
Saying this the Jew quitted the chamber, and in two minutes from
his departure, Miriam, a more than plump Jewess, with vast black
eyes, a profusion of black hair (a very net for sailors' hearts), large
rosy lips showing every one of her brilliant white teeth, and her
massive face polished over with smiles, swam into the room.
Poor Jack Lipscomb
This may be a proper place to observe that a sentimental affection
had, for the duration of three past voyages, grown up between Jack
Lipscomb and Miriam Jacobs. If, however, it was not strictly
between them, 'twas all the same—Jack thought it was. There was,
unfortunately, what at first promised to be an inseparable bar to
the happiness of matrimony—namely, the religion of Miriam ; Jack
sticking for it, most lustily, that his wife must be like himself, every
inch a Christian. -
“Ha! Miriam, what a pity it is you're a Jew l’” This was wont
to be the frequent complaint of the orthodox Jack; and at length
Miriam, worked upon by her lover's affection—for sure we are his
many presents had nothing to do with it—promised, after a fair
exercise of thought on the subject, to give up the synagogue.
Miriam Jacobs and Jack Lipscomb are together. Shall I betray
the language of lovers I will not. I will content myself, and I

trust, the reader too, by stating that Miriam (having seen the watch)
promised to become a Christian wife in a week's time ; in token of
which promise, she received the said watch as a gift of her expectant
husband.
Jack Lipscomb, nothing the better for the alcohol sold in the
Minories, quitted the house of Jacobs penniless, leaving me and my
companions—whom he had all but stolen from a barbarian, only to
be tricked in his turn—as the property of the Jew.
As Jack reeled his way towards his ship, Miriam consigning her
jetty locks to the close imprisonment of paper, glanced at the rocking
ship on the watch, and for a moment ceasing to hum a tune, read–
“Such is life.”
RURAL INTELLIGENCE.
(FRom our own coakespondent.)
Swithinville, Australia, Jan. 11, 1843.
I call this part of the world Australia, because compliment, like
charity, should begin at home; and we have as much right to fine names
as the Antipodes. I arrived here by the South Western Railway in safety,
which I attribute to the providential circumstance that the engineer was
a cautious driver; insomuch that, instead of getting to the station at three,
we did not get there till five. Our journey was a pleasant one. In the
same carriage with myself there were two particularly nice young ladies,
who regarded me with admiration ; which, on my companion whispering
to them that I was the First Bandit at Sadler's Wells, was converted into
respect.
This region affords great facilities for the production of jokes; but its
capabilities, from the limited intelligence of the natives, are of small avail.
PUNCH is beginning to make his way here; but his circulation is inferior
to that of the Mark Lane Express, which is much read by the few who
can read at all.
The chief amusement of the natives consists in eating and drinking,
AniMALs stury Ed hirrue.
which also form the principal topics of conversation, not only in general
society, but also between young ladies and gentlemen of an evening.
Beer is much drunk in these parts, and some persons exceedingly so in
consequence.
Much excitement has lately prevailed here on the Town-pump question.
It has been proposed by the Improvement party to erect a new one ; the
existing pump, though there is nothing else the matter with it, being old
and ugly. But this step has been opposed by others as a piece of needless
extravagance, and an innovation besides, at variance with constitutional
principles, and likely to bring on anarchy and irreligion. However it has
been replied to them that as the structure in contemplation is intended to
be a Gothic one, its erection will be a revival of good old English taste,
and that it will be in keeping with the Market Cross into the bargain.
It has been determined, however, on all hands to rail in the shambles,
in order to prevent beggars and other worthless characters from taking
their nightly refuge there from the inclemencies of the skies and the work-
house. It were much to be wished that some measure would also be
adopted to prevent people from sleeping during lectures at the Mechanics'
Institute, which is situated overhead.
The theatre has lately been whitewashed, and the actors are expected
to be so in a short time. This process has agreeably harmonised the
appearance of the building with that of the opposite one ; namely, the
ounty Gaol.
Tinder-boxes are now beginning to be exploded, and congreve-matches
were this morning offered for sale at the door.—Gas has been introduced
here for some little time; but the inhabitants, not being exactly acquainted
with its proper uses, have employed it to light up the south transept of the
cathedral.
The building last mentioned is a memorial of another age, erected by a
race of men very different from the present inhabitants of Swithinville.
It being an ecclesiastical edifice belonging to the nation, abounding in
examples of the most exquisite architecture, and highly calculated to
inspire the visitant with feelings of reverence and devotion, the public, all
but those who will pay to be let in, are with great policy and justice,
rigidly excluded from its interior, except when it is obliged to be open for
service. To witness, in this remote district, so perfect and creditable an
imitation of the liberality of the clergy of St. Paul's and Westminster
Abbey, excited my no small admiration.
There are two regiments of soldiers quartered here, and the formation
of eligible connexions with young officers is extensively calculated on by
mamas with daughters.
P.S.—The average price of ale is 6d. per pot; but it is not worth it.
PROCLAMATION OF A “TAME ELEPHANT.”
LoRd ELLENBoRough will, henceforth, be known as the Sampson of
Indial He vaunts his ministry for having, as its greatest achievement,
carried away “the gates of the temple of Somnauth—the gates of Sandal-
wood l’” If Lord Ellenborough, following up the high deeds of Sampson,
would wish to slay any number of Philistines, his proclamation to the
“Princes and Chiefs of the People of India” proves that he can never be
without the necessary weapon.
The proclamation begins:—
“My Brothers and my Friends,--Our victorious aruny bears the gates of the temple
of Somnauth in triumph from Afghanistan, and the despoiled tomb of Sultan Mahmoud
looks upon the ruins of Ghuznee.”
Lord Ellenborough calls the Princes of India his “brothers.” We
much question whether all of them will feel very proud of their newly-
discovered relative. He winds up his proclamation with the following:-
“May that good Providence, which has hitherto so manifestly protected me, still extend
to me its favour, that I may so use the power now intrusted to my hands, as to advance
your prosperity and secure your happiness, by placing the union of our two countries upon
foundations which may render it eternal.”
Me—me—me ! What strange notions of Providence may possess a
Governor-general of India I Among other poetic matters, the governor
says:–
“The insult of 800 years is at last revenged. The gates of the temple of Somnauth,
so long the memorial of your humiliation, are become the proudest record of your
º glory—the proof of your superiority in arms over the nations beyond the
Indus.
Punch would have much liked to see how vigorously the Governor-
general thrust his tongue in his cheek, having penued the above. “The
insult avenged 1" And so all this bloodshed was only about a pair of
gates 1 All this thunder, as the Jew said, about a little bit of bacon 1
And then the “ your superiority” to the “princes and chiefs of India 1"
Oh, princes, and oh, chiefs . There is a word—a vulgar, yet expressive
one, in English—a word which you may safely use in reply to the Governor-
general, for no man understands its comprehensiveness better, and that
word is—gammon. Moreover, a finer sample of the thing we never met
with than in this same proclamation 1

THE MARKETS.
Is consequence of the wind, cabbages were blown in all directions and
were carried off from the dealers in very large quantities. Poultry which
had been killed for a week began unexpectedly to fly away; and at Hunger-
ford Market, watercress, which is generally low, was forced up so high that
it was found impossible to get it down again. The market-women found
business done in a very unfair way by Boreas over their heads, for he took
off a quantity of articles, and forced a distribution in quarters which the
goods in question were not intended to reach. There was altogether a
reat want of firmness in the markets, and nothing remained stationary.
The quotations were extremelyunsettled, for we saw a ticket labelled “three-
pence a dozen” blown from an apple-stall on to a quantity of geese in the
window of a poulterer. The dealers were unable to stand out, and if they
endeavoured to do so, they found themselves compelled to shift their
ground immediately.

3}untb's “Court QCircular.”
We have again to congratulate the lovers of the high English drama
on its patronage and encouragement by our beloved Queen. Last Wed-
nesday, her Majesty and Prince Albert again went in state to Drury-lane
theatre. It is needless for us to observe that the house was thronged in
every part. Every one of the enthusiastic crowd seemed to feel the
condescension of her Majesty in these repeated assurances of the
interest she takes in one of the noblest glories of her country—the pure
English drama. Happy is it for the present stage, that we have a Queen
who, like her great predecessor Elizabeth, sheds the bounty of her patro-
nage upon a glorious art | Happy the people who, in their hours of
loftiest recreation, can meet and, as it were, mingle with their beloved
sovereign -
The royal party was escorted by a detachment of the Blues, and at
seven o'clock precisely, arrived at the theatre. Messrs. MacREADY and
SERLE, in very handsome court suits, received her Majesty and the
Prince. What a shout greeted their appearance in the boxes | Her
Majesty seemed highly delighted, nay, affected, by the burst of feeling,
which she acknowledged most courteously, most graciously. The national
anthem having been sung, the comedy (never before acted) of Wonders
will never Cease began, and was brought to a triumphant close. The
pantomime terminated the entertainments of the night. As the curtain
descended, the audience insisted upon a repetition of God save the Queen ,
this desire was complied with by the operatic force, all the house joining
lustily in chorus. Her Majesty, again curtseying most graciously, then
withdrew.
We are happy to say that the Queen appeared in the highest health
and spirits. She was dressed in blue satin and white lace; wearing a
small circlet of brilliants on her head ; she also wore the Order of the
Garter. Prince Albert was dressed in a field-marshal's uniform, and we
are glad to say, appeared in excellent health.
How delightful is it to Punch to chronicle events like these—how
delightful to show to Continental nations... that the drama of England must
once more flourish beneath the patronizing smiles of an enlightened and
beloved Queen
DESCRIPTION OF A CHANCERY SUIT.
BY JACOB DRYASDUST, F.S.A.
CHANCERY Suit is one that never just–
it is always too long and too tight for a De-
fendant's notions of propriety and universal
charity; besides which, there is no credit
allowed ; the Bill is sent in with the Suit—
and oh, what a Bill it is
First of all you receive a “Subpoena,” re-
questing you to meet the Queen within four
days, “at Westminster, or wheresoever else
she shall then be ;” and Lord Devon is good
enough to witness that it is all right. You
accordingly make inquiries, and, finding that Her Majesty is at Brighton,
proceed there, firmly believing that she wants to consult you as to the forma-
tion of a New Ministry, or to ask whether a Pension would be acceptable.
You are denied admittance to the palace, clearly in consequence of some
party cabal, which the Premier is at the bottom of ; and you return home,
threatening him with the consequences, and resolving to await some further
communication. This is soon delivered by a gentleman called the “Serjeant
at Arms,” who insists on conveying you to the Fleet, for not obeying the
Subpoena. In vain do you explain the facts of the case; the Serjeant is
inexorable, and so off you go, threatening him also with the consequences.
You then summon an Attorney, who says you are “ in contempt,” and
must therefore “come into Court and purge yourself.” You then peruse
the Plaintiff’s “Bill," and are thunderstruck on discovering that James
Jollands, who cannot speak two sentences grammatically, calls himself
throughout “An Orator.” Exasperated at such a iºn: boast, you
resolve to show him up to the authorities in his true colours; and then,
reading a little further, find that the “orator” calls you a “conspirator,”
with, as he avers, “divers other persons at present unknown"—you are
now comforted with the prospect of an action for libel and tremendous
damages ; finally, the “ orator” winds up by requesting the Lord Chan-
cellor to grant him “relief"—whereupon you hope he will be referred to
the Mendicity Society and presented with a ticket for soup. The “orator”
also declares that if the Chancellor will be good enough to grant him some
“relief,” he “will ever pray.” This promise, coming from a man who,
to your certain knowledge, has not entered a church for the last five years,
us too bad—and you immediately inform the Chancellor of his real
character, and caution him to beware.
–
With virtuous indignation you answer the “orator's "harangue in a
very short and summary way—winding up with a flourishing sentence,
commencing with “without this that there is any other matter or thing
that ”—you then pay eighteen-pence for leave to swear at Jollands in the
“public office,” which you do most emphatically, hoping that your
“answer” may choke him. Jollands, who, like all persons in the
wrong, is horribly abusive, soon sends you a document referring to that
answer, and saying a great deal about “scandal and impertinence.” Yot.
are delighted to find he is stung, and puzzled by learning that “His
Honour the Vice-Chancellor will be moved on Tuesday next by Mr. James
Russell.” Where he will be moved does not appear; neither does it
specify the kind of vehicle to be used. However, you attend at the
appointed time to see the fun, when Mr. Russell “moves.” His Honour's
feelings so much, that his emotion will not allow him to decide the matter,
which he accordingly refers to “Master Richards,” who is about 70 years
old, and therefore as little entitled to that juvenile appellation as any grey-
headed post-boy is to his. Jollands brings in his “charge,” which is
retailed at the rate of three-halfpence for ninety words; and you, in self-
defence, provide yourself with a “ discharge,” which is sold at the same
price. “Master Richards" at last “makes a report" (all young people
love noises), and then you, Jollands, the Six Clerks, the man in the “Petty
Bag Office,” and the Vice-Chancellor, fight the matter out. The perform-
ance concludes with the following interesting tableau vivant and grand
procession :-
The band performing a solo on a muffin-bell.
The “ orator” in a cab, and agony of mind.
Yourself in ditto ditto.
Two tipstaves escorting you to the Fleet.
A detachment of charity-boys from the St. Andrew's School, in
their official costume, highly delighted with the show.
Peripatetic bookseller, with cheap copies of
the Insolvent Debtors’ Act.
Your wife in tears and a slight state of gin-and-water.
Your little boy in ditto ditto, and corduroys.
I have not mentioned that, when any party to a suit dies, a “Bill of
Reviver” has to be filed; and perhaps it is not too much to say that,
wherever the individual may have gone to, he would not willingly come to
life again for the purpose of proceeding with his Chancery suit; –at least
Lord Brougham assures me he never heard of such an event, although he
has known many thousand “Bills of Reviver” put on the file.
Twelfth Night Festivities.
Tuene was a juvenile party in several places on Twelfth Night ; and
while Mr. Snooks entertained a parcel of noisy boys at Number Six, there
was a selection of miscellaneous juveniles over the way at Mr. Dobson's.
The water-rate had been punctually paid up, to prevent any obstruction
to the unlimited supply of negus ; and the matronly Mrs. Snooks had laid
in a cake, for which she had laid out two-and-sixpence. At Mr. Dobson's
there was a degree of parsimony in the festive arrangements; for, instead
of a large cake, there was a terrific assortment of stale buns, surmounted
with a jab of white stuff, and a little shabby bit of green citron. The
characters were inclosed in an envelope adorned by a gorgeºus tableau,
representing her Majesty and Prince Albert receiving from Britannia a
gigantic cake, of which Time was cutting a slice with his scythe, while
Caledonia, with the appropriate motto of Itch dien, was playing with
Hibernia a game at scratch cradle. The juveniles were allowed to indulge
ad libitum in the harmless decoction of hot water and lemon-peel, which
constituted a sort of negative negus, while the parents demolished the
really good things, to preventthem from “disagreeing" with their offspring.

36 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PEEL’s “VELVETEENS.”
The ingenuous Sir Robert has been the victim of a shameful
trick. For ourselves, we have not the slightest doubt that the Corn-
Law Leaguers are at the bottom of the transaction, which we only
hope it is within the reach of Parliament to punish. The conspiracy
displays such subtlety—has in it such a wicked animus—that did we
merely consult our own feelings, we should devote the whole of our
present number to discuss the iniquity, in its every shade of turpi-
tude ; in its depth, length, and width. The careless world, however,
has not the same interest as PUNch in the feelings of a Prime Minister
—has, of course, not the same intimate sympathies with the private
emotions of a politician. We shall therefore narrate, with all our
characteristic brevity, the circumstances of as dark a political con-
spiracy as ever blackened the human heart—will show how the peace
—nay, more the consistency of a Prime Minister, has been aimed at in
his hour of social confidence, threatened in his whole anatomy.
A week or two since, Mr. W. BAR low of Ancoats-vale having—
we are convinced of this truth—by the instigation of the Corn-Law
| League, perfected “some printed velveteens” of a most novel and
beautiful fabric, sent a few yards of his handiwork as a present to Sir
Rob ERT PEE1. Gracious, unsuspecting Minister | No artless milkmaid
on Drayton Manor could have received with less suspicion a bunch of
ribands from Hodge, the carter; albeit given for the basest after-
purposes by the designing clown. Sir Rob ERT gazed upon the
velveteen “made to look like silk,” although of cotton, gazed, and
was lost. (Mr. BARLow has the honesty to allow that one of the
excellences of the fabric is, that it appears much better than it
really is; that it has a glossy, silky outside look, to captivate unthink-
ing eyes; although, indeed, the stuff itself be of an inferior yarn—a
thing of very cotton. Why, believing this, Mr. BAalow should have
thought fit to select such a politician as Sir Rob ERT to patronize his
velveteen, we leave to the man's conscience to answer; and proceed
with our story.) Sir Rob Ent—courteous victim —lost no time in
acknowledging the present of velveteen, and—(how the Corn-Law
League must have chuckled !)—further assured Mr. BARLow, that
Lady PEEL was so delighted with the stuff, that she purposed
“haring a cloak” made of part of it, whilst he, Sir Ron ERT, would
devote the remnant to his own bodily comfort, in some other fashion 1
Reader, pause for a moment, and imagine the smothered laugh
shaking the ribs of the League ! How the master manufacturer
grinned with all his heart and all his soul! Nay, it is said, that feeble
smiles did “shoot and circulate” in the tax-ground faces of the tenants
of Manchester cellars—that the very ghastliness of want was irradi-
ated with the dim sense of a joke played upon the Prime Minister 1
Indeed, everywhere throughout Manchester, laughter abounded. It
is said, the very knockers on the manufacturers' doors were dimpled
with smiles—that the church vanes no longer creaked, but laughed
audibly Wherefore ? Why this exultation at the courtesy of the
most courteous of Prime Ministers ? Why this rudeness of merri-
ment at an act of gentlemanly condescension With mingled feelings
of contempt and pity for our species, we tell the why.
The velveteen was made into a cloak—(this we know from Lady
PEEL's milliner,)—the remainder stuff was worked into trousers for
the Prime Minister—(this we know from Sir Robert's tailor, the
same man who has made our own motley for many years),-when the
fraud, the iniquity, lurking in the fatal gift was discovered.
It appears that some ears of wheat were gracefully worked into the
pattern adorning the velveteen, and further, that the dreaded mono-
syllable “FREE,”—those four damning letters, like tares and poppies,
grew among the corn, thus insidiously presented to the Minister.
Lady PEEL, with the quick feminine eye, discovered the device at
once. Why, then, it may be asked, did so many days elapse ere Sir
Rob ERT returned the stuff—for return it, he did—to Mr. BAR low 1
Ere we answer, we subjoin the missive that accompanied the rejected
velveteen :-
“Drayton Manor, Jan. 7, 1843.-Sir : I was not aware, until to-day, that the specimen
of manufacture which you requested me to accept bore any allusion to matters that are
the subject of public controversy. No mention whatever was made of this in the letter
ou addressed to me; and I thought it would be ungracious to reject what appeared to
e a pure act of civility on your part. I must beg leave to return to you that which I
accepted under an erroneous impression. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, Rob ERT
PEEL.-W. Barlow, Esq.”
Lady PEEL, like an excellent, devoted wife as she is, with a full
knowledge of the wheat, and of those “idle weeds,” the letters
f. r. e. e. that “grew among the sustaining corn,”—ordered her cloak
to be made; and wherefore ? Simply, because she knew that Sir
Robert had, at the last election, used a cloak with some sort of corn-
law device upon it, and that therefore, like a good wife, she could
do no better than follow the example of a virtuous and beloved
husband. How different the case with Sir Robert, the Prime
Minister :
We have no doubt whatever, that as far as a cloak might have
been got out of the stuff for himself, Sir Robert would have had no
objection to retain the velveteen as a provision for future accidents;
keeping it on, or putting it off as the wind might blow, or the sun
might shine; but when once the velveteen was made into trousers,
when once the minister had donned so succinct a garment, it must
become to him a sort of tight-fitting principle, not under any circum-
stances to be cast aside, with the least respect for the usages of
honourable society. It was then Sir Rohe Rt saw the trap that had
been laid for him ; it was then that, looking with an instructed eye
upon the velveteen, he felt the full force of the political plot got up
in a pair of trousers:
“The seed was cursèd that did grow the web,
And it was dyed in mummy, which the Corn Laws
Conserved of broken hearts l''
Such, then, appeared the velveteen presented by Mr. W. BARLow, and
the Prime Minister immediately resolved to put no foot in it.
We hope there is no admirer of Sir Robert who will not feel
grateful for the escape of the Minister. Spells and incantations have
been woven in a web ere now ; and these, we are convinced of it,
lurked in every ear of law-taxed corn.
“See the griesly texture grow,
('Tis of human entrails made,)
And the weights that play below,
Each a starving Briton's head: ”
Might not the velveteen, the produce of Corn-law looms, have been
manufactured from such horrid materials—by such ghastly machinery?
Indeed, we fear it.
And then that fatal word “FREE.” In the Gesta Romanorum there
is a story of a beautiful girl who, having been nurtured upon serpents,
was sent as a slave to a certain king; the monarch kissed the rosy
venom, and straightway died. We have not the slightest doubt that
the word “free” in PEEL's velveteen was composed of serpents—and
that no sooner should the Prime Minister have taken the trousers to
himself, than that the petty reptiles would have grown into boa-con-
strictors, and poor Sir Robert, the unwilling Laocoön of “free”
corn, would, as Minister, have been strangled by opposing principles!
However, thanks to the late sagacity of Sir Rob Eut, our minister
is saved. We have, let us be grateful for it, another plot to add to
the unsuccessful machinations of democrats and knaves. We have
had the Gunpowder Plot—the Rye-house Plot—the Thistlewood
Plot—and now, as a crowning escape—the Velveteen Plot Great,
indeed, would have been the triumph of the League, if the Minister
had donned the insidious trousers, and, taking his seat in them in
the House of Commons, had, without knowing it, based his Ministry
upon—“free” corn 1 Q.

Punch has received a considerable number of letters on the above
subject since the publication of the letter of the Bishop of Norwich, on
the “injustice and evil tendency of pews." Two of these epistles are so
touching, that though his columns are much crowded, Punch must insert
them.
No. I.
MR. Punch,--There is, I find, a revolutionary spirit abroad, threaten-
ing the vested rights of pews—threatening to make no distinction of
persons when under the roof of a church. What sir! are we to lose
our air-stuffed cushions in the family pew—our velvet hassocks, and all
that makes religion dear to us?
In a word, sir, am I to sit among the mob º Am I to be encroached
upon by a willow-chip or five shilling Dunstable
I am yours respectfully,
A THREE GUINEA Bonner.
No. II.
SIR,--I have ever found you a champion of the oppressed—as such I
now address you. I trust I know all Christian observances : . I never miss
a Sunday at church, as John the footman knows, who carries my small
prayer-book after me. I have, sir, ever considered a church—that is, a
respectable church, for of course I make no allusion to meeting-houses-
to be composed only of pews. But, sir, pews are threatened, and I therefore
wish to ask you if the Church is not in danger I see what it will end in ;
if pews are abolished, every respectable family must keep their own parson,
and have service at home; for I ask you, sir, how is it possible that I,
who have always been accustomed to a delicious corner, to myself, can
sit in the same crowd with a mere cotton, or with even a Spitalfields silk :
I remain, your humble servant,
A REAL CAchkuins.

PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER III.-Ali, ABOUT Love.
UPITER now having made
himself happy, next pro-
ceeded to provide for his
family. He made his
brother Neptune lord-lieu-
tenant of the sea, vice
Oceanus, turned out; and
Pluto, also, his father's son,
governor-general of the In-
fernal regions. His sister,
Ceres, he appointed lady
patroness of the agricul-
tural interest. These
arrangements, and some
others, having been com-
pleted, it occurred to him
that his own blessedness,
which had hitherto been
single, might be advantage-
ously doubled. He had
another sister, Juno, or,
to speak more respectfully, Miss Juno, whose beauty was so striking,
that it would have knocked you down ; and for whom, considering
that her face was her fortune, he had made no special provision.
Of her he became passionately enamoured ; but her bosom was all
ice, and the difficulty was how was he to break it !
When a man goes courting, he generally gets up an appearance.
He sometimes makes a buck of himself, occasionally a sheep, and
not unfrequently a goose. Our divinity changed himself into a
cuckoo. He then raised a storm, and took refuge from it, cold and
shivering, in Juno's bosom. Now, that locality being in a twofold
sense a region of snow, he must have got, conversely speaking, out
of the frying-pan into the fire But no matter. The case of Jupiter
was like that of the Russian, who ices to warm his frost-bitten nose.
And Juno's resembled that of the frozen liquid; for she melted with
pity: from which, by an easy transition, she modulated into the
warmer sentiment. The marriage was celebrated, without delay,
with the most imposing pageantry and splendour, for which the
Olympic machinery afforded great facilities. Cards were issued to
all the gods, to mankind, and to the brutes; which last, with the
exception of the Ass (who admired the parade) made fun of the
whole affair; for which piece of impertinence they were condemned
to be sacrificed.
For a time Jupiter and Juno lived in the undisturbed enjoyment of
domestic bliss. An event, however, shortly occurred which proved,
subsequently, the source of various mutual disagreements; rather
funny, perhaps, but to the feeling heart very painful to think upon.
The immortals, whose numbers Juno had considerably increased,
were reclining one day upon their easy thrones, sipping nectar and
smoking cheroots. All were present except his Excellency the Lord
Lieutenant of the Sea, whose absence was rather wondered at, as he
seldom missed a court day, particularly when there was grog going
on. His Majesty, Jupiter, his arm encircling the waist of his Queen,
and his lips in approximation with her ear, was affectionately tempt-
ing her to drink a little more. “Come, girl,” said the King of gods
and men; “come, it will do you good. Hebe, pour out another glass
for your mama.” “No, Jupiter, thank you, I had rather not,”
returned Juno. “Do, Judy,” urged the Monarch. “Now, sir.”
replied the goddess, slapping his arm, “I won't have you call me
Judy.” “Do what I tell you, then,” said Jupiter, playfully pulling
her ear. She spoke not, but turned her large full eyes upon his.
Jupiter looked as if he were in Heaven; where, in fact, he was.
Unable to contain himself, he uttered an inarticulate sound expres-
sive of delight, as Mr. Farren does in Sir Peter Teazle, and convul-
sively poked her with his forefinger in the waist. “Have done you
teaze,” she eried, but evidently as pleased as Punch ; whereupon
Jupiter did what he was told not to do, again, and gave her a kiss
into the bargain.
This edifying scene of conjugal affection was suddenly interrupted
by a noise of conch-shells and boatswains' whistles below, followed
by a loud call of “ House ahoy!” the vocalist evidently bawling
through his hands. “Here he is at last !” was the general cry, and
in another moment in staggered Neptune; he was greeted with
deafening applause. “How are you, old boy?” said Jupiter. “Pretty
well, thank you,” answered Neptune “How are you, governor t”
“Middling,” responded the Sovereign. “But I say: who is that
beautiful Nymph that you have brought in your train "
“Aha!” cried Neptune, looking very sly with his forefinger applied
to the side of his nose, “what! you've caught sight of her already, have
you ? Shiver my timbers your Majesty has sharp eyes. Avast,
there, you Tritons; stand aside, will you, you lubbers! There. Did
you ever any of you see such a splendid little craft in all your born
days I See how trim she is about the bows, and how matty about the
stern; and there 's a figure-head for you ! Then only look at the
rigging. Ye ho! there, lass, do you hear? Come forward, VENUs.”
With a smiling though downcast look, and face suffused with a
roseate blush, the Nymph, gracefully ambling, advanced. “See how
beautifully she steers,” cried Neptune; “watch the action of the
rudder 1" She did, indeed, move on like a little duck, in her own
element. A murmur of admiration ran through Olympus. “I say,
Pluto,” said Momus, jogging him and winking his eye—“eh I say—
eh " Pluty nodded approvingly. “Isn't she sweetly pretty f" asked
Ceres. “Oh, yes 1” answered Hebe.
Having approached to the throne of Jupiter, the lovely stranger
assumed that elegant attitude which Phidias or Praxiteles, whoever
it was who made her Medicean effigy, has rendered so deservedly
celebrated.
The monarch gazed upon the beautiful being with a mixture of
astonishment and delight. “And where,” he asked, “young lady, did
you drop from t”
“Nowhere, Sir,” she answered in a gentle voice.
“Ye gods,” cried Jupiter, appealing to the company, “what music!
Come, you little puss " he continued, elevating her chin, “look up.
I say, master Neptune, what have you to say about this damsel ?”
“Explain, Neptune, explain,” resounded on all hands.
“Mayhap,” said Neptune, turn-
ing his quid, “his majesty there
knows as much about the matter
as I do. But that’s neither here

jorum of nectar, will you?” So saying, he sat down.
All this while Jupiter was feasting his eyes on the charms of the
lovely wonder, not exactly to the satisfaction of Juno, who was
beginning to look a little uncomfortable, which his Majesty observing,
discontinued his gaze. Then, turning to the Queen, he proposed to
her to adopt the fair Venus for a daughter, and to get her, if possible,
comfortably married. The latter part of the proposal allayed Juno's
suspicions; she had not the slightest objection to it, she said, and
would behave to her as if she were her own child. So she beckoned
her to approach, and kissed her, and called her a dear, and told her
that for the future in addressing her, Juno, she was to say, Mama:
And then Jupiter informed her that she was to consider herself
thenceforth as the Goddess of Beauty.
Hereupon Venus, amid much applause, took her seat among the

other deities. She was placed next to Mars, who, it was observed,
was whispering and talking to her a great deal all the evening. It
was likewise noticed that Vulcan kept looking at her very hard :
though, whenever their eyes met, she turned up her nose at him.
The new goddess was voted a great acquisition; and, for a little
while, her addition to the Olympic circle was productive of unmingled
delight to all parties. But this state of things was not to last. One
morning, to the astonishment of everybody, Venus came down to
breakfast followed by a little winged boy. “How now, Veny?” cried
Jupiter, “what, have you started a tiger ?” “Oh, no 1 papa; this is
my little boy,” she replied. “Your little boy P’ exclaimed all in
amazement. “My little boy,” she answered, very coolly; and, when
pressed with further questions, only laughed. The conclusion of
everybody was, that she had been secretly married, and Jupiter,
determined to get at the truth, demanded in turn of each of the gods
whether he was the sly dog of a husband. Vulcan manfully came
forward, and declared that he was ; adding, “Don’t you think the boy
my very picture ?” Now Vulcan was as swarthy as a Moor, hump-
backed, bandy-legged, and lame, in consequence of a misfortune which
he had in infancy. The gods, therefore, grinned, and said, “Very.”
Jupiter, notwithstanding Vulcan's avowal, determined that the
marriage between his son and Venus should be solemnised again and
in public. Thus Venus became Mrs. Vulcan, but everybody still
called her Venus.
Now—would you believe it? the dissensions which afterwards took
place between Juno and her husband were brought about by this
little boy of Venus's, who was named by his godmother, CUPID. And
a pretty deal of mischief he did, and continues to do besides.
MoRAL-Beware of Love; particularly after you are married.
THE “BUTTON” AND “PEACOCK.”
THE Chinese Commissioner has sent in his “Report” to his Im-
perial master, of the demands of the “barbarian” English, and a
very pretty official document it is. The Commissioner, having
dwelt upon the probable means of paying the 21,000,000 dollars
“begged” (begged is the word) by Sir HENRY Pottingen, says “in
time money may be looked for, for the purchase of honours, buttons
and peacocks' feathers tº We think Sir Robert Peel might take a
hint from this. . With a falling revenue, why not sell honour to any-
body who would take a good lumping penn'orth of it ! We are
sure there are hundreds, with money to spare, who have by no
means souls above buttons; whilst, for peacocks' feathers, there are rich
noodles with heads especially designed for such adornment. Wealth,
mere wealth, requires a distinguishing order of merit; and the order
of “the button and the peacock” would be a most fitting decora-
tion. For instance, the “button” would, in its size and substance,
admirably typify the hearts of the rich advocates of the poor-law;
whilst the plume of the peacock would illustrate their selfish pride
and mindless egotism.

At
THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
CHAPTER III.-SoME MoRF PARTICULARs of the spangle LAcquERs,
AND THEIR DRAWING-ROOM.
WE have stated that our friends the Lacquers reside in a very
fashionable part of town—indeed, they know nothing of the other
districts of London; which is the more remarkable because Mr.
Lacquer amassed his fortune in those less favoured localities, from
soap, gin, tallow, rags, or something equally interesting, by a process
of alchemy, which leaves all the old philosophers far behind. But of
course all this is scarcely ever recollected by their friends; who, on
first making their acquaintance, are so dazzled by their display, that
they are, for a time, blind to everything beyond it, until their eyes
get accustomed to the glare, when they have been often observed to
have recovered their usual vision; and sometimes look deeper than
they ought. For artificial display is dangerous to have anything to
do with ; and resembles a Chinese firework—very grand and be-
wildering at first sight, but if kept up too long its coruscations are
found to proceed only from the revolutions of a few bits of coloured
glass shining with a borrowed light.
The house in which the Lacquers reside is, as old Pepys would
say, “pleasant to behold ;” and the street door appears to have put
on a suit of brass armour—there being plates of the visitors' bell, and
the domestics’ bell, and the kitchen bell, as well as the family name
of the Lacquers, and a command that you will ring also, with other
amusing and ornamental tablets—possibly for the purpose of being
spelt for entertainment whilst you are waiting at the door. All these
things, however, are great improvements upon the habits of our fore-
fathers, in whose time the best way to get into a house was simply to
knock at the door. An old lady—a friend of ours also—who lives
opposite ; a simple quiet body, whose idea of enjoying life consists in
sitting at the window for a certain time every day in a grand cap and
watching her neighbours, has informed us that whichever bell you
ring the same person always appears to answer it. So that the whole
process resembles that gone through with the toy used to gamble
with for gingerbread-nuts, at fairs, where you pull different strings at
each attempt to improve your luck, but find the same puppet always
make its appearance. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion
that these various bells have for their object, not so much the division
of labour amongst the domestics, as to advertise the inmates when
any one is going to make a call—a sort of prompter's signal to
“clear !” which means that they must get into their places, and
dispose of all unseemly properties before the drama begins. And
this brings us to one of those excellent pieces of advice which we are
in the constant habit of presenting to our readers. Whenever you
make a morning call at a house, never, inadvertently, or with the air
of a careless lounger, turn up the sofa cushions: or you will be certain
to make both yourself and your friends uncomfortable, by the
unexpected display of some funny object or another, that “those
tiresome children must have hidden there.”
Having determined, with much careful investigation, which bell
you are to pull, you are presently admitted by a footman. But as
it is too much trouble for that particular domestic to go up to the
drawing-room with you, he walks you to the end of his beat at
the foot of the staircase, and there gives you into the charge of
another domestic, in whose custody you ascend. Arrived at the
drawing-room, the footman gives you a chair, pokes the fire, puts
some coals on, tells you his mistress will be down directly, and leaves
France or stolen from the manufactory of Bentley and others!”
you to your own meditations.

In walking about the drawing-room at the Lacquers', the chief rule
to be observed is to keep your coat-tails under your arm, for fear of
knocking over the curiosities crowded into the room. There are
such wonders of nature and art displayed upon every practicable point
of furniture, that the imagination of the spectator is insensibly
called back to Wardour-street, and Howell & James's. The card-
basket is also arranged with much care, for the inspection of visitors,
although with an apparent indifference. The “wedding cards,” if
the originals of them chance to be presentable persons, are placed at
top—the “return thanks” and “P.D.A.'s" underneath ; and the
small visiting connexions burrow down to the bottom of the china
receptacle in conscious retirement.
A copy of the Morning Post lies on the table, amidst a chaos of
periodicals, albums, showily-bound religious books, and papier mâché
writing-cases, with portraits of Cérito and golden-tailed cockatoos on
the covers. The Spangle Lacquers take in the Post, on account of
its high gentility. It is so pleasant to learn from its columns what
the great people are doing—when the Earl and Countess of Varnish-
ville left Mivart's Hotel for a tour in Hyde Park; when the Misses
Fitzpump will open their private gaming-tables, for the season, in
Grosvenor-square; and the usual routine of other delightful infor-
mation so necessary to the existence of West-end ladies'-maids who
are enamoured of retainers in those noble families whose important
actions are herein chronicled. Indeed the refined style of this
elegant journal almost tempts us to imagine that its editor is a
faylike and lovely thing of gentlest blood (or rather with rondeletia
running in his veins instead of the coarse vital fluid), nourished upon
the aroma of costly hot-house flowers; and who dies upon inhaling a
common atmosphere, like the puppy of the Grotto del Cane, whilst
ordinary vulgar people receive no injuries from it.
But the chief amusement for the morning-visitor in-waiting is
Miss Lacquer’s album. It is a very handsome book, with light pink
a DESIGN. Fort an ALBUM-
and light green, and light blue, and buff, and tea-coloured pages—a
literary drawing-room rat-trap—which no one dares peep into with-
out being compelled to paya visit to his Eminence, Mount Parnassus.
Then there are such sweet rice-paper blue butterflies, and tinted pea-
cocks; such eccentric flowers and carefully pencilled Turks; such
shilling Byron Beauties, and half-crown Flowers of Loveliness; and
such a beautiful gipsy at the first page begging for scraps, that it is
quite refreshing to think there are still such lovely Bohémiennes in the
world. And the literary portion of this costly book is very pretty
indeed. There are the celebrated lines beginning
“Black eyes most dazzle at a ball,”
written with a crowguill; as well as some verses about “A Moss
Rose;” and an affecting sonnet “Upon hearing my first-born sneeze
in his sleep.” There are also some verses about “My littlefoot-page.”
which are whispered as the production of Miss Lacquer, but which
do not mean the small boy in buttons attached to the establishment;
and many other exquisite morceaux tending in the highest degree to
assist genteel reason and reflection. Once Mr. Lacquer brought
home a number of Punch with him, which was immediately hustled
away with singular speed, none of the family being able to see any-
thing in it; but putting it down as a very strange work, and not at
all suited to the intellect of people like themselves. And we cordially
agree with them—it certainly was not. Any person of moderate
capacity, comparing the refined poetry of the Annuals with the ordi-
nary matter of the periodical in question, will soon see the difference.
We have been so long looking about the room that we have
scarcely time left for an interview with this delightful family. But
they are such entertaining people that we must give them a chapter
to themselves; and when we have finished, we are confident that our
readers will hold them in similar esteem.
A DRAMATIC BET.
Once upon a time a Hebrew manager of a London playhouse met
Vamply, the playwright. “Mr. Wamply, you're the werry man as I
vonted to see.” “What's the matter, sir!” asks Vamply: “ anything,
sir, in my way?”, “Vy, vot I vonted vos this. How many years ago is
it since you writ The Blood-stained Atchet 2" “How many years, sir?”
“Yes, how many years 1" “Why, sir, since that production was first
made known, is exactly ten years.” “Well, I said so—and Lazarus vonted
to lay me five pound it was twelve. You're certain, Mr. Wamply, it's
only ten ?” “Most certain, sir.” “Thank'ee, Mr. Wamply, thank’ee ;
good bye, I'll go and lay the bet now!”
BALLADS OF THE BIRDS.
THE BALLAD OF THE GOOSE.
Thry may talk as they will of the golden canary,
But boldly I ask, of such birds where's the use
No 1 I'd rather by far—nor my note will I vary-
Be just what you find me—a guzzling young goose.
I'll own that the goldfinch in song is delicious,
And fairer to look at-Ah, there I agree;
But stuff us with onions, et cetera, and dish us,
Oh, then can the goldfinch be equal to me !
I’ll own that the duck, when with sauce you embellish,
Is a bird that the gourmand would never despise ;
And capon, I know, when some ham gives a relish,
Is also by epicures counted a prize.
The turkey, when truffles are used for the stuffing,
A savoury notion will often produce ;
But, oh! without any extraneous puffing,
The bird which bangs all other birds is the goose.
Ay even the poet, my praises inditing,
Must own that I'm worthy his pages to fill,
For he at this moment could not go on writing,
Unless the kind goose had presented a quill.
“ Good bird, thou art right:” thus the poet addresses
The creature that causes at present his strains ;
“For many an author, when writing, possesses. py
Not only the quill of the goose—but the brains.

PUNCH*S POLITICAL ECONOMY.
INTRoductory DeFinitions.
Political economy is the science by which nations and individuals
acquire wealth, or, in other words, become rich ; and this accounts for some
of the principal political economists being the richest —humbugs of this
or any other time. -
Wealth is that which we can exchange for something else, and conse-
quently an old pair of pantaloons Inust be considered as wealth when
exchanged for a goldfinch, and the men who walk about with birds on
their fingers, offering them for old trousers, are consequently practising
political economy.
Air is not wealth, because we cannot get change for it, though there
is such a thing as “change of air :” and it is this ambiguity of terms which
has probably misled the government, who think that what is capable of
being changed, must gain something in exchange, and is consequently
wealth ; so, looking at air in that light, they tax it accordingly.
A shirt is wealth if it is only changed once a month, but the fact of its
being changed at all gives it, according to political economists, a certain
or an uncertain value.
OF WALUE.
That quality of an object which renders it capable of gratifying our
desires is value: therefore, if we desire to catch a flea, and the flea is caught,
it becomes valuable—at least in the eyes of political economists.
Before political economy came into vogue, it was thought that the value
of anything was exactly what it would fetch ; but this doctrine is ex-
ploded, for if we send a servant to fetch a pound of mutton chops, we are
not to consider the chops as the value of the servant. A valuable dog will
fetch a penny ball if we throw it to him, but we cannot say that the dog is
only worth what he will fetch, for this would make him worth only a
penny, and (allowing for the wear and tear of the ball) perhaps nothing.
Intrinsic value is different from exchangeable value. The former exists
in an article to which nothing is added by human labour. The play of
Hamlet is of intrinsic value, inasmuch as it affords us gratification to read
it ; but sometimes when human labour is added to it, as when Mr. Charles
Kean toils through the part, it loses its power of delighting us, and conse-
quently its value is gone, by being mixed up with human labour—including
the labour of the actor, and the labour of those who sit out his per-
formance.
It is, however, admitted by all political economists, that labour in
general gives value to that which it is bestowed upon ; and of two similar
things, that is the most valuable which has been the subject of the greatest
amount of labour. By this doctrine, it would appear that a cab-horse,
which requires great activity from the driver to make it go, is a more
valuable ereature than a horse that goes without any labour at all. This |
seems at first a startling proposition, but it must be evident that a horse
which cannot run away with you, and endanger your life, is more valuable
than one that may, at least in the long run; and it is, after all, the long
run, or for going to great lengths, that the doctrine of the political econo-
mists is best adapted.
If it takes Sir Robert Peel a week to make a single joke as good as one
it is just as easy for a pickpocket to steal a gold watch as a silver one,
though it is certainly less difficult to procure iron, which is often thrown
into the bargain, in the shape of handcuffs, after gold or silver may have
been obtained in the manner hinted at.
Value is however regulated by supply, and when there is too much
of a thing it falls in its price, while the reverse occurs when there is too
little. Water is valuable when it comes into the cistern in moderation,
and we cheerfully pay the water-rate (if we happen to have the money by
us for doing so); but when it runs in at the roofs or inundates the kitchens,
it loses its value altogether. This admirable rule of political economy
would seem to reverse the principles of arithmetic, for while the latter
teaches that twenty must be worth more than one, the former opens our
eyes to the fact—the politico-economical fact—that one is worth more
than twenty.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPTER III.-FLAMINGO, THE COURT FEATHER-MERCHANT-THE
DUKE-PINE-APPLE-Birth OF PRINCE OF WALES.
MY next remove was far westward. I became the property of
feather-merchant to the court; or, as the tradesman himself delighted
to blazon in gold letters over his shop-door, “Plumassier to their
Majesties.” I confess I felt myself somewhat humiliated by the ill-
report of Mr. Flamingo, who, in his dealing with Miriam Jacobs—on
this occasion ambassadress from her sire in the Minories—protested
that I was the inferior article of the whole lot; and that no pains of
cleaning and dressing would ever enable me to return sixpence to my
purchaser. This melancholy feeling, however, gave place to better
hopes, when, on the departure of the Jewess—Miriam had been
compelled by the hard chaffering of the feather-merchant to throw a
green monkey into the bargain, for the especial delectation of the
youngest Miss Flamingo—my new master selected me from my com-
panions, and, shaking me tenderly, asked the wife of his bosom, “if
I wasn't a perfect beauty : " This pleasing flattery was, moreover,
adequately responded to by Mrs. Flamingo, who, with glistening eyes,
declared me “quite a love . "
I have already said, Mr. Flamingo was feather-seller to the court
of Great Britain. He felt, intensely felt, the surpassing importance
of his position. His very soul seemed plumed with the dignity.
Blence, like my parent ostrich, he would, when full of the conscious-
mºss of his greatness, scarcely tread the shop-floor, but, raised upon
the wings, or winglets, of his self-conceit, half-fly, half-walk. It was
the religion of Peter Flamingo, that the whole moral and social con-
dition of man depended solely upon feathers. Nay, I believe it to
have been his inner-creed that plumes were not so much designed
for kings and nobles, as that potentates and peers were especially
sent into this world for plumes. I say, inner-creed; because my
experience of mankind has convinced me that there are some people
who have an outside faith—covering a faith in the same way that
jugglers have a box within a box, the last in its small sanctuary gene-
rally containing the conjured shilling. When Peter Flamingo read
or heard of the possible perfectibility of man, I am certain that man
appeared to him like a Poland cock, with a natural crest of feathers.
With this faith, it was consequent that Mr. Flamingo should pay
profoundest reverence to those privileged to wear the artificial
glory, such reverence being at the prime cost of those to whom fate
had rigorously denied that proud advantage. Hence, the reader can
imagine the separate places of the Marchioness of Mannaville, born
to the right of a plumed coronet, and of Patty Butler, also born to the
duty of dressing feathers—can conceive their separate conditions in
the mind of Mr. Flamingo. The Marchioness was a creature apart
—a glory to be numbered with the stars of heaven ; the feather-
dresser, a mere weed of earth, millions of miles away from that
starry presence. Therefore, like a good penny-turning Chaldean,
Flamingo thought, to properly worship the star, he must tread upon
the weed.
Mr. Flamingo, in the observance of this faith, did at times forget
the mere naked meaning of words, substituting another set of syl-
lables for the only set rightly called for by the occasion. In home-
spun phrase, Flamingo was a liar: but then his lies, if I must call
them so, were used to the very best advantage. Ile dressed himself
in falsehood, but then he looked all the better for it. He made
positive gold-leaf of his untruths, which cast a lustre on him, covered,
as he would still be covered, with borrowed radiance. Being feather-
seller to the Court, he was, of course, intimate with the whole peerage.
He would, at a moment, cast you up the number of dimples to be
found in the cheeks and chins of Countesses—would minutely describe
to you the hangings and furniture of every best bedroom of every
nobleman's mansion in the kingdom, he, in the course of his glorifying
profession, having been an honoured guest thereat. With him true
friendship was a flower that was only to be plucked from the gardens
of the nobility; and this flower Flamingo was for ever twisting be-
tween his lips, or sporting in his button-hole. “My friend, the
Marquis,”—“My most excellent friend, the Duke,”—“My worthy
acquaintance, the Baronet !” Thus continually spoke Flamingo;
and so speaking, he thought he let fall diamonds and rubies from his
tongue for the world to wonder at.
A man with so many, and with such friends, had of course frequent
evidences that friendship was not what the poetic cynic calls it, only
“a name.” . By no means; to Flamingo, it was sometimes a tur-
|bot—sometimes a turkey. His friend the Marquis would now and
then appear upon the feather-dresser's table in the not less attrac-
tive though twin shape of a brace of pheasants: his most excellent
friend the Duke, has smoked upon the board, in the solid beauty of
a haunch of venison. Of all men in the world, Flamingo would have
been the last to deprive the peerage of their proxies. More : how
often did some exalted dowager appear in a rich and candied pre-
serve—how often some earl's daughter, the last out of the season,
sent a basket of peaches, ripe and pulpy as her own lips ? At least,
if these gifts were really not made by the exalted people praised by
Flamingo for their generosity, it was not the fault of the feather-
dresser; no, the more his virtue to preach up the necessity of libe-
rality to the world, even by apocryphal examples of true benefi-
cence.
It was sometime after I had passed from the hands of the feather-
merchant, that I heard a story illustrative of this his theoretical
virtue. As, however, I may not find a fitter place than the present
for the story, I will here narrate it; the more especially as the
occurrence took place whilst I was yet Flamingo's property, albeit
then ignorant of the history I have to speak of.
Peter Flamingo gave a dinner. I should say he rather presided at
a dinner given to him ; for there was no dish upon the table that
might not have borne above it the banner of the noble house from
which it emanated. Believe Flamingo, and the banquet was no other
than a collection of offerings made to him by the English nobility :
he could have pointed out the representatives of the peerage, from
the noble who came to cut throats with William the Conqueror at
Hastings, to the last baron ennobled for cutting the throats of his
constituents at Westminster. How Flamingo's guests—benevo.
lently picked out by him from the very mob of tradesmen—won-
dered at the banquet; how they praised their host for his high con-
nexions; and how they hated him
The dinner passed off with excessive cordiality. The wine, every
drop of it from the cellars of the peerage, made at all events a
passing call at the hearts of the drinkers, ere it mounted into their
heads; and all was sincerity and noisy happiness
The dessert appears. Was there ever seen such magnificent pine
apples Flamingo drops his eye proudly yet lovingly upon the fruit
and says with soft voice, so modulated that not one man shall lose
one syllable—“Ha! my dear Duke of Diddleton—he is indeed a
friend; all—all from his own gracious pinery !”
“Bless my heart 1 Well, you are a lucky man " cries Brown.
“Was there ever such a duke in the world f" exclaims Johnson.
“It’s a shame to put a knife into 'em ;” remarks Field, directing
his looks sharpened to a very keen edge, on the crown of the ducal
gift.
“Pooh pooh what are pines grown for, if not to be eaten ?” cries
Flamingo, handling his knife, looking full at the pines, but only
looking at them.
“Don’t cut the duke's gift—it’s a shame ! I wouldn't touch a bit
of it,” says Robinson; “but there’s a couple of little ones, there,
that—” "
“Well, if you prefer them—they're not so large; but their flavour
is delicious ! They were sent by—yes, I think by him—by Sir
| Harry Bargate, a baronet of the last batch : will you venture { *

No 8].

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And without waiting for a reply, Flamingo cuts into very—very
small pieces the smallest pine.
And still all proceeds with increasing felicity. The bottle goes
round and round, and at length the heads of the drinkers begin
obediently to follow it. The laugh increases—the shout swells—and
all 's boisterous merriment. -
Brown jumps to his legs. “It’s no use,” he cries; “I’ve fought
against it long enough : I must have a cut at the Duke.” So saying
Brown seizes the largest pine, and, with furious precipitancy, strikes
his knife into it; Flamingo's blood running cold to his very toes.
“And so must Iſ” cries the no less drunken Johnson, following
Brown's example.
“And II" screams Field ; and the third knife enters the Duke's
third pine.
“And I, too,” shouts Robinson, rising to commit execution; but
Flamingo, restored by the third attack to something like consciousness,
snatches up the pine, and Robinson, missing his mark, falls sprawling
on the table.
The charm of the night is broken; Flamingo looks sulky; the
guests, a little sobered by a sense of their attack upon the Duke's
gifts, depart.
“We were wrong,” says Brown, “to demolish those pines; for, if
Flamingo had had to buy 'em, what must they have cost f"
“I wonder what's the market-price now " says Johnson—“let’s
ask.” And as he spoke, he turned into a fashionable fruiterer's.
“What's the price of those pines f"
“Three guineas each, sir,” answered Melon, the fruiterer.
“They're very small,” said Johnson. “Have you none bigger ?”
“Yes, four—very large; five guineas each. But I can't shew them
now ; for the fact is, they're out on hire for a night to my neighbour,
Mr. Flamingo "
And so, the Duke of Diddleton was Melon, the shopkeeper; and
so Flamingo paid fifteen guineas (he saved one pine) for a lie, cer-
tainly, if there be any means of testing the value of lies, not worth
half the money.
This little banquet took place on the 11th of August, 1762. With
much melancholy did Peter Flamingo rise on the 12th. His bile,
however, was blown away by the Park guns, for they announced the
birth of Queen Charlotte's first-born—the Prince of Wales.
The “rudiments of an angel” were begun in George the Fourth.
Did Peter Flamingo rejoice at the birth of a Prince of Wales I think
so ; but certain I am his “his heart leapt up” at the fine prospect
for—Feathers.
SONGS OF THE SESSIONS.
THE CHAIRMAN'S SONG.
I'M the chairman of the Sessions,
And patiently I sit,
Enduring the digressions
Which counsel mean for wit.
But while I seem attending
To all their fume and vapour,
My eyes are slyly bending
Upon the morning paper.
But when the time is nearing
For summing up the case,
From my spectacles the smearing
I silently efface.
My charge I slowly utter,
And deal in wise expressions ;
Odd's bacon, beans and butter,
I'm Chairman of the Sessions!
“SWEETS TO THE SWEET.”
According to the French papers, there is a double treaty going on with Brazil; by
which the Prince de Joinville is indirectly asked if he'll take his º; (like an old spinster
at a tea-party) “with or without sugar 7”
• In The Yorkshireman of Jan. 14, 1843, is the report of a meeting of “The Stockton
Mechanics’ Institute,” William Bailey, Esq., in the chair. The Chairman, in intro-
ducing the Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, said—“Reverence in the son the future
man, and in the prince the future king.” Destroy not in either royal scion the rudiments
of an angel.”
PUNCH*S POLITICAL ECONOMY.
OF PRODUCTION.
PRoduction is the art by which we give to any object its particular
value, and it is by the production, or the way in which it is produced, or
rather the getting up, that an attempt is made to give value to certain
dramatic pieces. Production and value are, however, not identical ; for
. are many productions which must be regarded as entirely without
value.
Man, say the political economists, can neither create nor annihilate any-
thing. Yet the Whigs, who were economists in a certain way, are said
to have created a deficit, while the Tories take credit for having annihilated
the Melbourne ministry. To annihilate, means, literally, to bring to
nothing; and considering how many fine schemes are brought to nothing
by their various concoctors, we can scarcely concur in the doctrine of the
political economists, that man cannot annihilate anything.
CAPITAL.
The term capital is one which political economists, and other humbugs,
are very fond of using; and, indeed, they never let an opportunity slip
for laying hold of it. Capital is of various kinds, and it is sometimes a
substance, while it is at other times a shadow. The capital of joint stock
companies may be defined as “material turned by labour into a product;"
that is to say, when labour is employed, and something is doing or
somebody done, the product is capital. A printer's materials come under
this head ; and his types must be included, though we leave it to the
political economist to say how a fount of lower-case letters can be con-
sidered as capital.
OF EXCHANGE.
GENTLEMEN of The Juny.
Every man finds it to his interest to labour at one kind of production,
but he wants things that he cannot produce himself, and this leads to
exchange. Thus, a gentleman who lives on his wits, is compelled to be
witty when asked to pay for anything that may have been supplied to
him i and some people exchange for valuable goods certain documents
called bills of exchange, which they part with readily—being of no use to
any ore. The shoemaker must eat and drink and clothe himself, which
he cannot do with shoes alone; so the butcher lets him have a steak
(which is sometimes in the nature of leather) in return for repairs done
to boots, &c.
DISTRIBUTION.
Every product goes through several hands, and by the labour employed
it obtains value. This is called Distribution ; and the more hands it goes
through the greater is the value. According to this, a shilling is more
valual le when distributed among thirty people than among ten, and it
may certainly be said to go much farther in the former than in the latter
case. A pin passes through many hands, and runs into several fingers
before it finally sticks in the pincushion. Every one who has assisted in
making a pin has a right to a share of the profit that is made upon the
pin when it is sold ; and, according to the political economists, a register
should be kept, in which an account should be kept of every pin that is
made, and the owners to whom it is transferred, so that the manufacturer
may know what parties to go upon to obtain remuneration for his labour.
This is the true theory of distribution, as laid down by political econo-
mists. A rule so elaborately laid down, few will have the courage to
take up.
WHIMS OF THE WIND.
Among other freaks, the wind passed a boy's cap toll free through the
carriage gate of Waterloo Bridge. So much politeness was enforced by
the wind, that all persons put their hands to their hats on meeting it. The
raising of the wind had a great effect on bills, particularly play-bills, and
no holders of sufficient weight and substance could be found for them.
The whole business seemed to partake in a great degree of what is called
kite-flying.
why are washerwomen the greatest navigators of the globe 7-Bocause they are con-
tinually crossing the line, and running from pole to pole.

PUNCH AND S R R. PEEL.
The following correspondence has passed between Sir R. Peel and our-
selves. We lay it before the Nation without a word of comment.
LETTER I.
“Wellington Street.
“SUR,--I am instrukted by my hemplowyers the purpietors of “Punch"
to transmit you a koppy of the wurk.
“I am, Sur,

“Boy Dick.”
LETTER JI.
“SIR. R. PEEL presents his compliments to Mr. Boy Dick—a relative, it
is presumed, of Mr. Quentin Dick—and has great pleasure in accepting a
Punch at his hands.”
Our boy having been rather elated at the Premier's reply could not
refrain from talking the matter over in the presence of some other
juveniles; and the urchins referred to some of the illustrations and
pencillings in which Sir R. Peel is a conspicuous figure. The boys
laughed heartily at the joke, and the affair having reached the Premier's
ears, the following letter was written :-
“Downing Street.
“SIR. R. Peel presents his compliments to Mr. Boy Dick, and returns
the Punch, which, when he (Sir R. Peel) accepted it, he had no idea had
any reference to anything that was passing.”
The following is the reply:— “Behind The CountER.
“Wellington Street.
“The Boy Dick begs to say that the parcel he sent had no refer-
ence to nothink passing except the Homnibus, which was passing at the
time, and which the Boy Dick sent the Punch by.”
When the proprietors of Punch were made aware of this correspond-
ence, the Boy, who had shown himself a juvenile Talleyrand, was pre-
sented with a grey Taglioni, which he wears to this day, as an emblem of
his diplomatic cunning and cleverness.

“Lord Liverpool was an excellent domestic character—a fond husband,
a good master, and an excellent moral character. George the Fourth did
not like him as a man, because he felt a fear of him, from his firmness, for
he would never yield any important point to the King, nor suffer him to in-
terfere in his particular province. The King used to say, as soon as he went
out of the room, “What an awkward creature that is '' and then he mimickea
all his peculiarities, so as to produce a laugh against Lord Liverpool.”
How like “a finished gentleman 1"
Sir Astley shows himself to have been a very unsophisticated man.
Mark the ingenuousness of the following. The King was to have a tumour
cut from his head :—
“I called upon Lord Liverpool, and requested him to persuade the King
to let HoME do the operation, as that was the usual etiquette, he being
Sergeant-Surgeon. Lord Liverpool said that it was very difficult to inter-
fere respecting the choice of a medical man. I was very averse from doing
it : I had always been successful, and I saw that the operation, if it were
followed by erysipelas, would destroy all my happiness, and blast my reptº-
tation.’
rat Mit two:
Alê '
| t
DISPENSING with ceremoNY.
And, therefore, Sir Astley's charity began “at Home tº
Sir Astley says of the King's abilities:—
“They were of the first order. He would have made the first physician, or surgeon, of
his time, the first lawyer—the first speaker in the House of Commons or Lords, though,
perhaps not the best divine!”
Why not? For our part (as we think we shall show), George the
Fourth would have been quite as much of the Archbishop as of the
“gentleman.” . Take the subjoined example:—
“When ill, the King would never allow that it was caused by his own
imprudence. One morning his tongue was white, and he was much heated.
* By G—,” said he, “it is very extraordinary that I should be thus heated,
for I lived very abstemiously, and went to bed in good time. I must have
some beaume de vie, sir.’ When we went out of the room, W–– said,
‘You must not professionally act upon what his Majesty said: he was
drinking Maraschino at two o'clock this morning.”
That is, the “most finished gentleman” was in the habit of saying
the thing that was not, vulgo—a lie.
Take another evidence to character:—
“ Lord said that George the Fourth and the Duke of York,
although generally lavish, were fond of having money in their bureau,
which they did not like to expend, and related the following anecdote in
illustration. Mrs. Fitzherbert told the King, that one of his horses was
likely to win at Newmarket, but the stakes were not paid. George Lee
came and told him the same thing. “Yes,’ said the King, “I told Lake
to pay them.” “But,' replied Lee, “he has no money.” “Do you pay
them, then, my dear fellow. Oh! yes, you pay them.' He could not pay
them either, and half an hour only remained; when he was told that his
horse could not run, as the stakes were not paid. “Yes ; but I have told
Lake to pay them, and I told Lee to pay them.” “But they have no
money, your Majesty.’ And then, very unwillingly, he went to his
drawer to take out the sum. The Duke of York was just the same : they
would, either of them, draw a cheque upon their bankers, but would not
part with their money.”
What perfect “gentlemen l’”
King George was, however, as Sir Astley Cooper triumphantly proves,
a brilliant wit. He could dazzle even under the surgeon's knife. For
instance —
“The King bore the operation well, requested that there might be no
hurry, and when it was finished, said, “What do you call the tumour !'
I said, “A steatome Sire.’ ‘Then,” said he, “I hope it will stay at home,
and not annoy me any more.’”
Is not the reader convulsed ?
Now as we know Punch circulates in the Elysian Fields, “should
this meet the eye of George the Fourth, he is requested to send, say five
hundred jokes, not worse than the above, to our Office, for first-rate pay-
ment.” The money shall either be put to his Majesty's own account, or
shall be more beneficently applied in buying up the “I.O.U.’s” of his
lamented brother, York

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE “MILK!” OF POOR-LAW “KINDNESS.”
At a late meeting of the rate-payers of Bethnal-erreen, one of the
body made the following statement, adding that he had been a wit-
ness of the fact :—“An infant, only fire weeks old, was separated from
the mother, being occasionally brought to her for the breast.”
What a beneficent presence is this same Poor-Law, that it takes to
its bosom babes and sucklings—that it lavishes upon callow infancy
the tenderness, the love, the gushing kindness of maternal instincts :
Doth it not realise the parable of NATHAN Doth not the wailing,
helpless piece of humanity become the Poor-Law’s “ewe-lamb,” eating
of its own meat, drinking of its cup, lying in its bosom, and being
unto it as a daughter Can we sufficiently venerate the wisdom, the
benevolence of a statute that supplies to pauper infancy the substitute
for a mother—that dandles it, kisses it, prattles to it from the eloquent
fulness of the heart, surrounding, strengthening, and comforting its
feeble nature with the thousand nameless acts of mother's love—with
all the holiness of mother's best emotions !
What was the celebrated wooden eagle and iron fly of Regioston-
TANUs—the eagle that hovered over the head of MAx1MILIAN with
a crown in its beak—the mechanic fly that flew about the royal ban-
quet—(for the account of which things see the old chroniclers,)—to
the automaton Poor-Law mother at work in the Union, dandling,
kissing, fondling its pauper multitudes : To construct a wooden eagle
—to fashion an iron fly—both of which should have motion and appa-
rent intelligence, was certainly a high mechanic achievement: but
what is it to the greater triumph of our day, that, by a le Roi le reut,
makes on the instant a Union Mother, as the old painters limned a
Mother Nature, with a hundred breasts; with this difference, indeed,
in the statute parent, that they are cold and milkless
Let us watch the outward development of the inward love beating
in the heart of the Somerset-house automaton, the mother-in-law (for
he was officially born of the statute) of Mr. Edwin CHADwick. Her
adopted babe of five weeks old screams for its natural parent; and
the old hag—the childless Sycon Ax, unblest even by a CALIBAN of
her own—hobbles with the squalling nuisance, the pauper-brat, the
law-made offal of the land, to its natural parent, who has offended
the decencies of the earth by adding to the list of GoD's helpless
creatures, and who is therefore doomed to the hospitality of the Union.
The Poor-Law witch sits her down whilst the baby feeds at the
mother's breast,-waiting, grudgingly waiting, until baby-pauper has
made its natural meal,—and then, with most relentless haste, snatch-
ing it from its mother's arms, in punishment of the said mother's
iniquity of want. The foolish woman would sit and watch, and solace
her mother's heart with looking on her baby's face, there is, at least,
a legend that mothers out of a Union are wont to do so; but step-dame
Poor-Law forbids the luxury, and snatching the baby to its parchment
breast, carries it off, until it squall and squall again for the maternal
bosom, and is at length triumphant in its roaring.
Mother Poor-Law has now the baby to herself. Let us watch her
games with it. How she dandles it ! How she throws it up and
down, and kisses, and prattles to it; and with softly-beaming eyes
and honied words, becomes communicant with the dawning intelli-
gence, that her love still more awakens ! What a Mother of Mo-
thers Yea, what a Mother Cole is she Tories, Whigs, and Radi-
cals—for ye all, more or less, assisted at the work—gather round,
and marvel at the automaton parent ye have fashioned Would
ye not swear she lived and breathed, so lively are her antics with
the pauper babe? Never think it : for a moment, pass no such
slander on your handiwork—there is no more life in the creature
than in a shadow thrown by a corpse—no more throb of heart than
in a mummy of old Egypt.
And herein, O legislators is your excelling triumph ; herein do
ye show yourselves more than equal to the magicians of the olden
day, who would conjure up menials to do their bidding from the
barren sand—from the surrounding air; who would have servitors,
to all external appearance, of bone and muscle, and quick red
blood—but who were mere phantasmata, looking human, but indeed
heartless, brainless, pulseless. Of these is too often the Poor-Law
ruling the Union. Of these is the seeming humanity that, preaching
the ultimate dignity of men's nature—of the nature to be developed,
it may be, in the year 3000—would strip the present man of all that
elevates him above the ox that breaks the clod. Of these is the
shadowy harridan, that snatches the puling five weeks' babe from its
mother's breast, and counts out to it drops of mother's milk, as misers
count ingots.
Nor is the terror of the Poor-Law confined to the walls of the
Union. No ; it waylays the poor in their mid-day walks—a shadow
falls from it that darkens the noon-day earth! Men become mad with
their very fears of the horror that then “lays knives under their
pillows;” and, to the disordered wits of the failing, struggling hus-
band and father, preaches homicide as the best duty.
What screams pierce through yonder dwelling ! People run in
and out with speechless horror in their stone-like faces ! Some
crime has been accomplished—some deed that sinks the doer to the
demons. What can it be
A man—heretofore believed a mild, kind, gentle creature; one
noted for his homely affections, for his love and tenderness to his
children, has even now become their murderer. A fear of want
brought madness upon him—madness, made by the Poor-Law ; the
fiend that has haunted his solitary hours—that, in the very inten
sity of his affections, has curdled his heart's blood, destroyed his
brain, and to his bewildered thoughts made him the kindest, the
most provident father, a thrice-dyed murderer. He has saved his
children from the Union, by blessing them with coffins.
Is this a picture of the imagination—a ghastly fiction of blood
vending novelists
And yet, we think, we see Lord Howick, in his easy library chail
with the last Poor-Law Report in his hand,-we see him throw him
self back, and hear him crow like chanticleer at the marvellous story
we have forged as the effect of Poor-Law benevolence His Lord-
ship is, doubtless, a good Christian : a truth which, we question not,
he illustrates in the family pew every Sabbath day. His Lordship—
the very champion of the Poor-Law—is, we are sure of it, touched
with the very thanksgiving of humility when he reflects upon Christ-
mas-day ; when he remembers the Nativity of that benevolence for
the first time preached to suffering man of man's eternal equality;
of the necessity of an interchange of love and help—of the cultiva-
tion of the affections—of the sacred duty (propounded from the very
throne of Heaven) of charity, in its largest and most comprehensive
meaning.
Imagine Lord Howick—his ears it may be ringing with the rude
Christmas carol sung beneath his window (if, indeed, the police, town
or rural, have not scared the minstrels hence), imagine his Lordship,
in the depths of his Christianity, and in the comprehensiveness of his
statesmanship, plunging his goose-quill into his standish, for the
magnanimous purpose of writing down small ale and pauper plum
pudding ! There had been a talk—a foolish rumour of a foolish
intention, to regale certain workhouse people with a gill or so of
ale, and a slice of pudding, that Christmas might be to their senses
something more than a name—that they might feel that a recollec.
tion of the Advent of CHR1st yet throbbed in the hearts of their
richer fellow-Christians. But no the Poor-Law—at least in the
opinion of Lord Howick—was expressly passed to repeal the New
Testament, and there should be no chance of the paupers running
riotous upon the strength of illegally applied Christianity. Lord
| Howick held up his Christian hand against ale and pudding to the
workhouse; and having fulfilled his duty as a born senator and a
citizen, dined that day off—shall we say ten courses
And with all this, strange it is that the poor look with sullen eyes
at the men with pockets . With this daily preaching, and practical
illustration of the created inferiority of men who have nothing, to
those who have “land and beeves,” or some tangible property, the
poor are obstinate, and vain enough to imagine that they have a
common nature with those who, on the strength of their enjoyed
comforts, call themselves their betters It is a remarkable and
humiliating evidence of popular ignorance—of the hebete condition
of the masses, that, with the beautiful machinery of the Poor-Laws,
with the thousand social modes, both obvious and subtle, of showing
to the poor man his utter uselessness—of proving to him that he has
committed a great wrong upon his betters by coming into this world
at all,—that he will still not consider himself as being allowed to
belong to this earth as a matter of sufferance, but purely as a matter
of right. He moreover talks some gibberish, called “sympathy 1”
“Sympathy | " Oh ye makers of the Poor Laws, what does the varlet
mean : Q.
GLAZED PEWS
MR. PALMER, sheriff of Bucks, and especial patron of the church at
Dorney, has been terribly mauled for having had, among other luxuries,
his pew “glazed at the top ſ”. Why not Some people's Christianity,
like cucumbers, may flourish all the better under glass.

AN INTERESTING CORRESPONDENT.
PUNCH, -No offence to you, but I am in such a humour, I cannot call
any one “Dear.”—What do you think? I sent a tragedy, in which the
following ode was introduced, and in which all the sentiment was of the
same character, to the Theatre Royal * * * *. It was actually rejected.
-I say no more. What is to become of the drama now !

TITAN, that sitt'st upon a shapeless throne,
And broodest forth thy fantasies sublime
Alone—alone !

Tinges the antithetic cheek;
Awake, arise, boldly to thee I cry—
For thou art I
II.
Oh, I am very fresh and beautiful,
The sweetest flowers I cull
From where young Poesy, with eye unseeing,
Revels in the jocundity of being.
I know the land where young ideas sprout
Soft things, that round about the column twine,
Where space unmeasured and divine
Laughs at the earth and at the ocean waves,
Till Echo from black Demogorgon's caves
Repeats the shout.

It will not hear my honied melodies.

And fashion mighty verses to the skies.
The clouds shall weep when they shall hear me sing,
And through the planets all my notes shall ring.
The moon's soft ray, the sun's bright beams,
Shall bask in Transcendental dreams.
The portals that the hours confine,
Shall burst in two at every song of mine,
The stars shall all be linked to me—
For I am young Eternity.
SEASONABLE FESTIVITIES.
The housewarming of the New Model Prison took place about a fort-
night ago. The guests, sixteen in number, were received by the governor,
and regaled with the good old prison fare of potatoes and gruel. Beds
were provided for all the company on the premises.
THE APPROACHING SESSION.
(from the onserven’s “own.”)
The country is on tiptoe, and expectation has leaped pick-a-pack on
to the shoulders of surmise for the purpose of catching a glimpse of things
which are as yet impalpable. Curiosity has rubbed her eye-glass; and
while the spectacles of inquiry hang over the nose of doubt, anticipation
lifts the opera-glass of observation to the eye; while Time, with a
tantalizing aspect, points to a damaged telescope.
If we were called upon at this moment to say what the Ministers will
do, we should not only pause before we made a reply, but we should make
no reply at all, in the first instance, and should pause for a long time after-
wards. We are not among the intimates of Sir Robert Peel, nor do we
stoop, like some of our contemporaries, to visit the servants'-hall for the
sake of learning the Premier's measures from the lips of his menials. It
is true that we i. sources of information known only to ourselves; but
these at present tell us nothing. It will be seen, then, that these sources
are uot likely to mislead us, and that all we have hitherto learned from
them may be firmly relied upon.
Whatever may be the means of the Minister, our own determination is
pretty generally known. If Sir R. Peel goes to the right, we shall not
feel ourselves bound to turn to the left ; nor will his going forward be a
signal for us to turn backward. The Speech from the Throne will, we
have reason to know, consist of more paragraphs than one ; but it is not
for us to say what the one most important paragraph will be, nor what
will be the nature of the others. We care not for the voice of faction ;
nor do we fear the tide of popular clamour. “Cash and commerce 1” has
always been our cry; and while the banners of Britannia float over the
dark blue waters of the boundless sea, we may well defy the calumny of
an opposition contemporary, who takes advertisements at a penny a line
less than ourselves, with the dastardly intention of undermining us and
the British constitution together.
OUR LIBRARY TABLE.
I.—THE BOOKS OF THE SEASON.
OUR Library Table is strewed with books of the season, the principal of
which is our Grocer's Book, and we find we have let these matters get
into such arrears, that the authors or compilers of these books must be
naturally impatient for us to take some notice of them. Our Grocer's
Book is an instructive little Manual, from which we find that coffee is two
shillings a pound, and that moist sugar is sold at the rate of sevenpence
the pound; presenting a curious analogy to the Income Tax. We may,
however, draw a distinction; for while the one is sweet, the other is bitter.
Our Butcher's Book is a very curious production, and is written partly in
hieroglyphics; particularly that part of it which relates to Items; though
the sum total is set out with laudable distinctness. We have not been
very well pleased with the annotations, and there is a note at the end of the
last page which we thought extremely irrelevant. It speaks of the neces-
sity the author is under of meeting a heavy payment on a certain day,
and craves the assistance of the individual to whom the book is dedicated.
It will be seen that the author is of a sanguine temperament, which is
liable to lead him to the commission of some absurdities.
THE POLITICIAN TO HIS MISTRESS.
When at night in the house Peter Borthwick is prosing,
And members on both sides are chatting aloud,
When snug in his chair Mister Speaker is dozing,
Oh then I'll steal softly away from the crowd 1
When the Tories bring forward an excellent budget,
When the tax upon incomes is pleasing to all,
When the duty on corn is what landowners pledge it,
When Ministers cheerfully meet with a fall;
When Sibthorpe talks sense or creates an impression,
When Goulburn has settled the national debt,
When a great deal of good is achieved in a session,
Oh then, dearest maiden I'll learn to forget.
This passionate letter with favour then heeding,
Of my constancy quickly relinquish each doubt;
Oh I give it a second, and e'en a third reading,
Before from your heart 'tis completely thrown out.
Then treat not the matter with scornful derision,
Nor let the cold world interpose its harsh law.
Between us no others should make a division :
No 1 rather for ever let strangers withdraw.

THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
chapter lºw.—which TREAT'S MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE Young
LAD1Es, AND MR. LACQUER'S BENEVOLENCE.
E have spoken,
en passant, of the
Misses Spangle
Lacquer—we will
now endeavour to
make the reader
better acquainted
with them.

ladies, then, feel

stating “that they

Those narrow-minded
minded and well-educated young women. - -
people who affect to sneer at Mrs. Lacquer for that display which
they can never hope to compass, affirm that there were other reasons
for domestic tuition. In fact, that, since at the time when her
daughters were growing up there were several more in family, it was
deemed cheaper to work to death a talented and heart-broken girl,
as governess, in instructing the whole party at once, than to place
them separately at some school.
So have we seen, at taverns, five people club together their shillings
for the luxury of a bowl of punch, and be looked upon for a while as
the heads of the room, where otherwise they would have been com-
pelled to be content with distinct goes of plebeian spirits. So do
passengers in the street throw forth their halfpence, and laugh at the
exertions of the famishing mountebank, whose performance they
could not have commanded for themselves alone. And the Lacquer
young ladies learnt another useful lesson from the governess, besides
their ordinary routine of accomplishments, inculcating a proper pride
of station, and the importance of money. The governess was far
superior to them both in family and acquirements—her father's crest
had never needed to be “found” by ingenious seal-engravers of
inventive minds, and she knew that her ancestors had borne it on
their shields at Agincourt. But the Lacquers were enabled, through
their excellent bringing up, to look upon her merely as a superior
domestic—the entresol in their architectural scale of society; and they
regarded her with a perfect absence of that awkward feeling which
would certainly have affected low people. And of course the mere
act of their so constantly and studiously endeavouring to make the
governess perfectly aware of what she was, proved that they thought
nothing of her.
The Misses Lacquer are now perfectly accomplished, masters having
serfected what the governess left undone. Common French, of
×ourse, they look upon as their own tongue; but it is wonderful to
hear them talk German—even the very natives of that country have
been amazed at it. And their knowledge of Italian is so perfect that
they would not be seen with a book at the Opera for the world—
they would as soon think of sitting in the vulgar public boxes of one
of the common English theatres, or singing an English ballad in
society, unless they smothered up the words, and overlaid the air with
roulades, so that by thus stifling the original song altogether, nobody
could exactly tell what it was.
But their knowledge is not merely superficial, for they have learnt
a quantity of botany and chemistry from a valuable series of works,
which being bound in green silk, with gilt edges, must, of course,
comprise the best treatises on those subjects.
If young men, whom they wish to dazzle and overcome, tell them
that their eyes are diamonds and their teeth pearls, they will reply
that it is no compliment to say so, for the first substance is only
crystallized charcoal, and the last diseased oyster-shells, as they have
frequently heard explained at the Royal Institution—the only public
scientific establishment they deign to visit.
They have a great idea of the Horticultural Fête at Chiswick, and
are usually to be met with at all three ; although they give it out
generally that they only go to the middle one. They feel great grati-
fication when their carriage draws up at the gate, before the people
who are waiting for their own equipages. They could get in much
more comfortably and far sooner by walking down to where it was
waiting at the side of Turnham Green; but then nobody would see
its gaudy liveries and conspicuous heraldic bearings. They are par-
ticular on this point; and indeed once found it necessary to cut a
friend of their brother's because he had the temerity—in the open
face of a beautiful July day, calmly and deliberately to go from Hyde
Park Corner to Chiswick, on the roof of an omnibus. Young Lacquer
proves his superior breeding by hiring a private cab for the day, when
he cannot borrow one from any of the high-born young men who
borrow his money in return ; and gets into no end of rows on his
journey down, from not being a very experienced whip.
Of course, the Misses Lacquer will make very eligible matches.
They have been “out” four or five seasons—for as the high-born
daughters of England keep up that ceremony of inauguration into
the mysteries of the Hymeneal Stock Exchange, the Lacquers must
do the same—and have not yet gone off, it is true, but, of course, they
will do so. Envious report, however, says that there is very little
money attached to them; that, whilst old Lacquer is very rich, still
other expenses are proportionately great, and that all they will have
will be what he leaves—not what he gives them. And yet this is
scarcely just, for Mr. Lacquer's liberality and benevolence are
attested every printed subscription—the true charity that relieves
those proper objects whose distress is publicly heralded forth by a
phalanx of important names, in preference to the swindling whispers
of pitiful unknown hearts that burst in seclusion. Does an hospital
require to be built, or an infirmary or asylum to be established, Mr.
Lacquer’s open hand comes down immediately with fifty or a hun-
dred pounds. Is there an eleemosynary sermon at a fashionable
church—the gold glitters in the sunlight as Mr. Lacquer drops it
into the plate, so accommodatingly presented to him; but he never
encourages illness or want by covertly aiding the same individuals
for whom the charity is founded that he has assisted to endow.
| ! |
|
||||| -
Mrs. Lacquer has precisely the same right-minded feeling; and
with it she combines true hospitality, and the desire to honour her
guests. For when she holds a grand réunion she does not care how
many wax candles blaze in the branches and chandeliers of the
apartments for the gratification of her company. We say the grati-
fication of her company, because it is evident that this single-hearted
woman dislikes such show. We know this from having one even-
ing dropped in by chance, when nobody was there, or indeed ex-
pected, and found her with a solitary metallic wick, reading as she
best might. And we have heard from discarded servants that the
menu of the dinner was sometimes rather shy when it was a mere
family meal—that they did not then even use the covers, “with
handies to take off and form dishes,” which they appeared, at their
dinner parties, to consider as belonging to a service of the most
every-day kind;—but these reports we really blush to-chronicle,
when we reflect upon the quarter from whence they were derived.

st-
Maus revenons d-pshaw that hacknied sentence is quite worn out
in the service of a species of literary police-officers, in bringing back
runaway subjects to their proper place, so we will not use it, but discard
it henceforth. We meant it to imply that we were about to return
to the Misses Lacquer. Next to the horticultural féte and perhaps
Ascot course, the great effects in dress and appearance are econo-
mised for the autumnal visit to the sea-side, where they always
migrate and remain, while there, in a fashionable expensive board-
ing-house. Their chief amusement here is carrying on a matrimonial
game of chess, as soon as they become assured of the actual great
expectations of any bachelor therein abiding. They have several
times met with such a one, and endeavoured, by driving him about
the squares and giving him check, to compel him to take them. Up
to the present time, they have not succeeded, from want of proper
finesse ; but they will doubtless improve, since they leave London
every year with the rest of their world. Indeed, of such vital im-
portance is this migration, that one season, when they were compelled
to stay in town, Mrs. Lacquer and her daughters never left the
house, but papered up their blinds and shut the shutters of the front
drawing-room and parlour; and lived for six weeks in the back
rooms that overlooked the dead wall of the mews.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER IV.-OF JUPITER, HIS WIFE, AND FAMILY.
Jupit ER, with his crown and sceptre, was sitting, one fine day,
in a contemplative mood, amusing himself by watching affairs in
general, of which his throne commanded a fine view. But presently
his attention was diverted from mundane things to an object more
particularly under his nose—namely, to Master Cupid, who was
running about before the hall window, playing with a little bow and
arrows.
“Hallo, you young sir,” cried Jupiter, “what are you about
the e l’”
“ Nothing, sir,” answered Cupid.
“Nothing, you rogue; do you call that nothing You'll put some
god's eye out presently. Come here.”
Cupid obeyed.
“Don’t you know,” said Jupiter, “that bows and arrows are very
dangerous things !”
“Mine are not sir,” replied Cupid. “See.” And with this he
suddenly twanged his string and sent a shaft through the heart of
Jupiter and out at his back, before the monarch could say Jack
Robinson.
His Majesty instinctively seized a thunderbolt, but feeling that
e was not hurt, he stayed his uplifted arm ; while a smile which
stole over his features, and a slight cachinnation, evinced a con-
sciousness agreeable rather than otherwise. Cupid ran away laugh-
ing. “A little monkey !” exclaimed Jupiter. “Confound his im-
I udence But what new sensation is this?” And he placed his
hand upon his heart and turned up his eyes.
It were needless to pursue his soliloquy further. Suffice it to say,
that not an hour had elapsed after his having been shot at, when
Jºno, coming in unexpectedly, caught him on his knees to his sister
Latona. The row that ensued transcends a single man's imagination.
After this Jupiter went on very ill. He turned Turk and married
four or five more wives, and took to lurking and wandering up and
down, philandering at masquerades in all sorts of disguises, and
behaving altogether like a gay Lothario. He went courting to
Europa in the form of a bull, paid his addresses to Leda as a swan,
and made strong love to Antiope in the shape of a satyr. It will
readily be conceived that Juno was highly displeased with this
unsteadiness. In her paroxysms of jealousy she would box his ears
and scratch his face, and he in return would beat and kick her ; so
that they lived a very cat-and-dog sort of life together, just like
Punch and Judy.
The family of his Majesty Jupiter soon became very extensive;
and to give the devil, or rather the divinity, his due, he provided
handsomely for them all. Of the most noted of these and the other
subordinate deities it is now time to give an account, which will
most conveniently be done in alphabetical order, beginning with
%l pollo.
Apollo was the son of Jupiter and Latona. According to Cicero
there were four of that name, to whom, if we add Apollo Belvy,
who was personated by Mr. Liston, we shall have five. Apollo
used to preside over the fine arts, music, poetry, medicine, elo-
quence, and humbug. He presides at present over terraces and
crescents; as Apollo Terrace, Apollo Crescent. He is the patron of
National Galleries and Art Unions; but whether as the god of the
fine arts or the god of humbug (though some say, that the latter is
one of the fine arts), mythologists are not agreed upon. Under his
patronage also, were the concerts of the ancients, and so the Ancient
Concerts are still ; as likewise are the Philharmonic and the Pro-
menade Concerts, which last he conducts in the shape of a funny
little Frenchman in a spangled waistcoat and white kid gloves. The
praises of Apollo have been set forth in divers odes in former times,
and more recently in a celebrated glee—“Glorious Apollo, from on
high behold us,” which is sung at harmonic meetings with great
applause.
Apollo, according to Lempriere and Lord Byron, was born at
Delos— “Where Delos rose and Phoebus sprung.”
For Apollo was also called Phoebus. This, however, was not an alias,
but rather a sort of praenomen, as he was often termed Phoebus-Apollo.
Phoebus, therefore, would have been his Christian name, if he had
been a Christian ; but as he was one of the heathen deities, of course
it could not be that. The word Phoebus corresponds to our verna-
cular, “bright one;” or more vernacularly still “bright 'un;” and
there is some reason to suppose that, as the last-mentioned epithet
would be now-a-days, it was a sort of nick-name; for it was con-
ferred upon him in his capacity of coachman, or, as the vulgar say,
jarvey; as he drove the Sun fast coach, which started every morning
from the public-house of that name over against the palace of Neptune.
Apollo was the best hand at an oracle of all the gods in Olympus :
the reader will recollect that he has already been described as the
god of humbug. His oracles had the repute of being infallible,
which they owed to being invariably capable of being understood
two ways. Nevertheless he was a great shot with the long-bow, for
he killed the serpent Python (the skeleton of which creature is now
in the British Museum), a few minutes after he was born—an age
when ordinary children lie in bed. Python was a great snake of the
boa-constrictor species, which had been raised (there is reason to
suppose) in Kentucky by the jealous Juno, and sent to eat Latona
up. As president of poetry, Apollo was of course the god of fiction;
and, consequently, of lying—though whether he invented the lyre or
not has been disputed; everybody, however, admits that he played it.
In external form, Apollo resembled a nice young man ; such, at
least, he would have seemed if he had sported whiskers; but he was
beardless. He wore his locks a la jeune France, and his head was sur-
rounded with beams of light; it is therefore probable that he had
recourse to Macassar oil, which communicates that glossy appearance
to the hair which is so great an addition to personal beauty.
Lambs were sacrificed to Apollo ; but whether with or without
mint sauce, the learned cannot tell. He had a grand temple at
Delphi, and a Colossus at Ithodes, which places must not be con-
founded with the Adelphi, where Cupid was once to be seen every
night; nor with the Coal Hole kept by Mr. Rhodes.
Apollo had the credit of occasioning epidemics and contagions,
which he naturally would do, not only as the God of medicine, but as
having a son, AEsculapius, formerly physician to the Argonauts, in
extensive practice. We read that this AEsculapius was killed by
Jupiter, with a thunderbolt, for raising the dead to life; but his
crime more probably was another sort of resurrectionism ; the Ana-
tomy Bill not then having become law. However he was slain, as
aforesaid; and Apollo, exasperated at the fate of his son, shot the

Uyclops, (the one-eyed blacksmith who had forged the thunderbolt,)
through the head. Jupiter, therefore, kicked him out of heaven ;
and Apollo was forced to rusticate for nine years in Thessaly—or in
other words, was transported for that period for manslaughter.
Apollo had a very
pleasant residence on the
summit of Mount Par-
nassus; a situation less
eligible, but perhaps more
picturesque, than Clapham
Rise. His establishment
at this place consisted of
nine maids, called Muses,
who were a sort of gover-
nesses in his family. Of
these larger mention will
be made hereafter ; it is
enough at present to say
that they were very clever,
and rejoiced in blue stock-
ings, all except Terpsi-
chore, the Muse of the
Ballet, who wore some-
times flesh-coloured tights,
at others white silk.
Apollo had a Phaëton,
not a vehicle, however,
but a son. The name of
this young gentleman has
been corrupted, in these
latter times, into Pheaton.
He was capsized in the
attempt to drive his
father's coach, which “la-
mentable accident,” as it
was termed in the papers
of the day, is commemo-
rated in Ovid's Metamor-
phoses. -
Apollo had also other
children, who were all
bright, like his own par-
ticular sun. Among them
all poets and poetesses are
included. Most of these
members of his family
have departed this life;
but Mr. Thomas Moore,
Mr. Samuel Rogers, and
Mr. Campbell, are still
living.
3Bumth's “Court Circular.”
On Wednesday last, Her Majesty (to the great delight of the actors and
the public generally) again “commanded” the performances at Covent-
Garden Theatre. This, it will be remembered, is the fourth time within
a month that our Gracious Queen has shown the strongest evidence in her
power of the wise interest (for we call it wisdom) she takes in the English
1)rama—of her sense of its surpassing glories—and of the beneficial effect
of her patronage upon the higher and middling classes.
Her Majesty (with her characteristic punctuality) arrived at the theatre,
accompanied by Prince Albert, at exactly two minutes to seven. She was
escorted by a detachment of the Life Guards, and was loudly cheered by
the people all the way from Buckingham Palace to Hart-street. Indeed,
the visits of Her Majesty to the theatre have of late been so regularly
paid, that people begin now to look forward to Wednesday, evening as a
sort of holiday, that they may at least catch a glance of their beloved and
enlightened Queen as she rapidly passes from her palace to the playhouse.
On their arrival at the theatre, Her Majesty and the Prince were re-
ceived by Mr. BARTLEY and (Mr BuNN being absent in Berlin) by Mr.
John Cooper, both in very splendid court-dresses, and carrying very large
wax candles. Her Majesty was graciously pleased to express her satis-
faction at the costly and tasteful preparations made for her visit, her box
being most magnificently decorated, and the ante-room filled with the
choicest exotic and aromatic flowers.
When the Rºyal couple appeared in the box, the audience rose and
cheered as one man : the curtain drew up, and the national anthem was
sung, a tremendous burst of applause drowning the voice of the singer
(Miss RAINForth) at the line, “Long to reign over us!”, Her Majesty
was evidently affected by the enthusiastic loyalty of her subjects.
The performances commenced with another new comedy, called Are
you sure 'tis She 3 (it was perfectly successful), followed by the old farce of
My Spouse and I, concluding with the pantomime. God save the Queen 1
was then again demanded; and Her Majesty and the Prince retired
amidst the cheering of the multitudinous audience.
The Queen was simply dressed in white satin, trimmed with lace (all of
English manufacture), and wore a bandlet of most exquisite brilliants.
The Prince, as usual, wore a Field-Marshal's uniform. The Royal pair,
it gladdens us to say, appeared in excellent health, and relished the per-
formances exceedingly. Between the play and farce, tea was prepared in
the box ; and on one occasion, a hearty burst of John-Bull applause
escaped the audience, when the Queen handed a cup to Prince Albert
(the curious play-goer may remember that the like domestic incident once
occurred on a state visit of the late William the Fourth with Queen
Adelaide to Drury-Lane.)
We cannot dismiss this brief and bare account of a most interesting
event without for a moment expressing our gratitude to Her Majesty for
her theatrical patronage. Its influence must be obvious upon all ; but
especially upon the higher classes, who have so long deserted our national
temples of the Drama. With the impulse, however, given by Her
Majesty, we have yet hopes that FARquhar and SHERIDAN may again be
introduced to good society, and Shakspearianity be generally diffused
among the benighted peerage.
THE MEND ICITY MARKET.
(FRom our RFD-Lion-square coakespondent.)
Twins are looking up, but orphans are still below par. Blind men
make but little progress—but their dogs, when properly trained, fetch a
great deal, and that, too, at a single bidding. Crossing-sweepers are firm,
and still stick to their posts, though the Lascars have i. swept every-
thing before them. The frozen-out gardeners are complaining bitterly of
the mildness of the weather. Congreve matches, since the rain, will not
go off at all. Ballads are largely quoted—but somehow do not sell for
more than a mere song. Begging-letters do not answer, though the chalk-
writing on the pavement, especially the running hand, goes off as rapidiy
as ever. Wooden legs are sent away begging; whilst sailors, who have
lost their arms, go crying about the streets, but find that London is net
exactly the place for alms-giving. Fiddlers continue to scrape as much
as formerly; but . are turned to no profit, and the Scotch band, we
are sorry to say, no longer pipes to the same tune that it used to do.

PHILANTHROPY AND FIDDLING.
WE are a charitable people, but when we give a shilling to a
charitable purpose, we like to have our shilling's-worth in return.
We call ourselves sympathising Christians, but our Christianity
cannot be dispensed gratis. This small social infirmity was, a few
days since, strikingly illustrated at the Hall of Commerce in Thread-
needle-street.
A thrill of horror—a sense of grief—has struck and weighed upon
the whole nation by the late frightful disasters at sea. Five hundred
souls, it is said, have perished in the ocean; leaving breaking hearts
to bewail them ; leaving the widowed and the fatherless to agony and
hopeless want. The misery of poverty may, however, be somewhat
alleviated. For this purpose Sin John PIRIE took the chair at a
meeting of merchants held at the Hall of Commerce ; and then
pertinently said, to “cheering" voices:—
“Those who were safe on land were anxious to testify their sympathy, in the only way
in which sympatly was of any avail, by putting their hands in their pockets.”
They were, however, to have something in return for what they
took out of their pockets. This, Si R John had duly understood
from the good Samaritans of the city; for he said (and again the
merchants “cheered”)—
“By several philanthropic persons in the city of London, who were in the habit of
superintending meetings suddenly got up with the view of serving the unfortunate, it had
been stated that a concert in the splendid room in which the meeting was now assembled,
would be the most agreeable means of gathering together the charitable of both sexes,
and receiving their contributions in the price of tickets of admission.”
And so Charity, “heaven-descended maid,” is only to be charmed
into the light of day, as the snake-charmers of the East draw serpents
from their holes, by piping and drumming ! The sympathetic strings
of the human heart are to vibrate to cat-gut ! The “melodious
tear” of benevolence is to be accompanied by Mr. BLAG Rove on
the cornet-à-piston /
Yes; we will imagine “the splendid room” of the Hall of Com-
merce crowded by “the charitable of both sexes,” thus “agreeably
gathered together” by hopes of music vocal and instrumental. We
will imagine that Lord DUDLEY STUART-
(“Praise be to him, and to his slumbers peace,”–)
has succeeded, as he assuredly will succeed, in obtaining gratuitously
the very highest professional assistance. Every artist of any emi-
mence clamours to aid the almost sacred purpose, and (what charity
can stay at home, reading such a concert bill 1) the “splendid room"
is crowded ! Sympathy, in full dress, elbows it in a throng ' What
a delightful spectacle ! How cheering to the philanthropist
How ennobling to the best feelings of our nature to behold such
a multitude gathered together to aid the wretched widow and
the orphan, upon this slight consideration,-that they shall have the
very best music for their money. How the deep sense of the cala-
mity, and its frightful effects at hundreds of hearths, strikes upon
the hearts of the assembled crowd How serious, how solemn are
their faces ! Not a smile plays upon them : as for the music—
“They hear it, and they heed it not, their ears
Are with their hearts, and they are far away—”
listening to the howling wind on desolate Lornel—hearing the roaring
sea with a grave in every billow !
Our worthy and intelligent contemporary, The Boulogne Gazette,
has given a terrible picture—terrible in its true simplicity—of the
horrors of the wreck :—
“Waves like mountains soon rose above the sides, and poured, in all their vengeance,
tons and tons of water along the deck, streaming down the cuddy stairs and overflowing
the steerage. All rushed on deck in their flannels and nightclothes to seek refuge on the
poop. . There, indeed, was a distressing scene—mothers and children clasping each
other in mute hope, husband encouraging the wife, the captain sustaining all by pro-
mises he felt delusive. Our readers may imagine the scene; but we cannot refrain from
Fº noticing the admirable conduct of Miss Turton, who was 18 on the day of
er death. She had been the life and soul of the voyage, had endeared all to her by her
constant good humour, suavity, and mildness. On that poop she thought not of herself;
there she was going from sad group to sad group, sustaining the courage of all, and
holding out prospects of succour and safety; ministering, like a pure spirit, consolation.
hope, and dependence on that Providence who orders ºft. the best.”
Is this a thing to be “set to music " Can its desolating effects
harmonize with a cavatina by Mrs. Shaw—with Willie brewed a peck
o' naut, by Mr. Wilson—or with even The Sea, by Mr. H. Phillips.
With an inexpressible loathing, we ask again, is this a horror to be
piped and fiddled to ?
And now—we see astonishment in the face of the excellent and
well-meaning Lord DUDLEY STUART, who at length finding words,
asks, “What I would you afford no relief to the wretched creatures,
deprived at one blow of their earthly protectors: Is there nothing
sacred in such sorrow !” And we answer—Yes, so sacred that we
would not have it associated with the trills and roulades, and dextrous
fin rering of singers and musicians.
We ask of the Samaritans of the City, Hare ye no churches? In such
a cause, is it not better that the voice of sympathy should be heard
from the pulpit than the orchestra º Have ye no priests, that ye
must seek ministers of charity from the opera, the play-house, and the
concert-room If it be so necessary to make benevolence attractive,
are there no bishops to cast a gracious lustre from their cloud of lawn
upon the cause—to lift up their silver voices in aid of the widow and
the fatherless There are many persons, inconstant church-goers,
who nevertheless “lacker their Sunday face” in a pew to hear a
bishop preach ; not, we fear, so much for the matter dropping from
episcopacy, as from mere curiosity; in the like way as the estimable
Mr. SHANDY reproaches himself for his gift of the macaroon to the
ass—not so much for pure charity, as to see how the animal “would
eat a macaroon.” Any way, there would have been no want of
crowded congregations—no lack of gold and silver in the plates of
the churchwardens.
But no, we are to have music for our alms: we are to make holy
offerings at the shrine of charity amidst the smirks and smiles of a
concert-room, to the accompaniment of horns and oboes, tenors and
contraltos Our heart-strings are to be well-rosined, and then—and
only then—our purse-strings will give way ! Q.
THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
Ch.APTER IV.
PATTY BUTLER, "HE FEATHER-DRESSER.—THE GARRETS OF THE
POOR.—PATTY'S MOTHER.—MR. LINTLY, THE APOTHECARY.
THE week that followed the 12th of August, 1762, was a time of
jubilee for rejoicing, thoughtful England. A Prince of Wales was
born ; and as I heard, numberless patriotic sages had, at public
dinners, already prophesied in him another Alfred. In his time all
the virtues would walk the highways, dropping flowers in the every-
day paths of mortals, and rejoicing Plenty unloose her golden
sheaves for the no more repining poor. The sky would wear a purer
azure—the gladdening sun once more beam with the sanctifying
light it cast on Eden—the whole earth lie nearer Paradise, and once
Inore
“—angels talk familiarly with men,”
as men were wont to talk with one another. The Prince—it was
predicted from the tables of a thousand taverns—would be the
paragon of mortals; in his own great acts indicating to the highest
the divine origin and end of man, and showing the folly, the little-
ness, of all human malice, and all human selfishness. George the
Fourth yet slept in his cradle, when the spirit of prophesying thus
walked abroad, and played the sweetest notes upon its silver trumpet;
and tailors and gold-lacemen felt a strange, mysterious gladness—a
lightening of the heart and pleasant spasm of the pocket !
Patty Butler dwelt in a long, dark lane on the north side of the
Strand ; in one of those noisome, pestilent retreats abutting on,
yet hidden by, the wealth and splendour of the metropolis; one
of the thousand social blotches covered by the perfumed, gold-
worked trappings of the harlot London. Even to this place did the
birth of the Prince of Wales bring gladness : for Patty Butler
smiled, as dreaming grief might smile upon an angel, as Luke
Knuckle, Mr. Flamingo's light-porter, somewhat suddenly stood
before her. -
“Hush l’” said Patty, advancing to him, with upraised finger.
“How's mother ?” asked Luke, with a quiet earnestness.
“Better—better, Luke, and asleep. Have you brought work 1"
inquired the girl with trembling voice, and the tears already in her
eyes.
y: Hav'n't you heard the news "asked Flamingo's porter.
“What news should I hear in this place?” said Patty.
“Why, to be sure, you might as well be clean out of the world !
Not to have heard all about it ! Well, I wouldn't ha’ believed it !
Can't you guess " Patty, with a wan smile, shook her head.
“Well, then,” said Luke, “not to teaze you any longer—for God help
you ! poor babe, you’ve enough trouble for any six—what do you
think —there’s a Prince of Wales born 1 *
“Indeed " said Patty, unmoved by the blissful intelligence.
“Why, where could you ha’ been not to have heard the bells ring-
ing, and the guns—to be sure, this isn't much of a place for merry
bells to be heard in at all—but where could you ha’ been i”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Where could I have been—where could I got " said Patty a
little impatiently—and then forcing a smile to her fading lips, she
asked—“and what, Luke, can a Prince matter to folks like us?”
“Well —why you used to be a quick girl—don't you see, the
Prince of Wales as is come will make the fortin of feathers : It's
what they call one of his royal perogatives—though, for myself, I
can't say I know what they quite are. I know this much, though ;
old Flamingo's all upon the wing agin. There's work for three months
certain,” added Luke.
Patty clasped her hands in gratitude, but said nothing.
“Master said you must come to the shop and work, or go without
it ; but I talked to missus—ha! she'd ha’ been a nicer woman after
all, if luck hadn't given her such good board and lodging, I told her
how ill your mother was—how you'd starve beside her, but wouldn't
leave her; so I got her to abuse master into a bit of goodness,
and so that you mayn't leave mother, I’ve brought the work to you.”
Here the honest porter displayed myself and others to Patty Butler.
“You are always so good-natured, Luke,” cried Patty.
“I don't know about that,” said Knuckle, “but after all, it seems
to me so easy to be good-natur'd, I wonder anybody takes the trouble
to be anything else. Good bye, Patty: I say, the work must be done
directly—for master says he don't know when it won't be wanted.”
“I won’t stir, Luke, till I’ve finished it, that you may be sure of,”
said Patty, with new cheerfulness; and wishing her a cordial fare-
well, and speedy health to her mother, Luke Knuckle—the light-
porter to Flamingo, the court feather-merchant—descended the dark
narrow staircase with the feeling of the finest gentleman; for he
trod gently, anxiously, lest he should wake the sleeping sick.
Released from the case, I could now look about me. I am sure I
felt a thrill of pain as the place broke upon me. An August sun
struggled through a narrow lattice, as though stained and tainted by
the gloom it had to pierce ; dimly showing the space of the apart-
ment, a space not encumbered by useless furniture. In a recess,
a nook of the room, was a bed; and I could hear the hard breathing
of a sleeper—but only hear; for a curtain of surprising whiteness
hung between us. Indeed, every object was wonderfully clean, and
displayed itself in contrast to the meanness, the homeliness of the
material. All was penury, but penury in housewife attire.
Patty Butler took me from my other companions, looking earnestly
at me. I have seen eyes exulting under coronets; have felt through-
out my frame the magic breath of beauty, born with all earth's
pleasures for its handmaids; have waved above and touched the
velvet cheek of lady greatness; yet have I never felt such deep
emotion as when gazed upon by the poor feather-dresser—the girl of
fifteen years—the drudge of a garret in a pestilent and fever-
breathing alley.
Patty would never have been beautiful : born in down, and fed
upen the world's honey-dew, she would have passed for nothing
handsome ; but she had in her countenance that kind of plainness, to
my mind, better than any beauty heaven has yet fashioned. Her
sweet, gentle, thin face trembled with sensibility—with sensibility
that sent its riches to her eyes, glittering for a moment there, beyond
all worth of diamonds. I have said, she was really but fifteen ; she
would have passed for twenty. From earliest childhood, she was
made to read the hardest words—“Want,” “Poverty”—in the iron
book of daily life; and the early teaching had given to her face a
look of years beyond her age. With her, daily misery had anti-
cipated time.
And she sits, in that almost empty garret, a lovely sacred thing—a
creature that redeems the evils and the wrongs of earth; and in her
quiet suffering—in her devotion, constant to her heart as her heart's
blood—gives best assurance of a future heaven. She sits, glorified
by patient poverty—by the sustaining meekness of her soul, by the
unconquerable strength of her affections. Beautiful are queens on
thrones—but is there not a beauty (eternal as the beauty of the stars 1)
in placid want, smiling with angel looks, and gathering holiest power,
even from the misery that consumes it?
For two mights, Patty scarcely took one constant hour's repose.
Still she worked ; her labour only intermitted by her frequent visits
to the bed-side where lay her sick mother. I have seen the feet of
the best opera-dancers; heard them praised for their life, ay for
their intelligence—their sentiment. Yet have I seen nothing like
Patty Butler's foot, touching the garret floor from her chair to the
bed-side ; so gentle, so affectionate, so noiseless, yet so trembling at
its motion, lest she should wake her mother
Each day, the doctor—not the parish doctor—came. A neighbour
had told him of the sick woman ; and he had accidentally seen the
gentle Patty. Mr. Lintly was a poor apothecary. It was at times a
hard struggle for him not to tell the man who called for the taxes,
to call again. He had no hope of a shilling from Mrs. Butler, even
could his skill restore her; but more—he knew the seal of death was
on her; consumption—Patty knew it not—withered her.
The third day, I passed in the garret, the doctor paid his morning
visit. Patty had been up all night: that night, she had wept—
bitterly wept—had risen every five minutes to hover above her
mother, who would still assure her she was better—much better.
Mr. Lintly, the apothecary, entered the garret. What chaplets are
woven for men of slaughter | What statues erected to men-slaying
“conquerors What notes of glory sounded—what blaspheming
praises to the genius of blood-shedding ! I have seen much of the
ceremonies dedicated to these things, and contrasting my late feel-
ings with my present, with what new homage do I venerate the race
of Lintleys—the men who, like minor deities, walk the earth—and in
the homes of poverty, where sickness falls with doubly heavy hand,
fight the disease beside the poor man's bed, their only fee the blessing
of the poor 1 Mars may have his planet, but give me what—in
the spirit of the old mythology might be made a star in heaven—the
night-lamp of apothecary Lintly.
“And how—how is your mother?” asked the apothecary, shown
into the room by Patty, who, with me in her hand, had risen to open
the door.
“She is better, sir,” said Patty—“better and asleep.”
The apothecary looked with a mild sadness on the girl, and drew
aside the curtain. Her mother was dead.
In tears and agony and numbness of heart, and death about me, iſ
was prepared—“drest” for—
But of that in another chapter.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CIIARIVARI.
SIR PETER LAURIE ON WOOD.
Sin PETER LAURIE presents his compliments to Punch, and begs
leave to offer the following Treatise on Wood to his consideration :-
ON WOOD,
He would if he could.—Old Proverb.
Wood may be divided into several heads; and my own head has con-
sequently come in for a fair share of it. There is the lignum vitae, or the
log of life, which may be taken to represent a living log, and of these I
have several specimens in my own family. The Woods and Forests are
an interesting branch of this subject. These Woods begin at Waterloo-
F. and end somewhere about Albany-street. Where the forests are,
as not been discovered; but perhaps they extend as far as the Fishmonger
Groves at Charing-cross. These Woods and Forests are capable of
granting leave to persons who wish to build; but they do not seem to
partake in any other manner of the florescent character. Wood pave-
ments are an innovation on all old practices; though it is contended that
they are only an extension of the ancient custom of wearing wooden legs,
which involved the necessity of walking on wood, at least, in some measure.
It is true there is a street called Wood-street, Cheapside; but though I
have inspected the pavement very minutely, and tested the materials
by scratching with my nails, I have not arrived at anything satisfactory.
My objection to paving with wood has been accounted for by saying that I
cannot bring myself to approve of a practice of trampling upon what, in
reference to the heads of the city, may be called our own species. This I
deny It is said in favour of wood, that it enables one to go quietly
on one's way, but I had rather make a noise in the world, and if one
fº. a good price for a carriage, one ought at least to have the luxury of
earing the wheels rattle. It may be said in favour of the antiquity of
wooden pavements, that there is an old expression about “hallooing
before we are out of the wood.” Perhaps there is an Act of Parliament
prohibiting the itinerant vendors of certain commodities to cry their wares
at halloo until they are out of the wood. I say, there is, perhaps, such an
Act of Parliament, but I am bound to admit that perhaps there isn't.
In conclusion, let me say, that I am not a bigoted enemy of wood
paving, and I am still ready to consider the matter, or, in other words, to
give my head to it.
SONGS OF THE SESSIONS.
Tll E SONG OF THE DEPUTY CLERK OF THE PEACE.
They may talk as º will of the warrior's glory,
And boast of their Wellingtons, Bluchers, and Neys,
But the laurel adorning their brows must be gory,
And reeking with blood their victorious bays.
Let others indulging in warlike professions
Engage in hot strife with the Moslem or Turk,
But preserving the peace is the aim of the Sessions,
And I of the Peace am the Deputy Clerk.
I've heard the proud war-horse triumphantly neighing
In the little square boxes in Parliament Street,
I’ve marked when the boys something rude have been saying,
The trooper unmoved has sat stern in his seat.
Yes, war has its glories; then bind up with laurel
The bones of the soldier till battle shall cease;
Let others slash, smash, or dispute, shoot, and quarrel,
But I–am the Deputy Clerk of the Peace.

THE FLOWER-POT, BISHOPSGATE-STREET.
The legend attached to The Flower-Pot, in Bishopsgate Street, is sº,
wild and so romantic, yet, withal, so redolent of “old home voices,” as
Leigh Hunt would call them, that we scarcely know at which end to begin
in relating it. Strutt, in his “Sports and Pastimes,” begins at the middle,
but unfortunately he sticks there. Thomas-a-Kempis leaves the subject
where he found it, or in other words misses it altogether. Camden, in
his quaint fashion, begins at the top, but never gets to the bottom ; and
Stowe comes to a dead stop—a habit with the worthy antiquarian which
has given rise to the expression, “Stow(e) that,” when a request is made
to discontinue a thing altogether.
Having rejected at once all extraneous materials, we come to our own
resources, which are always inexhaustible. The sign of the Flower Pot
was the rallying point of the French Refugees, who planted there a fleur
de lis, and when the Restoration took
place, they gave the pot in which the
lily had flourished, to the landlord of
the house, as a trifling return for what
they owed him. It is said that Arthur
of Houndsditch, surnamed the Dog's-
meat Man, was the original introducer
of this pot into Bishopsgate Street;
while others affirm that...it was at the
Flower-Pot Wat Tyler first attempted
to plant his rebellious standard. The
Sieur Snooks, in his “Tailes of the
Towne,” alludes to the Pot de Fleurs,
which is probably the Flower-Pot ; and
Brown of Bayonne, in writing to Brooks
of Barcleause, in the 41st year of the
19th century, speaks of a parcel then
lying at the Flower-Pot, which it seems
was in danger of being sold (the parcel,
not the Flower-Pot) to pay the expense

Having said the whole of our say on the subject of the Flower Pot, we

Without.
A WARM RECEPTION.
In some of the Sunday papers of last week, was the advertisement of
“A Madeira Dwelling,”—a sort of social hot-house, kept at a uniformly
high temperature, for the benefit (?) of invalids. The owner adds, “One
or two domestics of Delicate Health and Superior Character may find an
advantageous employment.” This is very gratifying to sick servants; and
perhaps a few consumptive cooks, bilious butlers, paralytic pages, hysteri-
cal housemaids, and feverish footmen, will avail themselves readily of the
high-dried advantages held forth.
TESTIMONIAL TO THE SCOTCH MARTYRS.
This monument is at last finished, and is situated in the centre of the
Regent Circus. Its base is formed of blocks for the wooden pavement,
allegorical of the instigators of the memorial, making three sides of a
square; and the fourth consists of a light screen of scaffold poles and
wheelbarrows, typical of union and industry, which has a pleasing effect,
and serves as a haven for old ladies, pursued by omnibuses whilst crossing.
On the northern summit is fixed a standard, bearing a bill of the Princess's
Theatre; and at the southern, a large yellow tablet, on which is inscribed
the word “CARDINAL.” in gigantic letters, which may be seen from a
great distance, and is intended to express the virtues of the monument-
alees. The whole erection, which is a great object at this part of town,
is in the obstructo-composite style of architecture, and reflects great credit
upon the designers.

THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
Ch.APTER V.
OF THE GENERAL SOCIETY MET WITH AT THE LACQUERS’.
Oun friends the Lacquers have two distinct sets of acquaintances
—those whom they knew formerly in the city, and those that have
been introduced to them since they set up their west-end establish-
ment; and as these two parties do not very well harmonize, the
greatest skill and management is necessary to prevent any uncom-
fortable collisions. And so their assemblies are always the results
of much careful arrangement, except the large balls, where, owing to
the crowded state of the rooms, anybody can pass muster tolerably
well, from the mercantile friends of former times to the semi-unpro-
ducible relations of the present day. But those latter persons, being
low and uncivilized, think that consanguinity is a sufficient plea for
intimacy, and are always calling just when they ought not : in con-
sequence of which attention the Lacquers give them a set dinner
annually, “to keep up old feelings and natural affection,” as Mr.
Lacquer always says on these occasions. The period fixed for these
re-unions is generally as much out of the season as it can be, because
the semi-unproducibles are always happy to accept the invitations
of the Lacquels at any time ; and the early close of the day veils
the motley train of hack vehicles which, according to the usual
habits of vulgar people, always arrive together at the door within a
minute of the exact time.
Several distinguished foreigners—chiefly counts and barons—are
usually met with at the Lacquers' great parties; and then the hostess
addresses them in a louder tone than ordinary, and by their titles.
The greater part of the company know their faces very well in
Regent-street; or rather think they do : for the majority of
distinguished foreigners so much resemble one another, that we our.
selves have sometimes imagined we have seen the Lacquers' friends
in the most questionable haunts of London; but this must have been
a mistake—such imposing specimens of alien aristocracy could never
have stooped to visit the places in question. The Baron D’Etoffe is
the most popular of the continentalists. He is a rollicking young
cavalier of eight-and-forty, who finds much favour in the eyes of the
young ladies, by giving out that he has a large fortune, and is looking
after a wife. He is the only gentleman that the Misses Lacquer will
waltz with at a public ball ; and at any of these ten-and-sixpenny
Crown and Anchors of superior society, he is usually seen with the
prettiest girl of the room on his arm. Au reste, he is harmless, which
is much more than can be said of the majority of distinguished
foreigners who glitter in the parrenu drawing-rooms of our great
London. They all speak English with tolerable accuracy, but the
Misses Lacquer think it good breeding to keep up conversation
with them in their own language.
After a time some of these illustrious persons disappear, and are
heard of no more : others re-appear rather too prominently ; and are
heard of a great deal too much : and others again—perhaps, the majority
—tnay be met, when the season has passed, in the secluded streets at
the back of the towns of Kentish and Camden—spots which find
peculiar favour, as far as regards cheap rustication, in the eyes of the
million unshaven foreign adventurers who swarm over here annually,
for the sake of swindling their way into decent society, or robbing
poor John Bull in the impudent manner which that worthy gentleman
so quietly puts up with.
If you mention any one of these migratory beings, the Lacquers
will always tell you that it is not the same person whom you have
met at their house. Possibly not ; yet with all their aristocratic
bearing, we have sometimes trembled for the spoons when we have
narrowly watched two or three of these stars at the parties. And
the Lacquers afford greater room for this fear, from their tables being
always loaded with plate But this is a point of economy after all,
for people are not in the habit of devouring silver forks and candle-
sticks, and they cost nothing to keep when not in use; whilst with
their aid, a very little refreshment goes a very great way. Six brandy-
cherries in the branch of an epergne become prominent portions of
the feast, when they would be passed over in a saucer of blown glass.
The large vase of artificial flowers at the top—which, like the wreath
of Dr. Parr's maypole, is carefully put by when the fête has passed, to
come out again in undiminished glory at the next—does away with
the trifle, by occupying its place, and looks much more imposing.
The small mould of cream is aggrandised by the heavy moulding of
the dish on which it is placed ; and throughout the whole banquet
the same evidences appear of the economy of splendour. Indeed the
endeavour to pick out something slightly substantial, reminds you of
Sindbad hunting after food in the Valley of Diamonds, before the
merchants above threw down the legs of mutton. Equally, with the
Lacquers, are Blackwall and Greenwich tavern-keepers aware of the
power of plated dishes in increasing the importance of the viands
they contain ; or three or four pieces of stewed eel would never pass
muster as they do, in the eyes of the hungry guest who has just
quitted the river—to say nothing of salmon cutlets and sole fillets.
The young men who frequent the Lacquers' house, keep cabs, and
talk largely of their winnings at cards, and their clubs, although you
cannot distinctly understand to which they belong. Without being
regularly sporting men, they assume a great knowledge of dogs and
horses, and the state of the odds. Young Lacquer, from associating
with them, insensibly—(insensibly enough)—falls into their style of
conversation, and speaks about “making up his book” as a matter of
great moment; although it is believed by ordinary common-minded
people that a five-pound note would at any time cover his specu-
lations, whichever way luck might turn. He is, at present, keeping
his terms in the Temple; and sometimes honours those whom he
considers the more eligible of his fellow-students with invitations to
his house ; where, following the custom of unweaned barristers
generally, in after-dinner society, they differ in opinion with every-
body at table, for the sake of knocking up an argument; and this is
kept up with the greater powers of contradiction, in proportion to
the perfectly unimportant nature of the subject, and to the great
delight and edification of the other guests. Mr. Lacquer never joins
much in conversation, unless it relates to money or capital; and then
he appears to be so very humorous and entertaining, that his visitors
are continually laughing at him. Sometimes, to be sure, a slight trip
in his grammar carries back the mind of his auditor to the days of
his early education, but he is not courted one whit the less upon this
account. His money brings position, and position brings influence ;
and he enjoys the high gratification of affording room for his ac-
quaintances to place his skull far below his breeches pocket, in point
of value as to what it contains; for gold is the best joker in the
world—its sallies always tell.
You will always be certain to meet at the Lacquers' a great many
persons with whom you are perfectly well acquainted by sight, but to
whom you can assign no fixed position in society, having generally
met them in places where distinction was acquired by paying for it.
You will see them sailing up the avenues of a morning concert—they
cross your pathway in going to their carriages from Howell and
James's ; they brush against you at the conclusion of the performances
at the Opera; and they put their faith in Gunter firmly believing
that his ice is much colder than any one else's—at all events it is
expensive, which, placing it more out of the power of the common-
place million, must of course endow it with superior attributes of
some kind or another. It is this eligible class that forms the great
proportion of Mrs. Lacquer's visiting acquaintance at present ; and
the continual struggle between them all, to outdo the others in dis-
play, or anticipate them in some expensive novelty for the table or
palate, is one of the most amusing affairs in the world; and proves

that they work harder and experience many more cutting vexations
than the nobodies of the middling circles who do not enjoy a twentieth
part of their income ; but who nevertheless contrive occasionally, to
the extraordinary astonishment of Mrs. Lacquer and her friends, to
get into a particular sphere of society which they, with all their dash
and expenditure, are unable to accomplish.
LAW AND LAWYERS.
BY JACOB DRYASDUST, F.S.A.
EITHER Sir William Blackstone or Peter Pindar says, “The King is the
head and fountain of the Law.” The fact is undeniable, and therefore it
matters not on whose authority it rests; indeed, if necessary, I can give
conclusive testimony to that effect, as her Majesty lately sent me “greeting,”
with a request that I would remit Cabbage and Flint, my tailors, 31. 10s,
and their attorney 4l. 10s. . It would have afforded me much pleasure to
oblige the Queen, or any other lady, on such an occasion, had 1 possessed
the power to do so, and therefore Her Gracious Majesty guessing the real
state of the case, soon afterwards ordered the Sheriff of Middlesex to pay
great attention to me, because, as she kindly said, “We are informed he
lurks and wanders up and down in your Bailiwick.” The sheriff, who
thereupon instituted very particular inquiries, having had the pleasure of
meeting me in Oxford-street, introduced himself; and certainly did take
remarkable care of me, as he could not bear me out of his sight until I paid
the whole debt and costs, which I was fortunately enabled to do by means
of a tender conscience ; for my friends declared me a Church-rate
Martyr, and raised a very handsome subscription.
I intend to discuss the subject which heads this chapter in a grave and
serious style—I do not wish to poke my fun at that revered body of men
—the attorneys. I know well that an Act of Parliament has declared
them to be “Gentlemen,” and I know well that nothing but an Act of
Parliament could have induced the public to believe them such. It
is not for a defendant to complain of costs which he has incurred
through his own broken promises; nor must he consider twenty years'
hopeless º; an extreme punishment for a debt of 20l. For what
purpose were creditors created, if there should be no debtors And what
was the use of building such spacious and elegant prisons, if nobody should
inhabit them :
Law may be compared to a new boot—a luxury which we approach
with undisguised reluctance, and quit with supreme delight—a thing
which transforms the ordinarily calm and placable man into a living tor.
ment to himself and all around him. There are several kinds of
“actions,” all equally horrible and astounding to the defendant, who
finds the fact of his owing four guineas for a dress coat recited in the
most mystic terms by a composition called a “ declaration,” which
gravely commences with.--" For that whereas,” and then proceeds to
aver that he is indebted “in 100l. for goods sold and delivered.” “100l.
for work and labour done and performed,” “100l. for materials found and
provided,” “100l. for money paid, laid out, and expended,” and “100l.
due on account stated.” To this the “plea” very civilly answers that
ODE to MY tailor.
the defendant never had the goods, does not owe the money, and never
promised to pay. Then succeeds a “Replication,” and to that a
“Rejoinder ;” a “Surrejoinder" next appears, in awful dignity, fol-
lowed by a “Rebutter,” and then comes a “Surrebutter,” and so on,
until every species of attack and defence being exhausted, the parties
declare themselves satisfied, and prepare a “Brief,” so called on account
of its enormous length, having first enjoined the sheriff to catch “twelve
good and lawful men” to appear as jurors. This is one kind of action ;
there are, however, several others, all highly interesting to the parties
concerned.
The public attention is often forcibly attracted to reports of proceedings
in the Admiralty Court, headed “The Queen against Twenty Casks of
Brandy.” People naturally wonder at her Majesty's apparent antipathy
to foreign spirits, little imagining that she is really seeking to make them her
own. When a man's nose has been pulled, instead of stating the fact in plain
terms,he derives a melancholy satisfaction from declaring that the defendant
assaulted him “ with swords, staves, sticks, stones, cudgels, fists, and
bludgeons; and thereby and therewith beat, wounded, ill-treated, pum-
melled, kicked, maimed, bruised, and otherwise damaged him, and spoilt the
clothes he then and there had on, to wit: 6 coats, 6 waistcoats, 6 pair of
trousers, 6 pairs of Boots, 6 hats, and 6 cloaks.” The plaintiff, I say, may
well comfort himself by reflecting on the dangers he has providentially
escaped, and this inventory of his wardrobe (although it makes him seem
somewhat like a Jew clothesman) is very delightful, as proving wealth and
respectability. The most distinguishing feature in an attorney's character is
philanthropy; he is the avenger of the oppressed, the champion of the
innocent, and the benignant patron of the barrister. This last-named
official wears a horse-hair wig, to prevent his own hair standing on an end
when reciting the dreadful wickedness of the opposite party; he invariably
assures the Court that he never rose to address them with such feelings as
agitate his bosom “on the present occasion ;” and he calls the twelve very
common-looking men who compose the Common Jury “an intelligent and
most respectable body;” he always asks a witness who comes to prove a
man's handwriting, how often he has been bankrupt, or taken “the
benefit "-whether he is living with his wife—and, if not—why not
all this being very material to show that the coat in question was worth
four guineas only, instead of five, and besides very agreeable to the
witness's feelings, who has an opportunity of indulging the audience with
a little small talk about his own rise and progress in life. The judge's duty
is to snub the counsel on both sides, and bother the jury by furnishing them
with a third method of looking at a case. The crier is a gentleman appointed
to drown the noise of all other people by his own system of commanding
silence ; he is also deputed to get half-a-crown from the winner, if
possible, which is invested in the purchase of half-and-half for the
Attorney-General.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL ECONOMY.
CONSUMPTION.
EveRY product is put to some purpose after it is created—for instance,
when sloe leaves are grown, they are used for adulterating tea, and the
destruction of values in this way is called consumption. When a joke is
spoiled in the telling, the destruction of the value amounts to consumption.
And when an insolvent person puts his hand to a bill he may be said to
consume a stamp, for he destroys its value. Political economists have,
however, omitted to mention that consumption sometimes bestows value
instead of destroying it, for when a person goes into a consumption he
becomes invested with value—as a patient—to the medical practitioner.
CAPITAL.
We have already touched on capital, but it is a subject which we are
unwilling to let go, and it may be profitable to return to it. That is,
strictly speaking, capital, which is used by men in their different occupations.
Thus a man who writes a farce, though it be very bad, still, when finished,
he generally thinks he has a right to call it capital. An author who
publishes a novel may consider it capital; though capital of this kind very
often carries with it no interest.
CHANGES OF CAPITAL.
Capital is incessantly undergoing change, and political economy of this
kind is daily illustrated at the foot of Waterloo Bridge, where, if you
tender a penny, change will be given you. Some persons carry their love
of political economy so far as to tender bad silver, and the change is capital
for them, but not for the parties giving it. Capital may sometimes be
subjected to such changes that it is wholly lost sight of, as when it is
invested in theatrical speculations or joint stock companies.
WESTMINSTER : COMMON PLEAS.
We have received, by express, our Reporter's note-book from this
Court, bringing up its details to the close of last week. The only cases of
importance during that time, were two motions for judgment against the
Casual Ejector, and an unimportant rule for judgment as in the case of
a non-suit. The learned Judges intimated in the latter case, that as they
had nothing to do, they should take time to consider their judgment; and
it is fully expected that a solemn decision will be pronounced some time
during this term. As the cases referred to are of no sort of importance to
any person except the learned Members of this Court, we shall not trouble
our readers with their details.
In the absence of other matter, our reporter informs us, that a learned
Serjeant is to go in the capacity of Judge on the Western Circuit. This
unusual circumstance is said, in Westminster Hall, to result from these
facts. The learned leaders on the Western Circuit are very fond, it
seems, of the beginning and middle of their speeches, but very much

dislike their end, which they therefore try to postpone
(like other disagreeable things) to the latest possible period.
This obliges the Judges on the Circuit to sleep a good deal
in Court; which the Judges in the Queen's Bench and Ex-
chequer, from their constant activity, and the restlessness
of mind it produces under idleness, find it very difficult
to do. It has been accordingly suggested to Her Gracious
Majesty—which she has in the most condescending manner
approved of—that one of the Judges and one of the Ser-
jeants of the Common Pleas should be sent on this Circuit,
as the very little they have had to do a long time past
has induced habits of sleep that will exactly fit them for
their duties. This arrangement has given great satisfac-
tion, we understand, to the leaders of the Western Circuit,
as they confidently expect to speak now as long as they
please without interruption.
Our reporter adds, that the Judges of this Court wish it
to be generally understood among their friends, that they
are not generally at home till twelve o'clock, as they cannot
get away from their Court till nearly that hour. All calls
on them, therefore, should be made before half-past ten,
when they go to Westminster, or after twelve, when they
return. The learned Serjeants do not get home till twenty
minutes later than the Judges, as they are in the habit of
first going to Serjeant's Inn to see if any motions have come
in for the next day.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER W.—SOME ACCOUNT OF BACCHUS.
Bacchus was the God of fermented liquors, their
appurtenances, effects, and consumers. His dominion
is much more extensive now than it was among the
ancients, who could not boast, like the moderns, of a
“large assortment” of wines; and who, although
among their vinous beverages there was one prepared
from barley, were unacquainted with true beer. The
era, however, of Barclay and Perkins, of Reid and Co.,
and of Guinness, at length arrived; and stout, draught
and bottled, porter, half-and-half, together with the
various ales, acknowledged his divine authority. His
empire has of late received an accession in the shape of
Bass's pale Indian ale, and will, no doubt, from the
progress of invention and intemperance, continue to
derive others. The discovery of distillation entailed
upon him a new title, that of the “Ruler of Spirits;”
though it must not be supposed that Weber's glorious
overture of that name related to Bacchus : the spirits
whereof he is the ruler not being the spirits of the
elements, but the exciseable spirits, as whisky, brandy,
rum, gin, and Hollands.
To the cyathi, calices, and other few drinking vessels
which were formerly sacred to Bacchus, decanters,
tumblers, and rummers have been added in these latter
days ; wherein, also, he has become the god of goes,
and the patron of pots and pipes.
Not only is the worship of Bacchus still maintained,
but it is perhaps more prevalent than any other; espe-
cially in this country, and above all in this town, where
temples, termed gin-palaces, devoted to its celebration,
abound in every street.
Many of his subjects have been lately seduced from
their allegiance by Father Mathew, and not a few
others have been prevented from doing him that
homage which in their hearts they would fain have
Paid, in consequence of the operation of the Income-
tax, which has occasioned a retrenchment in grog, and
consequently a defalcation in the revenue. However,
as the very rich drink as much as they please, and the
very poor as much as they can get, Bacchus can afford
the loss.
Bacchus, according to the mythologists, came, like
several other gods, into the world, that is, into heaven,
in a very odd way. Thus it was. His mother Semele
had for some months been added, quite under the rose,
to the matrimonial establishment ofJupiter. Fame, how-
ºver, at last discovered the secret, which she instantly
Irumpeted into Juno's ears. Now the Queen of Heaven
afterwards, under similar circumstances did—she would instantly have enforced
on her rival the option of cold steel or prussic acid, had she dared ; but
Jupiter had sworn by the Styx that if she offered the slightest violence to
any of his other wives, he would give her his sceptre—about her back. He
had even hinted at Tartarus and thunderbolts; and she knew he was not to be
trifled with.
“I can't be revenged on that creature by hook,” thought Juno ; “but I
will by crook, though.” So she put on an old cloak and bonnet, screwed up her
face into the likeness of an old woman's, and walked into Semele's chamber as
Beroë her nurse. In this shape she persuaded her that the person who had
palmed himself upon her for Jupiter was a humbug.

Never listen to old women. Semele did ; and mark the consequences. The
next time Jupiter called, she made him promise to grant her whatever she should
ask, which he readily agreed to do, taking his customary affidavit.
“Then I desire,” said the lady, “that you will pay your next visit to me in
state.”
“Certainly, my dear,” answered Jupiter, “if you wish it; but there is one slight
objection to your persisting in your request.”
“What is that ?” demanded Semele.
“Only,” replied the monarch, “that if I come in my thunder and lightning,
which, you know, is my court dress, I shall most inevitably burn you up to a
cinder.”
“I don’t care 1* said Semele. She did not believe her husband ; and her fate
supplies us, or rather our wives, with another moral. Jupiter was a god of his
word; and as she would insist upon his coming, sure enough he came. The con-
sequence was that she was consumed in his embrace in about half a minute.
Among her ashes was discovered a fine infant, whose divinity, which he had
derived from Jupiter, had rendered him fire-proof. “Sweep up your mistress,”
said Jupiter to the attendants, “and put up that incombustible young dog with
Ino in the rumble.” His command was obeyed; and away they all started for
Olympus.
Now the facts upon which the above tale was founded, probably were, that
Semele, the mother of Bacchus, fell a martyr to a love of liquor; her system, from
excessive drinking, having got into such a state, that she went off one night in
spontaneous combustion; that little Bacchus, then an infant at her breast, had
the luck to escape unsinged: that in process of time he grew up to keeping a
public-house, was regarded as the prince of pot-companions during his life, and
came, after his death, to be regarded as their god.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
If Bacchus did not actually suck in a fondness for drink with his
mother's milk, he acquired it soon
after being weaned. He was placed
by his father, Jupiter, as a pupil
under Silenus, an old fellow with
the appearance of Socrates, and the
habits of Professor Porson, who
used to ride about Arcadia on a
jackass, very drunk, attended by
Fauns and Satyrs. Thus favour-
ably circumstanced for the acqui-
sition of knowledge, Bacchus soon
learned to drink as effectually as he -
could have done at Cambridge, or : - -*
elsewhere. *====="
Some say that by this early drinking the growth of Bacchus was
stopped, and thus account for his being sometimes depicted as a fat
infant, with a bunch of grapes, sitting astride on a barrel. This,
however, was more probably a likeness of him taken when he was a
little god; because he is also represented as a fine young man, with
ivy all round his hat or head, and a thyrsus for a sceptre.
Bacchus had a great aversion to tee-totallers, whom he often
punished for their contempt of his divinity; and even now he
frequently instigates his votaries to interfere with their “demonstra-
tions.” Hence arise sundry rows, productive of torn banners,
sanguinary noses, black eyes, and broken heads.
Among the things over which Bacchus presides, should have been
mentioned the articles in Punch. This statement, to be sure, is a
little ambiguous; but (to borrow the beautiful legend of the knightly
garter), “Honi soit qui mal y pense.”

“the light of other days.”
Copper is a mille dearer at Seringapatam than at Cheapside, and brass
being two-eighths cheaper in Kamtschatka than at Charing-cross, gives an
exchange of a ninth and three-twelfths in favour of London.
Every Arab is speaking of the glut of money; but as our own corre-
spondent has asked us for a week's salary in advance, we have no faith in
the statement.
There was a great demand for copper at all the principal crossings, and
so it may be said that the clearing went off as well as any one could anti-
cipate. Bullion was scarce in the early part of the day, but a party
came in towards the close of business with change for a five pound note,
which gave a fresh impetus to all the transactions.
German silver was at a small discount, and Dutch (dolls) were quoted at
much the same as yesterday. Something was done in Abyssinian deben-
tures, and Chelsea scrip was dull at nothing, on account of the old holders
having been proceeded against on their personal liability.
THE SEASON.
OUR boy informs us that the notes of the cuckoo were heard in the
Lowther Arcade, amongst the toy-shops, last week; and the same day he
observed a quantity of violets in the open air on the sunny side of Regent
Street.
The silver-paper water-lilies in the fire-place of Mrs. Tweak's spare
room at Hackney, are now in high perfection; as well as that lady's
worsted tulips and cockle-shell camellias, on the side table, which have
bloomed uninterruptedly all the winter.
Mr. Jones, of this city, left off his great-coat on Saturday night last, in
the neighbourhood of his uncle's ; and the nightingale was heard in the
New Cut on the same evening, near the spot where the man usually
stands who blows the whistle into a cup of water.
Mr. Twits informs us that the mercury in his barometer fell so low on
Friday, as to be quite invisible on the index plate. He ultimately dis-
covered that the servant had broken the bulb of the tube, and it had all
run out. The same day the kitten pulled out the little man in the red
coat who lives in Mrs. Twits's weather-house so far, that he would not go
back again. A heavy storm was the result.
BLASTING OF THE GREAT COPPER IN THE DOVER-
ROAD.—GRAND ENGINEERING TRIUMPH.
This stupendous undertaking was successfully achieved last week, and
the flue, which had been in the foulest state for nearly a month, is now
thoroughly clear. So great is the power of art when opposed to anything
of this nature.
At an early hour Mrs. Snooks, attended by the children, met the laun-
dress in the front kitchen, and a short consultation having been held, the
whole party adjourned to the wash-house. By way of i. signals to
the surrounding neighbourhood, lines were fastened in the back yard to
nails in the wall, from which they were ingeniously carried, by means of
wooden poles, backwards and forwards in every direction, so as to com-
municate north, east, south, and west with the massive brickwork. It
was now exactly a quarter to eight, and the excitement was intense
among the children, who pressed forward towards the copper with inde-
scribable eagerness. They were, however, kept back by the hand-broom,
under the immediate direction of Mrs. Sutton, the laundress, who as
engineer-in-chief, was invested with perfect control over the whole of
the proceedings. The gunpowder, consisting of three penn'orth, was
now produced, and a portion of it laid under the chimney, through
which a passage was intended to be blown by the powerful influ-
ence of human skill aided by material violence. Mrs. Sutton, who
behaved admirably throughout the whole of the trying occasion, now
inspected the paper containing the destructive agent, and with great daring
at once emptied the remainder of the three penn'orth into the place where
a moiety of the power-generating substance (vulgo—the gunpowder) had
already been deposited. The word was now given for everybody to retire,
and the whole party withdrew from the washhouse, except Mrs. Sutton
herself, whose gallant conduct throughout the morning was the theme of
admiration among all present. In a few seconds this noble woman had
drawn a lucifer across the brickwork, and hastening without any visible
trepidation to the mouth of the copper, she threw in the lighted match
with a precision of aim that could only have resulted from a cool head
and a steady hand, both of which are peculiarly the property of Mrs.
Sutton. A second only had elapsed when a smothered explosion was heard,
a quantity of smoke issued from the aperture of the copper, and a compact
mass of thick soot sailed majestically along, gliding noiselessly until it
reached the ground, where it seemed to repose after the disturbance to
which it had been subjected. A hearty cheer from Mrs. Sutton
announced the fait accompli, and the children having rushed in, the
mistress of the house, with tears in her eyes, embraced the “engineer in
chief,” who swallowed with intense rapidity and ill-subdued emotion a
glass of gin that had been poured out for her. It will hardly be believed
that this astonishing woman went through the day's wash as if nothing
had happened.

LITERARY AND LEARNED.
We have had a letter bringing down the doings of the Learned Pig to
the 26th, when the sagacious animal was at at a small village in the North,
and was visited by all but the Cognoscenti, who studiously and enviously
kept away from him. The sagacious animal had been spelling Dover, but
his faculties are said to be on the wane, for he now wants much more kicking
and pushing up to the letters than he did heretofore. The learned animal
is still famous for his quickness in pointing out the north, for it is only
necessary to pull his tail vigorously to the south, and he becomes as
sharp as the needle in running towards the Polar regions.

Doubtful Plays of Shakspeare. Now, sir, that there may be nothing
wanting to such a national work, will you allow me through your columns
to offer to Mr. KNIGHT a score of MSS. in my possession, to be printed

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPTER W.— PATTY BUTLER FINISHES HER WORK.—A WORD ON
LONDON GARRETS.—A RUFFIAN.—PATTY IN THE WATCH-HOUSE.
Patty's loss of her mother was quickly known; and as quickly
was the chamber of death filled with poor neighbours—the needy,
suffering, squalid, ay, and even vicious denizens of that miserable,
fetid alley. Touched by sympathy, in the very fulness of heart, utter
destitution proffered service and assistance to the motherless girl—
when its only aid was a comforting look ; its only means, the starting
tear: nature, forgetful of its worldly destitution, spoke only from the
abundance of its pity. Old, care-lined faces—with the ugliness of
habitual want sharpening and deforming them—looked kind and
gentle, for the time refined and humanised by the awakened spirit of
human love. These pressed about the sufferer, and with trite words
of comfort—with old and common phrases of compassion—(the best
rhetoric the talkers had to offer), tried to soothe the stricken girl.
“God help her "cried an old crone, with melting looks, though with
the features of a sybil. “God will help her!” cried a young creature,
sobbing, whilst the tears ran down her cheeks, washing from them
the branding rouge that set apart the speaker. So earnest was the
voice that Patty raised her head from her hands, and her eyes meeting
the eyes of her girl neighbour—of the poor, reckless thing, often so
heedless and laughing in her very despair; of her, who a hundred
times when passing in the lane, by venom words and brassy looks,
had taunted and out-stared the simple, gentle feather-dresser—
Patty felt a communion of heart in the deep sincerity of that
assurance of God's help, and through her tears smiled dimly, yet
thankfully, affectionately on her comforter. The blighted girl, thus
recognised, was about to seize Patty to her arms with the folding of
a sister: she then shrunk back as at a ghost, and, as though poison
had suddenly shot through all her veins, trembled from head to foot,
whilst the paleness of death rose beneath the paint, in ghastly
contrast of mortality and shame. With a half-suppressed moan, the
girl darted down stairs, and rushed to her only place of refuge—the
horrid street.
Happily, the kindness of Mr. Lintly, the apothecary, rendered the
assistance of the neighbours—could they have offered any beyond
the kindness of mere words—needless. Lintly was doomed to,
perhaps, the most penal condition of poverty; that is, to an outside
show of comfort, with that gnawing, snapping fox, penury, eating to
the bowels within ; was one of the thousand grown-up Spartans who,
with aching hearts and over-jaded faculties, turn a sliding outside
look on London streets. Nevertheless, Lintly determined that
Patty's mother should not go to the earth in workhouse deals; for
though his philosophy smiled at the vanities of the undertaker, it
had still, in its very elevation, the better part of philosophy, a benign
and charitable consideration for the weakness, the prejudice, yea, for
the folly of others. Thus, all things necessary for that last scene of
life—in which the man, though dead, still plays a part—were duly
ordered at the charge of Mr. Lintly, and—how few the hours –
Patty sat and worked beside her coffined mother.
“Now, child—do come down stairs—do, now ; you'll be comfort-
able there,” urged an old woman, a lodger, to Patty, seeking to win
her from the place of death.
“Thank you, I am better here—happier—indeed I am,” said Patty,
with sweetest meekness.
“Well, but it's getting late and dark,” said the woman, “and ain’t
you afraid "
“Afraid " . Of what should I be afraid "asked the girl.
“Well, to be sure, for a young thing you’ve a bold heart; but when
I was a girl, I could have no more staid alone with anybody dead—”
“Not if you loved them f" interrupted Patty.
k “Why, love's something, to be sure; but still death, my dear, you
now—”
“Takes fear from love, and as I feel it, makes love stronger. I
loved her when she was here, and must I not love her—still more
love her—now she is an angel I tell you, it comforts me to be
alone—it does indeed,” said Patty.
“Well, to be sure 1 if ever ! who could have thought " and the
old woman would have proceeded in her exclamations,
“But if you'll be kind enough to stay here till I come back from
Mr. Flamingo—”
“To be sure; Mrs. Shroudly and me will stay,” said the woman.
“You will so serve me ! In half-an-hour I shall have finished my
work; I shall soon be back.”
“And you'll sleep here alone in this room to-night?” asked the
querist.
For a moment Patty could not speak: then, with a torrent of
tears, and a voice of anguish, she answered—“It is the last, it is the
last.”
The well-meaning neighbour left the room, and by the last light
of a golden August evening, Patty completed her task. Her work
was done; and the room darkened, darkened about her. She sat
fearless, self-sustained in the gloom ; her thoughts made solemn and
strengthened by the atmosphere of death which fell upon her spirit.
She felt as in a holy presence. That poor, weak, ignorant creature—
in the exaltation of her soul, communed with her mother in the skies;
talked, wept, prayed to her, and was comforted. And for that which
lay apart—for that mute, dull semblance of the thing that was—it
was for a time forgotten in the rapturous grief that sorrowed at its
loss. Thus passed the girl an hour of darkness, made bright by
spiritual dreams; and then, calmed and sustained, she prepared to
venture into the roaring street, to take home her work completed.
Unseen, unknown, are the divinities that—descending from garrets
— tread the loud, foul, sordid, crowding highways of London
Spiritual presences, suffering all things, and in the injustice—most
hard to turn to right—of our social purpose, living and smiling, daily
martyrs to their creed of good. Young children, widowed age, and
withered singleness—the ardent student, flushed and fed with little
else but hope—the disappointed, yet brave, good old man, a long,
long loser in the worldly fight, who has retired apart, to bleed unseen,
and uncomplaining die—the poor and stern man, only stern in truth—-
sour of speech, with heart of honied sweetness—all of these, in all
their thousand shades of character and spirit—the “army of martyrs”
to fortune, and the social iniquities that, drest and spangled for truths,
man passes off on man—all of this bright band have, and do, and will
consecrate the garrets of London, and make a holy thing of poverty
by the sacrificial spirit with which they glorify her. Many of these
are to be known—but more escape the searching eyes of the quickest
mortal vision. There is a something—a “look of service” in the
aspect of some ; a depression that elevates, a dogged air of courage
that speaks the fighting man in poverty's battalions—an honourable,
undisguised threadbareness that marks the old campaigner | Are not
his darns more beautiful than best work of Sidonian needles—is there
a patch about him that is not, morally assayed, true cloth of gold
And has not such Poverty its genii, its attending spirits Oh, yes |
a bloodless glory is its body-guard, and its tatter-bearer an angel.
And does not some such presence walk with Patty Butler down the
Strand, on to the house of Peter Flamingo, feather-merchant to the
Court 1 Stay: who is it, that now addresses her ?
There is a tall creature hanging about her steps—now, shifting to
the right side, now the left; now behind and now before. And now
he inclines himself, and says something to the ear of Patty, who—
with her thoughts in that room of misery and desolation—cannot heed
him, but with her tears in her throat, walks quicker and quicker,
silent and choking.
“If you havn't a tongue, I'll see if you've lips 1”—exclaimed, not the
No. 83.

good angel of Patty Butler,-and the speaker threw his arms about
the girl, who shrieked with misery and terror. Ere, however, the
sound had died upon his ear, the ruffian had measured his length
upon King George the Third's highway.
Luke Knuckle, Mr. Flamingo's porter, had been sent to Patty to
hurry her with her work. Arriving at the house but two or three
minutes after her departure, he had followed closely on her steps, and
was thus in a most advantageous situation for the proper application
of his fist, at a most dramatic point of time. -
“Watch watch 1” roared the fellow, still upon his back; for with.
evidently a quick sense of the magnanimity of Britons, he felt that
the only means of escaping a second blow was to use nothing but his
lungs.
ºwhat, the matter t” asked a watchman, who miraculously
happened to be near the spot.
“I’m robbed,” was the answer.
“Robbed 1” and the watchman sprung his rattle.
“Robbed I" was the lie repeated; “and I desire you take to the
watch-house that pickpocket”—and the speaker pointed to Knuckle
—“and that —” but the word was lost in the noise of a newly-sprung
rattle.
The watchmen gathered together, and Patty Butler with her honest
champion was taken to the watch-house of St. Martin-in-the-Fields.
EQUESTRIAN GLACIARUM.
Horslydown, Feb. 3, 1843.
SIR,-This is perhaps the first instance of one of my species appearing
as the correspondent of a Journalist ; but, Sir, I know not why the senti-
ments of a “noble” race should be concealed. We have been many
years before the public; the comforts and luxuries of society depend
much upon our exertions. I beg, with your permission, to thank the
City authorities for their kindness in laying down for me and my brethren
a Glaciarum, or Wood pavement, in the Poultry, where we may be seen
practising daily from inorning to night the elegant art of skating.
I am sure the Society for Preventing Cruelty to Animals never, con-
templated such a provision for our pleasure and amusement, nor did we
ever expect to have such an opportunity of displaying the superiority of
four legs over two in the graceful accomplishment alluded to.
Your most obedient servant,
AN OLD STAGER.
A FEW worDS ABOUT SHAKSPERE.
BY OTWAY.
PERHAPs the most important question connected with this great man's
career is how he used to spell his name, and we have therefore made it
the study of a long literary life to look into this nice autographical point ;
a task in which we have been kept in countenance by the labours of some
of the most famous commentators.
Somebody in the last century found a piece of paper somewhere, with
something written upon it, that had some resemblance to Shakespere's
signature, and upon this very powerful evidence the a in speare was
knocked out, and an additionale after the syllable Shak was knocked in ;
but the literary and antiquarian world never felt completely satisfied,
and black letter authorities have ever since continued to be rummaged, for
the purpose of finding out whether the bard of Avon wrote his name
with AA’s or with EE’s, or with both or neither.
From the rascally scrawl which is handed down as the veritable
signature of the Swan—as some people affectedly call the author of
Othello, it is to be regretted that there were no Carstairs' in those days to
give the Swan a little instruction in handling the goose-quill. The
play scene in Hamlet, might have been framed and glazed by Mr. Car-
stairs' supposing the Swan to have taken the trouble of going over his
work twice, as a specimen of Shakespere's writing “before and after ’’
the well known guinea's worth.
We now leave Shakespere for the present. We have left his name
and the mode of spelling it exactly where we found it, which is more
than most critics can say, for they generally contrive to throw additional
darkness over what was already sufficiently mysterious.
3Bumtb's “QCourt Circular.”
Maids of Honour.
On Wednesday last the play-going public were doomed to be disappointed.
The state visits of Her Majesty to the two theatres have of late been so
regular—her gracious determination to patronize the pure English drama
has been so strongly, so significantly manifested, that a weekly visit on the
part of the Queen to either Drury-Lane or Covent-Garden is now an
occurrence looked for by the town—a holiday set apart for a rejoicing
people. To read that Her Majesty and Prince Albert paid a state-visit
to Drury-Lane last night, is no more than to learn that “Her Majesty and
Prince Albert walked in the vicinity of the Castle this morning. Her
Majesty and her illustrious Consort again promenaded in the afternoon.”
It may be said to be a standing paragraph in the Court Circular.
Last Wednesday, however (Her Majesty and Consort were to have
attended Drury-Lane), there was no royal visit. From this circumstance,
however, let not the public imagine that Her Majesty does not feel the
same intense interest for the pure drama and its lofty inspirations that she
always did; but the fact is, state matters of the gravest moment (they
could be nothing less), denied her the gratification which she has hitherto
so constantly enjoyed. There was to have been a new one-act comedy
produced on the occasion, called Angels' Visits ; its representation was,
however, under the circumstances, deferred until honoured by the next
royal “command.”
The late visit of the King of Prussia to England has been productive of
the greatest social advantages to his own country. By a letter (“from
our own correspondent”) from Berlin, we learn that his Majesty, in-
structed by what he saw at the Court of England, has followed the goodly
example, set him by her Gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria; hence, the
royal table of Prussia is as frequently graced by men “illustrious by
deeds” as by those only “illustrious by courtesy.” Following the
English custom, his Majesty invites to his banquets authors, astronomers,
sculptors, painters, geologists, and others—“princes of the realm of
thought”—who take their places with the highest titles of the land.
For this, the men of genius of Prussia have to thank the lesson taught
their King by his experience at Buckingham Palace and Windsor.
The movements of the Court for the past week have been of their
ordinary character. Prince Albert has shot, walked, and driven—driven,
walked, and shot. Several sittings have also been awarded to royal
portrait-painters.
On Thursday, covers were laid for forty. Among the ladies present
were the Duchess of Norfolk and Mrs. Somerville—the Dowager Lady
Lyttleton and Miss Joanna Baillie—the Duke of Buccleuch and Mr.
Sheridan Knowles—the Duke of Beaufort and Professor Airey :—the
Duke of Bedford and Mr. Faraday had also the honour of a “command”
to the royal table. Besides these the list included the Earl of Haddington
and Mr. Edwin Landseer—the Lord Chancellor and Mr. Barry, architect
of the houses of parliament. Many other visitors distinguished by their
rank in the peerage and their station in the literature, arts and science
of the country, were entertained at the hospitable board of Windsor.
FIN E A R T S.
(very important.)
WINDsor, Friday.—Yesterday, Mr. F. G. Moon, the distinguished
print-seller of Threadneedle-street, City, again arrived to submit to the
inspection of Her Majesty and Prince Albert, another royal gift received
by him at his shop within the past week. The present was, on this occa-
sion, a very handsome green parrot, in a wooden cage, sent to Mr. Moon
by King Tantararara (reigning monarch of Otaheite) in acknowledgment
of Mr. Moon's own magnificent print, The Death of Cock Robin, painted
by JENKINs PoundBRUSH, Esq., R.A. The bird was a very handsome
specimen of an undiscovered species ; and it will be gratifying to those
interested in the civilization of the Sandwich Islands, to learn that such is
the appreciation of English lyrics by the natives, such the refined spirit of
compliment animating the breast of King Tantararara—that the parrot,
ere it departed from its island-home, had been perfectly instructed in
BARNETT's beautiful air of, Rise Gentle Moon t—which air it immediately
struck up on being deposited upon Mr. M.'s counter. On the present
occasion Her Majesty and Prince Albert condescended to hear the parrot
sing Rise Gentle Moon l (this time with variations,) and to graciously
express their satisfaction at the same. The bird's cage, made by
Otaheitan artists, was also much admired. Mr. Moon and the Green
Parrot left for town by an early train.

THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
chapter v1.-A DINNER PARTY AT THE LACQUERs'.
Having introduced our readers to the Spangle Lacquers, and some
of their connections, we will now reunite them at a dinner party
given by this superior family. Or rather we will attempt to do so;
for it is difficult to write through music, and an attendant demon of
annoyance is beneath our window playing “ 0 nume benefico" very
slowly, on a piano organ, and chirping an accompaniment to it on a
bird-whistle, more or less in a different key. So-he is gone to worry
the neighbours at last, and we may now proceed.
Those accustomed to mix in society upon whose opinion we can
rely, have decided that dinner parties originated in remote ages from
a desire on the part of the giver to collect around him those friends
in whose society he felt the greatest pleasure. But time effects
singular changes, and the Spangle Lacquers, at the present day, in
company with many others, appear only anxious to invite those with
whom they are constantly sparring for position in the vast arena of
fiddle-faddle gentility; entirely forgetting also, that the social observ-
ances of the real aristocracy, however proper when confined to the
class amongst whom they arose, become pitifully ludicrous in the
imitations of second or third rate establishments.
A grand dinner party at the Lacquer's is a dreary festival of osten-
tation; and yet the guests must think it pleasant and entertaining,
or they would not come. We must confess that our own ideas of
sociability are somewhat different; but it does not follow that they
are right, nor would we have them considered the standard of general
opinion in consequence.
As we are in the habit of seeing only one phase of life, and that an
inferior one, we dined at the Lacquers' a short time ago, having first
studied the Hints upon Etiquette for some days previously, that we
might not commit ourselves by any unpolished action. , Half-past six
for seven was the appointed feeding-time ; and at the latter hour we
presented ourselves at the house, and were ushered, with due solem-
nity, into the drawing-room. Nobody had yet assembled beyond the
family, who were all sitting, en grande tenue, upon the embroidered
sofas and ottomans, divested for that day of their chintz skins. The
majority of the guests, however, arrived within twenty minutes of
the time : and then we heard from each what singular weather it was
for the time of year, and how rapidly town was filling. Mrs. Lacquer
kept casting such anxious glances at the spidery hands of a large or-
molu timepiece, that we saw the whole of the party had not come to
their time; and, at about a quarter to eight, Mr. and Mrs. Fitzmoses
were ushered into the room, and Mrs. Spangle Lacquer told them
how very happy she was to see them—which I believe, at the mo-
ment, was the case. We were much amused to hear young Lacquer
tell his sister “that the Fitzmoses were not in a position to keep
people waiting so long, although they always did it.” By this we
learnt a custom of which we were before ignorant—that the higher
the station people acquire in life, the later they may come to a dinner-
party. We have no doubt, allowing an hour to every degree, that
after twenty-four ascending ranks, supposing it brings us to a duke,
his invitation is always meant to imply the same hour on the day
after that for which it is given. Mr. Fitzmoses also brought his hat
up into the drawing-room; and as soon as we saw this was the
custom of the leading guest, although we did not exactly see its im-
port, we regretted we had not brought up our own thirteen-and-six-
penny chapeau de soie, to produce a like effect.
After much manoeuvring on the part of Mrs. Lacquer to get the
most eligible persons together, with proper regard to their precedency,
we went down stairs in very grave procession, and finally settled into
our respective places. The brilliancy of the table so dazzled us, that
we have not a distinct recollection of the first ten minutes, except
convulsively swallowing some white soup, which one of the servants
appeared to insist upon our tasting. But when the fish was served,
we began to see the triumph of form over comfort. The plates were
costly, and the devices heraldic, but we could get no lobster sauce;
the forks were heavy and richly chased, but the cayenne was detained
at the bottom of the room by the apparent combination of the foot-
men. So we ate our two inches of turbot au naturel, and made up
with bread, pretending that we liked it best in that fashion; indeed,
as a dead silence reigned over the table during the entire course, we
picked our little French roll entirely to pieces, for the express pur-
pose to appear to be doing something and not feeling uncomfort-
able. But with all our endeavours to appear civilised, we sadly com-
mitted ourselves in asking for some beer—a liquid prepared from
a preparation of barley, formerly drunk at dinner, during the savage
state of English society. We had seen nothing about its impropriety
in the Hints upon Etiquette, and had, therefore, ventured to ask for it—
the more so, because when we once took luncheon with the Lac-
quers, we saw them all drink a very fair quantity of the outlawed
beverage. But when we witnessed the haggard look of the butler
upon asking him for it—when we saw Mrs. Lacquer nearly fainting,
and the young ladies glancing at us as if we had been the Chinese
Ambassador, we perceived that we had sunk beyond redemption in
their esteem; and for the time, determined never to go into high
society again, but enjoy our diurnal pint of stout, or half-and-half, as
the case might be, at home. For there are still certain spots in
London where the discarded liquid may be obtained ; but these are
in very low neighbourhoods, which the Lacquers never heard of.
The pageant went on in the ordinary routine of dinner-party solem.
nity; in which cutlets of grave expression, and patties of aristocratic
demeanour, made their appearance, and vanished—these being in
company, with the generality of side-dishes, things that nobody ever
thinks of taking, and which might be just as well made, for show
alone, out of papier mâché. Then, we should have liked a little wine,
but no one asked us to take any, and we knew no one near us to ask;
besides which we had a blue glass, and an amethyst-coloured glass,
and a broad shallow glass, and a tall glass, and a tumbler; all which
varieties exceedingly perplexed us ; and we heard afterwards that
taking wine with people “had gone out of fashion,” but that the
servant came round and filled for you. “Out of fashion,” pah I
away with such twaddle. Taking wine with another person was not
a very imposing ceremony, we admit ; but it evinced the desire to pay
attention to the party challenged, and the wish to exhibit a friendly
feeling. It was simply hospitable, and so it is “out of fashion 1"
When the pasty made its appearance upon table, there was a little
tart, of which Mrs. Lacquer did not know the contents—of course
not, how should she But we smiled involuntarily, as we called to
mind an anecdote, which we will recount for the edification of our
readers, as well as a warning.
A certain lady—one of the Lacquer class, who will not always bear
dropping down upon to dinner unexpectedly—was one day much
alarmed by the sudden arrival of some hungry visitors from the
country. Knowing that the carte du jour of her kitchen was not very
extensive, she despatched her servant to the nearest confectioner's
for some large tarts (which, by the way, the Lacquers call tourtes).
The articles in question appeared at dinner, and made a very passable
dish; and all would have gone off very well but for a sudden attempt
on the part of the mistress at conventional show-off. Wishing to
exhibit her ignorance of their contents, she pointed to them, and
turning round to the footman with an air of great dignity, exclaimed
“John—what are these tarts : " Whereat John, in the innocence of
his heart, looking at the tarts in a commercial, rather than a culinary
point of view, briskly replied, “Fourpence a piece, ma'am "

LAURIE'S CUTS ON WOOD.
It is understood that Sir Peter Laurie's objection to wood pavements
arises from his aversion to being seen walking on his head, in the public
thoroughfares. - -
After the opposition offered by Sir Peter Laurie to the election of a
certain alderman to the dignity of Lord Mayor, it is rather strange that
the cynic Solon should have such an antipathy to seeing Wood put down
and trampled on.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE “POPE'S MEDAL.”
WE make this confession to a temperate public—we have recently
enjoyed a laugh at his Holiness the Pope. However, let us not be
misunderstood. With all proper Lutheranity in our veins, we have
nevertheless too much respect for an old gentleman in the abstract,
to laugh violently, rudely in his face, because it may be surmounted
by a tiara. No ; our merriment was seemly, decent, just arising to
a philosophic snigger. We laughed—(we say it with a very proper
feeling of modesty)—we laughed as Socrates would have laughed ;
gently, benignly—yea, contemplatively. “Ask, ye Boeotian shades,
the reason why?” We will discover it.
A day or two since there was a lymphatic meeting at Exeter Hall.
A new body of water-drinkers—may we say “body ?”—flowed down
the Strand, and being upon what is called “high service,” mounted
the first story of the edifice, dedicated to, and made notorious by all
the congregating virtues. Here the hose of eloquence was speedily
laid on, and speeches were rapidly and copiously played upon burn-
ing alcohol by the many moral engines, brought with a rattling noise
together.
It was a meeting of Kelpies and Naiads—a sort of Water Parlia-
ment, returned by the various constituencies that, under a thousand
denominations, haunt the rivers, streams, rills and fountains of Vic-
toria's United Kingdom. Nay, the more domestic household water-
butt had its fitting representative ; even the drops of fluid which, by
Polytechnic art, discover animalculae combating with all the fierce-
mess and vastitude of mortal rhinoceros and elephant—even they
found their “sweet voices” in the words of one Mr. Macdonald,
who—like a real temperance-man—having found truth in a well,
benevolently dashed a bucketful of the fertilizing fluid in the faces
of his congregation.
Mr. Macdonald expressed his belief that the debates of Members
of Parliament would have more of reason and less of rhetoric “if
wine were banished from the neighbourhood of the House !” We
now see (taught by the wisdom of Mr. Macdonald) the origin of the
Poor Law. Like the fiend, Asmodeus, it came out of a bottle. Nay,
it is a wild-boar, that having gorged itself in a vineyard, in its very
drunkenness, now desolates the homesteads of poverty. How can it
be otherwise Here are men warm, simmering from Bellamy's—
men, with burgundy burning scarlet in their faces—the very “night-
lamps” of legislation—here are they called upon to sympathize with
the water-drinking poor Here is Chateau-Morgaux petitioned to
feel for Way-side Stream—Lafitte entreated to give ear to Parish
Pump—Lachrymae Christi supplicated to by Stagnant Ditch And
Wine, in its mounting, gorgeous arrogance, turns from the peti-
tioners, and cries “Aye” to the Poor Law.
Mr. Macdonald—without thinking of the depth he had fallen into
—so far bubbled up a truth. He is doubtless, however, not aware
that we owe as much of our national debt, as of our glory, to the
vintner; for Macnish, in his Anatomy of Drunkenness, says—“Mr. Pitt
would retire in the midst of a warm debate, and enliven his faculties
with a couple of bottles of port. Pitt's constitution enabled him to
do this with impunity. He was afflicted with what he called a cold-
mess of stomach.” That this disease has spread in the House of Com-
mons is but too evident in the existence of the present Poor Laws.
In our opinion, however, Pitt's malady was lessened and his policy
strengthened by the port ; and we leave it to be discussed by Mr.
Macdonald, and other pump-handle philosophers, whether, had the
Minister drunk water instead of grape-juice, a brother of Bonaparte
would not at this moment have lodged in Buckingham Palace, and
wooden shoes been worn in Saint James's
But all this time we have forgotten his Holiness the Pope
The meeting, or confluence of audible streams, in Exeter Hall, was
noisy in its very exultation. Some very charming Naiads, disguised
for the occasion in Quakeress costume, had their pretty faces dimpled
with smiles when they were assured that they had caught the Popo-
that they had his Holiness fast among them :
“The Water Nymphs that in the water played,
Held up their pearled wrists, and took him in 1 ''
From that moment, the Pope was a tee-totaller. In Harlequin
Mother Goose, Harlequin jumps into the water to find the golden egg—
his Holiness takes a dive, and rises dripping with a-Temperance
Medal
Yes, a Mr. Spencer assured the aqueous assembly that “it was
quite true that the Pope wore a tee-total medal, which had been sent to
him by Father Mathew, and that his Holiness approved of the principle,
THOUG H HE WAS NOT A TEE-TOTALLER HIMSELF.”
Is not this “virtue made easy” to the meanest capacity tº And yet
this virtue is met with songs and hosannahs by the sweet simplicity
of Exeter Hall ! We have not the slightest doubt that Jonathan
Wild “approved of the principle” of honesty in other people, albeit,
he did not refrain from picking their pockets himself. Thus, it seems,
Silenus might be an honorary member of a temperance society;
might wear a tee-total medal “nearest his heart;” might hiccup
forth his “approval of the principle,” though attendant Satyrs carried
the bloated drunkenness to his cavern every night.
How very suggestive is the Pope's temperance medal thus worn
How many a Member of Parliament, badged from his constituents,
“approves of the principle” of consistency, though Saint Margaret's
weathercock shall be no less wavering than he How many a
charity-monger “approves of the principle” of giving to the poor, yet
always passes the churchwardens' plate . Thus considered, the
Pope's medal is here, among us, plentiful as four-penny pieces.
What very respectable people—political and social—bear upon their
breasts the glittering lie, “approving” of the legend stamped upon it,
but by no means practically illustrating it themselves | What an
elegant hypocrisy—what an effulgent falsehood
And it is by such tricks, such paltry evasions, that Temperance
hopes to advance its righteous cause ! By such dissimulation—only
saved from being mischievous by its absurdity What a drunken
man may be a rigid tee-totaller—what hopeless intemperance may
beset the bigotted water-drinker Is there no such thing as delirium
tremens of the mind The liver may be burnt to a cinder by gin—
but, preaching in its mute terrors from the bottle of the surgeon, is it
less disgusting than the withered, shrivelled spirit of intolerance
preached upon and discoursing from the pia mater of a thorough
Exeter Hall tee-totaller
There is an Italian proverb that says—every medal has its reverse.
The Pope's medal must be an exception to the rule: for worn as an
“approval of principle,” with a negative of practice, it is complete in
its falsehood. Yea, the Pope's medal has a lie on both sides.

No flower is half so bright

They tell me I am cheap,

But the land that's flat and low
Suits best the silly gilly.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.
At an early hour on the 1st of February, the Lord Chancellor took
the Great Seal out of the inkstand—(of pantomimic dimensions)—
in which it is usually kept, and the Mace, which had been given out
over-night to the butler to be rubbed up with whitening and leather,
was put at his Lordship's door—with his boots—(into one of which
it was carefully thrust)—and the shaving water. The Archbishop of
Canterbury's lawn sleeves had been clearstarched, ironed out, and
neatly got up by one of the prelate's female domestics; and the State
mitre having been taken out of the silver paper which usually en-
velopes it, was dusted with a tender hand under the immediate
inspection of one of the family. Black Rod personally got up at six,
in order to fill in with ink the places where the black had become
rather rubbed by wear from the wand of office, and that active func-
tionary was employed for a quarter of an hour in polishing with the
inside of an old kid-glove the bit of metal at the top of the rod
alluded to.
These state preparations having been made on all hands, the digni-
taries forming the Commission for opening Parliament drove in their
own carriages to the House, while Black Rod left his lodgings in the
suburbs, with his wand of office under his mackintosh, and having
popped into a cab, when he got into the more public thoroughfares,
he drove up in becoming style to the door of the Commons. Having
bargained about and paid the fare at the stand where the cab was
taken, he was enabled to walk smack into the House, without stop-
ping to squabble and settle with the driver—a proceeding which
would have materially interfered with that dignity which it is the
aim of Black Rod on all occasions to be careful of. The preparations
within the Houses of Parliament had been on the most extensive
scale. Soap, both yellow and mottled, had been given out with a
profusion that might be fairly called reckless, and several yards of
house flannel had been for the last week placed in the hands of an
efficient corps of cleaners and charwomen. The final dusting and
the last round of the Turk's-head broom into the corners of the
ceiling had scarcely been accomplished when the carriages of
the members began to set down, and the Lords Commissioners
having soon afterwards arrived, all was excitement to hear the
Speech of Her Majesty. The Chancellor in the ante-room gave
a final shake to take out the creases in his robes, the Archbishop
of Canterbury pulled out his lawn sleeves, from which the damp
had unfortunately taken out the starch; and having inflated his
mitre, by blowing into it, to make it stick well up, the whole
party entered the House of Lords; and the Chancellor having taken
his seat on the wool mattrass, the other Commissioners fell into the
rear, at the foot of the throne. We had forgotten to state that the
Duke of Buccleugh, as privy seal, wore only an ordinary brecquet, which
looked less like privy seal than privy watch-key.
During the interval which occurred while Rod was gone to whip up
the Commons, the Chancellor wiped his glasses, cleared his throat,
and pulled his wig a little to the back of his head; for, somehow or
other, it had worked its way rather too far down on his forehead.
The Commons having rushed in pel-mel, with a clattering of feet,
amongst which we could distinctly trace the heavy tread of Mr.
Hume's highlows, the Lord Chancellor read nearly as follows. We
prefer throwing the Speech into verse, being determined to give it
the benefit of a little rhyme, to make up in some degree for the usual
absence of reason that generally distinguishes similar documents.
“‘Here we are,' Lords and Gents, as the clowns always say,
In the Pantomimes which I have seen at the play.
Her Majesty says, that though England ne'er minces
She likes to remain on good terms with all Princes,
And therefore appreciates quite at its proper rate,
Their assurance of wishing with her to co-operate,
She's glad to announce, too, that after much bother,
Of one saying one thing, and one quite another,
Although England's envoy behaved like a very cur,
We've settled in some way our tiff with America:
In addition to this, no plan could be finer
Than the terms we have made with celestial China.
We've gained a possession, they call it Hong Hong,
Which is three acres broad, and a mile or so long.
The standard of Britain, however, is planted there,
For civilization was very much wanted there,
And to you it is utterly needless to say
For civilization the natives must pay;
And therefore, we charge twenty millions of dollars
For the very first lesson we give to our scholars.
--- -
The people of England will learn with delight
We've made all our matters with Syria right:
And the fact will of course be a great consolation
To the suffering millions all over the nation.
The governments, Turkish and Persian, have long
Been declaring each other excessively wrong,
But England and Russia have both interfered
In a way by which every dispute has been cleared ;
A piece of intelligence which, you must own,
Will cause satisfaction wherever 'tis known.
Affghanistan, you know, has but recently been
Of valour exclusively British the scene:
But for further description of things of this natur,
See the dramas they do at the Surrey Theatur,
Where the famed T. P. Cooke, as a true British seaman,
Dances hornpipes while fighting a combat with three men.
Now Gents of the Commons—'tis time to implore you
To do the thing handsomely when we before you
Of expenses the usual estimates lay,
'Tis your glorious privilege always to pay.
My lords and good gentlemen 'tis a sad bore
To admit that the revenue's worse than before,
And it certainly needs no particular gumption
To find out the cause in diminished consumption ;
But still it's consoling to think that e'en yet,
Of the tax upon Incomes we've plenty to get;
So when on the public we’ve had a good pull,
Our purse will we hope be sufficiently full.
Her Majesty wishes her thanks to pour forth,
For the splended reception she got in the North;
The provost she thinks it may safely be said,
Of a city of cakes is the properest head.
Her Majesty also regrets that last year,
Disturbances did in some districts appear;
The law was however at once put in force,
Hungry folks ought to keep very quiet of course.
We are by Her Majesty ordered to say,
We purpose amendment in something—some day;
Begin your debates then, and may you succeed,
In doing for England, what England may need;
Whatever you do for the people, oh let it
Prove good”—aud, Punch wishes the people may get it !
THE CITY ARTICLE.
In consequence of the late rain, umbrellas rose, and pattens were in
demand. Consols were done at 90 ; and so was our reporter, at the White
Horse Cellar, by a Jew who sold pencils. We don't know much about
India stocks, but we have been induced to invest a little capital in India
handkerchiefs. We lately had an interview with a broker about a week's
rent in arrear, and found him a regular “Bear.” Tartans look lively,
and broad cloth is flat, so is small beer. Feathers are buoyant, and
tallow is low, especially at evening parties. We offered to make a pur-
chase of sugar, but, tinbeing scarce, our offer was declined. This change-
able weather, and the pressure of leather, affects our corn to some extent.
The only time-bargain we have lately made was with a cabman, and he
had the best of it.
MR. SPEC’S REMONSTRANCE.
From the Door Steps.
SIR,-Until my Cartoons are exhibited, I am in an exceedingly
uncomfortable state. I shall then have about fourteen hundred
pounds (the amount of the seven first prizes), and but a poor reward
for the pains and care which I have bestowed on my pieces.
Meanwhile, how am I to exist?—how, I say, is an historical painter
to live I despise humour and buffoonery, as unworthy the aim of a
great artist. But I am hungry, Sir, Hungay I Since Thursday,
the 13th instant, butcher’s-meat has not passed these lips, and then
'twas but the flap of a shoulder of mutton, which I ate cold—cold, and
without pickles, icy cold, for 'twas grudged by the niggard boor at
whose table I condescended to sit down.
That man was my own cousin—Samuel Spec, the eminent publisher
of Ivy Lane; and by him, and by all the world I have been treated
with unheard-of contumely. List but to a single instance of his
ingratitude 1 -
Í need not ask if you know my work, “Illustrations of Aldgate

thousands of copies were subscribed for by the British and Foreign
nobility.

placed it in the Pinakothek. The Grecian Otho (though I am bound in happier times, and in St. James's-park. The other is the bey—
to say he did not pay up) has hung it in the Parthenon—in the
Parthenon / It may be seen in the walls of the Vatican, in the worthy
company of Buonarotti and Urbino, and figures in the gilded saloons
of the Tuileries, the delight of Delaroche and Delacroix.
From all these Potentates, save the last, little has been received in
return for their presentation-copies, but unsubstantial praise. It is
true the King of Bavaria wrote a sonnet in acknowledgment of the
Illustrations; but I do not understand German, Sir, and am given to
understand by those who do, that the composition is but a poor one.
His Holiness the Pope gave his blessing, and admitted the publisher
to the honour of kissing his great toe. But I had rather have a beef-
steak to my lips any day of the week; and “Fine words,” as the poet
says, “butter no parsneps.” Parsneps l—I have not even parsneps to
butter.
His Majesty Louis-Philippe, however, formed a noble exception to
this rule of kingly indifference. Lord Cowley, our ambassador, pre-
sented my cousin Spec to him with a copy of my work. The Royal
Frenchman received Samuel Spec with open arms in the midst of his
Court, and next day, through our ambassador, offered the author of
the “Illustrations” the choice of the Grand Cross of the Legion of
Honour or a snuff-box set with diamonds. I need not say the latter
was preferred.
Nor did the monarch's gracious bounty end here. Going to his
writing-table, he handed over to the officier d'ordonnance who was
to take the snuff-box, a purely artistic memento of his royal good
will. “Go, Count,” said he, “to Mr. Spec, in my name, offer him
the snuff-box—'tis of trifling value; and at the same time beg him
to accept, as a testimony of the respect of one artist for another, my
own identical piece of INDIA-Rubber.”
When Sam came back, I hastened to his house in Ivy-lane. I
found him, Sir, as I have said—I found him eating cold mutton ;
and so I requested him (for my necessities were pressing) to hand
me over the diamond-box, and returning to my humble home
greedily opened the packet he had given me.
Sir, he º: the box and gave me the India-rubber! 'Tis no false-
hood—I have left it at your office, where all the world may see it.
I have left it at your office, and with it this letter. I hear the sound
of revelry from within—the clink of wine-cups, the merry song and
chorus. I am waiting outside, and a guinea would be the saving of me.
What shall I do? My genius is tragic-classic-historic—little suited
to the pages of what I must call a frivolous and ridiculous publica-
tion ; but my proud spirit must bend. Did not the Majesty of
FRANCE give lessons on Richmond-hill

PUNCH*S POLITICAL ECONOMY.
Monrey.
MoNEY is a part of capital. but only a small part, though Sir E. L.
Bulwer's Money was said to be capital by some, while others considered it
little better than waste paper. If you get change for a sovereign, you
may probably have a bad shilling among the lot ; and, as it is admitted
that what is true of a part must be true of the whole, the whole of the
change will be bad—a position which the political economists have got
themselves into, and which we leave them to get out of.
OF FIXED AND CIRCULATING CAPITAL.
On this head we have little to say. There is an example of fixed capital
in the capital fixed at the top of the Duke of York's column, which, by
the bye, is the only capital that the Duke ever was able to keep for any
time about him. Of circulating capital we can giveno better idea than Punch
which everybody allows to be capital, and which circulated amazingly.
OF INDUSTRY.
Industry is human exertion of any kind employed for the creation of
value; but when Sir Peter Laurie exerts himself to the utmost nothing
valuable results from it.
Some sort of industry is used to make property, while other sorts of
industry have the effect of destroying property. Of the latter kind is the
industry of lawyers, which is employed in the destruction of property to a
very large extent.
Tools and machines are instruments for the production of value; and
political tools are of various kinds, being invested with a greater or less
*º of sharpness.
ind is a stationery agent, and in turning a mill it is of great value.
Wind is also an agent for the umbrella and hat makers, giving an impetus
to trade by the destruction of value—blowing umbrellas to tatters, and
.# hats off the heads sometimes into the river. The value which
political economists attribute to wind may perhaps account for the zeal
they sometimes display in attempting to raise it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CANDID CONFESSION.
OUR clever neighbours, the French, have discovered, in spite of our-
dissimulation and hypocrisy, that the late insurrection at Barcelona,
and consequent atrocities, are all chargeable upon us. By us, we
mean us English, not us “Punch.”
Now we, taking quite a cosmopolite view of things, and soaring
above the prejudices of patriotism, are quite free to confess that we
believe this discovery of theirs to be by no manner of means a
mare's nest, and that England has really and truly, for reasons best
known to herself, been guilty of fermenting the disturbance in ques-
tion ;-in concert, we strongly suspect, with the unprincipled Man in
the Moon.
But this is not all. What we are about to say, we fear, will
materially injure our circulation; but our grand object is Truth;
threepences are a minor consideration: besides, we feel it our duty to
warn, even at the risk of offending, our countrymen. We have,
therefore, no hesitation in declaring that, between ourselves and the
French, we doubt not that every calamity which has befallen the
world since its creation has been occasioned, either directly or indi-
rectly, by the agency of John Bull—next to that of the devil.
English rapine, violence, and impiety, occasioned the Universal
Deluge; at least, they would have done so had England in those days
been a nation.
The erection of the Tower of Babel (previously to which French
was the universal language) was unquestionably a building specula-
tion, set on foot by English avarice.
The Punic War, which led to the destruction of Carthage, was
brought about by the instrumentality of England, jealous of the rising
power in Africa; as she still is : witness her paltry envy of the late
successes of France in that quarter.
It is well known that the burning of Rome in the reign of Nero
was attributed to the early Christians. There is now no doubt that
the fire was kindled by the emissaries of Britain, and it is equally
certain that afterwards the Goths and Vandals were hounded upon
the Eternal City by the machinations of the London Cabinet. Alaric
himself was an English adventurer—or at least a Scotchman—which
comes to the same thing.
The Danes, who so extensively ravaged and depopulated Europe,
mostly became Englishmen.
In the year 1580, an eminent English rogue, Sir Francis Drake,
first achieved what had always before been, and has been ever since, the
object of his knavish countrymen—he circumvented the world. The
same Drake and certain confederates, inclusive of a storm, destroyed
the Spanish Armada, which with the most benevolent intentions was
coming to visit our shores.
The discovery of the circulation of the blood by Harvey, on which
we are wont to pique ourselves, redounds, in fact, but little to our
credit; for, in the first place, it was previously known to Servetus,
who, there are divers reasons for believing, was a Frenchman; and,
in the second, the English physician, in order to test its truth,
dissected several French captives alive.
The earthquake which in 1755 destroyed the city of Lisbon, can-
not, it is true, be directly connected with English malevolence; but
our Government was more than suspected of conniving at it.
The horrors of the French Revolution, which are unjustly ascribed
to the mild and gentle populace of Paris, were really perpetrated, for
the most part, by a mob of English in disguise, whose crimes had ob-
liged them to leave their own country in order to escape from
justice.
Indeed England has always evinced a peculiar hostility to France,
a country whose inhabitants are, and always have been, the most quiet
inoffensive people on the face of the earth. We must say that we
behaved most rudely to our Gallic neighbours at Crecy, Poictiers,
and Agincourt; also at Blenheim, Ramilies, and Dettingen. But our
incivility during the late war transcended all our previous enormities.
In the first place, the war itself was dictated by that overbearing,
tyrannical spirit which has ever pervaded English councils. A noble
generous love of glory bade France go forth and conquer, diffusing
far and wide over the grateful nations the blessings of her bayonets,
bullets, institutions, and supremacy. Of these we, nevertheless, de-
prived mankind. “En avant 1” cried her national voice—
* En avant, dansons,
Contre leurs canons;
Dansons à la gloire 1”-
and we, with brute force and arms, broke through this pretty
quadrille, upon the frivolous pretence that it was danced in blood
on the trampled form of Liberty.
Within the last few weeks we have offered an insult, which must
have been dictated by the most studied malice, to the nation of France.
We had engaged in a doubtful and hazardous war with the Afghans
and Chinese; and the difficulties into which we had plunged ourselves
appeared interminable. Everybody, of course, naturally concluded
that we were on the high road to ruin; when, lo! on a sudden, we
inflict on both of our foes a most signal drubbing, as if on very
purpose to disappoint the expectations of France and Frenchmen.
This was too bad of us.
The French journalists, stung by our daily repeated provocations,
declaim, with natural indignation, against us and our deeds. We,
with the intolerable pride of an aristocrat, who, lolling back in his
carriage, receives, with supercilious equanimity, the abuse of an
exasperated cabman, listen to their bitterest invectives in scornful
silence. Do we flatter ourselves that they will stand this much
longer? Not they ; before long they will do something terrible,
depend upon that.
We did hope that the “TIMEs,” which certainly next to “Punch.”
is the first paper in the world, would have undertaken to make the
amende honorable to France for our national misbehaviour towards her
and society at large. That journal, however, having neglected the
performance of this duty, we felt ourselves bound to discharge it;
and have accordingly made the foregoing unaffected “confession,”
in the hope that it may disarm the resentment which the offences
of our country have provoked. We hope that our acknowledgment
of our demerits and misdeeds will be taken by those to whom it
is addressed in good part, and that no imprudent periodical will
nullify this apologetical article, and throw all Paris into a frenzy, by
an injudicious sneer, or an ill-judged sarcasm, against that high-
minded nation which we have therein endeavoured to conciliate.
NOTICES OF MOTIONS.
Rising to PROPOSE A MOTIONs
Colonel. Sierhorpe has given notice of a motion for a return of all the
different kinds of scales that were ever made in England, with the view of
seeing whether anything better than a sliding-scale can be found for the
purpose of applying it to corn.
Mr. Hume has moved for a return of the identical slate on which the
Chancellor of the Exchequer drew up the first figures from which he worked
out the last year's estimates.
Lord Normanby moved for a return of all the unsold copies of his novel
of Matilda, with a view to a motion on the subject of (waste) paper
currency; showing also the evils of a non-circulating medium.
Mr. T. Duncombe has given notice of his intention to move heaven and
earth to upset the present ministry.
Mr. P. Borthwick intends moving for a copy of all writs now in the hands
of the officers of the sheriffs, and will perhaps make it the subject of a
question of privilege.
Mr. P. Borthwick will also move, without notice, from his last place of
abode, just before the rising of Parliament.

AMong the numerous productions of London may be reckoned a species
of vegetable, called Buns; they partake also of a mineral nature, as frag-
ments of stone, called “grit,” are frequently found in them.
Naturalists having occasionally (very rarely) observed a sort of ossifica-
tion resemblinga currant upon the surface of the bun, were led to undertake
a mining speculation, for the discovery of any of these curiosities which
might by chance be concealed in the bowels; but after a deal of trouble
and great outlay of capital, the specimens were found so rare and so
inferior in quality, that they did not reward the trouble of searching for
them, and the enterprise was relinquished.
In the centre of these buns is described a circle, and the outer surface
is divided into a number of mathematical sections, forming together a
mathematical problem, which it would puzzle Euclid to solve.
Buns are commonly divided into three classes, viz. Bath or twopenny,
penny, and halfpenny stale, which are principally used by the children of
the poorer population of the City, or by oppressed and poorly-paid
mechanics, who procure them while on their way to their morning labour.
It has been asserted that they derive some sustenance from them, but
this is much doubted by geologists, and it is generally believed that they
are only of service in sharpening their teeth for the almost equally dry
morsel of bread which constitutes their breakfast, owing to the grinding
parsimony of their employers.
To these three classes may be added a kind known by the name of
“Chelsea,” this species having, it is said, been first discovered in that
locality. These are in the form of a “many-folded” serpent, with its tail
in its mouth, and are sometimes used as the emblem of eternity, which
simile is not inapt, as it takes a prodigious time to get through them.
A PROPOSITION FOR INCREASING THE REVENUE.
DEAR PUNCH,-I am that ingenious financier alluded to by Sir Robert
Peel in the last session of Parliament, who had proposed to him a plan
for increasing the national revenue by a tax upon umbrellas and piano-
fortes. The income tax, however, was preferred to mine, and in conse-
quence the country has been reduced to a state of utter ruin.
I still wish to serve my native land, and with that view I have been
searching into the financial system of ancient days. In the early records
of the Exchequer, I find that one Ralph Fitzroger was amerced for
“saying a thing which he afterwards contradicted ; ” Stephen de Mire-
flet, for “a silly nswer; ” Henry, the Dean, and many others, for “a
silly speech; ” Gilbert de Henley, for “telling a lie.”
What think you, Mr. Punch, of a revival of these amerciaments, which
will enable us to attain the double object of replenishing the Exchequer
and enforcing morality –Let us commence with the members of the
House of Commons in the present session. How few of the honourable
gentlemen could open their mouths without contributing something to the
national resources ! If Peel, Stanley, and Graham were to be fined for
every contradiction they are now giving to all their former assertions,
what a glorious fund would be collected from these three members only
Then do see, Mr. Punch, what a golden harvest might be reaped from
the silly answers and silly speeches delivered in the House. Again, Mr. ,
Punch, as to the “lie "—“One who had been a courtier,” tells us that a
“lie" has seven distinct parts, viz, 1st, The retort courteous; 2nd, The
quip modest; 3rd, The reply churlish ; 4th, The reproof valiant; 5th,
The countercheck quarrelsome ; 6th, The lie circumstantial; and 7th,
The lie direct. A very slight review of the proceedings in Parliament,
and of the conduct of members there, would be sufficient to snow what an
enormous revenue might be derived from these sources.
I am, Mr. Punch, your humble servant.

BUT little business has been doing since our last, and terms may be
considered a trifle easier; for really good and useful descriptions there
has been some demand ; which demand, though far from great, has
exceeded the supply, so that these cannot be quoted at lower prices.
Ready-furnished houses, with or without small annuities, have been
freely offered, and in some instances accepted; but cash terms seem
generally preferred, as it prevents many mistakes and much disappoint-
ment. Papas, bachelor uncles, and maiden aunts, not always cutting
up as expected.
In ordinary descriptions there is nothing doing, and prices nominal.
All are eagerly looking forward to the results of the Christmas flirtations,
when, unless things assume a livelier appearance, thousands of our fellow-

In the Foreign Market, although things are drill at present, owing to
the Colonial Market being overdone and the Australian in bad repute, yet
it is confidently expected that a reaction will shortly take place, in conse-
quence of our late successes in the East. Chinamen (to whom Providence
allows two, a privilege of which they seldom avail themselves) will no
doubt gladly avail themselves of our superfluity; whilst Afghanistan
offers an unlimited market, numbers being no object—provided the ladies

“back somersaults from feet to feet.” Mlle. Camille Leroux appears as
“The Star or Floating Scarf;” and Mr L. J. North, “ the Star Rider
of America, appears in his Flight of Fancy,” which “ Flinht of Fancy”
consists of the bodily act of balancing himself on his nose, whilst his horse

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 73
THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
chapTER VI.-PATTY BUTLER IN THE WATCH-HOUSE-THE CHARGE
– HER RELEASE.
“WHAT's the charge t” asked Mr. Naplightly, night-constable of
the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields.
“Picking pockets,” replied one of the watchmen, trippingly.
“Ha! I see—yes, an old friend, eh, watchman " said Naplightly,
looking with brazen significance at the little feather-dresser, pale,
trembling, and dumbfounded by the suddenness of the event that had
placed her in the foul, dim dungeon, where justice, for a time laying
aside a half-smoked tobacco-pipe, was to decide upon the accusation.
“You know this young lady, of course 1" asked the constable.
“Bless your heart, sir, know her I Do I know my own rattle
The most troublesome and abusingest girl on my beat,” answered the
watchman.
“That’s plain enough—plain with half an eye. Now, sir, if you
please”—and the night-constable looked towards the tall man, the
assailant of Patty. “Now, sir, everything according to business.
What’s your name t”
“Julius Curlwell,” answered the ruffian, looking loftily around him,
as though very proud of his name, and pulling up his manifold white
neckcloth, as if still prouder of the cambric.
“And where do you live, and what are you?” asked the functionary.
“I at present reside,” answered Mr. Curlwell, with monosyllabic
majesty, “with my friend, my lord Huntingtopper.”
The face of the night-constable—before, arched with dignity—
relaxed into a courteous smirk, and he felt his voice grow mellow in
his throat: the watchmen too drew themselves up, glancing respectfully
at Lord Huntingtopper's friend, who, doubtless unconscious of the
impression he had made, jerked with languid, lackadaisical air his
heavy gold chain and seals between his right thumb and finger.
“And you charge this young girl, Mr. Curlwell, with picking your
pocket —you"
Here the constable was interrupted, as he called it, by Patty; for
she fell in a heap upon the watch-house floor, as though stabbed to
the heart. In an instant, Knuckle raised her in his arms, and
removing her bonnet, the yellow light of a flaring lamp fell upon her
death-pale, innocent face; and a tear rolled down her white cheek
on the rough hand of Luke, who, as though molten lead had dropt
upon his flesh, started round, and with a look of pain and passion
glared now at the constable, and now at Mr. Julius Curlwell. “You
stony-hearted vipers,” cried Luke at last,-" will you let the poor
girl die—will none of you get some water "
“Yes, it's all right,” muttered one watchman, leering and laughing,
“when the evidence is strong, they always tries a faint.”
Worn out, exhausted by the anguish of the previous days, oppressed
with that feeling of desolation which makes the world far worse than
valueless, terrified, astounded by her situation—Patty had remained
in a half-stupor—her mind and senses numbed by the apathy of
misery. The words of the constable for a moment called her back to
consciousness, and then she sank beneath the torture.
“There—she'll do, with a little water,” jested one of the watchmen,
as Luke sprinkled Patty's face—“and if she won't I’m sorry for her;
seeing as the parish finds no hartshorn. I told you she'd do,” re-
peated the fellow, as Patty unclosed her eyes, and breathing heavily,
looked mournfully about her.
“Oh, Luke " she exclaimed at length, bursting into tears, as the
implied accusation of the constable flashed upon her. “Oh, Luke "
“Silence "cried the night-officer, knitting his brows; and then turn-
ing to the injured man–I,ord Huntingtopper's friend—he broke into
a grim smile, saying, “Now, sir, if you please ? Come to the robbery.”
Again Patty moaned, and again the night-constable roared “Silence "
“I–I—I can't precisely make a-a what you call—a criminal
charge against that young woman in particular—no, understand me,
not in particular—certainly not—nevertheless, I have been robbed—
a very handsome family snuff-box—robbed and knocked down—or
knocked down and robbed; for understand me, I wish to be exact; a
very handsome, gold-mounted, tortoise-shell box—couldn't go without
fingers—with family crest—dolphin with tail in his mouth, Latin
under it, and everything proper.” Such was what Mr. Julius Curl-
well evidently considered to be his charge.
The night-constable indulged in a heavy shake of the head, and
glancing at Patty, observed, “If things of this sort isn’t put down by
the strong hand, there's an end of respectability. I think there's
evidence enough to lock the girl up till the morning.”
* Oh, for the love of mercy " shrieked Patty; and then, con-
vulsed and heart-stricken, she could speak no more ; but held forth
her clasped hands to the night-constable.
“Stop—stop !” cried the officer, as Luke was about to speak ; “let
us do everything in order; first search the girl ; the property may be
about her.” Patty looked entreatingly at the constable, who waved
his hand as though his public virtue were proof against looks. She
then turned with streaming eyes to Mr. Curlwell, who, with a slight
cough, and averting his face from the glance of the accused, somewhat
hurriedly drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and with consider-
able energy, blew his nose.
“But to begin with—Watchman, what's that " asked the con-
stable, pointing to the case,” where reposed myself and companions:
“what’s that?”
“My work, sir—it is, indeed; I was going to take it home,” said
Patty, “when that gentleman,”—her voice faltered—“when that
gentleman–Oh, God help me !”—she could say no more.
“Ha!” and the night-constable breathed hard, sucked his underlip,
and then said, speaking as an oracle—“The thing looks very black agin
her. Watchman,” and he raised his voice, “what's in that case ?”
Immediately the watchman drew me from my companions, and
with a look of admiration that ought to have pleased me, cried,
“Well! what a bit o' snow !”
“Young woman,” said the night-constable—he also smitten with my
beauty; “young woman, I do hope these things are honestly come
by ; I say, I do, as a father, hope it,” he repeated, with a manner
that proved he had no hope whatever on the subject.
“Honestly come by—to be sure they are—as I'd show you in five
minutes if I was only out of this dog-hole,” cried Luke.
“By the bye,” said the night-constable, at length really awakened
to the presence of Knuckle—“What is the charge against this man
What is your charge, sir?”
I cannot exactly say what it was that prompted the answer to Mr
Julius Curlwell, but that person having placed his hand in his coat
side-pocket, raised his eyelids with a slight motion of astonishment,
and replied in the softest voice—“Charge none, whatever.”
“I thought you were knocked down, sir, and ”—
“ Unquestionably; but I wish to be particular, and—no, I wouldn't
make a mistake for the world—and I–that is, against the man—I
have no charge whatever.”
“You may go,” said the night-constable, adding, with a leer, “and
you may thank this noble gentleman for his good-nature.”
Luke evidently deemed such politeness unnecessary, for taking no
notice of Curlwell, and saying in a hurried whisper to Patty, “Just you
wait a minute,” he impatiently made his way from the watch-house.
“Upon second thoughts,” said Mr. Curlwell, “I do think, Mr.
Night-Constable, you had better let the girl go too; she may amend
—she may reform—and for my part, I pardon her—I do, indeed ; so,
you'd better let her go.”
Mr. Naplightly, the constable, certainly felt desirous to entertain
the humane idea suggested by Mr. Julius Curlwell, but as that
philanthropist did not back his arguments by other reasons, very cur-
rent in the good old days or nights of the good old roundhouse,
Mr. Naplightly relapsed into official virtue, and said he should cer-
tainly lock the girl up till the morrow morning.
Here Patty entreated the constable to wait the return of Luke ;
he would be back immediately. Mr. Curlwell also joined in the
request, adding that as the night was very hot, and the watchhouse
not particularly well-ventilated, he would wait outside until he saw
better reason either to forego or press his charge. Here Mr. Curl-
well slipt a crown into the hand of a watchman, and the lock of the
door was turned, Mr. Curlwell sagaciously observing, as he stept into
the moonlight, that “there was nothing so sweet as fresh air.”
And yet there was another sweetness which Mr. Curlwell lost no
time ere he enjoyed; for he drew from his side-pocket, the tortoise-
shell gold-mounted snuff-box—the box, bearing the dolphin with its
tail in its mouth, the Latin under it, and everything proper—the box
which he had deemed lost in the mob that had gathered round him
on his prostration; but which happily he had found whilst in the
watch house, though being on certain occasions what is called a close
man, he did not then make known the discovery.
To return to Patty in the watch-house. She is not thrust into the den
in which half-a-dozen wretched creatures have been screaming and
shouting, but is permitted a seat among the watchmen, who, leaving his
Majesty's subjects to the influence of their own impulses, good or bad, sit
at the hearth and drink porter, the while they admire myself and fellows.
• The reader may ask, “How is it, good Master Feather, that whilst in darkness,
whilst shut up in a portfolio, you are enabled to speak, thus circumstantially to the
outward appearances of things about you?” And the Feather answers-“You shall
know this and more at the º,

hatband, and straddling about the floor; “here's a thing to go a

.The shout excited by this magic touch of humour was checked by
violent knocking at the watch-house door. It was no sooner opened,
than Luke Knuckle, Mr. Flamingo the feather-merchant, and—though
not too willingly—Mr. Curlwell entered.
Mr. Flamingo, seeing me, turned pale at the desecration, and trem-
blingly asked the watchman how he dared to pollute his property
... The night-constable was now satisfied—Patty's story was true, and
if she would only ask Mr. Curlwell's pardon for having accosted him
in the street, she might go about her business.
“Never !” exclaimed Patty, her face reddening to scarlet.
It so happened that Curlwell—the faithful valet of Lord Hunt-
ingtopper—had no intention to appear again in the watch-house, but
had unhappily met his acquaintance, the feather-merchant, on his
way thither, accompanied by Knuckle, who had compelled him to
return. Being brought back, he felt he was obliged to appear the
injured person.
“Bless my soul 1" said Flamingo, in a half-whisper to the valet–
“ and that creature addressed you in the street ! How Mrs.
Flamingo's deceived in her I This is the last bit of work she does
for us.” Then turning to the night-constable, he exclaimed,—“If she
won't ask the gentleman's pardon, lock her up.”
Patty thought of her home—poor, stricken creature, what a home !
—of the last night she was to pass beneath a roof with her dead
mother; and with this thought in her face, her eyes, her voice,
she approached Curlwell, and in a tone that must have made him
soul-sick, said –
“I ask your pardon, sir.”
“The charge is dismissed,” cries Naplightly, the night-constable.

A COMFORTABLE COUNTRY.
The American people have, it seems, a lofty notion of the fine social
uses of homicide. They evidently think, with sugar bakers, that there is
nothing like blood for the refinement. The last batch of transatlantic
journals brings new evidence of this. One General, M. Dougald, by means
of an anonymous letter, is positively assured that another General, Hepburn,
intends to shoot him. General Hepburn calls on General M’Dougald, and
putting his hand into his pocket, is about to draw forth a letter, when
General M’Dougald shoots him to the heart. The social commentary is
to come. A Coroner's inquest return a verdict of—Justifiable Homicide 1
With these things going on — these shootings and slashings—had not
the Americans better change their flag. Suppose for the thirteen stripes,
they take thirteen Bowie knives—and for the like number of stars as many
bullets. For a variety, too, they might sport a flag in the shape of a
— “protested" bill.
THE WIDDECOMB PAPERS.
The name of Widdecomb is certainly one of the most venerable in
Theatrical annals, and since there seems to be a rage for the Memoirs of
eminent men connected with the drama, we think we cannot do better
than select the individual whose name stands at the head of this article.
It is a constitutional fiction that the “King never dies,” but this beauti-
ful theory has been realised in the person of Widdecomb. We have often
heard allusions made to the memory of the oldest inhabitant; but though
that individual may possibly be enabled to carry his recollections a tolera-
bly long way back into the vista of years, we defy him to remember the
advertisement announcing the birth of Widdecomb. So remote must be
the period, that if we were to find an antediluvian journal containing
among its births the announcement, “On Tuesday last Chaos of Sun and
Air,” we should look on it as an old black-letter method of spelling Son
and Heir—the son and heir in question being no other than Widdecomb.
If Chaos should ever come again (as Shakspeare, through the mouth of
Othello hints that it may,) we are certain that Chaos would rocognise an
old friend in Widdecomb. The name of Widdecomb is evidently Saxon,
and is a corruption of Why do you come 3 which was a question the
Saxons very naturally put to the Normans, when the latter arrived with
the Conqueror. There is no doubt that William with his army in the
rear, sent the enemy before him in his van—and if the van required a
driver, it is possible that Widdecomb may have sent in his adherence to
the new dynasty. The antiquity which is usually attributed to the Hills,
is of recent date, compared to the venerable halo which is thrown over
the origin of the hero of these papers It is known that the common law of
England is based on customs “ whereof the memory of man runneth not to
the contrary;” but it is generally understood that the “man” here alluded
to is Widdecomb, and that any custom is good in law, “whereof the
memory of Widdecomb runneth not to the contrary.” We are sure that
Widdecomb will excuse us for grubbing into the mud of the dark ages to
find the stock of his family tree; since it is the fashion with great folks to
go so far back in tracing their ancestors, that the scion of a noble house is
often found forgetting himself in the great exertion his memory undergoes
in recollecting those he is descended from.
The Widdecomb papers, which we have the pleasure of laying before our
readers, were picked up at the flood which last year inundated the cellars
along Milbank, and formed a natural bay, for twenty-four hours, at the
corner of Pratt-street. The precious treasure is supposed to have been
cast away off Astley's Amphitheatre; and having been carried by a
southern breeze towards the venerable Abbey, it is presumed that they
found their way to the banks of the river, when, entering the common
sewer at 95 degrees of longitude from the Observatory at Elliott's
Brewery, they were swept in an overland direction towards the Peni-
tentiary, where the present editor had the honour of raking them out of a
ditch with the crooked end of his fourpenny walking-stick. The literary
prize was unfolded leaf by leaf, with all the tenderness displayed in un-
rolling a mummy; but there are still some very obscure passages in the
manuscript. We shall, however, on a future occasion lay before our
readers a few of the most intelligible extracts.

THE WRONGS OF PUNCH.
HIS Expulsion FROM FRANCE-LETTER THEREON TO KING
LOUIS-Philippe.
PAcKET Boat INN, Doven, Feb. 11.
CIT1z EN KING, For once, indignation has been too much for
sea-sickness. I have this moment, in a half-tempest, arrived from
Boulogne—thrust from the port by the point of the sword. Yes; it
is true—Punch is no longer to be admitted into France. Punch, who—
but I have swallowed another goutte of brandy, and will subdue my
feelings.
And is it thus, Louis, -is it thus you use an old friend You, whom
I have counted upon as almost my idolater; you, whose wariness—
whose ingenuity—whose fine sense of self-preservation made you
seem to the eyes of all men the first disciple of the school of Punch—
do you now use your old master as whilom Plato maltreated
Socrates ?
It is barely two days since, and with what a jocund heart did I
leave my wife (I am proud to say with a complimentary mist in her
eyes) at the wharf of London bridge . How did that heart sink as
the boat boiled past the Reculvers—how very ill, indeed, was I off the
North Foreland—how more than puppy-sick ere I reached the port
of Boulogne : “Never mind,” thought I, as I quitted the Magnet;
“here, at least, is Balm of Gilead at two francs a bottle !” and with
the thought the violet hue of my nose subsided, my blood quickened,
and I stept out airily towards the Custom-house.
“What is your name 1” says the clerk, with a suspicious look—a
look significantly answered by a corps of douaniers—“What is your
name f *
You know the graceful bend of my back—the smile that ordinarily
puckers up my mouth. With that bend and that smile then, I an-
swered—“Punch 1”
“C'est bien—it is henceforth not permitted that your blood shall
circulate in France. Otez ce coquin—take the vagabond away !” Thus
spoke the man in authority; and in a trice, I was escorted to the
Water Witch, then starting for Dover, and was in two hours and a
half seated in an English inn, where—
[I beg your pardon, but I am interrupted. A man (a Dover
waterman) has followed me to my hotel to beg—that is, enforce—
“sixpence” for the accommodation of a plank from the wharf to the
boat, the steam company, the mayor and magistrates of Dover smil-
ing blandly on the extortion.]
I sank back in my chair, and endeavoured to review my past
doings. How—how, thought I, can I have stirred the philosophic
bile of my good friend, Louis Philippe For what can he have
thus turned me out of Boulogne—wherefore stop my travels in
France 1
Whilst in this exceedingly brown study, a Frenchman entered the
room. He threw a piercing look at me, lifted his hat with a mixture
of scorn and forced politeness, and said—“Mille pardons—mais—n'est-
ce pas–Ponch 2"
“Then you know me, monsieur !” said I.
“Oui, monsieur—I have read your things in Boulogne—in Paris”—
and still the Frenchman scowled, then laughed, as I thought, vin-
dictively.
“Sir, I am happy at this meeting. You may, perhaps, resolve a
doubt that just now eats up my brain. In the first place, I have—
yes—Punch has been turned out of France.”
“C'est bien—c'est fort bien,” said the Frenchman, with open delight.
“Bless me !” I exclaimed—“Why, what have I done "
“What have you not done "roared the Frenchman.
With subdued voice, I begged of him to enumerate my written
offences. It seemed to him a labour of love, for he drew his chair
close to the table, squared his elbows upon it, and his eyes flash-
; and his moustache twisting and working like a young eel, thus
egan.
“In the first place, Did you not call Louis-PHILIPPE hard names
about the Spanish business? When Orca, Leon, and others were
tricked to be shot by CHR1st INA, did you not accuse Louis-PHILIPPE
of having his finger in the bloodshed 1"
* I did.”
“Secondly,–Did you not place the Great Napoleon on a monument
of froth, spouting from a bottle of imperial pop . "
“It can't be denied.”
“Thirdly,–Did you not sneer at our colonies 1 Did you not more
than doubt the justice of our cutting Arab throats, and extracting
true glory from bloodshed ; Did you not laugh at the Trappists,
and fling hard names upon General Bug EAUD !”
“All quite true.”
“Fourthly,–Did you not desecrate—yes, desecrate—the eloquence
of Mons. DuMAs, when he turned a funeral oration on poor OHLEANs
into a drama for the Porte St.-Martin "
“I confess it.”
“And do you not, almost every week, preach up what you in-
solently call the mischief of glory, and question the born right of
every Frenchman to carry fire and bloodshed into every country he
can get into—and more, do you not laugh at and denounce, what is as
dear to every Frenchman as the recollection of his mother's milk, a
hatred, an undying hatred, to England and all that's English t”
“I own to every word of it.”
“And more—do you not . . . . .”
“I beg your pardon, monsieur,” said a stage-coachman, at this point
entering the room, “if you are the gentleman as is going to Canter-
bury, time's up.”
The Frenchman did not finish his sentence, but rising, and again
lifting his hat, he with a grim smile and flashing eyes, stalked away.
And now, my quondam friend Louis-PHILIPPE, I have put the
above colloquy to paper, that I may herewith ask you, if your subject
and fellow-citizen is right as to the causes which (under your orders)
have shut me out of France 1 If they be not, you will drop me a
line. If they be, I will take your silence (and smuggle accordingly)
for affirmation. ours,

LAURELS AND LOLLIPOPS.
It is at least consolatory to the humane mind to know that Mars him-
self has his hours of sweetness: that though War and Homicide, when in
active service, are terrible miscreants, they are nevertheless—the mis-
chief they had to do being fully accomplished—mild and amiable, and
innocently sportive, as the Siamese twins engaged at battledore-and-
shuttlecock. ByRoN gives an appalling picture of War, but the Earl of
ELLENBoRough makes a field of glory sweet and luscious as a twelfth-cake :
let us first quote the poet, and then turn to the Governor-general :—
* Lo! where the giant on the mountain stands,
His blood-red tresses deep'ning in the sun,
With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
And eye that scorcheth all it glares upon :
Restless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon
Flashing afar, and at his iron feet
Destruction cowers to mark what deeds are done !”
Is not the giant War, as hinted above, a terrible Hurlo-Thrumbo ; All
praise, then, be to the Earl of ELLENBorough, who weans the monster
from his naughty deeds, and making him sit down on some green knoll,
to there serenely—sucks a sugar-stick | The Englishman (Indian journal)
affords us proof of this :—
“Letters from Ferozepore afford the gratifying intelligence that Lord Ellemborough
has ordered twenty-seven thousand seers of sweetmeats to be got ready for the Native
troops. The “sweetie' is to be distributed at the rate of a seer a man, upon the return
of the victorious army.”
Here War drops the “death-shot” from his “fiery hands,” and
delights in caraway.comfits; peppermint-drops sweetly repay the toil
and peril of ball-cartridge, and rockets are forgotten in the delicious
lusciousness of barley-sugar. Henceforth, the cry of the Native troops
will be—“ India—our homes—and hard-bake l’” We are, moreover,
happy to inform our readers, on the authority of our “own corre-
spondent,” that in addition to the sugary “seer,”, set apart for each
native warrior, every man who has greatly distinguished himself will be
rewarded, from the hands of the Governor-general himself, with a roll and
treacle.
Lord Ellenborough, by his “doux système,” realises the dream of
the Pays de Cocagne, where (according to De Beranger) all things are in
sugar :-
* Bon Dieul que j'aime
Ce aoua système !
Les canons méme
De sucre sont faits;
Belles sculptures,
Riches peintures
En confitures
Ornent les buffets!”
His Lordship makes blood a nice saccharine fluid, and candies the laurels
gathered from carnage. We are further informed, that the noble
Governor-general purposes to establish a military order º sugar) for our
Native troops, to be called—Knights Companions of the Lollipop ; the
Governor himself (and who so fit 1) being the head of the Chapter.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“THE GATEs of somNAUTH.”
R. GEORGE ROBINS feels that he has very often been
honoured, but has never, until the present occasion, been perfectly and
unreservedly sublimated. He, however, would be Monk on less than Man
could he feel otherwise on the present occasion, being entrusted by
THE MOST NOBLE THE EARL OF ELLENBOROUGH,
Gubernor-Gentral of Émbia,
to sell (there being found no other use for it) that startling trophy of the
Victories of
“ the BRothrks AND FRurnos"
of the aforesaid Earl –
TIIE GATES OF SOMNAUTH !
They are manufactured of the very finest SANDAL-WOOD; for Mr. Robins
feels that he should descend from the pinnacle upon which public approbation has
placed him, did he for a moment dwell upon the insidious slander, which, like a
caterpillar, would
FEED UPON The LAURELS OF THE INVINCIBLE SEPOYS 1
by averring that the said sandal-wood is no more than “worm-eaten deal.”
These unique and interesting Gates were placed by the original proprietors at
the Temple of Siva. However, one of those accidents for which
Time, the Great Leveller,
is so justly celebrated, about eight hundred years ago removed them from their
Pristine situation. But, to use the lava words and glow-worm thoughts of the
Governor-General–
"THE INSULT OF EIGHT HUNDRED YEARs Is Avenged 1"
The gates have been removed from their hinges, and carried back
ON THE WINGs or vrcTory
to their first abiding-place. . It has, however (malheureusement) been discovered
that the temple to which the gates formed so elegant an appendage, is a ruin–
that the Hindoo fane has been desecrated—and that the gates or Somnauth,
with their violatro BRAMAh Locks—have no house to shelter them.
Under these peculiar circumstances, the Governor-General has resolved to
bring the property to the hammer; the proceeds of the sale to be expended in
sweetmeats for the victorious native army of the Golden Ganges.
Here Mr. Robins feels it necessary to allude to the ancient history and pecu-
liar uses of the gates he shall have the honour to knock down, in order that
*--

The Nobility, Gentry, and Giant Capitalist,
may know the glory that awaits upon the purchase. These Gates, cight hundred
years ago, guarded the portals of
THE TEMPLE OF SIVA 5
a fabric in a measure similar to Her Majesty's Theatre, it being dedicated to
singing and dancing.
Two Thousand Hindoo Maidens,
as Mr. Robins is credibly informed by the Oriental historian, were wont to
worship the idol on the light fantastic toe ; maidens,
With gazelle eyes, and cheeks “crimson as "ſºft pomegranates,”
congregated every morn, ere the sun flung abroad his vicegerent rays, to perform
their peculiar devotions, evidently so dear to the Christian sympathies of the
present Governor-General. Thus
The Historic and Social Associations
of these Gates must endear them to any Nobleman who, like The
LATE LANMENTED MARQUIS OF HERTFORD,
or the present distinguished

has a taste for the cheerful and the beautiful i and thus they would form a most
appropriate pair of

days of utility, when the spirits of
£. s. d.,
like the Witches on the “Blasted Heath,” bind the souls of men to a sordid,
mercenary purpose—as it may be possible that the Aristocracy may fail to bid
for this most valuable relic of Brahma, Mr. Robins confidently appeals
To the Trading Enterests of Great Britain,
As, however, in these
and more especially to
THE TURNERS AND TOYMAKERS THEREOF,
feeling that
A Handsome Fortune may be realized
by manufacturing the Sandal-wood of Brahma into
PEG-TOPS, BOOTJACKS, WOODEN SPOONS, AND Tooth Picks.
Mr. Rosins feels that to do this would be to commit little less than desecra-
tion; nevertheless, as the Governor-General wishes to get the Gates off his
hands, at any price, the sale will unreservedly take place on the 1st of April
next. Lithographic Prints (price £10 each) of the Gates to be had at Mr
Robins's Office, Piazza, Covent Garden.

THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
chapTER Wii.-A DINNER PARTY AT THE LACQUERS".
As the Lacquers are fond of crowding as many expensive things
upon the table as possible, in the display of which they think society
consists; and as they look more for the dash of equipage than the
brilliancy of intellect in their acquaintances, we readily anticipated
what the after-dinner part of the entertainments would resemble.
Everything was in the extreme of dreary splendour. The orange
chips were from Gunter's—the preserves from Fortnum and Mason's,
whilst the dessert service was a blaze of enamelled gold, all which
being arranged in solemn state, Mrs. Lacquer thought that the great
end of giving a dinner party was obtained. There was that public
profusion which, amongst the Lacquer species, always accompanies
private economy—that ostentatious extravagance never inseparable
from domestic parsimony. We never see this show-off style of living,
but we imagine that the servants must fare indifferently. And indeed
it has been whispered to us that Mrs. Lacquer weighs out half a
pound of butter every week to each of the domestics for their seven
days' allowance; that the store-room is a perfect bastile of imprisoned
grocery; and that the Misses Lacquer, who, with all their wonderful
notions, take the housekeeping by turns, “give out” the small quan-
tities of pepper, nutmeg, and other humble condiments required for the
culinary purposes of the family. But this is all very proper, inasmuch
as it keeps up that proper line of distinction between superiors and
attendants—far more commendable than the habits of some grovel-
ling and mean-spirited people, who allow their servants actually to
feed upon the same joints as they themselves are in the habit of din-
ing from—and even without marking off the kitchen allowance.
The ladies did not stay long at table after the dessert had been
arranged. Few of them took any wine, and fewer still said a word
worth attending to —nearly the whole of their conversation being
confined to fiddle-faddle remarks of the most inane description.
Several times, indeed, there was a dead silence—one of those miser-
able pauses which are always prolonged by the wish to think of some
common-place observation that might break it, and which never
comes to your relief when it is most wanted. But, pause or not,
Mrs. Lacquer still sat in all the pride of pomp at the head of the
table, thinking that she had done quite enough towards honouring
her guests, by putting on her emerald velvet dress and point lace,
and covering the table with a costly dessert. At last, after a longer
pause than ordinary, she collected all the glances of the ladies' eyes
into one focus, which was herself; and then, by some peculiar free-
masonry, they all rose at once, and sailed out of the room—an active
young gentleman in a white cravat opening the door for them ; and
the two last young ladies who went out putting their arms round one
another's waists in an impulse of girlish affection, most refreshing
and delightful to behold—they could neither of them ever expect to
see thirty again.
Mr. Lacquer now moved to the head of the table, and directed his
guests to draw up nearer to him, which they did, apparently for the
purpose of hearing him relate the history of every separate bottle of
wine that came to table, each of which, by his account, was a kind
not to be met with every day, but especially procured for him by his
friend Logwood, at a great price, with the assurance that he was the
only man who could have obtained it. Then the young gentleman,
who opened the door, addressed a remark to us concerning some
fracas in the Jockey Club ; but finding we knew nothing about it,
passed us over with a glance of contempt, and directly turned his
attention to young Lacquer, who, mixing in better society than our-
selves, was quite up to all the chicanery of the turf. And next
young Lacquer told him, in confidence, of a sweet mare that he tried
the other day; and only differed with the owner about a five pound
note, or he should have purchased her.
some man who knew Count D'Orsay, and had got one of Cerito's
gloves, which she had given to him herself. Two or three other
guests were hard at work upon Sir Robert Peel and Lord Ellen-
borough : and one sharp-faced old gentleman was regarding every-
body as they spoke with an air of smiling acquiescence and intent
interest, that convinced us he was an humble acquaintance, asked at
three quarters past the eleventh hour, to fill up a vacancy and balance
the order of the table. And we were the more certain of this,
because at dinner, whenever he was asked which particular portion
of any dish he had a fancy to, he always replied, “Any part, any
part, thank you ; I have no preference—whichever you please.”
Whenever the conversation came to a stand-still, Mr. Lacquer leant
***hen they finally agreed accepting Mrs. Spangle Lacquer's polite invitation,” should that lady
to drive a break along the Edgeware Road the next day, along with
back in his chair, jingled his gold in his breeches pocket, danced his
heavy watch-seals in his hand, and asked if any of his friends knew
of an eligible investment for fourteen thousand pounds, which he had
to spare at present. And if no one responded to this inquiry, and the
silence continued, he told somebody to take a clean glass and try the
claret, which he could recommend as something rather out of the
common way; or asked if Burgundy would be preferable, because he
had some in his cellar, and would send for it if required.
And in this manner two or three tedious hours wore away, until we
were summoned, for the third time, to coffee; when we gladly walked
up stairs, even with the slight promise of entertainment which the
drawing-room afforded; contrasting, in our own mind, the dismal
sociality we had just witnessed, in spite of the pine-apple and
crystallized apricots, with the kind-heartedness and sparkling con-
versation which are never to be met with higher than a couple of
plain decanters with port and sherry, and some simple English
walnuts (or a few filberts—we especially cling to filberts), and some
crisp, toothsome biscuits. We are an author, and consequently—it
is almost superfluous to add—beyond the pale of the income-tax. We
do not sneer at wealth, or the institutions of society—very far from
it ; but should we ever have the fortune to become rich, we fear we
shall sadly commit ourselves in only asking those whom we like to
join our circle, instead of the tinselled automata—the brilliant wet
blankets—who form what the partenu world at present calls “stylish
connexions.” We mean those coteries, who in their particular
“sets,” will be found either struggling to outdo each other, or all
giving in to the whims of one particular individual; like so many
geese, following one pertinacious old gander to a pond, where they
do not like the water, but think they must go because he leads.
A little formal amusement took place when we had finished our
coffee. The Misses Lacquer played a piece of four-and-twenty pages
in length, for the piano and harp, which threw everybody into ecsta-
sies except ourselves, and afterwards sang Giorno d'Orrore, from Semi-
ramide, to prove their versatility of talent. The rest of the company
sat still and admired, or looked at albums and picturesque annuals—
those harbours of refuge for the unamused—which they had seen an
hundred times before, until their carriages were ordered, when they
disappeared as quietly and imperceptibly as a gradual thaw, with
about the same degree of coldness, being but a few degrees above
freezing.
As this appeared to be the general style of entertainment which
they provided for each other, we were not surprised to hear one or
two of the guests express their obligations to Mrs. Lacquer for their
very pleasant party : but as our own feelings were quite different, we
said no such thing, making our escape with much joy, and inwardly
resolving to “regret that a previous engagement prevented us from
again honour us with one.
WHAT'S IN A NAME.
We are informed that in consequence of the order from the Horse Guards
to the regiments who have served in the late war to wear the word “China,”
in their caps, the Peninsular veterans have applied for permission to place
“Hardware,” in the front of theirs.
ON Wednesday last Lord John Russell presided at the anniversary dinner
of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned. The
usual procession of the resuscitated took place after dinner, but we under-
stood that none of his party were amongst the number.

PUNCH, OR THE I.ONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
chapter Wi.–CONCERNING CERES.
CEREs was peculiarly the goddess of corn; but her empire included
beans: in fact it was co-extensive with the dirty acres, and corre-
sponded to the vegetable kingdom. It likewise comprehended all
things thereunto pertaining; cultivator and produce, clod and clod-
hopper, cart-horse, plough and pitch-fork, with their like.
But though Ceres presided over corn—chaff, as the learned agree,
was under the dominion of Momus. And albeit rustics were the
subjects of Ceres, Momus was the prince of clowns.
Ceres was the guardian of granaries; and she has at present a
large quantity of bonded corn to guard, which the sliding scale will
not let in. Now, with regard to the corn-law question, it is difficult
to guess at her opinion. As defender of the agricultural interest,
that is, the agricultural interest of this country, she would side, of
course, with the Duke of Buckingham ; as patroness of foreign hus-
bandry, with Mr. Cobden. But probably, as long as she gets her
sacrifices, she does not care twopence about the matter; though
certainly the cheap loaf would considerably extend her worship;
—provided that no diminution took place in wages.
The ancient Romans took the liberty—whether poetical or im-
pudent let the divinity herself decide—to call every kind of food
made of corn, Ceres. Macaroni, muffins, and crumpets, would all,
in their day, have been termed, indifferently, Ceres. Thus would
they have ennobled the “twopenny buster;” thus would they have
dignified the “twist.” Perhaps they would have extended the same
honour to all farinaceous provisions; and Ceres and soojie would
have been convertible terms. But the vital potion was unknown to
the mother of the Gracchi. If the Roman matrons gave their
children pap, no doubt they called that Ceres. Virgil mentions
“Cererem corruptam undis;”—sopped meal or biscuit;-which is
much the same thing with pap.
In the line of Virgil just alluded to, the phrase “Cerealiaque arma,”
—and baking instruments—likewise occurs. Ceres, therefore, was
the goddess of things used in baking ; except, perhaps, alum and
bone-dust.
What Ceres was, having been explained, it will now be asked, who
was she She bore the same relation, or rather relations, to Jupiter
with Juno. And what she was, and who she was, having been stated,
probably some one will next inquire what she had a year? That is
a rather impertinent question; but no matter. She had an annual
harvest in most countries, and a yearly sacrifice or two in Sicily;
one of which, as it occurred about harvest time, may have been a
Hereat several swine were immolated,

much bacon devoured, and divers hymns sung to her praise and
glory, whereof one, there is reason to conjecture, began with
“Here’s a health to our mistress, the founder of our feast.”
This, most likely, was the original of the ditty which is sung at the
present day, or at least which was sung the other day, at similar
festivals in Hampshire and elsewhere. There, however, “mistress”
is pronounced “mistarus,” and “feast,” “reeast.”
A grand gala and commemoration was also held, at some places
every fourth, and at others every fifth year, in honour of our
“Farmers' friend.” This was the celebration of the Eleusian Mys-
teries, whereat the initiated were first frightened out of their wits by
various pantomimic horrors, and while in that state induced to run
about with torches (they had no squibs), shout, yell, dance, sing, and
beat pots and kettles, with a devotion that was truly edifying.
Mythologists do not mention the circumstance, but there is no doubt
that their pockets in the meanwhile were turned inside out by the
Hierophant and his assistants. These mysteries were held in high
veneration; and he who, not being a freemason, ventured to take a
sight at them, was instantly put to death. Socrates was accused of
having disparagingly spoken of them as āugoy; for which irreverent
revelation he was very properly poisoned. What business have
philosophers to go letting out truth; why cannot they lie still
At present the only sacrifices made to Ceres consist of cash. They
are paid to her priests the bakers, who, like her more ancient min-
isters, are enormous rogues, and exact a great deal more than their
due ; moreover, in dispensing her good things, they mix up much
rubbish with them of their own. Should heathenism ever become
the professed creed of this country, Ceres, no doubt, will have a
grand temple in Baker Street. Tithes will continue to be exacted;
but they will be taken as far as may be practicable, in kind.
The severe domestic calamity which befel Ceres is known in most
circles except the civic. Like the Turk in the celebrated old English
ballad of Lord Bateman, she had an only daughter, Proserpine; who
anticipated the “beauteous Emma,” by flourishing fair beneath her
mother's eye to a degree insufferably bewitching. Pluto, King of the
Netherlands, or Infernal Regions, beheld her one unlucky day as he
was lurking on the look-out behind a bush, and she was gathering
flowers on the plains of Enna. She was fond of flowers, poor thing 1
but not of flowers of brimstone; it may be imagined, therefore, with
what feelings she would be likely to regard Pluto. His sulphureous
majesty, however, instantly fell in love with her, and as instantly
made her his own, which feat he accomplished by the summary
process of bursting from his hiding-place and seizing her, amid the
screams of her attendant nymphs, by the waist. He then smote the
ground with his trident, Earth yawned at his command, and down he
went with his victim after the manner of Mr. O. Smith.
Ceres, immediately on hearing of this outrage, had two swift
dragons harnessed to her chariot, and went post to Jupiter, to make
her complaint to his majesty. Jupiter at first tried to reconcile her to in the subterranean world. Whether Jupiter meant, by making the
the thing; but finding it useless to take that line, he guaranteed the condition, to show, figuratively, how improper it is to dine with
restoration of her daughter, provided she had taken no refreshment |inferiors, and that the exclusiveness of Olympus was to be inflexibly

maintained ; or whether he intended to humbug his petitioner, may
be questioned ; his design may have been moral, but it was more
probably insidious. He must have known that as soon as the poor
little soul had done crying, she would eat; what other resource was
there open to her As it might have been expected, so it fell out; she
saw a pomegranate in the Elysian Fields; it reminded her of her
childhood's home, and also of her not having dined; and she very
naturally ate it up. “You’ve done it !” cried the Furies from the
abyss, and the gloomy rocks and caverns around re-echoed in thunder,
“You’ve done it !” She had done it ; “her flint,” as a transatlantic
mythologist has expressed it, “was fixed for ever;” and much against
her mamma's consent and her own, she was forced to become Pluto's
queen.
To commemorate this sad event, and do the people out of their
goods, the above-mentioned mysteries were instituted.
Ceres did one very eccentric thing. She changed herself into a
mare, and thus transformed, gave birth to the colt Arion, who was
subsequently winner of the Nemaean sweepstakes (ridden by owner,
Adrastus of Argos). She was by no means proud of this prodigy,
and so annoyed was she at the birth of it, that she was actually on
the point of going into a nunnery; but Jupiter sent the Fates to
condole with her on her misfortune. They represented to her that
what was to be would be, and that it was no use to cry at what could
not be helped. With which philosophical suggestions she allowed
herself at last to be comforted.
To atone for a single foolish act, Ceres made several acts that were
wise. These were legislative acts, for the benefit of the natives of
Sicily. In return, she was serenaded for a long time with Sicilian
Vespers.
Ceres was variously pourtrayed. Sometimes she was figured
veiled, in allusion, probably, to having so nearly taken the veil. At
others she was represented with a head-dress of corn, flowers, and
blades of wheat, according to the Celestial Female Fashions for August.
Instead of a parasol, however, she had a poppy in one hand; and a
torch in place of a fan in the other. There were other images of her
on sale at the statuaries' shops; among which, if there was not one in
the shape of an old woman leaning on a staff (in reference to bread,
the staff of life), there ought to have been.
To this goddess were offered beef and mutton, as well as pork; but
which she preferred has not been satisfactorily ascertained. We
may be sure, however, that, whatever meat she had, the priests took
care it should be tender.

the latest “Indian News:”—
“The last division of the fleet, having left the Yang-Tze-Kiang river, had on the 17th
of October reached Chusan, where a portion of the troops was to be stationed for a time,
other portions were stationed at Amoy and : Kong; this latter colony is governed by
#. §altoun. It was thriving, and a proposal had been made for erecting a theatre
there.”
We have made every inquiry into the subject, and finding the report
to be perfectly true, we are inclined to believe that there can be scarcely
any doubt of its correctness. To be sure, if the intelligence should turn
out to be a mere flam, it would cause some suspicion of the veracity of an
excellent contemporary. Nevertheless, we are enabled to favour our
readers with certain intelligence, which, we think, removes the possibility
of any doubt upon the matter, and can, therefore, positively state that
Mr. John Cooper, of the Theatre Royal Covent Garden, is engaged by
Lord SALToUN as Stage-manager to the Theatre Royal Hong Kong. Mr.
Coopert will take with him a complete outfit, and the regret of the pro-
fession. An escort from Covent Garden will, it is supposed, accompany
him to Gravesend. Handsome terms have been offered to Mr. Charles
KEAN to play three nights; but that gentleman having stipulated for three
hundred, his Lordship does not, under present circumstances, think it
advisable that such an experiment should be tried upon our conquered
enemies.
A notice or motion.
Col. Sibthorpe has given notice of a motion for a return of all the “school-
masters abroad,” and the amount of Income Tax paid by them.
A certain tragedian, whose performance of Hamlet some thirty years
ago was so successful that it was repeated fifteen years afterwards, and
may probably be looked for once every ten years till further notice, boasts
of his godlike figure, but is candid enough to admit that “his paddings
have cost him a little fortune.” It may be said of him, that if his nose is
not finely chiselled, his legs are, at all events, splendidly calved.
SONGS OF THE SESSIONS.
THE COUNSEL'S CANZONET.
Here I am, here I am —from the first of the morning,
And here I remain till the close of the day ;
No brief—but a dummy—my bag is adorning,
And that I take precious good care to display.
Around me in eloquence boldly expanding,
More fortunate barristers bawl themselves hoarse;
But I am contented with silently handing
To the proper Official my motion of course.
But is eloquence only in language Oh, never
So false an assertion as that I'll allow,
A lengthy address I admit may be clever,
But grace can be met with in nought but a bow.
There's something, I'm certain, extremely beguiling
In my manner, when motions of course I hand in ;
For the proper Official salutes me with smiling,
And I his politeness return by a grin.
Then talk not of triumph by long-winded speeches, -
Compare them with acts, and their merits are small;
And Shakspere himself in his Plays somewhere teaches
The most they express who say nothing at all.
There's poetry, perhaps, in the orator's notion
When language he uses with passionate force;
But who has not heard of the poetry of motion 1
And that's to be found in the motion of course.
CŞt 33ar amb the 33rtgg.
A Good deal has been said in the papers lately about the comparative
importance of the Bar and the Press; but Punch is of opinion that they—
the Bar and the Press—are “much of a muchness.” That the dignity of the
Bar is represented by a horse-hair wig and a stuff gown, is undeniable; but
the moral influence of the press—including its advertising invitations to
try Coles's Patent Rheumatic Bands, or to Save your Income Tax at
Doudney's, is not to be for an instant questioned. The Press, which carries
the praises of Cockle's Anti-bilious Pills to the remotest corners of the
earth, certainly does more for civilization than the Bar, though a barrister
asking for judgment against the casual ejector is certainly a noble piece of
nature's handiwork. There is something very dignified in criticising the
measures of Government, which it is the duty of the press to do ; but there
is more real power exercised by the counsel, who, by merely signing his
name to a piece of paper, enables the sheriff to compute; and thus the
bar wields an enormous engine, acting—through the sheriff—on the mass
of the community.
The Bar has the glorious privilege of defending the pickpocket, while
the Press can only chronicle his actions; and the barrister's entry into a
crowded court is accompanied by a cry from the usher of “Way for the
Bar,” while the gentleman of the Press is obliged to elbow his way as he
can through the populace. This seems to give the preponderance in the
way of importance to the Bar; but altogether we think that the penny-a-
liner and the briefless one are about upon a par, and we therefore recom-
: that the contest between the two should be considered as a drawn
battle.

FINE ARTS.
(latest from windsor.)
Friday.—OUR town has been kept in a state of agreeable excitement
the whole of the day, it having been rumoured last night that Mr. F. G.
Moon, the distinguished print-seller of Threadneedle-street, would (to
further the interests of English art) make another visit to the Castle, for
the purpose of exhibiting another present (received by him from a foreign
potentate) to her Majesty and Prince Albert.
The FULL Moon-A REFLECTED Ligiit.
MR. Moon, like a man of business, arrived by an early train at Slough,
and made the best of his way to the Castle, where he had the honour of
submitting to the notice of the Queen and the Prince a pint-bottle of real
Schiedam, and half-a-dozen herrings, sent to Mr. M. by the King of Hol-
land, in acknowledgment of MR. Moon's magnificent work of Mynheer
Van Dunk, painted by — (name unknown). The Prince having for a
moment inhaled the Schiedam, pronounced it excellent ; whilst her
Majesty the Queen thought the herrings worthy of MR. Moon himself,
being “perfect bloaters.”
MR. Moon returned at four o'clock to Threadneedle-street, where he
entertained a party of his “dear and honoured friends,” the artists—the
Schiedam and herrings acting very prominent characters on the occasion.
THE HOP MARKET.
NATHAN's Kennington Hops are at present the favourites; and the
pockets being only slightly affected, the demand is general. Inferior hops
are quoted very low, and pockets are freely picked—so that the transac-
tions, though small, are extremely numerous.
THE DRUG MARKET.
The legitimate drama went off heavily at five shillings the box, and has
failed in the hands of one or two companies.
The Morning Post—one of the oldest drugs in the market—is now
never quoted. Where sleep is difficult of being procured it is still taken
in—medicinally—by a few families.
THE MEAT MARKET.
LEGs were freely walked off, and there was a pressure on ribs owing to
the rush of beggars; but knuckles came down, while calves'-heads were
looking-up steadily. At Smithfield, there was a rush of bulls, but the
transactions were of such a hazardous nature, as to appear more like a
toss-up, than firm business. Any kind of seeurity was resorted to, and
the bulls having driven a well-known speculator into a corner, he was
glad to get out as he could, though an attempt was made to pin him to
his position.
Pigs went on much at the old rates; and briskness could not be ob-
tained, though the coupons were freely offered.
The weather having been favourable to slaughtering, calves have not
been brought to the pen, - but there is something doing in beef, for the
QThe QRažette.
DIVIDENDS DECLAred.
The Marquis of Normanby's novels have just declared a dividend of
twopence halfpenny a pound, which is being paid at all the butter-shops.
PROOF OF DEBTS.
UNDER the estate of John Bull, the Whigs have proved for the deficiency
in the revenue, which is universally admitted to be owing to them exclusively.

SONGS OF THE SEEDY.
Blow on, blow on—thou wintry wind,
I care not for thy power,
Thou art not nearly so unkind
As the long pelting shower.
For Oh, the rain doth wet my clothes,
And causes me to wring 'em,
As through my parapluie it flows,
My shabby tattered gingham.
Beneath the shadow of a lamp,
That gave a flickering light—
I bought it of a cheating scamp
One dull and rainy night—
I may forgive—I can't forget
That vile delusive fellow,
It never does keep out the wet—
My gingham—torn—umbrella.
QIbtatrical Intelligentt.
BY THE observer's own correspondent.
We have it on very good authority, which has never deceived us, at least
willingly—that is to say as far as we know, though people's motives are
difficult to judge of that the difference of opinion between the lessee of a
certain theatre, and the representative of a well-known Egyptian in a
recently-acted Opera, is on the eve of being amicably settled. We are glad
of this for the sake of all parties; not that we have any particular reason
to be pleased at a matter which does not concern us, but, as we have often
said before, and we repeat it again, we wish well to the whole profession.
We know we have our enemies—and who has not?—but we do not see that
we ought to be disliked by any one, nor do we think we are, though we
seldom find ourselves right in our conjectures.
The production of Der Freischutz at Drury Lane has created a good
deal of conversation in the theatre, and some people have been going
about saying one thing, while some have stood still and said another. The
owl in the incantation scene may or may not be the owl that appeared
when the opera was first brought out, but if it should be it is nothing to
us, while if it should not be it is nothing to any one.
3Foreign Intelligentt.
The overland cab from Hounslow has arrived since our last, bringing
letters up to the latest dates, and a passenger up to Piccadilly. The turn-
pike at Hammersmith was in possession of the British, who were selling to
every one who passed in vehicles a letter of safe-conduct. There was a
dreadful variance between some of the district clocks, and on a show of
hands being taken, the result was fearfully contradictory.
At Brompton there seems a desire on the part of the inhabitants to
cultivate friendly relations, for the people are flocking to the pawnbrokers,
whom they address by the endearing title of uncle. The treaty between
Chelsea and Battersea only waits for the signature of the beadle, who is
taking six lessons of Mr. Carstairs. By the terms of the Convention,
Chelsea gives up nothing, and Battersea takes all that is thus ceded. It
will thus be partly a dead letter, and when drawn up, it will probably be
consigned to the dead letter office accordingly.

PUNCH, OR THE

LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPTER VII.-PATTY RETURNS HOME-AN UNEXPECTED WISITOR.
WHEN Mr. Flamingo had fairly crossed the threshold of the round-
house, he paused, and throwing as much solemnity as lay in his power
into his figure, voice and manner, asked of Patty, “What she thought
would become of her ?”
Poor girl that thought was then busy at her heart—that thought
then bewildered her : she answered not a word—but sobbed bitterly.
“See what it is to have fallen into the hands of a Christian,” con-
tinued the feather-merchant. “If Mr. Curlwell had only pressed his
charge,”—that worthyperson being too modest to listen to his praises,
had walked quickly on—“what, what could have saved you from
oakum and Bridewell ? If you're not quite lost to shame and virtue,
you'll pray for that good man.”
“Pray for him 1" cried Knuckle. “Well, master, if you don't
make the flesh shake upon one's bones—I tell you, as I’ve told you
before, it was the old fellow himself who insulted the child—it was"—
“Silence, sir—silence 1 That shocking habit you have of speaking
against your betters will some day take you to Tyburn. Don't I
know the gentleman well ? A man with money in the Bank | A man
in the confidence of one of my best customers : A man with such a
fatherly look 1–wears powder, and everything respectable Is it
likely, eh?” asked the feather-merchant, with an invincible air. “As
for you"—and Flamingo turned to Patty—“as a Christian, I hope
you'll not want bread; but—no l—I owe it to Mrs. Flamingo—I owe
it to the virtuous young people about me—you never eat another
crumb of mine.”
“I did nothing, sir—I said nothing—indeed, sir—I-oh, sir!—you
don't know what I’ve suffered.”—Patty could stammer out no more.
“Suffered 1 And what have I suffered Is it nothing to have
one's property flaunted about in a round-house Gracious me ! if
the world knew what had happened to these feathers, where would
be my reputation—and more, where would be my connexion ? The
feathers now,” said Flamingo, “ar’n’t worth a groat.”
“Well, if they have been tumbled a little," urged Knuckle, “can't
Patty put 'em all to rights again "
“Yes, indeed, sir,” cried Patty, earnestly—“indeed I will—I'll not
sleep first.”
“Humph " said Flamingo, “and how do I now know that the
property will be safe?” Patty spoke not a word ; but she looked in
the face of Flamingo—in his hard, swoln, prosperous face—and the
look made his eye blink, and his lip work; he violently rubbed his
chin, and said hurriedly, “Well, well, I hope after all, that you are
honest; and so, under the circumstances—I’ve no doubt I’m setting
a bad example—still, under the circumstances,” (it was thus delicately
Flamingo touched upon the death of Patty's mother,) “I’ll bring
myself to trust you. Now, go home ; say your prayers, be a good girl,
and particularly mind that I have the feathers to-morrow.—Luke, I
want you—quick.”
Saying this, Mr. Flamingo walked towards his westward habitation.
Now, the feather-merchant was, when all is said, not really so coarse
and selfish as his words and manner seemingly proclaimed him. He
did not credit all the story told, or rather cunningly hinted, by Curl-
well, of Patty; nevertheless, he would not trust himself to disbelieve
Lord Huntingtopper's valet : he was so respectable, so well-placed, and
more, he was in the establishment of a nobleman, whose lady had
such a laudable love of feathers . Therefore, Flamingo suffered his
belief to be nicely balanced between the valet and the girl; both
might be right—both might be wrong. Flamingo was, however, one
of those politic folks, who think the surest way to make people, that
is, people depending upon them, better than they are, is to treat them
as if they were infinitely worse. A workman had only to commit
some heinous fault, and so entirely forfeit the confidence of his
master, to learn for the first time what an estimable person the
feather-merchant had once thought him. A man had only to turn
thief, to make Flamingo earnestly declare that “he would have trusted
that man with untold gold.” Such trust, however, it had never really
been his weakness to put in the human animal.
Knuckle, having said a few hurried words of comfort to Patty,
followed his master. Patty, then, with quickened steps, turned
towards her home. Yes, with lightened heart, she almost ran along
the street, gliding and shrinking from every passer-by, as though
dreading some new impediment, some terrible delay, to keep her from
a hearth, where death alone remained to greet her. So happy, so
strangely happy was she at her escape from the den she had quitted,
so relieved from the paralysing dread that the last—last consolation
would have been denied her, that, in her assurance of liberty, she
seemed to lose a conviction of that irreparable misery at home : she
ran once more to find her mother, hardly for the time remembering,
that that mother had passed away for ever.
The bell of St. Martin's tolls two, and Patty, with swoln eyes and
anxious, bloodless face, is working alone. She is sewing some piece of
dress, a mourning garment, a piece of decent outside black, purchased
by the sacrifice of almost all necessary apparel—of the very bed-cover-
ing, for which in the coming winter nights she may starve with winter
cold; she is working, mechanically working, her face dead, blank
with misery—her fingers only moving
(What a hideous vanity may leer from out the ornamental mourn-
ing of the rich—what elaborate mockery of woe in gauze and flounce,
bought over fashion's counter —but what a misery on the misery of
death—what sacrifice upon suffering in the black of the poor, bought
with money lent—that is, sold—by the money-broker )
The church-bell had scarcely ceased to sound, when a low, distinct
knock struck on the door; again, and again, yet Patty heard it not ;
but continued at her work, absorbed and unconscious. The door
opened, and a female, silently as a shadow, glided in.
“Patty, Patty,” said the visitor.
Patty lifted up her head, was about to shriek, when, by a violent
effort, she subdued her emotion, and, laying down her work and
rising from her chair, she asked with trembling voice—“In the name
of God, who, what are you ?”
“Do you not know me, Patty?” said the woman with a slight
shudder.
“Can it be Jessy 1” cried Patty.
“It is that wretch ; though God bless you for calling me Jessy,
that's something.”
“I should not have known you ; what has happened, are you not
well ?” asked Patty, hurriedly, becoming alarmed at the unearthly
aspect of her visitor.
Indeed her appearance was changed and terrible. Her face looked
clay-cold, and clay-wet ; white and reeking from the agony of brain
and heart. Her black eyes had something awful in their wild energy,
and her discoloured lips were pressed as one together, as though to
master and control the passionate grief that struggled to burst from
her. Thus changed, thus possessed, it was no wonder that Patty
paused ere she recognised in her visitor the lost, the wretched girl,
whose sympathy had awakened in her sorrowing heart a feeling of
sisterly pity, of mournful gratitude. Poor creature the look of
trading misery, the reckless, flaunting air that a few hours since she
deemed a fitting, necessary grace, was lost, destroyed in the intensity
of mental suffering. Contrasting her past aspect with her present,
she seemed a thing of vulgar vice, elevated and purified by agony;
the hideous farce of wretchedness affecting mirth, heightened to the
solemnity of mortal tragedy.
“What's the matter What do you want—here " asked Patty,
timidly, and endeavouring not to shrink back from the figure which—
despite of her attempted firmness—seemed to dilate and grow more
terrible before her. “What do you want here f" repeated Patty,
and she glanced at the coffin. The look, on the sudden, changed
the woman to meekness; and the next moment touched her into tears.
“I would not for the world, dear Patty—oh, let me for this night
call you so—I would not disturb you, and at such a time—I would
not, but there's something at my heart—do let me tell it—do, or my
heart will break.” With gushing eyes, the poor outcast made this
passionate request; and Patty, with pitying looks, offered her a chair.
“What is the matter 1" asked Patty with her sweet, tender voice,
made more cordial by the uncontrollable sorrow that possessed her
visitor.
“I’ll tell you,” said the woman with an effort; and in a few
moments, with dry eyes, but with a voice deep and husky with sub-
dued emotion, she thus proceeded. “I come, Patty, first to ask your
forgiveness.”
“You never offended me—indeed, no,” said Patty.
“I tell you, yes; many a time, I have laughed at you—sneered at
you—called you foul names. And why? It was to relieve my heart
—it would have burst if I had not. When I saw you so young, so
innocent, so cheerful, working early and late for the dear soul that
now lies there”—Patty unconsciously stretched her hands towards
the coffin—“Hal” cried Jessy, “you may look there—you may
pray there ! I could not dare to do it—for my mother would rise in
her shroud and curse me.”
“No, no—do not think so,” said Patty, “it is not goodness to
think so.”

*Butlet me say,” cried Jessy, “what I came to say. You did not
know when I sneered and laughed at you, how much I loved you;
but was it for such as I was to say so? No: and so I relieved my
heart with madness and vile words, and—but that is over; I have
seen that to-night”—here the woman shuddered, and her cheek
quivered with terror—“seen what has changed me.”
“Thank heaven for it, Jessy,” cried Patty, with a look of gladness.
“You forgive me?” Patty took the speaker's hand, and pressed it
between her own. “And will you, before we part for ever, let me—
it will ease my heart—let me tell you my miserable story?”
“If 'twill indeed please you, yes,” said Patty.
“It shall be in few words—for I am in torment while I speak; yet
it is a torment, that a something, I know not what, will make me
suffer. I am country-born; my childhood was one long happy holi-
day: I was an only child, and was to my father as his heart was to
his bosom. All life to me was nothing but happy sounds and happy
sights. My first trouble was the departure of a neighbour's son for
the sea; but we parted with a vow of lasting love, and that vow was
approved by our parents. I–I–two years passed—my heart was
changed; some devil had altered my nature—I became vain, head-
strong, selfish—I left my father's house a wicked, guilty thing, and
for three years have tried to hide my shame here, in London. Oh
those three years 1 Had the sky for that time rained fire upon me, I
had not suffered half so much. My story is nearly done. Two hours
since I was in the street—laughing, loudly laughing, from an empty
and corrupted heart. A man slowly passed me; with a laugh, I laid
my hand upon his shoulder—he turned his head—oh, Christ —it was
my father "
With these words the wretched woman sank back in the chair, and
with fallen mouth, fixed eyes, and ghastly features, looked, on the
sudden, death-struck. Patty was about to rise to seek assistance,
when Jessy grasped her by the hand, and held her with convulsive
strength.
In a few minutes she became composed, and then proceeded:–
“Patty, I am now determined. I quit this life of horror. I will
pray to find something like peace—like goodness. I have done you
harm—will you forgive me—forgive the wretched Magdalen—and—
yes—pray for her?”
Saying this, Jessy, in a passion of grief, dropt upon her knees;
§§ starting from her chair, and hiding her face in her hands,
sooned -
“I do forgive you—I pray for you—I—God in heaven bless and
strengthen you!”
RULE AND EXCEPTION.

PUNCH*S PARLIAMENT.
The distress of THE COUNTRY.
THE debate on this subject was resumed.
Mr. Hume had made calculations on the distress of the country,
and begged leave to refer to a slate which contained his figures.
Now, he (Mr. Hume) had been accused of quoting Cocker, but he
would continue to quote Cocker. Now, it was quite true that if sixteen
families received forty-five loaves in a week, it gave two loaves to
each and thirteen over; but what did this amount to (Hear, hear.)
There was a baby in the city he had the honour to represent, who
had been brought up by hand, and if all the babies in all the cities of
England and Ireland were thrown on the general food of the country,
what would be the residue in the granaries? (Hear.) Let the House
ask themselves that, and let them do as he did—if they wished to
solve the question—let them go home and consult Cocker. (A laugh.)
The House might laugh on both sides, but let the House take care
it did not eventually laugh on the wrong side. When he (Mr. Hume)
was a boy (Cries of “Question.”) Well! and that was the question.
When he was a boy (for he would repeat it), his (the honourable
member's) mother used to allow him sixpence whenever he brought
home a prize from school. Well, and what did the House think
was the result Why, that he (the honourable member) never
got any pocket-money. (Hear.) Now, he (Mr. Hume) knew he
was a fool then, and he had been told that he was a fool now,
but he was not bound to believe it, at least, all of it. (Cheers.) With
regard to the distress of the country, he thought it might be pre-
vented if there was any way of stopping it. This brought
him again to Cocker. (Oh, Oh.) Well, if the House did not
like it, if they would not go through the figures with him
one by one, they could lump them into a total; and thus,
if his way of doing it was not liked, it could be lumped,
and there was an end of it. (Cheers.) He should now sit down, and
having made a speech on one side of the question, he should record
his vote for the other. There were always two sides to every ques-
tion, and the only way to do justice to both was to give a fair chance
to each of them. (Cheers.)
Colonel Sibthorp had listened very attentively to the accounts of
the public distress, but he did not believe any one of them. He (the
gallant Colonel) was a public man, and if the distress had beer.
public he, as a public man, must have been affected by it. (Hear.)
He had been told there were several families who got no meat from
one week's end to another : what of this? Let the House inquire
whether there had been any falling off in the number of bullocks
slaughtered during the past year ! To be sure there had not.
Then what had become of all the meat Somebody had had it—
ay, and eaten it too. (A laugh.) He (Colonel Sibthorp) had never
experienced any difficulty; then what was meant by a deficiency of
food He (the gallant Colonel) did not understand it. He should
vote with Sir R. Peel; but as he (Colonel Sibthorp) did not quite
understand whether the motion was favourable or unfavourable to
his party, he should reserve the expression of an opinion on that
part of the subject until the time arrived for a division.
Mr. Peter Borthwick then rose, but the rush of Members towards
the door was so great that the honourable gentleman was left alone,
and was proceeding to address the House, when the speaker peremp-
torily counted him out of it.

A NATURAL agent is, as its name imports, an agent of nature; and all

very great power, very often turning—a mill; and when mixed with brandy,
it frequently gives a rotatory motion to every object—at least as far as the
oersons are concerned who have resorted to the very powerful agency
alluded to. Water is a very natural agent, for all the metropolitan milk-
men; and, in conformity with the truth that it always finds its level, it
generally causes a very perceptible rising in all the milk-cans. Such is
the power of water, that, when held in solution with ordinary chalk, a
pound weight of it has been found capable of raising a penny. Humbug
is also entitled to be called a natural agent ; and a parliamentary agent
falls under this description. Inanimate agents are better than living
agents; for instance, a steam-engine is better than a lawyer—for while
the former generates steam, the latter generates hot water, and is pretty
sure to plunge us into it.
It is said by political economists that inanimate agents are capable of
much more rapid action than those that are alive; but the political
economists seem to have forgotten that no action can be so rapid as that
commenced by an attorney on a bill of exchange when his object is to
create value—in the shape of costs, which he runs up with a rapidity of
action that is truly astonishing. The East-India Tea Company professes
to be very particular in the appointment of its agents; but every tea-
kettle is in some degree an agent, if the Company's teas are used in the
family where the kettle is located.
Frost is an agent for the plumbers, by putting the pipes out of repair;
and when one of the Syncretics publishes a tragedy, he becomes at once
an agent for the butter-shops.
MATERNAL SOLICITUDE.
Mothert,
DAUGHTER, wherefore on thy cheek
Shines that tear, the sign of woe—
What thy cause of sorrow —speak |
Sure a parent ought to know !
Does the retrospect of years
To thine eyes those tear-drops bring 1–
Bright thy childhood's May appears,
And thy Summer's like thy spring.
What another glistening drop !
Whence the cause—can it be love –
Passion rankling spite of hope,
Then thy wayward heart reprove.
Does thy brother's last good-bye
Cause these drops, my Isabelle —
Wherefore start they in thine eye ;
Tell me, dearest daughter, tell ?
DAUGhter.
Mother, well you know the reason;
Don't call me your dearest daughter 1
If you had these ducks to season,
Wouldn't your old eyelids water

MEDICAL HINTS.
WHEN troubled with the head-ache pay a visit to a Union workhouse,
which will transfer the affection to your heart. Next read through the
last number of Punch, and the ache will first be driven to your sides, and
as soon as the remedy has operated, will be expelled altogether.
A large appetite is an alarming symptom ; it is a precursor of consump-
tion. Take a sheet of white paper, whereupon set down, in a column, your
rent, land-tax, window-tax, poor's-rate, church-rate, water-rate, and your
other rates and taxes, not forgetting your income-tax. To these add your
butcher's bill, baker's bill, tailor's bill, and other bills, particularly any
bill that you may have accepted, and which is on the point of coming
due. Add up and contemplate the sum total, which will very probably take
away your appetite.
Somnolency may be removed by involving yourself in a Chancery suit
endangering your whole property. So long as your case remains unde-
cided, you will have little disposition to sleep.
A dry skin results from obstruction in the pores. If ablution and
abstersion fail to relieve you, and running a mile in a great-coat prove
ineffectual, write an after-piece, and get it played for the first time on some
night when the theatre is sure to be full. Go in with the public when
the doors open, and wedge yourself into the middle of the pit. You will
soon have no occasion to complain of a dry skin.

THE LEGEND OF THE SARACEN’S HEAD.
When the Saracens maintained an unequal contest with the Crusaders,
Richard the Second took up his tent, and pitched it excessively strong at
Palestine. We have hunted the annals of the wars, and turned over the
despatches of the Duke of Wellington, in the hope of finding materials for
a legend ; but not being able to meet with anything of the kind, we have
rushed back to our own resources, for there, at all events, “We know a
bank,” as the song says, that we can always draw upon.
The legend of the Saracen's Head is an interesting one. When Richard
returned from the Crusades, he was of course much fatigued, and on enter-
ing London he very naturally required some refreshment. The weary
monarch, on arriving at Snow Hill, which stands in the same relation to
Skinner-street as the Alps do to Italy, he called loudly for a tapster, and
having drunk rather freely, “untille ye headde of ye Kinge did swimme
ryghte royallie,” says the historian of that era, he began laying about him
right and left with a battle-axe, to the “astoundmente and dyscomfytture
of ye courtierres.” . Upon which one of “ye Barons" said, “I wish his
Majestie hadde the head of a Saracen before him just nowe, for I trowe
he would play ye deuce with itte.” Whereupon, the King paid all the
damage, and gave permission that the house should be called the Saracen's
Head, which is the name it bears even to the present day.
We have this legend from Lydgate, who got it from one of the king's
own fellows, but where the fellow himself had it we are unable to give any
account whatever.
Mons, JOURDAIN on “THE RIGHT OF SEARCH.
SoME very bad language has passed between Lord Brougham and M. de
Tocqueville respecting the old story of the Right of Search. Lord
Brougham accuses the Frenchman of ignorance—whilst the Frenchman
vindicates the comprehensiveness of his knowledge. One thing is certain
in this Right of Search : if the French do not know how to vary their
arguments, they have at least numberless ways of shifting the same words.
They remind us in this of their own Bourgeois Gentilhomme, who would
take lessons of the Philosopher as to the mode of saying the same sen-
tence—“Beautiful Marchioness, your beautiful eyes make me die with
love”—twenty different ways. He will, however, use those words and
no other: whereupon says—
“Master of Philosophy.—In the first place, you may use them as you
have used them—Beautiful Marchioness, your beautiful eyes make me
die with lore.
“Or, again.—With love to die, they make me—beautiful Marchioness—
your beautiful eyes. -
“Or, again.—Your beautiful eyes with love make me—beautiful
Marchioness—die.
“Or, again.—To die, your beautiful eyes—beautiful Marchioness—
make me with love.
“Or, again.—They make me, your beautiful eyes, to die—beautiful
Marchioness—with love /"
On the Right of Search, the French say—
“Perfidious Albion would destroy French commerce and dominate the
seas.”
Or, again.-‘‘Albion perfidious, French commerce would destroy, and
the seas dominate.”
Or, again.—“The seas dominate and French commerce destroy, would
perfidious Albion 1"
Or, again.—“Albion would dominate the seas, and French commerce
destroy—perfidious !”
STANZAS WRITTEN IN DEJECTION.
I AM alone—the poet is alone.
Yet fantasies are filling fast his brain,
Around him all things in confusion thrown,
Seem cast together in the vast inane,
An object gone—is quickly there again :
Surely that tree has got a double trunk,
* Even the earth refuses to remain
Fix'd in its place—it rises, now has sunk.
Creation shines around—the poet's very drunk 1
Where am I?—Ah ! upon the poet's ear
Voices are falling indistinct but loud.
“Make way, make way—a passage quickly clear,
Keep off the populace—push through the crowd.”
Thus they exclaim—what mystery doth shroud
The poet's strange and awful situation {
What means it? Let the truth be straight avowed,
I cannot bear suspense—death and tarnation :
I see it all—they drag the poet to the Station.

PUNC
THE PEARLS OF PARLIAMENT.
It is the benign intention of Punch—during the present sitting of the
Wittenagemot—to enrich his pages with the pearls that drop from Par-
liamentary talkers. Some of the pearls he may, certainly, after his
peculiar fashion, dissolve in his own vinegar—the more valuable, how-
ever, will be set and remain for the admiration of future ages.
Members of Parliament are of course returned to the House for the
ems which they are there expected to let fall from their lips. It cannot,
ſº. be disputed that a few of them never open their mouths at all;
whilst those among the frequent talkers speak anything but diamonds and
rubies. There is Mr. FERRAND, for instance ; like an old bewitched
woman in the days of sorcery, he never opens his lips but he throws forth
crooked pins, “devil's dust,” bits of cotton, with now and then small
lumps of brimstone; others—Dan O'Connell for one-talk brickbats and
bludgeons; whilst D'Israeli speaks tapeworms (several of these are bottled,
and to be seen in Long-Acre), things without any visible head or tail.
Other men, however, do occasionally drop pearls; and these it will be
the purpose of Punch to set.."
In the debate on the Distress of the Country, orators of peculiar
characteristics took an active part. Apuleius tells us, that when meta-
morphosed, he endeavoured to exclaim, “Oh, Jupiter !" but could do
nothing but bray. There are several members in a certain assembly in a
like predicament. We have no doubt that they would talk pearls, but
when they open their mouths, we are immediately reminded of thistles.
others, though enriched with wisdom, never speak at all-the gem is
within them—the pearl is there, but “mute, inglorious oysters,”—they
never show it.
Our first business, however, is with the aforesaid Knights of the
Thistle. Mr. Gibson observed in the course of his speech —” Acts, little
short of murder, had been imputed to those of them who belonged to the
Anti-Corn Law League;” whereupon certain Members cried, “Hear,
hear,”—whilst others (we subjoin their portraits)—cried,
--
“Yaw, haw Yaw, haw 1
Caligula made a consul of his horse; Englishmen (and they are doubt-
less perfectly right in their device), send the above members as their fitting
representatives.
r. Pereg Boarhwick we have always respected for his eloquence :
but we little thought he would have so strong a claim upon our veneration
for his experience and antiquity. Nobody; to look at him, would believe it;
but he was an inhabitant of the Garden of Eden. Under what denomina-
tion he took his passage in the ark, he has not vouchsafed to discover to
us; but we think we can guess. In Eden he was, however, as his recent
speech testifies; for he says,
“The principle of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest, was, in
fact, only the principle of common sense, which had been applied to all matters of
common exchange, from the time of the erchange of a rose for a lily in the Garden of
Eden, between Adam and Eve, down to the exchange in modern times of a case of
she meld cutlery for a quarter of American corn” (“Hear, hear,” and a laugh].
Now, we want to inquire of Peter Borthwick who gave the rose—and
who gave the lily
The artist, it will be seen, has given a faithful sketch of the transaction
taken on the spot, by Mr. Peter Borthwick (who is himself in the fore-
ground), and who has in the handsomest manner bestowed the original
sketch upon Punch.
To return, however, to the Rose and the Lily? Was it Eve gave the
Rose? if so, was it a Blush Rose—a Cabbage Rose—or any other of the
ten thousand varietics of Roses, many of which will significantly jump to

- - ----->==
the mind of the reader. If so, had Eve the best of the exchange f Wero
Roses up and Lilies down at the time Was it a Lily of the Valley—a
Water-Lily—or a Tiger Lily Punch expects an answer.
We cannot, however, dismiss the *. in a frivolous vein. Punch
cannot but regret that a vile commercial spirit should have entered thus
early into the world—and that man and wife should have instituted an
exchange, for no other reason than to get a bargain—in a word, to over-
reach one another. This is a melancholy view of human nature—a sad
beginning of our race; and therefore, as typical of at once the origin and
the antiquity of barter, we would suggest that the New Royal Exchange
should have for its weathercock, not the Old Gresham grasshopper, but
the Old Serpent ; for we certainly believe that the exchange of the Lily
and the Rose must have been after “the fall.”
In the same debate Mr. Liddell (member for Durham) let fall the
idea of a speculation which must have its effect upon the iron trade,-
namely, “a railroad from the Earth to the planet Jupiter,” by which the
English manufacturer might very shortly glut the market there with
woolens, hardware, cotton, &c. To this Mr. BRotherton opposed a cal-
culation, which proved that, with all our machinery, we could not, up to the
present time, furnish three quarters of a yard for every biped in the habit-
able globe. This may, or may not, be true; for as yet Punch is not pre-
pared with counter-figures: but we think the notion of opening an account
with the planets is, from its magnificence, quite worthy of the grandeur of
the age. From all we have
heard of the people in Ju-
piter, (we believe the sub-
joined portraits may be de-
pended upon)—they are
people of most enlightened
notions; and in exchange
for our tin, might afford us
“divine philosophy.” How-
ever, the idea of planetary
commerce once broached,
who knows how compre-
hensively it may be worked out! One thing is certain—if at all practi-
cally developed, we must have Consuls in the various luminaries to pro-
tect our trade ; hence, we may see SIBritorp officially placed in the Dog.
star, and Mr. Joseph HuME specially favoured by Venus: whilst, should
some hirsute comet desire to open an account with this, who so fit to
conduct the negotiation as our excellent friend Mr. MUNTz
Punch has been present at many, many debates, but never did he hear
eloquence like that of Sir Charles Napier-glorious old tarpaulin —on
the Distress of the Country. Give Punch eloquence that goes to the very
heart of a man—that makes his blood simmer—that sets off his pulses at
a pleasant rate, and, indeed, “wraps him in Elysium.” Hear, then, Sir
Charles upon the iniquitous—the soul-degrading tax upon port wine :-
“It appeared to him extremely hard that the British public—persons having small
properties of £200 or æ3)0 a year—should not be able to put upon their table a glass of
wine to entertain their friends with—(Hear, hear). It was perfectly abominable to
think of it—(Cheers and laughter.) At present, a person of limited income was obliged
to drench his stomach and that of his friends with currant and gooseberry wine,
which added nothing to the Treasury, instead of drinking wholesome port, which he
might easily do if the trade with Portugal were thrown open.”
Punch pities the man—in a spirit of the profoundest melancholy pities
the wretch—who can read the above without a moisture at the eyes | It
is abominable, Sir Charles, that I–Punch—am compelled to put off, with
a wan cheek and sickly smile, detestable currant and gooseberry, when—
Silenus be my judge l—my soul yearns to give my gossips the very finest
crusted port. My feelings are the feelings of tens of thousands; hence I
am convinced of it, that a great portion of the discontent of the country is
fermented in currant and gooseberry, when it might be beautifully “laid
down” in rich, fruity port. While on the subject, too, there is another
evil, as I devoutly believe, intimately connected with the Inisery and dis-
content of the country; and that is, the shameful and unprincipled variety
in the size of wine-bottles. When every wine-bottle shall—by statute-
be made to hold a certain measure, then may we boast of Magna Charta—
but, certainly, not till then. Punch, however, leaves the subject to his
gallant Napier ; and if at the next Marylebone election, Bacchus,
" charioted by pards,” do not come to chair his noblest champion, may
Bacchus himself be henceforth doomed to Brett or Booth—or both !
Considering the intimate connexion between the present Corn Laws and
coffins, Sir Charles ventured a pleasant illustra-
tion, at which—we saw him—Sir Robert laughed
consumedly. Sir Charles spoke of a West Indian
undertaker :—
“He invented a sliding scale (laughter); he invented a
sliding bottom which was put into the coffin, and he bribed
all the grave-diggers, when an interment took place, to
slide out the bottom, and to drop the body into the grave,
so that one coffin served for a great number of persons.
(Laughter.)”
Every body may make out this parable : it
is simply that the same Corn Laws, (i. e. the one
coffin,) serves to bury thousands.
Sir Robert Peel's reply was smooth—so smooth,
you might have sucked it. There was, however,
one point in it intended to reach as far as

l'aris: we hope it will do so. Speaking of France and England, Sir
Robert said:—
“It is a remarkable thing to see two men who hold the most conspicuous offices
in the Government of their respective countries,-the most distinguished in each for
their military achievements and military character, men whº have learned the art and
miseries of war on the fields of Toulouse and Waterloo, and who have been opposed
to each other on the field of battle—
-- Stetimus tela aspera contra,
Contulimusque manus; ”
—it is a remarkable thing to see those two men exerting all their influence, in each
country, they being the best judges of the sacrifices which war imposes; to inculcate the
lessons of peace,—it is a glorious occupation for their declining years.”
This picture is, indeed, so delightful, that Punch—in a moment of en-
thusiasm—throws it upon paper :—
To the eye of Punch, both old gentlemen look considerably better than
when bristling up at Toulouse and Waterloo. May they be the last of the
generals | The last who wear laurels watered by the heart's blood of
thousands—bedeved by the tears of the widow and the orphan 1

PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER VII.-OF DIANA,
HER Serene Highness Hecate Luna Diana was a princess of the
Olympic blood-royal, or, to speak more accurately, ichor-royal ; for
the celestial circulation is ichorous. She was one of the numerous
olive-branches which adorned the throne of Jupiter, to whom she
was presented one fine morning, at Delos, by Latona. Her Serene
Highness, on her entrance into existence, was accompanied by the
young prince, Apollo.
The title of Serene Highness has been conferred in the above
paragraph on Diana, because, in her capacity of Luna, she presided
over the moon. As Hecate she was the goddess of magic and
enchantments; in her proper and principal character, she was the
patroness of field-sports.
Diana, therefore, was not called Hecate Luna, as some ladies are
named Caroline Matilda, and others Mary Anne; but the appella-
tions which were conferred on her had reference to the offices which
she fulfilled.
Our goddess, existing, so to speak, under three heads, is, with
reason, represented by some sculptors accordingly. Thus, though
Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, Diana, of the two, was the better
off for head. By other artists, she is exhibited as a tall manly look-
ing young lady in buskins, or high-lows without stockings, setting off
a remarkably fine development of the gastrocnemii muscles; a pecu-
liarity which the shortness of her attire—that of an ancient huntress,
(not a riding habit)—allowed to be fully apparent. In her hand she
had a bent bow, at her back was a quiver of arrows—weapons for
which, had the Greeks been more civilised, would have been substi-
tuted a fowling-piece and shot-belt.
To give Diana all her titles as it were in a lump, the ancients
sometimes called her Triformis. And as there was supposed to be
some mystical connexion between her and number three, which,
however, was not fully made out till the invention of the shot of that
name, her statue used to be set up where three ways met, with the
title of Trivia. The thinking mind will infer that it there probably
served for a finger-post, and that bills and notices were pasted upon
it ; at least if the ancients had such things, and did not consider it
wicked to display them in that manner.
As there were no game-laws in the time of Diana, she must be
considered the goddess of poaching as well as of hunting. The cele-
brated song, (in the agricultural dialect), “When I wur bound
apprentice,” was most likely derived from some hymn in her honour,
a supposition which is favoured by the circumstance of its burden
being—
sº 24: - -
*::::::::::::::: ****
for therein her divinity as Luna, the mistress of the moon, is plainly
recognised; the worshipper thus, not to speak it profanely, killing
two birds with one stone.
It is curious that Diana should have been the goddess of hunting
and witchcraft, between which matters there seems to be about as
much connexion as there is between theology and cribbage; though
in Der Freischütz, to be sure, they have been combined. Very
probably Diana inspired the composer: somebody more than human
did if she did not. Who knows but that the Huntsmen's Chorus,
also, is a traditionary psalm, appointed formerly to be sung in her
temples 1
Diana seems, among other things, to have been the goddess, like-
wise, of old maids, though whether this idea respecting her was
derived from her connexion with cross ways, may be questioned.
Those, too, who are fond of quibbles, may speculate whether, from
being the deity of the chase, she came to be regarded as presiding
over the chaste. Certain it is,
she was never married, al-
though she had several flirta-
tions, to wit, with Endymion,
Pan, and Orion. Indulgence
in this kind of amusement
makes many a lady an old
maid; but Diana, it is said,
declared she never would
marry. The comparative
reader will discern a pleas-
ing analogy between her and
Queen Elizabeth, whose En- W.
dymion was the Earl of
Fssex.
The subject of Diana and
Endymion would be an excel-
lent one for a ballet; and it is
wonderful that no French
dancing-master has availed
himself of it for that purpose.
Endymion was a Carian shep-
herd, who had obtained from
Jupiter two very desirable
boons. One of these was
sound and refreshing sleep at
will, independently of narco-
tics or animal magnetism ; )
the other, eternal youth-
What master would like a
sleepy shepherd it is difficult S
to conceive; but the somno- \
lency of Endymion procured
him a mistress. Diana (she
may have admired a sleepy
eye) fell in love with him as
he slept on Mount Latmos.
He looked so interesting (for
a classical shepherd did not
eat bacon, nor wear a smock-
frock and hob-nailed boots),
that she could not refrain
from showering, in the shape
of moon-beams, various kisses
on his brow. His dreams all
this while must have been of
a decidedly agreeable cast;
and he must have felt him-
self very pleasantly situated
on awaking. Night after
night did Diana descend upon
Latmos to enjoy the society
of her beloved. For a long
time they kept company to-
gether; and the goddess ś
fondly deemed that the heart E.
of the shepherd was her own;
but, ah I he transferred it
to another. He became ac-
quainted with a young lady
of the name of Chromia, whom, unmindful of his former vows, he shortly
afterwards espoused. Whether he preferred her gold to Diana's
silver, or whether he was overcome by her superior charms, is not
satisfactorily known. Diana might have brought an action against
him for breach of promise of marriage; but as she had always
declared an intention to live single, she would perhaps have been

nonsuited; and besides, what atonement, or ointment, are damages for
wounded feelings?
Everybody knows, or ought to know, that Diana had a famous
temple at Ephesus. It was accounted one of the seven wonders of
the world, for the world, in those days, had only seven wonders,
instead of, as it has now, some seventy times seven thousand, ex-
clusive of the Thames Tunnel and Punch. Hereat butcher's meat,
poultry, vegetables, and other good things, were sacrificed on her
altars; but the Lacedaemonians were womt yearly to offer her human
victims, which, in these more civilised times, are immolated exclusively
to Mars and Mammon. But Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver, abolished
this practice, and substituted for it the annual whipping of children,
Diana being partial to the whip. We have discontinued the annual
flagellation of children; but we flog them daily at the shrine of
Learning, to teach them grammar and arithmetic, and make them
wise and good.
Country squires, who keep packs of hounds, sacrifice much time
and not a little money to Diana; sometimes, in the excess of their
devotion, they break their necks, and so sacrifice themselves. A
tremendous sacrifice of partridges to this goddess occurs every year
on the first day of September; but, with these, in the neighbourhood
of London, domestic poultry and dogs are killed in considerable
numbers. The Athenians are said to have offered her white kids,
whence it may by some be conjectured that she was the goddess of
evening parties.
Diana, though the goddess of hunting in general, was not the
goddess of all sorts of hunting; she had nothing to do with fortune-
hunting; nor yet with hunting the slipper. Neither was she the
goddess of truffle-hunting, nor of hunting after ideas. Some may
contend that she was the goddess of rat-hunting and duck-hunting ;
others that she as no such thing; nor will the dispute be easy of
decision.
If Diana took to hunting from blighted hopes and slighted affection,
as she not improbably did, she was wiser than if she had taken to
drinking. Hence all young ladies and gentlemen may see how
much better it is, when jilted, to have recourse to horse exercise, than
it is to drown their misery in the bowl.
THE LOST FLEECE.
PUNCH has somewhere read an anecdote of Prince Esterhazy, who, on
being asked how many sheep he owned, replied with a smile, “Upon my
life, I can't tell; but I believe I have about five hundred shepherds.”
Here is a man, you would think, hedged in from all the wants of life—one
rich in thousands of flocks—the dew of heaven “on his fleece"—a very
Emperor of Mutton. Alas! read but the following from the Times : —
“Prince Esterhazy is said to have fallen into a state of metancholy since he mislaid
his insignia of the order of the Golden Fleece, so that it is probable he will never again
be appointed to any political office.”
Imagine “the noble mind o'erthrown" by such an accident 1 Consider
the hiped who was wont to sport a jacket sown with diamonds, thick as
the stars of heaven—see him in a hopeless state of melancholy for the loss
of one poor fleece, and then oh, philosophers think what “a wonderful
piece of work is man ” A myriad sheep—his own sheep—bleat from his
own plains to the Prince—but the Prince is inconsolable—he has lost one
fleece Alas! in some shape or the other has not the highest as the
lowest—the most happy to the outward eyes of the world, as the most
miserable—have we not all of us, in some way or the other, “a mislaid
fleece : *
ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.
An unusually large number of Fellows (seven) being present, Mr. Leo
Rhinoceros took the chair:-
He begged to offer to the Society some few remarks relative to the
health of the animals in the Society's Gardens, in addition to the official
bulletin, suspended over the mantel piece. They would see from that
report that colds in the head were prevalent among the Monkeys, which
rendered it probable that Dover's powder and pocket-handkerchiefs would
form a large item in the expenditure of the current quarter.
The Elephant had suffered much during the severe weather from a
chapped proboscis, but the application of half-a-pound of the best rose lip-
salve, night and morning, had effected a perfect cure.
The Boa. Constrictor had quite recovered from the alarming attack
mentioned in the last report. The apoplectic symptoms, it was found,
resulted from the over-kindness of his keeper, who gave him a turkey on
Christmas-day instead of a moderate sized fowl, which formed his usual
meal. By prompt bleeding, the medical attendant succeeded in arresting
the disorder, and the aillmal was now in perfect health.
A Fellow wished to know who had the contract for supplying the animals
with win er clothing. He was led to ask this from hearing that some of
the animals had suffered much from cold. He had in his hand a prospectus
of a house in the Minories, where Taglionis and Monkey Jackets are
advertised at half price, and he thought the animals should be supplied
with every comfort consistent with economy. As he had not any further
remarks to offer, he would move an adjournment, as tea was ready.—
(Much applause, during which our reporter, who had devoured all the bis-
cuits, made his escape from the room).

(FINE ARTs.)
It is with no feeling of small delight, that we copy the subjoined from
the Gazette of last evening—delight to find a reward so justly contributed
upon, perhaps, the noblest and sublimest effort of man,—that of dissemi-
nating the softening influences of the fine arts throughout the habitable
globe ; and that for no professed personal benefit, save that which the
good and disinterested ever have, in despite of envy and of wrong. In
last night's Gazette, then, we find the following:—
“ Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to grant her permission to
F. G. Moon, Esq., patron of the fine arts. Threadneedle-street, London,
to wear the order of The Swayner and Smirk conferred upon him by
Don Miguel, late of Lisbon, but now of Rome, for Mr. Moon's magnifi-
cent works (painted by certain unknown R.A.'s)—of “The Mysterious
Watch,” and “The Box of Diamonds.”
When Mr. Moon's efforts to make known to foreign potentates the
claims of original painters, are duly considered, what so brief—or more,
so significant of the purpose than the motto which surrounds the order:
“ARs Est celare ARTEM | "
(“Art is to hide art.” Punch translates this for the benefit of Mr. Moon
himself.)
If we wanted new evidence of the extreme propriety of the motto,
should we not find it in the subjoined billet-doux forwarded to the Editor
of the Times by John Lucas, Esq., 3, St. John's-wood-road. The import
runs as follows:—
“Six,-Allow me to correct a mis-statement which appeared in a paragraph in your
columns of yesterday relative to the portraits which Her Majesty has recently presented
to the King of the French, and to inform you that the portrait of his Royal Highness
Prince Albert was painted by me, and not by Mr. Moon, that gentleman being simply
£onnected with the publication of the plate now in process of engraving by Mr. Samuel
Cousins, A.R.A.”
We are informed that Mr. Moon (of whom Punch, for the present,
takes farewell, believing that Mr. M. will never forget Punch), with the
feeling of a highly honourable and sensitive mind, that rejects the reputa-
tion due to another, had himself written a letter to the Times to the above
effect; but that through some accident (servants are so forgetful ') Mr.
Moon's footman had neglected to put it in the post.
ROYAL NURSERY CIRCULAR.
The Prince of Wales was safely delivered of a tooth one day last week,
when Sir Charles Ross, the miniature-painter, received instructions for
drawing it.
Prince Albert walked for some time on the Slopes; but it is not true
that he has been upon the decline since his arrival at Windsor. When
descending the Slopes, he is, of course, to a certain extent, going down
hill, which may account for the rumour.
The Prince of Wales was rather fretful on Thursday last, and Black
Rod was ordered to be in attendance. The aid of Black Rod was, how-
ever, dispensed with.
The Princess's Royal clean pinafore was taken for an airing on the
horse usually occupied for similar purposes.
On the anniversary of the Queen's marriage an entertainment was given
in the royal nursery. Lollipops were laid for two, and in the evening
there was an exhibition of the magic lantern.
HOW TO GET UP A COLLECTION OF FAMILY PLATE.
Subscribe to several clubs, and as by the fact of becoming a member a
portion of all the property of the club becomes your own, do not wait for
that never-arriving day when a division will be made, but commence
removing your share whenever you can lay your hands on any part of it.
As chairs and tables are not particularly portable, pocket a spoon or a
fork when occasion offers, and a splendid collection of family plate will be
the speedy result of your industry. If you are found out before the
collection is complete, it will be rather awkward; but then see if you have
not a few friends to swear to your insanity—under which plea you may do
any body or any thing.

THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
CHAPTER VIII,-A FANCY-FAIR.
CHARITY, it is said, covereth a multitude of sins ; and when she
does so with a veil of costly manufacture, however delicate and trans-
parent its texture, the concealment is mucl. more effectual than if it
were a tarpaulin of the coarsest sackcloth. The Lacquers are per-
fectly aware of this, and consequently are never backward in eleemo-
synary offerings, provided always that the object be a fashionable
one, approved of by their set; and that their liberality be not hidden
under a bushel, but placarded in great thoroughfares, and proclaimed
to the world by the speaking-trumpet of ostentation.
Some little time back, in consequence of embarrassed funds,
the patronesses of the “Ladies'-babies'-bib-and-tucker-general-loan
association” determined upon holding a fancy fair for the benefit of
the institution ; and were fortunate enough not only to secure the
approving countenance of the Dowager Lady Floss to the undertak-
ing, but also to get a sermon preached in its favour by a pet parson
at a fashionable church. Our acquaintances were amongst the first
applied to for their support, which Mrs. Lacquer cheerfully promised,
saying, “that there was no labour in the world more gratifying than
that of alleviating the distresses of our fellow creatures; and that
this had been her principal aim in giving her daughters the first
education money could furnish.” And then the patronesses of the
association went away rejoicing, and proclaimed everywhere what
kind and benevolent people the Lacquers were. But we ourselves
had always been accustomed to look upon Mrs. Spangle Lacquer as
a gaudy French clock, with very inferior works, which might be seen
through the glass sides; and when we regarded the inward springs
that set the motives of her life in action, we found out, that unless
there had been a chance of her daughters' keeping a stall, or hav-
ing their productions lauded and chronicled in the columns of a
fashionable journal, the “Ladies'-babies'-bib-and-tucker-general-
loan-association” might have fallen to the ground with the greatest
pleasure in the world on the part of Mrs. Lacquer. But the fair was
expected to be fashionably attended—fashionable families gave it
their countenance—the very circumstance of young aristocratic
ladies lowering themselves to trade, and playing at shop-girls, was
fashionable—and very fashionable company were to be admitted the
first day at half-a-crown a piece for the mere privilege of entrance.
But that the noble objects of the institution might be universal, and
all allowed to contribute to their furtherance, common people were
allowed to pay a shilling, and come in on the last day, when some of
the articles began to hang on hand, and the more select visitors had
picked out what goods most captivated their fancy. What a blessed and
single-hearted feeling is the charity which manifests itself so openly
at fancy-fairs, and allows every one to exercise his benevolence 1
The Lacquers immediately set to work and made all sorts of fancy
articles; and what they did not make they bought at the bazaars,
and sent in under their names, which answered the purpose just as
well. First of all, as they had been taught drawing, they produced
an immense quantity of fire-screens, adorned with sketches of what
appeared to be aristocratic periwinkle and whelk shells, reposing on
shreds of pink and blue bird's-eye tobacco, intended, in the luxuriance
of their imaginations, for sea-weed ; over which were hovering vari-
ous unknown butterflies, with tinsel wings, most appropriately intro-
duced—the butterfly being, as everybody is aware, a marine insect
that resides at the bottom of the sea. Then their grocer was ordered
to send them various grape-jars, painted green, and furnished with
gilt knobs; and having bought a piece of gaudy chintz at a leading
upholsterer's, they cut out all the birds and flowers imprinted thereon,
and stuck them on the jars, which were subsequently varnished, and
called “Macao Vases.” Mrs. Lacquer was not very great in drawing
or painting, but she bought bundles of short straws at her bonnet-
maker's, and fixing them in circular frames of pasteboard, twisted
blue ribbon in and out, making them resemble Lilliputian hurdles;
and when the apparatus was complete, it was termed a spill-case, to
be sold, with similar ones, at a guinea the pair. And next a quan-
tity of trays of white wood, together with card-cases, envelope-boxes,
glove-containers, and many other contrivances of the same material,
were laid in from the fashionable stationer’s. These were intended
to be adorned with the transfer-work, and then what havoc began
Innumerable lithographs were immolated—all the table-covers in the
house were varnished, more or less; and the bottles were broken,
and corks left out, and contents all evaporated or dried. And the
Misses Lacquer themselves, for an entire week, had such very sticky
fingers, that the young men of fashion who had the entrée of the house,
and came to talk captivating nothings to the ladies, or hold their
skeins of silk whilst they were engaged in their fancy manufactures,
declared that shaking hands with them was one of the most delightful
sensations which they—the young men of fashion—had experienced
for some time. They were fairly detained for a minute in the
thrilling and adhesive grasp of the young ladies.
The Misses Lacquer did not do a great deal in the Berlin-wool
line—they pronounced it worn-out and too much followed by com-
mon people to create any more sensation. Possibly they might have
thought that it was a great deal of trouble with a very little effect—
but this by the way. But they performed some very curious feats of
sleight of hand, with a pack of perforated cards, torturing them into
sticking-plaster cases, and what-nots; and when their ingenuity
could devise no fresh shape to stitch them into, they turned their
attention to the perforations themselves, and pushed needles, followed
by trains of coloured floss silk, through the little round holes, which
they termed embroidering them.
At last their wares were completed, and sent in, to the great
exultation of Mrs. Lacquer, and equal admiration of the lady-com-
mittee, who unanimously declared that the Misses Lacquers' stall
would be the most attractive, and confer the greatest benefit upon
the treasury of the association—whose sole end was charity. But
those good Christians never gave a thought to the number of con-
sumptive heart-broken girls who were struggling for a slender live-
lihood—in many cases to support others besides themselves—by
manufacturing the very same kind of things offered at the fancy fair,
with the exception of their being better made and much cheaper
than the amateur articles. Or if they did once think about it, the
only feeling was in all probability one of vanity, in being able to
compete with regular manufacturers, without having been brought
up to labour. And of course the Honourable, Kensington Pump
would sooner wear a pair of gaudy braces painted upon velvet by the
fair hands of Miss Lacquer herself,
and exhibit them at water-parties, or other occasions on which he
had to take off his coat in public, than a pair of the samu kind orna-
mented by nobody knew who, and bought at a bazaar. How could
any one expect it would be otherwise; although a bewitching smile
of thanks was all the change he got for his five-pound note : And
young Fitzmoses also, who had all the inclination and none of the
ability to become a man about town, did not at all grumble at buying
a guinea pen-wiper for the purposes of charity; it was such a rare
chance, also, to get the opportunity of “chaffing ” the refined
daughters of the West End, whilst making the purchase, just as if
they had been common stall-keepers at the counters of the Pantheon
or Soho Bazaar. This was very pleasant and agreeable to all parties,
heightened by the good they felt they were doing in a benevolent
point of view. It was impossible to benefit every body, and although
every article that was sold took a crust from the board of some
industrious female artist, yet it swelled the treasury of the “Ladies'-
babies'-bib-and-tucker-general-loan-association,” and the various

and they had received the especial thanks of the committee for their
young ladies who kept the stalls were so much delighted with the
public exhibition of their own wares and attractions—so gratified
at the compliments paid to both by the gentlemen purchasers—
including even the officers who had so liberally allowed the band of
their regiment to play upon the occasion; but who, however, did not
buy a great many things—that they almost hoped the funds of the
society would get into an embarrassed state once more, that they
might again have the pleasure of assisting them.
And, finally, Mrs. Lacquer and her daughters, when all was over,
exertions, agreed there were many social virtues to be exercised by
all right-thinking and religious people, but that the greatest of these
was Charity.
FASHIONS FOR FEBRUARY,
Although Parliament has assembled, and the metropolis is rapidly
filling, no material alteration has taken place in bonnets at any of the
leading magasins des modes. We have seen one,
however, that presented some novelty, and a con-
siderable display of taste. It was composed of
black velvet, and over the top, which was more
than usually depressed, a blue cotton handker-
chief was negligently thrown, in lieu of trimming,
and fastened under the chin in a simple bow; the
curtain, of the same material with the bonnet, stood
out from the head at right angles, and the whole
had a very elegant and négligé appearance. Man-
ties, capotes, and pelisses are now greatly in vogue, but we recently
noticed a cape that was constructed of layers of list, falling round the
shoulders in a graceful semicircle, and gradually increasing in their sweep
till they reached the waist.

its appearance ; the whole forming a most recherché promenade ces-

compelled to walk and endure a demi-strangulation
at the end of a blue or bright red cord. Rolls

their making less noise, and thereby attracting no attention to a pretty

be the most fashionable this month is the chapeau de Billicock, -
more generally known under the name of Casquette

from under the band, which has the rare merit of
combining the utile et dulce. It consists of a narrow
piping, that can be taken in and out of the hat at 2
the volonté of the wearer, but when not placed in
the band, it is generally carried in the mouth,
where it has a very rich and classical effect.

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
A New Play was recently produced at Covent Garden Theatre, written,
we believe, expressly for the purpose of bringing forward a new candidate
for theatrical honours. It was entitled “Off, off with the Stranger;” and
we should say, from the loud and continued shouts and plaudits which fol-
lowed its conclusion, that it was perfectly successful.
It was edged with a bouillonne of black |
Qſìe ſºlomen ſºlarket.
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer has done extremely well in reducing
Exchequer Bills from two-pence to seven farthings, for it leaves the
farthing in the hands of the Commissioners for reducing the National
Debt; and as we only increase it by millions, our diminishing it by
farthings can have no material effect on this great source of our national
prosperity.
We have no opportunity of knowing what is going on in the Bauk
Parlour; but we peeped through the blinds, and saw a gentleman who
looked like the Governor, with a foot on each hob, and a blazing fire before
him. This looks like confidence, for if the Bank can take it easy, which
must be the case if the Governor can afford to go to sleep, the “rest”
must be increasing.
Money is going at the old rate, and we know a party who got rid of a
good deal last week at Crockford's, where the Greek actives commanded
a high rate of profit.

On Friday the 17th Feb. the Morning Herald had the gross effrontery
to insert the following paragraph as an extract from our inimitable
publication :-
“In consequence of the omission of Sir H. Pottinger's name from the 'vote of
thanks' on Tuesday night, the Marquis of Londonderry intends to move that by
way of reward he may substitute the name of Thomas for Henry, in order to illus-
trate his deeds by his designation. " He will then," the Marquis says, "be called Sir

It has been suggested that it is impossible to bring back the time that

SIR PETER LAURIE ON STAMMERING.
In the congenial columns of the Morning Post, our own Sir Peter takes
his stand as patron of one Mr. Hunt, of Regent-street, who cures all sorts of
stammering, making the stutterer converse “with the most perfect fluency
and ease to himself.” This is, doubtless, a great scientific triumph; but
oh, Mr. Hunt 1 how much more serviceable would be the achievement,
if-when certain folks begin to speak, especially upon wood-pavement-
you could instantaneously make them—hold their tongue.
In consequence of numerous complaints received from all parts of the country as to
the difficulty in procuring the Weekly Numbers of PUNCH, the Proprietors have
determined to print a STAMPED EDITION, (price 4d.) which may be sent free by
Post, commencing with Number LXXX. It will be Published every Thursday
Morning, and may be procured through any Newsman, or by direct application to the

payment must be enclosed. As only a sufficient number of copies to supply the demand
will be stamped, early application is particularly requested. The Publication of the

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPTert VIII.-A runeral-ºs's PALACE. – THE PRINCE OF
“Ws give Thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleased Thee to deliver
this our sister out of the miseries of this sinful world —”
Thus, in measured metallic note, spoke the curate of St. Martin's-
in-the-Fields—whilst the daughter Patty could have screamed in
anguish at the thanksgiving. A few more words—another and
another look—yet another—now the piling earth has hidden all—
and the forlorn creature stands alone in the world. The last few
moments have struck apart the last link that still held her to a beloved
object—and now indeed she feels it is in eternity. Two or three
women press about her—turn her from the grave—and, garrulously
kind, preach to her deaf ears that “all is for the best,” and that “to
mourn is a folly.”
All this I gathered from the gossips who brought back Patty to
her dreary, empty home. There, after brief and common consolation,
they quitted her—and there, for a time, the reader must leave the
stricken, meek-hearted feather-dresser.
Early the next morning, I found myself in the hands of Mr. Fla-
mingo. The slight disorder—in truth, more imaginary than real—I
had suffered in the round-house, had, in the eyes of the tradesman,
been amply remedied by Patty, and my owner turned me reverently
between his thumb and finger—and gazed and gazed at me as though,
for his especial profit only, I had dropt from the wing of an angel.
Great was the stir throughout the household of Flamingo—and
great the cause thereof. He had received an order from the palace
of St. James's : his very soul was plumed—for he should get off his
feathers.
This I heard and saw, and—I confess it—with the trepidation of
expectant vanity, beheld the feather-merchant make selection from
his stock. At length, with melting looks, and a short, self-compla-
cent sigh, he placed me—I was sure of it—as the crowning glory, the
feather of feathers, among my kind. I was to wave my snowy purity
in St. James's 1
And for this, thought I, was I drest—prepared by the lean fingers
of want in an unwholesome garret ! Alas! I have since felt—ay,
a thousand times—that if dim-eyed Vanity would but use the specta-
cles of truth, she would see blood on her satins—blood on her brocades
—blood on her lace—on every rich and glistening thread that hangs |
about her—blood. She would see herself a grim idol, worshipped by
the world's unjust necessities—and so beholding, would feel a quicker
throb of heart, a larger compassion for her forced idolaters.
“To the palace,” cried Flamingo to the hackney-coachman, sum-
ymoned to bear myself and companions on our glorious mission. “To
the palace,” cried the feather-merchant, with new lustre in his eyes,
harmony in his voice, and a delicious tingling of every nerve that
filled his whole anatomy with music. “To the palace,” were really
the words uttered by Flamingo; yet in very truth, he believed he
said—“To Paradise.”
Not that St. James's was terra incognita to Mr. Flamingo; a
Marco Polo's domain filled with golden dreams. Certainly not : Mr.
Flamingo knew exactly the number of steps composing that private
way to heaven, the back-staircase. He had smiled, and trembled,
and bowed and wriggled, and smirked and cringed his way to the
patronage of Queen Charlotte (of blessed memory). This exalting
truth Mr. Flamingo had several times tested; and that in a matter
peculiarly flattering to himself. For instance, a very fine cockatoo
had been thrown in to the tradesman among a lot of foreign feathers:
this cockatoo Mr. Flamingo submitted to the inspection of her
Majesty, who was graciously pleased to say to it “Pretty Poll.” On
another occasion, Flamingo took a Java tom-tit to the palace; which
bird was graciously permitted by the Queen to perch upon her little
finger, her Majesty still further condescending to cry—“Swee-e-e-t ſ”
These circumstances were at the time totally overlooked by the Court
historian ; but they are recorded, written in very fine round-hand, in
the “Flamingo Papers.”
I had scarcely been an hour in the Palace, ere my memory began
to fail me. Yes, all the previous scenes of my existence, that an hour
before lived most vividly in my recollection, began to fade and grow
dim, and take the mingled extravagance and obscurity of a dream.
Was it possible that I had ever been a thing of barter between a
savage and a sailor for pig-tail Could I have ever known a Jack

it possible that I could detect the odour of bilge-water Was there

such a haunt for human kind as the Minories And that old Jew—
surely he was a spectre—a part of night-mare His large-lipped,
globe-eyed daughter, too, she—with all her plumpness—was no more
substantial. And then, that dim garret in the alley—the death and
enduring innocence—the heaviness and misery of human days—the
suffering that made of mortal breath a wearying disease—all the
worst penalty of life—had I known and witnessed it ! Could it be
possible And was there really a Patty Butler looking with meek
face upon a frowning world, and smiling down misfortune into pity
I confess that—having delighted in the atmosphere of a palace for
scarcely an hour—all these realities seemed waning into visions of
a fevered sleep. It was only by a strong effort—by a determination to
analyse my past emotions—that I could convince myself of the exist-
ence of a world of wretchedness without—of want, and suffering, and
all the sad and wicked inequalities of human life. Sudden prosperity
ever mingles Lethe in its nectar.
I pass by moments of tumultuous anxiety—of hope, painful in its
sweet intensity—of the delirium of assured aggrandisement. It is
now the remnant of my former self that speaks, and, therefore, be
the utterance calm and philosophic.
It was my fate to be chosen one of the three plumes—be it
remembered, the middle and the noblest one—to nod above the baby
Prince of Wales, all royally slumbering in his royal cradle.
It was my destiny, in 1762, to commemorate the conquest and
bloodshed of 1345—to represent an ancestral plume whereof poor
John of Bohemia was plucked that he of the black mail might be
nobly feathered : yes, it was my happy duty to wave above Jch Dien
in 1762.
Ich Dien—“I serve.” Such is the Prince of Wales's motto; and
looking down upon the Princelet's face—upon his velvet chee-
brought into the world for the world's incense—viewing the fleshly idol
in its weak babyhood, I repeated for it “I serve 1° and then, in the
spirit of the future, asked—What Bacchus—Venus—or what
nobler deity
The Prince of Wales—a six weeks' youngling—sleeps, and Cere-
mony, with stinted breath, waits at the cradle. How glorious that
young one's destiny . . How moulded and marked — expressly
fashioned for the high delights of earth—the chosen one of millions
for millions' homage 1. The terrible beauty of a crown shall clasp
those baby temples—that rose-bud mouth shall speak the iron law-
that little pulpy hand shall hold the sceptre and the ball. But now,
asleep in the sweet mystery of babyhood, the little brain already busy
with the things that meet us at the vestibule of life—for even then
we are not alone, but surely have about us the hum and echo of the
coming world,—but now thus, and now upon a giddying throne
What grandeur—what intensity of bliss—what an almighty heritage
to be born to—to be sent upon this earth, accompanied by invisible
angels, to take possession of
The baby king cooes in his sleep, whilst a thousand spirits meet
upon the palace floor—sport in the palace air—hover about the
cradle—and with looks divine and loving as those that watched the

Splendid solitude of state—most desolate privilege of princes !
With this thought, I felt a strange compassion for the Prince of
Wales. All the glories of the palace seemed to vanish from about
me, and I looked down upon the sleeping creature whom I was there
to honour, with a deep pity, a sorrow for the rough and trying for-
tune he was born to.

The writer of these reminiscences had on one occasion the privilege of
dining with Widdecomb. The “great man” was in the habit, after re-
hearsal, of turning into the respectable eating-house at the foot of West-
minster Bridge, where he frequently took what happened to be “in the
best cut” just like an ordinary mortal. When the present writer had
the honour of dining with Widdecomb, the “great creature” sat in a box
facing the fire, while the humble recorder of these reminiscences occupied
a place near the window. “Soho,” said Widdecomb, mechanically reading
an announcement on the wall, “they have an ordinary at one here, have
they Aha!” he continued, with his well-known chuckle, looking signifi-
cantly at the clock, which was exactly two, “they have an ordinary at
one—and now” (loºking at himself in the glass) “now they've got an
extra-ordinary at two.” I ventured to laugh at the “great creature's
wit,” which led to a little conversation, terminating in an intimacy which
will probably last during the life of the present writer, but as nothing
sublunary is immortal, it can hardly continue to the end of the days of
Widdecomb.
On another occasion the writer of these memoirs found the illustrious
| man at dinner, when there was a plate of underdone beef before him. “Soho"
cried the “great creature;” “is this the way they treatme—me, Methuselah
Walter'Thomas Widdecomb?” Upon this the waiter came forward respect-
fully to know the “great creature's" pleasure. “Roast beef,” said Wilde-
comb, drawing himself up to his full height, and stretching out his mouth to
its full width, “Roast beef, and where is the equestrian radish I, Methu.
selah Walter Thomas Widdecomb, be palmed off with a bit of beef, and
no horse-radish ' " The waiter hurried away and instantly returned with
the savoury root, which Widdecomb devoured with his usual relish.
As I left the room arm-in-arm with the “great creature,” the waiter
maliciously called out down the pipe communicating with the kitchen,
“Two of greens,” as we left the premises.
A NEW TORMENT FOR SINNERS.
A New and improved edition of Dante's Commedia is about to be pub-
lished, and in which the celebrated inscription over the infernal gates—
“Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch' entrate,”—
“leave all hope, ye who enter here,” will be replaced by—
“ Voi ch' entrate, legete l’Araldo Matutino,”
which means, (we translate for the benefit of the proprietors,)
“YE who ENTER HERE, MUST READ “THE MoRNING HERALD.’”
MATRIMontal ON DIT.-We beg to state that there is no truth what-
ever in the report that the noble lion of the Lyceum Theatre will shortly
lead to the hymeneal altar the beautiful Bengal tigress of the Surrey

PUNCH*S PARLIAMENT.
A petition was presented from Laura Honey, praying that she might be relieved
from the penalty of 50l., in which she had been cast by the Liverpool Inagistrates, for
having, against the law, acted in an unlicensed theatre, called the Liver.—Murning Paper.
Colonel SIBThon PE presented the petition. He was—it was well
known—an advocate for vested rights. (Hear 1) Nevertheless,
when the great services of the fair petitioner towards the drama of
the country (laughter) were duly considered, he felt assured that she
ought to be permitted to break the law with every possible impunity.
(Ironical cheers.) The services of that lady towards the legitimate
drama were well known. (Screams of laughter.) Honourable gentle-
men might laugh ; but he himself had seen her in white gauze and
carnation-coloured silk stockings acting Lurline in—if he remembered
rightly—The Spirit of the Rhine. He had also seen her “bathing and
sporting” at the Adelphi, with great pleasure; and he called upon
the members, as law-makers, nay, as men—to interpose between
Laura Honey and the tyranny of the proprietors of the Royal
Theatre, who, protecting their own property, as under the law
guaranteed to them, had caused much uneasiness to the fascinating
syren (Cries of Oh I Oh!) whose petition— (Here the gallant Member's
speech was lost in the roars of the House.) There had also been penalties
recovered against other actors. Mr. Buckstone (laughter) had played
at the Liver; Mrs. Fitzwilliam had also played there. Both of these
distinguished artists had been fined (Cries of “Serre 'em right.”)
The gallant Colonel concluded by asking if such a course of things
was to continue ! -
Sir Rob Eat PEEL said he could not silently suffer the presentation
of any such petition. It was only in the Times of that morning that
he had read a police report, in which one Laura Lightly had been
committed by a magistrate for illegally pawning a pair of silver tea-
tongs from her lodgings. Now, if the petition of Laura Honey—who
had been punished for acting against the law—were to be entertained,
why not also the petition of her namesake? In the eye of the law
º: y- no difference between illegal acting and illegal pawning.
(Hear.
Viscount MAHoN protested against any such law ; nevertheless,
whilst it did exist, it must be respected. (Hear.) The Patent
Theatre paid a large rent for an exclusive privilege; throw the privi-
lege open (hear), and that rent must of course come down. It
would be in the recollection of the House that he had last Session
agitated this subject. (Hear.) He was happy to say that he had
prepared a bill upon the matter—a bill that had occupied his undi-
vided attention during the whole period of the recess—a bill for
which he should claim the advocacy of the Right Hon. Baronet at
the head of the Home Department.
Sir JAMEs GRAHAM expressed himself as only too happy to assist
the noble Viscount in any manner that could tend to the elevation
of the stage. He trusted that the House would give her Majesty's
Ministers credit for the deepest and strongest feelings towards the
true glory of the theatre : feelings that were shared by Royalty
itself; as was evident in the frequent state visits of her Majesty
(laughter) to the temples of the Drama. As a further illustration of
the anxiety with which Ministers contemplated the progress of a
glorious art, and considered the claims of its most distinguished pro-
fessors, he could not abstain from informing the house, that the
Right Hon. Baronet at the head of the Government had that very
day placed the name of Mr. Sheridan Knowles on the civil list, for a
pension of 200l. per annum. (Loud and continued cheers greeted this
announcement. In the tumult, Laura Honey's petition was received and
ordered to lie under the table.)

96 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Punch,” with his usual liberality, has engaged a gentleman of
undoubted veracity to collect the Country News exclusively for
this Publication, which may be always confidently depended on
for the accuracy of its recorded facts.
The gentleman who has undertaken this department will be con-
stantly travelling from place to place; and, indeed, such arrange-
ments have been entered into, that the reporter will never lie in the
same town two consecutive nights.
Wherever a paragraph has been copied from the provincial press,
it will be immediately and candidly acknowledged, and the name of
the paper subjoined.
As country editors are prone to select jokes, &c. from “ PUNch,” it
is suggested that this will prove a fair mode of balancing the account.
The annexed motto will precede
PUNCH's ProvincIAL INTELLIGENCE.
“This is all as true as it is strange;
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of the reckoning.”-SHAkspeaRE.
And, moreover, to prevent fraud, or the possibility of deception,
the articles will invariably be signed VERAx.
Spalding.
For the last ten years there has been a gradual increase of an epidemic disorder
among the fen geese, which is conjectured by an eminent naturalist of this town
to be occasioned by some material alteration in the habits of the geese; for
since the extensive use of steel pens, which have almost superseded the
employment of quills, it has not been
deemed necessary to pluck the geese
twice during the year.
The geese, unaccustomed to this treat-
ment, are therefore pining away for the %.
want of their customary half-yearly ex-
citement.—Lincoln Mercury.

ARRived.—The George IV., from New Orleans, having made the passage in
eight days.
This is the shortest period that has ever occurred in a voyage from America;
perhaps it is to be attributed to the ship being laden with a very light cargo—
viz., Stock of the American funds, feathers, and soda-water.
Iseamington.
A very curious hydraulic machine has been lately constructed here, from the
design and under the direction of Mr. Manby, Civil Engineer. It is of the
nature of a pump; but it is
so ingeniously contrived, that
any one, at any hour of the
day or night, can help himself
to a glass of mixed brandy and
water, either cold or hot.
The machine is considered
a great convenience in Lea-
mington, which is now no
longer merely a “Watering-
Place,” but a “Brandy-and-
Watering” Place. We have
no doubt that this rare novelty
will attract numerous visitors.

Newmarket.
The Race-course, which has been the resort of the sporting world for so many
years, has been purchased by the celebrated Mr. Gully, who purposes laying it
out as a model farm. Several hundred acres have been recently plantcd with
Mangle Wurzel; a great part of the late course is covered with self-sown wild
oats, and a sufficient portion is reserved for hemp-seed.—Cambridge Intelli-
gencer.
Colchester.
From the operation of the new Tariff, we are happy to state that the pro-
duce of the oyster-beds on the river Colne has
been increased nearly ten-fold. At Pyfleet

bivalves have been recently discovercd. We
take this opportunity to congratulate our
readers on the decided efficacy of the admirable
measures of Sir Robert Peel.—East Esser
Advertiser.

From the prevalence of the late severe westerly gales, the Chain-Pier has been
removed to about a quarter of a mile below Kemp-Town. This remarkable
occurrence has for the present delayed the prosecution of the plan for boring the
Artesian well under the bottom of the sea, and forming the much-desired jet
d'eau at the end of the Pier.—Brighton Herald.
Salisbury Plain.
The new town is progressing with great rapidity on Salisbury Plain; the Church,
dedicated to St. Peter, is nearly completed. Kennet-street, branching from the
Parade, is half a mile in length, and has, in its various orders of architecture,
very much the appearance of Regent-street, London.
From the top of Chippenham-street a very imposing view is obtained of Stone-
henge, which is now converted into a bazaar, and is the fashionable promenade.
The houses have generally been let as soon as finished; but there are several
commodious family residences to be dis- -
posed of in Druid-square.
The Zoological Gardens are laid out

The Weathen.—The late mild and congenial weather has had a remarkable
effect on the vegetation in this neighbourhood. Moss
roses are in full bloom in the garden of Mr. Lup-
pino; pelargoniums have blossomed in the open air;
and on Tuesday last green peas of excellent quality
were gathered in the grounds of Mr. T. Smith,
whose great American Aloe has flowered for the first
time these.hundred years.

PEARLS OF PARLIAMENT.
OUR representatives—for surely Punch has always had a voice in
Parliament—have not let fall many jewels since our last. Well,
even the girl who was especially made to drop rubies and diamonds
did, we doubt not, at times talk glass beads instead ; and therefore,
let us now and then be charitable towards the wisdom of Parliament.
Two or three matters have come to the
knowledge of Punch—matters which will de-
light the reader. In the first place, Sir Ronent
PEEL has ordered a complete suit of chain
armour, which he will wear under his super-
Saxony on those nights when the Minister ex-
pects to be addressed by Mr. Cobden. This
precaution will, no doubt, conduce to the tran-
quillity of the Minister, by making him bullet-
proof. As for Mr. Cobden, there is a private
order that Black-Rod shall every night search
his toothpick-case, lest pistols should be se-
creted there.
Mr. Roebuck—who, in a political sense, may be considered as
Lord BRough AM's seven-months' baby—has,
since our last, delivered nothing “private and
confidential” to the Commons. This is the
more handsome of him, as we know that once,
“in the Library of the House,” Joseph HuME,
being short of silver, borrowed “confidential-
ly” sixteen-pence to pay his cab-hire to Bryan-
stone-square; yet, up to the present time, this
fact Mr. Roebuck has magnanimously kept
from the knowledge of Parliament

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
99
There was a trifle doing in the Lords on the question of thanks to
Lord ELLENBorough and the Indian Army. His Lordship spoke of
the vipers of the press, who had endeavoured to kill the fair fame of
the Governor-General—of “superannuated vipers, that had the bag
of venom, but not the perforated tooth through which to squirt it.”
This is a subject upon which no pen can dispute with his Lordship :
in the matter of “vipers” and “venom.” Brough AM may be bowed
to as a Professor. His Lordship, however, went further. As to the
proclamation touching the Gates of Somnauth :—
“It implied no countenance shown to Hindooism by the Governor-General, than whom
a more pious Christian did not exist. He never dreamt of showing a preference to
Hindooi above Mah 4---- or to Mah 4--f He (Lord
Brougham) would undertake to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of every charitable and
calm disposition, that the words did not bear the construction which had been put upon
them.”
Did Punch ever doubt his own Brough AM in any such matter?
Knows he not well that his own dear Harry would, for the nonce, not
only prove ELLENBoRoush the most pious of Christians, but in the
true philosophy of the bar “for a consideration” show him to be either
Hindoo or Mussulman–Methodist or Mormonite—Quaker or Shaker?
We believe, however, it was by the significant recommendation of
this “most pious Christian,” that 15,000 souls were driven from the
city of Istalif to perish in the snow—the city being consumed to
ashes. It was also a touch of this Christian's piety, that—when victory
was achieved, and the people had surrendered—made the city of
Jellalabad “only the abode of jackalls.” But never mind that : as
the Poet sings—“it was a famous victory.”
However, to leave the horrors of war for the discomfort of English
peers. Their Lordships are very uneasy in their present herth, and
have begun to ask “When will our new lodging be finished What
is Mr. BARRY about?” Lord Duncannon said—
“Eight years had now elapsed since the two houses were consumed, and their Lord-

into the subject.” In his opinion, a committee ought to be appointed to inquire

“All light cut off!” How terrible to think that, even for once,
the House of Lords should legislate in the dark Why do not their
Lordships rent Covent Garden Theatre, and make the house really a
place of national amusement 1
The motion of blunt, out-speaking Thomas Duncombe for inquiry
into Lord ABINGER's conduct on the special commissions of Lancaster
and Chester, has only proved the near affinity of Whigs and Tories—
the common cause they make together when the rights and privileges
of the people are really at issue. His Lordship, it is well known is
troubled with charta-phobia ; and on the judgment-seat gave terrible
evidence of his rabid condition ; “shaking his fist,” says Mr. Dux.
coxae, “at the prisoners,” having previously grafted a political
homily upon his charge to the jury. Some of these men, confined in
Knutsford Gaol, were sent
upon the wheel three days
a-week.
“They were taken out to the tread-
inill on Wednesday afternoon, and on
the following morning, contrary to
custom, they were again brought out
to tread the wheel for the amusement
of several ladies and gentlemen who
were anxious to see the sport. (Hear.)
MR. DuNcombe's motion was vigorously opposed by Whigs and
Tories. Lord John Russell explained away any seeming asperities
on the part of the benevolent Lord AB INGER ; whilst Mr. THEsigen
deposed to the softness of the Judge “when the awful duty devolved
upon him of passing the last sentence of the law.” And then his
“private life” was so good—his “disposition” so “affectionate,” that
it was impossible he could be swayed by political motives | We
never knew a political tyrant, who—when
his feet were on his own hearth-rug—had
not a heart of butter and words of milk. It
matters not what he does in his public life,
if-when returning home—he chuckshis wife
under the chin, and feeds her parrot with
toast and butter.
Mr. WALLAce sprinkled a little farce in the debate.
“He would tell the house that since Lord AB INGER's appearance on that commission
special commissions were held in detestation and contempt. He had endeavoured to
show to some Scotch friends that the conduct of Lord A BING E R was the exception and
not the rule Nothing showed greater abuse than the Scotch criminal courts;
the prisoners were all ready "cat and dried for condemnation (laughter). There were
not more than two or three lawyers in a court, and these were mere “spoons,’ (loud
laughter).
We are bound to believe Mr. Wallace in the matter of “spoons;”
but if Punch may touch upon his own experience, he must say that
he has generally found lawyers not “spoons,” but—tweezers.
Sir JAMEs GRAHAM—bold-faced turncoat as he is—spoke out for
turncoat ScaRLEtt. Sir JAMEs drew a touching picture of the
public and private virtues of the Judge—of his venerable age, his
wisdom, his elevated position, &c. &c. &c. Whereupon, Tom DUN-
combe took back Sir JAMEs to Cockermouth, where—
“In 1831, after the first Reform Bill, addressing the electors of Cumberland, Sir JAMrs
had said—“I have asked who represented this town. Nobody but the returning officer
could inform me.” (A laugh.) [A voice in the crowd, “Scarlett!”] ‘ I regret to hear him
named in that way, for he was once my friend.” I am glad (added the hon. member)
that the Right Hon. Baronet has recovered his friendship.” (Laughter, and ironical
cheers.) ‘The ex-Attorney General, a recreant Whig,’’ (loud laughter, and cries of
* Hear, hear!") “the follower of Fox, the nominee of Earl Fitzwilliam, honoured and
respected till he waged war with the press, he has been obliged to fly from the indignation
of the people to take refuge in Cockermouth (laughter), under the wing of Lord Lons-
dale, creeping into the House of Commons through a postern gate, of which a Rev. gem-
tleman now on the hustings holds the key. (Loud laughter.) He has skulked from the
offended majesty of the people.” (Renewed laughter.) [A voice in the crowd, “How do
#. like that, my Lord?'-laughter.] "And (exclaimed Tom Duncom a E, addressing
imself to Sir J. GRAHAM,)—and I say, 'how do you like that?” (Roars of laughter.)”

METROPOLIS IMPROVEMENTS.
-
A body of gentlemen meet now and then to discuss this delightful
subject; and at one of the recent réunions, a Mr. Martin got positively
pathetic about having devoted a long and arduous life to the sewers and
cesspools of his native city. Fourteen long years had he laboured to
enlarge the subterranean ways and watercourses of the modern Babylon;
and it is evident that he will not die happy until the filth of London is
floating—at twopence a ton—over the heath of Bagshot. Mr. Martin
was affected almost to tears when he talked of his exertions to carry the
manure of the metropolis to the suburbs; and his ambitious desire to con-
struct a terrace all along the banks of the Thames is a beautiful illustration
of the force of the imagination, which, in the pursuit of a cherished
object, forgets the existence of thc wharf, the necessity for selling coals
from a barge, the propriety of allowing commerce still to exist, and the
vested interests of the ordinary coal-heaver.
Mr. Martin would have the banks of the Thames a series of terraces,
the houses palaces, and the sewers laboratories for the practice of
chemistry. This is all very well in theory, but to our own eye (saying
nothing of Martin) it seems rather difficult to be put in practice.
“The rose by any other name would smell as sweet ; ” and however fine
the appellation we might give to it, we fear that it will require an ex-
traordinary zeal for science to find charms in sewers and cesspools.
If Mr. Martin can only die happy on condition of carrying out his ideas
about the Thames and its contents, we must of necessity predict what we
should very sincerely regret—a miserable termination to his existence 1
THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
CHAPTER IX.-MRS. SPANGLE LACQUER'S COUNTRY CONNEXION.
A sist ER of Mrs. Lacquer’s married a gentleman of property, and
resides in the country. Her name is Mrs. Champignon Stiff back, which
betrays the foreign origin of her husband, although he is himself an En-
glishman. They are tolerable specimens of high rural gentility, and,
in company with their London relatives, partake largely of the nature
of mushrooms, inasmuch as they have not only sprung up with great
rapidity to their present elevation, but have also risen from mould of
questionable delicacy. But now they have no more to do with their
former position than has the white button in the pottle of the West-
End fruiterer with the impure soil from which it drew its vitality.
The Stiffbacks reside in a village about two or three miles from a
country town, which they make their metropolis. They visit Loudou
occasionally during the season, when they usually stay with the
Lacquers, and pick up a few fresh notions to astonish the rustics.
But beyond this they are not very fond of town. They perceive they
are not there of sufficient importance, and they prefer being the
storks amongst an assembly of rural frogs, to the unheeded nobodies

of a great city. Not, however, that they are always perfectly at their
ease in the country; for their position is somewhat uncomfortably
poised between the real county aristocracy and the petty agricultural
gentilities, belonging to neither, and occasionally looked shy at by
both. And since they are in perpetual fear of losing caste in the
frigid respectability of these districts, by an unlucky acquaintance
or an unfortunate slight, their existence is a continuous scene of
anxious manoeuvring and finesse; making strict search into the origin
and position of all people taking houses in their vicinity, whom they
hang off from calling upon, until they have ascertained who and
what their new neighbours are. And in country visiting, it is abso-
lutely necessary to find out all those ladies and gentlemen who do
not meet each other, either from natural antipathy, touchy disposi-
tion, or fancied difference of rank; by means of which knowledge
alone rural dinner-parties can be satisfactorily arranged, to the equal
comfort of the host or hostess and their visitors, who would other-
wise be obliged to sit looking at each other, like fighting cats, across
the table. And this cautious manner of proceeding gives an impetus
to country visiting, instead of restraining it. For example, the A.'s
have a party, and ask the B.'s and C.'s. The B.'s next invite the other
two families, and then the C.'s ask the A.’s and B.'s in company with
the D.'s. And finally, the last-named persons return the hospitality
of the C.'s, excluding, of course, the others; but asking the E.'s and
F.'s in their places, to show that they can command quite as good a
circle of society.
As with their relatives in town, the Stiffbacks make religion the
principal medium for exhibiting their gentility to the eyes of the
world. But it is obliged to be managed in a different manner, since in
a country village there is no fashionable church wherein to blazon
forth plumes and cachmeres to a patrician audience—for audience is
in this case a far more natural word than congregation. The
humble fane receives alike the peasant and the aristocrat ; and the
preacher must make his discourse equally intelligible to both, instead
of seeking by theatrical declamation and high-flown language to
secure the affections of the higher class alone—the chief object of
the London Pet Parson. And so, as distinction is not to be obtained
by attending church, the Stiffbacks belong to what is termed a
“District Society,” for visiting the poor at their own houses. This
is not for the purpose of distributing beef and blankets to the hungry
and naked, but for the far more laudable design of consoling the
sick and starving with a tract

which they are requested to read, keep clean, and then return. And
conjoined to this society Mrs. Stiffback, in company with some other
ladies, has established a private Sunday-school, wherein some fifteen
or twenty fidgety children study “Reading made Uneasy” in a hot,
ill-ventilated room on fine summer afternoons, and sing hymns that
would drive even Hullah mad—in which they evince their gratitude
to their benefactors by frequent yawns and shuffles, and longing
glances at the waving trees and green pastures about the school-
house. The ladies take it in turns to become governesses, and all
appear to find great delight in the occupation, except Mrs. Heartly,
who was profane enough one afternoon to give all the children tea
and cake, instead of affording the usual hebdomadal aliment to their
minds—a proceeding which drew down upon her the indignation of
every pious and well-regulated individual in the village, including of
course Mrs. Stiffback at the head of them, until she found that Mrs.
Heartly was on visiting terms in London with Mrs. Spangle Lacquer
—of whom the Stiffbacks think a great deal—when she immediately
pronounced it a very charitable and thoughtful benefaction.
Indeed, it was at Mrs. Heartly’s instance alone that Mrs. Stifflack
refrained from paying a visit to Widow Hopkins, whither she
intended to go and lecture the poor woman upon the impropriety of
her allowing her children to have themeasles, and actually staying away
from church one Sunday to attend upon them, when the infant was
also taken ill. Not, however, that Mrs. Stiffback felt much affection
for Mrs. Heartly in reality, nor did any of her friends; for whilst they
themselves were in the habit of dressing more expensively than
others in the village—in fact, visited London almost expressly for
the purpose of bringing down the newest fashions—still the Heartlys
were upon most intimate terms with many of the county families, who
only received Mrs. Stiffback and her party with the formality of
cold politeness. And this was the more remarkable, because
although the Heartlys were really well-born, yet their income was
somewhat limited ; and both mother and daughters went about in
common whittles and straw-bonnets, which Mrs. Stiff back would
scarcely have allowed her nursery-maid to wear—certainly not her
governess. But after all, the Heartlys were very peculiar in
their habits.
Mr. Stiffback may be briefly described as one of that large body of
partenus who have lost the civility of the tradesman, without acquiring
the manners of the gentleman. He walks about the village as if
every pebble and blade of grass was under subjection to him, and is
courteous to no one—being pompous even to his equals, and taking no
notice of his superiors—possibly for the simple reason that they are
not particularly attentive to him. He makes the village coach take
him round to his own door—why, it is difficult to determine, for he
pays on more than anybody else; but he thinks this gives him con-
sequence, and so he enforces it.
Independent of those in that sphere of visiting which they are
pleased to term their own, the Stiffbacks court the professional society
of the village. The clergyman of course comes first ; and he is at all
times most polite to his entertainers, because they always head the
coal and missionary subscriptions, and are indefatigable in collecting
penny-pieces for the conversion of anonymous savages living in un-
known islands. Besides, Mr. Stiff back had the weathercock of the
church re-gilt at his own expense. Then comes the medical man,
and then the lawyer. This last gentleman believes himself to be the
link between the upper and lower orders in the neighbourhood; but
as his clients contain some of either class, he is necessarily obliged to
be polite to both, and give occasional dinners; but these dinners are
always in sets of graduated distinction. And although he sometimes
appears to slight his less important connexions, yet they do not take
much notice of it; for they are aware that he goes into better society
than they do—that if they offended him the others would still receive
him ; and so, for the sake of scratching together a little important
society, they pocket all sorts of affronts, which would be revenged
upon an equal or inferior with unmitigated severity.
THE HUMANE SOCIETY.
This excellent society, directly the frost set in, went to work with their
usual activity to provide for the public safety. The first measure was to
set the society's men to work, breaking the ice all round the sides of the
various pieces of water, so that any one relying on the strength of the ice
would probably get a ducking at the outset, and thus give to the society
the merit of having “saved” such individuals as may have fallen in, under
the very humane arrangements of the excellent body alluded to.
Among the other “admirable arrangements” is the throwing of lines all
across the ice for skaters and others to tumble over them, to say nothing
of the splendid idea of making a large hole, and sticking up a pole in the
middle of it, surmounted with the word “Dangerous.” There is no doubt
that the society means uncommonly well; but when the board next meets
we should like to suggest that the humane character of the association
might be just as well preserved by confining its objects to assisting those
who have got into the water, instead of extending its benevolence to break-
ing the ice for the mere love of aiding in cases of accident.

PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
chapter Wiii.-PArticularly respecting JUNO.
THE name of Juno has been borne by several individuals, of
whom, however, only one was a goddess; the rest were principally
pointers. Why a dog should be called Juno, let the sponsors of the
animal inform us; perhaps the reason is that Juno is a good name,
a matter of vital consequence to a dog.
The early history of Juno, like most early histories, is little known;
but what little of it is known, like what little is known of early
histories in general, is a good deal to swallow.
Juno, it is said, was devoured by her father, Saturn, at one of those
family meals in which he would occasionally indulge. Providen-
tially, he had not had her scolloped or otherwise cooked, but had
gulped her down au naturel, with nothing but a little vinegar and
pepper. The divinity of her nature
preserved her so long in his interior
that she at last began to disagree
with him; and gave him, in short,
such a fit of indigestion, that he was
forced to seek medical advice. He
was recommended to take one pound
of powder of ipecacuanha (the ave-
rage dose for a god) in a pint of
warm water, and to read as much
as might be necessary of the last
fashionable novel. The prescription
was effective; and Juno, arising from
her living tomb, was restored to the
embrace of Ops. This is a good enough
story to tell; but it is doubtful whether
Juno was ever really eaten up, except
with pride and jealousy.
Some say that Juno was a native of
Samos, others that she was by birth an
Argive ; but, according to the most --- \lº º
learned, she was as probably born at ~\º
Jericho. It has been stated that she ----ºw
was intrusted, during her infancy, to
the care of the Seasons. This, how-
ever, is possibly a mistake; the Juno
who was intrusted to the care of the
Seasons may have been Juno a cele-
brated filly, turned out, in her younger
days, to grass. The Seasons teach vege-
tation, not the young idea, to shoot;
though Spring gives lessons in the art
of self-defence. The mythologists,
nevertheless, do not say that he taught
Pollux.
Juno, before her marriage with Ju-
piter, seems to have led a quiet life:
but afterwards she led, or at all events led her husband, any-
thing but that. Jupiter, to be sure, was orthodox in respect of his
drink; but his domestic arrangements, as we have seen, were de-
cidedly Mahometan. Now, Juno had two strong reasons for disap-
proving of them : one was a natural desire of having a heart to
herself, the other a conviction that she comprised in her own person
all that was lovely and amiable. Will any young lady say that such
feelings were otherwise than natural Slighted affection and wounded
pride are apt to ruffle the temper (when unphilosophical); no
wonder then that Juno, on special provocation, would allow herself
to get rather warm, and sometimes to forget herself as a goddess.
Ladies who have brutes of husbands should treat them with the
scorn they deserve, and smother their own passions, which, if indulged,
often bring unpleasantness on themselves. Of this truth we have an
example in Juno. Jupiter had a favourite wife named Alcmena. Of
course Juno persecuted her with all her might; but not content with
that, she endeavoured to be revenged upon her offspring. Alcmena
had an infant, a fine strong little fellow, about eight months old;
his name was Hercules : he grew up afterwards to be the greatest
hero that ever lived, next to Jack the Giant Killer. This flower of
chivalry, being in his nursery, Juno tried to nip in the bud. In
this attempt she failed, and then, by all the means in her power,
she strove to cut him off in his bloom. At last she so exasperated
Jupiter, that one day, in a fit of passion, he exclaimed, “Hang her 1”
and Strength and Force, the ministers of his vengeance, did hang
her. They suspended her from a hook (some say, with one) by a
golden chain, with a couple of hundred-weights at her heels. Per-
haps Jupiter wanted to try whether, in spite of her divinity, he could
not kill her; and yet for that purpose a good rope would have been
better than a gold chain, which could only be fit to hang a watch by.
But his intention may have been to hang her by the neck till she
was better, not till she was dead. Whichever it was, it was frus-
trated by Vulcan, who went and cut his mother down before either
the vital spark or fire of disposition was extinct. For this, Vulcan,
in the phraseology of the schools, “caught it.” Jupiter had threat-
ened that whosoever should interfere between himself and his Queen,
should experience his divine toe, and he was as good as his word, for
he kicked Vulcan out of heaven. He sent him flying, like a football,
with one kick, to the no small amusement of the other gods; but the
joke was no joke to Vulcan, who was nine days in falling to the
earth, and broke his leg when he came down.
But why, if Juno was so unhappy with her husband, did she not

leave him She did once; his polygamous principles had so disgusted
her, that she packed up her things and ran away. But then Jupiter,
either discovering what a treasure he had lost, or missing his accus-
tomed exercise with the rope's end, would needs have her back again.
So he went to the original of Madame Tussaud's exhibition, whence
he borrowed the prototype of Mary, Queen of Scots; and placing the
dummy by his side in his chariot, he drove through the air to Euboea,
where he understood that his wife had taken lodgings. He had pre:
viously sent on Fame by the flying-post, to noise and trumpet abroad
that he was going to marry once more; his intended being a beauti-
ful and accomplished young lady, named Plataea, with whom he
would shortly arrive. This appeared to Juno to be adding insult to
injury; she flew to meet the chariot, and springing into it with a
bound, went at the eyes and face of her supposed rival like a tigress.
Finding that she had dug her nails into nothing but wax, she could
not help bursting out laughing, and Jupiter having thus entrapped
her into a good humour, persuaded her to return home. He was a
shocking humbug—that Jupiter | - - -
Juno, after her husband had tried to hang her, (whether his object

it, she endeavoured to dethrone and lock him up. However, he soon
quelled the insurrection which she had raised against him. He

—TN—
summoned Briareus, a tremendous giant with a hundred arms, to his
aid, and the monster frightened the insurgents by a mere show of
hands; though perhaps, to ensure success, he also grinned and roared
a little.
Juno, much as she had to put up with in other respects, was yet
treated liberally by Jupiter. He gave her a state carriage, more
elegant and considerably lighter than our gracious sovereign's. It
appeared like the work of some cunning glass-blower; its colours were
the prismatic, and its wheels flashed and sparkled as if with young.
ladies' eyes, so that they were more luminous than Catherine-wheels.
This turn-out, which was something more than tidy, was horsed, as
an ornament of Trinity College (Dublin) has expressed it, with
peacocks. Peacocks were Juno's favourite birds; though some
believe that she preferred snipes. Jupiter also made her a present of
a remarkably handsome throne; it looked as if of gold, wrought
with flowers and foliage, and enamelled and inlaid with gems. It
had air cushions, was mounted upon azure and vermilion clouds,
and went on mother-o'-pearl-like castors. Altogether it was a
splendid property. The goddess only used it on state occa-
sions. She then appeared in a reclining posture, arrayed in the
first style of fashion; her diadem blazing with jewels on her brow,
and her sceptre reposing on her left arm, with a cuckoo perched on
the top of it. Her other pets, the peacocks, displayed beside her
their magnificent tails, and behind her stood her attendant, the
beautiful Iris, canopied by the rainbow, with wings and a dress to
match. (Had this Number of PUNCH but been published earlier,
what a picture we might look forward to at the approaching
exhibition 1)
The beauty of Juno was heavenly, of course; its earthly parallel
might be found in a Sultana, or perhaps in another great eastern
lady—a Lady Mayoress. In character it partook of the imperious;
the nostrils were perpetually elevated, and the lips in a continual
pout. She was called “cow-eyed; ” either because her eyes were
large and prominent like a cow's, or to distinguish her from Venus,
who was celebrated for sheep's eyes. The Greeks gave her a Grecian
nose, the Romans a Roman nose; but both attributed to her a good
nose—for incense. She was, or might have been, sometimes repre-
sented with a double chin.
In stature Juno stood high ; as she also stood in her own opinion.
No doubt, she had a large bump of self-esteem : besides various
other bumps which she received at the hands of Jupiter.
It is customary in some parts of the country, when married folks
quarrel, to serenade them with rough music. This would have been
an appropriate kind of worship for their Majesties of Olympus; but
we are nowhere informed that they received it. With respect to
their disagreements, they were both, to a certain extent, in the wrong,
but Jupiter the most ; and he who would lift his hand against a de-
fenceless female is unworthy the name of a British sailor, much
less that of a god.

Til E BELLE SAUWAGE.
HERE is scarcely an inn
about London or the vici-
nity that has not a legend
attached to it; for where
facts will not come to the
aid of the old chroniclers,
they draw upon the only
bank where they were ever
known to keep a deposit—
the bank of fiction. Stowe
was the first who tried to
in a legend on to the Belle
§º: and Camden has
since followed closely on his
heels, so as regularly to
tread down his literary an-
kle-jacks . having “come
it” so much stronger than
the first-named antiquarian.
Being desirous of deciding
between the two old chroni-
clers, we visited the spot in
person, and were received
by the proprietor with that win-
ning courtesy for which he is so
felicitously distinguished. We re-
quested to be enlightened as to
the antiquities of the place, and
were politely referred to the pump,
which is a very old structure-
indeed so old, that after working
away for some time, we found nothing was to be drawn from it. -
There is no doubt that the Belle Sauvage was formerly a French
house, and that William the Conqueror stopped there in the course of his
march against the Metropolis. The learned writers of the last century
either did not know this, or they forgot to mention it. Thomas-à-Kempis
is the only one who seems to give us a glimmering of the fact, but the
Massage in his works is too vague to have any reliance Placed upon it.
e says, “Some be savages at Inns, and the Norman knew it well,” which
has been supposed by an anonymous commentator to allude to the Belle
Sauvage ; but as the anonymous commentator has not even complied with
the usual editorial request, “to furnish his name and address,” we reject
him at once as an impertinent impostor. -
The legends of the Belle Sauvage are so numerous that the literary
epicure may find some “nice pickings” off two or three of them. It is
related in an odd volume of a rare work, to which there are no corners
and not a scrap of title-page, that in London there are many innes and
outtes; but it does not say whether the Belle Sauvage was one of the
innes alluded to.
The following are among the most probable hypotheses as to the hystoſ-
rie of the Belle Sauvage, and though there is nothing but secondary evi-
dence to prove it, yet as evidence is in antiquarian matters quite a secondary
thing, it must be of very little consequence. It would appear from Bretton,
in his Notes on Nothynge, which is so scarce as to have been never seen.
that on the site where the Belle Sauvage now stands, there once “dwelte
an oulldall Merrrechhaunttlee.” This old merchant, (and we spell his
name in the modern fashion to save ink) had a “lovellie daughterre”-
who was so lovellie that “the apprentisses and other gayye follkke” used
to crowd round the dorre of the ouldale merchant (hang the additional
rr's and tt's and ee's) to get a peeppe at her. This used to make the old
man very sore; and the “gayye foikke” getting to hear of this did ring his
bell in the night and run away. This caused the old man to fume; which
does not mean in the literal sense to smoke, though Camden says it does,
and I have hints that his pipe was put verrie muchhe outte by the gay
folkke's conduct. The ringing of the Bell, at all events, made the merchant
savage, and in the course of time the merchant and his belle got so coº:
founded, that one came to be talked of when the other was meant, and
when an inn was built the name of the Savage Bell was given to it., Some
years afterwards, a waggoner having put up at the spot for one night, was
so exceedingly fuddled on going away that he put the cart before the
horse, and the landlord, who was a merrillie conceitedde yeomanne, in-
mediately changed the name of the house to the Belle Savage, “ in
remembrannce,” says Stone, “of the carrmanne who had putte ye cartte
before ye horsse in manner yere mentionedde.”

Tr; E STORY OF A FEATHER.
chapter ix.
the Prince of WAles exhibited—the COUNTESS blush Rose-
DREADFUL ACCIDENT TO M. R. FLAMINGO.
I soon discovered that their Majesties George the Third and
Queen Charlotte had benevolently consented that their baby should
be exhibited to the men and women of England. These tidings had
rung like a merry peal of bells throughout London, and on the very
morning after my exaltation to the Prince of Wales's coronet, crowds
were clustering at the gates of the palace.
Here, however, I must fain confess to a disappointment. Being in
the very temple of royalty, I at first indulged in the most extravagant
expectations of the moral dignity—the uttered wisdom of the high
and fortunate people about me. I watched the king's mouth, as a
bride gazes on her wedding casket, rapt with an assurance of its
contained richness. I followed the motions of the Queen, as though,
for a time, she had taken leave of the skies, to dazzle and to dignify
a benighted planet. Such were my first emotions : but let me be
frank; they were of brief endurance. I very soon discovered his
dread majesty to be a mere man who loved mutton for dinner—and the
queen from Paradise, a quiet little woman, with a humility so marked
that it disdained not decimal fractions.
And then there were the Lords in Waiting—the Gentlemen of the Bed-
chamber—the women of the like Elysium—and those doomed, fragile
dolls and victims of state—God help them 1–the Maids of Honour.
In the simplicity of my inexperience, I believed all these people to
be of another order of flesh and blood—to possess a more exquisite
anatomy—to be refined by the pure and healthful atmosphere of a
court into natures above the sordid influences of this nether sphere ;
to be, indeed, mid-intelligences between men and angels. Must I say
it? I have found the coarse mind of the merest footman in the
lacquey peer; and in the Lady of the Bedchamber, the small envy,
the petty heartburning of Molly the chambermaid at the Star and
Garter. Alas, too ! for the Maids of Honour ! Hapless images of
ceremony—poor, moving anatomies, with eyes that must not wink,
tongues that must not speak; and, hardest tyranny of all, with
mouths that must not yawn at the dull discipline that consumes
them. I have seen them in the royal presence stand on their throb-
bing feet, until the blood has vanished from their lips; and had I
been a fairy wand, I would have changed them straight—have bestowed
upon them the paradise of a three-legged stool, with a cow to milk and
to carol beneath the odour-breathing hawthorn.
If, however, the Maids of Honour affected merely my sympathies,
the Ladies in Waiting excited my highest admiration. Here, I
thought, are women—doting wives and loving mothers—quitting the
serene and holy circle of their own hearths—relinquishing for an
appointed term the happiness and tenderness of home, to endure a
glorifying servitude beneath the golden yoke of ceremony. Here, at
least, I thought, is self-devotion: here a noble sacrifice to noble
objects—l:ere at once the heroism and the true religion of loyalty.
The Countess Blushrose was a Lady in Waiting. Providence had
expressly fashioned her for the ennobling function. She had some
vague notion that there were human creatures—a white race, some-
thing higher in the scheme of the world than the mere Hottentot ;
but it was also a part of her creed that, like horses and oxen, they
were sent for no other purpose to this earth, save for that of minister-
ing in any manner to the will and wish of herself, her friends, and
her immediate acquaintance. The Countess never neglected her
religious duties, for she had a pew that a Sybarite might have slept
in ; and therefore generally once a week seemed to listen to the home-
simplicities of the pulpit—of death, and common dust, and common
judgment. Nevertheless, it was plain that her ladyship possessed
a strength of mind that continued superior to such antique prejudices
—hence, to her dying hour, she remained an unconverted hearer.
The world, the habitable world, to her was composed of about an
area of two miles, with St. James's palace for the centre. Any part
beyond that boundary was, to her, mysterious as the Mogul country :
she looked upon it with the intelligence that possessed the theological
opponents of Columbus, when he talked of a new continent : allowing
it to exist, and to be once reached, there were certain currents that
rendered impossible any return from it. To the Countess Blushrose,
nature herself had written Nec ultra on the west side of Temple-Bar.
The Countess was allowed to be beautiful as the most beautiful
statue : and, save in the presence of majesty, viewed all things
unbendingly and with a stony gaze. She seemed to make the
atmosphere about her cold by her very looks. She rather appeared
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
an exquisite piece of machinery—an improvement on Maximilian's
wooden dove and iron fly of old—a wonderful work constructed and
adorned by the laboured ingenuity of man, than a creature warmed
by human blood, and sanctified with a human soul. Yet men called
her beautiful. Nay, born a baronet's daughter, she had owed her
coronet to her creamy cheek and high abstracted gaze. The heart
of the Earl of Blushrose had been led away, it would seem, in chains
of ice. He had been frozen into matrimony by the spells of a
sorceress; and, influenced by his partner, seemed to his old friends
never to have recovered his natural heat.
At the time of my elevation to Saint James's, the Countess had
only one day relieved a sister Lady-in-Waiting in her exalted cere-
monies. At that time, the Countess had an infant son—Lord Tootle
—in the cradle. She was very fond of it—really, very fond of it ;
but then she felt such devotion towards the palace. This truth I
afterwards learned from a brief incident. The child was born weak
and puny. “Madam,” said the Doctor, “you must nurse this babe
yourself.”
“How can you talk so ridiculously, Doctor " said the Countess.
“Indeed, your ladyship, I advise only what is necessary—indis-
pensable,” urged the Doctor.
“Necessary IIow can I submit to such a tie, when there is the
e to—” -
“Well, madam,” said the Doctor in conclusion, casting a significant
glance at the babe, and then at its mother, “if you do not nurse the
child yourself, my word upon it, 'twill die—die, madam—die.”
Whereupon the Countess, gently elevating her eyelids, said—and
said only—“Poor thing "
I have dwelt thus long upon the character of the Countess Blush-
rose, as she will be found a somewhat important person in my
narrative. Indeed, it was to her that I owed my speedy removal
from the palace. But of this in due time—let me not anticipate.
At the opening of this chapter the reader was acquainted with the
condescending intention of their Majesties: the Prince of Wales, in
his cot or cradle of state, was to be exhibited in bib and tucker to his
future liege subjects. Every due precaution had been carried out to
prevent the too near approximation of the curious vulgar to the
resplendent baby: the rockers sat at the cradle within an enclosure at
the end of a state-apartment; part of the royal household lined the
room, and then units of the world without were suffered to enter at
one door, and walking past the cradle, and casting one look—for a
second was scarcely possible—at the majestic infant, were rapidly
conducted out at a door opposite, to the world they had come from ;
a world they felt themselves henceforth doomed to gladden with tales
of the baby prince,—of the glories of a palace.
It was curiously instructive to watch the beaming countenances
of the happy few who, having elbowed it lustily in the crowd outside
—who in the excess of loyalty had thrust and fought their neigh-
bours to catch a look of princely babyhood—now arranged their
rumpled habits, and tried to conjure serenity to their red and
streaming faces. Men and women of nearly all conditions poured
along the room, and glanced at that marvellous baby. The only
court attire commanded for the event was decent cleanliness—in
very truth (if history be anything), not always palace wear.
Great was the veneration paid to the Prince I Men, whom I after-
wards recognized in the world, came to look their homage to the
all-excelling infant; men, who with red wine on their table, and
their knees at the Christmas fire, would with barred and bolted door
hear the starved orphan wail the Christian carol in the frozen street;
men, with hearts close as their fobs, felt the said hearts marvellously
touched and melted when they looked upon the Prince How deep,
how exceeding their sympathy for baby helplessness hedged about
by palace guards,-how beautiful, how touchingly beautiful, is infancy
born to dominion whereon “the sun sets not l”
And there were other lookers—honest, simple souls, who with a
hurried, almost fearful glance at baby royalty, felt themselves richer
for their coming lives. They had seen things called babies before,
but the Prince was a blessing—a glory in lace, only for the first time
vouchsafed to the world.
Some trod the palace floor as though they feared to hear their
own breath ; had their shoes creaked, it was plain they must have
fainted.
Others again, looked anxiously, fearfully about them, as though,
like men in an Indian wood, they feared some wild beast, with death
in its jaws, to spring out upon them. Many of these—I watched
them—never saw the Prince at all. They approached the cradle
pantingly, but urged on by the attendants, passed it ere they could
call up courage to look upon the dazzling glory within.
I was thus contemplating the various characters of the crowd

when I beheld a face I thought not wholly strange to me. After a
minute, I recognized the visitor : it was my first acquaintance in
England, Shadrach Jacobs, the old Jew of the Minories. Having
that day washed himself, it was difficult for any one to detect the
Hebrew dealer through the strange disguise. Washed, however, he
had been,_washed and drest in black and buckles, as though he had
been going to court at the New Jerusalem. . He hobbled past the
cradle, gazing with his raven eye, which kindled, sparklingly, but
whether at the babe or the lace that half smothered it, I leave to be
divined by the genii of Solomon's brazen kettles.
Immediately following the Jew came Miriam, his voluminous
daughter. Great was her beauty, but greater still her strength :
else, how at her ears, her neck, wrists, and fingers, could she have
borne the many trophies of her victories bought by sailors' wages
out of goldsmiths' cases Miriam was there ; but where was Jack
Lipscomb Where was my first English friend ? Alas! sick, peril-
ously sick on an outward-bound voyage. Poor Jack was in his
hammock. No matter. Tom Bracely of “The Good Intent” went
with Miriam to St. James's.
Thus, seeing an old acquaintance, my thoughts went to Patty. But-
ler. “Will slie,” I asked myself, “be here : " Then I looked hope-
fully about me. Another minute, and I saw—not Patty-but her
smug employer, Mr. Flamingo, with Mrs. Flamingo beside him-both
gazing about them, joyous as spirits new to Paradise. Thºugh
Flamingo was loyal to the very nails, his visit was not paid only to
the infant Prince. No ; feathers had something to do at the trades-
man's heart, and he came—kindly bringing his wife with him—to
behold the exaltation of his ware. I could see hin look up at myself
and two companions, as if he felt the soul of the Prince was then in
the white plumes, and nowhere else; as if the dignity of the Prince
would have been naked as a day-old sparrow, but for the feathers,
which were—in Flamingo's mind—its natural clothing.
With these feelings Flamingo approached the cradle, and Fla-
mingo's evil spirit kept close at his skirts.
The Prince of Wales has fallen fast asleep. Flamingo advances to
look his homage. He is as close as ceremony permits his advance;
when some demon in the air tickles his nostrils, for the feather-
merchant stands fixed, throws his head back, and explodes in
the loudest sneeze that ever profaned the roof-tree of a palace.
As Flamingo sneezed, the Prince of Wales, startled by the noise,
woke—and waking, roared most lustily. The baby of a bacon-fed
ploughman never yelled in higher pitch.
Flamingo was about to pray that the floor would open and swallow
him. Ere, however, he could frame his petitiou, he was hurried to
the door by the attendants; further admission was denied to thronging
sight-seers; and for that day (and all owing to the untowardness of a
sneeze,) the exhibition was concluded.

COOKS AND COOKERY BOOKS.
BY JACOB Dity Asld Ust.
The office of a cook appears to be a very ancient and honourable one.
Athenaeus says, “A cook's is a divine mystery.” Archestratus composed
an epic in praise of it; and has handed down, for the admiration of pos-
terity, the fame of an artiste who placed on the table a whole pig half baked
and half boiled. He also gives the recipe for performing this feat, which
has escaped Mrs. Rundell's attention. Another classic says—
“He that hath wronged a cook hath never 'scaped
Unpunished, for our art is high and holy.”
And Plautus has written, “After eating, praise him who hath ministered
unto thee.”. There are many similar passages to show the great estima-
tion in which these functionaries were anciently held. Nor have those
of the present day by any means degenerated in dignity. The late Mar-
Quis Wellesley's chef de cuisine refused to accompany him—when lord
lieutenant—to Dublin, because there was no Italian opera there. Lord
Sefton's artiste discharged himself, because he and his lordship differed
in opinion as to the Reform Bill. And Sir E. W.'s maître d'hôtel aspired
to the hand of his master's daughter, and wooed her—according to the
custom of his “order”—with puits d'umour, and cakes flavoured with
parfait amour. Under the influence of his passion he also invented “a
new method of melting butter.”
The treatises on this great art are not very numerous. “Cook's
Voyages, with plates,” ought to be found in every kitchen ; Mrs. Glasse
has become one of the English Classics; Mrs. Rundell—God bless her—
has written down the means of giving every man a bilious attack in two
days ; and Mr. Birch’s “Essay on Cheesecakes” caused him to be
advanced to the dignity of alderman and chief magistrate of the City of
London: the inhabitants of his Ward justly considered that an individual
who could make such soup must be an estimable man—his great ac-
quaintance with “Trifles” fitted him to decide on all important matters—the
genius which could form “Maids of Honour” was well qualified to
reform the morals of those who indulge in picking pockets: in deciding
about tipsy men he must have been assisted by his knowledge of “tipsy
cakes,”-and one so well versed in stews was particularly adapted to deal
with broils. A greater even than Alderman Birch seems to have studied
the art and mystery of cooking, as “ sauce à la diable" will prove ; like
Sin, it is very pleasant at first, but causes numerous ill effects afterwards,
until duly exorcised by Rhubarb and Blue Pill, which are nearly as
delightful as Repentance.
Whilst I am upon the subject of Cookery Books I may be allowed to
inquire, why
*}”
“The cook's oracle”
ſº
inserts, recipes “to prevent the Rot in Sheep;” to preserve a Granary
from Weasels;” “to make black paper for Drawing Patterns;” “to
cure the Ringworm ; " and “Blacking for Shoes.” The cook, in
talking about these matters, is surely invading the province of another
official in the domestic establishment; and I will confess I was much
startled to find a recipe commencing as follows: “Take one ounce of
oxalic acid : " and another : “Take two pounds of pearl ash.” However,
on examination, I found these extraordinary and alarming preparations
were for the purpose of cleaning boot-tops and making green paint.
For the benefit of some of my readers, and the amusement of all, I copy
from the Cook's General Receipt Book, by Jas. W. Laughton, page 26,
the following charming “method of turning red hair black" :-
“Take a pint of the liquor of pickled herrings, half a pound of lamp-black, and two
Sunges of the rust of iron; mix and boil them for twenty minutes, then strain it, and rub
the liquor well into the roots of the hair.”
The author omits to say whether the gentleman using this precious balm,
should be hung up for several days—in order to purify himself; but, I
suppose, that is a matter of course. In the same work—page 11—are the
following philosophic and merciful methods of killing rats:-
... “Cut dried sponge into small pieces, and fry or dip it in honey—it will distend their
intestines. , And birdlime laid in their haunts will stick to their fur and cause them to
tear themselves in pieces, in order to get rid of it.” And, “if a live rit be caught, and
anointed with tar and train oil, and then set at liberty, the offensive smell will cause him
tº traverse all the holes of his companions with most distressiny unrety, and cause them
all to disappear.”
The same author, in his Cookery Book, gives rules for preparing
“A big
treacle plaster for the gout;” and I really think any prudent man would
prefer the disease itself to such a remedy. Next comes a recipe “To
escape from or go into a house on fire;” and “A method of curing meat,”
is followed by “A method of curing chilblains.” Last of all, like Banquo's
spirit, appears “A curious neat white mixture” to destroy bugs; and I
feel inclined to say, any other living creature also—the impressive
earnestness of the author is worthy of attention. “Do but touch a live
bug with a drop of it, and you will find it die immediately;” and, next, he
proceeds to inform us that “The smell this mixture occasions is very
wholesome, and to some persons not disagreeable.”
I have copied from the Domestic Cookery Book a list of certain dishes
which no gentleman can think of admitting to his table—their very names
condemn them :-Squab Pie-Soused Tripe—Turnip Soup—Veal a la
Daube-Shank Jelly—Souster, or Dutch Pudding—Restorative Pork
Jelly—Pettitoes—Podovies—Kebobbed Mutton—Marrowbones (with or
without Cleavers)—Bullock's Heart—Flummery–English Bamboo-and
Bockings. How can any individual of refined feelings think of requesting
a Lady to favour him with some “Love in disguise " which appears to be
a calf's head stuffed, covered with forcemeat, and rolled in vermicelli;
and how can the lips of “Sweet Eighteen” avow a predilection to Bubble-
and-squeak!
We wonder at the strange taste of our forefathers in patronising “A
delightful Pie,” in which a mixture of cheese, honey and oil, plays a very
important part—although, as the writer, one Johnne Hinge, kindly informs
us, “It is good for causing wit in man and pleasant humours;” still more
astonishing is it to find that Barbacued Porpoise was a dish fit for the
King's table—and even at this present day, the tenure on which a certain
English manor is held, is that of presenting the Sovereign with a Herring
Pie yearly—a delicacy well calculated to cause astonishment and horror in
the minds of French cooks. It is probable that the titles of some of our
dishes will afford equal mirth to our great-grandchildren; such, for
instance, as—“To collar Pig's Head”—“To dry Hog's Cheek”—“To
force Hog's Ears ”—“A Pepper Pot to be served in a Tureen”—“To
make Parsley Sauce where no Parsley is to be had "–“Everlasting
Syllabubs"—and “Little Short Cakes.”

SYMPTOMS OF SPRING.
The Editor of the Morning Herald tells his readers that Spring is
coming, because—
“On Saturday last, blackbirds were heard melodiously singing in the gardens, planta-
tions, and grounds around Carleton Hall, in Cumberland, the country residence of John
Cowper, Esq., merchant, London.”
That blackbirds were “heard melodiously singing” was, no doubt, a
primá facie, symptom ; but that the singing took place in the “grounds
around Carleton Hall" must have strengthened the supposition, while the
fact of the melody having been heard on the property of “John Cowper,
Esq., merchant, London,” presents to the Herald's mind a chain of
evidence altogether irresistible.

AN “ INSANE * QUESTION.
As there can be no doubt that Hamlet has in his character a consider-
able touch of insanity, ought not Mr. Charles Kean, when appearing in
the part, to be allowed to murder Shakespear with impunity
DARING ROBBERY BY A NOBLE LORD.
3Bunth's 3}olite.
Yest ERDAY, Lord William Lennor was brought to this office,
charged with having converted to his own private use, and for his
own private benefit, the lawful property of various individuals.
Among the sufferers were the executors of Sir Walter Scott, Thomas
Hood, Esq., and the author of The Lion.
As on a late occasion, the office was crowded by many distinguished
members of the clubs of London : those of the Garrick Club being
most prominent. Nearly all the principal London publishers were
also present, together with a considerable number of authors of
lighter literature, from the neighbourhood of Seven Dials and the
City Road.
It appeared that the missing property was traced to the possession
º of Mr. Henry Colburn, of Great Marl-
borough-street. It is but justice to that
very active police-officer, the editor of The
º, Athenaeum, to state that to him was, in the
first instance, wholly attributable the saga-
city of the discovery.
The accused (who was assisted through-
out the proceedings by Mr. Flower, of
... Hatton Garden) maintained the most
* 3 extraordinary calmness during a very long
-> and trying examination.
He had boughº work, in three

volumes, called The Tuft Hunter,
of the accused ; had bought it in
the full belief that it was the
prisoner's property. He had, as a
tradesman, given what he was
convinced would be considered a
fair market price for the article.
(Here Mr. Colburn handed the
prisoner's receipt to the bench,
but the sum was not suffered to
escape.) He thought it was only
due to rank to give something
extra for the name of a lord,
though he feared the present
transaction would very much bring down the article in the market.
Mr. Thomas Hood (with evident reluctance) appeared to prove the
first charge:—IIe was the owner of Tylney Hall, and was much surprised
and shocked to find some of the furniture belonging to that place in
the possession of The Tuft Hunter. He felt very unwilling to appear
against the prisoner, as he (Mr. Hood) felt convinced that nothing
but severe distress (of intellect) could have driven him to the rash
act. (Here police-constable Athenarum produced the property as found
A Conon En’s Inquest (LENNox).
“The coroner's inquest being justly con-
sidered as one of the most important and
valuable institutions of our country, its
functions in the provinces are commonly
delegated to the most obtuse and ignorant
members of the community! The rich and
the intelligent have always influence enough
to evade its duties; so that the “crowner's
'quest law” generally devolves upon some
dozen dunder-headed boobies, who serve
habitually as jurymen for the parish in
which they may happen to reside. They
follow implicitly their leader, the foreman;
who as implicitly follows his leader, the
coroner; the latter personage being usually
a º .# furnished with a few
technical terms and legal distinctions, which
enable him to decide between Accidental
Death, Found Drowned, Wilful Murder,
Justifiable Homicide, and Felo de se.
Whether Mr. Quillet, the official function-
º of Ravensbrook, belonged to this class,
will be seen by the proceedings.”—The
Tuft Hunter, vol. ii. p. 238.
A Coronen's INQUEst (Hood).
“The coroner's inquest, inrolving an
inquiry into the cause of any sudden termi-
nation of life, is justly considered as one of
our most important and valuable institu-
|tions, and accordingly its functions are
commonly delegated to the most obtuse and
ignorant members of our community. The
rich and the º have influence
or tact enough to elude its duties, so that
the inquisition generally devolves on some
dozen of logger-headed individuals, who
serve habitually as jurymen for the parish
in which they may happen to reside. They
follow, as implicitly as a flock of sheep, the
lead of their foreman, whose opinion goes
in the wake of the coroner's, like a boat in
tow of a ship. The latter personage him-
self is sometimes little better than a Dog-
berry, furnished with a few technical terms
jº. distinctions which enable him to
direct the random records of Visitations of
God, Found Drowned, Wilful Murder, and
Felo de se. Whether the official functionary
of — belonged to this class will be seen
by the evidence,” &c. — Tylney Hall,
vol. iii. p. 83.
Mr. Flower said no enlightened jury could convict upon this charge.
How could the property, said to be abstracted from Tylney Hall, be
identified 1 There, the “coroner's inquest involved ;”—as found in
| The Tuft Hunter, the “coroner's inquest” was “considered.” Again,
|Mr. Hood had “functions” only; whilst Lord Lennox had “func-
tions in the provinces.” Thirdly, Mr. Hood had “influence or tact;"
now, though his Lordship had had “influence” to dispose of the pro-
perty, he certainly had no “tact” to conceal the spirit of the trans-
action. Besides, there were other verbal differences that must quash
the charge. The bench, however, was not of that opinion; and the
next witness was called.
Mr. Cadell (one of Sir Walter Scott's executors and assigns)
deposed as follows. In The Tuft Hunter he dis-
covered part of the stolen property, violently
abstracted from Sir Walter's Antiquary. Scarcely tº
a letter had been effaced, as could be proved by
the subjoined evidence:–
WAvAsour's ArakTMENT
(LENNox).
“The room had a com-
fortable though not a lively
appearance. It was hung with
tapestry, which the looms of
Arras had produced in the
sixteenth century. The bed
was of a dark and faded green,
wrought to correspond with
the tapestry. The large showy
stuff-bottomed chairs, with
black ebony backs, were em-
broidered after the same pat-
tern,” &c. — Tuft Hunter, ered upon the same pattern,” —
vol. i. p. 69. &c.—Antiquary. -->
Mr. Flower here contended for the prisoner, that the charge could
not hold. It must be plain to a minute and curious observer that
there was a considerable—nay, a most vital difference in the para-
graphs. For instance, Sir Walter Scott had “large and heavy stiff.
bottomed chairs,” whilst the chairs of the prisoner were “large
showy”. Sir Walter's chair-backs, too, were “embroidered upon the
same pattern,” whilst the prisoner's were “embroidered after.” Mr.
Flower, therefore, contended that no charge had been made out.
This plea, however, was over-ruled by the bench, and the examination
proceeded.
. Hereupon, the author of The Lion stood forth, and proved the rapa-
city of the prisoner, who had (as will be seen by the subjoined)

Barns (Scort).

Mr. Flower contended that this charge must fail. For instance,
the Lion's breakfast was “in the season,” whilst his Lordship's break-
fast was “during.” Besides, his Lordship had the whole of a cordon
blew in his breakfast, there being no hint of such a luxury in the
breakfast of The Lion. Indeed, all the charges were absurd and
frivolous. He presumed that the English language was the common
right of Englishmen. If, however, people were to be prosecuted for
what he held to be nothing more than a curious verbal coincidence-
there was an end of English liberty.
The worthy magistrate expressed his deep regret at finding a per-
son in the rank of life of the prisoner, in so disagreeable a situation.
Hereupon, in extenuation, the prisoner pleaded the direst poverty
(of invention).
There were many other charges similar to the above against the
offender, but as it was consi-
dered that, for the ends of jus-
tice, enough had been proved,
they were not gone into.
Under these circumstances, ºt
and at the express desire of
the accusers, who said they
thought that the exposure =
would be quite sufficient to
put the trade upon its guard

PUNCH'S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER IX. —A MEMOIR OF MARS.
MARS was the god of murder in the lump; that is to say, he was
the god of war. War, however, being a compound idea, which not
many will take the trouble to analyse, it will be as well to state, a
little more in detail, what kind of a thing it was that he patronised.
At all times and in all places he presided over cutting off heads,
smashing skulls, hacking off limbs, and running people through the
body; also over tossing little children upon pikes, hauling along
tender maidens by the hair, trampling hoary heads in gore and dust ;
over burning, plundering, demolishing, and destroying, cities, houses,
temples, and works and monuments of art. Such have ever been the
achievements of martial prowess; such the foundations of “glory.”
But anciently, the means and appliances of his votaries were sadly
limited. Swords, spears, and bows and arrows, with a few clumsy
apparatuses for throwing stones and hammering down walls, were
the only tools, they possessed for cutting, maiming, and doing mis-
chief. They had neither guns, bombs, nor muskets. Their heroes
were unacquainted with the luxury of gunpowder. Alexander the
Great cried when there remained no more worlds for him to con-
quer; perhaps he would have been pacified with a forty-eight-
pounder—not much of a plaything, though, for anybody but a
conqueror.
No doubt, had fire-arms been known to the Greeks, Mars would
have been reported to be the son of a gun ; but as it was, he was
said to be the son of Jupiter and Juno. Little has been handed
down to us respecting his early years, except that, while young, he
was instructed in dancing and every manly exercise. This tradition
has probably a mystical as well as a literal meaning, and was meant
to indicate, figuratively, that nobody intended for a warrior ought to
be taught anything else. Perhaps, however, we may be allowed to
conjecture how his youth was spent. We can imagine that while
yet an infant deity, his pugnacious disposition was evinced by a
propensity to bite and kick; that, as he got bigger, pugilistic incli-
nations were strikingly observable in his conduct; and that his full-
grown juvenility was illustrated with sundry duels. He no doubt
| wore, as soon as he could, large mustaches on his upper lip, not
aminding whether they were red or not ; swaggered about Olympus,
looking ferocious, and insulted every deity he came near.
We learn, that at a more advanced period he was prosecuted by
Neptune for the murder of a son of his, one Halirrhotius. The case
was tried at the Central Criminal Court at Athens, which ever after
that event was called the Areopagus. Mars was acquitted. It was
generally believed, however, that he was guilty; and it may be sur-
Vol. IV.-1843.
mised either that he got off by means of a flaw in the indictment, or
else by his counsel calling Jupiter to witness that he thought the
prisoner innocent, and bringing some clever witnesses to give
evidence in his favour.
The next affair in which this military genius figured was a flirta-
tion with the goddess Venus. This was carried on quietly for some
time; but at last, Apollo, who as god of the sun got up one morning,
like the heroine in the ballad of “Billy Taylor,”
“Early as by break of day,”
beheld (as did that renowned damsel her faithless William) the
gallant deity—
“Walking with his lady gay.”
Listening to their conversation, he overheard Venus agreed to meet
the divine officer by moonlight alone ; the place of rendezvous to be a
shady bower, conveniently situated in a grove at the end of the vale
of Tempe. Hereupon, without delay, he enlightened the mind of
Vulcan on the subject, who at first was rather angry, but soon,
regaining his composure, declared with a slight oath, shaking hishead,
and grinning, that he would see if he would not be even with them.
Night came, and Mars, punc-
tual to his engagement, was at
the trysting-place, killing time as
well as he could by drumming
a march on his shield. In the
distance was his favourite tiger
Alectryon, stationed under a fig-
tree, with directions to crow if
he saw a stranger coming. Pre-
sently Venus in her cloak and
boa came ambling into the ar-
bour; but no sooner was she
// - seated beside her
- adorer, than a string
was pulled by an
unseen hand, and
the unlucky pair
were fast in a steel
net. “Confound that
blacksmith !” cried
Mars. He did not
º mean that blacksmith
- at Gretna Green, but
that blacksmith Vul-
can ; for he guessed
in a moment who had
played him the trick.
He tried to break his
way out; but the
meshes were too
strong for him, and
thus neatly netted,
these “doves in a
cage” were pulled
up aloft, and suspended from the chandelier in Jupiters drawing-
room, to be laughed at by all Olympus. After keeping them in
that agreeable position the best part of a day, Vulcan was pre-
Yailed upon by Neptune to let them out; but they looked very
foolish for a long time afterwards, and, of course, never heard
an end of the story. Momus was always sure to introduce it
after dinner. Mars would have called Vulcan out; but Jupiter
insisted on his shaking hands with him. The only way, therefore, in
which he could vent his annoyance was by punishing poor little
Alectryon, whose duty it had been to let him know when Apollo
was up. He therefore changed his tiger into a game-cock, or,
No. 87.*

according to some into a bantam. “There,” he cried, having
effected the metamorphosis, “your nature is the same as your name ;
go now, hop P’ Alectryon was Greek for the “Morning Herald.”
It would seem, however, that Mars got into some scrape or other,
which rendered him amenable to justice; for it is recorded of him that
he once, to use a classical expression, “had fifteen months.” The
story goes that he was imprisoned by Otus and Ephialtes, sons of
Neptune, who captured him in a war which they undertook against
the gods. But there are reasons for demurring to the reception of
this statement; for according to the same account Otus and Ephialtes
were two enormous giants, who grew nine inches every month, and
were only nine years old when they commenced hostilities. This
part of the tale savours a little too strongly of archery ; nor is there
any better authority for it than that of the fallacious Walker. Mars,
most probably, was imprisoned for an assault; and he appears to have
been liberated on paying a fine, for we are told that he was set free
by Mercury, which word is no doubt a mistake for gold.
During the Trojan war, Mars, who was always partial to Paris,
took part against the Greeks, and once even fought in person on the
side of their opponents. On this occasion, however, he got what is
called a bellyful, whereunto he was treated by the hero Diomedes,
who astonished his digestive organs with a javelin. This wound
would have been mortal if he had not happened to be an immortal
god : as it was, he was obliged to lay up with it for some little time ;
but celestial flesh heals very fast. Mars, on receiving it, roared,
according to Homer, like nine or ten thousand heroes in battle-cry,
and mounted out of sight like a thunder-cloud. As soon as he got to
heaven, he went blubbering to Jupiter, showing the gash in his
stomach, and complaining of Diomedes and of Minerva, who had
lent a hand to the weapon. But Jupiter knit his brows, and gave
him a regular blowing-up, telling him that he considered him the
most odious deity in all Olympus, on account of his bullying, quarrel-
ing, fighting propensities; that he was as bad as his mother Juno ;
and that if he had been anybody else's son but his own, he would
long ago have consigned him to the lowest dungeon in Tartarus.
However, he sent for a doctor, one Paeon, to dress the wound. The
treatment of that practitioner seems to have consisted in the appli-
cation of friars'-balsam ; he did not use sutures, as usual in wounds of
the abdomen, nor even diachylon; but his remedy produced imme-
diate cicatrisation. The case, no doubt, was read at the Olympic
Medico-Chirurgical Society.
The Romans much exceeded the Greeks in their devotion to this
deity; they evinced their faith in him by worshipping him with all
their heart and lungs; and by way of works they cut as many throats
as they could to his honour and glory. His priesthood was instituted
by that venerable frump, Numa; its members were called Salii: their
principal business was to guard the sacred Ancile, or shield, which
old Numa persuaded the people had dropped down from heaven.
The fact was, that it was an old pot-lid, which somebody had flung
over his garden wall.
Mars was represented as an ancient warrior, armed to the teeth,
and looking very fierce; sometimes standing at ease; sometimes in
a chariot, driving his two celebrated blood-horses, Flight and Terror.
His appearance would have been improved by a cocked hat.
Horses, dogs, magpies, vultures, and wolves, were immolated on
his altars; some say, on account of their ferocity and pugnaciousness;
others, with greater plausibility, because he was fond of carrion. The
Scythians sacrificed asses to him, and asses are the chief sacrifices
offered to him in the present day. His worshippers, also, are mostly
asses.
Mars has a much greater variety of servants than he used to have ;
fusileers, lancers, hussars, riflemen, colonels, captains, cornets, corpo-
rals, sergeants, and drum-majors, being, with sundry other function-
aries of his, altogether of modern creation. He is better off, too,
than he was formerly, in respect of ministers. For, as a regimental
poet sings,
“Some talk of Alexander,
And some of Pericles,
Of Conon and Lysander,
And Alcibiades;
But of all the gallant heroes,
There’s none for to compare,
With my right fol de riddle iddle lol,
To the British Grenadier.”

THE UMBRELLA ART-UNION.
THE present undertaking was one that could not possibly have
been carried into effect, unless by the power of numbers combining
for mutual benefit—by the co-operation of MEN, not of Boys. As
well might the artists have otherwise attempted “to pluck bright
honour from the pale-faced Moon,”—which is supposed to be a
difficult task.
The stores of valuable works of art, collected in the umbrellas of
perambulating printsellers, mºst have forcibly struck every traveller,
whose business may have led him occasionally through Picket-street,
Leicester-square, Tottenham-court-road, and the New-cut. Several
causes have combined to produce this immense accumulation. The
scarcity of money arising from the income-tax—the little patronage
bestowed on native talent—the superior attractions, in many cases,
of contiguous baked-potato cans—and, above all, the gratuitous
open-air exhibitions of historical engravings on the hordes of
Trafalgar-square, Wellington-street, and the Royal Exchange, have
all tended to depreciate the value of artistical productions.
The print-umbrella proprietors, then, and cheap image men—the
picture-dealers and sculptors of the million—solely actuated by the
desire to distribute their collectious amongst the said million, and
more, if practicable, have determined to form a lottery of their
stores, in which every one will have a chance of participating, upon
buying pictures to the amount of on E PENNY. Of course, twopence
will entitle the buyer to two tickets, and so on in proportion. The
drawing of the chances will commence as soon as the drawing of
the subscribers has finished ; and it is expected this will take place
on the 1st of April, 1844.
The following is a-

3Littrarm Entelligentt.
The Philosophy of DINING OUT.—Mr. G. W. M. P. Dipps, whose
labours in the field of literature have been hitherto devoted to an exposi-
tion of the Saxon tongue, is now about to favour the world with his long
promised and much desired work bearing the above title. We have no
doubt that, from Mr. Dipps's experience in matters relating to the “ex-
ternal world,” and his intimate acquaintance with the habits of those
individuals (who have for many years patronised his établissement de baked
potatoes, near St. Clement's Church,) his lucubrations on the important
subject of dining out will excite the utmost curiosity.
THE LAST of the CHIMNEY-Sweeps.-Under this attractive title, a new
historical romance, by the author of “The First of the Fairies,” will very
shortly make its appearance. When we state that this work has met the
approbation of that giant among authors, the Sheriff of Middlesex, whose
hospitalities the writer has (at a small expense) enjoyed for the last six
months, our readers will admit that “The Last of the Chimney-Sweeps”
will be much sought after amongst all classes (of creditors).
How To Live upon Nothing. By “A Gentleman who knows.”—This is a
theme of all-absorbing interest, and is suggestive of so many valuable rules
for the propagation of independence, that we have good reason to antici-
pate an extensive sale for the work, which will consist of a small pocket
volume, forming the “best companion” to gentlemen who cannot under-
stand the philosophy of filling the stomach at the expense of the pocket.
THE CRUEl CockNEY, or The FiddleR's DAUGHTER : A Romance of
St. Giles's—may shortly be met with at all the libraries. Whether a
certain nobleman, whose inhuman conduct has rendered him the despised
of all despisers, is or is not the hero of these volumes, we are not at liberty
to inform the reader, nor will he be able to find out; but, nevertheless,
we advise every right thinking person to make his acquaintance with the
“Cruel Cockney.” In justice to the author we should state that, in this
important and instructive work, he has combined “the three great
requisites of a novel ”—interest, interest, interest.
The KNAPsAck, A Tale for TRAvellers: Founded on Facts. By the
Editor of the “Marvellous Magazine.”—In this work will be concentrated
all the energies of a profoundly imaginative mind. It will contain an
account of many of the greatest wonders in the world (including the size
of the Pope's toe and the length of Mr. Muntz's beard); and if it is
attended with the popularity which is expected, the publisher may, on
the part of the author, exclaim –“Wonders will never cease.”
The Book without A Title—Will by its amusing details gratify all
lovers of the sublime and the ridiculous. The author of this work is not
only a gentleman but a scholar; and it is to his classical knowledge, added
to his valuable discoveries in the mines of philosophic lore, that the
public are indebted for this literary curiosity. It is written in a variety
of languages, including Latin, Greek, Cherokee, and Sanscrit, everything
in the shape of good English having been studiously avoided. With
these recommendations, who shall say that the “Book without a Title”
will be a book without a sale 1
TIME versus CRIME.
At last a mode has been hit upon to lessen what has hitherto been called
* a fearful increase of crime: ” it is to try all prisoners “after dinner”
that is, after the Common Serjeant has dined,) at the Old Bailey. A few
ays since, a man was placed at the bar charged with stealing some shovels.
The indictment was read, witnesses examined, sentence passed, and the
culprit ehanged into a transport “for seven years,” and all in the short
space of something less than four minutes f Now, if four minutes will
serve for culprits deserving seven years, eight will, of course, suffice for
fourteen, sixteen for twenty-eight and let us say a whole half-hour,
where the sentence is for life. In such cases “the watch,” as Sir Fretful
Plagiary would observe, “is the best judge,” after all. Indeed, we think we
can suggest an improvement even upon this mode; which is, to have all
the prisoners for trial put in the dock at once ; to read all their indictments
together—to have all the evidence against them in the same breath—and,
instead of a jury being called upon to ponder over every petty case, to have
one comprehensive verdict, that shall take in every crime from homicide
to "frisking a till.”
3.Jumtb's 3}olitical Economn.
of division of LAbour.
The division of labour is a favourite project of political economists.
A familiar instance of the division of labour may be met with in the works
of many modern authors, where, while the writer has had the trouble of
writing, the extreme labour of reading is left to others. This is a division
of labour; though not a particularly fair one, for the heaviest part of it
falls on the reader.
The division of labour means in political economy the enabling one
person to labour at one part only of any process ; and it is this happy
result which is achieved when it takes half a dozen people to make a
common pen, instead of learning one person to manage it.
Suppose a person goes into a barber's shop to be shaved, how much
more satisfactory the process would be, if he could be lathered by one,
his nose held by another, his head kept in position by a third, while a
fourth officiated with the razor. There might be a fifth to take the
money, a sixth to run out and get change, a seventh to hand him a towel,
an eighth to give him a basin of water, a ninth to bow him out of the
shop, and a tenth to open the door, which would be a complete realisation
of the political economist's notion of the division of labour in a barber's
establishment.
The itinerant dealers in vegetables are often political economists in a
certain degree, particularly as regards the driving of a donkey-cart, when
such a thing happens to belong to them. The beautiful theory of the
division of labour is often illustrated by one pulling at the donkey's head,
another belabouring his tail, while others kick or shout with the view of
carrying out the principle of political economy by dividing the labour of
getting a donkey to go—among as many as possible.
There is an old common-sense saying—so common, in fact, that poli-
tical economists are far above having anything to do with it, that “too
many cooks spoil the broth.” Now it is evident that if there is one cook
to cut up the vegetabled, another to throw them in, a third to stir, a fourth
to season, a fifth to taute, and a sixth to serve up, the broth would be
much better made—at least in the eyes of the political economists, whose
theory concerning a division of labour such a mode of broth concocting
would splendidly illustrate.

SINGING FOR THE MILLION.
TheRE is no doubt that Singing for the Million will eventually take firm
hold of the public mind, mouth, tongue, and teeth, so that the ordinary
business of every-day life will be set to music. We should recommend.
in the first instance, the adoption of popular tunes for the purpose of mºre
speedily familiarising the people with the process we are fast approaching
to. W. understand that it is the intention of the Sheriff, on the occasion
of any future proclamations of outlawry, to have them set to the magni-
ficent tune of “Come, if you dare;” and the learned Commissioner will, it is
said, declare the expected dividend in Lord Huntingtower's bankruptcy,
to the popular air of “sing a song of sixpence.” The evidence in ca."
of picking pockets might be arranged to the touching melody of “ We
met, 'twas in a crowd;” and prisoners could harmoniously confess when
taken in the fact at the line, “His eye was upon me.” Bankrupts could
surrender to the popular strain of “I give thee all, I can no more ;" and
the House of Commons might be counted out to the pleasing accompani-
ment of “One two, buckle my shoe,” which it would be easy for a clever
man like the present Speaker to carry on as far as “ thirty-eight, thirty-
nine, then I'll be off to dine,” which (if accompanied by a precipitate
retreat from the house) would amount to an adjournment.

PARLIAMENTARY,
UR COLONEL TO “PUNCH.”
BELLAMY's,
(Waiting for the Dirision.)
My DEAR PUNCH.—For the first time to-day
I read in the shop-windows certain announce-
ments which not only astounded me, but like-
wise most indignantly astonished me, that no
intimation of the fact has yet been given to the
House by the Earl of Aberdeen. I read upon
certain books of the size of pamphlets, that not
only are the “FRENch without A MASTER,”
but also the “SpANish,” and even the “GERMAN.”
Now, if this be the case, it shows either great
neglect or great incapacity on the part of our
Minister for Foreign Affairs;–and, much as my
butler and I esteem Sir Robert Peel and his
Government, I certainly shall move, the first time I
catch the Speaker's eye, for “a Committee to inquire
into the fact of the French, German, and Spanish
being without a master.”
I remain,
Dear Punch, yours very faithfully,
Sibthorpe.
P.S.–I can account now for your being turned out
of France.
HUMOURS OF DEBATE.
MR. Hume, upon the Navy Estimates being gone
into, was desirous of knowing what reduction would
be effected by the recent abolition of the Fleet.
(Heart and taughter.) It was very odd; but when
he (Mr. Hume) began to speak, the House always
began to laugh. . Cries of ‘Question t') There was
no question about it; and if it was a question, he
should like to have it answered. (Oh, oh!) He (Mr.
Hume) had sat in that house many years,

I find that you have been makine a speech on the
subject of reforming the Corporation of London, and
that you are particularly desirous of putting an end
to the glorious farces enacted by the city magis:
trates when presiding in the police courts. I trust my lord, that you will
do no such thing. “Laugh and grow fat" is a main; and if the people
cannot befattened any other way, surely it is better that they should still
have the fooleries of the Lauries, &c. &c. to resort to, for the sort of food
which, if laughter contributes to fat, is enough to make all England cor-
ulent.

is said to prevent two of a trade agreeing, but that you will at once concur

LoRD BROUGHAM TO PUNCH.
Lord Brough AM begs leave to acknowledge a letter from Punch, for
whom he has the highest respect, having studied in the same school, as
may be seen by his (Lord º works on philosophy, politics, heat,
colá, light, law, physiology, and the various other plogie, which modern
science has made a name—but has done little else—for. Lord Brougham
would be sorry to dry up those sources of laughter which the pumps of
the city so copiously supply; but Lord Brougham thought Punch knew
him better than to have supposed that when he (Lord Brougham) made a
speech, he had any particular notion of acting up to it.
THE HUNGERFORD SUSPENSION BRIDGE.
The weekly report of this splendid spec. was read yesterday in the
presence of the proprietors, and the whole of the men employed upon the
works, consisting of the three carpenters and the bricklayer's labourer.
The report briefly stated that the water in front of the works continued
to go on swimmingly, that the large piece of timber maintained its position
so well and so long, as to have become entitled to the appellation of “a
venerable pile,” in contradistinction to those which Father Thames had

swept away in a most summary manner heretofore The report went on
to state unat one of the logs of wood which had been rammed into the
mud, was losing its perpendicular, and that it would be desirable for a
committee of shareholders at once to sit upon it, with a view to rendering
it firm in its position. It was also stated that geological researches were
being carried on in the neighbourhood of the works, and that the soil
seemed to be uncommonly rich, leading to the conclusion that the pro-
prietors would eventually profit by its richness. A dividend of a penny
was at once declared amid great cheers, and a call of ten shillings a share
applied for. The meeting after this broke up immediately.
THE “ MOON” TESTIMONIAL.
THE subjoined circular—Punch does not jest—has been, in sober
seriousness, sent to our office. As a particular patron of Mr. Moon's
“fine arts,” Punch will not subscribe a farthing. We will, notwith-
standing, do something very handsome for the publisher, whom the

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPTER X. —I AM CARRIED OFF FROM The PALACE.-the COUNTESS
BLUSH ROSE AND HER CHAPLAIN.
Few and brief were my days of glory in the palace. Long ere the
Prince of Wales cut his first tooth—what a chaptermight be written on
the teeth of princes !—I was removed from my high, intoxicating place
of state—plucked from the coronet. Nevertheless, a splendour still
hung about me; I was still enriched by the recollections of the past.
I had waved above the slumbers and the waking smiles of the Prince of
Wales—I had been a type of state and honour—I had been glorified
by position—and was, therefore, a relic dear to the associations of
those who trod the carpet of a palace as though they walked the
odorous turf of Eden. It was to this love, this veneration, that, I
am convinced, I owed my speedy removal from St. James's. Had
the Countess Blushrose felt less devotion towards the Prince of
Wales, I might for years have remained in the palace ; it may be,
thrown aside to pass into the stomachs of palace moths. I was,
however, doomed to a more various destiny. The Countess Blush-
rose refined away the vulgarity of mere honesty by the excess of
loyalty. A philosopher, or—if he were duly hired for the coarse
word—an Old Bailey practitioner would say the Countess stole me.
Well; in hard, iron phrase, she did so : but surely the spirit that
prompted the felony, made the theft a divine one ! Even the accus-
ing angel must have put his finger to his lip, and inwardly said
“Mum !” as the Countess, in a flutter of triumph, bore me from the
palace. How her heart beat—for, snugly concealed under her short
satin cloak, I felt the throbbing organ—beat, as the beautiful robber
entered her carriage.
I doubt not, there are simple folks who will marvel at this story—
nay, it may be, give no belief to it. They may ask, “What a
countess filch a feather, when a word in the proper place would
doubtless have made it her lawful chattel Such petty pilfering
might have been looked for at the hands of Mrs. Scott, the prince's
wet nurse—of Jane Simpson or Catherine Johnson, rockers—but
from Countess Blushrose l’”
I confess it: in my inexperience of the world, such were the very
thoughts that oppressed me; now it is otherwise. Not without
melancholy I own it; but I have found that with some natures it
would pain and perplex their moral anatomy to move direct to an
object : like snakes, they seem formed to take pleasure in indirect
motion ; with them the true line of moral beauty is a curve. Had
Queen Charlotte herself bestowed me upon the Countess, the free
gift, I am sure of it, had not conveyed so much pleasure as the pilfered
article.
Borne from the palace, I speedily arrived at the mansion of the
Countess, in Square. A curious adventure met me, I may say,
at the threshold. As her ladyship passed through the hall, she was
met by a mild, gentlemanly looking person. There was a certain
meaning in his look—a something significant of disquietude softened
and controlled by constitutional calmness. “May I speak some words
with your ladyship !” he asked.
“Certainly, Mr. Inglewood,” answered the Countess; and, turn-
ing into an apartment, she let her cloak drop from her shoulders,
cast me upon the table, and then, with the voluptuous majesty of
Juno, sank upon a chair. “Have you heard how the dear bishop is
to-day ?” she inquired ; and then, without waiting for an answer, she
continued : “poor man what he's made of I can't think—mere flesh
and blood had never lasted till now.”
“His lordship has been a great sufferer,” replied Mr. Inglewood;
“but to-day he is better.”
“But there's no hope—impossible. He mends, and he mends; but
then he breaks, and he breaks. That cough of his ought to have killed
anybody. Well, Mr. Inglewood,”—and here the Countess, lifting me
from the table, and now idly fanning her cheek with me, and now
breathing upon me, and smiling as at her breath I trembled—“well,
Mr. Inglewood,” she said, “I suppose we must all die.”
“Thank God " was the answer.
“Really now,” asked her ladyship, still waving me to and froin her
white hand, “don’t you think this world would be a much prettier
place if death never showed his wicked features in it f"
Mr. Inglewood gravely shook his head, and then with a gentle
smile asked—“Ought we to say wicked, madam 1"
“I can’t tell—perhaps not ; you as a clergyman are bound, you
know, to have other opinions. And yet,” added her ladyship, conde-
scending to glance with brilliant archness at the reverend man,—
|
“and yet, I dare say death, though at times he may be thought a
tolerable sort of thing by a curate, is ugly enough—oh, a perfect
fright—to a bishop.”
“I hope not, madam,” answered the private chaplain of the
Countess.
“You have no notion,” asked her ladyship, “who will have the
vacant mitre : Very good, Mr. Inglewood; by that look of humility
I can perceive that mitres make no part of your dreams. You are
above such vanities.”
“In truth, your ladyship, though I’m not of worse stuff than bishops
are sometimes made of "
“Certainly not,” interrupted the Countess quickly; “I don't see
why you should despair. There is the bishop of ; he was only
chaplain, and taught—what is it !—hic, hoc to the children. You are
certainly as good as he—and then you can swim so well ! How lucky
it was that you brought his lordship's nephew out of the Isis How
very lucky for your prospects—though I doubt if the younger brother
will ever thank you for it. How strange now, if some day it should
prove that you fished a mitre from a river !” Thus spoke her lady-
ship to the dependant parson—spoke in a cold, icy tone of banter,
that—I could see it—made the man wince as he listened.
“Madam,” said Inglewood, “I have no such hope; I will add, no
such wish. Contentment—”
“To be sure,” cried her ladyship, “contentment is the prettiest
thing in the world. Oh, it saves people such a deal of trouble 'Tis
an excellent thing—a beautiful invention for the lower orders; and
then it's so easy for them to obtain—easy as their own bacon, milk,
and eggs.”
“Very often, madam,” replied Inglewood, with some emphasis;
“nay, too often, quite as easy.”
“But with us, who are constantly troubled with a thousand things,
contentment would be as out of place as a gipsy in a court suit. I
think, if ever in my life I was to feel perfectly and truly content, I
should expire on the instant.”
“We pray against sudden death,” said Inglewood, solemnly.
“Lud 1.” cried the Countess, startled by her chaplain's tone—
“don’t name it; I do, most heartily. Don't talk of it—I'd forgot—
you had something to say, Mr. Inglewood "
“Will you forgive me, madam,” said the chaplain, “if, presuming
on my function, 1 interfere with matters in this house, as I have been
told, not within my duties?”
“Mr. Inglewood I" cried the Countess, with some surprise, throw-
ing me upon the table, “pray go on, sir; as a clergyman, nothing,
sir, should be below your interference that—”
“That affects the peace of mind—the happiness of a fellow crea-
ture,” added Inglewood.
“Very right, sir; very right: as a Christian minister of the Esta-
blished Church, nothing less should be expected of you. I have the
greatest opinion of your morals, Mr. Inglewood—the greatest. I only
hope that the Earl—for I can perceive by your manner, that it is of
his lordship you are about to speak—”
“Indeed, madam—I—”
The interruption was in vain. The Countess, with increasing rapid-
ity of speech—accompanied with gestures that left nothing for the
chaplain to do, save to wait with resignation the silence of the talker–
continued to repeat her sentiments of confidence in the judgment,
vigilance, and devotion of the divine, together with hints and sus-
picions directed at the connubial loyalty of his lordship, towards
whom her vanity took the place of love. It was her instant and
fixed belief that her chaplain—the man of peace—was about to vin-
dicate his functions by becoming a domestic tell-tale ; that he was
about to prove himself her faithful friend, by making her “the most
wretched of women.”
At length—for even the tongue of a vain and jealous woman will
stop (an invincible proof of the ending of all mortal things)—at length
the Countess was silent; and, throwing herself back in her chair,
with the deepest devotion of a domestic heroine, was prepared for
the worst. She had always felt that she was reserved by fate for
something dreadful, and the moment was arrived The Earl was a
fickle, false, and selfish man, and she—sweet martyr to the marriage
service—she, alas ! was his wife.
“Madam,” said Inglewood, somewhat abashed and confounded by
the energy of the Countess, “were I base enough—but no”—and
the chaplain stammered, and his face for a minute flushed—“I have
no word to speak of the Earl were there that to say of him which
your ladyship's fears, most groundless fears I am sure, would listen
to, it would little suit my place or nature, madam, to utter it.”
“What does the man mean t” asked the Countess. “Did you not
say that you had to speak of something that affected happiness and
peace of mind—and all that "

“True, madam,” answered Inglewood.
“Well, then—and to whose happiness, to whose peace of mind
could you possibly allude, if—”
“Will your ladyship hear me ! I will be very brief,” said the
chaplain, with an inward twinge—a rising of the heart—at the inborn,
ingrained selfishness of the beautiful creature before him.
“Oh, say what you like—I suppose I must hear you,” answered
the Countess, again taking me from the table, and pettishly waving
me about her.
“A person in your ladyship's household has committed a fault—”
“Of course,” said the Countess—“such creatures do nothing
else.”
“She has proved not trustworthy in the duty confided to her.”
“I hear of nothing else,” cried the Countess, waving me more vio-
lently. “Let her be turned away immediately.”
“You will pardon me, madam : she was about to be cast from the
house—cast out broken-hearted and with a blighted name—when I
took it on myself to stand between her, and, for what I know,
destruction, and to plead her cause before you.”
The Countess looked at the chaplain impatiently—angrily, and
then said, “Mr. Inglewood, I am sorry for it. I wish you would
confine yourself to your duties.”
“And what, may it please your ladyship—what are they f" asked
the clergyman, with calm voice and fixed look.
“I trust, sir, you know them—to say prayers, and to make or read
a sermon,” answered the Countess.
“And nothing more, madam "inquired Inglewood.
“Surely not. What else?” cried her ladyship, with raised voice
and wondering eyes.
“At least, madam, to strive to practise what I pray and preach,”
answered the chaplain.
“Mr. Inglewood, his lordship, out of esteem for you, placed you
here; you were lucky enough to save a relative's life, and perhaps it
was right—I don't say it wasn't—to acknowledge the attention;
nevertheless, I will have no monkish, papistical principles put for-
ward in this house. If you can comport yourself with respect and
decency, as a chaplain ought to do, remain where you are, if not—I
say, if not, sir—but you of course know what must follow.”
“Perfectly well, madam. I am either to remain a salaried
mockery—an inward apostate—a blaspheming thing of outward
observance—”
“I beg, sir,” cried the Countess, impatiently—“I beg you will use
better language.”
“A creature, wearing the skin-deep livery of truth,” continued
Inglewood, his face glowing, and his eye flashing as he spoke—“foul
and leprous within—a hideous mountebank, owing the daily bread
of daily hypocrisy to an adroit juggling with words; I am to do this,
to take the place of the fool of other times in his lordship's house-
hold, or I am to quit it. His lordship, madam—"
But at this moment Earl Blushrose entered the apartment.

REMARKABLE Occurrence.—During the severe gale on Wednesday last,
a great flight of umbrellas passed over this city. It is conjectured that in
the late hurricane, they were carried out of a shop at Derby in a thorough
draught of air, and being all put up, took this direction in their supposed
migration to the Isle of Man.—Cheshire Recorder.

Mr. Isaac Bowers, tailor of this town, is in possession of a starling, that
exhibits the annexed wonderful powers; the bird whistles in perfect tune
and time the whole of the airs of Rossini's Guillaume Tell.
Mr. Bowers cannot comprehend how the bird could obtain even the
outline of the tunes, excepting that at one period a Mr. Barclay (a bass
member of the chorus of various theatres), once lodged in his house for a
month, when the tailor's bird, it is presumed, took Mr. Barclay's measure.
That which renders this detail still more curious, is the fact, that this
starling is an Albino, with white plumage and red eyes.

His Grace the Duke of Rutland has commenced his series of Archery

A new spring costume has been adopted by the ladies who draw the

embroidered down the dress, interspersed with bull's-eyes, which produce
a very striking effect.
Light-blue gloves, and red morocco boots, with silver heels, complete

was designed by the ingenious Sir Frederick Trench.-Leicester Ad-

Grantham.
Sporting ExtRAoRDINARY-An unprecedented event took place on the
downs north-west of this town. A game-keeper in the service of Lord
Grantham was returning from Stamford, and he distinctly saw a brace of
hares in close chace of a greyhound ; the dog appeared much distressed,
and endeavoured by every means in his power to evade his pursuers.
The gamekeeper watched this strange chace until the animals were out of
sight; but from circumstances, he has very little doubt but the hares
would attain their object, and capture or destroy the dog.
The greyhound, which was a valuable one, was the property of Lord
Alfred Paget.—Stamford Free Press.

There is no truth whatever in the paragraph (which has gone the round

misfortune happened to either of the twelve aldermen, the recorder, the

Elopement.—A singular elopement took place from the premises of
Mr. Samuel Belton, boot and shoe-maker, of this place. No less than
thirty pair of pattens walked out of the shop on Tuesday last, and have
not since been heard of.
It is conjectured that they have taken umbrage at the introduction of a
number of pairs of French clogs, recently imported by Mr. Belton,
under the new tariff. Should this meet the eye of any of the absentees,
they are requested instantly to return to their disconsolate owner.—Bedford

A great addition can be made to the edible game of this country. We
hasten to publish a communication, we have received from an intelligent
correspondent, who professes himself to be an able chemist.
The common crows (corvidae) are abundant over every part of Great
Britain, but it is well known that its flesh never, hitherto, could be used as
an article of food, (rooks in pies, excepted).
Our correspondent proceeds to state, that if the birds are properly
picked and trussed, taking great care not to break the galls, and then
immersed in water in which sal-ammonia has been melted, to the amount
of one pound weight to a gallon of the fluid, there they are to remain a
fortnight; then take them out of the pickle, dry, flour, and roast the
crows, and we defy the most profound yourmand to distinguish them
from grouse.
Our correspondent's letter is dated from “York Lunatic Asylum.”
INSANITY MADE EASY.
* EELING, as we must, that it is very desirable
that those “unfortunate persons” who are sub-
ject to monomania, should be protected from
the penal consequences of their calamity—par-
ticularly when their affliction is liable to reach
the climax of murder—it is due to those very
much-to-be-pitied persons, that the proof of
their mental aberration should be made as
easy as possible We, therefore, beg leave to
subjoin a few facts, upon proof of which ac-
-- - - quittals may be at once obtained in cases of the
very gravest nature. -
1. To have habitually declared one's self the victim of persecution.
2. When in Newgate on a charge of murder, to amuse the medical meu
by fantastic assertions on the subject of certain imaginary plots, crews,
and conspiracies.
It would be idle to go through a long catalogue of these defences, which
will admit of endless variety; but, as insanity will henceforth become an
essential part of the science of crime, we should not be surprised at thieves
and assassins taking lessons from professors of the “art of going mad,
with a view to the establishment of irresponsible agency.”
THE QUEEN'S “BANDS.”
GREAT are the small doings of princes ! When Napoleon exhibited his
head without powder, a mortal chill struck upon the perfumers' hearts of
France. Queen Victoria resolves to wear “bands,” and English hair-
dressers have their fortunes taken out of curl, and appear dishevelled in
Portugal street ! A few days since, an insolvent (Augustus Barttelot),
attributed his misfortunes to the unconscious taste of her Majesty. He
declared that “the ringlets were the most profitable, and the plain bands
introduced by the Queen were the ruin of hairdressers.” What makes
the case more desperate with the fraternity, is the hopelessness of any
return of the Wigs!

PUNCH'S PHRENOLOGY.
PHRENology is a subject upon which the opinions of scientific men
have always been so unanimous, and upon which so little has been said,
either by the lecturer or the disputant, that Punch does not hesitate to
record his own original notions concerning this much-neglected branch of
science. He is aware that there are many shops in London where human
heads are examined and disposed of upon phrenological principles; and
he is also aware that upon the same principles a murderer has been some-
times distinguished from a philanthropist—when the difference in their
characters is previously known. But this is not enough—Punch cannot
help regretting that so interesting a subject has never been properly con-
sidered, and É. is therefore desirous of reducing the science to a few
natural elements, which may always be relied upon by the student. If
the following rules should have the effect of promoting the slightest differ-
ence of opinion amongst professional men, or of convincing them that
there is more in the human head than they have yet found out, Punch
will be sufficiently rewarded for his discoveries.
Amativeness is an organ very largely developed in persons who are
confined in the Queen's Bench, and are anxious to borrow money from a
friend to effect their liberation.
Adhesiveness is a faculty possessed in a strong degree by a criminal
who has told a lie, and has come to the resolution of sticking to it.
Combativeness shows a “tendency to fighting and disputation,” and is
by no means moderately developed in friends and relations who chance
to be present at the reading of a will.
Destructiveness is supposed to be “indispensable to animals which live
upon flesh,” and is possessed to a remarkable extent by lawyers.
Benevolence is an organ which “produces kindness, benignity,” &c.,
and in gentlemen who subscribe to public charities its development is
found to be very small.
Veneration “prompts to respectful feelings for ancestors, benefactors,”
&c., and we may add, for individuals possessed of power or money.
Hope.—This faculty “leads us to build castles in the air," and is

[. to an immoderate extent by the Syncretics. In barristers who
ve been at the bar upwards of twenty years without once holding a
brief, and yet live in the expectation of becoming Lord Chancellor, it may
be said to be rather full.
Wonder is largely developed in play-goers who have seen Mr. Charles
Kean in Hamlet, and are acquainted with the fact that he receives £50
per night.
Ideality is strongly marked in the imaginative gentlemen who live by
reporting the “accidents and offences” in the daily papers.
Wit or mirthfulness “disposes the mind to view objects and events in a
ludicrous light,” and is more fully developed in Punch than it was in
Sheridan.
Imitation is the property of half the authors and actors of the present
day, who have the credit of originality amongst those who are ignorant of
their prototypes.
Locality “enables the beings who are endowed with it to know their
way to places where they have been before,” and is developed to the
fullest extent in pickpockets who have just been discharged from Newgate.
Number is a sign so fully developed in policemen, that they are distin-
guished by nothing else.
Order—This organ is rather large in waiters, and in gentlemen who
have an objection to paying for admittance to a theatre.
Language is a faculty possessed to a considerable degree by the denizens
of a fashionable locality known as St. Giles's. It is said to be denoted by a
“prominence of eye.” and is sometimes so very strong that a blackness
is often its characteristic.
These are a few indisputable facts that will doubtless open a new light

THE TICKETING SYSTEM.
The tendency of tradesmen to speak “by the card” is made manifest
by the enormous extent to which goods in the present day are ticketed.
At one establishment articles are being “given away,” whilst at the next
door the proprietors are undergoing the daily torment of an “alarming
sacrifice.” One would imagine that self-immolation was a popular
pastime with the tradesmen of London. Nearly every window announces
the determination of the proprietor “to sell considerably under prime
cost :" from which it would seem that keeping a shop was a piece of dis-
interestedness, by which one man determines to victimise himself, and
occasionally a few creditors, for the benefit of the public in general.
These sacrifices, however, do not seem to be wholly without their reward,
for the tradesmen who resort to them very frequently prosper, in spite of
their recklessness of their own interests. Thus, while the tickets in the
windows bespeak a “ruinous reduction,” the premises themselves display
a “splendid enlargement,” and when sacrifices are to be performed, the
temples are often decorated in a style of gorgeous magnificence. That
sacrifices are made there can be no doubt, but it is another question who
are the victims.

116 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF LORD BROUGHAM P
It is now, we believe, a well-attested fact, that Lord Bhough AM,
'ere he enters the House of Peers, always throws up a shilling with
himself to decide upon his line of politics for the evening. Sometimes
heads have it; of course, sometimes tails; hence the uncertainty of
his Lordship's vote and interest on any given question.
A few nights ago he made dreadful sparring with his old civic
friends, the Guildhall giants. He abused Gog and Magog for those
very propensities which his now “learned friend,” Lord LYNDHURst,
a short time since lauded them to the seventh heaven. The Lord
Chancellor, however, ingenuously owned if he had at all “spoken to
character,” that he had no recollection whatever of the laudation, it
having been an “after-dinner speech.” In vino reritas, it appears, is
not an adage applicable to the woolsack.
However, Lord Bhough AM's abuse has greatly fallen in value, and
that upon the true commercial principle ; the supply has so con-
siderably exceeded the legitimate demand. To be sure, he continually
endeavours to force the market; nevertheless, his vituperation
“must be quoted heavy, there being few takers.” Lately, his
Lordship being in this strait, having no fair vent for his gall-nuts,
sets up dealer in honey, though we fear with as little success of
realising any ultimate profit.
The American newspapers have told us of a man who was so
terrifically handsome that he was obliged to carry a stick to keep the
women away from him. The Duke of WELLINGto.N is morally in
some such predicament with 1 espect to Lord BRough AM AND Vaux.
It is quite impossible for his Grace to keep clear of the oppressive
admiration of Lord Bhough AM, even for one evening. The Duke
certainly, like Dennis Brulgruddery, “does not come of a blushing
nation,” else must he turn scarlet as his own regimental coat at the
incense offered, “hissing hot,” under his nose by the late HENRY
Bnough AM. According to that great law authority, the Duke is the
very incarnation of all human wisdom. He sits above the world, the
vicegerent of Providence. To him, CAEsAR himself was not only a
duck-legged drummer, but—such is Lord Brough AM's last discovery
—the Duke of WELLING Ton is quite equal to DEMost HENEs or
Cicero ! Hear his Lordship –
“Now, my Lords, to advert to this longer were impossible, [i. e., to the charge against
Lord Ellº N borough on his Somnauth proclamation,] after having heard the admirable,
the unanswerable address of the noble Duke (hear, hear!)—a speech I do not hesitate to
characterise as truly memoralle (cheers), in which an illustrious commander, with a pre-
cision and clearness no one so strikingly displays as himself (hear, hear !), and unequalled
among the professed masters of the art of oratory—united with a wisdom giving weight
and authority to all he says (cheers)—l say, my Lords, after hearing the speech in which
that noble Duke discussed the mingled military and political questions involved in this
subject (hear!), connected as it is, too, with a country in which he himself began his
course, not only as a soldier, but as a statesman hear!), as let any one who has read his
wonderful d-spatches testify cheers)—founding, as they do, a fame far loftier even than
the triumphs of the warrior (cheers"—after, my Lords, hearing that speech, it were
impossible even for ignorance and inexperience to be incompetent to see the truth on
this matter with a clearness which subtlety and sophistry cannot obscure.”
Well, this cannot last. The Duke, though gifted with an iron
stomach, will some night be sure to turn round and bite his idolater.
The chivalrous Quirotte—for the Duke has had his flighty political
moments—will be certain some evening to snub Sancho, and then
what remains for him By what means will Lord Brough AM then
engage public attention ? When he has ceased to be fly-flapper to
the hero of a “hundred fights,” how will this WATERFord of the only the half of marriage) what becomes of Captain Rous ! Where
House of Peers maintain a notoriety, essential as the throbbing of
his brain, to his existence Alcibi ADEs, to trump himself, cut off
his dog's tail. When Lord Brough AM has ceased to make people
stare in the House of Lords, he will, we doubt not, take to the streets
for celebrity. He has, at the clubs, been heard to express himself
in contemptuous terms towards the copper appendage of George the
Third in Cockspur-street; hence, let no man wonder, if Lord
Bhough AM be some day charged at a police-office with cutting off the
pig-tail of his late blessed Majesty. To be sure, considering that his
Lordship has lately very much abused and reviled his said Majesty,
the natural inference, in his case, would be to find him early some
morning decorating the bronze effigy with garlands of roses; but
then, who can prophesy the future by the past of Lord Brough AM 1
That his Lordship—with an instinct of his approaching nullity in
the House of Lords—has opened a correspondence with the manager
of Covent Garden, for an appearance next Christmas, is a rumour we
do not quite believe. His Lordship is not sufficiently agile for
Harlequin—wants unction for Clourn—and is much too spiteful for
Pantaloon. Alas! for genius, when, in its restless perversity, it insists
upon surviving its departed greatness
THE WEDDING-RING IN PARLIAMENT.
OUR law-makers have, within these few days, been very learned
on the wedding-ring. Captain Rous—the gallant member for West-
minster—with, doubtless, an intimate knowledge of the process, has
declared that “marriage takes 40 per cent. out of a man 1" He
would not have our navy officered by men who, lapped in the
fleecy hosiery of peace, had taken to themselves wives. He, doubt-
less, feared on the minds of the otherwise hardy tars the influence
of home recollections—the snugness of the fireside—the kettle's
song—the cat’s purr, and the toothsomeness of crumpets. This foolish
fallacy has often been advanced by men not quite wizards in their
generation, and as frequently destroyed. We wish the gallant
Captain had moved for an historical return of all the bachelors and
married officers, from the time of ALExANDER to that of Colonel
SIBThorp. Unless we are very wrong, we believe Julius Cæsar
had a wife; we think, too, that Napoleon, when a general of five-
and-twenty, was also a married man ; such, too, is our impression of
the Duke of Wellington when he fought at Waterloo. Yet, in the
belief of Captain Rous, the true laurel is only to be found in what
children call “bachelors' buttons.” -
What, then, would Captain Rous advocate—universal celibacy
throughout the army and navy This would, to be sure—granting
his own calculation as correct—be of considerable saving ; inasmuch,
as to the especial delight of Mr. HUME, we might immediately reduce
our army and navy estimates 40 per cent. The country would be a
gainer; but how for the defenders of the country What would be
their position ? Would they adopt the discipline of the Knights'
Templars Should we have monks on the quarter-deck—monks in
garrison Captain Rous, of course, laughs with all his stalwart
might at the absurdity; and, giving himself a nautical hitch, sings—
“In every clime we find a port,
In every port a wife, sir!”
Now, what Captain Rous would argue as affecting the military and
naval character, certain small wits have contended for in its opera-
tion on all human genius. Ere now, we have heard Bacon quoted
as a triumph of celibacy, when BAcon (see his Letters) was anxious
for a knighthood, that it might recommend him to a certain citizen's
daughter, whom he subsequently wedded. Sir Thomas Brow NE
wished that children could grow like trees, but afterwards became a
vulgar married man. Read the beautiful homage paid to wedded
affection by BURKE, by Rom II. Ly; the evidence of its sweetening and
sustaining power in the most wearying and anxious tasks of life. We
have, however, done with Captain Rous ; leaving him to the future
consideration of the electors' wives and daughters of Westminster.
And yet, must we ask one question. Is Captain Rous himself
married ? Assuming as correct his own theory that “marriage takes
40 per cent. out of every man,” there is no doubt that he has been turice
married, and is now courting for the third time. The account then
will stand thus:—
To two marriages of Captain Rous . . . 80
To effect of third courtship . . . . . 20
100
Thus summed up (and allowing that courtship should be taken as
are his remains 1
On the discussion of the Poor Law in the House of Lords, the
objection to the separation of man and wife by the iron hand of the
Union governor was met by the Duke of WELLINgroN, who con-
tended that there was no peculiar hardship in such temporary
divorce : soldiers and sailors were equally liable to it. His Grace
might, we think, have adopted a higher and weightier illustration in
those Lords and Ladies whose duties demand their attendance for a
certain time about the Royal person. He might have claimed the
sympathies of the House and country by reading from the Court
Circular, that—“To-day, the Duchess of arrived at the Castle,"
to take her turn as Lady of the Bedchamber. He might have asked,
if there were to be such abundance of sympathy for the dwellers in
Unions, yet none for the state attendants in Palaces ! Were we
to sigh over the fate of some weaver's wife, and have no pity for a
.." His Grace might have put this question ; but—his Grace
id not.
Why is “Yes” the most ignorant word in the language?—Because it docan't
“No” anything.

THE SIDE-SCENES OF SOCIETY.
chapter x.-Which is briefly CONCLUSIVE.
Fon along time we saw very little of the Lacquers, or any of their
connexions—principally because we did not care to pay any extra-
attention to a set of people who had so few feelings in common with
ourselves. We are perfectly aware that the heart, even in its proper
state, is simply a hollow muscle; but this organ, in all the Lacquer
family was so very cavernous, that it almost resembled a human drum,
making a loud empty noise to the world from its very hollowness, but
destitute of any sympathy with its fellows.
Now and then, however, we saw the name of “Spangle Lacquer,
Esq.” amongst the advertised directors of some new Improvident
Assurance Society, or in a file of aristocratic subscriptions. Then the
fashionable newspapers contrived occasionally to make a paid para-
graph look as unlike an advertisement as possible in heralding forth
the description of a fête or soirée given by the lady; and after that we
heard vague reports that one of the daughters was about to marry a
foreign nobleman—Count or Baron Somebody or another, whom we
had seen flitting about Hanway-yard and Regent-street. Like his
compatriot fláneurs, he was of seedy appearance, and always awakened
a wish in you to shave him, cut his hair, and plunge him into a warm
bath. Indeed, we once saw his attention fixed at a placard outside a
fur-shop in one of the thoroughfares just named; and when we read
the announcement of “Foreign skins washed here,”

we thought what great advantages the establishment could offer to
many of the Continentalists who crowd our pavements;
Subsequently the match was off; and people said he behaved
very badly. For our own part, we think, his conduct was strictly
honourabie; inasmuch as when he heard that the father lived up to
his income, and did not mean to give his daughters anything until he
died, the foreign nobleman with a fine sense of feeling declined
dragging Miss Lacquer into a state of poverty—his own property
being curiously minute, and worthy of forming an interesting object
for the Oxyhydrogen Microscope at the Polytechnic Institution.
As regarded both the .# ladies, affairs were beginning to get
desperate, and the usual round of expensive marine boarding-houses
was recommended. Here they commenced their attacks upon all
the corpulent bachelors with curled hair—the wild young celebitaires
of five-and-forty, who flourish at those matrimonial exchanges every
autumn—but their success was not equivalent to their efforts. And
finally, disgusted at the want of taste shown by their countrymen,
they persuaded the heads of their family to go to Paris, where we
again met them, living in the most expensive hotel of the dearest
quartier, and feeling great pleasure in paying twice as much as they
ought for everything they purchased, to the great benefit of poorfolks
like ourselves who came after them. They stopped at Paris some
little time, and then went to Switzerland and Italy. Afterwards,
somebody met them on the Rhine, and at last they returned back to
England, laden with cartloads of alabaster ornaments, German
glasses, and wonderful productions from every place they had visited,
which, we imagine, must convert their already crowded drawing-
rooms into a species of private bazaar. They could have purchased
all these things at an equally cheap rate in England, including duty
and carriage, but then the chance would have been lost of saying,
“We brought that from Florence,” or, “When we were at Vienna,”
and the like speeches. Young Lacquer, whose continental gatherings
were confined to an enormous pipe, and some foreign jewellery, was
himself always talking of them. The last time we met him, we
believe that we offended him beyond reconciliation. He was, as usual,
descanting upon his Geneva watch, his Venetian rings, his Florentine
mosaic broach, and other articles; when we exhibited a knife which
we had purchased at Wolverhampton ; and added, after he had
announced his intention of visiting Greece next year, that we thought
ourselves of spending the summer at Birmingham. He never took
any notice of us again, and since then, we have ceased to visit the
family. Our ideas are far too low and common for the refined circles
we should meet at their house.
And so we will bid them goodbye; and leave them in all the pride
of their position. They form but one specimen of a class comprising
thousands, who appear to think that money alone is necessary to
attain distinction in the great world; and that an almost slavish
compliance with the most fiddle-faddle conventions of fashion can
alone ensure to them an eligible station in society.
We admit with sorrow that the prototypes of the Spangle Lacquers
form the greater portion of the middling circles; and we have
endeavoured in the preceding sketches, if they were too blinded by
their own lustre to see it themselves, at all events to show to others
the hollow motives which rule so many of our acquaintances in their
social ceremonies. And we fear all this will continue until people visit
only those whom they really have a regard for, unbiassed by show-off
interest, or, though last not least, the fear of what other people think.
As long as they give way to the opinions of their neighbours, they are
theslaves instead of the rulers of their circle,howeverindependent they
may pretend to be. When parties shall be given for the sake of
collecting together esteemed friends, instead of displaying plate and
crockery, this change will be effected ; but until then, the empty pomp.
of society towards those whom it affects to honour, will exhibit the
same aspect of dreary ostentation as the stand of feathers which the
undertaker carries on his head like a tray of pies, does to the corpse
it is intended to dignify.
WHYS AND WHENS.
BY An EMiNENT PROFESSOR,
WHAT is the difference between a soldier and a bomb-shell ?
One goes to wars—the other to pieces.
Why isn't a widow like her bonnet
Because one takes off and the other takes on.
When is a pig like peas in a gardent
When it requires sticking.
why is a rook's throat like a road
Because it's his caw's-way.
why is a corn-field gayer than any other f
Because it runs in rigs and has lots of larks.
Why is a cow's tail like a swan's bosom
Because it grows down.
why isn't a widow like a spoilt child
Because she don't get what she cries for.
why is Guy Faux always over-dressed
Because he’s done to rags in the morning and burnt to a cinder in
the evening.

THE SEASON AND THE GARDENERS.
The absence of frost during the present winter has been a heavy blow
to the frozen-out gardeners, to whom the mildness of the season has been
the severest calamity that could have happened. It is rather odd that,
when the frost operates on the gardeners, it generally freezes them to-
gether in parties of four, and observes a nice discrimination in congealing
at the same time those whose voices are adapted for glee-singing. We
seldom find a frozen-out tenor who is not accompanied by a bass, who is
also reduced to a temperature of thirty-two ; and congelation seems to
affect gardeners immediately after issuing from public-houses—a physiolo-
gical fact, for a solution of which we refer to Dr. Blumenbach. It is also an
ascertained phenomenon, that frozen-out gardeners are wholly ignorant of
the commonest gardening operation; and that the only vegetable produc-
tion they are in the habit of raising is the common cabbage, which they
elevate to the top of a pole, when they are labouring under congealment.

As Prize Essays are at present all the rage, Punch begs leave to offer
a prize of one of his Pocket-Books for the best Essay on the following
knotty questions:—
1st. Whether baked sheeps' heads could be found useful in relieving
the distress of the country; and whether anything is to be expected from
calves' heads ; and, consequently, whether any remedy may be looked for
from Parliament 1
2ndly. Whether the Whigs were induced to consider sugar and timber
together, in consequence of the little bits of stick one is apt to find in
coffee, after having sweetened it !
The Essays are to be sent sealed and wafered to the Punch Office, and
answers may be called for on the 1st of April, 1853, when our boy, then
promoted without purchase to the rank of man, will be in attendance to
deliver the prizes.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
chapter x.-on MERCURY.
MERcury was the son of Jupiter and Maia. Those who regard
Mythology typically, will view this statement as an allegory; and
consider that Jupiter meant iron filings, and Maia cinnabar; such
being the substances from which, by the application of heat, Mercury
is obtained at present. But those who prefer entertaining to useful
knowledge, will believe that Jupiter was the very Thunderer, and
that Maia was one of the lovely Pleiades.
The Pleiades were seven sweet nymphs who in life adorned this
lower world, and after death were translated to the skies. And
still their starry thrones are bright in heaven—all except one. This
is that of poor Merope, who, whereas she might have matched with a
god, demeaned herself by marrying a mortal. Therefore were their
stars made to exceed her star in glory. So goes the legend: but, most
sweet ladies, do not believe a word of it. Merope married the man of
her choice; and she was exalted, above earthly vision, out of sight
of this fortune-hunting world, to the pure empyrean, the third
heaven. But our present affair is with Mercury, not with his aunt.
Mercury had a fine appointment under the Olympic government.
He was the celestial herald, and the special messenger of Jupiter.
But there were several other important offices which he filled. He
was the patron of travellers, and of course of the Travellers' Club.
He was Grand Marshal of the Disembodied Spirits, whom he con-
ducted with his baton or caduceus into the nether regions. He
moreover presided over barristers, orators, auctioneers, declaimers
in general, and merchants. In short, he was quite a god of business;
and he was also the prince of pickpockets, rogues, swindlers, and
all and sundry dishonest persons. Consequently he must have been
in a general way the god of quacks and politicians; also of bill-dis-
counters, sheriffs' officers, and similar worthies.
Mercury, the very day on which he was born (he first saw the
light in Arcadia, on Mount Cyllene), gave evidence of a power
seldom so early developed—the faculty of abstraction. He stole,
took, and carried away, the oxen of one Admetus; while Apollo,
who was tending them, was either drunk, asleep, or star-gazing.
Apollo, however, found him out; but mistaking him for a common
young thief of a clod-hopper, was threatening him that unless he
brought the cattle back, he would shoot him dead; when, on
reaching over his shoulder for an arrow, he found that his quiver
had vanished. The fact was, that Master Mercury had stolen that
too during the very time while Apollo was blowing him up. At this
the eyes of Phoebus were opened, and he saw who his young friend
was, and, angry as he felt, he could not help laughing outright: so
he pulleå him playfully by the ear, called him a young rogue, and
let him go. This transaction is recorded by Horace in his Tenth
Ode: a sort of pagan Te Deum to Mercury's praise and glory, where-
unto, it seems, the poet considered stealing to redound.
The activity of Mercury’s “acquisitiveness” was further evinced
by his robbing Neptune of his trident, Venus of her girdle, Mars of
his sword, Jupiter himself of his sceptre, and Vulcan of his tools.
“These specimens of his art,” says the facetious Dr. Leinpriere, “re-
commended him to the notice of the gods.” The Doctor, probably,
meant to insinuate that the said gods were no small thieves them-
selves; if so he was quite right : though, to be sure, the rascalities
of a celebrated thief, one Mr. or Master John Sheppard, have recom-
mended him to the notice of a British public.
So high was Jupiter's opinion of Mercury as a rogue, that he made
him ambassador and plenipotentiary to himself and all the gods !
sagely considering that so great a knave would be an excellent diplo-
matist. Jupiter, as we have seen, was fond of playing Don Giovanni
now and then ; and on these occasions Mercury was his Leporello.
Not only did Mercury obtain place under Jupiter's government,
but perquisites also. Although he had got several great feathers, in
the shape of larcenies, in his cap already, his Majesty made him a
present of a cap with wings. He also presented him with an elegant
pair of winged sky-blue sandals, to which the celebrated locomotive
high-lows of Jack the Giant Killer were nothing at all. Apollo
gave him his caduceus, a handsome rod of ivory, entwined with two
gilt serpents, and possessing the most wonderful mesmeric properties.
It would send a patient to sleep sooner than the dullest speaker in
the House of Commons could, and, they say, would even raise the
dead. At all events, it could effectually raise the wind, and no
doubt, in the hands of a clever humbug, would do so still. This
valuable instrument was given to Mercury by Apollo in return for a
present of a harp ; which, as Mercury was a bit of a Jew, may be
supposed to have been a Jew's harp.
The achievements of Mercury were not simply predacious. He
honourably distinguished himself in the wars of the Giants against
Jupiter, in which he fought like a Turk, or if you will, a Briton.
When it is said that he fought like a Briton, it is not meant that he
used his fists, because at that time the Ring had not been developed,
except around the planet of Saturn : all that is intended is that he
displayed the most undaunted courage, and this under a terrific
shower of mountains. While blazing pine-trees were whizzing past
his ears, he remained firm and unshaken, like his Grace, the Duke of
Wellington, amid the red-hot cannon balls. It appears that he was
as valiant a thief as any one that ever existed :-from Alexander the
Great to Dick Turpin.
Another matter in which Mercury did the state—that is, the state
of Olympus some service,—a service of danger, was the execution of
a warrant on the body of a kingly Ixion. Ixion was offender, and
we all know how difficult it is to pull up kings—unless you first pull
them down. He was sovereign of Thessaly, and in that capacity was
graciously pleased to burn his father-in-law, Deioneus, alive in a
saw-pit for horse-stealing. He had bought the daughter of the said
Deioneus as a wife for a certain consideration, which appears to have
been a bill at six months, and when this became due he refused to
pay it, whereupon Deioneus made free, in order to indemnify
himself, with his stud. His majesty then thought fit to roast him, as
aforesaid; and he did so, without judge or jury. For this proceeding
(for which a few interesting parallels were furnished by that
exemplary Mussulman, the late Ali Pashaw), he was cut by all the
neighbouring princes very dead : but Jupiter, who rather admired
the man for what he had done, and felt that he should himself under
similar circumstances have acted pretty much in the same way, had
compassion upon him, took him up to heaven, and introduced him at
the divine dinner parties. Ixion repaid this civility by making
love to his wife; this too, was what Jupiter, could he have put
personal feeling aside, would have highly approved of, but as it was
he did not like it at all. He therefore resolved, as we say in the
vernacular, to “serve him out.” Accordingly he made a sham Juno
out of a cloud strongly electrified, -a thunder-cloud in fact, which he
insulated according to art, and put it in Ixion's way. The conse-
quence was that when that unlucky Lothario attempted to approach
it, it went off and knocked him down; whereupon Mercury,
who was in ambush behind an adjacent tree, rushing upon the
prostrate monarch, bound him, in spite of his kicking, hand and
foot. As Ixion was in every sense of the word a mighty prince,
this was a hazardous feat on the part of Mercury; very much like a
retriever's seizing a wounded heron. He accomplished it, however,
receiving no other injury than a slight kick in the stomach ; and

then by command of Jupiter conveyed the prisoner to Tartarus,
where he placed him upon a tread-wheel, which he has been continu-
ally turning ever since, except on one occasion when Orpheus stopped
it for five minutes with his fiddle-stick.
Another fine thing that Mercury did was, the slaying of Argus.
Argus was a gentleman who had a hundred eyes, of which two only
were asleep -
at one time.

appointed -
him to watch
a young lady
of the name
of Io, whom,
out of jea-
lousy, she had
changed into
a cow ; and
whom she
was afraid
her husband
would change
back again.
And so he
eventually
did ; but Ar-
gus was first
to be destroy-
ed; and this
job, that is to
say, Argus's
job, was done
by our friend
Mercury, who
first set him
to sleep with
his lyre, play-
ing, “O rest -
thee my Ar- :
gus ” to him :
from the sum-
mit of a rock,
and then cut
his head off.
Some will
have it that
he inveigled
him into the
“Jolly Bac-
chus,” and
there ho-
cussed him ;
others that
he mesme-
rised him,
and after-
wards suffo-
cated him
with a pitch-
plaster : it
may have been so, and it may not. Juno, with the eyes of her
favourite, adorned her peacock's tail. Jupiter, for this action of
Mercury's allowed him to take the name and arms of Argeiphontes.
Mercury being the god of knavery as well as of merchandise, of
course he sold a great many people as well as things. Among others,
he sold Hercules to Omphale, queen of Lydia. He also, according
to the above-mentioned Horace, enabled Priam to sell Agamemnon
and Menelaus, (who would have hanged him if they could have
caught him,) and to penetrate in safety to the tent of Achilles, to beg
the body of Hector, which would otherwise have been given to Poda-
lirius and Machaon for dissection.
The aliases of Mercury were very numerous, though he appears
never to have been indicted for his rogueries. His most common
name beside Mercury was Hermes; but in Egypt he was well known
as Latrator—“The Barker,” and represented accordingly with a dog's
head. He was a sly dog. In some instances he was figured as a
young man without a beard; probably to intimate that he was a
cunning shaver. Among the offerings which he was wont to receive
was the calf; perhaps because he took in calves. Hogs were like-
wise immolated to him, as he stuck at nothing, and was accustomed
to go the whole hog. Great sacrifices of tongues were made in his
honour among the Romans, who often sacrificed truth with their
tongues as well. Tongues are the instruments of blarney, of which
science he was the patron.
MONOMANIACS
An unfortunate creature was brought up charged with having a mania for
splitting open policemen's skulls, without any cause whatever. The unhappy
individual, for whom every one present felt the deepest commiseration.
had broken the heads of two policemen, and threatened to do the same thing
for the whole of the division to which they belonged. The policemen
whom the poor fellow had attacked, came into court to give their evi-
dence, and the state of their heads made every one feel sincerely for the
unhappy man, whose state of monomania must be pitiable indeed, to have
hurried him into the infliction of such extensive injuries as the police-
men's heads presented.
The following examination bf the prisoner, whose unfortunate condition
was the object of general commiseration, was then gone into.
. Magistrate.—What induced you to perpetrate this unaccountable
piece of violence 1
The prisoner returned no answer.
Magistrate.—What books do you read
Prisoner (sullenly).-Boxiana!
Magistrate (shaking his head).-Poor fellow, he must be taken care
of... (To the defendant). Where did you pass your time previous to this
unhappy circumstance?
Prisoner.—At the Duke's-head public-house.
Magistrate—Why did you .. the policemen's heads!
Prisoner.—Because they interfered with me !
Magistrate (in a tone of great feeling).-Poor creature!
awful condition of monomania he seems reduced to.
A medical witness was then called.
Magistrate.—Be good enough to state to me the result of a professional
examination of the unfortunate person at the bar.
Medical Witness.--When I examined him at the station-house, I found
his eyes fixed but his head rolling about, and, pathologically speaking, I
think the action of the cerebellum was increased to a high state of irritation.
Magistrate (somewhat wonder-struck).-Go on, sir, if you please.
Medical Witness.-The perceptive organs were no doubt a good deal
obscured; and this, acting on the moral propensities, added to a degree of
excitement which was probably local—considering that he came from a
| public-house—would in my opinion account for what has happened.
Counsel for the Prisoner.—May not a coagulation of moral agencies
existing coequally with a highly inflammatory condition of the muscular
fibres, produce such a result as that which is now the subject of inquiry
Medical Witness (after a few minutes' consideration, during which the
whole Court was in a state of breathless suspense).-I think it may
Magistrate—Then there is an end of the case. The unhappy man at
the bar is a subject of pity, not of punishment. (To the prisoner). You
will be taken where every comfort will be provided for you. Have you
any objection to go!
he victim of monomania answered mechanically, that he had not, and
has since been placed in the infirmary, where every indulgence will be
granted him, until he is in a fit state to be restored to liberty.
The decision seemed to give perfect satisfaction to every one, except
to the two policemen; but, as they are since dead, their dissent can be of
little consequence.
The friends of the monomaniac have applied to have him restored to
them ; and, if they give proper assurance §. they will take care of him,
their request will of course be readily acceded to.
What an
CLUB LAW.
It has been decided in a recent case, that a member of a club eannot be
punished for carrying away any of the property of the club, which is, in fact,
his own, as much as any one else's. At a late trial the judge laid it down,
that if the butler of a club, who is responsible for plate, prosecutes one of
the members for walking off with a part of it, the servant has the impudenee
to proceed against the master for his (the master's) own property. It is,
therefore, now thoroughly settled, that any member of any club may walk
into the dining-room, clear off the spoons and forks from every table, while
the act cannot be questioned by any one. We wonder that some ingenious
fellow does not resort to this proceeding—not, of course, for the sake of the
silver, but just for the fun of “trying the question.” That it has been
tried and decided in favour of any one who does it, can, of course, be no
objection, and indeed only strengthens the position of him who is willing
to try the experiment.

Punch hoped that, for some time at least, he had done with moonshine.
He finds it is not so. Since his last, when it was made known to the
world that an attempt to plate Mr. Moon (always, be it remembered,
patron of the Fine Arts, Threadneedle-street, London), was in progress,
Punch has received a thousand letters, all confirmatory of the public,
private, and artistic virtues of the distinguished visitor at Windsor Castle.
There is, we can assure the reader, but one feeling among the artists on the
matter: non-professional men, however, are anxious to contribute, as
Punch will prove by the subjoined –
MR. PUNCH,-I am not an artist, but nevertheless, though a windsor
tradesman (a dealer in perfumery and ...} I trust I have some grati-
tude. When I reflect upon the lustre which the frequent visits of Mr.
Moon (to say nothing of the lustre of his diamond-boxes, Russian rings,
Madagascar toothpicks, &c.) have cast upon my native town, I am anxious
to subscribe to the Testimonial. I said, sir, I was a dealer in soap ; and
when I reflect upon the peculiar transactions that have been upon the
hands of Mr. Moon, I think I cannot convey a more appropriate present
to that gentleman, than the accompanying cake of brown Windsor.
Your's, and Mr. Moon's admirer,
PETER WASHBALL.
MR. Punch,--I am a young artist—so artistically young, that I do not
yet know the taste of bread by my palate. Feeling, however, that it is to
R such patrons as Mr. Moon, that
I must henceforth look up (as
green goslings look up to the
poulterer), I am anxious to show
my appreciation of his pictorial
value. I therefore send you the
maiden effort of my pencil upon
box. The thing itself proves
that I am but a babe in the
wood; still, reject it not, for it
is wood, sir, that comes from
the heart.
You will perceive, sir, that
the subject is not very original. It is that of a humble and domestic bird,
arrayed in the plumes of the peacock. The thing is only pertinent as
being, I believe (if not, it ought to be), the crest of Mr M.
Whatever you may think the value of the above, pay in for me to the
“Testimonial;” for of course, those “minions of the moon,” who receive
subscriptions, do not refuse halfpence.
I remain, Sir,
Your's,
RAPHAEL Hogbrush.
For the present, this is all of the correspondence that Punch can find
room for. Punch thinks a couple of penny pieces sufficient pay for the
design of Mr. Hogbrush, and therefore holds himself accountable as
follows –:
The “ Moon Testimonial.”
Received - - . One cake of brown Windsor.
Paid in on the part of Raphael Hogbrush . 2d.
If Mr. Moon will call at our office, “our boy Dick” will hand over the
above to him. Further subscriptions will be announced in future numbers.
Important scientific Undertaking.
We are informed, that in consequence of insanity acquittals, chartist
insinuations, threatening letters, and other circumstances equally uncom-
fortable to men high in office, the Polytechnic Institution and Adelaide
Gallery have undertaken, for an adequate consideration, to electrotype all
the members of the Cabinet, and perfectly sheath then in copper, that they
may walk abroad in confidence. It was intended to extend the process
to the members of the Houses of Parliament as well, but some chemical
obstacles in depositing the precipitate upon a brass surface, has led to the
plan being abandoned. -
CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE.
It is generally understood, that had not the judges interfered to stop
the trial of M'Naughten, the prisoner's counsel were prepared with evi-
dence of insanity, which would have thrown far into the background the
testimony of Drs. Munro and Morrison. The public will appreciate the
very clenching nature of the proof of the madness of M'Naughten, when
we announce that a witness was in attendance to show that the truly
wretched and greatly to be pitied individual had for some months been a
regular subscriber to the Morning Herald.

AN INHABITANT of Oxford-street.—We really cannot say whether ºne
hackney-coach erpression of off the stones, will hold good with regard
to the wood-pavement. Technically we should say, nor.
ETYMoLogicus is right. There are four d’s in “fiddle de-dee.” Two in
“fiddle, and two more in “de-dee.' We shall be happy to hear from him
again.
Cadiensis.-The old fashion of taking mustard and salt with cheese has
quite erploded. It is now the custom, we believe, to take a pint, or half.

Julius.-" Sourkrout” is a popular dish amongst the Germans.
have never tasted it, but fancy we should not like it.
An AspinANT to Histrionic FAME – We cannot say what colour Mrs.
Mºt. eyes are. Mr. Macready's are either black or blue, we forget
which.
HENRY B"s.—The cells in the Albany-street Station-house are
shamefully neglected; and are only to be surpassed in coldness and
wretchedness by those of Worship-street. Marlborough-street is better
provided in this respect, but we decidedly agree with you, that the cells
of Bow-street are far superior in point of warmth, comfort, and
general accommodation, to those of any other police-office.
$33 (3 –The general price for washing a shirt is threepence, but we
have heard of washerwomen who charge fourpence. It depends princi-
pally upon the front—but a night shirt ought never in any case to be
more... than threepence. Stockings are three-halfpence a pair, and
handkerchiefs and collars a penny a-piece—at least, we never pay more.
Juvenis.--It is not compulsory to give anything to a crossing-sweeper,
nor can he refuse you a free passage over his crossing, even if you do not
give him a halfpenny.
If “HoRace” has actual proof that his landlady is in the systematie
habit of pilfering his tea and sugar, and of making free with his bread
and butter, he has a most unquestionable right to change his lodgings.
We should advise him, however, to reflect well, before he ventures on this
hostile, and sometimes very hazardous step, — perhaps it may be
necessary to give a week's warning.
SIMON.—Cromwell's christian name was “Oliver."
Statisticus-Valentine's day, we believe, generally occurs on the 14th of
February–and “All Fool's Day” always on the First of April. We
say “always,” because we never heard of an instance to the contrary.
Trao, who asks us how we would translate “horse chesnut” into French,
must earcuse us if we decline offering an opinion.
We beg pardon of “Antiquarian" for not being able to give him the date
he asks for in such a gentlemanly way, of the erection of Aldgate Pump,
but we are conninced it certainly was previous to the introduction of the
wood-pavement.
To “Jocular Joe,” who asks us the meaning of the old saying, “blind as
a bat,” we are sorry we can give no satisfactory erplanation. We
agree with him that bats do see as well as birds. We imagine that
the “bat” referred to must originally have meant a “brick-bat"—
which makes it much more intelligible, for every one can see that “blind
as a :*" is much more forcible and figurative than merely “blind
as a but.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
chapTER xI.
Domiestic HAPPINESS OF THE EARL AND COUNTESS BLUSHROSE.
PECULATION BY LORD TOOTLE'S MAID.
“You come in good time, my lord,” said the Countess, with icy
speech, “in excellent time for Mr. Inglewood's eloquence.”
“I am always happy to listen to Mr. Inglewood,” said the Earl,
politely bowing towards the wife of his bosom. His lordship then
graciously smiled upon his chaplain, and drawing a chair, ceremo-
niously seated himself, as though resigned to a long discourse. This
formality somewhat abashed the worthy chaplain; but there was
another circumstance which increased his confusion. He knew that
for the past week the wedded couple had not once met; and the
feigned civility interchanged between them gave certain omen of a
rising storm. Their general bearing was that of polished indifference;
but when either of them was stung into extreme politeness, hos-
tilities were sure to follow. The Earl could have loved his wife,
nay, when he married, he did love her; but she had chilled him into
coldness. Her excelling beauty had fascinated him ; but too late he
found that he had sacrificed his dearest hopes to a statue. The
Countess was that most terrible, but happily that rarest, evil of
creation, a selfish woman. Supremely arrogant in her personal
charms, her looking-glass presented her with all the external world
contained : whilst self—self—self sang to her soul a never-ending
lullaby. “Would to God "cried her husband, as one day he looked
upon her fatal loveliness with moistening eyes—“would to God she
could change that face for a heart I" She would not have bartered
one day's bloom of it for the maternal pride of a Cornelia.
“And now, Mr. Inglewood,” said the Earl, “now for your household
sermon. I see how it is,” he continued, marking the discomfort of
the chaplain, keenly observing too the cloudy brow of the Countess,
“I see how it is; as usual, you have been discoursing to her
ladyship.”
Here Inglewood inwardly shivered; for he knew by fatal ex-
perience how his lordship—otherwise kind and considerate towards
him, delighted to play him off in his churchman's character against
the Countess. It was, to the Earl's thinking, an exquisite touch of
policy to correct his wife—correct, did I say? no, the Earl had no
such desperate thought; but to punish the partner of his fortunes
with the rod of the church. The Earl, I say, considered this to be
a stroke of fine policy: some folks may call it conjugal cowardice.
“My lord,” said Inglewood, determined to make an effort to
extricate himself—“I will defer my suit—for indeed, it was a suit I
had to urge, and not a sermon, until to-morrow.”
“Certainly not,” Mr. Inglewood, cried her ladyship, affecting a
distrustful glance towards her husband. “Proceed, I beg of you. I
assure you, my lord, Mr. Inglewood was talking very charmingly—
very much so, when you interrupted us. I am sure he had something
of importance to communicate; something that you, doubtless, ought
to hear—I beg he will continue.” All this was said with meaning,
inquisitive eyes, and in a tone of suppressed suffering ; so admirably
did the unfeeling wife act jealousy—so perfectly did her very heart-
lessness assume a heart. At once, his lordship knew that he was
reserved for some mysterious mischief, and so resolved to make the
first attack.
(Poor Inglewood—poor chaplain And he—he was to be the
sentient shuttlecock, struck in cruel sport from wife to husband—
from husband back to wife . At that moment how did his heart yearn
for the Paradise of a Welsh curacy I)
“Her ladyship, Mr. Inglewood,” cried the Earl quickly, for the first
time in his life getting the advance speech of his wife, and valorously
determining to keep it—“Her ladyship—for all she may affect
towards yourself—has, I know, the greatest veneration for your worth,
your honesty. She loves plain-speaking dearly ; though perhaps it
might be impolitic at all times to avow it. Still, Mr. Inglewood, you
must not be too ascetic with her ladyship; you must be a little indul-
gent. You must not wage such a deadly crusade against piquet. I
know what you have said of a woman gamester; I have listened with
great edification to your description of the terrible sect; have really
shuddered at the frightful picture; at the anatomy, I may say, you
have prepared from what for all good purpose has ceased to live—a
lady gambler; nevertheless, my dear Mr. Inglewood"—and here
his lordship wreaked such cordiality upon his remonstrance—“never-
theless, you must not confound a casual instance with a custom ; you
must not consider her ladyship a hopeless idolater of painted laper,
if now and then—to give wings to a heavy hour—she takes a hand or
so. Really, you must not, Mr. Inglewood.” Thus spoke his lordship;
and in the vanity of his masculine heart he thought he had achieved
a wondrous triumph over the woman he had vowed to love and
cherish. The lady, however, who had as strongly sworn, proved her-
self at least an equal match for the man she loved, honoured, and
obeyed. As for Inglewood, he sat with his lips glued together. The
polite vehemence of the Earl had kept him silent: now, her ladyship
was about to speak, and he knew that nought remained for him but
to suffer. With what scorching softness in her eyes—with what
bitter self-complacency—with what an obtrusive sense of martyrdom,
—did the Countess Blushrose carefully construct a handful of inuen-
does, every one of them enough to wound a woman's peace for ever.
“I’m sure, my lord,”—(if a man could be killed by music, the
mortal melody of her ladyship's well-educated voice had certainly
slain her husband,)—“I’m sure, that is I hope, I am always a
patient listener to Mr. Inglewood. I know the goodness that prompts
him ; the conscience that animates every word: I know his devo-
tion to the high and abstract character, as I think I have heard
you call it, you see, my lord, how I treasure all your syllables,
yes, the high and abstract character of his function.—I know his
regard for the family—his especial consideration for ourselves, and
therefore from him can bear anything. Nevertheless, my lord, as I
was saying to Mr. Inglewood when you entered—that is, I was about
to say—I would not have him scold you as I know he does. He
must not take upon common report—the world is so censorious, the
world so delights to destroy wedded confidence—what I never can
believe, at least not all of it. And therefore, my lord, I say he must
not scold you.”
Has the reader watched a well-grown kitten with its maiden
mouse Has he seen how that velvet-coated, playful creature, having
first crushed its victim's loins with all its teeth, drops it; and now,
crouching apart, with serene assurance that the miserable wretch
cannot escape, watches with sweet forbèarance its writhings and its
strugglings, the very hopelessness of its agony to get away . How
the said kitten, its claws humanely sheathed, they having already
done their work—puts forth one paw, and now taps the mouse on one
side—now on the other—and turns it over and over—and all in play
—all in the prettiest sport;
If the reader has seen this, sure I am, he can find a parallel in
wife and husband to puss and mouse.
“No, Mr. Inglewood,” continued her ladyship, “his lordship has,
I know, his faults; still, he is not the unscrupulous libertine”—
“Madam I" exclaimed his lordship, firing at the word, and then
turning fiercely round upon his chaplain,_*Mr. Inglewood, what
is this 1*
Mr. Inglewood, in patient amazement looked at the wedded pair.
then asked, “What, my lord?”
“Am I, sir, indebted to your insinuations for this character Is
it thus, in my own house, you fulfil a mission of peace f"
“I protest, my lord,” stammered Inglewood, “I protest I”—
“Oh, Mr. Inglewood is a plain speaker,” cried the Countess, de-
lighted at the success of her artifice. “And then so faithful, so
vivid an artist, too ! I am sure I am delighted with the portrait that,
as you tell me, my lord, Mr. Inglewood has passed off for me. It
must have been so grateful to a husband,-so flattering to his wife :
And then it is so comfortable to have at one's elbow a kind remem-
brancer of one's little faults. Not that I want to know all your
lordship's treasons,—and even if I did, Mr. Inglewood is so good, he
would never tell me all.”
The chaplain was by nature and self-discipline a meek, forbearing
man, but he was full of generous impulses, and the implied slander
of her ladyship was too much for his patience: he therefore com-
mitted a great breach of decorum; for, ere her ladyship had well
concluded her sentence, Mr. Inglewood brought down his clenched
fist upon the table with such a report that the Countess leapt in her
chair with a slight shriek. “Mr. Inglewood P exclaimed the as-
tonished earl, -“you forget yourself. Do you know, sir, what you
are f*
“Yes, my lord,” replied Inglewood, with sudden calmness—“no
longer your chaplain. I entered your lordship's service as a minis-
ter of peace: I will not—no, my lord, will not—to suit the fickle
humours of the great, be made a scapegoat and a firebrand. I am no
longer, sir, youn servant.”
“Come, come,” said the really good-natured nobleman, “not so
hasty, Mr. Inglewood. Spoil not your hopes in life by a piece of
temper.”
“My hopes in this life, my lord,” said Inglewood, “are a quiet
conscience, health, and a cordial faith, let them make what mistakes
they will, in my fellow-creatures. Of these three hopes, it may please

“Mr. Inglewood—I have been wrong; I confess as much, and "-
“My lord,” replied Inglewood firmly, yet respectfully, “I have
been wrong ; and by quitting your service can make the only repa-
ration due to myself: understand me, my lord—to myself. I now
know my place: it must be my own house—my own roof–though
wind and snow drive through it ; my own hearth, though with scarce
a log to warm it; my own time, that I may work to know the mystery
within me. I thank you, my lord, with all my heart I thank you,
for this relief from bondage. You intended kindly by me : but, I
feel it, my lord—I should dwarf and wither under your patronage:
I should never grow to be a man t”
“You know best,” said the Earl, resuming his dignity. “I would
not by my favours blight a giant. Cone, come,” said the Earl
smiling, “you are a young man—a very young man. Let us talk of
this to-morrow.”
“My lord,” answered Inglewood, “I have made my election; I am
free. Yet, my lord, let me leave your house a peace-maker.” Then
turning to the Countess, he said, “Will your ladyship grant me a
moment's hearing for what I have to say must interest you.” Her
ladyship nodded dignified assent. “I would plead for a weak and
foolish woman. She has betrayed her trust. Yet, I believe, ’twas
pride, a vain and foolish pride—no deep sin—that beguiled her 1"
“What woman’s this 1* asked the Earl.
“One beneath your roof, my lord. One of your tenant's daughters,
hired to tend your child. This morning”—
“Ten thousand pardons, my lady,” cried an elderly, hard-featured
woman, bursting into the apartment, “but flesh and blood can't bear
to have such doings made nothing of. If Susan isn't packed off,
nobody's safe. I knew his reverence here wanted to talk her off—
but — I — I beg your pardon my lady, for breaking in—but every
body's character must suffer.” Here the ancient dame, with her
apron corner, carefully dislodged a small tear from either eye.
“What's the matter, Mrs. Pillow—what has Susan done " asked
the Countess.
º half-a-yard of lace from his lordship's cap,” answered Mrs.
Pillow.
“Not stolen—not stolen,” shrieked a girl, as she rushed in, and
with streaming eyes fell at the feet of the Countess. “I never had
a thief's thought—never : nurse said 'twas of no use—none ; and I
only took it to remember me of that sweet child—I love it dearer
than my own flesh—to remember it when I should be old and baby
be a man.”
The girl, with clasped hands, looked with passionate grief in the
face of the Countess. Her ladyship rose, and fanning her cheek with
me—new from the Prince's coronet—said, “Send the culprit from
the house, and instantly.” -
The girl fell prostrate on the floor. Mr. Inglewood followed the
Countess with his eyes, as, still waving me to and fro, she walked from
the room. “God teach you better mercy " he said in a low voice,
and then stooped down to raise the heart-stricken offender.

The DUKE OF YORK'S COLUMN.
This magnificent structure, which consists of the base and the shaft,
while the Duke himself supplies—what he never could supply when alive
—the capital, is selected as a subject for one of our descriptions of
London Interiors.
The entrance door is approached from the park by walking straight on,
and from Waterloo-place by describing a semicircle from the back of the
column. The door is a square piece of workmanship, after the model of
those to be seen at some of the small houses in the suburbs, and it presents
a flat surface, broken only by the keyhole, which is picked out with a chisel,
and bound round with brass-work, of more solidity than beauty. The door
is guarded by the civil power, and though there is a military station in the
neighbourhood, the sentry with considerable delicacy never interferes in
any of those disturbances which arise on the adjacent steps, giving active
employment—between the hours of ten and four—to the cane of the
civilian alluded to. On reaching the door you are permitted to pass upon
terms printed on a board, and placed so high that it is impossible to read
them. It has been said by some that the price of entering the column is
stated to be threepence on the board, but as this is a point that cannot
now be solved, it is customary to give a piece of silver to the custodian.
On entering the column, the eye being suddenly withdrawn from the great
glare of the light outside, becomes at once insensible to surrounding
objects. The grandeur of the place is of course considerably heightened
by this sensation, for mystery is the mother of the sublime; and nothing
can be more mysterious than the position in which one finds one's self after
having entered the column. There is a post of stone, round which the
stairs wind, and which post you first become acquainted with by knocking
your head against it; and then—but not till then—the guide gives you
an intimation of its existence. Your conductor then precedes you; and
as he ascends rather noiselessly, and the flight of steps is almost perpen-
dicular, you are liable to receive his heels now and then upon your fore-
head. But these are inconveniences which, in the pursuit of a great
object, no one could think of complaining about.
Our sketch being confined to the interior, we shall not accompany the
reader further than the door at the top ; but we may observe, that it is
not uncommon “to come down with a run;” for the same steepness that
made it a work of labour to ascend, causes one to retrace one's steps with
sometimes inconvenient rapidity.

With what uncommon art endued

THE LORD MAYOR'S TRIP DOWN THE THAMES.
Consider ABLE excitement has been occasioned in Thamesian circles by
the appointment of an inquest to sit on all the wooden piers along the
river. The Lord Mayor, who was towed by Waterman No. 7, left the
stairs at Blackfriars on Saturday, amid a salute of laughter from the
heights, and scudded away, under a column of smoke, towards Greenwich.
His lordship was in his usual health, and more than usual spirits, con-
versing affably with the man at the helm, and jocosely pulling, at times,
the wrong rope of the rudder, with a recklessness of danger that is not
often met with on the western side of Rotherhithe. On reaching the
Tunnel, the Lord Mayor proposed three cheers for Brunel, which were
given as a solo by his lordship, none of the crew taking the liberty of
joining him.
The sight at this instant was extremely imposing. The gallant vessel,
with her gib full in the wind, and her crew making a desperate effort to
luff so as to bring her mizen tort athwart the southern shore, the captain
with his glass to his eye, as if gallantly determined to go on rather than to
put about, the coxswain, a frost-bitten veteran, coolly washing out a smal
tin saucepan at the head of the gallant craft, while the Lord Mayor him-
self, forming a centre to the vigorous tableau which we have drawn, com-
pleted a picture such as naval writers only could conceive and a nautical
reader appreciate. The little squadron at length reached the wished-for
haven, and hove to with glorious precision, amid signals from the people
on shore; and when the rope splashed into the water below, and sent some
of the liquid bubbling into the air, such was the excitement that there was
scarcely a dry eye among the bystanders.
On landing, his lordship proceeded to know the result of the inquest on
the piers, when a frightful catalogue of hostile judgments was handed to
him. Nearly the whole of the Thames pierage was condemned, and the
Lord Mayor, placing the black hat on his head, passed sentence accord-
ingly. Several of the piers were declared to be “crazy,” and the decision
of the Court was certainly enough to make them so.

MR PUNch,--There is a most annoying blunder going the round of the
Press. It begins thus:–“Last night, the French Company at the St.
James's Theatre, were honoured by the presence of ; ” and then
follow fifty high names, from Dukes and Duchesses of the blood royal, down
to simple knights and their ladies. Now, sir, this is a gross error. It is
true that all these distinguished people did last week visit a theatre, but
that theatre was Drury Lane. Is it likely that the aristocracy, who boast
so much refinement—so much patronage of the arts and literature of
their own country—would be thus frequent in their attendance on French
vaudevilles, to the utter neglect of Shakspeare and the high drama of
England Pray, Mr. Punch, correct this error ; assure the town that
these high people did not flock to see Le Portrait Vivant, but—Much

It is a shame that the aristocracy should be slandered by such malevo-
lent reports.-I remain, your obedient servant,

IDreadful Clause 1
Jord Howick complained, the other night, of a clause in the Regis-
tration Act, on the ground of its “destroying the relationship between
father and child.” This is a curious effect of a legislative enactment.
We know that a bill of divorce can “destroy the relationship between man
and wife,” but that a clause in the Registration Act should make a child
not the son of his own father, is more than we can solve with all our
acuteness. The Poor Law Act is considered bad enough in dividing the
mother and her offspring, but a measure that cuts off a man's heir, and
deprives him of the sunshine of his own son, must be a piece of legislation
so atrocious, that we have turned in vain to the word “horrid” in our
dictionary, for epithets sufficiently strong to apply to it.
Why should a quill pen never be used in inditing secret matters?—Because
it is apt to split.

Dear Mister Bright, I’m grieved to see,
The League has been abusing me.
The League is wrong, and I am right ;
Echo me, do dear Mister Bright.
It was the Chronicle that said it,
But there of course I never read it;
"Twas in the Quarterly Review,
Which, as a Liberal good and true,
I of the Chronicle take in lieu.
Write by return, and say there is no room,
Dear Mr. Bright, for censuring Lord Brougham.
Letter II.
Thy letter though I did receive,
I can't say what I don't believe ;
I really do not think thee right.
I am thy friend sincere, John Bright.
Letter III.
Dear Mister Bright, I thought you had
A better memory—you're mad 1
Your mind is very much inflamed ;
I'm sorry that you can't get tamed.
'Tis party spirit makes you fume
So fiercely 'gainst Yours truly, Brougham.

I think the League deserved to be
A great deal better used by thee.
I cannot say that thou art right ;
Because, sir–Truly yours, John Bright.

Dear Mr. Bright, I really wonder
At the delusion you are under—
Oh I do you think you’ll be believed
You're really very much deceived.
This is too much for even you
To have assumed--retract then do.—
You came to me, to make the motion ;
I did it out of pure devotion.
You urged me in the private room
Down at the House—Yours truly, Brougham.

A foe to Corn-law's prompt repeal.
I say so, and I know I'm right,

To you again I’ll never write;

On this or anything whatever.
Send me my letters back I fume

advice that could be expected from that quarter would be advice not to
visit it. Whether commerce could be carried on with that remote region
is doubtful. The rush of bears would be likely to strike a panic into the
minds of speculators, particularly as Captain Ross failed in his efforts to
break the ice in the quarter alluded to.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CABINET AND COLONEL SIBTHORP.
OUR Colonel has been somewhat irate with Her Majesty's Ministers.
A few nights since, being (unfortunately) in some other man's place in
Parliament, the Colonel thus delivered himself:—
“He was utterly astonished that there was no House last night. He thought Ministers
ought to be called to account for not having been present. They were well—too well
paid (a laugh)—for attending to the business of the country; and the country had a
right to expect that they would be in their places when so important a measure was
coming on. He should like to know what Ministers were doing at the time they ought
to have been in the House. (A laugh.) He had no doubt they were much more
improperly employed than if they were attending in their places. (Laughter.)”
This is very severe. Mark the “more improperly employed" than iſ
in the House—impropriety of employment being, by the logic of the
Colonel, inevitable to the Ministry: the question of degree consists in
their being in the House or out of it.
We are happy to be able to state that the friends and connexions of
Ministers, fearful of some onslaught by the Colonel, straightway sent the
gallant member satisfactory testimonials of the good conduct of the
Cabinet. Some of these letters we are allowed to print. The following
is from Lady Peel:—
“Lady Peel presents her compliments to Colonel Sibthorp, and begs
to assure him that Sir Robert was at home on the evening alluded to by
Colonel S. Should the Colonel require such testimony, Narcisse, Sir
Robert's valet, is ready to be examined before the bar of the Commons,
and to depose that his master took gruel at 11, and retired to rest at
half-past. Lady Peel trusts that this state-
“This is to certify, that the Right Hon. Henry |
Goulburn was unavoidably absent from the House 2-
sibility upon myself of forbidding his quitting 3
his apartment.
ment will entirely satisfy Colonel Sibthorp.”
The second is in the case of the Chancellor of
the Exchequer—a certificate from his dentist :—
of Commons on the night in question, he having ſº
in the morning cut a wisdom tooth 1 Under so ( {
extraordinary a circumstance, I took the respon- --
“S. CARTwright.”
/.
ſ / Ž &e
The third is from an Under Secretary of Lord j . | /*
Stanley:—
“Sir, –Permit me to say one word in behalf of my excellent principal,
Lord Stanley. On the night when there was no house, His Lordship
overslept himself. After dinner, he fell into a profound repose, and even
with difficulty awakened at six in the morning. It was then discovered
that his Lordship had unconsciously lain upon a newspaper—his head
falling precisely on a reputed speech of Colonel Sibthorp's. What,
however, could have induced such extraordinary somnolency is still a
matter of speculation among his friends. Perhaps Colonel Sibthorp may
be able to solve the mystery.—I remain, your obedient Servant,
“Colonel Sibthorp, M.P.” * G. W. HoPE.”
These are all the letters which we deem it sufficient to publish. We
are happy, however, to state that they completely mollified the Colonel;
who, by the way, further stated in his speech that, hating railways as he
did, he had neverthless risked his neck in a train to be at St. Stephen's,
and after found—no House. We trust the worthy Colonel will never
again run a similar risk. We assure him he cannot serve his country
better than always to travel to Parliament by the very slowest “patent
safety;” nay, he is so precious we would trust him to nothing more rapid
than the most leisurely waggon.
THE “POST * AT THE OPERA.
A woSDERFUL creature has made his descent upon The Morning
Post / ... It is not generally known, but this paragon of animals, who
“does” the Opera, is at the present moment a claimant for the long-
dorinant title of BLETHERANskate—yes, if he succeed, the man now known
as nothing more than PETER JENkins, will be the Earl of BLEther ANskate.
That he has the true aristocratic ichor in his veins, his writing (writing,
ºlo we call it —inspiration, we should say)—sufficiently proves. Take the
following burst:—
“Ever since the Italian lyrical drama crossed the Alps in the suite of the tasteful
Medicis, its vogue has daily increased, it has become a ruling passion—it is the quintes-
sence of all civilised pleasures, and wherever its principal virtuosi hoist their standard,
there for the time is the capital of Europe, where the most illustrious, noble,
elegant, and tasteful members of society assemble.”
We do earnestly hope that Jenkins—(we must call him Jenkins until
his claim is duly recognised)—will keep this profound truth from the
knowledge of the singers and dancers. Only suppose that in a moment of
irritation—and we have heard that such people really are at times a little
given that way—only imagine them in a fit of the sulks to take ship for
Sidney, or Adelaide, or Macquarrie Harbour: there immediately would
be “the capital of Europe.” JENKINs, be an Englishman. Would you
destroy your country? Would you deprive us at once of the “most
illustrious—noble—elegant—and tasteful ?” For the sake of the nation
scatter not these firebrand truths.
Jenkins proceeds:—
“These ornaments of society are in general absent at the too early opening of her
Majesty's Theatre—but on Saturday, as we surveyed the house, previous to the overture,
most of those who constitute society in England—those whom we respect, esteem, or
love, rapidly filled the house.”
We have always thought her Majesty's Theatre too small, and this
proves it. If only part of what “constitutes society” fills the theatre,
what is to become of the other section 1 But “society 1" how beautifully
the Earl comes out here ! With a fine aristocratic spirit, he melts down
millions of Englishmen, and extracts therefrom—in the persons of about
two thousand people—“society 1"
But let us proceed:—
“Every seat in every part of it was occupied, and if those objectionable spectators
were there-those gentlemen of ambiguous gentility, the fashionable couriers, valets,
tailors, and shoemakers, who obtain admission to the pit on the strength of knowing the
measure of some actor or actress's foot—they, and their frowsy damnes, were so nailed
to their benches as not to offend the eye.” “
Now, reader, can you not sympathise with the sufferings that have pro-
duced this horror of tailors and shoemakers in the breast of JENKinst
See him in the pit. He rises—looks airily about him, then falls, as though
shot, upon his seat. And wherefore 1 Alas! he has caught the eye of
his tailor in the pit—his long-suffering, unpaid tailor: he turns him round
—ha!—dreadful apparition! there is the very shoemaker whose trusted
cordovan of three years' wear still protects the feet of JENkins. There-
upon, great is the indignation of the Earl at tailors and shoemakers, and
more especially if accompanied by their “dames” in the pit of the Opera !
JENKINs at length makes a rush for it ; when—
“hastening through the corridors to procure a book of the opera, no where to be found,
we first encountered an illustrious and kind-hearted Prince, and the next moment, in
our awkward haste, we stumbled upon England's hero, moving along with a step as
youthful and energetic as his last speech in the House of Lords.”
Here the transcendent modesty of Jenkins shows itself; for he sup-
presses two incidents, for the truth of which -
we can vouch, having them from a witness
thereof. The “illustrious Prince,” when en-
countered, in the handsomest way begged to
exchange snuff with Jenkins; and the Duke
of WellingtoN, “stumbled upon” in his
“speaking step,” took off his hat, and making
the lowest bow to Jenkins, said, “My very

PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER XI.-RELATIVE TO MINERVA.
MINERva was made entirely out of Jupiter's own head; that is,
Jupiter conceived her in his brain, just as you would conceive an
idea. Her exact birthplace has not been satisfactorily ascertained,
because physiologists cannot tell us precisely whereabouts in the
brain ideas are hatched; but, upon the principle, “medio tutissimus
ibis,” we may most safely conjecture that it was in the middle ven-
tricle. This cavity, too, lying just in front of the pineal gland, which,
they say, is the seat of the soul, would be conveniently situated for
the lodgment of a mental embryo.
So rapid are the operations of thought that Jupiter had not had
Minerva in his head five minutes when he was seized with an in-
tolerable headach. In vain did the anxious Juno, forgetful of her
wrongs, bind the temples of her husband with her hankerchief; in

vain did she bathe them with Eau-de-Cologne; he grew every
moment worse—it became necessary to send instantly for Apollo,
and accordingly Mercury was despatched for him post-haste. Apollo
was then tak-
ing his diurnal
drive across the
heavens; direct-
ly he received the
summons, he put
his horses to a
gallop, and the
sun went down at
noon. He then
hastened to the
Court, where he
found Jupiter
holding his head
between his
hands, swaying
his body from
side to side, and
roaring with pain.
The God of Me-
dicine, at once
perceiving the nature of the case,
which was rendered the more
manifest by one of the symptoms
complained of, namely, a singing
in the head, being distinctly audible
to the bystanders, recommended
an operation for the patient's relief.
Vulcan officiated as surgeon, and
performed craniotomy very cleverly
with a hatchet ; whereupon Minerva, armed like a Joan of Arc,
and fully grown, sprung up like a Jack-in-the-box from her father's
brain. The wound, by the application of a little solar tincture which
Apollo prescribed, healed almost immediately; and although the
corpus callosum and fornir had been necessarily divided, there was
no subsequent impairment of the intellectual faculties; and Jupiter
in two hours' time, was enjoying himself with a pipe and a glass of
nectar, hot.
Now the foundation for the above legend very probably was, that
Jupiter was some old Greek who conceived the plot of a farce, and
Apollo a literary gentleman who worked it out;-but this by
the way.
We are all of us fond of our crotchets; no wonder then that
Jupiter was partial to his bantling Minerva. He instantly made her
a deity of the A division; it would be almost correct to say that he
made her A l; for he constituted her the goddess of Wisdom; and
what higher dignity could he have conferred upon her than that
Such was his confidence, too, in her, that he allowed her the control
of thunder; a rather dangerous thing to trust a fool with, as we
should find, were it at the command of men, who have made wild
work enough with gunpowder, as it is. He gave her, also, a patent
for life-pills, which enabled her to prolong human existence to any
term ; and he permitted her to grant licences to prophesy. More-
over, he empowered her, as the goddess of intellect and taste, to
place a veto on all publications and works of art that were in-
elegant or stupid ; the penalty in case of disobedience, to be ever-
lasting contempt. In the present day the authority of Minerva
is impudently set at nought, and Irish stories, trumpery Magazines,
and other productions of the like merit, studiously adapted to the
meanest capacities, by being divested of all wit, humour, and pur-
pose, a shade above vulgar comprehension, are monthly inflicted
on the world, to be reduced in due time to their proper deno-
mination :-that of waste paper.
Minerva was the tutelar deity of Athens; ancient, not modern
Athens, be it observed : for “canny Edinbro’” is rather under the
presidency of Mercury. Athens was originally called Cecropia;
which name was altered to Athens in honour of Minerva, who was
termed by the Greeks Athena. There was a great dispute between
her and Neptune whether the city should be named after herself or
him ; and to settle this point there was summoned a general meeting
of the gods, and Olympus resolved itself into a committee of the
whole court. The determination of the powers celestial was, that
the question should be decided by open competition, and that which-
ever of the two divinities made the most valuable present to mankind,
should enjoy the litigated privilege. Nothing could have been fairer
than this, of course. First, Neptune had to give proof of his judg-
ment. “Here goes " he exclaimed, and plunged his trident into
the earth; whereupon up sprung a fine charger caparisoned ready
for the field. “There, my lass, beat that if you can,” cried the
god of the sea. “Now for my turnſ" said Minerva; and taking
a little fresh water in her helmet, she poured a libation on the earth.
Immediately a fine olive-tree, loaded with produce, ascended from
beneath the puddle. “What do you think of that " asked the
goddess of the surrounding immortals; who without answering
her made a simultaneous rush at the fruit, which they knew
would relish excellently with their nectar. But, Jupiter having
reduced them to order, they determined, unanimously, that oil was
better than bloodshed any day, and an improvement to a salad was a
finer thing than an advance in military art. Accordingly, Minerva
was declared the winner; at which Neptune, looking rather sulky,
“Never mind, old boy,” said Jupiter, “do you see yon little island in
the north-west ? There—hoist your telescope; you'll know it by the
white cliffs. That shall be yours; you’ll find it worth having one of
these days, when Athens will be a heap of rubbish.” Hereupon, he
allowed a slight glimpse of the future, in the shape of a panorama of
Portsmouth harbour, to dawn upon the mind of the Ocean King,
-
whose grim features relaxed into a smile, and who, with an “Ay, ay!”
- of acquiescence, sat down
to his nectar-grog, and en-
joyed himself in the con-
templation, through the
curling wreaths which as-
cended from his cheroot,
of the future glories of Bri-
tannia.
It has been already inti-
mated that Minerva, in her
literary capacity, would
stand no nonsense; nor
would she indeed, in any
gºes:

way. There was a certain Ionian young lady of the name of Arachne,
daughter to one Mr. Idmon, a respectable dyer. Arachne was very
handy with her needle, and not only could work slippers in Berlin
wool, and all that sort of thing, but would have eclipsed even the
celebrated Miss Linwood. So conceited was she of her skill, that
she defied Minerva to work samplers with her for a fancy fair. She
chose for her subject the gallantries of Jupiter; but her performances
were mere caricatures by the side of Minerva's : and so ill did she
brook her defeat, that, disgusted with all other work, she “worked ”
herself “off.” She did what was since done by the unfortunate
Miss Bailey; but Minerva, whose resentment extended beyond the
noose, transformed her into a spider.
Clever young ladies often lead a single life. Whether it is that
their intellect leads them to prefer celibacy, or acts by repelling
admirers, it were tedious to inquire; but it is certain that Minerva,
who had made a vow of virginity, might have married had she chosen.
She had one offer, at any rate, from Vulcan, who, being rather too
pressing in his suit, was dismissed with a flea in his ear—that is to
say, a box on it, and likewise with an obscuration of the eye, and
sundry lacerations of the visage. But Vulcan was decidedly a fright,
and not only very ugly, but the reverse of clean ; moreover, he was
lame, and had another wife besides. The question is whether Minerva
would have said nay to such a divinity as Apollo. She was the death,
however, of one young man; his name was Pallas; he was the son of
Tartarus and Terra, and an immense giant. He died, though, not of
her beauty, but by her hand; and it is said that she dressed herself
in his skin; but for “skin,” we should probably read “small-clothes.”
Hence it was that she got the nickname of Pallas, a title which she
did not refuse, though she declined it “with a difference " in the
genitive case.
Minerva, we are told, was the first who built a ship, which if she
did, it is likely that she invented steamers. The invention of the
flute also is ascribed to her; but that cannot have been the German
flute. And yet it must have been something like it; for Minerva is
said while playing it to have made the most ugly faces, which, on one
occasion, aflorded high diversion to Juno and Venus. Minerva had
no idea what they were laughing at, and demanded, with some
asperity, what was the joke. “My dear,” they replied, “only look at
yourself in the glass.” She did so, and was so disgusted with herself,
that she threw the instrument away in a pet, wishing ill-luck to any
one who found it. It was found by one Marsyas, who, in consequence,
had the slight ill-luck to be flayed alive.
Though not of a quarrelsome disposition, Minerva would often
interfere in battles: generally in order to take somebody's part.
Indeed, she was represented for the most part with helmet, spear, and
shield, on which last was sculptured the Gorgon's head; a bugbear of
such terrific ugliness that it literally petrified the beholder. It con-
sisted of a demon's face surmounted by a periwig of serpents; and
was certainly by no means a pretty thing to place on a mantel-shelf.
Her helmet also, was surrounded with griffins, which griffins were
probably so many heads of Medusa on a smaller scale. The goddess
herself was made to look rather like a griffin ; at least, somewhat
masculine in appearance, which is not a pleasing peculiarity in a
young lady.
Minerva had a favourite bird, which, were one to guess, one would
perhaps suppose to have been the parrot ; it was, however, the owl,
this creature having been esteemed the bird of wisdom because it
looks so very wise, and was in face so much like the philosophers of
antiquity. There is a sort of Lord-Chancellor-like look about the owl.
Among various other names, Minerva was often called Glaucopis
on account of the blueness of her eyes; but there is some reason to
believe that she also wore blue spectacles, which frequently go along
with blue stockings, whereof Minerva was the patroness. The young
ladies who take notes at the Royal Institution may consider them-
selves as her peculiar pets, as also may all geological and botanical
beauties, and damsels of like tastes who are not beauties.
Minerva is supposed to preside over mechanics' institutes, literary
and scientific associations, and particularly over the Grand National
Association for the Advancement of Science ; but whether she
really does may be disputed.
Why is the cramp like a hearty dinner on veal?—Because it takes a good
twist of your calf.

The PANTHEON.
OH, dome capacious ! venerable pile !
When 'neath thy column'd portico I stand,
Fast o'er my features darts the patriot's simile,
To think it is within my native land,
There stands a building so extremely grand.
Britain they often call thee Freedom's home,
But why I neither ask nor understand.
Enough for me that I can freely roam
About the streets, and gaze—on the Pantheon's dome !
Thy walls were once devoted to the strains
Of young Apollo, with his thrilling lyre,
Until—as modern history explains—
One night thy grand interior caught fire,
Up flew the flames—higher and higher, and higher, -
Until they seem'd almost t'outstrip the air.
Too great the sum, alas ! it did require
To put thee into regular repair,
After the damage done by such tremendous flare
And there neglected wert thou doomed to stand
For many a weary night and dreary day.
Extremely useless, but immensely grand :
Thy landlord trying every niggling way
To make thee—if 'twere but the ground-rent—pay :
Letting thee out, what sacrilege l—odds-oons !
My cheeks still mantle while the truth I say,+
Unto an aeronaut for his balloons—
I've seen them hanging there—on idle afternoons.
But even more ignoble still thy fate 1–
How to my face, e'en now the warm blood gushes,
When I the melancholy fact relate —
That to one Tubbs (who whilom dealt in brushes)
A part of thee was leased ; for such, oh such is
Weak man's short-sightedness, that ne'er, I trow,
Did thy proprietor conceive how much is
Made by the use to which they’ve put thee now.
His fortune he'd have made—but that he knew not how !
Where the Italian pour’d his dulcet strains,
And the conductor did his baton wield,
The keeper of the Hall now counts her gains,
And, sometimes revelling in fancy's field,
Anticipates the sum the day may yield –
But poesy has born me on her wing
So far, that reason's founts are half congeal’d.
I'll drink no more of the Pierian spring,
But dash my harp away—and cease, yes, cease to sing.
But why, alas! am I compell'd to smother
The feelings throbbing through my fever'd brain
Oh, holy Nature best and kindest mother,
Shall I resume my broken harp again
Ah, no l the effort would be worse than vain.
Crack'd are its notes, disorder'd is its pitch,
Wild and unpleasant, then, would be its strain,
That harp—whilom in melody so rich—
I'd rather cast it down—in some dark, dank, damp ditch.

This venerable body met last week for the purpose of hearing the
report of a committee that had been appointed to sit upon a square piece
of flag-stone, which had been removed from beneath some rubbish on
clearing the ground for the new Royal Exchange. The stone was pro-
duced, and seemed to be an object of intense interest. The committee
reported that it was crustaceous in its outer coats, and had been clearly
used as a flag ; but by whom, or when, or why, there were no means of
ascertaining. From the venerable appearance of the relic, it was sup-
posed to have been the flag that “braved a thousand years;” and, having
passed a resolution to this effect, the meeting broke up perfectly satisfied.

It is a remarkable fact—showing the contradictions that sometimes
occur, and the curious anomalies occasionally to be met with, it is, we
say, a very remarkable fact, that while the number of lunatics has been

readers of the Herald have been at the same time diminishing.

A BROAD canicatures
On Tuesday last a large meeting of the actors of the establishment
was held on the stage of the English Opera House, to take into con-
sideration the present crisis of affairs. The Lion of the company
was called to the chair. He said, “The present meeting had assembled
owing to a report which had spread through the dens that Mr. Van
Amburgh intended to put them upon half-rations. He for one would
not stand this ; and might he never wag his tail again if he accepted
one ounce less of his salary than he had been accustomed to receive.
He worked hard, – had never missed a single rehearsal, - and he
defied any one to say he had ever been ‘ hoarse' or ‘suddenly
indisposed on any one night he had been announced to play. (Hear,
hear !) Why, then, should his beef be cut down If Mr. Van Am-
burgh was not pleased with his services, and no longer thought he was
worth what he would fetch, why didn't he let him go? (loud cheering
from every member of the company.) Why didn't he let every one of
them go (Renewed cheering.) As long as either of the National Theatres
was open, they need never be at a loss for an engagement. Thank
Heaven, a British audience never failed to support them, and he felt con-
fident they had only to throw themselves on the public to cause such an
outcry against Mr. Van Amburgh as would make him tremble in his
highlows for his dastardly conduct in having sent them adrift. (Hear,
hear, from the Panther.) He thanked his noble friend for that cheer, for
it convinced him that private differences were buried between them, as
they should be, on an occasion like this, when it behoved every quadruped
to stand up like a man, and make common cause with his fellow-beasts.”
The noble chairman sat down amidst loud and prolonged applause. The
Elephant, with great difficulty, then got up, and said, “that to be put
upon half-rations would, considering the quantity he required, affect him
ten times more than anybody else; in fact, it would quite incapacitate
him for study, and entirely ruin him for his profession. He had borne
enough lately. He could tell them it was no joke having a man sitting
upon his tusks every night, and pulling his trunk about as if it were
nothing better than a bell-pull. Was, then, an Elephant to be bullied and
blackguarded for nothing? Might he be taken for a madman, like his
poor relation Chuni, and sent to Bedlam if he put up with it for
only half the miserable quantity of hay he was in the habit of drawing
from the treasury l’’ (Applause.) After the Bengal TIGER, the BAY
MARE, the little White Pony, and the LAUGHING HyAENA had severally
addressed the meeting. the PANTHER proposed a vote of thanks to the
Lion for his able conduct in the chair, which was carried without a dis-
sentient roar, and the meeting broke up just in time to allow the ring to
be sawdusted for the evening's performance. -

April 1.—AII ſools' Day.
Who has not heard of the superior wisdom of our ancestors 1
Who does not acknowledge the surpassing intelligence of the perri,
powdered and bob wigs of bygone years : If any proof were want-
ing that our forefathers were as wise as they are declared to be by
the conservative oracles of the present day, let it be remembered
that it was necessary, in the good old times, to set aside the First of
Apart for the express purpose of fool-making. In our degenerate
era such a red-letter day is un-needed—fools are now as plentiful as
blackberries. Where would be the jest in sending Sibthorpe for
“a boiled icicle?” or Lord Brougham for a “pen'orth of pigeon's
—nay, dove's milk 1"
$3mnct repudiates the idea of making any more fools, and has,
therefore, set apart the present number of his humorous periodical
for the dissemination of pure and unadulterated facts.
Some, indeed, may be sufficiently incredulous to doubt the correct-
ness of the annexed statements; but Punch has only to refer such
sceptics to his particular friend and disciple, H. R. H. the Duke of
Cambridge, who is ready to attest the truth of most, and the proba-
bility of all.
OPENING OF HUNGERFORD BRIDGE.
This interesting ceremony, which has been so long looked forward to,
took place on Tuesday last; the structure being at last completed, and
forming a proud memorial of what can be accomplished by the united
efforts of patience, two men, and a boy.
It having been promulgated that the bridge would be opened by his
R. H. the Prince of Wales, the most extensive preparations were made
to give éclat to the whole concern. At an early hour in the morning, the
King William Street crossing was swept remarkably clean by the Broom
Stick in Waiting; and kept so at intervals during the day. About eight
the tradesmen commenced taking down their shutters; and the cheap
fishing-tackle shop was decorated with fresh posters, which being put
outside the window, gave an air of great festivity to the shop-front; and,
emulating the tapestries of the olden time, costly paper-hangings were
suspended from a window in the Lowther Arcade. Several hundred
gallons of water were distributed gratuitously from the Market Pump
during the forenoon, to whoever liked to apply for it, reviving many as-
sociations of Ye Fleete Conduite in former pageants. The waterman at
the Charing Cross cab-stand also put on his light highlows with the
wooden soles, as well as his monthly shirt; and the horde of Trafalgar
Square was decorated with fresh and exquisite engravings and many-
coloured devices.
Precisely at twelve o'clock the procession left St. James's palace, and
proceeded through the Park and Horse Guards, and along the Strand, in
the following manner:—
A Puano Organ.
Boy Dick,
who had left the office on the sly, and was
playing a concerto on the patent street-
Castanets.
Ancient Knight,
Sir — —, in a scaly suit, going to his
bank.
Boys. Boys.
Some people coming the other way.
Two Policemen.
Bearer of the Standard,
or newspaper of inpatient expectaney,
collecting news in that journal for old gen-
tlemen learning to spell at the various
taverns.
The Morning Post,
preceded by attendants sprinkling the pave-
ment with rose-water, and surrounded by
constables to keep off the vulgar classes.
More people coming the other way.
- Two Policemen.
Masque of Pomona and Bacchus,
performed by a tipsy coalheaver and a rebellious apple-woman being con-
veyed to Scotland Yard.
The Morning Chronicle,
with a stalk of free corn stuck up the collar of his coat behind.
==E=------
Band of Glass Bugles,
carried by a milliner's errand-boy to a customer.
H.R.H. The PRINCE OF WALES,
in a go-cart of gilt mahogany, preceded and followed by his nurses,
attendants, &c.
Rattle Bearer in Ordinary.
Boys huzzaing. Boys hussaing.
THE TIMES,
not choosing to give in to the opinions or orders of anybody, but walking
by himself, and making everybody get out of the way.
Charity Boy,
performing a solo on a musical pear.
More people coming the other way.
Two Baked Potato Merchants.
Policemen, Vagabonds, Passengers, &c.
The Morning Herald,
rather behind time, very carefully carried in a sedan-chair, with the
windows up, for fear of catching cold.
On arriving at Hungerford Market, the freedom thereof was presented
to the Prince in a polished oyster-shell; and he was then invited to an
elegant cold collation of shrimps upon the wharf below. . His Royal
Highness proceeded to eat their heads and tails indiscriminately with
great condescension ; and having signified his wish to possess a lobster
that caught his eye, it was immediately handed to him, when he nursed
it in the manner of a doll.
All the preparations being concluded, a salute of spare steam was dis-
charged from the funnels of the Twilight and Daisy steamers lying at
the pier. And amidst the cheers of the thousands, the go-cart containing
the Prince was then slowly drawn across the bridge, followed by the pro-
cession above mentioned, precisely at half-past twelve. Having reached
the Lambeth side, the cortège returned, and the thoroughfare was then
thrown open to general passengers, six of whom passed in the course of
the day, the net proceeds amounting to threepence.
His Royal Highness was then taken to the Lowther Arcade, that he
might select any toy he took a fancy to, from a halfpenny whip to a half-
crown Noah's ark. He, however, chose a box of soldiers—an interesting
proof of his inherent military ardour—and displayed extraordinary per-
severance, in sucking the whole of the paint from the drummer, before
he got home.
Thus terminated this gratifying proceeding, unattended by any acci-
dent or unpleasantry. Thanks are due to all parties concerned ; and
especially to the owner of the market weathercock, who fixed the point
of the arrow at N.E. the night before, that dry weather might be ensured
for the important ceremonial.
MORE LUNAR caustic.
How old is the publisher of Threadneedle-street t "asked Sibthorpe of
Ferrand. “Look for Moon's Age in the Almanack,” was the reply.
“Ah ! I see,” said Sibthorp, “and here is something about Moon's First
and Last Quart. I suppose that is the tankard they talk of giving him.”
Ferrand answered, “Well–I never met such a ,” and concluded
the sentence confidentially to his coffee-cup.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GRAND ROWING MATCH.
oxford tierstus CAMBRIDGE.
The GREAT ANNUAL Rowing-MATCH. — This event, by which public
curiosity has been so much excited, took place on Wednesday last, on
the Paddington Canal.
This match, which was from the Basin at Paddington to Uxbridge, and
back again, has opened an entirely novel era in the science of rowing, as
the channel of the Paddington canal is so narrow that it would appear
difficult for the eight-oared cutters to pass each other, setting aside the
obstructions of barges, monkey-boats, locks, bridges, or tunnels.
It has now, therefore, become essential, that the crew of each cutter
should, by a powerful simultaneous spring, accompanied by a vigorous
feathering of the oar in the air, cause the light boat to ascend from the
water after the manner of a flying fish, and completely to overtop and
clear any obstacle, and indeed, occasionally, to go over the heads of the
crew of the adversaries' cutter.
The tide of the Paddington canal serving, the boats started precisely at
twelve o'clock, on the signal being given, a pistol fired from the steeple
of Paddington church.
Oxford took the lead, although it appeared that the strength and muscle
of both boat's crews were pretty equal. This advantage was effected by
the dexterity of the Oxford coxswain.
The competitors had scarcely passed the bridge that leads to the Harrow
Road, when Light Blue (Cambridge) determined to exhibit a specimen of
their acquired dexterity in the new system of managing an eight-oared
cutter, and by a violent, but well-directed, effort, the crew arose to a man
from the water, and propelled themselves through the air to about a boat's
length a-head of Dark Blue (Oxford), and alighted safely on the stream
like a swan. This occurrence, which was not expected to have been
attempted at so early a period of the race, put the Oxford men completely
on their mettle, and every energy was exerted to get up again to the
Cantabrigians for the next fifteen miles, when a favourable opportunity
presented itself, by reason of one of Pickford's barges having grounded,
heavily laden with bricks, which brought the Cambridge cutter to a momen-
tary stand-still ; this was instantly observed, and taken advantage of by
the Oxonians, who, notwithstanding the †: labour they had undergone,
practised the same feat of agility which had been performed by their
antagonists, and not only sent themselves flying through the air over Light
Blue, but absolutely over Pickford's barge into the bargain.
The gentlemen of Cambridge, finding their chance apparently desperate,
made a powerful effort of eight-oared volition, and cleared the unlucky
barge, and, pulling with all their might, again got up to the Dark Blue.
After some excellent manoeuvring, the Oxonians rowed round a boat
moored off the weighing-house at Uxbridge, and exerted themselves with
great vigour for their return to Paddington, the tide having turned exactly
at the same time : and here Oxford kept the lead until they had reached
Wormwood Scrubs. And now, drawing within a few miles of the winning
place, both boat's crews recommenced the flying and feathering in the air
in a wonderfully exciting and interesting manner. At length, Cambridge,
making a strenuous effort, kept up aloft one minute longer than Oxford,
and fell flop into the Paddington Basin first, thereby winning the race.
The banks of the canal were lined the whole distance with well-dressed
spectators.
The Leander crew are practising the same novel evolutions, daily, on
the New River.
THE EARTHQUAIEE.
The earthquake in the north appears to have given general dissatisfac-
tion, and it is pretty evident that unless these affairs adopt a more regular
and rational mode of procedure, they will altogether lose favour with a
British public.
The earthquake of last week, instead of coming at the business-like hour
of 9 o'clock in the morning, as at Calabria, must needs creep in at the dead
of night; and by rattling the windows and glasses, shaking the beds, and
other paltry and despicable pranks, cause unnecessary consternation and
alarm.
Consequently, instead of being taken for a respectable, dignified earth-
quake, it gets the credit, in most instances, of being a pettifogging house-
breaker.
We are gravely told by the Manchester Guardian, that a lady labour-
ing under the impression that it was a burglar, sprung out of bed, and
throwing up the window, called lustily for a policeman; one happened to
be passing at the time, to whom she communicated her fears. He assured
her, however, that her silver spoons were safe, and quietly begged her not
to be alarmed, as it was only an earthquake.
We have always prided ourselves upon taking matters coolly ; but here
we candidly confess our inferiority to Policeman Z 11. An earthquake!
pooh beneath his notice.
We shall use our influence in getting Zll promoted to the rank of
deputy sergeaut.
METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.
MR. DENT, the celebrated chronometer maker, has at length
succeeded in completing his arduous task of inserting some ingenious
clockwork in the interior of the
statue of George the Third, in
Pall-Mall.
The great difficulty has arisen
from the artist being compelled to
pass all the mechanism through 2
the nostrils of the horse, and ad-2
mirably has he succeeded !
Though the statue will not be
publicly set in motion until twelve
o'clock to-day, we can speak from -
our own observation of the natural and -º
perfect manner in which this new wonder |
works. The action of the horse is beyond
all praise. We subjoin the plan by which
this admirable effect is produced.
We cannot sufficiently express our ad-
miration of the manner in which His - -
Majesty's pig-tail is made to contribute to the general effect.
For the space of thirty seconds it pendulates in slow time
→
and then undulates for
the same period, as :—
It is but right to
'add, that Messrs. Ran-
som, the bankers, have
contributed the whole
of the funds for this
praiseworthy undertaking; and the artist has
gracefully expressed his high sense of their pa-
tronage by the gracious and condescending bow ". .
which the king makes to the customers of Messrs. ,'
Ransom, as they pass in and out of the banking-
house between the hours of nine and five.
A CHANGE HAS COME O’ER THE SPIRIT OF THE “TIMES.”
The readers of Punch must have noticed the present epidemic for
illustrated newspapers; but what do they say to the TIMEs becoming
an illustrated newspaper? It's a fact, nevertheless—the TIMEs, for the
future, is to be published with engravings, and will appear every morning
with not less than fifty illustrations. An additional wing has, for this
purpose, been added to the extensive premises in Printing-house-square;
and the proprietors, regardless of expense, have engaged Mr. Landells, the
eminent wood-engraver, to undertake the management of this new branch
of their establishment. Edwin Landseer has accepted an engagement
as reporter in the House of Commons, and, from his fine perception of
the brute creation, will, it is expected, render the debates intelligible to
every capacity, by introducing portraits of the members. B. has
likewise been engaged. He has gone to Paris to attend the sittings of
the French Chamber of Deputies. The leaders, too, will be illustrated,
though the name of the artist has not yet transpired ; but the proprietors
have secured the services of no less an artist than Sir Martin Shee, to be
in daily attendance at Bow Street. Under this new arrangement, not a
criminal will appear at the bar, not a monomaniac will be examined
without having his portrait accurately pencilled in the morrow's paper,
for the admiration of thousands who, otherwise, would be denied the
moral gratific.tion of seeing him. Artists have been sent to each
quarter of the globe, and every earthquake will have its destructions
most vividly described by illustration—every revolution will have its
bloodshed and horrors most effectively portrayed in black and white ;-
and the weakness of a written report will no longer be felt. Prospectusses
will be issued in a few days.
3rribal from the Cºast.
ConsideBABLE excitement was this day manifested by the people in the
line from Woolwich to the Blackfriars' Road. At an early hour it was
known that the gates of Somnauth had been landed from the Whacker.
74, at Woolwich, and would be brought to their final destination in a
spring van, hired expressly by her Majesty's government for the occasion.
Expectation was, however, on tiptoe as to the purpose to which the im-
mortal trophy was to be applied. The excitement grew with every step—
the crowd thickened with every instant. At length the van stopt at the
appointed goal; when the public were delighted to discover that the gates
of Somnauth were destined to replace the worn-out doors of the Magdalen I

A PRESENT TO BROUGHAM.
His Grace the Duke of Wellington this day forwarded (per Parcels-
Delivery Company) a very beautiful spaniel, as a present to Lord Brougham.
It is a most affectionate and delightfully fawning little creature; though
it has, to be sure, once or twice laboured under the slander of hydro-
phobia, snapping and snarling at everybody. To the Duke, however, it
has of late shown the greatest affection—licking his hands, his feet, and
swallowing every morsel that may have fallen from his lips, with a great
wagging of the tail, and other indications of extreme delight. It has,
however, been a matter of great regret that the dog, in its puppyhood, was
never wormed. The spaniel's name is WAux.
GREAT MEETING OF THE BISHOPS.
This day, a meeting of the episcopal Bench was held at Lambeth
Palace. At an early hour, the lower end of Parliament-street,
Bridge-street, Westminster Bridge, Bridge-road, Bishop's Walk, and
other great arteries leading to the Palace, were thronged with crowds,
drawn together by the tidings that the Lords Spiritual had deter-
mined upon holding a solemn convocation, for a most Christian and
philanthropic purpose. All the windows in the various lines to the
Palace were crowded by people in their best attire. High and low,
young and old, flocked together to do homage to the event. The
children of the parish school of St. Margaret, &c., were ranged along
the road, holding such green boughs as the season afforded in their
hands. As the carriage of every bishop rolled solemnly by, cheers
rose on all sides—ladies waved their handkerchiefs, and flung bunches
of violets from the windows; then swelled a hymn from the innocent
bosoms of five hundred school-girls—then gushed the manly eye with
the sympathetic tear, and “the babe leapt up in its mother's arms.”
It was a beautiful, an entrancing sight, to behold the approach of
every right reverend father—(in his very handsome carriage, drawn
by steeds with coats sleeker than the hair shirts of martyrs)—to mark
the graciousness with which every bishop received the cheers and
blessings of the crowd, bowing the head, as though the dew of
heaven descended upon it; and putting up (what was evidently) an
inward prayer for the success of the gracious purpose of that day. The
cheers and blessings of the people accompanied every bishop to
Lambeth Palace; where, on arriving, every Spiritual Lord was
ushered to the gallery. At twelve o'clock all the bishops had arrived,
when the Archbishop of Canterbury took the chair, and the Bishop
of Chichester (as junior of the Bench) said a short prayer.
THE PRIMATE of All ENGLAND then opened the proceedings of the
day. He had called his dearly beloved brethren about him in con-
sequence of the publication of the Report and Appendices of the Children's
Employment Commission. His brethren must have read those documents.
(Hear, hear.) As Christian shepherds of the flock, their hearts must
have been lacerated by the frightful, the appalling details contained
in those reports. He would ask them, what would the rest of Christen-
dom say of them when they should read those details : Would they
not ask—has England any church at all Was it possible that she
could have bishops, deans, prebends, vicars Of what value could
the immortal soul of man be held in England, when men, and women,
and babes, were left as a prey to the evil fiend—left to the ferocity
of their own untutored passions? It was his fervent prayer that his
dear brethren would that day wipe off a stain from the purity of the
episcopal lawn—that they would join heart and hand to prove them-
selves shepherds of the Christian flock. (Cheers.)
THE Bishop of LoNDoN rose to propose the first resolution. Never
(he said) since St. Augustine first landed on these shores—never
since the blessings of Christianity were manifested to the British
savage, was it more necessary than at present to vindicate the
humanity, the all-encircling charity of their faith, than at this
moment. And how—he asked—were they to vindicate it ! Not
by lip-service. (Hear, hear.) Not by wishing well to humanity
from the air-cushioned seats of a carriage, but by following the
example of the first Christians; by mingling with their fellow-crea-
tures ; by making common cause with the griefs, the wretchedness,
the misery of human nature. (Cheers.) He would read a few extracts
from the documents alluded to by the most noble Primate. He would
quote from Mr. HoRNE's evidence on the condition of the operatives
of Wolverhampton:-
* I have entered the houses and hovels of journeymen locksmiths and key-makers,
indiscriminately and unexpectedly, and seen the utmost destitution; no furniture in the
room below but a broken board for a table, and a piece of plank laid across bricks for a
seat; with the wife hungry-almost crying with hunger—and in rags, yet the floor was
rfectly clean. I have gone up stairs, and seen a bed on the floor of a room seven feet
ng by six high at one side, but slanting down to nothing, like a wedge, where a
husband, his wife, and three children slept, and with no other article in the room of any
kind whatever except the bed.”
This physical destitution was terrible, but let the meeting listen to
the evidence of their spiritual forlornness :-
WILLIAM Benton—“Thinks that's his name; can't spellitrightly. Age, don't know
justly—mother says he's turned eighteen. Can’t read or write; can tell some of his
}. Goes to a Sunday-school sometimes: Is of the Baptist school religion, whatever
that is. Never heard of Moses; never heard of St. Paul. Has heard of Christ; knows
who Jesus Christ was—he was Adam. Doesn’t care much about going to school if he
could.”
(Here an involuntary cry of grief burst from the assembly. After
a moment the worthy Bishop continued.)
HENRY WooD “Is seventeen. Can read a little in the Testament; likes the large
letters at the top of chapters best for reading. Cannot write; they don’t learn in these
parts. Leads a hard-working life—sometimes fourteen or fifteen hours a-day, with
about an hour or an hour and a half out in the course of the day. Does not know how
many Disciples there were ; does not know who Jesus Christ was—thinks he was an
Apostle; they don't learn the Catechism here, else he could tell about him, but thinks
he was a king of some kind, of London, a long time ago. Does not know how many
inches make a foot.”
To this (said the reverend prelate) Mr. Horne adds:—
“None of the depositions here written down are to be attributed to confusion or
timidity. If the witnesses were timid or confused upon ny question, I either waited till
it was over, or else gave up the point. Some of the extreme and almost incredible
statements (such as the witness thinking that Pontius Pilate, or Goliath, were Apostles;
that the witness had never heard the name of Jesus Christ, &c.) are the result of repeti.
tions of the same questions, especially in the case last mentioned, either under a different
form, or after an interval during which I had asked other questions.”
He (the Bishop of London) shuddered whilst he read these fright-
ful records. He must, however, continue. Mr. Horne had further
said:—
“You will find poor girls who had never sang or danced; never seen a dance; never
read a book that made §. laugh; never seen a violet, or a primrose, and other flowers;
and others whose only idea of a green field was derived from having been stung by a
nettle.”
What followed was, however, more terrible :-
“Many of the ehildren told me they always said their prayers at night, and the prayer
they said was, “Our Father.' I naturally thought they meant that they repeated the
Lord's Prayer, but I soon found that few of them knew it. They only repeated the first
two words: they knew no more than “Our Father l'. These poor children, after their
laborious day's work, lying down to sleep with this simple appeal, seemed to me inex-
pressibly affecting. , Having nothing but harsh task-masters in this world, or ‘working
º: their Father,’ it was probably the only true sense in which they could use the
words,
(Having with difficulty read this, the reverend prelate was so much
affected that some minutes elapsed ere he could regain his composure.
He then proceeded as follows.) Whet would Christian nations say
on reading these things What would—he would ask what—what—
but his feelings were too much for him ; he would conclude by nov-
ing the first resolution, that “it is incumbent upon this meeting for
the bishops to look personally to these things.”
The Bishop of Exeter rose with alacrity to second the resolu-
tion. The time was come to act. (Hear.) They had often attended
meetings at Exeter Hall, and talked much; but the time was now
come for every man to take his staff and scrip, and to go a Christian
pilgrimage into the benighted districts of England. (Cheers.) To leave
the luxury—the sinful luxury of ease; to enter the hovels of the
manufacturers; to descend into coal-mines—(loud cheers); to fight
ignorance with the sword of grace; to heal the wounds of the suffer-
ing with the salve of charity. He cordially seconded the resolu-
tion, which was unanimously carried.
THE Bishop of Nonwich moved the second resolution. It was to
create a certain fund out of their own incomes—(here the speaker was
interrupted by loud bursts of cheers)—for the temporary relief of the
wretched. He must own it—he could not wonder that the people at
Wolverhampton, and in other districts, thought Pontius Pilate to be
an Apostle; for from the fruits they tasted of what passed for
Christianity, how, indeed, could they think otherwise 1 (Cheers.)
THE Bishop of SALIshu Ry. It had made him tremble to listen to
what had been read. When they (the bishops) repeated the Lord's
Prayer, how different were the gifts prayed for in it to the bounty
asked by the poor He would put it to his brethren, what it was
they meant by “daily bread”—and what, the poor? Had he known
the amount of ignorance, of misery endured by his fellow-men in the
districts alluded to, he had never been able to sleep quietly in his bed.
With all his heart he seconded the resolution.
The Bishop of HEREroad wished to know if their Parliamentary
duties might be, with safety to the public, neglected during their
sojourn in the moral wildernesses of England
THE Bishop of Sopoa AND MAN thought his brother of Hereford
might rest quite easy on that head. For himself he had been, he
hoped, a studious reader of his Testament, but he could not charge
his memory with any text that made the laws of customs and excise,
turnpike acts, &c., matters of daily interest to the Apostles.
The Bishop of CHEst ER proposed that each bishop should start
by the railway to-morrow morning (with one carpet-bag and his
banker's book) for his diocese. There might have been some objec-

tion to sabbath-travelling, but under the present circumstances, the
motive would be sufficient.
This resolution was seconded by the Bishop of Petensonough,
and unanimously carried. The meeting then separated in most
seraphic humour.
All the bishops returned to their homes on foot.
ARRIVAL OF THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR.
IS Chinese Excellency Low Slang, Am-
bassador from the Court of Pekin, having
left his native land in a junk, hove to
in front of Dover, under a salute from
the batteries. His arrival not having
been expected, no preparations had been
made, and the salute was an accidental
honour arising from the fact that a gun
at Dover Castle having been recently
cleaned and repaired, happened to be
tried just as the Ambassador landed.
His Excellency was dressed in a rich
travelling suit of chintz bed furniture,
and was looking remarkably well. He
wore over his shoulders a Mackintosh,
exchanged with one of the Hong Mer-
chants for a small quantity of tea, and
his head was encased in an oilskin sow-
wester, which he had purchased from
one of the seamen in the course of the
voyage.
Immediately on landing, he was re-
ceived with three hearty and truly
British bursts of laughter from a few
stragglers on the pier, and was escorted
under a guard of honour from the
Custom-house to the searching room.
The officers were proceeding to deal with his Excellency rather roughly,
when Low Slaug beginning to pour forth an address in his native tongue,
the discovery was made of his being the Chinese Ambassador.
Suspicion was at once turned into respect, and information given at the
station-house, when the whole of the police on duty (six) turned out in
single file, and formed a guard of honour. The Inspector not being in
attendance, the Sergeant, with singular presence of mind, gave the order for
taking the oilskins off the hats; and while the Ambassador waited for his
carpet-bag, the Inspector put his men through a few manoeuvres in
splendid style, in presence of the illustrious stranger.
cheer from the bystanders; and at the words “Shoulder capes,” when the
entire force were suddenly enveloped in oilskin down to the shoulders,
|almost as one man, a look of astonishment, not unmixed with awe, was
| observable on the countenance of the Ambassador.
It is well known that in China the great festival of the year is the feast
of Lanthorns; and Sergeant K, of the Dover division, who takes in
Chambers's Information, and was aware of the fact, had the happy idea
of putting the force under his command through the whole of the difficult
and admirable Lanthorn exercise. At the first word of command “Draw
lanthorns,” the entire body (the whole six) suddenly placed their right
hands under their coats on the left side, and with a flourish that would
have done credit to a troop of regulars, drew forth the accoutrement
alluded to. The well-known operations of “Support lanthorns,” “Recover
lanthorns,” (including the snuffing of the wicks) were extremely well done;
but at the words “Present bull's-eyes,” the whole glare of the six lanthorns
was thrown directly into the eye of the Ambassador, who drew back a few
paces, and uttered a few sounds in his native tongue, supposed to have been
expressive of satisfaction, or in other words of his having had enough of it.
!. order to keep up the spirit of this extemporaneous review, so happily
unpromised by Serjeant K, the men were drawn of in gallant style towards
a drunken man; and the more active evolutions of the police force were º
skilfully exemplified. The whole body (the six) rushed in a sort of melée
towards the inebriated individual, and having taken close order, reduced
the enemy at once to a powerless state, by concentrating all their force-
after the fashion of Napoleon—on one point, that point being the head of
the foe, which they assailed with dauntless valour. The entire force then
formed a compact square, of which the enemy was the centre ; and then,
dividing into two columns, they flanked him in ; while one column took
charge of the right hand and leg, the other column making themselves
masters of the left hand and leg of the enemy. After this beautiful
manoeuvre they marched their prisoner towards the station-house.
The Chinese Ambassador being now anxious to retire to his quarters for
the night, went on foot towards the hotel; and such was the respect shown
by the inhabitants, that several of the juvenile portion followed closely at
his heels, and thought themselves honoured if they could only touch the
end of one of his three tails, which they did repeatedly. On reaching the
hotel, the landlord, who had heard of the partiality of the Chinese for
chops, served up two of the finest ; and an Italian company of musicians
—with hand-organs—happening to be in the town, one of the chief pro-
fessors played for some time beneath the window.
Our resources are so exclusive that we have been the first to record the
arrival of the Chinese Ambassador at Dover; and perhaps, for very shame,
none of our contemporaries will corroborate our statement. Those of our
readers who doubt us, will perhaps proceed to Dover to make the inquiry.
The rapidity with which, at the words “Carry staves,” the whole of the
six men drew forth their wooden weapons, was responded to by a partial

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

T H E COM ET.
We have received the following letters on the subject of the Comet:—
To the Editor of Punch.
SIR,-The other day, after I had been dining at the Freemasons'
Tavern, I walked home through the principal thoroughfares, and it ap-
peared to me, when I got to Charing Cross, that there was a very strong
glare in the atmosphere. I looked up, and I saw a strong light, which I
might, perhaps, have mistaken for the Boccius, but that is a fixed light,
and the one I saw had a rapid whirling motion, which there was no mis-
taking. I was, at the same moment, so overcome with the atmosphere
.."; sunk down, and did not return to consciousness until the next
morning, when I found myself in a cell in the station-house, whither I
had been very properly carried by the authorities. The light I saw, added
to the fact of my being suddenly overpowered, leaves no doubt of its being
the Comet.
Your obedient,
DANIEL DINEouT.
The next letter is from a scientific man, and deserves attention :-
To the Editor of Punch.
WATER Loo BRIDGE.
Having read in the papers the letters signed South and Herschel,
on the subject of the alleged Comet, I beg to say that I took up my
station on Waterloo Bridge at midnight, for the purpose of pursuing my
observations. At a latitude of 26 from the toll-gate, and in a longitude of
8 from the English Opera House, I observed a very luminous appearance.
About 14 degrees from the constellation Van Amburgh, and 6 from the
satellite Carter, between the Great Bear, and not in the Milky Way, but
over the way from the foot of Wellington-street, I distinctly saw a round
luminous body, which I at first believed was a Comet. Upon looking
closer into it, I found that it was the illuminated clock over the trunk-
maker's. If you will give insertion to this, or communicate its contents
to Dr. Herschel, you will greatly oblige,
Yours, truly,
SiMox STARGAze.
We have also received the following from the Great Western Railway
station :-
To the Editor of Punch.
The Secretary of the Great Western Railway having seen reports of a
Comet, with a long tail attached, having been visible from Greenwich,
begs to suggest that it may have been the engine called the Comet, which
started at about the time mentioned, with an unusually long tail of car-
riages attached to it. Though the longitude and latitude are described in
scientific terms, to induce the supposition that the phenomenon was really
astronomical instead of railroadistical, the Secretary begs to say that
longitude and latitude are no guides, for scientific men go to great lengths,
and allow themselves most extraordinary latitude.
A MR. Jones, of Camberwell, writes to say that he saw the comet dis-
tinctly in the Adelaide Gallery, during the astronomical lecture. It had
a blue tail, and moved upon a very eccentric orbit. We ourselves have
not seen it at all, never having looked after it, as we were not favoured
with the usual complimentary admissions for a private view.
Total Destruction of the Nelson Column by Fire.
WE stop the press to announce this unfortunate catastrophe. The in-
auguration of the statue took place yesterday, when Trafalgar Square
was thrown open to the public, and the horde removed ; and the confla-
gration broke forth the same evening. It was first perceived by the
sweeper at Charing Cross, who observed smoke issuing from the cocked-
hat of the statue, and immediately gave the alarm. The flames soon
burst out, and caught the iron railings at the top, which burnt with
furious rapidity; and the stone being equally inflammable, the whole
erection was soon in one perfect blaze, illuminating the metropolis for
many miles round. The doorkeeper was severely injured by the melted
stone, which poured like a cascade down the circular staircase, and the
burning flashes of iron were carried by the wind to inconceivable distances.
Fears were at one time entertained for the magnificent flagstones in front
of the National Gallery, which several times caught fire, but were
speedily extinguished by being covered with unsold copies of the Spectator,
obligingly furnished for that purpose by the proprietors. What makes
the occurrence more lamentable is, that the erection was not insured in
any of the offices. Had the wind been in another direction, there is no
doubt but that the statue of King Charles would have fallen a prey to the
devouring element.
Important.—There is no truth in the report that the earthquake last week
has affected the circulation of Punch. It is so firmly established that a gross of
earthquakes could not shake it.
NOVELTIES.
TURTLE-soup has lately, by order of the board of Poor-law Commissioners
at Somerset-house, been added to the dietary of the Workhouse Unions
throughout the kingdom. This will certainly be an improvement on the
“coarser kind of food " which has hitherto formed the carte at those
establishments.
Classes have been formed at Exeter-hall, under the direction of Mr.
Hullah, for the purpose of extending to the feathered race, the boon of
“singing for the million.” The tom-tit class already displays great pro-
ficiency; the sparrows are fast approximating to the nightingale; and we
were gratified the other evening by a well-trained chorus of owls, which
performed the responses to the “Spirits in the Air,” in Weber's opera of
“Der Freyschütz,” in a highly commendable manner. The peacock and
jackdaw classes, also, did great credit to their instructor; and the geese,
whose class is the largest of any, bid fair very soon to outrival the swans.
-
on lorTs.
A succession of entertainments, consisting of private theatricals, will
take place during the present season at the Mansion House. The
performances will commence this evening ; when will be presented (often
acted) a laughable farce, entitled “The Administration of Justice.”
A rowing-match will take place on the river at twelve o'clock this
morning, between eleven members of the Court of Aldermen of London,
and a like number of corresponding dignitaries of the Dublin Corporation.
The weight of no competitor to exceed twenty stone.
To-day being the anniversary of the birth of the illustrious Joseph
Miller, all the theatres will be thrown open to the public, gratis, by way of
a joke. Barrels of extra stout will be broached in the principal thorough-
fares in the course of the morning.
A procession of the united Tee-totallers of London and Westminster,
headed by Lord Brougham, who has recently joined that exemplary body,
will parade about the metropolis during the day.
The first Number of the United Menial Service Gazette, a periodical
which is to be the organ of the livery servants of Great Britain, was this
day published. The Editor is a footman of good character. This maga-
zine is redolent of the most recherché ton ; and, if we did not know
better, we should imagine that we recognised in it the hand of a distin-
guished literary nobleman. The article on “Hair Powder" is courtly
and elegant, and breathes the very spirit of the exclusive circles.
Sir James Graham this morning received a communication from
Somerset House, informing him that the Board of Poor Law Com-
missioners had had a large pail of the milk of human kindness presented
to them by the British public, with strong recommendations to try it.
Sir James despatched a tiger for a quart; but the milk turned out to be
“pigeon's milk.”
Cheatricals.
ENGAGEMENTs have been entered into by the lessee of Covent Garden
Theatre with the following distinguished artistes, who will appear in the
course of the season :-
With his Highness Mehemet Ali, the celebrated Pacha of Egypt, who
will sustain the character of “Bluebeard ” in the new and original grand
opera of that name, for a limited number of nights.
With the talented and versatile M. De Lamartine, who (by the kind
permission of the Académie Royale, and the Chamber of Deputies), will
appear in a new ballet: the music composed expressly for him by
M. Deshayes : and introduce the celebrated pas seul of “Jim Crow.”
With His Celestial Majesty the Emperor of China, who will appear in
Auber's grand opera of “The Bronze Horse,” in which his Majesty will
execute a popular pas to the tune of “Two Thousand Dollars;” and after-
wards sing a favourite cavatina (the composition of Dr. John Bull), to be
entitled “Down with the Dust.”
Negotiations are in progress with the Imaum of Muscat, Dost Mahomed,
the Schah Soojah, and other distinguished personages, which, it is confi-
dently expected, will be brought to a successful termination. A Thug of
first-rate eminence is daily expected from India; who will exhibit feats of
dexterity with the tight-rope.
water LOO Bridge.
The shareholders of this magnificent fabric, in honour of this day, hold
a levee on the centre arch, having for the time abolished the toll. Those
persons, however, who would avail themselves of this liberality, must
appear in full court dress, carrying a halfpenny in the right hand, to be
left till returned at the gate.
importANT to societies.
We regret to state that, in obedience to the strict injunctions of his
physicians, the Duke of Cambridge will, in future, not be able to dine at
more than six public dinners a-week.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LIONs: THE Lions !
THE magnificent lions, forming part of the establishment of Messrs.
Van Amburgh and Carter, yesterday promenaded through the principal
streets of the metropolis; which they were permitted to do, partly in
order to convince the public, by an irrefragable proof of their docility,
that one might go to the Lyceum Theatre without any fear of being eaten ;
partly to allow the animals an opportunity of seeing their royal relatives—
the various Lions of London.
The noble animals were first conducted to Westminster Abbey. As
they passed by Northumberland-house, they came to a halt, and for some
time wistfully regarded the lion on the top of it, which they evidently mis-
took at first for a live lion, but he not wagging his tail, although they
waited at least two minutes looking at him, they presently resumed their
journey. In doing this, they were observed to wink at each other and
shake their manes, as much as to say, “No go l’”
Their tawny majesties, on arriving at the Abbey, were conducted over
that venerable edifice by the Dean and Chapter in person. They mani-
fested that decorum and gravity which the sanctity of the place demanded ;
and it was noticed that, while looking round Poets'-corner, where stand
the memorials of the chief lions of England, the sympathetic and magna-
nimous creatures were much affected. On Messrs. Wan Amburgh and
Carter pulling out their purses at the conclusion of the show to pay the
exhibitors, the lions testified their disgust in an audible growl.
They were then escorted to St. Paul's Cathedral. In passing under
Temple-bar, they significantly snuffed the air, and cast some very intelligent
glances at the top of that structure, in evident allusion to the heads that
used to be placed there.
Their behaviour at St. Paul's was not quite so reverent as it was at the
Abbey; it was plain that they did not take it for a church. The bas-
reliefs representing charges of soldiers, the statues of military and naval
heroes, and the trophies of war suspended from the dome, made them roar
not a little. The sculptured semblance of one of themselves at the base
of Nelson's monument, for a moment arrested their attention, but they
seemed to turn up their noses at it.
On leaving St. Paul's, they were taken along Cheapside to the Mansion-
house, where the Lord Mayor and several of the Aldermen were sitting.
The corpulence of the civic dignitaries was contemplated by them with
much admiration, and it was observed that their mouths watered con-
siderably, but they behaved very well.
They were shown the Monument and the Thames Tunnel ; at which
sights they opened their eyes remarkably.
Retracing their steps, they were now led back towards Newgate,
over which they were taken by the governor, Mr. Cope. They ex-
pressed their high satisfaction at the whole arrangements, by placidly
wagging their tails; and when they were ushered into the condemned
cells, they exchanged some knowing looks, which were translated by the
bystanders into, “Shouldn't we like to live here !”
They then went through Newgate-market, where they cast very wistful
eyes at the butcher's-meat; but so well disciplined were they that they
did not even ask for any. After this, they proceeded to Smithfield,
where, it being market-day, the show of cattle interested them to a
great degree. After gazing upon the scene for some time in silence,
they began to lick their lips and to express their feelings in a subdued
but general growl, indications not to be mistaken. It was to be ap-
prehended that they were at last thinking of helping themselves; on
which account Messrs. Carter and Van Amburgh very prudently with-
drew them from further temptation, and quietly took them home.
N.B. It should be mentioned that the lions, in going eastward along
the Strand, turned aside, down Wellington-street, to inspect Punch's
Office ; where they roared at the jokes in a manner that was perfectly
tremendous.

DRAMatic MonoMania.-This day, Mlle. Plessy (the distinguished
French actress) appeared at Bow-street, to prefer a charge against a
celebrated translating dramatist, (his name we for the present sup-
press). Mlle. Plessy stated that she went in bodily fear of the said dra-
matist, it being his custom to take everything from the French for the
English stage. He had been seen, day after day, and night after night,
prowling about the stage-door of the St. James's theatre; he had been
heard to declare that he would, whether or not, turn her into English ;
and it was her belief that (unless protected by the Magistrate) she would
some night find herself translated to Covent-garden Theatre, acting a
very bad version, in very questionable language, either of Mademoiselle
Belleisle, or Le Portrait Vivant, or perhaps both. Mademoiselletrusted
that the Bench would protect her from the violence of the accused.
The magistrate asked if there was any evidence of the condition
of the prisoner's mind.
Hereupon, Mr. Bunn stepped forward He had known the pri-
soner many years: all that time he had certainly laboured under the
influence of monomania. He had always looked upon everything pro-
duced on the French stage as his peculiar property. He had heard
the prisoner, in the vain-gloriousness of his malady, liken himself to
Lord Nelson—inasmuch as the French could not put forth a single
thing but he immediately took it. In other respects, the prisoner was
quite sane; and even wholly capable of looking after his own affairs.
His powers of arithmetic were unimpeachable.
The prisoner (a man of very gentlemanlike exterior) assured the
Bench that he had no felonious intention towards Mlle. Plessy. He
had, to be sure, often been to the theatre, but with no eye to any
piece produced there; the said pieces being always supplied to him
in England, wet from the French press.
Mons. Delaporte (foreign bookseller, of the Arcade) corroborated
this part of the prisoner's statement: he had supplied him with such
works (all wet) for many years.
The worthy magistrate said he could not bring himself to let the
prisoner free for some days. It was, to his mind, evident that he had
an intention upon Mlle. Plessy, and he (the magistrate) should lock
the prisoner up until that lady's departure for France. -
Mlle. Plessy (with a curtsey worth at least fifty pounds sterling)
thanked the magistrate, and left the office.
Subsequently, Mr. Bunn became surety for the prisoner, pledging
himself to keep him within the walls of Covent-garden Theatre until
Mlle. Plessy quitted England.
seasonardle GIFTS.
An anonymous philanthropist this morning left a copy (bound in
calf) of Cobbett's English Grammar at the lodgings of the opera
critic of the Morning Post. Messrs. Sewell and Cross also sent
the same distinguished man a very handsome calico tie. He will
appear in it this evening in the front row of the gallery.

—
Vauxhall.
The preparations for the ensuing season at this delightful place of
recreation are going on as swimmingly as ever. It is at present intended
to open them on St. Swithin's Day, and a handsome pavilion has been
erected at the entrance, for the hire of umbrellas and overalls. The
members of the orchestra will also wear the new Macintosh uniforms.
Several alterations have been made in the gardens, amongst which the
und formerly appropriated to the fireworks has been let to the
Meteorological Society, who will, in future, hold their meetings there, to
calculate the quantity of rain fallen in the year, for the almanacks, this
being accounted the most eligible spot in the Metropolis. The fetes will
be conducted in the same style of aqueous splendour as heretofore ; and,
should the lessee be enabled to effect an engagement with the Comet, it is
in contemplation to persuade it to delay its departure, that the gardens
may be lighted in a novel manner. Each of the illumination-lamps will
be fitted up with a small umbrella, to keep them from being filled with water,
which has been found, on some occasions, to prevent them burning
properly.
Rite-flying in the City.
Jacob Lopez and Ephraim Notip were this day brought before Sir Peter
Laurie charged with a misdemeanor, which has of late grown intolerable
in the city ; we mean the very hurtful and dangerous custom of kite-
Jºying. The prisoners were old offenders, having been very often detected
in the like practice near the Royal Exchange. Sir Peter Laurie said it
was impossible for him to restrain his wonder, when he considered the ages
of the culprits. The worthy magistrate then entered upon a long and
very valuable homily on kite-flying; its pernicious effects upon society,
and the evil that inevitably fell upon those who gave way to so deplorable
a custom. The offenders evinced the greatest hardihood, laughing and
significantly placing the tips of their thumbs to their noses. The worthy
alderman, with tears in his eyes, sentenced the culprits to take up their
kites, or in default to be committed to the Queen's Bench. Sir Peter
incidentally observed, that the “iron-hoop nuisance” was bad enough,
but that the abominable practice of kite-flying was too often the ruin of
the peace of families.
IRegulations for the Aerial Courier.
The Aerial Courier will take up at the place of starting, and set down
immediately afterwards. Passengers are requested to take notice, that
asses' heads will be turned towards the moon, and that omnibuses will be
in waiting within a few yards of the place from setting out for the con-
tinent, in order to bring them immediately home again. The public are
also informed, that though steam is used, there is no danger of explosion,
as nothing is less calculated for going off than the whole arrangements of
the Aerial Courier.
Honour conferred by the Queen on the Drama.
This day, at the levee at St. James's, Mr. Sheridan Knowles had the
honour of receiving knighthood at the hand of her most gracious Majesty.
We understand that the Dramatic Authors' Society will—in celebration
of the event–lunch at a French house in the Haymarket.
Extraordinary Phenomenon.
The extraordinary mildness of the weather has had a very surprising
effect upon vegetation, and more particularly in the metropolitan districts.
Exactly opposite the twenty-third rail (reckoning from Temple Bar), on
the south side of the enclosure of the church of St. Clement's Danes, two
blocks, forming part of the wood pavement of the road, have put forth
shoots nearly two inches in length ! What renders this fact the more
surprising is, that one block is of Baltic and the other of American timber.
If this weather holds, it is confidently expected next week all the wood
pavement will be in full bloom.
Interesting to Naturalists.
The valuable collection of aquatic birds in St. James's Park will be
rendered additionally interesting during the ensuing summer, by the
adoption of a suggestion of Mr. Peter Borthwick, M.P. Every fowl has
suspended in the front a label, on which is painted its name, genus, &c.,
also the name of the particular island which it is likely to select for brood-
ing. A few more suggestions of this character, and Peter ought to have
a pension.
Notices of Motion for the First of April.
MR. Huxle to move for an estimate of the expense of keeping the ducks
&n the ornemental water in St. James's Park, with a list of all the birds,
the quantities eaten by each, the number of eggs laid within the last year,
and the amount of provisions, as near as can be ascertained, gratuitously
supplied by the public to the birds in question.
Colonel Sibthorp to move for a return of the length of notice of motion
which has been usually given by the earth previous to an earthquake.
TRIUMPH OF ART.
We perceive, by the daily press, that a magnificent Red Satin Umbrella,
made as a present for one of the Eastern potentates, rejoicing in the name
of the Sultan Abdul Medjib, has been submitted to the inspection of her
Majesty. This rare piece of work unscrews into various portions, and
contains in the handle, as we are told, a set of tea-things, a writing-desk,
and hat-box; two decanters, a bottle-jack, a select library, hair brush,
wash-hand-stand, and light camp-bedstead. This has given an impetus
to native manufactures, and an elaborate specimen of the article has just
been finished by Mr. Walker, of Hoxton, for the National Umbrella Art
Union, lately alluded to in PUNCH. The canopy is of rich brown gingham,
relieved at the edge by a double stripe of ashy gray, and secured to ribs of
the finest whalebone, carved at the extremities to represent black cribbage
pegs. The ferule at the end is struck out of pure brass. On opening it,
a round piece of leather, curiously vandyked at the edges, is seen at the
top ; and the stick is exquisitely painted to represent rosewood. The
handle unscrews, and presents a fine head of Dr. Syntax, of the purest
tariff horn; and the whole forms, when opened, a perambulating print-
shop of the most imposing description. The inauguration will take place
immediately, and the shop will be opened on the first dull evening in
Picket-street.
SCIENTIFIC NOTICE.
An interesting description of a process for the elimination of jokes was
last Friday evening read by Professor Faraday at the Royal Institution.
It consisted, according to the Professor, in lining the pockets of a literary
gentleman with tin (not tin-foil), and introducing into his stomach a given
quantity of venison or Welsh mutton, and a certain number of glasses of
champagne. In some cases, the learned gentleman stated, good port,
sherry, or an alcoholic mixture of brandy and water, or even malt-liquor,
will answer the purpose. The administration of these substances to the
subject of the experiment is speedily followed by an exhilaration of spirits,
productive of a brisk ebullition of jokes. The foregoing process has been
found much more effectual than the inhalation of the laughing gas.
EXTRAORDINARY LONGEVITY.

SIR.—My long-protracted existence has for a long time been the theme

explanation of a circumstance apparently so unaccountable. Allow me

beyond the term of ordinary existence, to the use of your Life Pills;
one of which, ever since my first starting in the world, I have taken night

Wednesday.—Last night, policeman 999, Z division, brought the alarm-
ing news to the Mansion House of the Comet having made his appearance
in the neighbourhood of the House of Parliament. The Lord Mayor
instantly called a meeting of Aldermen, to see what was to be done if he
should come through Temple Bar. He proposed sending it to Newgate.
Sir Peter Laurie recommended inviting him to a public dinner. The
standing Counsel expressed a doubt if he had a mouth. . Sir Peter said he
must have a mouth, as he has a tail. Counsel then informed them that
as he is one thousand times larger than the earth, there might be some
difficulty in getting him into Guildhall, and they had better let him star
it in the provinces. The policeman is to make a report every half minute
to the Home Office. As it is so near Parliament, it is supposed that
Sibthorp or D'Israeli are connected with it.
To BUTTERMen.
The Anti-Corn-Law League having occasion for a quantity of pamphlets
to stitch into the Magazines, and leave at the doors of houses, are ready to

presumed will answer the purpose of the prize essays and tracts that have
been hitherto circulated.

ToQTHACHE EFFECTUALLY CURED. — Mr. CRAckMolar,
Surgeon Dentist, begs to introduce his newly-discovered Cure for this
distressing malady. It allays all pain, prevents the progress of further decay,
and entirely supersedes stopping or scaling, the patient experiencing instantaneous
relief; at the same time the recurrence of the disease is effectually put a stop
to. Unlike other advertised cures, some of which end in smoke, this will be
found infallible, as it consists simply in extracting the offending tooth. At
home from 10 to 16. Crackmolar's Artificial Teeth are warranted without
springs or ligatures, and will keep for any time, provided they are never put
into the mouth. N.B.-Mr. Crackmolar is a Member of the French Institute,
to which learned body he proposed the cure of toothache by the guillotine.
THE Creditors of the late Duke of York are requested to apply for
payment of their claims to the keeper of the Column, who is charged with
the care of the only available capital.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
Chap. xii.-The COUNTFSS BLUshroSE AND HER BABE-SLAVERY
OF ST. JAMES*S-GARRICK’s “ROMEO.”
“I beg your ladyship's pardon—but will your ladyship's good-
ness allow a word with your ladyship !”
Thus spoke Mrs. Pillow, the housekeeper, following the Countess
from the apartment ; and her ladyship, by a motion of the head,
implied consent to the petition.
“I shall never forgive myself, never, till my dying day,” said Mrs.
Pillow, immediately she found herself closeted with the Countess.
“What has happened now, Pillow 3" asked her ladyship listlessly.
“Matter, your ladyship ! Well, was there ever such a kind, for-
giving mistress I’m sure, my lady, I”—but here the growing emo-
tion of the housekeeper broke forth in short, quick sobs.
“Another robbery, I suppose f" said the Countess, with affected
resignation.
“By no means, my lady,” answered Mrs. Pillow. “Now Susan’s
gone—not that she shall leave the house, my lady, before her boxes
are well tumbled—I’d answer with my life for the honesty of all us.”
“Well ?” said the Countess, in a fretful tone, and immediately the
housekeeper knew she must be brief.
“But, your ladyship,”—and here the tears trickled down Mrs.
Pillow's face like rain-drops down a window-pane—“when I think
of my own assurance—my—my—my worse than that, in busting in
as I did before your ladyship and my lord”—
f “Well, well, see 'tis not repeated. I suppose it was your zeal
or "-
“That's it, yourladyship, that's it. I thought if that hussy—saving
your presence—only had the first word, for first words with a brazen
face go so far—she might deceive your ladyship ; and, like her impu-
dence, she would come to you—but then, what do such trollops know
what Providence really made 'em for 1–Then I followed her, your
ladyship—and there she would stand in the hall, your ladyship, try-
ing to cry, and aggravating me past Christian flesh and blood with
her assurance—and then I–oh, my lady, character's such a jewel,
and makes us forget what’s proper to ourselves and our betters.”
And Mrs. Pillow concluded this fragmentary sentence with a new
supply of rolling tear-drops.
“That will do—no more—that will do,” said the Countess, and luer
lips almost broke into a forgiving smile. Magical was their effect
upon the housekeeper; for Mrs. Pillow wiped her face which, on the
instant, was smooth, passionless and glossy, as a face of ornamental
china. “Mr. Inglewood leaves us,” said the Countess.
“I am not surprised at that, my lady, if Susan goes.” Her lady-
ship, turning quickly round, bent a haughtily inquiring gaze upon
her servant. Mrs. Pillow felt she had been too abrupt. “That is, I
don't think Susan would have stayed long after him. His reverence
once gave the girl a prayer-book, my lady; well, would your ladyship
believe it, the wench was always a reading that book. I always
thought it strange, my lady, still I hoped it was nothing but religion.
But when people turn thieves, and rob such a sweet baby—oh, your
ladyship, what a darling, darling lamb his lordship is . So quiet,
too ! I'm the worst of sinners, if he doesn't cut his teeth like any
blessed spirit.”
This energetic praise of the baby seemed to touch the maternal
instincts of the Countess; for, suddenly remembering that she had a
child, she said—“Let his lordship be brought to me.”
I would fain pass over the emotion of such a mother. The babe
was brought ; the mother kissed her child—kissed it as a nun would
kiss her beads. Two or three minutes passed, and she was about
to return it into its nurse's arms, when the fretful creature—it
seemed wasting and pining, an offering prepared for death—threw
out its tiny hand, and fixed its fingers in its mother's hair, whining
and pulling with all its little strength. “Take him away,” cried the
Countess, with a slight laugh—“the-the little rebel !” and as the
babe was borne to the nursery, the mother turned quickly to a
mirror, and arranged a few disordered raven threads delicately, ten-
derly, as though they were vital as her heartstrings.
What knew such a mother of her child She had heard its first
wail—that inconvenience she could not avoid. It was from that
moment divorced from her cares. It grew not beneath her eye,
taking its hourly life from her; she never knew that sweet commu-
nion, when nature touches every nerve to tenderest music, still
drawing forth new love, repaid by love increasing ; by dawning con-
sciousness; by looks of brightening knowledge ; by fitful, broken
murmurings, deep with a sense of brooding joy; by all that inter-
change of mother love and baby happiness; and more, by all those
pulses of the soul which, in the thrilling present, assure the blissful
future. The Countess saw her child but at stated intervals; she
knew she was a mother only by the clock. Her sole offspring was
her beauty; that she nursed, that she watched, that she tended;
that, with every furtive glance, she with deep affection worshipped.
For her child, that was entombed in her face. It was this that to
my thought made her hideously lovely—that threw the cankerous
aspect of the witch upon the features of a goddess. Of all I have
known, the Countess stood apart.
Whilst in the possession of her ladyship I saw all to be seen of
the high world. Drawing-rooms—assemblies—balls—the opera—
all the shifting scenes, all the beautiful and brilliant things, that
make what is called society. I have seen true nobility of heart add
lustre to the jewel on its breast ; I have seen the man of birth, whose
great ancestors were to him as continually present; whose memo-
ries were as protecting angels, denying aught of mean, or low, or
selfish to approach the sanctuary of his soul; men with hearts and .
minds sweetened and purified by that everlasting fragrance breathing
from good and great men's graves. And I have seen the caitiff
whose stars and trinkets, like blazoned coffin-plates, glittered on
nothing but corruption ; men, with souls dead and noisome, in
moving carcases. With indignation did I first behold them ; with
scorn and a fierce hatred. I called fortune filthy names, and
arraigned directing fate of gross venality. This was the passion of
very ignorance. Since I have seen the world in its many inequali-
ties, have known and seen how much the selfish lose in what they
deem intensity of gain, I have looked upon them with compassion—
with a deep, mute pity. Poor small things, infinitely small in their
imagined greatness; men who, like the maggot in a nut, feed and
grow gross in darkness, unwitting of the world of light and beauty,
without that petty shell of self that circles them.
I have seen, too, woman in her sweetest, noblest aspect; a thing
of highest thoughts and deepest tenderness, still elevated—made
softer still by ministering tastes, almost refined away from earth—a
creature priceless and unpurchaseable as the angels Yet have I
seen her sold—bartered; paid for with golden guineas—with tinkling
title—with flashing coronet. I have heard something of the slave-
markets of Cairo—of Alexandria: tales of snow-skinned Georgians
and Circassians—of fairest victims vended by avarice to lust. The
tales were touching—very, very touching. But hearing them, I
have smiled at the wilful ignorance, the smug self-complacency of
Britons—I have smiled and remembered me of the slave-markets of
Saint James's “What!” cries the reader, and his lip turns slightly
purple with indignation, “St. James's 1” Yes, sir, Saint James's
I have seen blue eyes, pink cheeks, scarlet lips sold—ay, as you
would sell a nosegay—fathers and mothers luring on the customer,
but having by a bishop, who shall bless the bargain. There is this
difference between the Georgian and the British merchandise—a
small circle of gold wire about it, no more. Have I not seen creatures
with seraphic looks—beings that in real loveliness of form and
aspect, in living harmony of gesture—have almost made the imagina-
tion barren ; have I not seen them sold to some paralytic Plutus—
some half-palsied earl No—not sold ; they were married. Their
parents made for them good matches; they were married in a church
—married with all the honours.
The bells ring out a merry peal—look at the bride, her colour
comes and goes, and her lip shakes like a rose-leaf in the wind;
tears blind her eyes; and, as she steps from the carriage, the
earth whirls about her Is that the church-door Surely, it is
the entrance of a tomb. She fights with closed lips—mutely fights
against her swelling heart. She raises her eyes—she sees her
father's stony face glittering with a smile—a statue in the sun :
beholds her mother's simper—her weight of great content; she
turns—more horrible than all—and catches then the look of him, in
some brief minutes to be made her owner; he smiles, and her heart
dies at his Pan-like leer Well, they are married The bargain is
completed—the receipt, a marriage certificate, is duly passed. The
happy couple start for his lordship's Hall. An ox is roasted—butts
of ale are tapped—all is joy and rioting among his lordship's happy
people; happy, too, the happiest of the happiest, is his lordship's self
What an excellent match for the bride How many praise the
wisdom—the policy—of her parents How nobly they “ have done
their duty” by her. Is it not proved by after years does not her
ladyship make an immaculate wife Is she not chaste as Iceland
snows? Can even midnight drunkenness dare to pass a jest upon
her Is she not a pattern of all the choice proprieties True—very
true. Her father and mother are proud of the match—proud of the
spotless virtue of their daughter. And she is virtuous. She may,
with most serene defiance, think of Westminster II all ; but what has

her prudent father to answer, what her most politic mother to reply
to that harlotry of soul they have forced upon her—to that inevitable,
daily falsehood which they have made her act—to that constant lie—
that agonizing ulcer eating in her heart, most eating when a smile is
flickering at her lips?
Is she not a white slave—a Christian slave—a bondwoman bought
in a St. James's drawing-room, albeit wedded after at St. James's
Church 1 I have heard of women slaves toiling in rice-grounds;
heard of the planter's whip winding like whetted steel around poor
woman's form ; of these things I have heard. But I have seen white
slaves in carriages—have known the agonies inflicted on them by the
scourge of their own mind, by the worm preying in their hollowing
temples, by the very quietude of their despair.
These scenes I mingled in—these things I saw whilst in the
possession of Lady Blushrose. I have, however, trespassed by a long
digression—have again committed my usual fault of wandering from
the direct line of my story. Let me hasten to return to it.
Some three months after I was stolen—no, taken is the word—from
the palace, the Earl's infant, the heir of his house, fell ill, very ill.
“I am somewhat uneasy about Edward,” said the Earl to his wife,
who was drest for the theatre.
“I’m sure he's looking a great deal better—a great deal,” answered
the Countess, pressing her little finger to a beauty patch which
threatened to fall from her chin. “But if you think it necessary,
why not send for Doctor Wilson t”
“Madam,” and the Earl slightly coloured, “after your conduct to
the doctor this morning, I really have not the courage to send for
him.”
“Conduct! Was not the man insolent?—did he not accuse me of"—
“I fear, madam, his great offence was—he told the truth,” an-
swered the Earl.
“Doctor Wilson is, doubtless, a man of the world—a shrewd man,
and passes off brutality of manner, that some people may mistake it
for the independence of genius. For my part, I have no very high
opinion of him. Did he not say that I should kill the child The
wretch —kill it—because I had not nursed it myself? Has the man
no feeling Did not all my friends say that I should bring myself to
the grave if I did nurse it? And you yourself, know my constitution?”
“Yes, madam,” answered the Earl gravely; “I have often won-
dered at its excellence—often, too, after the labours of the card-table
at four in the morning.”
“Now, do not let us quarrel. You shall not spoil my evening
—that I am determined. I have made a party with Lady Dinah
to see Garrick's Romeo—I have not yet seen it, and really one
might as well be out of the world. You might have accompanied
me. I know the time,”—and the Countess acted a little pouting smile
—“that to have seen Romeo and Juliet with me—ha! well, well,
marriage turns the poetry of hope into the very prose of reality.”
“And you go to see Garrick's Romeo?” asked his lordship sadly.
“I’m told it’s delicious; so full of feeling !” answered the Countess.
“The carriage is at the door, my lady,” said the servant.
“You will at least hand me to it,” said the Countess, to his lordship,
with a seraphic smile.
The Earl raised his eyes to his wife. Still she smiled, and held
forth a fairy palm. The Earl sighed, and taking his wife's hand as
he would have taken a thistle, led her to the carriage.
-
THE PRINCE OF WALES’S HOUSEHOLD.
|
The public will see with infinite satisfaction that the Prince of Wales is
about to have a separate household. Some have imagined that a baby-
| house is alluded to, but we have ascertained that such is not the case, and
the following may be relied on as being as accurate a list as it is possible
| to obtain of the projected establishment:—
Master of the Rocking Horse.
Comptroller of the Juvenile Vagaries.
Sugar Stick in Waiting.
Captain of the (Tin) Guard.
Black Rod in Ordinary.
Master of the Trap Ordnance.
Clerk of the Pea Shooter.
Assistant Battledore.
Lord Privy Shuttlecock.
Quartermaster-General of the Oranges.
It is not yet decided by whom these offices are to be filled, but there is
no doubt His Royal Highness will manifest considerable discretion in
making the appointments for the “separate household” which has been
so properly assigned to him.
AN ACT
For amending the Public Deportment of certain Individuals called “Gents,’
abiding in London and other Places.
CKHijerras it having been represented that there are at present
existing in the Metropolis, as well as the provincial districts, certain
individuals known and spoken of as “Gents,” whose bearing and manners
are perfectly at variance with the characters, which, from a monomania,
they appear desirous of assuming :
3 nt; ſubcreas, in consequence of cheap clothes, imitative dispositions,
and intellectual poverty, this class is greatly on the increase, it has been
thought necessary that this Act should be framed to control their vicious
habits:
May it therefore please your Majesty, that it be enacted : Antſ he it
enactet, henceforth, that all Gents not actually in the employ of the
Morning Post, or Mr.
Simpson of the Albion, be \
prevented from wearing º
white cravats at parties, the \ N
same being evidently an Sº-
attempt of sixth-rate indi-
viduals to ape the manners
of first-class circles. And
that no Gent, who does not
actually keep a horse and is
not in the army, be allowed
to strut up and down the
Burlington Arcade with a
whip and moustachios, such E
imposition being exceedingly
offensive, and amounting to -
a passive swindling of the
spectators.
$nt be it enacterſ, that
all such things as light blue
stocks, large figured shawls,
cheap primrose gloves, white
Chesterfield coalsacks, half-
guinea Albert boots, in fact —Sº-r
all those articles ticketed in shop windows as “Gents' last Style,” be
considered the distinctive marks of the class, and condemned accord-
ingly. And that every individual, moreover, smoking outside an omnibus
sticking large pins in his cravat, wearing fierce studs in his shirt, walking
with others four abreast in Regent-street, reading slang publications and
adopting their language, playing billiards in public rooms, sporting dingy
white gloves in the slips of the theatres, frequenting night taverns and
being on terms of familiarity with the singers and waiters, thinking great
things of champagne, as if everything at a party depended upon it, and
•specially wearing the hat on one side, be the signs of most unmitigated
Gents, and shunned equally with hydrophobia.
and he it further enacted, that no Gent be in future allowed to
WEA, cross a hired horse with a view to ten
\ shillings' worth of Sunday display in
the Parks, the turn-out being always
detected; nor shall be permitted to
drive a gig, in a fierce scarf, under
similar circumstances. Nor shall any
Gent imagine that an acquaintance
with all the questionable resorts of
London is “ knowing life;” or that
trousers of large check patterns are
anything but exceeding gentish.
#abting aſhyang that the Gents have not the sense to endeavour
bettering their condition, which is exceedingly probable; under which

earcumstances they had better remain as they are, in ignorance of their
melancholy position. But on the other hand, it is commanded that people
of common intellect henceforth cease to designate any of their male
friends as “Gents,” the word being one of exceedingly bad style, and
equally objectionable with “genteel,” which is pºssibly derived from it.
And t if, after this, any one speaks of a “Gent,” or “Party” he
knows, it is ordered that such speaker be immediately set down as one of
the unfortunate class in question.
CANDIDATES FOR THE LAUREATESHIP.
A MULTITUDE of aspirants are already in the field, for the vacant Lau-
reateship. The authorities entrusted with the selection have ordered
the various candidates to send in their samples to the Punch Office, as
the most fitting reference that can be given for them. Our merry puppet,
being renowned throughout the civilized world for his total absence of
delicacy of feeling, unhesitatingly breaks the seals of their communica-
tions, and lays them before his subscribers and patrons—the public—as
the best judges to decide upon the eligibility. The authorities wish it
understood that they are not bound to accept the lowest tender per line
—which in these days of retrenchment it has been found necessary to
bring down the situation to—nor do they give any particular subject for
the samples, but leave every author to follow his own bent or usual style.

Oh the Ship ! the Aerial Ship,
That makes to Calcutta a twelve-hour trip,
And scuds o'er the mountain's or pyramid's tip,
If the ropes do not slip,
Or the canvass wings rip ;
Which lightning, or eagles, or winds can outstrip,
With a whirl and a whisk, and a bound and a skip,
Ere a tumbler of grog the conductor can sip,
In whose cheering mixture his beak he doth dip;
When passing a cloud he himself doth equip
In a macintosh garment to keep off its drip;
"Till, nearing the comet, he's dry as a chip,
Or a fire-proof box of old India scrip.

Over the mountains, my gondolier, row,
Climb the dark waters and hoist the pure sail;
See, in the east, how the sun sinketh low,
Open thy pinions, and catch the blue gale.
Strike the light trumpet, and gaze from the tower,
Fly o'er the desert and kiss the cold star;
Araby's grandchild, for me, in her bower,
Sings to the blast of her pealing guitar.
LORD W. I, ENNOX.
'Twas in the prime of summer time,
An evening calm and cool;
The moon on the cast oriel shone,
"Midst slender shafts of stately stone
That rose beside the pool.
On seven pillars of Gothic mould,
In Chillon's dungeons, deep and old,
Around the Holy Rood :
And blew—blew the wintry wind,
But yet it was not so unkind
As man's ingratitude.
There was a sound of revelry by night.
The early larks—the messengers of day—
Heard the loud noise, then, startled with affright,
With their moist cabinets flew all away;
Checkering the eastern clouds with shades of light,
Like guilty creatures sitting at a play.
Which made all think—in erring reason's spite,
One truth was clear—whatever was, was right.

The Post the Post the Morning Post
Of whose critiques I rule the roast,
I rule—I rule the roast.
My observations know no bound,
I scan the opera visitors round :
I look with disdain at the plebs in the pit,
Where caitiff tradesmen dare to sit.
I'm on the Post—I'm on the Post,
1 am there, in myself a host;
At public theatres quite a beau,
And in my attic but so so.
If food is dear, and herrings not cheap,
What matter—what matter—I go to bed and sleep.
THE “ BRIGHT GUEST * FROM HANOVER.
Thr king of Hanover is expected in London on the first of May.
He will be received with a pomp, ceremony, and enthusiasm worthy
of the event. He will be conveyed to this country in The Immaculate
steamer, and will land at Woolwich, at ten minutes past six in the
morning. The troops will have new clothing, to throw a proper
lustre on the occasion. A magnificent foot-cloth, of white satin, will
be spread over the steps of the arsenal, and will “be continued " at
least a quarter of a mile on the road to London. This satin will be
the produce of Spitalfields looms, and will, it is thought, more than
rival the famous Bayeux tapestry, inasmuch as it will contain—
worked in the most exquisite and elaborate manner—an allegorical
representation of all the political and domestic achievements of the
great man’s life. PUNCH has been favoured with a private view of
the work, and pronounces it admirable. His only regret is, that the
limited size of his sheet does not enable him to give anything like
fac simile of the woven wonder. Of course, Peace and Plenty
are there; Justice, with the other virtues, and all, and that in
the most astonishing manner, associated with the name of CUMBER-
LAND ! That they could have been so harmonised has astonished
every one. However, to return to the landing of his Majesty. The
king will, on reaching English ground, be greeted with a salute from
a deputation of ladies. A bevy of nymphs will then suddenly dart
from their hiding-places, and casting garlands about the king,
will lead him to his carriage. About a thousand children—dressed
in the congenial purity of white—will sing a hymn of thanksgiving,
expressly written for the occasion by the Marquis of LoNDoN-
DERRY; showers of flowers will fall in the path of his Majesty,
who will then pass underneath a triumphal arch entirely com-
posed of back copies of The Standard and Morning Post (beautifully
cut by the young ladies, pupils of the neighbouring schools), with here
and there a brightening bit of drab, from the cover of The Quarterly
Rerieuc. His Majesty, having received another salute from another
deputation of ladies, will enter his carriage, and amidst the sky-
rending cheers of an enthusiastic people, will proceed towards the
metropolis. At Greenwich, it is expected that the populace will rush
out waving green boughs, and throwing flowers under his horse's
hoofs; here, too, it is expected that the horses will be taken from
the carriage, which will be drawn to Deptford; where a new relay
of enthusiasts will (it is expected) be in readiness, and so on to St.
James's Palace. Here his Majesty will breakfast, and receive all his
friends. For this reception the smallestroom will, it is thought, be suffi-
cient. After this levee, his Majesty will be conducted to Buckingham
Palace, where will be shown to him—through a piece of ornamental
lattice-work constructed for the occasion—the baby Prince of Wales
and future king of these realms. After his Majesty has gladdened
his eyes with this delicious sight, he will return to St. James's Palace;
where will be waiting the principal Agent of the Steam Packet
Company, who will present to the king of Hanover (on the part of
the people of England) a bill, notifying to him the departure of the
very earliest boat on his journey back again.
LORD WILLIAM LENNOX AT THE LEVEE.
Lond William was presented (see Court Circular) to Prince Albert
at the late Levee, on his Lordship's publication of The Tuft Hunter.
His Lordship had the honour to present a copy of that laborious
work (superbly bound in velveteen) to his Royal Highness, who, on
a due consideration of the vast merits of the book, was pleased to
grant to Lord William a new coat of arms and iegend, commemora-
tive of the literary event. Thus, instead of his ancestral Buck and
Unicorn, with the Richmond motto En la Rose je fleurie, Lord
William Lennox will henceforth mount a Crow-bar in an Inkstand
proper, with the legend—
(ſhe lord as prigg mot isn't jig'm,
&Qājen be 6 cottb't bon't go to prison.
Punch is delighted at this honour conferred upon his own Lord
William. It at once silences those malevolent grumblers who declare
that literature is not duly estimated and rewarded at the court of
Queen Victoria.
Emportant Discovery.
The Society of Antiquaries have just given forth that artillery was
known long before the battle of Cressy. Mr. Cob Webb has routed up an
old Saxon chronicle, in which he finds it stated that “the canons of Edgar
were brought out to restrain the clergy.”

oUR “JENkins At home.”
THE “POST". IN “ PARADISE.”
*skiss—henceforth and for ever our own Jenkins—has, within the
past week, been in Paradise. Why need he care for the contested Earldom
* Bººthºhanskate, so long as he can enjoy the delights of Fop's Alley
Why need he repine over the bread and onion, and the half-pint of porter
left by his landlady on the stairs, when he can “pick up crumbs” from
Signor Laplache No—no ; three nights a week Jenkins of the Post is
in Paradise; though his washerwoman dun him, DuMILATRE sublimates
him with a smile.
But let us hear JENkins—for henceforth we have no taste for John
Milton-on Paradise. Jenkins says–
“The opera is a sort of anticipated Paradise, which loses all its zest—all its roluptu-
*repose, if your neighbours breathe on you the spirit of coarse mortalitu. On the one
side you may have a box where parvenus, charmed with their own voices, drown with in-
Sessant uproar those of the virtuosi. . on the other side, night atter night, you may have
your eyes martyrized by the sight of some gorgeous City dame of overflowing embon-
Point, dressed in gold and silver, mixed with all the colours of the rainbow—sturing you
out of countenance, and looking like a twelfth-night queen on a Christmas cake. You
. have gentler neighbours to listen to such dulcet notes as Persiani uttered last
ight.”
We trust that henceforth the ladies east of Temple Bar will not breathe
* too “coarse mortality” on the sensitive plant of The Morning Post.
How dreadful would it be if JENkINs were to die of a Lady Mayoress I
In another article, JENKINs calls himself a “quiet critic: ”—
“. It is the predominance in numbers of such gay votaries of her Majesty's Theatre that
renders necessary the presence of us quiet critics, who have been for more than a quarter
of a century devoted admirers of Italian lyrics, and have followed as their shadows, and
in the intimacy of private life, the greatest artists—picking up the crumbs of their
•piniºns and judgments, as the Turks say, and studying their physiology, as our Gallic
neighbours express it.”
Punch believes in the doctrine of metempsychosis, and, looking into
futurity, sees the spirit of Jenkins informing the body of a blind fiddler's
cur, wagging his tail, and “picking up the crumbs" that fall from his
rosin-scraping master. Punch predicts that Jenkins will not be called
Pompey or Caesar, but Post—always Post 1
A new colony.
In consequence of the increase of railways and decline of the road, the
stage-proprietors intend emigrating to Coach-in China. |
NEW “ POST-OFFICE” REGULATIONS.
As the building opposite the English Opera-house is rapidly approach-
ing completion, and as it is to be intended for the Morning Post office
—the Bureau du poteau du matin, as their foreign correspondent calls
it—the following Regulations have been drawn up; any neglect of the
due observance of which will be severely punished, as by these means
alone can that journal sustain the high repute in which it is universally
held by all classes, from the “frowsy city dames,” to the “ornaments of
society”—we quote Jenkins of last week.
3tulcă antſ 3i.cgulationſ.
1. That all common people be excluded from having any connexion with the
paper.
2. That the compositors work in white neckcloths, kid gloves, and patent
pumps, to remove any tairſt of vulgarity from their labours; and that
the papers be damped with rose-water previous to going to press.
. That the editor be acquainted with at least twelve words of French and six
of Italian, upon which he can ring the changes repeatedly. And that,
following the custom of Gray, he appears in full court dress whenever
he writes an aristocratic article.
. That every opera evening a bandbox be in waiting to convey Jenkins from

Qſìje Đebate on the 3Estimates.
Mr. HUME objected to the expense incurred in sending out the Order
of the Garter to the King of Prussia. He (Mr. Hume) did not wear
garters himself (hear, hear), for he always patronised socks (cheers and
laughter); but he knew a friend who did wear garters, and who had
received a pair by ; which only cost him fourpence, yet several
thousands of pounds had been laid out in sending the garter to the King
of Prussia (hear, hear). Why, the King of Prussia had been over here
himself, and might he not have taken his garters with him (Cheers and
daughter.)
Mr. Wallace had rather the garter had been conveyed by Pickford's
van. The Messrs. Pickford were highly respectable men, (Question) and
the garter would have been safe in their hands. Besides, when once
booked it was at the risk of the King of Prussia. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Hawes, upon the estimates being moved for keeping the Parks in
order, complained of having been warned off the grass.
The Earl of Lincoln replied that respectable-looking people had free
access to the parks, and even Mr. Hawes, by his own admission, had
been let in, for he said he had been warned off the grass (Hear, hear.)
The boys had trod down the grass a good deal, and Mr. Hawes should have
known better. (Cheers.)
Mr. Roebuck wanted to know whether he might go through the
enclosure of St. James's Park with a bundle. (Hear, hear.) He had
been turned back once or twice, and as his washerwomon, and himself
lived on opposite sides of the park, he found it very inconvenient.
Sir James Graham said that he should be sorry to personally inconve-
nience any honourable member, but he thought if Mr Roebuck's washer-
woman had access to him twice in the week, the peculiar circumstances
of the case would be met by that arrangement.
Mr. Roebuck admitted that this was satisfactory.
Mr. Hume was surprised at the large sum it had cost to get a Bishop
over to Jerusalem. He (Mr. Hume) frequently travelled all the way from
the Eyre Arms to the Elephant in an omnibus for sixpence. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Wallace saw with surprise a large sum for stables at Windsor.
He (Mr. Wallace), when he was a boy, had kept a donkey (much laughter),
but now he (Mr. Wallace), was obliged to keep himself. (Hear, hear.)
He thought it would be cheaper for her Majesty to job her horses, and he
was surprised that her present Ministers, who understood those things,
had not recommended to her the jobbing system. (Laughter.)
Sir R. Peel was sure that when the honourable member who last spoke,
alluded to the expense of keeping a donkey, he (the honourable member),
if he kept an eye to his own cost of living, must know what it was. He
was sure the House would not grudge her Majesty convenient stabling,
particularly as the number of horses kept had little else to do but to
remain in their stalls, which ought, therefore, to be made as comfortable
for them as possible. (Hear.)
The eonversation then dropped.
QUESTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS.
MR. EwART suggested that more attention should be paid to framing
Acts of Parliament, when—
Colonel Sibthorp asked whether, if more attention were given to framing
them, it would not be as well to think of glazing them also.
Mr. Hume suggested that the silent system was injurious, when –
Sir R. Peel asked the honourable member to try it for a little while
himself, when he (Sir R. Peel), would engage that the honourable member
would be all the better for it.

Vol. IV.-1843.
THE PUBLIC OFFICES OF LONDON.
The PUNCH OFFICE.
If London is beautified by its public buildings, it is certainly rendered
important by its public offices. I is a passport into the best circles to be
able to say, “I’m in a public office " Pitt and Canning could say so once ;
Peel can say so now; and our boy vs he enters the threshold of our public
office every morning eight times with a shutter in his hand, can say so
also. The public offices of London are not all of them so remarkable for
architectural beauty as for the interest and importance they derive from
the purposes they are devoted to. Shakespeare's house at Stratford-upon-
Avon, was, architecturally speaking, “nothing out of the way;” and, by a
recently expressed desire to have it pulled down, it would appear to be
considered “something in the way.” There are certain holes and corners
about the metropolis pointed out with concise veneration as the birth
places or haunts of illustrious men; and there is a certain flight of break-
neck steps somewhere between the Old Bailey and the Fleet, which is
pointed out as the place where Steele, or De Foe, or Hogarth, or somebody
did something or other, but what that something is nobody seems exactly
to know, though the place is visited by literary and antiquarian pilgrims,
who make a regular shrine of it. There is also a clump of stinging-
nettles on Hampstead Heath, under the shadow of which Steele is said to
have written a number of the Guardian ; and such is the sort of renown
that will attach in future ages to the public office of Punch, in Wellington
Street.
But it is now time to leave the discursive tone, which thinking of the
British essayists has tempted us to indulge in. Punch's public office is
of the coldly-severe style—particularly in winter—for the architect has
neglected to put a fire-place. The exterior presents a series of glass
squares, the uniformity of which is only disturbed by one of those at the
bottom being devoted to a very fine specimen of the fine arts. It is an
original sketch of Punch, done in oil, by Painter, after Carpenter. It is
remarkable for its boldness of outline, and depth of colouring, we having
bargained with the artist that it should stand a weekly scrubbing with
soap and brush, which our boy has directions to give to it. Several artists
have tried to give a representation of an open mouth, but our artist, with
a vigour and decision unparalleled in the annals of the Royal Academy,
has boldly cut the piece right out. A double effect is thus produced, for
we get at the same time a perfectly natural representation of an open
mouth, and a letter box :
The interior of the office is not very remarkable; but the extraordinary
precision observed in all the departments, would do credit to the General
Post Office. There is a Comptroller of the Till, an Accountant-General,
|
a Deputy Clerk of the Counter, an Inspector of the Letter Box; and, the
most curious part of the matter is, that notwithstanding the arduous
work in all the departments, “a man and a boy” get through the
whole of it.

PARLIAMENTARY PETITIONS.
The schoolmasters of the Presbytery of Dunse have petitioned for an
increase of salary. Colonel Sibthorp opposed the petition, on the ground
that the fact of the place from which it came being, the Presbytery of
Dunce was enough to show that the schoolmasters did not deserve an
increase of salary. -
On a petition being presented against the Gilbert. Unions, Mr. T.
Duncombe presented a counter petition from Miss Ballin, the celebrated
dancer, in their favour. Mr. Duncombe explained, that Miss Ballin had
long ago formed a matrimonial union with Mr. Gilbert, and both parties
had experienced the happiest results from it. -
A discussion arose as to the impropriety of keeping the public records
in a cellar, and it was said, that though the cellars of Somerset House had
been prepared, the place was wholly unfit for the purpose. Mr. Williams,
of Coventry, immediately presented a petition, from himself, that the
records should be removed to the
white hortse CELLAR.
Mr. Hume thought the Cider Cellars would be more central and quite as
convenient.

MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE.
By the REPoRTER of the “MoRNING Post.”
Nformation has reached us that a “My Lady's Foot-
man,” in a distinguished family of ton, is about to
make his debut at Her Majesty's Theatre. His
noble mistress has kindly allowed him to appear at
rehearsal—in his full-dress plush breeches.
We have seen a series of songs called, “Ballads
of the Butler's Pantry.” They are extremely touch-
ing, and will form a delicious pendant to the
“Canzonets of the Kitchen.” We have heard them
sung by a lady's maid of our acquaintance with
much grace and pathos. The “Lays of the Laun-
dry” are a brilliant set of songs, and must become
very popular. We heard one of them at a select
reunion the other night, given by an influential
valet.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
ChapTER xii.-DEVOTED TO MOMUS.
OLYMPUs, and merry England in the olden time, seem to have
been much alike. Eating, drinking, love and jollity, were in both the
order of the day—especially jollity. In our own golden age, the
barons were jolly, the knights were jolly, the squires were jolly,
the friars were very jolly; and even the old saints were jolly—in
their way. But, moreover, there was a particular personage more
jolly than anybody else—the jester. Under the reign of Jupiter
the heroes were jolly, the nymphs were jolly, the fawns were jolly,
the satyrs were very jolly, and the immortal gods themselves were
jolly old fellows. But the jolliest old fellow in all Olympus was
Momus, the Court Fool and God of Fun. He was also the oldest jolly
fellow ; for he was the son of Erebus and Night. On this account
he used sometimes to say that he must confess his parentage was
obscure.
Momus, though a deity of the ancien régime, contrived, amid all the
celestial revolutions, to remain in office. He was the Talleyrand of
the skies—though Talleyrand is believed to have been no fool. One
of Jupiter's first acts on ascending the throne, was to confirm Momus
in his situation of Jack Pudding.
The vocation of Momus was just like that of the English jester.
The fool of feudal times, that is to say, the professional fool—not the
crusader or knight-errant—was retained in the establishments of
people of consequence, to make jokes for their amusement; the
making of jokes in those days being, like the making of anything
else, except love and war, accounted beneath the dignity of a gentle-
man. Lest the jocosity of the fool should be restrained by fear of
consequences, he was allowed to say whatever he chose ; and accord-
ingly he would often, without scruple, make a jest at the expense of
his master. If, for instance, he belonged to a marauding baron, he
would not hesitate to quiz the noble lord occasionally on his thefts
and homicides; if to a haughty bishop, he would rally the right
reverend prelate a little upon pride and hypocrisy. And the bishop
and the baron would laugh at these jokes almost as much as they
would at antics and grimaces, because they appeared so much non-
sense to their understandings; and nonsense is laughable. More-
over, 1 elative nonsense, that is, sense which people do not see, is as
laughable as absolute nonsense. Thus, if some fool, in the present
day, were to ask some pious individual of the superior classes,
whether the ancient fathers were wont to go to church in their car-
riages 1 he would be laughed at as a matter of course. Well, Momus
would often amuse the gods by nonsense of this kind. He would
have fine fun with Jupiter and Mars about their respective gallan-
tries; and “How about the dove cage?” was his constant query to
the latter. He would twit Bacchus with his inebrieties, Diana with
her prudery, and Juno witn her temper. He would draw caricatures
of Minerva in high-lows, and represent Mercury on the tread-mill.
He used to call the latter, who, among other things, was Jupiter's
lackey, “John Thomas;” and, in reference to a current joke upon
earth, would ask of him what taxes were Other pleasantries of an
inferior order, but more, perhaps, to the taste of the gods, he was
constantly making—such as inquiring whether their mothers knew
they were out 1 whether those same ladies had sold their mangles:
what was their state of health 1 and so forth.
The following sallies of Momus's may be depended upon as
authentic; and, as such, they throw a valuable light on the character
of ancient fun. - -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 151
That ingenious deity, Vulcan, had made Pandora (to order) for
Jupiter out of clay. All the other gods declared the work to be
perfection itself; but Momus said, with a sneer, that there ought to
have been a window in the breast, through which might be seen the
workings of the heart. “A window in the breast !” exclaimed
Venus: “Lal what an idea!”—“How odd it would look 1" remarked
Minerva–" How ridiculous !” ob-
served Apollo; “ha, ha!”—“Haw,
haw, haw l’ roared Neptune, shak-
ing his sides. “Ho, ho, ho!” thun-
dered Jupiter; and inextinguishable
laughter shook the skies.
Minerva built a house, which she
called “Minerva House.” Momus
said that it ought to have been built
on wheels, so as to be movable at
pleasure from a bad neighbourhood.
“Why that,” cried half a dozen deities
at once, “would be like the gipsies'
vans, or the houses that hereafter will
stand for a long time on the right-
hand side of Clapham-road as you go
from town,” and there ensued a
general scream.
Neptune made a bull—of course
you will say the gods laughed at
that. No, they did not : it was not
an Irish bull, but a bull bond fide. It
was a prize bull; my Lord Spencer
never raised a finer. “Umph,”grunted
Momus, when Ceres asked him if he
had ever seen such an animal? “If
the eyes were closer to the horns he
would make a better hit.”—“I think
he had you there, Neptune,” said his
majesty, and smiled ; whereupon all
the gods laughed too; but whether
at what Momus or what Jupiter said
is not clear.
Venus, as we all know, was, like
the lady who in after times was led
to the hymeneal altar by a gentle-
man of the name of Dunois, surnamed
the “Bravest of the Brave.” The
only fault to be found with her was,
with regard to her steps—not her
moral steps, (for they were thought
very right and proper by everybody,
except Vulcan)—but her footsteps.
The latter were as heavy as the
former were light. “Is she not, now,”
cried Apollo, one day after dinner,
as Venus left the room, “is she not a
thing of loveliness t”—“With all my
heart,” answered Momus; “’tis a pity
she kills so many beetles.” The im-
mortals declared this to be bitter;
but they chuckled at the insinuation.
For many an age Momus continued
to play off his pleasantries in heaven,
and to set the table of the gods in a
roar. But, at last, the mind of Jupi-
ter began to misgive him that there
was danger in the god of drollery,
and that there was rather less of the
fool in him than the knave. His
majesty observed that, whereas for-
merly when he thundered, all was
consternation and awe, now his light-
ning was looked upon as a mere
brutum fulven, and that his sublimest
peal were no more regarded by the
gods than are the mimic rumblings of
a melo-drame. No longer did the skies grow danker at his frown;
no longer did Olympus tremble at his nod; and it became, by degrees,
a question with him whether or not these alarming symptoms were
traceable to the buffoonery of Momus; who, among his other pranks,
had a knack of taking him off. Momus would frequently amuse
himself and the other immortals by putting on a huge periwig,
scented with ambrosia, and playing Jupiter Iratus—shaking his head
and looking the lion; which afforded great pastime to the gods.
Being a ventriloquist, he could thunder to admiration; and whenever
an explosion of the monarch's wrath took place, he was certain to
burlesque it; and this he called “coming Jupiter Tonans.” Jupiter
had hitherto been the sublime of gods; but he now found himself
becoming rapidly ridiculous; he saw
that his pomp was parodied, that his
majesty was mocked, that the deities
were beginning to analyse state and
ceremony, and to entertain a glim-
mering notion that they were all
humbug. He knew that their next
step would be to weigh himself in the
balance, and he felt what would be
the consequence of that. He deter-
mined, therefore, to arrest the extend-
ing evil; and he accordingly sug-
gested to Momus that the lower world,
where the state of affairs was so par-
ticularly funny, would be a much
finer field for him than the sky. So
Momus came down among Iuen.
On earth he introduced comedy,
farce, and tomfoolery in its various
branches. He chose certain favour-
ites, whom he inspired with the sense
of the ludicrous. They, like himself,
were for a long time the mountebanks,
the merry Andrews, the laughing-
stocks of their fellows. They stood
on their heads, and threw summer-
sets, and made faces, and uttered ab-
surdities. And, like him, they are
now on the eve of revolutionising the
world. They are rendering vice ridi-
culous. They are showing up to
the light the “outward limbs and
flourishes” of meagre dignity; the
solemn absurdities of bedizened
power. Even the charity boy now
laughs at the beadle. Wisdom is no
longer in the wig; the bishop wears
his own hair; and periwig-pated jus-
tice on the bench, in her scarlet and
ermine, is regarded as a monstrous
scarecrow. Where all this will end,
unless there be formed a Society for
the Suppression of Jokes, who can
tell ? Let their Worships, and their
Reverences, and their High-and-
Mightinesses, look to it.
The traditions respecting the per-
sonal appearance of Momus are
slender. We are told that he was
E generally represented raising a mask
s from his face, with a small figure in
his hand. Was it hereby meant to
convey to us what a small thing human
nature is when we view it seriously—
that is, comically. Perhaps so. In
default of more ample information
concerning Momus's externals, we
may take the liberty of supposing
them. It may be plausibly conjec-
tured that motley was his only wear;
nor would that artist outrage proba-
bility, who should represent him so
arrayed, with a whitened visage, and
his cheeks adorned with triangles
of crimson. But it were better to
exhibit him in a three-cornered hat,
adorned with bows of ribbon, a
laced blue coat, red waistcoat, and yellow leather inexpressibles,
having a large hooked nose, and a great hump upon his back, and
bearing between his hands a baton or cudgel. For, beyond all
doubt, the modern impersonation of Momus is (though he says it
himself) the illustrious “Punch.” May coppers long jingle on his

era has arrived in which all ordinary
methods of locomotion are for ever sub-
verted—and Punch's Aerial Courier—The
Gull—will henceforth be the sole means
of communication from one country to
another, however distant.
The annexed engraving represents the
vessel as she will appear, cleaving her
way through the air with the velocity of
a shooting star, and carrying upwards of
an hundred passengers. The suspensory
and propelling power is obtained by the
union of Steam with Punch ; and the fol-
lowing account of the manner in which
these gigantic forces are brought to act,
will assist the reader in comprehending
the construction. The letters have refer.
ence to the illustration.
A. The main suspenders, of a peculiarly light
nature, being entirely formed of numbers
of Punch, coupling power with volatility,
and acting as shown above.
B. The engine-room, in which are contained
the principal steam-works, by the action
of which are turned
C. The propellers, or fantail revolvers, making
10,000 revolutions per minute, and
fashioned like the sails of the windmill
in common use.
D. The chimney, for making a current of air in the fire-place, and carrying
away the smoke.
E. The saloon, provided with every comfort and luxury, from piano-fortes to
bottled Porter, fitted up to represent a castle in the air, with gossamer
couches and cobweb tapestries.
F. The promenade in fine weather, filled with company, and enlivened by aband
of instrumental performers, who will, on the day of starting, perform the
Soarus Quadrilles, composed expressly for the occasion by Jullien.
G. The ballast-box and wine-cellar. Arrangements have been made with
the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge to buy all their
heavy back stock, for ballast.
H. The figure-head, being a colossal likeness of Mr. Punch, with apartments
in the head for select passengers.
I. Three gigantic peacocks' feathers of sheet brass, to act as a rudder, with
immense power, and realize the “sturdy steer" of Spenser.
K. Two grapnels, for the double purpose of assisting the descent of the
courier, (should such auxiliaries be found necessary, which some
doubt), and also to clutch hold of anything on the journey worth tak-
ing. . It is calculated a few statues, ships, and objects of art and value
may be grabbed every voyage by these means, sufficient to pay for the
fuel, which will be entirely formed of former inhabitants of Memphis,
who burn beautifully.
I. The smoke.
M. Barracks for troops, and stores for the ammunition, removed to this part
for the accommodation of those who dislike the smell of powder.
The fares will be regulated by the weight, and not by the age of
the passengers. The line of road has been already determined upon,
from London to Bombay, nearly as the crow flies; and the Courier
will stop at intermediate stations for passengers. The whole voyage
will be performed in two hours, including stoppages For the use of
commercial gentlemen we have added the following

CHAP. XIII. — DRURY LANE THEATRE. – A BROKEN. HEARTED WOMAN.
The COUNTESS is SUMMONED HOME.-AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.
The Countess was in raptures with Garrick. Her friend, Lady
Dinah, too—a widow of four-and-thirty, whose chief favourite in this
life was her own broken heart—was softened to the extreme of
tenderness by the passion, the energy, the enthusiasm of the little
man. I have said it—Lady Dinah had a broken heart. Happy
woman, that it was so : for that shattered organ stood to her in the
place of a parrot, a spaniel, a precious get, to be fondled and fed upon
the choicest morsels. It was this attention to the craving appetite
of her broken heart that brought Lady Dinah to Romeo and Juliet.
Sympathy was a necessity of her nature—but then it must be
sympathy with the wants and woes of love. At eighteen she had
been married to a nobleman of large estate, sixty years old, and a
pair of crutches. The daughter of a fox-hunting squire, she had been
legally sold to his lordship—vended to the winter-stricken peer, like
any peach in January. She had been a widow only four years ; her
husband, with a stubbornness often peculiar to the ailing, determining
not to cancel the contract a single day before. “And so, my dear,
that is how my heart was broken.” This was the constant theme of
Lady Dinah; who would continually show her broken heart to her
friends and acquaintances, as other women would show their china.
It was, indeed, her only solace—her only comfort. Her face had in
it frank good temper; her eyes were swimming in laughter; her lips
ever curling with smiles—she was altogether a ripe, plump piece of
frolic nature, yet to her five hundred bosom friends she insisted
upon being known as “a blighted thing; indeed, a disappointed
woman, with a broken heart.” And then she would hint at the
mystery of an early passion—of what in her girlhood she had suffered
for a first love. This mystery was never cleared; for I give no
credence to the vulgar gossip of her nurse, who, as I heard, declared
that her ladyship before marriage had “never loved anything that
signified, except green gooseberries.” -
The play proceeded, and with every scene the admiration of Lady
Blushrose, the emotion of Lady Dinah, increased. “”Tis very nice,”
said Lady Blushrose at a part of the balcony scene.
* Nice, my dear! it's delicious,” cried Lady Dinah, and for a
moment spreading her fan before her face, she sighed deeply. Very
different were the feelings of the two ladies. The one sat as a
patroness of the poet and the actor—now and then graciously accord-
ing an approving smile; the other was in the scene; was, indeed,
or assuredly tried to think so—Juliet herself. “It’s very foolish,”
said Lady Dinah, and with an attempt at vivacity, she brushed her
handkerchief across her eyes, I do verily believe, thinking there was
at least one tear in each of them.
“Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say —Ay;
And I will take thy word.”
Thus spoke Juliet, and immediately Lady Dinah in a whisper to
her friend exclaimed, “Just like me when quite a girl.”
“Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say g night till it be morrow.”
Here Juliet disappeared from the balcony, and Lady Dinah, throw-
ing herself back in her seat, slowly shook her head, observing—“If
it doesn't take me quite to my father's orchard l’”
“My dear child,” said Lady Blushrose, looking round the house—
“you distress me, you do, indeed, to find you thus give way to your
feelings. You know—it's only a play.”
“Very true—I know that—but memory, memory, my dear! In
this life we—ar’n’t they the Clevelands opposite? Lud! no, I’m getting
blind I think—in this life, woman has but one heart, and when that
is broken”—
“To be sure. Why, there's that wretch Huntingtopper,” cried
Lady Blushrose, who, whilst sympathising with her friend, had care-
fully surveyed the boxes.
“He mus'n't come into the box—positively, he mus’n’t come into
the box. I wouldn't have him see us for the world,—where is he?”
Lady Blushrose immediately pointed out to her broken-hearted friend
the situation of his lordship, who, on the instant recognising the
ladies, kissed his hand to them, and left the box. “He’ll never
come to us,” cried Lady Dinah, as though she expected a reply.
“No doubt he will—and why not " asked Lady Blushrose.
“Oh, my dear—I quite loathe the man,” said Lady Dinah.
"He's very handsome,” said Lady Blushrose, believing in that she
had said everything
of sympathy—so utterly ignoraut or careless of the emotions of the
heart.”
A knock at the box-door, and immediately enter his lordship. He
seemed a man of about two-and-thirty. His features were handsome
—very handsome ; in point of regularity, faultless. A well-formed,
well-painted lamp, but with no light in it. As I shortly discovered,
his lordship was the veritable Huntingtopper, the lordly master of
Mr. Curlwell, whose generosity towards the little feather-dresser was
so touchingly displayed in St. Martin's watch-house.
“Well, ladies, how do you like it Garrick wants a little of the
dash of a giant for my notions of a lover. He's mean—plaguy
mean,” said Huntingtopper, plunging at once into the play.
“Does your lordship measure hearts by a foot-rule #" asked Lady
Blushrose.
“Not exactly—but then, one wants a sort of style in these things
—when we talk of heroic poetry, of course, we want people of heroic
look to utter it—otherwise it’s nonsense, quite nonsense.” Thus
spoke the lordly critic. -
“But altogether, what does your lordship think of Romeo and
Juliet 2" inquired Lady Dinah, with a downcast look, and in the
gentlest tone of voice—yea, almost in the accents of a sufferer.
“There's some good things in it; can't deny that—very decent
things in it; but then there's a good deal of stuff. Now, all that
we’ve listened to about the fairy's coach—can any reasonable person
make it clear 1 Come, here's the book,” and his lordship read in a
loud tone, Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers;
Her traces of the smallest spider’s web ;
Her collars of the moonshine’s watery’-
“Silence in that box "roared a voice from the gallery, and looking
upward, I recognised my old, honest friend, Luke Knuckle, Mr.
Flamingo's porter. Luke, otherwise a peaceable fellow, was too
much interested in the fate of the lovers to pay any deference to
anybody in any box; and therefore, almost unconsciously rebuked the
talkers. His lordship cast a contemptuous look towards the audience,
as though one of the dearest prerogatives of high box company—
namely, to talk loud at a play to the annoyance of actors and auditors
—had been most impudently interfered with. . So indignant was his
lordship, yet withal so defying of vulgar opinion, that he was about
to continue the quotation, when a hurried knock struck at the box-
door. It was opened, when one of the Earl's servants delivered a
letter to her ladyship.
“It’s impossible t” said her ladyship, with slight agitation, having
read the note. Then, turning to Lady Dinah, she said—“My dear,
you must excuse me—I am summoned home.”
“What has happened "cried Lady Dinah.
“Oh, nothing; that is, nothing but his lordship's groundless fear—
I will be back in a short time.”
“Pray don't miss the tomb-scene” urged Lady Dinah, “but what—
what is the matter "
“'Tis only to frighten me, I know—it can't be otherwise ; but his
lordship writes that dear little Edward is dying. But it can't be—he
was so much better this morning. I shall be able to come back,
I’m sure.”
“To be sure you will,” said Lady Dinah, with a comforting manner;
and very willing to be so comforted, Lady Blushrose suffered herself
to be handed to her carriage by Lord Huntingtopper.
“You’ll have no cause to remain at home, I trust,” said his lord-
ship; “and till you return, I'll talk Shakspeare to the broken-hearted
widow.” As his lordship, with a peculiar smile, uttered these words,
Lady Blushrose raised her fore-finger in playful reproof of Hunting-
topper's intention. Ere, however, he could reply to this, the carriage
rolled away.
Arriving at his lordship's mansion, the door was already open, and
servants already watching the coming of their mistress. There was a
sudden look of real seriousness in one or two faces; in others, worn
as a part of the earl's livery, for the occasion; a look that convinced
me death was in the house. Mrs. Pillow was on the staircase,
having descended at the sound of the carriage-wheels. She stood
with clasped hands, pursing her mouth, and striving to look smitten
to the heart. All she said was—“Oh, my lady so sweet a baby!”
The countess slightly trembled at the aspect of the matron, then
rapidly passed her. In a minute she was in the room where lay the
dying child. -
The earl sat at the bedside. Never shall I forget the look with
which he met his wife—the mother of his infant. There was no
reproof in it—none—but the very eloquence of pity. The countess
was running to the bed, when the earl rose and folding her in his
“But then his sentiments, my dear; so coarse-so little respectful
arms, led her aside,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“He’s not ill—not so very ill 1" cried the countess, hysterically.
“Patience, Margaret, patience,” said the earl, with apparent calm-
ness. “He may be better—but he is, I fear so at least, much
changed.”
“My dear—dear child 1" screamed her ladyship. “He will be
spared us?”
“Let us hope it, let us pray for it,” said the earl; “still we must
be patient.” He then led his wife to the bed-side; and instantly
the grief and cries of the countess were redoubled. She threw
herself upon the bed, and called Heaven to witness how she loved
her child.
“A letter, my lord, from Doctor Wilson,” said a servant, present-
ing a note to the earl.
“Where—where is the doctor 1* exclaimed the countess.
“Be calm, my love; I sent for him—he sends this letter,” answered
the earl.
“A letter | Why does he not come 1–a letter 1" cried the
countess.
“He will not come,” said the earl. “Listen.” His lordship then
read the note of the physician;–
“My Lord, It is with unaffected pain that I cannot feel it due to
my professional character to attend your summons. After what fell
from her ladyship this morning, I should forfeit all sense of self-
respect were I again to do so. Her ladyship expressed a total want
of confidence in my skill — ”
“I never meant it—he knew I never meant it !” cried the
countess, in a rage of grief.
“‘Permit me, however, to recommend to your lordship, the gentle-
man who is the bearer of this. I have frequently met him in the
course of my professional experience, and have great pleasure in
herewith testifying to his high ability. I know no man to whose
skill I would so readily entrust the health of my own children.
“I remain, your obedient humble servant,
“‘CHARLEs Wilson.
“Conduct the gentleman here.” said the Earl.
“Is he a physician "asked the Countess.
“The doctor does not tell me, but I have all faith in Wilson, let the
gentleman be who he may.” As the Earl spoke this, the servant
ushered in an old acquaintance of the reader's, no other than apothe-
cary Lintley. The Countess glanced at his plain outside—for in the
days whereof I write, the physician had a more marked exterior than
in these one-coated times—and loudly whispered to her husband,
“I’m sure he’s not a physician.”
Lintley, overhearing this, observed—“No, madam, I am not.
Doctor Wilson has, however, informed me of the case ; it is one I
have treated a thousand times among the poor.”
At the word “poor,” the Countess looked toward her husband, as
though, of course, he would instantly resent the insult. The Earl,
however, immediately addressing himself to Lintley, said—“I am
happy, sir, that my child will have the benefit of so much expe-
rience.”
Lintley then approached the little patient : in an instant I saw
in the eye of the apothecary the fate of the babe.
“He is not so very ill, sir!” asked the Countess.
“He is very ill, madam,” answered Lintley.
“But not dangerous—nothing dangerous—you will answer for his
recovery—of course, with your experience, you can answer?” cried
the Countess.
Lintley did not speak, but glanced at the Earl. The father saw
there was no hope, and endeavoured to soothe the mother, whose
extravagant grief burst forth in the wildest expressions. She hung
about the child, and vowed she would never survive it—no, she
would be buried with it. She, who had loved it so—she who had so
treasured her dear, blessed darling ! At these words, the Earl hid
his brow in his hands, and groaned bitterly.
“Is there nothing, doctor—nothing that will save him 1" cried the
Countess.
Lintley still evaded an answer; still the mother asked. At length
the apothecary replied—“Nothing, madam—now.”
“Oh I know what you would say—Doctor Wilson has said so,
but it was impossible. How could I nurse it—how could I, blessed,
dear babe that it is, -but how could I nurse it !”
“Patience, patience, Margaret,” said the Earl, taking his wife's
hand. And so for hours they sat. As the clock struck six the child
died.
And then again and again the Countess mother vowed she would
be buried with it.

LITERARY MENDICITY..—BEGGING LETTERS.
YESTERDAY, a man named West (of somewhat “careworn" appearance)
was brought up to this office, charged with haunting various suburbs of
the town, and thrusting under doorways, flinging in at windows, bribing
housemaids and others, to get placed before
“ the lady of the house.”
a certain mendicant epistle.
Policeman B 42 was on duty in Cumberland-market, and observed the
prisoner for several days lurking about and watching the doors and win-
dows in a very suspicious manner. At length, saw him yesterday morn-
ing about twelve o'clock accost a little boy who was carrying home a pint
of beer. After some conversation with the child, observed the prisoner
in the most adroit manner drop something into the beer. Believing
that the prisoner had thrown some mischievous compound into the liquor,
B 42 immediately took him up.
Adolphus Gubbins (often years old, and very intelligent for his time of
life) deposed that the prisoner met him in Cumberland-inarket, and
asked him what he thought of “public morals : " Witness replied, he
didn't know ; thought he preferred hardbake. Prisoner then asked him,
iſ nis mother knew he was absent from the maternal hearth ; and before
he could answer dropt the paper in the beer. The paper was taken from
the porter at the station-house in presence of Mr. Oxide, the chemist.
The subjoined is a true copy:-
Madam,_Perceiving, and lamenting, that the public taste has been seriously cor-
rupted, and that the public morals have been grievously injured by the style of popular
Literature which for some time past has issued from the press, I have desired, by the
publication of a periodical with a correct and moral tendency, to advance to the best of
my ability an improvement in these things, and have commenced a work entitled-[Here
Punch declines to give a patronising squeak, by giving the title of the “correct and
moral” work]—designed to be completed in 52 weekly (31.) numbers, or 13 monthly
parts. Yet, as an author only slightly known, I fear I shall be able to do but little
without the support of the Ladies of the Metropolis; but with their aid I trust very
much may be accomplished.
May I be allowed, very earnestly and very respectfully, to call your attention, to this
subject? And that I may be ena led to effect an object which I am sure you desire to
see attained, may I solicit the favour of your patronage, evidenced by your filling up the
enclosed form, and returning it to me?
I have the honour to be, Madam, your faithful servant,
EdwańD WEst.
Besides this circular, which was rolled up into a very compact ball, there
was another (a very business-like document) enclosed in it. We give a
copy :—
Authorises M.R. Edward West to have the “
supplied to her in theº
Address
• The words “weekly numbers,” or “monthly parts,” to be filled in.
Lucretia Kagmag was next examined. Dealt in cat's-meat, and was
intimate with the prisoner, living in the same neighbourhood with him.
The intimacy began about a month since, when the prisoner waited upon
her to make an arrangement for the circulation of his letters, by insinuat-
ing them into the bosoms of families, in the form of envelopes to her
haiporths and penn'orths of horseflesh. The witness, however, refused
to do so after the first fortnight; having, in the most mysterious manner,
lost a great number of her best customers (cats) by death, in consequence,
as witness verily believed, of something in the letters.
Here the prisoner, looking very loftily about him, denied the imputa-
tion. The letter was a truthful compound—an anodyne against the present

fatal diseases of the “periodical" press. The work it was his glory to
put forth, might be worn in parts, like bags of camphor, round the necks
of sucklings; so that, when they went alone, they should go in a pure
literary taste.
The worthy magistrate asked if the contents of the letter had been
analysed
Here Mr. Oxide, chemist, of Osnaburgh-street, deposed that he had
analysed the letter. He found it to contain a very dangerous quantity
of cant, with a degree of effrontery calculated to produce in a healthful
stomach extreme nausea. In allusion to the loss of Mrs. Kagmag's feline
customers, Mr. Oxide observed, he thought it possible that the letter was
bad enough to make even a cat sick.
Here several paper pellets and a very formidable elder pop-gun, found
on the person of the prisoner, by Policemen B 42, were produced in
court. The magistrate asked the prisoner how he could account for the
possession of such deadly weapons?
Hereupon the prisoner, with a wan smile of something like contempt,
proceeded to unroll one of the pellets, which was composed of very thin
tissue paper, and on which was printed the letter quoted above. The pri-
soner observed, that when he found housemaids, cat's-meat women, and
others, alike averse to circulate his proposals for publication, he had no
other remedy than to work them into paper pellets, and being a very
good marksman, to fire them into first, second, and third floor windows.
He had often found the plan succeed to his infinite reward.
The worthy magistrate said, these proceedings aimed at the peace of
families could not be permitted to continue ; and therefore summarily
sentenced the prisoner to six months' confinement in the office of the
Morning Post, and during the term to be kept to continual grinding of the
editor's scissors, with nibbing of the pen of ditto. The prisoner, who was
much confounded by the sentence, was then removed to the office ; and,
i. . understand, is at this moment confined in the same cell used by
enkills.
THE TALLIPOT TREE.
| IGNor PUNCH,-I had long been seeking in vain for a subject
whereon to exercise my poetic vein. Opening a dictionary by
accident, I embraced the following with enthusiasm :—
“ Tallipot sulst.—A kind of palm which grows at Ceylon and
Malabar, and the leaves of which are very large.”
Primed with this knowledge, and in a glow of inspiration,
which you will call happy, I wrote my lyric, which I beg leave
to inclose :—
MASTER SLENDER.
Oh, the Tallipot tree is a kind of palm,
And its leaves are broad and wide ;
They are still as death, when the weather is calm,
Which cannot be denied.
In Ceylon the isle, and in Old Malabar,
The Tallipots proudly grow;
And perchance elsewhere the Tallipots are,
But where I do not know.
Then sing to the tree—the Tallipot tree,
The Ceylon and Malabar Tallipot tree
Oh, the Tallipot I have never seen,
Nor any kind of palm,
But sure it is sweet to gaze on its green,
And feed on its fragrant balm.
But never would I to Ceylon roam,
To bask 'neath the Tallipot tree;
No : upon it I'll think, while I stay at home,
As a pleasant mysterie.
Then sing to the tree—the Tallipot tree,
The Ceylon and Malabar Tallipot tree l
3Bumti)'s 33t-almission into ſtantt.
THE readers of Punch can never forget that some weeks since he
was banished from France—pushed by the point of the sword from
the port of Boulogne into a Dover packet. Nor can the readers of
Punch ever cease to remember the tremendous letter which he wrote
to Louis-Philippe on that disastrous occasion. Does Punch say a
letter? Pooh a whip of steel ! This is some weeks since ; and all
the machinations of the THIERs' party have all that time been
exercised to keep that thunder-clap of a billet-doux—for it may be
likened to anything tremendous—from the ears of the King of the
French. Never mind. Magna est ceritas, et—provalebit t (which my
dear dead son was wont to translate “PREvail. A BIT 1") At length,
Louis-PHILIPPE is made sensible of the wrongs of Punch, and imme-
diately writes to him, as brother should write to brother. Punch,
with a magnificent expansion of the heart, subjoins the original, and
a correct translation thereof, done for him into English by a very
promising British dramatist.
Palais des Tuileries, 7 Avril, 1843.
PUNch, Polichinelle, Mon FRERE!
tonné, contristé, les larmes aux yeux,
j'ai parcouru votre épitre du 11 février.
Je savais l'injustice dont vous étiez victime,
vous, vers lequel je me suis toujours tourné
lorsque les soucis, les travaux du pouvoir
m'ont accablé! mais a dire vrai, j'ai été
tellement absorbé parles intéréts de l'Es-
pagne et par d'autres tripotages, que je ne
pourrais vous confier qu'à huis-clos, que
j'ai da me sevrer du banquet intellectuel
que la sapience consolante, les folies ébou-
riffantes de Punch offre toujours.
Cependant, il y a une heure à peine, que
trouvant mon fardeau gouvernemental in-
supportable, j'ai demandé mon Punch, mon
moniteur, monami : lorsque Mons. Guizot,
d'un air Ébahi, m'a soutenu que par ma
propre injonction vous aviez été banni,
exclude notre belle France ; et à preuve
il tira de son portefeuille le numéro qui
contient votre fulminaute, votre pathétique,
votre inrésistible épitre.
Ah, mon frère, mon ami, compátissez a
madouleur et voyez ma peine ! Donner
des ordres aux douaniers pour interdire ce
bienheureux paradis de France à certaines
gravures équivoques, véritables pestes, ou
exclure, vous, mon féal, mon meilleur,
mon plus cher ami, le confondre avec les
ennemis de l'ordre, de la décence, de la
morale, de la pubité ! les imbéciles,
les ànes, les rustres ' ' '
Le fait est, Polichinelle, (un roi peut
pour une fois dire vrai sans que cela tire à
conséquence) que vous avez une réputation
séculaire qui vous nuit, qui vous accable:
vous avez été tenu si longtems pour un
grandissime vaurien, pour un franc-parleur
éhonté, qu'il faudra nombre d’années pour
désabuser le monde, pour que le préjugé
s’efface,—enfin pour qu'on croie, a ce que
vous étes, mon gentilhomme, c'est a-dire
chaste, délicat, correct ; disant bien par-ci
par-lä des vérités sévères, mais exprimées
avec tant de recherche, de délicatesse, de
suavité, de décence, que la récluse la plus
angélique se laisserait aller a vous écouter
sans soupçonner que son salutest en danger,
que son coeur est complice.
Accourez donc, Polichinelle, venez, venez
en France, venez aux Tuileries, venez à
Versaille, moi-même vous montrerai-je
ma capitale, les gloires de mes palais, de
mes retraites princières! Oh! alors je n'en
doute pas, vous pardonnerez, vous outlierez
cette apparente, mais nonprémédité insulte,
infligée par la seule stupidité de mes subor-
donnés : car avec Béranger, je dirai pour
majustification—
“On prétend que je vous gouverne,
Mais vous devez voir, Dieu merci,
Que j’ai des ministres aussi.”
Donc par compassion pour moi, mon cher
Polichinelle, et prenant ma position en con-
sideration, voir même a quelle engeance je
suis livré, accordez pardon et pitié, et que
par le retour de “l'Emérald’’ j'aie la
satisfaction devous presser surmon sein.
Wotre frère,
LOUIS-PHILIPPE,
Roi des Français.
P.S.–Il y a bien deux ou trois nouds
Européens tant soit peu serrés, compliqués,
qui sont à délier, et grand besoin ai-je d'un
ami dont les dents accéreés m'aideraient A
trancher les difficultés: ainsivenez, venez,
car quand méme. “Plus on est de fous,
plus on rit.”
Tuileries, April 7, 1843.
Punch, AND My Baother,
With tears and astonishment, I
read your favour of February llth.
I have always flown to you as
my chief solace in the cares of go-
vernment, I had known the injustice
put upon you ere this—but to say
the truth, I have been so perplexed
with matters in Spain, and other
affairs which I can only trust to your
private ear, that even the comforting
wisdom, the ethereal frolic of Punch
have of late been denied me.
An hour since, however, finding
the weight of government insupport-
able, I called for you, my monitor
and friend, when Mons. Guizot.—
with rather a startled look—assured
me that by my own orders you had
been banished from labelle France.
As he said this, he drew from his
pocket-book the copy of Punch,
containing your most pathetic, in-
dignant, and irresistible letter.
And now, my friend and brother,
sympathise with me. I had given
stringent orders to the officers at the
ports and frontiers not to admit cer-
tain poisonous prints into the happy
paradise of France; when the fools—
the asses—numskulls—confounded
you, my best and dearest friend,
with the enemies of all order, all
decency, all truth.
The fact is, Punch,-nay, let a
king speak the thing that is, for
once—you have the weight of cen-
turies upon your reputation; you
have been held a vagabond and a
somewhat too free speaker, so long
—that even now, it will take a
handful of years to entirely dis-
abuse the world of a prejudice, and
to make it believe you—what, in
very truth, you really are — an
orderly, gentlemanly person; speak-
ing now and then a cutting truth,
but uttering it with such a suavity
of manner, and with such a decorous-
ness of phrase, that even nuns
might lose their hearts to listen to
you.
Come, come, come, PUNCH, to
France—come to the Tuileries—
come to Versailles l I, myself, will
show you the wonders of my capital
—the glories of my palace retreat!
You will, I know, forgive the ap-
parent slight that was put upon you
by the stupidity of my servants. As
De Béranger correctly sings—and
you must take it for my apology-
“On prétend que je vous gouverne,
Mais, vous devez voir, Dieu merci,
Que j’ai des ministres aussi.”
Hence, my dear Punch, out of
compassion for me, thinking of the
people I have to trust to, forgive me,
and let me, by return of The Eme-
rald, fold you to my bosom. Your
brother,
LOUIS-PHILIPPE,
King of the French.
P. S. There are two or three
tight European knots which lack
the friendship of your teeth to duly
untie. So, come—come ! The
more the fools, the more the fun!

THE Post conversazione.
decoction of comique arec eau fratch, or cold rum and water, was in
versazione for the present or any other season, at his garret in Long-Acre, constant demand during the evening. Jenkins having felt for something
JENKINs, of the Morning Post, gave his first, last, and only Con-
which he calls his Chambers at the West End, on Wednesday evening last.
The object of the réunion being to advance the interests of the paper
among its chief supporters—the footmen of the aristocracy—the pro-
prietorskindly permitted Jenkins to draw a fortnight's salary in advance.
Jenkins, who generally obtains his scent by walking into perfumers' shops
and trying some on his handkerchief without making a purchase, had
achieved the trick very successfully in the course of the morning, and the
nocturnal onion of yesterday's supper was thus smothered by a most
unfair plunge of Jenkins's nose into the open bottle of Bouquet de la
Reine on Delcroix's counter.
Cards had been issued to all the fashionable footmen now in town ; and
the greater part of the company came in their cockades and shoulder-
knots. . Most of them were contributors to the Post, and among others we
recognised the footman of an ambassador to whom Jenkins is indebted for
his diplomatic news.
Jenkins's arrangements were on an unusually liberal scale. His shirt-
front, which, under ordinary circumstances, he irons at home, was put out
for as the play-bills say) “this night only;” and his white handkerchief,
tied expressly for the occasion by his friend the porter of the Carlton Club,
was extremely Beang meese, as the whole company admitted. An in-
fluential butler having made a present of some wax-pieces, Jenkins stuck
them into as many batons de chandelle or candle-sticks as he could muster
together; and it was the general observation that the host had been
coupeving it ercessiamong gras—cutting it excessively fat—on this auspi-
C10us Occasion.
The room was adorned with drawings of the divinities attached to the

until a long consultation in whispers with the petite fille sale de la maison
little dirty girl of the house, after which no more was forthcoming.
Cribbage was played until a late hour, and the health of Jenkins was
proposed, but the compliment was not carried out, for want of something
to drink it in. -
The conversation turned chiefly on the Opera, where most of the com-
pany had been on the preceding night, waiting in the lobbies and avenues,
for the various persons under whom they have condescended “to take
office.” Jenkins was a good deal quizzed on the painful nature of his
position, which rendered it necessary for him to enter the body of the
house, and come in contact with “frowsy” people from the city. Jenkins
held a very animated discussion on the Italian poets, with a shop-boy at a
celebrated Italian Warehouse in Oxford-street, and was kindly furnished
with a list of articles called by Italian names, sold at his master's establish-
ment, which Jenkins will no doubt introduce into some of his criticisms of
the Opera. The Conversazione was interrupted once by a political dis-
quisition on the theory of rent between Jenkins and his landlady; and a
short digression on beer, in connection with the precious metals, was
commenced in the room by the girl, when Jenkins stepped outside to
finish it. The company separated highly delighted with the intellectual
treat that they had enjoyed; and Jenkins having flung the pewter pots
over the bannisters, let down his turn-up bedstead, flung himself upon it,
and was soon dreaming of the Opera.

quality influencing the mind.
The force of simplicity has a moral, the simplicity of force a physical
grandeur. True force is always simple, therefore simplicity is always
the result of true force. Weakness builds up quantities of small stones
into enormous palaces, full of ornament and complexity, and admires
the vastness of the Babylon he has builded. But #. the devourer is
already feeding upon it, and in a comparatively few years it becomes a ruin.
Force got together a few huge masses of stone on a plain, set some on end,
and laid others on the top of them, called it a temple, and worshipped
there ages and ages ago; and men even now wonder more at the immen-
sity of force used in putting these few rude rocks together than at the
construction of vast edifices.
In all ages Force has been the tyrant of the world ; elevating the man
from the common level of mortality, and making a demi-god of him. In
the old times, the simplicity of force chose kings, not because they were
the sons of this or that other king, but because they were fit persons for
their office; and as a king then led his army to battle, fighting at its head,
his fitness consisted in superior force, and he was chosen as the most
“goodly” man, the man of stature and strength, and went forth in the
simplicity of force, fighting among his soldiers, and inspiring them by his
presence amid the fury of onslaught—himself the foremost. Far different
now is the machinery-work of our army; complete manoeuvres and instru-
ments have superseded simple force, strength of arm, and valour of heart.
When a catapult was first seen at Lacedaemon, Archidamus exclaimed,

beauty of chivalry departed, gleaming in polished armour from afar back,
amid the dark ages 1 and even have joyed at its pale ghost “revisiting
the glimpses of the moon” at Eglington I
How simply Force expresses what it has to say, is finely exemplified in
the poem we shall now quote:–
THE WAR-SONG OF DINAS WAWR.
He fled to his hall-pillars,
And ere our force we led off,
Some sacked his house and cellars,
While others cut his head off.
We then in strife bewildering
Spilt blood enough to swim in ;
We orphan'd many children,
And widow’d many women.
The eagles and the ravens
We glutted with our foemen,
The heroes and the cravens,
The spearmen and the bowmen.
We brought away from battle,
(And much their land bemoaned
them)
Two thousand head of cattle, [them.
And the head of him who owned
Ednyfed, king of Dyfed,
His head was borne before us,
His wine and beasts supplied our feasts,
And his overthrow our chorus.”
“Thr mountain sheep are sweeter,
But the valley sheep are fatter,
We therefore deemed it meeter
To carry off the latter.
We made an expedition;
We met a host and quelled it;
We forced a strong position,
And killed the men who held it,
On Dyfed's richest valley,
Where herds of kine were browsing,
We made a mighty sally,
To furnish our carousing.
Fierce warriors rushed to meet us ;
We met them and o'erthrew them,
They struggled hard to beat us,
But we conquer'd them and slew
them.
As we drove our prize at leisure,
The king marched forth to catch us;
His rage surpassed all measure,
But his people could not match us.
We know no war-song in any language which can be compared with
this for force, condensation, and powerful simplicity. In the first stanza,
the gentlemen engaged in the expedition are assembled in council. Com-
mon sense evidently presided over their deliberations:-

This king was evidently a very hot-tempered fellow, and consequently
rash; so not waiting to collect a proper force, he sallied forth with proba-
bly only his own household. But notwithstanding his rage, he conducted
himself with proper dignity, not rushing, but “marching” out with his
people, who, says the poet, “could not match us.” So

From this last line we may form some idea of the sort of person they
had been fighting against; he was evidently a hard and stiff-necked mºn,
for we see it required more than one person to cut his head off; it also
took a considerable time in getting through the operation, for the sacking
his house and cellars, which could not have been done in a few minutes,
we are distinctly told was carried on “while others cut his head off.”
It appears to have been quite a mélée, very likely, fought in the dark
passages of the king's palace, for the fourth stanza says-

intimating that all were killed, which idea receives further confirmation
in the next and last stanza, in which there is no mention of prisoners, but
only of the “two thousand head of cattle,” and the head of the king of
Dyfed.
The writer of this poem must have been accustomed to draw up
“ despatches,” for there is no mention of any slain on, their own side, but
only the tremendous slaughter of the enemy. This amiable omission being
intended to prevent any gloomy feelings from obscuring the splendour of
the rejoicings which they made with the dead king's spoils; and to cast
away all thoughts of death out of the minds of those who would join in
some future " expedition," to procure fresh spoils and fresh laurels, anº
again to be the subjects of heroic song—while, till then, the “present

It is sometimes so fully developed in these individuals that they have
been known to make the most handsome presents to the children of

Concentrativeness—produces “a desire for permanence in ideas of the

strongly marked in the members of the Cabinet Ministry.
Cautiousness—“occasions doubt, irresolution, uncertainty, and the host
of hesitations and alarms expressed by the word but.” It is manifestly
very large in the phlegmatic gentleman who writes the reviews for the
weekly Spectator.
Colouring—“when very prominent, gives a passion for gaudy colours,
without reference to their arrangement or harmony.” It is developed to
some extent in linen-drapers' assistants, and in the people who furnish the
costumes for the supernumeraries of a theatre.
Time—is an organ very largely developed in gentlemen's stewards and
tax collectors, who are always punctual in their application for payments,
but will never allow time to those whom they are employed to visit.
Tune—is very small in the vocal gentlemen who join in chorus at the
various harmonic societies; and is not particularly large in the vendors of
Bath-bricks and hearth-stones.

PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
Chapter xiii.-Touching NEPTUNE.
His Marine Majesty, Neptune, who, as the reader knows, was the
son of Saturn and Ops, had a narrow escape, like Jupiter, from the
paternal paunch. Saturn would have swallowed him as soon as he
was born, had not the crafty Ops expeditiously secreted him in a
cupboard, and presented her husband, as a pledge of their affection,
with a fine colt instead of him. Whether the colt was of the asinine
or equine species we are not informed, but probably it was of the
latter tribe; because, though what we should call monstrosities were
by no means uncommonly the offspring of the immortals, yet Saturn
would hardly have believed that his son was literally a jackass, how-
ever much, had such been the case, the child might have been thought
by others to take after the father. As it was, ; allowed himself to
be crammed, morally and physically, with the alleged prodigy; he
went the whole horse and the whole hog; and the following an-
nouncement appeared the next day among the “Births” in the
“Olympic Times”—“Her most gracious Majesty Queen Ops, yester-
day morning, of a fine colt. The infant, according to custom, was
swallowed by its royal father with avidity. Their majesties, we are
happy to say, are both as well as can be expected.”
Her liege lord having retired to digest his meal in quiet, and the
coast being clear, Ops forthwith despatched little Neptune,—who,
during the deglutition by Saturn of his substitute, had grown several
inches in the cupboard, to Arcadia; there to be brought up by a
trustworthy shepherdess. Abroad in the meadows to see the young
lambs run skipping about by the side of their dams was the happy
lot of his infancy; but his tastes were not thereby rendered particu-
larly pastoral : and he manifested an early inclination for a sea-
faring life; a circumstance which shows how much stronger is the
natural constitution of the mind than the bias imparted by education.
When Jupiter sent his father to the right-about, he gave Neptune
the office now discharged by Britannia as vicegerent—that of ruling
the waves. The instrument with which he performed this operation
was a trident; a three-forked sceptre, much like a common prong,
but more ornamental, and more useful too, of course. It was richly
gilt and inlaid with ivory, and was very considerably handsomer
than the city mace. With it Neptune could do almost anything in
the water; from raising a tempest to spearing eels. Neptune, more-
over, had a chariot, to which that of the sheriff of London and
Middlesex is a mere taxed-cart, made for him at the first-rato
establishment of the celestial Long-Acre. It was constructed of an
enormous scallop-shell; and the interior, which had the effect of
decomposing light, reflected all manner of colours. It was drawn by
winged horses called hippogriffs; fine tits they were too, and would
have fetched a trifle at Tattersall's, if the Messrs. Tattersall had not
been in the paulo post futurum tense at the time. Momus used to call
the hippogriff a “tit for tat.” One would think, now, that all this
beneficence on the part of Jupiter would have been repaid by
Neptune with the warmest gratitude; but though that virtue is a
distinguishing attribute of the British tar, it does not appear to have
held a very high place in the nautical bosom formerly. For “the
waters wide” were not thought a wide enough empire by our friend
Neptune, and he actually conspired with some other gods to dethrone
his brother and his king. That a monarch whose own subjects, the
waves, were themselves so very rebellious, should have had no more
fellow-feeling—let alone gratitude and paternal affection—than to do
this thing, is very odd : it was an impolitic line to take, moreover.
Jupiter, with the sagacity of a James the First, discovered the plot
as it was on the eve of exploding, and with a clemency which is more
likely to find applause than imitators, was contented with condemning
Neptune to build the walls of Troy; had he been a James the Second,
he might have cut his head off and sent him to Tartarus without it
afterwards; but as has been said, he merely sentenced him to hard
labour, which is a trifling punishment for high treason. Perhaps he
considered him a monomaniac.
Neptune having completed his task, a reconciliation was effected
between the brothers, and the Sea King afterwards conducted him-
self, as a vassal at least, with propriety. Like his element, however,
which is very prone to encroach, he was of a grasping disposition ;
he disputed, as we have seen, with Minerva respecting Athens; he
had also a squabble with her for the altars of Traezene, which was
settled by Jupiter, by assigning the worship of the place as joint-
stock to both. Then he promoted a chancery suit against Apollo
for the isthmus of Corinth ; it was agreed, however, that the matter
should be submitted to arbitration : and Briareus, who was chosen
referee, allotted the isthmus to the proprietor of the ocean, and the
promontory to mine host of the Sun.
Neptune was a god of high privileges. He presided over the
whole world of waters, from the sea to the Serpentine; from the
fountain to the gutter. By dint of his trident, he could raise islands
from the bottom of the sea;-what a pity it is that he did not raise
up the Royal George, and so save Colonel Pasley all his trouble By
a strong motive-power, with which that same instrument was
endowed, he was likewise able to occasion earthquakes at pleasure;
which he would often amuse himself by doing. His very step,
according to Homer, would make the earth tremble, and the moun-
tains (to personify their Eminences) shake in their shoes. As he
careered over his watery domain, all the whales, dolphins, and
porpoises, and the whole boiling of the finny tribes would throng
round him like a human populace. “Strange things,” as the poet
beautifully expresses it in the song of “The Admiral,” would “come
up to look at him the master of the deep.” “In his wake,” too,
“like any servant,” as the same bard singeth, would “follow even
the bold shark; ” and, what was a great thing, the shark, if he had
fallen overboard, would not hare dared to eat him.
The victims of Neptune, besides various sailors, and a certain
gentleman in particular of the name of Leander, were the horse and
the bull; the former animal is now the victim of the cabman, and
the latter of the beef-eater. The gall of these creatures was con
sidered as his bonnebouche; because it was bitter like sea-water. For
the same reason, bitter jokes might have been sacrificed to Neptuue;
but perhaps he did not relish jokes.

cessfully, although she had
sworn that she would never

thought him such an odd
fish, that she could not, for
laughter, withstand his
suit. He wooed and won
Ceres in the form of a
horse ; Ceres, probably,
priding herself upon being
a horsewoman. He turned
himself into aram to throw
sheep's eyes at Theophane;
and they hit her. To gain
Tyro, he dissolved his god-
head into a river, and
flowed into her good graces
in that way. These are
only a few of his gallant-
ries. Considerably up-
wards of a dozen similar
exploits were achieved by
him. His family was nu-
Inerous.
From his earthquakerism
above alluded to, he was
termed Erosicthon and
Ennosigaios, which appel-
lations amount to Earth-
shaker. He was also called
Gaieochos, or “Circum-
ventor of the Earth ;"
which he was supposed to
circumvent, as he really
did circumvent the fair
sex. Another name of his,
was Poseidon; whether this was corrupted into Possy, Olympus
only knows.
Neptune was as handy in stirring up strife with that trident of his,
as he was in stirring up the waves. He stirred up the Greeks against
the Trojans at the siege of Troy, as the blind old gentleman of Scio's
rocky isle, whose name has appeared above, relates (see the eigh-
teenth rhapsody of the Iliad) at large. He also had a finger in the
33unty's 330mtstic 38tripts.
To keep Currant Wine for any time.—Bottle off and stack in bins as
usual. Then, at the head of each bin place a decanter of port, which keep
filled, as it will evaporate quickly. And as long as there is any port your
currant wine will be preserved admirably.
To make a seedy Cake.—Procure some common dough, the size of a
quartern loaf. Put in half a pound of plums, two small bits of citron,
and a tea-spoonful of moist sugar. Bake as usual, and keep until quite
stale. It will be a very seedy cake.
A Chicken Stew.—Shut up the door of the hen-roost, and throw in
lighted fireworks. It is soon accomplished.
To cure smoky Chimneys (an excellent way)-Lay the fire as usual with
coal and sticks, but be careful not to light it. This hath rarely been
known to fail, and is, at the same time, a great saving of fuel.
To Curry–The readiest way of doing this is to buy a comb sold on
purpose at the saddlers'. In France, where horse-flesh is eaten more than
in England, this will be found a good method, the horse being the animal
most usually curried.
To roast a Pike.—Go to the toll-house on Waterloo Bridge, and chaff
the toll-keeper respecting that valuable property. You can dish him at
the same time, by riding through behind a coach.
To make a Twelfth Cake.—Having manufactured eleven in any manner
you please, make another, and you will have a twelfth cake.

confederate deities on the walls; he told Dido so himself. The
reader will find the circumstance mentioned in the second book of
the AEneid. The walls of Troy were not a very flattering memorial
to him, so that it was very material that he should want to knock
them down.

And though I possess my destructiveness small,

If thus you are deaf to my vehement call.

On a head that for want of it once was quite flat;
If thus with my passion I find you contending,
My organs will swell till they’ve knocked off my hat.

For while I believe that by thee I’m beloved.
I'm told at my passion thou secretly sneerest;
But Oh, may the truth unto me ne'er be proved.

elbow, and the cuffs retroussés; a row of pins placed on the latter, one
above the other, greatly increases the effect; and a yard measure carried
negligently in the right hand, while the left arm supports a pacquet of
superior calicos, forms a tasteful and agreeable ensemble.
At a soirée musicale, given by Mr. Smith a few evenings since, in the

furniture pattern, so popular with the dummies at the leading Magasins
des modes ; the sleeves demi-large, the corsage made to button up to the
throat; what was worn under this we could not ascertain, but the trowsers
were gray tweeds, and the slippers tapissé's. The coiffure was a German
smoking-cap, with a worsted tassel, from under which the hair was
suffered to flow au naturel, and to meet the whiskers, which were trimmed
à-la-Sibthorp. Several of our élégants are now in the habit of carrying
two pocket-handkerchiefs, one for its ordinary purpose, the other to dus'
the boots previous to making an afternoon visit, though one sometimes
performs the duties of both. There is no change in the mouchoir; the

THE POETIC LAUREATESHIP.
It is understood that the first line to be established, is that to India;
the carriages leaving the top of the Monument. Fish Street Hill, every
morning, and taking five minutes at the summit of the Great Pyramid,
for refreshments, and to allow the passengers a short time to stretch their
legs. From this point balloons will be continually starting for the most
important cities of the African Desert.
The carriage is then to proceed to India, thus (should the weather be
not foggy) affording to the traveller a delightful coup d'oeil of the most
interesting countries of the East.
The arrangements are in every respect very complete.
Lord Brougham is understood to have accepted the office of Patron,
being himself of rather a flighty nature.
The provisions will be carried easily in the conductor's waistcoat; as
by a new invention, the essence of three sheep can be concentrated into a

fitted up in the Oriental style for that purpose

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAP. xIV.—I AM PURCHASED BY MADAME SPANNEU.—AN ILLUS-
TRATION OF HUMAN MOTIVES.
THE Countess being placed in mourning—such is the gentle, tender
phrase that indicates the call of death in high houses—I was cast
aside. Indeed, again and again before the Countess quitted London
for Canaan Hall—the family country-seat—I heard her vow that she
would leave the world for ever. Existence had lost its only value to
her; what was life without her darling child? Most vociferous was
her grief; whilst the Earl, with calm, deep sorrow, would gaze at
her, as I thought, with doubting looks. However, the day after the
death of her child, her ladyship departed to feed her misery in soli-
tude. She would henceforth employ herself among her husband's
tenantry; she would visit the sick, the widowed and the fatherless ;
again and again did she assure her husband that she would be quite
a blessing to the poor Hearing this, and finding myself cast care-
lessly by, I concluded that I, too, was doomed to a long retirement
from the bustling world. In little less than a week, I found it
otherwise.
One afternoon I found myself in the hands of Mrs. Pillow, who
declared me to be, with other matters—gowns, and gloves, and
cloaks, and shoes—her lawful property, by gift from the Countess.
This declaration was made by the housekeeper to a short, thin,
flauntily-dressed little woman, who evidently gazed at myself and my
companions with the depreciating looks of a purchaser.
“There, Madame Spanneu,” cried Mrs. Pillow, holding me daintily
between her thumb and finger, “I call that a beauty. It's a bit of
wirgin snow, and never been in my lady's head but once.”
“La, my dear,” said Madame, in a most affectionate tone, “feathers
fetch nothing. Indeed, I’m the greatest sinner alive if all business
isn't quite gone to the dogs.”
“Talking about dogs, Madame Spanneu, how 's your husband "
Thus spoke Mrs. Pillow ; and though the reader may feel that the
inquiry, dictated by a thought of the canine race, was scarcely com-
plimentary to Monsieur Spanneu, it was nevertheless the result of
association of ideas in the brain of the housekeeper ; for, as I after-
wards discovered, Monsieur Spanneu, Parisian born, was an enthu-
siast in poodles. They were to him as his own flesh and blood. He
was their “guide, philosopher, and friend ;” though truth compels
me to admit that he never hesitated to sell his pupils when he could
obtain a purchaser. His fame, indeed, was widely spread throughout
the fashionable world, and many were the declining maidens who
owed the prime consolation of their lives to the delicate tending of
Mons. Spanneu. Indeed, as I once heard him declare, all his dogs
were “dogs of sentiment.”
“How is Monsieur !” again inquired Mrs. Pillow.
“Bless your heart, my dear,” answered the partner of his soul,
“nothing ever ails the brute. Ha! my dear, it serves me right—I
would try to learn French, and I’m rightly served for it. That satin,
mydear, is stained in three places,” and Madame Spanneu pointed to
the spots on a rose-coloured gown.
“Well, I always thought it odd as how you could marry a French-
man,” said the housekeeper, sinking the spots of a garment in the
blemishes of a husband. “I didn't think it’s doing the right thing
by one’s own country.”
“My dear, I had my scruples; but then he said he was a count.
What shall I give you for the lot?”—and again Madame jumped
from thoughts conjugal to matters of business.
“Why, you shall give me—but we’ll talk of that down-stairs; I’ve
a little something, and such a glass of Madeira !” Saying this, the
housekeeper hurried Madame Spanneu from the apartment.
An hour, at least, had elapsed, and I, with the other perquisites,
was carried to the housekeeper's room; where I could not but acknow-
ledge the evidence of the potency of the Madeira. Mrs. Pillow's face
was luminous ; Madame Spanneu's eyes twinkled ; and a gentleman
whom I at once recognised as Mr. Curlwell, was chewing a bit of a
song, in which there were “Chloe's eyes” and “Chloe's lips,” and
“Chloe's balmy kisses.”
“Well, my love,” cried Madame Spanneu, for wine had enlarged
her heart and deepened her ordinary terms of affection,-4 well, my
love, if I've any weakness in the world, it's music.”
“That's me, all over,” said Mrs. Pillow with a slight titter, and as
I thought, an oblique half-look at Mr. Curlwell. Whether it was so
or not, that gentleman took a deep respiration, and again burst forth
in praise of “Chloe.”
“And when does Lady Blushrose come back, my love t” inquired
Madame Spanneu, between one of Curlwell's pauses.
“Bless your heart, nobody knows. She's a going to bury herself
from the whole world. Poor dear thing !” Thus sympathised Mrs.
Pillow.
Mr. Curlwell, leaning back in his chair and putting his thumbs in
his waistcoat, roared over his neckcloth—“She’ll be at Ranelagh in
a fortnight.”
“La how can you talk so And with that dear child upon her
mind To be sure, she knew as how it wouldn't live, if she didn't
nurse it: Well, it’s in Heaven,” cried Mrs. Pillow with an air of
satisfaction, by no means lessened by another glass of Madeira. “I
don’t know how it is ; between ourselves, people haven’t the hearts
they used to have when I was a girl.”
Madame Spanneu was about to press her lips to the glass : struck
by this melancholy verity, she paused an instant: then shaking her
head with deep significance at the housekeeper, she cried, “They
haven’t,” and tossed off the Madeira.
“The world's a getting still wickeder,” was the opinion of Mr.
Curlwell—“nobody now can trust nobody. I never thought much
of the Countess. Some people says she's handsome ; but she's not
my beauty.” Here, the valet looked dead in the face of Mrs. Pillow,
who—with the corners of her mouth slightly curling—said, “You’re
so partic'lar.”
“Poor thing I Still, you know, my dear,” cried Madame, “now
the baby's gone, the Countess must have something to like.”
“Try a poodle,” said Curlwell; “for my part, I hate a house with
babbies.”
“Well, what a man you are 1” exclaimed Mrs. Pillow, smiling.
“But after all, people with the money of the Countess can't feel grief
like us as are poor.”
“They haven't the hearts,” cried the valet in a loud voice, ex-
panding his chest.
“With a good deal of money, folks can bear a deal of trouble, and
be none the worse for it,” said the housekeeper.
“Trouble does 'em good–teaches 'em who's master,” vociferated
the valet, and again he drank the Earl's Madeira.
“Still, my love,” said Madame Spanneu, “I pity the Earl ; every-
body says, my dear, he's so much feeling.”
“Not a atom,” exclaimed Curlwell; his charity towards his supe-
riors fast vanishing with his sobriety. Indeed, I have no doubt that
the valet's firm belief was that all human goodness had for ever
quitted the drawing-rooms of the great and set up its “everlasting
rest” in the butler's pantry. Thus, he continued, “The Earl feel !
Pooh 1 Crocodiles, ma'am—crocodiles.”
“But really, Mr. Curlwell,” said Mrs. Pillow, “what motives, as we
may say, should his lordship have—”
“How do we know I Motives | Who knows anything about 'em
I don't trust to anything or anybody; if the Earl was to give me
five hundred a year to-morrow, should I thank him for it in my heart?
No : and why not : Why, because I should be certain he’d some
motive in it. Nobody does nothing without thinking of something.”
Such was at once the simple and enlarged philosophy of Lord
Huntingtopper's valet.
“My dear Mr. Curlwell, I do think you're right. I'm sorry to say
it : but something happened only yesterday at our house, that makes
me suspect everybody; yes”—said Madame Spanneu with emphasis
—“everybody.”
“Can't do better, ma'am,” cried Curlwell, again quaffing the
Madeira. “What was it f"
“Why, you know, my dear Mrs. Pillow, we lost our darling cat
three weeks ago.”
“Dear me !” cried the sympathising housekeeper.
“Well, my dear, about the middle of last week, a woman—a very
tidy, civil sort of body, comes to our house, and says to me, says she
—Marm, do you want a cat Why, my dear, says I, quite forgetting
who I was talking to—I do. Well, then, says the woman, here’s a
sweet little cretur; and with that, she does no more than take a black
kitten out of her basket, as she had under her cloak. There, said she
—there’s a little rose in June for you ; black as a coal ma'am :
search it all over, for I wish I may die if there's a white hair in it.
Well, my dear, I'm not superstitious; no, I should hope not ; still,
I know there's luck in a black cat. So I says to the woman, you re
very kind ; I'll take the cat with pleasure: it’s very good of you to
have brought it. Don’t name it, ma'am, says the woman ; who
would take no thanks at all for the matter. Well, I took in the cat,
and the woman goes away. You'd see nothing in that, would you,
my dear?”
“Nothing at all,” said Mrs. Pillow.
“Cat was mad, no doubt,” cried the charitable Curlwell.
“Not at all; as sensible and as well-behaved a cat as ever entered

a house,” averred Madame Spanneu. “But what do you think, my
dear 1 Yesterday, comes the very woman to me again. Marm, says
she, I hope you like the cat? Very much, my dear, says I. You'll
find it a beautiful mouser, marm, for I know its family. I’ve no
doubt of it at all, says I. Well then, says the woman, since you like
the cat so much, we can now come to business. What business says
I. Why, marm, says the woman, as Ibrought you the cat, you couldn't
do less than let me serve it Serve it—serve it with what? says I.
Why, with cat's-meat, says the woman. Couldn't think of such
a thing, says I, and I always feed my cat from my own table. Then
you should have heard her impudence. Why, says she, calling me
everything but a lady, I could have got the kitten a place in a
respectable family, yes a place in a squirre—and you never could be
such a fool—yes, my love, those were her words—you never could
be such a fool—could never know so little of life, as to suppose I’d
give you a cat, if it wasn't that I was to serve her with meat !”—
“Like all the world,” says Mr. Curlwell: and here ended Madame
Spanneu's chapter on human motives.
GREENWICH SAMARITANS.
An idiot boy, named Edward Wilson—a hapless, miserable
creature, robbed by a scoundrel, who was entrusted by the dying
mother of the child with ample means to provide for it, a poor,
withess, helpless creature, whose peculiar sufferings should have
made it almost a sacred thing to the sympathies of men, was a day
or two since presented to the humanities of the officers of the Green-
wich Union. He had wandered, hungry, houseless, and desolate—
“His feet,” says the report in The Times, “being literally dropping
off from filth and walking many miles,” when he was taken to the
Union. The door of that sanctuary turned upon its harmonious
hinges, and the boy was received for-one night! With the morning
he was thrust from the house ; flung, a noisome filthy thing in the
sensitive nostrils of the Greenwich Samaritans, to rob, to rot, to lie
down and die! What matters which The poor wretch was an
idiot; and still worse, he was a pauper; a thing of no more account
in this world than the mud and mire crushed by the carriage-wheels
of the rich. However, even poverty is tenacious of life—the greatest
misery takes much killing. West did not die; no, he lived and still
felt the fire of famine, the sores that crippled him. He was bronght
back to the Union, after three days' wandering, and was refused to
be taken in. Oh, ye smug Christian guardians of the Greenwich
sanctuary, what, when ye kneel at the gate of paradise, what if ye
should not—be taken in
NARRATIVE
of AN Excursion. To THE FROZEN LAKE OF THE GLACLARIUM.
unbeataken by MR. TippleDY winks, the celebrated traveller,
and communicated BY HIM.
Next to the ascent of Haverstock Hill, and passage of Hampstead
Heath, perhaps there is no excursion in the vicinity of London, requiring
such great exertions or heedlessness of danger as the one I am about to
describe. It should only be attempted by those capable of bearing intense
bodily fatigue, as well as those favoured individuals to whom a shilling is
not a coin of too great rarity, for at the very lowest rate of expenditure,
the trip cannot be accomplished under that sum.
Anxious to discover how far the accounts of previous travellers were
to be relied upon, I determined towards the close of the last month, upon
making the essay, uninfluenced by the attempts at dissuasion made, by
my too anxious mother, whom I finally resolved upon leaving in ignorance
of my absence from home when the time arrived. I spent the previous
day in making such preparations as the journey required, and as evening
approached, I set off from home unknown to any one: , I crossed the
large expanse of Cavendish-square, in safety; and then hiring a guide to
conduct me through the perplexing convolutions of Marylebone-lane, I at
last arrived in Baker-street, where I dimissed my attendant, resolved to
undertake the rest of the arduous task alone, or perish in the attempt.
On entering the large portals which conduct to the Valley, a bandit
rushed from some concealed fastness on my
right, and demanded my umbrella or my life.
IIe evidently imagined that I was some wealthy
traveller bound for the gilded regions of Tus-
saud, for on my mentioning that my business
was to explore the lake, he directly allowed me
a pass on my way, eyeing me with a pitying
glance, as if I had been a doomed pilgrim
to the centre of the great desert. I passed between the two ascents
conducting to the gorgeous realms just spoken of, and then directed by a
solitary placard on which was inscribed the chilling words “To the Ice 11”
—the sole directions the voyager can find in these lonely regions,—I en-
tered the dominions of gloom and solitude which conduct to the lake.
The noise of the peopled world now faded away, and in the faint light
that reigned around, I saw evidences of what the storms had been in these
savage districts. I counted nearly thirty travelling carriages which had
been abandoned—doubtless before the snow thawed—and left to decay,
presenting an appalling picture of loneliness. At the extremity of this
pass, I arrived at the frontier, where my appearance created some
surprise in the official there stationed. As soon as he had recovered from
his astonishment at my hardihood, he demanded a shilling as a toll, and
having inspected me minutely, gave me a provisionary passport, which
was demanded of me directly afterwards by another douanier, and I was
then allowed to approach the lake.
Passing a rustic dooringeniously cut through the rocks that surrounded
it, I entered a wooden chalet, situated at the edge of the lake, and com-
manding an entire view of its expanse. A dead silence reigned around
as I approached, but immediately afterwards one of the natives rushed
from a gorge of brown paper and whitewash at the extremity of the lake,
and performed several savage evolutious upon its surface. At this moment
a curious phenomenon presented itself. A man's hat and portion of his
head appeared over the snow-clad summit of a distant mountain, and,
having remained there for nearly half a minute, disappeared again. This
was doubtless a similar effect to the celebrated Spectre of the Brocken,
of which I had read. I can offer no other explanation.
I was enabled to discover, during my short sojourn, that water, when
frozen, becomes Epsom Salts; as I found out by tasting some of the hoar
frost on the shrubs at the edge of the lake. The natives I take to be a
musical people, as I perceived at the end of the gallery several instru-
ments, but whether these were left therefor visitors to amuse themselves upon
in the absence of other entertainments, or really belonging to some society of
the aborigines, I am unable precisely to determine. The curious fact of the
contiguity of vegetable life to the edge of the glaciers, was also shown
here, by some delicate exotics growing on the most exposed situations, nor
did I feel, after a time, so cold as I had expected to be. This might,
however, be owing to the approach of a thaw, as I perceived that the ice
had already given way in one corner, and the water was apparent. A
board placed over it and labelled “DANGERous,” showed that every care
was taken for the prevention of accident, and that English was understood
in the canton. The clouds hung so low that I could almost touch them
with my umbrella, and presented a curiously Vandyked appearance. As
I inferred a storm from this circumstance, as well as from hearing various
indistinct rumblings at a distance, in the direction of Madame Tussaud's,
I hastened to take my departure.
Providentially my return was effected without any accident, although I
was much exhausted, and tormented by a burning thirst, which might
possibly have arisen from some salt-beef I had eaten for dinner. I
reached the street in safety, where an omnibus, having doubtless heard of
my attempt, was waiting to receive me, and with very little more worth
mentioning, arrived safely at home, at nine in the evening.

SAPPHO MADE EASY.
ACT I.
What bustle, what row, what confusion, what fury,
Are prevalent now at the doors of Old Drury !
Every cab that goes by, every carriage that passes,
Is doom'd to sustain an attack on its glasses
From boys, who keep getting in every one's way,
With “book of the opera,” “bill of the phy.”
- º + ×
How cramm'd are the boxes—how closely they sit,
From the right to the left—from the slips to the pit
To the orchestra all now impatiently look—
When, baton in hand, in saunters Tom Cooke :
Of course of applause there's a vehement round,
Which Tom Cooke receives with obeisance profound ;
Then, turning his back with an affable grin,
He strikes on the lamp as a sign to begin.
The band has proceeded to play a few bars
When behind the green curtain are heard loud huszas.
The audience (although they scarcely know why.)
With applause of their own to the cheering reply.
The curtain is drawn : in a manner superior,
It shows of the Circus the massive interior.
The people are raising a horrible din
Of roaring, and clapping, and shouting within;
The row being aided, there is not a doubt,
By carpenters, dressers, and all who can shout,
And e'en the hall porter is called from the door
To help the effect of this classical roar.
§§§
The Circus is opened an instant, and then
We catch a short glimpse of a number of men
Applauding and shouting, with fury and might,
For the moderate sum of a shilling per night.
The Circus is closed—but it opens again,
When somebody from it is thrust with disdain :
At once we perceive, by the figure and face,
The outcast is Phillips, the principal bass ;
From this it appears, that there's not a doubt,
The ancients would sometimes exclaim “Turn him out !”
And further inquiry, perhaps, might discover
A classical term for the cry “Throw him over !”
The part, by H. Phillips sustained, is Alcander,
A personage doom'd in affliction to wander.
That Sappho he hates is excessively clear,
But to him she once—he alleges—was dear,
Though greatly 'twould puzzle himself to say why
He loved her or hates her, unless, by the bye,
His feelings with those of the bard to compare,
Afford him a pretext for singing an air
Of which the slow movement relates to the past,
But his anger is taken exceedingly fast.
“Affection once cherished ”—the hautboy and flute,
Then Allen, the principal tenor, appears,
As Phaon, in flesh-coloured leggings and tears,
Declaring that Sappho has spurn'd and betray'd him,
In fact, an unfortunate devil has made him.
Alcander then asks why on earth he is reclining,
While Climene he's slighted and left to repining ;
And tells him how foolish it is thus to bother
Himself about one when he might have another.
Then Phaon agrees he'll abjure her, and leave her,
For acting the part of a faithless deceiver.
Away then they go—and a general bellow
Announces the entrance of Clara Novello.
She slowly advances, right down to the float,
And even before she has utter'd a note,
The audience join in a boisterous round
Of applause, for which Sappho makes curtsies profound.
An air she commences, deploring her fate,
In the time of two-four, which is changed to six-eight:
She says that for Phaon she ever must burn,
And bids him, if not out of hearing, return.
Then Phaon comes in, having waited close by,
Though when he went out he had sworn he should fly;
A duet then occurs between Sappho and Phaon,
The latter abuse begins thickly to lay on,
Declaring that Sappho has desolate made him,
That sadness and madness with torments unmade him,
That jealousy's pangs he's unable to smother,
Because he is certain she favours another.
She swears it is false—and requests him to come.
He declares all her vows of affection a hum.
And the audience, not knowing which may be right,
Receives the duet with a storm of delight.
The Chorus takes part against Phaon, and warn him,
'Twould serve him quite right were the lady to scorn hiºn.
And into the Circus they bid her repair,
For glory they tell her is waiting her there.
The anger of Phaon she tries to appease
By rushing to Allen and clutching his knees.
Poor Allen, of course, is unable to flinch,
Such things on the stage must be borne at a pinch.
From Sappho's hard gripe he can’t get aloof;
Like a jackass who carries a log to his hoof,
He stands in the centre—and, more to confound him,
The Chorus are angrily bellowing round him.
By plunging and kicking, with desperate strength,
His leg he succeeds in releasing at length.
And Sappho, poor creature extended before us,
Sinks back in the arms of a man in the Chorus;
Who, thinking the fate of her ankles uncertain,
Retreats to make sure they'll be clear of the curtain,
Which, amidst of applause a tumultuous burst,
Comes down with a run on the
END of Act FIRST.

166 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TREASONOUS ATTACK ON HER MAJESTY.
Punch has been greatly shocked by a very treasonable letter in
the columns of The Times. Whether Punch's friend, the Attorney-
General, has had the epistle handed over to him, and contemplates
immediate proceedings against “C. H.,” the traitorous writer, Punch
knows not : but after this information, the distinguished law-officer
cannot plead ignorance of the evil, as an apology for future supine-
ness. The letter purports to be a remonstrance to our sovereign
lady the Queen; in a measure, accusing her gracious majesty of a
certain degree of indifference towards the interests of London trade,
of literature, the arts and sciences. The rebel writes as follows:—
“Buckingham Palace is neither so agreeable nor salubrious a residence as Windsor,
but neither is the crown so pleasant to wear as a bonnet. I trust it is not necessary to
remind Queen Victoria that royalty, like property, has its duties as well as its rights. One
of these duties is to reside in the metropolis of the kingdom, the presence of the Sove-
reign in the capital being essential on many occasions. I could enumerate other duties
of the Sovereign, such, for instance as conferring fashion on public entertainments that
deserve to be encouraged by attending such places of amusement, and countenancing
science, literature, and the arts, by honouring distinguished professors with marks of
approbation; in which respect it is much to be regretted there is too much room for
those remarks on the remissness of Her Majesty in these respects that are so frequently
made in society. When we know how much discontent, engendered by widely-spread
and deeply-felt distress, is expressed by persons not to be numbered among ‘the lower
classes,’ it is not without alarm that the influence of these acts of omission on the part
of Queen Victoria can be regarded ; and it becomes thc duty of every friend of the
monarchy and the constitution to warn the Sovereign of the danger, not merely to her
personal popularity, but to the feeling of loyalty to the throne, that is likely to accrue
from such neglect.”
If all this be not “flat rebellion,” Punch knows not the meaning
of syllables. And then how basely unjust the insinuations ! In the
first place, is not her Majesty a constant play-goer 1 (See Punch
for the long and faithful reports of the Queen's state visits to Drury-
Lane and Covent-garden this season 1) Next for the “countenance
given to science " Why, was not her Majesty graciously pleased to
express her satisfaction with the photogenic impression of the Chinese
Treaty And then for art, does not the Queen sit at least once a day
for her portrait to Sir C. Ross, or some such national painter Have
we not, too, the very highest historical school royally patronized
in Royal Christenings —subjects, as Mr. Moon pathetically has it
on his show-cards, “so dear to the heart of every English mother "
A neglect of art | Why, is there a puppy of six weeks old in
Windsor kennel, that has not, by royal order, sat to an R.A.! Shall
we not, at the opening of the Royal Academy, have the most gorgeous
evidence of royal patronage of art, in the Queen's parrots, Queens
cockatoos, Queen's monkeys, Queen's gold-fish, shining and glitter-
ing from twenty frames at least ! And then, how has “C. H.”
the audacity to hint at an indifference to the persons of “distin-
guished professors” of literature, art, and science, at the palace
Why, was not Lord WILLIAM LENNox presented a day or two
since, solely on the strength of his Tuft Hunter P Is not the royal
dinner-table crowded with poets, philosophers, astronomers, sculptors,
painters, engineers ? Has Punch published so many Court Circulars
to so little effect Can the world be all as ignorant of the realities of
Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle as “C. H. 1" who—in con-
clusion—we once more recommend to the urbanity of the Attorney-
general.
A “I.O.AF" OR AN “ EYE 1"
SoME time since, Louisa Bolton, in the frenzy of intense hunger——
she had, too, a pining child in her arms—stole a loaf from a baker's
in the Walworth-road. She was sent to gaol, and at the expiration
of two months was tried, receiving sentence of four months’ further
imprisonment; in all, six months' incarceration. She took the child,
it was then healthy, to gaol with her, where it “wasted away almost
to a skeleton,” and a day or two since died, the jury returning a
verdict of “Natural death.”
Last week, a man named Bennett, “gentleman,” was tried at the Old
Bailey for plunging a fork into a man's eye, by which the organ was
entirely destroyed. We pass the suffering, the agony of the man, and

The offender Bennett is sentenced to six months' imprisonment; in
fact (for he was out on bail), to the same punishment inflicted upon
Louisa Bolton, famishing with a famishing child,—for stealing a loaf.
Sacred things, indeed, are the Corn-laws—sacred and thrice sacred
is “property.” Take a man's loaf off his counter, and you take his
eye from his head. The punishment being the same, the offence
mºst, of course, be equal.

We understand that at a meeting of London bankers and merchants,
held on Thursday, it was resolved to present to Mr. Rowland Hill,
the statuettes of PEEL, GRAHAM, and Goulburn in the very best

CHARIVAR 169
COCKNEY PRONUNCIATION.
AM a Cockney, Mr. Punch–
a Cockney from the crown
of my gossamer to the soles
of my high-lows. Not a heart
in all London yearns towards
its native wood-parement with
a purer love than that which
now beats beneath this “Co-
razza.”
Breathes there the man with soul
so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
As in the Strand he proudly stood,
“This is my own—my native—
wood.”
I am no cosmopolite—but a
metropolite in heart and pro-
nunciation. The world is not
my city; on the contrary, the
city is my world. I have none of those Indian-rubber heart-strings
which will stretch from one end of the earth to the other, and make a
man as ready to claim a settlement in the desert of Arabia, as he is in
the parish of Simmery Axe. Noram I even a patriot; indeed I look
upon that ism as a kind of Whig virtue—a sort of finality measure of
affection—saying to the flood of one's sympathies, “thus far,” &c., as
Canute the Dane did to the sea, when, like a marine beadle, he went
out with his courtiers to beat the boundaries of the ocean. Either
patriotism is a petty prejudice—a thing of roods and perches—or else
it is an extensive swindle, calling upon a man to spread his heart
over 57,000 and odd square miles, and to love 16,000,000 and upwards
of individuals, which I freely confess my nature is not sufficiently
amatory to enable me to do. It is true we are told that the increased
facilities of conveyance have reduced the distance which formerly
alienated one Englishman from another. But this I class as exten-
sive swindle No. 2. For since the fares by the railroads remain the
same as they were by the coaches; and distance, as metaphysicians
tell us, is but the synthesis of space and time ; and time, as every
shop-boy knows, is money, I flatter myself I very logically conclude
that John O'Groat's is now just as far from the Land's End as ever it
was. Nevertheless, I readily allow that the great chancellor who
presides on the coach-box of the Chelsea omnibus did, by lowering
the fare from Battersea Bridge to Mile End from one shilling to six-
pence, bring “the two great seas of Chel and Batter” as near again
to the metropolis, and convert Mile End into half mile ditto. But
notwithstanding this, I am content to confine my affections within
the walls of London, and to limit my love to the 80,000 beings they
are said to include, which number surely is quite enough for a man—
whose heart is not like a carpet-bag capable of holding any quantity—
to contain in his bosom at one time. My sympathies never go west
of Temple Bar. Tanner, the illustrious hair-dresser at the side of it,
who shaves gentlemen with their toes in London and their chins in
Middlesex, is the last link in the chain of my affections. The manu-
facturer of the incomparable ointment, who lives immediately be-
yond—Holloway—is to me an alien.
With this slight preamble, Mr. Punch, I, with your permission,
will take up the cudgels and enter your lists as champion of the
Cockney Pronunciation, in token whereof I now throw down my
berlin. Having been some time in training upon the Indo-Teutonic
languages, I am ready to back myself against any light weight in
Sanscrit, Gothic, Icelandic, or Anglo-Saxon, to prove that there is no
truth—no not one iota—and more especially one w (the London
digamma, by the way), in the rules for teaching my fellow-citizens
to speak English, laid down in the introduction to the pronouncing
dictionary of Walker. I think I hear some of your readers at the
West End cry “Walker.” If, however, any one should feel inclined
to give went to sitch a hexclamation, I will shortly show him how
hunclassical it is to adopt sitch a position as hism. But I turn up
my cuffs, and proceed with alacrity to the proof, merely remarking,
by the way, that any opponent I may now have will, I flatter myself
—if he but take the trouble to read on—soon be compelled to axe
for Kevarter—instead of Quarter, as he in his ignorance, doubtlessly,
would have termed it.
* I quote from a young barrister (would I could say rising.) I make this acknow-
ledgment, because it would be base indeed to rob the briefless.
In the first place, then, I must inform you that those great philo-
logical genealogists, who have busied themselves in tracing the
pedigree of the different languages, agree in considering the Sanscrit
as the great-grandfather of a very large family, and that his three
principal children were the Celtic, or Welsh ; the Hellenic, or Greek;
and the Teutonic, or Gothic. The Greek gave birth to the Latin,
while the Gothic had twins, which were christened Alemannic and
Saxon—commonly known as High and Low Dutch. The High Dutch
was the language of the Alemanni and Francs, or superior Germans,
i. e. polonies; the Low Dutch, the language of the Angles, Friesians
and Jutes, or small Germans,
i. e.—sareloys. Now, the Gothic and Welsh being brothers to the
Greek, it is evident that they each stood in the relation of uncle to
the Latin, and while the Latin was first cousin to the High and Low
Dutch, these two were respectively the nephews of the Greek and
Welsh. But the next of kin to the Latin are the French, Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese—to the Old High Dutch modern German
—and to the Old Low Ditto modern Flemish—hence the present
languages of Germany and the Netherlands bear to those of France,
Italy, Spain and Portugal, the very natural relation of cousins-german.
Respecting the English, a case of affiliation is generally made out
against the old Low Dutch or Saxon ; but as I consider our language
far from thoroughbred, I shall for the present withhold the names of
its supposed parents. Suffice it—it may, like all the modern Euro-
pean languages, be classed as the great-grandchild of the Sanscrit.
It now remains for me to apprise you it has been discovered that
the words of the different languages above mentioned, in emigrating
from one country to another, have found—like Londoners settled in
the backwoods of America—considerable difficulty in the transmis-
sion of their letters; and that all the fun created by the far-fetched
derivations of the etymologists of former times has arisen—as it in-
variably does in your cut-and-dry comedies of the present day—from
an ignorance of the regular change of letters. These philological
international laws have been accurately laid down by Dr. J. Grimm,
in his “Deutsche Grammatik,” and are known to the learned world
under the name of Grimm's Canon, which you will perceive is some-
thing like Queen Elizabeth's pocket-pistol at Dover—carrying from
one country to another. This Canon I now proceed to discharge :-
Greek and Gothic and I Greek and Gothic and I Greek and Gothic and
Latin. Anglo-Saxon. Latin. Anglo-Saxon. Latin. Anglo-Saxon.
P changes into F D changes into T G changes into K
F into B T into Th K into H
B into P Th into D Gr. Ch Lat.H into G
To open the eyes of the vulgar, I give a solitary example—Greek,
O-dous, o-dont-os; Latin—Dens, dent-is; Gothic, Tunth-us; Anglo-
Saxon, Tóth ; English, Tooth.
Hence, we may imagine the Goths and Anglo-Saxons singing—
concerning the change of the Greek and Latin D, as in the example
above cited—
Oh no, we never mention it,
As T with us 'tis heard,
Our lips the D object to speak
In a Greek or Latin word.
And as the liquids, l, m, n, r, appear in their several transmigrations
to undergo no alteration whatever, we may, by a like stretch of fancy,
conceive each of those letters joining in chorus, saying—
But were I in a foreign land,
They'd find no change in me.
Having, then, erected “these desirable premises,” and fortified them,
moreover, with the Canon of the redoubtable Grimm, I come in due
order to show that the friendly interchange of the v's and w's, which
so pre-eminently distinguishes the Cockney dialect from all others,
is in perfect harmony with the genius of the English language. But

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
as this involves a question of history as well as philology, I am afraid,
Mr. PUNch, that the tether you allow my pen will compel me to defer
the consideration of that subject till a future period. For the present,
however, I will conclude with a slight exposition of the infinite supe-
riority, in purity and elegance, of the London verb, “to are,” over the
Middlesex vulgarism “to ask.” The Londoners take their word, neat
as imported, from the Anglo-Saxon Arian, or Acsian, whereas the
Middlesexons have, by their senseless and ignorant contortion of its
intestinal consonants (changing it to Ascian), so disfigured the term,
that, were Beowulf to be galvanized out of his grave, he would be
obliged to consult Johnson to discover its meaning. As well might
we talk of the world revolving on its askis, or translate the immortal
line of Homer—
while ruthless he
Spar'd not to smite them with his murd’rous ask.
But, to fell all doubts on the point, I lay the London Are to the
Anglo-Saxon root:—
Anglo-Saxon—Axian, axigean, or Acsian, acsigan, to inquire.
Middlesex—Ask.
Cockney—Axe.
Thus the Anglo-Saxon, “man ne dorste arigean,” is, rendered into
elegant English—no man durst are—vulgo, ask.
However—on Reason's head reasons to accumulate—I add a few
quotations from the fathers of the English language —
Rob ERT LANGLAND, or rather LoNG DALE, says, in his “Vision of
I’iers Ploughman,” speaking of Mercy and Truth—
“when thyse maydennes mette
Either ared other of thys gret wonder.”
Wiclif writes—
“Ye witen not what ye aren.”
And CHAucer, in “The Milleres Tale,” has the following passage,
tride 3557–
“But Robin may not wete of this thy knave,
Ne eke thy mayden Gille I may not save ;
Are not why—for though thou are me
I woll not tellen goddess privetee."
To bring the subject to a grand climax, I beg to present the reader
with a literal but pure Anglo-Saxon wersion of that exquisitely
London ballad, entitled
“ All Round MY HAT,”
where, it will be remembered, the word are is introduced with a most
felicitous elegance. In gratitude for this offering, let the reader,
who aspires to speak and write his language in its native purity, make
the following entry in the Gazette of his Memory—“Are to be
Captain of the Interrogatives, vice Ask—resigned.”
All round my hat I wears a green willow,
All round my hat, for a twelvemonth and a day,
And if any one should are me the reason why I wears it,
It is all for my true love what is far far away.
Anglo-Saron Wersion of the above.
Eall ymbe" minne hastic werige grenne welig,
Eall ymbe minne haet for tweolfinonS and anne dag,
And gif a nig me ware arian, bone welig whilic werige,
Hit is for minne treowne lufiend hwæt is feor feor awarg.

Whrn does a street-scamp resemble a tattered tea-cake?—When he's a rag

* “Round” is a Low Dutch and Danish word. The Anglo-Saxon has only Rand or
Rond, signifying a shield, a border, margin, or rim—which, indeed, is one of the senses
of the Danish Rand or Rund, round. Richardson derives the Fnglish Round from the
Latin Rotundus—Bah! Rot-undus is from the Lat. Rot-a, a wheel ; and this from the
Angl. Sax. Rid-an, to ride (see Grimm's Canon), whereas the Dutch or Danish Rond
and Ang. Sax. Hand are from the Dut. Ronn-en, Dan. Rende, Angl. Sax. Renn-an : all
:::::.." to run, to flow. Heuce the several meanings, a margin, or rim, round, and
a stiltiti.

CURious Occurrence.—Since the New Stone-Henge Town has been

took a peck of oats at the Griffin public-house (the Anti Corn-Law Hotel)

INTERESTING Extract from The LAST BRIDGEwATER TREATIse. By
PROFEssor KIRBY.—“Such is now the progress of general knowledge,
that the nation is absolutely losing its ancient vulgarisms. No person,
however limited his education, would now inquire the precise meaning of
the phrase “a brace of shakes.” No one, in these days, would observe
that his risible friend “grinned like a Cheshire cat:” nor would any
person, to express his alacrity, state that he would be with you “in a pig's
whisper,” or “the twinkling of a bed-post.” The most simple child, in
these times, would disdain to inquire for either “pigeon's milk,” or
“strap oil;” and at the same moment would not acknowledge that he was
“as silent as a church mouse.”
Market Drayton.
It is, we understand, the intention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer
to propose several new taxes, to come into operation in 1844. Amongst
which will be imposed a duty on Black-beetles, on House-sparrows, on
broken Glass Bottles stuck on walls, at 2s. per foot; on posting placards, at
18d., per yard. The hair-powder tax is to be repealed, as it produces
nothing.
These enlightened measures will assuredly appease the vituperative
wrath of the Parisian journalists; if not, why, the sooner the two nations
come to open collision the better.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER xIV.-PERTAINING TO PLUTO AND HIS PREMISES.
Pluto was the monarch of the Shades below. The Shades below,
like the Shades above, were wine and spirit vaults ; the wine depart-
ment corresponded to Elysium, while spirits were to be met with
everywhere. The spirits, however, were not spirits of wine, but
the spirits of individuals; though it is not unreasonable to sup-
pose that in Elysium there was a little grog, too. The kingdom
of Pluto was divided into two regions, one for gentlemen, the
other for blackguards. The whole territory was encompassed by
the river Styx, which must have flown with some remarkably
good liquor, for we read that the gods used to swear by it.
Its waters are said to have been very dark; perhaps, if they
were not fit to drink, they may have served for blacking, which
might have been sworn by, as men swear by Day and Martin. Over
this stream there was a ferry, belonging to one Charon, who would
have been the Tom Tug of the nether world if he had been “a jolly
young waterman ; ” but he happened to be a surly old one. It was
his office to row the dead over to the other side of the stream ; but
there were two classes of passengers whom he would not take, those
who were not buried as well as dead, and those who had no money.
What his fare was is not known, nor has what he did with it, beyond
putting it in his pocket, which it may be plausibly conjectured that
he did, been ascertained. That the old fellow, however, had an
“itching palm,” is certain. When Æneas went below to pay his
respects to his governor Anchises, Charon, beholding him approach
the bank, gruffly told him to get out, and wait till he was dead, and
not to come there where he had no business; but on the hero's show-
ing him a certain golden branch which he had in his coat pocket, and
uttering the simple monosyllable “twig 1" the sulky old rascal was
mollified in a twinkling; grinned, cocked his eye, and let him in

laid about their sides like a merciless Turk.
Passengers were conducted by Charon to the gate of the infernal
regions, where the first object that met their sight was a hideous and
gigantic bull-dog, with three heads, answering to the name of Cer-
berus, who barked and flew at them of course; according to the
nature of the beast. This elegant and gentle creature had a fillet of
vipers round his throat, occupying the place of the pink ribbon with
which a young lady encircles the neck of her Fidèle. When heroes
during their lifetime had occasion to visit the Shades, they usually
flung him a cake or a bone to stop his mouth. Orpheus set him to
sleep by playing “Lullaby Bow-wow-wow" to him on his lyre. Her-
cules dragged him out of his kennel and cuffed him with a strong
hand into civility.
Over the gates of the place never to be mentioned to ears polite,
there was an inscription, which, according to Dante, recommended
those about to enter to discard all hope. There are, however, good
grounds for supposing that it really was no other than
“Ici on PARLE FRANÇAIa.”
The ghosts, immediately on having passed the portal, were brought,
as the phrase is, to book. They were placed, all hands, in the dock,
before Lord Chief Justice Minos, Mr. Baron AEacus, and Mr. Justice
Rhadamanthus, who, after giving them a fair and impartial trial,
proceeded to pass upon them the sentence of the law, according
to their several deserts. They were then conducted, whether in a
van or not is uncertain, to their respective destinations. These were,
as above stated, two-fold, corresponding to the two great classes into
which mankind may be divided. The accommodations provided for
the blackguards in Tartarus were appropriate, but not agreeable.
Virgil says, that if he had a hundred mouths, with a tongue in each,
and a voice of iron, he should be unable to enumerate them. The ob-
ject in view was to purify the culprits of the stains which they had con-
tracted during life. Some were ventilated on clothes-lines, others
ducked, others roasted ; and for all, fetters and whipping-cheer were
abundantly provided by the Furies. The lowermost apartments, at a
temperature of 612°Fahrenheit, were appropriated to the Titans, and
to a gentleman of the name of Salmoneus, who had been impudent
enough to mimic Jupiter by driving about Greece in a four-in-hand,
brandishing a lantern, and roaring in imitation of thunder. Had
there been a Covent Garden or Drury Lane at Athens, what would
have become of the managers? Thunder was a patent Olympic
property, and Jupiter was tenacious of his privilege.
With the other incorrigibles on the ground-loor, there was confined
a certain Tityus, for presumptuously, sacrilegiously, and high-
treasonably, daring to make love to Latona. He lay on his back,
with a vulture continually amusing himself by preying on his liver;
which grew as fast as it was eaten. The vulture had a great deal to
swallow : so has the reader, particularly as he has to be informed
that the said Tityus was nine acres long. Ixion and his son
immediately. All the unburied and insolvent, however, who wanted Pirithous, for similar impertinence to Juno and to Proserpine, had
to press after the warrior, he sternly repulsed with his oar, which he also this pleasant lodging assigned to them.
The prison attendants were those particularly agreeable young
ladies, the Furies, who had snakes for hair, goggle eyes, and tiger's
teeth, among other personal attractions. They bore torches, and
whips of scorpions; with which pretty playthings they amused then-
selves, at the expense of the prisoners. They would spread tables
before the culprits, Joaded with turtle, venison, game, ducks, green
peas, and every delicacy of every season; and when the famished
rogues attempted to help themselves, would yell, roar, scream, and
drive them away. Could not the Poor Law Commissioners introduce
this system into the workhouses 1
Other individuals, consigned to places higher in situation, but
lower in temperature than that above-mentioned, had, nevertheless,
a pretty time of it. There was Tantalus, who, for pocketing nectar
and ambrosia at the tables of the gods, to which he had been ad-
mitted, was stationed up to his chin in a pool of water, which, the
moment he attempted to quench his thirst with it, was caused, by an
ingenious hydraulic contrivance, to sink from beneath his lips. Then
there were the Danaides, forty-nine princesses, who to oblige their
papa, Danausking of Argos, divided their husbands' jugulars on their
wedding night, for which they were condemned to fill with water a
vessel full of holes; a task calculated to take some little time. There
was also a notorious thief, robber, and vagabond, of the name of
Sisyphus, who was doomed to perpetual hard labour, which consisted
in rolling a huge stone up a mountain ; the stone no sooner reaching
the top than it tumbled back, knocked him down, and fell bounding
over the precipices to the plain below.
Rogues of less magnitude, and capable of reformation, were more
lightly dealt with. Some were simply imprisoned for longer or
shorter terms ; others underwent a certain probation on the tread-
mill, or in the hulks on the Phlegethon, a river which ran through
Tartarus, and which some wiseacre had set on fire. Almost evervi
body, as Anchises told AEneas, had a few scores against him to be
wiped off, and there were not many, even of the best, who did not
find themselves, on being brought before Minos, at least “in for
three months.”
Virgil does not mention that in the lowest pit of Tartarus there
were any sharp practitioners, bill discounters, or sheriffs' officers;
whence it is fair to conclude that those varieties of the scoundrel
were unknown to the ancients.
Elysium, into which good people and reformed rogues were
admitted, was a spacious and pleasant green meadow, with a sun,
moon, and stars of its own, cool streams, quiet valleys, and shady
groves. In fact, it was very much like a fairy scene at a theatre.
except that the atmosphere, instead of being contaminated with gas
and redolent of orange-peel, was singularly pure. The happy occu-
pants of this region enjoyed perpetuai annusements, which consisted
in wrestling, boxing, and other manly exercises; skittles, among
other things, of course. Some danced, others sang, others recited
poetry, others, again, played the fiddle, and all hands made love.
Those who liked philosophy, talked it; those who were of a facetious

turn made jokes. Elysium abounded in every luxury, from Tokay
and pine-apples, to pipes and beer. Who would like to leave ºugh a
place if he once got in it No work, plenty to eat, and unlimited
“goes : " However, after a thousand years, all were obliged to turn
out. One glass of Lethe cold, was served round to each. , Lethe was
a river of the nether regions, which had the power of inducing obli-
vion; a property which sages have also observed in brandy-and-water.
The drinkers at once forgot all their happiness, and were born into
the world anew. Surely there must be something in this. Who has
not derived from a whisper in the trees, from a sparkle in the river,
from a light in the heavens, but above all, from sad, sweet, solemn
music, an indistinct memory of long lost, unutterable joy! Perhaps
in some of us the dose of Lethe did not quite perfectly operate. But
we are forgetting Pluto.
Pluto was one of the children of old Saturn and Ops. He was also
called Hades, Dis, Clytophylon, Agelastus (which signified glum)
Orcus, and other names. Herein he had a like fortune to that of the
personage who, according to modern ideas, corresponds to him, and
who is denominated, not to speak vulgarly, Ancient Henry, Antique
Nicholas, and so forth. The complexion of this divinity inclined
slightly to the sooty, and his features were grim and dismal; so that
he looked like a stage Othello. He had a sort of pitchfork with two
teeth, by way of sceptre; but the ancients, in depicting him, dispensed
with horns and tail. Black bulls were sacrificed to him; their blood
being converted into black puddings, by being poured into a hole in
the ground and allowed to coagulate. The cypress, and other mourn-
ful plants, were sacred to him, as was everything unlucky, particularly
number two—Heaven defend number one from his acquaintance 1
SIMPLE QUESTIONS.
Colonel Sibthorp had a simple question to ask. He merely wanted to
know, in the event of Bedlam breaking loose, what would be done with
Oxford and M'Naughten. Sir R. Peel said, he should not pledge himself
to any particular course, but the Government would no doubt be prepared
for the event whenever it might happen.
Colonel Sibthorp was glad that the Ministers would not be taken quite
unawares, and the conversation ended.
Mr. Hume wished to put a simple question. He had heard the other
night, that no damage had been done at the British Museum, through the
admission of the public, except by a boy who had fallen through a pane
of glass and broken a window. He (Mr. Hume) would ask for a return
stating the boy's name, and the size of the glass ; together with the posi-
tion in life of the lad himself, and a biographical sketch of the glazier who
had repaired the damage. He would also ask—since it was not the subject
of a separate item—whether the glass had been paid for out of the secret
service money. (Hear.)

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAP. xv. – I AM OF MADAME SPANNEU'S STOCK.—GOSSIP OF GOWNS
AND CLOAKS.–SHORT HISTORY OF A SCARLET-HEELED SHOE.
WHEN I next saw the light, I found myself among the cast-off
finery which formed the stock in trade of Madame Spanneu. There
I was, in tolerably good company, to be sure ; but with fallen com-
panions : with degraded silks; cashiered taffeties; expelled satins;
velvets, thrust for ever from the society of the great. Nor was I
alone—a solitary plume. There were feathers, thick as snow-flakes,
upon Madame Spanneu's shelves. Thus, though at first I felt a
sinking of the spirit—though, as I remembered my former glory,
when I nodded above the baby prince, I felt a sort of sickness from
the close, musty atmosphere about me, I soon became reconciled to
my condition. Indeed, there was great jollity among us. . For two
or three nights—for it was only at night that the talk and flu began
—I and my companions maintained the dignity of sulks. We were,
however, speedily laughed into good temper; and then we ourselves
laughed with the loudest. Every day Madame Spanneu added to
her stock: thus, every night gave us fresh matter of enjoyment.
We were wont to receive the newcomers as hardened jail-birds
welcome culprits on their first captivity; grinning them out of their
sorrow ; jesting them into obduracy. Indeed, so hardened, so
reckless was I become, that had I been selected for the head of
even Garrick, I do not think—such is the infection of lawless com-
pany—I should have been sensible of the abasement.
I am not about to reveal the secrets blabbed by my companions :
but this advice, my love for mankind—badly as I have been treated
by the race—compels me to give. Never, gentle reader, so long as
you have a stitch about your anatomy, believe yourself alone. If
thoughtless people could only know what their left-off clothes say
about them, sure I am, they would resolve upon one of two things;
either to reform their lives, or to go naked. Let no man harbour a
black spot in his breast, and believe that his waistcoat is wholly
ignorant of the stain. Let no man drop an ill-gotten guinea into
his pocket, and think the poke unconscious of the wrong. His very
glove—though it reek with civet—shall smell and babble of the bribe
that has burnt his hand. His cravat shall tighten about his throat,
if that throat be seared with daily lies. Ignorance of man to believe
that what is borne upon the body has no intelligence with the moral
good or evil dwelling in the soul; to think that the purple of a Dives
knows not the innermost arrogance of its bearer; that the rag that
flutters upon Lazarus breathes not the sweetness of a May-day
blossom. I know that people who believe themselves courageous
thinkers, may call this a superstition. I will not argue it : but I
will say, there may be worse. However, it is perhaps well for poorer
men that the rich put no faith in such bigotry; for if folks were
once assured that their cast-off garments could reveal all the deeds
and speculations of the wearers, great, indeed, would be the man who
could afford to give away an old coat . No : we should have even
prime ministers and kings' conscience-keepers burning their clothes
in their bolted bed-chambers, cautiously and secretly as a gallant
burns his Paphian letters the night before pistols.
The stories I heard whilst on the shelf of Madame Spanneu made
the white down upon me stand upright as the down of a thistle.
IHow the gowns were wont to discourse ! How the short cloaks
would giggle with merriment How the very gloves would lisp
their little adventures Nay, there was a high scarlet-hoeied shoe
—an odd one,—can I forget the story with which it would make
every gown and petticoat heave and flap again with laughter, as
it told—and we had the story with every newcomer—the curious
incident by which, in a scuffle, it lost its fellow ! This shoe was a
very old shoe : it had been in the possession of Madame Spanneu's
predecessor, flung aside amongst other odds and ends, and having for
many years outlived the fashion, and being in a state of widowhood,
had no hopes of returning to the world again. Hence, the great
delight of this scarlet-heeled shoe was to prattle all the scandal it
could remember and, I believe, invent, of the sphere from which it
was irrevocably banished. Nay, often the shoe would receive a
smart reprimand from a peach-coloured satin, which would declare
itself ready to turn red at the absurd prattle of “the old wretch,”
that would extend its sides with laughter, mocking the censure.
Then, I remember, there was a grave long-trained pompadour that
would continually beg to know what the scarlet-heeled shoe took
them for ; adding that its fittest place, after what it had seen, or
professed to see, in this naughty world, would be a convent, and to go
the rest of its life down-at-heel in penance for past iniquities. At
these rebukes the shoe would laugh immoderately, its high, glowing
heel rapping, in a spasm of merriment, against the shelf like a street-
door knocker. The worst of it was, the shoe would never let any
other companion tell its history; the shoe insisting that the narrator
had, in the course of the story, determinedly omitted various matters
which the said shoe, with more loquacity than charity, would insist
upon supplying. There was, I particularly remember, a darling little
smoke-coloured satin cloak, trimmed with death-black lace—a beauti-
ful, quiet, modest thing, that Diana herself might have worn of nights.
when she slipped out to chat with Endymion ; well, the envious shoe
would never let the smoke-coloured cloak tell its story. Five suc-
cessive nights it tried hard to do so, but still the shoe would so
pervert the motives of the cloak—would so minutely finish particulars,
where the cloak merely intended a general sketch—would so insist
upon Dutch painting, when the cloak, for reasons of its own, merely
wished an outline in the faintest chalk—that at length, the patience
of the cloak was worn out, and the tender little thing in a rumple of
passion that astonished a very staid lutestring—a late Lady Mayoress
by-the-bye—began to use its tongue so rapidly, and to call such
names, that there was a general rising and shaking of gowns to smother
the invective. I particularly remember, too, that a pompadour,
with all the majesty of the court of Louis Quatorze, begged the smoke-
coloured cloak, if only for the sake of other ladies, to remember that
“there were feathers present.” And then there was a sudden hush
—and then a murmur—and then whispering sounds, in which, how-
ever, I clearly distinguished the words—“don’t know where it may
go to”—“wretches of men"—“amongst all sorts of people ;” and
then, for the first time, a sense of my equivocal position came upon
me. I them felt myself as belonging to no party. To-day, I might
be in the head of a chaste and gentle countess, to-morrow in
the hat of some masque-hunting, unprincipled gallant. I could
not but acknowledge the prudence of the pompadour. I felt myself
a kind of being of a harem ; endured, but never to be taken cor-
dially into confidence. I own the thought saddened me ; but I was
speedily drawn from myself by the loud, saucy voice of the scarlet-
heeled shoe, who cried—“Feathers be fiddled ! I don’t care what
they hear ! So swear away, little smoke-colour; say your worst, my
darling; and then let me try if I can’t beat you !”
The cloak, folding itself in dignity, deigned no answer; and for a
time, there was a pause, only interrupted by the low, malicious
chuckle, and witch-like snigger, of the scarlet-heeled shoe. I hope,
however, that without being treasonous to my trust, I have sufficiently
warned my beloved female readers. Again and again let me tell
them, there is peril in silk—there is danger in satin—yea, jeopardy
in a bit of riband. When they are assured that cast-off gowns can
babble—that cloaks can give tongue—that gloves may turn a secret
inside out, -nay, that I have known even the tag of a stay-lace stab
a reputation,-when they know all this, let them be the “silver
lining” of the silken clouds that swing between them and the world,
—and in the innocency of their thoughts, defy the gossip even of
those who have most closely known them.
Ere, however, I quit this part of my subject, I cannot refuse to
myself the desire of giving, in the words I heard it—ay, more than
twenty times:—
Çije Śljørt historm of a higi)=#eelsö 5:00t.
The shoe speaks.
“Once upon a time—for I shall give no other register—there was
born in the English court a beautiful female child. She was the
daughter of a king's minister; but whether the first or the tenth,
what does it matter? I have heard it said, however, that it was the
minister (whoever he was,) who first put a tax upon shoe-leather;
for the which, if there be any truth in history, the punishment of
corns was first sent down upon high people.
“This child was christened; and great was the revelry at the
baptism. All the fairies then in England,-for upon some huff or
other the greater number of the good folk had quitted Britain,
flying, like a flight of swallows, from a cliff of Dover, like the swallows
no one knew whither—all the fairies who were too old to travel, and
so were left behind, came to the christening; and according to thoir
custom, as shown in many histories, brought an especial gift of good-
ness for the little suckling. One brought the voice of a nightingale
—one the grace of a fawn. One the simpleness of a lamb–one the
gaiety of a kid. And then she had all sorts of fairy clothing; with
a good gift and a blessing worked in every article. In truth, she was
clothed from top to toe from the workshops of the good people. She
wanted nothing, nothing but shoes. They had been forgotten ; and
great—great was the sorrow of the fairies; for unless the baby were
instantly shod, and that by fairy hands, it was doomed that the child

should go barefoot all its life. Unseemly and most uncomfortable
would this have been to the beauteous daughter of the minister of
the king. Everybody was in grief, and everybody asking everybody
what was to be done; when an old woman, where she came from
nobody can tell, appeared in the court, carrying myself and my little
sister, both of us then of baby size. ‘Here,' said the strange old woman
—“here, an it please you, are the shoes!’ But all the fairies cried out
witch—hag—devil,-and swore by all their fairy rings, by moonlight,
and by whatever else the good people hold solemn, that the babe
would be lost, if suffered to wear the old woman's shoes. What,
however, was to be resolved Either the child must have the shoes
then provided, or go barefoot. Now bare feet for the daughter of a
minister of a king was not to be thought of the child might as
well have been born a gipsy-beggar. Whereupon the king's minister
roso, and with a passionate voice cried—“Put on the shoes, put on the
shoes P-and immediately all the fairy folk vanished with a howl;
leaving the little old woman to fit her gift upon the child.
“Wonderful shoes were we : for we were no sooner on the feet of
the minister's daughter than we became fixed as her flesh, growing
hour by hour and day by day as her feet grew. And so we grew, and
so we agreed, for about seventeen years. It was impossible that there
could be a more loving pair of shoes. We were always whispering
in each other's ear; kissing one another; and behaving with the
greatest closeness of affection. This lasted for seventeen years: and
then, I know not how it was, a sudden aversion arose between us—
and, in the end, we never felt so happy as when we were apart.
“At length, it matters not how, I lost my companion, and the
minister's daughter in grief, in misery died. She had received every
good gift, but all was as nothing; what was each virtue under the sun,
when a beldame fairy had bestowed upon her wrangling shoes!”
This was the story of the High-heeled Shoe. I heard it over and
over again; but never without sounds of anger, contempt, or scorn
from the gowns, boddices, cloaks, and stomachers about me.
BRITISH COURTS OF JUSTICE.
HE Secondaries Court.—England is justly proud
of her Courts of Justice, and the Secondaries Court
being one of them, we presume that the national
pride embraces No. 5, Basinghall-street, which is
the locality of the court alluded to. The approach
from the west is not particularly imposing, unless
you happen to have come in a cab, and are charged
more than the regular fare—which is not at all im-
probable. Such is the modesty of British justice, that
the Secondaries Court, which is one of its abodes,
has nothing to distinguish it from the houses on
either side of it; the modesty of the exterior forms,
however, a striking contrast to the impudence of the
clerks within, who did not in any way facilitate the
writer of this article, when he applied to them for
tne necessary materials to enable him to give a succinct account of the
Court from the remotest periods. The structure itself is decidedly rude, but
the clerks inside are ruder. From the style of architecture—the windows
being square, and there being a door on one side, we should say the
building was begun under George the Third. It was probably repaired
under his successor George the Fourth, and fresh-painted under William,
surnamed the Sailor King; while, from its dilapidated condition, we should
say that it was going to the dogs under Victoria. There are no records
as to the laying of the first brick ; and on our requesting permission to
examine the first brick, with a view to groping under it for coins and in-
scriptions, we received no answer from the underlings. We do not
believe the excellent Secondary himself was a party to this extraordinary
conduct, nor do we include in our censure the Usher of the Court, who
readily told us all he knew, which unfortunately happened to be nothing.
On entering the door there is a partition on your right, behind which
are two clerks performing the duties of the Secondaries Office, which we
should say, must be rather light, for they did nothing but laugh and stare at
us all the time we were collecting our materials and making our inquiries,
with a view to this article. Over the chimney-piece is an eight-day clock after
Barwise. Proceeding in a straight line, for nearly three yards, you come
to an inner apartment, which is the Court itself, where justice is admi-
nistered. It combines with the dignity of a public tribunal the snugness
and comfort of a little back parlour. Immediately opposite to you on
entering is the judgment-seat, ingeniously erected on a mahogany table,
and unavoidably choking up the fire-place. So beautifully precise are all
the arrangements, that when the worthy Secondary is seated there, you are
no less lost in wonder at how he got up than at how he will get down
again. He seems like the key-stone of an arch, which cannot be disturbed
without the falling of the entire structure. If he moves an inch to the
right, it must be upon the heads of the counsel ; if he stirs to the left, he
must tumble into the jury-box. If he attempts to get out of his seat at
the back he is blocked in by the chimney-piece, and as to moving forward
he could not do so without trampling under his feet the usher of the
Court, the suitors, and the audience. How the Secondary gets extricated
from his position is as puzzling to us as the entrance of the apple into the
dumpling is said to have been to George the Third, of simple memory.
On the right of the Secondary sit the members of the bar, of whom one
or sometimes two may chance to be in attendance. It is, perhaps, the
want of accommodation that precludes Sir W. Follett, Messrs. Kelly,
Thesiger, and other silk gownsmen, from attending there. The seat is
brought by necessity so close to the table, that if the advocate sits he
must preserve a slanting position with his head against the wall behind
him, and his feet coming in contact with the jury-box opposite.
If he stands to address the court his position is scarcely less
awkward, for he is obliged to thrust his feet under his seat, and lean his
head towards the jury.
The Secondaries Court is lighted by a square sky-light, and is venti-
lated by a cracked pane, which however is liable to the objection of letting
in the rain, and the Secondary might be warranted in putting up an
umbrella for the better administration of justice, at least if a dry point of
law were under discussion. Opposite the seat for counsel, is the jury-
bºx, but between them is a table and another bench to which the friends
of the judge—or, in the event of his being without friends—the public
are admitted.
On the latter occasions there is sometimes a most undignified collision
between the public and the bar, for the comfort of each depends on having
room enough between the table and the seat, which often causes a severe
struggle, the public sometimes mustering strong enough to thrust the
table with great violence into the stomachs of counsel, who seldom attend
in very large numbers. This indecent contest frequently ends in an
appeal to the bench, or rather to the Windsor chair, for such is the seat
the worthy Secondary occupies. He, of course, as in duty bound, protects
the bar; but these collisions between a noble profession and the people at
large are greatly to be deplored, for we have seen them rankle in the
minds of the public, who have sat quietly quizzing the bar, in a way that
could not be well taken notice of during an entire sitting. Behind the
bench for the public, almost flush with the chimney-piece, a little to the
north of the sky-light, and exactly in the draft of the door and the fire-
place, is the jury-box, built in conformity with Magna Charta, and
rounded on the glorious plan laid down by the discontented barons at
- unnymede. It is licensed to carry ten inside and two out, for when the
jurymen happen to be corpulent there is not room for twelve, and two are
compelled to hold on to the steps that lead up to the jury-box. There is
no particular place assigned to the witnesses, but their general instructions
are to push in as near as they can, for the better administration of justice.
The usher is the officer of the court. He wears a gown, which is generally
in rags from his being compelled to squeeze in and out of the court during
the sitting. Counsel do not plead in their wigs and gowns, but why they
do not, Bracton gives us no hint, and Fleta we have not consulted. Had
we referred to Coke we should have found him obscure, while we have
been too much flabbergastered by Hale on other matters to think of having
anything further to do with him.

SAPPHO MADE EASY.
ACT II.-Scene I.
In the house of Alcander, a room
Remarkable chiefly for neatness and gloom,
The back-ground obscurely reveals to the eye
A temple, a terrace, some water, some sky;
Which we find, when the programme we come to explora,
Is intended for “part of Leucadia's shore.”
The apartment, though otherwise pretty and neat,
Is nearly unfurnish'd, except by one seat
That's placed in the centre—and on it reposes
A lady, in jaconet muslin and roses ;
Around her, in dresses with her’s made to tally,
Are tastefully grouped both the chorus and ballet. -
The latter about her with elegance sidle,
And offer her garlands—to wear at her bridal ;
The former, with courtesy rather extreme,
In her ears a few lines complimentary scream.
She rises, comes forward, 'tis Mrs. A. Shaw—
Who as usual’s received with a deal of éclat.
She curtsies and curtsies again and again,
The lamp in the orchestra's tapp'd, but in vain,
Till back to her place she with modesty glides,
When at last the furore of welcome subsides.
The lady's Climene—about to be wed
To Phaon, who Sappho's affection has fled—
Mrs. Shaw, in a style that they only who've seen her
Can imagine, commences her first cavatina;
It speaks of the sorrow she lately endured
When slighted by Phaon—the wound has been cured :
But Opera heroines always complain,
For sorrow best suits an adagio strain.
The chorus, with accents of comfort come in,
Because the allegro's about to begin ;
And the music assuming a sprightlier measure,
Her heart on a sudden is bursting with pleasure 1
Lysimachus enters—enacted by Stretton,
A singer who seems quite determined to get on.
He says, that a guest he would fain introduce—
Climene, adopting theatrical use,
Objects not an instant—and Sappho comes on,
Who motions she wishes that all will be gone.
No more than a hint does Climene require—
She makes—by a sign—all the bridesmaids retire :
Lysimachus then, without daring to speak,
Off, after the bridesmaids, does quietly sneak.
Climene and Sappho are left on the stage,
In general parley they quickly engage.
Says Climene to Sappho-"I'll make you a sister,
In place of the one that I lost—how I miss'd her ſ”
Says Sappho-" A sister, I fancy you said—
May I ask, if the sister you spoke of, is dead Î"
Says Climene to Sappho-" Just listen, and hark 1
My father to Samos set out in a bark–
My sister was with him—a baby in arms;
A tempest came on—with its awful alarms:
The vessel was dash'd on a rock—none were found,
But papa.”—“Then,” says Sappho, “your sister was drown'd?
That fate is a sad one, but nothing to mine;
I'm Sappho-with hopeless affection I pine.”
Such avowal ne'er came in an opera yet,
Without its involving at once a duet.
So to it the ladies with energy go—
Their voices combine in mellifluous flow ;
Together they'll live they proceed to declare,
Together they'll die—they immediately swear.
Then enter the bridesmaids—Climene they call-
On the necks of each other the vocalists fall ;
And promise to meet at the temple—anon-
Then, with the duet they go lovingly on ;
Declaring how fond of each other they are–

When bºth, with a spirit of rivalry true,
Each other's achievement attempt to outdo.—

DECAYED POSTMEN.
WE perceive that a society has been established for the relief of the
widows and children of decayed postmen. We have heard of decayed
teeth and decayed cheese, but a decayed postman is an article we have
never yet encountered. The individual who brings us our letters is
certainly running to seed, as far as his wardrobe is concerned, but he
gives no symptoms of personal decay, at least at present. A postman in
ruins, must, we should think, have a very picturesque appearance.
Whether Jenkins comes under the denomination of a “decayed postman,”
is, however, a question. His offspring, if he has any, must be certainly
objects of the deepest commiseration. If our mite can be of any use, the
Secretary of the Society may apply for it at the Punch Office.

THE ASTLEY-NAPOLEON MUSEUM.
uMenous public journals have drawn
attention, by advertisements and other-
wise, to the Napoleon Museum at the
Egyptian Hall; but the public may
not be aware that there is in existence
a fine collection of dramatic Bona-
parte relics, being the property of Mr.
Gomersal, the celebrated representa-
tive of the Emperor in all the eques-
trian spectacles.
By the kind permission of the pro-
prietor, we were favoured with a private
view of the interesting collection at his
residence.
The museum occupies nearly the
whole of a chest-of-drawers and three
band-boxes. In the
Top DRAW"Era
is the gray great-coat worn by Mr. Gomersal at the battle of Waterloo.
This relic is greatly enhanced in value by the finger-marks stained
with snuff on a portion of the skirt; all of which are in fine preser-
vation. The public will appreciate the value of the snuff stains,
when it is remembered that it was in taking large quantities of snuff,
and wiping his fingers on his coat, the chief resemblance consisted
between Mr. Gomersal and the Emperor. In the same drawer is a
copy of the call to the first rehearsal of the piece of the “Burning of
Moscow.” There is no date to it, and it is without any signature,
but it forms an important link in the chain when taken in connexion
with other documents.
secon D, THIRD, AND Bottom DRAwens.
In this department of the museum are the celebrated white panta-
loons worn by Mr. Gomersal at Lodi, and afterwards torn in the
struggle at Austerlitz. There is also the property-telescope, through
which he was accustomed to declare that he saw Blucher and the
Prussians galloping over the hills, while he was all the while winking

THE GRATUITous ExHIBITIons of LoNDoN.
PRELIMINARY.
E are perfectly convinced that the
2 English people, with all their monied
importance, think very little of what
they are not allowed to pay for be-
holding. The Gresham Lecturers are
ready to admit this fact : authors who
give orders to their play-going ac-
quaintances are also aware of it :
street tumblers and conjurors have
allowed the truth of it in their philo-
sophy; and the crowds who compose
the stream of gaping ignorance that
flows three times a-week through
the apartments of the British Museum, would think far more of the
precious objects therein treasured, were they compelled to leave a
shilling with their names and umbrellas at the bottom of the staircase.
The marvellous contents of the Egyptian Gallery, displayed in a
temporary pyramid, built in a fashionable neighbourhood, with a
good sum for admission taken at the doors, would be the leading talk
amongst the very people who daily pass through Great Russell Street,
without ever dreaming of inspecting its treasures, because they are
to be seen “for nothing.” The little man, the inmate of the per-
ambulating caravan of Tottenham Court Road, or the New Cut,
creates not half the sensation when boxed up in his doll's house,
ringing his bell, outside the show, which he does when marching
about the privileged interior of his travelling mansion, although the
performance is not half so extraordinary; and the visitors to Wind-
mill Hill, Margate, and other localities of marine migration, pay
willingly to behold a faint image, in the Camera Obscura, of what
they can see much better outside, and for nothing. We knew an
individual some time ago, who was placed on the free list at one of
the most attractive theatres. Although desperately fond of the
drama, he used to yawn through the performances in a fearful state
of ennui, until at length he discovered that the only way to enjoy the
entertainments was to go quietly to the pit, paying the usual price of
admission, when he found that he was as much amused as ever—even
at the same pieces which he had gone to sleep over, when putting
his privilege into use.
One exception only is there to this fact, and that lies in the per-
formance of our own darling PUNch. The minute PUNch was paid
to be witnessed, and anywhere else than in the free thoroughfare
of the King's highway, he would fall from his position. His squeak
would be far less joyous and rollicking—he would not thrash the
parochial authority with half his usual energy—and, above all, he
would miss the comments and cheers of those very important
members of street society, the boys, without a large proportion of
whom no exhibition of Punch can ever go off well, or be received
with becoming approbation.
If we paid but one poor penny to go into a hot mysterious caravan
to see Punch, what a dull common-place fellow he would appear I
his success must mainly depend upon his drama being optionally
gratuitous. But of this, our much-loved puppet, by the way.
And at the same time allow us to state, en passant, that although you
may think nothing of a gratuitous sight freely beheld, yet such is
human contradiction, that if you obtain a glimpse of it in a surrepti-
tious manner, for nothing, its worth is directly trebled. Little boys
know this who peep through the ill-guarded corners of shows at fairs
and races—so do playgoers, smuggled by the liberality of musical
friends into the orchestra amongst the drums. So that this species
of gratuitous exhibition must be excluded from our category of
observanda, which we beg you to remember.
Well aware—in spite of all our talk about “throwing places open
to the public,” which the public would then think nothing of; and
grumbling at various high prices of admission to places which, on
the Continent, are open to every one—well aware that there are
many rare objects of art in the metropolis, as well as countless natural
curiosities, and all to be inspected free of charge, we are about to
make them known. The very circumstance of their being perfectly
gratuitous has tended to throw them in the background as unworthy
of notice ; but we imagine that, once chronicled in our columns, we
shall confer upon them a deathless celebrity. But do not misunder-
stand us in the subjects we are about to take up. The British
Museum is free, so is the National Gallery, and so is Dulwich Col-
lege; but we shall not allude to any of them. The Tunnel dropped,
in one day, from a shilling to a penny, which is next to nothing:
anybody may look at the outside of St. Paul's without paying, and
there is no particular charge for seeing men cut corks or stamp
paper-hangings, or beat gold-leaf, through the shop windows; but
these we shall not mention—more especially the latter, as they
entrench upon the hall of manufactures in the Polytechnic Institu-
tion. But bidding you, expectant reader, open your eyes, and shut
your mouth, we open the subject with
No. 1.

THE WORKS OF ART IN THE NEW ROAD,
These al fresco galleries of objects of rertà are situated on either
side of this great thoroughfare, between Tottenham-court-road and
Cleveland-street, and will well repay the inspection of the traveller
who may be led by business into the neighbourhood. They have no
stated hours for exhibition, but are continuously open, both summer
and winter, from sunrise to sunset, and all through the night. All
ages and classes are allowed to visit them unconditionally, although
reserved seats are sometimes taken on the tops of omnibuses, for
which sixpence is usually charged. They can be seen, however,
equally well from the road ; and it is calculated that the number of

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
spectators in the course of the day considerably exceeds that of the
opposition gallery at Charing Cross.
The union of arts and manufactures in these galleries rivals the
Museum of Portici, the Chinese Collection, or the Polytechnic Insti-
tution. This is best demonstrated in the contiguous exhibitions of
the statues and chimney-pots, which encroach one upon the other,
and offer a striking contrast. In the former, there is a beautiful
group of Eve inspecting a Pestle and Mortar, typical of the syn-
chronous introduction of sin and physic. The visitor may also
observe at the side of the collection the tableaux of the Faun dancing
to the zinc Weathercock, as well as Ajax defying the revolving
chimney-pot, both of them masterpieces of composition. Several
Eagles, perched on the summits of fountains, columns, and outhouses
give an air of picturesque grandeur to the exhibition: as also do the
Wild Boars and Griffins lurking beneath the wash-hand stands, and
in the recesses of the mantel-pieces.
The proprietors of museums, and committees of Country Literary
Institutions, would do well to visit these galleries and inspect the
casual debris of the objects lying about ; for which purpose, in all
probability, permission could be readily obtained of the proprietors,
since, although gratuitously thrown open to the public, they are not
government concerns. Many fragments having the appearance of
petrifactions might be collected, which would puzzle the keenest
geologist, and stock any collection with organic remains of every
description. A few second-hand Ionic columns might be purchased,
and the volutes knocked off would pass well for antediluvian ammo-
nites. Petrified heads of imaginary monsters made of freestone,
would also prove capable of exciting considerable attention, and
argument; whilst the perpetual dust of the New Road, combining
with the rain, forms an alluvial deposit of mud upon most of these
objects, which would heighten the belief in their authenticity.
In conclusion, no visitor should think of quitting London, without
viewing this very attractive exhibition.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
Chi APTER xv.--OF WESTA AND THE WESTALS.
West A was the goddess of fire and old-maidenhood; consequently
she presided over hot and cold. She both patronised and discoun-
tenanced matches; she delighted in, yet detested flames. Her
parentage was the same with that of Minerva and Diana; and the
triad were the three maiden aunts of the “Dii Minorum Gentium.”
These had no relation to “young gents,” as the imperfectly classical
reader may surmise; they were the gods of the lesser nations; the
second fiddles of the skies, to compare Olympus with an orchestra;
or, to liken it unto a cathedral, the celestial minor canons. Vesta,
like Minerva, was a genuine nun ; as to Diana, she, as we have seen,
was none such ; ask Mount Patmos else. The conduct of Vesta was
even more unimpeachably strait-laced than was that of the god-
dess of Wisdom ; for Minerva did have one lover; and how do we
know but that she gave him some encouragement, although she said
“No,” when he popped the question Whereas Vesta was never
molested by the addresses of any one. The very queen of caloric,
she warmed nobody. How is this circumstance to be accounted for
The most philosophical supposition is, that she was remarkably ugly.
We know that cook-maids, who preside over kitchen fires, are apt
very soon to acquire a rubicundity of visage and a platitude of person
by no means calculated to inspire us with tender sentiments. As
Vesta was the sovereign of fire, it is more than probable that she
also ruled the roast, which, if goddesses were wont to get red and
plump, will explain her freedom from annoyance.
The thinking mind, the more it dwells upon the accounts which
have been handed down to us respecting this divinity, the more it is
impressed with the conviction that her chief vocation was the
culinary. We read that Æneas was the first who introduced her
mysteries into Italy. Now, one of the first things that we find
AEneas doing (see the first AEneid) is killing venison, of which his
friend and Man-Friday, the faithful Achates, superintends the roast-
ing and boiling. Virgil, by the bye, does not make any one of the
heroes remark how much better the venison would have been if it
had been a little longer hung ; but heroes and dogs feed much alike
when hungry. When Æneas got to Italy, of which country the
natives were little better than savages, and dined, no doubt, like the
carnivora in a menagerie, he, of course, imported the art of dressing
victuals, which, it is natural to suppose, must, to the untutored mind
of the indigenous yahoos, have appeared a superhuman revelation.
Further, it is well known that Æneas brought a certain something
from Troy, which was called a Palladium, and which was preserved
within the sanctuary of Vesta. The Palladium was a statue, which
was said to have fallen from heaven. In one hand, we are informed,
it held a pike, and in the other a distaff and spindle. No doubt, in
the account of the Palladium, there is truth mingled with error.
The writer hereof will bet any money that the statue was made at
the brass founders; that for “javelin” should be read “spit,” and
for “distaff and spindle,” “poker and tongs.”
It is recorded, moreover, that Numa Pompilius, the successor of
Romulus, built our goddess a temple where no males are permitted
to go. Now, the aversion of the presiding genius of the kitchen to
masculine intrusion, at least during the celebration of her rites, is
too well known to require comment, and too well known, also, by
painful experience, to those whom the profanation of those mysteries
has acquainted with hot dripping. Lastly,–which argument seems
to be what is vulgarly called “a clencher,”—Jupiter, according to
Mr. Keightley, in place of marriage, gave Vesta “to sit in the middle
of the house receiving fat.”
In the temple of Vesta, at Rome, a fire was kept continually burn-
ing by a certain number of maids. These, no doubt, were originally
housemaids and maids of all work; but in process of time their office
assumed a higher character; and they were entitled Vestal Virgins.
Whether they bettered themselves by this change or not, let the
gentle reader, that is, the reader of the gentler sex, determine: she
is to understand that these young ladies, though well lodged and
boarded, and “found” in frocks, etcetera, were not allowed to marry
till thirty years, dated from the time of their initiation, had expired.
Now, as they were initiated at from six to ten years of age, it was
impossible for them to relinquish the altar of Vesta for that of
Hymen, until they had arived at that time of life when all hopes of a
husband must be based upon the Three Per Cents. Then, at initia-
tion, the first thing that was done to them was to shave their heads;
—not an inappropriate operation, if they adopted the line of life from
choice. After this piece of prison discipline, or lunatic asylum regu-
lation process, the young ladies had to spend ten years in learning
their business, ten more in discharging it, and the ten last in instruct-
ing the novices. Their employment consisted in minding Vesta's fire;
—certainly, one would think, the use of the bellows and fire-irons
might have been acquired in a shorter period than ten years; but the
Romans were slow coaches.
If the fire of Vesta ever happened to be extinguished, the accident
was supposed to “bode some strange eruption ” or other calamity to
the state. This philosophical belief, which was nearly as rational as
that which some people still entertain with respect to the consequences
of snuffing a candle out, necessitated great vigilance on the part of
the vestals, lest the misfortune should occur. When a Vestal now-a-
days is guilty of similar negligence, she gets a scolding, or perhaps a
box on the ear; but formerly she got off less easily. She was tied up
and severely flogged by the hands of his Reverence, the High Priest;
and be it observed that a Roman flogging was no joke. Now since,
according to our modern notions, the sight of a young lady writhing
under the lash of an imbecile old savage, would make the blood
slightly boil, and occasion, on the part of the spectators, an inter-
ference with the ceremony, which would be rather unpleasant to the
operator; how, it may be asked, came it, that his Reverence escaped
being torn in pieces by the mob From a salutary and pious fear of
Bogy on their sapient parts. The ancient Romans, we are told, were
fine fellows—very fine ! They were no mawkish sentimentalists.
A religious duty had been neglected; and though the delinquent was,
perchance, a pretty, innocent girl, they subdued their compassionate
weaknesses like men, and allowed her to be whipped to death. Noble
creatures 1 Perhaps, in the supererogation of their self-control, they
laughed at her shrieks for mercy. Then, too, how fervent must have
been that faith which persuaded them undoubtingly to expect an
earthquake or an invasion because a girl had let a fire out ! What
a grand compound was the Roman character l—of the tiger and the
jackass.
However, in some respects the Vestals were tolerably well off.
They wore purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day.
They occupied the dress boxes and grand stands at plays and races;
and whenever they walked abroad, a lictor with the fasces strutted
before them in state ; as “the verger,” at the present time, “troops
before the Dean.” If they met a man by chance, who was going to
be hanged,—a sight by no means uncommon in the streets of Rome,
—they were empowered to pardon him if they thought proper—no
matter how much to the disappointment of the populace. They were
allowed to make affirmations at trials, instead of oaths, as Quakers
are now ; they officiated as arbiters in law-suits, and attorneys at
making wills; whereby sundry six-and-eightpences were beneficially

saved to the public. To offer an insult to them was felony without
benefit of clergy; and it was an insult to make them an offer.
If a Vestal infringed her vow, it will be of course imagined that
she was hanged, drawn and quartered, or decapitated at the very least.
No ; in this case they did not “shed her blood, nor sear that whiter
skin of her’s than snow;” they only buried her alive. Merciful
men :
The order of the Vestals—to the discontent, no doubt, of every
true, truculent, orthodox Roman heathen—was abolished by the
Christian Emperor Theodosius.

the altar, wherever it used to be placed, is situated underneath the
chimney. The

not very dissimilar. A poet, however, might, with more refinement,
have represented her as pouring out her oil from a Florence flask.
The learned authority just quoted also mentions, “that mortals
held no banquets at which they did not, at the beginning and end,
pour out ‘honey-sweet wine" to Hestia, which was the Greek name
of the goddess. That custom has fallen into disuse; but ejaculatory
praises of the performances of the culinary Vesta are still frequently
uttered before and after dinner. They are usually accompanied by
smiles, and smacking of the lips.
By some mythologists Vesta has been confounded with Rhaea,
Ceres, Cybele, Proserpine, Hecate, and Tellus. In the present day,
Mrs. Cook is often confounded, too, with sundry uncomplimentary
epithets, when the mutton is overdone.
There were two individuals worshipped among the ancients under
the name of Vesta. In modern times one only is recognised in well-
regulated families; it being an axiom which philosophy has
established, and which has been sanctioned by experience, that “Too
many cooks spoil the broth.”

TH E MOAT AT THE TOWER.
We never could see the use of the Tower. As to its defending
London, it is all very well on the river side, but surely the enemy
might pop down. Baker-street on the North, or cut along Piccadilly
in the West, while the great guns of the East would be altogether
useless. It is true, that the artillery of the Tower could sweep the
Minories at a moment's notice, and plant a few shells in the very
heart of Rotherhithe. But as the Minories are inhabited by a
peaceful population, and Rotherhithe is not a likely thoroughfare
for an invading army—what the dickins is the use of being able
to blow the inhabitants to atoms in the twinkling of a piece of
ºrdnance We are glad to find, that the humbug of regarding the
Tower as a strong defensive fortress is given up at last, and it has
been resplved to fill up the moat that surrounds it. The fun of
playing at fortifications is rather childish, and the gammon of having
a series of drawbridges, with sentries at each, to guard the access to
the Tower, is at length to be put an end to. The moat was a farce
*ven in its best days, for any one might have got across it with a
little ingenuity by dodging the sentinel. We are very glad to hear
that the filling up has been resolved upon.

NOAH'S ARK.
(waitten with an rye towards the Patronagr or the society-Font-Tºir
DIFFUsion of Useful knowledge.)
The Ark, of whose construction and contents we are about to
treat, is to be procured for the sum of one shilling.
The architecture of this edifice is simple and unpretending,
resembling that of a plain modern church, or a barn. In length it
is just five inches, in breadth two; its shape, therefore, is oblong.
It is four inches in height. It stands upon a piece of wood, flat
above and round below, which projects one inch and three quarters
in front of either end of it, and a little more than a quarter of an
inch on each side. This piece of wood terminates longitudinally in
an equilateral triangle, which is also the figure formed by the roof.
The material of which the structure is composed is Dutch deal,
which has been preferred to oak as being easier to work, much
cheaper, and quite as good for the purpose.
The roof is painted bright red on a chocolate ground, the former
colour being disposed in two parallel strata, with their lower edges
tastefully scolloped. A streak of pale green runs round beneath the
lateral eaves; under that is a smaller streak of yellow with a line of
reddish brown upon it, and separated, by a similar line from the
French pink of the walls and of the upper surface of the floor-piece.
The angles are coped with white, and white bands also run up under
the gable eaves. The windows are black, divided into squares by
white lines, and edged with lake; there are three on either side, and
one at each end, with a black circle, which may also be supposed to
be a window, above it in the gable.
The door is formed by one half of the roof, which lifts up. It
ought to have been in the side; but then it would have been impos-
sible to put in Noah (who is half as tall as the ark itself), without
poking him head foremost.
The total number of animals contained in the ark is sixty-four.
At this, perhaps, the zoologist may cavil, and allege that the Regent's
Park or the Surrey Gardens could make a better show than that ;
but let him reflect that, to the infant mind, untutored in arithmetic,
sixty-four creatures are equal to an indefinite quantity, expressible
as “ever so many.” Some people, also, will eomplain that out of
these sixty-four animals there are not above five or six whose
species it is possible to discern; but such persons are to consider
that this is a mystic toy, and as such, constructed on other and
deeper principles than those of mere imitation. Each of the non-
descripts, being equally like any one out of some hundred different
animals, may be regarded as standing symbolically for the whole
hundred ; and thus, what at first sight appears to be a piece of care-
lessness or ignorance, is seen, on examination, to be the result of
profound design. The creatures with which a child may be pre-
sumed to be acquainted (and where would have been the use of
representing any others (), are for the most part sufficiently distin-
guishable. We have the horse, the dog, the cat, the cow, the sheep,
the pig, the fox, the stag, poultry, geese, and ducks; the collection
also includes an undeniable elephant and a decided ass. Perhaps
the raven and the dove should have been done a little more accu-
rately; for candour compels us to say that the former, per se, might

| possibly be mistaken for a blackbird, and the latter as easily con-
founded with the tom-tit. However, perhaps the dove and the
raven are supposed to be out of the ark.
The distinction between the genders of the eight human denizens
of the Ark is very well marked; an hour-glass contraction of the
waist plainly denoting the females, who, moreover, have no buttons
in front of the breast, which the men have ; and whose gowns differ
from those of their husbands in being striped in front, in accordance
with the decorated style characteristic of the dress of the fair sex.
It is worthy of remark, that Noah is about twice as tall as the

elephant. This superiority in point of stature is not intended to
make Noah out to have been a giant, which every child knows very
well he was not, but to typify his moral elevation over the quadruped ;
as man is a rational being, and therefore as high again as the half-
reasoning elephant.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAP, xvi.-MADAME SPANNEU's CUSTOMERS.—THEIR HUMILITY..—
poMESTIC PEACE AND PICKLES.
Dunira my sojourn with Madame Spanneu, I had frequent oppor-
tunities of considering the various characters of her customers, who
—I confess I was at first astonished at the discovery—were many
of them most genteel and easy-going people; and, indeed, in their
own esteem, co-parcel of the very best society. Still, whatever wan
their bigoted opinion of their own worldly consequence, their visits
to Madame Spanneu gave pleasant proof of their humility of spirit,
inasmuch as they all came to habit themselves in the left-off garments
of their betters. And this humility was the more christianlike, in-
asmuch as I verily believe that many of the purchasers would have
gone to the stake in cast brocade, rather than have confessed to the
meekness which induced them to buy it. They were, it is true,
lowly of heart, but would not for the world have had the virtue made
ublic.
p How often have I seen the gown of a peeress carried off by the
wife of a tallow-chandler How often has the cloak of an earl's
daughter been doomed to the shoulders of the spinster of two rooms
Nay, the Countess's gowns—the rustling perquisites of Mrs. Pillow—
I saw no less than three of them sold to buyers, whose brassy looks
and bold voices made me tremble for the future destiny of the
garments. And can I ever forget the cold chill that struck through
me when I once felt myself taken up by such a customer, who blew
through me and shook me, and—my heart of pith sank at the words
—inquired, “How much " Madame Spanneu, with a just estimate
of my virtues, asked a good round sum, and thanking my stars for
my escape, I felt myself dropped from the hand. “Feathers, Jemima,
darling, isn't the thing; no, my rose-bud, they isn't indeed.” Thus
spoke an old gentlewoman — dear Mrs. Gaptooth, as Madame
Spanneu called her—to the girl, who desired to make me her
own; but the reproof of the matron, though uttered in the calmest,
most maternal voice, appeared by the very force of its sweet-
ness—or certainly by some force — to convince Jemima. She
sighed, pouted a second, then seemed resigned. “Gals of your
tallness, Jemima, don't carry off feathers well ; they makes you
gawky; and in this wicked world, looks is everything.” I was quite
charmed with the appearance—the manner of Mrs. Gaptooth. I
thought I had never seen so venerable a woman; and even while
she spoke of the necessary shows of life, she did so in so passionless
a tone—seemed to have so just a value of all the fleshly vanities of
the earth, that she appeared to me a kind of lay saint; a creature,
doomed by the imperfection of human nature to eat, drink, and sleep,
but at the same time never forgetting the real value of mere mortal
beauty, when most beautiful. “Ha! Madame Spanneu,” the dear old
soul would cry, “beauty, as I often says to my gals, is a flower—a
tulip—Madame Spanneu, a painted tulip; now, a flourishing in a bed,
and now on a dunghill.” “True, my dear; very true—beauty”—
Madame Spanneu would reply—“doesn't last as it ought, not even
with the best of us.” “Ha! my dear Madame Spanneu, the beauty
I’ve seen come on and go off—beauty it's like a guinea, Madame
Spanneu ; when it’s once changed at all, it's gone in a twinkling.
That satin, by candle-light, Jemima, will be worth any money.” And
thus Mrs. Gaptooth—who was a frequent visitor at Madame Spanneu's
—would discourse before her daughters, as I concluded they were,
from the maternal tenderness which she would shed upon her mingled
talk of the outward loveliness of humanity, and the glories, sold at
second-hand, by Madame Spanneu. For Mrs. Gaptooth herself, I
must repeat I had the very deepest respect. Charming, easy, loveable
old woman; her eye had such a soft, half-slumbering look; her
voice came like the gentle breathing of a flute; she always walked
as if she trod a church-floor, and seemed fed on nothing coarser than
marmalade and honey. As for her numerous family of daughters, I
must confess I have often wished they had been a little more
like their mother, they must, I am sure, have been at times most
troublesome to the good old lady; they appeared so forward, loud,
self-willed, and frolicsome. But be it understood once and for all
time, that I write from the impressions of characters and scenes as
they first rose upon me.
Mrs. Gaptooth on one of her visits came alone. Madame Spanneu,
who was always with us, received the dear old creature in her show-
room. One of Madame's young women—for there were two or three
assistant semptresses in the house—was present; and the conversa-
tion was carried on between Madame and her visitor in so low a
voice that I could only catch here and there a few words. I was
convinced, however, that Mrs. Gaptooth spoke of Lord Huntingtopper
with the air and manner of an acquaintance. “There's no account.
ing for taste Madame Spanneu,” said Mrs. Gaptooth in a somewhat
piteous voice, “but where she's got to, I'm a sinner if I know.” “And
you've come to tell his lordship as much, my dear !” “Certainly
not, Madame Spanneu, Lord Huntingtopper's coming here to-day to
see your husband—Mr. Curlwell told me as much—so I'm come just
to throw myself promiscuously into his way, that I may know a little
more about the business. One can't be too safe.”
Thus much I could piece out from the low-voiced colloquy of the
ladies. Madame Spanneu was, however, fidgetty under the restraint
of a third person, and so told the young woman to go down stairs,
and see that those nasty dogs did no mischief. The girl being gone
upon her delicate mission, Madame Spanneu talked freely. “Well,
I did hear that Lord Huntingtopper was going to marry Lady Dinah
Willowby.”
“What of that, my dear? Why shouldn't he But after all,”
said Mrs. Gaptooth in her mild, matronlike way, “who knows if the
fellow's serious !”
“No doubt of it,” responded Madame Spanneu ; “he must be in
earnest, for he's bought her ladyship a poodle; Julien's teaching it all
sorts of things. Ha! Mrs. Gaptooth, men are nice creatures, they
are,” cried Madame Spanneu with bitterness. Charming, however,
most charming was the charity of Mrs. Gaptooth, for she gently
clasped her hands, twisted her thumbs, and a smile gilding her broad
quiet face, she cried—“Poor fellows 1 silly things I’” And then she
chuckled, gently chuckled.
“Don’t talk in that way, my love,” said Madame Spanneu, “it
makes my flesh crawl to hear you pity'em, it isn't stauding up for
your sex. Ha 1 you don't know what I've to suffer.”
“Anything new "asked Mrs. Gaptooth, with that peculiar serenity
which characterises the interest of some people in the misfortunes of
their neighbours.
“Newſ” exclaimed the wife, and she closed her eyes, gave a
spasmodic shake of the head, and seemed to swallow a rising emo-
tion. Then there was silence for a moment, and then Madame
Spanneu, with an alacrity that appeared to do her heart good, cried,
—“But, my dear, I’ll tell you all about the villain.”
I had not yet seen Monsieur Julien Spanneu, for his wife rigidly
enforced his seclusion to his own room, and, as she would say, to his
fittest company, his filthy dogs—his pupil poodles. I had, however,
heard more than enough of him ; and had formed in my own mind
his outward man from the notes which proceeded from his fiddle as
well as from himself: for really, they were so eternally blended, that
man and fiddle seemed but one instrument. I have heard men
declare that they have only to hear a voice to immediately fit it with
an anatomy; albeit the fleshly instrument from which the voice is
heard shali, in its reality, be in every point a contradiction to the
body which has been, by the fancy of the listener bestowed upon it.
I suppose this habit of men, not only when hearing persons but also
when hearing of them,-this custom of endowing them with flesh and
blood of some sort, arises from the difficulty that poor human nature
has to consider mind in the abstract—to think of the human soul,
without head and shoulders, legs and arms. Be this as it may ; I
had—from a too frequent overhearing of Monsieur Spanneu-made
him a present of a long, thin, lizard-like body, a faee sharp as a
bladebone, twinkling eyes, grinning jaws, and a back bending like a
willow in a breeze. His voice came with a cutting scream, far above
his catgut. Hour by hour I heard him raving, stamping, singing,
fiddling, at his canine pupils, withal so passionately, so earnestly,
with such apparent consciousness of the importance of his function,
of the great social value of his teaching a dog to go on three legs at
the word of command—to limp as if wounded—to tumble head over
heels—to feign the last mortal agony—and, above all, to toss a six
pence from its nose, at any given number, that whatever might
have been my opinion of the value of Monsieur's labours, I could
not but respect the amount of sincerity, of real heart, he put into
them. Then, how he would vociferate How he would scream—
“Chien que tu es”—as if in his indignation he told the dunce of a dog
a startling truth, and then as the gender might be, crying, “ Chienne
que tu es,” as the worst opprobrium he could wreak upon a female
learner. With these things fresh in my mind—for Monsieur Julien
kept them day by day smarting like a new sore—I listened with all
my ears to the coming narrative of Madame Spanneu, perceiving
that—like a good wife as she was—she never felt so truly happy as
when she could convince a dear female friend, who would keep the
imparted secret locked for ever in her breast, what a villain she was
married to.
When Madame Spanneu, as I have observed, promised Mrs. Gap-

tooth such happiness, the matron, decorously preparing herself for
the pleasure, merely said, “Do.”
“Well, my dear,” begins the injured wife, “you recollect that
creature, Louisa f" - -
“A very fine gal,” answered Mrs. Gaptooth with some vivacity.
“Beautiful flaxen hair, and eyes as blue as blue chaney. Where is
she, my dear!” - - -
This question Madame Spanneu did not answer, but waving it with
a real or affected shiver, kept to the story of her wrongs. “And
you know, my dear, that I'm a little particular in my pickles #"
In the name of the mummy of King Cheops—certainly one of the
best preserves of the earth—what can there be in common with
domestic wrongs and domestic pickles . This question stirred me,
but not Mrs. Gaptooth. She evidently felt there was nothing
inharmonious in the matter; for had she been a statue made to
speak, she could not with more tranquillity have answered, “My
dear, I do.”
“I’m not a proud woman, Mrs. Gaptooth; no ; my worst enemy,
my dear, if I have such a thing, can t say that ; but I'll turn my back
upon no woman for pickles. No ; if I can stand upon anything in
the world, it is my onions.”
“Very true, my dear,” was the corroboration of Mrs. Gaptooth.
“But the gal?”
“Well, my dear, I was called to Leatherhead for a week, to seemy
aunt in the jaundice. She got over that, but she can't live long, my
dear, and whenever she goes, there's something for us. Well, there
was I, out a week from home, I may say, upon business; leaving that
Louisa to keep the house. When I came back, there wasn't a walnut
-a bit of cabbage—not a single onion, my dear, if you'd have died
for it !”
“And all with Louisa t” asked Mrs. Gaptooth.
“My love,” cried Madame Spanneu, most affectionate in her
wretchedness, “My love, I afterwards found out she'd been alto-
gether mistress of the house; and so the wretch had not only
destroyed my peace, but ate my pickles I"
Gents' jasbioms for ſºap.
As dress is at all times the first consideration' with the Gents, by which
they think they maintain a position apart from the common people, who
merely trust to their own abilities, unaided by tailor or haberdasher, to
make themselves agreeable, we publish the following information for the
Gents' own advantage.
The celebrated Twelve-shilling coat of pepper-and-salt blanketing is
now very fashionable, and forms an elegant summer costume, it is
usually worn with Berlin gloves and cheroots, which latter favourite
articles may be purchased at a very cheap rate at various shops where a
lithograph of Mr. Pickwick is inviting the Gents to buy.
Some very pretty stocks have lately appeared in the windows as the
“Gents' New Fashion.” They are of light-blue satin, ornamented with
$prigs, and appear to be usually selected by fair Gents with auburn whis.
kers,upon whom they are exceedingly becoming.
White cravats which take to pieces and wash, may be purchased for
two shillings each, and are remarkably stylish. To be very aristocratic,
they should be worn with worked ends, the patterns taken from the
stamped paper on the top of French plum-boxes.
We have observed lately, that when we have gone into a shop to buy
white kid gloves, we have been invariably asked “if we should not like
straw-colour?” This arises from the Gents usually patronising them at
eighteen-pence a pair, which look equally stylish with three-and-sixpenny
oniº, and saying they get them at “Hoobegong's.”
The most fashionable Gents have appeared at evening parties with their
shirt-fronts ornamented with lace-work like a lady's pocket-handkerchief,
and a piece of something pink behind it : it looks very pretty. We have
also seen them in ribbed and striped stockings or pumps, and beautiful
fancy waistcoats of washahle satin, with an under vest of some lively colour.
The tout ensemble is very striking.
Some novel articles in Gents' jewellery have made their appearance in
electro gold. Some of the ornaments resemble large white currants with
gilt eels twisting round them, and others are like blanket-pins with water
on the brain. . We have also seen some sporting Gents with mosaic heads
of horses and foxes stuck in their cravats. §. majority of Gents at
Present wear their hands large and red, with flattened ends to the fingers.
Thick sticksare in vogue at present, especially with small Gents, which are
usually carried held by the middle, with the handle downwards anáforwards.
Short canes are also exceedingly Gentish—about the length of a
tobacco-pipe. They are carried with the top plunged into the side-pocket
of the coat, and are considered by the Gents “rather the cheese.”
The weather has been almost too unsettled for the introduction of the
Blouse, but a few have appeared at the shop-doors. They may be looked
for generally, in a week or two.

act the third.
Act Three—Scene One—is a feast by night—
Illum'd by a most mysterious light.
A stage direction meant to denote
That the prompter lowers the gas in the float.
On the right is the Temple's penetralia,
But so badly done it amounts to a failure.
It seems that Sappho has come with the view
Of ascertaining what she's to do.
From certain Aruspices, being incog.,
In a forest surrounded with marsh and bog.
To sacrilege she hath come to own,
And for it expresses a wish to atone,
Because in the scene that has gone before
She has pitch'd an altar on to the floor;
And striking an attitude terribly fine,
Upset an arrangement of spirits and wine.
Lysimachus—after a horrible shout,
In manner theatrical, somehow makes out
That Sappho 's the child of Alcauder, and ergo,
Is unto Climene a sister, poor virgo;
But the Priests have already determined her doom,
Which over the matter has cast quite a gloom.
But the doom is pronounced upon Sappho, and so
Away they all screaming and bellowing go.
Scene Two—is described as a part of the cliff;
The sea is below—but the waves are too stiff,
For the boys who enact them get playing their tricks,
By poking the canvas about with their sticks;
And nothing in caricaturing surpasses
The scene of this troAvºpMotorSoud Baxagons.
Then Sappho approaches, and, after some singing,
Prepares from the rock her poor self to be flinging.
The platform Miss Clara Novello ascends,
Each neck in the house most eagerly bends
Expecting to witness of Sappho the tumble,
The drums in the orchestra fearfully rumble—
The audience shriek—for a figure in white
Is seen to fall down from the terrible height.
The women then scream with alarm, but what folly!
The figure is nothing on earth but a dolly
Then down goes the curtain—and though it is thought
That Sappho is crush'd by her fall into nought,
She's loudly demanded, and when she comes out,
Is welcomed, of course, with a vehement shout;
And on her keep falling the usual showers
Of threepenny bunches of yesterday's flowers.
REMINISCENCES OF MR. CLAREMONT,
or THE T. R. covent-GARDEN, BY His GREAt-GE ANDson.
The only professional anecdote I am able to relate with regard to my
illustrious ancestor is this :—At the time when the affairs of Covent-
Garden Theatre were in a very bad way, Theodore Hook happened to
come into the Green Room, and addressing my great-grandfather, said
he wondered to see him there when there was a talk of an execution
being put into the theatre. My great-grandfather, who was a very simple
man when not engaged in his profession, asked the wit why he (Claremont)
should not be in the theatre at such a time. “Because,” said Hook, “if
an execution is put into the house they will certainly seize all the sticks.”
-Everybody else laughed heartily, but my great-grandfather maintained
to the last hour of his existence that he could not see the joke.
I have nothing more to add respecting my ancestor that would be
interesting to the public ; but on searching the bills of Covent-Garden
Theatre for the year 1808, I find that he played on the opening night,
which was Sept. 12th, the part of Malcolm, and that the cast included
Messrs. Thompson and Wilde, whose names both appear in the bills as
Officers, while the Gentlemen were sustained by Messrs. Brown, Grant,
Louis, Powers, Reeves, and Sargant. Well may we sigh over the good
old days of the drama 1 We shall never look upon their like again.
The Easter Holidays.
ON Easter-Monday Mr. Jenkins walked across the room in which he
lodges, going beyond the alcove or nook in which his turn-up bedstead is
deposited. This is the only way in which he passed the recess. (Oh!)
Mr. Brown left town on Easter-Monday for Greenwich, where he
partook of the gungerbread-nuts, and returned to town in the evening.
Mr. Horatio Tomkins was among the audience at Astley's on Monday
evening. He seemed

tly to enjoy Mr. Widdicomb's personation of
THE AERIAL STEAM SHIP MANIA.
Rmront of the Committee appointed by PUNch to investigate the comparative merits of
the flying machine, alluded to in recent numbers of his journal.
At the conclusion of their labours, your Committee have much pleasure
in laying the following results of their investigations before you, being now
thoroughly convinced of the flighty nature of the subject, and its close
approach to a castle in the air, which has hitherto been considered as a
mere imaginary building.
The Arabian Nights' Entertainments, the Chronicles of Walentine and
Orson, Peter Wilkins, Mother Bunch, and other accredited and authenti-
cated histories, prove that the process of flying through the air was once
perfectly feasible, but that the art is now lost in common with various
colours, methods of embalming, and transmutation of metals. It is, there-
fore, not too much to affirm that this ingenious construction is on the eve
of being found out, especially by its shareholders, and will be brought to
as great a degree of perfection as it ever has been.
The analogy between the bird and the Aerial Courier is very properly
made of the first consequence, for nature has ever furnished the best
models that art could go from ; but still your committee have failed, with
all their energy, in discovering any British birds with steam-engines in
their stomachs or whirligigs behind their ears; and as the patentee appears
to think an inherent principle of life quite unnecessary for sustaining a
body in the air, they recommend him to try and make a dead bird fly by
clockwork before he proceeds much further.
*_* -
| º Ta Ki Nc in
Q jº. ſº "station L
Your Committee feel bound to state that, in furtherance of their experi-
ments upon the principle, they purchased a clock-work mouse at the toy-
shop in Holborn, and having wound him up and fastened some sails to his
back, they allowed him to run down an inclined plane, which he did with
great velocity; and in all probability would have risen into the air, but
for some unseen, and therefore trifling, impediment. But as this occur-
rence might take place equally with the Aerial, inasmuch as it is started
by the same means; and, supposing that Highgate Hill be chosen for this
purpose, as it would be awkward for the voyagers when they expected to
be at Calcutta to find themselves only at Kentish Town, at the bottom of
the declivity, your Committee recommend that further measures should be
taken to guard against such disappointment.
It is recommended then, that the patentees forthwith obtain the assist-
ance of Mr. W. Bradwell, the theatrical mechanist.—he being the only
man who has ever set the laws of matter and gravitation completely at
defiance,—to superintend their construction. The very name of those
parts of the house in which he reigns transcendant—the flies—prove his
volatile powers; and the public have only to call to mind the numerous
flying chariots and other aerial machines which he has from time to time
constructed, perfectly under the control of their directors, to allow his
great powers in this peculiar line. The mere fact of his being enabled to
let ropes down from the clouds, or attach them to the sky, whenever he
chooses, would make him a valuable guard to the machine, to sustain it in
the atmosphere in the event of its machinery becoming disordered, which
would at all times be a particularly unpleasant accident, and difficult to be
repaired. For, according to the representation, all the crew and passenger?
appear to be shut up with the coals and steam-engine in a species of slipper-
bath upon wheels with two windows.
It is also earnestly urged that Mr. Murphy be appointed conductor, from
the good terms on which he stands with the weather ; that the various
winds required for its progress be under the control of Mr. J. H. Tully,
from his aptness in arranging all kinds of airs to suit any especial purpose ;
even those very difficult ones which Miss Clara Novello gives herself; and
that Mr. Bunn be chief manager, from his wonderful powers in keeping
any concern afloat by unknown agency.
These things being attended to, your Committee have no doubt that the
Courier will ultimately go up, but whether the atmosphere or the spout, time
alone can determine. At the same time, they express their surprise that
what appears to be themost formidable difficulty in the whole undertaking—
viz., getting passengers for the first trip—has never once been alluded to.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
JENKINS AGAIN, AND BETTER THAN EVER!
Did we dwell in a habitation with closed shutters, we should know that
spring was returned to us. JENKINs, like the euckoo, crieth out of green
leaves. We have but to read that column of The Morning Post, which
JENKINs—unsurpassable JENKINs—makes his own, to know, as he himself
would delicately say, that le printemps est revenu ! Yes, JENKins' sap
rises with the season; he has burst out with the hawthorns—blossomed
with the crab-apples. But first, hear the melancholy philosophy of
JENKINs. He is at her Majesty's Theatre, and—
“Cannot but be reminded of the mournful temporary cause of this falling off, [i.e. a
thin house,] particularly when we cast a glance at the three spacious boxes which we so
often behold graced by the presence of august and illustrious personages, on whom all
true Englishmen look with pride, and whose presence alone would make the Italian
Opera the most attractive, as well as the highest sphere of public recreation.”
This is a comfortable assurance ; because if LABLAche, as JENKINs
would say, should have unabbassemento di voce, why, in default of hear-
ing il primo basso, it would be quite sufficient to “look with pride” at the
Duke of CAMBRIDGE in one of the “three spacious boxes.” If a cat may
look at a king, why, upon a graduated scale of right, we think JENKINs
may stare at a Duke. That point, however, we leave for the adjustment
of the cat and JENKINs themselves. JENKINs says of CAMBRIDGE—
“His Royal Highness, by the frank and open expression of his excellent judgment
and musical enthusiasm, directs and forms listless fashionables in that just appreciation
of talent so necessary to the advancement of art. Were we moralists-
—(Pooh, pooh, JENkins—hang modesty, and pull up your shirt-collar:
you are a moralist)—
instead of humble critics, we might descant also upon the lesson he reads to many of
his countrymen, whose besetting sin is a stilted pride, which prevents their giving free
erpression to their opinions, and who appear to think they would degrade themselves
were they to faternize [sic in Post] in courtesy and in feeling with their companions in
the recreation of the passing hour.”
We agree with JENkins in part of this. There is, certainly, no man so
prone to give “a free expression” to his opinion than CAMBRIDGE, for we
heard him a night or two since at the French play, from his private box,
out-talking poor Madame Doche on the stage, the actress standing no
chance with the visitor. Besides, when the Duke comes to an English
house, it is well known, that he always thus announces himself to the
audience. “Hem—hem—hem—hem : Whenever I come to the play, I
make it a rule of dining at five o'clock ' " This piece of self-sacrifice,
His Royal Highness always gives the most “frank and open expression
to.”
We regret, however, to perceive that Jenkins, whose delicate sense
denounced “the frowsy dames” of shopkeepers visiting the Opera pit,
should now talk of “stilted pride.” Poor JENKINs) We see how it is ; his
tailor has served him with the copy of a writ, and he hopes to mollify
him into a small and lingering cognovit.
Heaven forbid that JENRINs should be shut up ! ... Ye gods, what powers
of observation would the Marshal then have under lock and key; for
mark the following—
“As to her [Fanny Ellsler's] Cachucha, in that dance, as the Italians say, ha fatto
fanatismo, and we shrewdly suspect that mary of the fanatics are practising in secret;
for we observed no fewer than twelve pair of custanettes hanging in one turner’s shop
ºn Qxford-street, a few days since, and we doubt whether so many have been employed
until now by all the inhabitants of Britain, sincr THE DAYs or rhE DRuins.”
The Druids, as our readers will at once acknowledge, having always
been celebrated for mistletoe, metheglin, and—castanettes 1
And now, Jenkinslets us into an extraordinary piece of private history—
“We doubt whether we ever heard anything equal to Persiani's Amina last night, un-
less it were Malibran's, who sang the part in a totally different tone of voice, as well as
style of acting. , But then, poor Malibran, so full of genius, fire, energy, and feeling, was
a Somnambula herself! Even in broad day we have seen her thus, when her feelings
have been deeply wounded [JENK1Ns would bore for an order] her orbits immoveably
contemplating the chimera conjured up in her mind; without 'speculation in her eyes.”
—and, unlike the Somnanbula of the stage, instead of walking unscathed over the preci-
pice, sometimes unconsciously precipitating herself over a stone staircase, at whose foot
we have seen her picked up—her beautiful pallid features streaming with blood.”
Imagine JENKINs, like the Doctor in Macbeth, when watching Macbeth's
wife—think of him, the marble-hearted villain, watching MALIBRAN pre-
cipitating herself over a stone staircase, merely, that like a second in a
fight, he might see the woman fairly “picked up.” We knew that MAll-
BRAN was eccentric ; but we never thought she could be so jocose with
stone staircases 1 JENKINs, you never saw this: never; but like a kindred
nius, ByRoN, you would fain affect a recklessness you have not, JENkins!

things you may have seen ; but never a prima donna picked up at the
bottom of a staircase.
touched in the head.
Now, however, JENKINs shows the effect of the spring : now he vindicates
the rising of the sap:—
“Persiani's last feat, “Ah! non giunge,” left our musical reminiscences, of the
moment, enveloped in a maze of the most bewitching fioriture in which joy was ever
expressed. This feeling was general; and we could not help taughing when we afterwards
stretched our limbs in the fresh air, followed by many other operatic votaries; bent on a
similar errand, [what errand?] hearing them all singing “Ah non giunge,” although
in such different keys, and with such discrepant tones and execution.”
Here JENkins becomes solemn on the bolera :-
“We wish we could gladden our sight with the charming Guy Stephan's boleras at
any other time than between the acts of the opera. We consider its scena as sacred
§. where none but singing angels ...i intrude; whilst the dancing Houris
estroy the ensemble of the lyrical feeling.”
We really think this matter should be represented by JENKINs to some
of the bishops. We would have JENkins left entirely to the “angels,”
and not “destroyed” there night after night by the “Houris.” Help '-

It is whispered that the promising young junior, Mr. Smoothover, has
applied for the coif. If he should obtain it, he will offer a cognovit for
the thousand pounds expense which the dignity entails, and he will give
rings with the Latin motto of “Curreatus Ambulator,” or, Hookey
Walker.
We have heard it stated as a fact, which may or may not be relied
upon, that Mr. Briefless has at length persuaded himself to print his
speeches at the bar in a cheap form, for general circulation His flights
of eloquence have generally been devoted to applications for rules to com.
pute; but there have been one or two of his speeches on the more excit-
ing subject of outlawry. He purposes giving to the publication the
striking title of A Voice from the Bail Court. The speeches will be
corrected by himself, and will comprise four leaves of small octavo. He
intends dedicating them to the Usher, whose promptness in handing in the
*ffidavits has been very serviceable to Mr. Briefless during the whole of
his professional existence.
We have heard that Mr. Flounder is preparing a new edition of Abbott
on Shipping. It will bring down the law to the end of last summer, includ.
ing the decision of Mr. Minshall on the case of the Anthracite against the

picking up of a broken oar and a fractured skull by the Battersea water-
men, will be very elaborately entered into.

WIDDICOMB As LORD ELLENBOROUGH.
In the new piece at Astley's, the part of Lord Ellenborough has been
assigned to Widdicomb. Nothing can exceed the effect of his entrance
on the back of an elephant, from which he reads the whole of the pro-
clamations as originally issued by the Governor-General. Widdicomb
seems to have entered into the character of Lord Ellenborough with a
remarkable accuracy of conception. His calling on the troops to be firm
wº.de it is as much as he can do to retain his own seat on the elephant's
back, is a magnificent touch of nature, which told immensely with the
audience. His justification of his policy to the low comedian of the piece,
and his bit of quiet nature when he walks down to the lamps and raps his
heel with a riding whip were not lost on the house; while his undertoned
growl at the equestrians in the final procession, was a bit of smothered
feeling that will place him in the first rank of riding-masters. We
understand that Widdicomb was so desirous to preserve an air of reality,
and to give as much as possible an Indian air to his performance of the
part, that he rubbed his moustachios with Indian ink, and studied the
whole of the dialogue under the immediate direction of one of the Agents
of the East India Tea Company.
Works of Art.
We are happy to announce the great improvement that has lately been
made in the column at King's Cross. Within the last week the statue of
George the Fourth has been taken down.
Notices of Motion.
MR. Joseph HUMR, to move for an address of condolence to the country
on the birth of a Princess.
LITERARY AND LEARNED.
At the late meeting of the Royal Society, a paper was read “on the
reduction of metals by a solution of salts, within the voltaic circuit.” It
was calculated that six ounces of Epsom salts would reduce one shilling
exactly one half; and the experiment was tried by sending for nine ounces,
when the shilling was reduced to threepence:—Thus proving the uniform
operation of the laws of chemists.
A member, speaking of the action of salt on silver begged to observe,
“that when exposed to the air, silver, while in contact with salt, is some-
times completely absorbed by some invisible influence. A servant had
left some plate on the kitchen dresser, (Hear) and happening to turn her
back, while the area door was open, it was found on her return that the
whole of the silver had either become fused in the atmospheric humidity,
or had been subjected to some species of voltaic action, (Hear). At all
events, it was no longer visible.
A member suggested, that it might have been the action of the salts.
The member who introduced the subject, said it might have been, par-
ticularly as the salt-cellars, which were also of silver, had disappeared
likewise.
Professor Toddledown, on being called upon to read a paper, took out
the Times, in which he seemed to be engrossed during the remainder
of the sitting. Mr. Twinkle—a new member—produced a copy of an
inscription on a stone in the Kensington-road. It ran thus, “1}.” After
some deliberation it was decided that the hieroglyphic represented the
distance from Hyde Park-corner, and was intended to designate one mile
and-a-half from the place alluded to.
The following donations were then announced.
Mr. Twinkle. Several Elgin marbles, being a selection from those
which Lord Elgin, when a boy, played at marbles with.
Professor Toddledown. A wheelbarrow-full of the earth dug from
under the Thames in forming the Tunnel. (This announcement was
received with much cheering.)
Mr. Chaffington. A piece of wood, cut into the form of one of the
blocks used for the wood-pavement in Oxford-street.
Thanks having been voted to everybody in general, and nobody in
particular, the meeting broke up.
BALLADS OF BLIGHTED HOPES.
I MET her where the merry bird
At morning, noon, and night is heard;
It was at Greenwich Park.
She'd come to hear soft music gush
From swallow, sparrow, tomtit, thrush,
I—to enjoy the lark.
I follow'd closely on her heel,
To where in country-dance and reel,
They rush'd their cares to soothe.
We stood together, hand-in-hand,
And soon were waltzing to the band
Of Algar's well-known Booth.
I swore to laugh at fortune's frowns,
Defying all the

Which Time is sure to bring.
Together we declar'd we'd go,
Whether our lot be high or low-
And got into a swing.
Now we are mounting to the sky,
Now down again to earth we fly,
Now balanc'd in the air;
And, interrupted by the noise
Of cheering from surrounding boys,
Fidelity I swear.
We walk’d from show to show about,
I drinking freely Barclay's Stout;
Ah would I could refrain.
In station-house I woke next morn;
She had been somehow from me torn:
We never met again ll

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“TBerogatorp" to Qibe Trama
THERE is something very amusing to philosophers, like Punch and
his friends, to note the “periodical fits of morality,” as MacAuley
names them, that attack certain bodies. The Committee of the
Theatre Royal Drury Lane have suddenly found themselves ill-used
and insulted. This discovery, however, the Committee must mainly
attribute to the natural delicacy, the aristocratic fastidiousness of
the Earl of GLENGALL, for on his “return to town,” they—“imme-
diately expressed their disapprobation of the theatre being used for
any meetings whatever involving discussion upon political subjects,
the same being in their judgment altogether foreign to the purposes, as
ºvell as derogatory to the character, of a patent theatre.”
&#x &
N- r:
We believe there is a person upon town, who for some years
ruled the destinies of Drury-lane theatre, paying of course a very
heavy rent for the same (the receipts are no doubt in the British
Museum for the inspection of the curious), and who in the time of
his government, filled the stage with French and German singers.
Surely they were foreign to the purposes of an English theatre.
He, moreover, engaged Arab steeds to caracole and dance upon
the boards. Were not they foreign And more than all, he turned
the house into a menagerie, filling the
dramatic temple with the roaring of
lions and the growling of bears. Again
we put the same question—were not they
foreign
But no ; the Committee have disco-
vered that corn laws are more foreign
than cages—that panthers and leopards
may become national, but not the members of the League. Mel-
pomene and Thalia are not to be alarmed by the roaring of tigers,
but are excessively scandalized at the plain speaking of Messrs.
CompeN, Fox, and Williens. However, we would fain judge
charitably. The Committee may act upon the best of motives;
they may fear the infection of politics spreading among the players:
these fears at Drury-lane are we think foolish and unfounded.
PUNCH*S HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY.
CHAPTER XVI.-DISPOSING OF VULCAN.
Vulcan, according to Milton, was a pretty sort of a god : “Men
called him Mulciber,” says the Bard, but adds,-though in other
words, that he was no such thing, being, in point of fact, an ex-angel
and actual demon. . According to the ancient mythologists, he º
not a pretty sort of god by any means, but a remarkably ugly one;
a brawny, grisly, lame, deformed monster. He was represented in a
state of semi-nudity, bristly and hirsute, with particularly shaggy
hair, and a beard and whiskers which cried aloud for trimming. He
was not at all “os humerosque deo similis,” but rather more like an
-T
ogre as to his head and shoulders than a god. Muscular he was, as
the cripple in Raphael's celebrated Cartoon, and sturdy and strong
as a rhinoceros. His “shoulder was ordained so thick to heave,” like
that of Richard the Third ; but unlike that exemplary sovereign,
(who was a bit of a dandy in his way,) he would neither “entertain
a score or two of tailors,” nor “study fashions to adorn his body;”
hence his scant attire. Nay, he would not take the common pains
to keep himself clean, (although, as a god, he was in easy circum-
stances in respect of soap,) and his hands and face were always
begrimed with soot. Thus, albeit one of the celestial aristocracy—
one of the “Dii majorum gentium,” he was numbered with the Great
Unwashed. And this the rather for that he generally appeared
holding in his hand a hammer and pincers : implements significant
of his craft, which was that of a blacksmith. However, he also
presided over all workers in gold, silver, iron, and their kindred
substances; and all arts and mysteries thereunto appertaining, from
metallurgy to tinkerism. He was likewise the deity of fire, in his
way, as Vesta was in hers; but whereas her department was the
roasting of joints, it was his to roast ores. She roasted the ox, he
the oxide.
Some say that Vulcan was the son of Jupiter and Juno, others
that he was the son of Juno per se, who excogitated him in her head,
as her husband did Minerva. On this supposition, Juno must have
dreamt him after a pork-chop supper, or else she must have had a
very distorted imagination : how otherwise could she have conceived
anything so ugly Homer says that Juno was so disgusted with her
little prodigy, for, such indeed he was, that she pitched him, the
instant he was born, into the sea, where he remained nine years.
Homer does not add that all the Sea-Nymphs and Tritons voted him
an odd fish ; he forgot to mention that circumstance.
How, and why, Jupiter at a subsequent period kicked Vulcan out
of Heaven, we have seen. Truly, this unlucky god appears to have
received many more kicks than halfpence, which was probably the
reason why the Egyptians represented him like a monkey.
The broken leg which our divinity got when the law of gravitation
brought him down whack upon Lemnos was promptly attended to
by an eminent practitioner in the neighbourhood. The case, however,
was not a very successful one, the practice of the surgeon having
been previously exercised on the human subject, not on the god.
Lateral union took place between the divided bones, consequently
the limb was shortened; and the arithmetical process, called “dot
and carry one,” attended the progression of the patient thenceforward
for ever. -
Lemnos being full of blacksmiths, and possessing other attractions,
Vulcan found himself pleasantly situated there, and on his recovery
built himself a palace on the island. So says Tradition : Conjecture
suggests that he set up shop. He mended the pokers of the inha-
bitants, repaired their kettles, shoed their horses, and otherwise made
himself so generally useful, as to become a great favourite with them.
Divine painters are—that is to say, were—common enough ; but
divine tinkers are rare : the natives of Lemnos, therefore, must have
been sensible that they had a card among them.
The first job that Vulcan did on his own account was to make a
golden throne, intended for a present to his mother Juno...This
looks like filial affection, the returning of good for evil, and all that
is right and proper: but hear the sequel. Having completed his
work, Vulcan despatched the piece of furniture by a special aerial
steam-carriage to the summit of Olympus. When Juno beheld it,
her first thought was, “What a love of a throne " her second, “How
very kind of poor dear Vulcan " and her third, “How cruelly I
behaved to him when he was a little god 1" Her next reflection was
more of a common-place character: “Thrones,” said the Queen of
Heaven, “are made to sit upon,”—and she suited the action to the
word ; when instantly a concealed grating on either side of the
cushion flew up and fixed her in her seat on the principle of a man-
trap. She screamed ; Jupiter thundered; Mars swore ; Momus
laughed; and there was a great row. , Hercules, who had lately
arrived in Heaven, tried with all his might to force the bars asunder,
but they resisted his utmost efforts, although Momus advised him to
try again, and he complied with the request. Juno was decidedly
in a considerable “fix,” and it was clear that the contriver thereof
was the only person who could unfix her. Mercury, therefore, was
sent to require his attendance, but Vulcan would not come. Jupiter
at this flew into a towering passion, and was preparing to beat the
immortal recusant into as immortal a state of commination with
thunderbolts, when the wise Minerva suggested to him that that
precipitate proceeding would only render the extrication of Juno
hopeless ; and Bacchus volunteered to use his influence with
Vulcan ; so Jupiter put his thunder into his pocket again.

Mercury touched her tongue with French and Italian ; and Minerva
instructed her in geography, astronomy, and all the other branches.
of an elegant female education. Withal, Jupiter presented her with
a box, by way of dowry to the man who should narry her. The
reader will be beginning to wish that he had offended Jupiter; but
When Bacchus arrived at Lemnos, he found Vulcan at work
among his men, who were hymning the “Harmonious Blacksmith.”
(adapted for the purpose) to his praise and glory., Vulcan was glad
to see Bacchus, who was the greatest friend he had, and willingly
acceded to the latter's proposition of a pot of nectar.
So a table was

set in the middle of the workshop, and down they sat. Bacchus
proposed “Hammer and Tongs,” “Success to the Anvil,” and other
toasts, and then sung to the effect following:—
Earth is darken'd o'er with woe;
Bid the ruddy nectar flow:
Then we'll have another go.
(Here he cut an eccentric caper.)
Oh! of Nectar, a full pot
Is a nice thing, is it not?
Vulcan quaff the stuff before thee;
Nectar ! Nectar! I adore thee,
(Whereat he repeated his former proceeding.)
**Fore Jupiter,” cried Vulcan, by this time very tipsy, “an
excellent song. Encore t” Bacchus complied ; another toast suc-
ceeded, and Vulcan was easily prevailed upon to return to Heaven
and let his mother out.
A reconciliation having now been effected between Vulcan and
Jupiter, the former once more took his seat at the tables of Olympus.
It was high time; for Vulcan was sole manufacturer of thunderbolts
to his Majesty, and Jupiter's stock of ammunition was nearly out.
Jupiter also wanted the assistance of Vulcan to punish the presump-
tion of Prometheus, who had not only been concentrating in his own
person the collective audacity of nine tailors, by making a man; but
by means of an electrical kite had stolen fire from Heaven, where-
with to animate the production. “I’ll pay him for this,” thought
Jupiter; “I’ll give him a wife :” and he ordered Vulcan to manu-
facture her. He was obeyed ; and the result was the creation of
Pandora. She was called Pandora, because she received presents from
all the gods. Venus gave a bottle of Kalydor, in virtue of which she
realised a delicate white neck, hand, and arm, and a complexion of the
fairest hue; the Graces decorated her person and directed her steps;
Apollo taught her to sing like Mrs. Alfred Shaw or the nightingale;
let him not be in a hurry.
The charms of Pandora
were mere “springes to
catch woodcocks;” the box
was full, not of the root of
all evil, but of evil in
branch, flower, and fruit ;
plagues, distempers, fa-
mines, and all sorts of
miseries. How such things
could be contained in a
box it is difficult to con-
ceive ; but the box was a
mysterious and metaphy-
sical box : this, no doubt,
will be a satisfactory ex-
planation. Pandora, thus
beautified and endowed,
was conducted by Mercury
to Prometheus, but that
individual was far too ex-
tensively vigilant to be
taken in. He accordingly
transferred the lady to his
brother Epimetheus, who
jumped .. They were
married; Epimetheus, na-
turally concluding that the
box was full of money,
opened it, when out flew
the contents, and con-
verted the world into this
uncomfortable, plaguy,
vexatious penal settlement
which we find it. Out of
evil comes good. Hope,
by some chemical process,
had been formed during
the fermentation of the
evils in the box, of which
it had sunk to the bottom;
and amid all our bills and rates and taxes, the Income-tax inclusive,
and aches and pains and botherations, it luckily remains to us still.
Some authors maintain that the consolation which was left at the
bottom of Pandora's box was, in reality, no other than tobacco.
Vulcan's forge, where he made thunder and chains for his Majesty
Jupiter, was situated under Mount Etna; he had also a branch
establishment beneath each of the principal volcanoes. His workmen
were the Cyclopes, so called because they had great round eyes;
they possessed one apiece, in the situation of the organ of “Individu-
ality.” This optical apparatus resembled, in size and appearance, a
carriage bull's eye. The Cyclopes were giants, of large appetite,
extreme ferocity, and singular ugliness—like master, like men.
Vulcan forged (without counterfeiting) the arms of Achilles, as also
those of AEneas and the Shield of Hercules, which was as handsome
as the Waterloo Shield made by Messrs. Rundell and Bridge. He also
wrought a collar for Hermione or Mrs. Cadmus, which proved fatal to
all who wore it, although it was not a hempen collar-perhaps it was
an anodyne necklace, rather too strong of the opium.
“The amours of Vulcan,” observes Dr. Lempriere, “were not
numerous.” So one might imagine. It has been related that he
became the husband of Venus, and enough has already been stated
to show that his enjoyment of domestic bliss must have been par-
ticularly moderate. It appears, however, that he had a second wife,
who was no other than one of the Graces. Whether the maid-
servant treated him better than the mistress or not, we are not
informed. Vulcan seems to have had a tolerable taste, though he
did not show it in the arrangements of his toilette, Had he cultiv-
ated the Graces, all three, a little more, he had perhaps been a
happier god. A good temper is an indispensable quality in a husband,
but a sharp razor, and a well-used wash-hand-stand, are not less
essential requisites for the enjoyment of conjugal felicity.

Immortals, Punch thinks that perhaps he has been lecturing long
enough on Pagan Divinity. The Mythology might run a little longer
—but then it might get out of breath; for a train of composition is
not a steam-train. However, there is a certain person, it were im-
proper to say individual, because he was a demi-god, one Hercules,
about whom there is something to be disclosed. The world is not
generally aware that the said Hercules achieved a second series of
labours subsequently to the Christian era. When it comes to be in-
formed of the nature of these exploits, which, if it has patience, it
soon will,—if it does not say that Hercules was a trump, it will be as
ungrateful a world as the poets assert it to be.
COCKNEY COLLEGE.
At the late general meeting, the secretary read the report. Out of
eighty-six bachelors of arts, fifty had married, and become wranglers, as a
matter of course. The college had sold a doctorship of civil laws for
ready money, and had granted four fellowships, for which they had taken
cognovits, all of which were being liquidated in true academical style—
by degrees. The Polytechnic Institution was in treaty for a degree for the

man who shows the specimens of chemistry, in order that he might be
entitled to lecture under the name of Doctor. Among the receipts was
the usual allowance of ten pounds from the academical robe-makers of
the metropolis, whose trade had greatly increased by the very liberal
creation of LL.D.s, M.A.s, &c. which the Cockney College had indulged
in. It being desirable that a bishop should be appointed master, the
office was unanimously conferred on Bishop Sharpe, the pugilist. After a
vote of thanks to the chairman for gratuitously scrubbing the floor of the
room in which the meeting was held, it was adjourned sine die.
A LAY OF ANCIENT ROME.
Presumed to have been forwarded by Thomas Babington Macaulay, Esq.,
as a Specimen of his Poetry, when he sent in his Tender for the
Laureateship.
[Livy relates, what is in all probability a tremendous “romance,” that in the year 362,
s.c., a vast chasm opened in the Forum at Rome; which the oracle pronounced could
only be closed when the most precious things in Rome had been pitched into it. Marcus
Curtius, crying out that nothing was more precious than arms or valour, galloped into
the gulf, º; directly shut up.
In order that the reader may judge fairly of this poem, he must imagine himself a
plebeian standing in the Forum.]
THERE's tumult in the Forum, and each heart with dread is sinking,
The pale plebeians palsied stand, or cut about like winking.
The Praetor on the justice-seat is thinking about flight,
And every hair upon his wig is º; bolt upright;
With corns tight pinched by highlows, from his feet he tries to tear 'em,
Or rather might have done so, but the Romans didn't wear 'em.)
Sartorius, the tailor, quits his shop, and leaves a while
His Roman “Gents' New Togas”—ready-made, the latest style,
And joins a few Quirites now assembling in dismay,
Who prove by their loud wailings that there is old Dis to pay.
“What—what's the row tº a Tribune asks. Some subterraneous shake
Has split the centre of the earth, and caused a mighty quake.
Before the incensed Oracle a priest its warning bides,
White to the gaze as cygnet's plume—as downy, too, besides.
For since the March of Intellect, the merest dolt believes
Those Flamens of the Oracles were nought but thund'ring thieves;
A first-rate pack of artful cards, who, when they chose to play,
Dealt out the honours where they chose—shuffled, and cut away.
“Stop all your jaws,” the soothsayer cries, “this gulf will never close
Until within it are entomb'd the rarest things Rome knows;
Seek them forthwith, nor waste your time in vain and useless fear,
And see no rubbish be pick'd out—it may not be shot here.”
Then up sprang Marcus Curtius, and thus spoke: “My bricks, don't fear
At what I'm going to say—I'm not in a “state of beer;”
But don't you know how bravery, with trusty arms combin'd,
Must be the things most precious that amongst us you can find.
I think no small beer of myself, which you may plainly see,
Give me a horse, not worth too much,-and leave the rest to me.”
Forthwith he vaulted on his steed—a sorry sort of knack,
Because the owner felt convinced he ne'er should see it back.
And spur and whip he plied, to reach the borders of the pit,
But thence the horse refused to budge an atom—deuce a bit I
—
The Lictors lick'd him with their sticks—by Romans fasces call’d—
And rattled potsherds in his ears, and cried “Gee 1 gee 1” and bawl’d—
The Tribunes push'd his haunches, and a crowd of little boys,
Bearing amphorae fill'd with stones, kick'd up a mighty noise.
At length, when both the man and horse were scar'd at such a din,
All of a heap, head-over-heels, they straightway bundled in;
And scarcely had they disappeared, when, as the stories say,
The gulf closed up, like sliding-traps you witness at the play,
Then long live all this company—and Curtius long live he,
And when another leap takes place, may I be there to see,
And on it write another lay, wherever it may be.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAP. XVII. — MONSIEUR SPANNEU AND - 'S SCHOLARS.–I AM ILL-
USED BY A POODLE.
DEAR Mrs. Gaptooth felt for the double calamity of Madame
Spanneu all the sympathy of a sister. The heart of the matron,
upon her own grave assurance, bled for her friend; albeit, no woman
ever sat above a bleeding heart with sweeter composure. “It’s a
bad world, my dear,” said Mrs. Gaptooth, “but we're in it—we're
in it, and must make the best of it.” With this expression of phi-
losophy the old gentlewoman quitted the room, followed by Madame
Spanneu.
I had that day been turned over and over by several hands, and
had been carelessly thrown upon a chair, the price Madame Spanneu
placed upon my beauty being considered too extravagant by those
who came to purchase. I confess it, my situation became irksome to
me: I longed once more to be in the world: I had had sufficient of
retirement, and yearned for society. Whilst these thoughts possessed
me, one of Monsieur Spanneu's poodles frisked into the room. The
little beast was a most mischievous and volatile animal, despite the
daily lessons of a master to correct the vices of his constitution. He
was never so happy as when gnawing the edge of a carpet—jumping
up and tearing at the maids' aprons—biting the cat in the nape of the
neck — and, in fact, committing every license within the wicked
powers of puppyhood; a more irreclaimable little dog was never
born to the luxuries of life. As the poodle entered the room, I felt
a strange shudder. He came in with a light cautious air, treading
on the very tips of his toe-nails, and lifting up his jet-black nose, as
though he snuffed delicious mischief somewhere ; then, in very self-
abandonment, he chased his tail, spinning round like any opera-dancer.
Then, tired of the sport, he approached a table with sudden serious-
ness, and staring full at a blue riband or cap-string, twitched the
muslin on the floor, and in an instant buried his head, fighting it
the while with his fore-paws, in the cap itself. Never did a dog seem
more delighted—never was puppy so completely caught by a cap.
At length, by the very force of his admiration, the poodle tore the
cap into strips, and sated with that peculiar pleasure, looked round
about him for another victim. It was but an instant, and I was in
the poodle's mouth. That I, who had helped to decorate the Prince
of Wales, should be made the plaything of a dog 1 I felt that my
last moment was come—that my ignominious end was near. How
the poodle snapped at me and tossed me! Then, dropping me on the
floor, he barked and barked at me ; and then, after a momentary
pause, he caught me up in his mouth, and ran with me out of the
room. In another minute, the heedless puppy unseen by his master
carried me into Monsieur Spanneu's academy, for there was the
Frenchman, kit in hand, playing the Minuet de la Cour to a couple
of poodles, stamping, vociferating, swearing, whilst he played.
I have no doubt that the action of the Frenchman had sudden
operation on the fears of the animal that had carried me off, for the
dog crouched under a chair with me between his paws, now pulling
me through his teeth, and now contemplating in curious silence the
motions of his canine schoolfellows. I have little doubt, too, that a
somewhat ponderous whip, which the Frenchman remorselessly
applied to the backs of his students, had its due effect upon the trans-
gressing poodle; for as the whip cracked, and the culprits yelped and
howled, the poodle trembled throughout every hair, and yelped in
sympathy.
It was, however, delightful to witness the affectionate manner
with which Monsieur Spanneu inflicted punishment on his students.
“Ha! haſ non mignon,” he would cry, and the thong would wind
round the darling's body with force enough to crack it. “Viens, mon
ami,” the master would exclaim, at the same time kicking the pupil
to the other end of the school-room. He divided his time between
soft endearing phrases and hard thwacks. His lips dropt oil, but his
hand still bore a whip.
The poodle having left me beneath a chair, although I was some-
what flustered by the rough treatment I had received, I nevertheless
soon recovered sufficient composure to look about me. I then noted,
what I have since a thousand times remarked, the difference—even to
extremes—between a man in his reality and a man as we may, in our
imagination, have painted him. Here was Monsieur Spanneu, a short,
obese Frenchman ; yet surely never did man carry so much fat so
lightly. He was about four feet six in height, with a face ample as
the moon at the full, a broad forehead and bald head, its nudity half-
discovered by a nightcap half-slipped from its resting-place. Nothing
could have beeu more ludicrous than the aspect and manner of the
teacher, had they not been redeemed by an energy, a certain enthu-
siasm of purpose, that imparted to him something like dignity. It
was impossible to laugh outright at Monsieur Spanneu ; the earnest-
ness of the teacher would repress the giggle of the scoffer. It is true
he taught nothing but dogs; but then he convinced you that there
were no creatures on this earth so worthy of teaching. “A dog,”
Monsieur Spanneu would say, “is de only true friend of deman,” and
this opinion the master would dignify by laying on the whip to the
best friend of our species.
Whether Monsieur Spanneu's pupils were more than ordinarily
dull, or the master himself more than usually irascible, I cannot de-
termine; but never during my stay in the house had I heard such
crackings of the whip, such yelpings and howlings from the dogs, as
whilst I lay unseen beneath the chair, a witness of the discipline of
my host. Monsieur had arranged his pupils for a cotillon, when,
after the sweetest evidence of temper on his part, after the master
had twenty times called the dogs “mes petits,” “mes amis,” “mes
mignons,” “mes enfans,”—after he had lavished upon them all sorts of
endearing syllables, he lost his benevolence, and seizing his whip,
he went in among the poodles and laid about him like a thresher.
It was at this moment, when the very tiles of the house-top were
ringing with the howling of the dogs, and their master was raging
like a tempest, his face scarlet, and his forehead straining with pas-
sion, when Madame Spanneu rushed into the room, ceremoniously
followed by Mrs. Gaptooth.
“Monsieur Spanneu, I’ll put up with this nuisance no longer,” cried
Madame; and if ever woman looked in earnest, it was the wife of the
teacher.
Monsieur Spanneu was instantly composed. He stooped to pick
up the nightcap which in his energy had dropped from his head, and
folding it delicately, tenderly between his hands, he suffered a smile
to break all over his face, and bending with graceful devotion, he
said—“Ma belle Elise.” There was nothing in the words. Any other
husband might have called his wife his beautiful Eliza, but in the
manner of Monsieur Spanneu there was the devotion of a life. Never
was there such fealty paid to the wedding-ring. I saw it at once:
the poodles, whatever were their sufferings, were fully revenged by
the wife of their tyrant and teacher. The meekest, poorest dog there,
was a lion in heart and independence before Monsieur Spanneu,
compared to Monsieur Spanneu before his wife. Hence, the husband
met the ferocity of his helpmate with nothing more than a deprecating
bend of the back, and “Ma belle Elise.”
“None of your nonsense,” cried Madame Spanneu, that lofty-
minded woman rejecting what the weakness of her sex might have
deemed a compliment. “I won't have my house turned into a ken-
nel any longer. The dogs shall pack; and all the better if their
master packs with them.”
“Mon ange tº cried Monsieur Spanneu, his meekness, if possible,
increasing with the violence of his wife.
“Yes, you're a pretty fellow to call anybody your angel, you are ;
I’m none of your angels, I can tell you,”—exclaimed Madame
Spanneu, with a vigorous tossing of the head.
“Now, my dear,” said Mrs. Gaptooth, apparently with the best
spirits in the world, “ now, don't go on so—though, to be sure, so
many dogs must put any house in a most terrible pickle.”
“Pickle !” cried Madame Spanneu, with intense shrillness of
organ; “Pickle 1"
“Ma chère,” said the husband with a lost look, as though that one
word pickle had conjured about him a throng of terrors which he
felt it were in vain to struggle with. Had Madame Spanneu not been
the poor man's wife, she must have pitied him ; as it was, pity was
the last feeling to be wasted on him.
“Pickle !” for the third time screamed Madame Spanneu, and I
could perceive as she moved from the door, that her husband shifted
himself, preparing to make a retreat. “I wonder that the floor
doesn't open and swallow you at the word,” she cried.
“Ma belle Elise 1" said the Frenchman, but he spoke in vain.
“I wonder that you can have the impudence to exist—you, that I
have given house and home to—you that I harbour, with your filthy
curs—you that—”
The Frenchman was about to fly, when casting his eye about, he
observed me lying tumbled and bitten beneath the chair. The poor
man turned ghastly pale when he saw me. He was at once assured
of the ill behaviour of one of his dogs, and of the increased abuse
which would fall upon him, should his wife discover the accident.
He must suffer anything, rather than permit the chance of such dis-
closure; hence, with false courage, he approached the chair beneath
which I lay, and seating himself, so arranged his legs as to keep me
out of sight.

And then Madame Spanneu began again to abuse her husband,
whilst he—poor man —began to tune his fiddle. Again did the wife
call out “False, vile wretch l—miserable Frenchman 1" whilst the
Gaul, affecting philosophy, drew his bow, and sang—“Nous n’arons
qu'un tems a rirre.”
$otiftp for the 3}romotion of 3gricultural Chemistry.
PRofessor GRUBEMUP, who was in the chair, congratulated the meeting
on the fact that this noble science is looking up ; and that people who
have gardens never think of employing a gardener, but send at once for
their medical man in case of anything being required.
º
Taring A Black draught.
Mr. Kidney Tatur related a curious case which had fallen the other day
under his own observation. A daisy was in a very delicate state, having
caught cold from being placed in a damp flower-pot. Active astringents
were tried, and bandages of twine were promptly applied in the hope of
keeping the patient up ; but it was too late, and the plant expired.
Mr. Water Potter observed, that a few days ago some cabbages were
carried off from his garden in a very unaccountable manner. . It was at
first supposed to be ordinary consumption ; but having sat up by the side
of the bed all night, he found that the plants were subjected to abstraction.
Having a dog with him, Bark (not quinine, but canine,) was tried with
some success; and being followed up smartly with flogistic treatment, the
remedy was effectual.
The chairman called attention to the gratifying intelligence, received a
few days ago from Dover. It would appear that powder, in large doses,
had been found very useful in opening the bowels of the earth, on two
recent occasions.
Mr. Grubemup reported, that as some peas he had set were in a back-
ward state, he had applied blisters to the earth, which he thought had suc-
ceeded in drawing them up earlier than might have been expected.
Mr. Kidney Tatur laid before the meeting the result of some curious
•xperiments on some sweet peas and other annuals. He had dug in a
quantity of Parr's Life Pills, but had in no case succeeded in prolonging
the existence of the plants beyond the natural period. He had likewise
discovered the following cure for Sleepy Apples:—Water with an infusion
of green tea; and before it is taken let the branches be well shaken.
The Meeting then separated.
Notice to Everybody.
The projectors of the Aerial Ship are now prepared to take contracts
for regulating clocks and watches by the day, week, month, or year. Their

“Why is a butcher's cart like his boots?”—“Because he carries his

We have received accounts of the riots at Dantzic, but we are glad
to hear the effervescence is not connected with the spruce, which, con-

In Spain, matters are looking black, particularly liquorice. Espartero
appeared at the windows of the palace ; there was a crowd beneath, but
he did not seem disposed to throw himself upon the people.
Some uneasiness was manifested at the White Horse Cellar in conse-
quence of the non-arrival of Cloud's Kensington Omnibus, which had
been due nearly fourteen minutes. Our correspondent's patience being
tired out, he left the spot without waiting for despatches; but he was soon
overtaken by an extraordinary courier, in the shape of the crossing-
sweeper, who notified the arrival, at the same time announcing that there
were no letters.
Advices from Brook Green speak of an inundation, but we have no
reason to put any faith in the rumour, for the facts which have reached
us from that quarter are all of the very driest character. Our annual
letter from Islington speaks of the continued tranquillity of that extensive
district. Bread was selling at sixpence halfpenny the four-pound loaf ;
and the parish clerk remained in undisputed possession of his office. A
circular, signed “A Rate-payer,” had been left at the principal dwellings,
but the good sense of the people, combined with the firmness of the civil
force (whose civility is, by the bye, rather on the increase) had prevented
all disposition to an outbreak. There was, however, a rumour of an erup-
tion among the younger part of the population, but on inquiry it turned
out to be a very mild form of nettle-rash.
THE BOTANICAL SOCIETY.
This excellent institution had a very numerous meeting last week, when
the secretary was absent without notice, but left a very clever paper on
French leaves, which was read by the chairman, but it did not appear to
be by any means satisfactory. A member produced a very interesting
specimen of the gramen lapidale or vegetabilis viatica, being a clump of
spinach picked out of the middle of the High-street, at Sandwich. It was
a remarkable fact that it had not been affected by the traffic, which, by
the last returns had consisted of five vehicles and twenty-four foot
passengers within the last fortnight.
Mr. Snoodles read a paper on parsley in connexion with butter, and
illustrated its effect on calves'-heads by a variety of experiments carried
out with reference to the members present.
A lengthy discussion then took place upon lettuces, and a deputation to
undertake an expedition to Cos, with a view to cultivating a closer know-
ledge of the cos lettuce than at present exists in this country.
THE GRATUITOUS EXHIBITIONS OF LONDON.
No. II.--THE OUTSIDE OF THE PROMENADE OF WONDERS,
High hol, born.
There are very few people in the world who do not keep a show
of some kind or another, and this, more especially at the present
time, when getting a livelihood by any old-fashioned, plain-sailing
occupation has gone so completely out of fashion. We do not mean
to assert that the majority of our fellow-creatures in all conditions of
life travel about in yellow caravans with green shutters picked out
with red, or vaunt the wonders of their collections through speaking-
trumpets, to gaping crowds of spectators, whose pence, they are
desirous of transferring to their own pockets; but still they strive
by mountebank performances to attract the mob, and hang forth
specious representations to astonish the vulgar; being, at the same
time perfectly aware of their utter inability to make good the
vaunting promises of their showboards. But this is to them of
little consequence; they have succeeded in creating a sensation
and attracting a multitude,-the rest of their task is comparatively
Acting upon this principle, the proprietors of the perambulating
pavilions that attend our fairs, usually render the performances upon
the platforms of their temporary museums of an enticing character.
Their pictures, too, are equally alluring, for besides a highly-coloured
representation of the marvels to be seen within, the eyes of common
people are dazzled by views of costly apartments and gorgeous
draperies, wherein most elegant company, officers, wealthy landed

proprietors, fashionable ladies, and even jewelled Turks, are inspect-
ing the curiosities, whatever they may be, and evincing their
wondrous astonishment by unmistakeable and strongly-marked
gestures of surprise. The character of the interior, its close and
cabined proportions and poverty-stricken appointments, present a
curious contrast; not more decided however than may be found in
everyday-life, when actually admitted to the penetralia of what are
apparently its most inviting features,-those features being usually
an attractive mask to cover a face of a far different aspect.
Aware of the power of external display, and deeply imbued with
a knowledge of human nature, the proprietor of the PRomENADE of
Won DERs, which we are about to notice, rivets the attention of
passers-by by the gratuitous exhibition which his unbounded collec-
tion enables him to set forth. We do not however mean to say that
his in-door display is inferior to the al fresco one. It may be much
better for aught we know—but we have never seen it : we have
always been so content with gazing at those curiosities which his
liberality allows us to see for nothing, that we never felt inclined to
enter, for fear the charm of mystery which invests each window of
his establishment, as transmitting light to the depository of the real
"4A sights so dimly shadowed forth upon the external
§. showboards, should be rudely broken.
º The first view of this great establishment is ob-
tained on arriving at the top of Drury Lane, where
that interesting thoroughfare debouches in High-
street, St. Giles's ; and the first object that causes
the visitor to pause and draw his breath with
awe, is the representation of a mighty giant,

fixed against the front of the house. IIe is of vast proportions,
and his foreign costume increases the interest felt in contem-
plating him, especially when we reflect that his prototype dwells
within. From the size of his model, which is not a mere pic-
ture, but cut out of flat wood, he must evidently occupy two floors at
once, and doubtless the ceiling between the first and second story
has been knocked away to accommodate him. The artistic Frank-
enstein of the establishment has succeeded in throwing into his face
an expression of contempt for the pigmies who pass and repass in
the streets below. He has evidently sympathy with but one object,
and that is the Brobdignagian Dust-pan opposite, over the door of
the ironmonger's shop. It would be a fitting implement in the house-
hold of so mighty a creation. But that his disposition is contented,
we learn from the humble look of the rooms which are probably
assigned to him : that his nature is gentle, we perceive at once, from
the freedom from apprehension which is exhibited in the countenance
of the gentleman visitor of ordinary stature, who is kneeling upon
one knee to measure the girth of his calf. But with all this, the
somewhat damaged appearance of the right side of his head evinces
former injuries, received doubtlessly in some of those Titanic skrim-
mages which we have learnt from our earliest infancy that the giants
loved to indulge in.
Below this imposing image the spectator may behold some pictorial
fac-similes of other wonders. The two Fat Boys—brothers, as we are
told—are here the principal objects, and worthy to associate with the
great character above. Doubtless they had the same elements of
grandeur in their composition; but from impending circumstances,
which kept them from shooting up in a similar manner, they grew
sideways instead of upright, like ivy in a cleft of masonry. They got
in breadth what the giant did in height; and thus did nature balance
one freak by another, and restore her universal harmonious equi-
librium. They evidently form a great feature in the collection of the
interior, for there are evidences of other graphic tableaux in front of
the house, but they are nearly hidden by the illuminated canvass on
which the two adipose brothers are limned. We have a vague recol-
lection that on one of them was formerly depicted a young lady with
pink eyes, which the showman informed us gratuitously were con-
stantly in motion; and flowing tresses of long white horse-hair, the
which she was industriously brushing, to the evident delight of the
bystanders. Once she was the card of the exhibition; but now, like
other successful candidates for popularity, she has had her day, and
passed away as rapidly as the card of the Wizard of the North.
On the ground-floor, in the window of this magazine of curiosities,
is a still further interesting collection of marvels, which will more
than repay a few minutes of inspection. They may be classed under
four heads: viz., the Architectural, Mechanical, Anatomical, and
Unintelligible. The first is comprised in an elaborate model of “The
Castle of Doune, on the banks of the Forth, Stirlingshire;” from, or
in, or near which, somebody or another was beheaded : but the spec-
tator has not time to find out who, before the showman approaches
him, and announces in a low voice, as if the intelligence was not
meant for the vulgar world, that the exhibition is just going to com-
mence. This interruption prevents his paying great attention to the
curiosities. He will perceive, however, two wax dolls sitting on the
tops of the turrets; and a monkey, nearly as high as the building,
smoking his pipe in front of it.
The Mechanical objects are rather select than numerous. There
is a representation of the Spotted Boy in a glass case, as well as a
group of small figures which the spectator will not be able exactly to
comprehend : but the triumph of art is shown in a railway-engine and
tender, shut up in a bottle, without any visible means of explaining
how it got in there. In the Anatomical department, we find two
skeletons of cats' heads, and a preparation of a singular pig in spirits:
whilst the Unintelligible division is composed of various wonders
which we cannot describe, being perfectly ignorant of their uses or
intent; but which we recommend the ingenious spectator to go and
inspect himself.
By looking in at the door, you obtain a dim view of the interior,
whose portals are guarded by a wax-work figure of such Protean
existence, that the doctrine of metempsychosis is no longer so vague
a theory, inasmuch as this representation has been by turns every
leading or notorious character of the day. But this surreptitious view
of the penetralia is by no means to be recommended, inasmuch as
you are liable to be driven, by the constant tide of foot-passengers,
first one way, then another, and, finally, into the gutter under the
omnibuses.
We have not yet heard whether the Government has it in contem-
plation to purchase this valuable collection; but we should not be
surprised at this, since the expense of moving it from its present
site to the rival establishment in Great Russell-street would be but
small—the distance being comparatively insignificant.

THE JENKINS” “ NETTLES.”
Our readers cannot forget that The Morning Post—(nay, The Morn-
ing Jenkins' for by such amended name, thanks to Punch, is that great
diurnal now known to all men)—recently recommended a plentiful
meal of “young nettle tops” as the very best thing for purifying the
blood, and thereby purging all the land of what dear JENKins would
call its canaille. Great is JENKINs, whether he wield pasteboard
thunderbolts, or, pant and dilate upon the glories of his own cirtuosi
and ballerine ! JENKINs—like another most meek and most domestic
animal—cannot open his mouth without being heard around. The
prescription brayed by JENKINs has penetrated the recesses of
Whitechapel — has struck upon the heart-strings of Shoreditch.
Punch feels glorious that he can produce proofs of this, and here they
are in grateful letters from correspondents.
Mr. PUNCH,-I am a tailor, sir, married, with a family of two
sons and two daughters. I have, in my time, been called a very

common-looking man, and my wife a ditto woman. Our children,
sir, did also partake of the look of that sort of human mud, of which
Mr. Jenkins would insinuate, common folks are made. Sir, the
mud is gone—I, my wife, my sons and daughters, are now tip-top
clay. The “frowsiness” of which Mr. Jenkins spoke is utterly
evaporated, given place to a delicious smell of something between
lavender-water and musk; this, as I am told, being the real odour of
high life. Well, sir, and how do you think all this blessed change
has been brought about? By nettle-tops, nothing but nettle-tops.
There was a long-standing (though small) account between Mr.
Jenkins and myself for turning an opera-waistcoat, and I therefore
put myself and family under his treatment as a sort of set-off. For
a whole, week; sir, Mr. Jenkins came to Whitechapel, to su-
perintend the boiling of the nettles; and the result is, my blood
is purified to something very like the blood of a baronet –
AFTER Taxing THE NETTLEs.
my wife's blood (as she herself declares) feels very like the blood of a
baronet's lady whilst my dear girls, Margarita and Sophinisba, full of
nettles, consider themselves no less than the daughters of a marquess.
My boy Ralph has changed his name into Alphonso, and Dick goes
now to the Opera gallery as Ella, the door-keepers verily believing
him to be the tenth in a zig-zag descent from a German prince
And all this—all with Jenkins's nettles. The craving for the
wondrous vegetable is getting very strong throughout the neighbour-
hood. If matters go on as at present for another week, all the blood
of all Whitechapel will be of as fine a quality as the blood of May-
Fair. All honour to Jenkins !
Your obedient Servant,
Whitechapel, May 8th. PETER Gooseton, Tailor.
Sinº-I was a shoemaker with a hump-back. I was 'prenticed
from Shoreditch parish; but by the blessing of hard work and wax
set up on my own account. Having for several years heel-tapped
Mr. Jenkins's boots for the Opera, I got a taste for that place. Never-
theless, my visits to the pit (especially when I took my wife with
me) were not without their sting, as I could not but feel that I was a
shoemaker, and that my wife was—“frowsy.”
Oh, sir, I shall always keep the return of the day with thanks-
giving—that day, when I first read Mr. Jenkins's recipe of nettles.
We have all lived upon their young “tops” for this past ten days,
and the consequence is I have entirely lost my vulgar hump-back,
feel myself as good as any Earl, and believe my wife Margery to be
as sweet as any perfume as is.
I do, sir, but consider it a duty to make known this wonderful cure
—a duty of love towards my unfortunate fellow-creatures, and a duty
of gratitude towards the benevolent Mr. JENKINs.
I am, sir, your obedient Servant,
Shoreditch, May 6th. ALExANDER Nobby, Shoemaker.
Talk about the triumphs of vaccination Why, only give JEN-
KINs a field of nettles, and he would in a trice make a House of

DEATH AND MAMMON 1
THE subjoined ghastly paragraph (on the easy authority of an
Evening Paper) is to be seen in all the journals —
“THE Missing "Parsi DENT.”—Perhaps no event connected with the sea excited
such intense interest, and anxiety as the mysterious disappearance of the “President’;
and the conjectures that her supposed fate has called forth are innumerable. If the most
ample room for fancy afford the fairest field for fiction, never was a theme more aptly
suited to the pen of the romance writer. We have been given to understand in literary
circles, that the well-known author of “Cavendish' has availed himself of this powerful
incident as the chief subject of his new naval romance, called “The Lost Ship"—a cir-
cumstance that will no doubt create the greatest interest towards this new production
of his popular pen.”—Evening Paper.
Who the author of Carendish may be we know not; but he must be
something more than a bold man who would turn the penny upon a
subject which must renew the agony of the surviving relatives and
friends of those who perished in the President. It is, however, quite
of a piece with the trading selfishness of the age. Anything for
money. Never mind broken hearts—look only to the breeches
pocket. -
We will suppose the “Author of Carendish” to be Ferdinand in
The Tempest. We will suppose him listening to the song of Ariel—
“Full fathom five thy father lies;
of his bones are coral made:
Those are pearls that were his eyes,
Nothing of him but doth fade l’”
The song ended, the “Author of Cavendish” rubs his hands with
inexpressible gratification, and animated by the spirit which induces
him to turn the horror of the President into hard cash,_we can ima-
gine him willing to take the said “bones” in “coral” to the gold-
smith's, and the said “eyes” turned to “pearls” to the jeweller's.
The father being drowned, becomes more valuable ; as the bones of
those wrecked in the President are, to the “Author of Carendish,” a
more money-making commodity than if clothed with living flesh,
and moving amongst living kindred.
SILK Gowns.—Mrs. Sarah Bird, a lunatic, was a few days since ex-
amined by a Commission. The gentlewoman observed, anongst other
matters, “As for the Lord Chancellor, only let him come and see me
cook a dinner. What a fool he must be to allow himself to be imposed
upon.” Punch is authorized to state that the unfortunate lady had no
intention by these words to reflect upon the present of a silk gown recently
made by Lord Lyndhurst to Mr. Roebuck.

à Qurkish 3Letter tomterming the Tibertisstment
“3Lts ſºouris.”
(translated by our own dragoman.)
London, A.H. 1222.
Hadji Heer to Hadji Thain-
Adur THAIR, thou friend of my youth ! Long had I
been in this miserable city of the Giaours, before
I could discover that there was any place to which
the faithful could resort to the comfort of their souls
and the praise of the great Prophet. Yea, the sound
of the mufti's voice was not heard from theminaret,
the cupola of the mosque did not present itself to
*Sº Y the thirsting eye of the Mussulman, and at the corner
of every street were vast palaces called the palaces of Djin, where the
forbidden liquor, and other liquors even more abominable, were sold to
the infidels. The atmosphere of the whole city was a stench in the nos-
trils of the faithful, and my soul was cast down.
But Allah is great, and Mahomet is his prophet. I have found refresh-
ment for my soul; I have discovered the greenplace in the desert, where
the faithful may water the camels of their hearts and eat the dates of
consolation. For after sunset yesterday I was taken to a splendid palace,
called the Hop-Rah, and then did I see the doctrines of the Prophet set
forth in a most sublime fashion. Yea, the truth of the Koran was
realised; and would that the venerable Imaum Bigh-Phul, who instructed
both me and thee, friend of my youth, in our infancy, had been present
He would have stroked his white beard with delight, and privily mur-
mured Allah Bismilla.
This Hop-rah belongs to the powerful Ameer, whom they call Ben Lomli,
and who endeavoureth to instil into the hearts of the perverse Giaours
a few drops of the only true doctrine. Oh a faithful Mussulman must he
be, for it is said that, once, when he was told the Hop-rah was full of
guests, he exclaimed, “Then great is the Prophet !” By a living picture
has he shown the blessed effects of abstaining from the forbidden liquor,
and wo be to the Giaours if their hearts now remained unchanged. For
he hath set forth the delights of Paradise, and the fascination of the
Houris, and how they were awarded to a youth who spurned the intoxi-
cating drink. He hath represented Paradise full of clouds, which shine
brightly, as the smoke from the pipe of the Commander of the Faithful.
And the principal Houri is called Doom-y-lateer, whose eyes shine like
the tiger's, whose skin is fair as the snow of Caucasus, tinged with the
roses of the setting sun, and whose face is like the brightness of the moon.
This fair Houri floats among the clouds, spreading delight around her;
and even the Giaours, who frequent the palace, do exclaim with delight,
when they see how she droppeth into the arms of the faithful youth. And
there are many other Houris, who inhabit the happy realm, and of these
the leaders be called Ka-Meel, Shay-Fer, and Plan-Kai. And in Paradise
do these eternal maidens disport themselves, and await the coming of true
believers, whom they will crown with celestial joy. Friend of my youth,
I still think on the young Ka-Meel, whose feet are as those of the antelope,
when he prances to the music that the bulbul uttereth when he singeth to
the rose. The picture, as I am told, is the work of a holy man, a spinning
Dervish, named Pey-Roh. Oh, Hadji Thair, remember the Koran, and
the precepts of Big-Phul, the preceptor of our infancy; and in future
times, when the Giaours shall have fallen from the narrow bridge into the
endless abyss, we shall live with the lovely Houris, Doom-y-lateer, Ka-
Meel, Shay-Fer, and Plan-Kai. Ever thine,
HADJI HEER.

BIRTH OF ANOTHER PRINCESS.
(From our own Reporter.)
It will be recollected by our readers that the birth of the Prince of
Wales had a very curious effect on the nose of the Princess Royal, which
was completely put out of joint by the auspicious circumstance alluded to.

handling a subject.
There were some apprehensions that the nasal organ of the heir-apparent
might be affected by the birth of a younger sister, but we are happy to say
that there are no symptoms of a derangement of the Prince's proboscis at
present.
The ruddy complexion of the newly-born royal infant has been the sub-
ject of much conversation at the palace; and so satisfactory is her
Majesty's health that she has been able to make a joke, which it gives us
infinite pleasure to chronicle. Seeing the little Princess in the arms of
her Royal Highness's nurse—the celebrated Mrs. Lilly, - the Queen
remarked, that to see its little red cheeks resting on the arm of her
attendant, were strongly suggestive of “the Rose and the Lily.”
The Princess Royal, on being introduced to her little sister, received its
little finger in her Royal Highness's eye, an ebullition of playfulness on
the part of the younger Princess which caused the elder some temporary
inconvenience. We understand that Prince Albert has been studying
Ride-a-cock-horse and other native nursery melodies under Sir Henry
Bishop. Mr. J. H. Tully has been employed to put variations to the
charming moryeau of
Baby, baby Bunting,

which Lady Littleton will immediately study, for the gratification of her
very interesting charges.
Donizetti has been requested to arrange a series of concertos for the
penny trumpet, and he has already sent in to the palace one on the noble
tema of “This little pig went to market.” We give the Italian words—

E a casa restato.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
—TN—
PUNCH'S PARLIAMENTARY PALACE.
During the recess PUNCH was requested by the Fine Arts' Commis-
sion to make a survey of the new Houses of Parliament, and to furnish
the Commission with a report of his views as to the “internal decorations,
addition to building, and local improvements.”
The especial object of the Commission being to devise means for the
encouragement and display of the arts in the new Houses, we were some-
what mortified to find, that from the necessity of throwing as much light
as possible on the proceedings of the members, the architect has been
compelled to occupy so large a portion of the walls for windows, as to leave
no adequate space for paintings or sculptures. We were, however, gra-
tified by his having provided for these matters in the passages on the
various floors of the building; these “corridors,” extending to upwards of
three quarters of a mile, affording space enough for illustrating the doings
of even the Long Parliament, should such a subject be preferred by the
Royal Commission. By way of set-off, too, it is proposed that Westminster
Hall be converted into a painted hall, and decorated, moreover, with
Chinese gongs and other warlike trophies; and that all the flags that
have “braved a thousand years,” &c. be collected and hung around it,
and that an offer be made to Madame Tussaud for her collection of
effigies of British statesmen, to be placed on the floor of the hall, so as to
form a central avenue.
We entirely agree with the architect when he states, that he has “ever
considered it a great defect in his design,” that on the land-side there is
nothing worth looking at except the Victoria Tower, which will be obscured
by the Abbey; whilst for the river view there is no point from which it
can be seen except on the coal-barges or opposite wharfs. To remedy the
former defects it is proposed altogether to remove Westminster Abbey,
which plan will have the advantage of disposing of the question about
throwing it open to the public ; and, to obtain the “desired length of
front,” to enclose New Palace Yard by a stone screen, to be filled up with
sheets of plate-glass, to protect the cab-stand from “nor-westers” and
at the corner to erect a triumphal archway, to which may be attached the
Gates of Somnauth, if no other hanging-place can be found for them.
The interior of the arch might conveniently be fitted up as a public-house.
It is also proposed to remove all the houses between this new gatehouse and
the Banqueting-house at Whitehall—so rich in historical association, and
so intimately connected with the Parliamentary annals of this country.
Extending our survey across the river, it is proposed to rebuild the super-
structure of Westminster Bridge, to accord with what the architect styles
the “principle of the new building;” and to do this, without any creation of
new piers, it is estimated will only cost an odd hundred thousand or two—
a mere trifle, with the surplus income-tax in hand. It is also proposed to
continue that elegant structure, the Greenwich Railway, to Nine Elms;
thus commanding a view of the New Houses from the south side, and
removing such “low” excrescences as Lambeth Palace and Church; and,
finally, to remove all objects between the Penitentiary and Victoria Tower,
leaving a clear space for her Majesty's vans going to the former depository,
for state processions, and hack “Broughams,” &c., in attendance on the
House of Lords.
Punch suggests, that to carry these rather extensive improvements into
effect, it may be necessary to re-levy a “house"-tax.
PUNCH'S LABOURS OF HERCULEs.
A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.—HOW HERCULES was SRT TO work.
Tºuis Ms are superfluous-though this assertion is a truism: it is
needless, therefore, to remind the reader that we are now living in
the Millennium. Oppression is unheard of, Injustice unknown, as
for Pºverty, we never mention it. Peace and Plenty everywhere
prevail; and Charity reigns paramount throughout the world.
There was, however, once a time when men lied, cheated, tyran-
nised, cut each other's throats, and picked one another's pockets; when
one class surfeited and another starved; when Dives in his mansion,
arrayed in purple and fine linen, stuffed himself into a monstrosity,
and Lazarus in the workhouse, in pauper uniform, and on the “coarser
kind of food,” was famished into a skeleton. To have attained, there-
fore, to its present state of blessedness, the world must have undergone
a glorious reformation. How came this about? Through Hercules,
who wrought a second series of labours for the express purpose.
Jupiter, from his arm-chair in sublimest ether, looking down on
the navigable ocean and on the earth, spread like Mr. Wyld's
atlas beneath him, beheld rascality pervading land and sea. We
say sea, advisedly, for there were nautical naughtinesses as well as
land villanies in those days, and it was impossible even for the
British tar to touch pitch and not be defiled. All this Jupiter seeing,
he flew for the ten-millionth time into a great fury, and indignantly
grasped his thunder. But recollecting how often he had tried that
remedy without effect, and considering that when you fire on a mob
it is a chance whom you hit and whom you miss, he put it down
again and scratched his head. “What is to be done with those
fellows " said Jupiter. “Minerva, you have a head of your own,
how shall I put them to rights?”
The blue-eyed goddess assumed an attitude of reflection, and after
a few moments’ thought, touched her alabaster forehead with the
ivory tip of her forefinger, and cried, “I have it. Father of the gods
and men, send your son Hercules among them with his club. He
will soon settle their affairs.”
“Hercules with his club " exclaimed Jupiter. “I don't see,
daughter, what he is to do with that. He might kill monsters with
it; but how is he to redress wrongs r"
“Wrongs,” answered the goddess, “are monsters. There are giant
wrongs upon Earth. Hercules shall slay the giants with his club.
With the same instrument, too, he shall beat sense and reason into
the heads of the sons of men.”
Jupiter flung up his crown into the air and caught it, danced thrice
round the celestial hall, “oscula libavit natae,” as Virgil hath it, in
plain English, kissed his daughter, and called out for Hercules at the
top of his lungs. “Here you are, governor "cried the deep-toned voice
of the deified hero; “anything in my way Toujours prêt, you know.”
“Don’t talk French, boy,” said Jupiter; “the language is not heroic.
What I want you to do, is just to step down to that ball of earth
there, and put yonder disorderly rabble to rights with your Malacca.
Minerva says you can do it. Can you?”
“Why you are omniscient, sire,” answered Hercules; “of course
you know best.”
“Yes, yes,” said Jupiter, with a slight cough, “I merely made the
inquiry conventionally. But never mind that. Verbosity is inad-
missible when delays are dangerous. So, without more ceremony,
oblige me, and be off about your business. Amputate your cane.”
“If I do that, thought Hercules, how am I to make use of it?”
He kept however this reflection to himself, and with all alacrity
complied with the request of his father.
He alighted, after a very pleasant journey through the azure deep
of air, upon Primrose-hill. “It strikes me,” observed the demigod,
as he was preparing himself for his adventures, “that I am remark-
ably like Don Quixote—only a little stouter.”
CHAPTER I.--THE FIRST LABour.—How HERCULES SLEw THE RED
LION, FELLOW TO AND FELLER THAN THE LION OF NEMAEA.
The first monster that Hercules attacked, was a formidable and
ferocious lion, to which the Nemacan Lion—to say nothing of the
Lion Wallace, was a mere kitten. This lion was not a four-legged
lion,-indeed he was soon not a legged lion at all, for Hercules left
him not a leg to stand upon. He was a biped brute;—but such a
brute! He had a scarlet coat, with a sort of yellow fringe upon each
shoulder; and he wore, in place of a mane, a stiff black collar about
his neck. His head was surmounted by a kidney-shaped, comb-like
excrescence of black felt, from which sprung great plumes, as of
feathers, white and red. His dexter fore-paw, or hand, was armed
with a weapon of iron ever dripping with purple gore. His eyes
flashed lightning, and he breathed out fire and smoke and red-hot can-
non balls. He strode among crushed and mangled carcases, through
burning cities and over blood-bedabbled decks, and he trampled on
the dying and the dead. Around him, were yelling and blasphemy,
shouts of rage and screams for mercy. Legions of his cubs, ferocious
as himself, followed him ; they hauled delicate and tender women
by the hair over flinty streets, tore little children to pieces, and cleft
feeble old men to the chine. He had desolated Earth and scandal-
ised Heaven for ages: he was a murderer from the beginning, and
his name was War
Men committed idolatry to this Lion; they sung hymns to his
praise and glory, and they suspended trophies in his honour in their
Houses of Prayer. They glorified his very cubs; they dressed them
out in fine clothes to make them look handsome, and they called them
grand names;–Captains, Colonels, Generals, and Field Marshals;
and some they worshipped under the name of Lords. The Ladies
smoothed them down, and patted them on the back, and smiled upon
them, and toyed with them, and made much of them, to the no small
envy of their own peaceable admirers. They would rush to windows
to see a herd of them go by, strutting, prancing, and looking fierce, to
the sound of trumpet and drum, and they would kiss their hands to
them from balconies and high places. In short, they aided, abetted,
and comforted them to the very utmost of their power.
These whelps of the Red Lion would sometimes march under the
command of a leader to a temple or place of worship, where it was
often proclaimed in their presence that all they who took the sword
should perish by the sword; but their brute natures prevented them
from understanding what they heard; moreover, they were strictly
prohibited from even attempting to think, and had any one of them

acted on the doctrine in question, he would have been destroyed by
the rest without mercy.
In order to check the slightest tendency in their minds towards
reflection, they were never allowed to move except to noisy and
boisterous music, which kept them in a state of mental intoxication
highly antagonistic to rationality. This was very expedient ; for
even a brute, if it came to think and meditate on the sensations
accompanying the having its entrails torn out, or its limbs crushed
into a jelly, and on the commodiousness of a wooden leg, would
hardly be inclined to put itself in the way of such pleasantnesses for
thirteenpence a day, even though it should be dressed up and tricked
out, and called a fine fellow into the bargain.
To keep the cubs in order was not always easy; and it was often-
times necessary, even for a trifling misdemeanor, to tie one of them
up to a stake and whip the hide off the creature's bones, for the
edification of all the rest and the amusement of the casual looker-on.
Now that these animals and their sire must have been a great
nuisance, the abatement of which would be no small boon to society,
is very obvious and apparent. Their own existence being involved
in that of their parent, to destroy the old Red Lion was to annihilate
his progeny. What Hercules had to do, therefore, was to knock
War on the head. In the case of the Nemaean Lion, he did this at
once; but in the present instance, he adopted a more circuitous
course. He had a harder job to do this time.
He found that the Lion, War, was fed and maintained upon certain
errors and prejudices, which he would previously have to knock out
of people's heads; this, therefore, he first set to work to accomplish.
With his omnipotent Club, which the reader must know was a
moral and intellectual Club, (a Punch-Club, in fact,) he beat and
drove out of the heads of the nations the fallacy that there was any
thing fine in the nature of this beast. He took the l out of the glory
of War, and showed them that it should rightly be called gory. He
divested the evil of the magnitude which gave it sublimity in pigmy
eyes; he pummelled it into a small thing, and then men found it
wilful murder, and saw that it was bad.
knot, were cousins-german, and uniforms became in their sight as
liveries. He took a child's drum and beat it; and he squeaked
through a penny trumpet about the streets, till at last people laughed
at the Coldstream band.
He corked his eyebrows and stuck moustaches on his upper lip, and
dressed himself up in a cocked hat and scarlet coat like the monkey
of an Italian organ-boy, and so walked up and down Regent street
with the air of Lord Bateman, (no policeman daring to take him up;)
and wherever he went, he cocked his chin and swore oaths. The boys
followed him at first, but they soon took to following the Com-
mander-in-Chief also.
When he found himself in the company of sensitive females, he
would describe the processes of racking, breaking on the wheel,
impalement, burning alive, and other similar modes of pleasurably
exciting the nervous system, which, as history informs us were
formerly in vogue, until the sweet creatures grew sick, and pale, and
faint, with horror and disgust. And then he hammered into their soft
heads the perception that bayonets, shots, shells and rockets, were pre-
cisely similar in their operation to the tools of the common hangman.
He expatiated in all companies on the beauty of the precept,
“Love your enemies,” (which we do not observe now only because
we have no enemies to love ;) explained the compatibility of its
observance with cutting their throats, ripping up their stomachs
and dashing out their brains ; and cited the example of a drunken
Irishman at Donnybrook Fair to show how reasonable and sensible
such conduct was.
He described the march of an invading army, and the taking of a
town by storm ; and drew a very pretty and pleasing picture of the
blazing corn-fields and rafters, and the massacred inhabitants. He
gave graphic delineations of all the writhings and agonies resulting
from the operation of cold steel, lead and fire, upon the human body;
and would conclude a homily upon this subject by a grave proposal
for the restoration of the worship of Molcch.
At last men's eyes were opened, and even the French perceived
War to be a mistake, and laughed at the humbug of “Glory.” The

CARE-WNORN
Punch, in a recent number, gave a case which came before him in
his own police-court, of literary mendicancy. Since then, Punch has
made a discovery. His readers, no doubt, remember a weather-
beaten tar, who was wont to carry the model of a ship upon his hat,
making the said ship an adjunct to his begging. He would point to
the ship, and then ask for a penny. This man, it is now evident, was
Edwand West, the “Secretary” to the “Shipwrecked Fishermen
and Mariners' Benevolent Society, 26, Bucklersbury, London.” The
proof is before us. For we have a prospectus of that institution
forwarded to us by post; forwarded in an envelope, in which is
printed (of course, on the Secretary's own account) a short and touching
advertisement of his own periodical, “published weekly, price 30. "
There is in this so fine a combination of business and benevolence,
that we beg to especially recommend Mr. Edward West to the
further consideration of the President and Vice-Presidents of the
Society, who, of course, in the literary mendicancy pursued by their
officer, have granted to him the use of their vessel. The Chronicles
of the Care-worn are, doubtless, vended under the permittal flag of
“Admiral the Right Honourable Sir George Cockburn, G.C.B., M.P.”
An Act to Perpetuate Testimony in all Cases.

evidence of certain facts, to communicate such facts to Widdicomb, and
that Widdicomb shall be bound to give evidence, however remote the

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAP. XVIII.-A HUSBAND’S WRONGS.—A LISTENER.—AN ATTACK.-
TRiuMph OF COLOURS.
AND still did Madame Spanneu exercise her voice to her husband's
fiddle, albeit little mollified by the conjugal cat-gut. Orpheus—it is
a trite tale—tamed wild-cats and lionesses by the magic of the
gamut. Monsieur Julien Spanneu was not an Orpheus; neither was
his beautiful Eliza a lioness: hence, the discord and the music con-
tinued for some minutes, and threatened to endure, when the maid
jigged into the room, and announced the name of Mr. Curlwell. At
the sound, Mrs. Gaptooth observed in a confidential voice to Madame
Spanneu, “From my lord, I’m bound for him,” and hastened away to
seek the valet. “Come for Lady Dinah's dog, I’ll be sworn,” cried
Madame Spanneu, with a fiery glance at her husband, “and you're
never in a state to see anybody. How the man sits Why don't
you run and clean yourself, you outlandish savage f"
“Ma belle Elise,” cried the Frenchman, sitting cross-legged before
me, with a shuddering dread of my discovery.
“Why don't you get up tº shrieked the wife.
Monsieur Spanneu affected a sudden spasm—worked his nether
jaw—moped and mowed like a monkey, and then ventured to ask his
wife if she had no sentiment
“Sentiment l” echoed the beautiful Eliza, as though insulted.
“Mon ange, I am sick—malade—horriblement malade. Allez—cherchez
du cognac—Oh if you have religion, get brandy;” and the Frenchman
ground his teeth, and, rocking from side to side, with both his arms
hugged his abdomen.
“Brandy 1" exclaimed the wife, with mixed contempt and deri-
sion at the extravagance of the sick man, and was about to leave the
room. This was precisely what the husband required; he therefore
sought to hurry her with sweetest phrase. “Ha! C'est bien, ma vie—
mon trésor—mon âme.” Then, seeing his wife suddenly fixed, he roared
—“Get brandy, or I will die—I tell you, belle Elise, I will die.”
“Do you promise t” inquired the wife, with evident interest in the
question; and then, with a laugh, she swept away from the moribund
man. For an instant the sufferer sat listening to the footsteps of
his spouse descending the stairs, and then he jumped up, and pluck-
ing me, rumpled and disordered, from beneath the chair—cried
* Ha 1 si cette diablesse cous await cue f" Saying this, he rapidly but-
toned me under his waistcoat, and again fell in the chair—again sick,
expiring for the life-bestowing brandy. He listened, but there was
no wife hurrying back with the restorative anodyne. Yet, certainly,
she would come—yes, she would never let him expire. That was
her rushing step. No ; it was the cat at romps. Had he not pro-
mised to die if brandy came not? Still silence It was plain the
wretched woman wished to try if he would keep his word. Smitten
with a sense of this truth, the mournful spouse rose from his chair,
and drawing forth his handkerchief, was about to use it in search of
a tear of wounded sensibility, a tear that might be in his eye. He
hesitated, and the majesty of an offended husband coming to his aid,
he exclaimed—I cannot for a certainty say what, but sure I am it
was not “Ange.” Whatever it was, the word by its energy seemed
to carry the man from the room, and he ran muttering down stairs,
carrying me as his bosom companion on the way.
I verily believe that Monsieur Spanneu, having descended his own
staircase, was about to enter his own parlour; he, however, brought
himself dead up at the door. I heard voices within ; so, it was plain,
did Monsieur Spanneu, for after pausing a minute, his heart com-
mencing a hurried beat, he bent his ear close to the keyhole. I must
confess that, for a moment I wished I could have been turned into a
living hedgehog, that I might have inflicted on the bosom of the
offender a thousand pricking reproofs of the meanness of the act. I
could have curled and twisted like a snake with very indignation, as
the Frenchman, grasping the handle of the door, seemed as he would
screw the entire of his ear into the compass of the keyhole. How,
at first, he shook and quivered at the voices within—and then, with
an attempt at calmness, he set his teeth and slightly grunted as he
listened. Nevertheless, with all his industry and quickness of ear,
Monsieur Spanneu was only enabled to catch half-sentences; these
he pieced together, making thereof a terrible scourge by the very
ingenuity of his ignorance. I, having the acute organisation of a bird,
could recognise sounds of softest volume, and was, therefore, exces-
sively amused at the jealousy which Monsieur gathered from the
mere fragments he was enabled to gather together.
Requesting that the printer will set in different letters—will, if I
may use the conceit, put certain words in a whisper—I will endea-
Yºur to show what Monsieur Spanneu heard, and what escaped him.
The proverb that “listeners hear no good of themselves,” is evidently
worked out in this way: the good, if ever spoken, is spoken in so
weak a voice that it falls dead ere it arrives at the keyhole. This
was doubtless the case with Monsieur Spanneu.
“I never thought that his lordship could have so liked that Madame
Spanneu,”—here begins the inaudible type, for words inaudible to the
husband-(“to know all about her ladyship.”)
“But, bless you, he so loves her—so doats upon her; (and as Lady
Willowby has a fine fortune, perhaps she deserves it.)”
The first voice I immediately recognised as the silvery property of
Mrs. Gaptooth; the second as the masculine organ appertaining to
the valet Curlwell.
º Well, there's no accounting for love, to be sure; and so his lord-
ship comes here for a dog to show his love 1 Mrs. Spanneu tells me
everything! La how she grins at her husband—(though, do you know,
I think she doats upon him aſterall.”) Here the gentlewoman laughed; not
so Monsieur Spanneu ; for his rage rising, his knees began to knock
against the pannel of the door. Every moment I expected to hear a
voice from the room cry, “Come in.” The speakers were, however,
too much interested to take heed of a light disturbance, so the half.
lost dialogue, to the further misery of Monsieur Spanneu, went on.
(“I must say, his lordship takes a great deal of trouble about pleasing her
ladyship.) Why doesn't he run off with the woman at once 1"
“Why not? I’m sure she'd jump to have him : (and as for buying
dogs, and all such fal-lals—it's child's-work, Mr. Curlwell; it is, indeed.”)
Here, again, Mrs. Gaptooth laughed; and again the knees of Mon-
sieur Spanneu smote the pannel. Almost breathless, the forlorn,
self-tormenting husband again essayed to listen, yet heard but frag-
ments. Thus the dialogue was continued.
(“But about that gal, Mr. Curlwell ? If his lordship, as you say, is
really in love with the widow, why should he care for that gal? You don't
know the trouble she's given me.”)
(“You’re an ercellent woman, Mrs. Gaptooth, and I scorn to deceive you.)
I've only used his lordship, as his lordship's used the dog—as a sort of
blind. (He cares nothing for the feather-dresser; he's never seen her.) It's
I as loves her,” answered Curlwell, and Monsieur Spanneu gasped
again.
“Impossible !” cried Mrs. Gaptooth.
“Not that I can say, love; but you know what I mean. I don't
know how it is—but I—I will have her, and there's an end of it,”
cried the valet.
“Sacre f * groaned Monsieur Spanneu.
“Well, I like a man of spirit,” said Mrs. Gaptooth. (“I’m sure
I've done all I could to rummage her out. She went from her last lodgings,
nobody knows where. There was a talk about an old apothecary; but I
belºve nothing about it.) And now, Mr. Curlwell, why should you
deceive an old friend ? Why should you tell me it was his lordship
as loved the woman, and not your proper self?”
“Good reasons, Mrs. Gaptooth; the world isn't what it ought to
be, or I should have as much money as them as carry their heads
among the highest. It's a wicked world for poor men, m'em,” said
the valet with a sigh.
“Well, well, the world's not so bad, after all,” said the 'philoso-
phic matron; “we may know a worse.”
“Je l'espère,” muttered Monsieur between his teeth, and again
with gaping ear he listened.
“But you're rich enough for her,” cried Mrs. Gaptooth, “and it
sha'n't be my fault if you don't make her a happy cretur.”
“I will, Mrs. Gaptooth—I will, as I'm a man,” exclaimed the
valet with energy.
Here Monsieur Spanneu with a sudden roar burst into the room.
He uttered no syllable, but with a spring brought himself to the fire-
place, to his own sacred hearth—and caught up the poker which,
except himself—for at that moment he had dreadful thoughts of his
wife—was its brightest ornament.
Mrs. Gaptooth, being a woman, slightly screamed. Mr. Curlwell in
short spasmodic sentences exclaimed—“Hallo l—The man mad?—
Murder to be done —Blood to be shed 1 Brains to be knocked out !
Killed like a dog 1"—And uttered other household expressions of
household alarm. Monsieur Spanneu felt too much to speak. “His
voice was in—the poker.” Seizing that weapon—(we have often
thought that marriage contracts will never be complete until it be
part of the marriage-law that shovel, tongs, and poker be all and
severally fastened by a certain length of chain to the fire-place)—
he commenced an attack upon the valet, who shaking many years from
his heels, ran round and round a table, the injured husband—like
Othello, injured only by false suspicion—following him. Mrs. Gap-
tooth, selecting the easy-chair, sank in it, evidently prepared at any
No. 97.

moment to faint. Still did Curlwell describe the circle of Monsieur
Spanneu's mahogany, which was happily of sufficient area to protect
the valet from the avenging iron of the short and corpulent French-
man, who, nathless, ran round and round, making at times the hardest
blows upon his own hospitable table, blows inhospitably intended for
the brain-pan of his guest.
However, mortal breath could not long sustain the trial, and at
length Monsieur Spanneu, gasping again and shaking his head at
his imagined wronger, dropped the poker despairingly upon the
table. At the same moment, Curlwell paused, and with his knuckles
resting upon the same piece of household utility, took wind.
There they stood, panting at one another, like two dogs in July on
the opposite sides of a ditch. Seeing them powerless for any mischief,
Mrs. Gaptooth then felt it her duty as a woman and a Christian—as
she afterwards said to Madame Spanneu-to scream the roof off.
Down rushed Madame Spanneu, in full dress. She had, in truth,
retired to her chamber to decorate herself for an audience with Mr.
Curlwell; and not, as her husband foolishly imagined, pour chercher
du cognac."
Strange, mysterious are the movements of the human soul :
Arguing from common examples, does not the reader imagine that
the very sight of his wife at such a moment would have been as oil
to the Frenchman's jealous flames It was otherwise. For in an
instant, Monsieur Spanneu, crying, “Mabelle Elise 1 Mon ange 1 Mon
âme!” locked his helpmate in his arms.
Now Madame Spanneu was dressed in a blue lutestring, with white
satin. “Had it been any other colour,” Monsieur afterwards declared,
“he would have cast de traitresse avay—for ever avay; but dat gown
was his weakness. He could not tink to lose her ven in de vite and
blue !”
In a word, the Frenchman struck to his wife's colours.
MR. ROEBUCK'S SILK GOWN.
Considen ABLE sensation has been excited in Westminster Hall by the
bestowal of a silk gown on Mr. Roebuck. The following are a few speci-
mens of the forensic wit which the subject has elicited. It should,
perhaps, be premised that the silk gown aforesaid has been given for
the part he has taken in the extraordinary political pirouette which has
recently been achieved by Lord Brougham.
EPIGRAM.
In Roebuck's briefless brief career
'Tis said no reason doth appear
Why a silk gown be given to one
Who has so very little done.
Though his attendance in the Court
Has been particularly short,
He's been just long enough 'tis found
To give him time for turning round !
Likely to TuRN out well.
It is said that Mr. Roebuck's silk gown will be very useful to the
learned gentleman as a domino when attending a masquerade or fancy-
ball, for a legal costume is one in which it would be quite impossible for
even his most intimate friends to recognise him.
On inquiry, it has been found that the only motion of Mr. Roebuck
during his professional career has been his recent move from Radicalism
to Toryism, which in the case of red-hot patriots may be considered as
almost a motion of course.
It is whispered that a silk gown has been given to Mr. Roebuck because
everybody has grown thoroughly tired of his stuff.

THE prizes were distributed with great solemnity a few days ago, when
womebody got the medical scholarship of 40l. a-year, which lasts for a few
weeks, when it is transferred to some other competitor.
An immense quantity of certificates of honours were given, and the
fortunate winners received a printed sheet of paper, as the reward of
merit.
Mr. Simper, who had sat up six successive nights with a daisy-root,
obtained the medal plated, upon German silver, for his proficiency in
Botany.
The other prizes consisted of books, of which four volumes were dis.
tributed among three thousand competitors.
ASSUMPTION OF AIRISTOCRACY.
§§
* Give that cARD To Your MastER, AND say A GENTLEMAN wants to ser him.”
It has been thought that the recent peerage case is without a parallel,
but we have heard of one, which, in its principal features, greatly
resembles it.
Our readers are doubtless familiar with the existence of a very ancient
barony. We allude to that of Nathan ; and we are furthermore in a
position to state that the title is about to be sifted, with a view to ascer-
tain the present possessor's right to the enjoyment of it. It will, we
understand, be shown by witnesses on the one side, that an individual
calling himself simply Mr. Nathan, landed at Margate in the summer of
1834, and that in 1835 the same person returned with the addition of
Baron to his name. He was then called Mr. Baron Nathan ; but in 1836
he dropped the Mister, and boldly announced himself as Barºn Nathan at
Tivoli, where he not only danced a hornpipe among four-and twenty eggs,
but performed other feats of a similarly exalted nature.
It will also be shown that when called by the name of Mr. Baron
Nathan, he would say, “Drop the Mister, and call me simple Baron ;”
which was accordingly done by those persons with whom he associated.
On the other hand, there will be witnesses, on the side of the claimant,
to show that he was always received as Baron Nathan in public. That
when he came forward at Tivoli, to go through the ceremonies among the
eggs, he was greeted with loud shouts of “Bravo, Nathan ;” and, some-
times, “Bravo, Baron Nathan ;” or, “Go it, Baron ;” but never was
accosted with “Bravo, Mister Nathan ;” and, in fact, that no one ever
thought of using the word “Mister” at all in reference to one who was
recognised as the “Baron,” and treated accordingly. It will be proved
also that Baron Nathan always exacted feudal service from the waiters at
Tivoli, and that when he employed an assistant, the latter always swore
fealty to the Baron at the point of the fiddlestick. . . It will be shown also
that when giving lessons in the capacity of Lord of Everybody's Manners
in Kennington, he was always attended by an esquire, who used to chalk
the baronial pumps, and put the resin on the baronial fiddle-strings. The
case will come on for argument in due course. His claims to the title of
Prince Cracovienne, in Poland, has been petitioned against by Prince, the
huiliste, of Poland-street.
THE GRATUITOUS EXHIBITIONS OF LONDON.
No. III.--THE MENAGERIE IN FRONT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY.
It is much to be regretted that, whilst the poorest classes in Paris
can visit the splendid collection of animals in the Jardin des Plantes
for nothing, the same orders in London have but limited means of
studying natural history devoid of expense. It may be, in some cases,
that they have not availed themselves of the opportunities afforded
them ; for whilst we are well aware, upon popular authority, that
the Lions at the Tower are publicly washed every 1st of April, very
few persons appear, in reality, to have attended this interesting
spectacle. It is true that, now and then, a view may be obtained of
the bears and monkeys in the Regent's Park—we mean the bond fide

animals—when they are at the tops of their poles, by climbing up
the fence when nobody is looking, but this is transient and unsatis-
factory. And at the Surrey Zoological Gardens even this chance is
cut off. We have often tried to see something, despite of the tenter-
hooks on the palings and the people on the path, but could never
discern anything beyond the dome of St. Peter's and part of the
castle of St. Angelo. A little boy once informed us, that, by going a
long way round, and crossing a forbidden enclosure, a surreptitious
view might be obtained of some old cages and the back of the Alpine
dog-kennel, but we can only state this upon hearsay. We have
never, yet made the attempt, although one of these fine days we
intend so doing.
Looking to these facts, every well-regulated mind must have
hailed the first appearance of the interesting collection we are about
to notice. It first made its appearance some years back in the
Waterloo Bridge-road, and perhaps at that time ought not to have
been classed amongst the exhibitions strictly gratuitous, inasmuch
as to those living on the northern shores of the Thames, the outlay
of one halfpenny was absolutely imperative before they could arrive
at it from the Strand, unless the somewhat circuitous route of Fleet-
street, Blackfriars' Bridge, and Stamford-street, was preferred to
the nearer and dearer one. And even in its present situation, when
the visitor has arrived at the desired spot, he may be drawn into
incurring further expense by the solicitations of the showman, unless
he keeps his senses on the alert, and dodges him round the menagerie,
always contriving to put the collection between himself and the pro-
prietor, when he will be enabled to see a great deal, free of any cost.
The menagerie is situated at the edge of the pavement
in front of the National Gallery—another gratuitous ex-
hibition on a largescale, which has however been described
several times in different works. It can be approached
either from the east or from the west, but towards the
south a large parallelogram of ground is inclosed by the
supporters of another gratuitous exhibition of equal in-
terest,-the “Society for the out-of-door display of Theatri-
cal Cartoons,” which are thrown open to public view in
direct opposition to the Royal Academy. Permission
to exhibit a design is readily obtained by payment of a
small sum to any respectable bill-sticker who may belong
to the hanging committee thereof. In the interior of
the square, an ingenious workman has been for some time
erecting what is apparently a very tall stone chimney, and
his solitary perseverance has gained him the admiration
of all who have been acquainted with him since he com-
menced his labours, which is now some time back.
What else goes on within this large enclosure is not
popularly understood, being known only to the cabmen
on each side, who, when elevated on their boxes are
enabled to look over the palings; but they appear averse
to giving any decided information upon the subject. We
believe, however, that the greater part of it will be ap-
propriated to the terminus of the Aerial Ship; and that
what remains of the area will be planted as a tea-garden
and skittle-ground for the recreation of members of the
College of Physicians during the reading of any long
paper.
The menagerie may be likened in form to a wire safe upon
wheels, with its various contents animated, and accompanied, as
the contents of safes generally are, by mice and rats. It is not
advisable to walk up to it at once without there are other spectators,
because, under those circumstances, you cannot get off very well
without paying ; but when three or four persons are assembled about
it, you may approach without fear of expense.
The inmates of this menagerie are rather more remarkable for
harmony than rarity, chiefly consisting of cats, pigeons, mice, owls,
rabbits, rats, and small birds, which awaken the most interesting
associations,—some of pies, others of curries, and the remainder of
guns, mouse-traps, and sudden deaths. If imprisonment be con-
sidered a state of misery, we can see how misery makes us acquainted
with strange bed-fellows in all the inmates of this menagerie, with
the exception of a blinking old cat much inclined to drowsiness, who
is allowed to go out upon parole on the top of the cage. The only
member of this establishment who does not appear to enter into the
general hilarity, is a sedate old owl, constantly upon one of the upper
perches. IIe is evidently of retiring habits, and has the air of a
gentleman imprisoned for debt, who does not choose to associate with
his companions. In consequence of this, a number of upstart young
birds are constantly playing off practical jokes upon him. There are
two rats also, peculiarly indolent, and averse to moving about, which
they never do until stirred up with a lath, poked between the wires
by the keeper of the establishment.
The proprietor has named his collection “The Happy Family,”
and is perpetually speaking of his having had the honour of exhi-
biting his menagerie before Her Most Gracious Majesty. This first
turned the public attention to his exhibition, and now it is regarded
as the stepping-stone to very important results. Firstly, that by
intermingling the breed it is possible he may be able to rear some
flying cats, who would be most useful in protecting buds and newly
sown seed from birds, presuming always that their natural habits are
left unchanged : secondly, that this scheme might be carried out to
horses, who, being provided with wings, would soon cut out all the
aerial machines in the manner of Pegasus of old. And thirdly, that
by associating such opposite natures together, his secret may be

carried into domestic life, so that wives may live upon friendly terms
with their husbands' sisters, mothers-in-law with grown-up daughters,
and governesses be treated with becoming courtesy by the servants,
(such as the rats in the show exhibit to the ringdoves,) when all
living in the same house.
The possibility of these plans being brought to perfection renders
the establishment well worthy of a visit from all lovers of social
institutions.

JENKINS ON “ SOCIETY.”
===Tºr
r—-
Homer sometimes donned a nightcap—JENKINs has, of late, slept
a little. Envy and malice have hinted that JENKINs has written
himself out: this we do not believe. Nevertheless, the Morning Post
has of late been dull as a dowager in her first mourning. On Monday,
however, JENK1Ns showed signs of returning consciousness; for he
wrote as follows:—
“There was in the refined audience which assembled at the Opera on Saturday night a
palpable increase of spirit and of inclination for the appreciation of the sources of plea-
sure. This animation confers a most essential charm on the réunions at Her Majesty's
Theatre—and on this occasion it was no doubt due to the improved prospects of
society.”
This is tolerable; but still, very far below JENKINs at Jenkins'
best. He very properly looks upon the condition of Opera boxes as
the barometer of “society.” If Duchesses turn out in their best
diamonds and sweetest smiles, why, the weavers must be doing
better at Bolton and Paisley : if Marquesses rush to Gazza Ladru, the
agricultural interest must be looking up. There is true philosophy
in this; albeit above the apprehension of common minds. But then
JENKINs' is deep as his tailor's thimble—as deep, and as bottomless |
33rtípt to make a “$2apoleon.”
TAKE an English Baron, with a curly head of hair. Let him have a
most invincible opinion of his own powers, over which sprinkle a few
handsful of arrogance and self-sufficiency; mix and stir well together.
Then let him be taken to Leadenhall-street, to simmer over a gentle
fire of eloquence. That done, let him be carefully shipped to India
with a copy of Buonaparte's Despatches en papillote. Arrived in India,
let him get by heart the highest phrases out of Ossian, which he is to
write and talk on all occasions, seasoning his discourse and compo-
sitions with “insults of 800 years”—“cities looking down upon
despoiled tombs”—“swords of deliverers,” and such other spices and
condiments. When he is fully stuffed with this stuffing, serve with
his “arms folded,”—in a word, trussed a l'empereur. Garnish with
cocked hat with gold binding—a coat with breast and tail worked
with gold—and inexpressibles “to follow,” trimmed with the same
material. In default of brains, add plenty of sweet-sauce for General

that mournful creed. Sir Peter, sitting in the chair of authority, and
holding the balance of Justice—(if Justice, like a romping wench at
blind-man's-buff, could now and then slip the bandage from either
eye, how she would giggle at her scale-holders 1)—has declared it
impossible for a thief, let him be a thief in callow childhood, ever
to grow into a true man. No : the thread of his boyhood will but
thicken into a halter; the chain of his being must be the chain of
Newgate. The infantine scoundrel who puts his unlawful thumb and
finger into a sugar-basin is a BARRING Ton in the bud. Master

LAURIE “never knew a convicted thief become a reformed man,”
and upon this knowledge, knowing SIR PETER a few days since, com-
mitted a boy to Newgate (albeit his first offence) and despite the
entreaties and charitable offers of the prosecutor. But then Sin
PETER knew the wickedness of the human animal : he is an alder-
man, and could not help knowing it.
Reader, did you ever see a monkey with a watch Not Well,
then, we will find some sport for you. There is that old shagreen
thing, cast by in your desk-drawer. 'Tis fit for nothing but an expe-
riment. So put it in your pocket; and one of these fine May-days
walk to Mr. CRoss's Zoological Gardens, and forthwith betake your-
self to the monkey-house, or rather go to any single monkey—there
are a dozen chained to as many poles about the grounds—and having
selected your monkey for the smirk and self-satisfied snigger that
may animate his countenance—pull from your fob your old shagreen
time-keeper, and straightway present it to the monkey of your choice.
The animal takes the watch, and ere you can wink, he has climbed
with it to the top of his pole. He is in the height of place, about to
contemplate the works of your shagreen dial. Do you mark his
gravity See with what “lack-lustre eye” he gazes on the hour-plate

clever monkey –he has, either by sagacity or accident, opened the

upward at that monkey in his pride of eminence 1 Look, sir, look.

innocence of childhood, long ere, by virtue of your wisdom, you could

an apple—a peach—a melon—an apricot No : of course not. You

Did you never rob your mother's meal-bag Did your childhood's

wickedness be the right one—we had lost an alderman in a-a-but

dark belief of LAURIE. Yet, stay ; we see the light of hope glimmer
through a crack, a pin-hole, in PETER’s philosophy. A “convicted”
thief is lost—but the thieves who are not discovered—the thieves
“wanting the accomplishment” of conviction, may flourish to any
height and value. “”Tis marriage makes the blemish,” cries Mother
Peachem; “”Tis conviction is the blot,” says PETER. Between the
rogue convicted and the rogue undiscovered, great is the difference;
so great, indeed, that it often involves the very best emoluments and
the very highest places.
Our Solo Mon, however, is not only great upon the effect of

Had the woman (for it was plain she was in earnest) recollected Sir
PETER LAURIE, the recollection would have made her infinitely more
painstaking, more prudent in her means of self-destruction. With
the shame of Newgate before her, there would have been more
“method in her madness.” Therefore LAU are preaches to all
suicides these words : “Take especial care that you choose a dark
night and a lonely spot for self-murder; make death certain ; for if in
the wretchedness and amazement of your souls you so bungle that
you are saved from the grave, why, then there's Newgate for you !”

hadji heer TO HADJI THAIR.
London, A. H. 1222.
FRIEND of my soul, the first letter, wherein I poured out to thee the
raptures of my heart, was translated into the English tongue by the
Dragoman of one Punch, a holy man of small stature, who teacheth the
people wisdom from a pulpit, which his Imaums erect in the corners of
the streets, and who every week setteth forth on a scroll, in a pleasant
style, such truths as the unenlightened Giaours are able to bear. The
translation he hath inserted in his scroll, so that if any accident should
prevent the letter reaching thee, thou wilt find it in the scroll, which is
read in all parts of the world, particularly at our beloved Constantinople.
* Thrns is a TIE THAT simps us to our homes.”
At first I was sorry to find that the infidels, when they read the trans-

lation of my letter, put on it so perverse a meaning, that they thought the
Imaum Big-Phul merely signified “big fool,” which signifieth in their
language, one whose brain Allah hath not enlightened. The night-traveller
doth not shrink with more horror from the ravenous Goule, than I shrink
from this profane interpretation ; but a second visit to the Hop-Rah hath
convinced me, that the Giaours were not so far wrong, and that the
Imaum is not such a light of the faithful as we have considered, but hath
grievously, misled both thee and me, O friend of my youth For the
Imaum Big-Phul instructed us that the paradise of the faithful was
perfect, and was no more susceptible of improvement than the sword of
the Prophet. But this is false, O Hadji; for the Paradise which I saw
on my second visit to the Hop-Rah surpassed that which I before told thee
of, as the song of Hafiz surpasseth that of Yezid, the son of Moawiyah.
The Houri Doom-y-lateer hath left Paradise, and the Imaum Lomli i.
put in her stead another Houri, whom they call Chairee toh. O Hadji,
to this Houri are all other Houris but vanity and delusion; not Zuleika,
who tried to lure the young Yusuf from the paths of wisdom, of whom
Hafiz hath so often sung, may be compared to the new Houri. She doth
not look as a passing cloud, lightly floating before the west-wind, as did
the Houri Doom y-lateer; she doth not appear as one of the dreams, with
which Eblis often tantalizeth even the Faithful ; but she is a reality
of perfection. The first tint of the morning sun doth not beam
more softly on the mountain-tops than do the eyes of Chai-ree-toh
on the faithful youth who supporteth her, and the eagle doth not dart
more swiftly on his prey, than doth the new Houri amid the clouds of
Paradise. Yea, O Hadji, the new Houri not only danceth, but, by
the beard of my father, she can fly, and without wings. Mighty is the
power of Chai-ree-toh The rush of the torrent is strong, when it
sweepeth down the trees and the hut of the shepherd, the bound of the
young lion is strong, when he seizeth on the traveller; but, oh, their
might is as nothing to the might of Chai-ree-toh Yet doth not fierceness
dwell within her heart, for she useth her might as it were a pleasant sport,
and boundeth along, laughing lightly, and rejoicing in her own wonder.
And when she resteth she smileth on the guests, and their hearts beat
lightly within their bosoms, for the soft breath of the west-wind doth not
diffuse such joy, as the smile of Chai-ree-toh.
Friend of my youth, tell the Imaum Big-Phul how well I employ
my time, while in this infidel town, and pray enlighten him in the point
of doctrine to which I have alluded, that he may not mislead the sons of
Islam. And show him the enclosed Ghazul. which I have writ in the
Persian tongue. Ever yours,

to the houri chai-REE-toh.
Fair as the moon, when on tall cedar-trees brightly gleaming,
Houri, art thou, when upon mortals so gladly beaming.
When the seba” stirs thy locks, Houri, they are more fragrant
Than the young rose, or the musk, which with its sweets is teeming. .
No ; not the rays, by Zahraht cast from the skies of evening
Are as the light from the black eyes of the Houri streaming.
And when she smiles, on her lips joys without end are dwelling ;
Joys which sne sheds on the § and the Giaour blaspheming.
Sunn'd by thy smile, Houri fair, oh! I would live for ever,
For I should feel life was past, Paradise present seeming.
Sorrows and cares, haste away, quick, to the halls of Eblis;
Haste where the Goule foully dwells, where evil Djins are screaming.
Heret would I bask, free from care, gazing upon the Houri,
And when I leave, still would I be of the Houri dreaming.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Qſht 33rmp-a-3Limers' jumb Binntr.
Ew persons are aware of the existence of a Society for
the relief of distressed Penny-a-liners. The entrance
fee is half-a-crown, and the subscription sixpence a
month, entitling the member to come upon the fund
at once, but as all the Penny-a-liners are always
in distress, the claims upon the fund are consider-
ably greater than the assets. A subscription of ten
j makes anybody a director, and half-a-crown
paid in a single sum, constitutes the party a life-
governor, while three distinct payments of a shilling
each entitle one to the rank of vice-president. The
concerns of the society are managed by a committee,
who have the control of everything but the funds, which are deposited in
the Bank of Elegance.
The annual dinner—an event that is really entitled to the epithet
annual, as far as some of the members are concerned-came off last week,
when the chair was taken by Jenkins. He was supported on the right by
an opera check-taker, and on the left by nobody—so that the arrangement
was somewhat uniform. The banquet embraced all the delicacies of the
season. At the top of the table, where Jenkins sat, was calves' head, and
at the other end was embarras Irlandais (Irish-stew), while a large dish
of globule d'eau et cri percant (bubble-and-squeak) occupied the centre.
After the more substantial viands had been disposed of, a lapin gallois
(welsh rabbit) was placed upon the table, and the cheese and onions
having been removed, the following toasts, &c., were given :-
“Jenkins, and the Footmen of London.”
Air.—“A man's a man for a' that.”
* Lord William Lennox and the Novelists.”
Air.—“Lo so gently stealing.”
“Punch and the Philosophers.”
Solo.—Penny Trumpet.
“Mr. West and the Chroniclers.”
Recitation.—“The Beggar's Petition.”
“Mr. Dibdin Pitt and the Dramatists.”
Air—“The Laughing Chorus.”
After the above toasts had been drunk with enthusiasm, the following
subscriptions were announced :-
Jenkins, a bill for one pound, in renewal of the promissory note given
for his last year's subscription, and a cognovit for a farther sum of ten
shillings (Frantic cheering).
Lord William Lennox, five shillings, being ten per cent. on the produce
of his last new novel, as per invoice, copied from the waste-paper account
of his lordship's butterman.
-The proprietors of the Morning Post one shilling, being a fine of one
twentieth part, stopped last week, on account of negligence, from Jenkins'
salary. (Great sensation).
A plate was then handed round, containing the amounts we have
described ; but the company, instead of adding to, managed to diminish it,
one person having put in a shilling and taken out half-a-crown, by way of
change, while other tricks were played of a similar character.
These results having been ascertained, and the whole of the plate care-
fully counted over by the landlord of the tavern, the door was opened to
admit of the egress of the company.
DISPUTED TITLES.
the subject of titles, and, among others, we understand that an inquiry
will be instituted as to the highly respectable Barony of Kennington, in
Middlesex, which has been enjoyed hitherto undisturbed by a Terpsi-
chorean family of immense celebrity. The Kennington Barons, like the
Nova Scotia Baronets, are not very ancient, but belong decidedly to the
middle ages; or, they may, perhaps, be dated a little on the other
side of it.
PUNCH'S LABOURS OF HERCULES.
CHAPTER II.--THE SECOND LABOUR.—HOW HERCULES DESTROYED A
CERTAIN TERRIBLE HYDRA.
Eveny schoolboy knows that Hercules, before he went to Heaven,
smote and slew a frightful monster, denominated the Lernaean Hydra.
This Hydra was an enormous reptile of a species now happily extinct.
The researches of the most diligent naturalists have as yet failed to
discover an individual of the serpent or of the lizard tribes rejoicing
in the possession of more than a single head, though perhaps a
dicephalous alligator may be found one of these days in Kentucky.
But the Hydra, according to the most moderate computation, had
seven heads; while another account gives it fifty; and a third, just
as likely to be correct as either of the other two, a hundred. On one
of these heads being cut off, two more sprang up in its place; and
very likely it was from suffering frequent decapitation at the hands
of heroes, that the creature, endowed with seven heads to begin with,
came to have a hundred in the end. The above facts, and the cir-
cumstance that the Lernaean Hydra was a very poisonous and
rapacious vermin, and as such had made itself highly obnoxious to
the neighbourhood, are all that we know about its natural history. We
read, however, that it was the offspring of one Echidna, a she-dragon
or griffin, by Typhon, who was the Evil Principle. This is an
important point, and the reader, it is hoped, will duly bear it in mind.
Now, the Lernaean Hydra, it would seem, had a sort of soul, which
of course our hero was unable to smash. This soul underwent a long
series of transmigrations, inhabiting successively the bodies of various
wolves, hyaenas, sharks, crocodiles, rattle-snakes and boa-constrictors,
till at last it again animated a frame like its original tenement, which,
ampler details having been handed down to us concerning it, we are
enabled more fully to describe.
This modern Hydra was a gigantic monster, like unto a winged
serpent as to its body, and having large and powerful claws or
talons, which, whenever they once got prey into their clutches, were
never known to let it go. It had heads almost innumerable, which
were continually increasing from day to day. These heads were as
the heads of men, and upon them were gray wigs which resembled
wigs of horse-hair. Of the wigs, some were short and close-cropped,
with a few stiff rolls of curls at their sides and back, wherefrom also
depended certain tails which were called pig-tails; others were long
and flowing, with great luxuriant curls like those which ascend from
the bowl of a tobacco-pipe. In the mouth of each head were fangs
as of adders, and likewise double tongues. These tongues possessed
the faculty of speech, which they employed after the manner of the
first speaking serpent on record, namely, to cajole and deceive, which
objects they accomplished by two arts now lost to the world, but
whose revival is scarcely to be wished for:—Sophistry and Humbug.
By Sophistry they enlisted the intellect, by Humbug the pas-
sions, of their hearers against the truth. The said tongues, more-
over, were endowed with another power, which they would very
frequently exercise, that of overbearing, confounding and bullying ;
however, being very glib and oily, they were quite able to flatter and
speak fair on occasion.
Some of the tongues of this Hydra possessed the privilege of slaying
with a word. The heads which they resided in were those with the
huge curly wigs; and when they were about to be thus fatally em-
ployed, the big wig was surmounted by a cap of black velvet, very
awful to behold.
Among the Hydra's heads there were not a few which had no wigs
at all ; their faces were as the faces of foxes, very cunning-looking
and sly. By contemporaneous writers they are said to have had a
six-and-eightpenny expression of countenance, a phrase the meaning
of which is, in the present day, somewhat obscure.
The evil and mischief which this monster had occasioned in his
time are almost incredible. His worst quality was, that he was ever
a willing tool in the hands of any one who would feed and stuff him,
and enable him to batten on the garbage of Mammon. He would
allow himself to be hounded on anybody, no matter whom, for a
consideration. If a rich man wanted to dispossess a poor one of his
little all, there was this Hydra ever to be hired for a golden bribe, to
The recent case in the House of Lords has drawn general attention to be let loose, barking with one, two, or more mouths, according to the
reward, at the needy wretch, till at last it drove him off his premises.
Was there a mercenary trull who had inveigled some superannuated
dotard into a promise of marriage the Hydra was at her service to
invoke, by raving, canting, and lying, a mulct of some thousand
guineas on the head of the old man for non-fulfilment of the disgusting
compact. Was a widow or an orphan to be defrauded of their
rights? the Hydra had lynx-like eyes at the command of the wealthy
oppressor to find out flaws in deeds and settlements, whereby to
reduce the poor creatures to beggary. Was a villain, who had cut
his father's throat, to be turned loose on society the Hydra only
needed to be paid to do the job, by discovering that the criminal had
been accused by a name of four letters, whereas it ought to have
been spelt with five. Nor were there wanting to the Hydra heads
that would for a trifle call Heaven to attest their belief in the pri-
soner's innocence; they well knowing him to be guilty all the while.
There was one particular den which was the favourite haunt of this
Hydra, where it was wont to display the most ill-favoured and vil-
lanous of all the heads it bore : these heads were remarkable for
being more particularly foul-mouthed, especially towards each other,
than any of the rest. This den bore the name of Old Bailey.
But the Hydra had been guilty of deeper and more sanguinary
enormities than the above. Not only had it broken innumerable
hearts, and driven countless victims raving mad; but it had strangled

decapitated, ripped up, burnt, broken alive, and destroyed by other
lingering torments, myriads of unfortunate persons, some altogether
innocent, and all, except some few, more sinned against than
sinning.
The name of this Hydra was “The Law ;” it was the offspring of
Neeessity, by Wickedness.
Here now was a monster to be exterminated with all speed ; but
how Hercules might have battered at its several heads to all
eternity; for as in the case of its prototype, as fast as one was knocked
off, others, forth with, shot up, as if by magic, to replace it. He knew,
moreover, that the populace had, at different times, arisen and
trampled this Hydra in the dust; but after having been to all
appearance destroyed and annihilated, its disjointed limbs would

reunite, and it would shortly be resuscitated in more than its former
might. He further perceived, that so long as crime existed, it was a
necessary evil.
So Hercules determined to use his club as a Reform Club—though
not the Club in Pall-Mall—to see if, in a social sense, he could not
beat the knave out of doors. But first he launched a few arrows
from his unerring bow at the monster, whereby he crippled and
enfeebled it, preparatory to knocking it on the heads. These arrows
were anointed with gall, which was of a black, inky nature, and the
wounds which they made stung and rankled exceedingly. And the
unction was in the form of written characters, and those characters
made words, and those words sentences, wherein was the sting of the
arrows.
Various things too numerous to recite were inscribed on the arrows
of Hercules. Among them it was written that he who argued and
employed oratory, being hired, for the purpose of wilful deception,
was a paid liar. That the willing tool of the swindler
and the cheat was a scoundrel. That the person pro-
tracting by technical artifice a lawsuit respecting pro-
perty, in order that he himself might derive the larger
pickings from the same, was a legal pickpocket. That
the abettor of a murderer, whether wearing a wig
and gown, or a smock frock and ankle-jacks, was
an accessory after the fact. The arrows thus
anointed were said to carry “home truths,” and
they did marvellous execution on the body of the
Hydra.
Some arrows bore legends of n seemingly opposite
import. As for instance; “Blessed is the hireling of
the oppressor of the poor.” “To perplex and bother
a witness, with the view of causing him to swear to
an untruth, is an honest thing.” “It is very right
and proper knowingly to garble statements and mis-
represent facts, for so much.” It was also set down
upon these arrows, that under the protection of Court
to insinuate falsehoods, known to be such, against
the character and motives of a plaintiff or defend-
ant was extremely brave and gentleman-like. That
it was noble and high-minded to employridicule against
right, and to excite vulgar prejudices in behalf of
wrong. Some of these sentences were of a slightly
playful character, as that the silk gown of the venal
pleader was by no manner of means a wrap-rascal ;
the point of the arrows thus armed were brighter and
more sparkling than the rest; and these weapons
had a tickling, irritating property, which occasioned
much smarting to the reptile. A few of them were
aimed at the more sensitive part of certain dull per-
sons on whom the Hydra depended for its subsist-
ence ; but who by the tickling of the shafts were
piqued and aroused into reflection. These arrows
insinuated how sensible and creditable it was to be
beguiled into enthusiasm against Justice, by being
addressed as a “British jury,” as “Men, parents,
husbands, Englishmen,” and so forth, by a crafty,
fee-seeking heartless knave; who all the while held
the said British jury, and the men, parents, husbands,
and Englishmen aforesaid, in profound and sovereign
contempt. Other similar hints, equally delectable and
flattering, they likewise bore, and by dint of them
that worthy personage, Mr. John Bull, was edified to
an extent that was surprising.
A due number of volleys of arrows having been
discharged by Hercules, the Hydra was observed to
grow very sick and faint, and to pine exceedingly for
lack of food, which people had begun to take all possi-
ble care to take out of its way. It was obviously in
bad case; and it was evident that a very little would
suffice to settle its business.
Still, however, the demigod left it alone, and pro-
ceeded with his mighty club, and his sharp arrows, to
demolish rascality in all its different varieties; his
achievements forming other adventures which yet re-
main to be recorded. Villany at last was eradicated
from the earth; and the conqueror now advanced to
give his enfeebled enemy, the Hydra, the finishing and
fatal blow. It was needless: the monster had been
starved to death; for roguery is the food of law.
So Hercules had nothing to do but to tuck the crea-
ture up on his club, and to cut a caper of triumph before the people;
even after the fashion of Mr. Punch when he has accomplished
his final victory over the enemy of man.

NOTICES OF EXHIBITIONS.
EARLY the earliest visitor to the Royal Academy,
which opened for the season on the 8th of
May, was Mr. Horatio Trafalgar Sims. He
divided with his portrait (painted by himself)
the attention of the room. The gilt buttons
were pronounced a speaking likeness, and the
drab waistcoat, it was unanimously agreed,
was, for light summer wear, quite a pattern
of perfection. The glowing sunset on the hair
has been admirably kept under, whilst the
masterly way in which the ruby colour at the tip
of the nose has been taken off, excited the surprise of everybody acquainted
Mr. Horatio Trafalgar Sims has expressed his deter-
mination, in case he wins a prize in the Art-Union, of buying his own
picture. No one, we are sure, will censure him (though it is contrary to
the rules of the Society,) for this amiable preference.
Progress of Science and Art.
We have been favoured with a private view of a curious contrivance
for ascertaining the day of the week at all times and seasons. There is a
narrow strip of card, with the initial letters of all the days in the week,
much in the same way as they are represented in common almanacks.
By an ingenious arrangement, this card is made to slide through a hole
in a larger card, which has the days of the month printed on it. Sup-
posing an individual to be in such a blessed state of º as not to
know what is the day of the week, he must ascertain the fact, and having
set the card, he will be enabled to keep in mind what day it is, if he looks
from time to time at the piece of mechanism we have been describing.
We do not know who is the inventor of this ingenious contrivance, but
specimens are being left at people's houses rather freely. In a few days
the specimen is called for again ; and as it has been probably either mis-
laid or torn by the children, it is necessarily paid for. Thus, the projector
obtains the reward of his art as well as his science.
.A. Curious Coincidence.
MR. Punch,-SIR,-You are a close observer of the follies of life, and
of the many strange phenomena that daily present themselves to the “eyes
of the world.” I am, therefore, induced to call upon you for an explana-
tion of the following curious announcement, which, might, could, would,
or should have come under your notice. In the neighbourhood of
St. George's Fields there are several lamp-posts, and on one of these
lamp-posts there is, or was, a placard to this effect:—
“ELECTION FoR CHAMBERLAIN,
“Sir John Pirie's committee will sit here every day !”
I have heard of Patience sitting on a monument, but I never before
knew that it was possible for an election committee to sit on a lamp-post.
Perhaps you can account for this extraordinary event in natural history.
Let me know in your next, and I shall ever subscribe myself your devoted
friend and well-wisher, LYNX.
IBunsen. Once More.
It seems from a Report of the Literary Fund Dinner, that the Che-
valier Bunsen, who, it will be remembered, was in England a year ago
“on a special mission,” is in England still ; from which it would appear
that the purpose of the “special mission” is not yet accomplished." At
the dinner in question, when the King of Prussia's health was drunk,
Bunsen returned thanks, and the vocalists immediately struck up “Lo
here the gentle Lark,” as if the impression was that Bunsen was over here
for “a lark” of a mild and “gentle” character.
More Extravagance.

out to Asia at the Government's expense, to collect marbles. Now is this
not a shameful expenditure of the public money, and a gross neglect of

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
cHAP. XIX.-I AM TAKEN TO A TAVERN.-LEFT IN A HACKNEY-
COACH.
Our last chapter left Madame Spanneu in the arms of her husband.
In less time than a leaf of this small history could be turned, the
lady released herself from that sweet bondage ; and that, too, with a
decision that flung her helpmate, sounding, against the wainscot.
Never did woman more vigorously illustrate the fallacy of that vulgar
saying, that man and wife are of one flesh ; for never was division
more clearly manifested.
“My heart is broke 1” exclaimed Monsieur Spanneu. That his
ribs also were not fractured was a mercy and an astonishment. The
husband looked entreatingly at his wife—there was no responsive
glance—and, in another second, the wretched man had seized his
hat, and stood the statue of despair upon his own door-step !
In that moment, active was the great fiend : for twenty little imps,
the devil's footboys, rose about the Frenchman ; some crying halter
—some poison—some climbing his shoulder, and gently whispering
in his ear, razors; and some again, with a sweet diabolic smirk,
pointing their fingers in the direction of the Thames. Monsieur
Spanneu instantly resolved on death. What place but the grave for
a broken heart? He would die : his only difficulty was the choice
of means. Thus, hanging, poisoning, drowning, abscission of artery
—one and all of these modes recommended themselves ; but their
merits appeared so equal, that the Frenchman was too much puzzled
to choose. He at once broke from the besetting difficulty, by—turn-
ing into an ale-house. Distrusting death, he rushed to drunkenness.
Monsieur Spanneu drowned his reason twenty fathom deep ; but
with wise reservation kept his clayey self safe from the coroner.
Never was the inexperience of man so shockingly displayed; for
almost before Bacchus could have winked, the Frenchman was dis-
astrously drunk. This great evil was attributable to his temperance.
He had never, poor man taught himself the use of the bottle, and,
therefore, the exposure of his ignorance was sudden and complete.
He had been wont to dally with water, qualified with sugar, for
luxurious tippling, and now stood he beside that burning Lethe–gin
Have I not heard the story ! Is it not Esop's The story of a stag,
that drinking at the stream, still murmured at the shadow of its
antlers In like manner did Monsieur Spanneu drink and drink,
yet see nought within his glass but an exaggeration of his wrongs,
wrongs shadowed from false thoughts that thronged his head. Hence,
the Frenchman—the gin distilling from his eyes—would drink and
cry “traitresse,” “cocu"—“cocu,” “traitresse,”—and then, in the very
idleness of despair, sing forth the snatch of some infidel song
defying love, and satirical of wedded truth. Thus, the wretched
husband passed with greatest facility through all the degrees of
drunkenness, until he was in a state of professorial imbecility. He
cried, laughed, raved—became maudlin, and then affectionate with
his own hat, calling it “sa belle Elise,” then dashing it to the end of
the room with new disgust ; and then, some pause allowed, whistling
—or spluttering a whistle at his foot, as throwing it up and down he
swore it was his favourite poodle dancing a jig. At length, passion
would shift no longer; and so, worn out, the poor Frenchman sat in
his chair, a very skin of gin, and snored.
Let it not be thought that Monsieur Spanneu was solus. By no
means. He played his various antics to the rejoicing shout of the
customary visitors of the Horse and Anchor, many of whom wit-
nessed the growing inebriety of a Frenchman with the same zest and
curiosity with which they would have made drunk a monkey, a
dancing bear, or any other animal endowed with certain powers
imitative of some gestures of humanity. These true-hearted Britons
in the pride of patriotism, considered it something like impertinence,
conceit, in a Frenchman to get beastly drunk; it was very like a
liberty in a foreigner. Therefore, they manfully marked their
censure of the circumstance, by filling the offender's pockets with
soot, by blackening his face with the same substance—whilst an
indignant wag smeared the Frenchman's skull with mustard, telling
him, to the screaming enjoyment of the party, that yellow hair
became him beautifully.
These insults the Frenchman felt not—knew not. Gin had done
its best and worst; and he sat, the world spinning with him—the
breathing block of a man. He had, however, paid what was called
his reckoning; and being incapable of swallowing another drop, the
landlord of the IIorse and Anchor—a humane man—thought it best
to have the drunkard carried home; the sot himself having, in his
fiantic cups, published, again and again, the whereabouts of the par-
*
ticular fireside where, in his own tragic words, he had been stabbed
“in de vitals of his peace.” A hackney-coach was called, and the
Frenchman carried by the waiter and boots from the room, the com-
pany therein roaring “Rule Britannia,” as the foreigner was borne
to the vehicle. “All right—you'll know,” said the waiter to the
coachman, the driver being very imperfectly instructed in the
dwelling-place of Monsieur Spanneu. “A Frenchman—you'll find
out,” bawled the waiter from the steps of the tavern, and the coach-
man with, as I thought, a fine faith in the doctrine of chance, per-
suaded by dint of voice and whip, his horses to gather up their legs,
and move funereally on.
How far we went I know not ; but the day was waning, and it grew
darker and darker; and the coachman—strange to say—more and
more impatient. “Is this it !” he would cry, stopping at a house, and
thrusting his head into the coach ; and once or twice Monsieur Span-
neu, deep in his dreams, would answer something which the driver
insisted upon interpreting as a negative, and, therefore, bellowed an
oath—asked himself why foreigners didn't stay in their own country
—whipped his horses anew, and still went on. -
In the course of our journey, the coachman stopt at three houses,
insisting that Monsieur Spanneu was the master of each of them, and
that he had nothing to do, but to get out, undress himself, and go to
bed like a Christian.
My belief is, that Monsieur Spanneu had every desire to resign
himself to goose-feathers. More, I am half convinced that—whilst
in the coach—he thought he was at home, and once more smiled upon
his forgiving wife. For he kissed, ravenously kissed, the tips of his
own fingers, and muttered “Mabelle ange t "Then, I am sure, thought
he of his peaceful bed and preparing to repose himself therein ; for
he unbuttoned his waistcoat, and I fell into the straw at the bottom
of the coach. At this moment the coachman roared some unintelligible
words—the Frenchman grunted some unintelligible answer—and the
coach stopt. With great alacrity the coachman leapt from the box,
and thundered—knocker in hand—at a door.
“Gen'1'man drunk,” said the coachman, as the maid presented
herself.
“Here’s master again 1” cried the maid.
“I wish I was in my grave 1° exclaimed the mistress.
Hereupon, after some delay, a light was brought, and the maid
came to the coach, and the driver was about to lift out his passenger,
when the girl screamed out, “La I let him be—this isn't my master,
but somebody else’s.”
Again the coachman was compelled to mount the box—again to
drive on. Again and again he stopped ; again and again he knocked
at doors. Again he said, “Gen'l’man drunk;” again domestic
published to the house, “Here's master again :” and again the mis-
tress thereof wished herself out of this most comfortable abiding-
place, the world.
Even the patience of hackney-coachmen may pass away. This
truth I learned on the third appeal to the third knocker; for the
driver, on being for the third time assured that Monsieur Spanneu
was “somebody else's master,” lost all self-restraint—all philosophy.
He roared like a satyr; and coupling the most disrespectful words
with the immortal essence of Monsieur Spanneu, swore that he would
cause that essence to evaporate to a very ungenteel and, doubtless,
disagreeable locality, unless the Frenchman would instantly, and in
the very best English, declare the house where he might lawfully
and conjugally put on his night-cap. It was very strange ; but the
fervour of the coachman acted upon the drunken man like a bucket
of cold water. For a moment, and a moment only, the soul of
Monsieur Spanneu–or rather, sense, for as pigs and goats may get
drunk, the soul can have nothing to do with that very popular
operation—came back into its proper place, wherever it may be,
with all its wits about it, prepared to consider anything that might
be demanded of it. I am sure that a momentary excess of reason
may be wrought out from an excess of drunkenness; in the same way
that a momentary spark, a fire, may be struck from out the cold,
cold flint. Thus, when the coachman laid hold of Monsieur Spanneu,
and with certain circumlocutory phrases, insisted upon a straight-
forward, and most direct, and most reasonable response. Monsieur
Spanneu sat bolt upright, opened his eyes and mouth, and looking
more sensible, and articulating the English language better than I
had ever heard him before, made answer, at once satisfying the
driver as to the truthfulness of his reply.
Dissatisfied is man ; for no sooner had the coachman learned what
he had been an hour and more vainly seeking for, than he uttered
phrases very condemnatory of not only the intellect but the eyes of
his passenger, and with renewed vigour, plied the whip. In a very
short time the vehicle was drawn up at Monsieur Spanneu's door.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Again the coachman knocked, and the door opened ; again he
spoke, in tones as though he had brought some new luxury home—
“Gen'l’man drunk.”
“It can't be master,” cried the maid; Spanneu never having
before offended. She had scarcely uttered the words, however, when
she rushed to the coach, and in amazement cried—“Why, missus, if
it isn’t l”
I then heard Madame Spanneu very distinctly wish herself in
the grave. The coachman inquired if “he should bring the
gen'l’man in 4”
I heard not the answer, but the driver took the Frenchman in his
arms, and carried him towards the house, leaving me a waif, a stray,
upon the world in the bottom of a coach. The door still remained
open.
“Men are brutes, my dear,” said Mrs. Gaptooth.
“Lay him on the door-mat,” said Madame Spanneu.

THE sni Veyson MARBLEs.
At the last meeting, Mr. Addlesconce called the attention of the
members to some marbles which had been found among the lumber in a
garret of one of the houses lately pulled down in St. Martin's Lane. They
were rescued perhaps from something worse than oblivion by an Irish
labourer, a native of St. Giles's, as Mr. Addlesconce stated, and were
purchased by the latter gentleman at the somewhat astounding price of a
pint of porter and an ounce of tobacco, which, though it may bear no
2- proportion to the real value of
º
the marbles as relics of anti-
º \
quity, is still sufficiently de-
monstrative of that gentle-
man's zeal in the rubbish and
dust-hole cause to which he
has already devoted the better
half of his days, and to which
- he would be extremely happy
to devote his better half—in a connubial sense, if the regulations of the
society would admit into their museum a termagant lady in a glass case.
The marbles were produced
in the striped blue and white
bag in which they were found,
and which, after a consider-
able discussion, was pro-
nounced to be dyed with woad,
but whether in the time of the
\ Druids or that of William the \
Fourth, was not satisfactorily -
settled. On emptying the bag, its contents were found to consist of a few
alley-taws and some clay marbles of a rather large size, but very similar
to those used by boys of the
present age. Some of the
marbles had been laboriously
cut in half and ingeniously
rubbed on a hard substance
until their convexity was so
far diminished that they stood
on end. On their flat sur-
faces were delineated various
( &
figures, sketches of which I am enabled to give you by the kindness of the
elderly lady who sweeps the room.
that arose among some of the
members, and from their en-
seemed in a fair way of
equalling—if not exceeding
y the Elgin epithet. Some
fearlessly asserted that they
representations were neither more nor less than Druidical hieroglyphics.

thought he traced in the edi-

Taking all these things into consideration, he thought they might, with
great likelihood of truth, fix the date of these marbles at some period
between the rise and fall of the Roman empire.
Professor Snuffles, on the contrary, would wager his reputation as a
scientific man against any old song extant, that from the shaven state of
the gentleman's head in fig. 9, they are of Chinese origin, the want of
the tail being a careless omission of the artist ; however, as he wished
to take, instead of giving odds in backing his opinion, he was not much
listened to.
Several other opinions were given, and nothing decisive arrived at,
when Mr. Simon Clearwitz, a young member, exposed his infantile
simplicity or gross ignorance in the following speech:—
“Mr. President and Gentlemen, when I entered this room I was as
much convinced as any one here that the fullest and most impartial
inquiry was necessary with regard to the objects at present under our con-
sideration ; this inquiry has been made, and as yet, in my opinion, without
any satisfactory result. I however think I can throw a glimmering of
light upon the subject. It may startle you, gentlemen, but I am convinced
of the truth of what I am going to say, viz., that these marbles date no
farther back than the juvenile days of the proprietor of the house where
they were found. The symbols or figures upon them, I take to be merely
youthful attempts to illustrate the popular legend of the “House that Jack
built.” (Cries of Oh! Oh! and sneers.) Gentlemen might sneer, but such
was his opinion ; and moreover he was convinced that the bird in marble
10 was not intended for the Roman Eagle, but was a representation of
the ‘Cock that crowed in the morn.’” ere the confusion became so
eat that the president was obliged to adjourn the meeting. Messrs.
niveyson and Snuffles signified their intention of resigning their offices
of Secretary, and Treasurer if Mr. Clearwitz continued any longer a
member of the Society.
BRITISH COURTS OF JUSTICE.
ICE-CHANCELLOR WIGRAM'S COURT.—The great
accumulation of business in Chancery caused a clamour
for the appointment of more equity judges, and Messrs.
Knight Bruce and Wigram were accordingly chosen as
Vice-Chancellors. Having got them, the difficulty has
been to know what to do with them; and for the first few
terms they administered justice in temporary sheds, back
bed-rooms, and out-houses. In the first instance, the
new Vice-Chancellors were allowed the run of the gar-
rets over the Parliamentary committee rooms, and
suitors in want of relief were expected to ring one of a series of bells,
when the answer they got was, “Higher up,” as they climbed from flight
to flight towards the attics of Knight Bruce and Wigram. If the Soli-
citor-General happened to be specially retained, it was ten to one that he
did not tumble over a slop-pail on his way up ; and we have seen Sir
Frederick Pollock himself on one occasion enter the court, kicking in
before him a carpet-broom and a dustpan.
This curious amalgamation of the domestic with the dignified, was to a
certain degree inconvenient; and Knight Bruce
has once or twice been interrupted in an elabo-
rate judgment, % a female bursting into the S
apartment with a Turk's head, a rushlight shade,
and a lot of bedroom candlesticks.
In order to obviate these inconveniences the
Vice-Chancellors are to have courts to them-
selves; and though his Honour Knight Bruce is
being passed about from court to court, like a
pauper from parish to parish, his more fortunate
Honour Wigram seems at last to have gained a
settlement. To describe Vice-Chancellor Wi-
gram's court is the object of the present article.
On entering Westminster Hall, where you
naturally expect to find it, you search into every
hole and corner, and on inquiry are told that
the court of Vice-Chancellor Wigram is on the
outside of the Hall, just round the corner
under the archway. Acting upon this direction you pass beneath an
archway on the right, and see a board with a finger painted on it, point-
ing directly towards a waterspout. . On closer inspection you find a
door, and having met with more painted fingers, one of which asserts
distinctly to “Vice-Chancellor Wigram's Court on the First Floor,” you
ascend the staircase. At the end of a long passage is an ordinary door,
which you open, and find yourself in a square chamber, laid down through-
out with matting. On the right is a row of fourteen hat-pegs, opposite to
which, and fastened against the wall on the other side, is an eight-day
dial in a mahogany case, which has all the appearance of having been
“warranted.” The walls are clothed in a rich fresco of white-wash, and
the ceiling is done in the same style—and perhaps by the same hand—to
indicate probably the purity of equity. At the back ef the court and close
under the window, is a form for the accommodation of the public, on
which are one or two stragglers and an usher, whose business it would be to
keep silence, but that the stillness of the place has made his office a sinecure.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 215
A barrier is thrown across the back of the Court, and in front of it is
an uneasy bench for the juniors, while a row of chairs somewhat in ad-
vance are placed for the accommodation of the Queen's Counsel. There
is nothing striking in the arrangements for the bar, but the seat of Vice-
Chancellor Wigram himself is a particularly effective piece of workman-
ship. On a platform about five feet long by thirty inches wide, and
approached by two very low steps, covered with green baize, and flanked
by a wooden bannister, is the judgment-seat. It consists of an easy chair,
ºwnlº
—or at least a chair that would be easy, but for the mahogany Devonport
in front, which must cramp the Vice-Chancellor's legs; for his honour is
far too conscientious to kick, for his own comfort, a hole in the pannel.
His honour is placed between two windows—and has so far the position
of a pier, though he does not sit in the House of Lords, and has only
received the dignity of knighthood. Side by side with the Devonport is a
Pembroke table, one flap of which is necessarily down—or there would be
no room for it. The platform seems to be suddenly cut short at the end
of the Pembroke table, and a screen is carried from this point as far as
the wall, so as to form a sort of retiring room for his Honour, who by
leaping off the platform—for there are no steps on this side—and
crouching down so as to preserve a stooping position, may manage to keep
out of sight for a few minutes. This space is, we presume, intended for
the robing-room ; but his Honour must certainly perform the judicial
toilette while sitting on the floor, for the screen is not more than four feet
high; and accordingly if Vice-Chancellor Wigram should ...; and gown
himself in an erect posture, the ceremony would be performed in sight of
the public. The library of the court is extremely select ; and, as far as
we could see, consists of a Court Guide and a Law List.
Considering that it was thought to be very important to liberty that the
place for administering justice should be fixed, instead of following the
person of the sovereign as it did in olden times, we are surprised that an
effort is not made to give permanently “a local habitation” to Vice-
Chancellors Knight Bruce and Wigram ;
At present they, alas ! are doom'd to soar
From basement up to first or second floor;
And on the morrow may perchance be found,
Holding their sittings somewhere underground.
Shall equity be forced its courts to hold
In dismal attics or in kitchens cold 2
Shall suitors' feelings undergo the rack
. Within the limits of a two-pair back P
By anxious parties shall the Judge be sought,
Up stairs and down, through passage, gateway, court?
Oh, no—for Chancery has enough of frowns,
Without these horrid eartra ups and downs.
The two Vice-Chancellors must 'plex the bar,
Who would but know at all times where they are:
We only ask the Government to fix
A sitting worthy such a pair of bricks.
THE “GENTLE” SHAKSPEARE.
MR. R. L. Jones said, a day or two since at Guildhall, “that there
were but five instances of the signature of Shakspeare in existence, three
of them being attached to his will at Doctors' Commons, one in a volume
of Marmontel at the British Museum, and the autograph which had been
bought the day before.” Shakspeare has worthily obtained the preno-
men of “gentle;” but how excessively kind of him to get out of his grave
to write his name in a copy of “ Marmontel !” Was it not PUNCH
deferentially asks Montaigne.
Mn. Cobden is about to meet the farmers of Rye on the 10th of June. He
will, of course, see plenty of Rye faces.
THE PRINCE OF WALES’S ESTABLISHMENT.
We perceive by Friday's Gazette that the Prince of Wales has got a
Chancellor and an Attorney-General; but it is not universally known that
on the same day his Royal Highness had a wooden Scaramouch and a tin
soldier. When Mr. Pemberton, the Chancellor of the Royal Infant, went
to kiss hands on his appointment, the Prince playfully possessed himself
of the nose of the newly-constituted dignitary. W. understand the fact
of his Royal Highness having experienced this addition to his state, was
announced to his Royal Highness by the Dowager Lady Littleton in the
following very appropriate words.
“Sal he have a chancellor Yes, that he sal, a little peshious. He
shan't be troubled with a little conscience. No, that he shan't. But he
sal have a Chancellor, all to his little self, to keep his little conscience
for him. (Hush-a-by, baby, on the tree top.) And an Attorney-General
too to advocate his little rights, and do all his little business for him.
(Baby, baby, bunting.) They shan’t worry him with nasty accounts. No,
that they shan't, but he will have a little auditor, won't he. (One, two,
buckle my shoe.)”
His Royal Highness condescended to receive this notification very
graciously, and smiling several times, as the nature of the several duties
of his new legal officers was alluded to.
We understand that the conscience of his Royal Highness has been
already presented to Chancellor Pemberton on a sheet of blank vellum.
The Attorney-General has not yet had a brief, but Punch will not fail to
communicate the important fact whenever it happens.

HERE was a fancy fair in the New Cut on
Saturday evening last, in aid of the general
fund for the relief of the mercantile interests.
In order to keep the attendance select, all car-
riages entering the Cut from the Westminster
Road were compelled to pay a toll for admission,
but the promenade for visitors on foot was
gratuitous. The stalls were presided over by
the fair sex, some of whom attracted attention
to their wares by grotesque allusions “to lump-
ing penn'orths” and other allegorical expres-
sions, which an intercourse with the imagina-
tive regions of the East has introduced amongst
us latterly to a very considerable degree. The musical arrangements
were under the arrangement of the police, who kept the various bands
and solo performers continually moving. The fishing interests must have
profited largely by the immense consumption of whelks, which were de-
voured with most unaccountable avidity. The gaiety of the scene was kept
up until a late hour.

A few days ago Mr. Roebuck entered the Court of Queen's Bench in
his silk gown, when Lord Denman addressed him in the usual form,
asking him, when it came to Mr. Roebuck's turn, whether he was prepared
with a motion. The “learned gentleman” implied the usual negative
by shaking his head. “I beg your pardon,” observed Lord Denman,
“I forgot, Mr. Roebuck, that you have moved.”

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOMETHING FROM, AND OF, “JENKINS."
The readers of Punch are by this time aware that there is a print
called The Morning Post (more commonly known of late as The Morning
Jenkins), published every day, Sundays excepted in London. At pre-
sent this luminous sheet emanates from a modest brick building opposite
Somerset-house, in the Strand—the said building being surmounted by
the statue of Mercury as Jenkins (as shown in Punch's last.) Well,
JENRINs, like a plethoric footman who has outgrown his livery, has become
too big for his present building. Old bricks and mortar cannot contain him,
and so he is to be located in a new house built upon orders—between the
Union Composite and the Newgate Doric—in Wellington-street North.
Well, JENkins, who has his bricks at heart, nay, at head too, has made
a design for a beautiful piece of alto reliero to adorn the mansion ; and
has in the handsomest manner favoured us with the subjoined early
copy:
It will be seen at a glance that the vital principles of the Morning Post
are embodied in it. Great with his pen, JENRINs is no less great with his
pencil I We, however, are not to be mollified into the weakness of too
great tenderness towards JENkiss, by any little bit of overt liberality on
his part. JENKINs may be generous, but Punch must be just. JENKins
says—
“Cerito mentured upon a great undertaking indeed; she danced la Cachucha. This
was throwing down the gauntlet to Ellsler, or rather attacking her at once in her strong-
hold We confess, when we first heard of this intention, we were greatly alarmed: the
struggles of Octavius and Antony, of Caesar and Pompey, were mere bagatelles to this
rivalry.”
This appeared one day: mark what came out the next—yea, in
JENKINs's own paper :—
“Mdlle. Cerito requests us to state that she did not attempt to dance the Cachucha
on Tuesday evening. The Gitana was the dance performed by her on that occasion.”
Great was the concern, greater the perspiration of JENKINs when he
saw this. But man is weak. Had JENkINs not been at the Blue Posts,
in the Haymarket, playing all-fours with the French Ambassador's foot-
man—had he been in his place in the pit, and not given away his pass to
his tailor's one journeyman, he must have known the Gitana from the
Cachucha. But seldom is it that JENKINs errs in this way, and we trust
that by this time he is forgiven.
We have next a very private and particular account of the murders of
Fanny EllsleR. JENRINs says–
“Cerito ventured on no slight undertaking when she came, alone, at the same time, to
supply the place of the fairy Dumilatre, and also of that favourite who has triumphed
both in the new world and in the old, and at whose feet erpired in his youth the heir ºf
an empire, and in his old age the greatest political writer of his times. But Cerito has
proved that nothing is above her power, and when she dances we forget all her rivals
[and all her murders.]”
It is an historical fact (though not so well known as it ought to be) that
the Duke of Reichstadt was found dead at the feet of Ellsler, who, after-
wards coming to England, in the most remorseless way, slaughtered “the
greatest political writer of his times”—William Cobbett. We only hope
that JENKINs will not be her third victim.
We cannot, however, leave JENKINs without paying homage to his
ubiquity. For on the very night he visited the opera—at the very hour—
he was at Drury Lane, beholding Athelwold. This is plain : for could any
other pen save that of JENKINs put a sentence in such a delicious tangle
“The chief defect of his drama is an utter want of the chronological allocation of its
tone, which could only have been afforded by that costumed thought which is so rarely
acquired by the dramatist.”
What do you mean, JENKINst “Costumed thought?” What is that
Thought in full-dress, of course. But JENKINs, pray write to be under-
stood—don't affect to write “too well”—condescend to be a man of the
world—in a word, be a Man of the People, JENKINs 1
. NEEDLES AND CORONETS-GREAT MEETING OF THE DUCHESSES
The oldest dowager cannot remember so brilliant a meeting as was
yesterday held at Almack's. The tragic revelations recently made before
the House of Commons,—the frightful history published in the Reports of
the Children's Employment Commission,-have struck with contrition and
amazement all the fashionable world. In several instances, very delicately
kept from the public mind, the effect of these publications has been most
intense and extraordinary. A certain dowager marchioness, celebrated
for the splendour and brilliancy of her diamonds, in the very morbidity of
what she deems remorse, refused to wear her costly gems from the moment
she became assured of the miseries of those fifteen thousand London
victims, the milliners and dressmakers. Another distinguished lady—the
widow of an earl—has put aside the turbans and head-dresses for which she
had a most enviable reputation, and was seen on Wednesday last only,
cheapening a muslin cap in Cranbourne Alley. Three maiden ladies,
daughters of an admiral, have resolved for the rest of their lives to wear
nothing but gingham gowns made by their own fingers. We will not
further obtrude on the respectable secresies of private life, but have felt it
necessary to state thus much, in order to gladden the too. unbelieving
world with the tidings of benevolence and sisterly love at present struggling
in May-fair and the vicinity of St. James's.
For some three or four days past, the intended meeting was well known
throughout the West end; and expectation, to use a Jenkinsonian figure,
stood on tiptoe at a very early hour yesterday morning. Yes; it was
known, to the delight of thousands, that the fairest, the loveliest, and—as
a crowning recommendation—the richest of the daughters of England,
were about to take counsel together, that they might snatch a suffering
r
sisterhood from a drudgery that killed mind and body—from the slavery
of sleepless nights—from the pangs of early disease—from the horrors of
blindness. This was known; and great was the throb of the great West-
end's heart at the knowledge |
From an early hour yesterday the principal streets leading to Almack's
bore outward token of a glorious holiday. All the shops were shut up,
whilst thousands of the fair sex, in their very best attire, smiling like
Hope and Pity in their sweetest moods, were seated at the upper windows.
In many instances, we were delighted to see garlands of flowers—with
boughs of May, laburnum, and lilac—decorating the door-posts. At the
houses of the various tradesmen of the distinguished ladies about to gather
together, we observed their armorial bearings beautifully composed of
flowers. Bands paraded the streets—labour took a holiday—everybody
smiled upon one another as though softened and elevated by a contempla-
tion of the scene. At various distances, bands were stationed, and played
airs appropriate to the festivity of the occasion.
So early as ten o'clock, all the persons comprising the household of
every distinguished lady bound for Almack's—all in their best clothes and
brightest liveries, with a profusion of white rosettes (we presume in allusion
to the purity of the cause) took their places in the line of road; and it is
but bare justice to them to state that we never before saw so many people
in livery behave so orderly—with such humility. Footmen looked mildly
serious—even “tigers” were subdued by the influence of the scene.
At about half-past ten, the first carriage of the first duchess made its
appearance at the top of St. James's-street. Beautiful was the shout that
greeted it ! The horses, as though unused to such popular admiration,

started ; but the coachman, with steady hand and serene face, held them
in. No mischief occurred, and the multitude shouted the louder. Fast
and fast followed carriage upon carriage; and still the crowd shouted, and
the music played; and a number of children at various windows set free
at least five hundred doves from wicker cages, doves which an eccentric
old gentleman near us, evidently a Pythagorean, insisted upon calling the
souls of departed milliners, blinded and slain by the murderess needle.
Certainly, all things conduced to give the imagination a fillip. Thus,
we saw not in the carriage-pannels of the titled benefactresses the old
heraldic bearings and their ancient legends—uncouth griffins, hydras, and
dragons with mortal syllables, but beautiful faces, seraphic presences;
with sentences breathing love and Christian charity in Latin, English, and
old Norman French
All the ladies having arrived at the rooms, the chair was taken exactly
at twelve o'clock by the Duchess of BuccLeuch.
Her Grace, in a sweet and gentle speech, briefly opened the proceedings.
They had been called together by the voice of pity. (Hear.) A voice of
suffering—a low, yet, Heaven be thanked, at last an audible, voice. The
heart of fashion had been struck; and she trusted that the proceedings of
that day would disabuse a public prejudice that that heart was only of
rock; or if, indeed, it were, that it was at least like another rock she could
name, which being smitten, gushed forth with refreshing streams for
panting hearts and withered lips. (Loud cries of “Hear.”)
The Duchess of SUTheRLAND rose to propose the first resolution. Her
Grace (and as she spoke, never did earthly clay look more beautiful)
observed, that she came with a certain sense of contrition to the fulfilment
of a high, a solemn duty. (Hear.) She had read—they all had read—
the Parliamentary Reports. (Cries of “We have.”) Was it possible to
peruse those tragedies of humble life, and not to feel almost ashamed of
being rich (Hear.) Was it possible to reflect upon the condition of
their sisters—yes, her Grace would say, sisters—and not to feel humiliated
by the wealth, the glory, the splendour which—from the cradle to the
grave—surrounded they themselves? (Applause.) As a Christian lady
(her Grace continued), she felt that Providence expected of her—of them
—a kind and gentle guardianship of the children of poverty; of the poor
milliner girl, whose life was dedicated to the adorning of what Heaven
made one common clay, but of which, she feared it, wealth was too apt to
make to itself an idol. Her Grace, amidst very great applause, concluded
by moving the first resolution, to the effect, that an association should be
formed to induce the principal dressmakers and milliners to limit the
hours of work to eight per day.
The Countess of Wilton, with a lovely smile, seconded this resolution.
—Carried unanimously.
The Duchess of Bedford proposed the second resolution. Her Grace
observed that she wanted adequate language in which to paint her
feelings—the feelings which possessed her on reading the Report alluded
to by her friend the illustrious Chairwoman. Women had, by a
thousand devoted acts, indicated the benevolence, the goodness of their
sex; but never, since woman first woke in Eden, had she been employed
in a nobler mission than that which had called them together. (Loud
cheers.) Her Grace must confess it. Having read the Report in
question, she had for a time felt an inconceivable horror—an inexpress-
ible pang of heart—when she looked upon the fineries of dress. Potent,
most potent, was imagination. She could not help beholding the very
heartstrings of the poor milliner's girl worked in some costly robe—
could not but see the light of the girl's quenched eyes in the ornaments
that shone upon it. This might be called superstition. Happy did her
Grace feel that she was now suffering beneath its influence. (Hear, hear,
with two or three audible sobs from the Meeting.) Her Grace moved the
second resolution : “to abolish all Sunday work, and to afford the sick
early medical advice, change of air, and other necessary comforts.”
Lady ByRon, in seconding the resolution, said she felt proud to observe
that Christianity was making such vast strides in fashionable life. (Reso-
ution carried. -
The Duchess of SoMERSET proposed the third resolution. Her Grace
read part of the evidence from the Report, which stated that “a consider-
able amelioration would be effected, if ladies were more considerate in
giving their orders.” Her Grace said, she feared that many among them
had been the thoughtless persecutors of the dressmaker and milliner.
(An elderly lady cried, “That's right—give it 'em.”) They had looked
upon these helpless creatures as mere machines—things of another nature;
and therefore, in the very wantonness of power, had given their orders
despotically, careless at what sacrifice of health and eyesight they were
executed, so they were done. (Hear.) Her Grace trusted that they
were upon the eve of better things: she hoped that they would no longer,
once a week at least, confess themselves, as a mere matter of form, to be
“miserable sinners,” careless of what further sins they committed by
over-tasking their poor and helpless fellow-creatures. Her Grace moved a
resolution, declaratory of the necessity of “allowing reasonable time for
the execution of orders.”
Lady Ashley, in an eloquent speech, seconded the resolution.—Carried
unanimously.
The Duchess of Buckingham, in moving the fourth resolution, bore
testimony to the truthful eloquence of her illustrious friend of Somerset.
For her (the Duchess of B.'s) part, unless something was done, she should
feel that on Court-days, at parties, &c., she always carried about with her
the ghost of a milliner—should feel that her very clothes were haunted
and possessed by the departed spirit of a sacrificed sempstress. (Hear.)
“Frequently, on wedding-orders,” said the Report, “it was not uncom.
mon to work all night !” Could a blessing be hoped upon nuptials which
occasioned such misery Did not the bride stand at the altar with a
very blight upon her (Loud cries of Hear, hear. Several of the
auditors were deeply affected. An old peeress—whose name we could
not learn—in a spasm of grief wrung her pocket-handkerchief like a wet
sponge.) Her Grace then moved the fourth resolution, that a fund be
established to carry the objects of the association into effect.
Here the Duchess of Sutherland rose, and said she had it in command,
on the part of her gnacious Majesty, to offer a royal subscription
of—One hundred guineas annually. (Loud cheers.)
All the ladies present then became annual subscribers, the minimum
sum being twenty guineas each.
The meeting then broke up. The ladies returned in their carriages in
the order they came : the populace cheering, and all the bands playing
with one accord—“Angels, ever bright and fair!”
THE GRATUITOUS EXHIBITIONS OF LONDON.
CHAP. IV.-THE PANORAMA of LoNDoN.—PRIMRose HILL.
NLY a few days have passed away since the occur-
rence of a most important event The mighty
George Robins has achieved what Time, with all his
boasted, power, has been unable to accomplish
thoroughly, with respect to its Roman prototype—
he has knocked down the Colosseum, and decided
its lot ; for we believe it went in one only. With
a power superior to Napoleon's, he has placed the
right of way through the Swiss pass, and over the
chain of mountains which separate Albany-street
from the Regent's Park, in other hands. He has
proved himself master of the Imperial Eagle—
that bold and animated bird, whose lively plumage
and haughty bearing all must recollect,when, perched in native dignity upon
the clinker-rock, at an altitude of nearly three English feet above the
level of the New Road, he contemplated the silent lake, supplied by the
leaden pipe which took its origin from the New River. He has also (but
this is whispered in strict confidence) secured the services of the daring
mountaineer Melchthal Winkelreid Hopkins to conduct future visitors to
these interesting regions, hallowed by the memory of that champion of
Helvetian liberty, who, although his name was Tell, never revealed the
projects of the confederacy. This great man (the Colosseum attendant),
under whose sole control the ice of the Raspberry and Vanille Glaciers
have been placed for many summers, was absolutely necessary to the
establishment, and the promise of a liberal salary has retained him. The
new proprietor recollected the axiom—so particularly appropriate to the
localities of the Regent's Park—point d'aryent, point de Suisse—and
engaged him accordingly.
But why has the Colosseum thus fallen beneath the hammer of the
auctioneer? For the simple reason, that it did not pay. It was found
necessary to put the whole establishment up the spout of its own ascending-
room, because the shillings of the visitors no longer liquidated the pounds
of the expenses to keep it up, on account of the feeling becoming so
fearfully prevalent, that it is not necessary to pay for the best sights that
London can offer. The century-blooming Aloes was entirely blown,
and people thought more of them in the medical form of decoction; gold
fish, of equal value, were gratuitously exhibited in the Pantheon conser-
vatory, with macaws, exotics, and fountains to boot; statues, in every
respect as good as those in the saloon, could be seen at all the plaster
shops near Drury lane; the excavations of the railways formed bolder
ravines than the Swiss pass; and, above all, the Panorama of London,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
which was the great feature of the establishment, could be seen for
nothing from the adjacent hill of Primrose.
This celebrated mountain, which derives its name from the profusion
of primroses which cover its sides throughout the year, is well worth a
visit from the stranger in London, if it be merely to inspect the panorama
we allude to. There are various tracks for arriving at the summit, but
possibly the one to be preferred is that leading from the Hampstead Road
and by Chalk Farm—so called from the number of scores formerly run
up there for breakfast, which were not always paid, in consequence of one
or the other of the parties getting shot in the fields beyond. The visitor
should notice the adjacent tea-gardens, in which, however, the plant is
not cultivated, although it is supposed to be on an extensive scale in the
hedges adjoining the estate. Further on, he will pass the frog-preserves,
which form a principal point of rendezvous for the more juvenile Sunday
frequenters, and from which the foreign gentlemen, who reside in the
secret regions of the towns of Camden and Kentish, during the off part of
the season, are supposed to derive their chief subsistence. Should the
traveller need refreshment it will be advisable to procure it at Chalk
Farm—which again has, by other antiquaries, been supposed to derive its
name from the milk produced at the dairy—for this is the last habitation
up the mountain, and nothing can be procured on the top, except Bar-
celona nuts and brandy-balls, together with sticks of a substance peculiar to
the district, apparently composed of treacle, dirt, and peppermint, and
termed “cocktail” by the merchants who dispose of it to foreigners.
The Panorama of London has all the effects of light and shade—although
perhaps more of the shade than the light—in common with its artificial
opposition below. The cross and ball of St. Paul's can sometimes be per-
ceived with the naked eye, but it is never brought so near as the one at
the Colosseum.
The vast lake of the Barrow Hill Reservoir appears at the feet of the
spectator; and were it not for this, and some houses, and several other
things besides, a very good view could be obtained of the Zoological
Gardens. There is no ascending-room, as at the Colosseum, to arrive at
the summit, but a very speedy way of coming down again may be attained
by climbing over the top of the shafts which lead down to the tunnel of the
Birmingham Railway.
The visitor should, however, be cautioned against forming too sanguine
notions of the extent of this view ; for possibly, when he arrives there he
may find all his visions end in smoke, that being the chief natural produc-
tion of London. And, indeed, it is in the smoke that the great points of
resemblance in the two panoramas will be found, which in either case has
the same effect—that of obscuring the view.
There is Swiss scenery attached to the panorama of Primrose Hill as
well as to the Colosseum. The rustic chálets are mostly situate in Park
Village, amidst scenery in admirable keeping with their Helvetian archi-
tecture, together with railways, omnibuses, and public-houses. Their
position appears exposed to the full force of the avalanches from the
adjacent heights, but we do not hear of many catastrophes in consequence.
During hard frosts in winter, the snow on the summit of Primrose Hill
never melts, and therefore this period should not be chosen for the
excursion. In summer, however, the attempt is perfectly free from
danger, and the overland journey thither from Regent Street, by
omnibus, which species of vehicle has opened a great facility of com-
munication to travellers, should form one of the earliest trips of the
stranger in London.
NARRATIVE
OF AN EXPERIMENTAL TRIP IN AN AERIAL COURIER.
BY PROFESSOR GULLPHLATT.
[A few days back an article appeared in some of the morning papers, copied from The
Atlas, purporting to be the report, by a Professor Geolis, of a trial excursion in the
flying-machine. A talented individual is highly indignant at having the merit of the
first essay taken from him, and has sent us this narrative, which we insert with much
pleasure.]
he description of the Aerial Courier,
which I saw in Punch, led me to
regard the machine as so simple in
construction—so perfectly capable of
performing all that Mr. Henson's
flying-ship will ever do—that I lost no
time in constructing one according
to the diagram, as no specification of
patent was annexed to the descrip.
tion.
I experienced some little difficulty
in procuring a sufficient number of
back copies of Punch to form the main
suspender. At last, several presses
in A*-
were put in action, and I was necommodated with the desired quantity,
choosing principally the Almanack and the April Number—the first from
its extreme lightness, and the last from being otherwise appropriate to my
scheme. I also obtained considerable extra volatility, through the exer.
tions of some of the first working chemists in London, who furnished me
with some condensed jokes, compressed with a pressure of one thousand
atmospheres in strong cast-iron cylinders. The roof and sides of the car
were covered with the “Table Talk" from the Morning Post, which
rendered every part impermeable, from the total impracticability of any-
thing or anybody ever being able to get through it; and the engine-
room and working parts of the engine I wished to have put under the
superintendence of Lord Brougham, since, added to his scientific know-
ledge, he had been so long in hot water as to be a most desirable acquisition.
But I was, upon reflection, so uncertain as to how, in some of his freaks,
he might choose to make the propellers revolve, that I abandoned the
idea, finding that it could not much benefit my scheme to have the engines
working all ways at once, which it would be very likely to do, under his
management.
All being prepared, I took the huge machine under my arm, and, without
telling a soul of my intentions, walked up the inclined plane of Primrose-
hill, whence I intended to take flight, very early one fine inorning last
week. Having got it in order, I lighted the fire with a lucifer, and then,
when the steam was sufficiently up, I got inside, cut the rope that fastened
the Courier to a stake, and allowed it to start, which it did simultaneously
with myself, the first dart off being somewhat unexpected.
The machine ran rapidly down the custom slope of the hill, and I was in
some fear of shooting into the middle of the arbours in the Chalk Farm tea-
gardens, but fortunately took another direction. I flew past a man in
the garb of a superior livery servant, who was collecting small weeds
from one of the hedges, with a parasol over his head ; a second glance,
hastily taken, assured me that it was the lovely Jenkins of the Morning
Post, from the portrait I had seen in Punch. He
stared vaguely for an instant, and then went on with
his work.
To my great joy, the machine now began to ascend,
narrowly avoiding the tall chimneys of the engine-
house on the railway, and then passing over Camden-
Town. On looking down upon this district, I per-
ceived an immense number of individuals who ran out
of their houses with portfolios, and endeavoured to
sketch the Courier as it passed. I learned subse-
quently that this spot is peopled by many thousand
wandering artists, who were now striving to be first
in publishing the representation to the world. A vio-
lent battle took place amongst them the instant l had
passed.
Turning the rudder, I now pro-
ceeded in a southerly direction,
crossing the New Road, and then
passing over the one of Tottenham
Court, when I let go the grapnels,
and obtained a large quantity of
articles from the different stalls,
including radishes, flounders,
trouser-straps, and pickled whilks.
Once, indeed, I caught an old
woman, and did not perceive it
until I had dragged
her, to her great
consternation, as
far as Meux's
Brewery, where I
contrived to let her
fall gently into
a waggon-load of
grains, without any
great injury to her-
self. -.
It was at this point that my mishaps commenced. I had lowered the
Courier somewhat the better to deposit the old woman, and not keeping
a sufficient look-out, in the direction I was following, the next instant
I bumped against the steeple of St. Giles's Church. The shock turned
the machine completely round, and the propellers assuming a contrary
action, the whole apparatus kept revolving, over, and over, and over, at a
most fearful rate, compelling me to run round and round like a white
mouse in a turning cage. My barometer, too, fell at the same time—not
merely a few degrees, but right down to the earth, where it disappeared
through a skylight in the Rookery, and was seen no more.
But the worst catastrophe was to come. Anxious to restrain the
whirlings of the machine, I endeavoured to let off a few spare jokes from
one of the condensed cylinders, when whiz 1 Fiz 1 BANG ! !! went
the whole apparatus, one pipe after the other; and I was in an instant
enveloped in a cloud of jokes. That minute all my self possession left
me: The jocular atmosphere pervaded my organization, and, screaming
with laughter as I inhaled it, I thought the whole accident a glorious
piece of fun... I screamed and shouted with delight as joke after joke
burst, from its confinement, and no longer i. the course of the
machine, which kept rolling onwards, gradually approaching the earth,
and knocking down all the chimneys that it came against i was at last
brought to myself, by a sudden submersion in water, when the truth broke
upon me in an instant, that I had fallen into the Thames. The fire was

of course immediately extinguished, and I had barely time to scramble
through one of the windows, before the machine touched the bed of
the river.
I rose to the surface, and was picked up by the Moonshine fourpenny
steamboat, which was providentially passing at the instant; but the
machine was lost—as well as I can determine—close by one of the piers
of the Hungerford Bridge, where it has not much chance of ever being
disturbed. The steamer put me on shore at Waterloo-bridge stairs, and
| immediately made the best of my way to the Punch Office, where it is
but justice to state that I received every attention from your boy Dick
that my uncomfortable state demanded.
In conclusion, you are perfectly at liberty to make any use you please
of this narrative; but should any of the papers feel disposed to copy it
into their columns, it will be as well for them to state the quarter
from whence they have obtained it, that its authenticity may be relied
upon.

THAMES ANGLING SOCIETY.
The season for the delightful sport of angling now rapidly approaching,
a very favourable report has been made by the committee of this laudable
institution, and it appears that by the great care of the water-bailiffs, in
the preservation of the fish, many fine mackerel have been caught in
Shepperton Deeps.
The shoals of sprats at Walton are numerous. Some large pairs of soles
were taken at Hampton ; they rose greedily to an artificial May-fly.
A splendid specimen of a dolphin was hooked at Staines. It was
forwarded to Her Majesty at Windsor Castle, and has been consigned to
the Virginia Water.
By the unwearied exertions of the Thames Angling Society, we have
very little doubt but few years will elapse before the fish of the sea will
utterly supersede the fresh-water fish.
Three brace of Jaune Dorées were caught on Wednesday last by a
gentleman who angled from the Hammersmith Suspension Bridge. And
early in last week, Joseph Arden, Esq., had the good fortune, at Twicken-
ham Ait, to hook and land a salmon weighing 16 pounds; and which he
found, to his utter surprise, to be ready pickled
Bad News for London Anglers.
We are chagrined to have to detail a fact, which may prove some draw-
back on the foregoing prosperous report; but we have ascertained beyond
a doubt, that some small fry of the Great American Sea-Serpent have
made their way, by an unknown channel, into the New River. A specimen
was caught opposite to the Middleton's Head, last Saturday. Tho young
gentleman who captured it could not get it into his bottle.
33arodial Intelligence.
PARTY politics are still running high in the Metropolitan Parishes. The
reds have had an attack of the blues, and the yellows have asked for funds,
which the greens have readily contributed.
The debate last week at the Paving board was of the most distressingly
personal character.
The wooden-block party includes (as we have frequently remarked) all
the heads of the board, but the stone section, though inclined to flag in
zeal, will not as yet yield to any impression.
In consequence of some ill-natured rumours about the injury done to
the carriage-way by the cab-stand, a vote of confidence in the waterman
was agreed to, and it was resolved that the freedom of the street should
ºne presented to him in a pint of porter.
QUEEN ADELAIDE'S VISIT TO THE TEMPLE.
It being understood that Her Majesty Queen Adelaide was desirous of
visiting the Temple, every preparation was made for the reception of
royalty. On Saturday, the 13th, the royal carriages drove up to the
archway, where they were received by a casual porter, who explained
that there was no carriage road; and a consultation took place between
one of the royal footmen and the official in question, who were joined by
two or three casual passengers. The royal cortège was then directed to
a small avenue for vehicles, but the coachman having observed that it
was almost perpendicular, declined venturing down it, and another con-
sultation took place between a city policeman and another of the royal
footmen, which ended in backing the carriages—a ceremony that excited
cºnsiderable interest among the bystanders. The procession then
wheeled rapidly down. Essex-street, at the suggestion of an anonymous
individual, but on reaching the alleged turning into the Temple, it was
found tº consist of a paved court for foot passengers only. After con-
siderable difficulty the cortège was again turned round, and the royal
procession moved off in the direction of Fleet-street, where agentlemanly
Wol. IV.-1843,
looking person gave such information as led to the carriages being driven
down Bouverie-street and into the Temple by King's Bench Walk.
On reaching the Hall, the royal party were met by a small knot of
porters, holding up the cane of office, and pointing in a northerly direc-
tion, while one or two of the body ran precipitately towards the Fleet-
street carriage entrance, but returned almost immediately followed by
some of the Benchers at full speed, with the steward, who is rather cor-
pulent, panting after them. It appeared that a deputation of Benchers
had been dodging the cortège at all the entrances, tearing about from gate
to gate in the hope of meeting it. As soon as the senior Bencher could
regain possession of his wind, he read the following address:–
“May it (a gasp) please your Maj (a gasp)—Majesty. We the Ben—
(a gasp)—Benchers of this ancient Inn (a gasp), welcome your Majesty
(a gasp) to this ancient-" (a very long gasp and a pause).
At this point her Majesty, with her characteristic kindness, smiled be-
nignantly, and ordering the royal footman to let down the steps, descended
from the carriage. The procession then moved in the following order:
Porters WEARING THEIR. Tickets,
(walking partially backwards, and beating off the boys,)
THE LAUNDREss of THE HALL STAIRcase,
(carrying the venerable ashes of the grate in order to mingle them with
the dust of surrounding Templars,)
THE SIX CLERKS OF THE HALL STAIRCASE,
(bearing the bags of brieflessness,)
MR. THESIGER's wig-Box,
(supported by his clerks,)
A JUNIOR BARRISTER,
(not supported by anything, but vigorously endeavouring to support
himself.)
Her Majesty Queen Adelaide,
(surrounded by the deputation of Benchers, and followed by the royal
footmen, &c. &c.)
The procession was closed in by a tableau of the Steward, who after
several gasps, sank exhausted into the arms of the porters,
Her Majesty was conducted over the beautiful church, and was informed
of the recent discovery of some bones, at first thought to have belonged
to the Templars; but from the fact of the bones having been thoroughly
picked, the better opinion seems to be that they belonged not to the
Templars themselves, but to their clients. Her Majesty was then con-
ducted to the Treasurer's office, where sandwiches and ale—the fourpenny
arrangement that is just now so popular—were laid out on the desk which
had been propped up by Pigot's Directory to make it level. Her Majesty
was then conducted round Pump Court, and was very curious to see the
Pump which she expected to find in the centre, but Her Majesty was
informed that the Court took its name of Pump chiefly from the inha-
bitants. The Queen Dow.ger then requested to be shown the famous
fig-tree of Fig-tree Court, but was informed that if it ever existed, it had
long since been pulled up, for there had been no trace of it from the
period when Tomkins the Templar took up his quarters in the area, and
set the example of turning the kitchens into chambers.
Her Majesty was then taken to inspect the famous fountain, modelled
—not after—but considerably before those of Versailles, and which has
been faithfully imitated in the modern garden-engines. By an arrange-
ment with the West Middlesex water-works, it was to have been in full

play, but there was some mistake as to the attendance of the turncock,
and Her Majesty therefore contented herself with looking at the iron tube
and asking a few questions about the depth of the round reservoirs. One
of the benchers immediately satisfied the royal curiosity by plunging a
cane belonging to one of the porters, into the bosom of the liquid, and
ascertained the depth to be about eighteen inches.
Her Majesty, having thanked the benchers, retired by the same gate at
which she had entered.
DEATH OF A PIER.
We are sorry to read in the
MoRNING parens (late edition,)
the decease of the well-known Pier at Greenwich. The deceased had
been long in a sinking state, and had been subjected to water ºn the
head, as well as other ills of a very distressing character. The allusion
sometimes made by sailors to their legs when invoking, a coolness in
the lower extremities was frightfully realised in the case of the late Pier,
whose timbers were completely shivered between 7 and 8 on Thursday
morning. The Pier of Greenwich had the second title of Barren of
Dividends; and though never known to be in hot water, was on several
occasions nearly swamped in the cold element. The Pier, which had
been proceeded against for a nuisance, has left no issue, but the several
issue, which it pleaded to a declaration served upon it when in extremis,
Father Thames – the mortgagee in possession—has carried off several of
the timbers, and invested this, the only property of the deceased, in a bank
of all sorts of deposits.
DUBLIN.
ForTHcoMING New LiterARY UNDERTAKING.—Under the title of
THE OCCASIONAL PAPER,
and which will start its claim for originality on the following grounds,
viz., That the publication is to subsist without daily, weekly, or monthly
subscribers.
The OccasionAL PAPER will not be supposed to give any accurate
intelligence, because it will depend upon chance instead of dates; on
circumstances rather than facts; and the probable success of the publi-
cation will rest itself on the premises, that it will endeavour always to be
an unexpected pleasure. -
The Occasional PAPER will not be undertaken by any regular pub-
lisher, as its constitution is perfectly irregular; the design therefore is
original; for in these literary days, when both town and country are inun-
dated with the lucubrations of the diurnal press,
THE Occasional PAPER, especially if not published, will be found a
literary treat.
The Politics of THE OccasionAL PAPER will be invariably occasionally
Conservative, Whig, or Ultra-Radical.
Subscribers' names cannot be received at the office, the situation of
which has not yet been decided on.
Economy in the City.
SIR PETER LAURIE has a motion to propose at the next Court of Alder-
men to the following effect: “That, as an economical measure, the gas
and water be supplied to all places in the city through one and the same
pipe.”

Unawews.”

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPTER xx.-A HOUSE IN BLOOMSBURY.- I AGAIN MEET PATTY
BUTLER.
THE coachman drove to his stand ; where, with the patience of his
tribe, he sat meekly awaiting another call. I heard a church clock
strike ten ; immediately afterwards, a sharp, shrill female voice
cried “coach,” and the driver instantly opened the door, and handed
in a woman, who bade him drive to some street, for the name escaped
me, in Bloomsbury. The woman, as it appeared to me, was under
some strange excitement; for now she giggled, and now again she
sighed heavily, and now she cried “Well, well, he can't last for ever,”
—and with that consolation, laughed outright. In the midst of this,
she let fall her handkerchief, and stooping to feel for it, her hand
caught me. How her eyes sparkled, as she held me to the window,
and by the dim lamps in the street, scrutinized my shadowed beauty.
“It can't belong to the coachman,” she said; and immediately con-
cealed me. From the brief glance I had had of my new possessor,
I did not feel particularly hilarious at my destiny. She was a woman
of about three or four and twenty, with an animated face, but withal
a certain vivacious boldness of the eye, unpleasing to the sobriety of
my constitution. However, she had taken possession of me, by right
of discovery. I was, to her own satisfaction at least, her lawful
property.
The coach stopt in a narrow, dark street, opposite a mean-looking,
dirty house—a house with all the outward indications of squalor and
disrepute, I may be fanciful, but there is a physiognomy in houses
—at least such is my belief. Sure I am, I have seen houses with a
swaggering, hat-a-cock sort of look; whilst other habitations have
seemed to squint and leer wickedly from the corners of the windows.
The house the coach stopt at was of this kind ; my heart fell as my
new possessor gently struck the knocker. “You’ll give more than
a shilling t” said the coachman, with an affected air of wonderment.
“A shilling is your honest fare—and as an honest man you can ask
no more,” was the feminine reply. “Honest man " muttered the
coachman, as if the woman talked of something altogether out of
human experience. “Yes, honest man " answered my new owner,
—who continued to press me closely under her arm, ringing
honesty upon every note of her shrill, quick voice. At length, the
coachman mounted his box in evident disgust at the gibberish he
had been compelled to listen to ; for his departing growl was
“honesty,” with no supplementary compliment to that very re-
spectable virtue.
“And here you are agin, Mrs. Cramp : " cried an old, withered
woman, as my new mistress entered the house. “And I hope
you've enjoyed yourself?”
“Not at all,” answered Mrs. Cramp, with sudden ill-humour.
“Well that is a bit of beauty 1" exclaimed the old woman, as
Mrs. Cramp laid me upon the table. “How much did it cost "
“Got it quite a bargain,_I may say for next to nothing. And
how's your lodger, now " said Mrs. Cramp, with an evident wish to
withdraw me as the subject of conversation.
“La what do you think Well, wonders will never cease. It’s
only half-an-hour after you went away, when a gentleman comes
here, and inquires about her. I thought there was some mystery in
that pale face of hers. Well, when he found out that she was the
lost sheep he'd been looking after, he went on like mad. He told
me, as soon as she got well, he'd marry her, and make a lady of her—
and more than that, putting a golden guinea in my hand, he told me
to let her want for nothing.”
IIere Mrs. Cramp drew herself up, saying—“Mrs. Crumpet, I
knew I was right—though I never clapt my eyes upon her, I knew
she couldn't be any better than she should be.”
“Well, well, we've all our little faults,” said the charitable Mrs.
Crumpet. “But I hav'n't told you all. Besides the guinea, the
gentleman went away, and in his own pockets brought back two
bottles of wine; and told me not to spare it, for there was plenty
more where that came from. So, my dear Mrs. Cramp, we'll take
a little glass, just to drink the poor thing's health.”
“I have no objection to wish the gentleman health ; but as for
your lodger, we don't know who's who,” said Mrs. Cramp.
“Oh, she’s a sweet, quiet little pigeon,” cried the benevolent Mrs.
Crumpet; and her thin, yellow face, shone with a smile like new
gold. The wine was produced; the glasses filled, when a knock at
the street-door called the landlady from the room. In a moment she
returned. “It’s only Becky; but she says Mr. Cramp wont be pacified
with any lies they can tell him—he's doing nothiug but screaming
for you.”
“Well, well, he can't last for ever,” was the self-comforting answer
of the wife. She then took the glass, and saying “Here's the gentle-
man's health, whoever he is,” emptied it. “Well, I suppose like the
girl in the play, I must take off my finery and be Cinderella again,”
said Mrs. Cramp, and she rose to leave the room.
“You’ll find everything as you left it,” said Mrs. Crumpet, who,
during her mistress's absence called in Becky, and glorified her with
half a glass of wine. “I suppose, you don't get much of this sort of
stuff with your master " said Mrs. Crumpet. The girl made no
answer; but gave a melancholy shake to her head ; drank the wine,
and heaved a deep sigh. “And has the old fellow made much of a
rumpus 1" -
“He’s been doing nothing but praying and swearing these two
hours,” said Becky.
“Well, Providence is very good,” said Mrs. Crumpet; “there's one
good thing—he's bedrid.”
“That's the only blessing” said Becky, “for we can have the
comfort of shutting all the doors and letting him hallo.”
More conversation of this consolatory cast took place, ere the
return of Mrs. Cramp. At length she entered the room ; but what a
change She had thrown off every vestige of her finery, and was
drest with scarcely more pretension than the smutch-faced, blowsy
maid-of-all work who had come to fetch her. “You’ll take care of
the things, and of that particularly,” said Mrs. Cramp, pointing me
out to Mrs. Crumpet.
“Like the apples of my eyes,” answered the landlady with em-
phasis. She then took the candle, and preceded her visitor to the
street-door. “Good night, my dear Mrs. Cramp, let us hope for
happier days.”
“Yes; he can't last long,” again repeated Mrs. Cramp; and,
lightened by such comfort, I heard her trip quickly past the window,
followed by Becky. Mrs. Crumpetreturned to the parlour, and setting
herself at the table, whereon was still the wine, divided her admira-
tion between the bottle and myself. “Well, they ought to bless
their stars as are born to such things,” said Mrs. Crumpet; her heart
evidently softening under vinous influence. She continued to solilo-
quize. “Ha! with such fine feathers, what a fine bird I should have
been 1 And now—the lord help me !—I lets lodgings to all sorts.”
Then, for new solace, did Mrs. Crumpet again address herself to the
wine, which still increased its kindly operation. She took me from
the table ; shook me ; blew through me ; and then began to hum the
songs of her youth. For some minutes she said nothing ; but sure I
am her brain was busy with the past; with the glowing, radiant hopes
which had faded into leaden-coloured realities ; for after a time, she
dropt me upon the table, and in a deeper key exclaimed confidentially
to herself—“And now I lets lodgings "
At length, Mrs. Crumpet rose, and placing the bottle affectionately
under one arm, she carried me, a wine-glass, and a candlestick from
the room, with, as I soon perceived, the intention of ascending the
stairs. This operation, after some difficulty, she effected; and in
due season I arrived at the door of one of the garrets. As Mrs.
Crumpet opened the door—I know not how it was—but the candle
fell from her hand, and was extinguished. With wonderful presence
of mind—I might even say with an intuitive instinct—Mrs. Crum-
pet held fast the bottle.
“Who’s there 1" cried a low, gentle voice—the voice of suffering.
Instantly I recognised it; a tremour thrilled me. It was the little
feather-dresser, Patty Butler. “Who's there : " again she asked, in
darkness.
“They do make such candles now !” cried Mrs. Crumpet; and she
groped for the lost treasure, which with some difficulty she regained.
“I’ve a tinder-box in the cupboard; for at my time of life I can't
get up and down stairs as I used to do.” Saying this, Mrs. Crumpet
with extraordinary facility, took the box from the shelf. Here, how-
ever, began a difficulty. Mrs. Crumpet endeavoured to strike a light :
but by some accident neither flint nor steel would meet. Sometimes
the stone jagged one set of the striker's knuckles—sometimes the
steel the other. And thus Mrs. Crumpet sat and struck, and struck,
but no spark came !
Oh, wine—wine—Bacchus—Bacchus ! Here, in a wretched garret,
with an old crone of a landlady, was thy subtle wickedness made
manifest How often does excess of wine prevent the spark that
might otherwise have cast its radiance far around ! IIow often has
the genius, drenched with grape, done nought, when working hard
to scintillate, but blindly strike his own knuckles
“The rain must have come in upon the tinder,” said Mrs. Crumpet,
“and more than that I’ve cut my fingers all to mince-meat. Well,
well, people at my time of life oughtn't to do nothing. O dear,” she
cried in despair—“the flints they make now-a-days 1”
No 99.

“Give it to me,” said Patty, “I am sure I can get a light.”
“You ! bless the dear child !” cried Mrs. Crumpet, and vigorously
she struck and struck, until striking her knuckles past patience, she
flung the steel and flint upon the bed, where she had thrown me some
minutes before. “Well, if you will have your way you must,” cried
the landlady, and she pushed the tinder-box, as I thought, towards
Patty.
. minute, Patty sat up in bed. Once or twice she struck the
flint; then she was seized with a cough, which compelled her to
desist. Again she essayed. Surely, there was some truth in the
saying of Mrs. Crumpet; the flint was bad—worn out; its fire
quenched. Again and again Patty struck. And now the sparks
come thick It is plain, the rain has spoilt the tinder. No 1 it
kindles Patty—I had been thrown almost within a hand of her—
blows the spark; the fire casts a red hue upon her face, but yet I see
the change. How wan—how thin—how much more like her dead
mother I
The candle is lighted, but the exertion has proved too much for
the girl. She coughs and coughs; and exhausted, yet with such
sweet mildness in her eyes, her face, she sinks back upon what her
landlady would call a pillow.
I looked round the garret.

To MAKE Shoes WATERPRoof.-Take a pound and a half of rose-pink,
an ounce of camphor, with a quart of the liquid in which a rabbit has been
boiled; stir these gently together, and pour the shoes full of the mixture
when you go to bed at night
To TAKE STAINs out of TABLE-LINEN.—Spread the damask cloth on a

direction beyond the edge of the stain. There is another, but more
expensive method, which is, simply, to put the linen into the fire.
A DELICATE LIP-salve.—Wash and grate four carrots, add to these a
dram of assafoetida, and two ounces of Norway tar; tie it down close, and
put into a small saucepan with as much water and ground oyster-shells as
will come to nearly the top of the gallipot. Do not let it boil over; pour
into small boxes for present use.
Paste For CHAPPED HANDs.-At the full of the moon, take a pound

ounce of gum benjamin, one ounce of Florence iris; simmer these
ingredients in a gall-bladder for an hour, then pour off into gallipots. The
application will not only whiten the hands, but produce double joints,
which are so much admired.

THE GRATUITO US EXHIBITIONS OF LONDON.
No. V.-The FOREIGN ANIMALS IN REGENT-STREET.
To the curious Zoologist, who takes delight in contemplating the different
varieties of animal life, there is not a more valuable museum of specimens
from the class Mammalia (order, Primates) than that which is open
every day to public inspection in Regent-street, on the eastern pave-
ments, between the streets of Oxford and Titchborne, of course including
the Quadrant, from about two o'clock in the afternoon to five. There
may, perhaps, be some little question whether this may be called a
strictly gratuitous exhibition, inasmuch as, although nothing is charged
directly for witnessing it, yet somehow or another the objects themselves
are supposed to subsist upon money drawn from the Londoners, in return
for various antics and performances which they from time to time exhibit,
similar to those accomplished by various travelling monkeys; and to these
clever brutes, although upon a large scale, the Foreign Animals in
Regent-street bear no very inapt resemblance.
But let us not be misunderstood with respect to the class we are writing
about. There are many compatriots of the Foreign Animals, now resid-
ing in London, who are men of rare abilities, although, from their retiring
and modest nature, the stranger inay not be aware of the fact in a casual
interview. There are many more, whom oppression and the wrongs of
power have driven from their homes to seek a refuge in our metropolis—
meek, patient beings, with a fine sense of honour, that the keenest priva-
tions and persecuticas have been unable to debase. But the subjects of
our exhibition include the hundreds of unknown alien adventurers—the
chevaliers d’industrie and continental locusts who swarm upon the trottoir
of Regent-street, and, like those devastating insects, in too many cases'
evince their claims to be considered as belonging to the family, by their
indomitable desire to prey upon the green
These curious creatures may be divided into two kinds—the Migrators
and the Hybernators. The first appear on our shores in the early part
of spring, and are synchronous with swallows and small onions: the latter
are presumed to winter in various secluded regions known only to then-
selves, wherein they emulate the chameleon in i. upon air. . And they
also bear some resemblance to the lobster, in respect to the changing of
their envelopes, inasmuch as when that period arrives they seek retired
hiding places, and putting off their summer costume, remain for the rest of
the year in the ancient robe de chambre, of delicate texture and attenuated
substance, the period of whose original fabrication is lost in the moyen age
of continental history. Were it not for this temporary retirement, it
would be absolutely necessary for them to take up more energetic plans
for subsisting, by that species of industry most common to the lower
orders of their countrymen. But this they are too idle to adopt, even in
spite of its lucrative nature—for whatever foreign animals do, is sure to
meet with ample encouragement; and we are convinced that if any seedy
Count or Baron was to take a frequented crossing, he would, ere long,
retire with a very handsome competency. The ladies would regard the
decayed nobleman with interest; and the page would drop the coin into
§: hat with commingled feelings of awe and admiration. But this by
the way.
The best time for seeing the Foreign Animals in Regent-street, is, as
we have stated, from two to five. After that time they disappear for an
interregnum of two or three hours, and do not show again until dusk,
when they sometimes come out in great force. It is presumed, during
this period, that the more wealthy amongst them contrive to dine, at some
of the cheap restaurateurs in the neighbourhood of Leicester-square, where
the sense of smell goes quite as far as that of taste, by the liberality of the
proprietor; and an olfactory meal at a very moderate rate is the result,
which is peculiarly suitable to the pockets of the habitués.
Like cats, the Foreign Animals in Regent-street love to bask in the sun;
like cats also, they dislike getting wet, and it is painful to see their agony
upon the sudden advent of a shower of rain, unless they chance to be near
the Quadrant or the Burlington Arcade. And with the majority, a parallel
may be drawn between them and cheap summer trousers, inasmuch
as they both shrink from washing, although in a different manner.
Many of these animals have been trained by foreign Carters, and Van
Amburghs, to go through singular feats of dexterity ; but these exhibitions

are never gratuitous, unless the spectator is favoured with an order.
Under these circumstances they are worth seeing, and, like the tutored
monkeys before alluded to, who exhibit their antics in fancy costumes,
ertaining properly to neither gender, so some of these foreign animals who
º: been trained to cut capers, wear a low dress and put a wreath of
flowers in their hair, which has a very pleasing effect. Others evince
great dexterity in feats of legerdemain with the keys of pianos; and
others again, like piping bulfinches imported from foreign parts, utter
curious sounds which enchant their hearers: or, having batons placed in
their hands, go through all the postures of an orchestral conductor. But
these exhibitions are very rarely gratuitous, and more frequently exceed-
ingly expensive. For being as slippery, glossy, and insinuating as quick-
silver, these talented creatures work themselves into whatever corners
old can be procured from ; and then amalgamating with the metal, take
it off with them, and it is seen no more in this country.
To those who are curious to view these objects, we recommend that no
time should be lost in so doing—at least, provided always that they can be
seen for nothing. For over a great many of them, an increasing seediness
is gradually creeping, from the inability of their tender frames to stand
the variations of our rough climate (like the monkeys again); and sooner:
or later, we write it with sorrow—this must do them up. And what a
very sad thing it will be, to witness some talented artiste who has thrown
rank, wealth, and beauty into the most extatic transports by his per-
formances, reduced to the poignant necessity of turning a common street
organ for his subsistence 1 But there is every chance of this reverse also
coming to pass, through the unceasing labours of a common-minded set of
people, who will have it that we have native animals who can caper,
tumble, and go through tricks and grimaces with equal facility. Let us
hope, however, that such a sad time is far distant 1

MR. SNOBBINS, OF THE THEATRE Royal, DRURY LANE.
The taste for theatrical biographies being just now prevalent, we feel
Qurselves called upon to cater for it, and we cannot do better than select
Horatio Ernest Snobbins, of Drury Lane Theatre. Snobbins was born
in 1891, so that he was the contemporary of Napoleon Buonaparte,
thºugh, of course, younger than the Emperor. The first account whaw.
of Snobbins taking any part in public affairs is in 1817, when we find his
name in the bills of the Sunderland Theatre for the part of Seton, in
Macbeth, from which we infer that he had studied Shakspere at an early
*ge, and thus we account for that knowledge of the human heart which
he has since displayed as the eleventh priest in Norma and other similar
characters. We now lose sight of him until 1829, when we find him engaged
at Brighton ; and here, as we are told by himself, he some of the
bitterest moments of his existence. He was retained for what was called
“the general utility and small business,” a range with which he had hoped
-in that enthusiasm which is so characteristic of the true artist" that
something might be done, and he accordingly set himself down heart and
soul to study all the messages in the works of the principal dramatists. To
the School for Scandal he had particularly devoted himself, and gave
several weeks' hard study to the genuine piece of comedy in which the
servant announces Sir Peter Teazle to Joseph Surface, in the midst of
the latter's interview with the former's husband. At length, in the
course of business, Snobbins was cast for the wished-for part, in which
he was supported by a London star, who came down to play Joseph.
Snobbins, instead of walking in and delivering the message and walking
out again, came to the front of the stage, rubbed his hands and chuckled,
pointing significantly with his thumb to Joseph Surface and Lady Teazle.

PontRAIt or M.R. snobbins in a characteft that he intended to REPRESENt. |
The “Star,” with that illiberality so common to the profession, seemed
annoyed, and whispered “Go on, sir;” but Mr. Snobbins, with the quick-
ness of lightning, turned the circumstance to his own account, and gave
Joseph Surface one of those pantomimic digs in the side, at the same time
uttering one of those guttural sounds which are usually resorted to on the
stage when the actor is supposed to be enjoying a joke of which the
audience have not yet received the benefit. The London Star turned
contemptuously away, and Snobbins again came down to the front and
again rubbed his hands; but the audience began to hiss, showing how a
great effect may be marred for want of its being “played up to ” by the
other characters. He delivered his message, and made his exit amid a
slight demonstration of disapprobation ; but from that moment Snobbins
|
|
was a disappointed, broken-hearted man. He had endeavoured to act
on Shakspere's advice as to the stage, and to aid in reforming it “alto-
gether,” an expression tºº, intended to º to the “little bits” in
plays, and consequently to the messages. he manager, under the
influence, no doubt, of the London Star, did everything he could to annoy
Snobbins, giving him nothing to do but carry on tea-things, take off chairs,
and wait at banquets. Never was a tea-tray put into Snobbins' hand
but he cursed the profession to which it was his fate to belong, and at last,
in despair, he took to opera. Madame Vestris's keen appreciation of
talent secured Snobbins an engagement, and it was arranged that he
should appear as the fourteenth priest in Norma; this was afterwards
changed to the eleventh, and the rest is known. Norma was played
more than fifty nights in the first season, and repeated to overflowing
houses in the second. Mr. Macready at Drury Lane having subsequently
directed his efforts to opera, strengthened his forces by importing, first,
Mrs. A. Shaw, then Herr Staudigl, and ultimately Him Snobbins, from
the other theatre. The future destination of the “great creature" is
alluded to in another column.
A Hint for the “spec."
The following extract is from the Spectator, May 13, 1843.
“Edwin LAND's EER contributes only to the department of portraiture, which this
ear falls lower than ever: his Portrait of the Honourable Ashley Ponsonby, (100,) a
y on a pony, with dogs and dead rabbits, is one of his least striking works; and his
two Horses, (314.) The in HEAD's 1Nstinct with Lire, ADD Little to his Reru-
TAtion; they furnish a standard, however, by which to estimate the feebleness,” &c. &c.
Surely our murmuring cotemporary should change its title to the
Col. D-WATER Advocate.
Wonderful Instinct.—When the Queen left Buckingham Palace to take
her first airing since the late interesting event, the horses (such is the force of
habit!) instinctively went towards Drury Lane Theatre.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WANTED–SOME BISHOPS 1
The RE must be a statue of virgin gold—a colossal statue, too,
wigged and gowned—to Henry, Bishop of ExETER. He has, with a
cat's-leap, jumped at the identical cause of all our social evils. All
our sufferings arise from a dearth of Bishops. This delicious, soul-
reviving truth, was published a few days since in the House of Lords;
though we regret to say—the regret, by the bye, is leavened with a
touch of pride—that Punch has been the first to acknowledge it. The
Bishop of ExETER observed—
“Holding, as he did, that episcopacy was necessary for the church, the first considera-
tion ought to be, how was it to be made most effectual for the whole church 2 . When
such a question was put, the answer suggested itself instantly—it could only be done by
having a sufficient number of bishops. The church required far more than were now in
; They ought not to be content with adding to her strength only a single
This avowal is especially curious—as valuable, too, as curious.
That a bishop himself should hold “ episcopacy necessary” is, in
itself, an extraordinary instance of mingled intelligence and disin-
terestedness. A certain bishop was once asked, “what he thought
of original sin " “Sir” replied the bishop, “I think we should have
done very well without it.” It is plain that if Henry of Exeter were
asked what he thought of episcopacy, his answer would not be in the
same spirit with the above response He is quite right, too, in the
comprehensiveness of his design. What is one bishop Troubles, it
is said, never come singly: why, then, should blessings? There is a
pitiful, sneaking spirit in adding, “only a single bishop;” when the
whole country abounds with the raw material of which bishops, ad
infinitum, might be manufactured. A man with an acre of well-
stocked cellars might as well limit his guests to one bottle, as ministers
treat the country to only a single bishop. Falstaff, in the triumph of
his passion, cried, “Now, let it rain potatoes 1" Punch, with like
hilarity, exclaims—“Let it drizzle bishops 1"
It is impossible for the most superficial biped of this most super-
ficial age—for as those who follow us will abuse their times, why should
not we have a fling at our own —not to observe, and observing, rejoice
at—the miracles of goodness worked in society by the example of
even our present limited stock of bishops “If"—as the fellow cried
who vended peppermint-drops in a hard frost—“if one will warm
you, what will a pound do 1" Now, if we are so very good—if there
be so much virtue abounding in the land with the few bishops at
present vouchsafed to us, how excellent shall we be—what a super-
fluity of goodness shall we have for exportation, if the voice of
HENRY of ExETER prevail, and clouds of lawn “turn forth their
silver lining” on the darkness of this stumbling generation ?
Consider, reader, what it is to create a bishop. You take a man
by force from a humbler service in the Christian sheep-fold; and
whilst he declares nolo episcopari, -with both his hands and all his
voice exclaims against the benevolent violence that heaps wealth
and worldly honours upon him, whilst, despite all his spiritual
strugglings to get away, you tie upon him the episcopal apron, force
into his unwilling hand a banker's book, and make him a lord
spiritual, you at once elevate forlorn humanity, only that its hu-
mility may beam forth with sweeter radiance. You give wealth and
honours to a man, only that he may share the gold with the miserable,
and prove by his meekness how poor is all mundane greatness com-
pared to the aggrandizement to come. In a word, when you make
another bishop, you add to the uncanonized saints.
Is not this proved—blessedly proved—by the experience of every
day? Go where we will, do we not see the golden fruits of episcopal
teaching The Bench of Bishops—with an exquisite obedience to
the divine precept—never will let the good they do be known.
Nevertheless, much of their active benevolence must declare itself.
Is famine howling and gnashing its idle teeth in the land Away
goes the bishop to the homes of the suffering; and with pious words,
and more, with part of his own substance, he straightway solaces the
wretched. Is sickness in the poor man's house ! The bishop sits by
the bed of the sufferer—prays with him—for him, and by all those
nameless acts of brotherly love which draw forth the better sym-
pathies of men,_proves to his smitten fellow that the episcopacy of
the nineteenth century is vital with all that loving-kindness which
consecrated anno domini 1. Do we not meet bishops in pestilent
courts where typhus breeds—in the cellars of manufacturing towns,
where Christian men and women are huddled like beasts Do we
not there find these radiant elder sons of orthodoxy—these “bright
ones” of the bench—despoiling themselves of their own comforts
for the solace of the wretched In a word, what is a bishop—say
the Bishop of Exet ER for instance—what is he but the almoner to
the poor The richer his diocese, the happier for the humble souls
abounding in it. If you could give a bishop, aye #1,000,000 a year,
you would make the very best use of the money, for nobody would
know how much the poor would have of it. Therefore, let Bishops
be increased and multiplied. What should we be without them
We shudder to think of it—no better than Quakers; and they, it is
well known, for the want of the oil and honey bestowed by bishops,
are a most pugnacious, quarrelsome set of people, who would, in-
deed, be a great social mischief, if so many of them, urged by their
propensities for blood and slaughter, did not enlist into the army, and
help to man our fighting frigates.
Henry of ExETER further observed, that though he would make
a greater number of bishops, he would not give them seats in Parlia-
ment.—No.
“He was quite content that the number should remain as it was, and it would not be
without a precedent to see a bishop without a seat in that house.”
We here strongly protest against this. It is necessary—highly
necessary—that every bishop should have a seat in the Lords, for how
useful—how beneficent is their influence, throwing as they do, the
oil of Canaan on the troubled waters of political strife—mingling as
they do, the honey of Christian charity with the bitterness of party
zeal. Is a war about to be waged Do not the Bishops rise one by
one—and with voices clear and awful as the silver trumpets of
cherubim—denounce the unchristian act? Do they not paint war in
all its haggard wretchedness—its ghastly wrong—its agony—its
defilement Do they not conjure up to the startled imaginations of
their hearers the terrors of the sacked city—the murdered matrons
—outraged virgins, and infants writhing on the pikes of a blasphem-
ing soldiery Did they not one and all do this at the commencement
of the Chinese war, prophecying the horrors to come, with such fear-
ful eloquence, that even “the iron Duke” wept drops of burning
metal, (which Lord BRoug HAM in his admiration of the warrior
has since had mounted for shirt-studs )
Is there any tyranny, vast or petty, done or contemplated at home !
At the very whisper of the wrong, up rises a Bishop in the House of
| Lords, and with Heaven-gifted eloquence champions the wretched.
Is there one Bishop of the whole Bench, who is not a very NATHAN
pleading with resistless speech for the one “ewe lamb” of the
English pauper, outraged and despoiled by the tyranny of wealth
Are not the speeches of the Bishops on Poor Law iniquities written
in leaves of brass? Even Lord BRough AM owns as much ; and
|Heaven knows he is an indisputable judge of the material.
An Act of Parliament would be a poor, profane thing, unless blessed
by a bishop. In the Lords, the Bishops say prayers over the statutes
(as my Lord's chaplain always says grace over meat.) It is for this
reason that our English laws are all so exquisitely perfect: that they
are all informed, and sublimated with such charity towards the poor—
such tenderness for their infirmities—such compassion for the in-
evitable inequalities of human nature :
The readers of Punch may remember a report of a late meeting of
the Bishops, drawn together by the miseries in the manufacturing
districts. This report was strangely overlooked by our active—and
Punch is not ashamed to own it—formidable rival The Times. Well,
the Bishops immediately went into the distressed districts; and the
public is yet to be astonished by the report of their doings How
they went from coal-mine to coal-mine—from cottage to cottage—
soothing, assuaging, comforting, relieving the poor
The Catholic Church has her hundred legends of the liberality of
her saints, who have stripped themselves to clothe the naked pauper.
But with all her triumphs—amidst all her relics, can she show the
pawnbroker's duplicate of a Bishop's watch, left with the Lombardy
merchant in default of ready money, for hard cash wherewith to
relieve the poor -
(We would not raise an honest blush upon the cheek of a benevo-
lent man. But this much we must say. Since the Bishop of ExETE it
left town for that Christian expedition, he has never been seen with
his gold repeater.)
Shall we then deny to Henry of ExETER even a multitude of
Bishops ? Certainly not ; and therefore, let there be circulated
throughout every village where a curate vegetates, handbills with
these words—
Q
“WANTED–SoME Bishops 1”
Change of Residence.
We are requested to state that the distinguished Bohemians, Gipsy Cooper
and family, have left the road-side on Fetcham-common for a sheltered spot in
Sunninghill-lane, near Ascot, where they will remain during the races.

JENKINS AGAIN, AND IN A NEW CAPACITY :
MR. Punch,-SIR,-You have on various occasions proved to the satis-
faction of your readers that Jenkins—the immortal Jenkins—has, by the
gentleness and nobility of his nature, placed himself at the head of the
aristocracy of footmen. Now, Mr. Punch, I happen to be one of those
who felt disposed to doubt Jenkins's claim to so dignified a position, until,
upon reading the Morning Post a few days ago, I discovered the following
matrimonial announcement, which must have emanated from the most
influential and romantic of gentlemen's gentlemen.
“on the 18th of May, at St. Geºg': Church, Hanover Square, Mr. S-, butler
to his Grace the Archbishop of A––h, to the elegant and accomplished Miss W-,
milliner and dressmaker, of — Street, Mayfair!!”
Can there be any doubt that the gentle Jenkins “gave the bride away,”
and that he afterwards drew up the announcement of the marriage 1
Yours to command, Lynx.
DREAMS FOR THE MILLION.
HE Dreamers are a large class. Some dream
wide awake—some fast asleep–whilst others,
whether asleep or awake, are always dreaming.
Who is there that has not longed to know
what his dream portended The ancients be-
lieved in dreams. They looked upon them as con-
fidential communications, and did not act upon
them the less for coming anonymously. They
had Commissioners, whose business it was to
read and answer the dreams of those who had
never been properly taught to dream. Emperors
were their clients, and Solons their customers.
The Future was to them as legible as the Pre-
sent, and the Past as familiar as the Future.
Their fingers, like needles, had each an eye at
the end of them, and whatever they touched they
saw through immediately. The Emperor Au-
gustus deposited every grain of faith in their decrees, and chartered them
as a savings.bank for the dreams of the whole nation. Every one who
dreamt of anything relating to the State, was bound instantly to make a
clean bosom of it to his Dream Commissioners,who translated, then published
the dream for the benefit of the public. But who can tell at present what
he dreams 1 Mans knowledge, that has wrestled with all things, from a
comet to an earthquake, has shown a strange cowardice on the subject
of dreams. It would seem as if he thought that a science which grew in
darkness could lead to nothing better, and therefore was content to leave
it in the same state in which he found it. Punch disdains such cowardice,
and with the true daring of his nature, advances to take the lead in a path
that has never been trodden by a scientific Blucher before. To all
devout believers in dreams, he offers, in the refined benevolence of his
heart, the following Dictionary, confident that it is the kernel out of which
future encyclopaedias will grow. -

laced themselves in all sorts of positions to await their “turn.” The
ollowing was the routine. His Honour first called on the easy chairs ;
then, skipping the back bench, took the fender ; he then went through
the juniors on the back row, and called upon the chimney-piece, after
which he intimated his readiness to hear the sideboard, and concluded
with the window-sill. The Vice-Chancellor, perceiving a knot of counsel
at the door, expressed his intention of going through the vestibule
before the close of the day; and having asked if any 5. on the
hob had anything to move, he took all the motions on the mat, and con-
cluded all the business previous to his rising.
LAURIE OUT-LAURIED.
In the police report of the Mansion House of May 27, we find the
following :-
-- i. Whithair said he acted under the orders of the visiting magis-
trates. Sir Peter Laurie had called at the Compter, and directed that
until the Gaol Committee should take the case into consideration, the
barber should be ALLowed To shave ALL THE OTHER PRISONERs, BUT NOT
To shave HIMSELF.”
This is too good! Punch throws down his pen in despair
-
RATHER EQUIVOCAL.
The foreign correspondent of the Herald observes, “Qu the following
day the Sultan expressed his readiness to receive the heads of the Servian
Government.” Considering the style in which heads are not unfrequently
resented to Sultans, the position of the Servian Government seems to
É. been rather an awkward one. We believe they took the precaution
to ascertain whether the polite invitation addressed to their “heads” was
to be considered as extending to their “bodies."

POETRY OF THE PAVEMENTS.
I.—The WOOD.
Air—“ Vive le Roi / "
Though it makes not aches or shakes,
But is silent as straw,
Hocks it sprains, and knees it breaks,
Vive le bois / Vive le bois /
At the risk Sir Peter quakes
Full of awe, full of awe;
And another road he takes,
Vive le bois / Vire le he is t
Though it makes, &c.
Ancient hacks of idle tricks,
Sur le bois / Sur le bois /
Cut their sticks as quick as bricks,

Though Sir Peter disapprove,
He may jaw, he may jaw;
For the slowest coach will move
On the bois, on the bois / .
Ancient hacks, &c.
NO. 2.--THE STONES.
Air—“ The Sea.”
The stones 1 the stones! the noisy stones :
O'er which I travel with moans and groans.
Some years ago, they had a bound,
But “off the stones” can't now be found.
They're better than wood, some madman cries,
It's all a mistake, the creature lies.
I'm on the stones 1 I'm on the stones
I jump and I jolt, and I bruise my bones,
With a rattle above, and a row below,
And deaf with noise where'er I go ;
If sleepy, I wish'd a few winks to take,
What matter, the clatter would keep me wide awake.
No. 3.--THE MACADAMized.
Air—“ The Monks of Old.”
MANY have told of the roads of old,
What a swamp of muck they were ;
But a Macadam way, on a rainy day,
Would make a street-sweeper swear.
For it goes beyond the Slough of Despond,
In its hopeless state of slush ;
And it grows, ha! haſ to your clothes, ha! hal
In spite of the hardest brush.
And when it is fine, if the sun should shine,
You’re no better off than before :
For it turns to dust, and at every gust
It settles in every pore.
And it tries, as it dries, in a cloud to rise,
And peppers your coat and your hat;
And it flies, ha! haſ in your eyes, ha! hal
And makes you as blind as a bat.
Geography and Music.
At the Royal Geographical Society, the golden medal was presented to
Lieut. J. F. A. Symonds, of the Royal Engineers, for his triangles in
Syria, which have determined the situation of many of the most interesting
places in the Holy Land. We understand that Snooks, of the Grenadiers,
means to ask a prize for his double drum in the Green Park, the noise of
which always determines the spot where the band is playing.
A far-fetched Joke.
The Princess Clementine and Prince Augustus were met on their
arrival at Brest by the Maritime Prefect. This official, it is presumed,
was thought the best adapted to meet a newly-married couple. The reader
who is on the look-out for a joke will observe that it was the maritime
(marry-time) prefect.
FashionABLE DEPARTURE.-Mr. Cribby Walker left the Police station
near the Grand Stand for the Croydon Roundhouse, immediately after the
conclusion of the Derby. We believe the cause of his sudden absence was
an unlucky speculation in the transfer of some property effected during the
race, when several sums changed hands, as well as after it.
†Bramatit intelligenſt.
MR. SNoBBINs played on Thursday last, the ninth of the Aruspices in
Sappho, being his last appearance but five for the present season. In the
great scene of the third act, where all the Aruspices execrate Sappho,
Mr. Snobbins was great His hand trembled with rage—his features were
distorted with hate, while his foot—showing the musician—beat time to
the music. He was tolerably well seconded by Miss Clara Novello.
We have heard it whispered that Mr. Snobbins is in treaty with the
management of the Surrey, where he will appear as the second peasant in
La Somnambula. It is not generally known that he was the original in
this delightful opera. He, however, had not the advantage—like another
gentleman we could name— of Malibran's tuition. Whatever Snobbins does
is his own—dug with the pickaxe of tact from the soil of his own genius.
PUNCH'S LABOURS OF HERCULES.
CHAP. III.--THE THIRD LABOU R.—HOW HERCULES CAPTURED THE
BUCK OF THE Brazen cou NtENANce.
t is not to be supposed that Hercules could have gone on
choking lions, crushing reptiles, and exterminating mon-
sters in general, without attracting some attention.
The public in general, however, contrary to their ac-
customed behaviour to those who sought their good, whom
they were wont to pelt, and hang, and poison, and persecute,
unanimously called our hero a fine fellow. “Hercules
for ever !” was chalked, painted, and printed up, on
every dead wall and barrier. His more ardent admirers
wanted to get him into Parliament, and several flags
inscribed with “Vote for Hercules 1" were displayed
from divers windows. All public-houses entitled the
“Pillars of Hercules” began to be much frequented; and
at some of these, mystic games, called orirraes, were in-
stituted in his honour. Each orittae was fashioned in the shape of
a human head, which bore a resemblance to some one or other well-
known representative of a particular class of monsters, which, it was
hoped, he would speedily overthrow.
One day a procession, headed by the Lord Mayor of London, and
including all the members of the Corporation, together with a large
number of other tradesmen, craftsmen, and mechanics, waited with
much form and ceremony on the hero. Hercules received them with
great dignity, and on their spokesman intimating that he had some-
thing to say, graciously desired him to say on. Then the Lord Mayor
pulled a paper out of his pocket, and putting his spectacles on his
nose, gave a short cough, and read to the effect following :-
“May it please your Divinity,
“Whereas your mightiness, in time past, as we are credibly
informed by our reverend chaplain, and divers others, learned men
and great clerks, was graciously pleased to pursue, entrap, and catch,
a certain STAe, of incredible swiftness, golden horns, and brazen feet,
and to deliver the same, firmly bound and secured, into the custody
of your mightiness's brother Eurystheus: which St AG did crop, des-
poil, and lay waste the pastures and meadows of GEnoe, to the no
small damage and detriment of the shepherds and graziers of that
region and the neighbourhood. And whereas, now, a certain Buck,
or Male-deer, also with horns (to our cost) richly gilt, and though
not having feet of brass, yet being of a brazen face; moreover ex-
ceedingly swift, so that no man may catch him, and withal of extreme
subtlety, doth, in like manner, nibble, bite, and devour, the herbage
of a certain field to us appertaining, commonly called the Field of
Commerce: We, the undersigned, the Lord Mayor, Corporation,
Merchants, Bankers, Tradesmen, and others of the City of London, in
the County of Middlesex, do humbly beg, entreat, and implore, your
mightiness, that you would graciously vouchsafe also to pursue,
catch, and entrap, the said Buck, and deliver the same, likewise
firmly bound and secured, into the hands and custody of our Sheriffs
of London and Middlesex; to be by them dealt with according to the
law in such case made and provided. And your petitioners, as in
duty bound, will ever pray.”
Then followed a host of signatures.
Hercules, having with much gravity and condescension, patiently
listened to the above oration, politely requested his lordship to be
more explicit ; protesting that he could not, for the life and soul of
him, comprehend what he had been driving at. Whereupon the
Lord Mayor, being now out of breath, his clerk proceeded in terms
rather less enigmatical to explain the object of the petition.
He informed Hercules that the Buck complained of was a human
Buck, the type or pattern of a genus, and that he derived his name
from his outward man, which was what was commonly denominated

a “fashionable exterior,” that is, the exterior of a Buck. That the
brazenness cf his face was a metaphorical expression signifying its
unchanging nature, and indicating singular coolness and impertur-
bability of mind. That the gold on his horns represented booty and
pillage, and was intended to distinguish him from certain other Bucks
whose horns were said to be green: That his nibbling and biting in
the Field of Commerce meant divers depredations, which, by craft
and stratagem he perpetrated on the goods, chattels, and substance
of commercial men. And that his great swiftness of foot related to
a remarkable facility of absconding, by means of which, after playing
off one of his tricks, he would transfer himself in less than no time
to France or America, and that he had a great many disguises,
military, naval, and foreign: and thus ended his speech.
The hero affected for a few moments to be reading over the sig-
natures. He was only thinking. Presently, he rose, and having
glanced his penetrating eye over the deputation, delivered himself
as follows:
“My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen,
“I shall have much pleasure in acceding (substantially) to
your request, and in doing my best to settle the hash—that is to say,
the venison—of this very troublesome and mischievous Buck. You
will please, however, to allow me to manage this matter my own
way. As to consigning him to the custody of your Sheriffs of London
and Middlesex, I cannot undertake to do that, because it strikes mefor-
cibly that the officers of those gentlemen will very shortly be sinecures,
in which case I know you too well to suppose that you will continue
them ; so that you may expect, before any long time shall have elapsed,
to have no Sher-
iffs at all.”
Here the
members of the
deputation ge-
nerally ex-
changed blank
looks, and the
visages of the
civic dignitaries
—some of whom
gave audible
grunts of dis-
satisfaction —
became visibly
inflamed, which
Hercules, not
marking, conti-
nued :—
“Now, gen-
tlemen, before
I take any mea-
sures for the
capture of this
Buck, I must
insist upon a
little exertion
on your own
parts with a
view to protect
this Field of
Commerce, as
you call it, from
his depreda-
tions. I am not
going to waste
my immortal
breath in chas-
ing him for some twelvemonths, perhaps to no manner of purpose,
and with the certainty of having to recommence my pursuit of some
other individual of his tribe equally obnoxious with himself at the end
of it. You must famish and debilitate him, gentlemen; him and all
his kin, and then I will see what I can do for you. And now, attend.
How is it, I ask, that this Buck,--or, I may as well call him by his
real name, Sw1NDLER, is enabled to prey upon you ? Why—you
addle-brained, pudding-pated, turtle-witted noodles—because you are
stupid enough to let him. How is it that you do not recognise him
the instant you see him Why—and you have been told this before
—because your brains are in your breeches' pockets. Do you suppose
that every rogue has not his name written in his countenance for
those who can read? It repels you from his eye—it disgusts you in
his smirk—it grates upon your ear in his very voice. I am a demi-god,
but with half my wit—which is that of a mere man, I could detect a
swindler instantly. For instance, there,” (here Hercules rose and
pointed with his fore-finger to an individual present,) “there is a
swindler I Do you not see the snake, the vulture, and the fox
branded in his every lineament Do you not, I say?”
Hercules paused. Every eye was directed towards the object thus
denounced. He was a Jew bill-discounter. The creature looked as
if blasted by a thunderbolt. His eyes were fixed and wide open, his
face like whitewash, and his grinning lips livid as a mulberry. His
knees knocked together, and his whole frame shook like a jelly in
convulsions.
“Vanish, scoundrel !” thundered the hero. The caitiff lost no time
in obeying ; and hastening frantically into the street, ran his head
against a lamp-post. He was taken up, labouring under concussion of
the brain, and having been bled, physicked, and blistered accordingly,
turned Christian on recovery, and gave away all he had to a hospital.
“There " resumed Hercules, “I was right, you see. Now all you
have to do to become just as good a physiognomist as I am, is just to
devote a little of that time which you lay out upon your ledgers and
day-books to looking about you, studying mankind, and cultivating
those Mammon-muddled, dross-defiled, twopenny-halfpenny intellects
of yours. And, now, get out with you !” So saying, Hercules descended
from his throne, and catching up his footstool, flung it at their heads,
which he afterwards belaboured with his club to such purpose, that
they speedily beat their retreat. Rubbing their pates, they made
the best of their way home, and when they got there, took care to
act upon his suggestions.
-
The result was, that the race of Swindlers in the course of a few
months became quite extinct, all except one. He had been the
great Buck swindler of his day, but he was now become a mere
starveling and tatterdemalion. Hercules, in taking a walk one day,
caught sight of him through a dusty window, dining at a wretched
eating-house in the New Cut. The hero watched his opportunity;
and as the sorry wretch, the shadow of his former self, was “bolting,”
as Hercules foresaw that he would, without having discharged his
reckoning, he seized him, almost unresisted, by the collar. He would
not commit him to a gaol, well knowing that he would go out a
greater rogue than he went in ; and he considered the workhouse
too bad even for a swindler. So having given him a wholesome taste
of his emendatory club, he put a few guineas into his pocket and
shipped him off to Australia.

jasbiomable intelligentt.
Wh understand that the elopement which has occasioned such a sensa-
tion, the parties being a young lady and a member of an itinerant band, is
likely to give employment to the gentlemen of the white letters, and the
capes of oilskin. The lady's attention was first attracted by the extraor-
dinary command exercised by the gentleman over an ophycleide, on which
he occasionally executed a solo. The lady is entitled to a considerable
fortune by her mother's side, but the gentleman's property is tied up in
the hands of a most paternal uncle. He is only entitled “to take,” as the
ławyers say, “by equity of redemption.”
,THE LAST NEW Bonnet.
Messrs Dobrees, the pawnbrokers, have been issuing cards all the
week for a soirée, which is expected to be very numerously attended on
Saturday.
Among the audience at the Victoria Theatre on Monday last, were
Baron Nathan and suite. The Baron occupied a place in the pit, and the
suite—his assistant—who sat in the gallery, afforded much amusement by
a very perilous pas on the outside of the iron railing.
Another Seizure of Foreign Goods.
The whole of the French pieces now performing at the St. James's
Theatre have been seized at the abode of a well-known playwright. The
villain made no defence. He was engaged in a desperate attempt to put
the English mark upon them. He has been fully committed to the station
for incorrigible dramatic offenders in the New Cut, where he is to take
his trial. Mr. Osbaldiston's company will all appear, to give evidence
against him. He urges the old plea of physical and intellectual destitution.

EDUCATION OF THE ROYAL INFANTS.
The public will observe with much satisfaction the appearance above
the walls of the garden of P. Palace, two green wooden uprights,
with a rope's end attached to each of them. On making inquiry, we have
discovered that the objects in question belong to a swing which has been
erected in the garden for the use of the Royal Infants. By this admirable
arrangement it will be inculcated into their minds at an early age, that
even princes are subjected in this life to ups and downs, and that we must
all go backward as well as forward ; a truth that cannot be too soon im-
pressed on the understanding of infancy.
PUNCH'S PROPHECY FOR THE DERBY.
PUNCH has been requested to name the Winner of the Derby, but in
order to prevent disappointment, he begs to state that his prophecy,
which is to be implicitly relied on, is—postponed until after the excite-
ment of the race is over. At the risk, however, of being right, and not
caring whether he is wrong, he begs leave to name Newcourt as the first
or second horse, because Punch likes to be original, and no one else has
named Newcourt as the winner.
The Punch Races.
The following were entered for the Derby Day, but by arrangelneut
were transferred to the Hoar.
Mr. Snooks's black filly Brokenknees, got, by Overwork, out of Con-
dition.
CoMpaRATIVE ANATOMY.
Mr. Jones's galled jade Wincer, betting 00 to 000 (taken).
Mr. Tomkins's hackney coach-horse Roarer; got, by Difficulty, out of
Stable.
The above three were the only horses that started: the stakes consisting
of half a feed of corn, with a handful of hay added. Brokenknees went
off at a canter, and fell. Roarer stood stock still, when Wineer, beginning
to jib, the jockey turned her round, and backed her cleverly to the winning
post. This was the best race of the day; and though the bets were not
large, a good deal of money changed hands, and even for pocket-hand-
kerchiefs there were several takers.
The proprietors of Punch celebrated the Derby in the office, and gave a
handsome stake (rump, with, &c.) to be run for by the boy and the pub-
lisher. The course was once round the counter, passing the till, and the
letter-box was the winning post. Betting had been in fivour of Dick, who
went off at a slapping pace, clearing the office stool at one bound, while the
publisher followed, neck or nothing, right through the back numbers, and
was first at the till, but a customer coming in at the time, the publisher's
attention was taken off, and Dick walking cleverly up to the steaks,
quietly devoured them.
The Landlords' plate was afterwards run for in a great heat, and
carried off by Waiter out of Tavern.
We see by the Liverpool Albion that there is an important flaw in the
grinding act. There are so many grinding acts, that it would be as well if our
contemporary would state in which of them the flaw has been discovered.
In consequence of numerous complaints received from all parts of the country as to
the difficulty in procuring the Weekly Numbers of PUNCH, the Proprietors have
determined to print a STAMPED EDITION, (price 4d.) which may be sent free by
Post, commencing with Number LXXX. It will be Published every Friday
Evening, and may be procured through any Newsman, or by direct application to the
office, No. 194, Strand. In the latter case, a Post Office Order for payment must be
enclosed. As only a sufficient number of copies to supply the demand will be stamped,
early application is particularly requested. The Pub -- of the Unstamped
Edition, and of the Monthly Parts, trill be continued precisely as heretofore.

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAPter kx1.
MRS. CRUMPET, AND PATTY. —CRAMP, THE CARD-MAKER.
My first introduction to Patty had made me acquainted with the
gloom and wretchedness of a London garret. I was, nevertheless,
startled by the extreme misery about me. The room was rather a
nook, a hole for useless lumber, than a place for a human being.
The landlady, a little woman, could scarcely stand upright beneath
the slanting roof; the gusty wind shook the small latticed window,
and entered through broken panes, defying the rags and paper
thrust therein to keep it out. In a corner, on the bare floor, was the
bed or mat; and there, beneath a web of a blanket, lay Patty Butler.
Poor thing ! After my first surprise, I took a sad pleasure from her
wasted face : I heard sweet music from her feeble voice. They are
changing, I thought ; happily changing. A few more heavy days—
some few restless, fevered nights, and that poor creature, dowered
with the gentlest, purest spirit, will smile down upon the injustice and
iniquities of a world that now casts her, like a useless weed, into its
foulest places.
As I continued to gaze upon her, I felt a strange curiosity to know
her history since we last met. There was something, more than the
pain of sickness in her face. Was it shame, I asked ; and imme-
diately felt mean for the suspicion. Had her affections been snared
by heartless device—or had she, secretly, nurtured a love that, in its
very hopelessness, consumed her ? Yearning for sympathy where the
world would sneer and mock at the desire, had she, in dumbness,
suffered that inward bleeding of the heart, whereof more die than
coroners dream off There was a sad story in that shrunken face.
The history of the world is made of battles—conquests—the acces-
sions and the deaths of beings—the doings of statesmen, and the tricks
of law. This makes the vulgar story of the external world. Its
deeper history is of the hearts, even of its lowest dwellers—of the
ennobling impulses that swell them—of the unconquerable spirit of
meekness which looks calmly upon terror, and turns even agony to
patience. A London alley might produce a more glorifying herald-
ry—if emotions could be quartered—than Poictiers or Blenheim.
IIow many a man, whose only history is written in a baptismal re-
gister and undertaker's account, has conquered suffering, stronger
in its onset than a squadron If true magnanimity awarded knight-
hood, how many who want even shoe-leather, have won their spurs
With these thoughts passing in me, I continued to contemplate
the poor girl before me. She lay wholly exhausted by the effort of
striking the light ; whilst Mrs. Crumpet, with characteristic consi-
deration for the weakness of her lodger, attempted not to disturb
her, but, with due self-preservation, fortified her own system with a
glass of wine—with another—and another. This done, she spoke.
“Well, I'm sure, my dear, if you'd only have let me known that
you nad such a friend about you, do you think I'd ever have put you
in this room ; Bless you ! child, what do you think I'm made of 1
You might have staid in the other apartment.”—(This, I afterwards
found, was only the next garret, but then the casement was whole;
the bed was of decent flock; it had more than one blanket, and had
the elevation of a truckle.)
“Thank you, this will do very well,” replied Patty, with an
effort; “very well—for my time.”
“As I'm a Christian, you sha’n’t sleep here another night,” an-
swered Mrs. Crumpet, with vivacity. “No : I promised the gentle-
man to do all I could for you, and my word's my bond. Well, if you
don't remind me of my dear lost child, Maria 1" Here the landlady
wiped probably a tear from her eye, and again lifted the glass.
“What gentleman do you speak of t” asked Patty, with a con-
cerned look.
“There ! now—if I hav'n't blabbed ; and I promised never to say
a word about him. But he is a gentleman—a real one; nothing
sham in him, my dear: and more than all, you’ve only to get well—
and haſ haſ why you look better while I talk to you, and you’ve a
colour in your face that a Duchess might give her ears for 1–Well,
as I was saying, you’ve only to get well, to be made a lady of.”
“Pray tell me—pray do Of what gentleman do you speak I
know no one—no one, who—” and, excited by the manner of her
landlady, Patty lay incapable of further speech; and her heart—I
was sure of it—fluttered like a bird.
“Come, child,” cried the gossip, “you're faint—only a little faint.
I’ve brought you some wine; a glass—one little glass—will make
Jou alive again.”
* I thank you—none—none,” said Patty feebly.
“But you must, my love; you shall, my darling,” exclaimed Mrs
Crumpet, and she stooped towards the bed, with the bottle and glass
“There,” she cried, filling—“and if I stay here all night, you shall,
my angel, drink it.”
Patty cast a help ess look towards the landlady, and then resigning
herself to the nece sity, raised herself in bed. She stretched her
hand towards the glass, and all eady had the liquor at her lips.
“Hal” chuckled Mrs. Crumpet, “if the gentleman who brought
that wine for you, could only see you now.”—Patty instantly with-
drew the glass, and in a faint, yet determined voice, said—“I will
not taste a single drop.”
“But you must, my cherub,” cried Mrs. Crumpet, with renewed
vigour.
É Not a drop,” repeated Patty, “until you let me know to whom
I am to owe it.”
“Fiddlesticks 1” exclaimed the landlady; “that you’ll know
some day, and that shortly, if you’ll only make yourself well and
hearty. Come, drink the wine, child.”
“No,” said Patty, with calm purpose, and she placed the glass
upon the floor.
Again and again, Mrs. Crumpet tried to prevail, but Patty was
obdurate ; she would not taste the wine until informed of the donor
This knowledge Mrs. Crumpet refused to communicate: let me, how
ever, do the poor woman justice. I verily believe, she would have
hesitated not a second to gratify her tenant, but for one circumstance
she had not the means. She was as ignorant of the benefactor who
had left the wine and money as was Patty herself. She, therefore
with the cunning of an experienced gossip, thought she might guess
the person of the stranger, could she only know her lodger's previous
history. This she had often endeavoured, but in vain, to learn. In
the present instance, she determined to make an indirect levy upon
Patty's gratitude; and, therefore, resolved to impart to her the history
of Mrs. Cramp in advance for Patty's own. To this politic end she
bent her discourse.
“Well, my dear, I don't know if you ar'n't right. But who'd have
thought that anybody so young should have such caution—Ha! if my
good friend, Mrs. Cramp had been like you ! You’ve seen Mrs. Cramp
my dear?”
“I have heard you speak of her,” said Patty, whose thoughts wen
plainly far away from the subject talk of her landlady.
“To be sure; I’d forgot—you never have. Well, she was here to
night. She's been to a rout of some sort, and so she was obliged tº
come here to dress.”
“To dress t” said Patty languidly.
“Bless you, yes: I keep all her fine things for her. You see, she's
married to a man forty years older than she ; and though everybody
thought he was dying when she had him, he's only dying now. Well,
although he's as rich as King Solomon, he won’t let his wife have a
decent rag upon her. And so, poor soul there’s nothing left to her
but to cheat her husband right and left.”
“Cheat him—her husband 1" asked Patty.
“And, as luck would have it, he's bedrid, why it’s cheating made
quite easy, my dear. The worst of it is for poor Mrs. Cramp,
although she's heaps of fine things, she mustn't wear them in her own
house. There, she must look no better than a cinder-wench ; or else
the old villain might go out of the world with malice in his heart
peril his own precious soul, and cut the wife of his bosom out of his
whl. Well, my dear, that would be dreadful, wouldn't it f" asked
Mrs. Crumpet in a tone that peremptorily called for an answer.
“Yes,” replied Patty, almost unconsciously.
“And so to hinder that, whenover Mrs. Cramp goes out, she comes
here to dress, and then comes back and shifts her finery for her old
clothes to go home in. That’s tricking the miser, isn't it?” cried the
landlady with a laugh.
“Doubtless,” answered Patty.
“Now, here's this beautiful feather,” and Mrs. Crumpet took me
up, “she's bought it quite a bargain. But do you think she might
show it to old Cramp Bless you, she might as soon take a croco-
dile into the house. Well, thank goodness 1 the old villain has his
reward. Bless you, his conscience must be as full of holes as a
cullender. The devil's always at his bedside, that’s one comfort.”
“What do you mean What crimes has the poor man commit-
ted t” asked Patty.
“Why, no crimes in particular, as you and I should think 'em :
only you see, he made all his money by making packs of cards.
Now, in his old age, he's turned so shocking religious ! You'd never
believe it ; but he thinks he's haunted by all the Kings and Queens
he ever passed across his counter. He vows they all peep in and
gnash their teeth at him through the bed-curtains; and once—you'd

ha’ died a laughing to hear him, for 'twas nothing but the fleas, my
dear—once he swore he was bitten all over by the Jack of clubs.”
“Poor man 1" said Patty.
“Ha! if poor Mrs. Cramp had only known him afore she married
And that brings me back to what I was going to say, that it was so
proper in you not to take the wine, afore you knew who sent it.”
“Then you will tell me?” asked Patty.
“To be sure, I will, when you tell me how it was that you, with
such friends, should ever have wanted anything. How was it that
you came in such a pickle to me ! Without a farthing—without a sº
“My story is not worth the telling—is nothing,” said Patty.
“La 1" cried Mrs. Crumpet, unconscious of the truth she uttered,
“there's nobody as hasn't a story, if they knew how to tell it. You
must have had comforts about you.”
“I have found friends—dear, kind friends, in my worst of afflic-
tions,” answered Patty. “When my mother died, and I was left
homeless, I found a home.”
“And why did you leave it !” asked the landlady, “afore you found
a better "
“Because I feared I caused unhappiness, where I would have
given my life to have given joy. Oh, so good a man—so kind—with
such a gentle heart towards everything !”
“Was he a married man, my dear?” asked the landlady.
“He was,” answered Patty; whereupon Mrs. Crumpet looked
suddenly very sagacious, as though by inspiration she had solved the
problem.
“I see,” said she ; “you and the wife couldn't agree. The woman

“Kind—excellent—most kind,” cried Patty with animation—“but
weak and passionate.”
“And jealous, of course,” added Mrs. Crumpet.
“I saw that my presence gave pain to her, and I left her house,
determined, whatever might be my portion, to keep my hiding-place
a secret from herself and husband.”
“But he has found you out,” said Mrs. Crumpet.
“Mr. Lintley f" cried Patty.
“And has brought wine and left money for you;" for Mrs. Crumpet
immediately concluded that the stranger must be the apothecary.
“What say you to that, child f" asked the lady.
Patty could say nothing. She was silent, and in tears.

O D. E.
To MY YARD of CLAY.
TALK not to me of Turkish bowl,
With cherry tube and amber tip,
Whose fragrant fumes in Istambol
Wreathe lazily round the whisker'd lip :
'Tis all delightful in its way,
But give me, gods, a yard of clay.
By flood and field a roamer long,
To-day behold me stout and strong ;
Each pestilential clime defied,
From sickness saved by land and tide,
And all my shield a happy knack o'
Brightening my journey with Tobacco.
O Weed divine, o'er sultry plains,
Where Syrian Sol relentless reigns,—
O'er dreary versts of Scythian snows,
A cold CLIMBs
Where deadly frosts assail the nose-
O'er furious Biscay's mountain seas,
Where scarce the Petrel sits at ease,
Or scorched, or iced, or drenched my brow,
My cheerer and my champion, Thou!
In Erin first I condescended .
To sport the clay as other men did.
The first I blew long time I cherished,
Alas ! the hour that veteran perished 1
Woe worth the row, woe worth the day,
That cost thy life, my gallant Clay !
'Twas a dhudeen, all over unchangingly black,
That for years I caress'd, of all dhudeens the crack,
Smoking on, smoking on, through its tube short and slender,
Till I of fell asleep with my feet on the fender.
— "Tis sweet to shoot
At midnight, on the blue and moonlit deep,
Dull care to tatters from a prime Cheroot,
With thumb-grog mellow'd, whilst the watch we keep.
'Tis sweet the Meerschaum in our mouth to put;
'Tis sweet to listen, as its kindlings creep
From leaf to leaf; 'tis sweet athwart each eye
To puff the cloud that curling climbs the sky.
'Tis sweet t'approximate the glowing spark
To tortuous Hooka in an Indian home;
'Tis sweet from Hudson's or Alvarez' ark
To cull the comeliest weeds, sans dread of scum ;
'Tis sweet, cigar in mouth, t'enjoy a lark,
Inspired by ardent waters—such as rum.
Sweet is the Cigarette to Spanish women,
Short-cut to soldiers, pigtail-quid to seamen.
But sweeter still than this—than these—than all,
The pristine Yard of Clay. It stands alone,
Fit for all climes, years, pockets large or small :
The height of smoking has been reach'd—all's known
By him who sticks to clay—no more he'll call
For pipe, save that the first to mortal shown.
A light for Adam’s “clay" was th' unforgiven
Fire which Prometheus filch'd from envious Heaven.

his celebrated Museum of the products of foreign
industry is open to the public every day, Sundays
excepted, from eight in the morning to an un-
certain hour of the evening, varying according to
the commercial inclinations of the inhabitants.
Admittance is readily obtained at either end,
from the West Strand or Adelaide Street; the
entrance being guarded in both cases by beadles
of imposing aspect, whose chief business is to
strike awe into the souls of vagrant boys, and
protect the pass from brigands, to do which they
are each empowered to carry the standard of the
brazen knob. Their jurisdiction extends over the
pavement immediately before the entrance, but not beyond the kerb ; from
which position they may be insulted with impunity, as is frequently the case.
The first idea that strikes the visitor upon entering is, most probably,
that the houses have been turned out of window ; and the contents of
their shops shot upon the ground by some architectural avalanche.
Indeed, the greatest caution is necessary in threading your way amongst
the labyrinth of goods on every side, the most fragile generally being
placed where they can be readily kicked over and broken. Like the
entanglement of the fly in the cobweb, which caused the spider to dart
from his abode, this accident generally produces the owner of the pro-
perty, who lies in wait in some secret corner, and upon hearing the frac-
ture pounces out with inconceivable rapidity upon the thoughtless victim.
Indeed, it is in the delicate arrangement of their wares that the merchants
of the Lowther Arcade display the most extraordinary ingenuity and
mechanical dexterity; for every article forms the keystone to an ela-
borate arrangement of its companions, and you cannot move it without
bringing all the rest down at the same time.
Up to the present time there has been no proper catalogue of the
objects exhibited, and so, in some cases, the visitor must rely upon his
imagination to define them. This is sometimes difficult, perhaps very
—tº-sº: Sºs
*-d-:
much so,-in the Dutch toy-boxes of bouquets and feasts, on some of the
plates of which are viands of singularly obscure character, more espe-
cially amongst the wooden pastry. It is also no easy task to make out
the exact regiments to which the various horse and foot soldiers belong,
several hundred of which are nightly bivouacked in the Lowther Arcade,
who would doubtless be found useful in putting down any revolt of the
Noah's Arks, did such an event occur. The proximity of the drawing
classes, however, at Exeter Hall, renders these magazines of some value in
furnishing models for the compositions of the pupils, on the plan formerly
put forward in Punch.
The stianger will not fail to be struck by the representation of two
headless gentlemen in a hunting-coat, and dressing-gown at an adjacent
tailor's. They are placed behind a brass barrier, and have something
very awful in their appearance. The legend attached to them is un-
known ; but they possibly represent the guillotined victims of some revo-
lution—probably the same in which fell the decapitated ladies at the
staymaker's in Berners'-street, whose heads are supposed to have mi-
grated to the hair-dresser's in the covered passage of Burlington, which
is somewhat similar in its features to that of Lowther—arcades ambo.
A singular procession of rampant rocking-horses, who appear galloping
up the side of the house, one after another, leaving the common Dutch
nags of various dimensions upon the dull earth below, conducts the eye of
the visitor to the window of Mr. Pask, the musician, wherein, amidst a
crowd of horns and trumpets, Taglioni may be seen descending from
aerial regions, and gracefully presenting a cornet-à-piston of immature
growth and diminutive proportions to some ideal personage. And occa-
sionally strange sounds and pealing blasts of defiance are heard from the
halls of Pask, given forth by daring youths, who pour their whole soul
into the tubes of the shining instruments, from the bugle to the ophycliede
in the ardour of their enthusiasm. A soft and gentle instrument too is
the ophycliede, and well adapted to be studied in small houses by young
gentlemen of delicate temperament. Pask boasts several of these brazen
leviathans, who when disturbed from their repose by mortal breath, give
a sullen roar that reverberates along the arcade like thunder, and drowns
the accordionic strains which issue from a neighbouring depôt for the sale
of those musical bellows. The ophycliedes get bigger and bigger each
day, and it is nmpossible to tell at what pitch of monstrous magnitude they
will ultimately arrive. We shall not be surprised if they finally form the
abodes of the men who play them : an accommodation which will be very
valuable to perambulating musicians at the seasons of the various
Festivals.
Towards evening the Lowther Arcade is blocked up with company, and
here several of the foreign gentlemen, lately alluded to, finish their
diurnal promenade : so that, in fact, a visit to this favoured spot embraces
two exhibitions at once ; for the foreign gentlemen love everything that
is gratuitous; and there is moreover a Frenchy look about the arcade and
its shops, which reminds the majority of them of their father-land—both
the Burlington and Lowther Arcades being the Passage Colbert at Paris,
translated into English.
The Adelaide Gallery, which opens from the Lowther Arcade, is not a
gratuitous exhibition. This the visitor will soon discover, from being
attacked for a shilling by an individual lying in ambush about four feet
from the entrance, on #. right hand. He can, however, see several
statues for nothing, in the passage, by remaining in the Arcade, as well as
part of the stick and umbrella stand, with a transparent blind at the ex-
treme end, which is scarcely perceptible from the distance, but nevertheless
deserving of notice.
One word, in conclusion, to the proprietors. We are well aware that,
when the gates are shut and the porters on the watch, the interior of the
Arcade is considered impregnable. But we would point out the possibility
of an enemy, at any time, forcing an entrance through the postern of the
pastry-cook's shop at the Strand end (which communicates with both
thoroughfares), were the premises at a future period to be occupied by a
less respectable tenant. This is the weakest point of the passage, and might
be soon carried by a handful of resolute assailants bent upon taking any of
the Dutch villages, or storming any of the encampments which abound in
the interior; to which assault the whole of the cavalry at present in the
Arcade, including the rocking-horses, could offer but a feeble resistance.
We merely throw out these hints by way of caution—we leave the owners
of the above-mentioned property to act upon them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SIR VALENTINE BLAKE”S PARLIAMENT.
When people forget Magna Charta, there may be a chance that
Sir WALENTINE Blake shall pass into oblivion. Until then, the
new constitution for England—written in a beautiful crow-quill hand
upon a sheet of “Queen's note-paper,” by Sir VALENTINE, and
read over in the House of Commons to the grateful laughter of the
senators assembled—shali live in the memories of men as a thing too
good to be true. Plato's republic—Sir Thomas MoRE's Utopia—
Bacon's Neir Atalantis—all are the dreams of visionaries compared to
the fine practical wisdom of Sir VALENT INE's bill, crushed as it was
in the bud—broken in the very shell, by a stiff-necked generation of
legislators, who, like curly puppies, have not yet the eyes to bear the
light !
‘. VALENTINE, however, may take this pride to himself. He
stands alone in the House of Commons. He is single as the phoenix.
With a boldness which could only arise from conscious genius, Sir
VALENTINE proposed his bill; but there was not another sufficiently
intrepid to second it. Whereupon, Sir Valentine took his seat,
and his motion fell to the ground.
The lill was, moreover, infamously used by the Reporters, who
scarcely vouchsafed to it an appearance in their columns. No : they
thought, with the murderers in the play, that “smothering was the
quietest;" and, therefore, dealt in the vaguest generalities. Happily
Sir VAI.ENTINE has a friend in Punch, who was immediately
honoured with the original draught of the intended statute, whereof
the subjoined is a faithful copy.
The preamble, after stating that the House of Commons has
amongst its members an infinite number more than are of the slightest
practical use to the nation (and the reader cannot fail to mark the
beautiful disinterestedness of this avowal on the part of Sir VALEN-
rix E), proceeds to state the process by which the present number
shall be lessened, and the future lawgivers elected.
The first clause enacts, that no man who has been found guilty of
laughing at Colonel Sisthony shall be held capable to sit again in
Parliament. (It is thought that this clause alone will pretty nearly
clear the House.)
Every member who has snored during a speech from Mr. Hume,
N-
**
The tontune of the SCRRW.
or has cried “hear, hear” in his sleep, at Sir Robert PEEL, shall
also be ineligible.
Every Member who has made up his vote without troubling him-
self to make up his mind, shall be barred for ever from the House,
which shall henceforth consist of no more and no less than five-and-
twenty members; this resolution being, it is calculated, very favour-
able to the suppression of much bad language.
As to the mode of election polling, it is to be entirely done away
with, as conducive to all sorts of immorality; “besides,” says Sir
VALENTINE, “bribery and drunkenness” of every variety. Every
member will be elected according to the exhibition of their various
powers, tested before the whole kingdom.
Thus, Sir Roseat PEEL, if he be again desirous of representing
Tamworth, will have to obtain that dignity by proving that he can
smile, and occasionally grin, more seductively than any other can-
didate, through a horse-collar.
If Colonel Sibthorp would again sit for Lincoln, he must win the
honour by grasping a hog with a scraped tail more firmly than any
other competitor. In expectation of the event, the Colonel is, we
are told, daily practising upon a guinea-pig 1
As to the internal arrangements of the House of Commons,—cigars,
wine, spirits and night-caps are to be found by the Government;
and when the numbers are equal upon a division, the Speaker is to
toss up a half-crown with himself for a casting vote.
The Bill is, unhappily, lost for the present Session ; but Sir Wa-
lentine BLAKE has privately assured Punch that the Bill shall be
brought in the very first day of the next.
SHAMEFUL REPORT ||
MR. Punch,-Will you, sir, allow me to draw your attention to
the subjoined, which appeared in the columns of The Morning Herald 2
“It is rumoured that, previous to the nuptials of the Princess Augusta of Cambrid
with the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, an application will be made to Parliament, by
Ministers, to settle an annuity on that Princess of 3,000l. per annum. The ceremony is
now understood to be fixed for the first week in July.”
As the father of the Princess, allow me to give the most unequi-
vocal denial to this rumour. What I is it likely With the country
in its present agony of poverty, -is it probable that I would permit
my daughter (the future Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg, be it
understood), to become a pensioner on England; Shall I ask Eng-
lishmen to support the wife of a foreign Grand Duke Were this
done, I ask you, Mr. Punch, with what face could I take my old
accustomed chair at the charity-dinners of the metropolis :
Pray contradict the wicked rumour, and believe me to be, your
constant reader, CAMERIDGE.
THE KING OF HANOVER AND THE EGG MERCHANTS.
WE understand that the Egg Merchants, whose hopes had been greatly
raised by the announcement in our last of the expected arrival of the
King of Hanover, have had a meeting to know what is to be done with
the enormous stock of eggs that had been laid in with a view to the arrival
of his Hanoverian Majesty. The meeting took place at Lambeth, where
the investment had been most considerable; and thousands had been in
attendance about the Marsh-gate and the Westminster-road, with the
intention of showing the Hanoverian autocrat how the yolk may be thrown
off by a free people. (Oh!). His Majesty, not wishing to run the risk of
a game at j hazard with the populace, delayed his arrival till the
next day, and ultimately came by a different road; so that the eggs remain
in the hands of the dealers.
It was stated at the meeting, that Baron Nathan had, in the handsomest
manner, come forward, and offered to take off a large proportion of the
eggs, for the purpose of teaching his pupils, the vienne. This
announcement was received with enthusiastic cheering.
GROANS OF THE GLOOMY.

But alas! I can only grin i
How jocund is the cock 1
How merry is the hen!
How skipsome and happy the shepherd's flock
As they rollick about in their pen l
The horse within his stall,
The pig within his sty,
Are happy both—yes, happy are all,
But oh! what a beast am I ?
Dull is the lonely dell,
And mournful is the breeze
As it whistles along the gloomy glen,
And murmurs in the trees:
But dell and breeze and glen,
Are jolly as jolly can be
When compared with the miserablest of men,
I mean when compared with me !!

BRITISH COURTS OF JUSTICE.
he Count of REQUESTs, KINGsgate STREET.-The Court
of Requests is a very ancient branch of the judicial
tree, and (to continue the figure) we may observe that
the branch in question has been nailed up against the
wall of a house in Kingsgate-street. The first of these
Courts was established in the reign of Henry the Eighth,
and the dignity of public justice may be said to have
been thus played Old Harry with. The second title of
“Courts of Conscience” has been facetiously given to these temples of tom-
foolery, where justice is more thoroughly “done” than in any other locality.
The Court of Requests in Kingsgate-street has nothing at all particular
on the outside, and they must not be at all particular who venture on a
visit to the interior. Before reaching the Court itself there is a large
square space, which is usually devoted to rows between the plaintiffs and
defendants, and to the tampering of the suitors with the various witnesses.
In one corner there is a desk partitioned off, at which are some clerks,
who when asked for any information always decline giving it. This they
do in emulation of the employés at some of the larger public offices, where
a vacant stare is the only solution of any difficulty under which an appli-
cant may be labouring. After passing a variety of barriers, at one of
which you are rudely thrust back, and at the other stabbed to the waist-
coat with an office ruler by the doorkeepers, you at length succeed in
reaching the Court itself, which we will proceed to describe as accurately
as possible.
In the middle of the apartment is a table, and at one end of it—appa-
rently sitting on a trivet projecting from the top bar of the fire-place—is the
presiding barrister. On the right of the judge is the associate, who has an
- -"
* ABRIDGMENT of Bacon,”
and is allowed the privilege of a blotting-pad, which is placed on a raised
desk; but as the associate is not indulged with a high stool, his nose only
is on a level with his inkstand.
On the left of the barrister is a sort of three-cornered cupboard, with
the top taken off, and which serves for the jury-box. When small claims
are under discussion, the jury consists of only three ; but if the sum in
dispute is large, the number of commissioners necessary to adjudicate is
so much increased that they are obliged to have recourse to standing on
one leg, holding on by the door, and other feats which would be more
characteristic of a party of Indian-rubber contortionists than a British
ury.
J The walls of the Court are adorned with a clock and a salt-box; the
former to take note of time “by its loss,” and the latter to season the
jokes of the presiding barrister. The salt-box is seldom wanted; but
the usher of the Court has a very ingenious method of calling attention to
the wit of the judge ; for the latter always winks at his subordinate when-
ever he attempts to perpetrate a joke, and thus notifies the otherwise un-
discoverable fact of his doing so.
The mode of administering justice at the Courts of Request is so pecu-
liar, that a patent ought to be taken out for it. The parties attack each
other, appeal to the judge, explain the case to the bystanders, and give the
lie to the opposite witnesses—while the presiding barrister sums up to the
jury, some of whom are listening to a stranger among the audience, who
ł. happened to hear the case, while another of their body is having a little
private chat with the associate across the table. Out of all this confusion
a verdict somehow or other turns up, but whether it comes from the jury,
or the judge, or the parties themselves, or the witnesses, or the audience,
it would be difficult to determine. As order was elucidated from chaos,
so does a judicial decree in the Court of Requests emerge from the most
confounded mass of jargon that can be possibly conceived; and the suitors
not unfrequently retire to fight it out in the vestibule, either with each
other, the witnesses, the jury, the ushers, or the audience; and the de-
feated party, having bullied the clerks in the outer office, loiters outside to
hoot the barrister.
THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
Have been hard at work trying to discover the relation between the comet
and the late continuous rains, weather or no. It appears from their
report, that the seasons are gradually getting reversed, so that in a few
years' time May Day will fall in the middle of November, and February
become the favourite month for al fresco picnics, and Dahlia-shows. We
shall also have to look for hard and long-continued frosts in July, whilst
the sea-side will be chosen as the best locality for passing the long
and sultry days of January. When the calculations are perfectly worked
out, Punch's Almanack for that year will be the medium through which
they will be made known to the public.
3Bumrij's Qſbeatrical Gallery.
mR. RAVENSCAW of the minor the ATRES.
THE exact epoch at which this gentleman came into the world is almost
as uncertain as the period at which he may go out of it. His mother used
to tell him that Good Friday was his birthday, which is all he could ever
get out of the old lady upon this point; but the enormous crow's feet
under both his eyes bespeak him to have been born in the year 1795, at
the very latest. Ravenscaw himself attributes his wrinkles to those severe
emotions which he has been depicting every night for the last twenty
years. A man who is murdered at least twice a week, commits parricide
several times in the course of the year, and is torn by remorse every
night at about nine o'clock, just after the coming in of the half-price,
cannot be supposed to have otherwise than a care-worn countenance.
Ravenscaw was in early years a stable-boy in Whitechapel, but catching a
severe cold, his voice attracted the attention of the Manager of the Pavi-
lion, who had some idea of getting up a drama called the “Eighty Cut-
throats, or Blood will have Bones,” in opposition to the Forty Thieves
at a rival establishment. Ravenscaw was at once engaged, and committed
his first dramatic murder as the second assassin in Macbeth, in which he
was complimented by the Manager, who kindly instructed him in a
few of his own peculiar growls, which Ravenscaw subsequently introduced
with several of his assumptions. It was feared that our hero would have
been discharged when his cold was cured; but happily for him, it had
left upon him a permanent hoarseness, which rendered him a valuable
member of the company. His engagement was consequently renewed,
and articles drawn up, securing him all the jack-boot and horse-pistol
business, with the choice of parts in the torch and cutlass lines. His
excessive misery attracted the attention of Mr. Osbaldiston, who had heard
| him laugh so many minutes at the idea of happiness, that upon the
strength of his inimitable—

hal—have—ha, ha-1 to do with ha, ha, ha, ha, happiness? “hal hal

The extreme jocoseness of the idea of having nothing to do with happi-
ness was so splendidly conveyed by Ravenscaw, that our hero had an
immediate offer of terms, and he at once took up his quarters at the Wic-
toria. Here he has continued ever since, and the catalogue of his crimes
would fill a Newgate Calendar.
A Grand Review.
On Friday last six little boys were reviewed in Tottenham-court-road by
Master Stubbs, on which occasion a pair of colours (one claret, the other
black) were presented to one of the party by the proprietor of a fish-stall,
which was upset during the execution of a difficult movement.

LONDON AND THE LONDONERS.
BY JACOB DRYASDUST.
THE Post Office London Directory is amply sufficient to furnish a
rustic with materials for thought and conversation during the re-
mainder of his existence. With deep astonishment he gains some
idea of the Heart of the World, whence issue in a thousand streams
the materials for civilisation, prosperity, and comfort, through the
whole Social System ; to be returned again in an altered form, and
replaced by a fresh supply. He is amazed on discovering that the
metropolitan breed of Smiths alone outnumbers the population of
his native town; that the Browns and Greens will, of themselves,
constitute a respectable army ; and the Robinsons be sufficient to
people a newly-found land. His experience will not enable him to
divine the probable kind of business which some men, according to
that Directory, carry on ; such as Average Staters and Adjusters,
Fid Manufacturers, Blackwell Hall Factors, Glaire Merchants,
Chemical Stopperers, Hame Manufacturers, Heel Ball Makers,
Meters, Compounders, and Orchil and Cudbear Makers. He finds
there are upwards of eighty different kinds of agents, twenty-two
separate trades connected with the making of coaches, and twenty-
nine with that of watches. Some people are therein described as
Racket Makers, Rout Furnishers, Secret Springers, Invisible Peruke
Makers, and Vegetable Ornament Cutters; whilst the energies of
some great minds are devoted to the sole and exclusive purpose of
manufacturing Dolls, Smelling-bottle Caps, Tea-pot Handles, and
Ear-ring Joints.
A little further on he comes to the societies; the purposes of
which, as indicated by their names, very much puzzle him. The
London Itinerant Society he imagines to be a peripatetic band ; and
the Fire Protection Society, intended to resist any revival of the
Curfew. The Children's Friend Society to be composed of persons
fond of introducing those animated plagues with the dessert, and the
Aged Pilgrim's Friend Society of those attached to superannuated
beggars. In addition to which there are the Animals' Friend Society,
and the Labourer's Friend Society, the Provisional Protection
Society, and the Aborigines Protection Society; all very incompre-
hensible to his unsophisticated mind: and last, though not least, the
Marylebone Central Association for the redress of grievances and
promotion of the breed of pigs.
When he arrives at a list of the parishes, he is again amazed by
the odd appellations of the saints who anciently presided over
London: St. Andrew Hubbard, St. Benedict Fink, St. Margaret
Pattens, and St. Christopher le Stock, cannot boast of very melli-
fluous surnames. St. Nicholas Sherehog must have originated the
proverb about “much cry and little wool,” and St. Margaret Moses,
St. Peter le Poor, and St. Michael le Querne, appear to be of question-
able respectability.
And not only is London extraordinary to the uncivilised rustic,
but it presents much to cause daily astonishment and reflection in its
own denizens also. Its shops are magazines of curiosities, its shop-
keepers men of genius and learning ; the names they invent for their
wares inspire me with a never-ending sensation of respect and awe.
One trader in Regent Street solicits my patronage for the Accelero-
paedo, or shoe which gives celerity to walking ; another produces the
Pannuscorium to ease my corns, and the Impilia to give elasticity to
my instep. An enterprising gentleman in the Strand, who sells a
Sºº-º->
cheap Pommade, insinuates that the vigour of Shakspeare's genius
was much increased by his having rubbed a preparation of the same
kind into his head; whilst a splendid painting of the Stratford
Jubilee draws attention to that fact. An establishment in Fetter
Lane displays a choice assortment of “Fluids indispensable for those
who desire a fine growth of Hair,” viz. “The Oleaginous;” “The
Pathognomonic;” “The Detersive;” “The Palpebraceous;” and
“The Arabian;” and a man in Holborn asserts that it is impossible
to enjoy a merry Christmas without first laying in a dozen of the
Ginger wine.
PUNCH'S LABOURS OF HERCULES.
CHAPTER IV.-LABOUR FOURTH...-How HERCULES DESTROYED A
GREAT Boart.
HERcules, in putting down war, so far put down murder. But
murder is multiform. Not to talk of murdering Hamlet, Othello,
and Macbeth, or murdering characters in another sense of the term,
which, being metaphorical murders, break no bones; there are, or
rather there were, anteriorly to this happy era, several varieties of
downright, literal, deadly murder. Men, women, and children, were
worked to death in mines and factories. Wretches were starved in
prisons. And the public was poisoned, as will presently be shown, by
the wholesale.
The old world was infested with certain evils called diseases. We
know, though of course, no one ever thinks of trying the experiment,
what would happen to one of us who should think proper to put his
hand in the fire. For we read, in a certain book intended for the
instruction of children, that “ignis,” fire, “ urit,” burns. But, fortu-
nately, we are also further aware that some things are good to eat and
others not, and of those which are good, that it is right to take
only a limited quantity, otherwise that certain consequences, not
essentially in any way differing from the burning of one's fingers, must,
of necessity, ensue. So that no individual now dreams of eating
turtle, venison, beef, mutton, and vegetables for six; or drinking
champagne, port, sherry, or brandy-and-water for ten, as, sooth to say,
was commonly done in times of yore. Nor does anybody otherwise
break the laws of health ; consequently nobody is ill. Diseases were
susceptible of relief, and those whose business it was to afford it
were called physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. The ruins of the
Hall of the latter, and of the Colleges of the two former, were still
standing within the memory of man.
The practice of these men consisted, that is to say, it ought to have
consisted, in directing their patients what to eat and drink, and how
to live; and withal in giving and applying to them peculiar sub-
stances called medicines and remedies. This latter part of their
business was the least and most insignificant portion of it: but our
ancestors, with all respect to their memory, were such boobies as to
suppose it the principal. They fancied that every disease had an
appropriate cure in the shape of some drug or other, which when
they became ill, they had nothing to do but to drink, swallow,
or use. This mistake of theirs gave origin to another class of prac-
titioners.
The physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries lived by the exercise of
their calling, that is to say, they were paid (sometimes) by the
persons whom they attended. They were obliged to be at much
expense and trouble in educating and qualifying themselves for their
duties; whereas the other class was under no obligation of the sort.
Its members had only to invent some substance or compound, and
to pay a certain sum which secured the monopoly of it to them-
selves, in order to go and sell it wherever, and to what amount
they pleased. These persons were denominated Quacks.
Our revered ancestors were distinguished by a remarkable faculty,
—a singular width of swallow. This will perhaps have been inferred
from what has been said above of their voracity; but the swallow
here intended was a mental or moral swallow, a capacity of gulping
assertions. Of this, the Quacks took great advantage. A lie is now
a moral monster, a thing we never hear: we only know what it is
from History. In the days however, whereof we write, lies were
“as plenty as blackberries;” or rather, to use what in this delightful
age is an apter simile, as abundant as pineapples. Well; these
Quacks did lie enormously. You could not take up a newspaper or
magazine that was not crammed with their falsehoods. Hardly could
you pass a wall which did not display them; hardly run your nose
against a post without their offending it. They stared you brazenly
in the face in the broad ways, they sneaked into your notice in every
corner. One Quack professed by his infallible specific to cure all dis-
eases; another modestly restricted its efficacy, which however, he
vowed was unerring, to one. Each pressed Styleses and Nokeses, in

---
attestation of his therapeutic miracles, into his service by scores: and
at last it became a well-known fact that whoever could afford to pay
sufficiently for the effectual dissemination of his lies, was sure to be
repaid for his outlay by the realisation of a fortune. For our good
progenitors gorged these bounces with avidity, to the infinited, tri-
ment and dissatisfaction of the regular professors of physic; and
moreover, to the slaughter of whole multitudes, which constituted
the species of murder above adverted to.
Accordingly, the medical men went to Hercules, to complain to
him of the ravages of quackery, which they represented as a terrible
bore.
Hercules, recol-
lecting his former
adventure with
the Erymanthian
bcar, was inquir-
ing about the
length of the mon-
ster's tusks, when
they undeceived
him by informing
him that they
meant a griev-
ance.
Whereupon, the
hero read them a
short but interest-
ing lecture, which
he recommended
their head man to
retail at the next
conversazione at
the College of
Physicians. He
expounded unto
them the real na-
ture of disease,
with the proper
principles of treat-
ing it, which they
pretending that
they knew al-
ready, the hero
asked them why,
(and be blistered
to them :) - they
had kept the peo-
ple in ignorance.
They had allowed
the public to re-
main fools, and
how could they
complain if it be-
came the prey of
knavery Until
they purged their
own body of
quackery, he would see himself at Erebus before he would stir
his stumps, or his club either, to afford them the slightest assist-
ance. With this, he frowned, and shook his said club at them in so
threatening and awful a manner that they all went down upon their
knees and humbly promised to mind what he had told them ; after
which, they slunk out of his presence much sadder and wiser men
than they were when they came into it.
In due time, Hercules set to work to extirpate the evil. His first
proceeding was to belabour soundly with his club the unprincipled
Legislature of the country, which for a consideration protected the
Quack in the monopoly of his poisonous rubbish. He also distri-
buted an adequate amount of drubbing among the public generally,
insomuch, that in spite of the density of their skulls he quickly caused
the light of reason to dance before their eyes, even as, when a heavy
singlestick alighteth on the crown of a rustic, sparks and balls as of
fire do glimmer and flash athwart his retina. And herein he was no
respecter of persons, but did as vigorously and unsparingly assault
divers Lords spiritual and temporal, county members of Parliament,
worshipful aldermen, and respectable burgesses, as the most humble
workmen and mechanics. Nay, as the latter, many of them, had been
better taught at their various institutes than to put faith in Quacks, he
found even more thumping required at his hands among what were
then called the superior classes of society. Indeed, some of those who
wanted the hardest hitting, were certain ladies of quality, including
a large proportion of superannuated Countesses, who had been stupid
enough to allow their names to be appended to certificates recom-
mendatory of the ear-trumpet of this Quack, the spectacles of that,
and the eye-snuff or stomach-pills of the other.
Nor did Hercules forget the proprietors of various noted journals,
who let out the columns of their papers for Quacks to publish their
lies in them,--but in truth, he dressed and curried them soundly,
till they ceased to be the abettors of homicidal humbug.
The specific of the Quacknow rapidly became a drug in the market.
Whole warehouses were filled with elixirs, carminatives, electuaries,
balsams, and real blessings to mothers, large quantities of which were
shot on waste lands as rubbish while some were converted to agricul-
tural purposes. It was found, however, that the vegetable pills
and syrups which, it had been hoped, would form useful manure,
proved, in consequence of not being vegetable matter at all, extremely
detrimental to the soil. However, certain tons of powders, which
were principally composed of bone-dust, were used with great benefit
in some districts.
In fine, the occupation of the Quack, thanks to the club of
Hercules, was very soon gone; and the only inconvenience which
resulted was a certain increase of population. It was remedied by
emigration to Australia. -
As Hercules, when he went to destroy the Erymanthian boar,
destroyed likewise the Centaurs, so, in putting down the bore of
quackery, he overthrew a sect or gang of persons of whom the said
Centaurs were in some measure typical. For we are informed that
the Centaurs were a species of monsters, half-man and half-horse.
Now the persons alluded to were a sort of Quacks, half-rational
creature and half-jackass, of whom some were termed Homoeopa-
hists, others Hydropathists, while there likewise belonged unto
hem several of the Mesmerists and Phrenologists. All were com-
prehensible under the generic term pseudosopher.
One remark ble circumstance attendant on the destruction of
quackery, was an extreme attenuation of the Faculty, which included
within itself a very large number of virtual Quacks. But, however,
as a great and corresponding decline had taken place in the sum of
diseases, there remained quite as many medical practitioners as
were wanted, until mankind gradually arrived at their present state
of enlightenment with respect to physiology; and at length diseases

THE ROYAL CHRISTENING BANQUET
The collation given at Buckingham Palace on the occasion of the
recent royal christening, was on a splendid scale. The King of Hanover
had been expected, and the morning looked rather gloomy, but his
Majesty and suite did not come,
one or The “sweet,”
Among the delicacies pre-
pared for him, was ice; and it was thought that, had he arrived in time,
he would have made a present to the Queen of a wet blanket, to be wrapp d
and the afternoon brightened up amazingly.
round the royal infant. At two o'clock the company entered the gallery
for the collation.
The Earl of Liverpool gave, as the first toast, “Her Royal Highness
the Princess Alice Maud Mary.”
Song.—“My bonny wee thing.”
The next toast was “Queen Adelaide.”
Song.—“I give thee all,” &c.
The third toast was “The Queen.”
Air.—“The Rose-tree in full bearing.”
The company then drank “Prince Albert and the Prince of Wales.”
Song.—“The lads of the village.”
After the Queen and party had retired, the following toasts and senti-
ments were given by the domestics, who rushed into the gallery to finish
the eatables and drinkables:—
“May the annual edited by the Queen and Prince Albert be a Keepsake
for the country, and a Book of Beauty for the Royal Family.”
“Long life to the heir-apparent, and may the talked-of disorders in
Wales never trouble the Prince of ditto.”
“Sir Robert Peel and the rest of the Ministers, and may their rest be
the consequence of an early retirement.”
Parliamentary Inquiries.
MR. Hume had observed that several bills stood for reading on certain
days, six months from certain other days. He (Mr. H.) wished to know
whether any arrangements had been made for securing a person to be in
attendance to read the bills alluded to 1 and whether any particular hour
had been fixed for the interesting process?
Qſìeatrital intelligentt.
Evarybody is asking what is to become of Covent Garden Theatre; but
nobody thinks of asking what is to become of the proprietors. It is said
that the market is to be enlarged by throwing the theatre into it; but, as
the theatre has been in the market for some time, we don't see what more
can be effected. Snobbins, the eleventh priest in “Norma,” has, it is
said, made an offer of some kind to somebody; but, as nobody knows
anything about it, there is every probability of its coming to nothing,
which is the exact amount of the rent which he would be enabled to find
security for.

OUR latest letters from Hampstead are wholly illegible, from the excited
state of our correspondent, who dates from the Heath, and whose feelings
on the subject of the threatened enclosure must be conceived, for he has
altogether failed in describing them.
Our letters from Kentish town are in their usual tone of gloom. The
Assembly Rooms continue closed ; and, though a family has taken a fur-
nished house for the season, all the provisions are from town, so that
the local commerce has received no impetus. A neighbouring butcher
was seen in consultation with his boy; they were sharpening their knives
on their steels—but we have no dates later than this alarming incident.
There is still a great deal of excitement on the question of repealing the
union between Brompton and Kensington. The Brompton beadle is said
to have been wavering, but the Kensington turncock is firm. The former

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
CHAP. XXII.- AN INTRUDE.R.—A STOLEN WATCH.-PATTY in
AFFLICTION. -
“If it doesn’t delight my heart to see you cry,” said Mrs. Crumpet;
“’t will do you good, my lamb—it always did me good when I was
young. Ha! they don't make the bottles as they used to do 1" she
added, perceiving that all the wine was gone—a discovery which the
wine she had already drunk scarcely enabled her to compass. “That’s
Mr. Abram,” she cried, as a loud knock at the street-door rang through
the house. “He’s always in such a hurry Good-night, my darling
—go to sleep and dream yourself a lady.” Saying this, the landlady
managed to pick her steps from the room, in her vinous forgetfulness
leaving me behind.
Heavily the hours passed Poor Patty I heard her lips move—
heard her turn restlessly in bed—moan and sigh, as though her little
heart was vainly struggling with its sorrow. “”T will soon be over”
—I then heard her murmur in a sweet, resigned voice—“very soon;”
and then she slept.
How I wished myself in the hand of some good fairy . Some
beneficent sprite, piteous of human wrong and human suffering !
Then, I thought, should this dark, dim garret pass away ! Then
should rise a small, quiet nook of a place, nestled among trees, and
carpeted with green around. And there a brook should murmur
with a voice of out-door happiness—and a little garden brimming
over with flowers, should mark the days, and weeks, and months with
bud and blossom ; and the worst injuries of time be fallen leaves |
And there health in balm should come about her path, and her mind
be as a part of every fragrant thing that shone and grew around her.
And thus, poor, wearied creature l—she should draw her daily,
gentle breath, till ripe for heaven.
I had fallen into a delicious lull with these thoughts, when I was
startled by a sudden uproar, proceeding from the lower part of the
house. There were loud, blaspheming voices—the shrill cries of a
woman,—and in the following instant, the garret door was burst
open, and a man rushed in. As he did so, his head struck against the
low roof, and he fell with a heavy weight upon the rotten floor,
swearing and cursing with half-smothered passion, which it cost
him a hard effort to control. “What’s that who's there 1* ex-
claimed the terrified Patty.
“Nobody—silence—where's the window t” replied a voice, gasp-
ingly. The window was in a second opened, and the intruder, I
could perceive, endeavoured to escape by it. The aperture was too
small for his big, burly anatomy, and there for a brief space he re-
mained with his shoulders wedged in the narrow space, swearing and
groaning—and then, on the sudden he was silent, and again and again
I heard his hard breathing, and felt the garret shake as he strove to
effect his purpose. The noise increased below, and coming steps and
voices convinced me that the fellow was closely pressed. For a
moment he paused, as to collect and intensify his energies for one
last dreadful effort—for one gigantic struggle, another instant, and
he had cleared the window. As he did so, I thought I heard a heavy
substance fall upon the floor.
Almost immediately upon the escape of the intruder, the garret
was filled with watchmen and others, carrying lanterns; Mrs.
Crumpet, upon whom sleep and surprise had induced a beneficial
sobriety, now bustling through them, with a loud voice, declaratory
of the wondrous honesty of her habitation, and of all the lodgers
therein dwelling. Everybody paused at the window. “Abram's
gone—the bird’s flown,” said a man, who, I imagined, was in higher
authority than his followers.
“”Tis impossible, Mister Hardmouth,” said a watchman; “a moral
impossible, out of this winder. Why, it is n't no bigger than a rat-
hole.”
“Ha, Snigs, don't you yet know what a man will do with Jack
Ketch at his heels t” answered Mr. Hardmouth. “Well, better luck
next time,” said the philosophic functionary. “But I tell you what,
Mrs. Crumpet, the parish of Bloomsbury will give you a taste of
Bridewell, if you don’t keep decenter people about you.”
“Il Mr. Hardmouth ! I’m a peaceable woman, and never troubles
my head with my neighbours. I’m a woman as pays my church-
rates, and can look the queen herself in her face My husband could
have bought and sold you all,—every jack of you—but he's in
heaven.” And Mrs. Crumpet continued to spin off this old, home-
spun sort of yarn with practical volubility; at the same time, as I
observed, that she carefully covered a watch which had fallen from
Mr. Abram in the hurry of his departure, and which lay beneath
NEW
the window. This operation she very adroitly effected ; and then
continued her self-assertion of punctilious honesty, the while with her
foot she pushed and slid the watch close to Patty's bed.
“And who's here 1* cried Hardmouth, taking a lantern from a
watchman, and holding it towards Patty, who cowered and trembled,
with blushes in her face that seemed to scorch her. For the first
time, I saw within her eyes a look of scorn, of passion. Her hands
shook together, as she appealed to the landlady, “Will not these
men go?”
“To be sure, they will—never fear 'em, my love,” cried Mrs. Crum-
pet, seating herself upon the edge of the bed. “And if they won't,
I'll never leave you ; never, my darling.”
“And so this is Mrs. Abram, is it?” asked Hardmouth. “Poor
thing ! Well, with all her husband's luck upon the road, he might
house her better.”
“She is no Missus Abram; nor nothing of the sort. Don't cry,
child, they’re brutes; a waking honest people in their beds. I should
like to know when you’re going,” asked Mrs. Crumpet of her
intruders.
“When we've dome a little more business. Off o'that, mother
Crumpet; you and I are old friends, and ceremony's lost atween us.”
Saying this, Mr. Hardmouth—if justice be a woman, she ought spe-
cially to protect her sex—seized Mrs. Crumpet by the arm, and
swung her from her seat on the bed. “Now, my dear, where's the
traps?” asked the officer with most familiar insolence.
“I know not what you mean—not a word; but leave me—only a
few minutes, whilst I rise and dress.” Thus spoke Patty; and for a
time she seemed to vanquish sickness by the strong sense of her
offended modesty. There was a look of command in her face—a look
in which were lost the care and feebleness of an hour since. “I
beg—I desire that you leave me.”
“To be sure—leave us,” exclaimed Mrs. Crumpet in treble notes,
and imitating, though with shrewish awkwardness, the imperative
manner of Patty. “How can we dress with men in the room Are
you lost to natur, you brutes ?” cried the landlady.
“Mrs. Abram can dress alone,” said Hardmouth ; and so saying,
he twirled Mrs. Crumpet from the attic, that lady loudly denouncing
the brutality of all men. Nor was she content with this ; for as she
stood outside the door, she called loudly to Patty, telling her to show
her spirit, and conjuring her upon her true womanhood, not to rise
for the best man as ever walked upon shoe-leather.
Patty, however, regardless of such conjuration, dressed herself with
her best speed ; nor did the multiplicity or cumbrousness of her gar-
ments very much retard the operation. Her offended feelings of
maidenly shame gave her strength and energy of purpose. Sickness
seemed banished from her cheek; and in its place there was a look
of sorrowful dignity—a mingling of grief and elevated patience.
“Come, Missus Abram, you’re not dressing for the Lord Mayor's
show,” called out Hardmouth.
“You may come in,” said Patty, and she sank upon the one chair.
The officers and watchmen again entered the garret, and again with
quickened looks did Mrs. Crumpet press forward amongst them,
watching with feline eagerness the motions of Hardmouth. “I
thought as much,” cried that wary servant of police, as he kicked
aside the bedding, and discovered a watch. Mrs. Crumpet, in the
vigour and confusion of her wrath, nearly bit through her thumb for
her thumb-mail ; the watchman laughed and chuckled knowingly;
whilst for Patty, she sat unmoved, and seemingly careless of all that
passed around her.
“The very watch as we had information of,” said Hardmouth.
“I can swear to the marks. But this can't be the only egg in the
nest;” and with this wise saw, Hardmouth turned over and over the
bed, Mrs. Crumpet all the while abusing him, and asking him if he
knew where he would go to She then nodded to Patty, and whis-
pered, “Never mind, my darling, for this little mishap—your friend
will see you righted.”
“What friend ?” inquired Patty, almost unconscious of the words.
“What friend ? Why, you hav'n't forgot the wine and the
guinea I told you of t” These words brought to the mind of Patty
the kind, benevolent Lintley. The recollection was again too much
for her. She looked about her—at the faces hurrying around
her, and smitten by the remembrance of her past sufferings—by her
belief in future misery—she hid her face in her hands, and wept bit-
terly.
“It’s a bad job, Missus Abrams,” said Hardmouth ; “but if people
were only to think of being found out afore they begun, why we
might turn Newgate into another playhouse, and turnkeys might go
a begging. Come,” he added, “you must go along with us for this.”
Patty, aghast with terror—worn with sickness—looked silently in

her.
“What do you meant” cried Mrs. Crumpet, in a screech, and
suddenly trembling all over.
“Mean Why, my meaning is plain as Tyburn. This watch is
stolen, and that girl—Mrs. Abram, if she is Mrs. Abram, and if she
isn't, why she ought to be—why she knows all about it.”
“I know nothing—nothing,” said Patty, with a voice lessened to
whispering, by terror.
“if you don't, man and wife is one flesh all the world over; and
as it was your husband's bed”—
“I have no husband,” screamed the girl.
“Well, that's your business, I can't help that,” said Hardmouth.
“No one—no one—I am alone in this cruel, cruel world—alone,
with none but God to help me!”

infected by the sorrow, continued to weep, and cry, “If I had only

That Her Majesty does not mistake the capacity of the Duke of Wel-

sorry to say, been far from satisfactory. Mr. Cubitt, who had been called
in when the unhappy Pier first evinced symptoms of sinking, was in
attendance to superintend the inquiry. It appeared that there was a
mucous matter formed on the outside of the Pier, and the whole frame
was so shattered that it must have given way in less than a twelvemonth.
The fluids had acted very powerfully, and there was a secretion of an old
blacking bottle about the lower extremity; but this could not have had
the effect of hastening dissolution. The epidermis or outer coat of paint
was entirely eaten away, and several large bricks had settled in the side.
but it did not appear that these bricks would have induced mortar-fication.

May it therefore please Your Majesty, that, it be

individual so offending against common politeness be
immediately set down as a “snob on parole "—the
word “snob" being the common for “Gent;” with
the certainty that he belongs to a class of society,
where such behaviour is considered (to clothe its
vulgar idiom in a continental language, whereby its
coarseness may be lessened), tout à fait le fromage:

time that the aforesaid “party" is hors de chez

buy up all the spare cabbage leaves from the public markets; and, having
steeped them in an infusion of strong tobacco and saltpetre, to roll them
up into Cheroots. And having so formed them, that these be presented
abundantly to all scavengers, costermongers, cabmen, and the like orders,
whereby the air-pollutors may see more clearly, that the practice is by no
means fashionable or dashing, but on the contrary, remarkably low ; and
that there is nothing of the “swell" about it—“swell" being another
word by which the smokers express any tawdry display of finery upon a
“Gent,” who considers himself a man-about-town, he not having any
pretensions, in reality, beyond those of being a useful commercial
assistant.

be accommodated with a cheap common steam-boat, all to themselves, to
be called The Cheroot, which shall ply up and down the Thames, with
strict orders to keep always on the leeward side of the river. And, more-
over, to accommodate everybody, that the said steam-boat shall only run
before the shop-shutters are taken down, and after they are put up again,
Sundays excepted, on which day, being the great festival of smokers in
the open air, it be permitted to run continuously. But at the same time,

using tobacco do not dare to come out of the engine-room, but remain in
company with the stokers, for whom they are fit society.

TRIUMPHAL RETURN of THE KING OF HANOVER.
The King of His woven is once more among us. After a painful
absence of six years—intensely painful to all parties—the monarch
returns to the country of his birth, a country to which he will leave
his name, as Wordsworth says of WALLAce, “as a flower,” odorous
and perennial. King ERNEst, however, like his ancient brother
CAMBYses, is of a modest and retiring mind—is one of those
men who—
“Do good by stealth, and blush to find it eggs,”
and he therefore stole to St. James's to avoid that public demon-
stration of feeling, which he believed would from all sides be
showered upon him. There are various reports as to the means by
which the King of HANoven arrived at the West-end. Some declare
he took a cab–others stand to it, that he pulled himself in a Thames
Wherry to Hungerford; others vow that he exchanged costume
with a butcher at London Bridge. All these reports, however
ingenious, want the salt of truth. Punch alone can reveal the
triumphant mode in which King ERNEst reached the palace ; he
alone was in the secret, and has blabbed it—pictorially blabbed it—
on the opposite page. Yes; King ERNEst arrived in a hogshead,
which the magic touch of Punch's club hath for the purpose vitrified ;
showing the world a King of HANoven in glass, in the like way that
specimens of king's evil and other physical deformities are shown at
Surgeons' Hall. It is a remarkable fact, that so well was the secret
kept, not even the carriers of the precious burthen knew the priceless
value of their load. They, foolish men, believed it to be tallow ;
yes, the fat of Russian oxen, and not the very marrow of all Con-
tinental kings. How his Majesty will return from St. James's to
the place of embarkation is not yet known ; nor do we believe that
people care so much about the means as the date.
There is, however, one circumstance quite in harmony with the
advent of the King of HANov ER to this country. He arrives here,
it is said, to be present at the marriage of his niece, the Princess
August A, with a German prince, who is not only to take an English
wife, but with her three thousand pounds per annum of English
money; of money, coined from the sweat of starving thousands;
money to gild the shabby Court of Mecklenburg with new splendour.
Sir Robert PEEL has been, it is said, under a course of steel draughts,
and other invigorating medicine, the better to fortify himself in his
address to the Commons for the cash. Sin Rob Ent, however, acutely
alive to our fallen revenue, is still very nervous. It is reported that,
on the evening when the demand upon the patience and the rags of
John Bull was made, the Prime Minister blushed “for that night
only.”
Yes: the Princess August A is to have 3,000l., where with to buy
her a husband. The country, in its present condition, too, is to lay
out this money for a wedding-ring ; and Royal ERNEst is to “give
the bride away.” Is it not easy enough to give away the property of
the poor—is not this the very kind of political pie which the King of
HANoven should have his finger in
JENKINS ON COSTUMES-QUADRILLES.–AND THE OPERA.
JEN kins, who writes as Othello loved, “not wisely,” but, as he
himself assures us, “too well,” has again favoured tº with two or
three samples of his superfine diction—samples so exquisite that it
And
would be base ingratitude in Punck not to acknowledge them. - -
Punch does this the more readily, inasmuch as it is but too evident knot and Trencher, at Penzance—did not she teach you this profound
that poor Jenkins has, for some time past, been under a cloud.
There has been a melancholy, a sombreness in his effusions, which
would indicate the presence of some stern dictator—some prosaic
writing-master, ready to rap J.ENKINs over the knuckles whenever
he should coruscate about le ballerine—the dilletanti—the cirtuosi, and,
as he himself in his happiest moments would say, the other rare ares
of the opera. JENKINs has of late written with no champagne in his
ink; no, not even with ginger pop. No Quaker could behave more
demurely to a chambermaid, than has JENRINs of late com-
ported himself towards the English language. We therefore
hail the recent break-out; though justice to JENKINs compels
us to state that it is very far below JENK1Ns' pressure.
JENKINs, discoursing on the “Fashions of the Court and
High Life,” says with a touching melancholy:-
“In the recent gloom, all preparations for toilettes hare been neglected,
and the anxiety to know what will be the ruling costume of the day is now at
its full height.”
Everybody can bear witness to this fashionable neglect of
dress in the intensity of mourning. Marchionesses wore sack-
cloth, but then it was of the very finest texture; Countesses
powdered their hair with ashes; but then they were ashes
from the very best Wallsend —
“Having a special access to certain high councils of fashion, we think our
fair readers will thank us for a few words of intelligence and advice.”
Now, this is quite true. JEN KINs has always been great
with the dress-makers. By the way, his entry into toilette
life was, we have generally understood, in a baby linen ware-
house; his first attempt at composition was sticking “Wel-
come, little stranger” in minnikin pins in satin cushions.
JENKINs—let the reader see The Morning Post–continues :
“The ball given for the benefit of the Royal Academy holds a distinguished
place amongst the fêtes in prospect, and certain arbitrary mammas, and still
more arbitrary ladies of fashion, are already busily occupied in selecting the cos-
tumes of their daughters, who would, we suspect, in most cases, far prefer
chºosing for themselves. It must be owned that they rarely fail in knowing
what is most advantageous to their youthful charms. Why should they not be
allowed this pleasure, being still aided by the erperience of their mammas?
These, however, using their sovereign power, allow them no voice in the matter,
and occasionally choose what is positirely disadvantageous, by selecting cos-
tumes not so much with regard to what is becoming as to what will obriate
inridious comparisons of mere finery; and we have seen already one or two
incongruous instances of this despotism, such as making a timid retiring blonde
wear a Spanish costume, &c., &c.”
If the reader be not weeping at this, it is not in the power
of onions to move him. Again, mark the wondrous know-
ledge JENKINs hath of the female heart 1 Women, especially
young women, prefer “choosing for themselves;” they abso-
lutely “know what is most advantageous to their youthful
charms 1” True, JENK1Ns, very true. Did not your first
love, who jilted you for the butler, who now keeps the Shoulder-
verity How often, furtively glancing, JENKins, have you seen
her twitch a curl from under her bonnet, as though Zephyrus
self had blown it there Go to, JENkins ! You know all the odd,
winding ways of the female heart as well—aye, as well as all the
ways of Seven Dials.

Hear JEN kins on the philosophy of quadrilles:—
“Care should be taken, in order to give the quadrilles their full effect, that there should
exist no great disproportion between the statures of the performers; and it should also
be decided, that if the ball be really a fancy ball, the costumes should be such as can be
easily recognised. For example, in the quadrille intended to represent the twelve months
of the year, why should they be represented alone, by the flowers worn ? This would
make a very slight distinction, and, besides, we have, alasi months in the year, when
there are few, if any flowers even in our hot-houses.”
We agree with Jenkins. Why should not every lady be honestly
labelled from “January” to “December,” carrying upon the head
the months from Punch's Almanack, which Punch here solemnly pro-
mises to have printed on all variety of satins for the occasion.
We now return to JENKINs at the opera. Mark the consideration
he has of himself:—
“We consider ourselves, as journalists, in our reports bound above all things to reflect
as exactly as possible the impressions of the public; however ephemeral they may be,
they possess the deepest interest: for if we ascend from matters, infinitely small, like
those we treat of, to those works of intellect which are surpassingly great, we find that
amongst historians those who produce the deep-st impression are not such as reasoned
at the distance of ages on long-past events—like a Niebuhr, a Hume, and a Gibbon-
but those who reported with the sobered passions of the moment the events they them-
selves beheld, like a Xenophon, a Davilla, a Guicciardini, and a Clarendon, &c.”
Hang it, JENKINs this is too modest. What You write with
“the sobered passions of the moment,” and are therefore like—but let
us give the list of your similitudes. Here it is 1

“PROPERTY " AT THE POLICE.
The especial court of Midas is an English police court. There,
indeed, Justice gives a lumping pennyworth for ready money.
There, pulling aside her bandage, she smirks and smiles at the heavy
purse, and does all sorts of pretty courtesies to the power of the
pocket. She will turn away with nervous horror from rags—nay,
show symptoms of the falling sickness at the leprosy of want, but,
let her hear the money chink, and she will be as full of smiles as a
Portsmouth Venus on a pay-day. Take the last instance of her
wondrous affability.
The scene is Clerkenwell Police Office. Mr. Wontner, a solicitor,
“drove up in a cab,” and had a private talk with Mr. ComBE, the
magistrate, respecting one George Dawson Lowndes, of noisome reputa-
tion, and late of Newgate. We take the report from The Times : —
“When Mr. Wontner had concluded his private conversation with the magistrate,
his worship ordered Waddington, the gaoler, to take a cab directly and bring the
prisoner, Łº. from Newgate. In the meantime, two persons of gentlemanly
appearance presented themselves as the proposed bail.
“The usual course at this, as well (we believe) as at the other police courts, is
publicly to question persons proposed as bail, regarding their names, residences, and
qualifications.
“Mr. Wontner, however, in this instance handed in a written communication which
we presume contained the requisite information, but as the substance was kept secret
the names of the sureties did not transpire.”
The creature Lowndes was speedily before the magistrate:—
“The form of placing the prisoner in the felon's dock was omitted. He stood beside
the witness bor. The securities having been entered into, Mr. George Dawson Lowndes
was once more set at liberty, having been bound over to answer any charge which may
be preferred against him at the ensuing sessions of the Old Bailey. The whole amount
gºalance. for the above mentioned three cases in which the prisoner is bound is
3000l.
The chances are just three thousand to one that George Dawson
Lowndes, long before his name is called in the Old Bailey, will be air-
ing himself in France, or more congenial Italy. The whole case,
however, presents a fine moral lesson ; for it shows the “rights of
property” in a most radiant light. What respect is paid to wealth
in the “private hearing !”—the omission of the “form” of the
“prisoner” in the dock And yet, with these moral atrocities—
masked as justice—mumming every day at police courts, we are
told that there is the same law for the poor and the rich. We de-
nounce serfdom—we exclaim against the tyranny of the iron collar—
but is there anything like the vassalage of the purse of our day—any
thraldom like that made by gold

ON NURSERY REHYMES.
* Whan the rain raineth, and the gose winketh,
Litell woteth the gosling, what the gose thinketh.”—Skelton.
AMongst those too generally despised fragments of our vernacular
anthology, Nursery Rhymes, there is to be found much of a mythical cha-
racter, and, sometimes, even of apparently prophetic significance. In
each is a leading idea dimly discernible, however encumbered and obscured
by the mere nonsense with which the old mystics were wont to enclose
their brightest gems of wisdom, to disguise the riches of their knowledge
from all but the initiated. The following may be prophetical :—
“There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,
She had so many children she didn't know what to do ;
She went to the market to buy them some bread,
But when she came home she found then all dead.
She went up stairs to ring the bell,
She slipped her foot and down she fell."
Here is set forth that belief which the Mussulmans entertain, that as the
Earth gets older, its sons and daughters gradually decrease in size; and
that when the last days come mankind will be such figures, that their
habitations will be none other than the shoes and slippers made in these
present ages. This old woman, then, is one of the last of our race,—the
death of her children a portion of the final dissolution of all things, and
her own fall, doubtless causing death, before she could even ring the bells
for the funereal obsequies of her children, shows the quick speeding of
the destroyer and slayer.
The ballad of—
“Three children sliding on the ice
All on a summer's day,” &c. &c.,
is evidently a prophecy of the lately invented patent ice. The rest of the
poem may be considered as appended to give an air of nonsense and rig-
marole to a prophecy, which, if put forth in naked majesty, would have
drawn down sneers and revilings on the poet-seer.
“Hush-a bye, baby, Upon the tree top,
When the wind blows The cradle will rock.
When the bough breaks The cradle will fall,
And down will come baby, And cradle and all.”
Here is the old Herbalists’ idea of Sympathy put to rock the cradle ; if
found to act, a happy thing for the nurse ; squalls without by their sym-
pathy with squalls within, hushing them, without aid from vibratory foot |
The cradle being made of small twigs is called the tree top, as it is non-
sense to suppose the cradle would actually be on the top of a tree.
Query—Whether this applies to American rocking chairs?
“There was an old woman went up in a basket,
Seventy times as high as the unoon ;
Where she was going I couldn't but ask it,
For in her hand she carried a broom.
Old woman, old woman, old woman, said I,
Where are you going up so high —
To sweep the cobwebs off the sky,
And I'll be with you by and by.”
Aristophanes, in his comedy of “The Clouds,” ridiculing Socrates and
the Sophists, when Socrates is introduced suspended in a basket, Stre-
poiades asks him the same question asked of the old woman in the above
verses—which we may, therefore, suppose an epigram from the Greek,
calling Socrates an old woman. The “going up in a basket,” at once
pointing him out as the person signified, from the well-known scene in the
play. Lunacy is also hinted at, and even 70 times worse ! And in the
old lady's avocation we see a quiz at the usefulness of the doings of the
Sophists.
Our old friend Dryasdust, here querieth whether this epigrammatic con-
nexion between sophism and lunar influences might not have originated

—
the idea of the man in the moon, banished thither for gathering sticks on
• Sunday; Protagoras, one of the chief sophists, and the inventor of the
porter's knot, having been originally a
faggot-maker. The man in the moon,
whoever he was, appears to make him-
self tolerably comfortable there, for we
are told—
“The man in the moon drinks claret,
Eats powdered beef, turnip, and carrot;
But a cup of old Malaga sack
Would fire the bush at his back;”—
the sticks being so very dry, from the
absence of water in the moon, which
may also be the reason why its inhabi-
tant swills claret.
- - Now that we have taken the moon
by the horns, we will quote another rhyme, seeming, by the junction of
the term “spoon” with the context, to ridicule attempts at riding through
the air, on brooms or otherwise.
“Old Mother Bunch, shall we visit the moon?
Come, mount on your broom, I'll stride on this spoon
Then hey to go we shall be there soon.”
Here again Dryasdust raiseth a question as to the mode in which the
magic arrow which Apollo presented to the hyperborean Abrasis, and on
which he could fly through the air wheresoever he pleased, has in process
of time got converted into a broomstick. Abrasis is said to have made
the circuit of the earth on this arrow, without food; and a journey to the
moon on a broomstick is thought nothing of by those “to the manner
used.” This reminds us of aerial machines, and we venture to throw out
a hint, gratis, for the benefit of all speculators in bubbles. Philosophers
have asserted that, enclosing the atmosphere which surrounds this earth,
is a spherical shell of water, the most lofty stratum of air being liquified
by cold, and thus shutting up the world, as it were, in a great bubble.
Now, could these aërial projectors fit paddle wheels to the tops of their
machines, and rise up to this fluid, they might steam away on “the waters
that are above the firmament,” in the same manner that vessels now do on
“the waters that are under the firmament.”
To return to our Nursery Rhymes. The sheep lost by Little Bo Peep,
from the particular mention of their tails, we should conjecture, were of
that Arabian sort, which, says Herodotus, need a little cart at their heels
to carry their tails. Aristotle, speaking of the Scythian sheep, says their
lamb's tales (Nor from shakspeaRE).
tai's were a cubit wide: and Lady Hester Stanhope, in one of her letters
to General Oakes, in confirming the report that the Druses of Mount
Lebanon eat raw meat, mentions that she purchased an immense sheep,
whose tail weighed twelve pounds.
The well-known rhyme of the man of Sicily who scratched out both his
eyes in a quickset hedge, and afterwards scratched them in again by some
now unknown process, in another hedge, we believe to be a prophecy of
an insurrection in the kingdom of the two Sicilies, where the law term
“Alterigo” or other “1,” is particularly used in the official style of the
kingdom. The hedges are civil wars in which the king and his “other I"
get scratched out and in again. An interval of darkness is indicated by
the hedge which scratched in the eyes being a different one from that
which scratched them out. Perhaps this prophecy referred to the insur-
rection of Masaniello, or to that of Monteforte in 1820.
In concluding, for the present, the subject of nursery rhymes, we will
give Herrick's version of “Humpty Dumpty”—it is called
THE WALL-FLOWER.

Turned her to this plant, we call
Now the Flower of the Wall.

possibility of getting the company ºl. Mr. Bunn, the late lessee,
might, perhaps, have entertained her Majesty with a monopolylogue ; and
a sort of mechanical exhibition might have been got up with the ship in
The Tempest, which is, we believe, at present a ship in distress, with a
sheriff's officer on board, in anticipation of a sale at the first favourable
opportunity. Some of the late crew, among whom were Messrs. Wigan
and others, have been picked up on the Strand, while some are still
hoisting signals of distress, and a few more fortunate are living on their
private stock of provisions.
PUNCH'S LABOURS OF HERCULES.
LABOUR W.—HOW HERCULES CLEANSED THE AUGEAN STABLES OF
ENGLAND.
xForn Street has its
“Pantheon;" Regent
Street its “Circus;”
and a club-house in Pall
Mall is called the “Athe-
naeum.” In addition to
these classicalities of
London, there were for-
merly THE AUGEAN
STABLEs.
The original Augean
Stables were tenements
- appertaining to one Au-
— geas, king of Elis, a
a country of Pelopon-
nesus. They had been
occupied formany years
by about three thousand head of
live stock, consisting of goats and
oxen, and during all that time had
never once been cleaned out; so
that, although externally they bore
the appearance of stables, their in-
terior arrangements were rather like
those of a pig-sty, and one of a par-
ticularly bad style. Perhaps, how-
ever, as there were no pigs in them we had better say that they were
a sort of ill-regulated cow-houses; but whether pig-sties, cow-houses,
or stables, they were extremely insalubrious and unpleasant, and
ought to have been indicted for a nuisance. Hercules, during his
mortal career, performed the astonishing feat of cleansing and dul-
cifying these odoriferous outhouses in one day, which master-piece
of scavengery he accomplished by the simple process of turning the
course of the river Alpheus through them. Divested, by this means,
of their delicate superfluities, they were fit, with a little clean straw,
for the accommodation of a racing stud; though perhaps they would
first have required a little rose-water.
The English Augean Stables, which were in existence so lately as
the year 1843, were situated in various parts of London. , Some were
called Offices; others, Courts; but the principal were denominated
Houses. These last stood on the Middlesex side of the Thames
contiguous to Westminster Bridge. Their outside was really very
like that of common stables; the reason of which, was, that they
had been built up in a great hurry for temporary use, the old
buildings having been recently burnt down. What may seem singular,
that accident had not in the slightest degree ameliorated the state of
the interior from which they had derived their appellation. But the
filth in them was moral filth, which is incombustible by material fire.
The whooping, shouting, yelling, hooting, groaning, and other
uncouth and zoological noises which were occasionally made in these
stables, might have induced the hearer, if out of sight of what was
going on within, to suppose that they were really what they seemed
to be, at least, that they were mews, or pens, or menageries, where
wild beasts and other animals were confined. Among these sounds
there was a very common one which much resembled braying: nor
when, upon being more distinctly listened to, it was found to be
articulate, did the similitude disappear.
However, the occupants of these edifices were really human beings;
though not a few, in the qualities of their intellect, partook strongly

of the asinine nature; and it was remarked in a celebrated news-
paper of the day, that any allusion made to the thistle-munching
quadruped of the long ears was certain to excite a sort of sympathetic
cachinnation in the assembly held therein. Several, from their
connexion with agriculture, and also from their tastes, habits, and
ideas, might figuratively have been termed oxen; but the only bulls
in the Augean Stables were Irish, or oral bulls, and these were
tolerably numerous. Goats, there were none, unless the represen-
tative of a Welchman may be called a goat; but of monkeys and
puppies of the biped class, particularly in that division of the stables
which was entitled “The Upper House,” there was a considerable
number.
The tenants of the Augean Stables, did not live in them always;
they only came there on certain evenings from about January or
February until August. The purpose for which they met was that
of law-making, but they made many more speeches than laws.
The object of their legislation was professedly the greatest possible
happiness of the public at large, but it was really the greatest possible
happiness of the individual legislators. When, in early times, they
made laws with ropes about their necks, they enacted whatever
pleased the tyrant for the time being—thus judiciously saving their
own bacon : and latterly, when they began to be subject to “pressure
from without,” they consulted the public good just as far as they
were obliged, and no further; allowing justice and benevolence to be
squeezed out of them by instalments, to an amount exactly propor-
tioned to that pressure.
They were divided into two principal classes, who differed theo-
retically about matters of government, but were cordially united on
the principle of taking care of themselves. There was a third and
small party whose aim was to promote the national welfare, but
those who composed it were scouted.
It will now be seen that the legislation in the Augean Stables was
very dirty work; and, the place not having been cleaned out since
its foundation several centuries back, (though an abortive attempt
with that view was made in 1830,) that the accumulation of filth
there must have boen prodigious. This chiefly consisted of foul and
sordid Acts, which, therefore, instead of being wholesome and
salutary, as such Acts ought to have been, were grievously the
reverse, to the infinite scandal and offence of all rightly constituted
noses.
The other places which were likewise denominated Augean Stables,
were also in a very disgraceful state. The various Courts were
defiled with injustice; and one in particular, yelept the Court of
Chancery, was so overladen with rascality that it was called in bitter
irony the Court of Equity. Of the Offices, those termed Police Offices
were full of partiality and oppression, and those which belonged to
the Government, besides swarming with a sort of locusts, caterpillars,
and other vermin, who preyed on the vitals of the country, were
replete with fraud and humbug.
Such were the delightful dens, which Hercules, by way of parallel
to his former achievement found it his vocation to clean out. Of
course it will be supposed, that as of yore he turned the river
Alpheus through the stables of his Majesty Augeas, so did he divert
the Thames through those of the British Sovereign. It is not certain
that he had not at first some idea of so doing, the principal stables
being commodiously situated for this purpose, and the creatures
within them as richly deserving a drenching as did the cattle and
“creeping things” which did not go up into Noah's Ark. But there
were two objections to this plan; first, that a great many of the said
creatures were, if there be any truth in a certain proverb–exempt
from a watery death; and secondly, that to direct that stream
through all the stables, some of which lay dispersedly, was physically
impossible. But there was another stream which was capable of
swamping them all, and he availed himself of it as we shall see.
This stream was the tide of Public Opinion. How to raise it, was
the difficulty, though it is easier to raise the water than to raise the
wind. But heroes make no bones of difficulties, and break a great
many in spite of them. And never more potent was enchanter's
wand in amousing the strengh of the billows, than the club of Hercules.
Prospero's was a rattan to it. In faith he flourished it to some
purpose; but first he therewith hoisted out of the sluggish and
stagnant waters of the popular mind all those weeds of prejudice,
ignorance, gullibility and selfishness, which had till then kept it a
dull toad-pond. And when he had done this, it was a grand sight to
see how, first swaying to and fro like an awakened ocean, it gradually
rose and swelled, and heaved up its waves unto the sky. For he had
stirred it up from the very bottom, whence burst and bubbled up
fresh and pure springs innumerable; insomuch, that it became a
vast world of waters. And now Hercules smote it with his club, as
whilom Neptune, when he had a mind to brew up a storm, was wont
to smite the main with his trident. Whereat, it roared and foamed
terrifically, and broke with tremendous force against the black rocks
of Interest, Bribery, and Corruption, which were set up to dam it
out from the stables. The rocks shook and trembled to their found-
ations by reason of its violence, and from behind them arose shouts
of rage, and unmeaning menaces, and imprecations, and cries of
alarm, amid all which a noise as of many donkeys was distinctly
audible. Bit by bit, large masses of rock crumbled and fell with an
astonishing sound into the gulf beneath; wherefrom a voice of great
triumph, as the voice of many thunders, ascended, rending the air.
Nor did the flood, it being now pure, replace with muddy depositions
the havoc which it continually made. At last, it having attained
to its full height and power, and the rocks having been thoroughly
sapped and undermined, Hercules, standing on the shore, did, with
one end of his all-potent and magnetic club attract the huge body of
waves unto himself, and then, presenting unto it the other, he repelled
and dismissed it, full flow, with irresistible momentum against its
barriers, which it burst, broke down, and
bore away in its overwhelming tide,-and
then, rushing with unchecked course through
those sinks of stables, washed off at one
sweep the accumulated abominations of ages.
And so Hercules cleaned out the Augean
Stables.

IPunch's Friendly Union National Institution.
To give employment to industrious artisans by a distribution twice a
year, viz., April 1st and October 29th, of furniture from Brokers' Alley,
old clothes from Hemings' Row, boots from Field Lane, and wooden legs
from Chelsea Hospital; each article varying in value from nothing to one
farthing.
The society requires no gift or donation for its support, as it is main-
tained solely by the difference between the value of the prizes and the
amount of the subscription.
The prizes, besides being distributed by lot, consist entirely of unsale-
able commodities, and thus all interference with the ordinary trades-
man is prevented.
The committee desire the utmost publicity to be given to their affairs,
and they earnestly wish that all persons who seek for information as to
the management of the society—may get it.
The public are assured that the institution bears no similarity whatever

Court Circular.
3.Jumtb's
zºº; N Monday last her Majesty paid another
º visit to Drury Lane Theatre. The
audience was by no means so nume-
rous as on many other similar occa-
sions ; but when we reflect that her
Majesty has been so frequent a visitor
at the patent houses (all of which visits
Punch has particularly chronicled)
since her accession to the throne; when
we recollect that she has dignified
every new production, of any value,
with her presence,—the relaxed curio-
sity of the public may in some mea-
sure be accounted for. Neverthe-
less, the house was extremely full, and
the road from Buckingham Palace to
Russell-street lined with her Majes-
ty's affectionate subjects; all of whom
- seemed to be impressed with this, the
fiftieth demonstration of her Majesty's regard and interest towards the
drama of her country. It was the glory of Elizabeth to patronise a living
Shakspeare: Victonia has made it her equal glory to foster the representa-
tives of SHAkspeaRE's muse; to show by a thousand acts worthy of a Queen,
how sensibly she felt the moral majesty of the drama in its highest and
purest development. It is this devoted, we may say affectionate, solicitude
of her Majesty towards the literature and arts of her own country that
has secured to her the blessings of the Muses of England. From the top
jewel of her crown to the extreme point of her satin slipper, her Majesty is
all English—and the English drama and English musicher especial delights.
Her Majesty and Prince Albert visited the theatre in state. They
arrived precisely at seven, when God save the Queen was sung, after
which the comedy began. Her Majesty seemed to take an especial in-
terest in the progress of the play, turning frequently to Prince Albert, as
though to explain the “cunning of the scene,” a task for which her
Majesty's frequent theatrical visits and deep dramatic studies particularly
fit her. On the conclusion of the comedy, her Majesty was graciously
pleased to send for Mr. Macready, to whom she condescendingly expressed
her high delight, at the same time presenting him with a very splendid
diamond ring, in token of her admiration of his acting, and of the spirit
and high classical taste of his management.
We are not yet permitted to enter into details; but we can assure our
readers that it is the express wish of the Queen that Mr. Macready should
continue the management of the Theatre. Further particulars (perhaps)
in our next.

A perfectly Nowel, Article FOR THE TOILETTE.
MR. TRUEFITT, Artist in Hair to his late Majesty, George the Fourth,
has brought to perfection his Newly-invented PATENT WHIskER-seed,
which has been extensively patronised by the Officers of the Hussars and
Lancers, and the Military in general.
The process of using Truefitt's New PATENT WHiskER-seed is extremely
simple : the cheeks having been prepared with a fragrant unguent mixed
with common pitch, the seeds are dibbled in, with great precision, a
hair's breadth from each other. In about a week, they take root, and if
properly attended to, they will then begin to shoot ; precaution must be
observed in not combing them too strongly in their early growth, as the
tender plants are very apt to come out.
If the weather should be cold, it would be advisable to hang a kettle-
holder over each plantation of whisker-seed ; but the whiskers would be
brought to a high state of fertility if the gentleman would wear a common
cupping-glass, affixed in the customary way, to each cheek.
The PATENT Whisker-seed is sold in packets, 7s.6d. each, being more
than enough for one pair of whiskers, one pair of mustaches, and an
imperial tip.

BY THE OBSERVER'S OWN CORRESPONDENT.
MR. MacReady has certainly lost money at Drury Lane, but we cannot
give the precise sum, and indeed we have nothing to give, so that if we
would we couldn't. Whether he would retrieve his losses at Covent
Garden is another question; but if he don't go to Covent Garden he can't,
and if he should he may ; but still, if he did, he mightn't. This however
is not the time to talk of these things, but still we may be excused for
speaking out at this moment, even if we are taken to task for doing so,
because we mean well, though people will go about saying they don't know
what we mean.
We have heard it said that Macready thinks of going to America.
ºs
A voyage or discoveluy Round the Globe.
We of course don’t know what his movements are ; but if he takes our ad-
vice, he will not go without thinking, for when he gets there once, he may
have to think twice what good he has got by going. If he stays, he certainly
will not go; but he might go somewhere else: so that even if he does not
stay, it is not quite certain that he will go—at least to America. He is
generally understood to be an excellent husband and a good father, so that
if he goes he will either take his family with him or leave them behind,
and in the latter case he will leave them very comfortably off, that is to
say, as comfortable as a family can be in the absence of its principal
member.
MARRIAGES IN PROSPECTIVE.
It is rumoured that the lovely and accomplished niece of an official
personage whose duties take him very often to the Tower-street Station
House, is about to give her hand, having already given her heart, to an
individual whose name is the same as that of a certain facetious member
of the Anti-corn Law League, whose other appellation is Sydney. It is
also whispered that the trousseau is to be bought at Oxenham's, who has
announced his monthly sale of unredeemed pledges.
We have heard it hinted that Mr. Jones, of Brunswick House, has won
the affections of the daughter of a great metropolitan traveller connected
with a firm in the City. #. will have the effect of cementing still further
the happy union existing between the civic powers and the House of

THE STORY OF A FEATHER.
chap. xxiii.-A SHORT ACCOUNT OF A HIGHWAYMAN.—ARRIVAL OF
M. R. LINTLEY.
THE clamour raised by Hardmouth and the watch had made its
due impression on the neighbourhood; many of the dwellers there-
about having a most delicate, a most educated organ for the music of
justice, or rather, of police. Hence, in a brief time, the house was
beset by curious enquirers, anxious to learn the peculiar offence com-
mitted, whether it rose to the tragic dignity of murder, or descended
to the sneaking littleness of petty larceny. Nor was it wholly curi-
osity that brought many to the door of Mrs. Crumpet. There were
some, who very justly indignant at the prying propensities of the
watch, knew not where they might stop. “Nobody's house is safe 1"
cried one. “Waking honest people up in the dead of night !” cried
others: whilst a few declared, upon the responsibility of their own
invention, that one of Mrs. Crumpet's lodgers had murdered a bishop
on Hounslow Heath, and, with a heathenish contempt of religion, had
pawned the dead man's canonicals. It was, however, very creditable
to the general sympathy, that everybody expressed unbounded satis-
faction at Abram's escape. Much of this I heard where I lay, as it
sounded from the street beneath ; and I confess my feeling of curi-
osity was awakened to learn something more of the fugitive.
It appeared, as I afterwards found out from the gossip let fall
about me, that Clickly Abram was a mercer's man of rising reputa-
tion. He was young, good-looking, and, as the women declared, the
best creature that ever broke the bread of life. Clickly, however,
had this seemingly inborn prejudice—he preferred the bread of other
people to the bread of his own hands. To this prejudice, may be
traced all the difficulties of Clickly's too short career. In the pur-
suit of his business, whilst measuring a delectable lutestring, he was
shot dead behind his master's counter by a pair of fatal eyes, alas !
too skilful in such mortal practice. Clickly's story is as old, as worn,
as London stones. He was led step by step in silken chains to earn
the iron fetters of Newgate. Mrs. Crumpet—I take the good woman's
own avowal—had not the remotest suspicion of the highway profes-
sion of her lodger. No ; it was a base, vile story. He always paid
his way, and she would not believe it.
But I have left Patty wretched and desolate. She sat with a look
of dreadful resignation in her face—a look that, for a moment, made
Hardmouth pause, the while he rubbed his chin, and doubtingly
observed, “if nothing could be proved agin her, why nothing could
come of it. Though if she warn’t positively Mrs. Abram—if she
warn’t really married to him, why, perhaps, it might go the harder
with her, because the law—though he never could find out the
reason of that, supposed that a woman was under the authority of
her husband.” Having delivered this, the sagacious officer was
about to raise the girl from her seat, when she swooned and lay like
a corpse in his arms.
“You villains 1 you'll murder the poor thing !” cried a woman, a
neighbour, who with others had crowded into the garret, and who,
with this indignant cry, rushed down stairs.
“You’ll never move her in that state t” exclaimed Mrs. Crumpet.
“She’ll be better in a minute,” answered Hardmouth; and lifting
the girl, as though she had been an infant, he descended the stairs,
followed by the watchmen. Mrs. Crumpet for a moment stood alone
in the garret, casting bewildered looks about her—and then whirling
round and round in a passion of despair—she caught me up, and
rushed from the attic. When she arrived at the bottom of the stairs,
she found the street-door open, and Hardmouth and his party about
to carry Patty from the house.
“Stop-stop,” cried the woman who had left the garret ere Patty
was removed, “stop till the doctor sees her. As the Lord would have
it, he was at a labour at No. 9, and—God bless him l—here comes the
gentleman.” After a moment, Hardmouth turned with his charge
into her parlour, and was followed by Mrs. Crumpet, who stuck me
in a china mug upon the mantel-piece.
Another moment, and the kind-hearted woman, who had sought
his assistance, shewed my old acquaintance, Mr. Lintley, into the
room. He looked cold and pinched; and I could not but observe
that his great-coat might have been thicker. There was an air of
languor and fatigue about him ; yet, did the goodness of his heart,
the gentle eheerfulness of his mind, sit triumphant over his looks,
and he smiled as he asked, “Where is the patient t "
“Here she is, doctor,” answered Hardmouth, pointing to Patty
still insensible.
“Good God 1" cried Lintley, and his face changed, and he clasped
his hands and compressed his lips, struggling to master a rising emo-
tion, as he gazed at the feather-dresser. “How—what is this 1" he
asked.
“Why, doctor, you see—there's been a little bit of highway rob-
bery. Click Abram's the man we want—but the bird's flown. How-
somever, we found this in his nest, along with his wife there ;” and
Hardmouth, weighing the watch in his hand, nodded significantly
towards Patty.
“It’s no such thing,” cried Mrs. Crumpet. “She’s not his wife—
she"—
“Well, that’s not our affair,” said Hardmouth—“ as I’ve said
afore, if she isn't, she ought to be.”
“Stay—tell me”— cried Lintley, and his lips trembled, and he cast
a look of extreme pain towards Patty—“what is the distinct charge
against this young woman f"
“Why, her husband—or as good as her husband, has committed
robbery; we hunted him here, but he got clean off, leaving the girl
in bed, and this watch with her.”
Lintley, with troubled looks, took the watch from the officer. I
then, for the first time, had a full view of it. In a moment, I recog-
nised the metal chronometer sold by Shadrach Jacobs to my earliest
English friend, Jack Lipscomb, and beguiled again from Jack by the
potent blandishments of Miriam. And now was Patty, poor, self-
denying thing, by the force of circumstances, in the deep shadow of
suspicion ; now was she deemed the tainted associate of vice—its
companion and its comforter. I glanced again at the watch, again
saw upon its dial-plate the sea-tost ship, again read—“Such is life,”
written beneath it.
“There must be some mistake; I am sure of it,” said Lintley with
emphasis.
“Very like, sir,” answered Hardmouth ; “but, you see, sir, law has
nothing to do with mistakes—law has nothing to do but to punish 'em.”
“Leave her with me, officer—for a few minutes, at least. Some
water,” and the apothecary turned to Mrs. Crumpet. “Poor soul .
she is much shattered—much changed; but she will soon revive—
'tis nothing but fainting.”
After many entreaties, Hardmonth, who expressed a sort of respect
towards the apothecary—having heard his virtues extolled by several
women who had thronged the door—consented to leave the room,
Mrs. Crumpet adding the further inducement of the second bottle of
wine left by Patty's unknown patron.
Lintley administered restoratives, and in a brief time Patty became
conscious of the presence of her first benefactor. She blushed,
trembled, wept, yet, in her excess of agitation, felt a strange comfort
that, in this new affliction, her first friend was with her.
“Tell me, Patty,” said Lintley, in a calm, sad voice, “how is it that
I find you in such a place f”
“It was the best—the only place I could find shelter in,” was the
meek answer.
“Wherefore, and stealthily, too—wherefore did you quit my
house Come, I must know everything,” said Lintley.
“You shall, sir, everything—as though I talked to my own soul,
you shall know all;” and Patty paused as though she needed strength
to proceed.
“Go on; wherefore, then f" asked Lintley.
“I was not happy, sir. Mrs. Lintley was not happy. I felt that
my presence brought upon you disquiet; I felt that—God pardon
them l—your kindness towards an orphan girl made foolish, thought-
less people talk, and it was my duty, though I should die, to go
away.”
“Yet, tell me,” said the apothecary, “for I must trace you step by
step—tell me, what could have brought you here P’
“I sought for work, and found a little—a very little. Yet 'twas
enough—I made it enough. I found, too, a kind person to dwell
with ; but I was persecuted, and”
“Persecuted, child | By whom f"
“By a strange woman—a strange, old woman. Day after day she
came to the house—I never went abroad but she followed me. I
know not how it was, I felt for her a loathing I never knew for any
human creature, I could not endure her. And then I heard strange
stories of her; and so that I might free myself from her, unknown to
anybody, I hid myself here. I had not long been in this house, when
I fell ill—they told me, very ill.”
“Ill, indeed,” said Lintley, looking with compassionate eyes at the
poor wasted creature.
Patty smiled, and with strange earnestness asked, “Very ill 1 am
I not, Sir "
“A little quiet, with careful tending, and your health will now
return,” said Lintley.

“And I shall not die "asked Patty, with sudden melancholy.
“Certainly not,” answered Lintley ; “you will be an old woman
yet, Patty.”
“God forbid 1" cried the girl, her eyes filling with tears. “Oh, sir,
do not take from me the hope which for many a day has been my
sole comfort, which I have nursed, fondled, doated on, the hope
of death. This may, I know, be a happy world ; but, though young,
I have scen enough of it. I have neither strength nor carelessness
sufficient to struggle and live on as I have lived. I would wish to die.
Oh, sir, indeed indeed, I speak the truth ! You know, not how
beautiful to me is death ! What ease—what comfort—what sweet
repose within a grave "
“And is the world so barren to you, Patty?” asked Lintley. “Do
you not sin in such a wish f"
“Oh, sir, do not think me ungrateful. All your kindness I feel,
past words to speak it. Your kindness in relieving me here—my
landlady has told me all—your gifts of "
“My gifts : No, child—not mine—it is the merest accident that
has brought me to this house; where, in truth, it grieves me to find
you. Hear me, yet a few words. I would wish to believe you still
good—still innocent, Patty”—
“Oh, sir!” exclaimed the girl with sudden passion—“why should
you not What have I done—God help me !—what have I done *
“Listen, and patiently. I find you in a house, nay, in a neighbour-
hood known and noted as shameful. I came here to fulfil a duty of
humanity—prayed and entreated hither to assist a poor helpless
creature in her worst agony. It was well I came, Patty, or we might
never”—here the apothecary's voice thickened, and he hesitated—
“we might never again have met in this world.”
“I bless the chance,” cried Patty, sobbing.
“I find you, girl”—here Lintley paused, and then sadly continued
—“I find you in deepest misery. It seems you are said to be the
wife or worse companion of a nightly robber.”
“You do not believe it—you cannot believe it”—screamed Patty.
“Stolen property—stolen by him—is found in your bed. Answer
me, girl—for others you must answer—how is this "
“Almost as much as I know, you know. I had fallen asleep; the
door was burst in—the window opened—by some strange man, who
muttered curses when I called to him; from the window, struggling
and striving with terrible strength, he made his way, as I suppose,
across the house-tops.”
“A watch was found”—said Lintley.
“It must have fallen from the man, as he escaped,” answered
Patty.
Lintley approached the girl, and taking her hand in his, looked
stedfastly in her face, saying—“And this man you knew not "
“No,” answered Patty, looking back the look.
“And you are as innocent of all this,” said Lintley, his eyes moist-
ening—“as I could wish you?”
“I am—I am”—cried the girl. “Oh, sir!
this misery you will not forsake me?”
“I do believe you, Patty,” answered Lintley, with solemn voice—
“and so believing, I will not forsake you.”

MAY IT PLEAs E You R Roy AL HIGHNess :
I Approach you with all humility, begging your most royal forgive-
ness. In the last number but one of my amazing publication, I printed
a letter, as from your distinguished hand; a letter, in which you
were made to profess great indignation that you—a rich, an im-
mensely rich man—should beg a dowry from the hard-taxed people
of England for your daughter—the Princess Augusta. The idea of
such sordid pauperism you were made to contemptuously reject.
Recent circumstances prove that letter to be a gross forgery. I
regret it exceedingly. I have been imposed upon ; and yet the tenor
of the letter was so like your gracious—your benevolent self—that it
would have been an ill compliment to you not to have been deceived.
But, your Royal Highness, an apology is due to you. The letter is

or it.

MR. AND Miss RANTWELL.
These talented individuals are father and child in private life, and they
generally engage for the same interesting line of business in their profes-
sional capacity. Mr. Rantwell is what is generally termed an old stager.
He has, to use his own expression, “roughed it” all through his life,
and there seems to be no probability of his ever smoothing it. His
daughter, Miss Rantwell, was, of course, introduced at a very tender age
to the profession, and made her first squall upon any stage, as the Child
in “Pizarro,” to an overflowing and fashionable barn in Tadcaster. In
the usual course of business she went through the whole range of dramatic
children. Her father subsequently became the temporary lessee of a
back parlour in a provincial public-house, for a series of three entertain-
ments, supported by his daughter, whom we now find announced as the
Infant Prodigy. In consequence of the decline of the taste for the drama,
Mr. Rantwell was unable to carry out his original intentions, and he con-
sequently carried out the whole of his luggage in the middle of the night,
and left the village to regret at leisure the consequences of its illiberality.
Mr. Rantwell afterwards joined a small circuit in the north ; and his
daughter, having starred it as the Infant Prodigy until her size belied
the appellation, he consented to let her fall into the ordinary ranks of the
profession. The great experience of Mr. Rantwell renders him what is
termed a “valuable acquisition,”—which means that he can command his
twelve shillings a week at any theatre in the kingdom. He at one time
obtained an engagement for general utility in London, and was cast the
part of the French Ambassador in a new vaudeville. He had only twe
short speeches to deliver, one of which was couched in these words,-
“Come, my lord, let us dispense with diplomatic ceremony, and proceed
to business.” The author of the piece made some very offensive obser-
vations on the manner in which the new actor pronounced the word
“diplomatic.” Our hero protested that he should have it “all right at
night;" but when night came the “diplomatic * “stuck in the throat,”
and at the end of the season he received his discharge. Rantwell felt
that he had been hardly dealt with ; for, as he himself very justly ob-
served, “the part was that of a French ambassador; the obnoxious word
was quite un-English, and he (Rantwell) was not engaged to play
foreigners.” Rantwell returned to the provinces a snubbed, but not a
heartbroken, man. He rejoined his daughter in the provinces, and has
since continued to play the “heavy fathers” to her “interesting hero-
ines.” The beautiful art with which they act together through a whole
piece without recognising each other until the last scene ; the splendid
effect with which the daughter discloses herself by throwing her hair off
her forehead ; and the magnificent manner in which both recede back-
wards to the wings, previous to their springing forward to meet in the
centre, and rush to each other's bosoms—may be equalled, but can never
be surpassed. Nothing can be more touching than Miss Rantwell's “Oh

ought, perhaps, to mention that the young lady is particularly fine in

of the wisps of straw about her dress—the grand point in all stage in
sanity—is considered to be very picturesque and artistical.

THE GRATUITOUS EXHIBITIONS OF LONDON.
CHAPTER VII.-THE OUTSIDE OF DRURY LANE THEATRE.
His exhibition at
the present mo-
ment possesses
great attractions,
for as the insides
of the respective
patent theatres
have for some
time ceased to en-
tice the multi-
tude, we may fair-
ly presume that
e 2. A the outsides have
Sººrisen in favour
proportionately.
This is probably
the case, although
somewhat singu-
lar ; because the
multiplicity of or-
ders perpetually
going in, and corresponding paucity of money, have all but converted
the drama into an exhibition as gratuitous as any of those we have
endeavoured to describe. The managers have, perhaps, found it to
be peculiarly so.
Without allowing the eye to be drawn away from the higher
objects of art, by the temporary depôts for the sale of empty money-
boxes and fictitious jewellery set in brass upon the steps of the chief
entrance of Drury Lane Theatre, (and which are symbolical, according
to some, of the treasury and wardrobe of the theatre; and according
to others, of the pockets and pretensions of the authors and actors,)
we call the attention of the spectator to the architectural objects of
interest pertaining to the exterior,
The best position for viewing the façade of Drury Lane Theatre is
standing with your back against the opposite side of the way, in the
vicinity of a vast padlock which overhangs the pavement, and
betokens the abode of some cunning worker in metals, who must
have undertaken a vast contraet to supply the giants with domestic
articles, in common with the fabricators of the huge tea-kettle in
Tottenham Court-road, the by-no-means-to-be-despised stick of sealing
wax in Fleet-street, the Brobdignagian boots and shoes in various
places, and the noble dustpan in High Holborn, before alluded to.
Looking, then, from this position, the first thing that arrests the
attention, and we may perhaps add the only one, is the statue of
Shakspere over the portico, which is placed there as allegorical of
the drama. His back is turned towards the theatre, in revenge for
the theatre having, for so long a time, turned its back upon him ;
and he is pointing with an air of contempt to a blank scroll, typical of
syncretic literature and the modern drama. Beyond this slight sneer,
he looks, generally, remarkably black; principally in consequence of
no one in particular ever having cared to revive him properly, or
pring him out in his pristine glory from the accumulated crust of
years that has now coated him. Should any steps be taken towards
beautifying him, it is supposed, in accordance with the prevalent
taste of the present day, that he will be clothed in gay colours and
tinsel, which, although they may in a measure destroy the classic
beauty of the statue, will nevertheless go a great way in attracting
public attention towards it. -
Proceeding now in a northerly direction, and turning to the right
in the direction of Russell-street, an imposing view is gained of the
portico which runs from the stage entrance to the pit door. Near
this spot, against the wall, is preserved (or was until very lately) a
curious document illustrative of manners and customs, relative to the
conduct of coachmen and carriages about the middle of the nineteenth
century. From this point a fine coup d’aeil is obtained of the street-
door of the “Albion” opposite ; and when it is open, and the weather
clear, the eye of the spectator can penetrate right up the passage
and into the coffee-room.
Keeping on, under the portico, the visitor arrives at the Royal en-
trance, which, from its importance, deserves especial notice ; for it is
a gratifying and glorious thing to find the Court so energetic in its
2ndeavours to sustain our drama, by attending the performances with
such constancy, and seldom deigning to countenance the alien exhi-
bitions of gold-thirsty foreigners. Our beloved young Sovereign can,
happily for our stage, appreciate the golden words and sentiments of
Shakspere far beyond the musical vagaries of Tweedledetti or
Tweedledini: or the meretricious antics of a few capering Phrynes.
A fine representation of the royal arms in alto-reliero is placed over
the centre door; and night after night do its portals admit the best
and highest in the land, to the gratification of all who feel an interest
in the welfare of our highest style of literature—to the admiration
of the spectators and the heartfelt joy of the audience, performers,
and manager. Indeed, it is this unvarying patronage from Royalty
that has placed the English Drama upon the proud eminence on
which it at present stands. Beyond this spot a few steps conduct
the visitor to the stage-door—an unassuming entrance, guarded by
one of the class of stage doorkeepers, who are proverbially men of
gentle dispositions, courteous demeanour, and winning address. This
is the point from which the various performers can be best seen for
nothing, as well as the assistants. The thunder is now going for some
porter to the public-house opposite, in company with the rain, who
is rather dry, and a few friends of the other elements are waiting for
them, when the rehearsal is finished. The liberality of the manage.
ment provides a playbill, hung up at the side of the door, for the
study and amusement of those who are loitering about for their
acquaintances; and by committing this to memory, the expense of
buying one may be saved, should the penny be an object, in visiting
the interior.
In connexion with those portions of the theatre which may be
seen gratuitously, we may mention, en passant, the Box Office. The
public are admitted, during the season, between the hours of ten and
four. There are some statues worth
notice, including another of him that
“wrote not for an age, but for all time,”
(except the present,) over the round-
about fireplace in the centre, as well
as a curious model of the inside of the
theatre. As a work of art, this is most
excellent; and it is chiefly useful upon
going to take places before any extra-
attractive performance, in showing
what capital seats you might have
had, only you came too late. As a
faithful representation of the theatre
it is commendable; and especially
so, at this precise time, from being (...)
destitute of audience. -
A broken window, adjoining the
gallery entrance, and looking into Vinegar Yard, may be pointed
out as an interesting relic of antiquity. It has never been mended
in the memory of the oldest purveyor of play-bills and ham-sand-
wiches, but has remained in the same state throughout the various
dynasties that have ruled the theatre since it was first erected. It
will possibly never be repaired, but allowed to keep as it is, a proof
that the window to which it belongs is fitted up with glass, and not
with wood, or sheet-iron, as its present encrusted state would lead
many to imagine. Au reste, age will add increased interest to its
fragments, and as no manager will ever be found to expend three-and-
sixpence where there is no positive necessity for so doing, in future
times this broken pane will be looked upon with the same feelings of
veneration as the dilapidated Acropolis, the Pompeian fragments at
Portici, or the shored-up and boarded-in ruins of the street—we never
knew its name—which runs from Long Acre to High Street, St. Giles's,
under an arching, and by the side of two establishments which are
now being levelled to the ground by the ruthless spirit of improve-
ment: the warehouse from which the eye of Grimstone unceasingly
watched the thoroughfare, wherein people sneezed by sympathy as
they passed, and the all-sort shop at the corner, which had a perpetual
Watteau for sale within ever since we can call its existence to mind.

A SIMPLE QUESTION.
MR. Punch,--I have been sometime from England—shut away from all
newspapers. Will you, therefore, inform me if the Lord Brougham who
a night or two since gave a party to the Duke of Cumberland, is the same
Lord Brougham who, in the House of Lords, some sessions back, stigma-
tised the same Duke as being “illustrious” only “by courtesy "
Your's A TRAveLLER.

We have sometimes heard of “the blind leading the blind,” and it is a
very curious fact that Sir Peter Laurie is one of the Governors of Bed-
lam. There is a terrace in the neighbourhood which boasts of his arms
over the top of the centre house; but his mind is evidently with the insti-
tution we have alluded to.

A ROYAL WIFE OF–£3,000 !
Reaper, when you listen to the bells merrily ringing the birth of
a Prince or Princess, what changes do they sound —Merely the
changes of £. *. d. -
when you hear the Park, and Tower Guns, loaded with harmless
powder, roar away at a royal birth, what say their thundering voices !
Simply, that to their powder, John Bull must some day add the shot.
Her Majesty has sent down a message to her loving and dutiful
Commons. At first our senators believed the whispered communi-
|
cation to be applicable to Ireland. Thoughts of guns; swords, and
pistols, conflagrations and hangings, shocked the sensibilities of our
law-makers : but soon their latent horror gave way to merriment;
for instead of O'Conn Ell, decorated with repeal button and riband,
and looking dismemberment, there was Hy Men, gracious Hymen,
in his crocus robe, and loves and doves and graces numberless | Sir
Rob ERT Peel informed the Commons (many of whom were in
ecstacy at the news) that the Princess August A was about to be
dropt into the cup of ‘bliss (which would then be overflowing) of
the Hereditary Duke of Mecklenburgh Sr Relitz. The Duke,
however, wanted something more in his cup to make the draught
palatable; in a word, the wife was very well—but, with the wife he
wanted money.
What a pity it is that Majesty and Mendicity are so frequently
allied . The Commons were desired to make a suitable provision for
German housekeeping, the Duke of CAMBRIDGE, with paternal
generosity, having resolved to make an allowance to his daughter
during his natural life. We know that democratic discontent has
called the Duke a rich man; and therefore, asks of his Royal Hign-
ness why, like any other man who has traded upon the capital of the
country—why, he should not at his death (be the day far distant 1)
leave sufficient means to the child of his affection These people
are foolish, ferocious reasoners. Do they forget that the Duke of
CAMH Ridge is one running conduit of benevolence He drops gold
as he walks for the poor and needy. Look at his constant attendance
at charity dinners. Reflect upon his
subscriptions thereat. We know that
slanderous tongues declare these sub-
ºscriptions to be apocryphal—we know
that they call the gracious Prince of
the House of Brunswick no more than
a royal decoy duck to plebeian purses.
This we do not believe; moreover,
we pity the man who can believe it.
The Princess Aususta, after the
death of her father (who, there is no
doubt, will vindicate his character for
active benevolence by dying not worth
a single shilling,) will receive £3,000 a
year from the taxes. This is moderate
- -very moderate indeed. How the
young couple will be able to get on we
know not. To be sure, the court of
Staelitz is not quite so dear as that
of St. James's, and so they may get fish
and pudding for dinner all the year
round. Again, when we remember that
the immense sum of £10,000 was voted
only for the education of the poor of
\: all England, we are surprised at the
§ magnanimity which contents itself with
something less than a third of that
amount. If Stockport and Paisley do
not, with all their rushlights, illuminate
when they shall hear the glad tidings,
then is the spirit of manufacture dead
to gratitude—then have weavers no
bowels. (By the way, it would save
them much inconvenience if they
never had.)
. Three thousand per annum ! What
\ is it! Why not a drop of water from
the ocean of John Bull's funds. But it
is the principle—the admirable princi-
ple of philanthropy vindicated in the
grant—the Christianity, in fact, of the
deed. We are suffering cold, hunger,
and nakedness; and yet we give away
a snip of our blanket—a corner of our
penny-loaf-a wristband of our one
\ shirt, to the hereditary Duke of Meck-
Lenburgh St RE1.1tz 1 Mayhe, until
the age of Nestor, enjoy the compelled
donations ! and so be a continual evi-
dence of the magnanimity of John Bull t
May he increase and multiply; and, if
possible, induce John to treat every
little STRElitz with coral-and-bells
and silver-mug. He, himself—the
Hereditary Duke of Mecklenburgh Staelitz—cut his teeth at the
§:Pense of England, his father having been for years its pensioner.
When the old Duke shall be promoted from the wants and miseries of
this world-why, the Hereditary Duke will, in all probability, succeed
to the English gold. This is but right. The eldest son of a beggar
by right, succeeds to his father's waik when his father begs no longer.
Three thousand per annum ! We were never great dabs at arith-
metic ; but, perhaps, there are hard-headed accountants amongst
the operatives of Bolton, or in the cellars of Manchester, who will
acquaint us with the exact number of their beds, tables, chairs,
saucepans, and other household chattels, seized by the Queen's
broker, that would be necessary to make up £3,000—one year's salary
for the Hereditary Duchess of Mecklennuncil starlitz

Herein is the extreme value of the numberless scions of Royalty
with which England is over-blessed. The Duke of CuxtBERLAND
(we mean the King of HANoven) has £23,000 per year from the
sweat of Englishmen. And does not his Highness, or his Kingship,
whilst taking the salary, exercise a most salutary effect upon Bri-
tons Does he not practically teach them the beauty of humility—
of long-suffering—of self-denying charity and benevolence Why,
he is a continual record of the liberality and magnanimity of English-
men, who, if ever they fall into an excess of admiration for Royalty,
will owe the enthusiasm to such bright examples as the monarch of
Hanover. In the east there are benevolent votaries who build ex-
pensive fabrics for the entertainment of the most noisome creatures.
Englishmen are above such superstition ; and in the very pride and
height of their intelligence, allow £23,000 to the King of HANoven.
And the Princess—may she live long and die happy, as the old
saw has it—weds with MEcklenburgh STRELItz. Her nuptials
will be solemn—touching : for at the altar she will see about her
(if, perchance, she think of her dowry,) the pale faces of her country-
men, subscribers, to the £3000 per annum.
The Duke of Cumberland is to give the bride away, and with
her £3,000 a year of Englishmen's money. He is the very man
for the business. The Duke will be drest (we have it on the very
best authority) in the uniform of an English Field Marshal. Could
he turn himself inside out, he might appear as a Black Brunswicker.
Q.
A REFLECTION.
Considering the long and loud lament
That Want and Misery and Hunger utter,
Methinks a Father might be well content
To spread his Children's bread with Cambridge butter.
Then what indignant phrases shall suffice,
Within the compass of a song or sonnet,
When Wealth comes forward with its well-spread slice,
And asks our Poverty for sugar on it !
LONDONDERRY AND LAURELS.
Day or two since, the Marquis of LoNDoN-
DERRY dined with the Merchant Tailors;
when, although Sir G. MURRAY was pre-
sent, the noble and gallant Marquis took
it upon himself to return thanks “for the
Army.” This is as if the letter z should
return thanks for the whole of the al-
phabet.
The noble Marquis, in the course of
his speech, alluded to his “repose” upon
what he would have insinuated to be his
“bed ” of laurels. We remember a scene in a cameras, in which Har-
lequin determines, like the Marquis, to take repose: whereupon he
obtains a feather—a single downy feather. This he blows out, and
makes the most of ; and then laying the one feather upon the ground,
as he would have laid down a feather-bed, lays himself upon it, stretch-
ing forth his limbs in most supreme repose. The Marquis's bed of
laurels must be marvellously like the one-feather bed of Harlequin.
Mind: we by no means question the valour of the Marquis ; certainly
not. We think him as courageous as a battering-ram; and from
exactly the same degree of intelligence.
The Marquis (it was after dinner, be it remembered) said:—
“Higher rewards awaited military enterprise and skill in this than any other country,
and next to the approbation of his Sovereign, the British soldier valued the confidence and
esteem of his fellow citizens. There was only one painful duty that soldiers were ever
called upon to discharge—to put down intestine outrage, to repress insensate agitation.
But their glory was never to shrink from any duty, and when it became necessary—when
they were called upon by the Queen and the Government of the country—he felt assured
they would, as heretofore, acquit themselves, even in that lamentable emergency, so as
to justify the conſidence and merit the eulogy of etery true-hearted Englishman.”
And first for the “military rewards.” The Marquis, of course,
alluded to the scores and scores of Majors and Colonels who en-|-
tered the British army as private soldiers: promotion is so certain
from the ranks.
Soldiers, again, have no painful duty to perform when they com-
mit slaughter and devote a city to flames. That is merely plea-
surable excitement. But the Marquis had O'Con NELL and Ireland
in his eye, and therefore hoped if the British soldier were required
to cut the throats of Irishmen, that he would do it, as Mr. MANTA-
lini would have severed his own windpipe—“dem’d softly.”
ANOTHER MARRIAGE FROM ST. JAMES’.S.
MR. PUNCH,-I am a German, in the suite of the Hereditary Duke of
Mecklenburg Strelitz; I brush his coat, black his boots, and make myself
generally useful. (A gentleman from Paternoster-row, for the trifling
gratuity of one-and-sixpence, writes this for me.) In my own country I
make a tolerable living by training bullfinches; and, to confess the truth,
my object in coming to England with the Duke was to establish an agency
here in London for the sale of my best pipers.
Well, Mr. Punch, the Grand Duke is about to marry the Princess
Augusta. All happiness be with them, as the gentlemen said in the House
of Commons, when Sir Robert Peel talked of an income. Now, Sir, the
Princess has a female servant to whom I am distractedly attached. I feel
that our fate is inseparably linked together, and that either she or the
Serpentine must be my destiny. In a word, I am as much over head and
ears in love with Mary Anne as my distinguished master is in love with
Augusta. And now, Mr. Punch, I want to ask you the precise amount
I ought to demand from St. James's parish if I, a stalwart breeder of
German bullfinches, marry Mary Anne I am not avaricious ; and so
let it be 300l. a year.
Although my heart is bursting for Mary Anne, the 300l. per annum I
must have ; otherwise I should be laughed at, on my return to my native
Losing HIS CASTE.
land, no German ever yet having taken a wife from St. James's without
being capitally paid by John Bull for the compliment.—I remain, your
obedient servant, Gottlieb Goldstlick.
P. S. As Mary Anne's father was many years managing man of a large
establishment for the sale of German clocks, he is rich, very rich, and
therefore promises to allow Mary Anne pin-money as long as he lives.
But, Mr. Punch, life is uncertain ; so I must have the 300l. per annum
uaranteed after the demise of the old gentleman. This the parish of
t.James's can't deny.
QUATRAINS FOR QUARTER-DAY.
WE have liv'd and lov'd together
In the cottage of content,
But I'm sure I know not whether
We ever paid the rent.
We watch'd the daylight going
To the west on golden wings,
Then without our landlord's knowing
We slyly mov’d our things.
We have seen the dark-ey'd stranger
Still watching our abode;
We knew that there was danger,
For we thought of what we owed.
I. O. U.
We have seen our assets dwindle
Down to our final sou,
You felt that we must swindle,
And I always felt with you.
What a flinty heart pervades men,
When they look on one that's poor.
We have seen the stony tradesman
Who would never trust us more.
Let us cross the Scottish Border,
Leave the lion in his lair;
For not e'en a judge's order
I’m told can reach us there.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LEADING ARTICLE FOR AN IRISH JOURNAL.
At a moment like the present, when the distant thunder of the
political firmament is rumbling before us, and a deficiency in the
national accounts is staring us in the face behind ; when agitation
seems a settled thing, and progress is going more backward every
day—when, looking in a straight line, difficulties meet us at every
turn, it is time to take up the pen of the politician to assert that
words are utterly in vain to meet the retreating prosperity of this
almost ruined land. To begin at once with the beginning, let us ask
to what end is all this Echo answers Where ! If we are to go on
much longer without moving, and remain as we are, we shall be in a
very different position from that in which we now are, though hap-
pily we are in such a wretched state, that if we come to the worst it
will assuredly be the best for us. The pitiable condition of the
government is not to be deplored. The ministers are utterly lost,
and we have found them just as we expected. We have all along
said our party owed them nothing, and we are therefore happy of
the opportunity of paying them off. The quicksand of repeal is the
rock they will split upon, and they will be swallowed up in the deep
abyss of their own shallow principles. O'Connell is the last man to
be the first in any illegal act, and his exhortations to the people to
be calm, cannot but excite his fellow countrymen to pursue peace-
ably the troubled path that with his own tongue he has chalked out
for them. We wait the result most certainly with doubt, but while
reflecting on the future we look forward to a repetition of the past,
and fear that we shall hereafter be desirous for the present I
JENKINS IN THE PRESS.
HERE is a rumour that Jenkins, who, within
these few days, has taken the English lan-
guage under his especial protection; Jenkins
who, as a Man of the People, has already
shown his wondrous mastery over Saxon
derivatives,—Jenkins has a new work in the
press, which will be advertised in a day or
two. The announcement will run as follows:
* A NEW AND STARTLING WORK BY JENKINs.
In demy 8vo, very much hot-pressed,
THE TEA-CADDY :
ort,
3. Cale of the CIemple.
A True Story of the Nineteenth Century !”
We have not yet made up our mind. Circumstances will decide us:
but we do not think it improbable that we shall startle the world, and
Jenkins in particular, by printing a few extracts from the production.
All we hope is, that—like Jenkins's last work—it will not be found to be
written “too well.” Certain we are of one fact: nobody can “edit” a
tea-caddy better than Jenkins.

HUME ON ROYAL EXPENDITURE.
WE understand that Mr. Hume is preparing a treatise on royal expen-
diture, and that the basis of his calculations will be on the principle of
| his late astounding discovery, that an annuity of 3,000l. to a female of
22 years of age is worth half a million of money. This conclusion was
no doubt arrived at by the method that would be used in solving the well-
known problem, “If a bath brick cost three-halfpence, what would a
sack of coals come to " Mr. Hume's contemplated work will treat of
the royal dinner table, and contrast its cost with the bill of fare at the
Rupert-street Dining Rooms. He will show that the expensive mode of
doing things at Buckingham Palace is not at all necessary for the royal
comfort, and that the dinner of her Majesty need not come to more than
tenpence, which, allowing twopence for the Lord in Waiting, would
bring it up to the Rupert-street average. This calculation allows only
“a small plate” of meat to the Queen, but it gives her Majesty “two
breads;” and, for the more manly appetite of Prince Albert, Mr. Hume
sets down the sum of sixteen-pence, which, with twopence for Gold
Stick, would amount to one-and-sixpence.
Mr. Hume devotes a whole chapter to the maids of honour, and the
conclusion he arrives at is, that the honour ought to be sufficient remu-
neration for the maids in question. In his section on the bedchamber
women, he enters largely on the subject of their supposed duties, and
gives some interesting tables of the sums he has paid to the housemaids
in his own employ for the last quarter of a century. The very difficult
subject of a month's wages or a month's warning, as applicable to the
Mistress of the Robes, the Comptroller of the Household, and other
highly-paid functionaries, is very nicely handled.
On the whole, we can confidently recommend the book of Mr. Hume
as invaluable to small German princes and sovereigns, to whom the art
of living upon a hundred a year would be of infinite utility. For a
country like England, the practical application of Mr. Hume's theory
would be at present premature. If the author's views prevail, his book
may become useful, unless the nation should contract for the sovereign's
keep in an hotel or boarding-house.
CANZONET OF THE CRAZY.
I’m a wild and gushing creature,
A gay and budding thing,
For I carry in each feature
The laughing tints of spring.
My smile is warm and sunny,
Mine eye is mild and blue,
If I make a joke—'tis funny,
If I tell a tale—'tis true.
I’m free as spring's young flowers,
I'm warm as summer's sky,
I’m as fair as autumn's flowers,
As winter blithe am I.
When I smile, a halo round me
Of ecstacy I throw,
But when tears have almost drown'd me,
I look the type of woe.
Then at my bidding follow
To the shelter of the tree,
Where the sparrow, lark, or swallow,
In his nesty home may be.

Or e'en at sultry noon,
Or when Sol his leave is taking,
